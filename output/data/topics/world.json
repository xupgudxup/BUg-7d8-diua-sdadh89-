    "fullText": "World Skeleton champion Shelley Rudman was the star of Team GB Winter Olympics back in 2006 when she was the only one to return with a medal, creating a fever in her Wiltshire village which is still felt by some today.\n\nAs this year's Winter Olympics kicks off in northern Italy, Rudman said she would never have guessed the lasting legacy that bringing home the silver medal would have on Pewsey, where she was born and still lives.\n\nTwo streets are now named after her, Olympic Road and Silver Road, which she says makes her children very proud.\n\n\"It's a bit surreal, my children love the fact they are named after me,\" Rudman added.\n\nVillagers were invested in her success from the start. They played a key role in fundraising to send her to Turin to compete on the ice, and still proudly remember their involvement.\n\nOne of them being Emma Dainton, who along with Colin Harris, canoed a 35-mile route from Pewsey to Bath along the Kennet and Avon Canal.\n\nEmma said: \"It was so quiet on the canal until a swan chased us for a while, and we joked about it and we cheered each other on.\"\n\nDuring the Games, Emma was travelling in Australia and watched the heats on TV with her fellow backpackers.\n\n\"I told them all about Shelley and how I was part of her fundraising team and she was from my village,\" she added.\n\nBack at home, nothing could prepare landlord Jerry Kunkler for the world's media and fans cramming into his Moonrakers pub.\n\n\"My phone kept ringing and ringing, all the local and national media wanted to come to the pub, it was all happening.\n\n\"I had to get up early for breakfast TV and was able to talk to Shelley live from Turin. It was a whirlwind,\" he added.\n\nFollowing the Games, Shelley was greeted by a champion's welcome when she arrived home.\n\nLocal newspaper reporter Nigel Kerton organised an open-top bus parade to travel through the village.\n\nNigel recalls how he phoned a bus company to see if it was possible.\n\n\"I had a dream for this to happen. You see football teams do it after cup finals, so why not for Shelley.\n\n\"It left the train station and we could see the crowds building. There must have been thousands there,\" he added.\n\nShelley said she was in disbelief when she returned home and saw how many people had turned up to cheer her home.\n\n\"There were so many friends from school I recognised and just people I saw around the village,\" she said.\n\nShe added that she will always feel grateful to those that supported her and the strong community that Pewsey still has today.\n\n\"It is just stunning around here, there's a great community spirit. I always appreciate what they did for me,\" she added.\n\nFollow BBC Wiltshire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "fullText": "“It makes me sad that women’s football is sexualised and disrespected,” read Liverpool midfielder Marie Hobinger’s victim statement. “No woman, no matter her job, should have to put up with this type of behaviour.”\n\nMangal Dalal, 42, contacted Hobinger, 24, via social media before waiting for her at the side of the pitch after Liverpool’s away game against Manchester City in February 2025. He was handed a two-year restraining order and sentenced to 18 months of community service in January after pleading guilty to stalking the Austria international.\n\nThis is only one example that highlights the growing concerns around the safety of Women’s Super League (WSL) footballers. “There is that fear among players that it could happen to anyone,” Fern Whelan, women’s football equality, diversity and inclusion executive for the Professional Footballers’ Association, tells The Athletic.\n\nDuring the 2025 European Championship, England and Gotham defender Jess Carter spoke out about the racist abuse she received on the internet, later telling the BBC she feared leaving the team hotel. A 60-year-old man pleaded guilty to malicious communications in January. Mark Roberts, the national lead for football policing, called the comments “appalling”.\n\nAt the 2023 World Cup in Australia and New Zealand, when England reached the final, the Lionesses received fan mail from Australia that contained death threats. The UK football policing unit (UKFPU) conducted a joint investigation, including forensics, with Australian police, but as yet, nobody has been charged.\n\nIn January, Arsenal deleted a video on X and turned comments off on Instagram of new signing Smilla Holmberg promoting ticket sales because of inappropriate sexualised and misogynistic comments. Tottenham Hotspur also turned comments off on their X post announcing the arrival of Matilda Nilden, 19, for the same reason. Some of the replies asked X’s artificial intelligence tool Grok to produce sexualised images of the player.\n\nWe are delighted to announce that we have reached agreement for Matilda Nildén to join us from BK Häcken in January, 2026 ✍️\n\n🗞️ https://t.co/bLC1QvkmsS pic.twitter.com/xPUfesurS2\n\n— Tottenham Hotspur Women (@SpursWomen) December 31, 2025\n\n“It is really worrying,” says Whelan. “It’s difficult to manage unless it is stopped at source.”\n\nSome players have spoken about their fear of staying in their own homes after receiving rape and death threats online, Whelan told a Women and Equalities Committee held in the UK Parliament in October. Online abuse of women players, she said, has become “alarmingly worse” and “catapulted” since 2024 to the point where it is becoming “dangerous”.\n\nOther areas of concern for players include the control and management of access on matchdays, their safety when off duty, and the amount of contact they have with fans and the general public via social media.\n\nSome player representatives have put preventative measures in place, such as limiting the number of private drivers who can take a player home, to reduce how widely their addresses are known. Another noted that their players expressed no concern at all about their safety.\n\nThe UK’s All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on football has recently launched an inquiry into online harms across the men’s and women’s games. “We are clear that the women’s game faces some specific and heightened risks,” said Fair Game, secretariat to the Football APPG.\n\nThe Athletic has spoken to stakeholders within the game, including WSL Football, which oversees the top two tiers of women’s football in England; data science company Signify; and the PFA and the UKFPU to investigate how safe WSL players feel. The English Football Association was approached for comment, as were all WSL clubs.\n\nIn some incidents detailed below, clubs in question remain anonymous to respect the confidentiality of their security arrangements.\n\nThe message may read: “I know where you park your car”, “I know what car you drive”, or “I know where you live”. Whether genuine or not, such messages force players to judge the level of threat.\n\nWomen’s football is in a period of generational transition. The increased investment and global broadcast exposure have seen a fundamental shift in the game’s profile, especially in England, following the Lionesses’ consecutive European triumphs in 2022 and 2025. All publicity, however, is not good publicity.\n\nHistorically, women’s football has leaned into accessibility — players signing autographs, taking photos and engaging closely with supporters. As the game’s profile has grown, that openness has created tension between connection and safety.\n\n“It is becoming increasingly difficult for elite-level women’s players to embrace fan access to the same levels as has been the case historically,” says Jonathan Sebire, co-founder at Signify, which works across multiple sports and with several WSL clubs to collect, triage and assess the threat online abuse poses to players.\n\nThe majority of online abuse players receive contains sexual elements, according to Signify, including sexualised content of the individual player or their partner. Other categories of online abuse include racist and violent threats, the latter of which often contains a sexualised element. Some abuse, particularly from male online users, centres on the quality of the women’s game, but there is another concern, says Signify, that has increased far more rapidly.\n\n“One of the fundamental differences in the women’s game is there are openly gay players, some of whom are in relationships with other footballers, some of whom are at the same club,” says Sebire.\n\n“We see a large number of young women who look up to these players because of their sexuality. They’re seen as openly gay icons and role models in the sport. It starts with a level of fandom that has sometimes tipped over into fixation, infatuation and developed into something more problematic.”\n\nSuch behaviour is not exclusively linked to sexuality, but most cases known directly to Signify fall into this category.\n\nIn some rare instances, but increasing in occurrence, people have followed players around supermarkets and visited the same bars or restaurants as them. Contact can start online and move offline or vice versa. For example, players have reported people making contact via direct messages online and then seeing them appear in their local surroundings.\n\n“It’s not uncommon,” says Sebire. “If you speak to a group of players, some will almost certainly have experienced it.”\n\nSignify observes that often the behaviour does not involve physical contact or direct interaction. Instead, it centres on attempts to create the appearance of a relationship for others to see — for example, by taking selfies of themselves with players in the background. They then message players later online to suggest a personal connection.\n\n“If they’re doing that every week, that has become an infatuation,” says Sebire. “In most cases, when the club or police warn them and tell them this behaviour is problematic, it stops because they are shocked it has been noticed and received in that way.”\n\nIn other extreme cases, players have suspected a person was tracking their car’s movements, as they appeared wherever the players went. Clubs have sanctioned season-ticket holders, and law enforcement agencies have carried out risk assessments in response.\n\nThe answer, though, is not for women players to simply abstain from social media. “It is not their responsibility; they are just doing their jobs,” says Whelan.\n\nMany women’s players, after all, earn significantly more through off-field commercial deals than via playing contracts. Social media is a critical tool for connecting with fans, building personal profiles, and securing sponsorship income.\n\nIt is also far more likely that women’s players still run their own social media accounts, whereas in the men’s game, certainly among Premier League stars, others tend to manage players’ online profiles. According to Sebire, that is something that needs to and is starting to change.\n\nIt is also very different for a WSL player, who may live a relatively ‘normal’ life, to receive a threatening message than perhaps a Premier League footballer who lives in a house with significant security provisions and perhaps access to a private chef or barber. Premier League clubs also have established onboarding processes for their players, with, for example, security briefings including dedicated services for players’ properties.\n\nThat does not negate the impact of online abuse for a men’s player, but it is important context to consider, even if some WSL players are now household names.\n\n“In some clubs, the infrastructure around women’s teams’ safety is catching up with the men’s game,” says Sebire. “But it has not been universal. Those are fundamentals that have to change for women’s players to feel safe.”\n\nThe nature of the online abuse suffered by women’s players is often different, too. Unlike violent or racist abuse, it does not necessarily fit into a clearly defined category with reporting mechanisms, policies and consequences.\n\nThe Online Safety Act, fully enforced as of 2025, means OFCOM, the UK’s independent regulator for the communications industries, can take action against social media platforms, including removing content or working with law enforcement. But there are nuances to the women’s game that need to be considered.\n\nSome platforms do not recognise a lot of the abuse and threat directed at women because universal language, such as “kitchen” — referring, for example, to the misogynistic phrase ‘Get back in the kitchen’ — is repurposed or not seen as harmful without the necessary context.\n\nThe AI tool Grok is another example. X has now prevented Grok from being used to edit images of real people in revealing clothing after OFCOM launched an investigation in January. The public body Sport England decided to stop using X last month to stay true to its values of the “mission is to ensure sport and physical activity are safe and inclusive for everyone,” it said in a statement. WSL Football had already scaled back its use of X, and some WSL clubs have said they continue to monitor the situation.\n\nAnother growing pain for WSL clubs is the contrast between playing games at the women’s home grounds and the main club’s stadia.\n\nIt is easier for the club to use the same security infrastructure at a Premier League ground when their women’s team plays there, but when switching to smaller grounds, there are different security measures around the pitch, players’ entrance, or car park.\n\n“It’s safer in general to be at the Emirates,” England captain and Arsenal defender Leah Williamson told the New Statesman in December. “You’re more accessible. It’s a five-metre difference (between the players and fans).”\n\nSome players have reported concerns of being repeatedly approached by the same people outside stadiums and hassled as they approach their cars.\n\n“If players make themselves accessible signing autographs in the ground with stewards but are approached once they leave the ground, when do they say: ‘No, this isn’t appropriate?” asks one person. “That feels like an invasion of space.”\n\nSupporter interaction has become increasingly challenging as attendances have increased. WSL Football, WSL clubs and the English Football Association are trying to balance maintaining the game’s unique atmosphere and sense of community while grappling with a rapidly changing landscape.\n\nAhead of the 2024-2025 season, Chelsea changed their player access rules before and after games, citing it was “no longer safe or sustainable” for players to sign autographs or take selfies “in an uncontrolled way”. Many clubs followed suit. Some now have more organised meet-and-greets with season-ticket holders in a controlled environment, while others have close-protection officers pitchside. When on England duty, players walk around the pitch after games but do not stop and sign autographs.\n\n“It would be a shame if it got shut down to the extent that the men’s game has,” says Sebire. “But the risk is there.”\n\nClubs are taking player safety seriously, according to numerous people, and are investing to try to keep players safe. “Everybody is just trying to find a way through,” comments one observer.\n\nWSL Football’s safeguarding standards require that each “club ensures that physical and online environments promote safety and wellbeing while minimising the opportunity for children, adults at risk and players to be harmed and/or exposed to harmful or inappropriate behaviour, materials or content”.\n\nEach club undertakes its own risk assessments and all clubs in the top two leagues have a nominated police officer. WSL Football has its own safety and security working group and regularly engages with the UKFPU and clubs via monthly safety officer meetings.\n\nThe FA and several WSL clubs, including Arsenal, Chelsea, London City Lionesses, Aston Villa and Tottenham Hotspur, say they have robust security provisions and educational resources. Some employ dedicated safeguarding, player care and close-protection measures, alongside partnerships with external monitoring firms, while others have players escorted at matches and events, administer online safety training, and have formal reporting routes.\n\nThe biggest barrier to prosecution a few years ago was obtaining player statements. “With the national teams, we’ve certainly broken through that,” Chief Constable for Cheshire Police Mark Roberts tells The Athletic.\n\nNow, the UKFPU prepares players by explaining the reporting process proactively, and before tournaments, officers conduct security briefings and education sessions with the England team to offer advice regarding security and online abuse.\n\n“Don’t just delete it, try to keep it,” says Roberts. “We’ll capture it, try to identify the person, ask for a statement, and give the player support. It’s the shock of receiving something and making sure they know what to do. If you debunk the system, hopefully it makes it easier for people to come forward.”\n\nSignify has found that in some of their education sessions, players may understandably find it embarrassing to talk about their experiences, whether it’s the content of the material or that it has affected them. Often, individuals report incidents in private after group sessions.\n\n“If anything is happening in places that no one else can see, tell someone about it because you shouldn’t be dealing with this on your own,” says Sebire. “It’s not OK.”\n\nNikki Doucet, CEO of WSL Football, has spoken with Meta’s global head of safety and the Women’s National Basketball Association about the tools they use. She recently met at UK Parliament with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport’s Women’s Sport Taskforce, hosted by minister Stephanie Peacock, alongside representatives from OFCOM, the police, and other sports leaders to discuss protections for sportswomen online.\n\n“It is top of the PFA’s agenda, including pushing the clubs to see how we can protect the players better,” says Whelan, adding that online abuse is a “massive barrier” to participation for many young girls and parents.\n\n“It is not football that is the problem; it is the perpetrators behind it all,” she adds. “We have to make sure the people who are looking after the footballers are taking it really seriously. I would hate for it to come to a point where those threats become reality, and then we act.\n\n“Everyone is working hard behind the scenes to find a solution. Clubs are aware of the concerns the players have raised. There is a real shift; players are not going to stand for this. The more we see perpetrators held to account, the more they are emboldened.”\n\nAdditional reporting: Philip Buckingham\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Athletic.\n\nArsenal, Chelsea, Manchester City, England, Women's Soccer, Culture\n\n2026 The Athletic Media Company",

    "description": "The Cowboys were rumored to be part of the NFL's international games in 2026, and that has proven to be true.",
    "fullText": "In 2026, the Dallas Cowboys will be among the teams taking part in the NFL's international games.\n\nWith the thought that the Cowboys could head down under to Australia and even to Mexico after Jerry Jones made it clear he would be interested in such a move, Dallas now knows where it will be heading in 2026.\n\nIt will be the first time the Cowboys have played an international game since 2014, and coach Brian Schottenheimer's team is off to Rio de Janeiro in 2026.\n\nWe don't know who their opponents will be, but it will no doubt be a huge draw given the Cowboys are involved.\n\nAfter a failed 2025 season, the Cowboys will now look towards the 2026 season as one where they can mount a bounce-back and make the playoffs for the first time in three seasons.\n\nAnd playing in Brazil will certainly have its perks.\n\nMost of all, the marketing side, which we know Jerry and the Cowboys will eat up.\n\nSchottenheimer will lead his Cowboys to a place they've never played an NFL game before, nor the NFL, as Maracanã Stadium will host the game, with the previous outings in Brazil being played in São Paulo, so it will be another career first for the head coach.\n\nWhat is rather interesting about the Cowboys playing in Brazil is that, as we understand it, it will be a home game at AT&T Stadium, and so the franchise is giving up the revenue that goes with that.\n\nBut of course, there are riches to be mined internationally, too.\n\nReportedly, the Cowboys' potential opponents for the game are the Buccaneers, Titans, Jaguars, Niners, Cardinals, and Ravens.\n\nThat is, providing the NFL doesn't make it an NFC East showdown, which does seem highly unlikely, but you never know in the NFL.\n\nSo there will be a lot to monitor over the coming weeks and months, as the Cowboys go international for the first time in over a decade, with Schottenheimer's new-look Dallas team leading the way.\n\nThe Ravens loom as a good opponent for the Cowboys, as do the 49ers, but they are already heading to Australia to face the Los Angeles Rams.\n\nEither way, the Cowboys are going to be part of the international series, and that's exciting.",

I'm happy I win the round and also, he is my idol. I want him going to the final, win the championship, and I want him doing well,\" Xiao told the World Snooker Tour.\n\n\"But it's sport. When I play anyone, I don't want to lose. I feel sorry for Ronnie but we are still very good friends.\"\n\nXiao will face Pang Junxu, who beat Si Jiahui 5-3, in the last eight.\n\nMenwhile, China's world champion Zhao Xintong emerged as a 5-4 winner following a closely contested match against Mark Selby.\n\nEngland's Selby, a four-time world champion, knocked in breaks of 90, 109, 73 and 56 on the way to taking a 4-1 lead.\n\nHowever, Zhao fought back with runs of 81, 140 and 112 to level and then took the decider to set up a last-eight tie against Chris Wakelin, who beat Elliot Slessor 5-4.\n\n\"Mark played very well up to 4-1,\" said Zhao. \"In the last few frames if thought that if I lose, I need to lose like the world champion.\n\n\"But I can't believe I won the last four frames. It was very important for me, I am so proud of myself and hopefully I can still get better. I like playing the legend players because it's a chance to prove I am strong.\"\n\nBarry Hawkins, the 2017 champion, was also defeated in the second round, losing 5-3 to Zhang Anda.\n\nAlthough Hawkins levelled at 3-3 after being 3-1 down, Zhang responded with breaks of 82 and 97 to complete the win and will play Wu Yize, who beat Chang Bingyu 5-3, in the quarter-finals.\n\nThe other last-eight tie will be between Ali Carter, who was a 5-2 winner against Yuan Sijun, and Zhou Yuelong, who beat Jak Jones 5-1.\n\nThere are six Chinese players in the quarter-finals, a new record for a ranking event.

    "fullText": "Global warming means the future of Winter Games “is literally melting away.”\n\nSome of the world’s greatest winter sports athletes have called on the International Olympics Committee to stop taking fossil fuel industry money, including from Italian oil giant ENI, a “Premium Partner” of the 2026 Winter Olympics. “The time has come to question the ethical implications of…normalizing the connections between our sports and the detrimental effects of the product that [fossil fuel companies] sell,” reads a petition delivered yesterday to IOC officials in Milan, Italy, where the Games’ opening ceremony takes place on Friday.\n\nBurning oil, gas, coal, and other fossil fuels is the main driver of global warming, which is raising winter temperatures and reducing the snow cover that skiing and other winter sports require. Winters are rapidly warming across much of the Northern Hemisphere, threatening not only the Olympics but also communities economically and culturally dependent on skiing and other winter recreational activities.\n\nTo date, the petition to the IOC and the International Ski and Snowboard Federation has attracted more than 20,000 signatories, including Alex Hall of the US, who won the Olympic gold medal in freestyle skiing at the 2022 Winter Games; Helvig Wessel of Norway, the 2024 Freeride World Tour skiing champion; and Nikolai Schirmer, also of Norway, whose nonprofit Ski Fossil Free organized the petition and hand-delivered it to IOC officials on February 4; a full list of signatories is available here.\n\nAlthough neither the IOC nor ENI have yet commented on the petition, the IOC did purchase 2.4 million cubic meters of artificial snow to enable reliable conditions for events taking place in the Italian Alps town of Cortina d’Ampezzo. ENI, which has said it aims to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, announced in December that “90% of the fuels that Eni…will supply to power the Games will be derived from renewable feedstocks.”\n\nFebruary temperatures have warmed by 3.6 degrees Celsius (6.4 degrees Fahrenheit) over the 70 years since Cortina hosted the first Winter Olympics in 1956, according to new research from the scientific nonprofit Climate Central. Cortina now experiences 41 fewer freezing days per year than it did in 1956. Globally, only half of the locations deemed suitable for future Winter Olympics will have reliably cold temperatures by the year 2050, Climate Central found. “Unless we address human-caused climate change and the fossil fuel burning that we’re doing, the possibility of having Winter Olympics is literally melting away,” Kaitlyn Trudeau, a Climate Central scientist who conducted the research, said at a press briefing on January 28 cohosted by Climate Central and Covering Climate Now.\n\n“People in my community aren’t discussing whether or not climate change is real.… it’s very, very apparent when we look at the high mountains,” said Graham Zimmerman, a professional alpinist and director of athletic alliance for the nonprofit Protect Our Winters, which supported the petition drive. Zimmerman and a team were 7,000 meters (23,000 feet) up Pakistan’s K-2, the second-highest peak in the world, when melting snow and ice forced them to shelter in place on a narrow ledge for 14 hours. “It’s an altitude where, generally speaking, you are putting on all of the puffy clothes to stay warm,” he said. “Instead, we found ourselves in temperatures of 42 degrees [F] in the shade, having to take shelter from avalanches and rock fall because the mountain was literally falling apart.”\n\nAlthough amateur climbers, skiers, and snowboarders are not immune to such dangers, the greater risk for them is simply fewer opportunities to enjoy their favorite winter sports. “Climate Central data shows a steady decline in snowfall at nearly two-thirds of monitoring stations” in the United States, Ben Tracy, a climate journalist on assignment for Climate Central, said in a TV report shown during the briefing (and available for TV stations to air free of charge). “For the ski industry, that meltdown means billions in lost revenue.” A resort Tracy visited in Idaho that normally would have 42 ski runs open had only one—and that one was open only because of costly artificial snow.\n\nThat winters are rapidly warming even as bitter cold grips much of the US at the moment may seem counterintuitive to some people (including the nation’s climate-denier in chief), but scientists explain that weather is not the same thing as climate. “In a warming world we’re still going to have cold snaps, they’ll just be less frequent,” Trudeau said. A good way to think about it, she added, is that “weather is [the clothes] you’re wearing today. Climate is the clothes you have in your closet.”\n\nThe unreliability of winters on a warming planet leads Rocky Anderson, the former mayor of Salt Lake City, Utah, to emphasize the urgency of phasing out fossil fuels. Anderson was the mayor when Salt Lake City hosted the 2002 Games, a role it is scheduled to repeat in 2034. But during his interview with Tracy, he pointed to the majestic peaks east of the city and noted, “There’s almost no snow anywhere in those mountains,” adding, “I don’t think we’re going to see a Winter Olympic Games in Utah in 2034.”\n\nFrom Minneapolis to Venezuela, from Gaza to Washington, DC, this is a time of staggering chaos, cruelty, and violence.\n\nUnlike other publications that parrot the views of authoritarians, billionaires, and corporations, The Nation publishes stories that hold the powerful to account and center the communities too often denied a voice in the national media—stories like the one you’ve just read.\n\nEach day, our journalism cuts through lies and distortions, contextualizes the developments reshaping politics around the globe, and advances progressive ideas that oxygenate our movements and instigate change in the halls of power.\n\nThis independent journalism is only possible with the support of our readers.

For the first five years of his career, Urquidy was a valuable depth piece for an Astros team that went to three World Series in four years. His best season came in 2022 when he went 13-8 with a 3.94 ERA in 164.1 innings. In 2023, Urquidy developed an elbow injury that required Tommy John surgery. He last pitched for the Astros on September 29 of that season.\n\nAfter spending the 2024 season on the sidelines, Erquidy signed with the Detroit Tigers for the 2025 campaign. He only made two appearances for the team, posting a 7.71 ERA. The 30-year-old right-hander has some work to do to get back to where he was, but perhaps a fresh start in Pittsburgh could help him achieve those goals.\n\nBD community, what do you think of the signing of Urquidy?

    "description": "How does the Framber Valdez signing impact the Detroit Tigers' plans for Tarik Skubal in 2026, and the pursuit of a World Series ring?",
    "fullText": "It has been a busy past few days for the Detroit Tigers.\n\nThey made a surprising move Wednesday night in MLB free agency, signing lefty starter Framber Valdez to a three-year, $115 million deal. The move gives the Tigers the best chance to win the American League Central Division (per FanGraphs), and pairs a top-end starter with the two-time, reigning AL Cy Young Award winner Tarik Skubal.\n\nSpeaking of Skubal, he had his arbitration hearing earlier Wednesday. We await the final ruling, but it may determine whether the Tigers can continue adding to their roster a few weeks before the Tigers' spring training exhibition schedule begins.\n\nHere's a quick rundown of Detroit's busy week, how much the Tigers have improved and where they can go in the future.\n\nMORE: Does Tigers' big swing on Framber Valdez change narrative about team?\n\nUnless the Tigers make another unexpected move in signing their ace to a long-term deal, Skubal will be making less money than Valdez in 2026. How much less is still a mystery, however.\n\nThe Tigers and Skubal underwent a salary arbitration hearing yesterday, with a three-person panel's decision on Skubal's 2026 salary expected to be released today.\n\nPlayers entering their fourth year of MLB service are eligible for salary arbitration if he and his team cannot agree on a contract for the upcoming season. Through arbitration, the team and player each submit a salary they believe the player should be paid, and a three-person panel (generally made up of legal professionals who work outside of baseball) decides whether the player is worth more or less than the midway point of each filing.\n\n[ MUST LISTEN: Make \"Days of Roar\" your go-to Tigers podcast, available anywhere you listen to podcasts (Apple, Spotify) ]\n\nSound complicated? Let's use an example Tigers fans are paying close attention to.\n\nThe Tigers submitted a $19 million salary in Skubal's arbitration, while Skubal filed at $32 million. That means that if the panel decides Skubal is worth more than $25.5 million in 2026 (the midway point of each filing), he will win his case and earn an arbitration record-breaking $32 million salary. Conversely, if the panel decides Skubal is worth less than $25.5 million for the upcoming season, the Tigers will win the case and pay Skubal $19 million.\n\nThe Tigers and Skubal can still agree to a long-term deal following the arbitration decision, but the likelihood of that happening is low with Skubal's agent Scott Boras traditionally taking his clients to free agency instead of signing long-term deals beforehand.\n\nNo matter how the decision shakes out, however, Skubal's salary in 2026 will fall below Valdez's $38.3 million in average annual value (with Skubal likely eclipsing that figure when he signs a long-term deal of his own).\n\nThere has been some speculation that Valdez is a top-of-the-rotation replacement for Skubal, but The Athletic's Ken Rosenthal has already reported that the Tigers plan on keeping Skubal for 2026 in a win-now move.\n\n\"One rival executive, granted anonymity for his candor, speculated Wednesday night that a potential trade partner for the Tigers might want to see what Skubal gets in arbitration before finalizing its proposed blockbuster. But really, what are we talking about? If the Tigers traded Skubal after signing Valdez, their fans would be perfectly justified marching on Comerica Park in a massive protest,\" he wrote.\n\nThat means that Tigers fans can breathe easily, for now, and look forward to Skubal and Valdez at the top of the rotation for 2026. Whether Skubal returns to the Tigers in 2027, however, is still yet to be determined.\n\nBefore Wednesday, the Tigers had made few notable offseason transactions in comparison to AL rivals like the Toronto Blue Jays and Boston Red Sox, whose odds to win the AL pennant are currently higher than those of the Tigers per BetMGM. The Tigers also entered the offseason with an urgent need to improve with only one guaranteed year left of Skubal in a Tigers uniform.\n\nThe Valdez signing in theory primarily does two things: It immediately makes the Tigers starting rotation one of the most formidable in the AL and signals to fans that the organization is serious about competing for the World Series in 2026.\n\nThe Tigers can also benefit from high-level pitching from Valdez without needing to commit to a long-term contract. The three-year deal Valdez signed with the Tigers could become a two-year deal if his opt-out is exercised after the 2027 season, turning a nine-figure deal into a much cheaper eight-figure deal for a Tigers front office with a reputation of avoiding big-money contracts. That means that even if the Valdez signing doesn't work out for Detroit (or if the Tigers need to reset without Skubal in 2027), he'll be off the books soon after and give the front office more room to work with.\n\nValdez hasn't commanded the same sort of attention recently as other AL stalwarts like Skubal, Boston's Garrett Crochet or New York's Gerrit Cole, never finishing higher than fifth in the AL Cy Young Award vote. But his steady success has made him one of MLB's most valuable pitchers over the last five seasons and fits very well with what the Tigers need.\n\nValdez's 18.3 FanGraphs WAR since 2021 is second among AL pitchers to Skubal, while his 3.20 ERA in the same span is third behind Skubal (2.96) and Yankees ace Gerrit Cole (3.15) among AL starters with at least 500 innings pitched in the same span. Valdez's 60 games of at least seven innings pitched since 2021 also leads all pitchers (Skubal, by comparison, has 30 in the same time frame), while his six complete games since 2021 is second in MLB behind Miami Marlins ace Sandy Alcantara's 10.\n\nValdez likely won't compete with Skubal for the top spot in the Tigers rotation, but he might be the best No. 2 pitcher in the AL heading into 2026 and a worthy ace should the Tigers miss Skubal for any reason in 2026 or 2027.\n\nNeed to catch up on the news during your lunch break? \n\nYou can reach Christian at cromo@freepress.com.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Detroit Free Press: Tarik Skubal arbitration, Tigers future after Framber Valdez signing",

Per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, he is worth $668 billion. The second-richest person in the world, Larry Page, is worth $285 billion.\n\nMusk's wealth has soared by $49 billion since the start of the year, buoyed by SpaceX's high valuation and news of its merger with his AI startup, XAI.\n\nStudies show that money does bring happiness, but there could be a limit for the ultrawealthy.\n\nDavid Bartram, an associate professor of sociology at the University of Leicester, told Business Insider that while wealth and happiness are linked, \"It's very much a matter of 'diminishing returns.'\"\n\n\"Once you've got a few million, anything extra is meaningless for happiness,\" he said.\n\nBartram said for the very wealthy, \"happiness is probably best achieved by having a sense that you've done some good in the world, and that you've treated people around you with care and kindness. It's not exactly rocket science.\"\n\nA 2021 study by Matthew Killingsworth, a senior fellow at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, found that happiness and feelings of well-being increased in tandem with a person's rising income.\n\nHowever, the amount of money needed for happiness becomes an exponentially moving goalpost, Killingsworth concluded in a 2024 paper.\n\nWhile the data he analyzed did not examine what millionaires or billionaires are experiencing, Killingsworth said it was \"plausible\" that the pattern would continue among the world's wealthiest.\n\nMusk discussed the relationship between happiness and wealth in a recent conversation with Nikhil Kamath on the \"People by WTF\" podcast.\n\n\"Aim to make more than you take. Be a net contributor to society,\" Musk said in November.\n\n\"It's kind of like the pursuit of happiness. You know, if you want to create something valuable financially, you don't pursue that. It's best to actually pursue providing useful products and services. If you do that, then money will come as a natural consequence, as opposed to pursuing money directly,\" he added.",

    "fullText": "The USS Massachusetts fired America's first 16-inch shell of World War II. It also fired the last.\n\nIn 1942, the 680-foot battleship fired the first US 16-inch projectile of the war in combat with French forces off the coast of Casablanca, Morocco, as part of Operation Torch. Three years later, the USS Massachusetts fired the last 16-inch projectile of World War II against Japanese forces in the final naval bombardment in Kamaishi, Honshu, Japan.\n\nAfter the war, the decorated battleship was decommissioned and destined to become scrap metal until its former crew members stepped in to raise the funds to save it.\n\nIn 1965, the USS Massachusetts opened to the public as a museum and war memorial in the very state it was named for.\n\n\"The most important function here is that we serve to honor veterans and active duty personnel,\" Christopher Nardi, Battleship Cove's chief operating officer, told Business Insider.\n\nTake a look inside the USS Massachusetts.\n\nThe USS Massachusetts was one of four battleships built as part of the South Dakota class, which was designed to be more compact than previous battleship classes.\n\nI visited Battleship Cove in January, when the museum operates with limited winter hours due to the frigid temperatures on board the ships. The full list of hours of operation can be found on Battleship Cove's website.\n\nGeneral admission costs $25 per adult.\n\nThe ship weighed 44,519 tons when fully loaded for combat.\n\nThe Below Deck tour takes visitors through the inner workings of the ship's technology, including the engine room, the gun plotting and handling rooms, and the radio room.\n\nThe World War II-focused tour features historical exhibits about the war as a whole and spotlights some of the battle damage the ship endured.\n\nThe Crew tour brings visitors through spaces that were part of the sailors' daily life on board, such as their bunks, galley, and laundry room.\n\nThe Topside tour explores the deck of the ship, including its many guns.\n\nColor-coded arrows direct visitors along each of the routes.\n\nThe ship has a total of nine 16-inch, 45-caliber Mark 6 guns: two three-gun turrets at the front of the ship (\"forward\") and one three-gun turret at the back (\"aft\"). They could hit targets up to 23 miles away.\n\nThe 16-inch measurement refers to the bore diameter, or the size of the hole that the shell is fired through. The cannons themselves are over 60 feet long.\n\nThe Bofors 40-millimeter guns featured a range of 6.25 miles and could fire between 120 and 160 rounds per minute.\n\nAt the height of World War II, the USS Massachusetts was outfitted with 72 40-millimeter guns.\n\nThe 20-millimeter Oerlikon autocannons featured a range of 2.75 miles.\n\nSome of the ship's 5-inch guns still work and are used for ceremonial gun salutes.\n\nIf you look closely, you can see the seagull that decided to perch on one of the guns when I visited.\n\nEach nautical flag represents a letter or signal. For example, the flag representing the letter \"O\" can also mean \"man overboard.\"\n\nCrew members opened and closed the light's shutter to send messages in Morse code.\n\nWhen the ship was deployed, officers would have eaten their meals here off fine china.\n\nThe wardroom still features tables and seating for large groups.\n\nIn addition to functioning as a museum, Battleship Cove is the official World War II memorial for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.\n\nDuring World War II, the crew of the USS Massachusetts grew from its normal number of 1,793 enlisted men to 2,500. When the berthing rooms were full, the ship set up hammocks in other areas.\n\nOfficers were in charge of censoring crew members' letters to their loved ones, blacking out information like their location or even the weather.\n\nDuring the war, maintenance had to be performed while the ship was in the middle of the ocean.\n\nToday, museum volunteers use 3D printers to create replacement parts.\n\nThe galley prepared four meals per day: breakfast, lunch, dinner, and midnight rations known as \"mid-rats.\"\n\nSailors labeled every item of their clothing, but some items still ended up in the lost-and-found, known as the \"lucky bag.\"\n\nIn the brig, sailors received only bread and water for meals.\n\nDuring the Battle of Casablanca in 1942, an 8-inch projectile hit the main deck and exploded in a bunk room. No one was injured since all of the sailors were at their battle stations, but the ship sustained damage from the shrapnel.\n\nThe holes have since been repaired, but red outlines on the walls show where they once were.\n\nThe sick bay treated battle wounds as well as everyday ailments such as ear infections or athlete's foot.\n\nOn Iowa-class battleships like the USS New Jersey, Broadway is the longest, straightest passageway on the ship. On South Dakota-class battleships like the USS Massachusetts, Broadway is thinner and not built in a straight line since the class was designed to be more compact.\n\nGunner's mates loaded shells and powder cases into the hoists, which moved them up to the upper handling room and then up to the gun mounts.\n\nSix powder bags were required to fire one 16-inch projectile.\n\nThe USS Massachusetts could hold over 1,200 projectiles.\n\nA device called a Mark 8 Rangekeeper computed where to aim the 16-inch guns based on factors such as the ship's course and speed and the direction of the wind.\n\nIn order to work in the distribution room, an electrician had to pass a test showing that he could get from his bunk to the distribution room and identify any circuit while blindfolded.\n\nRadiomen were responsible for typing messages and passing them to supervisors.\n\nNardi told Business Insider that the equipment in radio central is still operational thanks to the work of volunteers who continue to maintain it.\n\nCanvas bags with lead bottoms were kept in the code room just in case any top-secret information had to be thrown overboard if the ship was compromised.\n\nEven with a map of the ship and color-coded arrows pointing the way, touring the USS Massachusetts was a dizzying experience full of ladders, hatches, and tight corners. On a battleship that big, there's an endless amount of history to learn.\n\nNardi told me that touring historic battleships like the USS Massachusetts can provide insight into how modern Navy ships operate.\n\nBasic navigational equipment looks and works largely the same as it did on World War II battleships, Nardi said. Some communication devices, such as sound-powered telephones that harness the electricity generated by the user's voice, are also still widely used.\n\n\"I hear Navy personnel come on board and say, 'Oh, that hasn't changed much,'\" Nardi said.\n\nIn December, Trump announced a new \"Trump-class\" of ships, referring to them as \"battleships,\" as part of his plan for the US Navy's new \"Golden Fleet\" to reinvigorate American shipbuilding. White House deputy press secretary Anna Kelly previously told Business Insider that Trump is \"prioritizing this vital industry to strengthen our country's economic and national security.\"\n\nHowever, the Trump-class ships would not technically qualify as battleships. To earn that title, they would have to be the largest, most heavily armored ships with the largest guns relative to other ships.\n\n\"The word 'battleship' can be used very generically, which is not accurate. We don't have them anymore, and President Trump's not going to build battleships. He's calling them that, but a battleship is what we have over here,\" Nardi said, gesturing at the USS Massachusetts floating in the Taunton River. \"That's a real battleship.\"",

    "fullText": "Not everyone in finance and tech is sold on the idea that AI is going to kill the software business.\n\nWall Street's fears of AI-related disruption has been driving a sell-off of software stocks after the release of Anthropic's new industry-specific plug-in.\n\nFrom Nvidia's CEO dismissing the concerns, to Zoho's founder acknolweding the industry is \"ripe for consolidation,\" here's what leaders in tech and finance are saying:\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang said software is a tool for AI to use, rather than replace.\n\n\"There's this notion that the tool industry is in decline and will be replaced by AI,\" Huang said during a recent Cisco AI event. \"You could tell because there's a whole bunch of software companies whose stock prices are under a lot of pressure because somehow AI is going to replace them. It is the most illogical thing in the world and time will prove itself.\"\n\nHuang named ServiceNow, SAP, Cadence, and Synopsis, as bright spots in the industry.\n\nSridhar Vembu, founder of Zoho, a cloud-based software company, said SaaS was \"ripe for consolidation\" long before the rise of AI.\n\n\"An industry that spends vastly more on sales and marketing than on engineering and product development was always vulnerable,\" he wrote on X. \"The venture capital bubble and then the stock market bubble funded a fundamentally flawed, unsustainable model for too long. AI is the pin that is popping this inflated balloon.\"\n\nVembu said he asks his employees to consider the possibility of the company's death.\n\n\"When we accept that possibility, we become more fearless and that is when we can calmly chart our course.\"\n\nSteven Sinofsky, who helped lead the development of Windows 7 and 8, said AI may change \"what we built and who builds it,\" but tales of software's demise are just \"nonsense.\"\n\n\"Wall Street is filled with investors of all types. There's also a community, and they tend to run in herds. The past couple of weeks have definitely seen the herd collectively conclude that somehow software is dead. That the idea of a software pure play will just vanish into some language model,\" Sinofsky wrote in a lengthy post on X. \"Nonsense.\"\n\nSinofsky said it is true some companies will fail. He also noted that such cycles have happened in retail and media.\n\n\"Strap in,\" he wrote. \"This is the most exciting time for business and technology, ever.\"\n\nArm CEO Rene Haas isn't panicking.\n\n\"As I look at enterprise AI deployment, we aren't anywhere close to where it can be,\" Haas told the Financial Times.\n\nHaas, who leads the SoftBank-owned semiconductor company, said the current market reaction is \"micro-hysteria.\"\n\nJPMorgan analyst Stephen Parker said investors shouldn't be too worried by the sell-off.\n\n\"We're seeing a rotation,\" Parker told CNBC. \"It's about a broadening of the recovery story. Cyclicals are picking up the slack, and it's not just the AI infrastructure plays and the hyperscalers that are driving markets higher.\"\n\nParker, the co-head of global investment strategy at JPMorgan Private Bank, said AI developments are likely to continue to cause disruption in the software industry.",

    "fullText": "Hull KR's treble-winning head coach Willie Peters says he is \"keen\" to have talks about taking charge of England for this year's Rugby League World Cup.\n\nThe Australian, 46, is among the contenders to succeed Shaun Wane, who stepped down on 14 January.\n\nPeters led Rovers to their first Super League Grand Final triumph last October, along with the League Leaders' Shield and the Challenge Cup.\n\nHe then joined up with the Australia squad for the Rugby League Ashes series as an assistant to head coach Kevin Walters, helping them to a 3-0 series win over England.\n\nPeters told BBC Sport: \"I'd be keen to have discussions if and when that arose. It'd be a privilege to coach England, that's for sure.\"\n\nFormer Wigan coach Wane, 61, stepped down after just under six years in the role, having led England to a World Cup semi-final in 2022.\n\nWane worked on a full-time basis but the Rugby Football League has said the role is \"expected to revert to a part-time position\".\n\nAsked if he had been approached regarding the role, Peters said: \"No, I haven't spoken to anyone yet.\n\n\"It's a job that many, many people would be interested in and whoever coaches England will have a squad that competes very hard. They show a lot of passion and effort, that's what an England team does.\n\n\"Shaun did that, got them firing in terms of effort and competing.\n\n\"There are probably a few different areas that they need to work on. As I've said openly, the spine is probably an area that needs focus but they're not too far away.\"\n\nThe 2026 World Cup will be staged in Australia, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea between 15 October and 15 November.\n\nAll of England's matches will be in Australia, with their opener against Tonga in Perth on Saturday, 17 October.\n\nWarrington skipper Williams to leave at end of 2026\n\nEngland head coach Wane steps down in World Cup year\n\nWigan's Matt Peet has ruled himself out of the running.\n\n\"It's not in my thoughts, no,\" he told BBC Sport. \"It's not something I'm interested in doing in the short term. Maybe one day - but now my focus is 100% on Wigan and my family for the next few years.\"\n\nEngland captain George Williams, who announced on Tuesday that he will leave Warrington at the end of 2026 to move to the NRL, said that Wane's replacement needs to bring \"passion\" to the job.\n\nWilliams, who is widely expected to link up with England team-mates Herbie Farnworth and Morgan Knowles at the Dolphins, said: \"I was disappointed that Waney lost his job and I think a lot of players would say the same thing.\n\n\"Whoever comes in, I'm sure they're passionate and keen to get us moving forward.\n\n\"If you're coaching England, you're going to be good at your job. That's automatic. But I think the passion is a big one.\n\n\"You're getting an elite group of players that pretty much half-coaches itself. It's probably now about bringing some passion and some drive behind the team.\"",

    "description": "The story of Afghan refugee Zainullah Ihsan, who is going to the T20 World Cup with Scotland three years after his first net session.",
    "fullText": "Three-and-a-half years ago, a teenager peered over a fence on Glasgow's Crow Road and told those training at GHK Cricket Club: \"I like cricket\".\n\nZainullah Ihsan had only ever played tapeball cricket - which uses a tennis ball tightly wrapped in electrical tape - in the park at that point.\n\nHowever after 10 minutes of his first GHK net session, more people were watching the young tearaway than were following the match taking place on the adjacent ground.\n\nNow, the 19-year-old is part of Scotland's squad for the T20 World Cup in India.\n\nHis story is remarkable, a tale of hardship and strength that started with him leaving Afghanistan as a 13-year-old before crossing Asia and Europe to join his older brother in Scotland two years later.\n\nIt is striking how grounded the seamer is, given his age, and he is determined to make the most of the opportunity before him.\n\nThe word 'kismet' was mentioned to me by those who know him best. It literally translates as 'luck' or 'fate', but carries more weight than that. It is the idea that certain things are meant to be and that the stars align to make it happen.\n\nIhsan missed the cut-off to qualify for the Under-19 World Cup that is taking place in Zimbabwe, but his absence there opened the door for him to travel with the senior team to India after Scotland's own late call-up.\n\n\"When Bangladesh boycotted the World Cup, I kept my eyes on my phone - all day it was in my hand and then [head coach] Owen Dawkins called me,\" Ihsan recalls about his selection.\n\n\"He said 'congratulations' and I can't explain how I felt, I was very excited.\n\n\"It was a surprise. My first selection. Every cricketer dreams to play in a World Cup and I didn't expect it.\n\n\"Straight away I called my older brother. I spoke to my Mum and Dad back in Afghanistan too. They are very excited.\"\n\nScotland pick uncapped Ihsan in World Cup squad\n\nNo sponsor, kit on order & visa wait - Scotland embrace late World Cup call\n\nICC Men's T20 World Cup - everything you need to know\n\nHis dramatic rise to full international honours has been swift, but has not been without its challenges.\n\nAs an unaccompanied refugee, Ihsan was supported by Aberlour Children's Charity through a service called Guardianship Scotland.\n\nGHK members also helped him get to training and matches around the country, while also providing him with the necessary kit.\n\nIt is not just Ihsan either. A number of children housed all over Scotland have found cricket clubs thanks to Guardianship Scotland, with many of them viewing Ihsan as a role model.\n\nAnd yet, apart from his brother, his family were unaware of his rising stock.\n\nFor many who settle in the United Kingdom from the Asian subcontinent, there is a responsibility on them to financially support family back home.\n\nIhsan played regional cricket and represented Scotland Under-17s off the back of impressive performances for GHK, but it was not until he played for Scotland A last year that he told his parents about his achievements.\n\n\"I told my parents just that I'm studying,\" he said. \"After I was selected for the A team I told my Mum and Dad and they told me to work hard and go for my dreams.\n\n\"I have the biggest dreams. The first dream was to be selected and now the dreams are higher, to be one of the top bowlers in the world and play in leagues around the world.\"\n\nLive ball-by-ball commentary of every match on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra, BBC Sounds and the BBC Sport website and app, plus live texts with in-play clips and highlights.\n\nThroughout our interview, Ihsan kept coming back to his determination to do his best and leave no stone unturned.\n\nThere is no arrogance about him, just a steely confidence and a drive that is built into his psyche.\n\nIhsan, along with team-mate Safyaan Sharif, received their visas after the rest of the travelling Scotland party and so were unable to play in the Scots' first warm-up match against Afghanistan.\n\nDespite that disappointment, he still took the opportunity to pick the brains of Hamid Hassan - former Afghanistan opening bowler and now coach - and one of the sport's most experienced campaigners in Mohammad Nabi.\n\nGlobal superstar Rashid Khan also came over for a chat before the game.\n\nThese are some of Ihsan's heroes, but there are no split loyalties.\n\n\"Scotland gave me respect and believed in me,\" he said. \"I was born in Afghanistan but my country is Scotland.\"\n\nHe experienced his first taste of international cricket on Wednesday, taking 1-49 as Scotland were narrowly beaten by Namibia in a high-scoring game.\n\nThe teams then played a practice super over, with Ihsan trusted to bowl for Scotland.\n\n\"He's got decent pace, he's able to deliver a yorker, slower balls and a bouncer, which in T20s are good commodities to have,\" assistant coach Gordon Drummond said.\n\n\"He played his first game and it showed if you're off the mark a little bit you can get punished. The more experience he has, the more he will develop.\n\n\"He's going to learn a lot from the guys we've got out here and he really enjoyed having conversations with the Afghanistan players the other day.\n\n\"He's quite a grounded individual and the really nice thing from [the Namibia game] was he came off the park and was annoyed at how he bowled. That shows how much character he has and his willingness to learn.\n\n\"We can't predict the future, but there's not been a huge amount of input from Cricket Scotland staff.

    "title": "‘Saving for Retirement Will be Irrelevant’: Elon Musk Says Unless You’re Retiring In the Next Decade, ‘Squirreling Money’ is Pointless",
    "description": "In a recent interview, Elon Musk says that in a world of mass-produced AI and robotics, money and saving for retirement will be pointless.",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk is now openly questioning whether saving for retirement will even make sense in the future, and he’s tying that view directly to how fast he believes AI and robotics will dismantle today’s labor market.\n\nIn a wide-ranging discussion about artificial intelligence (AI) and automation, Tesla (TSLA) and SpaceX/xAI CEO Musk laid out a timeline that would upend decades of economic assumptions. In his view, the first wave is already underway: white-collar work. Lawyers, accountants, analysts, marketers, coders, and other jobs long considered “safe” because they were cognitive rather than physical, are, he argues, the most immediately vulnerable to AI systems that can reason, write, analyze, and iterate at superhuman speed.\n\nNvidia May Not Invest $100 Billion in OpenAI After All. Is That a Bad Sign for NVDA Stock?\n\nA Potential Sentiment Mismatch Makes Rocket Lab (RKLB) Stock Options an Enticing Proposition\n\nWhy Needham Warns That Meta Platforms Stock Could Be Headed for 10%-15% Downside\n\nGet exclusive insights with the FREE Barchart Brief newsletter. \n\nBlue-collar work comes next. Musk believes humanoid robots, paired with increasingly capable AI models, will replace much of physical labor shortly after. Manufacturing, logistics, construction, and even service work would eventually follow. His estimate for this transition is strikingly aggressive: three to seven years.\n\nThe end result, Musk argues, isn’t mass deprivation, but abundance. If AI and robots can produce goods and services at near-zero marginal cost, then scarcity collapses. Food, housing, transportation, energy, and manufactured goods all become dramatically cheaper. Productivity explodes, not because humans are working harder, but because machines are doing nearly all of the work.\n\nThat’s where Musk’s idea of “universal high income” comes in, a phrase he’s used before to distinguish his view from traditional universal basic income. This isn’t a modest government stipend meant to keep people afloat. It’s a world where the cost of living drops so sharply that most people can afford a high standard of living regardless of whether they hold a conventional job.\n\nIn that context, he made a statement that cuts directly against decades of financial planning orthodoxy.\n\n“One side recommendation I have,” Musk said, “is don’t worry about squirreling money away for retirement in 10 or 20 years. It won’t matter. You won’t need to save for retirement. If any of the things we’ve said are true, saving for retirement will be irrelevant.”",

    "fullText": "The World Anti-Doping Agency could investigate if evidence emerges that male ski jumpers are injecting their penises in a bid to improve sporting performance.\n\nIn January, German newspaper Bild, external reported that jumpers were injecting their penises with hyaluronic acid before being measured for their suits.\n\nHyaluronic acid, which is not banned in sport, can be used to increase penis circumference by one or two centimetres.\n\nThis would increase the surface area of their suits during competition, which, according to FIS, the international ski and snowboard federation, could increase their flight in the air.\n\n\"Every extra centimetre on a suit counts. If your suit has a 5% bigger surface area, you fly further,\" said FIS ski jumping men's race director Sandro Pertile.\n\nAsked about the claims in Bild at a press conference at the Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics, Wada director general Olivier Niggli said: \"I am not aware of the details of ski jumping, and how that could improve performance.\n\n\"If anything was to come to the surface, we would look at it and see if it is doping related. We don't address other [non-doping] means of enhancing performance.\"\n\nClearly entertained by the question, Wada's Polish president Witold Banka joked: \"Ski jumping is very popular in Poland so I promise you I'm going to look at it.\"\n\nFIS communications director Bruno Sassi told BBC Sport: \"There has never been any indication, let alone evidence, that any competitor has ever made use of a hyaluronic acid injection to attempt to gain a competitive advantage.\"\n\nBefore the start of each season, ski jumpers are measured using 3D body scanners, in which they must wear only \"elastic, body-tight underwear\".\n\nRules state their suits must have a tolerance of only 2-4cm, and as part of the measuring process, their crotch height is also measured.\n\nThe crotch height of their suit must conform to the athlete's crotch height, with the addition of 3cm for men.\n\nHyularonic acid injected into the penis can last up to 18 months.\n\nThere have been previous attempts to improve performance through manipulations of the suits.\n\nIn August, Norwegian Olympic medallists Marius Lindvik and Johann Andre Forfang accepted three-month suspensions for their part in the tampering of suits during the men's large hill event at the World Ski Championships in Trondheim, Norway, in March.\n\nWhile it later transpired the athletes themselves were not aware of the tampering, FIS said their team had \"tried to cheat the system\" by putting reinforced thread in their jumpsuits.\n\nBoth athletes are set to compete at these Winter Olympics, which officially start on Friday.\n\nThe men's ski jumping competition begins on Monday.\n\nBBC Sport has contacted FIS for comment.",

    "title": "Jon Rahm hits out LIV Golf world ranking points call: ‘Doesn’t seem fair’",
    "description": "The Official World Golf Rankings ruled that only the top 10 finishers at LIV Golf events will be awarded world ranking points",
    "fullText": "Jon Rahm has lamented the restrictions put on LIV Golf as unfair after the Official World Golf Rankings (OWGR) awarded the tour world ranking points five years after its establishment.\n\nThe OWGR approved LIV’s submission for ranking points with some conditions due to the less than traditional nature of the breakaway tour, including the lower competitive fields, and awarded LIV players world ranking points if they finish in the top 10.\n\nThe Saudi Arabia-backed league called the decision a “long overdue moment of recognition” but revealed its disappointment at the limits placed on them from the OWGR, demanding a more “transparent” and “equal” system which does “reflect performance over affiliation”.\n\nAnd while Rahm admitted his delight “that we’re being recognised in a way”, he hit out at the harsher treatment given to LIV golfers.\n\n“I don't like how we're not being treated the same as every other tour,” he said at LIV Golf’s season opener in Riyadh.\n\n\"It seems like the rules that have been in place don't really apply to us, with only 10 of us getting points.\n\n\"It doesn't seem fair. The small fields out there throughout the course of the year, their players get full points.\"\n\nThe Spaniard, a two-time major winner, still believes there is “work to be done” as he highlighted the pitfalls of the restrictions.\n\n\"While it's good for some people, it could cause some players to actually lose world ranking points instead of gaining them because finishing 11th is basically a missed cut, and we're already adding to the divisor,” Rahm added.\n\n\"But I'm thankful that LIV Golf got their foot in the door, and there's a possibility for us to walk in the room and be recognised as a tour, as we should be.\"\n\nThe significance of LIV obtaining OWGR points is because they are important to players aiming to qualify for the annual four majors. The rankings are worked out via a two-year rolling system with more weight given to the most recent results.",

She is accredited with Georgia as the coach of European champion Nika Egadze.\n\nValieva, then aged 15, was at the center of a legal battle during the 2022 Beijing Games when a sample she gave two months earlier tested positive for the banned substance trimetazidine. The revelation came after Valieva won team gold with other Russian skaters. She was later disqualified from that event, which upgraded the United States to gold. Valieva was a contender for the women’s gold medal but placed fourth and was criticized rink-side by Tutberidze.\n\n“It’s not our decision the coach is here,” Banka said Thursday at a news conference in Milan. “The investigation found no evidence that this particular person was engaged in this doping process, so there’s no legal basis to exclude her from the presence during the Olympic Games.”\n\n“But of course, if you ask me personally about my feelings,” he continued, “I don’t feel comfortable with her presence here in the Olympic Games, for sure.”\n\nThe Georgian Figure Skating Federation did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nValieva's ban expired in December, despite legal efforts to have it overturned.\n\nRules have been changed to raise the minimum age for skaters to 17 in time for the Milan Cortina Winter Olympics.\n\nAP Winter Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics",

    "description": "How physically magnifying objects using a key ingredient in diapers has opened an unprecedented view of the microbial world.",
    "fullText": "When you slip a slide under a microscope, a system of glass lenses magnifies the object of your attention — a microbe, for example. But even with the largest zoom on a classic compound optical system, scientists struggle to make sense of finer details, which can be further obscured when tough cell walls make it difficult to inject dyes that help identify structures.\n\nNow, rather than invest in more powerful and more expensive technologies, some scientists are using an alternative technique called expansion microscopy, which inflates the subject using the same moisture-absorbing material found in diapers.\n\n“It’s cheap, it’s easy to learn, and indeed, on a cheap microscope, it gives you better images,” said Omaya Dudin, a cell biologist at the University of Geneva who studies multicellularity.\n\nExpansion microscopy was developed by Ed Boyden at the McGovern Institute for Brain Research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2015. Boyden and colleagues successfully expanded a biological sample by infusing it with a hydrogel made of sodium acrylate. A key ingredient layered in diapers to keep babies dry, the compound can absorb hundreds of times its weight in water while retaining its overall structure.\n\nIn expansion microscopy, specific biomolecules such as proteins are anchored to the gel. As the gel absorbs added water, its weblike matrix swells, and the space between the web’s anchor points dilates. Ideally, the overall structure remains, allowing researchers to visualize extra-tiny anatomy or see inside cells with tough barriers.\n\nDudin had spent six frustrating years trying to force antibodies through his target cells’ sturdy walls to bind to specific proteins and visualize their internal structures, and he was only able to do so through a complex freeze-and-thaw protocol that destroyed most of the final product. Desperate, he struck up a Covid-era collaboration with the lab next door that was using expansion microscopy.\n\n“That moment was just magical. All the cells were expanded, everything stained, we could see,” Dudin said. “It very rapidly became clear that we should aim for the sky with this one.”\n\nGautam Dey, a cell biologist at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory in Heidelberg who studies mitosis, found that the method worked just as well in his lab. The samples were clearer, and the dyes and antibodies penetrated cells more effectively, so the two labs struck up a collaboration to visualize species they had never studied before. They are working to chart the landscape of cytoskeletal diversity, visualizing complex cytoskeletal structures that have never been seen in such detail.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, expansion microscopy is possible for any lab with a basic microscope and the hydrogel. “People have talked about democratizing microscopy before. This is it, it’s happening,” Dey said. “I think it’s just a matter of time before any cell biology lab in the world is doing it. A basic fluorescence microscope is never too far away.”",

The Factbook proved so useful that other federal agencies began using it, and within a decade, an unclassified version was released to the public.\n\nAfter going online in 1997, the Factbook quickly became a popular reference site for journalists, trivia aficionados and the writers of college essays, racking up millions of visits per year.\n\nThe White House has moved to cut staffing at the CIA and the National Security Agency early in Trump’s second term, forcing the agency to do more with less.\n\nThe CIA did not return a message seeking comment Wednesday about the decision to cease publication of the Factbook.",

    "title": "Software ate the world. Now AI is eating software.",
    "description": "What was once a stable and profitable tech business now faces an existential question: What happens if AI tools and agents replace business software?",
    "fullText": "In 2011, venture capitalist Marc Andreessen declared \"software is eating the world.\" Today, AI is beginning to devour software.\n\nInstead of helping the industry improve, new AI tools and agents could end up replacing some software products entirely.\n\nThis anxiety crystallized in recent weeks with three developments: Anthropic's release of a new autonomous AI agent called Cowork, the launch of industry-specific Cowork plugins, and the rise of OpenClaw, an open-source AI assistant spreading rapidly through messaging apps.\n\n\"Is this the end for software?\" Raimo Lenshow, a veteran tech analyst at Barclays, wrote in a recent note to investors. \"The current situation in software feels very unique with the large overhang of how AI will impact the space in the long-run.\"\n\nToday, companies get stuff done through a complex collection of different software services that help them wrangle data, track financials, sell products, and manage employees, customers, supply chains, and contracts. (If you've ever had to login to Workday, you'll know what I mean).\n\nGenerative AI is a threat to these applications in two main ways. First, if employees get more efficient using AI tools, companies may not need to buy as many business software subscriptions. That would dent the growth of \"seats,\" or how many subscriptions software companies sell. Each employee has a seat, so if there's no new hiring, growth stalls.\n\nThe second threat is more existential. If AI tools and AI agents get good enough, companies could replace the software they use entirely and instead rely on new AI-powered workflows. And with AI coding tools showing big improvements lately, companies could even develop their own software, without needing to buy it from established vendors.\n\nThis is why Anthropic's recent announcements have hit the software sector so hard.\n\nAnthropic's Cowork marks a clear step beyond chatbots. Instead of simply answering questions, Cowork can plan and execute multi-step tasks on a user's computer. Users can grant it access to folders, files, and applications, allowing the AI to clean up documents, build spreadsheets and slide decks, analyze data, automate workflows, and even log into web apps to collect information.\n\nBarclays analysts described Cowork as closer to what Microsoft originally envisioned for Copilot—a true digital worker—but with far greater autonomy. Microsoft shares are down about 12% in the past week or so.\n\nCowork is designed for non-technical and semi-technical users, such as marketers, project managers, and finance professionals, who can direct it using plain English. That matters because it weakens the traditional value proposition of many SaaS tools. If an AI agent can organize files, generate reports, build dashboards, and automate routine workflows on demand, the need for a dedicated, single-purpose application starts to look less obvious.\n\nThe threat became more concrete when Anthropic followed up by launching plugins for Cowork this week. These plugins effectively turn the AI into a specialist for roles like sales, finance, legal, marketing, and customer support, connecting it directly to internal data sources and tools. Anthropic even open-sourced a starter set of plugins, signaling an ecosystem approach rather than a closed product.\n\n\"This is another front-of-mind example of an AI tool lowering the barrier to entry, gaining traction, and disrupting incumbent workflows,\" said Michelle Miller, co-head of the Enterprise Software Technology group at consulting firm AlixPartners.\n\nFor years, companies bought software because building it themselves was too slow and expensive. Generative AI is flipping that equation. Tools like Anthropic's Claude, OpenAI-powered coding assistants, and products from StackBlitz, Replit, and others allow non-engineers to create custom tools with relatively simple English language prompts.\n\nNetlify CEO Matt Biilmann has said his own employees have used AI to build internal replacements for SaaS products like survey and quoting tools. Venture capitalist Martin Casado has described building a personal CRM with AI because it was easier than learning a complex off-the-shelf product. Salesforce, the leading CRM software vendor, is down about 40% in the past year.\n\nStackblitz CEO Eric Simons said his startup has created in-house AI agents for many workflows, including business intelligence, data analysis, coding, product development, customer support, and outbound sales.\n\n\"As a result, there are many SaaS vendors we would have likely previously used that are no longer relevant,\" he told Business Insider.\n\n\"The industry is waking up to the fact that AI is becoming extremely good at creating software autonomously,\" he added. \"This brings questions around what 'moats' exist for incumbent companies that are not themselves frontier AI labs.\"\n\nThis shift is especially dangerous for mid-sized SaaS companies. According to AlixPartners, they're being squeezed between nimble AI-native startups on one side and tech giants bundling AI into existing platforms on the other. Enterprise buyers, under pressure to cut costs, are increasingly asking why they need five tools when one AI tool or agent can do some, or most, of the work.\n\nPricing adds another layer of tension. AI systems are expensive to run, making traditional per-seat pricing harder to justify. Companies like ServiceNow are experimenting with hybrid and usage-based models. CEO Bill McDermott has insisted AI isn't hurting results, but investors remain skeptical. ServiceNow shares have plunged 25% in the past month.\n\nIf Cowork represents a top-down push from a well-funded AI lab, OpenClaw, formerly called Moltbot, shows how disruption can also come from the bottom up.\n\nCreated as a personal project and released as open source, OpenClaw is a messaging-first AI assistant that works inside platforms like WhatsApp, Slack, and iMessage. Relying heavily on Anthropic's Claude models, OpenClaw remembers context, proactively nudges users, and can automate tasks using browser actions, scripts, and scheduled jobs. After a month or so of relative obscurity, it went viral in late January.\n\nWhat caught investors' attention wasn't just OpenClaw's popularity, but what it represents. Instead of logging into multiple apps, users interact with an AI agent in a chat window and let it orchestrate tasks behind the scenes. In effect, the interface becomes conversation, not software menus.\n\nBarclays analysts noted that OpenClaw's underlying \"gateway,\" which routes tasks between agents and tools, resembles the orchestration layer that many enterprise software vendors are now racing to build.\n\nThe difference is that OpenClaw is free, open source, and user-controlled — a worrying combination for software incumbents that rely on expensive licenses. It's also a potential problem because the direct user relationship is now controlled by OpenClaw, not software providers.\n\nNone of this means software is disappearing overnight. Core systems of record — databases, payroll systems, accounting ledgers — remain deeply embedded in corporate operations. But the layers around them are becoming fluid. Dashboards, workflows, reports, and even entire applications can now be generated and used on the fly by AI agents.\n\nFor SaaS companies, the message is stark. Adapt by embracing agents, flexible pricing, and AI-native design — or risk becoming the next thing AI consumes.\n\n\"AI is forcing change across software development, AI governance and data security, go-to-market operations, pricing models, valuation frameworks, and business structure,\" AlixPartners' Miller said. \"Software companies mastering these transitions will define the winners in the next era, and those unable to adapt will be sidelined as industry fundamentals are redrawn.\"\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "fullText": "THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — Russian missiles and drones have pounded Ukraine’s energy grid in recent weeks, plunging people into frozen darkness in one of the country’s coldest winters on record.\n\nUkraine has accused Russia of illegally targeting power infrastructure during the war to deny civilians light, heating and running water.\n\n\"Taking advantage of the coldest days of winter to terrorize people is more important to Russia than diplomacy,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Tuesday, on the eve of a new round of talks about ending the conflict and as temperatures in Kyiv hovered around minus 20 C (minus 3 F).\n\nRussia says its attacks are a legitimate part of its military campaign against its neighbor. Moscow's invasion of Ukraine itself is widely regarded as an illegal act of aggression.\n\nSo, are attacks on energy installations allowed during war?\n\nCombatants can legally target a power grid if the attack “directly affects a valid military target” — but they cannot cause excessive civilian casualties, said David Crane, former chief prosecutor at the United Nations Special Court for Sierra Leone.\n\nIn the case of Russia's attacks on Ukraine, “the indiscriminate and widespread targeting does not come close to what is legal,” he said in an emailed response to questions from The Associated Press.\n\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross says that parts of energy systems providing essential services to civilians “are in principle civilian objects, and as such are protected against direct attack and reprisals as well as incidental harm.”\n\nPretrial judges from the International Criminal Court, in fact, issued arrest warrants in 2024 for top Russian military brass and the country’s former defense minister for their alleged involvement in missile strikes targeting electricity infrastructure.\n\nIn announcing warrants for former Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Russia’s chief military officer, Gen. Valery Gerasimov, the court said that judges found “reasonable grounds to believe that the alleged strikes were directed against civilian objects, and for those installations that may have qualified as military objectives at the relevant time, the expected incidental civilian harm and damage would have been clearly excessive to the anticipated military advantage.”\n\nRussia is not a member of the court, rejects its jurisdiction, and refuses to extradite suspects to face justice in the ICC’s courtrooms in The Hague, Netherlands.\n\nThe Russian military has repeatedly said that it has targeted energy facilities and other infrastructure that support Ukrainian military industries and armed forces. It has denied targeting residential areas despite daily evidence to the contrary.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov insisted Wednesday that “our military is striking the targets that they believe are associated with the military complex of the Kyiv regime, the operation is continuing.”\n\nKyiv accuses Russia of seeking to wear down Ukrainians’ appetite for the fight by inflicting grinding hardship on civilians forced to live in dark, freezing homes.\n\nAuthorities say Russia has tried to cripple Ukraine's electricity network by targeting substations, transformers, turbines and generators at power plants. Ukraine’s largest private power company, DTEK, said that this week's overnight attack was the ninth major assault on the company’s thermal power plants since October.\n\nUkraine’s energy sector has suffered more than $20 billion in direct war damage, according to a joint estimate by the World Bank, the European Commission and the United Nations.",

    "fullText": "Scotland head coach Gregor Townsend has played down a report that he has agreed to take over at Newcastle Red Bulls after the World Cup.\n\nTownsend already has a part-time consultancy role with Newcastle but the Daily Telegraph has reported, external that he will take over full time - most likely as a director of rugby - when his Scottish Rugby Union contract expires in 2027.\n\nTownsend advises Newcastle on strategy and philosophy and several of his key allies have already been recruited by the ambitious club, which was taken over by the energy drinks manufacturer last year.\n\nHe is under pressure as Scotland coach as he prepares for the Six Nations following a disappointing autumn series that included his side being booed off at Murrayfield after surrendering a 21-0 lead against Argentina.\n\nHowever the former Scotland stand-off, who took over as head coach of the national team in 2017, has denied he has put pen to paper on a deal with Newcastle.\n\n\"It's pure speculation, I've not signed a contract beyond the World Cup with anybody,\" Townsend said as he announced his team for their Six Nations opener against Italy.\n\n\"It's a story that is being put out there to try to disrupt before the Italy game or next week's game against England.\n\n\"It's just something that comes out, things like these, before the England game in particular.\n\n\"There's no truth I've signed the contract beyond the World Cup and my focus is on the Scotland team right now and hopefully up to the World Cup.\"\n\nNewcastle have signed 16 players for next season, including England scrum-half Raffi Quirke from Sale Sharks, New Zealand forward Hoskins Sotutu and Fiji winger Joji Nasova.\n\nScotland leave out Van der Merwe, Kinghorn & Graham\n\nAnalysis by BBC Scotland's chief sports writer Tom English\n\n\"Speculation\" is an interesting word for Gregor Townsend to use regarding the report in the Daily Telegraph.\n\nHe hasn't signed a deal with anybody, he says. And it's all a tactic to disrupt Scotland before the Six Nations.\n\nSorry, but I'm not sure anybody is buying that one. Has he committed to signing a deal?\n\nHe hasn't exactly blown this story out of the water with \"speculation\" and obfuscation. There's probably a reason for that.\n\nThe report in the Daily Telegraph just supports everything we have heard on the grapevine.\n\nBut if Scotland start well in the Six Nations then what he does in 2027 is not going to have much of an impact. Nobody will care.\n\nIf they start badly then all sorts will get thrown at him in the here and now - distracted by his links with Red Bull and Newcastle and so on.\n\nScotland's rising star poised for sliding doors moment\n\n'Uncage the gorilla' - Schoeman knows what Scots must improve\n\nTownsend said form was behind the surprise selections in his back three for the Italy game in Rome on Saturday.\n\nDuhan van der Merwe and Darcy Graham - Scotland's top two try-scorers - as well as British and Irish Lions Test full-back Blair Kinghorn have been omitted.\n\nTom Jordan will play at full-back with Glasgow Warriors wingers Kyle Steyn and Jamie Dobie on the flanks.\n\n\"Blair, Duhan and Darcy have had some terrific games for us and they're very proud playing for Scotland. But there is competition in that back three area as there is in other positions,\" said Townsend.\n\n\"We feel Jamie, Kyle, and Tom deserve their starts given how well they've been playing.\n\n\"Selection is about giving players opportunities and they've earned it. All three of them individually have taken games to the opposition, worked really hard at areas really important at Test level.\n\n\"But the three that weren't selected are quality players. How they've trained over the last few weeks will be positive for the future if and when they get back into the team.\"",

    "description": "World champion Lando Norris is anticipating \"more chaos in races\" as a result of new rule changes in Formula 1 next season.",
    "fullText": "World champion Lando Norris says he expects \"more chaos in races\" this year as a result of the new rules introduced to Formula 1.\n\nThe sport has its biggest regulation change in history, with engines, chassis, fuel and tyres all subject to new requirements.\n\nEnergy management of the battery will be a central feature, with engines that now have more of their total power output provided by the electrical hybrid elements.\n\nBriton Norris said: \"You're going to see more chaos in races where a driver has to be a little bit more on top of all of these different situations that can happen.\n\n\"And that will happen through the whole year, I would say. There's more emphasis on drivers' ability to control all of these things.\"\n\nThe McLaren driver said the use of the new 'boost button', which gives an extra burst of electrical energy, and the effect that has on the battery's state of charge will be central to the new format of F1.\n\n\"You'll be able to force people \n\n\"And that's probably a better thing, a good thing.\"\n\nNorris is basing his early assessment of the cars on the 'shakedown' test that was held in Barcelona last week. There are two further three-day pre-season tests in Bahrain over the next two weeks, starting on 11 February.\n\nHe says the new engines and the need to manage energy could lead to drivers swapping positions more often.\n\n\"You'll see more yo-yoing, more moves with extra speed. But then that person might have to defend more than what you've seen in the past and that will create more chaos, which is great for you guys,\" he added.\n\nThe engines are still 1.6-litre V6 turbo hybrids, as they have been since 2014, but one of the two electrical motors that recovered energy has been removed.\n\nThe total amount of electrical energy has been increased by a factor of three, but the battery is more or less the same size. If the battery is fully depleted, the engine loses 350kw (470bhp), leading to potentially dramatic speed differentials.\n\nDrivers will be backing off towards the end of straights - and being careful about when they apply the throttle - to ensure the most efficient energy usage, even on a qualifying lap.\n\nThe cars are also smaller and lighter, have less downforce and have 'active aerodynamics' - where both front and rear wings open on the straights to increase speed and the possibility for energy recovery.\n\nNorris said the new car \"certainly feels more powerful and quicker\" on the straight.\n\n\"The biggest challenge at the minute is battery management and knowing how to utilise that in the best way,\" he said.\n\n\"It's not simple. You can explain it in quite simple terms. It's just you have a very powerful battery that doesn't last very long, so knowing how to use it in the right times, how much energy, how much of that power you use, how you split it up around the lap...\n\n\"The biggest challenge is how you can recover the batteries as well as possible, and that's when it comes down to using the gears, hitting the right revs.\n\n\"Obviously, you've got some turbo lag now, which we've never really had before. All of these little things have crept back in, but I don't think that changes too much.\n\n\"In a perfect world, I probably wouldn't have [all] that in a race car, but it's just F1. Sometimes you have these different challenges.\"\n\nHis team-mate Oscar Piastri said the cars were \"not as alien as I think we might have feared\" and insisted he \"didn't think F1 had lost its identity at all\".\n\nThe Australian added: \"There's going to be some things to get used to but in terms of some of the fears that maybe we had before we got on track, a significant majority of those have been alleviated now.\n\n\"There'll be some differences, but I think fundamentally they're still the fastest cars in the world.\"\n\nBarcelona 'shakedown' offers first hints of F1 2026\n\nActive aero and overtake mode - F1's new terminology\n\nThe reduced downforce has lowered cornering speeds and ensured some of the quicker corners, where drivers did not have to slow down before, will be more challenging.\n\nNorris said: \"Quite a lot more corners that were easy flat in previous years or the last few years are going to become much bigger corners again.\n\n\"So that's a good thing in some ways and therefore you can see more racing.\n\n\"But you might have different strategies because what was then flat last year and not really a grip-limited section, now when you put a new set of tyres on you'll be able to gain in a lot more parts of the track.\"\n\nNorris won his first title last year in a close season-long battle with Piastri and Red Bull's Max Verstappen.\n\nThe 26-year-old said he was revelling in the fact he had achieved his \"life's ambition\" and was keen to continue his success.\n\n\"If I don't achieve something again, I always have something that I'm very proud about. If anything, I enjoyed last year a lot - and of course I really want to do it again.\"\n\nNorris' success in 2025 was the consequence of a big step in performance in the second half of the season, after assiduous work with his team on improving following a difficult first few races.\n\n\"I'm always trying to improve on my things,\" he said. \"I know there's still areas that I'm not at the level I need to be - and it's still a good level - but when you're fighting these guys, you need to be close to perfection. There's still plenty of things I want to work on and I want to be better on, but the baseline level of where I'm at now is already pretty good.\n\n\"My motivation to win is exactly the same. I've definitely not lost anything and, if anything, I think I just have more confidence because I've said in interviews and stuff in the past that I'm very much a guy who has to see something to believe it, especially when it's been on anything to do with myself.\"\n\nRussell 'wants to go head-to-head' with Verstappen\n\nVowles 'not concerned at all' at missing test\n\nBiggest rule change ever and Brit teen - what's new in F1 in 2026?",

    "description": "With the T20 World Cup beginning on Saturday, BBC Sport looks at the trends and tactics from the global game that may play a part in India and Sri Lanka.",
    "fullText": "It may be just 19 months since India lifted the T20 World Cup in Barbados but the latest edition begins in Colombo on Saturday.\n\nAs ever, the tournament in India and Sri Lanka will likely be one of sixes and runs.\n\nBefore it all begins, we have taken a look at what has been going on in international and franchise games over recent years and predicted some trends and tactics to watch out for...\n\nThe option for a team to call in a batter who is struggling and chewing up too many balls has always been there.\n\n2025 was the year retiring batters out hit the mainstream.\n\nThere were 26 instances of that 'dismissal' in international and domestic T20s last year - almost 50% of the total number in the history of the format.\n\nIt has also happened twice more since the turn of the year in the Big Bash, while Northern Districts retired out two batters in the same innings in New Zealand's Super Smash in January.\n\nA batter has retired out in a T20 World Cup before - in a match involving England no less - when Namibia batter Nikolaas Davin walked off to allow David Wiese to come to the middle in the 2024 group stage.\n\nBut with the stigma around the move gone, could this be the tournament of the retired out?\n\nNot since 2013 have spinners bowled as much at the death in T20s as they did in 2025.\n\nFor a long while, the death overs - regarded as the last five in an innings for this data - have been left largely to seamers and their mix of yorkers, slower balls and hard lengths. That is changing.\n\nIn 2025, 24% of balls bowled at the death in T20s between full member nations were delivered by spinners - and with some success.\n\nSpinners' economy rate at the death has dropped around 1.5 runs per over in the past two years to 7.68 runs per over. Last year, spinners had a better economy at the finish than seamers.\n\nAfghanistan, unsurprisingly given the quality of their options, have used spin regularly at the death. More than half of their deliveries in the final five overs were bowled by spinners.\n\nIndia were the next most frequent users of the tactic, followed by Sri Lanka and, interestingly, England.\n\nWhile England captain and when leading Northern Superchargers in The Hundred since 2024, Harry Brook has had spinners bowling 42.2% of his deliveries at the death.\n\nFormer captain Jos Buttler's figure in that time was just 19.7%.\n\nThis may be less of a surprise, given fast scoring and six-hitting has been on an upward trajectory since T20's inception.\n\nLast year was a big jump, however, with batting strike-rates for all players in all men's T20s tipping over 130 for the first time. The increase from 2024 was more than eight runs per 100 balls.\n\nThe introduction of the Indian Premier League's player impact rule has boosted scoring rates there - teams effectively can field an extra batter when needed - but the rise is reflected in internationals too.\n\nA six was also hit every 17.4 deliveries across all T20s last year - the figure was at 23.1 as recently as 2021.\n\nSixes are now hit more than twice as often than in the format's first year in 2003.\n\nWe are all familiar with the term match-up these days.\n\nIt has become commonplace in T20 - and increasingly in Test cricket - and describes how some batters are suited to styles of bowling and vice-versa.\n\nWhen it comes to batting against spin, the logic goes that batters are more vulnerable when facing a bowler who turns the ball away from them - a leg-spinner to right-handers and off-spinner to left-handers.\n\nWhat is interesting, however, is how all of those at the top of the T20 batting rankings, bar Australia's openers Mitchell Marsh and Travis Head as shown below, all have strong records against their perceived negative spin match-up.\n\nIndia's left-handed opener Abhishek Sharma, the world's leading T20 batter, averages 43.3 and strikes at 183.1 runs per 100 balls against off-spin in internationals since the start of 2024.\n\nEngland right-handers Phil Salt and Buttler have strike-rates of 148.4 and 136.8 respectively against left-arm spin alongside solid averages.\n\nThe trend is reflected by the leading spin bowlers too. India's Varun Chakravarthy, Rashid Khan and Adil Rashid all have similar records against right and left-handers.\n\nWhen it gets to the elite level, match-ups are not insignificant but they are not the be all and end all.\n\nAnother thing on the rise is the prevalence of left-handed batters.\n\nIn T20s between full member nations, lefties have never faced a higher percentages of deliveries than the 35% they did in 2025.\n\nThe spike is a sign of some teams switching on to the benefits of right-hand-left-hand batting combinations.\n\nIt makes shorter boundaries harder to defend, messes with bowlers' lengths and negates the threat of those spinning match-ups.\n\nAnd no team uses this more than co-hosts and overwhelming favourites India. It has been a cornerstone of Gautam Gambhir's time as coach.\n\nSince the start of 2024, left-handers have faced 51% of India's deliveries in T20s against full members - a jump from 31% under Rahul Dravid in the run up to the 2024 World Cup.\n\nEngland, in comparison, twice picked a team with only one left-hander in their XI during the tour of India last year.\n\nBut while left-handers only faced 19% of England's deliveries from the start of 2024 to the start of 2026, the selection of Ben Duckett, Jacob Bethell and Sam Curran for this World Cup - all of whom could bat in the top seven - suggests times may, belatedly, be changing.\n\nBut if England are to have any chance in India and Sri Lanka, it feels like Salt and Buttler, their two leading batters, will have to hit form.\n\nAfter Buttler's period at number three, the pair were reunited as openers at the end of last summer and, despite a quiet run for Salt in Sri Lanka, have returned impressive results.\n\nSalt hit scores of 141 not out, 85 and 89 against South Africa and Ireland. Buttler also made 83 against South Africa when an opening stand of 126 sent England on their way to a record 304-2.\n\nSalt, a notoriously aggressive starter, cuts loose from the start, striking at 149.7 in the first two overs of T20s since the start of 2024 - the third best of any opener at this World Cup.\n\nButtler, in comparison, has a strike-rate of just 105 in that time. He sits back and watches Salt do his thing.\n\nBut by the final two overs of the powerplay Buttler is often flying.\n\nThe former captain, having taken a bit of time to get in, has been striking at 172.9 in the fifth and sixth overs, even outdoing Salt's healthy strike-rate of 163.7.\n\nThe pair take on the powerplay in specific and complementary ways.\n\nLive ball-by-ball commentary of every match on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra, BBC Sounds and the BBC Sport website and app, plus live texts with in-play clips and highlights.\n\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

    "description": "Jon Rahm says a ruling that will see only the top 10 finishers at LIV Golf events awarded world ranking points \"doesn't seem fair\".",
    "fullText": "Riyadh Individual - first-round leaderboard\n\n-7 T Detry (Bel), P Uihlein (US); -6 E Smylie (Aus); -5 T Gooch (US), L Oosthuizen (SA), S Munoz (Col), A Byeong-Hun (S Kor), J Rahm (Spa), T Hatton (Eng)\n\nSelected others: -4 B DeChambeau (US), S Garcia (Spa)\n\nA ruling that will see only the top 10 finishers at LIV Golf events awarded world ranking points \"doesn't seem fair\", says two-time major winner Jon Rahm.\n\nThe Official World Golf Rankings (OWGR) board revealed on Tuesday its decision to award LIV players points for the first time.\n\nBut the limit means it will be different from all 24 other men's professional golf tours that are part of the OWGR where everyone making the cut earn points.\n\nThe OWGR board said it was restricting points to the top 10 finishers in the Saudi Arabia-funded circuit because it \"recognises there are a number of areas where LIV Golf does not meet the eligibility standards set out by OWGR\".\n\nSpeaking at LIV Golf's season opener in Riyadh, Rahm said it was \"fantastic that we're being recognised in a way\" but he added: \"With that said, I don't like how we're not being treated the same as every other tour.\n\n\"It seems like the rules that have been in place don't really apply to us, with only 10 of us getting points.\n\n\"It doesn't seem fair. The small fields out there throughout the course of the year, their players get full points.\"\n\nThe Spaniard added he believes \"there's work to be done\".\n\n\"While it's good for some people, it could cause some players to actually lose world ranking points instead of gaining them because finishing 11th is basically a missed cut, and we're already adding to the divisor.\n\n\"But I'm thankful that LIV Golf got their foot in the door, and there's a possibility for us to walk in the room and be recognised as a tour, as we should be.\"\n\nSetting out its reasons for the restrictions, OWGR said LIV Golf's eligibility failures included an average field size of 57 for 2026 versus the minimum of 75 set out in the ranking body's regulations and \"self-selection of players with players being recruited rather than earning their place on the tour in many cases\".\n\nLIV has described OWGR's stance as \"unprecedented\", saying someone finishing 11th in one of its events would be \"treated the same as a player finishing 57th\".\n\nThe circuit has also highlighted events such as the Hero World Challenge (20 players), and the PGA Tour's end-of-season play-off events the Tour Championship (30) and BMW Championship (49) - and the European DP World Tour Championship (52) - as having smaller fields and no cut but still receiving world ranking points for all participants.\n\nRahm was among six players, also including England's Tyrell Hatton, tied for fourth after the first round at Riyadh Golf Club on Wednesday.\n\nBelgian Thomas Detry claimed a share of the lead on his LIV debut.\n\nThe 33-year-old, whose most recent win came at the PGA Tour's Phoenix Open last February, shot a bogey-free seven-under-par 65 to tie Peter Uihlein.\n\n\"First day on the job, so a little bit of a change for me, so a bit nervous,\" said Detry, who is part of Dustin Johnson's 4Aces GC.\n\nAustralia's Elvis Smylie, another rookie, is one off the lead, with Rahm and Hatton in a group two back, while Bryson DeChambeau and Sergio Garcia are at four under.\n\nThe event also marks LIV's switch from a 54-hole format to 72.",

    "description": "Valdez is a two-time All-Star and 2022 World Series champion. He was Houston’s ace last season with a 13-11 record and 3.66 ERA.",
    "fullText": "Free agent pitcher Framber Valdez and the Detroit Tigers have agreed to a $115 million, three-year contract, a person familiar with the situation told The Associated Press on Wednesday night.\n\nThe person spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because the deal had not been announced.\n\nValdez became one of baseball’s most durable starters with the Houston Astros. Now, the left-hander is set to join a Tigers rotation anchored by two-time AL Cy Young Award winner Tarik Skubal.\n\nSkubal went to a record-setting salary arbitration hearing Wednesday, with the left-hander asking for $32 million and the Tigers offering $19 million.\n\nValdez is a two-time All-Star and 2022 World Series champion. He was Houston’s ace last season with a 13-11 record and 3.66 ERA, and became a free agent for the first time.\n\nHe struck out 187 and walked 68 in 192 innings, and had a major league-high 12 wild pitches while making $18 million on a deal reached last offseason that avoided salary arbitration. He started Houston’s last four season openers.\n\nSince making his major league debut in 2018 with the Astros, he is 81-52 with a 3.36 ERA. The 32-year-old Dominican averaged more than 191 innings the past four seasons, joining Giants right-hander Logan Webb as the only two pitchers to throw at least 175 innings each of those years.\n\nValdez was 15-7 with a 2.91 ERA over 28 games in 2024 and threw a no-hitter in 2023, when he was an All-Star for a second straight season. He is 8-4 with a 4.34 ERA in 17 postseason games, including 16 starts.\n\nValdez pitched in two World Series for the Astros, and was the winning pitcher in the clinching Game 6 that secured their 2022 championship against Philadelphia.\n\nIn the 2022 Series, he was 2-0 in two starts while allowing two runs over 12 1/3 innings (1.46 ERA) with 18 strikeouts. A year earlier, he gave up 10 runs and 12 hits over 4 2/3 innings (19.29 ERA) in two starts against Atlanta.\n\nValdez rejected a $22,025,000 qualifying offer from the Astros in November, so they would receive a compensatory pick after the fourth round of the 2026 amateur draft if he completes his deal with Detroit, which would forfeit its third-highest selection.\n\nValdez pitched a no-hitter against Cleveland on Aug. 1, 2023. He came close to another one just more than a year later against Texas, but that bid was broken up when Corey Seager homered with two outs in the ninth inning.\n\nThere was a strange moment last season when Valdez denied intentionally hitting his catcher in the chest with a pitch almost immediately after giving up a grand slam in a loss to the New York Yankees.\n\nTwo pitches after Trent Grisham’s slam in the Yankees’ 7-1 victory on Sept. 2, Valdez crossed up catcher César Salazar by throwing a 92.8 mph sinker to Anthony Volpe. Salazar moved his glove downward as the pitch approached the plate, an indication he was expecting a pitch with less velocity and more break. The ball hit him in his chest protector.\n\nJust before the pitch Grisham sent over the fence, Salazar had motioned for Valdez to step off the mound. Valdez and Salazar both said after the game the pitch that hit the catcher wasn’t on purpose.\n\nAstros manager Joe Espada insisted a day later the situation was “100%” resolved in his mind, and he wanted to “get past this and get back to baseball,” and he met with both players.",

    "title": "5 Of The World's Worst F1 Courses (According To Racing Fans)",
    "description": "F1 travels the world, yet some venues draw criticism for dull races and awkward layouts. Fans weigh in on the circuits that frustrate drivers and viewers.",
    "fullText": "Very few sports generate as much thrill as Formula 1. Seeing the fastest drivers in the fastest cars in the world going flat out for what's now 24 weekends a year remains arguably the greatest spectacle in all of motorsport, but there are a few important factors that determine whether that's achieved on a regular basis. The biggest talking point for modern F1 is that the cars themselves aren't great for wheel-to-wheel racing, which is certainly a fair argument. The new regulations are designed to help promote close action, so hopefully we won't need to have that discussion as often going forward.\n\nEqually as important for generating competitive racing, though, are the tracks that they race on. As mentioned, F1 races at 24 different locations, with a wide variety of track styles present on the calendar. Before the season even starts, there are a few circuits that fans look forward to, for example, Silverstone and Interlagos. However, F1 has to follow the biggest and longest contracts to decide which tracks to race on, which aren't always best suited for the pinnacle of open-wheel racing. Fans of the sport don't hold back on their views of some of these circuits, and based on posts online, there's consistency regarding which ones are the most disliked. Looking at the wide array of posts on forum sites such as Reddit, here's a look at five tracks that are often a talking point for all the wrong reasons.\n\nEven if NASCAR has remained at the top of American motorsport, Formula One has long had a presence in the U.S., hosting races at iconic tracks such as Indianapolis, as well as various street circuits like Dallas, Detroit, and, most recently, Las Vegas. While the Circuit of the Americas in Austin has been on the calendar since 2012, Vegas was introduced in response to the recent surge in popularity of the pinnacle of open-wheel racing. A year earlier, the Miami International Autodrome was constructed around Hard Rock Stadium.\n\nAs one of the hybrid street-style circuits, Miami incorporates quite a few different elements from established tracks, with Sector 1 full of sweeping fast turns, followed by a long back straight before the incredibly tight beginning of Sector 3. It might sound good, but the layout is restricted by the stadium grounds to a significant degree. Compared to the tracks it takes inspiration from, many fans feel that it's terrible for actual racing, with the flow constantly being interrupted. Reddit users go as far as to say the Miami Autodrome is \"utterly soulless.\"\n\nThe Lusail International Circuit is one of the more unique venues for F1 at the moment, albeit for a different reason than any other track. First used in 2004, the Qatar track was designed for MotoGP. Of course, MotoGP bikes are massively different to control than an F1 car, with next to no downforce and an emphasis on rider balance and corner exits. As a result, the track features a variety of corners that are long and swooping on a MotoGP bike, promoting great side-by-side action. But for F1, the cars go through these sections so fast that it's a challenge to remain close to the car in front.\n\nIn DestinationFormula1's collection of fan feedback, this was a big issue that fans had with the Lusail circuit. Hopefully, the upcoming 2026 regulations can help solve this by reducing the dirty air given off by cars, but we'll have to wait and see. Similar to Miami, users on Reddit use the word \"soulless\" again to describe the track, but with MotoGP often providing thrilling action here, it just doesn't seem to be as well suited for four-wheeled cars.\n\nThe second Middle Eastern track featured here, the Yas Marina Circuit, has hosted the final race of the season since 2010 and has been on the calendar since 2009. Over the years, we've been treated to some thrilling title deciders at the Abu Dhabi track, many of which have been some of the most memorable races of those seasons. However, it's not necessarily the track itself that generates the excitement, with fans often finding races at Yas Marina to be lackluster when there's nothing at stake.\n\nFor the 2021 season, changes were made to the circuit in a bid to improve racing, namely the removal of two of the stop-start chicanes in Sectors 1 and 2 that some fans felt completely ruined the flow of the circuit. But still, the main overtaking zones remain the two long straights, which start after two corners that modern F1 cars struggle to follow closely through. Outside of the racing itself, other fans are also critical of the track because of the lack of atmosphere. The Abu Dhabi GP is very much intended to be a spectacle, but it doesn't exactly match the feel you get at Monza, Silverstone, or Zandvoort, for example.\n\nWhile other tracks on this list have been added to the sport quite recently, the calendar is also packed with venues that have essentially become staples of F1. Some of these tracks are ones that fans believe shouldn't ever be taken out, and the same can be said for all of them. The Spanish Grand Prix has taken place at the Circuit De Barcelona Catalunya ever since its introduction in 1991, and it instantly made a great impression with Senna and Mansell going wheel to wheel down the main straight. As F1 has developed over the years to become faster and faster, though, the track hasn't managed to keep up.\n\nCircuit De Barcelona Catalunya has just about every corner type you could have on a modern circuit, which makes it no surprise that it's used extensively for testing. But for actual racing, the never-ending flow of corners creates what one Reddit user calls \"stalemate racing.\" The removal of the final chicane has allowed cars to follow better down the straight, but in general, that's a pretty fair description. This is another track that'll hopefully reap the benefits of the smaller cars in 2026.\n\nAnd now for, without a doubt, the most controversial track in Formula 1, Circuit de Monaco. The Monte Carlo street track is one of four current tracks that were used for the inaugural season back in 1950, alongside Silverstone, Spa-Francorchamps, and Monza. Due to this, the history that Monaco holds for F1 can't be denied. But because of how big F1 cars are now, the opportunities for overtaking are virtually non-existent. It's been like this for decades, though, with Mansell finding no way past Senna despite having much fresher tires in 1992.\n\nQualifying has always been Monaco's moment to shine. The constant risk of crashing makes it a thrilling watch, and drivers such as Fernando Alonso call it \"one of the best moments of the season\" when speaking to ESPN. On race day, though, fans think the street circuit is simply \"not suited for modern racing,\" as one Reddit user puts it. For the 2025 race, two pit stops were made mandatory, but all that did was make drivers back each other up to open a pit window for their teammates. The heritage, combined with the challenge, makes it one of the races that drivers want to win more than most, but from the outside, the heritage is the only thing that keeps it on the calendar.\n\nWant the latest in tech and auto trends?

    "fullText": "International Olympic Committee president Kirsty Coventry says it must \"be better\" on climate change after receiving a petition signed by more than 21,000 people who want to stop fossil fuel companies from sponsoring winter sports.\n\nThe petition - delivered on Wednesday and with athletes among the signatories - comes as Italy's Eni, one of the world's seven biggest oil companies, is a 'premium partner' of the Milan-Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics.\n\nIt follows reports that the number of countries which could reliably host a Winter Olympics will hugely reduce in the future because of climate change.\n\nAsked by the BBC whether she is disappointed by the Games having high-carbon sponsors, Coventry said: \"It's really nice athletes have a platform to speak up.\n\n\"The petition, I know they met with our team today and we are having conversations in order to be better, and for our stakeholders to be better. But that takes time.\"\n\nChristophe Dubi, the IOC executive director for the Olympic Games, added: \"We make a point to receive those petitions, and we have to recognise climate is a challenge for all of us.\n\n\"What we have to do as an organisation is to be at the forefront of sustainability, and our principles are very clear.\"\n\nOne area the IOC is aiming to make the Olympics more sustainable is having Games take place over a wider area with more pre-existing facilities, and Coventry said Milan-Cortina is an acid test for whether this is a viable future.\n\nMilan-Cortina takes place in three hubs spread across northern Italy - in Milan, Cortina and Livigno - with only two newly built sporting facilities: the Santagiulia ice hockey arena and Cortina Sliding Centre.\n\nThe next two Winter Olympics - French Alps 2030 and Utah 2034 - will also have sports spread more widely, while the 2032 Summer Olympics in Brisbane is will have venues across Queensland.\n\nThis has caused issues however, with Brisbane organisers saying, external they will go beyond the originally stated budget of $4.9bn (£3.6bn).\n\n\"We are really experiencing a spread out Games here for the first time - we are going to learn a lot,\" Coventry said.\n\n\"We have taken this decision for sustainability reasons, climate and not having to have new venues. We are seeing there is an impact on National Olympic Committees because of the spreadness [sic], also for broadcast and media, making it harder to get around.\n\n\"What is really cool is that you get to see iconic venues in beautiful places - but now we have to weigh this up, the balance between a spread games for sustainability reasons but not shifting complexity and sustainability to different areas.\"\n\nWhile the action got underway on Wednesday with the start of the curling events, the 2026 Winter Olympics will officially start with the opening ceremony on Friday.\n\nCoventry said she hoped all nations would be treated with respect by spectators, including the USA team amid criticism from Italian authorities about the presence of ICE agents in Milan.\n\n\"I hope the opening ceremony is seen by everyone as a chance to be respectful,\" she said.\n\n\"For me, when we went to the Olympic village that is the best reminder of how the Games should be. I hope the opening ceremony will do that.\"\n\nFear and Hall named 2026 Team GB flagbearers\n\nRussian athletes linked to pro-war activity\n\nQuiz: Name every sport at the 2026 Winter Olympics",

Some fans have gone so far as to say they will boycott the performance, while others are perfectly fine with the global music star taking the stage.\n\nMORE: Bad Bunny’s new Super Bowl 2026 trailer sends clear message ahead of halftime show\n\nKevin Durant, however, falls into a different category altogether. The longtime NBA veteran recently spoke candidly about Bad Bunny and his music, offering a personal perspective as the Super Bowl LX halftime show approaches.\n\nDurant appeared on Kay Adams’ Up and Adams podcast on Wednesday, where he shared that he has not listened to any of Bad Bunny’s songs. When the former NFL Network reporter asked Durant, “I want to know how you’re doing?” he replied, “Doing better. We’ll see in the morning.” Later, when Adams said, “Well enough to like to dance to Bad Bunny, [Super Bowl] halftime?” Durant simply confessed, “I haven’t listened to Bad Bunny before.”\n\nKay Adams: \"I want to know how you're doing?\"\n\nKevin Durant: \"Doing better.

His albums, including ‘YHLQMDLG’, ‘El Último Tour del Mundo’, and ‘Un Verano Sin Ti’, were huge hits. His ‘Un Verano Sin Ti’ especially made history because a Spanish-language album became one of the most popular in the United States and worldwide.\n\nBut some NFL fans are unhappy about Bad Bunny performing at the Super Bowl. He has been outspoken on social and political issues, especially about U.S. immigration policies and ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement).\n\nHe made a high-profile speech at the 2026 Grammys condemning ICE actions and calling for empathy toward immigrants, which upset many conservative viewers. These critics see him as too political and say his views don’t fit a traditionally neutral sports event.\n\nNFL: Ranking the greatest Super Bowl quarterback performances\n\nNBA: Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo’s mom hints at next NBA team\n\nMLB: Mets sign former Dodgers World Series champion\n\nSPORTS MEDIA: Mattress Mack reveals massive $2 million Super Bowl 60 wager\n\nENTERTAINMENT: WWE star calls Pat McAfee to reveal shocking 2026 Royal Rumble return\n\nVIRAL: Kendall Jenner halts interview for Tom Brady Super Bowl 60 prediction on FaceTime\n\nThe post Kevin Durant stuns NFL world with honest Bad Bunny confession ahead of Super Bowl halftime show appeared first on The Big Lead.",

He is the best in any sport at managing emotions and we all try to be like him, but it's not easy.\"\n\nO'Sullivan will play Xiao Guodong, who beat Kyren Wilson on Tuesday, in the second round on Thursday as he continues his bid for a record-extending 42nd title.\n\nWorld number three Robertson entered the tournament in good form after reaching the semi-finals of the German Masters last week, but failed to carry his momentum into the first-round tie with Jak Jones as he lost 5-1.\n\nRobertson started well with a break of 46, but a missed red handed the initiative to Jones, who went on to open up a 2-0 lead.\n\nA break of 88 helped Robertson fight back briefly to win the third frame, but Jones took control afterwards, triumphing in the next three to ease into the second round.\n\nThe match in Hong Kong took place only three and a half days after Robertson's 6-1 defeat by Shaun Murphy in Berlin, with the Australian cutting a frustrated figure throughout.\n\nFormer World Championship finalist Jones will play Zhou Yuelong in the second round on Thursday.\n\nGerman Masters winner Trump was beaten by Yuan Sijun, who knocked in a 103 in the first frame as he went 2-0 up.\n\nTrump took the third and fifth frames but Yuan stood firm to secure a 5-2 victory and a match against Ali Carter, who beat Allen 5-4.\n\nHiggins beat world champion Zhao Xintong on the way to the Masters final last month but, this time, was beaten 5-3 by the Chinese player, who set up a match against Mark Selby.\n\nMurphy lost 5-1 to China's Pang Junxu, who made breaks of 134 and 130 on the way to victory.\n\nOverall, nine Chinese players have reached the last 16, a record for any ranking event.",

    "fullText": "The men's T20 World Cup starts on Saturday against a backdrop of political tension.\n\nThe tournament, which features 20 teams, will be held in India and Sri Lanka.\n\nBangladesh are boycotting it after a request for their fixtures to be switched from India to Sri Lanka was refused by the sport's governing body.\n\nTheir place in Group C has been taken by Scotland.\n\nPakistan had considered boycotting but have since confirmed they will take part, though will not play their scheduled match against India.\n\nBangladesh had asked for their games to be switched from India, citing safety concerns amid growing tensions between the countries.\n\nRelations between the South Asian neighbours have soured since former Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina fled to India in 2024, following deadly protests.\n\nIndia has not agreed to send her back despite several requests, and violent protests broke out after Sharif Osman Hadi - a prominent student leader in Bangladesh - was shot dead.\n\nIndia itself has raised concerns over violence targeting members of the minority Hindu community in Bangladesh.\n\nIn December, a Hindu man was accused of blasphemy and beaten to death by a mob in an incident that resulted in protests by Hindu nationalist groups in India.\n\nAgainst that political backdrop, Indian Premier League (IPL) side Kolkata Knight Riders released Bangladesh bowler Mustafizur Rahman in January after being instructed to do so by the Board of Control for Cricket in India.\n\nIn response, Bangladeshi authorities banned broadcasts of the IPL in the country.\n\nThe Bangladesh Cricket Board then requested that their World Cup fixtures be played in Sri Lanka.\n\nThe International Cricket Council - the sport's governing body - rejected that request, saying there was an \"absence of any credible security threat\" and gave the BCB a final 24 hours in which to declare their participation.\n\nWhen that deadline passed, Scotland were invited to the tournament.\n\nThe ICC said it was keen not to establish \"precedents that could undermine the neutrality and fairness of ICC events\".\n\nPakistan are boycotting their match against India, which was scheduled to take place in Colombo, Sri Lanka, on 15 February.\n\nIn a statement, the Pakistan government said it granted \"approval\" to the team's participation in the tournament but they \"shall not take to the field\" for the match against India.\n\nPakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Mohsin Naqvi previously said the team could pull out completely after Bangladesh were removed from the tournament.\n\nPakistan and India have not faced each other outside men's major tournaments since 2013, and India have not played in Pakistan since 2008.\n\nPakistan did not host any touring nations between 2009 and 2019 following the Lahore attack on Sri Lanka's team bus, which killed six policemen and two civilians.\n\nPakistani players have also been banned from the IPL since 2009 following the Mumbai attacks that left 174 people - including nine gunmen - dead.\n\nLast year India refused to travel to Pakistan to play in the Champions Trophy and eventually played their matches in the United Arab Emirates.\n\nIt resulted in the two nations signing an agreement stating the two countries would play at neutral venues whenever one of them hosts an ICC event.\n\nThe neighbours have fought a number of wars and had several military stand-offs since the partition of India in 1947, when the nation was split into India and the new state of Pakistan. It created an upsurge of violence, in which approximately 15 million people were displaced and an estimated one million died.\n\nRecent escalations were sparked after the neighbours engaged in a four-day military conflict in April 2025 following a deadly militant attack on tourists in India-administered Kashmir.\n\nThe ICC said Pakistan's stance was \"difficult to reconcile\" and called on the country's cricket chiefs to explore a \"mutually acceptable resolution\".\n\nThe governing body said that \"selective participation undermines the spirit and sanctity of the competitions\".\n\nIt said it \"respects the roles of governments in matters of national policy\" but continued: \"This decision is not in the interest of the global game or the welfare of fans worldwide, including millions in Pakistan.\"\n\nIt added it hoped the PCB would \"consider the significant and long-term implications for cricket in its own country\".\n\nFormer Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi is among those who have accused the ICC of mishandling the situation.\n\nIn a post on X, he said: \"It's regrettable that Pakistan won't play India, but I stand behind my government's decision.\n\n\"This is the moment for the ICC to lead and prove through decisions, not statements, that it is impartial, independent and fair to every member.\"\n\nMatches between Pakistan and India can draw huge TV audiences.\n\nReportedly, more than 600 million people watched last year's Champions Trophy fixture on Indian streaming platform JioHotstar.\n\nThe ICC has not published its playing conditions for the tournament so it is not known what sanction Pakistan could face.\n\nHowever, the rules for the previous tournament stated: \"If the match is decided by one side conceding defeat or refusing to play, the result shall be stated as match conceded or match awarded, as the case may be.\"\n\nIt is assumed India will be awarded two points for a win and Pakistan's net run-rate will also be hit by the forfeiture.\n\nPakistan face the Netherlands, USA and Namibia in their other group-stage games, and it is unclear what could happen if they were to face India in the final.\n\nTeams have pulled out of tournament fixtures before, with Australia and the West Indies both deciding not to travel to Colombo in the 1996 World Cup that was co-hosted by India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.\n\nEngland also decided not to play their 2003 World Cup match against Zimbabwe in Harare, citing security concerns and social unrest in the country.\n\nNone of those nations received a subsequent fine or punishment from the ICC, though all forfeited the matches.\n\nBoth Pakistan and Bangladesh could receive other sanctions as the ICC has a precedent for punishing governments who interfere in the game.\n\nUnder article 2.4 of the ICC constitution, it outlines boards must manage their affairs \"autonomously and ensure that there is no government (or other public or quasi-public body) interference in its governance, regulation and/or administration of cricket\".\n\nIn 2019, Zimbabwe were suspended for three months after the government replaced the cricket board, leading to a freeze on funding and exclusion from World Cup qualifiers.\n\nFour years later, Sri Lanka also lost the right to host the Under-19 World Cup after its government dismissed the national board following poor performances.\n\nBoth nations later had their ICC membership restored.\n\nThis article is the latest from BBC Sport's Ask Me Anything team.\n\nICC Men's T20 World Cup - everything you need to know\n\nWho owns the teams competing in The Hundred?\n\nWhat is the 'designated batters' rule introduced by Big Bash League?",

    "description": "Reigning world champion Luke Littler says Phil Taylor is the greatest darts player of all-time after being branded the best ever by Luke Humphries.",
    "fullText": "Reigning world champion and world number one Luke Littler says Phil Taylor is still the greatest darts player of all-time after Luke Humphries said the youngster deserved the title.\n\nLittler became the joint-third most successful player in the Professional Darts Corporation (PDC) era of the sport by beating Humphries in the final of the Masters on Sunday night.\n\nIt led to 2024 world champion Humphries calling the 19-year-old \"the greatest darts player who has ever lived\", although Littler disagrees with that claim.\n\n\"It's really good to hear but I'm not one of those to go off and say 'yeah, I am the best' because I'm not the best,\" said Littler.\n\n\"Phil Taylor will always be the best, unless I somehow win more than him, and what he's done for the sport. So we can only see what happens in my career.\n\n\"Unless I go on and win 16 worlds and 16 Matchplays, or 17 then I'll get one over him then I'll be the best, but until someone breaks his records then he'll always be the best.\"\n\nLittler beats Humphries to win first World Masters\n\nWho is playing in Premier League Darts 2026 and what is the schedule?\n\nLittler's triumph at the Masters in Milton Keynes put him level with James Wade on 11 major PDC titles, behind only Michael van Gerwen who has 48 and 16-time world champion Taylor who has 79.\n\nAddressing his post-Masters comments at the 2026 Premier League launch, Humphries admitted he could have worded his praise of Littler differently.\n\n\"I said it in the moment, but I still stand by it, I'm not going to backtrack on it,\" said Humphries.\n\n\"Using the words 'the greatest', maybe what I meant to say was that he's the most talented player ever.\n\n\"Phil achieved so much, it's harsh not calling him the greatest, so maybe I used the wrong term, but I definitely stand by the fact that I think he's (Littler) the most talented darts player ever.\n\n\"Not just his ability to throw good darts, it's his temperament, his way of being so good under pressure, he has all of the credentials.\"\n\nGian van Veen - who lost to Littler in the 2026 World Championship final - feels Littler will continue to be the dominant force in darts for years to come.\n\nSpeaking ahead of his debut campaign in the Premier League, the Dutchman said: \"I think Luke Littler is still going to be on top of the world in five or 10 years.\n\n\"He's not unstoppable, but he's not shown too much signs of being stoppable.\"\n\nPremier League Darts 2026 fixtures, results and table\n\nLittler suggested influencer and close friend Angry Ginge will compete at qualifying school to earn a darts tour card in the future.\n\n\"I didn't go through Q-school, so I don't know what it's like to play in there, but I see some of the results every year when people are losing to 105 averages,\" said Littler.\n\n\"For Ginge himself, if he gets the luck of the draw, he could win a few games.\n\n\"But if he wants to do a few hours a day constantly, he'd obviously get better himself. We'll see him at Q-school one day.\"\n\nIt comes after two-time world champion Gary Anderson branded the involvement of certain influencers in darts as \"a load of rubbish\".\n\nSpeaking during the Masters, Anderson said: \"I don't [watch] YouTube, but I'm watching - what do you call them? - influencers. 'How to play darts' - I've never seen the bloke in my life.\n\n\"I've watched him play darts, he's absolutely rank at it, so why watch him?\n\n\"Who is he? They're actually pros and they actually know about darts, do they?\n\n\"It's a load of rubbish. So for young kids, it ain't good.\"\n\nBut Littler defended those who boast a significant social media following and are looking to make the crossover into darts.\n\n\"They're just trying aren't they,\" Littler said.\n\n\"They're trying to throw darts, trying to create a following and obviously most of them have got a few sponsors.\"",

    "description": "Scotland players tell BBC Sport their mental health suffered after they were told their contracts would end following the World Cup.",
    "fullText": "When Scotland left the pitch following their gutsy 2025 Women's Rugby World Cup quarter-final defeat by England, for some of the squad it was a moment of pride that marked how far the team had come.\n\nFor others the full-time whistle signalled the end of an emotionally damaging tournament from which some say they are still struggling to recover.\n\nReaching the last eight was the team's best performance at a World Cup in 23 years.\n\nHowever, players have since told BBC Sport that behind the scenes Scottish Rugby's management of player contracts before the tournament left them in \"probably the worst case of mental health\" they had ever had, with one saying she suffered a breakdown as a result.\n\n\"I had an actual real-life breakdown in club to one of my coaches,\" she said.\n\n\"I've been put on medication for depression because of the impact that it's had on me.\"\n\nAnother said: \"I came back from the World Cup in a hole, a shell of myself.\"\n\nIn response, Scottish Rugby said the union was \"aware of the potential challenges players faced in their mental health during this time\" and that a package of support was put in place.\n\n\"We would not question the personal experience of an individual athlete,\" the union's response continued.\n\n\"We would, however, dispute the lack of care referenced.\"\n\nBBC Sport spoke to four players involved in the World Cup and one who was in the wider Scotland training squad. Contributors wished to remain anonymous out of fear of jeopardising their future in the sport.\n\nPlayers said their contracts were due for renewal in June 2025, two months before the World Cup began in August, and that they had asked for 12-month deals beyond that to ensure job security and so they could focus on their performances at the tournament.\n\nHowever, according to those contacted, while some players in Scotland's 32-player World Cup squad were given 12-month contracts in May 2025, a quarter were told their deals would end in October, a decision one player described as a \"big shock\".\n\nAt the time, contracts ranged from £18,000 to £27,000 and in most cases were the player's main source of income. Those playing in the Premiership could also earn up to about £10,000 from their club contracts.\n\nThe players who spoke to BBC Sport said that having to compete at the World Cup knowing their jobs and international careers were potentially about to come to an end put them under huge mental strain.\n\nThey also said they were not given the proper support by Scottish Rugby to cope with the situation.\n\nSome of those who were told they would lose their funding after October had been part of the Scotland team for many years and were regularly starting international matches.\n\nOne said that \"despite clear signs\" that some were suffering with the news, \"no transitional help\" was offered by Scottish Rugby.\n\nAnother said she spent downtime between World Cup matches searching for a job.\n\nIn 2025 Scottish Rugby said it would increase the number of contracts available to players from 32 to 35 for the 2025-26 season.\n\nOne player said \"everybody understands contracts aren't going to be guaranteed every year\", before questioning why Scottish Rugby did not provide access to career advisors or psychologists for those affected.\n\nAnother added: \"It's not about contracts. It's not about resources. It's literally about treating people like human beings.\"\n\nScottish Rugby's response stated that psychological support was embedded in Scotland camps and available to all players regardless of contract status.\n\nIt said a player development manager supported players on off-field matters, including employment, and that exit meetings were held at the end of contracts to identify any potential physical or psychological support that may be needed.\n\nAsked if she felt Scottish Rugby had failed in its duty of care to players, one player responded \"without a doubt\" and referenced the death of international Siobhan Cattigan aged 26 in 2021.\n\n\"How many people need to die before you take it seriously?\" she added, addressing Scottish Rugby. \"You've clearly not learned.\"\n\nCattigan's family said undetected rugby-related brain damage caused a \"catastrophic decline\" in her health and led to her death.\n\nIn 2023 Scottish Rugby said it \"let down\" Cattigan's family and chairman John McGuigan apologised \"wholeheartedly for any anguish we caused Siobhan during her time with Scottish Rugby\".\n\nMcGuigan added at the time: \"We have listened and heeded the lessons and, in Siobhan's memory, commit to making changes to ensure we are a better organisation in the future.\"\n\nAnother player said the communication of selection decisions left her \"unbelievably unwell\", adding: \"There are loads of harsh realities of elite sport: injury and non-selection. How you manage people is more important than ever.\n\n\"You can't treat people like they're just disposable, regardless of the elite sport wheel being a forever turning one.\n\n\"We still need to have empathy. And I just didn't feel like there was much at all.\"\n\nScottish Rugby's response to this story said: \"We are very uncomfortable with this comparison to Siobhan's own tragic situation and the inference in any way that we were negligent in our support to her.\"\n\nPlayers told BBC Sport that the squad discussed boycotting one match during the 2025 Women's Six Nations - five months before the World Cup began - to try to reach a resolution with Scottish Rugby on its request for 12-month contracts.\n\nAll the players contacted say they were told contract decisions were based on performance and that they may still get a new contract should they perform well at the tournament, adding further pressure.\n\n\"It literally was a do or die lifeline,\" one player said.\n\n\"It's like I need to do everything I can on this rugby pitch, otherwise I'm not going to have a job and I'm going to struggle to pay my rent.\n\n\"When you're not sleeping, you don't have an appetite. You're just miserable most of the day. It's really hard to then put in a performance or do yourself justice.\"\n\nScottish Rugby's response said that players were told \"on a number of occasions that their standalone playing performance at the World cup was not the sole criteria for any possible change to their contract situation\".\n\nTold her contract would end in October, one player said she was on job search websites \"most nights\" during the tournament looking for jobs \"that were appropriate\" for her life as a club rugby player.\n\nShe said: \"Before you even started a job, you're trying to bargain and speak with a new employer and be like, 'Can I finish at this time?' Because I have to actually go to my other job [club rugby training].\n\n\"Then I'm going to come in tired in the morning because I've not got into bed until midnight.\"\n\nPlayers no longer on contracts can still represent Scotland, but they now fall under the country's National Team Agreement, which offers them £75 a day, not including rest days, for attending Scotland training camps.\n\nOne player said \"she can't be involved\" for that amount, adding: \"I won't be able to afford to pay my mortgage.\"\n\nAnother player said concerns over her future took \"an emotional toll\", adding: \"I didn't want to be there. I look back on it with exhaustion. It was such a big opportunity but I have nothing but negative thoughts around it.\n\n\"[After the tournament] I removed myself from social settings, any settings where people could ask me loads about rugby.\n\n\"If I did get into that environment, I would try to remove myself as quickly as possible because it made me panic and stress.\"\n\nThe player said Scotland Rugby had not been in contact about any follow-up support.\n\n\"There's been no kind of input about, 'do you need psychology?' or anything like that,\" she said.\n\nScottish Rugby detailed the steps put in place to support players:\n\nAccess to clinical psychology and a player development manager.\n\nA mandatory medical exit meeting to \"identify any potential physical or psychological support\".\n\nAn independent HR exit interview and a six-week post-contract window to access \"exit support services\" if needed.\n\nScottish Rugby said: \"From the outset of this process we recognised that players - particularly those whose contracts were due to end - would need additional support during the Rugby World Cup period and in planning their next steps.\n\n\"We believe we did deliver on our duty of care by the provision of both psychological and career guidance support throughout 2025, including in the lead-up to and during, the RWC.\n\n\"The entire playing group were out of contract in June 2025 and we made the decision to extend all contracts through to the end of October 2025 to provide a degree of stability through the RWC itself.\n\n\"The timings involved were designed to give clarity to all players as early as possible, following a timeline agreed and requested by the players themselves.\"\n\nListen to the latest Rugby Union Weekly podcast",

    "fullText": "There is a common angst among college football fans with the College Football Playoff, the length of the grind and for teams like Notre Dame, they’ve had to adjust much of what they do to get to the end.\n\nLast season, the Irish and Ohio State, and this year with Indiana and Miami, saw their seasons conclude almost two months after the regular season ended. The hope was that the CFP committee would make some adjustments to the schedule, but as we found out on Tuesday, that won’t be the case.\n\nAccording to multiple sources, the quarterfinal games for 2026 will be played on Dec. 30th and Jan. 1st, and then just over two weeks later the semifinals will be played. The scheduled is very similar for the 2027 season as well, and it just doesn’t feel like college football.\n\nAs Josh Pate pointed out, Saturday, Nov. 14th is the midpoint of the “season” which is crazy to think about. There is no need for such a large gap, and I personally hate that these games aren’t played on Saturday’s. Sure, contending with the NFL isn’t a great idea, but college football has plenty of history playing on Saturday’s. The long layoffs are unnecessary as well, as players are accustomed to just a week to prepare for the next game.\n\nHopefully some changes will be made going forward, but for at least the next two seasons, the CFP schedule will be long and drawn out.\n\nUpcoming College Football Playoff dates for the quarterfinals and semi-finals the next two years.

    "fullText": "The way of the college football world today breaks down to this: coaches don’t get many opportunities to screw up, and anything short of a national championship is considered a screw up. So, given that current logic, it’s no surprise that the Houston Chronicle recently published a column noting that Texas head coach Steve Sarkisian sits atop a steadily warming hot-ish seat after the Longhorns missed the College Football Playoff last season.\n\nFrom the Chronicle: “Steve Sarkisian is not on any hot seat by a long shot. Not after going 35-8 the past three years (with two of the losses in the College Football Playoff semifinals and three other losses to Georgia and, oh yeah, Florida). He reached the CFP two of the previous three seasons and barely missed this past season. But he’s on the warming seat. And he’s got company. Sarkisian is preparing for his sixth season at Texas after seeing 26 of his players transfer out and 19 transfer in, including the portal’s top-ranked wide receiver, two outstanding running backs and two elite linebackers. The big number of those leaving suggest Texas badly missed its evaluations on more than two dozen players or drastically upgraded all of those positions. Actually, both of those premises could be true. Sarkisian at least grasps the sense of urgency among Longhorn Nation because this isn’t a place where you want to miss the playoff two years in a row. But he’s not alone. I’d say the top five coaches with the most heat on them, in order, are Alabama’s Kalen DeBoer, Oregon’s Dan Lanning, Sarkisian, LSU’s Lane Kiffin and USC’s Lincoln Riley. None of these obviously are in a must-win situation like some others. … Those on the hottest of hot seats are Baylor’s Dave Aranda (three losing seasons in the past four years), Florida State’s Mike Norvell (coming off 2-10 and 5-7 seasons), Wisconsin’s Luke Fickell (16-21 over three years), Maryland’s Mike Locksley (1-8 in Big Ten two straight years) and South Carolina’s Shane “Did you see our first half against the Aggies?” Beamer. … Of the group needing to break through and avoid slipping backward, they just need to win big and dispel the notion that they have hit a wall and have to get past it. DeBoer, it says here, is the best coach in the nation not named Kirby Smart, Curt Cignetti or Ryan Day, yet a large percentage of Crimson Tide fans think his days might be numbered if a third year isn’t more successful after missing the CFP in Year 1 and winning one CFP game over an average Oklahoma team in Year 2. Lanning has been a borderline disaster in the CFP, getting squashed by Ohio State in 2024 and mauled by Indiana in 2025 (after dominating Texas Tech). Kiffin may or may not have a honeymoon in his first season at Baton Rouge, but he’s still not been on the sidelines for a CFP game yet in his career. Riley can sure develop a quarterback or two with Caleb Williams and Jayden Maiava, but when is the breakthrough season coming?

    "fullText": "Merino is facing a prolonged spell on the sidelines after suffering a foot injury that requires surgery, with the length of his expected absence still unclear.\n\nSpeaking after Arsenal’s Carabao Cup semi final win over Chelsea on Tuesday night, Mikel Arteta confirmed the seriousness of the issue, telling beIN SPORTS, “With Merino, yeah, he’s going to be out for months unfortunately, with a foot injury.”\n\nWhile Arsenal have indicated they remain hopeful Merino could return before the end of the season, Zubimendi’s remarks following the same match suggested the situation may be more uncertain.\n\nSpeaking about his international team mate, he said, “Well, he’s in pain. He’s a very professional person, who takes care of himself and always thinks about what’s best for the club. I know he’s the one who’s most hurt, but the damage his injury has done to the club is significant.”\n\nZubimendi went on to acknowledge the challenge Merino faces in trying to recover in time for international duty. He said, “Well, he seems fine, but everyone’s different when they get home. I understand it’s harder than it looks. I know he’ll do everything he can to make it [to the national team], and if he doesn’t, it’ll be a real shame. We’ll see what happens.”\n\nWith the World Cup due to begin on 11 June, just over two weeks after the Premier League season ends on 24 May and six days after the Champions League final, the margin for recovery is tight.\n\nZubimendi’s comments underline concerns that Merino’s campaign may already be over, despite Arsenal’s hope that he could yet return before the season concludes.",

Everyone is spinning their own, either on a VPS, or their own Mac mini.\n\nBut here's the problem: OpenClaw is brand new, and its security posture is mostly unknown. Security researchers have already found thousands of publicly available instances exposing everything from credentials to private messages.\n\nWhile OpenClaw has a Gateway component — the UI and WebSocket that controls access — there are serious issues with its password/token-based authentication:\n\nUntil recently, you could skip authentication entirely on localhost.\n\nThe GET URL token authentication mechanism is questionable for such young code.\n\nTrust needs to be earned, not assumed.\n\nIn this post, we'll secure OpenClaw using a battle-tested method with HAProxy.\n\nHAProxy’s HTTP Basic Authentication is a robust method for securing access to production systems with a username/password combination. In this guide, we’ll do the following:\n\nConfigure HAProxy with automatic TLS, basic auth, and rate limiting\n\nInstall OpenClaw and authenticate access using the basic auth credentials\n\nWe'll cover running OpenClaw on a VPS first. In a follow-up, we'll tackle Mac mini deployments with secure remote access (think Tailscale, but entirely self-hosted).\n\nWe'll also add smart rate limiting: anyone who sends more than 5 unauthorized requests within 120 seconds is blocked for 1 minute.

They'll see a 401 Unauthorized instead of 429 Too Many Requests, so attackers won't even know they've been rate-limited.\n\nYou'll need two checklist items to get started:\n\nA VPS running anywhere with Ubuntu 24.04, and a public IP address\n\nA domain/subdomain pointing DNS to the VPS public IP\n\nTo see everything in action, visit our live demo link and experiment.\n\nFirst, we'll install the high-performance HAProxy image:\n\nWe now have HAProxy 3.3 installed, with the high-performance AWS-LC library and full ACME support for automatic TLS certificates. Now, we just need to apply the configuration to make it work.\n\nEdit /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg and insert the following lines into the global section. This will set us up to use automatic TLS:\n\nNow let’s add configuration for automatic TLS using Let’s Encrypt. Edit the last line for your own domain:\n\nNext, we'll take care of the basic HAProxy configuration items. Don’t forget to change the line starting with ssl-f-use to use the correct subdomain alias from the my_files section:\n\nChange change-this-password shown in the last line to a strong password!\n\nRestart HAProxy to apply the updated configuration:\n\nNext, edit the HAProxy systemd file to make it automatically write certificates to disk. Run the following command:\n\nYou're now ready to insert the following line under [Service]:\n\nYou're now ready to install OpenClaw:\n\nThat’s it! You can now run the following command:\n\nThis process will give you your personal access token. This is still needed for proper authentication inside OpenClaw itself.\n\nYou can now visit https://subdomain.example.com/?token=<gateway token>. When doing this for the first time, you'll have to provide a username and password.\n\nYou can also configure your macOS app to talk to this OpenClaw instance. Just insert the username and password directly into the Websocket URL, as shown below:\n\nCheck your rate limiting occasionally to see who's knocking at your door:\n\nYou might be surprised how many bots are already scanning for OpenClaw instances. That 401 response is working hard. Any line item where gpc0 is higher than 5 has been limited.\n\nWhat if you accidentally lock yourself out? Simply run this command, where <key> is your IP address:bash:\n\nYou now have an OpenClaw instance that's actually secure, not just \"hopefully secure.\" Here's what's protecting you:\n\nDefense in depth – You're not relying on OpenClaw's young authentication code. HAProxy handles the security layer with battle-tested HTTP Basic Auth that's been protecting production systems for decades.\n\nStealth rate limiting – Attackers hitting your instance will see authentication failures, not rate limit errors. They won't know they've been blocked, which means they'll waste time and resources before giving up.\n\nAutomatic TLS – Let's Encrypt handles your certificates with zero manual intervention. No expired certs, no security warnings, no hassle.\n\nIf you need more authentication methods or additional security layers, check out HAProxy Enterprise load balancer. When you’re ready to control your deployment at scale, using HAProxy Fusion for centralized management, observability, and automation.\n\nJakub Suchy is the Director of Solutions Engineering at HAProxy Technologies, where he designs and prototypes solutions for application delivery and load balancing infrastructure.

Here's what we've learned throughout those four days.\n\nHAProxy Enterprise 3.2 brings next-generation security intelligence, extends its industry-leading performance, and expands the native routing and integration capabilities in HAProxy Enterprise.\n\nAWS re:Invent 2024 has officially wrapped up, but not everything that happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. Here are some key takeaways from our five days spent with AWS and app delivery enthusiasts.\n\nTikTok’s web scraper, Bytespider, is reportedly aggressively sucking up content to fuel generative AI models.

    "fullText": "Jess Fishlock says she is \"fleshing out the details\" over a potential role with Wales following her retirement from international football.\n\nWales boss Rhian Wilkinson said in December that she hoped Fishlock, who ended her stellar international career last October, would join her coaching staff for the start of World Cup qualifying in March.\n\nSeattle Reign midfielder Fishlock, 39, says her phone \"blew up\" after Wilkinson's comments – and that she got a telling off from her mother because she found out the news from the media rather than her daughter.\n\n\"My mum saw it and asked, are you working for Rhian? She got me in trouble,\" Fishlock said.\n\nOn whether she has spoken to Wilkinson and what the role might be, Fishlock said: \"I can't say, but we had a brief conversation about me being involved and what it would look like - I just didn't realise it would go public.\n\n\"But we have had conversations, we are on the same page, just fleshing out the details.\"\n\nFishlock is Wales' record appearance maker and goalscorer, having won 166 senior caps and scored 48 times.\n\nShe stepped away from Wales duty in the wake of Euro 2025, the country's first major international women's football tournament, insisting it was \"the right time\" after her farewell appearance in a friendly against Australia.\n\nOn the idea of playing some part for Wales in their 2027 World Cup qualifiers against Czech Republic and Montenegro in March, Fishlock remains coy.\n\n\"I would love to stay involved in some capacity; it wasn't a clean break - I still text the girls all the time. But we will just wait and see,\" Fishlock told BBC Sport.\n\nFishlock played 18 times for Seattle Reign last season and helped them qualify for the end-of-season play-offs in the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL).\n\nHer contribution at club level has led some in Wales to suggest she could still play a full part as Wilkinson's team attempt to qualify for the Women's World Cup finals for the first time.\n\nBut though Fishlock says she misses her international team-mates, she has reiterated that the time has come for the next generation to take over.\n\n\"People have said, if you are back you may as well play,\" she says. \"But it is still the right time not to play internationals.\n\n\"I still want to help any way I can, my experience being around might help. But no, no thoughts about coming out of retirement.\"\n\nFishlock also has no regrets about the Euros, despite Wales being outclassed in a group with France, Netherlands and eventual champions England.\n\nWales lost all three games while conceding 13 goals, leaving them with the worst group stage record in the history of the competition.\n\n\"I still look back at it with such pride and joy,\" Fishlock says. \"Getting to represent the entire country, it was even more impactful that I thought it was going to be.\n\n\"Seeing how Wales showed up for us, that was the best part of it all. As a competitor it hurt, but the whole world seeing who we are as a nation overrides it.\n\n\"I still get goosebumps coming out for the first game [versus Netherlands] and seeing the Red Wall - it will stay with me forever.\"\n\nBen Haines, Ellen White and Jen Beattie are back for another season of the Women's Football Weekly podcast.

    "fullText": "Around 2,900 athletes from more than 90 countries will compete on the ice and snow at Milan-Cortina 2026.\n\nThe world's biggest winter sports stars will descend on northern Italy from Friday 6 February and there's certain to be thrills, drama and breakout performances.\n\nBBC Sport takes a look at some of the global stars and stories to look out for.\n\nJust five days before the women's downhill event takes place in Cortina, Olympic champion Lindsey Vonn announced that she had ruptured her left anterior cruciate ligament but is still hopeful that she can compete on Sunday.\n\nVonn was airlifted to hospital in Switzerland after crashing in the final World Cup race of the season but remains determined to compete in her fifth Olympics, despite the serious injury.\n\nThe veteran skier is no stranger to a comeback having retired in 2019 because of injury before undergoing partial replacement knee surgery on her right knee and returning to the sport in 2024.\n\nThe four-time overall World Cup winner is unsure whether she will be able to compete in the super-G and team events but, as a heavy favourite for the downhill gold before suffering the injury, she is determined to make the start gate at what will likely be her last Olympics.\n\nMikaela Shiffrin is the greatest alpine skier of all time and, competing at her fourth Olympics, has said she wants to \"make peace\" with the Games following disappointment in Beijing along with serious injury and mental health struggles.\n\nThe five-time overall World Cup winner has 108 World Cup wins, securing victory in the opening five slalom events of the season which, when added to her victory in the final slalom of last season, equalled her own record of six consecutive wins in the discipline.\n\nBut the two-time Olympic champion will be targeting a return to the podium in Cortina while her fiance Aleksander Aamodt Kilde is also on the comeback trail from a bad injury.\n\nAmerican figure skater Maxim Naumov's participation in the Milan-Cortina Games could be emotional as he makes his Olympic debut after his parents were killed in a plane crash in Washington DC last year.\n\nNaumov's dream to make Team USA was one of the last things he spoke about with his parents before they were killed.\n\nHis parents, Vadim Naumov and Evgenia Shishkova, skated for Russia and were world champions in pairs figure skating in 1994.\n\nSki mountaineering, or 'skimo', is making its Olympic debut at Milan-Cortina and, while Great Britain have failed to qualify an athlete in the Games' new sport, France's Emily Harrop is the next best thing.\n\nWith English parents, Harrop could have competed for Team GB but having relocated to the French Alps as a child she opted to represent France.\n\nHarrop is well placed for an Olympic medal having finished the 2025 season with seven wins out of seven races at the ski mountaineering World Cup, winning the sprint and overall crystal globe for the fourth consecutive season.\n\nDutch speed skater Jutta Leerdam will compete in the 1,000m and 500m in Milan.\n\nA former world sprint champion, Leerdam also won a silver medal in the 1,000m at the 2022 Beijing Olympics.\n\nShe is also engaged to YouTuber-turned-boxer Jake Paul, who can often be spotted at competitions and will be cheering her on from the sidelines in Italy.\n\nTeenager Finley Melville Ives arrives in Italy as one of the most exciting prospects on the freestyle skiing circuit.\n\nIves' parents are both snowboard instructors and his twin brother followed in their footsteps, but Ives opted instead for skis from a young age.\n\nHis breakout season came last year when he claimed his first World Cup victory in Calgary then weeks later became the halfpipe world champion in Engadin, Switzerland, beating Olympic greats Alex Ferreira and Nick Goepper along the way.\n\nBorn and raised in California, freestyle skier Eileen Gu was China's poster girl for Beijing 2022, where - aged 18 - she won gold in the big air and freeski halfpipe competitions and silver in the slopestyle.\n\nIn addition to her Olympic triumphs, she is also a two-time world champion and three-time Winter X Games champion.\n\nAway from the snow, Gu is one of the most famous winter sports athletes in the world and has modelled in New York, Barcelona, Paris and at Milan Fashion Week while also studying quantum physics at Stanford University.\n\nFor the first time since Sochi 2014, the National Hockey League is permitting its athletes to participate in the Winter Olympics.\n\nNHL stars did not travel to the 2018 or 2022 Games because of financial disputes and pandemic-related complications but will return to the ice this year.\n\nIn their absence, the last two men's titles have been won by Olympic teams from Russia and Finland while the United States failed to win a medal at both events, but this could be a huge boost to their hopes of returning to the podium.\n\nEight years after winning gold as a 17-year-old in Pyeongchang, American halfpipe snowboarder Chloe Kim is going for a three-peat in Italy.\n\nShe successfully defended her title in Beijing four years ago but her preparations for Milan-Cortina have been disrupted after she dislocated her shoulder at the beginning of the year.\n\nShe said in an update on Instagram she was \"good to go\" for the Games, where she will aim to become the first woman to win three consecutive Olympic gold medals in the halfpipe.\n\nLegendary German bobsleigh pilot Francesco Friedrich arrives in Italy hoping to become the first man do the treble double - winning two and four-man gold for the third Games in a row.\n\nHe is a 16-time world champion across the two and four-man events while he has well over 100 World Cup podium finishes, claiming a 50th victory in the two-man earlier this year.\n\nGermany tend to dominate the Olympic bobsleigh events and the question is whether anyone can stop him from making history.\n\nCompeting at her sixth Games, Arianna Fontana is an 11-time Winter Olympic medallist and has won medals at her five previous appearances - including as a 15-year-old in Turin.\n\nTwenty years later, the short track skater is also aiming to compete in long track speed skating.\n\nTwo-time Olympic champion Fontana will also be one of Italy's flag bearers at the opening ceremony at the San Siro.\n\nNorwegian-born skier Lucas Pinheiro Braathen could make history in Italy by winning a first Winter Olympics medal for a South American country after he switched allegiance to compete for his mother's home country of Brazil.\n\nThe slalom and giant slalom expert retired in 2023 having competed for Norway but returned in 2025 to represent Brazil and became the first Brazilian to finish on a World Cup podium last year before claiming the country's first victory this season to add to his five for Norway.\n\nA charismatic and deep-thinking character, Braathen says that people don't believe him when he tells them he represents Brazil in alpine skiing.\n\nAge: 18 Nation: Independent Neutral Athlete\n\nRussian skater Adeliia Petrosian is one of around 20 Russian or Belarusian athletes competing under a neutral flag in Italy.\n\nThe teenager had not competed internationally at senior level until the Olympic qualifiers because of the ban on Russian athletes but is a genuine medal contender having won the qualifying event.\n\nShe is coached by the controversial Eteri Tutberidze, who coached Kamila Valieva during the Beijing 2022 Olympics. Valieva was given a four-year ban for doping after she helped Russia to win team gold before it was then revealed she had failed a drug test before the start of the Games.\n\nIlia Malinin is the only skater to have successfully landed the quadruple Axel, skating's most difficult jump, in competition, earning him the nickname the 'Quad God'.\n\nThe American, born to Olympic figure skaters Tatiana Malinina and Roman Skorniakov, is the hot favourite for the men's singles title in Italy with previous routines including seven quads and a back flip.\n\nThe reigning world champion will be competing at his first Olympics having controversially been left out of the US team in Beijing.",

    "fullText": "Who will seize the Six Nations stage and make a name for themselves over the next six weeks?\n\nHere is a player from each nation who could appear in the tournament for the first time.\n\nWatch live on BBC TV and ITV, listen to every match on BBC Radio 5 Live, Sports Extra and BBC Sounds, live text and highlights on BBC Sport website and app.\n\nThe son of hard-hitting former Tonga international Keni Fisilau, number eight Greg has been a key part of Exeter's revival this season. His ball-carrying, which combines nimble footwork and raw go-forward power has helped the 22-year-old to five Prem tries so far in this campaign.\n\nOn the other side of the ball, Greg's father didn't allow him to play touch rugby as a youngster, concerned he would pick up bad habits of trying to stop runners with his hands, rather than his shoulder.\n\nIt looks like it paid off as Plymouth-born Fisilau has made the eighth highest number of tackles in the English top flight.\n\nHis route into the England team is a tough one, however, with back row a position of particular depth for coach Steve Borthwick.\n\nBut for injury, Edogbo could easily have featured in this list for a previous Six Nations.\n\nThe 23-year-old second row spent nearly two years on the sidelines with Achilles tendon tears, but is now up to speed and could add heft to an Ireland pack that has, on occasions, looked lightweight against the very best.\n\nStanding 6ft 5in tall and weighing 20 stone, he has scored three tries in nine games this season for Munster.\n\nEdogbo was a relatively late convert to rugby, only picking up a ball as a 13-year-old after his younger brother Sean - a promising back row prospect himself - took it up.\n\nAway from the pitch, he is in the final year of an economics degree at University College Cork.\n\nWill head coach Andy Farrell dare to pair him with the similarly powerful Joe McCarthy in the engine room, or use Edogbo as a possible stand-in for his Leinster rival? Or perhaps he is earmarked for an impact bench role?\n\nIt took only seven minutes of Kalvin Gourgues' Test debut last November for the hype train to gather even more steam.\n\nThe 20-year-old, coming on as a late replacement for Gael Fickou, received the ball on his own 22-metre line and ghosted through the heart of Australia's midfield before casually slinging a dart of a pass out for Louis Bielle-Biarrey to score.\n\nWith Fickou left out of defending champions France's initial Six Nations squad, Gourgues' time seems to be coming fast.\n\nHis versatility is another string to his bow. As well as covering both midfield spots, he has previously played full-back and started at 10 for Toulouse recently.\n\nCoach Fabien Galthie has trusted him as the backline replacement in a six-two bench for the opening game against Ireland on Thursday.\n\nGourgues' prodigious rise is all the more impressive considering he spent nearly a year out of the game recently to fix a circulation problem that could ultimately have cost him his leg.\n\nHe had an artery in his foot replaced by one from his thigh and is scanned every month to ensure his blood flow is back to normal.\n\nGregor Townsend's faith in Freddy Douglas is clear. The Scotland coach handed Douglas, then 19, a Test debut before he had even made a top-level club appearance for Edinburgh.\n\nIn taking to the pitch for the final 15 minutes of a 59-21 win over Portugal in November 2024, Douglas became the youngest man to represent Scotland in more than 60 years.\n\nIt wasn't all straightforward from there, though, as an ankle injury sidelined him shortly afterwards and he was frustrated to be overlooked for the autumn internationals.\n\nHowever Douglas' low-slung jackalling ability, aided by yoga stretching that he has done since he was a teenager,, external has impressed this season and delivered a fistful of turnovers. He has also bulked up to do more of the heavy-duty ball-carrying on the gainline.\n\nHaving packed down opposite Henry Pollock at under-20 level, could he make a similarly steep climb to prominence?\n\nYou could understand Welsh fans getting nervous when one of their age-grade prospects goes west.\n\nImmanuel Feyi-Waboso, like Hennessey, was a Cardiff Schools star and Wales age-grade regular, who headed to England to combine university studies with professional rugby.\n\nBut while Feyi-Waboso switched to represent England at senior level, Hennessey is staying firmly on track.\n\nA classy centre, with physicality, quick feet and playmaking ability, he has also turned out on the wing for English champions Bath. And he has come into form at the right time.\n\nCardiff-born Hennessey ran in a try in a win over Gloucester in the most recent round of Prem matches to ensure that, after getting a first senior call-up in the autumn, the 21-year-old kept his place for the Six Nations.\n\nItaly's plans have been disrupted by injuries. As well as star back Ange Capuozzo's broken finger, they are missing back-row stalwarts Ross Vintcent and Sebastian Negri.\n\nThe latter pair's absence may provide a route into the team for the uncapped 24-year-old Samuele Locatelli, who has been in fine form.\n\nHe was voted player of the year in the Italian top flight while playing for Viadana and has risen to impress in the United Rugby Championship with Zebre.\n\nA Test appearance would cap a remarkable mid-career rise.\n\nSix Nations fixtures and how to follow on the BBC\n\nSix Nations preview & BBC pundit predictions\n\nWhat impact might 'unprecedented' Six Nations schedule have?",

The French world champion is now indeed moving to Fenerbahçe. \"Giving up is not an option for us,\" the club initially tweeted before the transfer was officially announced two hours later.\n\nAfter the Turkish club had announced at noon that the deal had failed (you can read it again here), the transfer chaos is now complete. However, since the transfer window in Turkey is open longer, the transfer can still go through.\n\nKanté signs a contract until 2028 and is part of a swap deal. In return, Youssef En-Nesyri moves to Kanté's former club Al Ittihad. According to media reports, the Saudis are paying 15 million euros, and Kanté is moving to Istanbul on a free transfer.\n\nThe Frenchman is said to have previously refused to participate in training at Al Ittihad to force his transfer. He has now succeeded in doing so.\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence. You can read the original version in 🇩🇪 here.\n\n📸 Franco Arland - 2025 Getty Images",

    "description": "The World Health Organization found that nearly 40% of cancer cases worldwide are linked to preventable causes.",
    "fullText": "A new report from the World Health Organization found that nearly 7 million cases of cancer worldwide were preventable.\n\nAnalyzing 18.7 million new cancer cases in 2022 (the most recent data available to them), researchers found that nearly 4 out of 10 cases were linked to 30 modifiable risk factors, including smoking tobacco, infections like HPV and hepatitis B, and consuming alcohol. Stomach, lung, and cervical cancer accounted for almost half of all preventable cancers in the report.\n\nThe findings are a comprehensive assessment of cancer cases globally, which vary greatly by region, so while promising, they come with limitations. \n\nThe news comes less than two weeks after it was revealed that colon cancer is now the leading cause of cancer death in people under 50.\n\nCancer can be caused by a variety of factors, including family history, genetic mutations, and environmental pollutants — all things out of our control — but some risk can be mitigated with lifestyle modifications.\n\nResearch shows that diets involving lots of ultra-processed foods (UPFs) are linked to higher cancer risk. They can increase inflammation and disrupt the gut microbiome, increasing the risk of colon and ovarian cancer.\n\nA diet rich in whole foods is the best way to go. Dr. Daniel Landau, an oncologist specializing in genitourinary cancers, previously told Business Insider that he mostly follows the Mediterranean diet, focusing on lean protein, fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, and legumes while limiting red meat (which might be carcinogenic), dairy, alcohol, sugar, and UPFs.\n\nGut-healthy foods are also important. Dr. Susan Bullman, an associate professor at MD Anderson Cancer Center who specializes in gut health and cancer research, previously told Business Insider that she eats fiber-rich foods like pears and probiotics like kefir to feed beneficial gut microbes. Eating a wide variety of plants, such as swapping out vegetable sides or sprinkling seeds on top of salads, can also improve gut health.\n\nExercise has long been associated with a reduced risk of cancer. One 2025 trial found that a strict workout regimen for preventing colon cancer resurgence than expensive treatments like chemotherapy. While scientists are still exploring the reasons why exercise is so effective at cancer prevention, they have their theories. Dr. Paul Oberstein, a medical oncologist at NYU Langone, previously told Business Insider that exercise is probably reducing inflammation, which may help slow tumor growth.\n\nDr. Sue Hwang, an oncologist who was diagnosed with breast cancer, said you should aim for 30 minutes of exercise a day, whether it's strength training or cardio.\n\nIf you can't make it to a gym every day, she said, even taking a walk or playing with your kids in a playground helps. Even vigorous daily movements, like climbing up stairs or carrying heavy groceries, can cut down cancer risk. Still, the best thing you can do is pencil in real workouts.\n\nBeing aware of early cancer symptoms, like blood in your stool for colon cancer, can help you seek screenings earlier than the recommended starting age.\n\nIt's also important to be aware of your family history, any genetic mutations like Lynch syndrome that increase risks of several cancers, or other factors like PCOS for endometrial cancer.\n\nDr. Thaïs Aliabadi, an OB-GYN who helped Olivia Munn get diagnosed with stage 1 breast cancer, said collecting data on your body, such as previous biopsies or breast density, can help you better assess your risk.",

    "description": "Up to 50 percent of species—which included 12 bird species and 4 frog species—on Aotearoa’s North Island went extinct before humans arrived",
    "fullText": "Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nA New Zealand cave has revealed million-year-old fossils, including 12 ancient bird species and four frog species.\n\nExperts believe the discovery shows how drastically New Zealand’s forest culture has shifted.\n\nResearchers said up to 50 percent of species on Aotearoa’s North Island went extinct before humans arrived.\n\nA spectacular trove of fossils in a discovered in a cave on New Zealand's North Island has given scientists their first glimpse of ancient forest species that lived there more than a million years ago. The fossils represent 12 ancient bird species and four frog species, including several previously unknown bird species. Taken together, the fossils paint a picture of an ancient world that looks drastically different than it does today. The discovery also fills in an important gap in scientific understanding of the patterns of extinction that preceded human arrival in New Zealand 750 years ago.\n\nThe team published a study on the find in Alcheringa: An Australasian Journal of Palaeontology.\n\n“This is a newly recognized avifauna for New Zealand, one that was replaced by the one humans encountered a million years later,” Trevor Worthy, lead study author and associate professor at Flinders University, said in a statement. “This remarkable find suggests our ancient forests were once home to a diverse group of birds that did not survive the next million years.”\n\nThe team located the fossils between two layers of volcanic ash preserved in the cave, each from a different major eruption, the first 1.55 million years ago and the second 1 million years ago. Many of the species represented among the fossils had already gone extinct by the time humans arrived on the island. By extrapolation, the research team estimated that between 33 and 50 percent of all species on the island went extinct during the million years before humans arrived in New Zealand, likely thanks to rapid climate shifts and cataclysmic volcanic eruptions, said Paul Scofield, study co-author and Canterbury Museum senior curator of natural history.\n\nWorthy said that “for decades, the extinction of New Zealand’s birds was viewed primarily through the lens of human arrival 750 years ago. This study proves that natural forces like super-volcanoes and dramatic climate shifts were already sculpting the unique identity of our wildlife over a million years ago.”\n\nOf all the finds, scientists might be the giddiest about discovering a new species of parrot, Strigops insulaborealis, an ancient relative of the iconic Kākāpō, a large flightless parrot known for its heft. The team believes this ancestor may have possessed the ability to fly. By analyzing the fossil discovery, the team noticed the ancient bird had weaker legs than the modern relative, implying the ancestor wasn’t quite the skilled climber as the modern-day Kākāpō. Still, the team said more research is needed to confirm that this ancient bird could fly.\n\nThe researchers also uncovered an ancestor of the modern Takahe, which opens further research into that bird. Fossils of an extinct species of pigeon closely related to the Australian bronzewing pigeons also excited experts.\n\n“The shifting forest and shrubland habitats forced a reset of the bird populations,” Scofield said. “We believe this was a major driver for the evolutionary diversification of birds and other fauna in the North Island.”\n\nScofield said that previous excavations showed life in New Zealand between 20 and 16 million years ago and that by contrast, the new discoveries offer the first evidence of life from 15 million years ago to one million years ago. “This wasn’t a missing chapter in New Zealand’s ancient history,” Scofield said, “it was a missing volume.”\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "fullText": "Earlier today, FC Barcelona officially announced that they were entering the bidding process to host the 2029 UEFA Champions League final at the renovated Spotify Camp Nou.\n\nSoon after, reports emerged claiming that the Blaugrana were also working behind the scenes to secure the hosting rights for the 2030 FIFA World Cup final at their stadium.\n\nHowever, Real Madrid are also in the race as they push to have the grand finale of the tournament played at the Santiago Bernabeu.\n\nNow, according to SPORT, Barcelona might have an edge over Real Madrid in their bid to host the 2030 World Cup final at the Spotify Camp Nou.\n\nThe 2030 World Cup will be jointly hosted by Portugal, Spain and Morocco. FIFA is currently assessing three main options for the final: Santiago Bernabeu, Spotify Camp Nou, and Hassan II Stadium in Casablanca, and will ultimately select one of these stadiums.\n\nIn this context, the Mayor of Barcelona, Jaume Collboni, reaffirmed the Catalan capital’s determination to compete to host the decisive match of the 2030 World Cup.\n\nBarcelona offers many attractions for FIFA and, although the Bernabeu appears to be the favourite, the city believes it has strong arguments to remain in contention.\n\nOne of the main elements boosting Barcelona’s chances is economic. Once the renovation is completed, the Spotify Camp Nou will have a capacity of 105,000 spectators, compared to the 84,000 seats at the Bernabeu, home of Real Madrid.\n\nThis represents a significant difference of 21,000 additional spectators. Ticket prices for major events have risen sharply in recent years. In the United States, for example, prices for the final at the MetLife Stadium on 19 July later this year have exceeded €3,000 per ticket.\n\nBased on average projections, FIFA believes it could generate more than €20 million in additional revenue if the final were held at Barcelona’s stadium rather than in Madrid. This is a substantial difference and one that could prove decisive in tipping the balance.\n\nCasablanca, for its part, is seen as less well-positioned due to the lack of the historical footballing weight associated with venues such as the Camp Nou or the Bernabeu.\n\nBarcelona and Madrid also enjoy advantages over Casablanca in terms of infrastructure and the location of their stadiums within the urban environment. The Hassan II Stadium is expected to be spectacular, but it will be located far from the city centre.\n\nHowever, Spanish cities are well established in hosting major international events, offering simpler and more reliable logistics.\n\nAdded to this is a strong footballing tradition, which FIFA is keen to highlight after recent World Cups awarded to emerging football nations such as Qatar and the United States.\n\nThe final decision will still take time, but Barcelona’s bid remains firm, as made clear by its mayor. The Catalan capital is not giving up, even if the spotlight currently appears to be focused on the Bernabeu.",

For everybody,\" a third African IOC member, Lydia Nsekera of Burundi — one of dozens of countries whose residents face restrictions entering the U.S. — later told The Associated Press of the visa uncertainty, \"even the (team) officials.”\n\nThe name of U.S. President Donald Trump was not said at the Olympic meeting, nor was reference made to his administration three days before Vice President JD Vance is due in Milan to attend the Winter Games opening ceremony.\n\nOne reference, however, seemed clear as L.A. sought to project an air of calm reassurance.\n\n“The world is complicated and unpredictable,” L.A. 2028 chairman Casey Wasserman said in a scripted speech. “Conflicts within and among nations ignite and are resolved. We are not naïve to this reality. We take it seriously and we will face it head on.”\n\nWhen more than 100 IOC members were invited to ask questions, Dagmawit Girmay Berhane of Ethiopia noted people from 175 countries have registered interest to buy tickets for the 2028 Summer Games.\n\nThe Trump administration has imposed a travel ban or limits on entry to people from dozens of countries including Zimbabwe, the home of IOC President Kirsty Coventry.\n\nWhile the U.S. government has promised exemptions for athletes and other participants of major sports events, fans and visitors face their visa applications being scrutinized.\n\n“How will you make sure there is equal opportunity for all who purchase or who register for the tickets have equal access to the visa services?” asked Berhane, a 13-year member of the IOC.\n\nFellow IOC member Gene Sykes, the president of the U.S. national Olympic body, said a State Department office in Washington D.C. is dedicated to smoothing visa issues for the Summer Games.\n\nSykes noted the World Cup in men’s soccer, which the U.S. co-hosts with Canada and Mexico this year, will test visa processing systems.\n\n“This entire process of welcoming visitors from other countries to the United States for sporting events is getting something of a trial run on a smaller basis,” he said. “It gives us the opportunity to see how do we optimize this.”\n\nFrom Djibouti, Aïcha Garad Ali asked if L.A. could appoint a similar “ambassador for visas” that worked for the 2024 Olympics: “\n\nSykes promised: “It’s certainly something we can give consideration to.”\n\nThe Olympic Games was “the singular unifying force for the world,” Wasserman said, urging his audience not to focus on “what is frightening.”\n\n“The world does not need another reason to fight with each other. It needs a reason to come together. Los Angeles is one of the most globally diverse cities on earth.\n\n“It is not just a mirror of America, it is a mirror of the world itself.”\n\nWasserman was introduced on stage with polite applause by IOC members in his first meeting with them since the release at the weekend of more government files relating to Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nThe trove of documents included flirtatious emails from 2003 between Wasserman and Epstein’s one-time girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell.\n\nIn a statement released Saturday, Wasserman expressed deep regret for the correspondence.\n\nAP Winter Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics",

    "fullText": "Tigres’s defender Aaliyah Farmer has signed a three-year contract with the Chicago Stars.\n\nChicago Stars has announced the signing of Tigres and Mexico’s women’s national team, Aaliyah Farmer. The California native’s contract runs through 2028.\n\n“Aaliyah has a unique defensive prowess, strong aerial ability and the versatility to contribute in multiple defensive roles, which we’re excited to add to our group,” said Chicago Stars FC general manager Richard Feuz. “Her promising career is just getting started. We look forward to having Chicago be part of it.”\n\nFarmer’s first professional contract was signed with the most important club in Mexico in January 2025 and one month later, she received her first call-up to the Mexican national team. Despite 2025 being her rookie year, she has become a regular for the national team, playing eight games with “El Tri Femenil” since her debut on May 30.\n\nHis career took off not only with the national team but also with his former club, Tigres. Since signing with the club, he played nine regular-season games and two playoff games in the Clausura 2025. The following season, he started in 14 of the 15 regular-season games and helped Tigres win another championship, becoming a key figure for the team. It’s also important to highlight her participation in the Concacaf W Champions Cup with Tigres, where she scored her first professional goal against the Portland Thorns.\n\n“I’m incredibly excited to join the Chicago Stars,” said Farmer. “It’s an honor to be part of such a strong club that’s building something special, and I’m excited for what’s ahead. I’m grateful for the opportunity to compete, grow and play with some incredibly talented players. I’m excited to give everything I have for this team and can’t wait to get started.”",
