    "description": "Cardiac arrhythmias are a major cause of morbidity and mortality increasing the risk of stroke, heart failure, and sudden cardiac death. Imageless electrocardiographic imaging (ECGI) provides a non invasive alternative to electrical mapping from body surface potentials, but conventional ECGI is confined to epicardial reconstructions and can miss arrhythmias originating in deeper myocardium. We address this by reconstructing three dimensional cardiac activity with a volumetric formulation that solves an inverse source problem via Green's functions, enabling full volume activation mapping and improved localization in anatomically complex regions. We evaluate the approach on simulated premature ventricular beats and on four challenging patient cases, a right ventricular outflow tract premature ventricular contraction, a left bundle branch block, a ventricular tachycardia, and Wolff Parkinson White, and additionally assess performance on an open source myocardial infarction dataset. Results show that volumetric ECGI recovers 3D activation and sharpens arrhythmia origin localization, achieving a 59.",

    "fullText": "On Saturday night, the MMA world leader returned to Paramount+ with a new UFC Fight Night card in Houston, TX. On the event’s main card, top 15 heavyweights Serghei Spivac and Ante Delija went toe-to-toe, looking to move up in the UFC heavyweight rankings.\n\nSpivac ended up getting the decision win after a violent and back-and-forth war. Let’s look at how his victory changed our latest UFC heavyweight rankings.\n\nSerghei Spivac has remained a consistent top-15-level fighter at heavyweight for the last five years. While he has lost six times inside the Octagon, his most recent setbacks have come to elite competition like Tom Aspinall, Waldo Cortes-Acosta, and Ciryl Gane. However, he also has quite a few big wins against big-name or ranked foes.\n\nHe scored another in February when he earned a very hard-fought win over talented finisher Ante Delija. His latest win stopped a potential losing skid and got him back in our top 10.\n\nFormer Brave CF star Shamil Gaziev has put together a notable run in the division. Although a doctor stoppage in 2024 gave him his first loss, the Dagestani big man is 3-1 in the Octagon, including two nasty knockouts. Gaziev is a rising heavyweight fighter to keep an eye on. However, he took a big risk in November when he okay’d a short-notice fight with Waldo Cortes Acosta. The decision backfired, and he suffered a stinging knockout loss.\n\nPFL and Contender Series veteran Rizvan Kuniev lands in our UFC heavyweight rankings after he scored the biggest win of his career with a hard-fought victory over Jailton Almeida in February. While it wasn’t pretty, he proved he can compete with top-10 talent. He will need a definitive W in his next fight if he wants to hold on to a spot in our latest rankings.\n\nMarcin Tubura has quietly been a mainstay of the UFC heavyweight rankings over the last half-decade. While he owns a 14-8 record in the company, he has grown immensely as a fighter in the last few years. He is 10-3 in his last 12, with his only losses coming to elite talents Alexander Volkov, Serghei Spivac, and current interim heavyweight king Tom Aspinall.\n\nIn March, he picked up a hard-fought win over Aspinall’s trainer partner and one of the better rising prospects in the division, Mick Parkin.\n\nSergei Pavlovich has been an absolute crushing machine during much of his UFC career. After a loss to Alistair Overeem in his debut, he reeled off six straight wins, and all of those victories came by way of a devastating knockout. However, a two-fight losing streak stopped all of his momentum. But he has righted the ship in 2025 and scored a pair of decision wins. The most recent was against Waldo Cortes-Acosta in Shanghai.\n\nDominican big man Waldo Cortes Acosta has quietly become a serious force in the heavyweight division. In his 12 bouts inside the Octagon, he has posted 10 wins, including against some notable talents in the top 15. The latest came in January at UFC 324 against fan-favorite Derrick Lewis.\n\n“Salsa Boy” showed why he is one of the more athletic and polished strikers in the division when he added a two-time challenger to his hit list inside the Octagon.\n\nWhile there have been some very tough losses in the career of Curtis Blaydes, he has remained a top-five level heavyweight for much of the last decade. At UFC 299, he had an opportunity to finally right his big-fight wrongs and did so in a major way when he handed Jailton Almeida his first loss in the Octagon.\n\nThe win moved “Razor” into a UFC 304 title fight against Tom Aspinall. Unfortunately, his big fight curse returned, and after a strong start suffered a TKO loss in Round 1. At UFC Baku, the talented wrestler returned and was able to grind out a hard-fought win over Rizvan Kuniev. But the victory did little to get him back into title contention.\n\nAlexander Volkov has been a top-level MMA heavyweight for a long time. While he has been unable to earn a UFC title shot, he has remained a stalwart of the top 10 for years. To many who watched UFC 310, he scored a victory against Ciryl Gane that should have earned him a title. However, the judges did not score it his way, and he suffered a crushing defeat to the Frenchman.\n\nIn October, he bounced back from the setback to get himself right back into title contention by scoring a very hard-fought split-decision win over top-five talent Jailton Almeida.\n\nCiryl Gane is a fantastic athlete and the most technical heavyweight striker in the sport. It is why he is consistently in the title discussion. However, his wrestling deficiencies continue to be a problem, and they showed up again in his UFC 310 clash with Alexander Volkov. Fortunately for “Bon Gamin,” he was able to escape with a decision win.\n\nThe victory earned him a title opportunity at UFC 321. However, the good luck he had against Volkov turned to bad, and his chance at winning UFC gold again was stopped after just a few minutes when he poked champ Tom Aspinall in both eyes and caused a fight-ending no-contest.\n\nEnglishman Tom Aspinall is the best heavyweight in the UFC. That became official when MMA GOAT Jon Jones decided to walk away from the sport earlier this year. The Englishman has beaten many of the best fighters in the division for the last three years and is the undisputed top big man in the eyes of most UFC fans.\n\nAfter definitively avenging the lone loss of his UFC career in the summer of 2024, he made his first defense of the undisputed title in October. Unfortunately, a nasty eye poke from opponent Ciryl Game ended the UFC 321 main event after just a few minutes. An immediate rematch early in 2026 seems likely.\n\nNew UFC Middleweight Rankings: Is Strickland vs. Chimaev Next After UFC Houston?\n\nComplete UFC Fight Night Results & Highlights: Sean Strickland Dominates In Bounce Back Win\n\nRonda Rousey Explains Why TKO Being Cheap Killed Plans For Return Fight in UFC",

Kirsty Coventry was widely seen as having good overall success at the Milan Cortina Winter Games that also gave a taste of challenges set to be tougher running into the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.  “An incredible games, and an incredible experience for me as my first in this role,” she told IOC colleagues Sunday.",
    "fullText": "MILAN (AP) — The first female president in the International Olympic Committee’s 132 years got a proper stress test in the first games of her history-making leadership.\n\nKirsty Coventry was widely seen as having good overall success at the Milan Cortina Winter Games that also gave a taste of challenges set to be tougher running into the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.\n\n“An incredible games, and an incredible experience for me as my first in this role,” she told IOC colleagues Sunday.\n\nCoventry insisted in Milan pre-games that “our game is sport,” yet playing politics was inevitable.\n\nShe started the Winter Games building “very good chemistry” with U.S. Vice President JD Vance — who was booed at the opening ceremony — and had seemed likely to close it with U.S. President Donald Trump, who she has not yet met. He did not travel as many expected for Sunday's men’s ice hockey final that the U.S. won.\n\nIn between, political pressure on Coventry was intense during the days-long drama of the Ukraine skeleton racer’s helmet memorializing athletes and coaches killed in the Russian military invasion.\n\nCoventry’s face-to-face, trackside meeting with Vladyslav Heraskevych early Feb. 12 that failed to avert his disqualification has helped define her leadership style.\n\nHer tears in a subsequent meeting with international media is a powerful image of her presidency — though Heraskevych himself wasn't impressed.\n\nThe next day, at a news conference in Milan, a list was detailed to Coventry of IOC issues with its own finances, plus future Olympic hosts, their officials and governments.\n\n“It’s a job only a woman could do,” she said with relish, “and I’m looking forward to continuing to do it.”\n\nThe Ukrainian political strategy had been “a baptism of fire” for the new president, the former IOC marketing director Michael Payne told The Associated Press on Sunday.\n\nCoventry going directly to engage Heraskevych in sports diplomacy was a shift from her predecessors Thomas Bach and Jacques Rogge, who also were Olympic athletes.\n\nAt age 42, having swum for Zimbabwe as recently as the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics, Coventry is just 13 months older than a huge star at these games, Lindsey Vonn.\n\n“We saw at these games her values and her humanity,” IOC member Tricia Smith, a silver medalist in rowing for Canada at the 1984 Los Angeles Games, told The Associated Press. “And I think that’s exceptionally positive for the Olympic Movement as we move forward.”\n\nThe 72-year-old Bach sat next to Coventry again Sunday at the IOC’s meeting: He in suit and tie, she in smart casual knitwear that is becoming her signature look.\n\nThe generational change is clear for the Olympics, which wants and needs to stay relevant with athletes who are increasingly their own tech-savvy brands.\n\nAfter seven years as sports minister in the government of Zimbabwe, Coventry was no management rookie.\n\nOne of her four IOC vice presidents, Pierre-Olivier Beckers, said in Milan that people who had thought she was too young to lead were wrong.\n\n“I think she’s maturing at an incredible pace,” Beckers told reporters, adding she was “a joy for people like me to work with. Her ability to surround herself, to listen to people, all advisors, to make up her mind quickly, is just astonishing.”\n\nOne aspect of Coventry's management style that drew negative reactions, online and in Milan, was criticizing staff in her last set-piece media event Friday.\n\nCoventry is one of the more transparent leaders among the Olympic sports bodies mostly based in Switzerland. She had four scheduled news conferences in Milan within 20 days, plus an impromptu media session after meeting Heraskevych.\n\nOn Friday, she publicly lost patience when asked about news developments that she said she was unaware of — on the topics of Russian doping, an Olympic bid from Germany, and FIFA president Gianni Infantino attending Trump's Board of Peace launch Thursday.\n\nClearly frustrated, Coventry eventually said “maybe someone needs to be dismissed because I’m not aware of that either” and asked of her media team: \"What happened guys? Where are we?”\n\nCoventry has a big 2026 with signature policy to be decided under the “Fit for the Future” banner. Reviews are ongoing into how the IOC picks games hosts, Olympic sports and sponsor programs, plus protecting female sports.\n\nKey meetings are in the IOC's Swiss home city Lausanne on June 24-25 with more likely late in the year.\n\nThe next Olympics is a constant focus. There is a pressing issue around L.A. Games organizing chief Casey Wasserman, that was persistent in Milan over news of his historic ties to Jeffrey Epstein’s former girlfriend, and Coventry will soon need to meet Trump.\n\n“She can leave (Milan) with a massive sigh of relief. The brand is in robust health,” Payne said Sunday.\n\nHe warned of more politicization of Olympic sports worldwide before the next Olympics in the United States. The IOC winning the appeal brought by Heraskevych will help set limits on how athletes express views.\n\n“L.A. will be a completely different dimension,” Payne said. “It’s going to be complicated, to put it mildly.”\n\nAP Winter Olympics coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics",

    "fullText": "T20 World Cup, Super 8s Group 2, Pallekele\n\nEngland 146-9 (20 overs): Salt 62 (40), Jacks 21 (14); Wellalage 3-26,\n\nSri Lanka 95 (16.4 overs): Shanaka 30 (24); Jacks 3-22\n\nA superb bowling performance breathed life into England's T20 World Cup campaign as Harry Brook's side beat co-hosts Sri Lanka by 51 runs in their opening match of the Super 8s phase.\n\nEngland remained unconvincing with the bat in posting 146-9 but their bowlers took full advantage of a tricky surface to knock over their hosts for 95.\n\nJofra Archer dismissed key batter Pathum Nissanka and fellow opener Kamil Mishara but even more impressive were the three wickets for all-rounder Will Jacks inside the powerplay.\n\nJacks, who has struggled with the ball at times in this tournament, removed Kusal Mendis and Pavan Rathnayake in consecutive deliveries and added the scalp of Dunith Wellalage as Sri Lanka crumbled to 34-5 under the pressure of a chase.\n\nAfter Kamindu Mendis chipped back a catch to Liam Dawson and Dushan Hemantha hit his own wicket, Jacks combined with Tom Banton to complete a fine relay catch on the boundary to dismiss Dasun Shanaka, Sri Lanka's captain and the last recognised batter, for 30.\n\nThat England's batting remains far from perfect is pushed to another day. Jos Buttler made a tortured seven from 14 balls, Jacob Bethell fell to a wild slog and Tom Banton ran himself out.\n\nPhil Salt's 62 and 21 from Jacks, who was the next highest scorer in a fine all-round display, were crucial.\n\nEngland play Pakistan on Tuesday and New Zealand on Friday in their remaining Super 8s matches.\n\nOne win should be enough to qualify for the semi-finals.\n\nSalt and Jacks dragged England to a score but Sri Lanka still appeared favourites at halfway.\n\nThough England defended 128 on this ground in a series before the World Cup, Sri Lanka chased 182 with two overs to spare to beat Australia here in the group stage.\n\nThis surface was trickier than that one. Its sticky nature and decent turn offered assistance to the spinners and Jacks capitalised.\n\nAfter conceding four from an accurate first over, Jacks got one to grip to take the leading edge of Mendis. Rathnayake charged him a ball later and was caught skying a hideous swipe.\n\nBrook also used Archer for three consecutive overs at the start.\n\nArcher bowled at high pace and had Nissanka, who scored a brilliant hundred against Australia, caught at deep square leg before finding the edge of Mishara.\n\nHemantha's dismissal – he hit his stumps with his bat flapping at Jamie Overton – summed up a poor Sri Lanka batting display, not that England will care.\n\nAfter nervy wins over Nepal, Scotland and Italy in the group stage, they are closing in on a place in the last four.\n\nStill we wait for England's batting to truly fire at this tournament.\n\nWith his feet stuck and best form seeming distant, Buttler missed three deliveries and toe-ended another before being pinned in front by Wellalage's left-arm spin on the reverse sweep.\n\nOnly 37 runs came from the powerplay, with Bethell caught at short third trying to hit Maheesh Theekshana over mid-wicket.\n\nAs the pressure to score rose, Banton took on a single that was never there and Brook was trapped tentatively on the crease for 14.\n\nThe highest partnership of the match was 26 between Salt and Sam Curran. Battling cramp from the ninth over, Salt did not find top gear and Curran holed out at long-on\n\nJacks targeted the off side smartly and struck four important fours and Overton clubbed a six in the last over.\n\nThere remains room for improvement but England's tactic of favouring batting depth - Jacks was at number seven and Overton nine here – is proving to be smart as the top order struggles.\n\nT20 World Cup: England complete convincing win over Sri Lanka - as it happened\n\nTMS podcast: Bowlers bail out England as they beat Sri Lanka\n\nIs Buttler's form a worry?

    "fullText": "In his latest BBC Sport column, England World Cup winner Matt Dawson discusses what went wrong in England's record home defeat by Ireland and what areas could be improved for the final two rounds.\n\nRemember two years ago when England were going to get beaten at home by 40 points against Ireland?\n\nThe narrative in this tournament rarely plays out as expected. Teams overperform and sides crack under pressure. That is the beauty of the Six Nations.\n\nThat predicted thumping in 2024 never happened. Instead, England stunned Grand Slam-chasing Ireland with the last play of the game to win 23-22.\n\nRoll on two years, when expectations were much lower, and Ireland delivered that record away win.\n\nAndy Farrell's side arrived with the mentality to deliver a historic victory, bringing the tactics and accuracy needed to win.\n\nThe 21-point difference at Allianz Stadium came down to tactics and decision-making. England made a load of mistakes, and some of that came down to trying to play the match like a game of chess.\n\nThe issue with doing that is that they could not change on the hoof how they wanted to play.\n\nThe tactical battle between coaches Andy Farrell and Steve Borthwick was won by Farrell, but England need players on the field who are able to change tactics as they go.\n\nThey have struggled with sticking to the script instructed to them by Borthwick, with any changes then being delivered at half-time.\n\nGiven the talent and winning run, I was expecting England to adapt better.\n\nWhy do teams play with a high tempo against them? Because England are good.\n\nIt looked like they thought another team could not replicate Scotland's attacking play from last week.\n\nIt was very unlike England, but that is what happens when you get stressed.\n\nThey lacked the senior Lions mentality to get out of sticky situations. Over the last two weeks, where were those decision-makers?\n\nThe defence and attack needed adjusting in the first quarter. They waited 40 minutes and had conceded 22 points.\n\nEngland have good leadership, but Maro Itoje - who will only get better with more minutes under his belt - cannot do it all on his own.\n\nHe wants the leaders around him to step up in their roles, especially given he is not finishing games at the moment.\n\nSomeone like Ollie Chessum can jump in with an idea of how to fix the line-out. Freddie Steward, who can see the flow of the game from the back, could offer input on where the space to attack is.\n\nThe squad has not changed from the 12-game winning run. They are a group of very good rugby players.\n\nEllis Genge was honest and brave in his assessment, but I do not feel let down by England.\n\nThey are capable of winning in Rome and Paris.\n\nThe loss should not be the reason for a load of changes for the Italy game, as Borthwick's continuity in selection is what brought success.\n\nDespite a rest week coming, a three-game block of games is very taxing and England have the depth available.\n\nI would freshen up the half-backs and bring in Fin Smith and Jack van Poortvliet.\n\nAlex Mitchell's injury may open that door for Van Poortvliet, but I want to give a new opportunity to key decision-makers in an away Six Nations game.\n\nSmith is a confident player and, having been England's starting 10 in last year's Six Nations, he will want to prove his ability to adapt in-game.\n\nFull-back George Furbank is another intelligent player who can spot space in attack, and I want to see him as he will also be chomping at the bit to prove his worth.\n\nI would then go Tom Roebuck and Henry Arundell on the wings. A free-flowing game in Rome suits their attacking attributes.\n\nThe back row, too, I felt lacked some balance against Ireland.\n\nBringing Henry Pollock and all his energy off the bench is a play that I would go back to.\n\nA new outlook and perspective from players who have been outside the pressure cooker may well bring long-term benefits.\n\nSix Nations fixtures, results, standings and how to follow on the BBC\n\nIs Borthwick under pressure after nightmare defeat?\n\nRuthless Ireland hit record away win over England\n\nRuthless Ireland beat England, & Scotland come back in Cardiff\n\nNow the narrative is that they did not win big away games in 2025. They beat what was in front of them, and they have proved themselves to be a good side.\n\nLike a good golfer, they are tinkering that bit too much. That has enormous ramifications.\n\nThe progress up until the Scotland game was good enough for a World Cup, but they are trying lots of different things that they do not need at the moment.\n\nOff the back of a tough 2024, England used being the underdog to their advantage.\n\nThey won in Argentina with a young squad and beat New Zealand in November. It becomes trickier when you are known to be one of the top sides.\n\nEngland were getting into that bracket as they blew Wales away, and the rest of the Six Nations knew they were going to have to come up with something superhuman to beat them.\n\nThat is exactly what has happened, and Borthwick's side must deal better with higher expectations.\n\nThe pressure is also different, as every breath for the past month has been about the Six Nations and possibly winning it. That is draining and tiring.\n\nFinding the energy as an underdog to play above yourself is easier than finding that spark within yourself when you are expected to win.\n\nEvery single year you will get these types of results, and that will not change.\n\nIt is not out of the question that England go to Paris and beat France. What is the narrative then?\n\nNothing said Ireland could win against them by 20-odd points - and it happened.",

I confess to using both of these programs, but I’ve noticed that, well, it’s as if they’re trying to please, with statements like “You’re absolutely right, Jeff,” and “That’s pretty much right.” Often, when I ask, “Would you mind thinking for a bit longer on that?”, I then get another response saying: “Jeff, you’re absolutely right, again, to query that result. It turns out I was a bit hasty in my reply …”\n\nIf the world runs even more on information filleted out from the sump of the internet by LLMs, what are the consequences? Can we look forward to a future in which AI is more concerned with appearing sympathetic (getting good reviews?) than being factual? Er, a bit too human?

We're pumped for the bowling crew, they've been working hard. The partnership [between Miller and Brevis] steadied the ship and kept us in the game. We looked at where we could run hard and our batting in the middle was the difference.\n\n\"We're going to have to enjoy this but park it and get our minds sharp [to face West Indies]. We don't want to take confidence and good vibes for granted.\"\n\nIndia captain Suryakumar Yadav: \"You can't win the game in the powerplay, but you can lose it. We lost too many wickets in the powerplay.\n\n\"Hopefully we bat well, bowl well and field well [against Zimbabwe]. I hope we play the same brand of cricket, nothing changes.\"\n\nTest Match Special commentator Prakash Wakankar: \"You see the satisfaction but also the steely determination on the faces of the South Africa players. Right from the toss, there wasn't the customary smile from Markram, who was very serious and focused.\n\n\"The disappointment from the captain after getting out really said a lot. It clearly shows that South Africa came here with a plan and executed it with ruthlessness to deliver a result that will be very, very well received by their supporters.\"\n\nT20 World Cup: South Africa complete impressive win over India - as it happened\n\nHow South Africa conquered Test cricket in 2025\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "description": "Will Jacks, labeled England's 'Jack of all trades' by Harry Brook, delivers again at the T20 World Cup to keep the winter of a lifetime rolling on.",
    "fullText": "Will Jacks has already had quite the winter.\n\nHe made his Ashes debut in Australia, got engaged to his partner Ana in Sydney and now, at times single-handedly, is taking England towards the T20 World Cup semi-finals.\n\nWhich would he rank as his best moment?\n\n\"That is not for me to answer,\" laughed his captain Harry Brook.\n\n\"But he has had three man-of-the-match awards this World Cup and I don't think he has played his best cricket yet.\"\n\nBrook and Jacks go back a long way.\n\nThey were 15-year-olds when they played against each other at the famous Bunbury Festival – Jacks playing for the London schools' side and Brook the north of England.\n\nJacks made 46. Brook took two wickets.\n\nFour years later they were roommates with the Under-19s and now Jacks is keeping Brook's first World Cup campaign as captain afloat.\n\nWhen this tournament began with questions around Brook's suitability to be captain after off-field controversy in Wellington, it was Jacks who was put forward to speak to the media to defend his mate.\n\nAgainst Nepal, the right-hander hit 39 not out, without which England would have suffered one of the great World Cup shocks, and his first T20 fifty against Italy, a powerful 53 not out, pushed a tight game out of the reach of the Italians in their valiant chase.\n\nHis 21 with the bat and three wickets with the ball against Sri Lanka was another gift for Brook, coming on the captain's 27th birthday.\n\nEngland now sit one win from a World Cup semi-final.\n\n\"He is a very competitive lad,\" said Brook. \"He was annoyed when he got out tonight.\n\n\"After his first over he said 'I always bowl better when I am annoyed'. That was one of the reasons I kept him on.\n\n\"He is that perfect player. He is the Jack of all trades who can do everything.\"\n\nJacks' Ashes was not all fairytale proposals below Sydney Harbour Bridge.\n\nOff the field, he was one of the England players plastered across the front page of the Australian newspapers with a pint in hand in Noosa.\n\nOn it, he struggled with his two wickets in the third Test against Australia in Adelaide costing 212 runs. Across the series he took six wickets for 394 runs.\n\nJacks' stubborn batting in Australia did show a side of his game that hinted at promise and now he is thriving as England's T20 man for all seasons.\n\nBacked by Brook on Sunday he was asked to open the bowling for England for the first time since a match against Australia in Barbados at the last T20 World Cup.\n\nThat day, after what Jos Buttler later described as a \"gut feel\", Aussie opener Travis Head – the man who cut and pulled him into submission in Adelaide – sent him onto the Kensington Oval roof in an over that cost 22 runs. England's campaign never recovered.\n\nThis time his opening over cost only four, even that a boundary courtesy of a misfield.\n\nBrook said it was a \"last-minute\" decision to give Jacks the new ball, the logic being that with a shorter boundary to the left-handed Kamil Mishara's leg side it was better to have Jacks' off-spin turning the ball away.\n\nTypically, after that good first over, Jacks dismissed two right-handers in his next – the dangerous Kusal Mendis poking and chipping back a catch and Pavan Rathnayake charging and slicing a catch high to the off-side ring.\n\n\"Rathnayake's been a very good player for them, and probably their best player of spin - the way that he runs down the pitch,\" Brook said.\n\n\"To get him out first ball was a very crucial part in the game for us.\"\n\nControl was something often lacking with Jacks' off-spin during the winter but here he delivered his most accurate spell.\n\nBowling four overs on the spin, he pitched 91% of his deliveries on the stumps or in the channel - the highest of any England match of his career.\n\nHis only bad ball, one which slipped from his sweaty hand, was pulled for six by Dasun Shanaka but later Jacks got his revenge by being the initial catcher in a brilliant relay grab with Tom Banton.\n\nIf his first three wickets put England on course for victory, the dismissal of Shanaka confirmed it.\n\n\"I love getting the responsibility with the ball,\" Jacks said.\n\n\"It encourages me to get into the game and perform better.\n\n\"[Opening the bowling] is not foreign for me. And with a surface like that, I come in knowing what to do.\"\n\nJacks has been given the nickname of Slim Shady by some England players during this tournament – a reference to his pre-tournament haircut and bleached blond hair. In the dressing room he has even been asked to rap.\n\nBrook appears happy with his Jack of all trades. He is keeping this winter rolling on.\n\nEngland bowlers secure crucial win over Sri Lanka\n\nMen's T20 World Cup tables, top run-scorers & wicket-takers\n\nStats battle: Can you beat our new T20 World Cup game?",

    "fullText": "It has been a while since Welsh rugby fans have woken up on a Sunday morning after a rugby international feeling agony and hope in equal measure.\n\nBut that is what happened this weekend after Wales' excruciating 26-23 Six Nations defeat against Scotland in Cardiff.\n\nThe agony represents Wales losing - after leading 20-5 and 23-12 - to a Scotland side that only held the advantage for the final six minutes of the game.\n\nThe hope comes from Wales producing the finest performance of the Steve Tandy era, one that shows what could be possible.\n\nYes, it was a 24th defeat in 26 internationals since October 2023 and a 14th successive Six Nations loss in a record stretching back three years.\n\nYes, Wales have slipped to 12th in the world rankings and are still facing another Wooden Spoon with matches to follow against a rejuvenated Ireland and then Italy.\n\nAnd the off-the-field disarray that has engulfed Welsh rugby still exists and will continue to rumble on in the coming weeks.\n\nHowever, for a couple of hours on Saturday evening in the Principality Stadium, in a magically mad occasion against the Scots, the Wales team and fans recreated the epic experience that has been on show so often in the past.\n\nAnd offered hope of what it could look like again in the future.\n\nWales' late loss 'gut-wrenching' - Lake\n\nScotland show 'bottle' & 'grit' in 'ugly' Cardiff win\n\n'Scotland's terrible beauty reverses the narrative on extraordinary day'\n\nFor the opening hour, Wales finally had some attacking momentum with ball-carriers powering over the gain line.\n\nFront-row duo Rhys Carre and captain Dewi Lake had arguably their most effective games for Wales, while Scarlets centre Eddie James provided the midfield momentum with a series of thundering charges in what could prove a coming-of-age performance.\n\nThen there was Aaron Wainwright. The Dragons talisman was immense for a second successive week, continuing his terrific tournament, despite Wales' adversity.\n\nThe back rower has played two games at number eight and featured at blind-side flanker against France.\n\nNo matter where he has been asked to play, Wainwright has consistently been Wales' most effective performer and was the highest carrier with 22 against Scotland, five more than Lake.\n\nThe attacking intent was orchestrated expertly by returning fly-half Sam Costelow, who excelled after replacing Dan Edwards.\n\nCostelow being helped off the field injured in the second half was one of the saddest sights of the day.\n\nWales' defence was still not perfect and they will need a separate specialist coach after the tournament so Tandy is not having to undertake two roles.\n\nBut it was a significant improvement on the 15 tries and 102 points conceded in the opening two heavy defeats against England and France.\n\nIn Tandy's first six games in charge Wales yielded 302 points and 42 tries.\n\nAdd 26 points and four more tries against Scotland - but it was a commendable effort against the wave of Scottish second-half attacks.\n\nIndustrious locks Dafydd Jenkins and Ben Carter, in his first Six Nations start after replacing Adam Beard, topped the tackle charts with 22 each.\n\nForaging flankers Alex Mann and James Botham managed to gain some turnover penalties, which had been sorely lacking in the first two matches.\n\nWing Josh Adams was outstanding in the opening exchanges with a telling try-saving tackle on Huw Jones and vital interception.\n\nAdams' continued selection has received criticism but in an inexperienced backline, what was evident was the amount of organising and communication he was providing, especially in defence.\n\nEnglish referee Matt Carley was officiating in his 50th international and his name popped up quite prominently on social media after the game by Welsh fans who felt hard done by.\n\nThey pointed to a number of decisions which they felt could have gone Wales' way.\n\nThis included Scotland number eight Matt Fagerson being offside and obstructing Wales replacement prop Archie Griffin in the build-up to George Turner's match-winning try from a driving maul.\n\nSome Welsh fans, and former Wales fly-half Jonathan Davies, also felt there was a harsh penalty reversal for a Tomos Williams' illegal clearout at a ruck, when Wales could have kicked three points to extend the lead to seven.\n\nTandy afterwards said he thought that decision was a fair call and refused to blame any decisions for Wales' defeat.\n\nAfter all, Scotland won the second half 21-6 and were the dominant attacking force after half-time.\n\nThe major issue Wales will look at will be concentration for the Darcy Graham try.\n\nIt was inspired by a moment of magic from Finn Russell who capitalised on Wales sleeping in defence from a restart.\n\nThe blame cannot lie with the ball boy or girl who efficiently presented the ball on the halfway line for Russell to kick off quickly.\n\nThey were merely doing their job, while Wales' players were not.\n\nWhether the blame lies with Botham, who watched a ball bounce over his left shoulder, or new cap Gabriel Hamer-Webb who was outpaced by Darcy, will be decided in the post-match review.\n\nWhoever shoulders the responsibility, it proved a major turning point in the game as it reduced the deficit to four points and enabled the visitors to dominate the final quarter.\n\nTandy will also be looking for more impact from his bench after the second-half replacements, prop Nicky Smith aside, failed to match the intensity of the starting side.\n\nThis is compared to Scotland, whose introduced players contributed significantly to the victory.\n\nWales' discipline is still an issue with centre Joe Hawkins picking up a yellow card for an early high tackle, an 11th sin-binning in seven games during Tandy's tenure.\n\nHowever, that is progress from the 16 penalties and four yellow cards conceded just three weeks ago against England.\n\nWales also need to utilise to fins an effective way of maximising Louis Rees Zammit's attacking ability after his switch from wing to full-back.\n\nThe Principality Stadium crowd of 57,744 against France, the lowest in Cardiff in the Six Nations era was criticised. Rightly so.\n\nSix days later, the Cardiff cauldron was completely different as 70,000 witnessed a scintillating spectacle on and off the field.\n\nSome of that was down to Wales' marked improvement, with the home fans starved of any success or expectation during the past couple of years.\n\nAfter all, Wales have now suffered 11 successive Six Nations defeats in Cardiff with the most recent success against Scotland four years ago in February 2022.\n\nBut Wales, led by the inspirational Lake, got the Principality Stadium rocking.\n\n\"The support was incredible,\" said Tandy.\n\n\"There's lots of questions asked about the crowds, but they were unbelievable.\n\n\"Everyone felt it. The players gave them something to cheer about, but ultimately they got behind the team. It's a snapshot of what we want to be.\"\n\nThe challenge, for everybody involved in Welsh rugby, will be to replicate this environment in the final game of the tournament against Italy on 14 March.\n\nThe match has the same early evening kick-off as the Scotland showdown.\n\nThis past weekend cannot be a one-off if Wales are to be inspired to that overdue and elusive Six Nations success in front of their own fans.",

    "fullText": "A federal grand jury in Michigan has indicted a third defendant in an alleged forced labor conspiracy tied to the Kingdom of God Global Church — a sprawling ministry that prosecutors say used coercion, abuse and threats of divine punishment to run a multi-state call center operation that brought in roughly $50 million in donations over more than a decade.\n\nKathleen Klein, 53, known within the church as \"Prophetess,\" was named in a superseding indictment returned Feb. 11 in the Eastern District of Michigan, the U.S. Department of Justice announced (1). She joins co-defendants David Taylor and Michelle Brannon, who were first indicted in July 2025 and arrested the following month in a coordinated nationwide takedown by the FBI.\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\n\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\n\nRobert Kiyosaki says this 1 asset will surge 400% in a year — and he begs investors not to miss its ‘explosion’\n\nKlein is charged with conspiracy to commit forced labor, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. Taylor, the church's founder, and Brannon, its executive director, each face up to 20 years per count on charges of forced labor, conspiracy to commit forced labor and money laundering conspiracy. All three defendants have denied the allegations.\n\n\"This case reflects the gravity of forced labor schemes that strip victims of their basic human rights and subject them to physical and brutal psychological abuse,\" Assistant Attorney General A. Tysen Duva said in a statement. \"Combating human trafficking is a top priority for the Department of Justice. We will relentlessly pursue those who facilitate and profit from forced labor and fight to obtain justice for survivors.\"\n\nThe superseding indictment also added new allegations that Taylor frequently requested and received sexually explicit photographs and videos from female church workers — some of whom prosecutors say were afraid to refuse.\n\nThe church, formerly known as Joshua Media Ministries International, was headquartered in Taylor, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit. According to court filings, Taylor referred to himself as an \"Apostle\" and claimed to be Jesus Christ's \"best friend\" and \"second in command\" (2). The Justice Department says the church operated at least nine call centers across Michigan, Missouri, Florida and Texas (3).",

    "description": "Rain washed out the Pakistan vs New Zealand Super 8 match, with both teams sharing one point and the semi-final race wide open. Pakistan must beat England and Sri Lanka to reach five points and likely qualify, while any loss could make their chances depend on other results.

    "fullText": "As a result, both teams shared one point, which has made the race for the T20 World Cup 2026 semi-finals much more complicated.\n\nThis was an important game for both sides because a win would have given them a strong start in the Super 8 stage. \n\nInstead, Pakistan and New Zealand now have only two matches left to push for a top-two finish in their group.\n\nFor Pakistan, the situation is simple but tough. They will next play England and Sri Lanka. If Pakistan manage to win both matches, they will reach five points, which should be enough to book a place in the semi-finals. \n\nHowever, if they lose even one game, their chances become tricky. One win and one loss would leave them on three points, and then they would have to depend on other teams’ results. \n\nIf Pakistan lose both remaining matches, they will be knocked out of the tournament.\n\nNew Zealand are in the same boat. \n\nThe rain has given them a point, but they will still need wins in their upcoming matches to stay in control of their destiny. \n\nAny slip-up could pull them into a tight battle with the other teams in the group.\n\nSince this was the first Super 8 match for both Pakistan and New Zealand, the full picture will only become clear once all teams have played at least one game. \n\nBoth sides were seen as favourites to reach the semi-finals, but the washout has made their path harder and kept the group wide open.",

    "fullText": "Catarina Macario was immaculate last year. The leading goalscorer for the USWNT showcased her ability to hold up play, connected across generations with international teammates and found the back of the net eight times in 10 appearances with two assists. Three of those goals came in the last two months of 2025 as the U.S. finished the year with two friendlies against Italy.\n\n“It has been a good year. It has been a year that I’ve tried to find some consistency,” Macario told TNT Sports at the time. “I’m still trying to find my rhythm and whatnot, but it’s been good.”\n\nTwo months into the year, however, and the picture looks different.\n\nMacario picked up another injury in late December that has kept her out of Chelsea’s Champions League squad, as well as the latest U.S. roster for next month’s SheBelieves Cup. That Macario is currently unavailable for selection has only exacerbated the question of her professional future; the 26-year-old’s contract with Chelsea expires in four months.\n\nMacario’s decision about her future carries high stakes. Here is what we know so far.\n\nChelsea face Arsenal in the quarterfinals of the Women’s Champions League next month. The reigning WSL champions look to right the ship against the reigning continental champions after a period of poor form and internal tension among Chelsea’s top brass.\n\nMacario, though, won’t be playing. She was left off Chelsea’s roster for the tournament, which was published on Feb. 7, due to a heel injury.\n\nThe Brazilian-American striker’s future has been a prolonged topic of discussion over the past two months. Her contract with Chelsea is set to expire this summer and with the World Cup in Brazil 16 months away, Macario’s next move will be critical.\n\nThe forward, who has been dealing with injuries for much of the season, last featured for Chelsea on Dec. 10 in a Champions League match against Roma. The week prior, she was with the U.S. for a pair of friendlies against Italy in Florida, scoring three goals across the two fixtures.\n\nShe has not been on the pitch since.\n\n“Cat had some heel pain before Christmas and she’s managing that,” Chelsea manager Sonia Bompastor said on Jan. 16 ahead of the FA Cup game against Crystal Palace. “She’s progressing in her rehab and heading in the right direction, but won’t be available for the weekend.”\n\nQuestions continued as Macario was left off of the USWNT roster for the SheBelieves Cup, which runs from March 1-7 and features matches against Argentina, Canada, and Colombia.\n\n“My understanding is that there has been a heel injury that I think she’s getting closer and closer with every day, but she’s not available for selection yet at Chelsea,” U.S. head coach Emma Hayes said after announcing her roster. “I don’t know when that is going to come. I don’t know if it’s one week, two, three weeks away, but I know she’s not available for selection.”\n\nHayes has experimented heavily with the U.S. roster; she capped 44 players in 2025 alone and awarded 16 debuts. While that phase of her development is over for this cycle, Hayes said she still sees Macario fitting into her depth chart, even while injured.\n\n“Honestly, if Cat Macario and Sophia Wilson were fit for selection, they would have been selected as the nines,” she said, adding an update for fellow forward Wilson, who missed 2025 on the field while pregnant with her first child.\n\nChelsea have had a turbulent season domestically. They sit third in the WSL, trailing front-runners Manchester City by nine points. Their 5-1 loss to the Manchester side on Feb. 1, which followed a 2-0 loss to Arsenal on Jan. 24, raised serious concern over Bompastor’s future with the club; the French manager had never lost two consecutive matches in her coaching career.\n\nBefore joining Chelsea, Bompastor coached OL Lyonnes, where Macario began her professional career. In 2021, the two won a Champions League title together. Macario signed with Chelsea in 2023 when Hayes was still managing the team. When Hayes departed for the USWNT in 2024, Chelsea hired Bompastor to replace her.\n\nBompastor guided the team to a domestic treble last season, but this season has been significantly more challenging on and off the pitch, with some sources describing to The Athletic a power struggle behind the scenes. On Feb. 6, Chelsea and Bompastor agreed to a contract extension that will run until 2030, a vote of confidence by the front office. Three days later, the team parted ways with former head of women’s football Paul Green, who had been with the club since 2013 and worked closely with Hayes.\n\nStill, it is unclear whether or to what extent these realities factored into Macario’s decision to reject Chelsea’s contract extension offer. As she enters what could be the peak of her career with the 2027 World Cup on the horizon — Macario’s first opportunity to win a major trophy with the U.S. — her next club will play a key role in her trajectory.\n\nMacario moving back to the U.S. for the first time since she played at Stanford University is a possibility, as The Athletic previously reported. The San Diego Wave are located in the area where she grew up after moving to the U.S. from Brazil when she was 12 years old.\n\nOne source told The Athletic that Macario had turned down Chelsea’s contract extension offer and said she also received offers from other European clubs. In order to protect relationships, the source spoke with The Athletic on the condition of anonymity. Another source said the San Diego Wave were front-runners to sign her.\n\nOn Feb. 13, ESPN reported that the Wave were in advanced negotiations to sign Macario. They reiterated that a deal had not yet been signed, but that Macario had expressed enthusiasm at the prospect of returning home and playing in the NWSL for the first time. The NWSL team declined to comment when approached by The Athletic. Macario is yet to publicly voice an opinion on her preferred next step, but the attraction of returning home and playing in the NWSL for the first time is clearly tempting from the outside.\n\nOn the sporting side, it makes sense for Macario to land somewhere she’s all but guaranteed substantial and consistent minutes on the pitch — something she was not able to do at Chelsea due in large part to injuries, including an ACL tear in 2022 and the nagging knocks that have occurred since.\n\nUnlike European leagues that lack evenly distributed competition, in the NWSL, Macario could find consistent game time and consistent competition. It could also be advantageous to experience the pace and physicality for which the NWSL is known.\n\nThe league allows incoming transfers up until March 16, three days after the first match of the season. The introduction of the High Impact Player rule, which allows NWSL clubs to spend up to $1 million above the salary cap on a player or players who meet predetermined qualifications, could also help an NWSL team sign Macario. The rule was established in December but is currently being disputed by the NWSL Players Association, which claims the rule misinterprets the “roster classification” as described in the league’s Collective Bargaining Agreement.\n\nMacario may decide to stay put at Chelsea until her contract is up this summer, but if she does have her sights set on the NWSL, it would behoove her to begin the season with them and give herself the extra time to adjust and gel, especially with Champions League play no longer a consideration for her and Chelsea’s hopes of a domestic title growing thin.\n\nMeanwhile, an early exit for Macario could benefit Chelsea, who could receive something in a transfer before the summer. After June, she becomes a free agent and could walk away on her own accord, and she’s not the only Chelsea player with contract talks on the horizon.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Athletic.\n\nUS Women's national team, Chelsea, NWSL, Women's Soccer\n\n2026 The Athletic Media Company",

    "fullText": "Jacob Bridgeman closed in on a first US PGA Tour title on Saturday, firing an impressive seven-under par 64 to take a six-stroke lead over world number two Rory McIlroy heading into the final round of the Genesis Invitational.\n\nBridgeman, who played the iconic Riviera Country Club course for the first time on Wednesday, made his way around like an old hand, matching the tournament's 54-hole record with a 19-under par total of 194.\n\nMcIlroy started the day one stroke behind co-leaders Bridgeman and Marco Penge but endured a tough day on Riviera's greens and finished with just three birdies and a bogey in his two-under 69 for 200.\n\nBridgeman, a 26-year-old American chasing his first PGA Tour title, was up by three after three birdies in his first four holes.\n\nHe picked up four strokes in the space of three holes to pull away for good. After rolling in a 12-foot birdie at the 10th he eagled the par-five 11th -- where he landed his 259-yard approach a foot from the pin. He drilled an 11-foot birdie putt at the 12th.\n\nMcIlroy, who completed his career Grand Slam at the Masters last year, admitted to some frustration as he found himself unable to put pressure on Bridgeman.\n\n\"The greens got really fast there at the end of the day,\" McIlroy said. \"You're grinding over three-footers and all of a sudden you get one that you think you can have a bit of a run at and if you hit it a little bit too hard ...\"\n\n\"I found the greens really, really difficult today,\" added McIlroy, whose difficulties were epitomized at the par-five 17th, where he was on the green in two but ultimately missed a four and a half-foot birdie putt.\n\nMcIlroy said he'd aim for a fast start on Sunday.\n\n\"I'm hitting the ball well. If I can keep driving it like that, putting the ball in the fairway, just giving myself chances and go from there -- that's all I can really do,\" said McIlroy, who was one stroke in front of South African Aldrich Potgieter.\n\nThe 21-year-old Potgieter, who claimed his lone PGA Tour title to date at the Rocket Classic in Detroit last year, had an eagle and six birdies in his six-under 65 and at 12-under was one clear of England's Aaron Rai, who shot a 66.\n\nWorld number one Scottie Scheffler, who pushed his streak of PGA Tour cuts made to 68 without a stroke to spare after an erratic two days, climbed the leaderboard with a five-under 66 for five-under 208.\n\nScheffler, who said this week he has a \"weird\" relationship with Riviera, made four of his six birdies on the back nine, shaking off his lone bogey with the help of solid putting.\n\n\"At times it still felt weird,\" he said. \"The golf course is gettable in the morning, the greens are fresher. So I was able to hole a few putts, which is key.\"",

    "fullText": "Briton Sandy Ryan became a two-weight world champion with a hard-fought points win over Karla Ramos Zamora in Nottingham, claiming the vacant WBC light-welterweight title.\n\nThe 32-year-old was below her best in a high-tempo contest against the awkward Mexican at the Motorpoint Arena.\n\nZamora's relentless output made several rounds difficult to score, but Ryan's cleaner counters proved decisive with the judges.\n\nScores of 95-95, 97-93 and 97-93 gave the Derby fighter a majority decision.\n\n\"I knew Zamora was going to be tough, but my lord she is tough,\" Ryan said. \"I think I broke my right hand in round three and from there it became a bit more messy.\n\n\"I made it hard work for myself. But it's because she's tough as well.\"\n\nA former welterweight world champion, Ryan improves her record to nine wins, three defeats and one draw.\n\nShe was fighting on the undercard of Leigh Wood v Josh Warrington, who meet in their rematch later on Saturday.\n\nWood v Warrington 2: Ryan becomes two-weight world champion - listen\n\nThe Uber-driving English champion & his 30-year fight for a passport\n\nBenn joining Zuffa 'dagger in the heart' for Hearn\n\nRyan returned to the world stage after considering retirement following back-to-back defeats by Mikaela Mayer.\n\nShe lost her WBO welterweight title in a close decision in September 2024 and was beaten again in their March 2025 rematch.\n\nRyan sprinted to the ring at 19:20 GMT to a quarter-full 8,000-seat arena, though a vocal pocket of Derby fans cut through the quiet.\n\nThe fight started at a quick pace. Zamora - fighting at world level for the first time - pressed forward and targeted the body.\n\nRyan responded with a sharp left hook in the second but was forced onto the back foot as Zamora kept the pressure on.\n\nAlthough Ryan was landing with the cleaner counters, Zamora was more effective with her inside work. By halfway, it was tighter than expected.\n\nBruised around the eyes, Ryan traded in the seventh as blood streamed from Zamora's nose, the visitor edging the exchanges.\n\nRyan boxed behind the jab in the ninth before they ended toe-to-toe, swinging at close range.\n\nAt the final bell, a case could be made for either fighter, or a draw.\n\nThe win, gritty rather than pretty, puts Ryan back in contention.\n\nUndisputed champion Katie Taylor holds the division's other belts but has yet to confirm her next move. At welterweight, unified champion Lauren Price may loom as a future target.\n\nA crossover bout with former MMA champion Cris Cyborg - now 5-0 in professional boxing - has also been previously mooted.\n\nEarlier in the night, Bilal Fawaz became British and Commonwealth light-middleweight champion by dethroning Ishmael Davis in a close contest.\n\nDavis, 30, started well and landed the more crisp and cleaner punches with Fawaz guilty of too much showboating and theatrics.\n\nBut Fawaz, 37, upped his punch output and took advantage in the second half as Davis tired.\n\nThe judges scored it 114-114, 115-113 and 115-114.\n\nNigerian-born Fawaz adds the British and Commonwealth titles to his collection, though he continues the fight for a British passport and is currently not able to fight or travel abroad.\n\nFawaz, who was trafficked to the UK as a teenager and after escaping a traumatic beginning to life, is now married and a father of two children, as well as working as an Uber driver.\n\n\"I know I'm 37 years old and I don't have much time. If I don't capitalise on what I have now, my dream will slip away. This is just the beginning, I am ready. I want it all,\" he said.\n\n\"It's sensational. It's overwhelming.\"\n\n\"I'm not a domestic fighter,\" he said. \"It's just that nobody gave me a chance. Eddie [Hearn] gave me a chance and I've proved him right ever since.\n\n\"Now I need to make some money and feed my family.\"\n\nWithout a passport, Fawaz cannot travel abroad to accept any world title opportunities outside of the UK.\n\n\"Get this man a passport,\" promoter Eddie Hearn added.\n\nAlso on the undercard in Nottingham, Molly McCann claimed her third professional win by outpointing Beata Dudek, while teenagers Leo Atang and Tiah Mai Ayton continued their unbeaten runs.\n\nHeavyweight Atang, 19, stopped Dan Garber inside a minute to make it five from five, and Ayton, also 19, went the distance for the first time in her fifth bout, defeating Catherine Tacone Ramos on points.\n\nPopular heavyweight Dave Allen returned to winning ways with a first-round stoppage of Karim Berredjem. The 33-year-old from Doncaster had lost to Russian Arslanbek Makhmudov - who is scheduled to face Tyson Fury in April - in his last outing.\n\nBoxing schedule and results 2026\n\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "fullText": "The \"Boca World\" has a new protagonist. Adam Bareiro was officially presented as the club's new signing after sealing a deal that will tie him to the institution for the next three seasons. The 29-year-old Paraguayan forward returns to Argentine football after his stint with Fortaleza in Brazil, thus fulfilling a long-held wish of Juan Román Riquelme, who always had him as a top priority on his radar.\n\nThe transfer was closed for a figure close to 3 million dollars. A significant detail of the operation is that half of that amount went to River Plate, a club that still owned 50% of his rights. In fact, his \"millonario\" past sparked the first tense moment of the day: while heading to his medical examination, a River fan confronted him, shouting \"traitor.\" Bareiro, far from getting into controversy, simply smiled and continued with the signing protocol.\n\nAfter passing his medical exams and signing a three-year contract (with an option for one more), the striker immediately moved to La Bombonera. There, he was seen in one of the boxes watching the match against Racing, already immersed in the atmosphere of his new home. With this move, Boca adds hierarchy and attacking power to face the challenges of 2026, backed by the absolute confidence of the management in his goal-scoring ability.\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence.

    "fullText": "The Orioles’ Grapefruit League opener yesterday was a resounding success, at least if you’re a pitcher or Pete Alonso. The Birds’ newest slugger mashed a two-run homer in his O’s spring debut to provide all the offense in a 2-0 win over the Yankees. Trevor Rogers, Keegan Akin, Rico Garcia, Grant Wolfram, Jose Espada, and Trey Gibson combined on a three-hit shutout, with Gibson pitching the final three innings for the save. All of those guys except Gibson are either locks or strong candidates for the Opening Day roster, so it’s nice to see them all start well.\n\nThe O’s have a return engagement at Ed Smith Stadium today against the Pirates. Dean Kremer, who will soon be leaving the Orioles to pitch for Team Israel in the World Baseball Classic, takes the mound today. It’s strange to think that Kremer might have to compete for a rotation spot, but that may be the case, as he, Chris Bassitt, and Zach Eflin (if healthy) are three candidates for two openings behind Rogers, Kyle Bradish, and Shane Baz.\n\nToday’s game marks the Orioles debuts for Taylor Ward and Blaze Alexander, while Dylan Beavers and Ryan Mountcastle will also be starting for the first time this spring. Adley Rutschman and Gunnar Henderson, the latter of whom will soon leave for the WBC as well, are the only Orioles from yesterday’s game who are starting again today. They’ll take on Pirates prospect Wilber Dotel. Former Orioles Ryan O’Hearn and Billy Cook are in the Pirates’ lineup this afternoon.\n\nThe game will be televised on MASN and on radio on 98 Rock.\n\nLF Taylor Ward\nC Adley Rutschman\n1B Ryan Mountcastle\n2B Blaze Alexander\nDH Gunnar Henderson\nRF Dylan Beavers\nCF Leody Taveras\n3B Weston Wilson\nSS Luis Vázquez",

    "fullText": "The Enola Gay, the Boeing B-29 Superfortress bomber that dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima in World War II, is so large that it couldn't fit into the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum's flagship location on the National Mall in Washington, DC.\n\nInstead, it's displayed at the museum's second location, the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, Virginia.\n\nThe Udvar-Hazy Center features over 200 aircraft on display, but the Enola Gay remains one of the most prominent objects in its collection.\n\nTake a closer look at the historic aircraft.\n\nA second \"Fat Man\" atomic bomb was dropped on Nagasaki on August 9, 1945, by another Boeing B-29 Superfortress named Bockscar, which is on display at the National Museum of the US Air Force in Dayton, Ohio.\n\nThe emperor of Japan announced the country's surrender on August 15.\n\nTibbets commanded the Air Force's 509th Composite Group in charge of deploying nuclear weapons. The hand-picked squadron trained at an abandoned airfield in Windover, Utah.\n\nTo make the B-29 aircraft capable of carrying the atomic bomb, all of its protective and defensive armament, except for the 50-caliber tailguns, were removed to get rid of excess weight. It was also left unpainted, which saved the 850 pounds that the paint would have added.\n\nAt least 70,000 people died in the initial blast from the bombing of Hiroshima, and the death toll over five years may have exceeded 200,000 people due to the aftereffects, according to the US Department of Energy's Office of History and Heritage Resources.\n\nJapan and anti-nuclear weapons scientists released an updated higher estimate in the 1970s that counted 140,000 deaths at Hiroshima.\n\nThe Enola Gay was rattled by shockwaves from the explosion, even as it had already flown 11.5 miles away.\n\nIt took museum staff 300,000 hours to reassemble and restore the Enola Gay, with 12 truckloads transporting all of its parts.\n\nIn 1995, the fuselage and other parts of the Enola Gay were displayed at the National Air and Space Museum's flagship location in Washington, DC, in an exhibit tied to the 50th anniversary of the bombing of Hiroshima.\n\nThe script of the exhibit was rewritten several times as various interest groups debated how it was presented and how the decision to drop the bomb was framed, according to the Smithsonian Institution Archives.\n\nVeterans' groups pushed for the exhibit to emphasize Japanese aggression and present the narrative that dropping the atomic bomb saved lives by ending the war. Anti-war activists opposed having the exhibit justify the use of the bomb and sought to highlight its victims by protesting with alternative exhibits on the sidewalk outside the museum.\n\nWeighing 137,500 pounds with a wingspan of 141 feet, the fully assembled plane is too large for the National Air and Space Museum's flagship location on the National Mall in Washington, DC. The Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, Virginia, offers more room with 340,000 square feet of exhibit space.\n\nThe Enola Gay is displayed among other aircraft from World War II, including the Northrop P-61C Black Widow, the first US aircraft designed for combat at night.\n\nOver 80 years after the bombing of Hiroshima, the Enola Gay remains not just a World War II artifact, but a symbol of a turning point that ushered the world into the nuclear age.\n\nAfter years of debate over how to present the aircraft, the permanent exhibition takes a minimalist approach, leaving visitors to decide how to understand its legacy.",

    "fullText": "The noise is one of the first things that hits you on arrival in India.\n\nThe chatter. The beeping of horns. A thrilling assault on the senses.\n\nEngland have also battled to dampen the noise around their group throughout this T20 World Cup campaign.\n\nShould Brendon McCullum stay on as coach? Is Harry Brook the right man to be captain?\n\nEven after reaching the relative tranquillity of central Sri Lanka, Brook fielded questions about the ongoing situation regarding Pakistan players' involvement in The Hundred.\n\nBrook's pre-prepared answers – he gave it in two separate interviews to different questions – did not say much, but he did at least show support for those involved.\n\nOn another day, Brook's admission that England had \"probably underestimated a couple of the sides\" when scraping through the group stage would have taken the headlines.\n\nIt was honest, but not a great look for a team battling a perception of being loose with their preparation.\n\n\"We obviously didn't know all the players and we had minimal stats on some of them,\" Brook said.\n\n\"That's something that we can definitely improve on in the future, especially in tournaments further down the line - getting your homework done a little bit earlier.\"\n\nEngland's performance in the group stage was undoubtedly unconvincing.\n\nThey were taken to the final ball by Nepal and lost to West Indies in Mumbai, before edging to wins over Italy and Scotland in Kolkata.\n\nBatters got in and got out - Tom Banton's 63 not out the only real match-defining score. Even the ever-reliable Adil Rashid has gone for nine runs per over or \n\nIt means England have shown little to suggest they can threaten late into the tournament to this point.\n\nWithout improvement this will likely be a fourth underwhelming major tournament in a row since they won the T20 World Cup in 2022.\n\nBut Brook's comments also reflect some of the difficulties faced by the major nations at this World Cup – a tournament in which no team has built an entirely compelling case to suggest they will be champions.\n\nPlayers from the lower-ranked teams expressed their keenness to perform, not just to cause an upset but also to prove they are deserving of the greater opportunities they so desperately seek.\n\nThe Test-playing sides, in contrast, had everything to lose. Just ask Mitchell Marsh when he gets off his flight to back to Australia on Saturday.\n\nAnd for all their struggles to finish matches with ease, England were also ahead in all three games against their lower-ranked opponents.\n\nNepal's chase looked to have stalled, Scotland were 127-8 and Italy 1-2 in the first over of their chase.\n\nMost former England captains would not admit it, and maybe Brook has shown he would, but it would only be human to relax in those situations.\n\nMost of all, however, England are hoping familiarity brings an upturn in fortunes.\n\nThey returned to Sri Lanka on Tuesday, first spending two nights in Colombo before taking the winding drive to Pallekele.\n\nColombo was where Brook stood in front of his team-mates in late January and apologised for his late-night antics in Wellington and the subsequent fallout – an attempt to draw a line under the Ashes defeat.\n\nPallekele was where England won all three T20s against the very same team they now face.\n\nEngland said they were badly prepared for the Ashes and now admit to being underprepared for this group stage. For the next task they could hardly have had better preparation.\n\n\"It's just about reading the pitch and the conditions as quickly as possible and communication's key,\" said Brook, when asked what he learned from beating Sri Lanka.\n\n\"We obviously had that last game where we only got 130, but that ended up being a winning score.\n\n\"You never quite know what's going to happen with the pitch and until you end up playing on it.\"\n\nThe 3-0 win, which concluded less than three weeks ago, took England's winning run in T20s against Sri Lanka to 11.\n\nThere have been six UK prime ministers since England last lost to Sunday's opponents in the shortest format.\n\nSri Lanka's key bowlers Wanindu Hasaranga and Matheesha Pathirana have also been ruled out with injury.\n\nAnd after Sri Lanka, England will face Pakistan before a meeting with New Zealand.\n\nThey have won their past three T20 series against Pakistan and beat the Black Caps last year. That was a rain-hit contest but in the one match completed, England racked up 236-4.\n\nThe favourable draw, set by the pre-seedings that have sent the four group winners into the other side of the Super 8 draw, means there will be no excuses should England fail to progress to the semi-finals.\n\nThat was the minimum requirement before this tournament began and relief at avoiding a group-stage exit should not hide that fact.\n\nEngland and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) chief executive Richard Gould arrived in Sri Lanka on Saturday, with managing director Rob Key to follow on Sunday.\n\nIt is described as a pre-planned trip rather than anything that should ramp up the pressure on coach Brendon McCullum, whose future remains in question after the Ashes debacle.\n\nThese may be three matches for McCullum to save his job – should he want to continue into the summer. Two wins would likely be enough to take England into the semi-finals.\n\nAnything less and that noise would only ramp up again.\n\nLive ball-by-ball commentary of every match on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra, BBC Sounds and the BBC Sport website and app, plus live texts with in-play clips and highlights.\n\nIs Buttler's form a worry? England's T20 World Cup so far analysed\n\nI won't bat for myself to correct form - Buttler\n\nEngland still confident despite unconvincing run - Jacks",

    "fullText": "Liverpool's injury list has been the bane of their existence this season.\n\nAlthough three or four injuries across the entire team wouldn't be the end of the world, the fact that Arne Slot's defence has often had three players absent has probably been a hard pill to swallow.\n\nDue to this, and the Reds' lack of depth, their defensive line has been brought into question on more than one occasion with several players being linked with a summer move.\n\nHowever, now that one of Slot's injury-prone men seem to be back to full fitness, it could be his time to shine and his chance to prove why the Anfield outfit have chosen to keep him around for so long.\n\nShop the goalkeeper range today\n\nShop the third kit range today!\n\nThere's no hiding from the fact that Joe Gomez is a 'special' player.\n\nIn fact, up until he injured his knee in the 2020-21 season, the Englishman was Virgil van Dijk's main defensive partner.\n\nSince that injury, the former Charlton man has been side-lined on several occasions with his body seemingly being made of glass.\n\nHowever, now that he's returned from his latest ailment, it feels like now could be his time to shine, especially since Jeremie Frimpong and Conor Bradley are injured.\n\nGomez is 28 years old now and with the 2026 World Cup just around the corner, a solid end to the 2025-26 season could be exactly what he needs to get into Thomas Tuchel's plans, especially because of how versatile he is.\n\nThe Englishman's most recent cameo against Brighton further proved why Slot should start against Nottingham Forest on Sunday.\n\nDue to Gomez's injury history, it's not hard to see why Slot has often chosen against starting the Englishman on a regular basis.\n\nAnd, when he has gone against his better judgement, the 28-year-old has often left the pitch early due to injury.\n\nHowever, during his 20-minute cameo against Brighton, the centre-back rolled back the years and proved why Jurgen Klopp chose to bring him to Anfield in the first place.\n\nAccording to Sofascore, the defender maintained a 100 per cent pass accuracy during his cameo and even won 100 per cent of the tackles he attempted.\n\nHe may have committed a couple of fouls during that time but his confidence on the ball was second to none.\n\nThe added stability that the centre-back brought to Liverpool's starting XI was rather helpful and, since Forest beat Fenerbahce 3-0 last time out, they'll have a point to prove.\n\nIt will also be Vitor Pereira's second game in charge and, if we look back to when the Portuguese manager first took over at Wolves, he won them a fair few games at the start.\n\nLiverpool have a lot riding on Sunday's game and, if they lose, they could end up missing out on a top four spot, which, for a team of their quality, would be horrendous.",

    "description": "The watch world is rejoicing over the Supreme Court's ruling on Trump's tariffs as dealers say the prices of pre-owned Swiss watches could dip.",
    "fullText": "The watch world breathed a collective sigh of relief over the Supreme Court's decision on President Donald Trump's trade policy.\n\nIn a 6-3 decision on Friday, the court ruled that imposing most of Trump's tariffs exceeded his authority under a 1970s law. The ruling is a hefty blow to the policies he put in place against foreign countries, which companies have had to reckon with for nearly a year.\n\nWatch dealers have told Business Insider that they and their shoppers stand to benefit from the ruling. Pre-owned watch retailer SwissWatchExpo CEO Eugene Tutunikov said it would likely lead to lower pre-owned watch prices in the next six months — he expects declines of 2% to 3%. Without tariffs looming overhead, the market is poised to snap back faster than retail prices as sellers set their prices and buyers take the deals.\n\n\"Supply will loosen up, and purchasing power goes right back to the collector where it belongs,\" Tutunikov said.\n\nA break from tariffs would make the entry point for luxury watch collecting more accessible.\n\nCue the celebrations among Swiss watch lovers who've been caught in a storm of retail price increases from leading brands like Rolex over the past year. Supply chain constraints also made it harder to do business in the secondhand market.\n\nTariff tensions between Switzerland and the US have been up and down since Trump's Liberation Day. US imports of Swiss goods faced a baseline tariff of 10% from April 2025 until Trump eventually raised it to 39%, sending shockwaves through the watch industry. The two countries continued negotiations until Trump agreed to lower the rate to 15% after speaking with Rolex and other Swiss companies.\n\nTrump clapped back at the nation's highest court over its Friday ruling, saying he'd find alternative ways to keep his trade agenda intact.\n\n\"The Supreme Court did not overrule tariffs. They merely overruled a particular use of IEPPA tariffs,\" Trump said, citing the law referenced in the court's ruling.\n\nHowever, the Supreme Court's move is still a win in the books of watch dealers who've said the decision would allow pricing in the pre-owned market to return to being based on value and demand rather than tariffs.\n\n\"If they are indeed lifted, we expect it would meaningfully improve sentiment across the industry, increase access to important pieces, and ultimately benefit collectors, retailers, and brands alike,\" said Joshua Ganjei, CEO of European Watch Company, which sells pre-owned and vintage watches.",

    "fullText": "Savinho has missed the last 13 games for Manchester City. The Brazilian international was injured during Manchester City’s nil-all draw with Sunderland at the Stadium of Light at the beginning of January. Pep Guardiola has now revealed that Savinho is nearing a return to the pitch, which is good news for his team. Also, the Manchester City manager revealed that he has high hopes for Savinho as a player. Savinho is a player who can dazzle and frustrate in the same passage of play. But as Pep Guardiola said after his team’s win over Salford City, if the Brazilian international can put it all together, he could become a devastating weapon for his team.\n\nSpeaking after Manchester City’s 2-nil win over Salford City in their FA Cup fourth-round tie at the Etihad Stadium, Pep Guardiola revealed that Savinho could have played a few minutes against the League Two side. The Manchester City manager also revealed that if Savinho can put it all together with his end product, he will become a valuable weapon for his team. Speaking on Savinho’s injury situation, and the Brazilian international’s obvious potential, Pep Guardiola said: “He’s been out for six weeks. He could [have played] a few minutes, but we didn’t want to take risks. Training two days ago was wow, so good. He’s close. Now we have a long week and players coming back.”\n\n“Already Savinho, when he will learn to make the finished product he will be an unbelievable winger on both sides.”\n\nPep Guardiola’s assessment of Savinho is on the money. The Brazilian winger has the potential to become a key player for Manchester City. What has plagued Savinho since he arrived at City from Troyes is his end product. Savinho’s finishing is unreliable, and he squanders too many chances. His delivery and decision-making in the final third also remain inconsistent. None of these revelations are groundbreaking; they have been known for some time now. It is up to Savinho to rectify these areas of his game to take the next step as a player. He simply has to get an opportunity to become a consistent player for Manchester City.\n\nThere is strong competition now amongst the City sqaud for roles on either wing. Antoine Semenyo, Jeremy Doku, Rayan Cherki and Phil Foden all stand in Savinho’s way. You could throw Omar Marmoush into that mix as well. To make good on Pep Guardiola’s assessment, Savinho has to improve his end product. He has no other choice. Modern squads are built on options, and Guardiola has plenty available in wide areas. Supporters see a similar idea in games too, where players can buy V Bucks to open up more choices and customise their experience before jumping back into action. For Savinho, the challenge is simple — take the next step and make himself the first option when it matters most.\n\nIt is good news for Manchester City to have Savinho back from injury. His return gives Pep Guardiola another attacking option to utilize. Pep Guardiola has also explained what Savinho needs to do to grow as a player. It is now up to him to take the next step and not be squeezed out of Pep Guardiola’s squad.",

    "fullText": "Antoine Semenyo has made an impressive start to life at Manchester City. Since signing for City from Bournemouth, the Ghana international has scored five goals and added two assists in nine appearances for Pep Guardiola’s side. Semenyo, alongside Marc Guehi, arrived at City during last month’s transfer window, and the pair have made an immediate impact on their new team. In Semenyo’s case, Pep Guardiola has praised the powerful winger for the impact he has already made for his team. Looking further ahead, you do sense that Semenyo has barely scratched the surface of what he will become as a Manchester City player.\n\nSpeaking ahead of Manchester City’s pivotal Premier League fixture against Newcastle, Pep Guardiola praised the impact that Antoine Semenyo has made since signing for Manchester City. He explained: “It’s not just scoring a lot of goals. The strikers and the players who play up front are so important. Not just that. (He) makes a special rhythm, his versatility to play many positions up front and in the three positions.”\n\n“We knew it and comes from Bournemouth, they are exceptional in the rhythm and defensively and he has it in his DNA. His impact has been really good.”\n\nPep Guardiola also has confidence in Antoine Semenyo’s ability to play on the biggest stage in the UEFA Champions League. The Ghana international is yet to play in the competition, but that opportunity awaits him as this season progresses. Guardiola added: “Antoine we played against him many times in the last years and whether he can be top class or elite, we have to see. I don’t know, when you buy a player from a club, they come here, see how he adapts to play in the Champions League where he hasn’t played before.”\n\n“The biggest stages in the Premier League, yes, but in the knockout stages in the position is a good test for him. How he will react. I’m pretty sure his mentality, I think he will handle it quite well.”\n\nThere is no doubt that Antoine Semenyo, along with Marc Guehi, has made an immediate impact at Manchester City. This City side does feel immediately stronger with their addition. The pair were ready to make the next step in their careers. They forged their way in the Premier League at Bournemouth and Crystal Palace, and a move to a club like City was the logical next step for both players. Antoine Semenyo has made an impressive start to life as a City player. His goals have been crucial. In terms of what Semenyo can become as a City player, he is yet to scratch the surface of what he will become.\n\nAs impressive as Semenyo’s start to life at Manchester City has been, the areas of his game that need to be tidied up stand out. Semenyo has been clunky in possession at times, and he has been guilty of losing possession. He also needs to learn the nuances of Manchester City’s high defensive press. That will all come in time. Semenyo is currently learning on the fly. He is also yet to develop a proper understanding with Erling Haaland, Jeremy Doku, Phil Foden, Rayan Cherki, and the remainder of his City teammates. The more he plays, the more that will all come. So while Semenyo has made an immediate impact already, the ceiling is incredibly high for what the Ghana international will become for Pep Guardiola’s side.\n\nAntoine Semenyo has rightly been praised by Pep Guardiola for his fast start to life at Manchester City. He has already made a tremendous contribution. Looking further ahead, Semenyo has more room to grow as a City player, and that in itself is a fantastic proposition to ponder for the future for Semenyo and Manchester City.",

    "description": "I traveled the world as a digital nomad in places like Mexico City and Paris after a breakup. The experience taught me about my own resilience.",
    "fullText": "Three and a half years ago, I stood in my New Jersey apartment, surrounded by boxes I was about to put into storage. Tears streamed down my cheeks.\n\nI'd recently ended a two-year, live-in relationship. We loved each other deeply, but just weren't the right fit — and although the split was a gut-wrenching decision, we both knew it was the right move.\n\nI had just accepted a fully remote job, which allowed me to explore moving out of the New York City area — something I had been considering for about a year.\n\nI planned to just travel for a few months before settling down somewhere, but I ended up spending the next three years as a nomad.\n\nAlthough it wasn't quite what I'd pictured when I said goodbye to the apartment I shared with my ex, it turned into one of the most important chapters of my life.\n\nMy post-breakup plan was to put all of my belongings into a storage unit and spend a few months in Tulum.\n\nAfter that, I would travel to Miami and Los Angeles, \"interviewing\" both cities as candidates for a longer-term move. I was about seven months into this plan when I learned my role was going to be eliminated.\n\nLuckily, I was able to secure freelance work, so I decided to continue my travels since I wasn't needed in one particular place for my job.\n\nFrom Tulum, I headed to Mexico City. After just a few days, I fell in love with the food, vibrancy, people, and culture. My one-week vacation turned into an almost three-month stay.\n\nDuring my time in Mexico City, I explored art galleries and museums, learned some Spanish, made friends, went on dates, visited small shops, and tipped local people well.\n\nThese little moments helped me learn how adaptable I truly was. I realized I could make friends anywhere, stay disciplined with my work even while exploring a new place, safely navigate dating as a solo traveler, and be extremely resourceful.\n\nI kept exploring. I took the nomad life slowly, spending about four or five months abroad at a time in places like Paris, Lisbon, Málaga, London, Melbourne, Miami, and Tulum.\n\nBetween travels, I'd spend a few months recharging in a sublease (or a friend's apartment) in New York City.\n\nWhen traveling solo, every choice you make is yours, from where you eat to how you spend your days. I felt immensely grateful for this freedom — every day, it struck me how lucky I was to have every minuscule decision be solely my own.\n\nThat's not to say I felt lonely, though. With each new city and country I stayed in, I was delighted by the magic of connecting with strangers.\n\nOne time, I struck up a conversation with another woman at a particularly intense yoga class in Tulum. She was visiting from Canada, and we ended up spending a whole day together.\n\nI had another memorable experience in Europe. I had been traveling by myself for about three years at that point, and although it was incredible, I was exhausted. I felt ready to return to New York City, but I wasn't sure I could afford to do so.\n\nThen, one afternoon, my spirits were lifted when I found myself in a café in Paris, enjoying a chocolate-chip cookie and a latte. An older woman started chatting with me, and soon, another young woman traveling solo from Korea joined in.\n\nWe all shared stories and giggled as we sipped our coffees. As the older woman left the café, she said, \"You two girls exchange numbers now, and spend time together.\"\n\nWe laughed at the gentle demand, but wound up spending that evening — and the next day, too — exploring the city as a pair. I may or may not ever see her again, but she told me that if I ever visit Seoul, I'll be welcomed with open arms.\n\nI learned that not every place has to be a permanent home, and not every relationship has to last forever; in fact, some friendships might just last for the span of a trip.\n\nThe memories I made during this time will stick with me, though I've since emptied out my storage unit and settled into a one-year lease in New York City.\n\nMy nomadic chapter is closed for now, but my encounters with strangers, small moments in new cities, and solo time with myself left me changed for the better — and will surely inspire my next adventure.",

    "title": "The battle over Trump tariff refunds is next — and it will be messy",
    "description": "The process for IEEPA tariff refunds will likely go through the Court of International Trade. Already, over 1,000 lawsuits are pending.",
    "fullText": "The Supreme Court on Friday overturned the centerpiece of President Donald Trump's tariff plans, ruling the federal government illegally collected over $133 billion in taxes from American businesses.\n\nNow comes the battle over refunds for tariffs paid, which Trump on Friday predicted could take years.\n\n\"I guess it has to get litigated for the next two years,\" he said at a White House press conference, while blasting the ruling as \"terrible\" and \"defective.\"\n\nUS Secretary of the Treasury went a step further, saying about refunds: \"I've got a feeling the American people won't see it.\"\n\nOne reason: Over 1,000 companies have filed lawsuits to claw back money from the government if the Supreme Court overturned Trump's tariffs justified by the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.\n\nIn his dissenting opinion, Justice Brett Kavanaugh also predicted the process could become a \"mess,\" citing refund requests tallying \"billions of dollars to importers,\" even as some importers have already passed those costs to consumers.\n\nHere are all your questions about tariff refunds, answered by experts.\n\nTypically, the refund process would be handled by Customs and Border Protection, which collected the tariffs in the first place.\n\nIn order for that to happen, the Trump administration would need to establish a process for handling refund requests. The White House, which didn't return Business Insider's request for comment, has yet to signal plans to do this, said Rachel Brewster, a professor of international trade at Duke Law School.\n\nWithout a formal process in place, claims will be litigated in the Court of International Trade, which will order CPB to issue refunds to specific companies, Brewster said.\n\nIn the past, the Court of International Trade has ordered refunds when it has found particular taxes to be invalid — albeit on a smaller scale, according to Daniel Mach, a commercial litigator at Bryan Cave.\n\nIt'll likely turn to the process that followed a 1998 Supreme Court decision to overturn a harbor maintenance tax, which also resulted in refunds, Mach said.\n\n\"It's been a while,\" Mach said. \"Everyone's going to be kind of figuring out the ropes as they go. But at the end of the day, it's not an unsolvable problem.\"\n\nGiven the number of claims, the Court of International Trade is likely to appoint an administrator or special master to consider each of them, rather than handling the lawsuits piecemeal, Mach said.\n\nGroups that advocated for the Supreme Court to overturn the IEEPA tariffs have urged the Court of International Trade to develop a smooth process for refunds.\n\n\"The refunds will serve as an economic boost and allow companies to reinvest in their operations, their employees and their customers,\" said David French, an executive at the National Retail Federation, in a statement.\n\nThe whole refund process — whether through CPB or through a class-action or administrative processes in court — could take up to two years, according to Brewster.\n\nYes! The cases that went to the Supreme Court were groups of small companies, including a wine importer and an educational toy retailer. But several massive corporations, including Toyota and Costco, have also filed refund lawsuits.\n\nYou can try to get a refund for personal orders hit by tariffs, but it'll be complicated.\n\nIn asking CPB or a court for a refund, you'll have to distinguish tariffs you paid pursuant to IEEPA, which were overturned, and the tariffs justified by other laws, which remain on the books.\n\nIndividual lawsuits for IEEPA tariffs on individual retailer orders, like from Temu and Shein, likely won't be worthwhile. The legal fees would likely exceed any potential refund. But it's possible that some enterprising litigators would put together a class-action lawsuit to make it worthwhile, Brewster predicted.\n\n\"It was an illegally imposed tax,\" she said. \"So in theory, everyone is entitled to a refund.\"\n\nWith reporting by Brent Griffins",

    "fullText": "Great Britain has fallen 25 years behind the best short track nations in the world amid outdated facilities and rising costs, according to British Ice Skating's head of performance.\n\nTeam GB's only short track representative at Milan-Cortina 2026, Niall Treacy, crashed in all three events - 500m, 1,000m and 1500m.\n\nThe 25-year-old reached the final of the 1500m, finishing ninth. But he was the only Brit to compete, with Team GB unable to fill their quota of three athletes.\n\nIt is a far cry from eight years ago, when a well-funded team of five were sent to PyeongChang 2018 with realistic medal hopes.\n\nBut a failure to get on the podium in Korea saw the sport's funding slashed, and head of performance Jon Eley says they have been rebuilding ever since.\n\nFormer short track skater Eley – who represented Britain in three Olympics between 2006 and 2014 – told BBC Sport: \"Go back to PyeongChang, where short track was funded well and we had a world champion [Elise Christie] in the team. That was a Games when we were disappointed not to win a medal.\n\n\"Since then, we have been rebuilding. During that time many teams have gone to the next level of performance and resources.\n\n\"When I made the team 25 years ago and we moved to Nottingham, we had one of the best facilities in the world; now, we don't have an international standard arena. We have a lot of work to do.\"\n\nBefore the 2018 Games, UK Sport provided £4.8m to short track skating. As of 2026, the latest UK Sport funding allocation of just under £2m has been presented as a total for short track, figure and long track speed skating.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nBritain has no international quality rinks to host short track events – such as an arena with soft padding around the barriers in case of crashes - meaning Treacy trained with the Dutch national team ahead of the Olympics.\n\nAnd Eley says there are no plans to improve facilities, due to a lack of funding as well as the greater popularity of other winter sports.\n\n\"If you do that [install padding] you can't have hockey on the rink, you can't have pucks with the pads, so you are cutting the use of the facility,\" he said. \"Ice hockey is a big participation sport in the UK.\n\n\"We had that in the lead up to PyeongChang, a hybrid system – pads in place during the week then they take them out on the weekend when the hockey team played.\n\n\"But it was costing £30,000 a week because of how much work it took to take the barriers in and out.\n\n\"Plus, the cost of running rinks in the last few years has gone through the roof, the cost of freezing the ice and the price of energy.\"\n\nInstead, short track will have to be clever with their funding and facilities – and Eley says they could look to a sport where Britain have had Olympic success.\n\nTwo of Britain's three golds at Milan-Cortina have been in skeleton, despite training on a single track in Bath with no ice.\n\nHowever, a clear talent ID and training programme brought success, followed by funding to allow for greater strides to be made in design and hiring world-class coaches.\n\n\"From a skeleton perspective, they might not have loads of access to tracks, but what they do, they do very well,\" he said. \"So we can learn from them.\"\n\nShort track is currently funded as a development sport, and Eley says they are looking to have a stronger and larger team for French Alps 2030.\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "description": "Preparation, training, and belief - after Keely Hodgkinson smashes the indoor 800m world record, her coach Jenny Meadows explains how their plan came together.",
    "fullText": "Keely Hodgkinson had been preparing for this moment for years.\n\nWhen she stepped on to the indoor track in France on Thursday, the Briton and her team \"had no doubt\" she was going to break the 800m indoor world record - and she did so in some style.\n\nBut it has not all been plain sailing for Hodgkinson since she won the Olympic 800m title at Paris 2024.\n\nThe 23-year-old suffered injury issues last year which challenged her physically and mentally - but has used those setbacks to return even stronger, with her training group, the M11 Track Club, dubbing her 'Keely 2.0'.\n\nShe proved she is back to her best with her stunning indoor run in Lievin, crossing the line in one minute 54.87 seconds to smash a world record which had stood since 3 March 2002 - the day Hodgkinson was born.\n\nAnd this is how Hodgkinson etched her name in the history books.\n\nSince 2019, Hodgkinson has trained with coaches Trevor Painter and Jenny Meadows in Manchester.\n\nMeadows, a former international runner, was in France to watch her protege take almost a second off the 800m indoor record, set by Slovenia's Jolanda Ceplak almost 24 years ago.\n\n\"She actually said to me the day before: 'obviously I know I'm going to get it',\" said Meadows.\n\n\"There had been so many benchmarks we measure in training, we had no doubt that she would do it.\n\n\"Her biggest fear was to set a world record, but be disappointed with the time. She said 'what if I can't smile? What if I've got the world record, and everyone's so excited, and I think, oh that was rubbish. I could have gone faster'?\"\n\nThe date - 19 February 2026 - had long been set in the diary by Meadows and Hodgkinson given the track in Lievin is notoriously fast.\n\n\"Lievin has had a lot of world records over the years, and we kind of thought 'you know what, let's go with the statistics',\" Meadows said.\n\n\"We're only probably going to get one opportunity during this indoor season to go for it. So that's the event that we picked, and that's the date we've really had etched in our minds the last three months.\"\n\n\"I've got to say, the time she did was the bare minimum of what she was happy with,\" Meadows added.\n\n\"She definitely would have liked to run faster, and there was definitely half a second, maybe even up to one second in those legs.\"\n\nMeadows retired from the sport in 2016. As a former world and European medallist over 800m, she knew exactly what was required to make history.\n\n\"800m is so tough, your body is literally breaking down from the training,\" she said.\n\n\"Keely can be doing certain repetitions, and she's being physically sick from the lactic acid. It's a little bit inhumane at times.\"\n\nIn the build-up to Thursday's race, Meadows said the team learned lessons from previous years, and resisted the urge to do too much training with Hodgkinson - instead believing in the process and their athlete.\n\n\"Keely is a really interesting character. I was quite robotic and could follow a routine. Keely keeps us on our toes. We have to keep her interested. So we're always trying to do little different goals for her.\"\n\nMeadows added: \"We've not been greedy, we've really held back and said we need to believe in our process. We need to believe in our product. We need to believe in our athlete, that Keely can stand on that start line and deliver when the eyes of the world are on her.\"\n\nNine months ago the success experienced in Lievin would have felt like a distant dream for Hodgkinson.\n\nShe had planned a tilt at the 800m indoor world record at her eponymous Keely Klassic event in February 2025 and \"was in great shape\", according to Meadows.\n\nHowever, a hamstring problem forced Hodgkinson to withdraw, regroup and retrain - only for the injury to reoccur 12 weeks later.\n\nDespite setbacks and a reduction in training, she made it to the start line for September's World Athletics Championships, claiming bronze behind GB team-mate Georgia Hunter Bell and winner Kenya's Lilian Odira.\n\n\"It was phenomenal, given the very little preparation [Hodgkinson] did but I doubt she's ever looked at that medal again. She wants the gold, she wants the records, and that is what was driving her forward,\" said Meadows.\n\n\"She isn't the most talented athlete I have ever seen. The difference between Keely and a lot of others is mindset, she can get the best out of herself on a daily basis.\"\n\nIn under a month Hodgkinson will head to Poland to compete in the World Athletics Indoor Championships as a firm favourite for gold.\n\nBeyond that there is another target in her sights - the world record that has stood longer than any other in athletics.\n\nIn July 1983, Czech athlete Jarmila Kratochvilova set a women's outdoor 800m world record in a time of 1:53.28.\n\nBut 43 years on, Hodgkinson wants to beat that mark and make more history.\n\n\"She wants that more than the indoor record. Her ambition is to be a legend of the sport,\" said Meadows.\n\nKratochvilova's time remains more than a second quicker than Hodgkinson's current personal best of 1:54.61, a national record she set in London in 2024.\n\nHer coach believes London could be the scene of what would be arguably Hodgkinson's greatest achievement.\n\n\"I think she would like to do it in the UK. London always delivers a great crowd, a great occasion. In 2026 I think she can definitely run under 1:54...\n\n\"If she goes in on interrupted training, she really does stand a chance.\"",

He is going to deliver, for the team and viewers. He is entertaining. He is hitting the ball well in the nets.\"\n\nFormer India captain Sunil Gavaskar feels pressure is affecting the 25-year-old batter. He believes Abhishek is trying too hard to hit big shots from the first ball instead of settling in. \n\n“Abhishek Sharma is a lovely guy, but expectations seem to be weighing on him. If he had started well against the USA, it would have been different. Now, the pressure of being the big six-hitter and top batter is showing,\" Gavaskar said.\n\n\"With his shot range, he needs to spend time in the middle. He cannot try to hit a boundary or six on the first ball of his innings. If the big shots come, fine. But he shouldn’t force himself to play the big shots across the line,” he added.\n\nHe also advised Abhishek to start slowly and build his innings. \n\n“Take a single and get off the mark. Even four dot balls don’t matter. He can make up for them later. He needs to play smart. Spend an hour or two settling in, then play his natural game. First, just get off the mark. Every batter wants that first run. Once he gets it, everything will fall into place,” he added.\n\nAssistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate also backed Abhishek and said he showed good form in training after recovering from illness. \n\nHe said Abhishek batted well in the nets and should be fine in the next phase.\n\nWith India reaching the Super 8s, the team hopes Abhishek will regain confidence and perform when it matters most.",

    "fullText": "The World War II submarine USS Lionfish was part of America's \"Silent Service.\"\n\nDespite comprising less than 2% of all US Navy vessels during World War II, submarines like the USS Lionfish sank 55% of Japanese vessels in battle.\n\nThis once-fearsome vessel is now a 311-foot-long museum exhibit, allowing the public to learn about its top-secret wartime operations.\n\nTake a look inside the USS Lionfish.\n\nOver the Balao-class submarine's two war patrols, she sank a Japanese submarine, destroyed a schooner, and rescued the crew of a downed American B-29 bomber.\n\nThe USS Lionfish was recommissioned for the Korean War, serving from 1951 to 1953.\n\nFrom 1960 to 1971, the USS Lionfish served as a reserve training submarine, teaching crew members to operate similar vessels.\n\nTickets to Battleship Cove cost $25 per adult. I visited the museum in January to take a closer look at the retired submarine.\n\nThe forward torpedo room featured six torpedo tubes, each storing a torpedo, and 10 reloads. The 16 crew members slept alongside the torpedoes on pull-out bunks, remaining ready to fire at all times.\n\nIn the officers' pantry, meals for the higher-ranking crew members were reheated and plated on Navy china. They ate the same food as the rest of the sailors, but in a fancier setting.\n\nIt could also serve as an operating room in medical emergencies.\n\nOfficers enjoyed more privacy on board than enlisted men.\n\nThe commanding officer's stateroom featured a small desk that functioned as a private workspace.\n\nChief petty officers served as liaisons between the officers and the crew. This room was also colloquially known as the \"goat locker\" since the more experienced officers were affectionately nicknamed \"old goats.\"\n\nPersonnel files, orders of supplies, and other administrative tasks were the yeoman's domain.\n\nThe commanding officer issued orders from the control center or the conning tower located directly above. The USS Lionfish's conning tower wasn't open to the public, but I did get to look inside one while touring another Balao-class submarine, the USS Becuna.\n\nThe USS Lionfish was equipped with sonar, or \"sound navigation and ranging,\" to listen for enemy ships in the surrounding waters.\n\nThe galley prepared four meals a day: breakfast, lunch, dinner, and midnight rations known as \"mid-rats.\"\n\nFrozen and refrigerated food was stored in compartments underneath the floor.\n\nOther Balao-class submarines held 35 or 36 bunks in this space.\n\nEach engine room was responsible for half of the ship's electric and propulsion power.\n\nWhile surfaced, the submarine's four diesel engines powered its generators, which in turn powered the ship's motors. While submerged, storage batteries powered the motors.\n\nAround 13 enlisted men worked and slept in the after torpedo room, which featured four torpedo tubes.\n\nOver 50 submarines underwent a Greater Underwater Propulsive Power 1-A, or \"GUPPY,\" modernization after World War II. However, the USS Lionfish remained as it was.\n\nMuseum staff and volunteers are working to restore the USS Lionfish and preserve its original configuration. Even in frigid temperatures, I saw volunteers holding tools and walking carefully around the deck's open panels, revealing the complex mechanics beneath.",

    "fullText": "Narendra Modi’s thirst to supercharge economic growth is matched by US desire to inject AI into world’s biggest democracy\n\nIndia celebrates 80 years of independence from the UK in August 2027. At about that same moment, “early versions of true super intelligence” could emerge, Sam Altman, the co-founder of OpenAI, said this week.\n\nIt’s a looming coincidence that raised a charged question at the AI Impact summit in Delhi, hosted by India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi: can India avoid returning to the status of a vassal state when it imports AI to raise the prospects of its 1.4 billion people?\n\nModi’s hunger to harness AI’s capability is great. He compared it on Thursday to a turning point that resets the direction of civilisation, such as “when the first sparks were struck from stone”. The most common analogy heard among the thousands of visitors to the summit was the dawn of electricity, but Modi was talking about fire.\n\nHis desire to use AI to supercharge Indian economic growth is matched by that of the big US tech companies. OpenAI, Google and Anthropic all played prominent roles at the summit, announcing deals to get ChatGPT, Gemini and Claude AIs into more people’s hands.\n\nThe Trump administration, seeing AI as central to its battle for supremacy with China, was clearing the path for the three AI companies. The US government signed the Pax Silica, a technology agreement that binds India closer to US tech and away from Beijing.\n\nAt the signing, Jacob Helberg, the US under secretary of state for economic affairs, emphasised the threat from China if India should even think about looking elsewhere for its AI. “We have seen the lights of a great Indian city extinguished by a keystroke,” he said, in an apparent reference to a suspected Chinese cyber-attack on Mumbai in 2020.\n\nIndia lacks the semiconductors, power plants and vast gigawatt datacentres to go it alone. In common with most other countries, it faces a choice between US and Chinese AI models. Which they choose could have profound consequences for who controls India’s future, because if AI’s power emerges as predicted, it will not only tweak economic and social structures, but become their new bedrock.\n\nStuart Russell, a professor of artificial intelligence at the University of California, Berkeley, who closely follows India’s progress, said: “If we get to AGI [artificial general intelligence], AI is going to be producing 80% of the global economy. All manufacturing, most agriculture, all services will be just done; managed by AI, produced by AI.”\n\nImagine, he said, an Indian village priced out of having a health centre. In the future, AI could design the hospital and “along comes a bunch of giant quad copters carrying the materials, and a bunch of robots come and assemble everything. Two weeks later, you’ve got a hospital.”\n\nIn this scenario, technology becomes integral to a country’s wellbeing. Elements of sovereignty can be fought over, but how successful that will be remains to be seen. AI’s power is such that its controller gains enormous leverage.\n\nAnthropic’s chief executive, Dario Amodei, told the summit: “It may sound absurd, but AI can even help India achieve a standout 25% economic growth.” If that were to happen, it would take India to a per-capita GDP in a decade that is equivalent to Greece today. How could a leader resist?\n\nModi’s tech secretary, Shri Krishnan, said India realised it must ally with like-minded countries to ensure it did not become “enslaved”. It is a high-stakes decision.\n\nIndia appears unlikely to turn to China, for now. It has the AI models, but there are tensions on the Himalayan border, and Chinese companies and leaders were scarce at the summit.\n\nWill India thrive with US AI? Silicon Valley companies talk of cooperation not control. Chris Lehane, OpenAI’s head of global policy, said: “We don’t see India as a customer, we see it as a strategic partner.”\n\nUS officials framed the deal with India as an alliance of two nations that “broke centuries of colonial rule”, and as “two great democracies saying we will build together”.\n\nThe Guardian asked Michael Kratsios, Donald Trump’s science and technology adviser, if India risked being controlled by the US under a form of digital colonialism.\n\n“I would say it is actually the opposite,” he said. “Any country that builds on top of the American AI stack will have the most open, independently controlled, secured stack the world has to offer. And that is why we are soon keen to share it with so many countries that are prioritising their AI sovereignty.”\n\nRussell sees another possibility. “I think the American companies want to get in at that high-school and middle-school level to create basically a bunch of AI addicts who can’t tie their shoelaces without the help of AI,” he said. “Silicon Valley has always been about eyeballs. You monetise later and it works. Google and Facebook generate vast amounts of money.”\n\nCould India build its own AI? It is investing billions in datacentres and semiconductor capacity, but it takes years to come online.\n\nAltman was asked on Thursday how Indian entrepreneurs could build their own AI and his response was blunt. “Look, the way this works is we’re going to tell you it’s totally hopeless to compete with us on training foundation and you shouldn’t even try, and it’s your job to try anyway and I believe both of those things.”\n\nIndia can press US tech companies to adapt their AIs to its kaleidoscope of languages and cultures, and attempt to insist on guardrails. There is much at stake. As the summit came to a close, Joanna Shields, a former Facebook and Google executive and a UK minister for internet safety, warned: “If we have a world where we are accepting models from just the global north, we will lose so much of our cultural diversity, our uniqueness as people, wherever we come from … We don’t want to develop a monoculture based on a handful of models that everybody uses around the world and we lose that richness of who we are, what makes us human.”",

    "description": "President Trump was the first to invoke the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 to set tariffs on imported goods from more than 100 countries.",
    "fullText": "The Supreme Court ruled on Friday that President Trump exceeded his authority when he imposed sweeping tariffs on imports from nearly every U.S. trading partner, a major setback for his administration’s second-term agenda.\n\nThe court’s 6-3 decision has significant implications for the U.S. economy, consumers and the president’s trade policy. The Trump administration had said that a loss at the Supreme Court could force the government to unwind trade deals with other countries and potentially pay hefty refunds to importers.\n\nMr. Trump is the first president to claim that a 1970s emergency statute, which does not mention the word “tariffs,” allowed him to unilaterally impose the duties without congressional approval.\n\nWriting for the majority, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. said that statute does not authorize the president to impose tariffs.\n\n“The president asserts the extraordinary power to unilaterally impose tariffs of unlimited amount, duration, and scope. In light of the breadth, history, and constitutional context of that asserted authority, he must identify clear congressional authorization to exercise it,” the chief justice wrote.\n\nJustices Clarence Thomas, Samuel A. Alito Jr. and Brett M. Kavanaugh dissented.\n\nThe decision on Friday left uncertain the extent to which those who paid tariffs might be able to obtain refunds, with Justice Kavanaugh warning that any refund process could be a substantial “mess.”\n\nThe United States “may be required to refund billions of dollars to importers who paid” the tariffs, he wrote, “even though some importers may have already passed on costs to consumers or others.”\n\nThe court’s ruling, backed by justices from across the ideological spectrum, was a rare and significant example of the Supreme Court pushing back on Mr. Trump’s agenda. Since he returned to the White House, the court’s conservative majority had overwhelmingly issued emergency orders allowing the president to carry out his policies on a temporary basis. But the decision on Friday will have a more lasting impact.\n\nTwo of Mr. Trump’s appointees — Justices Neil M. Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett — voted with Chief Justice Roberts and the three liberal justices.\n\nMr. Trump called the Supreme Court’s ruling “a disgrace” while speaking to the nation’s governors on Friday, according to two people familiar with his comments.\n\nEarly last year, Mr. Trump invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 to set tariffs on imported goods from more than 100 countries. He said his goal was to reduce the trade deficit and spur more manufacturing in the United States. Since then, he has used the tariffs to raise revenue and to pressure other countries in trade negotiations.\n\nA dozen states and a group of small businesses, including an educational toy manufacturer and a wine importer, sued over the tariffs, saying the president had unlawfully infringed on Congress’s power under the Constitution to impose taxes. The businesses, which rely on imported goods, argued in court filings that the tariffs had disrupted their operations and led to higher prices for consumers and cutbacks in staffing.\n\nPratik Shah, the lead lawyer for the toy company, said in a statement that the justices had “upheld the foundational separation-of-powers principle that our small-business client has been fighting for: no president has boundless power to tax Americans.”\n\nIn court filings and social media posts, the president and his advisers cast the outcome of the Supreme Court case as critical to his trade and foreign policies, making clear he would see defeat as a personal rebuke. Without the emergency power, the solicitor general had warned the justices, there would be economic ruin akin to the Great Depression, in addition to an interruption of trade negotiations and diplomatic embarrassment.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury has collected roughly $240 billion in tariff revenue since April 2, 2025 labeled “Liberation Day,” by President Trump. The research firm Capital Economics estimated that if the Treasury is forced to issue refunds, the cost would run to about $120 billion or 0.5 percent of gross domestic product.\n\nBut even while battling in court, the president began to explore alternatives to the 1977 law. Mr. Trump’s top trade negotiator Jamieson Greer said last month that the administration would move quickly to replace any emergency tariffs invalidated by the court with other levies. The president has already used other statutes to set tariffs, including national security-related ones on some specific goods and industries. Still, other laws that more clearly afford the president the power to impose duties are more limited and less flexible than the emergency law.\n\nMr. Trump initially set tariffs on goods imported into the United States from China, Canada and Mexico, saying the levies were a punishment for those nations’ failing to stop the flow of fentanyl. In April, he expanded the duties to imports on goods from nearly all trading partners, saying they were needed to address trade deficits with the rest of the world.\n\nUnder the 1970s-era law, the president has the authority to take certain steps in response to a national emergency to “deal with any unusual and extraordinary threat” to “the national security, foreign policy or economy of the United States.” That includes the power to “regulate” the “importation” of foreign property. Past presidents have relied on that language to place sanctions or embargoes on other countries, but not to impose taxes. But the administration has argued that phrase also gives Mr. Trump the power to levy tariffs.\n\nThe affected businesses countered that the word “regulate” did not encompass the imposition of tariffs. The statute does not include the words “tariffs,” “taxes” or “duties.”\n\nDuring oral arguments in November, several conservative justices sharply questioned the Trump administration’s lawyer about whether Congress had intentionally delegated to the president broad taxing powers, which the Constitution generally reserves for lawmakers.\n\nIn its 21-page opinion, the majority said it was telling that for half a century, no other president had invoked the statute to impose “any tariffs — let alone tariffs of this magnitude and scope.”\n\nThe two words “regulate” and “importation,” the court said, do not give the president the power to “impose tariffs on imports from any country, of any product, at any rate, for any amount of time.”\n\nChief Justice Roberts said the president’s use of the statute had run afoul of the “major questions doctrine,” which requires Congress to use plain and direct language to authorize sweeping economic actions by the executive branch. The court relied on the same doctrine to strike down President Joseph R. Biden’s student loan forgiveness program.\n\nThe three liberal justices agreed with the overall ruling, but insisted the same result could have been reached without applying the doctrine, which they have been critical of in the past.\n\nJustice Neil M. Gorsuch wrote a lengthy and forceful separate opinion agreeing that Mr. Trump had overstepped his authority and defending Congress as the proper branch to impose taxes.\n\n“Yes, legislating can be hard and take time. And, yes, it can be tempting to bypass Congress when some pressing problem arises,” he wrote. “But the deliberative nature of the legislative process was the whole point of its design.”\n\nIn dissent, Justice Kavanaugh said the president should be able to impose tariffs under his power to conduct foreign affairs and noted that they had helped the administration negotiate trade deals worth trillions of dollars.\n\nEven so, Justice Kavanaugh laid out other ways the president could set duties through different federal statutes.\n\n“So the court’s decision is not likely to greatly restrict presidential tariff authority going forward,” he wrote. “But the court’s decision is likely to generate other serious practical consequences in the near term.”\n\nThe case reached the Supreme Court after three lower courts concluded the tariffs were unlawful.\n\nIn August, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled 7 to 4 that the emergency statute did not authorize the sweeping tariffs while declining to decide whether the statute might allow Mr. Trump to impose more limited duties.\n\n“Whenever Congress intends to delegate to the president the authority to impose tariffs, it does so explicitly,” the appeals court’s majority said.\n\nAbbie VanSickle Tyler Pager and @Patti Cohen contributed reporting.",

    "fullText": "The Supreme Court scrambled the US trade landscape Friday when it struck down the centerpiece of President Trump’s second-term tariff program, ruling 6-3 that his sweeping blanket tariffs are illegal.\n\nThe ruling came just over one year into Trump’s second term and after skeptical questioning from key justices during oral arguments last November and appears set to immediately halt a massive section of Trump’s tariffs. Those tariffs were first announced last year on “Liberation Day” using a 1977 law called the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).\n\n“IEEPA does not authorize the President to impose tariffs,” read the decision, written by Chief Justice John Roberts.\n\nTrump attacked the high court in his first response Friday, particularly the justices in the majority, saying they were a \"disgrace to our nation.\" He hinted that the administration would pursue alternative methods toward implementing its trade goals.\n\nThe ruling also raised the question of refunds, which could return an estimated $129 billion to importers in the months ahead. It upholds two lower courts — including the US Court of International Trade — that previously found Trump did not have the authority to impose global tariffs using the 1977 law.\n\nThe decision will likely have wide-ranging ramifications, affecting global trade, consumers, companies, inflation and the pocketbooks of every American. In recent weeks, Trump has already made plans to roll back some tariffs on metals, including on steel and aluminum goods, as he and his administration seek to battle an affordability crisis ahead of the midterm elections.\n\nThe US Supreme Court changed the US trade agenda on Friday, ruling that blanket tariffs are illegal and striking down President Trump's most sweeping tariffs.\n\nIn a 6-3 decision, the court held that the 1977 International Emergency Powers ACT (IEEPA) does not give Trump the authority to impose taxes without approval from Congress.\n\nThis ruling will mean that much of the administration's current tariff agenda will be brought to a halt, especially those tariffs first announced in April last year, on what has come to be known as Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs.\n\nToday, economists at Penn-Wharton said that over $175 billion in tariff revenue may need to be refunded if the Supreme Court rules against Trump's tariffs.\n\nHowever, according to SCOTUSblog, the court mentioned nothing about whether the government should go about returning the billions of dollars it made from importers.\n\nJustices Clarence Thomas, Brett Kavanaugh, and Samuel Alito all dissented.\n\nJustice Kavanaugh, in his dissent, said, \"The United States may be required to refund billions of dollars to importers who paid the IEEPA tariffs, even though some importers may have already passed on costs to consumers or others.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court majority that struck down President Trump's ability to issue blanket tariffs on US trading partners did not address the issue of refunds — that is, will companies be able to get them for the duties they paid ... that are now ruled unconstitutional?\n\nThough the Supreme Court majority didn't address it, the dissenting minority did. Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who authored the dissent, noted that the process could be a \"mess\" for the US Treasury to navigate.\n\nAfter the US Supreme Court struck down President Trump's tariffs, what are his options?\n\nTrump himself has said previously that the law he used to implement the tariffs is an essential tool in his toolbox. But other members of the administration have suggested that the White House could simply rebuild his tariff regime through other — albeit more cumbersome — methods.\n\nThe Associated Press has a good rundown of his options:\n\nThey run through them all here — read more.\n\nUS stocks rose in the immediate aftermath of the Supreme Court's decision to strike down President Trump's most sweeping tariffs. The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led gains.\n\nSectors with more exposure to tariffs saw a bigger bounce. The Dow Jones Transportation Average (^DJT) popped around 1%. Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) saw outsize gains, as did Stanley Black & Decker (SWK).\n\nHead over to our markets blog for full coverage of the stock market's reaction to the ruling.\n\nNovartis (NVS) CEO Vas Narasimhan met with President Trump at the White House on Wednesday, where the president said the company is set to build 11 plants in the US.\n\nTrump hit Switzerland with 39% tariffs last year, but then agreed to cut the duties to 15% in November. Last month, Novartis said it expected to be protected from tariffs under some agreements with the US and strong domestic manufacturing.\n\nThe Trump administration is pushing back on claims from the New York Federal Reserve that US consumers and businesses are bearing the brunt of higher costs due to President Trump's tariffs.\n\n\"The paper is an embarrassment,\" National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett told CNBC on Wednesday. \"I think it's the worst paper I've ever seen in the history of the Federal Reserve System.\n\nHowever, data from the JPMorgan Chase Institute, released Thursday, also found that tariffs paid by midsize US businesses tripled in 2025.\n\nYahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger reports on the latest news on Trump's tariffs:\n\nJapan plans to invest up to $36 billion in US oil, gas, and critical mineral projects, part of Tokyo's $550 billion commitment under the trade agreement it struck with President Trump last year.\n\n“Our MASSIVE Trade Deal with Japan has just launched!” Trump posted on Tuesday on social media. “The scale of these projects are so large, and could not be done without one very special word, TARIFFS.”\n\nJapan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said that the projects will help build more resilient supply chains through partnerships in crucial areas for economic security.\n\nThe Supreme Court has added next Friday, Feb. 20, as a decision day, the first time in weeks it could potentially issue a verdict on the closely watched case involving President Trump's tariffs.\n\nNext Friday is listed as a non-argument session and conference day on the high court's calendar.\n\nThe high court heard arguments on the tariff case in November on an expedited basis, and both liberal- and conservative-leaning justices asked skeptical questions about Trump's authority to impose the tariffs.\n\nThe duties at issue are Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs, in which the president slapped levies ranging from 10% to 50% on imports from virtually all US trading partners. The Trump administration has said a defeat at the Supreme Court would only prompt it to impose the duties via other legal means — though Trump himself has said those processes would be more cumbersome and has implored the court to uphold the tariffs.\n\nOn Wednesday night, President Trump pressured House Republicans to support his tariffs, even though rising living costs have upset many voters.\n\nWhile six Republicans voted against his current tariffs on Canadian goods, 210 others remained loyal to Trump. But experts say this could harm them in the upcoming midterm elections, as many voters remain concerned about rising prices.\n\nA report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York argues that Americans are paying for almost all of the additional costs from President Donald Trump's tariffs.\n\nPresident Trump's tariffs faced a rebuke on Wednesday as the US House of Representatives voted to pass a resolution seeking to terminate the national emergency measures Trump used to impose tariffs on Canada. Six Republicans voted with Democrats to scrap Trump's tariffs against the US's neighbor.\n\nYahoo Finance's Washington Correspondent Ben Werschkul outlines the outcome of yesterday's vote by the US House of Representatives and what it means for Trump's tariffs:\n\nThe US and Japan are nearing the completion of the first of three projects that Tokyo agreed to fund as part of its $550 billion investment in the US and tariff agreement.\n\nBloomberg reports that the three projects include a data center led by SoftBank Group Corp. (9984.T), a deep-sea oil terminal in the Gulf of Mexico, and semiconductors.\n\nAccording to the report, SoftBank didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nConfusion over the trade deal between the US and India emerged on Wednesday after the White House adjusted language around agricultural goods.\n\nIn the updated statement, the US has removed a reference to pulses, a staple food in India that includes lentils and chickpeas.\n\nIn the old version, the statement says that India will remove tariffs on \"certain pulses\", whereas in the new version, the word \"pulses\" has been removed. The old version also says India is \"committed to buying more American products,\" whereas the new statement says \"... intends to buy...\"\n\nThe countries appear to have made other changes to the statement, too.\n\nThe US House of Representatives will vote on Wednesday on whether to reject some of President Trump's tariffs. The vote comes months ahead of the midterm elections, at a time when many Americans are concerned about the rising cost of living.\n\nToday's vote will start with a resolution to stop Trump's tariffs on Canada, which currently include a 35% tariff on imported items such as steel, aluminum, and copper, as well as a 25% duty on non-US cars. The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), the free trade agreement Trump has threatened to scrap, does exempt some of these goods.\n\nThe House vote will proceed despite Speaker Mike Johnson's attempt to block it.\n\nTrump has there would be no extra cost to the American people. A report from the nonpartisan Tax Foundation has found that these tariffs will amount to an average tax increase per US household of $1,000 in 2025 and $1,300 in 2026.\n\nThe Financial Times reports that the Trump administration is planning to exempt hyperscalers Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG), and Microsoft (MSFT) from forthcoming chip tariffs as Big Tech races to build data centers to power artificial intelligence.\n\nMexico is trying to send fuel to Cuba to prevent a power collapse, but it is searching for a way to do this without being hit by tariffs from the US.\n\nWashington has threatened tariffs on any country that attempts to help Cuba by supplying fuel.\n\nCuba has been under a 60-year embargo from the US dating back to the 1960s.\n\nEstee Lauder (EL) shares slumped 10% before the bell on Thursday, despite beating analysts' estimates on earnings per share and revenue, but tariff woes caused the beauty group's shares to tumble.\n\nThe Trump administration will be launching a $12 billion \"emergency warehouse\" for critical minerals needed to build cars, phones, and jets. The plan will include buying and storing these minerals now. The US hopes this will reduce its and other countries' reliance on China for supplies.\n\nThe critical mineral's stockpile news was released on Monday, and Vice President JD Vance plans to deliver a keynote speech on Wednesday at a meeting with the Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other officials from Europe, Asia, and Africa.\n\nThe Trump administration said on Tuesday that it plans to reduce India's tariffs on American industrial goods to zero from 13.5%, but will allow India to protect its farmers from foreign competition.\n\nThe US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer made the statement a day after President Trump agreed to reduce tariffs on New Delhi, claiming India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi agreed to stop purchasing Russian Oil.\n\nTrump hit India with 50% tariffs last year, 25% of which was a penalty for purchasing Russian oil, which Trump claimed was helping to fund the war in Ukraine.\n\nPresident Trump announced Monday that the \"reciprocal\" tariff rate on goods from India would drop to 18% from 25%, but that announcement underplayed the extent of the tariff reduction in evidence Monday in what the president described as a trade deal between the two nations.\n\nA White House official confirmed that, in addition to the reduction Trump outlined, the White House is also planning to drop a separate tariff of 25% on Indian goods over its Russian oil purchases, which previously amounted to a 50% tariff on Indian goods.\n\nThe new total tariff rate of 18% was what Prime Minister Narendra Modi quickly touted in his own social media post after the call with Trump, offering “Big thanks to President Trump on behalf of the 1.4 billion people of India” but not outlining any of the changes on his end, which Trump listed.\n\nTrump said Monday that India had agreed to stop buying Russian oil and also reduce their tariffs and non-tariff barriers against the United States \"to ZERO.\"\n\nPresident Trump on Monday said the US and India had agreed to a trade deal after he spoke with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nTrump said the baseline US tariff rate on goods from India would drop to 18% from 25%. The US president also claimed that Modi had \"agreed to stop buying Russian Oil.\" India is also currently facing an additional 25% \"secondary\" tariff on its purchases of Russian oil.\n\n\"Our amazing relationship with India will be even stronger going forward,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n\nModi also agreed to buy American products \"at a much higher level,\" Trump said.\n\nThe apparent US deal with India comes as US trade partners are clinching long-negotiated deals in a rebuke to the Trump tariff regime. India and the EU announced a trade deal last week that the EU dubbed the \"mother of all deals,\" which came after years of negotiations between the two sides.\n\nPresident Trump is planning to launch a $12 billion minerals stockpile, according to Bloomberg News, in a bid to counter the US's reliance on China for rare earth materials.\n\nThe initiative has been dubbed Project Vault and will combine $1.67 billion in private capital with a $10 billion loan from the US Export-Import Bank. It is hoped that this venture will help acquire and store minerals for automakers, tech companies and other manufacturers.\n\nRare earth materials are key components used in a variety of products, such as smartphones, cars and rechargeable batteries. China has the largest reserve of rare earths and last year restricted exports of the materials due to Trump's tariffs. In November, China lifted the restrictions as part of a one-year trade truce with the US.\n\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Friday that her country will look for alternate ways to help Cuba, including \"diplomatic\" solutions after President Trump signed an order to levy tariffs on countries that supply Cuba with oil, Reuters reported. Mexico is one of the last nations that supplies Cuba with oil.\n\nThe US trade deficit — the value of imports minus the value of exports — swung wider in November as trade continued to shift in response to the Trump administration's tariff policies.\n\nPresident Trump's global tariffs have failed to stop Toyota Motors (TM), the Japanese car company said on Thursday that it had sold a record 11.3 million vehicles globally in 2025.\n\nToyota Motors will retain its position as the world's top-selling automaker in 2025, and its recent sales growth has come despite Trump's aggressive tariff policies.\n\nTrump initially imposed 25% tariffs on Japanese automakers but reduced them to 15% after reaching a deal with Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi.\n\nThe stock rose 2% during early trading on Thursday.",

    "description": "A pioneering energy-generating device utilizes reliable wind speeds at an altitude of 6,500 feet (2,000 meters).",
    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nA Chinese energy firm has successfully tested an experimental blimp-like wind turbine capable of generating energy in the skies above cities and inland communities.\n\nDeveloped by Beijing Linyi Yunchuan Energy Technology, the S2000 airborne wind energy system (AWES) is a large, helium-filled airship containing 12 wind turbines.\n\nThe craft ascends thousands of feet into the air to harness the stable wind speeds at higher altitudes, which spin the turbines and generate electricity. This is then sent down the tethering cable to the ground below, where it can enter the grid.\n\nIn its test flight, the manufacturers flew the S2000 at an altitude of 6,560 feet (2,000 meters) above Sichuan Province, generating 385 kilowatt-hours of electricity.\n\nThis is enough to power the average U.S. household for approximately 13.3 days, per usage figures provided by the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\n\nIn total, the S2000 clocks in at 197 feet (60 m) long, 131 feet (40 m) high and 131 feet (40 m) wide, as reported by Global Times. The system is rated at 3 megawatts total power capacity.\n\nThe new technology has a couple of potential uses, the developers suggest. \"One is for off-grid settings like border outposts, where it can serve as a relatively stable conventional energy source,” explained Weng Hanke, CTO at Linyi Yunchuan Energy Technology, as reported by Tide News — an affiliate of the state-owned Zhejiang Daily Press Group — via Global Times.\n\n\"The other is to complement traditional ground-based wind power systems, creating a three-dimensional approach to energy supply.\"\n\nIf realized at scale, the approach could have transformational potential for countries with constrained space for onshore wind generation, such as many in mainland Europe, as well as those without the shallow seabeds necessary for offshore wind power generation, such as Japan.\n\nHowever, the reliability of the tethered cable for delivering stable power to the grid will require further testing.\n\nIn all but the most remote rural communities, the 1.25-mile (2,000 m) cable could present a dangerous obstacle to aircraft. In the U.K., the Civil Aviation Authority requires those wishing to fly tethered balloons above 200 feet (60 m) to apply for special permission to avoid risk to aircraft sharing airspace with the balloon.\n\nBeyond its safety concerns, the S2000 will also need to undergo rigorous testing to ensure its viability for reliable commercial operations. Standard wind turbines require regular maintenance and the craft could prove difficult and more costly to service as it will have to return to the ground for every repair.\n\nWind turbines can generate more power where the wind power density — the measure of wind energy that can be harnessed at a given altitude — is higher. Offshore wind turbines, for example, can capture the higher, more consistent wind speeds over open water.\n\nThese offshore turbines can also be significantly larger than their onshore counterparts, with the hub of Chinese manufacturer Dongfang Electric’s DEW-26 MW-310 offshore turbine standing at 606.9 feet (185 m). Floating wind turbines can be similarly gigantic, with the tower for the recently-revealed, record breaking floating wind turbine from China Huaneng Group reaching 489 feet (152 m).\n\nFor example, the average offshore wind speed deemed suitable for wind farms at 295 feet (90 m) elevation within U.S. waters is 7 meters per second, per the Marine Cadastre National Viewer, a web-based data viewer produced by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Office for Coastal Management.\n\n—China builds record-breaking floating wind turbine — it could change the face of renewable energy\n\n—Chinese scientists have found a way to make batteries more efficient — by using water\n\nIt’s hard to state the exact wind speed at various altitudes, as this varies by location and weather.\n\nThe aerospace group Omnidea estimates that at altitudes between 328 and 8,200 feet (100 and 2,500 m), wind power density increases by approximately a factor of six, with an average wind speed of 33.5 mph (15 m/s) at 8,200 feet\n\nThis highlights the potential efficiencies to be unlocked with greater exploitation of higher-altitude wind speeds with tethered, flying wind turbines such as the S2000.",

The work is definitely there.\"\n\nAustralia's poor World Cup follows their 4-1 victory over England in the Ashes. They have not lost an Ashes series since 2015. They have won six 50-over World Cups but only one of the 10 men's T20 World Cups.\n\nThey lost bowlers Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood to injury before this tournament while left-armer Mitchell Starc has also retired from T20s, but their thinking often appeared muddled throughout the group stage here.\n\n\"The Australian public struggle with the fact they don't get to see much white-ball cricket played,\" said 33-year-old Zampa.\n\n\"We play three to six games in the summer and do a lot of our work away from Australian time.\n\n\"They don't get to see the way we play and prepare for these World Cups.\n\n\"It is disappointing it has ended like this but the work and time is as much as the other formats.\"\n\nZampa said he was \"feeling pretty hollow\" after the win over Oman.\n\nHe took four wickets but said it was the \"worst-feeling four-for I have ever got\".\n\nSeamer Xavier Bartlett bowled Aamir Kaleem with the first ball of the match and the seamer barely celebrated - a clear sign of Australia's disappointment at their early exit.\n\nThough the flat atmosphere continued, Australia were clinical. Wasim Ali's 32 was the highest score for Oman, who depart the tournament with four defeats from four.\n\nCaptain Marsh, seemingly keen to hit through any frustrations at his side's run, then crashed seven fours and four sixes, including two huge hits over the leg side, to wrap up victory in quick time.\n\nOnly 12 runs were needed when left-arm spinner Shakeel Ahmed dismissed Travis Head for 32. Marsh finished unbeaten on 64 from 33.\n\nAustralia's victory concludes the group stage of the World Cup - this was one of few mismatches between the lower and higher-ranked sides.\n\nThe Super 8s begin on Saturday with a meeting between New Zealand and Pakistan in Colombo.

    "description": "India's dominant T20 World Cup victory over Pakistan shattered digital records, attracting 163 million viewers, the highest ever for an ICC T20 World Cup match. Ishan Kishan's explosive 77 powered India to 175/7, a target Pakistan couldn't chase, falling for 114. This win secured India's Super Eight spot unbeaten.",
    "fullText": "The scintillating performance by the Men in Blue also contributed to a 56% growth in reach over the India-Pakistan clash during the 2024 edition. Fans tuned in for a whopping 20 billion minutes of total watch time across all screens, reflecting immense engagement.\n\nOn the field, India made a ruthless statement, comfortably defeating Pakistan by 61 runs to secure a place in the Super Eight stage unbeaten. After electing to field first, Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha’s surprise move to bowl in the opening over produced an early wicket, dismissing Abhishek Sharma. But Ishan Kishan immediately turned the tide with a power-packed display, asserting dominance from the start. Pulling Shaheen Shah Afridi for a six on the first ball, Kishan continued to attack, supported by Tilak Varma as India racked up 52 for 1 after six overs, Kishan contributing 42 off just 25 balls.\n\nKishan’s blitz extended beyond the powerplay, hitting a 27-ball fifty and ending with a brilliant 77 off 40 balls, before being dismissed by Saim Ayub. Pakistan relied heavily on spin, using six spinners in the innings—the most ever by a team in a T20 World Cup and joint-most by a Full Member in a T20I. Saim Ayub impressed, removing Tilak Varma and Hardik Pandya and finishing with 3 wickets for 25 runs, nearly claiming a hat-trick. India closed their innings at 175 for 7, bolstered by contributions from Suryakumar Yadav (32), Shivam Dube (27), and Rinku Singh (11).\n\nPakistan’s chase never gained traction. Hardik Pandya dismissed Shahibzada Farhan for a duck, followed by Saim Ayub and Jasprit Bumrah dismantling the middle order. Even Salman Ali Agha and Babar Azam faltered under pressure, while Usman Khan’s 44 off 34 balls was the only bright spark. India’s bowlers, led by Jasprit Bumrah (2/17), Axar Patel (2/29), and Varun Chakravarthy (2/16), ensured Pakistan was bowled out for 114 in 17.5 overs, sealing a one-sided victory.\n\nBrief Scores:\nIndia: 175/7 (Ishan Kishan 77, Suryakumar Yadav 32, Shivam Dube 27; Saim Ayub 3/25)\nPakistan: 114 all out (Usman Khan 44; Jasprit Bumrah 2/17, Axar Patel 2/29, Varun Chakravarthy 2/16)",

    "title": "Gap's CEO has 3 rules for cutting down on meetings — and asking if he's on the invite list breaks one of them",
    "description": "Mark Breitbard, CEO of Gap's global brand, said he questions recurring meetings and looks to end discussions early whenever possible.",
    "fullText": "In an era of hyper-efficiency, leaders are taking a close look at the meetings on their calendars — and Gap's CEO is no exception.\n\nSince returning to lead Gap's global brand in 2020, CEO Mark Breitbard told Business Insider he's been focused on restoring the brand's relevance, and part of that has included stripping away bureaucracy and unnecessary layers.\n\nMeetings are often viewed as the pinnacle of corporate bureaucracy, — and Breitbard said he follows three rules to keep them in check.\n\nBreitbard said that if no one is sure why a recurring meeting is happening, it should be examined critically.\n\n\"If it's a default meeting, like it happens every single week, then I feel like we need to question it,\" Breitbard told Business Insider.\n\nHis second rule is to keep the invite list tight. Breitbard said it's a red flag when he walks into a meeting, and someone asks, \"Oh, are you in this meeting?\"\n\n\"If you ask, the answer is 'no.' I clearly don't need to be here if you have to ask,\" Breitbard said, suggesting that the meeting shouldn't be so big that people are invited without having a clear purpose for attending.\n\nHis third habit rule is to end on time — or early. He said when it's near the end of a meeting, there often comes a time when people say something along the lines of, \"Well, we have five more minutes…\"\n\n\"We don't have five more minutes,\" Breitbard said. \"We're done now.\"\n\nBreitbard said that people often book 30-minute meetings, but he's inclined to finish earlier if the purpose of the discussion has been accomplished.\n\n\"At minute 24, I say, 'OK, good, this was great. Thanks, everyone,'\" Breitbard said, adding that when people question if it's really time to end, he says, 'Yeah, we got what we needed.'\"\n\nThe debate over meetings and how they should be run isn't new. In 2018, Elon Musk said in an email that large meetings should be scrapped or kept \"very short,\" and billionaire investor Mark Cuban has similarly said they get in the way of his productivity.\n\nBut in today's results-driven work culture, the push to rein in the amount of time spent in meetings in has taken on a new form of urgency.\n\nSnowflake CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy told Business Insider in December that \"meetings are like bureaucracies,\" and he has four rules for managing his own, which involve keeping gatherings short, ensuring there's a purpose, and making sure there's an agenda and notes.\n\nInstagram chief Adam Mosseri, also recently announced that recurring meetings would be canceled every six months and only re-added if \"absolutely necessary.\" He also encouraged making recurring one-on-ones biweekly \"by default\" and said workers should decline meetings that interfere with \"focus blocks.\"",

    "title": "PwC engineers built an AI agent to tackle the corporate world's least sexy task: spreadsheets",
    "description": "When tech exec Matt Wood arrived at PwC, he found that massive spreadsheets were \"all anybody was working on.\"",
    "fullText": "The real way to judge a company's AI expertise isn't in the flashy headlines, but by looking at the \"unsexy\" work rolling out behind the scenes, Matt Wood, PwC's global and US commercial technology and innovation officer, told Business Insider.\n\nIf Wood's theory holds — that real AI prowess shows up in unglamorous advances — PwC's latest launch is certainly notable. After all, what could be less sexy than spreadsheets?\n\nThe Big Four firm announced this week that it has developed a \"frontier AI agent\" capable of reasoning over vast, enterprise-grade spreadsheets — something that conventional AI systems struggle with because of their complexity, size, and interdependencies.\n\nThe agent can understand and navigate spreadsheets, mimicking \"how experienced practitioners work: scanning, searching, jumping across tabs, integrating charts and receipts, and reasoning,\" PwC said in a press release.\n\nWood, who joined PwC in 2024 from a role as vice president of AI at Amazon Web Services, said that when he started, he'd noticed the wraparound, ultra-wide monitors filled with spreadsheets: \"That's all anybody was working on,\" he said.\n\nBut these were not \"your school soccer team budget spreadsheet,\" said Wood. The spreadsheets that power large enterprises are enormously complex, often containing millions of cells, charts, graphs, images, receipts, and dozens of interlinked workbooks. \"They are more like financial engines than they are spreadsheets,\" he told Business Insider.\n\nThese files often underpin business-critical decisions, yet PwC \"found that even today's modern AI was very poorly suited to managing these big enterprise spreadsheets,\" Wood said.\n\n\"They just kind of shrug and give up for want of a better word.\"\n\nCreating an AI capable of understanding and reasoning across large, complicated spreadsheet applications is what PwC's engineers set out to solve. Their solution was a \"genuine advance in the field,\" Wood said.\n\nThe agent has unlocked use cases across assurance, advisory, and tax, and boosts time saving on some tasks \"from literally days to hours,\" said Wood.\n\nHe gave the example of audit walkthroughs, where teams previously spent weeks manually gathering and validating evidence across numerous complex spreadsheets that existing AI tools couldn't handle.\n\nNow, users simply upload the files, and the frontier agent automatically maps their structure, extracts relevant data, and performs validation and consistency checks — tasks that would otherwise require combing through millions of rows by hand.\n\nThe result is faster meetings, less back-and-forth with clients, and cleaner, structured data ready for deeper AI-driven analysis, he said.\n\nPwC's AI spreadsheet agent was built in-house by engineers — a function the firm has been rapidly expanding as it shifts beyond the traditional roles associated with the Big Four.\n\nIn January, PwC launched a dedicated tech engineering career track to attract more technical talent, saying it wants to become \"a destination for top engineering talent.\"\n\nPreviously, the firm offered only consulting and accounting career paths. Wood told Business Insider that adding the engineering track is \"a signpost\" of its future plans.\n\nAt the same time, PwC is retraining non-technical employees. The US branch of the firm recently announced a companywide workplace learning strategy focused on knowledge sharing and on developing a mix of human and AI skills needed for the future.\n\nWood described the work engineers do at PwC as having two modes: \"transforming today\" and \"building for tomorrow.\"\n\nThe first focuses on improving current workflows — reducing back-and-forth with clients, increasing trust, and delivering work more efficiently. The second reimagines professional services from scratch: \"If you were to start from a blank piece of paper, what would professional services look like in an AI agent world?\" said Wood.\n\nPwC engineers also work directly on client engagements, building AI systems tailored to specific projects. For example, they help organizations reorganize and redesign their finance functions from the ground up using agents, Wood said.\n\nMany of the consulting industry's top players are pursuing similar investments in technical talent as AI reshapes the work they do.\n\nAccenture, already one of consulting's most technically sophisticated players, has added nearly 40,000 AI and data professionals in the last two years. They now account for roughly 10% of its global headcount.\n\nEY, another Big Four firm, has added 61,000 technologists since 2023, according to its latest annual report.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "England batter Jos Buttler says he will not just bat for himself as he tries to correct a poor run of form at the T20 World Cup.\n\nButtler, arguably England's greatest white-ball batter, was out for three against Scotland and Italy and has not scored a fifty in 14 international innings this winter.\n\nAfter the 35-year-old was dismissed fourth ball looking to clear the infield for the second match in a row against Italy, former captain Nasser Hussain suggested Buttler should take time to build an innings.\n\nBut, speaking on his For the Love of Cricket podcast, external, Buttler said: \"I would love to just bat for 15 overs but I don't want to bat for 15 overs just for myself and ignore the game.\n\n\"You've got to still play the game.\n\n\"There are times I've been out of form in Test cricket and the batting coach might say 'rein it in and bat for an hour'.\n\n\"In T20 you have got to keep playing the scoreboard.\"\n\nIs Buttler's form a worry? England's T20 World Cup so far analysed\n\nButtler's last major contribution for England was 83 from 30 balls against South Africa in September but, given his illustrious career, his place in England's XI remains secure.\n\nHe scored 97 not out for Durban Super Giants in the SA20 in January but made 12, 20, 15, 22, three and one in his other innings there.\n\n\"I felt I was playing really well in the SA20 without getting scores,\" Buttler said. \"One thing I always pride myself on in T20 is if you get in, go and make a good contribution.\"\n\nButtler and England trained on Thursday for the first time since their win over Italy on Monday, after travelling to Sri Lanka.\n\nButtler had a lengthy regular net practice and then faced throw-downs from fielding coach Carl Hopkinson with a wet tennis ball on a soaked concrete strip - an apparent attempt to sharpen his reflexes.\n\nTeam-mate Jacob Bethell dismissed any doubts about the opener's form.\n\n\"He's fine,\" Bethell said. \"The options he has taken haven't come off but no one in that side is worried about Jos in terms of performance.\n\n\"He will come good when we need him in the big stages of this tournament.\"\n\nBethell trained with a bandage on a finger on his left hand. He suffered a cut during the defeat by West Indies and it has meant he has been unable to bowl.\n\nThe injury will be assessed again before England play co-hosts Sri Lanka in their first match of the Super 8s phase on Sunday in Pallekele.\n\nThey progressed through the group stage in unconvincing fashion with edgy wins over Italy, Scotland and Nepal, plus a defeat by West Indies, but before the World Cup they beat Sri Lanka 3-0 in a T20 series, with all three matches played in Pallekele.\n\n\"To beat a good Sri Lankan team at home in their conditions 3-0 was a massive confidence boost for us,\" Bethell said.\n\n\"You can feel it within the group the boys are confident coming back here.\n\n\"We know the conditions, we know how a couple of the teams are going to play. We're definitely, definitely very confident about this Super 8s.\"\n\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "John Stones has once again battled injury throughout the 2025/26 season. The England international has made only 14 appearances for Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City side in all competitions this season. Stones recently returned from an extended injury layoff and played 65 minutes of City’s 2-0 win over Salford City at the Etihad Stadium in their fourth-round FA Cup tie. John Stones could have an important role to play for Pep Guardiola’s side for the remainder of this season as they remain in the hunt for four trophies. Looking beyond this season, John Stones’ future seems to lie away from Manchester City, based on a recent report.\n\nIt was pleasing to see John Stones start Manchester City’s match against Salford City. He put in a workmanlike performance as he did his job well as City’s captain for the day and as a centre-back. It was clear that Stones was rusty, but the fact that he got through 65 minutes unscathed is a major positive for Manchester City. Stones has had a frustrating 25/26 season, so seeing him get through any match without suffering any injury setbacks is a pleasing sight.\n\nPep Guardiola was happy to see John Stones back on the pitch against Salford City. Guardiola admitted that Stones is someway off his best, but the fact he is back playing is good news. Speaking on John Stone’ return, Guardiola said: “It’s good he’s back. He still needs time. He’s not the John Stones we knew but that’s normal. His body language was really good and he had the tempo to fight the duels. After more than two months injured, he played 60 minutes.”\n\nIf John Stones can stay fit and rediscover his best form, he will have an important role to play as Manchester City remain in the hunt in four competitions. Stones offers Pep Guardiola a completely different option at centre-back to any of City’s other centre-backs. The hope is that the worst of Stones’ injury concerns are behind him so he can play a role across the back end of this season for his team.\n\nLooking further ahead, it does seem that we are in the final stages of John Stones’ Manchester City career. A new report from Mark Brus in his exclusive Daily Briefing column indicates that Stones won’t be offered a new contract at City. Stones’ current deal is set to expire at the end of this season. Furthermore, Brus reports that Bayern Munich have shown an interest in signing Stones at the end of this season. Bayern are reportedly considering making a move for Stones as they bid to strengthen their defence. AC Milan and Atletico Madrid are also mentioned by Brus as clubs monitoring the situation surrounding John Stones.\n\nWhat may hinder clubs in the chase to sign John Stones is his wage demands. Mark Brus reports that Everton have been ruled out of the potential race to sign the England international due to this factor. Despite a return to Everton being ruled out, John Stones seemingly has options if his Manchester City career ends at the end of this season. Players at this stage of their careers often look for the right environment to continue progressing. They weigh different opportunities and consider what comes next. Supporters tend to think in similar terms when deciding how to spend their time or money online, whether that means watching football, playing games, or picking up a Steam card online before moving on to their next title. Stones may yet face similar choices abroad as he looks to take the next step after City.\n\nIt was pleasing to see John Stones get through Manchester City’s FA Cup fourth-round win over Salford City unscathed. The hope is that Stones can contribute to his team across the final stages of this season. Given everything that Stones has done for City, he deserves to be a contributor as Pep Guardiola’s side chases honours on multiple fronts. The end may be coming for John Stones’ time at Manchester City. If it is, it would be better to see him have one last hurrah at City rather than spend his time on the treatment table.",

    "fullText": "Major League Soccer (MLS) kicks off its 31st season this weekend, ushering in another high-stakes campaign in a World Cup year.\n\nLionel Messi leads Inter Miami CF into the new term as they defend their 2025 MLS Cup crown against 29 rivals.\n\nIt has been 32 years since the United States hosted the 1994 FIFA World Cup, two years before the launch of MLS in 1996. Now, three decades later, MLS bids to become one of the world’s most exciting leagues.\n\nIn addition to Messi, several other elite stars are chasing the most prestigious piece of silverware in North American football, including LAFC’s Heung-min Son and Vancouver Whitecaps’ Thomas Muller.\n\nBoth are back for their first full season in MLS after making waves in their first campaign across the Atlantic upon arrival last summer.\n\nMLS has undergone profound changes since its inception in 1996, with all ten teams that launched the league towards the end of the 21st century still competing at the highest level.\n\nHowever, it’s worth noting that each of those ten sides has changed its name, crest, or both over time. MLS has been constantly evolving in recent decades, yet a historic change is on the horizon this time.\n\nMLS will stage its final full season under the traditional spring-to-fall format this year before switching to Europe’s summer-to-spring calendar in the summer of 2027.\n\nTo facilitate the transition, the league will introduce a shortened 14-game campaign from February to May next year before fully adopting the new schedule.\n\nFrom next season onwards, MLS will align its calendar with top European leagues such as the Premier League, La Liga and Serie A, marking the beginning of a new era.\n\nOn February 22–23, MLS kicks off its “MLS Is Back” weekend, with all 30 clubs taking the field.\n\nReigning champions Inter Miami could not have imagined a more challenging way to kick off their title defence, as they head to BMO Stadium to take on star-studded LAFC on the opening weekend.\n\nJavier Mascherano’s charges will play their inaugural match at Miami Freedom Park on April 5 against Austin FC.\n\nWith the 2026 World Cup set to unfold on American soil, MLS pause its season from May 26 to July 16 to make room for the world’s most prestigious international tournament.\n\nSince 11 cities will host the event, a number of club training facilities will be taken over by participating national teams, forcing the league officials to schedule a mid-season break.\n\nOn July 17–18, MLS resumes competition with marquee rivalry fixtures, including a mouth-watering derby between Los Angeles Galaxy and LAFC at Dignity Health Sports Park.\n\nOn July 30, MLS hosts the MLS All-Star Game in Charlotte.\n\nFinally, on November 7, Decision Day brings the regular season to a close as teams battle to secure play-off positioning.\n\nHistory beckons for Inter Miami as they could become only the third team in MLS history to win back-to-back titles following their maiden triumph last year.\n\nNeedless to say, all eyes will be on eight-time Ballon d’Or winner Messi, who reigned supreme during Inter’s title-winning campaign, bagging a jaw-dropping 35 goals in 34 league matches.\n\nMessi might be the Herons’ standout star, but Mascherano’s squad also features other high-profile names, like Sergio Busquets, Sergio Reguilon, Luis Suarez and Rodrigo De Paul.\n\nFurthermore, Inter shelled out $15 million to sign former Atletico Madrid striker German Berterame from CF Monterrey in January, further increasing an already intimidating firepower.\n\nIf there’s a side capable of challenging Inter’s dominance, it’s LAFC.\n\nSon’s arrival from Tottenham Hotspur last summer transformed Marc Dos Santos’ team into one of the deadliest attacking units in North American football, let alone MLS.\n\nThe South Korean megastar has forged a formidable partnership with Denis Bouanga. Together, they accounted for 25 goals and eight assists, emerging as the division’s most prolific duo alongside Messi and Suarez.\n\nBouanga and Son may no longer have to create chances for themselves alone after LAFC secured the services of Stephen Eustaquio from Porto earlier in February.\n\nIndeed, the skilled midfielder has moved to BMO Stadium on a season-long loan and will try to help the Black and Gold win the crown for the first time since 2022.\n\nElsewhere, Vancouver Whitecaps are bidding to replicate Toronto FC’s remarkable 2017 success and become the second Canadian franchise to lift the trophy.\n\nThough in the autumn of his illustrious playing career, Muller proved to be a game-changer for Jesper Sorensen’s side in the second half of last season, adding elite creativity and finishing touch to this exciting roster.\n\nMuller took MLS by storm upon arrival last summer, netting seven goals and adding three assists in seven appearances during the regular season to help his side reach the play-offs.\n\nDespite a 3-1 defeat to Inter in the grand final, the Whitecaps demonstrated they can compete with the league’s elite and will look to turn that painful lesson into fuel for a genuine title push in 2026.\n\nMessi has elevated MLS to another level since leaving Paris Saint-Germain to join Inter in 2023, and the 38-year-old icon looks set to remain the focal point of attention throughout the upcoming campaign.\n\nUnparalleled in his influence and output, La Pulga continues to set the standard across the league, and there’s no doubt that he will be the cornerstone of Inter’s title defence.\n\nWhile many players would settle for leaving in the shadow of Son, Bouanga has often found a way to outshine his more esteemed teammate, emerging as one of the league’s fiercest strikers.\n\nBouanga was unstoppable last season, tallying 26 goals and nine assists in 34 league games, and he will be the one to keep an eye on this year despite Son’s presence.\n\nIt’s a World Cup year, and a player who made his mark on football’s biggest international stage over a decade ago is perfectly poised to make his American soccer debut.\n\nJames Rodriguez is the man in question. The 36-year-old has joined Minnesota United following a lacklustre spell at Leon and will look to roll back the years after rising to global superstardom at the 2014 World Cup.\n\nA landmark change this year sees every MLS match available at no extra charge to Apple TV subscribers in over 100 countries — the standalone MLS Season Pass has been discontinued in favour of inclusion within the base streaming service, with no blackouts for viewers.\n\nOpening weekend highlights include a marquee Walmart Saturday Showdown clash between LAFC and Inter Miami at the iconic LA Memorial Coliseum, with traditional Sunday Night Soccer continuing the primetime slate.\n\nApple’s expanded coverage also introduces enhanced broadcasts and features like dynamic “Shot on iPhone” angles, aiming to deepen engagement across the regular season, Leagues Cup, All-Star Game, and Audi MLS Cup Playoffs, making 2026 a watershed year for global accessibility of MLS.\n\nFor more live streaming information, see our football live streaming page.",

    "fullText": "Clubs across the world are growing frustrated with FIFA over delays in distributing £185 million in promised solidarity payments from last summer’s Club World Cup, per The Guardian.\n\nFIFA had pledged that clubs that did not take part in the expanded tournament would still receive a share of the revenue, ensuring the benefits filtered down beyond the elite.\n\nHowever, more than seven months after the competition concluded, there is still no confirmed timeline for when the money will arrive or clarity on how it will be divided.\n\nThe total solidarity pot stands at £185m. If shared equally, it would equate to roughly £50,000 per top-flight club worldwide.\n\nWhile that figure may seem modest compared to the £740m in prize money distributed, with winners Chelsea earning around £84m, for many smaller clubs it could prove transformative.\n\nIn leagues where television deals are shrinking or even non-existent, a five-figure payment can be the difference between balancing the books and serious financial strain.\n\nExecutives from smaller European leagues say they have repeatedly sought answers from FIFA but have received no clear clarification on when funds will be released.\n\nThere is no suggestion that FIFA will not pay the money. Instead, the delay appears to stem from ongoing discussions over how to split the £185m between the six continental confederations.\n\nRepresentation at the Club World Cup varied, complicating attempts to create a fair formula. Also, several confederations lack established systems for distributing such funds.\n\nIn Europe, UEFA is expected to use a model similar to its existing solidarity payments for clubs that miss out on the group stages of European competition.\n\nBut until final figures are agreed, no distribution can begin.\n\nThe tournament’s last-minute funding arrangements have not helped.\n\nA £787m broadcast deal with DAZN was only finalised months before kick-off, leaving little time to establish a detailed pay-out structure.\n\nFor football’s smaller clubs, the wait continues and patience is wearing thin.",

    "fullText": "Real estate and crypto entrepreneur Eric Trump said on Thursday that the crypto world is going to be the future of mainstream finance despite the rout of recent months.\n\nDuring a wide-ranging interview with Yahoo Finance, Trump weighed in on bitcoin, crypto legislation, his personal debanking experience, and the latest digital asset project between the Trump Organization and his flagship crypto venture, World Liberty Financial.\n\nWhat is World Liberty Financial's tokenization project about?\n\nWhat's causing delays in crypto legislation like Clarity Act?\n\nHow has the Trump family's crypto empire evolved?\n\nWhy is Eric Trump suing major banks?\n\n\"First of all, markets aren't always rational,\" Trump said while speaking from Palm Beach, Fla., pointing to bitcoin's performance over the past 10 years, when it was below $500 per coin.\n\nBitcoin (BTC-USD) fell Thursday below $67,000, putting it on pace for its fifth straight week of decline. Its price has nearly halved since reaching an all-time high last October and is down 31% over the past year.\n\n\"If you don't have the backbone, the wherewithal to weather volatility, go invest in some boring bond that's going to yield you 4.5% and call it a day,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump's comments came on the heels of World Liberty Financial pushing into a less volatile side of the crypto world: tokenization.\n\nIn partnership with crypto firm Securitize and a London stock exchange-listed subsidiary of major Saudi Arabian real estate developer DarGlobal, World Liberty is putting real estate assets linked to a Trump resort project in the Maldives, set for completion in 2030, on the blockchain.\n\nThe effort involves packaging revenue interests from loans tied to the real estate project so they can be sold as crypto securities to wealthy investors via crypto exchanges. Tokenization is the process of creating a crypto-world representation of an asset so that its likeness can be traded on crypto rails.\n\nThe tokenized real estate market stands at roughly $359 million, according to crypto data platform RWA.\n\nTokenization is \"going to change the way money flows around the world,\" Trump said, adding that he expects more of everything from debt and commodities to Hollywood film rights, fine art, and potentially even ownership in five-star restaurants to eventually go on blockchains.\n\n\"We're very excited to be on the forefront of that with real estate,\" he added.\n\nThe Trump family's crypto ventures have ballooned since Donald Trump embraced the crypto world while campaigning in 2024. His household's tied digital asset empire now sprawls into most corners of the crypto space.\n\nBut World Liberty has by far caught the most attention. In March 2025, the company launched USD1 (USD136148-USD), a US dollar-pegged stablecoin that is now the world's fifth largest after swelling to $5 billion in total market value.",

    "fullText": "Happy Thursday, Dodgers fans. Cactus League play is just around the corner for the Boys in Blue.\n\nAs we await the joy of getting to see World Series MVP Yoshinobu Yamamoto return to the mound on Saturday, here are some of the top headlines from around Major League Baseball.\n\nThe reigning back-to-back National League manager of the year was rewarded by the team on Thursday.\n\nThe Milwaukee Brewers gave Pat Murphy a three-year extension, ESPN reports.\n\nIn addition to the three years — 2026 through 2028 — the deal also includes a club option for 2029, Ken Rosenthal of The Athletic reports.\n\nThe trial of Cleveland Guardians pitchers Emmanuel Clase and Luis Ortiz, who are accused of tipping pitches to bettors in exchange for kickbacks, is likely to move to the fall, Zack Meisel of The Athletic reports.\n\nBoth have pleaded not guilty and are free on bail, though they are on the MLB’s restricted list.\n\nThey were scheduled to have their trial begin in May, though Judge Kiyo A. Matsumoto “suggested she’ll ultimately shift the date to the fall,” Meisel wrote.\n\nThose involved were ordered to submit their preferred new trial date by Monday.\n\nIf October is indeed the new trial date, it will be interesting to see if the legal proceedings overlap with the World Series.\n\nInfielder Jazz Chisholm Jr. has made public his intentions to join Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani in an exclusive club that was empty until last season and now only includes the Japanese two-way player.\n\nChisholm told Chris Kirschner of The Athletic that he wants to hit 50 home runs and steal 50 bases in a season, which was done for the first time in history by Ohtani just last year.\n\n“Reminded that 50-50 has been accomplished just once in MLB history, he shrugged,” Kirschner wrote. “’You’re looking at the second one,’ Chisholm said.”\n\nThe quest may seem nearly impossible, but Yankees teammate Aaron Judge expressed confidence to Kirschner.\n\n“He really can accomplish anything,” Judge said.",

    "fullText": "World Liberty Financial, the crypto firm cofounded and partly run by the Trump family, will tokenize loan revenue interest from a new Trump International Hotel and Resort in the Maldives.\n\nTokenization is the process of putting an asset on the blockchain to turn it into a crypto token that can be easily traded, in this case, a loan used to fund the construction of a hotel. Investors who buy tokenized pieces of the loan will be entitled to a portion of the interest payments made on it.\n\nAccording to WLF documents, DT Marks DEFI LLC, which is owned by the Trump family, reserves the right to receive 75% of the revenue generated from $WFLI token sales after expenses.\n\nThe offering won't be available to everyone. Only accredited investors, or those with at least $1 million in liquid assets and who make enough money per year, will be given access to the tokenized loan. The tokens will be offered in partnership with Securitize, Inc. and Dar Global PLC.\n\nThe Trump hotel in the Maldives is set to open in 2030 and was announced in late 2025.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is listed as \"Cofounder Emeritus\" of World Liberty Financial on its website. His three sons — Don Jr., Eric, and Baron — are listed as cofounders, as is Steve Witkoff, who is currently serving as United States special envoy to the Middle East.\n\nWorld Liberty Financial's new tokenization offering is the Trump family's latest move in the crypto space. In January 2025, Trump launched $Trump coin, a meme token that spiked to $45 shortly after launch, and currently trades at $3.40. According to Reuters, the coin made almost $100 million in fees in the first couple weeks after its launch.\n\nWLF also sold a 49% stake in January 2025 to an Emirati royal for $500 million, the Wall Street Journal reported. The firm launched a stablecoin, USD1, last March.\n\nIn addition, Trump Media and Technology Group adopted a crypto treasury strategy last year, buying billions of dollars in bitcoin. According to a Bloomberg report, crypto had boosted the Trump family's net worth by $1.4 billion as of January 2026.\n\nThe token offering from WLF comes as crypto assets endure a brutal bear market as funds flee the space. Bitcoin's price is down 45% from October's high, while ethereum has fallen 59% since August.",

    "fullText": "Jakub Mensik prevented Jannik Sinner from reaching another final as he knocked the world number two out of the Qatar Open quarter-finals.\n\nThe sixth seed from the Czech Republic edged the first set and, although Sinner levelled, 20-year-old Mensik took the decider to win 7-6 (7-3) 2-6 6-3.\n\nThat ended a run of 22 wins from 23 matches for Sinner, with his only defeat coming against Novak Djokovic in the Australian Open semi-finals last month.\n\nThe 24-year-old Italian reached 10 finals in 2025, winning the Australian Open and Wimbledon titles, but was upset by world number 16 Mensik in Thursday's first meeting in Doha.\n\nHe will now face unseeded Frenchman Arthur Fils, who beat Mensik's compatriot Jiri Lehecka 6-3 6-3, for the chance to play in a fourth ATP final and his second in 2026, having won last month's Auckland Open for a second career title.\n\nWorld number one Carlos Alcaraz will meet defending champion Andrey Rublev in the other semi-final after both won their last-eight ties.\n\nTop seed Alcaraz came from behind to beat Karen Khachanov 6-7 (3-7) 6-4 6-3 and stretch his winning start to the year to 10 matches, having won the Australian Open to become the youngest man to complete a career Grand Slam.\n\nNext up for the 22-year-old Spaniard is Rublev, with the Russian fifth seed having beaten Greece's Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-3 7-6 (7-2).\n\nBritish pair Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool also have a chance to retain their crown, with one of their seven doubles titles from 2025 coming at the Qatar Open.\n\nThey beat compatriots Joe Salisbury and Neal Skupski to win last year's title in Doha and there will be three Britons in the 2026 final.\n\nTop seeds Cash and Glasspool booked their return after beating the French pair of Quentin Halys and Pierre-Hugues Herbert 6-2 6-3 in the semi-finals.\n\nThey will now face the third seeds, compatriot Henry Patten and Finland's Harri Heliovaara, who claimed a 7-5 6-4 win over Italy's Simone Bolelli and Andrea Vavassori.\n\nSinner and Alcaraz reach Qatar quarter-finals\n\nAfter a string of withdrawals at the Dubai Tennis Championships, four of the top seven seeds have reached the semi-finals.\n\nUkraine's Elina Svitolina recovered from a set down to beat Croatia's Antonia Ruzic, who reached the last eight after qualifying as a lucky loser and upsetting Britain's Emma Raducanu.\n\nThe world number nine won 3-6 6-2 6-3 on Thursday and will face American Coco Gauff for a place in the final in the UAE.\n\nThe third seed needed just 69 minutes to get past Alexandra Eala, claiming a 6-0 6-2 victory over the unseeded Filipino.\n\nJessica Pegula needed three sets to overcome Denmark's Clara Tauson, with the fourth seed coming through 6-3 2-6 6-4.\n\nShe will now face fellow American Amanda Anisimova after the second seed fought back to beat fifth seed and defending champion Mirra Andreeva 2-6 7-5 7-6 (7-4).\n\n'People shouldn't be dying just for existing'\n\nLive scores, results and order of play\n\nGet tennis news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "British freestyle skier Zoe Atkin qualified top for Saturday's halfpipe final as she looks to add the Winter Olympic title to her World Championship crown.\n\nThe 23-year-old, also a two-time X Games champion, put down a best score of 91.50 on her first run.\n\nAtkin is the younger sister of Izzy Atkin, who won Great Britain's first Olympic medal on skis with her slopestyle bronze in 2018.\n\nChina's defending champion Eileen Gu - expected to be the main rival for the gold - qualified in fifth with a score of 86.50, having crashed on her first run.\n\n\"It feels so good,\" Atkin told BBC Sport. \"Obviously, I was pretty nervous coming into today.\n\n\"A big event and qualifying can be more nerve-wracking than finals as you only have two runs to put it down.\n\n\"I'm really happy that I was able to manage those feelings. I'm in a good standing for Saturday and that brings me a lot of confidence, so I am super excited.\"\n\nBorn and raised in the United States to a British father and a Malaysian mother, Atkin has competed for Great Britain her entire career and made an Olympic debut four years ago.\n\nWith her sister and family watching on at Livigno Snow Park, she put in an assured performance to start her Olympic campaign, impressing the judges with the height of her tricks above the 6.7m-high pipe.\n\nCanada's Cassie Sharpe, the 2018 Olympic champion and 2022 silver medallist, qualified third after her first run, but was taken away on a stretcher after a heavy crash on her second.\n\n\"It is nerve-wracking, but it is also nice as you get to see what everyone is doing, so you can strategise a little bit,\" she added.\n\n\"It gives me confidence to know the judges like my skiing, and they're hyped to see what I bring to the finals. I am confident and feeling excited.\n\n\"The pipe is amazing. It is definitely a steep pitch, so it allows for a lot of speed, which is kind of one of my things to go big.\"\n\nHeavy snow fell on Livigno throughout Thursday, causing the men's halfpipe qualifiers to be postponed.\n\nThey will now take place on Friday morning from 09:30 GMT, with Gus Kenworthy and Liam Richards competing for Great Britain.\n\nEileen Gu - the 'snow princess' who divides opinion\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "fullText": "American superstar Alysa Liu added Olympic figure skating gold to her world title as she beat a standout field in the women's final.\n\nLiu came into the free skate in third place following a couple of errors in the short program, but produced a performance for the ages.\n\nAppropriately wearing a sparkly gold dress and performing to Donna Summer, she scored a staggering 150.20 in her free skate.\n\nIt pushed her to the top of the leaderboard with an overall score of 226.79, narrowly beating Japan's Kaori Sakamoto - who Liu beat to the world title last year.\n\nSakamoto, in her final performance before retirement, won silver with 17-year-old compatriot Ami Nakai claiming bronze.\n\nJapan's Mone Chiba finished fourth, ahead of Amber Glenn - who rose from 13th to fifth after an excellent free skate - while Russian champion Adeliia Petrosian came sixth following a fall.\n\nLiu, 20, becomes the first American Olympic champion in women's figure skating since Sarah Hughes in 2002, and the first USA medallist since Sasha Cohen in 2006.\n\nShe was playing catch up on Nakai - leader after the short program - and Sakamoto after Tuesday night following a mistake on her triple lutz where she failed to fully rotate in the element.\n\nBut there were no mistakes here with a truly showstopping routine that drew deafening cheers from the crowd.\n\nIt was a much needed boost for the USA, as their only gold in singles figure skating following Ilia Malinin's collapse in the men's event.\n\nMalinin was among those in the crowd who gave Liu - the alt girl with her iconic halo hair and lip piercing - a standing ovation as she wrote herself into Olympic folklore.\n\nIt completes a remarkable comeback for Liu, who previously quit the sport aged 16 after missing out on a medal at Beijing 2022.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nSakamoto meanwhile has to settle for silver as her stellar career ends without an Olympic crown.\n\nShe is retiring aged 25 having won three world titles and bronze at Beijing 2022.\n\nHer final performance here was to Non, je ne regrette rien by Edith Piaf, and Sakamoto must have no regrets about a performance in which all 12 elements were given positive grades of execution.\n\nBut it scored five points lower than Liu in the technical elements, with the American's routine judged to have been more challenging.\n\nSakamoto wept as she left the ice, but by the medal ceremony rightly looked delighted with another major honour.\n\nThat initial disappointment was in stark contrast to the joy of compatriot Nakai, who ends a phenomenal debut campaign with an Olympic medal.\n\nThe youngest skater in the competition, Nakai stormed to the top of the leaderboard following the short program and opened her free skate with a triple axel - a brutally tough element she is now making her trademark.\n\nBut Nakai stumbled on her triple lutz, which played a major role in knocking her down below Liu and Sakamoto.\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.\n\nFor a while, it looked like American champion Glenn might have produced an all-time great Olympic comeback.\n\nShe was down in 13th following a disastrous short program which left her in tears after she missed her triple loop, meaning it was scored zero as an invalid element.\n\nGlenn - who is open about her bisexuality and criticism of USA president Donald Trump - has been a magnet for online backlash, and came out on Thursday in Milan with a point to prove.\n\nDespite suffering a heavy fall in the warm-up she attacked her free skate, including a triple axel to start then a complex triple loop and double axel sequence.\n\nShe punched the air at the conclusion, and even as she missed out on a medal she had the body language of someone pleased to have brought her best to the Olympic stage.\n\nThe same could not be said for Petrosian, who was aiming to be the second Individual Neutral Athlete (AIN) of the day to win a medal at Milan-Cortina 2026.\n\nThe teenager is under the tutelage of controversial Eteri Tutberidze - the coach of Kamila Valieva at the last Olympics - who was rinkside during Petrosian's pre-skate.\n\nBut the 18-year-old's medal hopes were all but dashed on her first routine as she attempted a quad toe loop but fell.\n\nIf she had nailed her complex routine, gold was likely. But instead Petrosian was left stony faced, and she exited the stage quickly when it was confirmed she had missed the podium.",

    "description": "Eileen Gu is the most decorated female Olympic freestyle skier in history, and a global superstar, but continues to divide opinion.",
    "fullText": "Wherever Eileen Gu goes, her fans will follow. Headlines will too.\n\nWith five medals - and the opportunity for one more on Saturday - she is the most decorated female Olympic freestyle skier in history.\n\nBut she is also someone who transcends her sport, a 22-year-old global superstar with a bank balance to make your eyes water.\n\nChina fell in love with its 'snow princess' at the Beijing 2022 Olympics where, as the poster girl of the Games, she duly delivered.\n\nShe became freestyle skiing's youngest Olympic champion with her big air and halfpipe golds at the age of 18, and the first to win three medals at the same Games when she added slopestyle silver.\n\nLater that year, she was named one of Time magazine's 100 most influential people in the world.\n\n\"I just like being the best. I've always wanted to do that,\" said Gu at the Milan-Cortina Olympics, where she has added two more silver medals to her Olympic collection.\n\n\"I wanted to be the best at math when I was in kindergarten, and then I wanted to get into the best high school, and I wanted to have the highest SAT score, and then I wanted to get to the best college, and I wanted to be the best skier I could be.\n\n\"Then I wanted to do every event, and then I wanted to win them all. When you get a taste of it, it's kind of addictive.\"\n\nThe two Chinese-American Olympians competing for rival superpowers\n\nOn and off skis, Gu is a high achiever in every part of her world.\n\nCalifornia-born and raised by an American father and Chinese mother, she attended private school in San Francisco and is currently taking a sabbatical from her studies at Stanford University, where she majors in international relations and previously studied quantum physics.\n\nShe is also fluent in Mandarin, and as a child would spend summers in Beijing.\n\n\"Sometimes it feels like I'm carrying the weight of two countries on my shoulders,\" Gu said earlier in the 2026 Games.\n\nIn 2019, at the age of just 15, she switched her sporting allegiance from the US to China, wanting to \"inspire millions of young people in Beijing - my mother's birthplace\" before the 2022 Olympics.\n\nWhatever her reasoning, it was a decision that proved lucrative.\n\nIn December, Forbes ranked Gu as the fourth-highest paid female athlete for 2025, behind only tennis players Coco Gauff, Aryna Sabalenka and Iga Swiatek.\n\nBut unlike those three, only a tiny amount of her $23.1m (£17.1m) income last year came from prize money from her sport - around $100,000 (£74,000).\n\nInstead, it comes through endorsements with brands such as Red Bull, Porsche and Tiffany & Co, while she has walked the runway for Louis Vuitton and Victoria's Secret and is signed by modelling agency IMG.\n\nIt also emerged in 2025, as reported in the Wall Street Journal, external, that Gu and another athlete were set to be paid a combined $6.6m (£4.9m) by the Beijing Municipal Sports Bureau.\n\nIn total, the two athletes were said to be paid nearly $14m (£10.4m) over the past three years by the Bureau.\n\nBut her decision to compete for China was also one that drew much criticism, not just because of China and the US' rivalry as the world's two biggest economies, but because of China's authoritarian Communist Party rulers and its poor record on human rights - which it denies.\n\nWhile the initial furore died down, it has raised its head again at these Games.\n\nAt the start of the Olympics, American freestyle skier Hunter Hess spoke out about the actions of the United States' Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) organisation and ongoing tensions in the US.\n\nIn January, intensive care nurse Alex Pretti, 37, and fellow Minnesota resident Renee Good, 37, were both killed by ICE agents in the city, sparking widespread protests.\n\nAsked what it means to represent the USA, Hess said: \"It's a little hard.\n\n\"Just because I'm wearing the flag doesn't mean I represent everything that's going on in the US.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump responded to Hess' comment by calling him a \"real loser\", and Gu was one of several athletes who publicly defended Hess and others speaking out.\n\n\"As someone who's been caught in the crossfire before, I feel sorry for the athletes,\" she said.\n\nBut that enraged her critics, given Gu chose to speak out against Trump but has never criticised China.\n\nFormer NBA player Enes Kanter Freedom called her a \"traitor\", adding she \"was born in America, raised in America, lives in America and chose to compete against her own country for the worst human rights abuser on the planet - China\".\n\n\"You don't get to enjoy the freedoms of US citizenship while acting as a global PR asset for the Chinese Communist Party,\" he wrote on X.\n\nWhen asked about China's human rights record by Time magazine, external, in an interview published in January, she answered: \"I'm not an expert on this.\n\n\"I haven't done the research. I don't think it's my business.\"\n\nGu has 2.6m followers on Instagram, has amassed 11.7m likes on TikTok, and at the Livigno Snow Park high up in the Italian Alps, no athlete has more fans in attendance.\n\nClad in the red colours of China, they line the front of the fan areas, flags adorned with images of Gu's face pegged to the fences, and celebrate her every run like it has clinched Olympic gold.\n\nAfter every run, the ever-driven and disciplined Gu seeks out her mother, Yan, to review video footage on her phone. Yan, reportedly a successful venture capitalist who brought her daughter up single-handledly, is accredited at the Games and is the first person Gu celebrates her successes with.\n\nDuring Monday's big air final, Yan was seen watching alongside former International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach.\n\nAfter competitions, Gu is the one every media outlet wants to speak to, and she gracefully and politely obliges as she slowly shuffles through the mixed zone.\n\nBut it was from a press conference earlier this week that her remarks to a journalist went viral, when she was asked if she felt her two silver medals were actually two golds lost.\n\n\"I'm the most decorated female freeskier in history. I think that's an answer in and of itself,\" she replied.\n\n\"How do I say this? Winning a medal at the Olympics is a life-changing experience for every athlete. Doing it five times is exponentially harder because every medal is equally hard for me but everybody else's expectations rise, right?\n\n\"So the two medals lost situation, to be quite frank with you, I think is kind of a ridiculous perspective to take.\n\n\"I'm showcasing my best skiing, I'm doing things that quite literally have never been done before so I think that is more than good enough. But thank you.\"\n\nIn the lead-up to the Games, Gu did interviews with the likes of Vogue and Time magazine, but it was reports in the Swiss media, external that had the potential to further fuel a competitive rivalry at the top of the sport.\n\nIt was reported that the coach of Swiss skier Mathilde Gremaud left her team to join Gu's on the eve of the Games, just as he had four years earlier before Beijing 2022.\n\nAt those Games, Gremaud pipped Gu to slopestyle gold, while Gu won the big air title with Gremaud taking bronze.\n\nThis time around, Gremaud again won slopestyle gold, with Gu taking silver, while the Swiss star withdrew from the big air after a crash, with Gu going on to finish second again.\n\nBefore that big air final and as a result of reaching it, Gu had taken to Instagram to highlight a scheduling issue.\n\nIt meant, as the only woman competing in three freeski events, she would miss a full day of halfpipe training. After appealing to the International Ski and Snowboard Federation (FIS) for another opportunity to train, she said she had been turned down.\n\n\"This decision is disappointing to me because it seems to contradict the spirit of the Games,\" she said.\n\n\"Daring to be the only woman to compete in three events should not be penalised. Making finals in one event should not disadvantage me in another.\"\n\nBBC Sport understands Gu had already been handpicked as one of 10 athletes - five men, five women - invited to a halfpipe testing training session, while having three official training sessions is more than the usual two held before World Cups.\n\nIn a statement, FIS told BBC Sport: \"For athletes who choose to compete in multiple disciplines and/or multiple events, conflicts can sometimes be inevitable.\"\n\nSo serious is Gu taking these Olympics that she has brought 21 pairs of skis with her to Livigno, seven per event. Asked by BBC Sport how many she would normally take to a competition, she replied two or three.\n\nIn the halfpipe training she did do she looked in imperious form, and qualified for Saturday's final in fifth place, with Great Britain's Zoe Atkin, also a Stanford student, topping the standings.\n\n\"My sixth Olympic final. I am proud to have a 100% success rate,\" Gu told BBC Sport.\n\n\"It is not an easy thing to do. The Olympics brings out the best and worst in people.\n\n\"Being able to withstand that pressure is something I am really proud of.\"\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

That was really fun, I was really looking forward to this,\" Hodgkinson told the crowd, before being adorned with a golden crown as she took her place on a throne beside the track.\n\nThe 23-year-old, who broke the rarely contested 600m record during her previous indoor season three years ago, joins triple jumper Jonathan Edwards as the only British athlete to hold a current world record in one of the sport's championship events.\n\nHodgkinson was primed to target the indoor 800m record at her eponymous Keely Klassic event in February last year, before her ambitions were ruined by the first of two serious hamstring injuries that season.\n\nSpeaking before Thursday's event, Hodgkinson said that Lievin was not just about the world record \"but seeing how fast we can really go\", after bettering her own national record by almost one second at the UK Indoor Championships on Saturday.\n\nJoined on the start line by Ethiopia's Olympic silver medallist Tsige Duguma and Switzerland's Audrey Werro, who Hodgkinson replaced as the fastest woman this year, Poland's Anna Gryc was tasked with setting a pace of 55.8 seconds through halfway.\n\nAhead of schedule after a 55.56-second first 400m, Hodgkinson strode off the front and never appeared in danger of losing touch with the green wavelights representing the record time on the inside of the track.\n\nAfter the desperate lows of her first year as the reigning Olympic champion, Hodgkinson has come out firing in her second.\n\nThe world record appeared to be on borrowed time after Hodgkinson opened her season with a 1:56.33 clocking in Birmingham five days ago.\n\nShe made no secret of her ambition to surpass Ceplak's mark on a notoriously fast track in Lievin following that statement performance, saying: \"I feel like it is my record to break.\"\n\nIt left Ceplak and Austrian Stephanie Graf, who set her best time in finishing runner-up to Ceplak's world record run in Vienna, as the only athletes ahead of Hodgkinson on the all-time list.\n\nThat mark had remained a controversial one ever since Ceplak, and indeed Graf, later served two-year doping bans.\n\nBut, 12 days short of her birthday, and the latest anniversary of Ceplak's record, Hodgkinson took down the record to which she has long attached a sense of destiny.\n\nHodgkinson became known as 'Keely 2.0' among her M11 training group, such were the developments she made in strength and power during her time spent in the gym recovering from two hamstring tears in 2025.\n\nThose significant setbacks, though challenging both physically and emotionally, did not prevent her from making the world podium in September following a 376-day wait to race as Olympic champion.\n\nWith an uninterrupted winter training block behind her - the \"healthiest\" she says she has had \"in a long time\" - Hodgkinson signalled in devastating fashion that she is ready to make up for lost time.\n\nAfter she won BBC Sport's Personality of the Year following her crowning moment at Paris 2024, Jenny Meadows, co-coach of the M11 training group alongside husband Trevor Painter, said an attempt at the sport's oldest world record would naturally follow once the indoor best was captured.\n\nIt is close to 43 years since Czech athlete Jarmila Kratochvilova set the outright world 800m record by running 1:53.28 in July 1983.\n\nOn this evidence, it may not be long before Hodgkinson, who has world indoor, European and Commonwealth honours to target this year, writes further history.\n\n\"She's absolutely obliterated that world record... What better way to head on to the world indoors,\" British former 400m athlete Allison Curbishley said on BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\n\"A world indoor medal has eluded Keely in the last five years, so it's something she's desperate to get in Poland in a few weeks' time.\"\n\nRenee adds to Regis legacy with first UK title\n\nHodgkinson eyes world record after breaking British mark",

    "fullText": "NASA’s new boss blasted Boeing and the space agency Thursday for Starliner’s botched flight that left two astronauts stuck for months at the International Space Station.\n\nAdministrator Jared Isaacman said poor leadership and decision-making at Boeing led to Starliner’s troubles. He also blamed NASA managers for failing to intervene and get Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams back more quickly.\n\nThe two test pilots, now retired from NASA, spent more than nine months at the station before catching a lift back with SpaceX last March.\n\nIsaacman said Starliner’s problems must be better understood and fixed before any more astronauts strap in.\n\nIn a sweeping and emphatic move, Isaacman upgraded the seriousness of Starliner's troubled astronaut debut, declaring it a “Type A mishap,” something that could endanger a crew. Both the Challenger and Columbia space shuttle disasters also involved cultural and leadership missteps. It is a mistake that Starliner was not designated a serious mishap right from the start, Isaacman said, citing internal pressure to keep Boeing on board and flights on track.\n\n“This is just about doing the right thing,” he said. “This is about getting the record straight.”\n\nThruster failures and other problems almost prevented Wilmore and Williams from reaching the space station following liftoff in 2024. The thruster analyses continue by Boeing.\n\n“We almost did have a really terrible day,\" said NASA Associate Administrator Amit Kshatriya, referring to a potential loss of life.\n\nNASA issued its 312-page Starliner report while conducting a second fueling test of its moon rocket at Kennedy Space Center. Hydrogen fuel leaks spoiled the first dress rehearsal earlier this month and stalled astronauts' first flight to the moon since 1972.\n\nBoeing said the findings will help the company move forward in ensuring crew safety, and stressed that the Starliner program would continue. Time is running out as NASA proceeds toward decommissioning the space station in 2030, although Isaacman, a self-financed space traveler, foresees “endless demand” for multiple pathways to orbit once private outposts are booming.\n\nThere is no timeline for when Boeing can launch Starliner on a supply run, essentially another test flight to prove its safety before astronaut flights. The grounding leaves SpaceX as the only U.S. taxi service for astronauts.\n\n“Boeing has made substantial progress on corrective actions for technical challenges we encountered and driven significant cultural changes across the team,” Boeing said in a statement.\n\nEven before the troubled astronaut flight, Boeing was struggling with Starliner issues. The first test flight in 2019, without anyone on board, ended up in the wrong orbit and forced a repeat mission, which had its own difficulties.\n\nNASA hired Boeing and SpaceX in 2014, in the wake of the space shuttles’ retirement, to ferry astronauts to and from the orbiting lab. Their contracts are worth billions. SpaceX just delivered its 13th crew to the space station for NASA since 2020.\n\nKshatriya said the space agency must do better moving forward.\n\n“We have to own our part of this,” he said. As for Wilmore and Williams, “We failed them.\"\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

    "fullText": "In 2020, Microsoft announced a moonshot commitment to become carbon negative by 2030 — accelerating work across our company to advance the partnerships and technologies needed to advance sustainability for our businesses, our customers and the world. A key milestone on this journey was our aim to match 100% of our annual global electricity consumption with renewable energy(1) by 2025. Today, we are pleased to share that Microsoft has achieved this milestone(2). This progress helps drive investment into the power systems where we operate, expand clean energy supply and advance broader energy innovation.\n\nWhat began in 2013 with a single 110 megawatt (MW) power purchase agreement (PPA) in Texas — a small first step to demonstrate how corporate procurement could scale clean energy(3) — has evolved into one of the largest clean energy portfolios in the world. This first deal not only supported Microsoft’s early cloud services but also set in motion a decade of commercial partnerships and learning-by-doing that served to demonstrate how corporate demand for advanced energy solutions can help to achieve a more affordable and sustainable power system, while supporting reliability for customers.\n\nSince our carbon negative announcement in 2020, we have contracted 40 gigawatts (GW) of new renewable energy supply across 26 countries, working with more than 95 utilities and developers across 400+ contracts and counting. To put that amount in perspective — that’s enough energy to power about 10 million US homes. Of that contracted volume, 19 GW are now online, delivering new clean energy supply to the power grid, while the remainder are slated to come online over the next five years.\n\nOur new renewable energy procurement continues to deliver significant environmental benefits, including the reduction of Microsoft’s reported Scope 2 carbon dioxide emissions by an estimated 25 million tons(4) and the mobilization of billions of dollars’ worth of private investment in regions where we operate.\n\nMicrosoft is among the early pioneers in developing technical and commercial practices that help advance bankable, repeatable and scalable procurement tools suitable for each market. Our clean energy purchasing navigates a global patchwork of power market designs, requiring creativity in how we balance cost, time to market and project sizing in our portfolio across planning, contracting and management.\n\nOur work has benefited from a broad coalition of partners helping to build this market together. According to Bloomberg New Energy Finance, more than 200 global corporations collectively purchased nearly 200 GW of clean energy around the world since 2008. Working alongside other clean energy buyers — as well as hundreds of utilities, manufacturers, financiers, developers and engineers — we have helped reduce transaction costs, expand developer access to financing and streamline procurement approaches that other buyers can adopt.\n\nThis global flywheel of partnership, investment, technology and policy innovation is expected to continue to facilitate billions of dollars’ worth of investment into infrastructure and jobs. And as we’ve seen repeatedly, when Microsoft sends a clear market signal for world-class, first-of-a-kind technologies and infrastructure, the power sector rises to the challenge. Our procurement over the past decade has demonstrated that partnerships, communities and innovation are essential ingredients that help to accelerate first-of-a-kind technologies and infrastructure at scale.\n\nCritical to Microsoft’s success in expanding digital infrastructure and supporting our local communities is our ability to build trusted partnerships with the over 95 global energy suppliers that support our clean energy portfolio. We have sourced clean energy through multiple requests for proposal or information, bilateral engagements and clean tariffs to evaluate over 5,000 unique carbon-free energy projects around the world.\n\nToday, Microsoft has six energy company partners with which we have over 1 GW of contracted renewable energy capacity, and more than 20 energy supplier partners where each partner has at least five separate renewable energy projects with Microsoft — evidence of the durable, repeatable relationships necessary to scale clean energy. Combining scale with speed, Microsoft’s landmark 10.5 GW framework agreement with Brookfield sends a long-term, 2030 demand signal to the market that enables developers to raise funding more efficiently, bolster supply chains, hire engineers and construct world-class energy infrastructure.\n\nOur renewable energy procurement has mobilized billions of dollars in private investment, supported thousands of jobs across the communities where we operate and delivered meaningful co-benefits. Through partnerships with developers and nonprofit organizations, we’ve worked to embed community-driven benefits into our energy portfolio. These benefits include robust infrastructure, economic inclusion and support for community-focused organizations.\n\nOur support for communities shows up in projects like our 500 MW PPA with Sol Systems, or our 250 MW PPA with Volt Energy Utility that provided local training and jobs, as well as grants to community nonprofit organizations and habitat restoration. We’ve also signed over 1.5 GW of distributed solar, bringing clean energy directly into hundreds of communities around the world. Landmark agreements like our 500 MW offtake with Pivot Energy, or our 270 MW offtake with PowerTrust are expected to foster employment, energy cost savings and grid resilience in communities across the United States, Mexico and Brazil. More details on the above examples and our approach to community benefits in clean energy agreements can be found in a dedicated Microsoft whitepaper.\n\nMicrosoft’s clean energy procurement continues to play an important role in catalyzing technical, commercial and regulatory innovation. Our commercial efforts have helped lower barriers to entry into new markets and expand access into multi-technology contracts that accelerate decarbonization.\n\nIn Japan, Microsoft signed one of the first corporate PPAs in the country’s restructured power market. Our 25 MW, 20-year agreement with Shizen represents the first single-asset virtual PPA executed in the country, which helped pave the way to over 2GWs of corporate procurement since 2024, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance. Alongside opening new markets, we have structured several multi-technology offtakes in nascent markets for corporate procurement. In India, Microsoft purchased a combined 437 MW solar/wind hybrid offtake from Renew, where our projects will support energy access and rural electrification. In Microsoft’s home state of Washington, our datacenters in Douglas County are supplied by 100% carbon-free energy, as we leverage a creative blend of new wind power and hydropower storage to deliver around-the-clock clean energy.\n\nIn 2025, the International Energy Agency (IEA) described a new “Age of Electricity,” marked by accelerating electricity demand from electric vehicles, air conditioners, data centers and heat pumps. As the world electrifies more of the economy, the demand for affordable, reliable and clean electricity will continue to rise.\n\nOur experience building Microsoft’s clean energy portfolio both reflects and furthers global trends. According to IEA data, since 2000, renewable energy generation has expanded nearly four-fold. In many power markets across the world, clean energy is one of the fast-growing sources of generation, and often the one with the fastest time-to-market. Corporate buyers like Microsoft continue to serve as an important catalyst in driving commercial demand for innovation and infrastructure across the power industry.\n\nAs we continue our journey toward becoming carbon negative by 2030, Microsoft will continue to push for an expansive focus on adding all forms of carbon-free electricity solutions, complementing and adding to our portfolio of renewable energy resources. We recognize that the world’s rising electricity needs require a balanced, all-of-the-above decarbonization strategy to meet global economic growth and environmental goals, and our sustainability goals will continue to support this approach moving forward. Such a strategy requires a broader set of carbon-free energy and grid-enabling technologies, including nuclear energy, next-generation grid infrastructure and carbon capture technology. Just as renewable energy was a relatively small part of global energy grids in 2013 when we signed our first PPA, today many advanced energy technologies remain early in their development but offer significant promise to accelerate progress towards an affordable, reliable and sustainable energy future.\n\nMicrosoft has already taken early steps to support the advancement of a broader set of carbon-free energy technologies as we partner with Helion and Constellation Energy on a 50 MW fusion project in Washington state and work with Constellation to restart the 835 MW Crane Clean Energy Center in Pennsylvania. Microsoft’s Climate Innovation Fund has allocated $806 million of capital to 67 investees, with 38% directed toward Energy Systems — advancing carbon-free power and fuels, energy storage and energy management solutions.\n\nWe welcome continued collaboration with our power sector partners to bring these innovations to market and incorporate new technology tools in the process to accelerate their development.\n\nWe will continue to build and leverage new AI-driven tools to design, permit and deploy new power technologies that help expand and more efficiently operate the electricity grid, bringing more clean energy online faster. This work is exemplified by our recently announced collaborations with Idaho National Laboratory and the Midcontinental System Operator, among other examples.\n\nAnd as we advance innovative energy technologies, we recognize that standards must evolve alongside innovation. That is why we will continue participating in industry forums that strengthen carbon accounting frameworks — so that our clean energy procurement is measured with greater accuracy and delivers real world emissions reductions, with a continued focus on maintaining the high level of integrity that the world has come to expect from Microsoft.\n\nOur carbon negative commitment remains a call to action — for Microsoft, our customers and the broader technology sector — to invest in an affordable, reliable and sustainable power system. As we look toward 2030, that call to action has never been clearer.\n\nToday’s milestone represents a shared achievement among the utility professionals, clean energy developers, community leaders, technology innovators and forward-thinking policymakers who continue the deployment of renewable energy. Meeting today’s milestone shows what partnership can deliver in bringing big ideas to life. The future of carbon-free energy is one that we will create – together.\n\nAs Microsoft’s Chief Sustainability Officer, Melanie Nakagawa leads the company’s targets to be carbon negative, water positive, and zero waste by 2030. She brings deep experience at the intersection of policy, business, and technology to advance climate and sustainability solutions globally.\n\nAs President of Cloud Operations + Innovation at Microsoft, Noelle Walsh leads the organization that powers the global Microsoft Cloud. She oversees the company’s physical cloud infrastructure and operations, with a charter focused on safety, security, availability, sustainability, and competitive infrastructure growth—bringing decades of global operational leadership.",

    "description": "Janice Min, editor of The Ankler, offers an un-sunny assessment of the world's entertainment capital: \"There is definitely a Detroit vibe underway.\"",
    "fullText": "The streaming boom that fueled a ton of production in the last decade-plus is gone, and lots of the remaining work is going overseas. No one really knows how AI will affect the movie and TV business, but there's lots of fear it won't be good. And barring something truly surprising, Warner Bros., one of Hollywood's most important movie and TV studios, is going to get swallowed up in the next year or so, which will mean even more consolidation.\n\nBut don't take it from me: Ask Janice Min, who has spent a couple decades enmeshed in Hollywood. First as the editor of the Hollywood Reporter, and now as CEO of The Ankler, an industry trade built for the Substack Age.\n\nThat means she's not a disinterested observer at all: If the center of the movie and TV industry is shrinking, that's bad news for the advertising, subscriptions, and events businesses she's trying to build.\n\nI talked to Min about all of that on my Channels podcast, and you can listen to the whole thing here. The following is an edited excerpt of our conversation.\n\nPeter Kafka: If you had to bet right now, who wins the newly reopened bidding war for Warner Bros. Discovery?\n\nJanice Min: Doesn't it really depend if Netflix decides they're going to step it up? So far, it seems like they will. But Netflix is a pretty ruthless company: Season two isn't working out, it's not driving as many subscribers as season one, your show is canceled. Or cofounder Reed Hastings' famous \"keeper test\": You aren't performing well. You're out.\n\nAnd shareholders are not loving this pursuit of Warner Bros. At some point, they will cut it off. They're a very pragmatic company.\n\nThe conventional wisdom is that Netflix would really like this deal, and that Paramount has to have this deal. Do you agree?\n\nI do. If you're David Ellison and you've assembled probably the most expensive leadership team in history, you are prepping to have Warner Bros. David Ellison was not prepping to have the seventh-biggest studio or the seventh-biggest streamer.\n\nIn the end, if he doesn't have that, you're kind of left holding the bag that nobody wanted. How do you win?\n\nYou are holding the thing that Shari Redstone was desperately trying to get rid of.\n\nThat's important context. This battle is so interesting to me because Warner Bros. is such a stinker, with so much debt, that they are being forced to sell. They had no other outcome. Paramount was such a stinker that Shari Redstone couldn't get the stink off of her fast enough. And there was basically, in the end, one bidder [for Paramount].\n\nThat one bidder is now one of two bidders for the other thing. We get caught up in the excitement that these are huge prizes, but they're just these debt-stuffed, slow-moving beasts that need to have someone who has an emotional attachment to them for them to make sense as a buyer.\n\nAfter Netflix won the first bidding round in December, there was an immediate negative reaction from Hollywood. What's the current vibe when it comes to Netflix vs. Paramount as WBD's future owner?\n\nI think for most people it's Sophie's Choice. There are two potential bad outcomes here.\n\nOn the plus side for David Ellison: People love that he loves movies.\n\n\"I love movies. You guys make movies. I'm gonna make more movies. You should work with me.\"\n\nIt's not a sophisticated business argument, but everyone here has dollar signs spinning in their eyes, everyone's looking for the next deal for themselves. So they like that. Perhaps David Ellison will pay and maybe even overpay for what you are making. And it's exciting that it'll create a big buyer in the market.\n\nThe flip side of that is, Hollywood is not a particularly pro-Trump industry. I don't think they like a lot of the things they are seeing happening at Paramount right now, like the situation that happened with Stephen Colbert and James Talarico. They certainly don't like what's happening with CBS News.\n\nFundamentally, though, it does come down to your bottom line. The industry is struggling. People are having a hard time having the careers they had 10 years ago. So people like the idea of a buyer with deep pockets, even if it's daddy's money.\n\nThere is a steady stream of stories and social media posts about how AI is going to disrupt Hollywood. How much of that concern do you see reflected in day-to-day conversations?\n\nThe thing with AI right now in Hollywood: Everyone's lying just a little bit. Studios are lying about how much they're using it.\n\nCompanies are lying about the capability of their products. And for creative people, they're lying about the fact that they're not using it. I dare you to find a screenwriter who is staring at a blank page and not talking to Claude or ChatGPT at the same time.\n\nIt seems clear that it's going to be a big deal for people working in visual effects, and that was already a challenged industry.\n\nI have a friend who's been sending me LinkedIn posts that are showing up in his feed, and it is so grim. It's people largely who have worked in VFX, and they are posting this full-on bleed out, like \"I will be homeless by next Thursday if I don't have work.\"\n\nIt doesn't appear they're being hyperbolic.\n\nI guarantee that every single studio, every single streamer, they are all completely doing this. During last year's Oscar race, [there was a controversy about] \"The Brutalist,\" and how Adrian Brody's voice was made more Hungarian-accented through technology.\n\nThis year, it is crickets. Even the Academy, the most precious, legacy-protecting institution in Hollywood, has not come out in a really firm way about AI. They basically have a don't ask, don't tell policy. I would say with some certainty that every single best picture nominee this year has used AI in its production process.\n\nWhat's the story people outside Hollywood are missing about your industry right now?\n\nYou look at LA and you think it's sunny and amazing and people are happy. People are having a hard time here. The unemployment rate of Los Angeles is much higher than the national average.\n\nYou're seeing a city that is so big and sprawling, with a kind of rudderless feeling: Who's going to stop this? There is definitely a Detroit vibe underway if things don't course correct.\n\nAnd you're seeing a paralysis: Hollywood used to be a place that had a lot of protests, spoke out, was always fighting the so-called man. And it is pretty much crickets now, because everyone is scared.\n\nI was struck by the fact when you saw the Grammys, you have these musicians getting up on stage, — Billie Eilish, Bad Bunny — and really sticking it to the president and ICE. And you compare that with the Golden Globes, where it was sponsored by Polymarket, and no one's saying anything.\n\nWhen you think about how to capture young people, who are the pipeline for everything — they love this culture of rebellion and revolt and speaking out. I worry about Hollywood containing itself so much to the point that it stops speaking to the audience.",

To understand what makes the difference, Egon Zehnder consultants surveyed of more than 500 senior revenue-driving leaders around the world. A closer look at the 29% of companies surveyed that were seeing rapid growth–defined as a top-line increase of more than 10%—uncovered that leadership makes the difference. Across industries, geographies, and ownership structure, they found that growth accelerates when leaders are aligned, empowered, and equipped to collaborate across functions.",

    "fullText": "Leigh Wood says he \"does not want an easy night\" against Josh Warrington when the former featherweight world champions renew their rivalry in Nottingham on Saturday.\n\nThe pair will contest a rematch at the Motorpoint Arena, more than two years after their dramatic first fight ended with a Wood knockout.\n\nDespite plenty of needle and animosity lingering in the build-up, Thursday's news conference was cordial, with both men fully focused.\n\n\"I don't think it's going to be easy. I'm not expecting it to be easy and nor do I want it to be easy,\" said the 37-year-old Wood.\n\n\"I actually feel better when I'm going through it and then I get the victory.\"\n\nHe holds a record of 28 wins and four defeats, with 17 of those victories coming by knockout.\n\nNottingham-born Wood - who has built a reputation in recent years for his heavy hands and consistent threat inside the ring - insisted he was not underestimating Warrington either.\n\nHis victory over the 35-year-old in October 2023 remains one of the most memorable all-British fights of recent years.\n\nWarrington appeared to be edging the action in Sheffield through his work-rate and pressure, before Wood unleashed a powerful right hand in the seventh round to force a stunning stoppage.\n\nLeeds-born Warrington described that as a \"fantastic\" punch but promised to make the necessary adjustments this time to change the outcome.\n\n\"I can't see what Leigh's going to do differently,\" he said.\n\nWarrington, whose record has 32 wins in 37 bouts, with four defeats and a draw, is a two-time IBF featherweight champion, while Wood held the WBA featherweight crown in 2023.\n\nBut much has changed since their first meeting as both men have suffered setbacks against Anthony Cacace. Warrington briefly retired after his loss to the Belfast fighter in September 2024 before deciding to return.\n\n\"I mourned my career a little bit then decided to continue because I felt I had more than enough to do some things in this sport,\" he said.\n\nWith careers hanging in the balance, there is a growing sense defeat could spell the end for either man, and even the winner might also call it a day.\n\nAlso on the undercard in Nottingham will be an exciting women's contest as Derby-born Sandy Ryan challenges Mexico's Karla Ramos Zamora for the vacant WBC world super lightweight title, while Bilal Fawaz meets Ishmael Davis for the British light middleweight crown.\n\nHeavyweight Dave Allen returns to action against Karim Berredjem, former UFC standout Molly McCann continues her transition to professional boxing, and teenage prospects Leo Atang and Tiah Huyton also feature.\n\nBoxing schedule and results 2026\n\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nEver since Luka Doncic joined the Los Angeles Lakers following last year's trade from the Dallas Mavericks, he's become fast friends with Los Angeles' backup center Jaxson Hayes.\n\nSo much so, that the duo discussed playing together for the Slovenian national team.\n\nAccording to NBA insider Brian Windhorst, Hayes is now officially eligible to compete for Slovenia.\n\n“Jaxson Hayes completed the paperwork to become a Slovenian,” Windhorst said. “He can join the Slovenian national team for Luka, which I’d like to say is one of the smartest things Jaxson Hayes has ever done because I think he’s just secretly signed a contract extension.”\n\nAs Windhorst points out, given the friendship between him and Hayes, there's a high probability that the Lakers keep him beyond this season due to that relationship.\n\nNot to mention, for the money he's earning ($3.4 million) Hayes hasn't been a bad addition.\n\nIn 45 games for Los Angeles this season, he's averaging 6.9 points, 3.9 rebounds and one assist. Hayes is also benefitting from the strong passing ability of both Doncic and LeBron James, averaging a career-high 77.2% from the field, as the duo has helped him find easy looks inside the paint.\n\nAs long as Hayes can continue to play the pick-and-roll well with Los Angeles' ball-handlers, he'll have the opportunity to be effective in the Lakers' offense.\n\nThat said, at 7' 0\", Hayes could be a bit better defensively, having never averaged one block or \n\nEither way, it appears Hayes could be a Laker for many seasons to come.\n\nDoncic and Hayes will return to action following the All-Star break Feb. 20 against the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nLonzo Ball calls himself the 'scapegoat' following trade from Cavaliers\n\nSpurs' Mason Plumlee deal foreshadows another move to come\n\nGiannis Antetokounmpo praises Kon Knueppel: 'One of the smartest rookies I’ve ever seen'\n\nCarter Bryant reveals what happened on final dunk attempt\n\nTyrese Maxey: 'I feel a lot less out of place' after second All-Star appearance\n\nKon Knueppel speaks after third-place in three-point contest",

    "description": "Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta are driving a data center boom in Texas, challenging Virginia's dominance as the top market by 2030.",
    "fullText": "The old saying \"Everything is bigger in Texas\" now applies to data centers.\n\nThe Lone Star State is on track to unseat Virginia as the world's largest data center market by 2030, new research from Jones Lang LaSalle shows.\n\nThe shift indicates how drastically the data center development boom has reshaped the US's digital infrastructure map and the landscape as a whole. Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Meta plan to spend more than $600 billion on AI infrastructure expansion in 2026 — a number so dizzyingly high that Wall Street is on high alert for signs of an AI bubble.\n\nMore than half of all data center construction in the US now happens outside the industry's traditional hubs, according to JLL's North America Data Center Report — Year-End 2025. Tennessee, Ohio, Wisconsin, and Texas are now considered the top emerging markets for data centers.\n\nTexas alone has 6.5 gigawatts of data center capacity under construction.\n\nThat amount of power is roughly equivalent to more than three Hoover Dams or over 17,000 Tesla Model 3s when using the US Department of Energy's standard, and it accounts for about one-fifth of the 35 gigawatts of data center capacity the US added to its pipeline.\n\nThat 35 gigawatts is roughly equivalent to the annual electricity consumption of the UK or Italy, and adding it would nearly double the existing data center capacity in the US, according to JLL.\n\nPart of Texas's appeal is its sprawl.\n\nThe state houses some of the most ambitious data center projects in the country. Oracle and OpenAI's flagship Stargate data center is in Abilene, Google is planning a $40 billion expansion in West Texas, and Meta is building a massive new site in El Paso, just to name a few.\n\nTexas also has abundant energy resources, which is good news for data center developers. The AI boom has driven electricity demand to new heights and strained the nation's power grid. In Texas, several data centers — including Stargate — are being built alongside on-site power plants.\n\nNorthern Virginia has been the data center industry's central hub for more than 15 years, going back to the early days of cloud computing. That has changed rapidly as Big Tech spreads out across the country in search of available power, cheap land, and the best tax incentive packages for the coming wave of AI data centers.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "Global markets' pecking order could be shifting.\n\nThat's the fear being voiced by more investors in recent months as doubts swirl around American exceptionalism — the idea that investors can expect better returns on US assets relative to international markets.\n\nThe US's dominance in global markets has been the historical precedent, but talk about America losing its edge has been rising over the past year as investors take stock of risks like higher inflation, more debt, and increasing geopolitical tensions.\n\nMore investors also appear to be turning their attention to other areas around the world, particularly as the US stocks battle continued selling pressure.\n\nHere are two stats that illustrate how the US could already be losing its edge.\n\nThe S&P 500's year-to-date performance is lagging behind the MSCI World Index by the most in at least 30 years, the bank said, citing its historical analysis since 1995.\n\nThe US has already been lagging global markets for the past year, hedge fund manager Rob Citrone noted when speaking to CNBC about his outlook for US markets this week. In the year leading up to last Friday, he said that the gains in dollar-based assets have been the weakest when compared to 19 other markets around the world.\n\n\"The US is 20th out of 20,\" Citrone said, adding that gains in the US market fell around 30% short of the gains in emerging markets in the last year. \"That's a significant difference.\"\n\nInvestors around the world are swapping their holdings of US-based stocks for emerging markets at the fastest pace since 2021, according to Bank of America's survey of global fund managers in February.\n\nOn average, global investors reduced their position in US stocks by around 20 percentage points compared to their position the prior month. US stocks were the category that investors shifted away from the most, while the eurozone and emerging markets were among the top five areas where investors increased their positioning.\n\nTalk about \"Sell America,\" or investors shifting away from US assets, has picked up in recent months as markets eye potential headwinds, like hotter inflation and higher deficits in the US.\n\nFamed fixed-income investor Jeff Gundlach said last month that he was steering clear of the US entirely, and that he believed \"all\" investors should have exposure to non-US stocks in non-dollar currency.\n\nRon Temple, the chief market strategist for Lazard's advisory and asset management business, said in December that 2025 marked the last year of American exceptionalism, as he expected investors to continue shifting away from the US due to concerns about higher inflation and debt levels.\n\nCitrone added that he thinks the US market will continue to underperform the rest of the world, and that he was short US assets while betting on other markets, like Mexico.\n\n\"Most people are going to move some money from the US,\" he told CNBC earlier this week.",

    "description": "Business Insider's investigation into data centers was awarded the George Polk Award for Environmental Reporting.",
    "fullText": "AI's impact is still largely unknown, but what's powering its rise is pretty clear.\n\nData centers are the backbone of artificial intelligence, and they are real-world evidence that businesses are betting big on the tech.\n\nAn AI project can rise and fall without many people noticing. A 50,000-square-foot data center that pops up in your neighborhood is a lot harder to ignore.\n\nIt's not just their sheer size that's tangible. The cost of these data centers, both economically and environmentally, is very real.\n\nThat's why Business Insider embarked on an investigation to better understand these data centers' impact. That work just earned us a very prestigious award.\n\nThe investigation was a full newsroom effort, with multiple reporters, editors, videographers, and designers chipping in. From environmental implications to complex financing to neighborhood drama, we covered the topic from all angles.\n\nWe've also got an incredible video and interactive map worth checking out.\n\nWinning an award doesn't mean our work is done.\n\nBig Tech companies keep ramping up their spending. Amazon and Alphabet recently announced plans to spend $200 billion and $185 billion, respectively, on AI infrastructure this year.\n\nNew states are also vying for data-center business, threatening traditional hubs like Northern Virginia.\n\nFinancing these deals is becoming increasingly complex and exotic, ranging from 100-year bonds to various types of securitization. In short, it's not just tech companies carrying the risk for these massive bets.\n\nYou can even include yourself in that group if you've noticed your utility bill went up recently.\n\nIt's still not entirely clear if these companies' AI efforts will eventually pay off. In the meantime, society is footing the bill.",

    "description": "As a club coach with Arsenal, Juventus and Lyon and an international coach with Australia, Joe Montemurro has experience of pressure from both sides as he talks to BBC Sport.",
    "fullText": "As a club coach with Arsenal, Juventus and Lyon, and an international coach with Australia, Joe Montemurro has experience of pressure from both sides.\n\nThe recent flurry of club managerial sackings in England has highlighted the volatility of elite coaching.\n\n\"You only see from the outside,\" reflects Montemurro.\n\n\"I think clubs now have a lot of short-term processes that they have to achieve instead of having long-term visions and that puts a lots of pressure on coaches from day one - because sometimes, you've got to fix cultures, you've got to fix structures, you've got to fix organisational processes before you can start getting the results.\"\n\nMontemurro suggests time is a precious commodity.\n\n\"The nature of what we do means we don't have time anymore. It's a high-pressure scenario - results aren't just about winning matches.\n\n\"It's fan engagement, it's commercial, it's money, it's economics, it's all the other 'side dishes', if you want to call it that.\"\n\nFrom 2017-2021 Montemurro was head coach of Arsenal Women. In 2021, he managed Juventus' women side, before becoming the first non-French manager at eight-time Women's Champions League winners Lyon in 2024.\n\nAfter winning league titles at all three clubs, Montemurro was appointed the Matildas head coach in June 2025.\n\n\"It's been an interesting transition,\" he tells BBC Sport from Australia. \"You're used to the day-to-day contact with players and staff, the excitement of games coming quickly.\n\n\"In international football there are little gaps between tournaments and windows that give you more time to reflect and work on other areas.\"\n\nMelbourne-born Montemurro's international journey is about to accelerate. The Women's Asian Cup begins on 1 March in his homeland, with the final set to be staged at Stadium Australia in Sydney - the same arena where Australia's men lifted the trophy in 2015 when Ange Postecoglou led the Socceroos to a 2-1 extra-time victory over South Korea.\n\nThe Matildas are chasing a second Asian Cup crown after a penalty shootout final win over North Korea in 2010 - a tournament where a 16-year-old Sam Kerr scored her first two international goals.\n\nHosting the Asian Cup comes at a pivotal moment for women's football in Australia, building on momentum generated by the Fifa Women's World Cup 2023, which the country co-hosted with New Zealand.\n\nFifa president, Gianni Infantino described that tournament as the \"best and greatest and biggest\" in history with a record-breaking near two million tickets, external sold and an average attendance of about 30,000 fans per match.\n\nThere will be an exodus from the Women's Super League (WSL) with 13 of Australia's 26-player squad currently playing in this country, underlining the depth of Australian influence in England's top flight.\n\nMontemurro understands the tension that creates for clubs.\n\n\"The timing is never perfect,\" he adds. \"I've been in that position when you lose players. It's unfortunate. But one thing clubs sometimes forget is that it's an honour for these players to represent their country.\n\n\"These tournaments don't come around often. For the Australian players, it's a home tournament - the opportunity to do well in that is exciting.\"\n\nMontemurro accepts there are \"pros and cons\", particularly as the WSL season reaches decisive months, but believes most clubs \"now plan for such absences\".\n\nJapan have called up 16 players from the WSL for their squad, including Ayaka Yamashita, Aoba Fujino and Yui Hasegawa from WSL leaders Manchester City.\n\nPlayers will travel around 21 February to prepare for the tournament which runs from 1-21 March.\n\nShould Australia reach the final, English-based players will miss two WSL games and an FA Cup fifth-round match.\n\nArsenal trio Caitlin Foord, Steph Catley and Kyra Cooney-Cross are heading to the tournament, and, should Australia progress to the quarter-finals, Chelsea will be without striker Kerr and defender Ellie Carpenter for their League Cup final against Manchester United, which takes place on 15 March at Ashton Gate in Bristol.\n\nMontemurro has also backed Manchester City forward Mary Fowler to return to fitness for the tournament, despite playing only 15 minutes since rupturing an anterior cruciate ligament in April 2025.\n\nThe full list of WSL players in Australia's Asian Cup, external squad:\n\nCharlize Rule (Brighton and Hove Albion)\n\nEmily van Egmond (Leicester City)\n\nAlanna Kennedy (London City Lionesses)\n\nKaitlyn Torpey (Newcastle United)\n\nClaire Hunt (Tottenham Hotspur)\n\nMontemurro is also clear the women's game in Australia must raise its professional standards.\n\nA recent report, external from the Players Football Association in Australia highlighted low average salaries of A$30,000 (£15,500) in the domestic women's league, with around 63% of players working second jobs.\n\n\"There are minimum standards that all professional leagues are ascertaining,\" says Montemurro, 56. \"We need to make sure we adhere to those standards.\n\n\"There's really no excuse from my perspective. There should be the minimum standards of proper 12-month contracts, pay that's relative to a professional contract [and] all the benefits that come with that.\n\n\"But also the environments that clubs adhere to in terms of their minimum standards - the proper medical, the proper technical, tactical analysis, everything that a professional sporting organisation should have.\n\n\"I think the biggest question is to understand what are the minimum standards from a worldwide perspective that we should be achieving in Australia. We must adhere to those.\"\n\nRecent FIFPRO research, external shows the 2026 Women's Asian Cup could generate up to US$82.4m (£61m), potentially making it the tournament's most commercially successful edition. Yet, the current prize pool remains $1.8m (£1.3m) - unchanged from four years ago and just 12% of the men's equivalent.\n\nAsked if that should increase, Montemurro adds: \"Totally. If national organisations are investing substantially in travel, tournaments and preparation, the prize pool should reflect that.\n\n\"If we're serious about these being major tournaments, there needs to be an incentive to take part.\"\n\nThe Women's Asian Cup will stage matches in Perth, Gold Coast and Sydney.\n\nPerth's 60,000-seat stadium will host the opener on 1 March as Australia face the Philippines, while the final will be played in Sydney at the 79,500-seat Stadium Australia on 21 March.\n\nAustralia are among the favourites, alongside two-time winners Japan, but China are the reigning champions after winning their ninth title in 2022.\n\nBen Haines, Ellen White and Jen Beattie are back for another season of the Women's Football Weekly podcast.

    "description": "Jos Buttler's form is a concern but Will Jacks and Sam Curran have shown promise. What to make of England's unconvincing start to the World Cup?",
    "fullText": "England‘s group stage at the T20 World Cup was a mixed bag - some good but overall unconvincing.\n\nSam Curran and Will Jacks have provided reasons to be positive but Jos Buttler‘s tricky start is a concern.\n\nWe have taken a look into the numbers behind his struggles and the other themes of England’s first four matches…\n\nScores of three against both Italy and Scotland mean Buttler made only 53 runs across the group stage – a low return for one of England's key men.\n\nThe 35-year-old has had a quiet winter with no fifties in 15 international innings across all formats, though a 97 not out in the SA20 in January casts doubt on those writing him off entirely.\n\nButtler's dismissals against Italy and Scotland were almost identical.\n\nLooking for his first boundary from his fourth ball, he miscued a length ball in the off-stump channel to mid-off.\n\n\"Maybe he is trying too hard to get a score on the board,\" said Buttler's former England team-mate Dawid Malan.\n\n\"The last two innings he has played, he has tried to hit the ball over mid-on.\n\n\"Knowing him and playing with him, his gameplan is generally to look to the off side first and then pick up leg side, so maybe he's just going back to his basics.\n\n\"I don't think we have to worry.\"\n\nAll three of his dismissals against pace, including nicking off against Nepal seamer Nandan Yadav, have come against balls clocked between 75-82mph.\n\nSince the start of 2024, Buttler has struggled against pace bowlers in that bracket more than any other – with an average of 35.8 and a strike-rate of 129.\n\nPerhaps more concerningly, given the tournament now returns to the turning tracks of Sri Lanka, his average against spin in T20 internationals has dropped to 24.1 since 2024 from 61.8 across the two years prior.\n\nButtler's other dismissal in this tournament came against Roston Chase's off-spin.\n\nEven with making 202-7 against Italy, there remains a feeling England's batting is yet to fully fire at this tournament.\n\nThey posted 184-7 against Nepal, were bowled out for 166 by West Indies and wobbled when chasing 153 in their victory over the Scots.\n\nThe problem has not been batters getting in.\n\nEnglishmen have reached 25 runs 14 times so far – the most of any team in the competition – but only four of those knocks have been converted into fifties. No England player has made a score above 75.\n\nWill Jacks rejected the notion this is due to batters failing to take responsibility.\n\n\"Responsibility in T20 can be misunderstood,\" he said. \"Sometimes the responsibility is to try and hit 30 off the over.\"\n\nMalan believes The Hundred may be having an impact.\n\n\"There's more emphasis on the first 10 overs now, so if you lose wickets in those first 10 overs then it makes it harder towards the end, but you still need to keep going,\" he said.\n\n\"I used to always worry more about the second 10 overs, so it was about setting things up and then being able to get to that 180 or 190-mark, if the score and wicket dictated it.\n\n\"A lot of these players are playing in The Hundred which is less balls, meaning you have to keep going earlier, and it doesn't really teach you to soak up the pressure for an over or two.\"\n\nCaptain Harry Brook has now got out against spin in three innings in a row after beginning the tournament with 53 against Nepal.\n\nThis is a familiar issue for Brook, who averages 47 against pace in T20 internationals since the start of 2024 but only 23.5 against spin.\n\nBrook's struggles are curious, given his stunning 136 not out on a turning pitch in a one-day international in Sri Lanka last month.\n\nThe return to Sri Lanka for the Super 8s may help Brook because in India he is averaging 20.5 in T20s.\n\nCould Harry Brook struggle in that department then?\n\n“It has probably been his weakness but, saying that, when you bat at four, five or six in T20 cricket and you're walking in at the ninth or 10th over, the majority of balls you are going to face are spin,” Malan said.\n\n“If he is out there for eight overs and he is facing six overs of spin, there is a high chance he's going to get out against spin after starting against spin.\n\n“He changed his technique at the beginning of the year to become better at spin.\n\n“He keeps his bat on the floor for longer whereas he used to stay up.”\n\nOne of the positives of this World Cup so far has been Jacks' promising returns as England's finisher.\n\nHis 39 not out from 18 balls in the four-run win over Nepal was crucial – so too his maiden T20 international fifty against Italy from the tricky position of 101-5.\n\nJacks only took on the finishers' role at the start of last summer but is faring well compared to others before him.\n\nJacks' bowling is more of a concern, however.\n\nWith leg-spinner Adil Rashid, plus two left-arm spinners in Liam Dawson and Jacob Bethell, in the squad, Jacks' bowling role is more significant given he turns the ball in the other direction as an off-spinner.\n\nIt is problematic for England that his six overs have cost 83 runs with two wickets in return.\n\nJacks has struggled most when being swept, conceding 31 runs from eight sweep shots in the group stage.\n\nThough his average amount of turn is only down slightly, 3.5 degrees in the pre-tournament series in Sri Lanka compared to 3.3, Jacks is drifting the ball far less - 1 degree compared to 1.7 degrees in Sri Lanka.\n\nSam Curran came through twice when England were under the most pressure during the group stage.\n\nAgainst Nepal, he successfully defended 10 from the last over.\n\nWhen Italy and Grant Stewart were flying in Monday, Curran stopped the runs and then dismissed the right-hander.\n\nCurran, who was out of favour until September last year, has taken on the role of England's death bowler to good effect.\n\nHe has been especially effective with yorkers – going at 5.07 runs per over with a full length at the death, compared to 14.14 with anything shorter.\n\nCurran is often credited with having a canny mix of slower balls but he has largely kept his pace above 80mph in those crucial final stages.\n\nMore significant has been his control of line…",

    "description": "Programme that funds groups building tech to evade oppressive government controls under serious threat",
    "fullText": "Programme that funds groups building tech to evade oppressive government controls under serious threat\n\nFor nearly two decades, the US quietly funded a global effort to keep the internet from splintering into fiefdoms run by authoritarian governments. Now that money is seriously threatened and a large part of it is already gone, putting into jeopardy internet freedoms around the world.\n\nManaged by the US state department and the US Agency for Global Media, the programme – broadly called Internet Freedom – funds small groups all over the world, from Iran to China to the Philippines, who built grassroots technologies to evade internet controls imposed by governments. It has dispensed well over $500m (£370m) in the past decade, according to an analysis by the Guardian, including $94m in 2024.\n\nThen came Doge, Donald Trump’s department of government efficiency, tasked with reducing the size of US government agencies and initiatives. Career employees who staffed Internet Freedom resigned or were sacked in 2025 as part of larger reductions. Many of its programmes were cut permanently; its main granting office issued no money in 2025. The Open Technology Fund (OTF), a nonprofit that works with the government to direct roughly half of this money, won a lawsuit to get some of this funding restored in December; the Trump administration is now appealing against that ruling.\n\nMeanwhile, the Trump administration this January withdrew from the Freedom Online Coalition, a global alliance set up by the US to defend digital rights.\n\nThe cuts risk curtailing technologies that helped Iranians to coordinate during recent anti-government protests, and that allowed videos and images of massacres to reach the outside world. They could have a major impact in other nations too; the efforts of groups in Myanmar to get past the junta’s “digital iron curtain”, and the ability of users in China to avoid surveillance.\n\n“The programme was effectively gutted,” said a former US official. “They didn’t issue any grants this year.”\n\n“I would like to live in a world where a single US programme is not such a linchpin, such a load-bearing programme, but it has been. It’s hard to deny it has been,” said one digital rights expert based in Europe who has worked on a number of projects for Internet Freedom.\n\nTo report this story, the Guardian spoke to 10 people with knowledge of Internet Freedom, including six of its grantees, and reviewed documents related to its operations and budget.\n\nThe US Department of State has been approached for comment. The OTF declined to comment.\n\nThe purpose of the programme was to make it extremely difficult to do what North Korea has accomplished through decades of censorship efforts, and what Iran succeeded in doing this January during a bloody crackdown on anti-government protests: cut an entire population off from the global internet.\n\nThe US aimed to circumvent this by funding groups capable of building and harnessing technologies that evade such restrictions and censorship. These include familiar tools, such as the encrypted messaging service Signal and the Tor browser, which allows users to be anonymous online.\n\nThey also include far more powerful tools. Advanced circumvention technologies can make it possible to get past even extremely powerful censorship regimes – to leap the firewall in China, for example, or to obtain international news in Iran even when mobile phone networks are out, through methods like satellite datacasting, in which data is broadcast in a similar way to television signal.\n\nAnother technology has allowed Iranians to securely communicate during recent anti-government protests, alerting each other to shootings and police presence, even as the rest of the internet has been cut off.\n\nThe soft-power aim behind this was to keep the internet as it is: mostly accessible, mostly a global commons. The groups it funded made censorship costly and difficult. “When you challenge censorship, the long-term effect is that oppressive governments must either open their internet, or to go in the direction of North Korea,” said the former US official.\n\n“But because each of those options is costly for them, they’ll keep trying to censor their networks so as to have the economic benefits of the internet without the drawbacks of freedom of speech and access to information. So the fight continues.”\n\n“Internet Freedom funded the development of many of the censorship-circumvention technologies that millions of people around the world depend on to maintain a link to the outside world,” said Doug Madory, an internet infrastructure expert who works closely with many of these groups.\n\nTheir makers are “often operating on a shoestring and passion. They believe in the cause. There’s no fancy offices, they’re working out of their apartments. It’s not a moneyed industry.”\n\nMost recipients of this money keep it quiet; it’s a dangerous thing, in some places, to take state department funds. But even as the funds run out, more and more organisations – journalists, activists, and civil society – are seeking out these technologies, and the groups that build them. Censorship regimes are getting worse worldwide.\n\n“It’s a massive blow. The need is bigger and other funding is also gone. Organisations that provide these tools are being overwhelmed,” said the digital rights expert. “It’s not sustainable.”\n\nSome of the groups working on these technologies have laid off staff; others are continuing without pay. A few hold out hope that some money can be restored – although they fear that the Trump administration might more overtly politicise its aims. While a recent appropriations bill contains a budget line for Internet Freedom, it names no specific programmes as recipients of this cash.\n\nOthers say they’re existing in a brief grace period as the rest of the funds run out.\n\n“Everybody’s just waiting right now, to be honest. But at the same time, wait at your own risk,” said an Iranian technologist funded through Internet Freedom.\n\nMeanwhile, censorship tech is growing cheaper and easier to access. Chinese companies have exported sophisticated middleboxes – devices that sit on network cables and allow authorities to monitor internet traffic – to countries across Africa and Asia in the past year. These allow regimes such as Iran’s to fine-tune their control over the domestic internet – allowing commerce to continue, for example, while communication is throttled.\n\nSeveral recipients of the US money expressed hope that Europe might fund these technologies in the future; some have already petitioned EU officials for funding.\n\nThe cuts “make it easier to build a ‘digital iron curtain’. It makes it easier for the Kremlin to put Russians in a digital information bubble that reinforces specific narratives about people outside of Russia. This makes it easier for China to do this. For Iran to do this,” one said.",

    "title": "Why Guardians’ Cade Smith Isn’t Playing in the 2026 WBC",
    "description": "Cade Smith will not be competing in the 2026 World Baseball Classic, instead focusing on the Cleveland Guardians' upcoming season.",
    "fullText": "Three years ago, before Cade Smith made his Major League debut or even threw a pitch for the Cleveland Guardians, he had the opportunity to compete for his home country of Canada in the 2023 World Baseball Classic.\n\nSince then, Cade has established himself as one of the best high-leverage relievers in MLB, and for the first time in his career, enter the season as Cleveland’s closer.\n\nHowever, Smith is not playing for Team Canada in the 2026 WBC. It was a decision that he recently told Foul Territory was his own as he heads into\n\n“It was my decision [to not play in the WBC], Cade said.\n\n“In ‘23, it was a phenomenal experience. Like, that was my first experience pitching in major league stadiums in front of sold-out crowds and that kind of environment. I had so much fun and enjoyed that. So, just this year, being at, kind of where things are architecturally, I didn't feel that it was wise for me to take that time away. I wanted to make sure that I was here and completely present and focused on the year coming up.”\n\nThe 2026 season will be Smith’s last year on a minimum MLB contract before his arbitration eligibility next winter. Considering that through his first two years, Smith has a 2.42 ERA, 0.95 WHIP, and 17 saves under his belt, he is in line for quite a large payday, even in his first year in the arbitration process.\n\nThat inevitable payday is contingent on one thing, though: health.\n\nSmith has pitched in 150 games through his first two big-league seasons. That’s a heavy workload for any pitcher in MLB, let alone one with an average fastball velocity of 96.4 mph.\n\nIt’s hard to blame Cade if he didn’t want to compete in the WBC because of this high workload, and solely focus on the upcoming season.\n\nPerhaps three years from now, in the 2029 WBC, Cade will get another chance to rep Candada, but for now, he’s concentrated on the Guardians.\n\nGuardians Roundtable also offers a fan community and message board.
