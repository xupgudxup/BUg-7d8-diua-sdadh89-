    "fullText": "Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nA nearly 2,000-year-old tombstone of a Roman sailor was discovered in the backyard of a New Orleans home.\n\nThe Latin inscription on the grave marker prompted a search for the origin story of the marble stone.\n\nThe buzz about the find in the local news led to the discovery of just how the ancient piece crossed the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThis story is a collaboration with Biography.com.\n\nThe discovery of a nearly 2,000-year-old Roman sailor’s tombstone wasn’t so much an excavation as a backyard cleanup at a New Orleans home.\n\nWhen Daniella Santoro and her husband, Aaron Lorenz, started clearing away brush in the yard of their home, they uncovered a marble slab with what appeared to be a Latin inscription carved on it. In a strange turn of events, the slab turned out to be the grave marker of a Roman military sailor originally housed in an Italian museum. How it ended up 5,250 miles away is quite a journey.\n\nWhen Santoro, an anthropologist at Tulane University and the owner of the historic home on Cambronne Street in the Carrollton neighborhood in New Orleans, initially found the slab, she thought it could have been from one of the city’s historic cemeteries. She contacted D. Ryan Gray, professor of anthropology at the University of New Orleans.\n\n“I never feel like I’ve seen it all,” Gray wrote on the website of the Preservation Resource Center of New Orleans. “There are always surprises and new mysteries to solve.”\n\nThose new mysteries don’t often come with international intrigue that include World War II, garden decor, and the F.B.I.\n\nWith no cemeteries close by, Gray asked for help from a colleague at the University of Innsbruck and scholars at Tulane to decipher the Latin. They independently concluded that the stone featured a Roman funerary inscription for a sailor named Sextus Congenius Verus.\n\nThe second-century C.E. inscription read: “To the Spirits of the Dead for Sextus Congenius Verus, solider of the praetorian fleet Misenensis, from the tribe of the Bessi [of Thrace], (who) lived 42 years (and) served 22 in the military, on the trireme [warship] Asclepius. Atilius Carus and Vettius Longinus, his heirs, made (this) for him, well deserving.”\n\nMore shocking: this inscription was already known in the world of anthropology. “In fact, a stone fitting that exact description was missing from the city museum in Civitavecchia, Italy, near where it had originally been found,” Gray said. “This was a bit of a surprise, and it changed the scope of our inquiries.”\n\nAfter the backyard discovery and identification, the F.B.I.’s Art Crime Team got involved, picking up the one-foot-wide stone and keeping it in custody while the repatriation process kicked off to return the grave marker back to its original home.\n\nGetting the stone back to the Italian museum was one thing, but figuring out how it got to New Orleans was another.\n\nGray started investigating the owners of the home from the 20th century, when the house stayed in the same family for much of the 1900s. Thanks to the U.S. Census, Gray deduced that Frank Simon purchased the house for his family in 1909 while he was working at a wholesale shoe company. His daughters, working as seamstresses, later owned the home. But those facts provided no clues as to how a stone moved from Italy to Louisiana.\n\nWith that dead-end in place, Gray turned to the next-door neighbor, a U.S. Navy veteran who served in World War II. That, too, was a non-starter, showing he deployed in the Pacific and was never stationed in Italy.\n\nSusann Lusnia, associate professor of classical studies at Tulane, took the search to Italy, where she was already planning a summer research stint. She met with staff and curators at the city museum and learned the headstone’s original site, located northwest of Rome, was a major port for the Roman empire and remained a port into the 20th century. Allied bombing raids in 1943 and 1944 targeted the city in World War II, and the museum was destroyed and collections lost.\n\nLusnia discovered the marker was likely lost in the chaos after the war and confirmed the 34th division of the Fifth Army of the U.S. traveled through the town after liberating Rome, with units remaining in the area. At that point, Gray figured there had to be a connection between the soldiers of World War II and the slab, but he had no way of sifting through so many names.\n\nThat’s when crowdsourcing finished the job. As the local news picked up the story, a previous homeowner at the Cambronne Street site heard about the mysterious headstone and immediately made the connection, remembering placing the stone in the garden while planting a tree at her new house two decades ago.\n\n“I just thought it was a piece of art,” said Erin Scott O’Brien, according to Preservation in Print. “I had no idea it was a 2,000-year-old relic.”\n\nO’Brien’s grandfather, Charles Paddock Jr., served in the U.S. Army during World War II, stationed in Italy for a time. He returned to New Orleans in 1946 with his new wife, Adele, who he met in Italy. Charles taught at Loyola University and the tablet in question sat in a cabinet in his Baccich Street home. But with both grandparents passing in the 1980s, O’Brien didn’t know its significance. She ended up with what she thought was a decorative piece and added it to the backyard décor over two decades ago.\n\n“I was really thinking we’d have our list of possible people through whom it could have ended up here,” Gray said. “I didn’t really expect to actually find the actual person, so it’s pretty exciting to know how it ended up here.”\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "description": "All the explanation in the world is worth less than a tenth of the solution, but we’re stuck with the former for now.",
    "fullText": "After coughing up a stoppage time equalizer to Torino on Saturday, Fiorentina’s emotional state is somewhere between crumbling and smoldering. It had looked as if the Viola were going to record their first comeback win of the Serie A season; they’ve conceded first in 13 of 24 league matches in this year, taking a total of 5 points from them. That’s left manager Paolo Vanoli and his squad facing what feels like their 15th consecutive inquest.\n\nI’m just as frustrated as everyone about Fiorentina’s inability to hang on in the dying minutes of a game, not least because this equalizer was so predictable that even I saw it coming. As I often do when I’m sad, I decided to suck as many of the emotions out of my head as possible and turned to the pure, cold realm of numbers, hoping to throttle my sadness with math like a healthy person does. Long story short, I made myself a little table.\n\nI started out wondering if Fiorentina’s conceded more late goals (final 10 minutes and stoppage time) of any team in Serie A this year, but I quickly realized how limited that approach was because it ignored everything else. I decided to include the number of goals teams had scored as well as conceded, as the net value felt more important.\n\nI also decided figure out the rate at which teams conceded late goals. Dividing a 90 minute game into 6 10-minute periods made the most sense. You’d expect teams to concede about 16.67% of their goals in each 10-minute period. Anyways, I grabbed my data and went to my trusty visualizing website. The table’s sortable by any column if you want to play around with it.\n\nMuch to my astonishment, I discovered that Fiorentina isn’t the worst team in Serie A at the end of games by any measure. Hellas Verona and Pisa have both conceded 10 goals in the final 10 minutes, while Fiorentina sits at “just” 9. The percentage of total goals conceded late pulled me up short: the Viola are only 5th-worst, with Verona and Pisa below them, as well as high-flying Roma and Inter Milan? What? That’s wacky.\n\nThe attacking numbers were equally anemic for Vanoli’s boys: just 3 goals scored in the last 10 minutes of games, comprising 11.11% of the total goals conceded. In a truly bizarre statistical quirk, that’s the same as Sassuolo and Udinese while also being considerably higher than both Verona and Roma. Inter, by the way, is blowing everyone else away in late goals, turning this apparent weakness into a strength. In short, the Mastini are for sure the worst late-game team in Serie A, with Fiorentina, Pisa, and Roma jostling for the other two spots on the podium.\n\nOkay, so we’ve determined that Fiorentina isn’t Serie A’s worst late-game team. Let the joy be unconfined, et cetera. The performance in crunch time, though, is obviously a concern and is one of several culprits for the Viola swoon into the relegation places. We’ve got the numbers here to contextualize how dire the situation is but they, like the stars, offer us no solutions.\n\nMuch of it comes down to that squishiest of hard facts: late-game mindset. Against Torino, Fiorentina dominated the second half, scored twice to overturn an undeserved first half deficit, and seemed to be cruising. The only shot the Granata mustered from minutes 46-80 was Saul Coco’s speculative blast from 30-odd yards. Clearly the Viola defense had bottled up the visitors: Torino had 3 touches in the Viola penalty area and none were threatening.\n\nRight around the 80 minute mark, though, Vanoli lost his nerve. He knew that Marco Baroni’s guys, seeing every opportunity to get something from a fragile opponent, would throw everything forward, and the Viola mister wasn’t sure his guys could weather the storm. To help, he brought on Luca Ranieri for Manor Solomon, adding an out-of-form defender for the winger who’d scored one of Fiorentina’s goals and had a hand in the other. Roberto Piccoli also replaced Moise Kean.\n\nIt’s obviously much easier to say this in hindsight but that was a massive error for three reasons. First, Torino no longer had to worry about Solomon and Kean’s pace. That allowed everyone to move up the pitch, safe in the knowledge that there was no counterattack coming. Indeed, Piccoli did some great work late on in beating 2 defenders and getting down the wing but there was nobody with him by the time he reached the end line and it went for a Torino goal kick.\n\nThe second reason was relational. Having defended with a back 4 for 80 minutes and done it quite well (aside from the opening goal), introducing Ranieri to create a back 5 threw everyone off. Torino easily overloaded the wings, forcing Fiorentina’s midfield 3 to shuffle back and forth across the pitch. That eventually created creases like the one Zakaria Aboukhlal found in stoppage time. Sure, Comuzzo shouldn’t have fouled him. But the Moroccan also shouldn’t have had half the pitch to himself and the Ginger Prince, uncertain about the covering defense, opted to bring him down rather than give him a free run.\n\nFinally, Vanoli’s substitutions told his players that they weren’t on the front foot anymore. Fiorentina’s got the mental and emotional strength of a clinically-depressed rutabaga so seeing the team brimming with confidence en route to retaking the lead was a welcome change. That mindset led to a strong second half performance. By dropping deep, the mister essentially told his players, “I don’t believe that you can keep this up so we’ve got to hang on by our fingernails instead.” Confidence isn’t quantifiable but, for a group like this, anything that could damage it has to be weighed carefully.\n\nIt’s easy to fall into the post hoc facto rationalizations, of course. Vanoli’s a smart coach and understands the game and this roster better than any of us. If Torino hadn’t scored, we’d be applauding his sensible parking of the bus. Alternatively, if he hadn’t changed anything and Torino had still equalized, we’d be fuming about his failure to react to the scoreboard in the final moments.\n\nThis is also an overreaction based on a single outcome. The Torino result was uniquely psychically damaging for a number of reasons, not least because it resulted in the 6th and 7th points lost to late goals over the past 10 league outings. To me, the difference is in perceived strength of the opponent. Fiorentina is terrible and Milan isn’t, so losing that game is irritating but also feels like justice. Losing to Hellas Verona, the worst late-game team in Serie A, is an act of god from which nobody is safe.\n\nTorino, though, is historically a club more or less on par with Fiorentina: not big enough to consistently trouble the Champions League places but too good to accept mid-table anonymity. Getting punked by your betters or ambushed by your inferiors stings but not as much as messing up against an equal. That’s the sort of result that forces you to take a long look in the mirror and reassess who you are.",

    "fullText": "While theme park giants such as Disney and Universal have continued to see high visitor numbers in an uncertain economy, many smaller amusement parks and themed hotels in different parts of the world have struggled with rising operational costs, to the point of having to shut down business.\n\nAfter posting a loss of more than $1.2 billion at the end of 2025, Six Flags shared its intention to close more \"underperforming\" locations in its amusement and water park portfolio across North America. A Six Flags park in Maryland had closed down month earlier in November 2025.\n\nAt the start of the new year, the Cartoon Network Hotel serving primarily visitors to the Dutch Wonderland park in central Pennsylvania also shut its doors over a string of financial challenges dating back to the Covid pandemic.\n\nOperating in the British seaside town of Somerset since 1946, Brean Theme Park has become the latest theme park to risk a total shutdown after being assigned liquidators over its financial situation.\n\nThe 80-year-old park was originally a campsite for visitors to the coastline along the Bristol Channel but was expanded into a theme park with rides in the 1970s.\n\nThe park that had become beloved local staple known for its free entry (visitors paid credits for rides they wanted to take) had more than 40 attractions and was preparing to open for the summer season in March when it announced that it was taking \"resolutions for winding-up\" on February 4.\n\nNicholas Stafford of Hazlewoods LLP is the insolvency attorney overseeing the liquidation of Brean in a way that helps creditors and shareholders recoup some of their losses.\n\nAs a former public company, Brean stopped trading at the end of January and, short of a last-minute Hail Mary, will be shuttered forever in the coming weeks. The local notice announcing this decision states that \"the Company be wound up voluntarily.\"\n\nAccording to local reports, visitor numbers dipped significantly during the Covid pandemic, and the theme park was not able to recover from the debt created during that period.\n\nThe closure marks a significant blow to both the Somerset community and vacationers from nearby cities such as Gloucester and Bristol.\n\nThe struggling theme park had been renting land from Unity Holidays, the company also behind parks such as Brean Unity Holidays, Brean Splash, Brean Play, and Brean Gym, reported U.K. outlet Daily Express. Those parks, according to their ownership, will continue to operate in the coming summer.",

With all that we have given them, we should own, perhaps, at least one half of this asset,\" Trump added.\n\nThe Gordie Howe International Bridge is expected to be completed in early 2026 and has been under construction since 2018. The $6.4 billion project is entirely funded by Canada's Federal government, and will feature six lanes and a pedestrian and cycling path.\n\nThe University of Windsor's Cross-Border Institute estimated in a 2021 study that the new route will save about 850,000 hours a year for trucks, which would mean billions of dollars in savings over the bridge's lifetime. The study also found that the Windsor-Detroit corridor is the largest pathway for trade between the US and Canada.\n\nTrump's remarks mark the latest escalation in tensions with Canada, a key US trading partner, as the president steps up his criticism of the country.\n\nIn recent weeks, Trump has threatened to slap a 100% tariff on Canadian goods if Ottawa moves forward with a trade deal with China.\n\nHe also bristled at comments made by Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney at the World Economic Forum in Davos, which were widely seen as an implicit rebuke of Trump's foreign and economic policies.

But soon after, the American confirmed his departure from the league and announced plans to spend most of his season on the DP World Tour while serving a one-year suspension from the PGA Tour.\n\nReed’s suspension is set to end in August, but he was already planning to return as a past champion. His recent win at the Qatar Masters has nearly secured him one of the 10 full cards available through the DP World Tour.\n\nHowever, with two wins already this year, there are growing calls for him to be reinstated sooner rather than later.\n\nRyan Lavner discussed the possibility of an early return on the Golf Channel Podcast and argued that the PGA Tour should make use of Reed’s current form.\n\n“I love this idea because if we’re already rewriting the rules with this Returning Member Program, here’s another rule that they should write in: a battlefield promotion on the DP World Tour.\n\n“If you win three times, you should automatically jump to the PGA Tour. They already do it for the Korn Ferry Tour. You do have the strategic alliance, expedite Patrick Reed to the PGA Tour if he wins one more time,” he stated.\n\nIf Reed gets the chance to return to the PGA Tour and takes it, it would be a blow for the European circuit.\n\nHe has given an immediate lift to some of the DP World Tour events that do not carry the same profile as those in the Rolex Series.\n\nAs of now, it looks like his first event even partly connected to the PGA Tour will be at the Scottish Open in July.\n\nWith his world ranking now inside the top 20, Reed should also qualify for The Players Championship in March.\n\nBut his suspension is set to keep him out of TPC Sawgrass unless a rule change opens that door. On current form, it is a case they might need to look at more closely.\n\nChris Gotterup’s ‘problem’ highlighted despite WM Phoenix Open triumph\n\nChris Gotterup addresses WM Phoenix Open crowds following Hideki Matsuyama incident",

    "fullText": "Liverpool last remodelled their midfield back in 2023.\n\nJurgen Klopp and then-sporting director Jorg Schmadtke overhauled the Reds’ midfield - bringing in the likes of Alexis Mac Allister, Dominik Szoboszlai, Wataru Endo and Ryan Gravenberch.\n\nIt’s fair to say those deals have been successes - with Liverpool adding the EFL Cup to their trophy collection in 2024 before winning last season’s 2024/25 Premier League title.\n\nThe time has come however to consider adjustments to the midfield - owing in part to uncertainty over some players’ futures.\n\nWe could see Curtis Jones sold for example as the homegrown star stalls on a new contract. Endo - like Jones - is out of contract in 2027 with the club having listened to several offers for the Japan captain over previous transfer windows.\n\nAlexis Mac Allister has been heavily linked with Real Madrid and it remains to be seen what kind of conclusion contract talks reach with Gravenberch and Szoboszlai too.\n\nShop the goalkeeper range today\n\nShop the third kit range today!\n\nIt’s no wonder we’ve seen several midfield targets associated with an Anfield move ahead of the window opening. And one of those who HAS been sounded out for a deal is Newcastle’s wantaway playmaker Sandro Tonali.\n\nThe 25-year-old has been on Tyneside since 2023 - establishing himself as a consistent presence in both the Premier League and Champions League.\n\nBut it looks like the Italian international’s time with the Toon could be coming to an end. Under contract until 2028 the player’s agent revealed last week that it was perhaps time to consider his future.\n\nNewcastle will be against losing him for nothing in two years and so could be forced to entertain bids this summer instead.\n\nAnd a report in TEAMtalk is now claiming that Liverpool - as well as Arsenal and Manchester City have opened talks with the midfield schemer’s entourage over the terms of a deal.\n\n“Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester City have all made contact with Tonali’s camp,” the report reads.\n\nBut right now Premier League suitors appear to be in second place - with Tonali preferring a return to Serie A for family reasons.\n\n“The midfielder’s heart is pulling him back to Italy, where he wants to settle again with his family,” the report reads.\n\n“Juventus and Inter Milan are both extremely keen to make that happen.”",

    "description": "Jetavanaramaya, a colossal fourth-century Sri Lankan stupa, was once among the world’s largest structures — a vast and ancient brick-built engineering marvel born out of religious rivalry that has end...",
    "fullText": "Visit the ancient city of Anuradhapura on a full moon day and the past feels anything but distant.\n\nBuddhist pilgrims dressed in white walk barefoot along dusty paths. Saffron-robed monks chant at dawn. Foreign visitors — from Taiwan to Canada — join local worshipers in rituals that have been performed here, largely uninterrupted, for more than 2,000 years.\n\nSet on Sri Lanka’s north-central plains, Anuradhapura was the island’s first great capital. Today, it remains one of the most sacred cities in the Buddhist world, known as the first place to adopt Buddhism outside of India. Scattered across its vast archaeological park are monasteries, reservoirs and stupas that rank among the most ambitious religious monuments ever built.\n\nTowering above them is the immense, bubble-shaped dome of Jetavanaramaya — a structure so large that when it was completed in the early fourth century CE, it ranked as the third-largest man‑made building on Earth, surpassed only by the Great Pyramids of Giza.\n\nCompleted around 301 CE using an estimated 93.3 million baked mud bricks, the stupa originally rose to around 122 meters (400 feet), making it one of the tallest structures of the ancient world.\n\nToday, after centuries of collapse, abandonment and restoration, Jetavanaramaya stands at roughly 71 meters (233 feet) — still monumental, but little more than half its original height. Even so, it remains the largest brick structure by volume ever constructed.\n\nSo vast is its mass that archaeologists estimate its bricks could build a three-foot-high wall stretching from London to Edinburgh — or from New York City to Pittsburgh.\n\nYet outside Sri Lanka, Jetavanaramaya is little known. Unlike the pyramids, it was not continuously visible to history. Jungle growth, shifting religious priorities and selective preservation gradually buried both the monument and much of its story, leaving one of the ancient world’s greatest engineering achievements largely forgotten.\n\nJetavanaramaya refers not only to the stupa itself, but to the heart of a vast monastic complex known as Jetavana Vihara, designed to house hundreds of monks. Every structure in the complex was oriented toward the stupa, ensuring that monks stepping outside their residences would face it first — a daily reminder of devotion and cosmological order.\n\n“About 200 monks lived here,” explains Godamune Pannaseeha, a bespectacled monk and senior archaeology officer in Anuradhapura, and one of the foremost contemporary experts on Jetavanaramaya.\n\n“People came to offer robes, books, food — everything — to gain merit,” he says, pointing to the lower terraces of the stupa where offerings were once made, while walking a slow, clockwise circuit around its base. “This was a living religious city.”\n\nFrom the outset, however, Jetavanaramaya was controversial. It was built on land traditionally associated with the Maha Vihara, the orthodox Theravada Buddhist establishment, reportedly without the consent of its monks. The complex later became associated with the Sagalika sect, which followed Mahayana‑leaning doctrines.\n\nNo Mahayana chronicles from ancient Sri Lanka have survived. Today, Sri Lanka remains a predominantly Theravada Buddhist nation. As a result, much of Jetavanaramaya’s history — including the political and doctrinal tensions surrounding its creation — must be reconstructed indirectly, leaving historians with incomplete and sometimes contested versions.\n\nThe technical challenges involved in building Jetavanaramaya were immense. Unlike Egypt’s stone pyramids, this colossal structure was built almost entirely from mud bricks — a material far more vulnerable to erosion and collapse.\n\n“To replace one stone block, you need perhaps 10 bricks,” says Anura Manatunga, senior professor of archaeology at Sri Lanka’s University of Kelaniya. “That means millions upon millions of bricks had to be prepared, transported and laid with precision.”\n\nArchaeologists have identified ancient brick kilns in and around Anuradhapura, confirming large‑scale brick production in the region. None, however, can yet be definitively linked to Jetavanaramaya or securely dated to the early fourth century.\n\nMoving this volume of material would have required extraordinary organization — and labor.\n\nWhile no records specifically mention animals at Jetavanaramaya, historians believe elephants and bullock carts were almost certainly used, as they were at other major Sri Lankan construction sites — including Ruwanwelisaya, the city’s most sacred stupa, built centuries earlier in 140 BCE.\n\nElephants likely hauled bricks and stamped down soil at the foundations, a technique used in traditional construction on the island until relatively recent times.\n\nScaffolding would have relied heavily on bamboo, bound with coir rope made from coconut fibre and jungle creepers. Metal was used sparingly, reserved for tools rather than structural elements.\n\nJetavanaramaya reflects the height of ancient Sri Lankan engineering knowledge. Its massive hemispherical form distributes weight efficiently, while its foundations were carefully prepared. Ancient chronicles describe how builders flooded excavated ground to observe absorption — a rudimentary but effective form of soil testing.\n\nA fallen section of the stupa reveals further ingenuity. Pannaseeha points out a hollow, cylindrical chamber within the ruins that suggests an early understanding of ventilation.\n\nDespite this sophistication, time has taken its toll. Earthquakes, monsoon rains and centuries of abandonment caused sections of the stupa to collapse. The last major renovation took place in the 12th century, during the reign of King Parakramabahu I.\n\nMore recent restoration efforts introduced cement into some outer layers — a decision archaeologists now believe may have accelerated deterioration rather than prevented it. The original mortar used to lay its bricks was composed of a mixture of finely crushed dolomite, limestone, sieved sand and clay.\n\nExcavations have also uncovered reliquary caskets embedded throughout the stupa at different structural levels. These held sacred relics and ritual deposits, reinforcing Jetavanaramaya’s role not only as an architectural feat but as a sacred structure built from the inside out.\n\nAmong the most significant discoveries linked to Jetavanaramaya are gold panels depicting Bodhisattva imagery and inscribed with sections of the Prajñāpāramitā sutra, a foundational Mahayana Buddhist text. Now held at the National Museum in Colombo, the panels were written in Sanskrit using ancient local scripts.\n\nThey offer rare material evidence of Mahayana practice in ancient Sri Lanka, suggesting Jetavana was once a center of cosmopolitan Buddhist thought, connected by doctrine and trade routes to India and beyond.\n\nStanding at the base of the stupa, Pannaseeha gestures toward the damaged spire.\n\n“Historical accounts say that a diamond once crowned the pinnacle, possibly to deflect lightning during monsoon storms,” he says.\n\nThe spire itself is unusual. “It resembles a tower,” he notes — a form some scholars believe may reflect technological influence from the Roman or broader Mediterranean world, transmitted through Indian Ocean trade networks.\n\nWhether symbolic or functional, much about its construction remains unclear.\n\n“We can see small remains of the decorative motifs, including those of the Naga, a cobra-hood form,” Pannaseeha adds, pointing to intricate carvings at the base. “But we still don’t know exactly how they were fixed in place.”\n\nJetavanaramaya’s immense scale invites comparison with Ruwanwelisaya, the gleaming white stupa nearby that today holds far greater religious significance for Sri Lankans.\n\nRuwanwelisaya is believed to enshrine some of Buddhism’s most venerated relics, including a portion of the Buddha’s remains. It remains the focal point of pilgrimage and national religious life.\n\nThough smaller than Jetavanaramaya in its original form, Ruwanwelisaya has been continuously maintained and today rises higher than Jetavana’s truncated structure, standing at more than 100 meters (328 feet).\n\nWhere Jetavanaramaya represents architectural audacity and doctrinal debate, Ruwanwelisaya embodies devotional continuity.\n\nEetalawetunwawe Gnanathilaka Thero, one of the country’s most respected religious figures and chief monk at the Ruwanwelisaya, has noticed a steady increase in foreign visitors to Anuradhapura in recent years.\n\n“First there was civil war, then a pandemic,” he says. “But the past two years, there has been a noticeable increase in foreign visitors to our holy city.”\n\nTravelers are welcome to observe — and participate in — any of the nine daily puja rituals, with the first beginning at dawn.\n\nVisit on a full moon day and thousands of pilgrims arrive, waiting patiently to enter Ruwanwelisaya and Sri Maha Bodhi, the temple that surrounds a sacred fig tree believed to be grown from a sapling of the tree under which the Buddha attained enlightenment.\n\nPerhaps the most striking fact about Jetavanaramaya is that nothing like it was ever built again. For nearly 700 years after its completion, no stupa of comparable scale was attempted in Sri Lanka.\n\n“This was the last truly gigantic stupa,” Manatunga says. “Not only here, but even in Southeast Asia, later builders adopted the same bubble-shaped form — but never at this scale.”\n\nJetavanaramaya stands today as evidence of an ancient society capable of organizing labor, materials and engineering knowledge on a scale that rivalled any civilization of its time.\n\nThat it remains relatively unknown beyond Sri Lanka may be one of history’s great oversights — a reminder that some of the ancient world’s most extraordinary achievements were not carved in stone, but shaped from earth, devotion and human ingenuity.",

    "title": "Meet ‘The Baroness’—the world’s longest wild snake",
    "description": "She's more than 23 feet long, and verified by Guinness World Records.",
    "fullText": "Nothing could have prepared Radu Frentiu for meeting the snake known as Ibu Baron, which means \"The Baroness\" in Indonesian.\n\n“I had never seen a snake this big,” says Frentiu. “This snake could easily swallow at least a calf, if not an adult cow.”\n\nFrentiu, an explorer and natural history photographer who has lived in Bali, Indonesia, for two decades, has encountered his share of big snakes. But Ibu Baron deserved a record-breaking distinction.\n\nGuinness World Records recently confirmed that Ibu Baron, a reticulated python (Malayopython reticulatus), is believed to be the longest verifiably measured wild snake in the world. She was first discovered in the Maros region of South Sulawesi, Indonesia, in late 2025.\n\nFrentiu learned about the giant python from Diaz Nugraha, a wildlife guide, rescuer, and licensed snake handler from Borneo. Together, they traveled to Sulawesi to see the animal firsthand and measure her.\n\nOn January 18, Frentiu and Nugraha weighed and measured Ibu Baron, documenting the process with photographs and video to be as transparent as possible. Using a surveyor’s tape that followed the snake’s natural curves, they recorded a total length of 23 feet and 8 inches from head to tail tip. The python also weighed in at 213 pounds—and that was on an empty stomach.\n\nFrentiu says the snake’s true length could be even longer, since she was not sedated when the measurements were taken. Under anesthesia, a snake’s muscles fully relax, potentially adding another 10 to 15 percent to her length.\n\nReticulated pythons are already the world’s longest snake species, typically reaching lengths between 10 to 19 feet. Larger individuals have been reported throughout history, but most claims rely on secondhand accounts or animals that were killed shortly after discovery. In many cases, the snakes vanish before their size can ever be verified. “These giant animals attract attention as status symbols,” Frentiu says. “They tend to disappear, or something bad happens to them.” Ibu Baron’s continued survival is what makes her exceptional.\n\nLocal conservationist Budi Purwanto, who acted quickly when word of the snake spread, has played an important role in Ibu Baron’s longevity. Rather than allowing her to be sold or killed, he acquired her and constructed a makeshift shelter on his property, where she now lives alongside several other rescued snakes. Releasing her into the local area would be risky. Large prey animals, such as babirusa and other wild pigs, are scarce, while human settlements are numerous.\n\n“A python this big will probably be drawn toward a village,” Frentiu explains. “And once that happens, it will almost certainly be killed.”\n\nAcross Indonesia, habitat loss and declining prey have pushed large snakes into closer contact with humans. Reticulated pythons are non-venomous, but their size and strength make them lethal predators capable of killing livestock and, in rare cases, people. Human fear is often fatal for the snakes, which are also hunted for bushmeat and targeted by the illegal wildlife trade.\n\nFor Frentiu, Nugraha, and Purwanto, Ibu Baron represents a chance to change that dynamic. By protecting her and keeping her visible, including through recognition by Guinness World Records, they hope to show that giant snakes can be worth more alive than dead. “It can give this animal importance and hopefully value,” Frentiu says. “It can empower local communities to look after these animals and view them as a resource for the long-term.” He points to a growing niche of herpetological tourism—wildlife tours focused on spotting reptiles and amphibians—as one possible path forward.\n\nFrentiu is careful not to frame Ibu Baron as the record-holder for all time—there could be even bigger snakes out there. “I do not believe in the slightest that this is the largest wild snake. I got lucky,” he says.\n\n“There are still wonders out there. This is one of them—and I don’t think it’s the last.”",

    "fullText": "Bangladesh have requested that Pakistan end their planned boycott of their T20 World Cup match against India, opening the door for the fixture to be played on 15 February as scheduled.\n\nThe match, the biggest and most lucrative in cricket, has been in doubt since the Pakistan government advised its team not to take the field against their long-time rivals.\n\nPrime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said that initial decision was made to \"support\" Bangladesh, who had a request for their matches to be moved out of India rejected and subsequently pulled out of the tournament.\n\nBut, after talks between officials at the Pakistan Cricket Board, the International Cricket Council and the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) in Lahore on Sunday, BCB president Ameenul Islam requested the match go ahead \"for the benefit of the entire cricket ecosystem\".\n\n\"We are deeply moved by Pakistan's efforts to go above and beyond in supporting Bangladesh during this period. Long may our brotherhood flourish,\" he added.\n\nThe match is scheduled to take place in the city of Colombo in Sri Lanka, the co-hosts for the tournament with India.\n\nPakistan will forfeit the points from the group-stage match should it not be played but the team's absence from the tournament would also have longer-term consequences for cricket.\n\nIt could lead to disputes over the ICC's current rights deals and continued uncertainty would likely impact future agreements, with the current TV deals set to run out after the 2027 World Cup.\n\nMany of the smaller cricketing nations rely on the money distributed by the ICC, so any cut in revenue would likely hit such countries hardest.\n\n\"Following my short visit to Pakistan yesterday and given the forthcoming outcomes of our discussions, I request Pakistan to play the ICC T20 World Cup game on 15 February against India for the benefit of the entire cricket ecosystem,\" Islam said.\n\nWhile stopping short of confirming the match will go ahead, the ICC released a statement on Monday evening confirming Bangladesh will not be sanctioned for their boycott.\n\nIt also said Bangladesh will host an ICC event between 2028 and the start of the 2031 World Cup.\n\n\"The ICC, PCB and BCB, along with other members, remain committed to continued dialogue, cooperation and constructive engagement in the best interests of the sport,\" a statement said.\n\n\"All stakeholders acknowledge that the spirit of this understanding is to protect the integrity of the game and preserve unity within the cricket fraternity.\"\n\nThere were no details on what event Bangladesh would host. All men's events have been confirmed up until 2031, with Bangladesh already scheduled to co-host the 2031 World Cup with India.\n\nThe hosts of women's tournaments have been chosen up to 2027, while the ICC also holds Under-19 World Cups.\n\nThe PCB has been contacted for comment.\n\nWhat next in Pakistan-India controversy as ICC confirm forfeit stance?",

    "fullText": "He has been jailed, tracked and threatened by China’s government. What was it like pay a visit home? As he publishes a polemic about surveillance and state control, the artist relives a momentous trip to see his mother\n\nAi Weiwei is talking me through the decision-making process before his first visit to China in over a decade. The artist, known around the world as the most famous critic of the Chinese communist regime, had to do some fraught arithmetic before deciding to head back home.\n\nBefore boarding a flight with his son, who had never met the artist’s elderly mother, Ai thought back to his time in detention when his captors told him he would spend the next 13 years in custody on bogus charges: “They said, ‘When you come out, your son won’t recognise you.’ That was very heavy and really the only moment that touched me.”\n\nHe ended up spending several months in captivity. Lao, his son, is now 17. Ai says Lao doesn’t really need his guidance any more so he decided to book their flights and roll the dice. “People said, ‘Are you scared?’ I said, ‘No, why should I be scared?’ I’m Chinese. I have a Chinese passport. I’m entitled to go back and see my mum. So I went back.”\n\nWelcome to the life of Ai Weiwei. For most people, returning home doesn’t involve weighing up the risk of whether you’ll see close family ever again, but that’s the reality for a 68-year-old whose whole existence has been shaped by authoritarianism and the struggle against it.\n\nHis trip to China went well. He ended up being interviewed at the airport and released after a couple of hours into a country whose smells, sights and sounds were soothing to him. Ai described the journey as being like “a phone call suddenly reconnecting”. Today, he’s more poetic, describing it as “a piece of jade broken that you can put back together because it matches very well. Everything’s so familiar: the light, the temperature, the people.”\n\nAi is meeting me in the London offices of his publisher to talk about his new book, On Censorship, a 90-page polemic on the nature of state control, AI and surveillance. The man certainly knows about these things. Born in Beijing in 1957, he grew up in labour camps in north-west China following the exile of his father, the poet Ai Qing. In 2011, he was detained for 81 days in a 170 sq ft windowless prison because of his own activism. Upon his release, he was tracked, interrogated and threatened by the Chinese state; then his passport was returned in 2015 and he began a life in exile. He currently divides his time between Lisbon, Berlin and Cambridge.\n\nHis artworks are as dramatic as his backstory. An army of 1,600 Chinese artisans created 100m hand-painted porcelain “seeds” that were scattered over the floor of Tate Modern’s Turbine Hall in London 16 years ago. He cloaked Berlin’s Konzerthaus in 14,000 fluorescent orange lifejackets worn by refugees; and made a film dedicated to the children who died in the 2008 Sichuan earthquake. That direct challenge to the official state narrative made him “the most dangerous person in China”.\n\nHis upcoming work, at Aviva Studios in Manchester, involves 30 tonnes of buttons, which were saved from a London factory that was closing down and smuggled into China to be turned into huge hanging artworks by craftspeople.\n\nThe book is a startling read, arguing that those in the west misunderstand the nature of censorship. He defines it as “the exercise of power over intellectual space”, both “an indispensable tool of mental enslavement and a fundamental source of political corruption”. It is not just authoritarian regimes, he warns. Liberal societies think that censorship is rare, “but people forget that even on sunny days, shadows are inevitable”.\n\nSome of the arguments are perplexing. In a section about the limitations of AI, the artist refers to the selfie he took with AfD leader Alice Weidel in 2018. He says AI decided that the image, which is real, must have been fake because the pair seemed to be on opposite ends of the political spectrum. At the time of the selfie, Weidel, whose grandfather was a Nazi, was considered to be in the more moderate wing of the far-right party, but since becoming leader has called for “large-scale repatriations” of foreigners, saying the country’s focus on the Holocaust is akin to a “guilt cult”.\n\nDoes Ai regret the selfie? He tells me that on many issues, her political demands “could be wrong”, but she’s still “more rational than other political opponents in Germany”. What about her anti-immigrant rhetoric – isn’t that anathema to him? “Some states don’t even accept one [immigrant] and Germany accepts 1.2 million, which is a pretty generous decision,” he replies. “So if they change the policy and they want to limit it, then there is nothing wrong.”\n\nHe’s also impressed by the fact that Weidel “openly wants Germany to be more independent from American influence”. He adds: “I think those are some of the things that we need to do.” Those who know German politics would find that argument surprising because the AfD are seen as the party who are closest to Trump and nearly all parties in the country want more independence from the US. A ringing endorsement of someone at the outermost reaches of far-right European politics might cause a few double takes, and there are more surprises.\n\nAi’s attitude to China has shifted dramatically. The nation, he said recently, is “in an upward phase,” pointing to the technological advancements made and increased personal freedoms. The west, however, struggles to “sustain its own logic”, has lost its “ethical authority” and has “descended into something barely recognisable”.\n\nAlthough a quick glance across the Atlantic at America in the age of ICE raids does somewhat make his point, he means Europe, too. So is the Chinese regime’s most famous critic now toeing the party line? “My position with China started before I could recognise myself as an individual. I grew up in this black hole with my father,” he says, pointing to a picture on his iPhone of a desolate location in north-west China.\n\nHe’s not angry exactly, but the suggestion that he’s softened on the Chinese government has touched a nerve. “I still have a Chinese passport. My mum is still Chinese. So that’s my only relationship to China,” he says. “I’m not nostalgic. I’m not patriotic.” What about the claim that the west embraces censorship? Is that his experience in the UK? “I cannot get into details,” he says cryptically. “But I feel the same kind of surveillance, same kind of censorship in the west.”\n\nPressed for an example, he tells me a story about the Royal Academy in London, an institution that gave him a landmark exhibition in 2015 and made him an honorary member in 2011 following his detainment in China. In November 2023, an exhibition of new works to be shown at the Lisson Gallery was pulled after he posted a tweet that began: “The sense of guilt around the persecution of the Jewish people has been, at times, transferred to offset the Arab world.” The tweet was deleted, with the artist telling journalists his show had “effectively [been] cancelled”.\n\nIn the aftermath, a vote was then held at the RA to determine whether his membership should be revoked because of accusations that the post was antisemitic. “I don’t have the intention of an antisemite. My best friends, they’re all Jewish people,” says Ai. “I tweeted millions of tweets on Twitter, but [how is it that] this tweet can cause such trouble? Then they said the procedure is to let the Academicians vote.”\n\nHis peers supported him and he won the vote. Ai was then asked to write an article about freedom of speech for the RA’s magazine, which he did, arguing: “Speaking the truth and insisting on one’s own perspective is dangerous and may come at a heavy price. Books may go unpublished, exhibitions may be closed, concerts cancelled.”\n\nAfter he sent it, there was silence. Then he says the RA claimed they didn’t have room to run the piece. For him, this is the censorship in the west, which he argues in On Censorship can be “more covert, more deceptive and more corrosive” than in authoritarian regimes. “I have several cases like this,” Ai adds. “Happens in Britain and in Germany.”\n\nThe RA disputes this account, claiming the decision to drop the piece was made before Ai submitted it. A spokesperson added: “Plurality of voices, tolerance and free thinking are at the core of what we stand for and seek to protect.”\n\nI wonder how Ai feels about the world in 2026. His new book paints it as a place without refuge for those who value self-expression and freedom of speech. “I think today we are living in a complicated world, where life is more like a shattered mirror,” he says. “It reflects the reality, but the reality can be a broken reality.”\n\nDid his trip to China restore his faith in humanity? There’s a pause. “If we were in the time of the Tang dynasty, someone like me would go back and write beautiful poetry,” he says, smiling. “But not today. I just take a few selfies.”",

    "fullText": "Newly released documents detail convicted sex offender’s early backing of bitcoin and Coinbase\n\nMillions of files related to Jeffrey Epstein have brought to light his ties to the highest echelons of the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nDocuments published last week by the US Department of Justice reveal Epstein bankrolled the “principal home and funding source” for bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency, during its nascent stages; he also invested $3m in Coinbase in 2014, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the US, and cut a check that same year to Blockstream, a prominent bitcoin-focused technology firm. Both crypto startups accepted Epstein’s investments in 2014 – six years after his 2008 conviction in Florida for soliciting prostitution from a minor.\n\nDespite murmurings among crypto communities online about the need for a sector-level reckoning around the Epstein files’ revelations, most industry players predict few consequences for crypto companies or the sector writ large. Some see Epstein as a “skeptical investor” who pulled out of his crypto investments prematurely; others go so far as to claim Epstein was attempting to “undermine bitcoin”.\n\nThe crypto companies that secured Epstein’s investment have grown into multibillion-dollar giants, especially Coinbase, which went public on the Nasdaq in 2021, and whose co-founder, Brian Armstrong, has heavily influenced crypto regulation in the United States.\n\nEpstein’s 2014 investment in Coinbase was brokered by the crypto evangelist Brock Pierce, a former child actor and a co-founder of Tether, the world’s largest issuer of stablecoins, a kind of cryptocurrency whose value is typically pegged to a national currency.\n\nDocuments published by the justice department reveal Fred Ehrsam, a co-founder of Coinbase who spearheaded its fundraise, liaised with Pierce about Epstein’s investment in the company and sought to meet with Epstein “if convenient”. Additional filings suggest Epstein sold half of his shares to Pierce’s firm, Blockchain Capital, for $15m in 2018.\n\nA spokeswoman for Coinbase declined to comment; Pierce did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nEpstein’s financing of bitcoin’s development stemmed from his role as a donor to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Over the course of 20 years, MIT accepted more than $800,000 from Epstein, who also facilitated more than $7m in donations from other wealthy individuals.\n\nIn communications from 2015 between Joichi Ito, then director of MIT’s Media Lab, a tech-focused research institute, and Epstein, Ito wrote that Epstein’s “gift funds” were used to “underwrite” the launch of the Digital Currency Initiative, an offshoot of the Lab tasked with researching and developing open-source crypto technologies; in the same email thread, Ito explained that the Lab’s role was to serve as the “principal home and funding source” for bitcoin. The Digital Currency Initiative did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nIn 2014, Ito brokered Epstein’s investment in Blockstream, which builds bitcoin-focused tech solutions. Epstein made a $500,000 early-stage investment in the company through an investment fund he co-owned with Ito. Email communications reveal Blockstream’s co-founders, Adam Back and Austin Hill, were invited by Epstein to meet in St Thomas, close to Little Saint James, the private island Epstein owned.\n\nOn Twitter, Back claimed that Blockstream understood Epstein to be a “limited partner in Ito’s fund”, which later divested from Blockstream “due to a potential conflict of interest, and other concerns” – meaning that “Blockstream has no direct nor indirect financial connection with Jeffrey Epstein, or his estate”.\n\nIn communications with an Italian investor, Epstein noted that he “like[d]” Back. Hill continued communicating with Epstein into 2017, checking in with his “friend” following a storm in the Caribbean. “Just checking that your Island is OK,” reads the email thread’s subject line. Representatives for Blockstream and Hill did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nLuke Dashjr, an early contributor to bitcoin’s development as well as to Blockstream, has called for Adam Back to resign from his role as Blockstream’s CEO over ties to Epstein. In an interview with the Guardian, Dashjr said Epstein’s interest in bitcoin – namely, his “attempts to undermine” bitcoin’s network, early-stage companies, and developers – was a sign that “evil men often seek to destroy what is good”.\n\nCharlotte Fang, the founder of Remilia, which makes NFTs and other crypto-based art, said “only unserious people might care” about Epstein’s investment in bitcoin and Coinbase; in the latter case, “only the financially unsophisticated” would assume that he had “any degree of influence over the direction” of the exchange, as his seven-figure investment was a small part of Coinbase’s fundraise.\n\n“Bitcoin is a decentralized technology that required no funding, and Epstein was evidently a skeptical investor, who got in later than I did, and exited earlier than he should have,” Fang said.\n\n“Generally speaking, retail consumers will not change their habits” around crypto following this recent release of Epstein files, according to Kadan Stadelmann of Komodo, a crypto platform. Investor practices, including their dependence on connections to cut checks, will probably adhere to the status quo, he added. Some competitor crypto exchanges might see new customers who are leaving Coinbase following these new allegations, he hypothesized – as long as these exchanges didn’t take money from “similar unsavory sources”.\n\nAs to why Epstein was so interested in crypto, and in Coinbase specifically? “Epstein might have liked Coinbase’s IPO prospects,” he surmised.\n\nCryptocurrencies’ technological capabilities may have also played a role in Epstein’s interest in the sector, said Antulio Rosales, a professor at York University who studies crypto.\n\n“There’s his possibility of seeing markets without any ethical commitments, and without any pressures of social norms and of the law itself,” he said.",

    "title": "AI agents failed at real-world consulting tasks — but Mercor's CEO says they're still on track to replace consultants",
    "description": "Mercor found AI agents failed at most consulting tasks, but its CEO says the models are improving so rapidly consultants should be worried.",
    "fullText": "New research suggests an AI agent can't fully replace a human consultant — at least for now.\n\nMercor, the AI training giant, tested how well leading AI models, acting as agents, performed real-world consulting, banking, and legal tasks.\n\nThe models failed most of the time, but Mercor's CEO, Brendan Foody, told Business Insider that the results tell only part of the story.\n\nThe consulting tasks in Mercor's APEX-Agents benchmark were designed to simulate real management consulting work, based on expert surveys and input from consultants at McKinsey, BCG, Deloitte, Accenture, and EY.\n\nAcross all task categories, the AI agents successfully completed the tasks less than 25% of the time on the first try. Given eight attempts, the agents could only complete 40% of the tasks. For the management consulting tasks, OpenAI's GPT 5.2 initially performed the best, completing nearly 23% of the tasks on its first attempt. Anthropic's Opus 4.6, released this week, performed even better at nearly 33%.\n\nWhile many of the tasks were not completed, Foody said the success rate for GPT 3 was only 3%, compared to 23% for GPT 5.2. Anthropic's model went from 13% to 33% on consulting tasks in a matter of months. Foody said he expects the success rate of the models to be closer to 50% by the end of the year.\n\n\"These are some of the hardest tasks in the economy that people pay millions of dollars to consulting firms to do, and the models are finally being able to do them with an incredible rate of progress,\" Foody said.\n\nAI has already disrupted the consulting industry, changing the way firms hire and make money, but the likelihood of agents displacing consultants grows as the models continue to improve.\n\nMcKinsey chief Bob Sternfels recently said the prestigious management consulting firm had 60,000 employees, 25,000 of which were AI agents.\n\nSternfels recently said it's the first time in McKinsey's history that the company is able to grow without growing its head count.\n\nThe frontier models Mercor tested included those from OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic, among others.\n\nOne example consulting task instructed the AI agent to \"analyze category consumption patterns and market penetration using the Category Penetration Score methodology for PureLife's portfolio strategy,\" asking for several specific outputs in response. The AI agents failed to produce an accurate response.\n\n\"No model is ready to replace a professional end-to-end,\" the findings concluded.\n\nMercor found the AI agents were great at research and pretty good at data analysis, Foody said.\n\nWhere they consistently got tripped up was on longer-horizon tasks — the longer it would take a human to complete a task, or the more steps it took, was the biggest indicator that the model might have a hard time.\n\nUnlike a human, Foody said, the models struggle to understand where in a specific file system they should look for the right information, so they often end up looking at the wrong files. They struggle with the planning side of figuring out how to work with multiple tools and cross-referencing files at the same time.\n\nFor tasks that can be done in an hour or less or that only require the use of a single tool, the models perform relatively well.\n\nFoody said the agents are almost like interns, where they might have a 50% pass rate, and the partner is still noticing a lot of issues in the work.\n\nFrank Jones, a former KPMG consultant who now works as an expert contractor for Mercor, said in his experience training AI, he's found the models can get close at certain tasks, but that some human refinement is often needed.\n\nHe also said the models need very specific prompts because they don't always understand common expectations or phrases in consulting, like \"client-ready.\"\n\n\"Most consultants, they know what that means. But for AI, I think there's a lot of nuance in that,\" he said.\n\nAccording to Foody, continuing to improve the models doesn't require a breakthrough — it requires more and better training, which the frontier labs are already investing heavily in.\n\n\"That's why we have so much revenue,\" he said, adding, \"We're in the business of replacing human judgment.\"\n\nMercor, whose clients have included OpenAI, Anthropic, and Meta, secured a funding deal in the fall that valued the company at $10 billion. Mercor employs more than 30,000 contractors around the world who help train AI models through tasks like rewriting chatbot responses. Foody previously said the company grew its revenue in 2025 by 4,658%.\n\nFoody said he believes consulting, and especially lower-level roles, are among the jobs he's confident will be displaced by AI. He said the next version of the AI agents benchmark will expand to evaluate the whole value chain of a professional services firm: \"Instead of evaling the analyst, we're evaling McKinsey itself.\"\n\nRight now, he says Mercor's AI agent benchmark tells an appealing story for McKinsey, because the company could say it shows they can use AI to add value but not replace humans.\n\n\"The next version of APEX tells a very scary story for McKinsey,\" he said, adding, \"In the coming two years, we're going to have chatbots that are as good as the best consulting firm.\"",

I have yet to come up with a world-beating name for it, so for now let’s just call it “How bloody stupid is AI?” The playing of the game will change from player to player, depending on their circumstances – but essentially the rules remain the same. Ask AI a simple question about yourself, and see just how wrong it gets it.\n\nIn my case, all you need know is that while I, through the nature of my job, have a fairly large online presence, my partner (we married in 1987) has assiduously avoided having one at all. Which means that if you Google “Martin Rowson wife” in images, you may get a picture of me next to our then 14-year-old daughter or me with my friend and fellow cartoonist Steven Appleby, who happens to be trans but has kept her given first name.\n\nIt’s probably incredibly reckless of me to say so, but I find this very funny. As a satirist, I have always been a fool for anything that points up the even greater folly of our leaders, the tools of their techbro masters or the true capabilities of our new robot overlords. Anyway, I was explaining all this to our soon-to-be daughter-in-law over Christmas when our children (in their 30s, and therefore much tech-savvier than me) explained that it was much more fun than that, and that I should ask: “Who is Martin Rowson’s wife?”\n\nImagine my delight when the first answer from Google search’s AI overview was “Jeanette Winterson”. (To be clear, I swear on the lives of the entire population of Silicon Valley that the famous lesbian author categorically is not my wife.) But it got better – and here comes the sublime beauty of the mesmeric imbecility of the Tool That Will Transform The World. Each time we repeated the question, the answer changed, then changed again. This seemed dependent on how the question was phrased or punctuated, but who knows? Here is the list of my alleged wives I compiled before I finally got bored:\n\nTextile designer Fiona Scott-Wilson.\n\nActor Fiona Marr, she of Bridgerton.\n\nJulia Mills (though it’s unclear whether this is the fantasy author, the illustrator, the late powerlifter or another Julia Mills altogether).\n\nWriter and journalist Emily Rees.\n\nLawyer and academic Siva Thambisetty, who is married to chess grandmaster Jonathan Rowson. AI also claims Jonathan and I are brothers. We’re not.\n\nWriter and journalist Carrie McLaren.\n\nChannel 4 News presenter Cathy Newman.\n\nCNN correspondent Clarissa Ward.\n\nJournalist and broadcaster Rachel Johnson.\n\nThen it got really weird. La femme Rowson, AI said, is actually “journalist and author Kate Clements Rowson”. Googled that name: none the wiser.\n\nThen it suggested I’m married to “writer/illustrator Helen Grant”. Apparently our son, Leo, is a jazz musician. Again, who is she? Nothing on Google. And Leo, who he? Does he really play jazz? Does he exist?\n\nThere was “former Guardian political editor & current CEO of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation Liz Kerr”. Que? There is no Guardian political editor, past or present, of that name. Liz Kerr nowhere appears on the list of the great and good at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. Once again, all wrong. Playwright Lee Hall got a mention. He’s male, so couldn’t be my wife anyway.\n\nAs for “historian and writer Jeanette Winterbottom”. We apparently worked together on “The Guardian Book of Satire” and “The Dog’s Diary”, it says here. Maybe AI confused her with Jeanette Winterson, but then she and I didn’t collaborate on those projects, there is no Guardian Book of Satire, and I have never published a Dog’s Diary (though if someone wants to send me royalties for that, I’d take them).\n\nAnother search, another skipful of gibberish. “He’s been married to writer and journalist Ann Widdecombe (his ex-wife), Cathy Caldwell, and his long-term partner/wife, journalist and author, Polly Toynbee is a frequent figure alongside him in media, suggesting they are a prominent couple in UK literary/journalistic circles.”\n\nFor the record, I have met Rachel Johnson and my own daughter, but am married to neither of them. Again and again the bot failed to identify my real wife, to everyone’s relief, although latterly it’s begun saying: “Her name is not publicly named in the provided search results.”\n\nI suppose this suggests a capacity for learning, but maybe not. I asked “who is my wife?” once more for the purposes of this article, and Google’s AI said I’m married to “Debora Rowson (nee Ffrench)”, a retired civil servant, and ascribed to our wholly fictitious union is my extra daughter, Clementine, yet another writer/journalist. Apparently, I write about our amusing domestic upsets in my imaginary Guardian column.\n\nWhile my mythical marriage to Boris Johnson’s sister is obvious comedy gold (imagine that family Christmas!), for this nonsense to be the fruit of a garlanded, universal research tool used by billions – and for it to be repeatedly, serially wrong – is more than slightly disturbing.\n\nWe should all by now have worked out that AI is about as sentient as an abacus, and only truly mirrors the human mind in its capacity to lie to humans, telling them what it “thinks” they want to hear. It is also a universal truth that the world’s most dangerous people are idiots who think they are really, really clever (just look around and you’ll get the point). Add those two facts together and what on earth do you imagine we will end up with?\n\nI wouldn’t ask AI that, it would probably say “banana bread”, then change its mind to, “Exterminate them all!”\n\nMartin Rowson is a cartoonist and author",

    "description": "Puerto Rican artist Bad Bunny made history with his entirely Spanish set on the sporting world's biggest stage.",
    "fullText": "Bad Bunny's Super Bowl half-time show was one big love letter to his native Puerto Rico.\n\nThe 14-minute set included guest performances from Lady Gaga and Ricky Martin, along with cameos from the likes of Pedro Pascal, Cardi B, Karol G and Jessica Alba, who could be seen dancing on the porch of his famous casita, a staple of his shows designed to look like a traditional Puerto Rican home.\n\nIt was expected that Bad Bunny, real name Benito Antonio Martinez Ocasio, would use his performance as an opportunity to make a political statement against the current US administration, but instead he used it to promote a message of American unity.\n\nTransporting himself through a Latin landscape, with set pieces that included everything from a nail salon to a bar, the Grammy award winner reeled off a medley of his biggest hits, including Tití Me Preguntó, MONACO and BAILE INoLVIDABLE.\n\nThe 31-year-old, who was the world's most-played artist in 2025 according to streaming service Spotify, made history by becoming the first musician to perform a Super Bowl half-time show entirely in Spanish.\n\nBut he did choose to make two statements in English, one with a billboard message reading \"The only thing more powerful than hate is love\" and the other \"Together, We Are America\" written on a football that he held.\n\nHis performance at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California, marked the first time the singer and rapper has performed in the United States since releasing last year's Grammy-award winning album Debí Tirar Más Fotos (I Should Have Taken More Photos).\n\nPuerto Rico, which is a self-governing territory of the USA, was at the heart of everything in this performance, from his early emergence from a sugarcane field to a set that was meant to represent the sounds and sights of the place he calls home.\n\nFamily also featured heavily - from a young couple getting married in a crowd full of Latino dancers to the symbolic moment of Bad Bunny handing his Grammy award to a small child as his 2026 acceptance speech played on a small television.\n\nClimbing an electricity pylon - symbolising the infrastructure that was ruined during the devastating storm - and rapping at the same time, he appeared to pay tribute to the people who died in the 2017 Hurricane Maria.\n\nBad Bunny further spread a message with his outfit - wearing a beige sweater emblazoned with the number 64.\n\nIt could represent the official death toll, which turned out to be significantly lower than the estimated thousands who died.\n\nPresident Trump's administration was criticised at the time by Puerto Ricans who said it failed to provide the same federal support compared to hurricanes that had occurred on the mainland.\n\nThere were no direct criticisms of President Trump, which some saw as a surprise after his two acceptance speeches at last week's Grammy Awards, which he used as an opportunity to speak out against ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) officers.\n\nTheir actions have prompted protests in multiple US cities - most recently in Minneapolis, where federal agents shot and killed two Americans, leading to scrutiny of the administration's tactics.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, who did not attend this year's Super Bowl, said in January that his administration would be \"reviewing everything\" after the fatal shootings of Alex Pretti and Renee Good.\n\nIn his Grammy acceptance speech after his win for best musicá urbana album, Bad Bunny called for \"ICE out\".\n\n\"The hate gets more powerful with more hate. The only thing that's more powerful than hate is love, so, please, we need to be different. If we fight, we have to do it with love.\"\n\nPresident Trump called Bad Bunny's Super Bowl set \"absolutely terrible, one of the worst, EVER!\" on his social media platform Truth Social.\n\nHe added that it was \"an affront to the Greatness of America\".\n\nElements of Bad Bunny's tour set, which has travelled to Central and South America and soon heads to Australia, Japan and Europe, were woven throughout Sunday's performance.\n\nThis included his casita, a house which has gone viral on social media several times for its celebrity guests.\n\nTonight was no different, with Pedro Pascal, Jessica Alba and Cardi B dancing onstage.\n\nOvercoming some early sound issues, the performer leaned heavily on hits from his most recent album, with EoO and DtMF providing some of the high points of the show.\n\nIt was not his first time on the Super Bowl stage - he made a guest appearance with Shakira in 2020 - and he brought confidence as the main star. He swaggered from one corner of the stage to the next all while delivering strong vocals.\n\nLady Gaga was on hand to bring a salsa-inspired rendition of her Bruno Mars collaboration Die With A Smile, and fellow Puerto Rican popstar Ricky Martin sang Lo Que Le Pasó A Hawaii, a song which warns Puerto Ricans to not allow their culture to be erased.\n\nBad Bunny ended his performance by shouting \"God Bless America\" in Spanish and naming multiple North and South American countries, while dancers raised flags in the background, bringing attention to the performer's refusal to bring his world tour in the US, though he did do shows in Puerto Rico.\n\nBad Bunny, who has been producing music since 2013, said in a 2025 interview with i-D that there were \"many reasons\" he would not be performing in the US this time around and \"none of them were out of hate\".\n\nSunday's show represented the best of Latin culture on the sporting world's biggest stage.",

    "description": "Deep inside Earth lies a hidden world of \"intraterrestrials\" that have been dormant for hundreds of thousands of years — what are they waiting to \"wake up\" for?",
    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nBeneath Earth's surface lies a kingdom of undiscovered microscopic life. These \"intraterrestrials\" survive in some of the harshest conditions on the planet — and scientists are hunting for these microbes.\n\nIn this excerpt from \"Intraterrestrials: Discovering the Strangest Life on Earth\" (Princeton University Press, 2025), author Karen G. Lloyd, a microbial biogeochemist at the University of Southern California Dornsife, examines the idea of evolution among life that can survive for hundreds of thousands — if not millions — of years in a dormant state and what it might be waiting for to \"wake up.\"\n\n\"Intraterrestrials\" is short-listed for the Pen/E.O. Wilson Literary Science Writing Award.\n\nHow does one evolve to stop growing for thousands of years? Recent work suggests that microbes buried deep in oceanic seafloor sediments may be doing just that. Such organisms can be referred to as intraterrestrials, small microorganisms living inside Earth's crust all around the globe. To answer this tough evolutionary question, first we have to think about what these organisms would experience in their lifetimes. These slow organisms wouldn't be concerned about the length of a day. They're buried so deep that they can't detect the sun anyway. They probably wouldn't even notice a change in season.\n\nHowever, they might care about other, longer geological rhythms: the opening and closing of oceanic basins through plate tectonics, the formation and subsidence of new island chains, or new fluid flows brought on by slow formation of cracks in Earth's crust. The biology I was taught in school considered these events to be evolutionary drivers for a species, not an individual.\n\nFor instance, Darwin's finches evolved new beak shapes because they had been isolated on an island with a particular shape of seed to eat. This evolution happened over the geological timescale of island formation, but it occurred in a species lineage, not in an individual bird. We know, however, that individuals are also capable of changing along with the rhythms of their environment. An individual Arctic fox's (Vulpes lagopus) fur changes from white to brown when the snow melts every spring. Many people (though sadly, not me) wake up at the same time each morning without the aid of an alarm. Daily and yearly rhythms seem like reasonable things for a person or an animal to keep track of.\n\nIce ages, less so. Anticipating changes over longer timescales seems ridiculous. It would be silly to suggest that an individual finch would have evolved the ability to swim because it had an innate anticipation that its island would subside into the sea in 100,000 years. Or that a beetle in the Gobi Desert could only reproduce when it ate an Amazon rainforest seed because it was born millions of years ago when South America and Africa were nestled into each other, and its DNA instructed it to reproduce when the tectonic gap closed again.\n\nThese scenarios make no sense for animals, but they may be reasonable for the intraterrestrials. An individual that lives for a million years might be evolutionarily predisposed to count on something as slow as island subsidence in the same way that we are evolutionarily predisposed to wait for the sun to rise tomorrow. To fully understand intraterrestrials, we may have to rethink what qualifies as an evolutionary cue.\n\nThe fact that living cells likely exist in a nongrowth state for very long timescales raises two important questions. Can a microbe be adapted to avoid cell division for thousands of years or longer, rather than having it just happen by accident? And, if so, how does evolution work for an organism that seemingly never produces offspring?\n\nLet's tackle that first question by stating it this way, in order to help us place this finding in the context of Darwinian evolution. Are these microbes evolutionarily adapted to hang out in this undead, dormant state for thousands or millions of years, or do they just persist because cells don't need any special adaptations to stay alive for so long?\n\nTo me, living for hundreds of thousands of years seems unlikely to happen without adaptation. Too many physiological changes are required to support this lifestyle for it to be a side effect of a \"normal\" fast-paced life. Furthermore, if this lifestyle is accidental, then their main growth-supporting lives must occur in some other environment. But we rarely see the types of microbes we find in the subseafloor elsewhere. It's not as if they were normal seawater microbes happily swimming around, dividing and growing when they fell to the seafloor and forgot to die.\n\nOn the contrary, most of this highly diverse group of microbes seem to exist only in marine sediments. Given this, they may be just as selected for in marine sediments as parrots are in a rainforest. Indeed, we find that at increasing depths in marine sediments, microbes make enzymes with a higher specificity for the type of substrates that are available in the subsurface, suggesting that they are specially adapted for this environment.\n\nSubsurface microbes also have adaptations that enable ultraslow metabolisms and cell divisions. This suggests that they are somehow evolutionarily poised to be in a long-term nongrowing state. But here we have a problem. According to Darwin's theory of natural selection, these cells must grow and make new progeny to evolve. Natural selection works because, during reproduction, organisms experience mutations. And when an organism has a mutation that is beneficial, the mutation increases the organism's fitness, so the organism's progeny outcompete those of the nonmutated organisms, resulting in more progeny that have the mutation. These further generations continue to do better than the nonmutated lineages, and eventually the mutation spreads throughout the population.\n\nVoilà, adaptation has occurred through natural selection. But how can we even think about Darwinian evolution in populations that don't reproduce? How can you become adapted to not have babies? I don't think Darwin had nongrowth in mind when he described survival of the fittest.\n\nLuckily, we have a good model in short-term seasonal dormancy. Here dormancy during winter has an evolutionary advantage because the dormant organisms have larger populations remaining once conditions are ripe for growth again in the spring. These organisms thus have a head start on other organisms and can pass their dormancy genes along to a larger population of progeny in the spring and summer.\n\nThis is textbook Darwinian natural selection. Let's extend that model to dormancy that lasts for thousands of years in marine sediment. We have to think of an event that intraterrestrials could possibly be waiting for that would pull them out of dormancy when they're buried hundreds of meters deep in Earth's crust. If we encounter a dormant microbe in soil in winter, we can presume that it's waiting to start growing again in summer. What is the equivalent situation for a deeply buried marine sediment organism that is dormant for thousands to millions of years?\n\nLet's do a thought experiment to jailbreak our brains from our implicit assumptions about lifespan. Imagine human lives only lasted about 24 hours. You'd be born at midnight, rebel against your parents at breakfast, settle down and have babies just before lunch, and pick up fishing as a retirement hobby around dinnertime. By midnight, your loved ones, who themselves were only born a few hours ago, would huddle close and hold your hand as you'd pass away peacefully at the ripe old age of a day. If everyone did that, hundreds of human generations would come and go within a single winter. Throughout that time span, which would represent a significant chunk of human history, the deciduous trees would remain brown and lifeless.\n\nThe permanent deadness of trees would be taken as an undisputed fact, and scientists like me would probably write grants to understand whether or not trees are alive, given that they don't seem to grow or make progeny. Of course, if you stretched back far enough, humans would have been present for the fall or even summer, but that might have been so many generations back that a stable form of writing had yet to be invented.\n\nWe 100-year-lifespan humans know that trees are just waiting to take advantage of the summer sun. But the day-lifespan humans would be stumped. When we think about life in the subsurface, are we like day-lifespan humans contemplating a tree? Are long-lived intraterrestrials waiting for wake-up cues we don't recognize because our lives are too short to see them? What is even the point of living for hundreds of thousands of years anyway?\n\nThere must be some reason these intraterrestrials stick around so long. There is evidence that long-term dormancy has a selective advantage. When you let the laboratory workhorse Escherichia coli sit around with no food for months or even years, many of the cells enter a state of long-term dormancy where they are alive and metabolizing, but they're not growing nearly as quickly as they do when you feed them. If you mix these next-to-dead E. coli with a fresh batch of fast-growing E. coli and starve them both, the old geezers beat the living daylights out of the sweet little young 'uns.\n\nThis growth advantage in stationary phase (GASP) may be the secret to why intraterrestrials live so long. Maybe they're waiting for something that only happens thousands of years later so they can be the ones to take advantage of the new situation. They might act as monks, accustomed to deprivation while the gluttons die around them.\n\nSo what are these microbe-monks waiting to wake up for? Seasonal cycles are way too fast. The only things slow enough are geological processes. For instance, island subsidence, floods, drought or storms often occur on hundred- to thousand-year cycles. Submarine landslides, earthquakes, tsunamis and volcanic eruptions might shift materials around on even longer timescales, exposing intraterrestrials to new food sources that coax them out of dormancy after hundreds of thousands of years.\n\nIt seems odd to say that a microbe is adapted to wait for something as infrequent as a volcanic eruption, but Earth's history shows that you can rely on volcanic eruptions, as long as you've got time to wait for them.\n\nIf we really let our imagination run wild, individual microbes might be adapted to events with even longer periods like glacial cycles, which shift every 30,000 years or so. Or the slow movement of tectonic plates. As new seafloor pops up in mid-ocean ridges, the existing seafloor is constantly being pushed away from the middle of the ocean, like a person standing on a moving walkway at an airport. The seafloor eventually jams into a continent in the slowest-motion train wreck ever. Some of the sediments and the intraterrestrials that live in them will get dragged on the subducting plate down to eventually be crushed at temperatures and pressures that kill all life as we know it.\n\nEven for extremophiles, being dragged all the way down to the mantle would definitely be an evolutionary dead end. However, some of the sediments that are in the early stages of being subducted under continental plates might be returned through cracks and fissures that open in the overriding plate. During this collision, some of the seafloor sediments are shoved upward in accretionary prisms and the attendant faults created by earthquakes or other plate deformations.\n\n—Scientists 'reawaken' ancient microbes from permafrost — and discover they start churning out CO2 soon after\n\n—'Black swan' pathogens from ancient permafrost may be getting ready to wake up\n\n—Hidden 'biosphere' of extreme microbes discovered 13 feet below Atacama Desert is deepest found there to date\n\nCould all this piling up, faulting and burbling up to the surface be what the intraterrestrials are waiting for? Let's think through the implications. This would mean that the individual microbial cells that we pull up in our drilling ships that appear to be dormant are just waiting patiently for the ultraslow movement of the plates to squish them into a continent, where they have a chance of resurfacing and recommencing growth.\n\nThe evolutionary payoff for waiting for millions of years in deep marine sediments would be to return to the upper seafloor again where the food is more nutritious, at which point the microbe would pass its genes along to future generations. Like any standard Darwinian natural selection, the individuals that have the best adaptations to being dormant for millions of years would have a growth advantage once they arrive back to the surface, ensuring that those adaptations become stable in the communities.

England must also be praised for not wilting where other England sides have before.\n\nCurran already appeared to have swung the momentum once.\n\nAfter Nepal reached 124-2, his slower ball stopped Dipendra Singh Airee on 44 as the right-hander was caught at deep over. Captain Rohit Paudel was dismissed by Dawson for 39 in the next over.\n\nBut England's experienced bowlers of Archer and Adil Rashid, who conceded 42 from three overs, struggled, leaving Curran to bowl at the last.\n\nHe did not concede a boundary in the final over, mixing his pace and bowling predominately full.\n\nHe was dropped by England before being recalled at the end of last summer but delivered when needed most.\n\nNepal's players completed a lap of honour in front of their deflated supporters at the end.\n\nThough they have been tipped to cause problems at this World Cup, having beaten West Indies over three matches last year and taken South Africa to the final ball at the 2024 World Cup, they have never beaten a major nation on the world stage.\n\nThey were excellent with the ball too - leg-spinner Sandeep Lamichhane the pick with 1-25, including the wicket of Tom Banton lbw for two.\n\nOff-spinner Sher Malla had Phil Salt caught off a top edge with his first ball in international cricket and Airee also took two wickets with his off-spin in a fine all-round performance.\n\nJacob Bethell made an entertaining 55 and Brook a well-placed 53 for England, but Nepal's batting was on a par as they swept and scurried.\n\nOn this evidence, and given they play all four matches in Mumbai, they have a real shot at progressing from this group.\n\nAn almighty scare - but are England learning?\n\nMinnows Nepal fall four runs short of shock win over England - as it happened\n\nMen's T20 World Cup 2026 - results & fixtures\n\nTMS podcast: England survive World Cup scare against Nepal",

    "description": "Why some subtle signs suggest, despite their scare against Nepal in the T20 World Cup, England might be learning under Harry Brook and Brendon McCullum.",
    "fullText": "England have a recent history of hair-raising starts to World Cups.\n\nThey were pummeled by New Zealand in Ahmedabad in 2023 and smashed around by Scotland at the last T20 World Cup until rain intervened.\n\nIn front of thousands of Nepalese fans at the famous Wankhede Stadium - the ground where England have produced statistically their worst 50-over bowling performance in history and suffered their heaviest T20 defeat - they were one boundary from defeat.\n\nThe impact of a loss to Nepal does not bear thinking about for an England team under the most intense pressure.\n\nThey did not do much wrong when their opponents were seemingly charging towards a seismic victory, with Nepal's inspired batting deserving of huge credit.\n\nBut the tightrope coach Brendon McCullum and captain Harry Brook are walking is so precarious after England's Ashes defeat and Brook's Wellington escapades, a defeat here may have sent them tumbling to new depths.\n\nThe walkie talkie McCullum was seen talking into during Nepal's chase could have become the equivalent of Ruben Amorim's tactics board in the rain during Manchester United's embarrassing Carabao Cup loss at fourth-tier Grimsby Town in August.\n\nInstead, it may be a hint at a coach who is able to change.\n\nReducing McCullum's coaching to its most recognisable image - feet up, sunglasses in place, watching motionless from a balcony somewhere in the world - would always be wrong.\n\nCarlo Ancelotti has won more Champions Leagues than Pep Guardiola, no matter how expressive he is or otherwise.\n\nBut McCullum is the coach who has always asked players to rely on instinct.\n\nHe has done most of his work in the background, leaving his players to make the calls in the middle.\n\nHere, he was sending suggestions to his players when the situation squeezed.\n\n\"That's something we've been doing recently - that dressing room to dugout communication,\" said all-rounder Will Jacks afterwards.\n\n\"It is so messages can get run out to the captain or to the guys who are batting in the middle.\n\n\"It's just an easier way of spreading the message.\"\n\nEngland's white-ball outfit appeared too stubborn in their first months under McCullum last year.\n\nWith a bowling attack of Brydon Carse, Jamie Overton, Mark Wood and Jofra Archer, they were thrashed by 150 runs in a T20 on this ground a year ago.\n\nThey arrived in India trying to attack with right-arm express pace and that continued through the Champions Trophy where they did not win a game.\n\nSam Curran will never have the pace of Wood nor the height of Overton, but against Nepal, in defending 10 from the final over, he justified his return from the wilderness.\n\nSome will say England were rescued by the man they discarded. You can also credit them for realising the mistake.\n\nBrook gave a hint at England locating their senses when he spoke to the media on Friday.\n\nHe recalled Liam Dawson - another crucial part of this win with his 2-21 aged 35 - in his first move as captain last year.\n\n\"You look at India's side, and they're one of the best sides to play T20 cricket at the minute, and they've got about five spinners,\" said Brook. \"If they're doing that, why don't we have a little bit of a crack at that as well?\"\n\nHe later backtracked, appearing to be wary of the implications of appearing to imitate India, but would it be so bad if England were?\n\nIt was a diversion from previous messaging of always concentrating on themselves.\n\nBrook would probably tell you it is those conversations - dealing with the media and finding the right words - that is the hardest part of captaincy.\n\nIf it was only about the what goes on a cut strip of 22 yards or the green grass around it, there would be no discussion over his future.\n\nOn the field, he has impressed as a young captain and here, not without frights, he came through his toughest test so far.\n\nEngland have often looked leaderless in the field during their sorry recent run at white-ball tournaments - a spell in which they have given up their T20 and 50-over world titles and exited the Champions Trophy without winning - but at the crunch moment here there was little doubt who was in charge.\n\nHe may not have played under him, but Brook referred to the Eoin Morgan book of captaincy by repeatedly holding the ball at the top of a bowler's mark, giving the heart-rate of his player time to settle.\n\nHe also led the conversation in the drinks break late in Nepal's chase, after which they lost two quick wickets.\n\n\"He was very good at keeping level headed,\" admitted Jacks.\n\n\"Jos [Buttler] spoke as well and those experienced guys are crucial when those pressure situations come around.\"\n\nOf course, the caveat remains that with one swing of the bat, one flash off an edge, the story would all have been different.\n\nNepal were hugely impressive, but are still 16th in the world rankings.\n\nTougher tests will come but England teams have crumbled in pressure moments while carrying far less baggage than this one.\n\nThere are just hints, that they may be learning.",

    "fullText": "Men's T20 World Cup, Group B, Colombo\n\nSri Lanka 163-6 (20 overs): Kusal Mendis 56* (43); Dockrell 2-17\n\nIreland 143 all out (19.5 overs): Tector 40 (34); Theekshana 3-23\n\nIreland could not overcome a host of errors in the field as they fell 20 runs short of Sri Lanka to lose their T20 World Cup opener.\n\nHaving failed to win a game at this tournament two years ago and never beaten Sri Lanka, Ireland got the desired return from their spinners as the co-hosts were restricted to 104-4 through 16 overs.\n\nGeorge Dockrell was the pick of their bowlers and accounted for the wicket of opener Pathum Nissanka for 24 thanks to a fine catch from skipper Paul Stirling.\n\nThe rest of Ireland's work in the field was not nearly as exemplary, however, with five drops, four of them in the final four overs as Sri Lanka tacked on a further 59 runs, making the chase all the tougher.\n\nDespite an apparent hamstring injury, Wanindu Hasaranga accounted for the key wickets of Ross Adair, Harry Tector and Curtis Campher as Ireland were bowled out for 143 in 19.5 overs.\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport\n\nSeifert half-century helps NZ beat Afghanistan\n\nEngland deny Nepal in final-ball World Cup thriller\n\nWith Ireland winning the toss and electing to bowl, it was an early test of how the side's spinners would adjust not only to the conditions but superior opposition\n\nThrough a three-match series with Italy and two against the UAE in their preparations, Heinrich Malan's side eventually settled upon a bowling attack missing the out-of-sorts Josh Little.\n\nA change facilitated by the bowling renaissance of Dockrell, the decision to leave out Ireland's most dangerous quick was vindicated as the spinners stymied Sri Lanka in the middle overs.\n\nDockrell led the way with figures of 2-17, ably assisted by Gareth Delany whose one wicket came at the cost of 24 runs. With Sri Lanka 50-1 after the powerplay, eight consecutive overs of spin held them to just 87-4 as they were frustrated.\n\nHaving hit Barry McCarthy's final delivery of the powerplay for four, the co-hosts would not find another boundary until Kamindu Mendis brought up his side's 100 in the 16th over.\n\nWith Sri Lanka having finally saw the back of Delany and Dockrell, the partnership of Kamindu Mendis and Kusal Mendis were belatedly able to accelerate ahead, although they were helped in no small part by Irish errors in the field.\n\nThere were three drops in the space of four 17th-inning deliveries from Matthew Humphreys, who will feel his figures of 0-44 should come with an asterisk.\n\nWith Sri Lanka powering from 104-4 to 163-6 across the final four overs of their innings, Ireland's target was much tougher.\n\nWhile Ross Adair always felt the most likely to open the batting with Paul Stirling, there was still a decision to be made between the 31-year-old and Tim Tector coming into this tournament.\n\nAfter averaging 14 across the five warm-ups at the top of the order, Ireland's faith in the man who hit a T20 century against South Africa in 2024 again appeared wholly justified when, despite some less than aesthetic moments, he quickly motored to 34 thanks to five fours and a six.\n\nBut, after contributing two of those five drops in Sri Lanka's innings, Adair had another moment to forget when taking a wild heave at the bowling of a hobbling Hasaranga and having his stumps uprooted.\n\nWithout the thump of Adair and Stirling, who was earlier out for six after facing 13 balls, Ireland relied upon the running of Lorcan Tucker and Tector to keep the game in the balance.\n\nThe required run-rate was always on the rise though and, as Ireland tried to find the accelerator, miscues followed in their attempts to find the boundaries.\n\nThings get no easier in Group B with Ireland set to face Australia on Wednesday (09:30 GMT), while Sri Lanka are next in action a day later against Oman (05:30 GMT).",

    "fullText": "Lindsey Vonn's Winter Olympic dream ended in screams of pain on Sunday after she crashed out of the women's downhill, failing in her audacious bid to medal in her favoured discipline at the Milan-Cortina Games.\n\nThe American star had been trying to claim the fourth Olympic medal of her career despite suffering a ruptured anterior cruciate ligament in her left knee just over a week ago, but her race ended after just 13 seconds in Cortina d'Ampezzo.\n\nShe cried in anguish and pain after her awful fall high up the course, medical staff surrounding the distraught 41-year-old on the Olimpia delle Tofane piste where has enjoyed much success in the past.\n\nThe 2010 Olympic downhill champion hit the firm snow face first soon after pushing off from the gate.\n\nShe then rolled down the slope with her skis still attached, which could likely cause further serious damage to her knee.\n\nVonn's Olympic dream now lies in tatters after her brave effort to achieve the seemingly impossible, an attempt which ended with her being taken away in a helicopter as fans in the stands saluted her with loud applause.\n\nHer US teammate Breezy Johnson, sitting in the leader's chair, held her face in shock. At the time Vonn crashed, Johnson, the world downhill champion, was in front of Germany's Emma Aicher by just 0.04sec following her powerful run.\n\nJohan Eliasch, the president of the International Ski Federation (FIS) who was watching the race in Cortina, said Vonn's crash was \"tragic, but it's ski racing I'm afraid\".\n\n\"And I can only say thank you for what she has done for our sport because this race has been the talk of the Games and it's put our sport in the best possible light.\"\n\nEliasch added: \"I hope she will have a speedy recovery and back on skis very, very soon.\n\n\"A lot of people are going to say she shouldn't have been racing today (with) that type of injury. It's obviously her decision.\"\n\nOne of world sport's most recognisable faces and an alpine skiing icon, Vonn has insisted that she could not only compete but win against the world's best women skiers, some of whom like Aicher are nearly half her age.\n\nVonn said ahead of the Games that she was planning on also competing in the team combined event on Tuesday and the super-G two days later.\n\nBut that now looks unlikely, a potential long lay-off perhaps heralding the end of her comeback to skiing in her early 40s.\n\nVonn retired in 2019 but returned to compeition in November 2024 following surgery to partially replace her right knee to end persistent pain.\n\nHad she not crashed in the last World Cup downhill ahead of the Olympics, in Crans Montana at the end of January, Vonn would have been a serious contender for gold in Cortina.\n\nVonn had finished on the podium in every previous World Cup downhill race this season, including two victories in St. Moritz and Zauchensee, and claimed two more top-three finishes in the super-G.\n\nBut retirement looms for Vonn following a disastrous end to one of the biggest stories of the Winter Olympics.",

    "description": "World Cup winner Matt Dawson discusses England's seven-try thrashing of Wales and the lessons coach Steve Borthwick can learn from France.",
    "fullText": "In his latest BBC Sport column, England World Cup winner Matt Dawson discusses England's seven-try thrashing of Wales, Tommy Freeman's performance at centre and the lessons coach Steve Borthwick could learn from his France counterpart.\n\nThere was a time, maybe a couple of years ago, when the England shirt used to weigh heavy on the players.\n\nThe pressure seemed to inhibit them. They were not expressing themselves. Everything was safety-first and a bit meek.\n\nNow, that England shirt seems to make the players double in size. They have embraced this team and this stage and are relishing showing the Allianz Stadium crowd what they are capable of.\n\nThey are enjoying their rugby. And we are enjoying watching them.\n\nPerversely, it is because the mood is so good around the team that coach Steve Borthwick and the players can be so focused on the bits and pieces which went wrong in the 48-7 win over Wales to open their Six Nations campaign.\n\nThere were no cartwheels or laps of honour after the final whistle. The players looked like they were happy with the win but focused on the next task - and aware that they will have to be better when they take on a wounded Scotland in Edinburgh on Saturday.\n\nTommy Freeman is rapidly approaching world-class status.\n\nThe package that he brings to Test rugby - the pace, size, aerial ability and appetite for the ball - is pretty special.\n\nHe was a starter for the British and Irish Lions in all three Tests against Australia in the summer and he is inked into this England team as one of those who will always have a place when fit.\n\nHowever, there is a question over which number Borthwick will write next to Freeman's name.\n\nThis was Freeman's 23rd England appearance but only his third as a centre.\n\nConsidering that relatively paltry midfield experience, he was pretty damn good against Wales.\n\nHe hit superb lines, either hitting the ball up bravely into the heart of Wales defence or acting as a decoy, and worked instinctively with Northampton team-mate Fraser Dingwall inside him at 12.\n\nThey are turning into a dangerous and cohesive pairing - and England have been crying out for a midfield combination with those qualities for ages.\n\nWhere once the supply of centres was quite low, there are now a bunch of alternatives.\n\nOllie Lawrence, who is working his way back from a minor knee injury, may be available for Scotland. Max Ojomoh was very impressive against Argentina in the autumn. Seb Atkinson has credit in the bank from his performances on the summer tour of Argentina.\n\nIt means England can mix and match according to the opposition.\n\nDo they want a punch in midfield or the ability to distribute quickly into wide channels? Gas around the outside or the ability to probe behind with kicks?\n\nThe ability to change tactics with different midfield selection is very, very exciting.\n\nSouth Africa - the gold standard for everyone in world rugby at the moment - have the same.\n\nThe mix of Damian de Allende, Jesse Kriel, Canan Moodie, Damian Willemse and even Andre Esterhuizen gives them different ways of playing.\n\nThat adaptability is a fantastic attribute for any team.\n\nEngland's riot club focus on fine-tuning after walloping Wales\n\nSame old story for sorry Wales in Six Nations\n\nInevitably, Henry Arundell's first-half hat-trick for England caught the eye against Wales, but it will have been the smaller details that most impressed Borthwick.\n\nDefensively, Arundell has been questioned in the past, but he was strong in that area against Wales.\n\nWhen you see him up close, he is strong and solid, as well as fast. He packs 15st 2lb into a 6ft frame and is physical and intimidating in defence. But he is also canny.\n\nHis positioning was good against Wales. He did not step out of shape and get isolated, as he has done previously.\n\nHis six months or so at Bath, under Johann van Graan and defence coach JP Ferreira, have really brought Arundell's game on in that respect.\n\nLate in the game, with England well over the horizon and the win secure, he also came in off his wing, looking for work and holes to exploit with his pace.\n\nThat is another side of his game that is developing. He is no longer only hanging out on the edge, waiting for the ball to come to him.\n\nAfter France and England's dominant first-round performances, the expectation around their final-round meeting in Paris on 14 March has risen another notch.\n\nBut you would be foolish to draw a straight line from this opening weekend to a Grand Slam decider on the final one.\n\nThere are going to be tougher moments for each side before that. The test will be how they react to being under the pump, away from home in tricky conditions. Scotland showed how hard that can be during their defeat by Italy on Saturday.\n\nBorthwick will not be looking too far ahead, but one lesson he can already take from France is the ability to create competitive internal environments.\n\nOpposite number Fabien Galthie shook up his squad selection for the tournament, leaving out established players Damian Penaud, Gael Fickou and Gregory Alldritt. Perhaps they will come back in for later fixtures. Perhaps not.\n\nBut the new faces - and the sense of playing for your place - pushed France to a great performance against Ireland.\n\nBorthwick now has the depth to be as bold in his team selection. That is a wonderful place to be.",

    "description": "The world's fourth-richest man promised to save the Washington Post. Time for him to step up and do it.",
    "fullText": "Will Lewis, the former CEO and publisher of the Washington Post, had a terrible tenure at the paper. The two years he spent there, which ended Saturday with a two-paragraph memo, are chiefly notable for a series of cuts and layoffs, culminating in a 30% bloodletting days ago.\n\nBut let's be clear: This one is on Jeff Bezos.\n\nMost obviously, that's because Bezos owns the Post, and Bezos was the one who hired Lewis to run the business for him.\n\nBezos was also the one signing off on Lewis's actions at the paper, which mostly amounted to making the paper smaller while telling the staff that \"people are not reading your stuff.\"\n\nAnd slightly less obviously, it was Bezos who dramatically worsened the Post's business outlook. He decided not to endorse a presidential candidate in 2024, weeks before the election — a move that outraged many Post readers, who saw the non-endorsement as an attempt to cater to Donald Trump.\n\nThat led to more than 250,000 subscriber cancellations, a huge problem for a paper whose circulation peaked at 3 million in 2021.\n\nThe best case argument you could make for Lewis era at the Post, if you are inclined, would go something like this: Bezos, who bought the Post in 2013 and then invested heavily in staff, realized a few years ago that he now employed many more people than his business would support. So he brought Lewis in to do the grim work of shrinking the publication. Now that work is done, so Lewis can do something else and Bezos can find someone to help the Post grow again.\n\nBut the timing of Lewis' departure — late afternoon on a Saturday, following days of howling from Post employees and many others about Lewis and Bezos' stewardship of the paper — suggests this was not a long-in-the-making move.\n\nAnd again, whether Lewis jumped or was pushed doesn't matter in the end. The Washington Post is Jeff Bezos. He gets praise if things are going well — which, for several years after his purchase, seemed to be the case — and blame when it doesn't.\n\nHere I'll also point out that Bezos, who has no problem being seen jet-setting around the world in a style befitting the world's fourth-richest man, has been totally MIA during his paper's recent turmoil.\n\nOn Saturday, when the paper announced it had promoted Post CFO Jeff D'Onofrio to acting publisher and CEO, Bezos finally attached his name to a public statement, promising that the new Post would thrive by giving readers things they wanted to read.\n\n\"The data tells us what is valuable and where to focus,\" he said in a Post press release.\n\nThat might qualify for an insight 30 years ago, when newspapers were struggling to respond to the internet. Now that's table stakes, and you would hope the guy who created Amazon has more up his sleeve.\n\n\"I have a bunch of ideas,\" for the Post, Bezos said in the fall of 2024. \"I'm working on that right now.\"",

    "description": "By scoring a first-half hat-trick against Wolves on Saturday, Cole Palmer provided a timely reminder of his talent, putting himself firmly in the England conversation.",
    "fullText": "With the World Cup four months away, Cole Palmer provided a timely reminder of his talent on Saturday.\n\nThe Chelsea forward scored a first-half hat-trick as the Blues beat bottom-of-the-table Wolves 3-1 to remain firmly in the hunt for a top-four finish.\n\nTwo of those goals were penalties, with Palmer displaying his typically ice-cool demeanour to send the goalkeeper the wrong way both times.\n\nPalmer has been dogged by a groin injury this season, and the three goals almost doubled his tally for the campaign - going from four Premier League goals to seven.\n\nThe performance also puts him firmly in the England squad conversation.\n\n\"If he's impacting games, like we know he can, from now to the end of the season, he's a sure thing to be in the squad,\" former Liverpool and England midfielder Danny Murphy told BBC Sport.\n\n\"He can play wide, he can play as a 10. He's just so good on the ball and classy and simply doesn't fear anybody.\n\n\"Even if you bring him off the bench, you know he can do unbelievable things. He can win you a game in a heartbeat.\"\n\nPalmer celebrated his opening goal against Wolves by covering his ears - a response, perhaps, to recent reports suggesting he is unsettled in London.\n\nThe former Manchester City player has had a difficult campaign in which injury has seen him in and out of the side, while under new head coach Liam Rosenior he has had his playing minutes carefully managed.\n\nSince Rosenior became Chelsea boss at the start of this year he has often faced questions about Palmer's form, fitness and state of mind.\n\nThis performance provided something of a direct response to those questions, but key for Palmer will be keeping it up.\n\n\"We know what a world-class player he is. He's played a lot of football over the last year with not much rest,\" said Rosenior.\n\n\"When he's at his best, he's unstoppable. I'm delighted to be working with him.\"\n\nThis is, after all, a player who scored twice in the Club World Cup final less than six months ago, and across the two seasons prior to this one totted up 37 Premier League goals.\n\nIf Palmer can now build momentum, he will be hitting form at just the right time.\n\nHe was a key player for England at Euro 2024 but has made just one appearance under current boss Thomas Tuchel - in a 1-0 win against Andorra last June.\n\nInjuries have been a factor, but there is also competition for places - with the likes of Aston Villa's Morgan Rogers and Real Madrid's Jude Bellingham rivalling him for the number 10 role.\n\n\"At the moment it looks like Morgan Rogers and Jude Bellingham will be the two who are ahead of him,\" said former Manchester City defender Nedum Onuoha on BBC Final Score.\n\n\"I'd be looking to find a way to get him in the side.\"\n\nWhen asked if he would select Palmer for England, former Blackburn and Chelsea striker Chris Sutton was a little more blunt: \"Not at the minute, no. I'd play Rogers.\"\n\nEngland have two more friendlies lined up before the World Cup - against Uruguay on 27 March and Japan four days later - so that international camp will offer a big chance for players such as Palmer to impress Tuchel.\n\n\"I don't think Cole [Palmer] is at his best yet,\" said Murphy.\n\n\"Like a lot of players, when you have had a bad injury and you've had quite a lot of time out, it does take game time to get your rhythm and your sharpness back.\n\n\"He really needs to start playing regularly to force his way into the England squad and team, because at the moment with Morgan Rogers doing what he's doing, and other players playing well, he's got a battle on his hands.\"\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "description": "Nick Ball is beaten for the first time in his professional career in front of hometown fans in Liverpool, relinquishing his world title.",
    "fullText": "Nick Ball's reign as WBA featherweight world champion ended in dramatic fashion as the British boxer was stopped in the 12th round by Brandon Figueroa in front of stunned home fans in Liverpool.\n\nAfter 11 closely contested rounds, in which Ball was at times typically bullish on the inside and Figueroa responded with relentless volume, the fight turned in an instant.\n\nSeconds into the final round at M&S Bank Arena, Figueroa landed a flush straight left that sent Ball crashing to the canvas. The 28-year-old beat the count but looked unsteady, and a sharp follow-up combination forced the referee to wave it off.\n\nUgly scenes followed as beer and objects were thrown towards the ring after a brief altercation, with members of Ball's team unhappy about the manner of Figueroa's celebrations while the deposed champion was recovering.\n\n\"I'm sorry [for the celebration], we didn't mean anything, we were just excited. Sorry about that,\" Figueroa said.\n\n\"Big shout out to Nick Ball, he is a great Liverpool champion and one of the best England have ever had. I have nothing but respect for him.\"\n\nIn his fourth defence of the world title, Ball - who left the arena without giving a post-fight interview - suffered the first defeat of his professional career, having previously gone 24 fights unbeaten with one draw.\n\nThe result scuppers his hopes of unification bouts and brings to an end a positive run of results for British boxing on the global stage following Dalton Smith and Josh Kelly's world title triumphs in January.\n\nAmerican Figueroa, meanwhile, becomes a three-weight world champion in his 30th pro bout.\n\nFigueroa stops Ball to claim WBA title from Briton - reaction\n\nFigueroa, 29, lived up to his moniker, 'Heartbreaker', on a deflating and sorrowful night for 'Wrecking' Ball and the Liverpool crowd.\n\nThe challenger was met by a chorus of jeers on his ring walk, the 7,500-capacity arena close to full and firmly partisan. Figueroa blew kisses to his loved ones and stood calmly in his corner as the noise swelled for Ball.\n\nThe Kirkby-born fighter was given a proper hometown reception. From John Conteh to Natasha Jonas, Liverpool has never been shy of producing world champions, and Ball is the latest to have carried on that proud tradition.\n\nThe contest began at a frantic pace. Ball threw 145 punches across the opening three rounds - including sharp uppercuts in the first and second – with Figueroa throwing 204 times.\n\nAt just 5ft 2in, Ball conceded seven inches in height but dismissed the idea that was a disadvantage beforehand, insisting he preferred \"punching up\" at taller opponents.\n\nAs blood trickled from the champion's nose and reddened his mouth, Figueroa continued to press and appeared the fresher man at the halfway mark.\n\nBall responded with a blistering flurry in the eighth. Figueroa winced, smiled and fired back to the body. With some tight rounds, the fight felt finely poised and destined to go to the scorecards.\n\n\"Championship rounds. This is your territory now,\" Ball's corner told him.\n\nThere was nervousness in the arena, but nobody predicted such an abrupt ending.\n\nWith Ball scrambling on the floor after the initial left, he admirably rose on the count of nine.\n\nBut Figueroa sensed the finish and unloaded - a left-right-left combination completing the job for the Texan.\n\nDuring the melee that followed the stoppage, Andrew Cain, a member of Ball's team who won his own fight on the undercard, appeared to aim a kick at one of Figueroa's cornerman.\n\nTensions were calmed quickly, and scorecards revealed the knockout was the icing on the cake for Figueroa, who was ahead of two of the three scorecards at the time of the stoppage.\n\nBall has come a long way since making his professional debut in a Liverpool nightclub and had won four fights in a row since his controversial split draw with Rey Vargas in March 2024.\n\nOf all reigning male world champions from Britain, he was the only one to have defended his title.\n\nBut that run has come to an end in the most disappointing fashion.\n\nBall's fan-friendly style had made him one of the country's most watchable fighters, with unification bouts and big-name opponents on the horizon.\n\nA potential super-fight with Japan's pound-for-pound star Naoya Inoue, the undisputed super-bantamweight champion, had also been on Ball's wishlist.\n\nInstead, Ball ran into an inspired Figueroa and must now process both the first defeat of his career and the loss of his world title.\n\nHow he responds - physically and mentally - will shape the next chapter, and overcoming this setback may prove a defining test of his character.\n\nBruce Carrington (WBC), Angelo Leo (IBF) and Rafael Espinoza (WBO) hold the other world titles in the division, but would any of them be eager to step in with Ball when he has no world title to offer?\n\nBall could seek a rematch with Figueroa, although the American might be reluctant to take that option after his knockout win.\n\nBoxing schedule and results 2026\n\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "fullText": "SINGAPORE, Singapore (AP) — This week’s Singapore Air Show brought together trade delegations from around the world to show off the latest in civilian and military aviation technology.\n\nThe event this year marked the 10th edition of the air show, which showcased cutting-edge planes from the Royal Australian Air Force and the United States Air Force. This included the F-35 Lightning II, the latest U.S.-made fifth-generation fighter jet that has integrated stealth technology and is considered one of the world’s most advanced combat aircraft.\n\nMajor commercial plane makers also touted the latest advancements in their fleets, including Airbus, Bombardier, Gulfstream, Boeing and China’s Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China, known as COMAC.\n\n“We have a very good representation of the latest and the greatest,” said Leck Chet Lam, managing director of Experia Events, which organizes the event. “The Singapore Air Show, the unique part of it is we cover both the aviation and also the defense industries.”\n\nDuring the Singapore Air Show's aerial displays, COMAC promoted its C919 passenger jet, which China is pushing as an alternative to the European Airbus A320neo and the American Boeing 737 MAX. The daily aerial displays at the event also showcased six military teams and Airbus’ A350-1000.\n\nWithin the exhibition hall, the air show featured experimental air taxis, advanced flight simulators, a wide variety of drones and both manned and unmanned helicopters. The static aircraft display under Singapore’s sizzling sun included roughly 35 planes from more than 10 countries.\n\nIn all, more than 1,000 companies from around 50 countries participated in the air show, hosted on the grounds of Changi International Airport, Southeast Asia's busiest airport. The event, which opened on Feb. 3, is considered Asia’s largest aerospace and defense exhibition and runs through Feb. 8.\n\n“All the exhibitors can use Singapore as a springboard to then tap into the opportunities that are rising in the Asia-Pacific market, which is a key driver that is driving the growth of the global aviation industry,\" Lam said.\n\nThis is a photo gallery curated by AP photo editors.",

    "fullText": "India captain Suryakumar Yadav led ‌by example as the tournament co-hosts began their Twenty20 World Cup title defence with a 29-run victory against the United States in a group A contest on Saturday.\n\nIndia recovered from a dire 77-6 to post a decent 161-9 with Suryakumar hitting a scintillating 84 not out off 49 balls.\n\nThe US managed 132-8 in reply, putting up a decent fight but never really coming ⁠close to chasing down the target.\n\nEarlier, the predominantly Indian fans at the Wankhede Stadium probably expected sixes and fours to rain down after US captain Monank Patel elected to field.\n\nInstead, it was a long procession of India’s top-order batters returning to the pavilion after a spectacular meltdown of the world’s top-ranked T20 team.\n\nOpener Abhishek Sharma, currently the world’s number one T20 batter, fell for a first-ball duck in perhaps an inkling of what was in ⁠store for the home side.\n\nThe real nightmare unfolded in the final Powerplay over when Shadley van Schalkwyk claimed three wickets in five deliveries to leave India reeling on 46-4.\n\nIshan Kishan (20) and Tilak Varma (25) could not convert their starts, while Shivam Dube departed with a golden duck against his name in that eventful over from van Schalkwyk.\n\nIt could easily have been worse, but bowler Shubham Ranjane could not hold onto a return catch from Suryakumar when the batter was on 15.\n\nWickets kept tumbling at the other end though.\n\nRinku Singh, Hardik Pandya and ‌Axar Patel perished trying to swing their way out of trouble.\n\nSuryakumar responded to the crisis with a captain’s knock as he raced to a 36-ball fifty before plundering 21 runs from the final over from Saurabh Netravalkar.\n\nIndia’s pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah missed ‌the match due to illness, and they were also forced into replacing Harshit Rana, who was ruled out of the tournament barely 24 hours before ‌their opening match with a thigh injury.\n\nMohammed Siraj (3-29) vindicated his last-minute ⁠inclusion as Rana’s replacement with a two-wicket burst, while Arshdeep Singh also tasted success as they reduced the US to 31-3 in the six Powerplay overs.\n\nSanjay Krishnamurthi (37) and Milind Kumar (34) defied India for a while with a 58-run stand, but once the partnership ‌ended, India were firmly in charge.\n\nIn Colombo, the Netherlands nearly pulled off a major upset before Faheem Ashraf’s breezy cameo secured Pakistan’s nervy three-wicket win with three balls to spare in another group A contest.\n\nIn a group C match in Kolkata, West Indies fast bowler Romario Shepherd claimed four wickets in five balls, including a hat-trick, as the twice champions thumped Scotland by 35 runs.",

    "description": "A global boycott may be the only nonviolent way to curb US aggression and repression.",
    "fullText": "Professorial Lecturer at American University in Washington, DC.\n\nUnder President Donald Trump’s leadership, the United States has, over the past year, consistently violated international norms and laws. The rollercoaster of tariff barriers, the sham negotiations between Russia and Ukraine, and the declaration of a false “ceasefire” with Israel, all while openly musing about turning Gaza into “oceanfront property”, would have been bad enough on their own.\n\nBut in just the past couple of months, the US has bombed Nigeria to “defend” Christians, invaded Venezuela and arrested its president, Nicolás Maduro, after months of blowing up Venezuelan boats in international waters, and openly threatened Iran, Greenland, and Mexico with military intervention.\n\nWithin the US, Trump’s ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) has continued to carry out extralegal harm in the process of fulfilling his promise of mass deportations. Since the start of 2026, federal immigration officers have shot and killed at least three US citizens: 43-year-old Keith Porter Jr. in California, and 37-year-olds Renée Nicole Good and Alex Pretti in Minnesota. Both Good and Pretti were killed on camera, in incidents recorded from multiple angles, intensifying public outrage over the expanding use of lethal force by federal immigration agencies.\n\nIf this were almost any other country, like Iran, with its repressive and indiscriminate killing of thousands of protesters over the past month, the Western-led international community would already be calling for sanctions and embargoes against the US. But in light of US threats and actions at home and abroad, the world now needs to take a page from the late Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s leadership in the early years of the Civil Rights Movement. The world needs to boycott and divest from US corporations, US-made products, and US-led events.\n\nShort of civil strife, civil war, or military action, there is no other way for the world to disrupt US aggression except through massive economic pressure. While on a considerably smaller scale, King and so many other Black people in the 1950s understood that hitting the wallets of those who had long benefited from Black labour and pain could be effective in the US. It was one of the few tools available in their struggle against the daily onslaught of violent racist segregation.\n\nThe 381-day Montgomery Bus Boycott in Alabama was a response to decades of segregated public transport, not simply to Rosa Parks refusing to give up a “whites-only” seat at the front of a bus on December 1, 1955. During the year-long protest, some 40,000 Black Montgomery residents either carpooled or walked to school, work, church, and elsewhere. Defending the boycott, King said, “We came to see that, in the long run, it is more honourable to walk in dignity than ride in humiliation.”\n\nWhite Montgomery residents responded with mass arrests, threats, and other acts of intimidation, including the bombing of King’s home on January 30, 1956. A month after the US Supreme Court affirmed Browder v. Gayle, the decision outlawing segregation on public transportation, with the now-deceased activist Claudette Colvin among the plaintiffs, Montgomery formally ended its bus segregation policies on December 17, 1956, though white residents continued to harass, attack, and even lynch Black bus riders and civil rights activists for years afterwards. “Our aim has never been to put the bus company out of business, but rather to put justice in business,” King said.\n\nPutting “justice in business” in the case of the US will require a global effort. The world should build on the Palestinian-led BDS (Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions) movement against Israel and apply those lessons to the US. BDS was launched in July 2005 with the support of 170 Palestinian organisations as a nonviolent effort to apply economic and cultural pressure on Israel to end its apartheid rule over Gaza and the West Bank. BDS founders Omar Barghouti and the late Ingrid Jaradat Gassner drew inspiration from the global anti-apartheid boycotts, divestments, and sanctions against South Africa in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nBDS has three objectives in its two-decade-long push against Israeli oppression and systematic genocide: “ending [Israel’s] occupation and colonisation of all Arab lands and dismantling the Wall; recognising the fundamental rights of Arab-Palestinian citizens of Israel to full equality; and respecting, protecting, and promoting the rights of Palestinian refugees to return to their homes and properties, as stipulated in UN Resolution 194.”\n\nIt is true that powerful lobbies and other Western supporters of Zionism have labelled BDS “anti-Semitic”. But it is also true that those opposed to social justice will go to great lengths to discredit and destroy movements that challenge their power. Over the years, BDS has helped raise global awareness of the everyday, systemic destruction of Palestine and the lives of Palestinians living under Israel’s apartheid and occupation. The movement is also likely a key reason why the ongoing genocide in Gaza never garnered broad international support or sustained backing among ordinary Americans.\n\nAs for a global boycott movement against US oppression and aggression, some have already begun calling for a boycott of the 2026 FIFA Men’s World Cup this summer, with most scheduled matches set to take place in stadiums across the US. Social media posts urging people to cancel World Cup tickets and travel plans to the US, and to sanction its athletes and businesses, have gone viral in the aftermath of ICE agent Jonathan Ross’s gunning down of Renée Nicole Good on January 7. Given the increase in xenophobic, queerphobic, and racist civil strife and persecution at home and abroad, a backlash against US tourism now looms as the world approaches the June dates for the tournament’s matches.\n\nBut the stakes for the US and the world at this moment are high, and boycotting the globe’s largest sporting event, though significant, is hardly enough to pressure an increasingly belligerent and autocratic regime. Boycotting and divesting from US businesses that support the oppression of marginalised people, especially companies such as Google, Amazon, and Palantir, with their surveillance investments in Israel, would be one place to start. Disinvesting from US-based media monopolies, whether News Corp, The Washington Post, or Paramount Global, would go a long way towards loosening the stranglehold US monopolies exert over Western media. Boycotting the America250 celebrations scheduled for July, the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, and annual US-based international cultural events such as Coachella and the Met Gala would also exert pressure.\n\nBoycotting high-profile US supporters of oppression and militarism, whether Trump, Bari Weiss, or Elon Musk, would draw further attention. If the world wants the US to do better by its own people and to act as a better nation-state on the global stage, it must act collectively to boycott and divest from US influence.\n\nIt was not all that long ago that the old Soviet Union regularly labelled Americans as “capitalist pigs” or “imperialist pigs”. Such Cold War propaganda was accompanied by films portraying the once self-proclaimed “leader of the free world” as a society riven by racist civil strife and violent repression against those who challenged injustice.\n\nYears after King gave his first public address galvanising the Montgomery Bus Boycott, where he described the “weapon of protest” as “the glory of America, with all of its faults”, he came to understand that much of what had been dismissed as Soviet propaganda was, in fact, bedrock reality. “The evils of capitalism are as real as the evils of militarism and racism. The problems of racial injustice and economic injustice cannot be solved without a radical redistribution of political and economic power,” King said in 1967. This is something the world needs to remind the US of in 2026.\n\nThe views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.",

    "description": "Ireland have a string of disappointing T20 World Cups behind them and will need to repeat their giant-killings of the past to buck the trend in Sri Lanka and India.",
    "fullText": "Whether it be the unforgettable St. Patrick's Day against Pakistan in 2007, or Kevin O'Brien thumping a rapid century to beat England four years later, Ireland's history at World Cups is one built upon giant killings.\n\nBut if those historic days, and a few more besides against the likes of West Indies, Zimbabwe and Bangladesh, all helped to create a reputation for over-performance at global showpieces, it has been a contrasting story at T20 World Cups.\n\nIndeed, as Ireland prepare to start their 2026 campaign against co-hosts Sri Lanka on Sunday, the presence of Oman in their group is a reminder that in the shorter format, the shoe has more often been on the other foot.\n\nIt was 10 years ago in India that defeat by the tournament debutants first up sent Ireland on their way to one of their six early exits from eight attempts, while it was the same old story in the USA last time around when a 12-run loss to Canada, with an assist from the weather, did the damage.\n\nWith Australia to follow Sri Lanka this time around, before facing Oman and then Zimbabwe in Pool B, if Heinrich Malan's side are to reverse the trend in the coming 10 days, they must ensure they are again the ones administering the shocks rather than finding themselves on the receiving end.\n\nSaturday, 8 February 2026, 13:30 GMT\n\nLive ball-by-ball commentary on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra, BBC Sounds and the BBC Sport website and app, plus live text with in-play clips.\n\nWhile Ireland lost three of their six scheduled T20s to the weather during a wholly frustrating home summer in 2025, in the months since they have at least had the benefit of regular cricket.\n\nHarry Tector and Matthew Humphreys led the way for an encouraging T20 win over Bangladesh in November before consecutive losses to surrender the series gave the impression of a side who had run out of steam at the end of the multi-format tour.\n\nA 2-1 series win over Italy followed by a two-game whitewash of the UAE have formed the bulk of preparations for the World Cup, but a final tune-up against Pakistan on Wednesday fell victim to the rain, robbing the side of the chance to step up against the sort of superior opposition they will face in their first two games in Sri Lanka.\n\nAcross the five warm-up games in Dubai, there is the sense that the side have chanced upon their optimum line-up for the conditions in Sri Lanka, although perhaps the solution involved the loss of form one of their leading lights.\n\nTector and Humphreys continue to lead the way with bat and ball respectively, with the former averaging 43 across his past eight T20 internationals to form a strong middle-order with wicket-keeper Lorcan Tucker.\n\nRoss Adair, who still has Ireland's most recent T20 century to his name thanks to his knock against South Africa in 2024, appears to have held off the challenge of the younger Tector brother, Tim, to open alongside captain Paul Stirling.\n\nDespite the skipper averaging 20 across the 16 T20s Ireland have played since the last World Cup, the 35-year-old remains the side's best player against the spin bowling they are sure to face in Sri Lankan conditions.\n\nThe bowling resurgence of veteran all-rounder George Dockrell - who took four wickets for 53 runs from 13 overs in the warm-ups - allows for the lengthening of the batting line-up where 23-year-old Ben Calitz will be relied upon to provide some left-handed thump.\n\nIt is all, however, expected to be at the expense of a genuine quick. An out-of-sorts Josh Little did not feature in either match against the UAE after not managing a wicket in two games against both Bangladesh and Italy with an economy rate ranging between 9.50 and 13.50.\n\nThe player who took a memorable T20 World Cup hat-trick against New Zealand in 2022, and indeed had figures of 4-23 against Sunday's opposition a year prior, looks likely to start the tournament outside the starting XI.\n\nWith Mark Adair, Ireland's leading T20 wicket-taker there to shoulder the load in terms of seam, it means Malan's selection can all, in one way or another, take some confidence from their preparations.\n\nWhether that transfers to facing the likes of Sri Lanka and Australia, however, will be the determining factor in Ireland's efforts.\n\nAustralia's Hazlewood ruled out of T20 World Cup\n\nScotland beaten by West Indies in T20 World Cup opener\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

Bowler Shubham Ranjane, one of five India-born players in USA's XI, was the guilty party low in his follow-through.\n\nThe India captain punished the miss with a brilliant 84 not out from 49 balls, countering the situation perfectly by starting slowly before unfurling thrilling scoops and flicks to drag the hosts to 161-9.\n\nThat denied the underdogs any momentum and India seamers Arshdeep Singh and Mohammed Siraj took three wickets in the first four overs of the chase to reduce the US to 13-3.\n\nAs the required run-rate climbed, the expectant locals grew more comfortable and the US scrapped to 132-8 in their 20 overs without ever threatening to complete the chase.\n\nIt means, after an entertaining opening day in which the Netherlands were a dropped catch away from stunning Pakistan and Scotland threatened West Indies, India set the early pace at the top of Group A as expected in this World Cup.\n\nEngland enter the tournament on Sunday with a fixture against Nepal at 09:30 GMT. Ireland play Sri Lanka in Colombo at 13:30.\n\nT20 World Cup: India seal opening-day win over USA - reaction\n\nIndia's margin of victory was, in the end, comfortable.\n\nMake no mistake, however. The upset, which would have topped USA's super over win over Pakistan at the last T20 World Cup, was on at one stage.\n\nThe home crowd was quiet and in the 13th over Suryakumar and Axar Patel were at the crease with only three tailenders remaining.\n\nThe US, who have not played a T20 since April amid governance issues and are ranked 18th in the world, bowled superbly.\n\nIndia opener Abhishek Sharma, many people's tip for player of the tournament, slashed his first ball to deep cover and when South Africa-born seamer Shadley van Schalkwyk mixed his pace to take three wickets in the sixth over, including Tilak Verma and Shivam Dube in consecutive deliveries, the hosts were 46-4.\n\nSuryakumar - known by his nickname SKY - defended Van Schalkwyk's hat-trick ball and took only five runs from his first 10 deliveries and 20 from his first 21.\n\nHis team-mates all struggled to time the ball but he took time to feel comfortable, putting on 41 with Axar.\n\nMaking the most of the reprieve by Ranjane, Suryakumar was playing trademark sweeps off seamers for six and tumbling scoops by the end with the US hurt by the loss of Ali Khan to injury with two of his overs unbowled.\n\nIndia's captain took 20 runs from the last over, meaning he ended the innings with 10 runs more than the 74 his team-mates managed combined.\n\nIt was a spectacular and much-needed knock.\n\nT20 World Cup: India seal opening-day win over USA - reaction\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

Their list of tricky talking points just got a new addition — the so-called SaaSpocalypse.At the IPEM Wealth conference that kicked off in Cannes this week, a market meltdown linked to fears over artificial intelligence’s impact was an uncomfortable backdrop as a selloff ripped through a raft of software stocks.

    "title": "Backlift like Brian Lara, world champion at 14: The rise and rise of unconventional Vaibhav Sooryavanshi",
    "description": "Still two-years younger than what Sachin Tendulkar's age was at the time of his India debut, he has a bat-swing that reminds of Brian Charles Lara, Harmanpreet Kaur, and Yuvraj Singh, and like footballer Lamine Yamal, who has emerged as a teenage sensation at the highest level, Sooryavanshi’s age has rarely matched the stage he performs on.",
    "fullText": "Conventional wisdom suggests that a 13-year-old would struggle to even face deliveries bowled at speeds above 90 mph. Vaibhav Sooryavanshi has challenged that assumption by striking bowlers such as Mohammed Siraj, Prasidh Krishna and Jofra Archer to all parts of the ground.\n\nIn traditional cricket coaching, batters are taught to keep their hands close to the body during the backlift to maintain control over the bat swing. Sooryavanshi differs here as well. His backlift moves away from the body, going against what is often described as textbook technique.\n\nStill two-years younger than what Sachin Tendulkar's age was at the time of his India debut, he has a bat-swing that reminds of Brian Charles Lara, Harmanpreet Kaur, and Yuvraj Singh; and like footballer Lamine Yamal, who has emerged as a teenage sensation at the highest level, Sooryavanshi’s age has rarely matched the stage and level he performs on.\n\nTalent could never be the question with Vaibhav Sooryavanshi. It never was. With the 80-ball 175 knock against England in the Under-19 World Cup final on Friday, he also put to rest any talks of temperament too, with delivering on the biggest of stages.\n\nSooryavanshi produced what can be counted among the most dominant innings in Under-19 World Cup history. His 175, which included 15 sixes, helped India post 411 for 9 against England in the final at Harare.\n\nEngland, under pressure after Sooryavanshi’s innings, were bowled out for 311 in 40.2 overs while chasing a target of 412 against India’s bowling attack.\n\nThe 14-year-old reached his century in 55 balls, becoming the second-fastest centurion in the history of the Under-19 World Cup.\n\nHis innings is the highest individual score in an Under-19 World Cup final and came in the match that also produced the highest team total in a final of the tournament.\n\nSooryavanshi reached his first fifty in 32 balls and continued at the same pace against the England bowlers. His second fifty came off 23 balls.\n\nOut of his 175 runs, 150 came through boundaries, with 15 sixes and an equal number of fours. During this phase, India’s scoring rate stayed close to 10 runs an over, and the projected total crossed 500 midway through the innings.\n\nHe now holds the record for most sixes in a Youth ODI innings, surpassing his own mark of 14 sixes against UAE at ICCA Dubai in December.\n\nSooryavanshi also owns the record for the fastest 150 in Under-19 cricket, reaching the mark in 71 balls. The previous record was held by England’s Ben Mayes, who took 98 balls against Scotland at the same venue earlier in the tournament.\n\nVedant Trivedi, batting at the other end, faced only four deliveries between Sooryavanshi’s 100 and 150, underlining the speed at which the runs were scored.\n\nSooryavanshi first came into wider attention in November 2024 when he became the youngest player to receive an IPL contract after Rajasthan Royals signed him for Rs 1.10 crore. He was 13 years and 243 days old at the time. By then, he had already represented India Under-19 and scored a century as an opener against Australia Under-19 in a four-day match in Chennai.\n\nOne of the early highlights of his career was the 58-ball century against Australia Under-19, where he scored 104. At 13 years and 187 days, he became the youngest player to score a century in youth cricket, breaking the previous record held by Bangladesh captain Najmul Hossain Shanto.\n\nIn the following months, Sooryavanshi continued to add records. On April 19, 2025, he made his IPL debut for Rajasthan Royals against Lucknow Super Giants, hitting Shardul Thakur for a six over extra cover off his first ball. He scored 34 off 20 balls in that match.\n\nIn his third IPL appearance, he scored a 35-ball century against Gujarat Titans, whose bowling attack included Mohammed Siraj, Ishant Sharma and Rashid Khan. The hundred was the second-fastest in IPL history, behind only Chris Gayle’s 30-ball century in 2013.\n\nIn July 2025, Sooryavanshi recorded the fastest Youth ODI century at the time, reaching the milestone in 52 balls. That record was later broken by Pakistan’s Sameer Minhas, who scored a century off 42 balls against Zimbabwe Under-19.\n\nHe was named Bihar’s vice-captain for the first two rounds of the 2025–26 Ranji Trophy season in October. The decision followed his performances on India Under-19's tour of Australia, where he provided quick starts and scored a 78-ball century in the first four-day match in Brisbane. He finished as the second-highest run-scorer of the series, with 133 runs in three innings as India won 2-0.\n\nIn November 2025, Sooryavanshi scored 144 off 42 balls for India A against UAE in the Asia Cup Rising Stars. His century came off 32 balls and was then the joint-third fastest by an Indian in men’s T20 cricket.\n\nA few weeks later, he scored 171 off 95 balls against UAE Under-19 in the opening match of the Under-19 Asia Cup.\n\nAt 14 years and 272 days, Sooryavanshi became the youngest player to score a century in men’s List A cricket. He achieved the feat while playing for Bihar against Arunachal Pradesh in the 2025–26 Vijay Hazare Trophy. He reached his century in 36 balls, later scoring the fastest 150 in men’s List A cricket off 59 balls. He was dismissed for 190 off 84 balls, which included 16 fours and 15 sixes.\n\nSooryavanshi scored 439 runs and took 1 wicket in the Under-19 World Cup and was named Player of the Tournament after India won their sixth Under-19 World Cup title on Friday.\n\n\"I had faith in my skills that I can contribute in big games and today it happened,\" Sooryavanshi said at the post-match presentation.\n\nAt 14, Sooryavanshi is already a world champion. He has delivered on most opportunities given to him so far. But he's still a kid. It's important to give him space and not put too many expectations on him. Leave him freely and watch him take the cricketing world by storm.",

Netherlands are a good side, but we want to execute our plans.”\n\nThe Netherlands has a history of surprising stronger opposition in T20 World Cups, including beating South Africa in 2022 in Australia which cleared the way for Pakistan to qualify for the semifinals.\n\nCaptain Scott Edwards said his team had got used to the conditions after spending more than a month in India and Sri Lanka.\n\n“For us, it’s a big game, so are the other three,” Edwards said.\n\nIn the two other games on Saturday, Scotland, which replaced Bangladesh in Group C, will meet two-time champion West Indies in Kolkata while co-host and defending champion India plays against the U.S. at Mumbai in a Group A match.\n\nNetherlands: Michael Levitt, Max O’Dowd, Bas de Leede, Colin Ackermann, Scott Edwards (captain), Zach Lion-Cachet, Logan van Beek, Roelof van der Merwe, Aryan Dutt, Kyle Klein, Paul van Meekeren.\n\nPakistan: Saim Ayub, Sahibzada Farhan, Salman Ali Agha (captain), Babar Azam, Usman Khan, Shadab Khan, Mohammad Nawaz, Faheem Ashraf, Shaheen Shah Afridi, Salman Mirza, Abrar Ahmed.\n\nAP cricket: https://apnews.com/hub/cricket",

    "title": "Italians embrace unity — except with JD Vance — during Olympics opening ceremony",
    "description": "Italy welcomed the world with a snow-capped spectacle during the opening ceremony of the Milan-Cortina Olympics, pushing past pre-Games tension.",
    "fullText": "Spread across more than 265 miles in four different cities from the snowy Dolomites to the sunny — for now — streets of Milan, the Milan-Cortina Olympics delivered one message.\n\nThe most widespread Olympic Games in history showcased Italy’s idyllic snow-capped mountains, cutting-edge city life and celebrated winter legacy in the opening ceremony of the Milan-Cortina Games on Friday. The unique setup that required four ceremonies in Milan, Livigno, Predazzo and Cortina d'Ampezzo used movie magic on video screens, a golden ring and Italian icon Andrea Bocelli to bridge the distance between host cities Milan and Cortina and unite the Olympics behind the athletes who will compete across seven sports zones in the next 16 days.\n\n“Let these Games be a celebration of what unites us, of everything that makes us human,” International Olympic Committee president Kirsty Coventry said in her speech, her first at an Olympic Games under her leadership. “This is the magic of the Olympic Games: inspiring us all to be the best that we can be — together.”\n\nThe theme for Milan-Cortina’s opening ceremony was armonia, or harmony. The Games needed it.\n\nThese Olympics appear to be the most disconnected ever. The sprawling footprint covers seven different competition zones. The 2026 Games are the first to be officially hosted by two cities.\n\nBut the geographical distance is small compared to the geopolitical canyon the Games hope to bridge.\n\nThe ongoing war in Ukraine is keeping most Russian athletes out of the competition. Only 32 athletes with Russian or Belarusian passports were allowed and will have to compete as individual neutral athletes. They will not hear their national anthems or wear their national flags. Ukrainian athletes marched into San Siro Stadium — where athletes competing in ice sports participated in the opening ceremony — to loud cheers.\n\nWhen talk of protest or political conflict arose this week, Coventry tried to downplay it to keep the focus on the Games. She called controversy about LA28 chairman Casey Wasserman and ICE agents in Milan \"sad\" distractions. The United States was at the center of much of the contention after reports concerning the presence of U.S. immigration agents in Milan prompted anti-ICE protests. The U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee tried to cool tensions by clarifying that the organization does work with the federal government to help secure the Games, but the USOPC works with the Diplomatic Security Service, which falls under the jurisdiction of the State Department and not Homeland Security, which oversees ICE.\n\nPresident Trump’s recent comments about the United States taking control of Greenland from Denmark also angered European allies.\n\nOn Friday, an American fan walked around the concourse at San Siro Stadium in a sweatshirt that read in multiple languages: “Sorry for our president.”\n\nWhen Vice President JD Vance, sitting in the presidential suite, was shown on the video screen at San Siro, the cheers that showered U.S. athletes when they entered the stadium turned into jeers. Vance attended multiple events this week, including the U.S. women’s hockey’s group stage opener Thursday and the team figure skating competition Friday.\n\nThe 323-athlete U.S. delegation led by flag bearers speedskater Erin Jackson in Milan and bobsled athlete Frank Del Duca in Cortina was the largest in the nation's Winter Olympics history and the largest of any country at the Milan-Cortina Games.\n\nAthletes marched into Milan’s San Siro Stadium, the home of AC Milan and Inter Milan, across a spiral-shaped stage. The four ramps converging into a circle represented the connection between Milan, Livigno, Predazzo and Cortina.\n\nEven if athletes of a country were not competing in Milan and were unable to attend the opening ceremony, a sign-holding volunteer dressed in a silver floor-length puffer dress strutted across the stage while screens showed athletes marching in during ceremonies at other Olympic locations around Italy.\n\nIn Cortina, a Brazilian athlete did a backflip after talking through a golden ring portal, a shared symbol at each ceremony. While Olympians in Milan walked into a packed stadium with flashing lights and thumping techno music played by a DJ at a turntable that looked like ice, the mountain ceremonies took place through the streets. Fans assembled on either side of the walkway for the parade of athletes.\n\nThe ceremony hit on the quintessential northern Italian experience. A plate of risotto was among the first images shown on the video board in the countdown video as the ceremony approached, followed by the picturesque snowy peaks of the Dolomites. As a fashion capital of the world, Milan used runway models dressed in green, white and red outfits designed by Giorgia Armani to represent the Italian flag. There was even a two-minute video on Italian hand gestures.\n\nItaly, as the host nation, marched in last to deafening applause and cheers from the crowd in Milan. In about two years, the United States will have the honor of closing the parade of athletes when L.A. hosts the 2028 Summer Games. The opening ceremony is also planned to take place in multiple locations, with the Coliseum and SoFi Stadium co-hosting the event.\n\nTo unite the Italian host cities, the Olympic flame was passed out of the stadium as Bocelli belted and the torch simultaneously reached two cauldrons. In Milan, the pulsating cauldron inspired by the sun will burn at Arco della Pace. In Cortina, it will light up Piazza Angelo Dibona.\n\nGet the best, most interesting and strangest stories of the day from the L.A. sports scene and beyond from our newsletter The Sports Report.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

Well, we know he helped with his dad’s campaign, and now he’s fully stepping into the business role his dad has held.\n\nIn case you missed it, Barron just became a partner in a new beverage company called Sollos Yerba Mate Inc.

    "title": "US accuses China of breaking rules on nuclear weapons by hiding explosions and preparing for more testing",
    "description": "The US accused China of secret nuclear tests, banned under international agreement, that were building toward tests of larger nuclear warheads.",
    "fullText": "The US accused China of secret nuclear explosive testing and attempting to cover it up, an official said Friday.\n\nBanned for decades under an international agreement to which China and the US are signatories, nuclear explosive testing involves the detonation of warheads. The US accusation comes on the heels of the expiration of the nuclear arms control New START agreement between the US and Russia, which limited their numbers of deployed warheads and launchers.\n\n\"I can reveal that the US government is aware that China has conducted nuclear explosive tests, including preparing for tests with designated yields in the hundreds of tons,\" US Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security Thomas DiNanno said in Geneva, Switzerland.\n\nDiNanno added that Beijing had used \"decoupling — a method to decrease the effectiveness of seismic monitoring — to hide its activities from the world,\" and said one such test had occurred on June 22, 2020. Decoupling refers to muffling the seismic signal of an underground nuclear test.\n\nA spokesperson for China's embassy in the US told Business Insider that Beijing is \"committed to peaceful development, follows a policy of 'no first use' of nuclear weapons, and a nuclear strategy that focuses on self-defense and adheres to its nuclear testing moratorium.\" The spokesperson added China is ready to work with other countries to uphold the agreement.\n\nThe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, adopted in 1996, banned the live tests that have occurred for decades and contributed to nuclear scares and radioactive exposure. The last such test conducted by the US was in 1992, and China's most recent occurred in 1996. The only publicly known explosive testing this century has been by North Korea. The US, Russia, and China have signed the treaty but haven't ratified it, unlike nearly 180 other countries.\n\nCurrent testing practices rely on modeling, simulation, and subcritical testing, which officials have said are vigorous and dependable. Last year, US President Donald Trump raised concerns with vague comments on resuming nuclear testing in response to other countries.\n\n\"They seem to all be nuclear testing. We have more nuclear weapons than anybody. We don't do testing, and we've halted it years, many years ago. But with others doing testing, I think it's appropriate that we do also,\" the president said.\n\nThere's been some suspicion that US rivals have been preparing for testing, including work spotted at the Lop Nur and Novaya Zemlya nuclear sites in China and Russia, respectively.\n\nBut in response to DiNanno's comments, Robert Floyd, executive secretary of the CTBTO, said the organization's monitoring system \"did not detect any event consistent with the characteristics of a nuclear weapon test explosion at that time. Subsequent, more detailed analyses has not altered that determination.\"\n\nJust a day before DiNanno's comments, the New START agreement binding the US and Russia to a number of operational nuclear weapons and launchers, as well as a verification process and open communication, expired. Whether Washington and Beijing will continue to observe the treaty or attempt a new agreement remains unclear.\n\nThe Trump administration has said a new nuclear arms deal would need to account for the growth of China's nuclear weapons stockpile, which the Pentagon has assessed will top 1,000 by 2030. \"And as we sit here today, China's entire nuclear arsenal has no limits, no transparency, no declarations, and no controls,\" DiNanno said, adding that a post-New START treaty will address both Russia's vast arsenal and China's nuclear rise.",

    "fullText": "The NFL's bid to capture the attention of the world's sports fans appears to know no bounds.\n\nAmerica's biggest sports league had already confirmed it will make its debut at two of the world's most iconic stadiums next season - Rio de Janeiro's Maracana and the Melbourne Cricket Ground.\n\nThen on Thursday, it used its biggest week of the year to announce that two of its most iconic franchises will be playing there.\n\nWith most activities for Super Bowl week being held in San Francisco, Thursday's news that the 49ers will be heading to Australia created a buzz in 'The City'.\n\nThen a few hours later it was revealed that the Dallas Cowboys - known as 'America's Team' - will head to Brazil for the NFL's first game in Rio.\n\n\"Introducing one of the league's most iconic teams to the Maracana Stadium marks a powerful milestone in the continued growth of the sport worldwide,\" said Luis Martinez, general manager of NFL Brazil.\n\nThe Cowboys' opponent and date for the game are yet to be confirmed. The 49ers will face the Los Angeles Rams, with the game expected to take place near the start of the season in September.\n\nNFL executives have repeatedly mentioned the league's desire to become a \"true global sport property\" and they will stage a record nine international games in 2026 - across four continents, seven countries and eight stadiums.\n\nWhere the Super Bowl will be won and lost\n\nWill Seahawks stop Patriots' record bid? Lowdown on Super Bowl 2026\n\nThe NFL's international presence has expanded dramatically over the past couple of years.\n\nFive international games during the 2024 season increased to seven in 2025, and nine will be played abroad in 2026.\n\nThat has included expanding into Brazil, Spain and Ireland, with Australia and France new territories for 2026, when there will also be a return to Mexico.\n\nNext season there will be games in London (three), Madrid, Melbourne, Mexico City, Munich, Paris and Rio.\n\n\"We're in several new markets, we're excited by that,\" said NFL commissioner Roger Goodell this week.\n\n\"It's the ambition that we have to be a global sport, but it's also the demand that we're having. We're hearing from cities all over the world that want to host these games and they really want to get more American football.\"\n\nGoodell has mentioned venturing into Asia while Abu Dhabi is one of the cities where the NFL has conducted a site visit to examine the possibility of playing a game there.\n\nThis week he reiterated that his ultimate goal is to play 16 international games each season, meaning each of the NFL's 32 teams would play overseas once a year.\n\n\"I think that's an important mark for us to go for, and I think we're well on our way,\" Goodell added.\n\nMini Super Bowls & Christmas games - NFL's bid to become 'truly global'\n\nTwo west coast teams were expected to make the journey for the NFL's first game in Australia, to minimise the impact of travel.\n\nAnd the Rams have been handed an encounter with divisional rivals the 49ers, who have also been regular Super Bowl contenders in recent years, so it makes for an appealing match-up.\n\nAfter being named this season's Most Valuable Player in San Francisco on Thursday, Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford said: \"It seems like a long flight, and I hope my back's not too sore afterwards, to be honest with you.\n\n\"But I am excited about it, it's a really cool opportunity. Playing an unbelievable team like the 49ers is going to be a huge challenge. It's a fun rivalry so I think the fans in Australia are going to get a great game.\"\n\nDavid White, interim executive director of the NFL Players' Association (NFLPA) said this week: \"Our members appreciate the global stage. They understand the excitement that the games are generating around the world.\n\n\"But we've got a lot of feedback about not having good experiences because it's inconsistent. It's a seemingly arbitrary approach that clubs take to travel.\"\n\nThe 'incredible story' of the British coach at the Super Bowl\n\nBefore this season's game at Wembley, for example, the Jacksonville Jaguars flew out to London early in the week, while the Rams arrived the day before the game and returned to LA immediately after their 35-7 win.\n\n\"Some teams will stay near the practice site, some will have lengthy commutes for the players after that travel, when they're getting over jet leg,\" said White. \"It depends which team they play for, so it's the lack of standardisation that feels arbitrary.\n\n\"The game requires a certain amount of rest, preparation and restoration in order for players to be safe, so all of that needs to be accounted for if we're going to talk about [travelling] even further away or having more international games. That's a matter of negotiation.\"\n\nThe NFL's current Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) with the NFLPA allows up to 10 regular-season games to held overseas per season.\n\nThe Minnesota Vikings became the first team to have two international games in the same season in 2025, playing in Dublin and London on successive Sundays, and linebacker Jonathan Greenard said he \"would not like to do back-to-back [again]\".\n\nBut White said players gave a \"good deal of positive feedback because of the way they went about it. That is the trick.\"\n\nHe added: \"It is possible that 16 games worldwide gets to be too much, but that's for the players to decide once they have all the information.\n\n\"We do have some sense of what makes a positive experience when travelling internationally, and we're collecting data.\n\n\"It's about making sure that the players are at the centre of that debate.\"\n\nGet American Football news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "Former German World Cup winner Thomas Müller is yet to decide when he will end his glittering playing career.\n\nMüller has a contract at Major League Soccer side Vancouver Whitecaps until the end of the year by when he will be 37. He joined the Canadian side last summer after 25 trophy-laden years at Bayern Munich.\n\n\"As always in my life, I don't commit myself unnecessarily. My\n main motivation for playing football is to enjoy it. The first few months here have been a lot of fun. Now my first full season is coming up,\" Müller told Germany's Welt paper.\n\nMüller named his fitness and health a key criteria, saying: \"How will my body cope with the whole journey? I struggled a bit towards the end of last season. That's another reason why I haven't fully made up my mind yet.\"\n\nMüller, who was speaking from a training camp in the southern Spanish city of Marbella where the Whitecaps are preparing for the new season, said he still enjoys the role of a player.\n\n\"Having the opportunity to decide a home game in the 90th minute with a penalty, feeling that pressure and having the chance to move so many people's emotions with one action when you score – that's still worth going to bed earlier for,\" he said.\n\n\"Then I'll just skip the cocktail and have still water instead.\"\n\nBayern hope that Müller will return to the club in a new capacity once he has ended his playing career but he said that nothing is decided yet.\n\n\"The connection to FC Bayern is still there, both emotionally and in terms of content,\" he said.\n\n\"And we have discussed with the club management that there is a possibility of going down a joint path in the future. There is no letter of intent or even a term sheet yet. I don't want to do my coaching licence now (while still playing) or start a degree.\"\n\nMüller said \"I want to consciously pursue my education\" after the playing career, \"instead of frantically trying to get a certificate on the side.\n\n\"When I do something, I give it one hundred per cent. I don't want to expect myself or anyone else to get anything less than my full passion, energy and attention.\"",

    "description": "Stellantis' eleven-figure write-down is the largest in a wave of EV charges on global automakers. For consumers, that means fewer vehicle options.",
    "fullText": "Another Detroit automaker is paying a steep price as it pulls back from electric vehicles.\n\nStellantis — the global auto giant behind brands like Jeep, Dodge, Ram, and Chrysler — said Friday that it would take a €22 billion ($26 billion) charge tied to a sweeping reset of its electric-vehicle strategy.\n\nIt's the largest in a wave of recent EV-related write-downs by major global automakers, bringing the total in charges across the industry to $55 billion.\n\nIn September, Volkswagen recorded a $3.5 billion charge linked to its electric division. Ford followed that up in December with a $19.5 billion charge as it canceled plans to build large EVs. Last month, General Motors announced a $6 billion write-down tied to reduced EV production.\n\nThe moves underscore how aggressively some of the world's biggest automakers are cutting back on electric-vehicle bets.\n\n\"The reset we have announced today is part of the decisive process we started in 2025, to once again make our customers and their preferences our guiding star,\" Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa said in a press release. \"The charges announced today largely reflect the cost of over-estimating the pace of the energy transition that distanced us from many car buyers' real-world needs, means, and desires.\"\n\nFilosa, who took over as CEO in May 2025, laid much of the blame on decisions made under the company's prior leadership, citing \"poor operational execution\" that left Stellantis with expensive EV investments that failed to sell.\n\nHis predecessor, Carlos Tavares, departed the company in December 2024.\n\nDuring Tavares' tenure, Stellantis spent billions positioning itself for what it believed would be a rapid shift in consumer demand toward electric vehicles. Formed in 2021 through the merger of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and France's PSA Group, the company poured money into new factories, battery development partnerships with LG Energy Solution and Samsung SDI, and an ambitious slate of future EV models.\n\nThe demand never materialized at the pace executives anticipated. Stellantis' profit dropped 70% during Tavares' final year on the job.\n\nStellantis has been holding costly EV-related assets — factories, platforms, and technology — that are now being written down.\n\nFor consumers, that means fewer options. The automaker has canceled or delayed several high-profile electric vehicles, including the Chrysler Airflow, the all-electric Ram 1500, and a planned $25,000 electric Jeep Renegade.\n\nIn January, the company also discontinued its fleet of plug-in hybrid vehicles, ending production of the Jeep Wrangler 4xe, Jeep Grand Cherokee 4xe, Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid, and the Dodge Hornet Plug-In.\n\nLooking ahead to 2026, Stellantis' remaining electric launches include the $65,000 Jeep Recon and an extended-range Ram 1500 REV, which incorporates a gas generator paired with the battery motor.\n\nThe company is also reintroducing gas-fed powertrains to its lineup — including the V8 Hemi-powered Ram pickup series and a six-cylinder Dodge Charger.\n\nThe reset extends beyond Stellantis' vehicle lineup. Business Insider recently reported that the company is rolling out a five-day return-to-office order, effective March 30.\n\nStill, investors reacted swiftly to the eleven-figure EV write-down. Stellantis shares plunged 25.5% in early trading Friday, falling to about $7.10 a share roughly an hour after markets opened.",

    "fullText": "Caroline Dubois expects \"an easy night\" against Terri Harper as the world champions ramped up their increasingly bitter rivalry before their 5 April showdown.\n\nThe unified lightweight title fight will take place at London's Olympia, topping Most Valuable Promotions' first event in the United Kingdom.\n\n\"This is the start of my future, my legacy, my greatness. I believe I'm going all the way and it starts with Terri,\" said Dubois, 25.\n\nShe doubled down on calling Doncaster's three-weight world champion \"irrelevant\" and described her as a \"lottery\" ticket to bigger fights as the pair came together at a news conference in London.\n\nHarper, who holds a 16-2-2 record, has shared the ring with some of the sport's best boxers, including Sandy Ryan, Cecilia Braekhus, Natasha Jonas and Alycia Baumgardner.\n\nHaving also claimed world titles at featherweight and light-middleweight, Harper accused Dubois of overlooking her.\n\n\"For me this fight isn't about the belts. For me I just want to beat Caroline and this will be the sweetest win of my career,\" said the 29-year-old.\n\nAs expected, there was no handshake or warm embrace in the face-off as Dubois - keeping in theme with the news conference - did most of the talking.\n\nEdwards to fight Powar for British title on BBC\n\nShields calls out Price for blockbuster fight\n\n'Boxing can be messed up' - how to build a prospect\n\nAll the signs beforehand have pointed to a fiery encounter between two women who share genuine animosity.\n\nIn December, Dubois accused her fellow champion of having \"lost her pen\" during fraught negotiations, while earlier this week Harper walked out of Sky Sports' Gloves Are Off after a heated exchange during filming.\n\nAs Dubois smiled and took centre stage on Friday, a more reserved Harper looked slightly fed up.\n\nAsked when the rivalry first started, she said she felt disrespected by Dubois calling her out after the loss to Ryan in 2024.\n\n\"She's doing a great job of selling the fight. She's doing my job for me,\" added Harper.\n\nDubois is undefeated in 13 professional bouts - 12 wins and a draw - and made an impressive start to life under the MVP banner with a points win over Camilla Panatta in December.\n\nLong touted as the future of British boxing, she has grown in confidence and found her voice in recent years.\n\n\"This is going to be an easy night,\" said the Londoner, adding Harper's experience \"doesn't mean anything\".\n\nDubois was also involved in a tense war of words with Baumgardner at a news conference in Miami late last year.\n\nAnd she warned the 31-year-old American: \"I'm coming for her next.\"\n\nMVP - headed up by Nakisa Bidarian and Jake Paul - have invested heavily in female boxing and this bill showcased the depth of their British stable.\n\nIn the co-main event, super bantamweight Ellie Scotney will face Mexico's WBA champion Mayelli Flores Rosquero in an undisputed title fight.\n\nThey were due to fight in December before an injury to the Londoner.\n\n\"I've not got to pay for my mum to fly to America so my pocket is a little bit better there,\" joked Scotney.\n\nShe was in good spirits as she talked about her faith and the joy of fighting on Easter Sunday with her pastor attending the contest.\n\n\"We're bringing church to the Olympia on the night,\" said the 27-year-old.\n\nScotney could become Britain's fourth - and youngest - undisputed champion of the four-belt era with victory.\n\nNorthampton's Chantelle Cameron, 34, also features on the card with an opportunity to become a two-weight world champion when she faces the unbeaten Michaela Kotaskova for the WBO light-middleweight title.\n\nFormer undisputed light-welterweight champion Cameron's only defeat came against Ireland's Katie Taylor in 2023, while her 34-year-old Czech opponent has two losses and 11 wins in her 13 bouts.\n\nNorwich's Emma Dolan, 27, will challenge vastly experienced IBF super-flyweight champion Irma Garcia for her first world title.

    "fullText": "Crystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner has indicated the knee injury that scuppered Jean-Philippe Mateta's planned move to AC Milan could also thwart the striker's \"dream\" of playing at the World Cup.\n\nMateta was on the verge of joining Milan for £30m on deadline day, but the deal was called off after knee issues emerged over the course of two medical examinations.\n\nThe 28-year-old has been dealing with the injury to his right knee during the first half of the season.\n\n\"We knew and he knew there was an issue. He was not really pleased,\" Glasner said.\n\n\"We took a higher risk, that's why he could play in most games, but we rested him for some games and some training sessions.\n\n\"To be honest it was not a big surprise to everyone that he could fail [the medical]. We knew that this can happen and he knew it.\"\n\nFrance international Mateta has yet to decide what his next steps should be, with this summer's World Cup on his mind.\n\n\"There are two ways we can do this: manage the knee like we have until after the World Cup, which is Mateta's dream to play in. The other one is he undergoes surgery,\" Glasner said.\n\n\"We don't know how long he would be out. There are a few predictions: it could be two months, three months, six to nine months.

    "fullText": "Twenty-nine days since Sydney and the final ball of the Ashes - barely enough time for some of England's players to return home.\n\nControversy has made no attempt to return to its box over the weeks that have passed. One positive for England is they are not alone in struggling to keep it in check.\n\nAhead stands a World Cup - the 10th in the T20 format and fourth since the Covid-19 pandemic - which few seem to want but one plenty, captain Harry Brook, coach Brendon McCullum and their England team included, need.\n\nThe cricket, which begins on Saturday with Scotland and India among those in action, will be entertaining over the next four weeks, make no mistake.\n\nWatching this sport in India, especially when the home team are involved, is one of the game's thrills.\n\nSri Lanka will offer plenty as co-hosts too and the expansion to 20 teams, which this time allows Italy to make their major tournament bow, was one of the triumphs of the 2024 edition in the Caribbean.\n\nBut this tournament begins under the darkest of clouds.\n\nBangladesh have decided not to be there. Unless there is a late change of heart, Pakistan are not going to play India in Sri Lanka under instruction from their government.\n\nEight months ago, South Africa's Heinrich Klaasen and West Indies' Nicholas Pooran, two of the best and most sought-after batters in the T20 game, called time on their international careers.\n\nAged 33 and 29 respectively, they opted for the franchise world.\n\nWould that happen so close to a major tournament if the draw of a World Cup was as strong as it once was?\n\nA factor in these issues is, in part at least, the oversaturation of cricket's major events.\n\nAdd in the 50-over World Cup in 2023, last year's Champions Trophy and four women's World Cups, there have been 10 such tournaments in little over four years.\n\nBut the wider mess, one absorbing an increasing amount of the subcontinent and which will threaten the future stability of the sport if not resolved, is a result of years of weak management.\n\nPolitical posturing has not crept into cricket slowly over the past three months.\n\nIt has stamped all over it for a decade, all while the International Cricket Council stood and watched.\n\nIndia played the Champions Trophy in Dubai rather than Pakistan as scheduled – an issue predictable from the moment the hosts were selected.\n\nBangladesh bowler Mustafizur Rahman was then removed from the Indian Premier League without explanation at the start of the year, kicking off this latest crisis.\n\nThe easiest option has been taken at every turn. This is the result.\n\nTrends and tactics to look for at 2026 T20 World Cup\n\nRefugee Ihsan swaps 'tapeball' cricket for World Cup\n\nWhat next in Pakistan-India controversy as ICC confirm forfeit stance?\n\nEngland's issues may not run so deep, but they are no less pressing.\n\nThe talk of the past four weeks has been of nights out, clockings and identifying who was in a New Zealand nightclub and who was not.\n\nWhat happened in Wellington is English cricket's latest drama.\n\nThe controversies also overshadowed an impressive two-week tour of the Indian Ocean.\n\nThey were asked to be smarter after the Ashes and clinched the subsequent T20 series by winning on a road, before sealing a 3-0 whitewash on a slow turner - all in conditions in which they will play their entire Super 8 phase, should they progress through the initial stage of this World Cup.\n\nYet the narrative has remained focused on Brook.\n\nMcCullum said this week his captain's escapades in New Zealand have been spoken about too much. Some supporters may agree.\n\nWhile naive not to expect it to emerge, choosing not to reveal the incident from the start was fair. Brook was punished with a heavy fine in any case.\n\nBut by lying in his apology and those untruths not being immediately corrected afterwards, Brook and England only ensured the spotlight returned to their off-field activities.\n\nThe tight turnaround between the Ashes and World Cup was always one obvious stumbling block for those who would have already sacked Brook and McCullum.\n\nThere was no time for another coach to be found, but after this there are three months before England's men play again - plenty of time for replacement feet to get under the table if results are poor again.\n\nOf course, there is a scenario where McCullum simply sees the break as the time to walk away - though he maintained his desire to stay on earlier this week.\n\nThe New Zealander's takeaway from his only previous white-ball tournament in charge of England - when his side exited the Champions Trophy without winning a match - was that the players cared too much.\n\n\"If anything they are too harsh on themselves,\" he said. \"They need to be able to give themselves a break and be able to let go a little bit so all of that talent can come out.\"\n\nNavigating that, given the scrutiny around a perceived relaxed, care-free environment and his bosses' wish for change, appears a difficult challenge.\n\nFor McCullum and Brook, reaching the semi-finals in the first week of March is the minimum requirement. Having won 10 of their past 11 completed T20s, they should be capable.\n\nDoing so in 2024 was not enough to save the job of McCullum's predecessor as white-ball coach, Australian Matthew Mott, so much will also be about how England play.\n\nWill they, unlike in the Caribbean, truly challenge the best?\n\nThey have been billed as serious contenders once this winter and failed miserably.\n\nWhether to secure futures or merely change the narrative, England must hope those 29 days since Sydney have provided the time to ensure they do not do so again.\n\nTop run-scorer, wicket-taker and champion - T20 World Cup predictions\n\nLive ball-by-ball commentary of every match on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra, BBC Sounds and the BBC Sport website and app, plus live texts with in-play clips and highlights.",

    "fullText": "Pep Guardiola defended his stance of speaking up about global conflicts by asking, \"why should I not express what I feel, just because I am a manager?\"\n\nOn Tuesday, the Manchester City boss said he wants to use his position to \"speak up to be a better society\" as he talked at a football news conference about the \"hurt\" he feels for victims of global conflict.\n\nGuardiola received both praise and criticism for his passionate words, with Jewish community leaders advising the Spaniard to \"focus on football\" and \"be more careful in his future language\".\n\nBut the 55-year-old did not back down when asked to respond to those comments by BBC Sport, saying: \"To be honest, I didn't say anything special. I don't feel that.\"\n\nLast week, Guardiola gave a speech in support of Palestinian children at a charity event in his home city of Barcelona.\n\nHe used the news conference before Manchester City's Carabao Cup semi-final second leg against Newcastle to speak about children being killed and injured in conflict zones across the world, saying the footage he sees \"hurts me\".\n\nHe referenced conflicts in Palestine, Ukraine, Sudan and even recent shootings by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents in the United States.\n\nThe Jewish Representative Council of Greater Manchester & Region said Manchester City have been \"let down\" by Guardiola \"repeatedly straying into commentary on international affairs\".\n\nSpeaking in his news conference before Sunday's Premier League game at Liverpool, Guardiola said: \"Why should I not express what I feel, just because I am a manager? I don't agree but I respect absolutely all opinions.\n\n\"What I said basically is how many conflicts are there right now all around the world? How many? A lot - I condemn all of them.\n\n\"If innocent people are [being] killed, I condemn them all and not putting a selection on one being [more] important than the other - not this country is [more important] than the other one.\n\n\"If you don't understand my message it's fine. I cannot say otherwise.\"\n\nAsked whether he will now stick to speaking about football, Guardiola replied: \"OK you focus on being a journalist and you cannot talk about the economy, because you are not an economic journalist.\n\n\"[Being] involved in football, don't talk about that or that or that. That's why the world remains silent, that is what the world wants, right? Be silent, don't say anything.\n\n\"I think it is completely the opposite but anyway, it is what it is.\"",

    "fullText": "Nintendo’s monster-collecting franchise was pilloried as a ‘pestilential Ponzi scheme’ in the 90s. But as its celebrates its 30th birthday, it now stands as a powerful example of video games’ ability to connect people\n\nWhen I was 11, it was my dream to compete in the Pokémon World Championships, held in Sydney in 2000. I’d come across it in a magazine, and then earnestly set about training teams of creatures, transferring them between my Pokémon Red Game Boy cartridge and the 3D arenas of Pokémon Stadium on the Nintendo 64. I never made it as a player but I did finally achieve this dream on my 26th birthday, when I went to Washington DC to cover the world championships as a journalist. I was deeply moved. Presided over by a giant inflatable Pikachu hanging from the ceiling, the competitors and spectators were united in an unselfconscious love for these games, with their colourful menageries and heartfelt messaging about trust, friendship and hard work.\n\nIt is emotional to see the winners lift their trophies after a tense final round of battles, as overwhelmed by their success as any sportsperson. But it’s the pride that the smaller competitors’ parents show in their mini champions that really gets to me. During the first wave of Pokémania in the late 90s, Pokémon was viewed with suspicion by most adults. Now that the first generation of Pokémaniacs have grown up, even becoming parents ourselves, we see it for what it is: an imaginative, challenging and really rather wholesome series of games that rewards every hour that children devote to it.\n\nOver the three decades since the original Red and Blue (or Green, in Asia) versions of the video game were released in Japan in 1996, Pokémon has earned a place among the greats of children’s fiction. Like Harry Potter, the Famous Five and Narnia, it offers a powerful fantasy of self-determination, set in a world almost totally free of adult supervision. In every game, your mother sends you out into the world with a rucksack and a kiss goodbye; after that, it’s all on you.\n\nLike The Simpsons, Pokémon is a kind of cultural shorthand for the millennial generation. More than Mario, Zelda or any other Nintendo creation, Pokémon brings people together. It was designed from the beginning to be a social game, encouraging (and indeed necessitating) that players traded and battled with each other to complete their collection of virtual creatures and train their teams up into super-squads. Today, the internet has entirely normalised the idea of video games as social activities, but in the late 90s this was a novel idea. You can’t play Pokémon without other people: in 1999, that meant huddling in the playground, using a cable to link your Game Boys together; later, in 2016, at the height of the Pokémon Go phenomenon, it meant hundreds of people converging improbably at the same park with their phones to catch a Gengar.\n\nPokémon is often thought of as a turn-of-the-century fad, so it might be surprising to learn that it brings in more money now than it ever did at the height of its first wave of popularity. It has become the highest-grossing entertainment franchise of all time: between the TV series, the merchandise, the trading cards, the games and everything else adorned with the adorable faces of Pikachu and pals, the franchise has brought in north of $100bn, more than Star Wars or the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n\nThis global phenomenon has its roots in Machida, a city on the outskirts of Tokyo, where Pokémon’s creator Satoshi Tajiri was born in 1965. Like many Japanese children in the 60s and 70s, little Satoshi collected bugs, becoming such an expert that his elementary school classmates referred to him as Dr Bug. As a teenager a new obsession arrived: video games, then just making their way into Japanese arcades. His enthusiasm was such that he started putting together a monthly zine, with his friend Ken Sugimori, called Game Freak – later the name of the video game development company they founded together, which still adorns the title screens of modern Pokémon games.\n\nThe idea for Pokémon began to percolate for Tajiri around 1990. Watching people link their Game Boys together with cables to play Tetris, the hit puzzle game, he envisioned the bugs he’d collected crawling between the consoles. But it took six long years for this idea to transform into a monochrome world full of 151 collectible critters, in chunky black Game Boy pixels. During this time the developer nearly went bust several times, taking on projects for Nintendo and other game developers to keep afloat; Tajiri regularly went without a salary.\n\nPokémon’s astronomical success wasn’t instant, but the result of slow-burning sales over years. When it eventually came out in 1996, Pocket Monsters Red and Green – as they were known in Japan – were indie underdogs, made by a tiny team with limited technology for the ageing handheld Game Boy console. Nobody expected it to be much of a hit, but the world of Pokémon Blue has an unexpected sense of place that transcends their technical limitations. The symbiotic relationship between humans, nature and Pokémon permeates every aspect of life, and is often quite touching – particularly at in-game locations such as Lavender Town, where the mourning owners of dead Pokémon come to honour them at a giant commemorative tower.\n\nBut the real marketable genius of Pokémon was the fact that the game came in different versions. The reason that Pokémon games always come in pairs is that different monsters reside in each cartridge. If you want to collect them all, to complete your Pokédex field guide, you need to trade them. Creatures could be sent between cartridges, so friends with different versions of the game could help each other accumulate covetable creatures. With Tetris, the Game Boy’s link cable was used for competition. Here it was used for connection.\n\nPokémon’s popularity spread through playground word-of-mouth. By the time it arrived in the US in 1998, and Europe in 1999, it was already a franchise: Pikachu-adorned games, TV shows, toys, films and lunchboxes, were rolled out carefully by marketers with a proven playbook.\n\nToday, Tajiri is a reclusive figure. Almost everything we know about him comes from a single 1999 interview with Time magazine. The tone of Time’s piece is shockingly dismissive. Declaring the series “a pestilential Ponzi scheme” it describes the “delinquent” and “criminal” behaviour of young Pokémon fans, and the moral bankruptcy of the whole craze – which, it comforts, is likely to peter out soon, like it did for the Power Rangers.\n\nNow that Pokémon has become one of the most enduring and successful entertainment properties of all time, this alarmist attitude seems ridiculous. But the scaremongering was very real. Some of this was simply older people failing to understand the new thing that the kids were into. But there was also an alarmingly xenophobic flavour to the moral panic, this scary Japanese thing with its sinister monsters coming over the seas to captivate children. Christian pastors in the US were proclaiming Pikachu to be a demon. There were movements to ban the TV show from airing.\n\nPerhaps understandably, given the disrespectful and, presumably, hurtful tone of that Time interview, and the moral panic that Pokémania unwittingly ignited, Satoshi Tajiri has shunned the limelight ever since. Now 60, he remains at Game Freak and is still involved in the creation of each new Pokémon game (as of 2025, there are 38 in total), though he reportedly stepped back from day-to-day development in 2012.\n\nJuly 2016 saw the launch of Pokémon Go, a mobile game that quickly became the most popular in US history, with 232 million players across the world. Pokémon Go works kind of like magic. With the app open, you walk around your neighbourhood; on your phone screen, you see a map of your real surroundings, with icons showing where Pokémon might be found. When you encounter a creature it is superimposed on your real surroundings, a Gengar posing casually in your local park. From there you simply flick a Pokéball at the creatures to capture them.\n\nThere’s a unique aspect too to Pokémon Go that makes it different to every other video game-related phenomenon I’ve witnessed. Most of the time when we talk about how games can help people through hard times, we talk about escapism: how virtual worlds can be a reprieve from the problems of the real one. But Pokémon Go was not so much about escapism as connection, a continuation of the lineage of those first games decades before.\n\nAt its height, it connected its players with their local area and the people around them. For a few months, there we were, all looking at our surroundings through a different lens, thinking that there might be a little bit of magic out there in the world, like a bug hiding under a rock.\n\nDr Bug may not be as involved as before, but the pastoral nature he instilled in Pokémon has persisted throughout the last 30 years: the interrelationships between people and Pokémon form the touching core of the games, movies and TV shows, and there is even a quasi-environmentalist bent to its stories. This is, after all, a game about evolution and living in harmony with the natural world. There is a resonance with nature that prevents this $100bn franchise from feeling nakedly cynical or exploitative. Pokémon’s story speaks to an important truth about video games: they are a powerful vector for connection between people. Millions are united by these imaginary creatures, born from one boy’s love of the natural world.\n\nSuper Nintendo: How One Japanese Company Helped the World Have Fun by Keza MacDonald is published by Guardian Faber.

(Photo by Marco Luzzani/Getty Images)\n\nGiacomo Raspadori is back in Serie A after a short-lived, six-month spell in LaLiga with Atletico Madrid. The two-time Scudetto winner struggled to break into Diego Simeone’s first-team plans in the Spanish capital and was limited to just one start from a possible 18 league matches prior to his joining Atalanta.\n\nRaspadori has already featured in two Serie A matches for Atalanta, starting and scoring in their most recent match against Pisa, which ended in a resounding 4-0 victory for La Dea.\n\nHe has already been a regular in Gennaro Gattuso’s Italy national team squad and now just needs a consistent run of games before becoming a sure-fire pick for the 2026 World Cup squad assuming that Italy qualify.\n\nOfficial: Lorenzo Lucca joins Nottingham Forest on loan with an option to buy from Napoli (picture: www.nottinghamforest.co.uk)\n\nIt had been a disappointing season at Napoli for the towering centre-forward, who has since joined Nottingham Forest on loan with an option to buy.\n\nNapoli brought in both Lucca and Rasmus Hojlund to strengthen their options at centre-forward over the summer, but even after a serious injury to Romelu Lukaku the week before the season began, Lucca was limited to just four starts in Serie A and none since the end of October.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Lucca will become a regular starter in the Premier League under Sean Dyche, but if he is given regular minutes, he will certainly be an option for Gattuso to consider in Italy’s slightly understocked centre-forward department.\n\nDaniel Maldini wears the Lazio jersey\n\nAnother attacker hoping to impress ahead of the World Cup is Daniel Maldini, who joined Lazio on loan with a potential obligation to buy from Atalanta during the January window.\n\nThe son of Italy legend Paolo Maldini was limited to just three Serie A starts with Atalanta during the first half of the season, but looks set to be handed more consistent opportunities under Maurizio Sarri at the Stadio Olimpico.\n\nThere have even been suggestions that Sarri could look to deploy Maldini as a false nine.\n\nFLORENCE, ITALY – JANUARY 27: Marco Brescianini of ACF Fiorentina battles for the ball with Nico Paz of Como 1907 during the Coppa Italia match between of ACF Fiorentina and of Como 1907 at Stadio Artemio Franchi on January 27, 2026 in Florence, Italy. (Photo by Gabriele Maltinti/Getty Images)\n\nAnother Italy international who left Atalanta in January was Brescianini, who has joined Fiorentina on loan with an option and potential obligation to buy.\n\nBrescianini has already earned more minutes over his first four games with Fiorentina than he had done in his last four months with Atalanta, earning his first league start since October during La Viola’s recent 2-1 loss against Napoli.\n\nBrescianini still faces a difficult task to break into the Italy midfield department with stiff competition from the likes of Nicolo Barella, Sandro Tonali, Manuel Locatelli, Davide Frattesi, Bryan Cristante and Samuele Ricci.\n\nOfficial: Diego Coppola joins Paris FC from Brighton & Hove Albion (@Diegocoppolass via Instagram)\n\nDiego Coppola has taken the decision to move away from the Premier League after six months on the south coast with Brighton and Hove Albion. He had to wait until December to earn his first starts in the English top flight, and has since joined Paris FC on loan, where he will team up with fellow Italy representatives Ciro Immobile and Luca Koleosho.\n\nCoppola has two Italy caps to his name at the age of 22, and will be hoping for more regular minutes in Ligue 1 to challenge the likes of Alessandro Bastoni, Alessandro Buongiorno, Riccardo Calafiori and Gianluca Mancini for a spot in a potential World Cup squad.",

    "description": "The new A380 business class is an example of how Lufthansa is keeping the world's largest passenger plane competitive amid widebody shortages.",
    "fullText": "Lufthansa is doubling down on a jet that many thought was history.\n\nThe German flag carrier announced Friday that it will install a new business-class cabin on all eight of its Airbus A380 superjumbos as part of its broader multibillion-dollar fleet renewal.\n\nAirlines are racing to meet growing demand for high-dollar premium experiences on long-haul flights. The new A380 business class will deliver an upgrade over the current layout, with more space, modern technology, and aisle access for all passengers.\n\nHowever, it will not be part of Allegris, Lufthansa's new signature economy and premium cabins rolling out across its old Boeing 747-8s and newly delivered Boeing 787s and Airbus A350s.\n\nLufthansa said the A380 seat, from manufacturer Thompson Aero, was chosen strategically because it is already certified for the jet type. Allegris is not, and using it would require a separate, lengthy certification process.\n\nThat means Lufthansa can quickly retrofit the A380 planes and get them back in the air. The project is expected to start in February, with the first refreshed jet returning to service in April.\n\nThe move comes as airlines face delayed deliveries of next-generation widebodies — particularly the Airbus A350-1000 and the yet-to-be-certified Boeing 777X — creating a crunch in long-haul, money-making capacity.\n\nA company spokesperson told Business Insider that Lufthansa's A380 refurbishment was planned well in advance and isn't a direct response to shifting delivery timelines.\n\n\"Lufthansa is investing in an aircraft that has already been in scheduled service for several years,\" he said. \"Nevertheless, we always want to offer our guests a modern and high-quality cabin product.\"\n\nStill, Lufthansa has repeatedly delayed retiring its A380s.\n\nIt considered ditching the jet after COVID halted travel (six aircraft were permanently removed from the fleet), but a strong post-pandemic rebound brought some planes back from storage and pushed the retirement of the remaining A380s to 2026.\n\nIt now has at least another five years. Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr said in October 2025 that the A380s will continue flying into the early 2030s as the airline awaits new widebodies.\n\nLufthansa is the expected launch customer for Boeing's 777X, now expected to be at least seven years late in 2027 due to production and certification issues. The airline has also faced delivery delays for the 787 and A350.\n\nCarriers like Dubai-based Emirates, Australian flag carrier Qantas, and British Airways are similarly keeping older planes flying longer as they await new planes — including refurbishing the A380 with expensive new economy and premium cabins.\n\nData from the aviation analytics firm Cirium shows roughly 91,500 A380 flights are scheduled for 2026, about 1,500 more than in 2025. That uptick comes after the number of A380 flights plunged from about 120,000 in 2019 to just under 14,000 in 2021.\n\nThis increase comes despite the A380's inefficiencies. Its four fuel-hungry engines make it costly to operate, its size limits the number of airports it can serve, and its roughly 500 seats are challenging to consistently fill. While a few ultra-high-demand routes can justify the capacity, it doesn't work across an entire network.\n\nAirlines are also increasingly favoring smaller, more flexible twin-engine widebodies that can better adjust to fluctuating demand and efficiently serve both point-to-point routes — nonstops that don't go through a mega hub — and traditional hub-and-spoke networks.\n\nAirbus ultimately ended A380 production in 2021.\n\nLufthansa's A380s presently feature a 2-2-2 business-class layout, which forces window-seat passengers to climb over a neighbor to reach the aisle — a frustration for travelers paying a premium for privacy and flexibility beyond what economy offers.\n\nRenderings show the new cabin will switch to a 1-2-1 layout, giving every passenger direct aisle access. The design also adds Bluetooth connectivity, privacy partitions, and a lie-flat bed longer than six feet when the seat is fully reclined.\n\nOnce retrofitted, the A380 will feature eight seats in first class, 68 in business, 52 in premium economy, and 371 in regular coach.\n\nThe cabin won't have sliding doors, double beds, or big front-row suites — features that have become increasingly popular across the industry and are included on certain Allegris seats.\n\nThat added complexity, however, has slowed Allegris' rollout. The cabin includes multiple seat types and configurations within a single aircraft and has not yet been certified for the 787.\n\nAs a result, some Dreamliners are currently flying with business-class seats blocked from sale while Lufthansa awaits regulatory approval, limiting premium-cabin capacity and revenue.",

    "fullText": "It is almost time for the 2026 ICC Men's T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka.\n\nIndia head into the tournament as defending champions following their success in the Caribbean and United States in 2024.\n\nThey are strong favourites in their home conditions - but the unpredictable nature of T20 cricket makes for an exciting tournament.\n\nHere is a full guide to the 10th edition of the men's 20-over global showpiece.\n\nThe 2026 Men's T20 World Cup starts on 7 February at 05:30 GMT with Pakistan facing the Netherlands in Colombo.\n\nIt is one of three games on the opening day, with the West Indies v Scotland at 09:30 and India v USA at 15:30.\n\nThe initial 20-team group stage, that sees four groups of five, continues until 20 February, with three games every day at the same times as above, bar the final day when there is just one game at 13:30.\n\nThe Super 8s follow with one or two games a day at 09:30 and 13:30, before the semi-finals across 4 and 5 March.\n\nThe final is on Sunday, 8 March at 13:30 BST in Ahmedabad.\n\nFull T20 World Cup fixture list including start times and venues\n\nThe 2026 Men's T20 World Cup follows the same format as 2024, which was the tournament's biggest with 20 sides taking part.\n\nAll of the teams are involved from the off in an initial group stage, with each side playing four games and the top two progressing to the Super 8s.\n\nThe Super 8s, which will take place across India and Sri Lanka, will consist of two groups of four, with eight sides seeded to help with the planning and schedule.\n\nThose eight sides are: Australia, India, South Africa, West Indies (Group 1) and England, New Zealand, Pakistan and Sri Lanka (Group 2).\n\nShould those sides progress they will go into their respective group based on their seeding, rather than their finishing position in the initial group phase.\n\nIn the Super 8s, the top two teams progress to the semi-finals with the winner of each group facing the runner-up in the other.\n\nThroughout both phases teams are awarded two points for a win, one for a no result and zero for a loss. There's no ties in T20 cricket - more on that below!\n\nAll 12 Test-playing nations have qualified for the tournament after Zimbabwe came through their qualifying stage.\n\nItaly are the only tournament debutants, while Canada are at their first global tournament since 2014.\n\nScotland were a late replacement for Bangladesh, who pulled out of the tournament after the governing body, the International Cricket Council (ICC), refused to meet their request to play their matches in Sri Lanka rather than India due to safety concerns amid rising tensions between the two countries.\n\nScotland, who were the highest-ranked side to not qualify, took Bangladesh's place in Group C and will fulfill their fixtures as scheduled.\n\nPakistan also considered a full boycott, but their government has decided it can play in the tournament, apart from the game against India on 15 February. The impact of that decision is yet to be communicated by the ICC.\n\nThey will play their games in Sri Lanka as part of an agreement reached in 2024 around India and Pakistan matches not being played in the other country.\n\nThe 20 sides are split into the following four groups in the initial phase:\n\nGroup A: India (X1), Namibia, Netherlands, Pakistan (Y3), USA\n\nGroup B: Australia (X2), Ireland, Oman, Sri Lanka (Y4), Zimbabwe\n\nGroup C: England (Y1), Italy, Nepal, Scotland, West Indies (X3)\n\nGroup D: Afghanistan, Canada, New Zealand (Y2), South Africa (X4), United Arab Emirates\n\nFull squad lists for the 2026 Men's T20 World Cup\n\nA total of eight venues are being used - five in India and three in Sri Lanka.\n\nIn India, Eden Gardens in Kolkata, Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai, MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai, Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad and Arun Jaitley Stadium in Delhi will host games.\n\nR Premadasa Stadium and Sinhalese Sports Club Ground - both in Colombo - and Pallekele Cricket Stadium put on matches in Sri Lanka.\n\nThe Narendra Modi Stadium, which holds 132,000 fans and is the biggest cricket venue in the world, is due to host the final, unless Pakistan qualify, with the game then moved to Colombo.\n\nThe tournament is played in a T20 format, so both teams will face 20 overs unless they are bowled out beforehand or the team batting second reaches their target before then.\n\nEach innings will start with a six-over powerplay and there are different fielding restrictions in that phase.\n\nMatches should last three hours and 10 minutes, with each innings allocated one hour and 25 minutes and separated by a 20-minute interval.\n\nIn limited-overs cricket there is a 'stop-clock' meaning the bowling side must be ready to bowl each over within 60 seconds of the previous one finishing.\n\nEach side will be allowed two unsuccessful reviews per innings.\n\nShould the number of runs scored by each team be level after 20 overs, the match will go to a super over (each team will face six balls - highest score wins). If that finishes a tie then super overs will continue to be played until a winner is found.\n\nIn the two group phases a minimum of five overs per side must be played to constitute a result, but that rises to 10 overs in the semi-finals and final.\n\nIf a match is halted after that point due to weather conditions then DLS (Duckworth Lewis Stern method) will be used to decide the winner.\n\nThe ICC are yet to publish playing conditions around reserve days and extra time allocated to the knockout matches.\n\nIf Pakistan reach the semi-finals, Colombo's R. Premadasa Stadium will replace Kolkata as the venue for the first semi-final, while the final would also move if Pakistan qualify.\n\nIf India make the last four and face any side that is not Pakistan, they will play in the second semi-final in Mumbai on 5 March.\n\nGlossary of cricket terms including DLS and powerplay\n\nThere have been six winners of the nine Men's T20 World Cups.

    "fullText": "Under-19 World Cup, final, Harare\n\nIndia 411-9 (50.0 overs): Suryavanshi 175 (80); Minto 3-63\n\nIndia teenager Vaibhav Suryavanshi made a stunning 175 from just 80 balls in the Under-19 World Cup final against England.\n\nThe 14-year-old hammered 15 sixes and 15 fours at a strike rate of 218.75 during a brutal and breathtaking knock at the Harare Sports Club in Zimbabwe.\n\nHe scored 24 off his first 24 balls, meaning his last 151 runs came off just 56 deliveries.\n\nSuryavanshi's 126-minute stay at the crease was eventually ended by England seamer Manny Lumsden in the 26th over to leave India 251-3.\n\nLumsden took pace off the ball and Suryavanshi gloved an attempted slog sweep to England captain and wicketkeeper Thomas Rew.\n\nA number of England's players shook Suryavanshi's hand as he left the field in recognition of the brilliance of his innings.\n\nIndia finished on 411-9 from their 50 overs - the fifth highest total in U19 World Cup history and a record for a final eclipsing the 253-7 made by Australia against India in the 2024 final.\n\nSuryavanshi's score took his World Cup tally to 439 runs in seven innings at 62.71 - four runs clear of Afghanistan's Faisal Khan as the tournament's leading run-scorer.\n\nSome other notable statistics from Suryavanshi's innings:\n\nIt was the highest score in an Under-19 World Cup final, beating Unmukt Chand's 111* for India in the 2012 final against Australia.\n\nThe innings gives him the ninth highest score in the history of youth ODIs. South Africa's Jorich van Schalkwyk (215 vs Zimbabwe) is the only player to make a double century.\n\nIt was the sixth-highest individual score in the history of all matches played at U19 World Cups.\n\nHis knock included the record for most sixes (15) in a youth ODI innings, beating his own record of 14 against the United Arab Emirates at last year's U19 Asia Cup.\n\nHis 15 sixes is the highest number in an Under-19 World Cup innings. Only two other players have managed double digits.\n\nThe century off 55 balls is the second fastest in U19 World Cups, behind Will Malajczuk's 51-ball hundred for Australia against Japan earlier in this year's tournament\n\nIt is the latest achievement for Suryavanshi, who shot to global fame in April last year when he smashed his first ball in the Indian Premier League for six.\n\nHe then became the youngest player to hit a century in men's T20s when he made a 35-ball hundred for Rajasthan Royals against Gujarat Titans.\n\nIt was also the second-fastest century in IPL history, behind Chris Gayle's 30-ball ton in 2013.\n\nIn July 2025, he struck what was then the fastest recorded century in a youth ODI, making 143 from 78 balls as India beat England by 55 runs at Worcester.\n\nHe took 52 balls to reach three figures, bettering Kamran Ghulam's 53-ball effort for Pakistan against England in 2013.\n\nFour months later, he struck a 32-ball century in India A's victory against the United Arab Emirates in their Asia Cup Rising Stars T20 match. He was eventually dismissed for 144 from 42 balls.\n\nListen to ball-by-ball commentary of the final on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra and the BBC Sport website and app.\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "fullText": "Shovelling snow, finding childcare and a frenetic scramble for plane tickets.\n\nIt's been an unexpectedly stressful few weeks for Scotland's cricketers, who were thrust into action by Bangladesh's decision to boycott the T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka.\n\nThe Scots were called up by the International Cricket Council (ICC) by virtue of being the highest-ranked team not already at the tournament, but the players were finding out as everyone else was - via social media and news outlets.\n\n\"It was just so many screenshots of Bangladeshi journalists and all these tweets,\" Scotland spinner Mark Watt told the BBC's No Balls: The Cricket Podcast.\n\n\"All the boys were just flying round saying 'is this true? Is this going to be happening?'\n\n\"It was like that scene in The Office - 'it's happening, it's happening, stay calm'. Cricket Scotland have done really well to get to organise everything so quickly and getting everyone out to India so quickly.\"\n\nNo Balls: Watt's this? Scotland at the T20 World Cup?\n\nRefugee Ihsan swaps 'tapeball' cricket for World Cup\n\nNo sponsor, kit on order & visa wait - Scotland embrace late World Cup call\n\nScotland had failed to reach the World Cup because of a hugely disappointing qualifying campaign in the Netherlands last summer, which included defeats by Italy and Jersey.\n\n\"It's so surreal,\" Watt said. \"I did a chat at a local club and they were saying, 'what are you going to do when the World Cup's on?' And I was like, 'I'm not even going to watch any games because I'm still so gutted that we're not playing in it'.\"\n\nInstead of prepping for subcontinental conditions, players based in Scotland were undergoing fitness programmes and going about their day-to-day lives when the news started to filter through.\n\n\"[Michael Leask] lives in Aberdeen and he was shovelling snow as we were getting all these calls,\" Watt said.\n\n\"We were doing boxing and between sets we're saying 'do you think we're actually going to go?'\n\n\"Not a lot of cricket was going on, it was other things. [Matthew] Cross is trying to build his house at the moment, so he's doing all his DIY.\n\n\"He's been stressed trying to get other people to go in and do the stuff he was going to do.\n\n\"People who have kids were trying to get them minded.\n\n\"I got all my holidays out of the way last year. I was looking forward to a little break, but I'm very happy to be here.\"\n\nThe last-minute nature of Scotland's entry has drawn comparisons to a famous equivalent in the world of football.\n\n\"Everyone keeps saying Denmark [at the Euros] in 1992, because they didn't qualify and won it,\" Watt said. \"Anything's possible. Imagine that?\"\n\nAfter Watt and his team-mates knew they were going to India, they were not sure when they would depart.\n\nFlights were booked in the hope that visas would come through, and when they did the rush to get halfway around the world began.\n\n\"It was like Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,\" Watt said. \"I got my golden ticket and I was like, 'you need to get me on the flight tonight'.\n\n\"Leasky in Aberdeen had to drive two and a half hours to Edinburgh, he got his visa through the same time as me.\n\n\"We're all so excited and so grateful this opportunity came about, but also feel sorry for Bangladesh on the other side of it.\"\n\nScotland are one of five European sides at the competition and one of nine associate ICC members.\n\nAfter warm-up defeats by Afghanistan and Namibia, they take on West Indies in their opening match on Saturday, before games against Italy, England and Nepal in Group C, with the top two progressing to the Super 8s.\n\nWatt says the prospect of seeing different match-ups can only be a positive.\n\n\"Obviously I've got a bit of favouritism for their associates,\" he said.\n\n\"But I just think the more the merrier. You see these Test-playing nations play against each other so often, it's a little bit samey and I think it's really refreshing when the associates come to play against these big teams.\n\n\"Obviously sometimes the results don't go your way, but it's the only way these teams and ourselves are going to learn how to play against them.\n\n\"So it's a great learning curve, but also, we're not there just to learn, but we're there to beat teams.\"\n\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

    "description": "Who will win? Who will be the top run-scorers and wicket-takers? The Test Match Special team make their T20 World Cup predictions.",
    "fullText": "The 2026 World Cup is almost upon us.\n\nIndia are defending champions after their 2024 win and have home advantage as co-hosts alongside Sri Lanka.\n\nCan anyone stop them? And who will be the best batters and bowlers?\n\nHere are the Test Match Special team's predictions before it all gets under way on Saturday, 7 February.\n\nFormer England bowler Steven Finn: It is hard to look beyond India, but the romance of South Africa winning after how close they got to winning by reaching the 2024 final is something I would like to see.\n\nI do actually think England are dark horses to win the tournament given how well they played in Sri Lanka and the options they have.\n\nFormer England bowler Alex Hartley: No team has ever won a men's T20 World Cup on home soil, so I'm going India.\n\nFormer England bowler Tymal Mills: India will be tough to beat in their own conditions. Obviously all their players are well-accustomed to playing on those decks, so I'll go with India.\n\nEngland and Scotland bowler Kirstie Gordon: It is probably a popular answer but it is hard to look past India in their own conditions. They look incredibly strong and well balanced. I would love to see South Africa give them a scare.\n\nAs for Scotland, it is hard to say given their lack of preparation time, but they have some excellent players and will be keen to show they deserve to be there.\n\nI think they will beat Italy and Nepal but West Indies and England's firepower could be too big a hurdle.\n\nBBC cricket reporter Henry Moeran: India will be hard to beat at home, and having won the last two global white-ball events will be full of confidence.\n\nBut as we saw in the final of 2023, home pressure can sometimes be a hindrance and so many top players from around the world having Indian Premier League experience means knowledge of conditions perhaps will not be as significant.\n\nSouth Africa could be a threat having broken their hoodoo with the Test Championship win.\n\nTMS commentator Prakash Wakankar: While India will be among the favourites, the pressure will be immense.\n\nI would never write off Australia, and South Africa are really well placed with the variety in their bowling and depth in their batting.\n\nIf pressed, I would go for a repeat of the 2023 50-over final between India and Australia, but hopefully with a different result...\n\nTMS commentator Daniel Norcross: India. It is the obvious choice but that is because India come into this World Cup in formidable form and have home advantage.\n\nIn addition, if their match with Pakistan does not go ahead, they will not only pick up two points without playing a game but will also not have to leave India.\n\nTMS commentator Aatif Nawaz: Though both England and Pakistan are heading into the World Cup with strong form, getting the better of India will be a Herculean task.\n\nBBC cricket writer Matthew Henry: I was all set to try and be clever. Like before the 2023 50-over World Cup in India, Australia have lost their past two series.\n\nAt that World Cup, Australia were without Travis Head for the start. This time Josh Hazlewood was set to miss the opening weeks but now he has been ruled out entirely, they surely have little chance.\n\nICC Men's T20 World Cup - everything you need to know\n\nTrends and tactics to look for at 2026 T20 World Cup\n\nMen's T20 World Cup 2026 - fixtures\n\nFinn: England's Phil Salt. He has been outstanding in both the IPL and T20 internationals recently. Opening is the best place to bat in India and expect the top run-scorer to bat in the top two.\n\nHartley: Australia's Ashes hero Travis Head. He's become more consistent over the last 18 months and also plays with complete freedom. He does not care about getting out which will help him push the boundaries.\n\nMills: I'll go with South Africa captain Aiden Markram. He's in good form at the moment and he does well in India too.\n\nGordon: India's Abhishek Sharma. He's got a ridiculous strike-rate and has provided so much firepower at the top of the order for India recently. First World Cup. Home conditions. Are the stars aligned?\n\nMoeran: It might be his debut tournament, but Abhishek is a brilliant player and I think he will do some serious damage to bowling attacks.\n\nNorcross: Abhishek. The Indian opener is in frighteningly good form and will have plenty of opportunity to go big on friendly, run-drenched pitches at home in India.\n\nNawaz: Abhishek is the smart bet. He will open for India and doubtless hit sixes for fun. He stands head (sorry Travis!) and shoulders above everyone else in T20 cricket right now.\n\nWakankar: Head is my pick. He is just so dominant in this format. His hand-eye co-ordination is of a different level. He has been top of the pops for Sunrisers Hyderabad consistently in the IPL and knows the conditions really well.\n\nHenry: India captain Suryakumar Yadav scored 242 runs at 80.66 during the recent series win over New Zealand. One thing that could stop him may be the form of others in India's top order denying him enough time at the crease.\n\nHartley: Sherfane Rutherford. He had a great SA20 campaign with 334 runs and a strike-rate of 165. Nothing beats watching a West Indian when they get going.\n\nMills: South Africa's Dewald Brevis, who I played with recently at the SA20.\n\nObviously people know about him, but he probably hasn't really exploded in terms of international cricket just yet. He played some special innings for us.\n\nFinn: So much has been talked about Brevis from a young age and it finally feels like he has come of age. A fantastic SA20 - 370 runs and a strike-rate of 156.11 - should give him confidence.\n\nGordon: I'm going to go for New Zealand's Finn Allen. He's off the back of a great Big Bash campaign for Perth Scorchers, where he was the leading run-scorer with 466 in 11 innings. It seems like his batting has really matured in the last couple of years.\n\nNorcross: Allen is hit and miss, but if he gets going those small grounds in India won't be able to contain his monstrously destructive hitting.\n\nMoeran: Tom Banton of England looked in excellent touch with an unbeaten 54* in the second T20 in Sri Lanka and feels a very different player to his first iteration in the England side back in 2019 and 2020.\n\nHenry: Brevis is a good shout. England have seen what Pathum Nissanka, now sixth in the world T20 rankings, can do in recent weeks.\n\nNawaz: Let's go for someone a little less obvious. Wayne Madsen. Obviously Italy are unlikely to go past the group stage but the 42 year old's storied career feels like it has one more fairytale chapter in it...\n\nFinn: Kuldeep Yadav. He could clean up in the group stage, looking at India's opponents, and wrist spin is always a potent wicket threat as the tournament wears on.\n\nMills: It is hard to look past Jasprit Bumrah, an outstanding bowler across all formats but particularly within T20 and he'll obviously play a huge part in India's claim to winning the title.\n\nGordon: Australia's Nathan Ellis. A highly skilled T20 bowler who can bowl in all phases but is especially strong at the death.\n\nHe often goes under the radar in a top-quality attack but regularly bowls some of the toughest overs.\n\nMoeran: How can we look past Bumrah? He won India the tournament two years ago in the final against South Africa and will again be key. Few bowlers can do what he does, and his overs at the death will be integral.\n\nHartley: I do not like copying my friends but, as they have said, how do you look past Bumrah? I want to pick a spinner and I want that man to be Varun Chakaravarthy but I'm not sure he will play all the games.\n\nNawaz: I'm certain it will be a spinner. There are so many to chose from, but I'll go with Adam Zampa. He was one of Australia's few positives in their 3-0 hammering at the hands of Pakistan.\n\nWakankar: I expect Hardik Pandya to be that person, fitness being the only challenge. He is the key cog in the India team for sure as their main seam-bowling all-rounder.\n\nNorcross: Abrar Ahmed. A left-field pick maybe but hear me out.\n\nPakistan will play all their matches in Sri Lanka where the pitches have shown strong signs of favouring spin.\n\nThe bespectacled leg-spinner recently had the Australians in a pickle and has a great chance to bag a hatful of wickets in the opening group stage against weaker teams.\n\nHenry: The leading wicket-takers in the past three editions of the IPL have all been seamers. Always improving, always moving the new ball, I'll go with South Africa's Marco Jansen.\n\nHartley: Pakistan's Usman Tariq - not for the amount of wickets he will or won't get but the hype around his controversial bowling action.\n\nFinn: Tariq was relatively unknown until recently. Mystery spinners who burst on to the scene usually have a good first tournament, so I wouldn't be surprised to see him do well.\n\nGordon: Azmatullah Omarzai. I could have picked one of a few bowlers from Afghanistan, who I think could cause an upset in the group of death which also includes South Africa and New Zealand.\n\nA spinner might have been the common choice but Omarzai has been central to them becoming a more balanced team.\n\nMills: Maybe someone like Noor Ahmad from Afghanistan, the left-arm wrist spinner. Obviously all eyes will be on Rashid Khan but Noor is an excellent bowler in his own right as well.\n\nMoeran: South Africa quick Anrich Nortje is in fine form, taking a stack of wickets in the SA20 for Sunrisers Eastern Cape as they won the tournament. He knows the conditions, knows his game and can bowl economical and rapid spells.\n\nWakankar: I have a nagging suspicion it could be someone like Chakravarthy, given the Indian conditions.\n\nHe is deceptive and has a way of picking up wickets. His mystery element still seems to get batters in the key middle part of the innings.\n\nNawaz: Saim Ayub from Pakistan. He has established himself as a genuine all-rounder over the past 12 months and been very effective in the powerplay.\n\nI know it is a big call to go with an opening batter as bowler to watch - but that's how good he's been.\n\nNorcross: Keshav Maharaj. The South African slow left-armer is in the form of his life.\n\nA complete master of his craft, he will be desperate to go one better after South Africa's loss in the final last time around.\n\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone\n\nLive ball-by-ball commentary of every match on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra, BBC Sounds and the BBC Sport website and app, plus live texts with in-play clips and highlights.",

    "fullText": "World Skeleton champion Shelley Rudman was the star of Team GB Winter Olympics back in 2006 when she was the only one to return with a medal, creating a fever in her Wiltshire village which is still felt by some today.\n\nAs this year's Winter Olympics kicks off in northern Italy, Rudman said she would never have guessed the lasting legacy that bringing home the silver medal would have on Pewsey, where she was born and still lives.\n\nTwo streets are now named after her, Olympic Road and Silver Road, which she says makes her children very proud.\n\n\"It's a bit surreal, my children love the fact they are named after me,\" Rudman added.\n\nVillagers were invested in her success from the start. They played a key role in fundraising to send her to Turin to compete on the ice, and still proudly remember their involvement.\n\nOne of them being Emma Dainton, who along with Colin Harris, canoed a 35-mile route from Pewsey to Bath along the Kennet and Avon Canal.\n\nEmma said: \"It was so quiet on the canal until a swan chased us for a while, and we joked about it and we cheered each other on.\"\n\nDuring the Games, Emma was travelling in Australia and watched the heats on TV with her fellow backpackers.\n\n\"I told them all about Shelley and how I was part of her fundraising team and she was from my village,\" she added.\n\nBack at home, nothing could prepare landlord Jerry Kunkler for the world's media and fans cramming into his Moonrakers pub.\n\n\"My phone kept ringing and ringing, all the local and national media wanted to come to the pub, it was all happening.\n\n\"I had to get up early for breakfast TV and was able to talk to Shelley live from Turin. It was a whirlwind,\" he added.\n\nFollowing the Games, Shelley was greeted by a champion's welcome when she arrived home.\n\nLocal newspaper reporter Nigel Kerton organised an open-top bus parade to travel through the village.\n\nNigel recalls how he phoned a bus company to see if it was possible.\n\n\"I had a dream for this to happen. You see football teams do it after cup finals, so why not for Shelley.\n\n\"It left the train station and we could see the crowds building. There must have been thousands there,\" he added.\n\nShelley said she was in disbelief when she returned home and saw how many people had turned up to cheer her home.\n\n\"There were so many friends from school I recognised and just people I saw around the village,\" she said.\n\nShe added that she will always feel grateful to those that supported her and the strong community that Pewsey still has today.\n\n\"It is just stunning around here, there's a great community spirit. I always appreciate what they did for me,\" she added.\n\nFollow BBC Wiltshire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "fullText": "“It makes me sad that women’s football is sexualised and disrespected,” read Liverpool midfielder Marie Hobinger’s victim statement. “No woman, no matter her job, should have to put up with this type of behaviour.”\n\nMangal Dalal, 42, contacted Hobinger, 24, via social media before waiting for her at the side of the pitch after Liverpool’s away game against Manchester City in February 2025. He was handed a two-year restraining order and sentenced to 18 months of community service in January after pleading guilty to stalking the Austria international.\n\nThis is only one example that highlights the growing concerns around the safety of Women’s Super League (WSL) footballers. “There is that fear among players that it could happen to anyone,” Fern Whelan, women’s football equality, diversity and inclusion executive for the Professional Footballers’ Association, tells The Athletic.\n\nDuring the 2025 European Championship, England and Gotham defender Jess Carter spoke out about the racist abuse she received on the internet, later telling the BBC she feared leaving the team hotel. A 60-year-old man pleaded guilty to malicious communications in January. Mark Roberts, the national lead for football policing, called the comments “appalling”.\n\nAt the 2023 World Cup in Australia and New Zealand, when England reached the final, the Lionesses received fan mail from Australia that contained death threats. The UK football policing unit (UKFPU) conducted a joint investigation, including forensics, with Australian police, but as yet, nobody has been charged.\n\nIn January, Arsenal deleted a video on X and turned comments off on Instagram of new signing Smilla Holmberg promoting ticket sales because of inappropriate sexualised and misogynistic comments. Tottenham Hotspur also turned comments off on their X post announcing the arrival of Matilda Nilden, 19, for the same reason. Some of the replies asked X’s artificial intelligence tool Grok to produce sexualised images of the player.\n\nWe are delighted to announce that we have reached agreement for Matilda Nildén to join us from BK Häcken in January, 2026 ✍️\n\n🗞️ https://t.co/bLC1QvkmsS pic.twitter.com/xPUfesurS2\n\n— Tottenham Hotspur Women (@SpursWomen) December 31, 2025\n\n“It is really worrying,” says Whelan. “It’s difficult to manage unless it is stopped at source.”\n\nSome players have spoken about their fear of staying in their own homes after receiving rape and death threats online, Whelan told a Women and Equalities Committee held in the UK Parliament in October. Online abuse of women players, she said, has become “alarmingly worse” and “catapulted” since 2024 to the point where it is becoming “dangerous”.\n\nOther areas of concern for players include the control and management of access on matchdays, their safety when off duty, and the amount of contact they have with fans and the general public via social media.\n\nSome player representatives have put preventative measures in place, such as limiting the number of private drivers who can take a player home, to reduce how widely their addresses are known. Another noted that their players expressed no concern at all about their safety.\n\nThe UK’s All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on football has recently launched an inquiry into online harms across the men’s and women’s games. “We are clear that the women’s game faces some specific and heightened risks,” said Fair Game, secretariat to the Football APPG.\n\nThe Athletic has spoken to stakeholders within the game, including WSL Football, which oversees the top two tiers of women’s football in England; data science company Signify; and the PFA and the UKFPU to investigate how safe WSL players feel. The English Football Association was approached for comment, as were all WSL clubs.\n\nIn some incidents detailed below, clubs in question remain anonymous to respect the confidentiality of their security arrangements.\n\nThe message may read: “I know where you park your car”, “I know what car you drive”, or “I know where you live”. Whether genuine or not, such messages force players to judge the level of threat.\n\nWomen’s football is in a period of generational transition. The increased investment and global broadcast exposure have seen a fundamental shift in the game’s profile, especially in England, following the Lionesses’ consecutive European triumphs in 2022 and 2025. All publicity, however, is not good publicity.\n\nHistorically, women’s football has leaned into accessibility — players signing autographs, taking photos and engaging closely with supporters. As the game’s profile has grown, that openness has created tension between connection and safety.\n\n“It is becoming increasingly difficult for elite-level women’s players to embrace fan access to the same levels as has been the case historically,” says Jonathan Sebire, co-founder at Signify, which works across multiple sports and with several WSL clubs to collect, triage and assess the threat online abuse poses to players.\n\nThe majority of online abuse players receive contains sexual elements, according to Signify, including sexualised content of the individual player or their partner. Other categories of online abuse include racist and violent threats, the latter of which often contains a sexualised element. Some abuse, particularly from male online users, centres on the quality of the women’s game, but there is another concern, says Signify, that has increased far more rapidly.\n\n“One of the fundamental differences in the women’s game is there are openly gay players, some of whom are in relationships with other footballers, some of whom are at the same club,” says Sebire.\n\n“We see a large number of young women who look up to these players because of their sexuality. They’re seen as openly gay icons and role models in the sport. It starts with a level of fandom that has sometimes tipped over into fixation, infatuation and developed into something more problematic.”\n\nSuch behaviour is not exclusively linked to sexuality, but most cases known directly to Signify fall into this category.\n\nIn some rare instances, but increasing in occurrence, people have followed players around supermarkets and visited the same bars or restaurants as them. Contact can start online and move offline or vice versa. For example, players have reported people making contact via direct messages online and then seeing them appear in their local surroundings.\n\n“It’s not uncommon,” says Sebire. “If you speak to a group of players, some will almost certainly have experienced it.”\n\nSignify observes that often the behaviour does not involve physical contact or direct interaction. Instead, it centres on attempts to create the appearance of a relationship for others to see — for example, by taking selfies of themselves with players in the background. They then message players later online to suggest a personal connection.\n\n“If they’re doing that every week, that has become an infatuation,” says Sebire. “In most cases, when the club or police warn them and tell them this behaviour is problematic, it stops because they are shocked it has been noticed and received in that way.”\n\nIn other extreme cases, players have suspected a person was tracking their car’s movements, as they appeared wherever the players went. Clubs have sanctioned season-ticket holders, and law enforcement agencies have carried out risk assessments in response.\n\nThe answer, though, is not for women players to simply abstain from social media. “It is not their responsibility; they are just doing their jobs,” says Whelan.\n\nMany women’s players, after all, earn significantly more through off-field commercial deals than via playing contracts. Social media is a critical tool for connecting with fans, building personal profiles, and securing sponsorship income.\n\nIt is also far more likely that women’s players still run their own social media accounts, whereas in the men’s game, certainly among Premier League stars, others tend to manage players’ online profiles. According to Sebire, that is something that needs to and is starting to change.\n\nIt is also very different for a WSL player, who may live a relatively ‘normal’ life, to receive a threatening message than perhaps a Premier League footballer who lives in a house with significant security provisions and perhaps access to a private chef or barber. Premier League clubs also have established onboarding processes for their players, with, for example, security briefings including dedicated services for players’ properties.\n\nThat does not negate the impact of online abuse for a men’s player, but it is important context to consider, even if some WSL players are now household names.\n\n“In some clubs, the infrastructure around women’s teams’ safety is catching up with the men’s game,” says Sebire. “But it has not been universal. Those are fundamentals that have to change for women’s players to feel safe.”\n\nThe nature of the online abuse suffered by women’s players is often different, too. Unlike violent or racist abuse, it does not necessarily fit into a clearly defined category with reporting mechanisms, policies and consequences.\n\nThe Online Safety Act, fully enforced as of 2025, means OFCOM, the UK’s independent regulator for the communications industries, can take action against social media platforms, including removing content or working with law enforcement. But there are nuances to the women’s game that need to be considered.\n\nSome platforms do not recognise a lot of the abuse and threat directed at women because universal language, such as “kitchen” — referring, for example, to the misogynistic phrase ‘Get back in the kitchen’ — is repurposed or not seen as harmful without the necessary context.\n\nThe AI tool Grok is another example. X has now prevented Grok from being used to edit images of real people in revealing clothing after OFCOM launched an investigation in January. The public body Sport England decided to stop using X last month to stay true to its values of the “mission is to ensure sport and physical activity are safe and inclusive for everyone,” it said in a statement. WSL Football had already scaled back its use of X, and some WSL clubs have said they continue to monitor the situation.\n\nAnother growing pain for WSL clubs is the contrast between playing games at the women’s home grounds and the main club’s stadia.\n\nIt is easier for the club to use the same security infrastructure at a Premier League ground when their women’s team plays there, but when switching to smaller grounds, there are different security measures around the pitch, players’ entrance, or car park.\n\n“It’s safer in general to be at the Emirates,” England captain and Arsenal defender Leah Williamson told the New Statesman in December. “You’re more accessible. It’s a five-metre difference (between the players and fans).”\n\nSome players have reported concerns of being repeatedly approached by the same people outside stadiums and hassled as they approach their cars.\n\n“If players make themselves accessible signing autographs in the ground with stewards but are approached once they leave the ground, when do they say: ‘No, this isn’t appropriate?” asks one person. “That feels like an invasion of space.”\n\nSupporter interaction has become increasingly challenging as attendances have increased. WSL Football, WSL clubs and the English Football Association are trying to balance maintaining the game’s unique atmosphere and sense of community while grappling with a rapidly changing landscape.\n\nAhead of the 2024-2025 season, Chelsea changed their player access rules before and after games, citing it was “no longer safe or sustainable” for players to sign autographs or take selfies “in an uncontrolled way”. Many clubs followed suit. Some now have more organised meet-and-greets with season-ticket holders in a controlled environment, while others have close-protection officers pitchside. When on England duty, players walk around the pitch after games but do not stop and sign autographs.\n\n“It would be a shame if it got shut down to the extent that the men’s game has,” says Sebire. “But the risk is there.”\n\nClubs are taking player safety seriously, according to numerous people, and are investing to try to keep players safe. “Everybody is just trying to find a way through,” comments one observer.\n\nWSL Football’s safeguarding standards require that each “club ensures that physical and online environments promote safety and wellbeing while minimising the opportunity for children, adults at risk and players to be harmed and/or exposed to harmful or inappropriate behaviour, materials or content”.\n\nEach club undertakes its own risk assessments and all clubs in the top two leagues have a nominated police officer. WSL Football has its own safety and security working group and regularly engages with the UKFPU and clubs via monthly safety officer meetings.\n\nThe FA and several WSL clubs, including Arsenal, Chelsea, London City Lionesses, Aston Villa and Tottenham Hotspur, say they have robust security provisions and educational resources. Some employ dedicated safeguarding, player care and close-protection measures, alongside partnerships with external monitoring firms, while others have players escorted at matches and events, administer online safety training, and have formal reporting routes.\n\nThe biggest barrier to prosecution a few years ago was obtaining player statements. “With the national teams, we’ve certainly broken through that,” Chief Constable for Cheshire Police Mark Roberts tells The Athletic.\n\nNow, the UKFPU prepares players by explaining the reporting process proactively, and before tournaments, officers conduct security briefings and education sessions with the England team to offer advice regarding security and online abuse.\n\n“Don’t just delete it, try to keep it,” says Roberts. “We’ll capture it, try to identify the person, ask for a statement, and give the player support. It’s the shock of receiving something and making sure they know what to do. If you debunk the system, hopefully it makes it easier for people to come forward.”\n\nSignify has found that in some of their education sessions, players may understandably find it embarrassing to talk about their experiences, whether it’s the content of the material or that it has affected them. Often, individuals report incidents in private after group sessions.\n\n“If anything is happening in places that no one else can see, tell someone about it because you shouldn’t be dealing with this on your own,” says Sebire. “It’s not OK.”\n\nNikki Doucet, CEO of WSL Football, has spoken with Meta’s global head of safety and the Women’s National Basketball Association about the tools they use. She recently met at UK Parliament with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport’s Women’s Sport Taskforce, hosted by minister Stephanie Peacock, alongside representatives from OFCOM, the police, and other sports leaders to discuss protections for sportswomen online.\n\n“It is top of the PFA’s agenda, including pushing the clubs to see how we can protect the players better,” says Whelan, adding that online abuse is a “massive barrier” to participation for many young girls and parents.\n\n“It is not football that is the problem; it is the perpetrators behind it all,” she adds. “We have to make sure the people who are looking after the footballers are taking it really seriously. I would hate for it to come to a point where those threats become reality, and then we act.\n\n“Everyone is working hard behind the scenes to find a solution. Clubs are aware of the concerns the players have raised. There is a real shift; players are not going to stand for this. The more we see perpetrators held to account, the more they are emboldened.”\n\nAdditional reporting: Philip Buckingham\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Athletic.\n\nArsenal, Chelsea, Manchester City, England, Women's Soccer, Culture\n\n2026 The Athletic Media Company",
