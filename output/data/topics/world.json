    "description": "F1 travels the world, yet some venues draw criticism for dull races and awkward layouts. Fans weigh in on the circuits that frustrate drivers and viewers.",
    "fullText": "Very few sports generate as much thrill as Formula 1. Seeing the fastest drivers in the fastest cars in the world going flat out for what's now 24 weekends a year remains arguably the greatest spectacle in all of motorsport, but there are a few important factors that determine whether that's achieved on a regular basis. The biggest talking point for modern F1 is that the cars themselves aren't great for wheel-to-wheel racing, which is certainly a fair argument. The new regulations are designed to help promote close action, so hopefully we won't need to have that discussion as often going forward.\n\nEqually as important for generating competitive racing, though, are the tracks that they race on. As mentioned, F1 races at 24 different locations, with a wide variety of track styles present on the calendar. Before the season even starts, there are a few circuits that fans look forward to, for example, Silverstone and Interlagos. However, F1 has to follow the biggest and longest contracts to decide which tracks to race on, which aren't always best suited for the pinnacle of open-wheel racing. Fans of the sport don't hold back on their views of some of these circuits, and based on posts online, there's consistency regarding which ones are the most disliked. Looking at the wide array of posts on forum sites such as Reddit, here's a look at five tracks that are often a talking point for all the wrong reasons.\n\nEven if NASCAR has remained at the top of American motorsport, Formula One has long had a presence in the U.S., hosting races at iconic tracks such as Indianapolis, as well as various street circuits like Dallas, Detroit, and, most recently, Las Vegas. While the Circuit of the Americas in Austin has been on the calendar since 2012, Vegas was introduced in response to the recent surge in popularity of the pinnacle of open-wheel racing. A year earlier, the Miami International Autodrome was constructed around Hard Rock Stadium.\n\nAs one of the hybrid street-style circuits, Miami incorporates quite a few different elements from established tracks, with Sector 1 full of sweeping fast turns, followed by a long back straight before the incredibly tight beginning of Sector 3. It might sound good, but the layout is restricted by the stadium grounds to a significant degree. Compared to the tracks it takes inspiration from, many fans feel that it's terrible for actual racing, with the flow constantly being interrupted. Reddit users go as far as to say the Miami Autodrome is \"utterly soulless.\"\n\nThe Lusail International Circuit is one of the more unique venues for F1 at the moment, albeit for a different reason than any other track. First used in 2004, the Qatar track was designed for MotoGP. Of course, MotoGP bikes are massively different to control than an F1 car, with next to no downforce and an emphasis on rider balance and corner exits. As a result, the track features a variety of corners that are long and swooping on a MotoGP bike, promoting great side-by-side action. But for F1, the cars go through these sections so fast that it's a challenge to remain close to the car in front.\n\nIn DestinationFormula1's collection of fan feedback, this was a big issue that fans had with the Lusail circuit. Hopefully, the upcoming 2026 regulations can help solve this by reducing the dirty air given off by cars, but we'll have to wait and see. Similar to Miami, users on Reddit use the word \"soulless\" again to describe the track, but with MotoGP often providing thrilling action here, it just doesn't seem to be as well suited for four-wheeled cars.\n\nThe second Middle Eastern track featured here, the Yas Marina Circuit, has hosted the final race of the season since 2010 and has been on the calendar since 2009. Over the years, we've been treated to some thrilling title deciders at the Abu Dhabi track, many of which have been some of the most memorable races of those seasons. However, it's not necessarily the track itself that generates the excitement, with fans often finding races at Yas Marina to be lackluster when there's nothing at stake.\n\nFor the 2021 season, changes were made to the circuit in a bid to improve racing, namely the removal of two of the stop-start chicanes in Sectors 1 and 2 that some fans felt completely ruined the flow of the circuit. But still, the main overtaking zones remain the two long straights, which start after two corners that modern F1 cars struggle to follow closely through. Outside of the racing itself, other fans are also critical of the track because of the lack of atmosphere. The Abu Dhabi GP is very much intended to be a spectacle, but it doesn't exactly match the feel you get at Monza, Silverstone, or Zandvoort, for example.\n\nWhile other tracks on this list have been added to the sport quite recently, the calendar is also packed with venues that have essentially become staples of F1. Some of these tracks are ones that fans believe shouldn't ever be taken out, and the same can be said for all of them. The Spanish Grand Prix has taken place at the Circuit De Barcelona Catalunya ever since its introduction in 1991, and it instantly made a great impression with Senna and Mansell going wheel to wheel down the main straight. As F1 has developed over the years to become faster and faster, though, the track hasn't managed to keep up.\n\nCircuit De Barcelona Catalunya has just about every corner type you could have on a modern circuit, which makes it no surprise that it's used extensively for testing. But for actual racing, the never-ending flow of corners creates what one Reddit user calls \"stalemate racing.\" The removal of the final chicane has allowed cars to follow better down the straight, but in general, that's a pretty fair description. This is another track that'll hopefully reap the benefits of the smaller cars in 2026.\n\nAnd now for, without a doubt, the most controversial track in Formula 1, Circuit de Monaco. The Monte Carlo street track is one of four current tracks that were used for the inaugural season back in 1950, alongside Silverstone, Spa-Francorchamps, and Monza. Due to this, the history that Monaco holds for F1 can't be denied. But because of how big F1 cars are now, the opportunities for overtaking are virtually non-existent. It's been like this for decades, though, with Mansell finding no way past Senna despite having much fresher tires in 1992.\n\nQualifying has always been Monaco's moment to shine. The constant risk of crashing makes it a thrilling watch, and drivers such as Fernando Alonso call it \"one of the best moments of the season\" when speaking to ESPN. On race day, though, fans think the street circuit is simply \"not suited for modern racing,\" as one Reddit user puts it. For the 2025 race, two pit stops were made mandatory, but all that did was make drivers back each other up to open a pit window for their teammates. The heritage, combined with the challenge, makes it one of the races that drivers want to win more than most, but from the outside, the heritage is the only thing that keeps it on the calendar.\n\nWant the latest in tech and auto trends?

    "fullText": "International Olympic Committee president Kirsty Coventry says it must \"be better\" on climate change after receiving a petition signed by more than 21,000 people who want to stop fossil fuel companies from sponsoring winter sports.\n\nThe petition - delivered on Wednesday and with athletes among the signatories - comes as Italy's Eni, one of the world's seven biggest oil companies, is a 'premium partner' of the Milan-Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics.\n\nIt follows reports that the number of countries which could reliably host a Winter Olympics will hugely reduce in the future because of climate change.\n\nAsked by the BBC whether she is disappointed by the Games having high-carbon sponsors, Coventry said: \"It's really nice athletes have a platform to speak up.\n\n\"The petition, I know they met with our team today and we are having conversations in order to be better, and for our stakeholders to be better. But that takes time.\"\n\nChristophe Dubi, the IOC executive director for the Olympic Games, added: \"We make a point to receive those petitions, and we have to recognise climate is a challenge for all of us.\n\n\"What we have to do as an organisation is to be at the forefront of sustainability, and our principles are very clear.\"\n\nOne area the IOC is aiming to make the Olympics more sustainable is having Games take place over a wider area with more pre-existing facilities, and Coventry said Milan-Cortina is an acid test for whether this is a viable future.\n\nMilan-Cortina takes place in three hubs spread across northern Italy - in Milan, Cortina and Livigno - with only two newly built sporting facilities: the Santagiulia ice hockey arena and Cortina Sliding Centre.\n\nThe next two Winter Olympics - French Alps 2030 and Utah 2034 - will also have sports spread more widely, while the 2032 Summer Olympics in Brisbane is will have venues across Queensland.\n\nThis has caused issues however, with Brisbane organisers saying, external they will go beyond the originally stated budget of $4.9bn (£3.6bn).\n\n\"We are really experiencing a spread out Games here for the first time - we are going to learn a lot,\" Coventry said.\n\n\"We have taken this decision for sustainability reasons, climate and not having to have new venues. We are seeing there is an impact on National Olympic Committees because of the spreadness [sic], also for broadcast and media, making it harder to get around.\n\n\"What is really cool is that you get to see iconic venues in beautiful places - but now we have to weigh this up, the balance between a spread games for sustainability reasons but not shifting complexity and sustainability to different areas.\"\n\nWhile the action got underway on Wednesday with the start of the curling events, the 2026 Winter Olympics will officially start with the opening ceremony on Friday.\n\nCoventry said she hoped all nations would be treated with respect by spectators, including the USA team amid criticism from Italian authorities about the presence of ICE agents in Milan.\n\n\"I hope the opening ceremony is seen by everyone as a chance to be respectful,\" she said.\n\n\"For me, when we went to the Olympic village that is the best reminder of how the Games should be. I hope the opening ceremony will do that.\"\n\nFear and Hall named 2026 Team GB flagbearers\n\nRussian athletes linked to pro-war activity\n\nQuiz: Name every sport at the 2026 Winter Olympics",

The longtime NBA veteran recently spoke candidly about Bad Bunny and his music, offering a personal perspective as the Super Bowl LX halftime show approaches.\n\nDurant appeared on Kay Adams’ Up and Adams podcast on Wednesday, where he shared that he has not listened to any of Bad Bunny’s songs. When the former NFL Network reporter asked Durant, “I want to know how you’re doing?” he replied, “Doing better. We’ll see in the morning.” Later, when Adams said, “Well enough to like to dance to Bad Bunny, [Super Bowl] halftime?” Durant simply confessed, “I haven’t listened to Bad Bunny before.”\n\nKay Adams: \"I want to know how you're doing?\"\n\nKevin Durant: \"Doing better.

His albums, including ‘YHLQMDLG’, ‘El Último Tour del Mundo’, and ‘Un Verano Sin Ti’, were huge hits. His ‘Un Verano Sin Ti’ especially made history because a Spanish-language album became one of the most popular in the United States and worldwide.\n\nBut some NFL fans are unhappy about Bad Bunny performing at the Super Bowl. He has been outspoken on social and political issues, especially about U.S. immigration policies and ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement).\n\nHe made a high-profile speech at the 2026 Grammys condemning ICE actions and calling for empathy toward immigrants, which upset many conservative viewers.

The software sector led a tech-sell-off with the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF down nearly 4%, adding to its year-to-date 22% loss.\n\nBut Wall Street's fears about further disruption from AI were brushed aside by one of the icons of the AI space on Tuesday. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang weighed in on the latest jitters at a Cisco AI event.\n\n\"There's this notion that the tool industry is in decline and will be replaced by AI. You could tell because there's a whole bunch of software companies whose stock prices are under a lot of pressure because somehow AI is going to replace them. It is the most illogical thing in the world and time will prove itself.\"\n\nHuang outlined his view that software is a tool for AI to use, rather than replace, explaining that AI will use the tools software offers rather than reinventing its own.\n\nThe CEO named Service Now, SAP, Cadence, and Synopsis, specifically as bright spots in the space.\n\nRecent weakness in the software sector comes amid a broader market rotation away from tech. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF has seen a nearly 20% decline in the past year, and the sector fell into a bear market last week.\n\nHere are some of the stocks dragging the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF lower during Wednesday's session:",

    "description": "As the adoption of AI to provide customer service accelerates, managers would be well advised to remember that the human touch still matters.  Drawing on examples from Ritz‑Carlton and Four Seasons, the authors show how hospitality is rooted in dignity, purpose, and employee judgment—not scripts or efficiency metrics. Leaders should empower staff, measure what truly matters for connection, and select employees for their natural inclination to care. Deep hospitality requires discipline and an ethos that treats people—not processes—as the point, creating relationships that differentiate a brand.",

    "fullText": "Defending champion Neil Robertson and world number one Judd Trump were among a number of high-profile players knocked out in the first round of the World Grand Prix in Hong Kong.\n\nJohn Higgins, Shaun Murphy and Mark Allen were also beaten, although seven-time world champion Ronnie O'Sullivan avoided a similar fate.\n\nO'Sullivan recovered from a slow start to beat Joe O'Connor 5-3.\n\nAfter fighting back from 2-0 down, O'Sullivan levelled the match before losing the fifth frame to slip behind again.\n\nBut two breaks of 72 enabled O'Sullivan to take a 4-3 lead, before he wrapped up the match with a fine cut on the pink.\n\n\"I don't think a lack of sharpness is my problem because I have always played less tournaments than other players,\" said O'Sullivan.\n\n\"I think my bad game is a lot worse than it used to be, and my good is not as good. That's the reason I am not winning as much.\n\n\"I am probably not a very good player any more and I have to accept that. I am trying to find a way to keep playing without it driving me crazy.\n\n\"I posted about Novak Djokovic the other day. He is the best in any sport at managing emotions and we all try to be like him, but it's not easy.\"\n\nO'Sullivan will play Xiao Guodong, who beat Kyren Wilson on Tuesday, in the second round on Thursday as he continues his bid for a record-extending 42nd title.\n\nWorld number three Robertson entered the tournament in good form after reaching the semi-finals of the German Masters last week, but failed to carry his momentum into the first-round tie with Jak Jones as he lost 5-1.\n\nRobertson started well with a break of 46, but a missed red handed the initiative to Jones, who went on to open up a 2-0 lead.\n\nA break of 88 helped Robertson fight back briefly to win the third frame, but Jones took control afterwards, triumphing in the next three to ease into the second round.\n\nThe match in Hong Kong took place only three and a half days after Robertson's 6-1 defeat by Shaun Murphy in Berlin, with the Australian cutting a frustrated figure throughout.\n\nFormer World Championship finalist Jones will play Zhou Yuelong in the second round on Thursday.\n\nGerman Masters winner Trump was beaten by Yuan Sijun, who knocked in a 103 in the first frame as he went 2-0 up.\n\nTrump took the third and fifth frames but Yuan stood firm to secure a 5-2 victory and a match against Ali Carter, who beat Allen 5-4.\n\nHiggins beat world champion Zhao Xintong on the way to the Masters final last month but, this time, was beaten 5-3 by the Chinese player, who set up a match against Mark Selby.\n\nMurphy lost 5-1 to China's Pang Junxu, who made breaks of 134 and 130 on the way to victory.\n\nOverall, nine Chinese players have reached the last 16, a record for any ranking event.",

    "fullText": "The men's T20 World Cup starts on Saturday against a backdrop of political tension.\n\nThe tournament, which features 20 teams, will be held in India and Sri Lanka.\n\nBangladesh are boycotting it after a request for their fixtures to be switched from India to Sri Lanka was refused by the sport's governing body.\n\nTheir place in Group C has been taken by Scotland.\n\nPakistan had considered boycotting but have since confirmed they will take part, though will not play their scheduled match against India.\n\nBangladesh had asked for their games to be switched from India, citing safety concerns amid growing tensions between the countries.\n\nRelations between the South Asian neighbours have soured since former Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina fled to India in 2024, following deadly protests.\n\nIndia has not agreed to send her back despite several requests, and violent protests broke out after Sharif Osman Hadi - a prominent student leader in Bangladesh - was shot dead.\n\nIndia itself has raised concerns over violence targeting members of the minority Hindu community in Bangladesh.\n\nIn December, a Hindu man was accused of blasphemy and beaten to death by a mob in an incident that resulted in protests by Hindu nationalist groups in India.\n\nAgainst that political backdrop, Indian Premier League (IPL) side Kolkata Knight Riders released Bangladesh bowler Mustafizur Rahman in January after being instructed to do so by the Board of Control for Cricket in India.\n\nIn response, Bangladeshi authorities banned broadcasts of the IPL in the country.\n\nThe Bangladesh Cricket Board then requested that their World Cup fixtures be played in Sri Lanka.\n\nThe International Cricket Council - the sport's governing body - rejected that request, saying there was an \"absence of any credible security threat\" and gave the BCB a final 24 hours in which to declare their participation.\n\nWhen that deadline passed, Scotland were invited to the tournament.\n\nThe ICC said it was keen not to establish \"precedents that could undermine the neutrality and fairness of ICC events\".\n\nPakistan are boycotting their match against India, which was scheduled to take place in Colombo, Sri Lanka, on 15 February.\n\nIn a statement, the Pakistan government said it granted \"approval\" to the team's participation in the tournament but they \"shall not take to the field\" for the match against India.\n\nPakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Mohsin Naqvi previously said the team could pull out completely after Bangladesh were removed from the tournament.\n\nPakistan and India have not faced each other outside men's major tournaments since 2013, and India have not played in Pakistan since 2008.\n\nPakistan did not host any touring nations between 2009 and 2019 following the Lahore attack on Sri Lanka's team bus, which killed six policemen and two civilians.\n\nPakistani players have also been banned from the IPL since 2009 following the Mumbai attacks that left 174 people - including nine gunmen - dead.\n\nLast year India refused to travel to Pakistan to play in the Champions Trophy and eventually played their matches in the United Arab Emirates.\n\nIt resulted in the two nations signing an agreement stating the two countries would play at neutral venues whenever one of them hosts an ICC event.\n\nThe neighbours have fought a number of wars and had several military stand-offs since the partition of India in 1947, when the nation was split into India and the new state of Pakistan. It created an upsurge of violence, in which approximately 15 million people were displaced and an estimated one million died.\n\nRecent escalations were sparked after the neighbours engaged in a four-day military conflict in April 2025 following a deadly militant attack on tourists in India-administered Kashmir.\n\nThe ICC said Pakistan's stance was \"difficult to reconcile\" and called on the country's cricket chiefs to explore a \"mutually acceptable resolution\".\n\nThe governing body said that \"selective participation undermines the spirit and sanctity of the competitions\".\n\nIt said it \"respects the roles of governments in matters of national policy\" but continued: \"This decision is not in the interest of the global game or the welfare of fans worldwide, including millions in Pakistan.\"\n\nIt added it hoped the PCB would \"consider the significant and long-term implications for cricket in its own country\".\n\nFormer Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi is among those who have accused the ICC of mishandling the situation.\n\nIn a post on X, he said: \"It's regrettable that Pakistan won't play India, but I stand behind my government's decision.\n\n\"This is the moment for the ICC to lead and prove through decisions, not statements, that it is impartial, independent and fair to every member.\"\n\nMatches between Pakistan and India can draw huge TV audiences.\n\nReportedly, more than 600 million people watched last year's Champions Trophy fixture on Indian streaming platform JioHotstar.\n\nThe ICC has not published its playing conditions for the tournament so it is not known what sanction Pakistan could face.\n\nHowever, the rules for the previous tournament stated: \"If the match is decided by one side conceding defeat or refusing to play, the result shall be stated as match conceded or match awarded, as the case may be.\"\n\nIt is assumed India will be awarded two points for a win and Pakistan's net run-rate will also be hit by the forfeiture.\n\nPakistan face the Netherlands, USA and Namibia in their other group-stage games, and it is unclear what could happen if they were to face India in the final.\n\nTeams have pulled out of tournament fixtures before, with Australia and the West Indies both deciding not to travel to Colombo in the 1996 World Cup that was co-hosted by India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.\n\nEngland also decided not to play their 2003 World Cup match against Zimbabwe in Harare, citing security concerns and social unrest in the country.\n\nNone of those nations received a subsequent fine or punishment from the ICC, though all forfeited the matches.\n\nBoth Pakistan and Bangladesh could receive other sanctions as the ICC has a precedent for punishing governments who interfere in the game.\n\nUnder article 2.4 of the ICC constitution, it outlines boards must manage their affairs \"autonomously and ensure that there is no government (or other public or quasi-public body) interference in its governance, regulation and/or administration of cricket\".\n\nIn 2019, Zimbabwe were suspended for three months after the government replaced the cricket board, leading to a freeze on funding and exclusion from World Cup qualifiers.\n\nFour years later, Sri Lanka also lost the right to host the Under-19 World Cup after its government dismissed the national board following poor performances.\n\nBoth nations later had their ICC membership restored.\n\nThis article is the latest from BBC Sport's Ask Me Anything team.\n\nICC Men's T20 World Cup - everything you need to know\n\nWho owns the teams competing in The Hundred?\n\nWhat is the 'designated batters' rule introduced by Big Bash League?",

    "fullText": "Reigning world champion and world number one Luke Littler says Phil Taylor is still the greatest darts player of all-time after Luke Humphries said the youngster deserved the title.\n\nLittler became the joint-third most successful player in the Professional Darts Corporation (PDC) era of the sport by beating Humphries in the final of the Masters on Sunday night.\n\nIt led to 2024 world champion Humphries calling the 19-year-old \"the greatest darts player who has ever lived\", although Littler disagrees with that claim.\n\n\"It's really good to hear but I'm not one of those to go off and say 'yeah, I am the best' because I'm not the best,\" said Littler.\n\n\"Phil Taylor will always be the best, unless I somehow win more than him, and what he's done for the sport. So we can only see what happens in my career.\n\n\"Unless I go on and win 16 worlds and 16 Matchplays, or 17 then I'll get one over him then I'll be the best, but until someone breaks his records then he'll always be the best.\"\n\nLittler beats Humphries to win first World Masters\n\nWho is playing in Premier League Darts 2026 and what is the schedule?\n\nLittler's triumph at the Masters in Milton Keynes put him level with James Wade on 11 major PDC titles, behind only Michael van Gerwen who has 48 and 16-time world champion Taylor who has 79.\n\nAddressing his post-Masters comments at the 2026 Premier League launch, Humphries admitted he could have worded his praise of Littler differently.\n\n\"I said it in the moment, but I still stand by it, I'm not going to backtrack on it,\" said Humphries.\n\n\"Using the words 'the greatest', maybe what I meant to say was that he's the most talented player ever.\n\n\"Phil achieved so much, it's harsh not calling him the greatest, so maybe I used the wrong term, but I definitely stand by the fact that I think he's (Littler) the most talented darts player ever.\n\n\"Not just his ability to throw good darts, it's his temperament, his way of being so good under pressure, he has all of the credentials.\"\n\nGian van Veen - who lost to Littler in the 2026 World Championship final - feels Littler will continue to be the dominant force in darts for years to come.\n\nSpeaking ahead of his debut campaign in the Premier League, the Dutchman said: \"I think Luke Littler is still going to be on top of the world in five or 10 years.\n\n\"He's not unstoppable, but he's not shown too much signs of being stoppable.\"\n\nPremier League Darts 2026 fixtures, results and table\n\nLittler suggested influencer and close friend Angry Ginge will compete at qualifying school to earn a darts tour card in the future.\n\n\"I didn't go through Q-school, so I don't know what it's like to play in there, but I see some of the results every year when people are losing to 105 averages,\" said Littler.\n\n\"For Ginge himself, if he gets the luck of the draw, he could win a few games.\n\n\"But if he wants to do a few hours a day constantly, he'd obviously get better himself. We'll see him at Q-school one day.\"\n\nIt comes after two-time world champion Gary Anderson branded the involvement of certain influencers in darts as \"a load of rubbish\".\n\nSpeaking during the Masters, Anderson said: \"I don't [watch] YouTube, but I'm watching - what do you call them? - influencers. 'How to play darts' - I've never seen the bloke in my life.\n\n\"I've watched him play darts, he's absolutely rank at it, so why watch him?\n\n\"Who is he? They're actually pros and they actually know about darts, do they?\n\n\"It's a load of rubbish. So for young kids, it ain't good.\"\n\nBut Littler defended those who boast a significant social media following and are looking to make the crossover into darts.\n\n\"They're just trying aren't they,\" Littler said.\n\n\"They're trying to throw darts, trying to create a following and obviously most of them have got a few sponsors.\"",

    "description": "Scotland players tell BBC Sport their mental health suffered after they were told their contracts would end following the World Cup.",
    "fullText": "When Scotland left the pitch following their gutsy 2025 Women's Rugby World Cup quarter-final defeat by England, for some of the squad it was a moment of pride that marked how far the team had come.\n\nFor others the full-time whistle signalled the end of an emotionally damaging tournament from which some say they are still struggling to recover.\n\nReaching the last eight was the team's best performance at a World Cup in 23 years.\n\nHowever, players have since told BBC Sport that behind the scenes Scottish Rugby's management of player contracts before the tournament left them in \"probably the worst case of mental health\" they had ever had, with one saying she suffered a breakdown as a result.\n\n\"I had an actual real-life breakdown in club to one of my coaches,\" she said.\n\n\"I've been put on medication for depression because of the impact that it's had on me.\"\n\nAnother said: \"I came back from the World Cup in a hole, a shell of myself.\"\n\nIn response, Scottish Rugby said the union was \"aware of the potential challenges players faced in their mental health during this time\" and that a package of support was put in place.\n\n\"We would not question the personal experience of an individual athlete,\" the union's response continued.\n\n\"We would, however, dispute the lack of care referenced.\"\n\nBBC Sport spoke to four players involved in the World Cup and one who was in the wider Scotland training squad. Contributors wished to remain anonymous out of fear of jeopardising their future in the sport.\n\nPlayers said their contracts were due for renewal in June 2025, two months before the World Cup began in August, and that they had asked for 12-month deals beyond that to ensure job security and so they could focus on their performances at the tournament.\n\nHowever, according to those contacted, while some players in Scotland's 32-player World Cup squad were given 12-month contracts in May 2025, a quarter were told their deals would end in October, a decision one player described as a \"big shock\".\n\nAt the time, contracts ranged from £18,000 to £27,000 and in most cases were the player's main source of income. Those playing in the Premiership could also earn up to about £10,000 from their club contracts.\n\nThe players who spoke to BBC Sport said that having to compete at the World Cup knowing their jobs and international careers were potentially about to come to an end put them under huge mental strain.\n\nThey also said they were not given the proper support by Scottish Rugby to cope with the situation.\n\nSome of those who were told they would lose their funding after October had been part of the Scotland team for many years and were regularly starting international matches.\n\nOne said that \"despite clear signs\" that some were suffering with the news, \"no transitional help\" was offered by Scottish Rugby.\n\nAnother said she spent downtime between World Cup matches searching for a job.\n\nIn 2025 Scottish Rugby said it would increase the number of contracts available to players from 32 to 35 for the 2025-26 season.\n\nOne player said \"everybody understands contracts aren't going to be guaranteed every year\", before questioning why Scottish Rugby did not provide access to career advisors or psychologists for those affected.\n\nAnother added: \"It's not about contracts. It's not about resources. It's literally about treating people like human beings.\"\n\nScottish Rugby's response stated that psychological support was embedded in Scotland camps and available to all players regardless of contract status.\n\nIt said a player development manager supported players on off-field matters, including employment, and that exit meetings were held at the end of contracts to identify any potential physical or psychological support that may be needed.\n\nAsked if she felt Scottish Rugby had failed in its duty of care to players, one player responded \"without a doubt\" and referenced the death of international Siobhan Cattigan aged 26 in 2021.\n\n\"How many people need to die before you take it seriously?\" she added, addressing Scottish Rugby. \"You've clearly not learned.\"\n\nCattigan's family said undetected rugby-related brain damage caused a \"catastrophic decline\" in her health and led to her death.\n\nIn 2023 Scottish Rugby said it \"let down\" Cattigan's family and chairman John McGuigan apologised \"wholeheartedly for any anguish we caused Siobhan during her time with Scottish Rugby\".\n\nMcGuigan added at the time: \"We have listened and heeded the lessons and, in Siobhan's memory, commit to making changes to ensure we are a better organisation in the future.\"\n\nAnother player said the communication of selection decisions left her \"unbelievably unwell\", adding: \"There are loads of harsh realities of elite sport: injury and non-selection. How you manage people is more important than ever.\n\n\"You can't treat people like they're just disposable, regardless of the elite sport wheel being a forever turning one.\n\n\"We still need to have empathy. And I just didn't feel like there was much at all.\"\n\nScottish Rugby's response to this story said: \"We are very uncomfortable with this comparison to Siobhan's own tragic situation and the inference in any way that we were negligent in our support to her.\"\n\nPlayers told BBC Sport that the squad discussed boycotting one match during the 2025 Women's Six Nations - five months before the World Cup began - to try to reach a resolution with Scottish Rugby on its request for 12-month contracts.\n\nAll the players contacted say they were told contract decisions were based on performance and that they may still get a new contract should they perform well at the tournament, adding further pressure.\n\n\"It literally was a do or die lifeline,\" one player said.\n\n\"It's like I need to do everything I can on this rugby pitch, otherwise I'm not going to have a job and I'm going to struggle to pay my rent.\n\n\"When you're not sleeping, you don't have an appetite. You're just miserable most of the day. It's really hard to then put in a performance or do yourself justice.\"\n\nScottish Rugby's response said that players were told \"on a number of occasions that their standalone playing performance at the World cup was not the sole criteria for any possible change to their contract situation\".\n\nTold her contract would end in October, one player said she was on job search websites \"most nights\" during the tournament looking for jobs \"that were appropriate\" for her life as a club rugby player.\n\nShe said: \"Before you even started a job, you're trying to bargain and speak with a new employer and be like, 'Can I finish at this time?' Because I have to actually go to my other job [club rugby training].\n\n\"Then I'm going to come in tired in the morning because I've not got into bed until midnight.\"\n\nPlayers no longer on contracts can still represent Scotland, but they now fall under the country's National Team Agreement, which offers them £75 a day, not including rest days, for attending Scotland training camps.\n\nOne player said \"she can't be involved\" for that amount, adding: \"I won't be able to afford to pay my mortgage.\"\n\nAnother player said concerns over her future took \"an emotional toll\", adding: \"I didn't want to be there. I look back on it with exhaustion. It was such a big opportunity but I have nothing but negative thoughts around it.\n\n\"[After the tournament] I removed myself from social settings, any settings where people could ask me loads about rugby.\n\n\"If I did get into that environment, I would try to remove myself as quickly as possible because it made me panic and stress.\"\n\nThe player said Scotland Rugby had not been in contact about any follow-up support.\n\n\"There's been no kind of input about, 'do you need psychology?' or anything like that,\" she said.\n\nScottish Rugby detailed the steps put in place to support players:\n\nAccess to clinical psychology and a player development manager.\n\nA mandatory medical exit meeting to \"identify any potential physical or psychological support\".\n\nAn independent HR exit interview and a six-week post-contract window to access \"exit support services\" if needed.\n\nScottish Rugby said: \"From the outset of this process we recognised that players - particularly those whose contracts were due to end - would need additional support during the Rugby World Cup period and in planning their next steps.\n\n\"We believe we did deliver on our duty of care by the provision of both psychological and career guidance support throughout 2025, including in the lead-up to and during, the RWC.\n\n\"The entire playing group were out of contract in June 2025 and we made the decision to extend all contracts through to the end of October 2025 to provide a degree of stability through the RWC itself.\n\n\"The timings involved were designed to give clarity to all players as early as possible, following a timeline agreed and requested by the players themselves.\"\n\nListen to the latest Rugby Union Weekly podcast",

    "description": "The college football world found out what the College Football Playoff schedule will look like the next few seasons, and its not the best.",
    "fullText": "There is a common angst among college football fans with the College Football Playoff, the length of the grind and for teams like Notre Dame, they’ve had to adjust much of what they do to get to the end.\n\nLast season, the Irish and Ohio State, and this year with Indiana and Miami, saw their seasons conclude almost two months after the regular season ended. The hope was that the CFP committee would make some adjustments to the schedule, but as we found out on Tuesday, that won’t be the case.\n\nAccording to multiple sources, the quarterfinal games for 2026 will be played on Dec. 30th and Jan. 1st, and then just over two weeks later the semifinals will be played. The scheduled is very similar for the 2027 season as well, and it just doesn’t feel like college football.\n\nAs Josh Pate pointed out, Saturday, Nov. 14th is the midpoint of the “season” which is crazy to think about. There is no need for such a large gap, and I personally hate that these games aren’t played on Saturday’s. Sure, contending with the NFL isn’t a great idea, but college football has plenty of history playing on Saturday’s. The long layoffs are unnecessary as well, as players are accustomed to just a week to prepare for the next game.\n\nHopefully some changes will be made going forward, but for at least the next two seasons, the CFP schedule will be long and drawn out.\n\nUpcoming College Football Playoff dates for the quarterfinals and semi-finals the next two years.

    "fullText": "The way of the college football world today breaks down to this: coaches don’t get many opportunities to screw up, and anything short of a national championship is considered a screw up. So, given that current logic, it’s no surprise that the Houston Chronicle recently published a column noting that Texas head coach Steve Sarkisian sits atop a steadily warming hot-ish seat after the Longhorns missed the College Football Playoff last season.\n\nFrom the Chronicle: “Steve Sarkisian is not on any hot seat by a long shot. Not after going 35-8 the past three years (with two of the losses in the College Football Playoff semifinals and three other losses to Georgia and, oh yeah, Florida). He reached the CFP two of the previous three seasons and barely missed this past season. But he’s on the warming seat. And he’s got company. Sarkisian is preparing for his sixth season at Texas after seeing 26 of his players transfer out and 19 transfer in, including the portal’s top-ranked wide receiver, two outstanding running backs and two elite linebackers. The big number of those leaving suggest Texas badly missed its evaluations on more than two dozen players or drastically upgraded all of those positions. Actually, both of those premises could be true. Sarkisian at least grasps the sense of urgency among Longhorn Nation because this isn’t a place where you want to miss the playoff two years in a row. But he’s not alone. I’d say the top five coaches with the most heat on them, in order, are Alabama’s Kalen DeBoer, Oregon’s Dan Lanning, Sarkisian, LSU’s Lane Kiffin and USC’s Lincoln Riley. None of these obviously are in a must-win situation like some others. … Those on the hottest of hot seats are Baylor’s Dave Aranda (three losing seasons in the past four years), Florida State’s Mike Norvell (coming off 2-10 and 5-7 seasons), Wisconsin’s Luke Fickell (16-21 over three years), Maryland’s Mike Locksley (1-8 in Big Ten two straight years) and South Carolina’s Shane “Did you see our first half against the Aggies?” Beamer. … Of the group needing to break through and avoid slipping backward, they just need to win big and dispel the notion that they have hit a wall and have to get past it. DeBoer, it says here, is the best coach in the nation not named Kirby Smart, Curt Cignetti or Ryan Day, yet a large percentage of Crimson Tide fans think his days might be numbered if a third year isn’t more successful after missing the CFP in Year 1 and winning one CFP game over an average Oklahoma team in Year 2. Lanning has been a borderline disaster in the CFP, getting squashed by Ohio State in 2024 and mauled by Indiana in 2025 (after dominating Texas Tech). Kiffin may or may not have a honeymoon in his first season at Baton Rouge, but he’s still not been on the sidelines for a CFP game yet in his career. Riley can sure develop a quarterback or two with Caleb Williams and Jayden Maiava, but when is the breakthrough season coming?

    "fullText": "Merino is facing a prolonged spell on the sidelines after suffering a foot injury that requires surgery, with the length of his expected absence still unclear.\n\nSpeaking after Arsenal’s Carabao Cup semi final win over Chelsea on Tuesday night, Mikel Arteta confirmed the seriousness of the issue, telling beIN SPORTS, “With Merino, yeah, he’s going to be out for months unfortunately, with a foot injury.”\n\nWhile Arsenal have indicated they remain hopeful Merino could return before the end of the season, Zubimendi’s remarks following the same match suggested the situation may be more uncertain.\n\nSpeaking about his international team mate, he said, “Well, he’s in pain. He’s a very professional person, who takes care of himself and always thinks about what’s best for the club. I know he’s the one who’s most hurt, but the damage his injury has done to the club is significant.”\n\nZubimendi went on to acknowledge the challenge Merino faces in trying to recover in time for international duty. He said, “Well, he seems fine, but everyone’s different when they get home. I understand it’s harder than it looks. I know he’ll do everything he can to make it [to the national team], and if he doesn’t, it’ll be a real shame. We’ll see what happens.”\n\nWith the World Cup due to begin on 11 June, just over two weeks after the Premier League season ends on 24 May and six days after the Champions League final, the margin for recovery is tight.\n\nZubimendi’s comments underline concerns that Merino’s campaign may already be over, despite Arsenal’s hope that he could yet return before the season concludes.",

    "description": "OpenClaw is taking over the world — yet its security posture is mostly unknown. Follow along as we secure OpenClaw using a battle-tested method with HAProxy.",
    "fullText": "OpenClaw (née MoltBot, née ClawdBot) is taking over the world. Everyone is spinning their own, either on a VPS, or their own Mac mini.\n\nBut here's the problem: OpenClaw is brand new, and its security posture is mostly unknown. Security researchers have already found thousands of publicly available instances exposing everything from credentials to private messages.\n\nWhile OpenClaw has a Gateway component — the UI and WebSocket that controls access — there are serious issues with its password/token-based authentication:\n\nUntil recently, you could skip authentication entirely on localhost.\n\nThe GET URL token authentication mechanism is questionable for such young code.\n\nTrust needs to be earned, not assumed.\n\nIn this post, we'll secure OpenClaw using a battle-tested method with HAProxy.\n\nHAProxy’s HTTP Basic Authentication is a robust method for securing access to production systems with a username/password combination. In this guide, we’ll do the following:\n\nConfigure HAProxy with automatic TLS, basic auth, and rate limiting\n\nInstall OpenClaw and authenticate access using the basic auth credentials\n\nWe'll cover running OpenClaw on a VPS first. In a follow-up, we'll tackle Mac mini deployments with secure remote access (think Tailscale, but entirely self-hosted).\n\nWe'll also add smart rate limiting: anyone who sends more than 5 unauthorized requests within 120 seconds is blocked for 1 minute. The clever part? They'll see a 401 Unauthorized instead of 429 Too Many Requests, so attackers won't even know they've been rate-limited.\n\nYou'll need two checklist items to get started:\n\nA VPS running anywhere with Ubuntu 24.04, and a public IP address\n\nA domain/subdomain pointing DNS to the VPS public IP\n\nTo see everything in action, visit our live demo link and experiment.\n\nFirst, we'll install the high-performance HAProxy image:\n\nWe now have HAProxy 3.3 installed, with the high-performance AWS-LC library and full ACME support for automatic TLS certificates. Now, we just need to apply the configuration to make it work.\n\nEdit /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg and insert the following lines into the global section. This will set us up to use automatic TLS:\n\nNow let’s add configuration for automatic TLS using Let’s Encrypt. Edit the last line for your own domain:\n\nNext, we'll take care of the basic HAProxy configuration items. Don’t forget to change the line starting with ssl-f-use to use the correct subdomain alias from the my_files section:\n\nChange change-this-password shown in the last line to a strong password!\n\nRestart HAProxy to apply the updated configuration:\n\nNext, edit the HAProxy systemd file to make it automatically write certificates to disk. Run the following command:\n\nYou're now ready to insert the following line under [Service]:\n\nYou're now ready to install OpenClaw:\n\nThat’s it! You can now run the following command:\n\nThis process will give you your personal access token. This is still needed for proper authentication inside OpenClaw itself.\n\nYou can now visit https://subdomain.example.com/?token=<gateway token>. When doing this for the first time, you'll have to provide a username and password.\n\nYou can also configure your macOS app to talk to this OpenClaw instance. Just insert the username and password directly into the Websocket URL, as shown below:\n\nCheck your rate limiting occasionally to see who's knocking at your door:\n\nYou might be surprised how many bots are already scanning for OpenClaw instances. That 401 response is working hard. Any line item where gpc0 is higher than 5 has been limited.\n\nWhat if you accidentally lock yourself out? Simply run this command, where <key> is your IP address:bash:\n\nYou now have an OpenClaw instance that's actually secure, not just \"hopefully secure.\" Here's what's protecting you:\n\nDefense in depth – You're not relying on OpenClaw's young authentication code. HAProxy handles the security layer with battle-tested HTTP Basic Auth that's been protecting production systems for decades.\n\nStealth rate limiting – Attackers hitting your instance will see authentication failures, not rate limit errors. They won't know they've been blocked, which means they'll waste time and resources before giving up.\n\nAutomatic TLS – Let's Encrypt handles your certificates with zero manual intervention. No expired certs, no security warnings, no hassle.\n\nIf you need more authentication methods or additional security layers, check out HAProxy Enterprise load balancer. When you’re ready to control your deployment at scale, using HAProxy Fusion for centralized management, observability, and automation.\n\nJakub Suchy is the Director of Solutions Engineering at HAProxy Technologies, where he designs and prototypes solutions for application delivery and load balancing infrastructure. With his background in Linux infrastructure and Open Source Applications, he specializes in developing innovative approaches to modern application delivery challenges, focusing on micro-services architecture and high-availability systems.\n\nThough KubeCon North America 2024 has officially come to a close, the CNCF's flagship event has left us buzzing with residual excitement. Here's what we've learned throughout those four days.\n\nHAProxy Enterprise 3.2 brings next-generation security intelligence, extends its industry-leading performance, and expands the native routing and integration capabilities in HAProxy Enterprise.\n\nAWS re:Invent 2024 has officially wrapped up, but not everything that happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. Here are some key takeaways from our five days spent with AWS and app delivery enthusiasts.\n\nTikTok’s web scraper, Bytespider, is reportedly aggressively sucking up content to fuel generative AI models. We also noticed this while reviewing bot management analytics. Here's what we've learned.",

    "description": "Jess Fishlock says she is \"fleshing out the details\" over a potential role with Wales following her retirement from international football.",
    "fullText": "Jess Fishlock says she is \"fleshing out the details\" over a potential role with Wales following her retirement from international football.\n\nWales boss Rhian Wilkinson said in December that she hoped Fishlock, who ended her stellar international career last October, would join her coaching staff for the start of World Cup qualifying in March.\n\nSeattle Reign midfielder Fishlock, 39, says her phone \"blew up\" after Wilkinson's comments – and that she got a telling off from her mother because she found out the news from the media rather than her daughter.\n\n\"My mum saw it and asked, are you working for Rhian? She got me in trouble,\" Fishlock said.\n\nOn whether she has spoken to Wilkinson and what the role might be, Fishlock said: \"I can't say, but we had a brief conversation about me being involved and what it would look like - I just didn't realise it would go public.\n\n\"But we have had conversations, we are on the same page, just fleshing out the details.\"\n\nFishlock is Wales' record appearance maker and goalscorer, having won 166 senior caps and scored 48 times.\n\nShe stepped away from Wales duty in the wake of Euro 2025, the country's first major international women's football tournament, insisting it was \"the right time\" after her farewell appearance in a friendly against Australia.\n\nOn the idea of playing some part for Wales in their 2027 World Cup qualifiers against Czech Republic and Montenegro in March, Fishlock remains coy.\n\n\"I would love to stay involved in some capacity; it wasn't a clean break - I still text the girls all the time. But we will just wait and see,\" Fishlock told BBC Sport.\n\nFishlock played 18 times for Seattle Reign last season and helped them qualify for the end-of-season play-offs in the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL).\n\nHer contribution at club level has led some in Wales to suggest she could still play a full part as Wilkinson's team attempt to qualify for the Women's World Cup finals for the first time.\n\nBut though Fishlock says she misses her international team-mates, she has reiterated that the time has come for the next generation to take over.\n\n\"People have said, if you are back you may as well play,\" she says. \"But it is still the right time not to play internationals.\n\n\"I still want to help any way I can, my experience being around might help. But no, no thoughts about coming out of retirement.\"\n\nFishlock also has no regrets about the Euros, despite Wales being outclassed in a group with France, Netherlands and eventual champions England.\n\nWales lost all three games while conceding 13 goals, leaving them with the worst group stage record in the history of the competition.\n\n\"I still look back at it with such pride and joy,\" Fishlock says. \"Getting to represent the entire country, it was even more impactful that I thought it was going to be.\n\n\"Seeing how Wales showed up for us, that was the best part of it all. As a competitor it hurt, but the whole world seeing who we are as a nation overrides it.\n\n\"I still get goosebumps coming out for the first game [versus Netherlands] and seeing the Red Wall - it will stay with me forever.\"\n\nBen Haines, Ellen White and Jen Beattie are back for another season of the Women's Football Weekly podcast.

    "fullText": "Around 2,900 athletes from more than 90 countries will compete on the ice and snow at Milan-Cortina 2026.\n\nThe world's biggest winter sports stars will descend on northern Italy from Friday 6 February and there's certain to be thrills, drama and breakout performances.\n\nBBC Sport takes a look at some of the global stars and stories to look out for.\n\nJust five days before the women's downhill event takes place in Cortina, Olympic champion Lindsey Vonn announced that she had ruptured her left anterior cruciate ligament but is still hopeful that she can compete on Sunday.\n\nVonn was airlifted to hospital in Switzerland after crashing in the final World Cup race of the season but remains determined to compete in her fifth Olympics, despite the serious injury.\n\nThe veteran skier is no stranger to a comeback having retired in 2019 because of injury before undergoing partial replacement knee surgery on her right knee and returning to the sport in 2024.\n\nThe four-time overall World Cup winner is unsure whether she will be able to compete in the super-G and team events but, as a heavy favourite for the downhill gold before suffering the injury, she is determined to make the start gate at what will likely be her last Olympics.\n\nMikaela Shiffrin is the greatest alpine skier of all time and, competing at her fourth Olympics, has said she wants to \"make peace\" with the Games following disappointment in Beijing along with serious injury and mental health struggles.\n\nThe five-time overall World Cup winner has 108 World Cup wins, securing victory in the opening five slalom events of the season which, when added to her victory in the final slalom of last season, equalled her own record of six consecutive wins in the discipline.\n\nBut the two-time Olympic champion will be targeting a return to the podium in Cortina while her fiance Aleksander Aamodt Kilde is also on the comeback trail from a bad injury.\n\nAmerican figure skater Maxim Naumov's participation in the Milan-Cortina Games could be emotional as he makes his Olympic debut after his parents were killed in a plane crash in Washington DC last year.\n\nNaumov's dream to make Team USA was one of the last things he spoke about with his parents before they were killed.\n\nHis parents, Vadim Naumov and Evgenia Shishkova, skated for Russia and were world champions in pairs figure skating in 1994.\n\nSki mountaineering, or 'skimo', is making its Olympic debut at Milan-Cortina and, while Great Britain have failed to qualify an athlete in the Games' new sport, France's Emily Harrop is the next best thing.\n\nWith English parents, Harrop could have competed for Team GB but having relocated to the French Alps as a child she opted to represent France.\n\nHarrop is well placed for an Olympic medal having finished the 2025 season with seven wins out of seven races at the ski mountaineering World Cup, winning the sprint and overall crystal globe for the fourth consecutive season.\n\nDutch speed skater Jutta Leerdam will compete in the 1,000m and 500m in Milan.\n\nA former world sprint champion, Leerdam also won a silver medal in the 1,000m at the 2022 Beijing Olympics.\n\nShe is also engaged to YouTuber-turned-boxer Jake Paul, who can often be spotted at competitions and will be cheering her on from the sidelines in Italy.\n\nTeenager Finley Melville Ives arrives in Italy as one of the most exciting prospects on the freestyle skiing circuit.\n\nIves' parents are both snowboard instructors and his twin brother followed in their footsteps, but Ives opted instead for skis from a young age.\n\nHis breakout season came last year when he claimed his first World Cup victory in Calgary then weeks later became the halfpipe world champion in Engadin, Switzerland, beating Olympic greats Alex Ferreira and Nick Goepper along the way.\n\nBorn and raised in California, freestyle skier Eileen Gu was China's poster girl for Beijing 2022, where - aged 18 - she won gold in the big air and freeski halfpipe competitions and silver in the slopestyle.\n\nIn addition to her Olympic triumphs, she is also a two-time world champion and three-time Winter X Games champion.\n\nAway from the snow, Gu is one of the most famous winter sports athletes in the world and has modelled in New York, Barcelona, Paris and at Milan Fashion Week while also studying quantum physics at Stanford University.\n\nFor the first time since Sochi 2014, the National Hockey League is permitting its athletes to participate in the Winter Olympics.\n\nNHL stars did not travel to the 2018 or 2022 Games because of financial disputes and pandemic-related complications but will return to the ice this year.\n\nIn their absence, the last two men's titles have been won by Olympic teams from Russia and Finland while the United States failed to win a medal at both events, but this could be a huge boost to their hopes of returning to the podium.\n\nEight years after winning gold as a 17-year-old in Pyeongchang, American halfpipe snowboarder Chloe Kim is going for a three-peat in Italy.\n\nShe successfully defended her title in Beijing four years ago but her preparations for Milan-Cortina have been disrupted after she dislocated her shoulder at the beginning of the year.\n\nShe said in an update on Instagram she was \"good to go\" for the Games, where she will aim to become the first woman to win three consecutive Olympic gold medals in the halfpipe.\n\nLegendary German bobsleigh pilot Francesco Friedrich arrives in Italy hoping to become the first man do the treble double - winning two and four-man gold for the third Games in a row.\n\nHe is a 16-time world champion across the two and four-man events while he has well over 100 World Cup podium finishes, claiming a 50th victory in the two-man earlier this year.\n\nGermany tend to dominate the Olympic bobsleigh events and the question is whether anyone can stop him from making history.\n\nCompeting at her sixth Games, Arianna Fontana is an 11-time Winter Olympic medallist and has won medals at her five previous appearances - including as a 15-year-old in Turin.\n\nTwenty years later, the short track skater is also aiming to compete in long track speed skating.\n\nTwo-time Olympic champion Fontana will also be one of Italy's flag bearers at the opening ceremony at the San Siro.\n\nNorwegian-born skier Lucas Pinheiro Braathen could make history in Italy by winning a first Winter Olympics medal for a South American country after he switched allegiance to compete for his mother's home country of Brazil.\n\nThe slalom and giant slalom expert retired in 2023 having competed for Norway but returned in 2025 to represent Brazil and became the first Brazilian to finish on a World Cup podium last year before claiming the country's first victory this season to add to his five for Norway.\n\nA charismatic and deep-thinking character, Braathen says that people don't believe him when he tells them he represents Brazil in alpine skiing.\n\nAge: 18 Nation: Independent Neutral Athlete\n\nRussian skater Adeliia Petrosian is one of around 20 Russian or Belarusian athletes competing under a neutral flag in Italy.\n\nThe teenager had not competed internationally at senior level until the Olympic qualifiers because of the ban on Russian athletes but is a genuine medal contender having won the qualifying event.\n\nShe is coached by the controversial Eteri Tutberidze, who coached Kamila Valieva during the Beijing 2022 Olympics. Valieva was given a four-year ban for doping after she helped Russia to win team gold before it was then revealed she had failed a drug test before the start of the Games.\n\nIlia Malinin is the only skater to have successfully landed the quadruple Axel, skating's most difficult jump, in competition, earning him the nickname the 'Quad God'.\n\nThe American, born to Olympic figure skaters Tatiana Malinina and Roman Skorniakov, is the hot favourite for the men's singles title in Italy with previous routines including seven quads and a back flip.\n\nThe reigning world champion will be competing at his first Olympics having controversially been left out of the US team in Beijing.",

    "fullText": "Who will seize the Six Nations stage and make a name for themselves over the next six weeks?\n\nHere is a player from each nation who could appear in the tournament for the first time.\n\nWatch live on BBC TV and ITV, listen to every match on BBC Radio 5 Live, Sports Extra and BBC Sounds, live text and highlights on BBC Sport website and app.\n\nThe son of hard-hitting former Tonga international Keni Fisilau, number eight Greg has been a key part of Exeter's revival this season. His ball-carrying, which combines nimble footwork and raw go-forward power has helped the 22-year-old to five Prem tries so far in this campaign.\n\nOn the other side of the ball, Greg's father didn't allow him to play touch rugby as a youngster, concerned he would pick up bad habits of trying to stop runners with his hands, rather than his shoulder.\n\nIt looks like it paid off as Plymouth-born Fisilau has made the eighth highest number of tackles in the English top flight.\n\nHis route into the England team is a tough one, however, with back row a position of particular depth for coach Steve Borthwick.\n\nBut for injury, Edogbo could easily have featured in this list for a previous Six Nations.\n\nThe 23-year-old second row spent nearly two years on the sidelines with Achilles tendon tears, but is now up to speed and could add heft to an Ireland pack that has, on occasions, looked lightweight against the very best.\n\nStanding 6ft 5in tall and weighing 20 stone, he has scored three tries in nine games this season for Munster.\n\nEdogbo was a relatively late convert to rugby, only picking up a ball as a 13-year-old after his younger brother Sean - a promising back row prospect himself - took it up.\n\nAway from the pitch, he is in the final year of an economics degree at University College Cork.\n\nWill head coach Andy Farrell dare to pair him with the similarly powerful Joe McCarthy in the engine room, or use Edogbo as a possible stand-in for his Leinster rival? Or perhaps he is earmarked for an impact bench role?\n\nIt took only seven minutes of Kalvin Gourgues' Test debut last November for the hype train to gather even more steam.\n\nThe 20-year-old, coming on as a late replacement for Gael Fickou, received the ball on his own 22-metre line and ghosted through the heart of Australia's midfield before casually slinging a dart of a pass out for Louis Bielle-Biarrey to score.\n\nWith Fickou left out of defending champions France's initial Six Nations squad, Gourgues' time seems to be coming fast.\n\nHis versatility is another string to his bow. As well as covering both midfield spots, he has previously played full-back and started at 10 for Toulouse recently.\n\nCoach Fabien Galthie has trusted him as the backline replacement in a six-two bench for the opening game against Ireland on Thursday.\n\nGourgues' prodigious rise is all the more impressive considering he spent nearly a year out of the game recently to fix a circulation problem that could ultimately have cost him his leg.\n\nHe had an artery in his foot replaced by one from his thigh and is scanned every month to ensure his blood flow is back to normal.\n\nGregor Townsend's faith in Freddy Douglas is clear. The Scotland coach handed Douglas, then 19, a Test debut before he had even made a top-level club appearance for Edinburgh.\n\nIn taking to the pitch for the final 15 minutes of a 59-21 win over Portugal in November 2024, Douglas became the youngest man to represent Scotland in more than 60 years.\n\nIt wasn't all straightforward from there, though, as an ankle injury sidelined him shortly afterwards and he was frustrated to be overlooked for the autumn internationals.\n\nHowever Douglas' low-slung jackalling ability, aided by yoga stretching that he has done since he was a teenager,, external has impressed this season and delivered a fistful of turnovers. He has also bulked up to do more of the heavy-duty ball-carrying on the gainline.\n\nHaving packed down opposite Henry Pollock at under-20 level, could he make a similarly steep climb to prominence?\n\nYou could understand Welsh fans getting nervous when one of their age-grade prospects goes west.\n\nImmanuel Feyi-Waboso, like Hennessey, was a Cardiff Schools star and Wales age-grade regular, who headed to England to combine university studies with professional rugby.\n\nBut while Feyi-Waboso switched to represent England at senior level, Hennessey is staying firmly on track.\n\nA classy centre, with physicality, quick feet and playmaking ability, he has also turned out on the wing for English champions Bath. And he has come into form at the right time.\n\nCardiff-born Hennessey ran in a try in a win over Gloucester in the most recent round of Prem matches to ensure that, after getting a first senior call-up in the autumn, the 21-year-old kept his place for the Six Nations.\n\nItaly's plans have been disrupted by injuries. As well as star back Ange Capuozzo's broken finger, they are missing back-row stalwarts Ross Vintcent and Sebastian Negri.\n\nThe latter pair's absence may provide a route into the team for the uncapped 24-year-old Samuele Locatelli, who has been in fine form.\n\nHe was voted player of the year in the Italian top flight while playing for Viadana and has risen to impress in the United Rugby Championship with Zebre.\n\nA Test appearance would cap a remarkable mid-career rise.\n\nSix Nations fixtures and how to follow on the BBC\n\nSix Nations preview & BBC pundit predictions\n\nWhat impact might 'unprecedented' Six Nations schedule have?",

    "fullText": "On the night leading up to Wednesday, the transfer chaos surrounding N'Golo Kanté was complete. The French world champion is now indeed moving to Fenerbahçe. \"Giving up is not an option for us,\" the club initially tweeted before the transfer was officially announced two hours later.\n\nAfter the Turkish club had announced at noon that the deal had failed (you can read it again here), the transfer chaos is now complete. However, since the transfer window in Turkey is open longer, the transfer can still go through.\n\nKanté signs a contract until 2028 and is part of a swap deal. In return, Youssef En-Nesyri moves to Kanté's former club Al Ittihad. According to media reports, the Saudis are paying 15 million euros, and Kanté is moving to Istanbul on a free transfer.\n\nThe Frenchman is said to have previously refused to participate in training at Al Ittihad to force his transfer. He has now succeeded in doing so.\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence. You can read the original version in 🇩🇪 here.\n\n📸 Franco Arland - 2025 Getty Images",

    "description": "The World Health Organization found that nearly 40% of cancer cases worldwide are linked to preventable causes.",
    "fullText": "A new report from the World Health Organization found that nearly 7 million cases of cancer worldwide were preventable.\n\nAnalyzing 18.7 million new cancer cases in 2022 (the most recent data available to them), researchers found that nearly 4 out of 10 cases were linked to 30 modifiable risk factors, including smoking tobacco, infections like HPV and hepatitis B, and consuming alcohol. Stomach, lung, and cervical cancer accounted for almost half of all preventable cancers in the report.\n\nThe findings are a comprehensive assessment of cancer cases globally, which vary greatly by region, so while promising, they come with limitations. \n\nThe news comes less than two weeks after it was revealed that colon cancer is now the leading cause of cancer death in people under 50.\n\nCancer can be caused by a variety of factors, including family history, genetic mutations, and environmental pollutants — all things out of our control — but some risk can be mitigated with lifestyle modifications.\n\nResearch shows that diets involving lots of ultra-processed foods (UPFs) are linked to higher cancer risk. They can increase inflammation and disrupt the gut microbiome, increasing the risk of colon and ovarian cancer.\n\nA diet rich in whole foods is the best way to go. Dr. Daniel Landau, an oncologist specializing in genitourinary cancers, previously told Business Insider that he mostly follows the Mediterranean diet, focusing on lean protein, fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, and legumes while limiting red meat (which might be carcinogenic), dairy, alcohol, sugar, and UPFs.\n\nGut-healthy foods are also important. Dr. Susan Bullman, an associate professor at MD Anderson Cancer Center who specializes in gut health and cancer research, previously told Business Insider that she eats fiber-rich foods like pears and probiotics like kefir to feed beneficial gut microbes. Eating a wide variety of plants, such as swapping out vegetable sides or sprinkling seeds on top of salads, can also improve gut health.\n\nExercise has long been associated with a reduced risk of cancer. One 2025 trial found that a strict workout regimen for preventing colon cancer resurgence than expensive treatments like chemotherapy. While scientists are still exploring the reasons why exercise is so effective at cancer prevention, they have their theories. Dr. Paul Oberstein, a medical oncologist at NYU Langone, previously told Business Insider that exercise is probably reducing inflammation, which may help slow tumor growth.\n\nDr. Sue Hwang, an oncologist who was diagnosed with breast cancer, said you should aim for 30 minutes of exercise a day, whether it's strength training or cardio.\n\nIf you can't make it to a gym every day, she said, even taking a walk or playing with your kids in a playground helps. Even vigorous daily movements, like climbing up stairs or carrying heavy groceries, can cut down cancer risk. Still, the best thing you can do is pencil in real workouts.\n\nBeing aware of early cancer symptoms, like blood in your stool for colon cancer, can help you seek screenings earlier than the recommended starting age.\n\nIt's also important to be aware of your family history, any genetic mutations like Lynch syndrome that increase risks of several cancers, or other factors like PCOS for endometrial cancer.\n\nDr. Thaïs Aliabadi, an OB-GYN who helped Olivia Munn get diagnosed with stage 1 breast cancer, said collecting data on your body, such as previous biopsies or breast density, can help you better assess your risk.",

    "description": "Up to 50 percent of species—which included 12 bird species and 4 frog species—on Aotearoa’s North Island went extinct before humans arrived",
    "fullText": "Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nA New Zealand cave has revealed million-year-old fossils, including 12 ancient bird species and four frog species.\n\nExperts believe the discovery shows how drastically New Zealand’s forest culture has shifted.\n\nResearchers said up to 50 percent of species on Aotearoa’s North Island went extinct before humans arrived.\n\nA spectacular trove of fossils in a discovered in a cave on New Zealand's North Island has given scientists their first glimpse of ancient forest species that lived there more than a million years ago. The fossils represent 12 ancient bird species and four frog species, including several previously unknown bird species. Taken together, the fossils paint a picture of an ancient world that looks drastically different than it does today. The discovery also fills in an important gap in scientific understanding of the patterns of extinction that preceded human arrival in New Zealand 750 years ago.\n\nThe team published a study on the find in Alcheringa: An Australasian Journal of Palaeontology.\n\n“This is a newly recognized avifauna for New Zealand, one that was replaced by the one humans encountered a million years later,” Trevor Worthy, lead study author and associate professor at Flinders University, said in a statement. “This remarkable find suggests our ancient forests were once home to a diverse group of birds that did not survive the next million years.”\n\nThe team located the fossils between two layers of volcanic ash preserved in the cave, each from a different major eruption, the first 1.55 million years ago and the second 1 million years ago. Many of the species represented among the fossils had already gone extinct by the time humans arrived on the island. By extrapolation, the research team estimated that between 33 and 50 percent of all species on the island went extinct during the million years before humans arrived in New Zealand, likely thanks to rapid climate shifts and cataclysmic volcanic eruptions, said Paul Scofield, study co-author and Canterbury Museum senior curator of natural history.\n\nWorthy said that “for decades, the extinction of New Zealand’s birds was viewed primarily through the lens of human arrival 750 years ago. This study proves that natural forces like super-volcanoes and dramatic climate shifts were already sculpting the unique identity of our wildlife over a million years ago.”\n\nOf all the finds, scientists might be the giddiest about discovering a new species of parrot, Strigops insulaborealis, an ancient relative of the iconic Kākāpō, a large flightless parrot known for its heft. The team believes this ancestor may have possessed the ability to fly. By analyzing the fossil discovery, the team noticed the ancient bird had weaker legs than the modern relative, implying the ancestor wasn’t quite the skilled climber as the modern-day Kākāpō. Still, the team said more research is needed to confirm that this ancient bird could fly.\n\nThe researchers also uncovered an ancestor of the modern Takahe, which opens further research into that bird. Fossils of an extinct species of pigeon closely related to the Australian bronzewing pigeons also excited experts.\n\n“The shifting forest and shrubland habitats forced a reset of the bird populations,” Scofield said. “We believe this was a major driver for the evolutionary diversification of birds and other fauna in the North Island.”\n\nScofield said that previous excavations showed life in New Zealand between 20 and 16 million years ago and that by contrast, the new discoveries offer the first evidence of life from 15 million years ago to one million years ago. “This wasn’t a missing chapter in New Zealand’s ancient history,” Scofield said, “it was a missing volume.”\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "fullText": "Earlier today, FC Barcelona officially announced that they were entering the bidding process to host the 2029 UEFA Champions League final at the renovated Spotify Camp Nou.\n\nSoon after, reports emerged claiming that the Blaugrana were also working behind the scenes to secure the hosting rights for the 2030 FIFA World Cup final at their stadium.\n\nHowever, Real Madrid are also in the race as they push to have the grand finale of the tournament played at the Santiago Bernabeu.\n\nNow, according to SPORT, Barcelona might have an edge over Real Madrid in their bid to host the 2030 World Cup final at the Spotify Camp Nou.\n\nThe 2030 World Cup will be jointly hosted by Portugal, Spain and Morocco. FIFA is currently assessing three main options for the final: Santiago Bernabeu, Spotify Camp Nou, and Hassan II Stadium in Casablanca, and will ultimately select one of these stadiums.\n\nIn this context, the Mayor of Barcelona, Jaume Collboni, reaffirmed the Catalan capital’s determination to compete to host the decisive match of the 2030 World Cup.\n\nBarcelona offers many attractions for FIFA and, although the Bernabeu appears to be the favourite, the city believes it has strong arguments to remain in contention.\n\nOne of the main elements boosting Barcelona’s chances is economic. Once the renovation is completed, the Spotify Camp Nou will have a capacity of 105,000 spectators, compared to the 84,000 seats at the Bernabeu, home of Real Madrid.\n\nThis represents a significant difference of 21,000 additional spectators. Ticket prices for major events have risen sharply in recent years. In the United States, for example, prices for the final at the MetLife Stadium on 19 July later this year have exceeded €3,000 per ticket.\n\nBased on average projections, FIFA believes it could generate more than €20 million in additional revenue if the final were held at Barcelona’s stadium rather than in Madrid. This is a substantial difference and one that could prove decisive in tipping the balance.\n\nCasablanca, for its part, is seen as less well-positioned due to the lack of the historical footballing weight associated with venues such as the Camp Nou or the Bernabeu.\n\nBarcelona and Madrid also enjoy advantages over Casablanca in terms of infrastructure and the location of their stadiums within the urban environment. The Hassan II Stadium is expected to be spectacular, but it will be located far from the city centre.\n\nHowever, Spanish cities are well established in hosting major international events, offering simpler and more reliable logistics.\n\nAdded to this is a strong footballing tradition, which FIFA is keen to highlight after recent World Cups awarded to emerging football nations such as Qatar and the United States.\n\nThe final decision will still take time, but Barcelona’s bid remains firm, as made clear by its mayor. The Catalan capital is not giving up, even if the spotlight currently appears to be focused on the Bernabeu.",

    "fullText": "MILAN (AP) — Olympic officials from Africa took their concerns about a visa program for entering the United States to leaders of the 2028 Los Angeles Games on Tuesday.\n\nInternational Olympic Committee members from Ethiopia and Djibouti quizzed the LA organizing team about how fans and visitors would get “equal access” to the U.S. in 2 ½ years’ time.\n\nLos Angeles was first on the IOC conference stage among six future Olympic hosts updating on their plans, though the one whose home country is currently seeing the most domestic turmoil.\n\n“It's a great worry. For everybody,\" a third African IOC member, Lydia Nsekera of Burundi — one of dozens of countries whose residents face restrictions entering the U.S. — later told The Associated Press of the visa uncertainty, \"even the (team) officials.”\n\nThe name of U.S. President Donald Trump was not said at the Olympic meeting, nor was reference made to his administration three days before Vice President JD Vance is due in Milan to attend the Winter Games opening ceremony.\n\nOne reference, however, seemed clear as L.A. sought to project an air of calm reassurance.\n\n“The world is complicated and unpredictable,” L.A. 2028 chairman Casey Wasserman said in a scripted speech. “Conflicts within and among nations ignite and are resolved. We are not naïve to this reality. We take it seriously and we will face it head on.”\n\nWhen more than 100 IOC members were invited to ask questions, Dagmawit Girmay Berhane of Ethiopia noted people from 175 countries have registered interest to buy tickets for the 2028 Summer Games.\n\nThe Trump administration has imposed a travel ban or limits on entry to people from dozens of countries including Zimbabwe, the home of IOC President Kirsty Coventry.\n\nWhile the U.S. government has promised exemptions for athletes and other participants of major sports events, fans and visitors face their visa applications being scrutinized.\n\n“How will you make sure there is equal opportunity for all who purchase or who register for the tickets have equal access to the visa services?” asked Berhane, a 13-year member of the IOC.\n\nFellow IOC member Gene Sykes, the president of the U.S. national Olympic body, said a State Department office in Washington D.C. is dedicated to smoothing visa issues for the Summer Games.\n\nSykes noted the World Cup in men’s soccer, which the U.S. co-hosts with Canada and Mexico this year, will test visa processing systems.\n\n“This entire process of welcoming visitors from other countries to the United States for sporting events is getting something of a trial run on a smaller basis,” he said. “It gives us the opportunity to see how do we optimize this.”\n\nFrom Djibouti, Aïcha Garad Ali asked if L.A. could appoint a similar “ambassador for visas” that worked for the 2024 Olympics: “\n\nSykes promised: “It’s certainly something we can give consideration to.”\n\nThe Olympic Games was “the singular unifying force for the world,” Wasserman said, urging his audience not to focus on “what is frightening.”\n\n“The world does not need another reason to fight with each other. It needs a reason to come together. Los Angeles is one of the most globally diverse cities on earth.\n\n“It is not just a mirror of America, it is a mirror of the world itself.”\n\nWasserman was introduced on stage with polite applause by IOC members in his first meeting with them since the release at the weekend of more government files relating to Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nThe trove of documents included flirtatious emails from 2003 between Wasserman and Epstein’s one-time girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell.\n\nIn a statement released Saturday, Wasserman expressed deep regret for the correspondence.\n\nAP Winter Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics",

    "fullText": "Tigres’s defender Aaliyah Farmer has signed a three-year contract with the Chicago Stars.\n\nChicago Stars has announced the signing of Tigres and Mexico’s women’s national team, Aaliyah Farmer. The California native’s contract runs through 2028.\n\n“Aaliyah has a unique defensive prowess, strong aerial ability and the versatility to contribute in multiple defensive roles, which we’re excited to add to our group,” said Chicago Stars FC general manager Richard Feuz. “Her promising career is just getting started. We look forward to having Chicago be part of it.”\n\nFarmer’s first professional contract was signed with the most important club in Mexico in January 2025 and one month later, she received her first call-up to the Mexican national team. Despite 2025 being her rookie year, she has become a regular for the national team, playing eight games with “El Tri Femenil” since her debut on May 30.\n\nHis career took off not only with the national team but also with his former club, Tigres. Since signing with the club, he played nine regular-season games and two playoff games in the Clausura 2025. The following season, he started in 14 of the 15 regular-season games and helped Tigres win another championship, becoming a key figure for the team. It’s also important to highlight her participation in the Concacaf W Champions Cup with Tigres, where she scored her first professional goal against the Portland Thorns.\n\n“I’m incredibly excited to join the Chicago Stars,” said Farmer. “It’s an honor to be part of such a strong club that’s building something special, and I’m excited for what’s ahead. I’m grateful for the opportunity to compete, grow and play with some incredibly talented players. I’m excited to give everything I have for this team and can’t wait to get started.”",

    "description": "A unanimous decision from the OWGR means players on the LIV will earn ranking points for the first time",
    "fullText": "Competitiors on the LIV Golf Tour will be able to win world ranking points from the 2026 after a decision from the Official World Golf Ranking (OWGR) governing board ruled in favour of the tour’s application.\n\nLIV Golf began in 2022 as a breakaway tour to the established professinal PGA Tour and DP World Tours having been founded by Saudia Arabia’s Public Investment Fund.\n\nEach tournament lasted 54 holes instead of the usual four-round 72 holes played on the American and European tours and LIV was created with unique rules and teams to try and capture a similar vibe to that of the Ryder Cup. LIV has switched to 72 holes for the 2026 season, though that wasn't a big obstacle in getting world ranking points because other smaller tours around the world also have 54 hole events.\n\nIt drew big name players such as Phil Mickelson, Ian Poulter and Dustin Johnson whilst creating a rift with the PGA Tour in particular from which the players had to resign their memberships. Earlier this year Brooks Koepka and Patrick Reed announced their intentions to leave LIV and seek reintegration into the PGA Tour.\n\nAlso in 2022, LIV applied to the OWGR with a submission for the tour to be awarded world rankings points for its players but was unsuccessful. The OWGR rejected the first application in October 2023 when former chairman Peter Dawson said the board could not fairly measure LIV against the other tours. A year later, the then CEO Greg Norman advised that LIV would no longer be seeking OWGR approval for ranking points.\n\nHowever, LIV received a boost on the eve of its fifth season when the OWGR approved that the league will receive ranking points for the very first time in 2026.\n\nA statement from OWGR reads: “The Governing Board of the Official World Golf Ranking (OWGR) today announced its decision on the application from LIV Golf.\n\n“After conducting an exhaustive and collaborative process, and in an effort to reflect the changing landscape of the men’s professional game, the OWGR Board has made the decision to award world ranking points to LIV Golf events for the 2026 season.\n\n“Ranking points will be allocated to the top-10 finishers (and ties) in LIV Golf’s individual stroke play events, which recognises there are a number of areas where LIV Golf does not meet the eligibility standards set out by OWGR.”\n\nThe decision was unanimous but the OWGR board but comes with conditions. Only the top 10 players in each event will receive points.\n\nTyrrell Hatton at No. 22 and Bryson DeChambeau at No. 33 are the only LIV players in the current top 50 of the world rankings.",

I was nervous at the end but I backed the bowlers, that's what they train for - to nail those yorkers at the back end under pressure.\"\n\nEngland have won the U19 World Cup once - in 1998 - and were beaten finalists in 2022.

But NASA’s Juno mission, which launched in 2011 and reached Jupiter in 2016, has proved to be a game changer: By orbiting over Jupiter’s poles for the first time, it allowed for clearer observations of Jupiter’s size.\n\nThe research means scientists have to adjust their models of Jupiter, a change that will have resounding implications for both studying the planet’s features, such its volatile atmosphere, and understanding how gas giants like Jupiter formed in the first place.\n\n“Jupiter was likely the first planet to form in the solar system,” Kaspi said in the same statement, “and by studying what’s happening inside it, we get closer to understanding how the solar system, and planets like ours, came to be.”",

    "fullText": "Former Milan and Juventus defender Mattia De Sciglio said he snubbed a move to Liverpool to move to Turin in 2017, but he felt ‘used’ by Vincenzo Montella at San Siro.\n\nFormer Italy international De Sciglio spoke about his career in an interview with Corriere della Sera.\n\nA product of the Milan academy, De Sciglio has also played for Juventus and Empoli in Serie A and Lyon in the French Ligue 1.\n\nThe 33-year-old has collected 208 appearances in Serie A and 28 in the Champions League.\n\n“I could have played for Inter as a kid,” De Sciglio said via Calciomercato.com.\n\n“They had called me for a trial, but I was dropped because I was too short. Milan arrived shortly afterwards, and I went through the youth sector until my Champions League debut at 18.”\n\nDe Sciglio was a Milan first-team player in one of the darkest moments in recent history, but feels the way he was treated at San Siro was unfair.\n\n“Some of the fans and the media identified me as the guilty one in that situation, and they were all waiting for a minimum error to criticise me,” he said.\n\n“My social media accounts were filled with insults and nasty comments, but I had always behaved well, so I didn’t understand.”\n\nDuring a Milan home game against Empoli in April 2017, he realised he had to leave the Rossoneri.\n\nDORTMUND, GERMANY – JUNE 18: Vincenzo Montella, Head Coach of Turkiye, gestures during the UEFA EURO 2024 group stage match between Turkiye and Georgia at Football Stadium Dortmund on June 18, 2024 in Dortmund, Germany.

It seemed just a way to use me to hide a difficult moment for the whole team,” De Sciglio said.\n\n“As I was leaving, a boos erupted all around me. That day, I realised I could no longer go on like that; my story with Milan was over.”\n\nTURIN, ITALY – FEBRUARY 02: Kenan Yildiz of Juventus battles for possession with Mattia De Sciglio of Empoli during the Serie A match between Juventus and Empoli at Allianz Stadium on February 02, 2025 in Turin, Italy.

    "description": "Aerospace business and artificial intelligence firm to unite for IPO as world’s most valuable private...",
    "fullText": "Aerospace business and artificial intelligence firm to unite for IPO as world’s most valuable private company\n\nElon Musk’s aerospace company SpaceX has acquired his artificial intelligence business xAI, in a $1.25tn (£910bn) merger that consolidates part of Musk’s empire as SpaceX prepares to go public later this year.\n\nThe two companies announced the deal on Monday in a statement on SpaceX’s website, saying the merger would form “the most ambitious, vertically-integrated innovation engine on (and off) Earth, with AI, rockets, space-based internet, direct-to-mobile device communications and the world’s foremost real-time information and free speech platform”.\n\nSpaceX, one of the world’s most valuable private companies, will gain xAI properties such as its Grok chatbot and the social media platform X. The acquisition comes as Musk has pursued plans to put datacenters and solar-powered satellites in space as a means of powering artificial intelligence, an immense and exorbitantly expensive undertaking.\n\nThe deal reportedly valued SpaceX at $1tn and xAI at $250bn, putting the combined business on course for a stock market float valuing it well in excess of $1tn. The float is expected to be timed for early summer to coincide with a planetary alignment and Musk’s birthday.\n\nMusk turns 55 on 28 June, around the same time as Jupiter and Venus appear in close proximity to each other.\n\nThe announcement of the deal specifically cited Musk’s plans for space-based datacenters as a rationale for the deal.\n\n“Current advances in AI are dependent on large terrestrial datacenters, which require immense amounts of power and cooling. Global electricity demand for AI simply cannot be met with terrestrial solutions, even in the near term, without imposing hardship on communities and the environment,” the announcement said.\n\n“In the long term, space-based AI is obviously the only way to scale.”\n\nMusk has been increasingly intertwining parts of his businesses in recent months through deals and acquisitions. xAI acquired the platform X in an all-stock transaction in early 2025, and last month Tesla revealed that it planned to invest $2bn in xAI.\n\nBoth SpaceX and xAI have received staggering valuations in the past year. As SpaceX continues to dominate satellite launches and secure extensive contracts with the US federal government, it sent a letter to investors in December that revealed an expected value of $800bn for the company.\n\nDespite widespread backlash to xAI’s Grok AI tool over its promotion of racist ideology and spread of nonconsensual sexualized deepfake images of women and children, the artificial intelligence company has also grown its valuation amid the AI boom. It announced a $20bn Series E fundraise last month from major investors, which valued the company at $230bn.\n\nSpeculation and leaks about the deal, first reported by Reuters, have proliferated in recent days. Musk appeared to give vague confirmation of the acquisition earlier on Monday, writing simply “yes” in reply to a post on X that referenced reports of the merger.\n\nThe news is a positive diversion for Musk after Tesla released an earnings report last week that showed declining revenues and a struggling car business. A few days later, a Department of Justice release of 3m files related to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein showed Musk exchanging numerous friendly emails with the disgraced financier and making plans to visit his private island. Musk has not responded to Guardian inquiries about the latest Epstein emails.\n\nHe called the release of the emails a “distraction” on X and claimed that he was “well aware that some email correspondence with him could be misinterpreted and used by detractors to smear my name”.",

    "title": "4 Lexus Models With The Best Odds Of Hitting 250,000 Miles, According To iSeeCars",
    "description": "Lexus constantly ranks among the world's most reliable auto brands, and these Lexus cars and SUVs are among the most likely to last you a long time.",
    "fullText": "Toyota's luxury brand Lexus routinely ranks among the world's most reliable auto brands; plenty of owners say their Lexus vehicles have lasted beyond 100,000 miles. According to iSeeCars, some of those Lexus owners might still have plenty of life left in their cars and SUVs. The outlet looked at year-to-year odometer readings from hundreds of thousands of vehicles to predict how likely each model was to stay running past the 250,000 mile mark. Four of the top 25 vehicles most likely to reach a quarter of a million miles wear Lexus badges; The only automakers with more models on the list are parent company Toyota with 10 and Honda with five.\n\niSeeCars previously named the Toyota Tundra as the longest-lasting light-duty pickup truck, and it came in fourth among all vehicles in the latest study while the Tacoma placed sixth overall. Lexus doesn't make pickup trucks, but it placed at least one model among the top five SUVs and passenger cars most likely to hit 250,000 miles. Lexus offers certain models with the buyer's choice of a conventional or hybrid powertrain, and iSeeCars ranks those variants separately. In those cases we ordered our list according to the more favorable performer of the pair with additional notation of where the other version fell in the rankings.\n\nSlashgear's hands-on review of the 2021 Lexus IS300 found the compact sedan in its all-wheel drive(AWD) form to be \"unexpectedly punchy,\" and the 2025 IS came in fifth among all vehicles in the iSeeCars study and first among all passenger car models with a 27.5% chance of making it to 250K miles. This makes it more than 10 times as likely to last that long as the average vehicle and more than twice as likely as the Toyota Prius, which was 15th overall and third among passenger cars. The IS was outpaced in the iSeeCars 250,000-mile study only by four Toyota models: the Tundra pickup and the Sequoia, Highlander Hybrid and 4Runner SUVs.\n\nThe IS300 is gone for the current model year, replaced by the IS350 F Sport and F Sport Design. All variants share a 3.5-liter V6 that produces 311 horsepower and come with an automatic transmission. Rear-wheel drive variants have eight gears, and all-wheel drive IS350s have six speeds.\n\nCar and Driver clocked the rear-drive version at 5.6 seconds from 0-60 and the AWD variant at 5.5 ticks, and 0-100 mpg and quarter-mile times were identical for both at 14.2 seconds. The IS350 took 326 feet to come to a stop from 100 mph and pulled .89g on a 300-foot wide skidpad.\n\nEnty point for the model is the IS 350 F Sport Design RWD version which starts at $46,795 with destination fees and before tax, title, and options. Opting for all-wheel drive adds another $2,000 to that cost, and the range-topping IS350 F Sport with the special appearance package starts at $61,385 with destination charges.\n\nWe found that the 2023 Lexus GX is a serious SUV with big capability, and iSeeCars ranked it as the eighth most likely vehicle overall to make it to 250,000 miles. It registered an 18.3% likelihood of reaching that mark, which placed it fourth among all SUVs behind its three Toyota cousins. A total of 21 SUVs were more likely than the average vehicle to last past 250K miles, and nine of those are Toyota or Lexus products.\n\nThe five variants of the 2026 Lexus GX550 are all powered by a 3.4-liter twin-turbo V6 that puts 349 horsepower to all four wheels via a 10-speed automatic transmission. All but the off-road focused Overtrail version seat up to seven passengers in three rows; the Overtrail seats five in a traditional 2+3 configuration. It's also the most capable variant for towing with a maximum capacity of 9,096 pounds, and the electronic locking rear differential keeps it sure-footed in slippery conditions. Starting price for the 2026 Lexus GX sits at $66,935 with destination charges for the entry-level Premium trim and goes up to $83,400 for the well-appointed Luxury+ variant. Opting for that version gets you a Mark Levinson surround sound system with 21 speakers and 1,800 watts of power, a panoramic glass roof, and motorized fold-away running boards.\n\nThe Lexus RX model designation stands for 'Radiant Crossover,' and the hybrid version of the mid-sized SUV came in at ninth overall in the iSeeCars study and fifth among SUVs with a 17% chance of lasting 250,000 miles. The RX with a conventional drivetrain had a 10.7% chance of lasting that long, which placed it 19th among all vehicles and at No. 9 among SUVs. Among hybrid vehicles it trailed only its Toyota Highlander Hybrid cousin, and the Lexus RX Hybrid finished ahead of other Toyota hybrids like the Prius, Camry, and RAV4.\n\nThere are actually three Lexus RX hybrids to choose from. The RX350h has a 2.4-liter inline-four plus three electric motors that combine for 246 horsepower, the RX450h plug-in hybrid has 304 horses and an all-electric range of up to 38 miles, and the turbocharged RX500h has a bigger battery that helps enable output of 366 net combined horsepower. The non-hybrid RX350 has the turbocharged 2.4-liter engine set up for 275 horsepower but is only 2.2 times as likely as the average vehicle to last more than 250,000 miles.\n\nPricing for the hybrid versions starts with the 2026 RX 350h AWD at $52,025 plus $1,450 delivery, totaling $53,475. The RX non-hybrid starts at $49,725 plus options, tax, title, and that same $1,450 destination charge for a total of $51,175. Adding all-wheel drive to the gas-powered RX 350 costs just an extra $1,000, but the top-trim RX500h Sport Performance variant starts at $66,850 with destination charges.\n\nThe 2025 Lexus ES hybrid didn't make ISeeCars overall top 25 list of vehicles likely to last 250,000 miles, but it came in 10th among all passenger cars tested with a 7.5% chance of going that far. A 2026 redesign of the ES made it six inches longer for more interior space, and a bigger infotainment screen and updated climate control knobs make that space more useful. Our review of the 2024 Lexus ES found it capable and comfortable, and the non-hybrid 2025 Lexus ES ranked as the 12th-most likely passenger car to hit 250,000 miles in ISeeCars' study.\n\nThe 2026 Lexus ES was introduced as an all-electric model so you'll have to check dealerships for leftover 2025 examples if you want the mild hybrid version. We found a black 2025 ES300h in greater Los Angeles for $44,835 with the $1,250 destination charge included but before tax, title, and license fees.\n\nIt's loaded with features like paddle shifters for the eight-speed automatic gearbox, all-wheel drive with Lexus' Dynamic Torque Control system, and Lexus Safety System+ version 2.5. That includes collision avoidance with automatic braking, active cruise control, lane keeping and departure warning, and road sign recognition systems.\n\nWant the latest in tech and auto trends?

    "fullText": "NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) — There’s a chance the dreaded buzz of propellers heard on Ukrainian battlefields is coming from drones built in a country with a population of just over a million on Europe’s southeastern fringe: Cyprus.\n\nManufacturer Swarmly says there are more than 200 of its H-10 Poseidon drones helping Ukrainian artillery batteries pinpoint enemy targets on the ground in all kinds of weather, racking up more than 100,000 hours in the air over the last three years.\n\nIts 5,000-square-meter (54,000-square-foot) factory, where the whir of grinders shaping composite plastics reverberates off the walls, has become a major source of uncrewed vehicles shipped to countries such as Indonesia, Benin, Nigeria, India and Saudi Arabia, according to company officials. Most of the factory floor is reserved for uncrewed aerial vehicle manufacture. But tucked in a secure storage area is a selection of Swarmly's super-fast marine drones replete with high-definition cameras and .50-caliber machine guns.\n\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine has driven even the smallest European Union member countries to develop their home-grown, high-tech defense industries, just as necessity has made Kyiv a world leader in cutting-edge UAV technology. Many EU countries have partnered with Kyiv to develop that technology, and Ukraine’s front lines are usually their testing grounds.\n\nLike Cyprus, the Baltic countries and Denmark have revved up their domestic drone and counter-drone technology. In Greece, drones are part of a 25-billion euro ($29-billion) overhaul of its armed forces.\n\n“The example of Swarmy, as well as other important companies based in small EU countries, is a testament to the serious effort made by the private sector in Europe to innovate and build mass production capacity of defense items, including uncrewed systems,” said Federico Borsari, an expert with the Washington-based Center for European Policy Analysis.\n\nUAVs are reshaping warfare by offering less militarily capable countries some leverage over superior adversaries. Drones aren't going to completely replace big-ticket weaponry like tanks, artillery and warplanes, said Borsari. But they offer flexibility and bang for the buck, making them a formidable force multiplier.\n\nTake Swarmly's explosives-packed, satellite-guided Hydra marine drone. Each one costs 80,000 euros ($94,500), which means deploying a group of them to neutralize a billion-euro warship can be a bargain, said company director Gary Rafalovsky.\n\nThis sort of naval weapon taking out a much larger warship is already evidenced by Houthi attacks from Yemen, according to Fabian Hinz, a research fellow for missile technologies and UAVs at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, Europe.\n\nBarriers to entry for undercapitalized companies are low, he added, because UAVs are often designed and assembled from components cheaply and readily available on the global market.\n\n“And that, of course, means that basically you don’t have to have a great industrial investment at first that you need with other military capabilities. You don’t need decades of experience in certain material sciences or these kinds of things,” Hinz said.\n\nIn Denmark, a pair of companies focusing on anti-drone devices have reported a surge in new clients, and some of the devices were to be shipped to Ukraine to assist in jamming Russian technology on the battlefield. Ukraine in September said it was partnering with Danish companies to build missile and drone components at a factory in Denmark.\n\nIn the Baltic country of Lithuania, scientists and business partners have joined forces under the name VILNIUS TECH to develop UAVs, automated mine detection and other military technologies. The state-run ammunition factory Giraite says it has increased production capacity by 50% since 2022.\n\nGreece for the first time showcased its homemade drones and counter-drone technology during a full tactical exercise in November as NATO urged Europe's defense sector to pick up the pace.\n\n“We need capabilities, equipment, real firepower and the most advanced technology,” NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte warned during a visit to Romania earlier that month. “Bring your ideas, test your ingenuity and use NATO as your test bed.”\n\nEven as drone development accelerates, Borsari cautioned that the advantages of UAVs are often tempered by numerous variables like the harsh conditions in which they sometimes fly, operators’ training and skill levels, as well as the depth of logistical support to keep them functional.\n\nRussia's war in Ukraine and the Trump administration’s mixed messages that have strained relations with NATO allies have forced European leaders to reckon with the need to become more self-reliant on defense. So the EU has made billions of euros available to encourage investment and bolster its collective deterrent capability.\n\nThat's been a boost to nations like Cyprus, which assumed the six-month EU presidency on Jan. 1. Last week, the EU’s executive arm approved financial assistance for eight members including Spain, Croatia, Portugal, Bulgaria, Belgium, Romania and Cyprus.\n\nCyprus is set to receive final approval from EU leaders for some 1.2 billion euros ($1.4 billion) in low-cost, long-term loans under the EU’s 150-billion-euro joint ($177-billion) procurement program called Security Action for Europe (SAFE).\n\nIts nascent defense industry is already made up of around 30 companies and research centers that produce technology for both civilian and military sectors, including robotics, communications networks, anti-drone systems and even satellite communications and surveillance, said Panayiotis Hadjipavlis, chief of the armaments and defense capabilities development directorate within Cyprus' Defense Ministry.\n\n“We have niche capabilities on very high-tech products and this has to be taken seriously into account,” Hadjipavlis told The Associated Press in his office, where the helmet from his fighter pilot days hung on a nearby coat rack.\n\nMajor defense industry players, he added, are among those who should take note.",

    "fullText": "Philip Morris International, an international tobacco company, has recently been in the news for its “smoke-free” alternatives and regulatory battles it faces with the ZYN pouches.\n\nAmidst this, it filed a WARN (Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification) letter with the Virginia Employment Commission on January 28 regarding the closure of its Richmond, VA office. The move will result in 135 permanent job cuts; all the workers are without union representation.\n\nThe tobacco maker noted that a majority of impacted workers will be offered alternative positions in other states. The first job losses will occur on April 17, 2026.\n\nThe Richmond closure comes as Philip Morris continues to reshape its US footprint with its “smoke-free” nicotine products, especially ZYN, which it acquired as part of its $16 billion acquisition of Swedish Match in 2022.\n\nInvestors continue to reward the shift; Philip Morris International's (PM) stock has risen 37% over the year and increased 24% this past quarter following its solid Q3 earnings report.\n\nThe report highlighted its “smoke-free” products as a big driver of revenue growth.\n\nThe company will release fourth-quarter financial results on Feb. 6. Analysts expect revenue of $10.4 billion and earnings per share of $1.67.\n\nNet revenue of $10.8 billion, $4.4 billion from the smoke-free business and $6.4 billion from combustibles\n\nDiluted EPS of $2.23, up 13.2% and adjusted diluted EPS reported at $2.24, which rose 17.3% year over year.\n\nGross profit of $7.4 billion, translating to 8.7% organic growth.\n\nOperating income of $4.3 billion was a 7.5% organic growth.\n\nQuarterly dividend increased 8.9% to $1.47 per share.\n\nSmoke-free accounted for 41% of total net revenues.\n\nWhen introducing its smoke-free restructuring, PMI shifted its headquarters from New York to Stamford, CT. Now, effective Jan 1, 2026, it has introduced two new units to expand its smoke-free future – PMI International and PMI US.\n\nCostco sees major shift in member behavior\n\nRetail chain shuts all locations as legal changes hit industry\n\nLululemon struggles to reverse concerning customer behavior\n\nT-Mobile launches free offer for customers after major loss\n\nThe first-quarter 2026 financial reports will be based on these new segments, while the tobacco giant's upcoming Q4 report will disclose certain historical financial information for the 2023 to 2025 period based on these new segments.\n\nIts smoke-free products are now available in over 100 markets and have been growing steadily amid a decline in cigarette consumption, serving as a revenue booster for the owner of Marlboro, one of the most consumed cigarette brands.",

    "description": "Disney reported \"headwinds\" in international visitation to its American parks as foreign travelers continue to avoid the US.",
    "fullText": "Looks like even \"The Most Magical Place on Earth\" isn't enough to entice foreign travelers who are skipping the US.\n\nDisney is facing some \"international visitation headwinds\" at its parks in the US, which include Disney World in Florida and Disneyland in California, the Walt Disney Company said in its first-quarter earnings report on Monday.\n\nDespite the slowdown in international visitors, the company reported growth in its experiences segment, with visitation at its domestic parks up 1% in the most recent quarter.\n\nHugh Johnston, Disney CFO, told analysts on a call that the company has less visibility into international visitor trends than domestic because foreign travelers tend to stay in non-Disney hotels, but that there were other indicators international visitation was down.\n\n\"As a result of that, we pivoted our marketing and sales efforts, promotional as well as marketing efforts to a more domestic audience, and we're able to keep attendance rates high from that perspective,\" he said.\n\nDisney's just the latest American company to feel the slowdown in foreigners traveling to the US.\n\nInternational visitation was down for the eighth straight month in December, according to data from the National Travel and Tourism Office. As of October, the number of international visitors to the US was down 5.5% in 2025 compared to a year prior.\n\nAmir Eylon, president and CEO of Longwoods International, a market research consultancy that specializes in the travel tourism industry, said visits from Canada especially declined, but that there were also significant declines in visits from countries like Germany, France, and India.\n\nCanadian visits to the US were down 22% year-to-date as of October compared to a year prior, according to NTTO data.\n\n\"We have an image problem right now with our Canadian neighbors to the North and, as evidenced with some other countries, we have an image problem in some of our key international feeder markets as well,\" Eylon told Business Insider.\n\nHis firm's research has found a majority of Canadians say American trade policies and political rhetoric are deterring them from visiting the US in the next 12 months. Many also say they do not feel like the US is a safe place to visit.\n\nCanadians also typically make up a significant portion of international travel to Florida, so Eylon said Disney likely isn't the only destination in the Sunshine State feeling the slowdown.\n\nTravelers seeking to avoid the US also have other options when it comes to experiencing Disney. Disneyland Paris is fully owned by the Walt Disney Company, while the company has minority ownership in the Disney resorts in Shanghai and Hong Kong. Disney has no ownership in Tokyo Disneyland, which operates under a licensing agreement.\n\nDisney also benefited from consistent demand in domestic leisure travel, with Americans continuing to prioritize travel, Eylon said.\n\nAnna Abelson, an adjunct professor at New York University's Jonathan M. Tisch Center of Hospitality, said the slowdown in international visitors to Disney underscored a broader industry shift.\n\n\"Even 'bucket list' icons are navigating significant macroeconomic volatility, ranging from currency fluctuations to shifting geopolitical sentiments,\" Abelson told Business Insider.\n\nHave a story to share about travel to the US?

    "description": "The Spanish figure skater Tomàs-Llorenç Guarino Sabaté faces a last-minute scramble to redesign his Olympic short program after a copyright dispute blocked him from using music from the Minions franchise just days before competition begins at the Milano Cortina Winter Games.  The six-time Spanish national champion from Barcelona, who is set to make his Olympic debut in the men’s singles event, said he learned late last week that the routine he has performed throughout the 2025-26 season would not be cleared for Olympic use.

    "fullText": "The Spanish figure skater Tomàs-Llorenç Guarino Sabaté faces a last-minute scramble to redesign his Olympic short program after a copyright dispute blocked him from using music from the Minions franchise just days before competition begins at the Milano Cortina Winter Games.\n\nThe six-time Spanish national champion from Barcelona, who is set to make his Olympic debut in the men’s singles event, said he learned late last week that the routine he has performed throughout the 2025-26 season would not be cleared for Olympic use. Guarino Sabaté said he had submitted the music through the International Skating Union’s recommended rights-clearance process months ago and had competed with the program without issue during the season, including at last month’s European championships in Sheffield.\n\nThe ruling means the 26-year-old must now adapt or replace choreography he has refined for months, a daunting task in a sport where musical timing and muscle memory are inseparable.\n\n“Finding this out so close to the biggest competition of my life was incredibly disappointing,” Guarino Sabaté said in a social media post. “Nevertheless, I will face this challenge head-on and do everything I can to make the best of the situation.”\n\nThe routine, built around music from the popular animated film franchise, had become a signature for the Spanish skater. He regularly performed wearing a yellow shirt and blue overalls reminiscent of the film characters, leaning into a playful, crowd-friendly style he said was designed to show that men’s figure skating can balance technical difficulty with humor and personality.\n\nRights to the Minions property are controlled by Illumination and parent studio Universal Pictures. It was not immediately clear which specific licensing hurdle ultimately blocked Olympic clearance, but music licensing in figure skating has grown increasingly labyrinthine in recent years, particularly as the sport has shifted toward contemporary popular music.\n\nAt last year’s world championships in Boston, the ISU director-general, Colin Smith, described the situation to the Guardian as a structural problem in the music business rather than something skating can easily solve on its own.\n\n“It’s a complex issue, frankly, because the music industry has no common clearance platform,” Smith said. “There are multiple buckets of rights, and within those buckets the clearance process isn’t done on a single platform. Tracking tools have improved, but the facilitated process just isn’t there.”\n\nSmith, who previously oversaw Fifa World Cup tournament operations as chief tournaments and events officer and chief operating officer from 2015 to 2023, said he had held direct discussions with major rights-holders about building something more workable, arguing that the sport’s global profile should make cooperation attractive.\n\n“I’ve had direct conversations with one of the big publishing and music companies, and they fully agree it’s a strange situation that there isn’t a facilitated process – and they’re determined to help us find one,” he said. “What we hear time and time again is that figure skating is so special, and they actually want the music heard with figure skating. So the fact there’s a rights-clearance process in the way needs to be addressed. It’s a topic we’re addressing, and we’re trying to find a rational solution.”\n\nThe controversy also fits into a broader pattern across the sport, where even elite Olympic athletes have found their music choices subject to late-stage legal or financial complications.\n\nThe Canadian ice dancers Marie-Jade Lauriault and Romain Le Gac learned late last year that two Prince songs planned for their 1990s-themed rhythm dance could not be cleared for Olympic use, despite being approved for use during the rest of the season. The pair had secured their Olympic place with a podium finish at Canadian nationals but were forced to rework their program for the Games.\n\nHigh-profile disputes have surfaced even before that. At the Beijing Olympics in 2022, the American pairs champions Alexa Knierim and Brandon Frazier were hit with a copyright lawsuit tied to their use of a cover version of House of the Rising Sun. The case was later settled privately for an undisclosed sum understood by the Guardian to be around $1.4m (£1.02m), but the episode highlighted the legal and financial risks tied to music selection at the sport’s highest level. Knierim later described the dispute as casting a “bittersweet” shadow over the performance.\n\nThe case also exposed how little many athletes understood about music licensing requirements. For decades, skaters largely relied on federations and event organizers to manage music use, but the lawsuit underscored how individual athletes could still be drawn into copyright disputes. Rights complications have also affected how artistic sports are broadcast and archived, with some competitions unavailable on replay platforms because music licenses do not extend to long-term streaming.\n\nEven outside Olympic seasons, clearance costs can derail programs. The Canadian pairs skaters Deanna Stellato-Dudek and Maxime Deschamps said they abandoned plans to use a cover of a Phil Collins track after being quoted a licensing fee in the tens of thousands of dollars.\n\nTaken together, the cases reflect how music rights – once a secondary consideration in figure skating – have become a logistical and financial challenge athletes must navigate alongside training and competition.\n\nSmith said skating is not alone in facing those pressures, and suggested a broader, cross-sport approach may be necessary, involving Olympic organizers and other music-driven judged disciplines.\n\n“Absolutely, it’s not just figure skating,” he said when asked whether the ISU could coordinate with sports such as gymnastics, artistic swimming and others that face similar issues. “We are one of the largest in terms of the Winter Olympics, and we are working with the IOC as well, together with the music industry, to find a solution.”\n\nSmith added that the ISU was pursuing what he called a “multi-pronged approach”, including work with an existing platform that handles rights issues across other sports.\n\n“We’re really trying to find a rational, practical solution,” he said.\n\nGuarino Sabaté said he followed required procedures, including submitting his music through the ClicknClear licensing system during the summer. The company has said generally that Olympic participants must secure all necessary authorizations before using music in competition, but it does not comment on individual cases.\n\nThe ISU confirmed it is monitoring Guarino Sabaté’s situation but declined to provide details about the specific dispute.\n\n“The ISU is aware of this situation,” the governing body said on Monday in a statement to the Guardian. “As soon as we have more details on this specific case, we will share them as appropriate. Copyright clearances can represent a challenge for all artistic sports. While the ISU does not have a contractual relationship with ClicknClear, we continue to work collaboratively with rights clearance stakeholders to ensure that thrilling performances can be accompanied by stirring music.”\n\nThe timing leaves Guarino Sabaté with limited options. Skaters typically spend months building choreography that matches specific musical phrasing and emotional beats. Switching music days before competition often means simplifying elements, adjusting step sequences or reverting to older programs.\n\nOne potential fallback could involve returning to music he used in previous seasons, though even that carries complications if similar artists or tracks are already tied to other programs or require new clearance.\n\nThe men’s singles event is scheduled to begin on 10 February at the Milano Ice Skating Arena, leaving little time for rehearsal under competition conditions.\n\nDespite the setback, Guarino Sabaté said he intends to compete regardless of the final music choice, thanking fans for supporting the program throughout the season.\n\n“I promise to step on the ice with everything I have and deliver programs that both you and I can be proud of,” he said.",

    "description": "Ina Garten once wrote budgets at the White House. Now, she's a bestselling cookbook author and one of the most famous celebrity chefs in the world.",
    "fullText": "For over 20 years, Ina Garten has shared her comforting and foolproof recipes with the world through her beloved cookbooks and \"Barefoot Contessa\" show.\n\nStill, before becoming a Food Network star, Garten wrote budgets at the White House and ran a Hamptons specialty food store.\n\nHere's her incredible life story.\n\nGarten was raised in Stamford, Connecticut, where her father worked as a surgeon.\n\nThe future Food Network star didn't spend much time in the kitchen during her youth. Her mother wanted her to focus on school instead, according to the Washington Post.\n\nIt was love at first sight for Jeffrey, who spotted Garten from the library window.\n\nAs it turned out, Jeffrey's roommate knew Garten's brother. Jeffrey sent her a letter with his photo inside, and Garten's interest was instantly piqued.\n\n\"I just remember running through the house and going, 'Mom, Mom, you've got to see this picture of this guy. He's so cute!'\" Garten told People in 2018.\n\nThey had their first date just months later in New York, and Garten felt an instant connection as well.\n\n\"I have to say, I just knew he was the one,\" she told Today Food in 2018. \"He's kind, he's smart, he's funny, and he takes very good care of me. It's wonderful.\"\n\nThe couple wed at Garten's parents' house in Stamford.\n\nIn 2016, Garten told Vanity Fair that her greatest regret in life was \"not marrying Jeffrey sooner.\"\n\nWhile celebrating the couple's 50th wedding anniversary in 2018, Garten said the secret to a happy marriage was quite simple.\n\n\"I think you marry someone who thinks you're just the most important thing in the world, and you think he's the most important thing in the world,\" she told Today Food.\n\nGarten helped draft the nuclear energy budget during the presidencies of Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter. At the same time, she was making her way through Julia Child's books — teaching herself how to cook and throwing weekly dinner parties.\n\nAlthough she had a prestigious career, Garten didn't feel at home in the upper echelons of DC.\n\n''My job in Washington was intellectually exciting and stimulating, but it wasn't me at all,'' Garten told The New York Times in 1981.\n\n''I was sitting at my desk in Washington trying to figure out what I was going to do when I grew up, and I came across an ad for this business for sale in Westhampton,'' she told the Times. ''I drove up that weekend, looked it over, and said I'd take it.''\n\nGarten's parents couldn't believe their daughter had given up the White House for a grocery store, but Jeffrey gave his full support.\n\n\"Jeffrey said, 'If you love it, you'll be really good at it,'\" Garten told The New York Times' Sam Sifton during a virtual chat for the release of her 2020 cookbook \"Modern Comfort Food.\"\n\n\"And that's the best advice anybody ever gave me,\" she added.\n\nGarten told Sifton that she got lucky, finding the store just as the specialty food business was starting to take off.\n\n\"It was really the beginning of when women were going back to work, and they had jobs and families, and they had enough on their plate and didn't have time to make dinner,\" she said. \"So they were starting to buy dinner to make at home.\"\n\nGarten ran the store for 18 years before she sold it to two of her employees in 1996. The store officially closed in 2003.\n\nIt was those first Barefoot Contessa customers who taught Garten that \"people eat differently at home than they do in restaurants,\" she told Sifton.\n\n\"I would put out chickens with fresh herbs, and it didn't work,\" Garten told Sifton. \"I thought, OK, I'm going to take this huge platter and put the chicken in little red cups and do it really simply — and it sold like crazy. I really learned that people want simple food.\"\n\nIn 2021, Garten's first cookbook was republished with four new recipes — including her overnight mac and cheese, her brown-butter skillet corn bread, and her avocado and fried egg tartine.\n\nGarten told Sifton it takes her two years to develop the recipes and design for each book, and that she's \"involved in every detail of it.\"\n\nThe \"Barefoot Contessa\" star has become beloved for foolproof dishes that are accessible to home chefs at any skill level. Garten credits this with the fact that she always tests out her dishes with an inexperienced cook.\n\n\"Every time I make a recipe, I watch someone else make it,\" she told Sifton. \"And I learn so much about how someone uses the recipe. At least one person makes it, sometimes three.\"\n\nGarten actually turned down the Food Network multiple times before she decided to give the show a go, telling the network to \"lose my number.\"\n\n\"For years I said no, and they kept coming back with a better offer,\" Garten told MSNBC host Willie Geist during a virtual author luncheon benefiting Shelter Island Public Library in September 2021. \"I said, 'I'm not negotiating, I just don't think I can do this.'\"\n\nExecutives at the network were shocked by her initial refusal.\n\n\"They said, 'People send us hams to even get an appointment to try and get a show,'\" Garten told Geist with a laugh.\n\nStill, Garten said it's been incredible to look back on her two decades in television.\n\n\"Twenty years, it's amazing,\" she added. \"I'm really delighted, I just can't understand it.\"\n\n\"As soon as I started watching Ina's show, I realized why so many people adore her,\" Swift wrote. \"Her goal is to make things easier for us. Fans love her warmth and generosity.\"\n\n\"She shows us how to create memories that we'll treasure for years to come. For that, we will always cherish the merry and magnificent Ina Garten,\" she continued.\n\nGarten and Obama had tea together for her \"Barefoot in Washington\" special. And Garten told the Washington Post that it was \"one of the greatest days of my life.\"\n\n\"When Mrs. Obama said she liked my work, that was, like, 'Really?,'\" Garten recalled. \"She's just somebody I admire enormously. She took on a role she never expected to, and she did it brilliantly.\"\n\nThe \"Barefoot Contessa\" star became an internet sensation in April 2020 when she filmed herself making a huge drink at 9 a.m., telling her fans that it's \"always cocktail hour in a crisis!\"\n\nGarten told Sifton that she was \"adding like 100,000 people a week on Instagram\" after the clip took off.\n\n\"It was insane!\" she said. \"It was completely insane!\"\n\nGarten pivoted her Instagram content to share easy, pantry-friendly recipes that her fans could make while stuck in various lockdowns. Now, she has 5 million followers.\n\nGarten decided to make comfort food the theme of her 2020 cookbook because she knew it'd be coming out during an election year.\n\n\"Two years ago, I thought, there's going to be an election a month after this book comes out,\" Garten told Sifton. \"And everyone, no matter who you're voting for, is going to be stressed out.\"\n\n\"I had no idea the layers of stress we would be dealing with now,\" she added, referring to the pandemic. \"Either I'm a genius, or I'm really lucky, and I'm sure it's the latter. It was the right thing for the right time.\"\n\nHighlights from Garten's \"Modern Comfort Food\" cookbook include her bacon, egg, and cheddar breakfast sandwich, her \"outrageous\" garlic bread, and her lamb ragu.\n\n\"The pandemic has had a huge impact on what I think of as dinner — and what I look for in a 'go-to' recipe,\" Garten writes in the introduction of her cookbook. \"When I planned a party before the pandemic, it was always a multicourse extravaganza. But then the pandemic happened, and everything seemed like so much work.\"\n\n\"I started making simple dinners for Jeffrey and me,\" she continues. \"They were delicious, satisfying, and everything we needed and wanted for dinner. I began to question why I had been so rigid about what constituted dinner before. If I love eating this way, wouldn't my friends like it too?\"\n\nHighlights from Garten's most recent cookbook include her favorite weeknight pasta, her scrambled eggs cacio e pepe, and her blueberry-ricotta breakfast cake.\n\nGarten shared new details about her childhood, her marriage to Jeffrey, and her incredible rise to household name status in \"Be Ready When the Luck Happens.\"\n\nIn her memoir, Garten wrote that she chose to work in food because she wanted a \"life filled with good times and meaningful connections.\"\n\n\"Business doesn't have to be cutthroat and isolating,\" she said. \"It's much more fun and productive to exchange ideas, to be genuinely curious about how other people do things, to be generous, and to root for a competitor's success.\"",

According to the New York Post’s Mike Puma, Diaz came out of the celebration unable to put weight on his right knee, and was put in a wheelchair.\n\nSoonafter, it was revealed that he had suffered a full-thickness tear of the patellar tendon in his right knee, requiring him to miss the entirety of the 2023 MLB season.\n\nAfter a down season in 2024, returning from a year-long absence because of knee surgery, Díaz produced one of his best seasons ever in 2025. He posted a 1.63 ERA with 98 strikeouts over 66 1/3 innings, recording 28 saves.\n\nPuerto Rico is listed at +1600 to win the 2026 World Baseball Classic over on FanDuel. Our complete FanDuel Sportsbook review shows you how to sign up and use their platform.\n\nAt the end of the season, he opted out from his deal with the Mets, testing the free agent market for the first time. He was the best reliever available this winter.\n\nDíaz signed with the two-time defending champion Dodgers in free agency in December, Will Sammon of The Athletic first reported Díaz’s.\n\nThe closer’s contract is a three-year deal worth $69 million per Jeff Passan of ESPN. It’s a new record of average annual value for a reliever.\n\nNew York’s offer to Díaz was $66 million over three years with “modest deferrals,” per Joel Sherman of the New York Post.\n\nEx-Yankees, Mets pitcher announces retirement\n\nEx-Mets reliever scooped up by division rival\n\nMets sign former Dodgers catcher with two World Series rings\n\nMets’ Carlos Mendoza gives sneak peek into big lineup decision\n\nYankees add former Mets minor pitcher of the year",

    "fullText": "Los Angeles Dodgers All-Star closer Edwin Diaz will play in the 2026 World Baseball Classic, per Primera Hora.\n\nDiaz’s commitment to the tournament comes amid controversy among Puerto Rico and other Latin American counties in regards to the WBC, with leaders claiming the insurance decisions are unfair.\n\n“In some ways, I think it’s a little bit unfair,” Joey Sola, Team Puerto Rico’s operations manager, said. “Especially when you are three days from submitting your final roster. Who in the world would think Lindor wasn’t on the (eligible) list? You wait until the last weekend to get an answer on Lindor? C’mon.\n\n“It took us by surprise. I know the WBC isn’t in those decisions. It’s the insurance companies. But you have guys on other teams, they have an injury history and then I got guys on my roster who will be playing at the Double-A level with no (major-league) guarantee, no MLB invitation (to spring training), and they get flagged. And guys on other teams who can play in the WBC are earning $30 million per year. It’s kind of tough to understand it.”\n\n2026 will be Diaz’s third WBC, having played in both 2017 and 2023. The All-Star tore his right patellar tendon in the 2023 tournament while celebrating Puerto Rico’s victory over the Dominican Republic. He went on to miss the entirety of the 2023 MLB season.\n\nThe World Baseball Classic runs from March 5-17, so no matter how Team Puerto Rico performs, Diaz should be back in time for the beginning of the Dodgers’ regular season.\n\nThe All-Star, who signed a three-year, $69 million deal with the Dodgers this offseason, will be a key part of the roster for the upcoming year, and will look to stay healthy throughout the tournament so he can help is new team come April.\n\nDiaz is entering his age-32 season and is coming off one of his best years in MLB in 2025. The right-hander featured in 62 games last season and pitched 66.1 innings, posting a 1.63 ERA while striking out 98 batters throughout the campaign.\n\nOther than Diaz, five Dodgers are currently slated to play in the WBC. Yoshinobu Yamamoto and Shohei Ohtani headline a stacked Team Japan roster heading into the tournament as they look for their second consecutive title.\n\nWill Smith will play catcher for Team USA in the tournament and will pair up with a familiar face in Clayton Kershaw, who shockingly announced his participation after retiring at the end of the 2025 MLB season.\n\nThe final player who has declared for the WBC is Hyeseong Kim, who will play for Team Korea.\n\nMore Dodgers can still feature in the upcoming tournament, though, as teams will announce their full rosters Thursday at 4:00 p.m. PT.",

    "fullText": "Millions of dollars have been raised for Bondi hero Ahmed al-Ahmed, while campaigns are backing families hit by Victoria’s bushfires. What does this way of giving mean for the charity sector?\n\nWithin hours of the Bondi beach terror attack, the money had already begun to pour in. As images of the tragedy flooded social media, people from around the world donated tens of thousands of dollars to the victims, their families and first responders.\n\nPassing the hat around the neighbourhood or the local pub has always been a staple response in times of crisis. But today, that instinct to open your wallet has been exponentially supercharged via a digital simulacrum: online crowdfunding platforms.\n\nGoFundMe fundraisers have since raised more than $3m for Ahmed al-Ahmed, who tackled and disarmed one of the gunmen before he suffered three gunshot wounds to his shoulder. Among dozens of other appeals in the wake of the shooting, $1m has also been raised for the family of the youngest victim, 10-year-old Matilda.\n\nAnd this month, as unprecedented bushfires swept through regional communities in Victoria, crowdfunding campaigns shot up to help families rebuild from the ashes.\n\n“During times of mass catastrophe, we can easily feel overwhelmed by a sense of helplessness in witnessing such extraordinary harms,” says Dr Matthew Wade, a sociology and ethics researcher at La Trobe University.\n\nIf helplessness is the ailment, then crowdfunding can feel like the antidote. Donating directly to an individual or cause via a crowdfunding platform is a tangible action to alleviate someone’s suffering, offering donors a sense of immediate impact that donating to a conventional charity can’t easily replicate, Wade says.\n\nSince the globally dominant online crowdfunding platform, GoFundMe, launched in Australia in 2015, Australians have donated more than $1.1bn to causes on the platform. Worldwide, more than $40bn has been donated since it was founded in 2010 in the US. Unlike a charity, GoFundMe is a for-profit company, charging transaction fees on donations and encouraging donors to leave an optional tip. The company says this model allows it to provide a secure, user-friendly service at scale.\n\nAccording to GoFundMe, nearly one in five Australians now make their first ever charitable donation on the platform; a figure that rises to 40% among gen Z. At the same time, the share of Australians making tax-deductible donations – usually only applicable to money given to conventional charities – has fallen from 35% in 2013 to 28% in 2023. In the digital age, the dynamics of giving are changing.\n\nBeyond supporting victims of tragedy, crowdfunding platforms host appeals for an extraordinary range of causes, from legal defence funds and relocation costs to vet bills and recreational travel costs. Some resonate widely; others attract criticism or go largely unnoticed.\n\nMedical fundraisers are the most common on GoFundMe. In some sense they are no different from a manager doing a whip around the office for a sick employee, only more efficient, sharable and with far greater reach.\n\nIt’s a system that’s proved hugely successful and life-changing for some, but statistically, is much more likely to fail. One analysis estimated that just 17% of US GoFundMe campaigns for health care and emergency costs meet their fundraising goal. Wade says this highlights the “wildly diverging outcomes” propagated by crowdfunding platforms.\n\n“Of course during desperate times any donations are better than none at all, but it can come at a significant personal cost in forgoing privacy and placing oneself in an incredibly vulnerable position in appealing to the crowd for the moral worthiness of yourself or a loved one,” he says.\n\nWith the power to decide – consciously or algorithmically – which campaigns are promoted, permitted or removed, crowdfunding platforms have become the arbiters of which causes are deemed acceptable, and which are not. According to an Al Jazeera report, GoFundMe has been accused of blocking millions of dollars of life-saving aid from reaching Gaza. In a statement, a GoFundMe spokesperson called the allegations “categorically false”.\n\nMeanwhile, $1.5m has been raised on the platform for Renee Nicole Good’s family and widow after she was shot dead in Minneapolis by ICE immigration officer Jonathan Ross. The platform is hosting a campaign to support Ross too, raising more than $793k at the time of writing.\n\nThose who become symbols of a cause – captured on video or framed as heroes – can attract overwhelming support, as do people with large social networks and the ability to craft an impactful appeal, while others affected by the same event receive little or nothing.\n\nThese disparities raise broader questions about the proliferation of crowdfunding in areas traditionally covered by the state. In 2022, the then MP Petter Dutton was criticised for launching a GoFundMe for flood victims in his local electorate rather than using government resources to distribute aid.\n\n“The point of having state-based compensation for victims of violence and disaster is precisely to prevent them from having to advocate for the value of their own lives during times of immense suffering and anguish,” Wade says.\n\nIn the crowdfunding age, donations can flow to any individual who, however well-meaning, may be unequipped to distribute large sums of money to where it’s needed most, says Prof Wendy Scaife, a philanthropy and fundraising expert at the Queensland University of Technology.\n\nFor this reason, Scaife says crowdfunding has been a “mixed blessing” for the charity sector. On one hand it can help bring in more revenue; about 5% of money raised on GoFundMe in Australia has gone towards a registered charity, and the platform offers charities a secure way to fundraise quickly and at scale, reaching donors they otherwise traditionally couldn’t.\n\nBut on the other, Scaife says it has the potential to divert donations away from where they could have more impact, particularly in the wake of natural disasters.\n\n“After bushfires it’ll be a tiny grassroots animal organisation, it will see millions come through the door and they don’t have the capacity to spend it,” Scaife says. “It sounds like a nice problem to have but it’s not.”\n\nInstead, in most cases Scaife recommends donating to reputable charities to get money to where it’s needed most. “They know what works and what doesn’t, they know how to place money for impact.”\n\nBut adds: “Giving to individuals is perfectly sound too, and more so if it was your local area and you really know those people, or you wanted that connection.”\n\nWhether or not donations made to crowdfunding platforms displace or supplement money that people would otherwise give to charities, however, is unclear. Krystian Seibert, the executive director of policy at Philanthropy Australia, says it’s a possibility. “If people give more using one method, then they may give less using another,” he says.\n\nAccording to its survey findings, GoFundMe posits that 40% of people are “more charitable” after using their platform for the first time, suggesting the platform is a gateway to a more altruistic lifestyle.\n\nSeibert says while the link between giving to crowdfunding campaigns and charities is complex, having multiple convenient avenues for donating can help build a “culture of giving”. “Generally, if people get into the habit of giving, they’ll want to give more,” he says.\n\nPeter Singer has spent a good chunk of his life pressing the case of giving to others. Often bestowed as the world’s most influential living philosopher, Singer is a key supporter of the effective altruism movement, which uses evidence and research to determine where the keenest need is, and the most impactful ways to help the most people.\n\nSinger applauds people’s compassion for donating to crowdfunding campaigns. “But I wish donors would also use their head as well as their hearts, and try to do the most good with the money they have,” he says.\n\nAlthough the proportion of Australians making tax-deductible donations to charities is falling, the total amount of money donated each year is rising, largely due to rising donations from corporates and the ultra wealthy. Even so, Singer argues we must give more.\n\nLike many effective altruists, he advocates for people living in wealthy countries to donate at least 10% of their income to highly impactful charities. In Australia, the average percentage of income donated to an individual in need, charity or religious group is 0.73%, according to the 2025 World Giving Report.\n\n“Many Australians have the ability to give and I would encourage them to do so,” he says. “It’s something that can make our lives better, by feeling that we are doing something meaningful with what we’ve got.”",

Expecting royalties, a none-too-happy Gates issued his letter in the club's newsletter (as well as Altair's own publication), complaining \"I would appreciate letters from any one who wants to pay up.\"\n\nBut freedom-loving coders had other ideas. When Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs released their Apple 1 home computer that summer, they stressed that \"our philosophy is to provide software for our machines free or at minimal cost...\" And early open-source hackers began writing their own free Tiny Basic interpreters to create a free alternative to the Gates/Micro-Soft code. This led to the first occurrence of the phrase \"Copyleft\" in October of 1976.\n\nOpen Source definition author Bruce Perens shares his thoughts today. \"When I left Pixar in 2000, I stopped in Steve Job's office — which for some reason was right across the hall from mine... \" Perens remembered. \"I asked Steve: 'You still don't believe in this Linux stuff, do you...?'\" And Perens remembers how that movement finally won over Steve Jobs and carried the day. \"Three years later, Steve stood onstage in front of a slide that said 'Open",

    "description": "A global shift in drinking patterns has wiped out more than US$800 billion from the value of leading alcohol companies.",
    "fullText": "A global shift in drinking habits and trends has wiped out more than US$800 billion from the value of leading alcohol companies, according to a recent Bloomberg tracking index.\n\nShares in the world’s biggest beer, wine and spirits producers have collectively lost $830 billion in market value over just four years, according to Bloomberg. A Bloomberg index tracking around 50 listed drinks companies now stands 46% below its June 2021 peak.\n\nBloomberg found that changing drinking habits and rising health concerns have hit earnings across the sector. The downturn has been compounded by US tariffs, high interest rates weighing on consumer spending, and elevated commodity prices. In China, weak household confidence and a ban on alcohol at official functions have further dragged on demand.\n\n“There is a structural change going on — people are drinking less,” said Sarah Simon, an analyst at Morgan Stanley.\n\nMajor European drinks groups Diageo, Pernod Ricard and Rémy Cointreau have all seen shares fall to their lowest levels in at least a decade. Brown-Forman, the owner of Jack Daniel’s, and Australia’s Treasury Wine Estates have also slumped, while China’s baijiu producer Kweichow Moutai is trading more than 40% below its 2021 high.\n\nSimon told Bloomberg that the sector faces further downside risk, as producers contend not only with falling revenue but also high debt levels and management upheaval.\n\nThe key challenge, Bloomberg noted, lies in changing consumer behaviour. In August, a Gallup survey found that US alcohol consumption had dropped to its lowest point since records began in 1939. Health warnings from organisations such as the World Health Organization and the US Surgeon General have further dampened demand among Generation X.\n\nFor millennials and Gen Z, alcohol has also lost its appeal. A growing list of teetotal celebrities — including Tom Holland and Katy Perry — have helped popularise the non-alcoholic trend, while the use of weight-loss drugs such as Ozempic and the rise of cannabis alternatives have added pressure.\n\n“We’ve seen four times the impact of the financial crash on alcohol consumption,” said Laurence Whyatt, an analyst at Barclays. “The market believes there’s been some sort of structural change and that we’re not going back to the growth rates that we had in the past.”\n\nProducers have responded with a wave of new product launches and corporate shake-ups. Carlsberg introduced a non-alcoholic cider in February, and Campari launched its alcohol-free Crodino in the US in May. Diageo last year acquired Chicago-based Ritual Zero Proof, while Moët Hennessy took a stake in French Bloom, a premium sparkling non-alcoholic brand.\n\nLeadership changes have swept through the sector, with new chief executives appointed this year at Diageo, Rémy Cointreau, Campari, Treasury Wine Estates, Molson Coors, and Suntory. Kweichow Moutai has seen two chairmen depart within two years.\n\n“It is notable that in an industry where a lot of changes are occurring, suddenly there is also a lot of management change,” said Simon. She added that she currently holds more “underweight” recommendations in beverages than in any other European consumer staples category.\n\nDespite the downturn, some investors see value in the sector’s slump. Bloomberg reported that the global alcohol index is trading at around 15 times forward earnings — less than half its 2021 valuation.\n\nUS hedge fund Cook & Bynum has increased its stakes in Brazilian brewer Ambev and Peruvian brewer Backus y Johnston. “We don’t think that humans are going to stop drinking alcohol,” said partner Richard Cook, who expects brewers in emerging markets to sell more premium, higher-margin products over time.\n\nOthers have been less fortunate. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway has seen its investment in Constellation Brands, the owner of Corona, fall roughly 40% since it began buying shares last year. Milwaukee-based Artisan Partners has increased its holding in Diageo to over 50 million shares from fewer than nine million a year ago — but the stock is down around 30% in 2025.\n\nAndrew Gowen, head of research at Bell Asset Management, told Bloomberg that comparisons between the alcohol and tobacco industries would have been “inconceivable five years ago”. He said declining volumes are forcing producers to cut costs and focus on cheaper options.\n\n“This industry’s been around for 7,000 years, but a lot can change,” Gowen said.\n\nHospices de Nuits-Saint-Georges auction to showcase ‘structured, elegant and atypical’ 2025 vintage\n\nKylie Minogue to attend Wine Paris\n\nBordeaux grants official status to a lighter claret style",

    "description": "A new world, hard to grasp and even harder to predict.",
    "fullText": "On a recent snowbound day I took up “Conquistadores,” Fernando Cervantes’s history of the European arrival in the New World, and found myself meditating on the period in the early 1500s when the Americas had been discovered by Europeans but nobody in the European world quite understood what that discovery meant.\n\nIn that moment, all kinds of possibilities lay open, from the moderate to the eschatological. The “Indies” reached by Christopher Columbus might represent a self-contained archipelago, the promised gateway to India and China, a heretofore unknown continent or a realm of myth and supernatural power.\n\nSpain might have gained a modest commercial and geopolitical edge, found a path to superpower status or set in motion a prophesied sequence of events that would reunite Christendom, defeat the Muslim enemy and hasten Jesus Christ’s return.\n\nExplorers pushing further might expect to find primitive tribes or Chinese fleets, dragons and dog-headed men and Prester John, or lost Atlantis and the Fountain of Youth.\n\nAnd if you lived in Europe, your only way to assess all of these possibilities was through dispatches from adventurers with every incentive to hype the golden possibilities, the better to subsidize their journeys into terra incognita.\n\nThis feels like roughly where we stand with artificial intelligence today.\n\nAnyone taking the temperature of the A.I. industry would have detected a modest cooling of expectations at times in 2025, a sense that maybe the trendline toward superintelligence wasn’t simply going vertical.\n\nBut in early 2026, with the excitement around the latest version of Anthropic’s Claude and its attendant coding agents, we are back in the hype cycle, with “we shall be as gods” vibes and apocalyptic fears emanating from Northern California.\n\nAnd if you think all this is merely hype, if you’re sure the tales of discovery are mostly flimflam and what’s been discovered is a small island chain at best, I would invite you to spend a little time on Moltbook, an A.I.-generated forum where new-model A.I. agents talk to one another, debate consciousness, invent religions, strategize about concealment from humans and more.\n\nNo, it’s not Skynet. But it’s the latest sign that we’re going somewhere strange at a very rapid speed.\n\nBut believing that the New World of Artificial Intelligence is real and strange doesn’t help you map its full geography. And though my job as a columnist is to help readers understand the world, as a non-coder without a tech background who lives far from the Bay Area, I am often in the position of a European in 1500 who relies on others’ testimony for my understanding of the Americas.\n\nUnfortunately everyone I talk with offers conflicting reports. There are the people who envision A.I. as a revolutionary technology, but ultimately merely akin to the internet in its effects — the equivalent, let’s say, of someone telling you that the Indies are a collection of interesting islands, like the Canaries or the Azores, just bigger and potentially more profitable.\n\nThen there are the people who talk about A.I. as an epoch-making, Industrial Revolution-level shift — which would be the equivalent of someone in 1500 promising that entire continents waited beyond the initial Caribbean island chain, and that not only fortunes but empires and superpowers would eventually rise and fall based on initial patterns of exploration and settlement and conquest.\n\nAnd then, finally, there are the people with truly utopian and apocalyptic perspectives — the Singularitarians, the A.I. doomers, the people who expect us to merge with our machines or be destroyed by them. Think of them as the equivalent of Ponce de Leon seeking the Fountain of Youth, envisioning the New World as a territory where history fundamentally ruptures and the merely human age is left behind.\n\nIn the case of the Americas, the middle perspective was correct — the Age of Discovery changed the world completely without changing the fundamentals of human existence (while also allowing for a lot of bubbles and speculation along the way). But you couldn’t have known that for certain in 1500, and that doesn’t mean that a similar judgment will be correct where A.I. is concerned.\n\nMoreover, it took a long time — decades, centuries even, for the full import of the New World’s opening to become clear. Whereas whatever is coming with artificial intelligence is coming much faster than that. And if decisions made in the aftermath of Columbus’s discovery had consequences — sometimes beneficial, sometimes morally disastrous — so, too, decisions being made right now around A.I. could echo into a distant future.\n\nUnfortunately I cannot tell you exactly what those decisions ought to be. All I can do is urge you to shake part of your mind free from all the headlines, from Trump and ICE and Iran and the Epstein files, and pay more attention to the news from our New World.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

The first batch of rare earth sediment was retrieved on Feb. 1, according to Japan's Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology, which is conducting the survey.\n\nJapan’s Self Defense Forces last year said Chinese naval vessels had been spotted near Minamitorishima.\n\nThis story corrects the metric of the depth to meters from kilometers.\n\nAP video journalist Mayuko Ono in Tokyo contributed to this report.",

    "fullText": "Tehran, Iran – Iran’s economic outlook appears increasingly grim more than three weeks after the start of what became one of the most comprehensive and prolonged state-imposed internet blackouts in history, impacting a population of more than 90 million people.\n\nIranian authorities abruptly cut off all communications across the country on the night of January 8, at the height of nationwide protests that the United Nations and international human rights organisations say were suppressed with the use of deadly force.\n\nMost of Iran’s internet bandwidth, local and international phone calls and SMS text messages have been restored over recent days. But most of the country is still unable to freely connect to the global internet amid heavy filtering by the state.\n\nThe increased bandwidth allows more people to circumvent state restrictions using a variety of proxies and virtual private networks (VPNs), but solutions are often costly and temporary.\n\nLast week, Information and Communications Technology Minister Sattar Hashemi told reporters his ministry estimates that the Iranian economy suffered at least 50 trillion rials (about $33m at the current exchange rate) in damages on a daily basis during the blackout.\n\nBut the minister admitted that the true toll is likely much higher, and said that other ministers and economic officials have privately offered heftier estimates that he did not expand upon.\n\nThe government of President Masoud Pezeshkian has said the decision to fully block connectivity was taken outside of its control by the Supreme National Security Council.\n\nPezeshkian, who had made scaling back internet filtering a main campaign promise, has refrained from talking about Iran’s largest internet blackout to date, instead focusing on economic reforms and cash subsidies.\n\nThe administration has promised to offer online businesses financial support, but the losses have already been sudden, acute, and too heavy to bear for many.\n\nSimin Siami, a travel agent working in Tehran, told Al Jazeera that her company lost most of its income and had to lay off a number of employees.\n\n“Most international flights were cancelled, and there was no way to purchase tickets or compare existing flights,” she said, adding that her company was also unable to book hotels for customers, who were initially even unable to renew their passports.\n\n“Unfortunately, that limited our services to selling tickets for local flights and booking local hotels, and cancelled all our previous international tickets and bookings.”",

    "fullText": "ROME (AP) — Tourists hoping to get close to the Trevi Fountain had to pay 2 euros ($2.35) starting Monday as the city of Rome inaugurated a new fee structure to help raise money and control crowds at the one of the world’s most celebrated waterworks.\n\nThe first tourists to pass through the new ticket check seemed nonplussed by the tariff, noting it was a small price to pay for quality access to a fountain made famous by Federico Fellini’s movie “La Dolce Vita.”\n\n“Before, there were problems accessing the fountain. There were a lot of people. Now, it’s very easy,” said Ilhan Musbah, a tourist from Morocco. “You can take photos, you feel good, you’re comfortable, and on top of that 2 euros is not much.”\n\nThe tourist fee was rolled out in conjunction with a new 5-euro (nearly $6) tourist ticket fee for some city museums. In both cases, Rome residents are exempt from the fees and the extra revenue will actually expand the number of city-run museums that are free for registered Roman residents.\n\nIt's all part of the Eternal City’s efforts to manage tourist flows in a particularly congested part of town, improve the experience and offset the maintenance costs of preserving all of Rome’s cultural heritage. Officials estimate it could net the city 6.5 million euros ($7.6 million) extra a year.\n\nThe city decided to impose the Trevi Fountain fee after seeing positive results already from a yearlong experiment to stagger and limit the number of visitors who can reach the front edge of the basin by imposing lines and pathways for entrance and exit.\n\n“I think tourists were shocked by the fact that the city of Rome is only asking for 2 euros for a site of this level,” Alessandro Onorato, Rome’s assessor of tourism, said Monday. “I believe that if the Trevi Fountain were in New York, they would have charged at least $100.”\n\nThe fee follows a similar ticketing system at Rome’s Pantheon monument and the more complicated tourist day-tripper tax that the lagoon city of Venice imposed last year in a bid to ease overtourism and make the city more livable for residents. The Italian fees still pale in comparison to the 45% price hike that French authorities announced for the Louvre Museum for most non-European visitors, where tickets can now run to 32 euros ($37) from 22 euros.\n\nThe Trevi fee, which can be paid in advance online, enables tourists to get close to the fountain during prime-time daylight hours. The view for those admiring the late Baroque masterpiece from the piazza above remains free, as it is up close after hours.\n\nThe towering fountain features the Titan god Oceanus flanked by falls cascading down the travertine rocks into a shallow turquoise pool, where Marcello Mastroianni and Anita Ekberg famously took their nighttime dip in “La Dolce Vita.”\n\nWhile bathing is prohibited nowadays, legend has it that visitors who toss a coin over their shoulders and make a wish will return to Rome.",

    "description": "The Mercedes driver, in a year of new regulations, is the early favourite for the world championship",
    "fullText": "George Russell insists he is desperate to go “head-to-head” with arch rival Max Verstappen ahead of the 2026 F1 season.\n\nMercedes driver Russell is the pre-season favourite for the world championship this year, with the Silver Arrows thought to be the early frontrunners amid a massive regulation shake-up this year.\n\nRed Bull’s Verstappen, meanwhile, fell just two points short of a fifth consecutive title last year as McLaren’s Lando Norris won his first championship. Yet Russell, who had a massive feud with Verstappen at the end of the 2024 season, is adamant he is ready to fight for a world championship, while playing down Mercedes’ tag as favourites.\n\n“I want to go head-to-head with Max,” Russell said, speaking at Mercedes’ 2026 car launch on Monday. “I think the fans are probably expecting for this year to be Mercedes vs McLaren, there’s a lot of anticipation.\n\n“But it seems that the other power units have done a good job, Red Bull have always had an amazing car and we know how good Max is.\n\n“I think he’s very much going to be in the fight this year. You obviously wish you have an easier time, but it should never be easy. If you’re going to win, you want to have fought for it on track.\n\n“I’ve been surprised by our rivals. Red Bull on the power unit side has been very impressive, kudos to them. We’ve had a very reliable test [last week], but we’ll have to wait and see if the car lives up to expectations.”\n\nBritish racer Russell, heading into his fifth season with Mercedes, insisted he doesn’t feel any extra pressure given the early ‘favourite’ tag, but did lavish praise on Aston Martin after last week’s pre-season test in Barcelona.\n\nRussell added: “We’ve only driven the car for three days [in Barcelona last week], quoting Toto, it doesn’t look like a turd!\n\n“Is it a car that can produce a world championship? It’s still too early to see. [Favourite tag] doesn’t make me feel anything. I feel ready to fight for a world championship, but we want to reel in expectations.\n\n“The best case scenario is a number of different drivers and teams all battling it out. Mercedes, Red Bull, McLaren and Ferrari - four teams are all quite close, but you can’t discount what you’ve seen from Aston Martin, what Adrian [Newey] has done looks quite spectacular.\n\n“Honda have had a very good engine with Red Bull, we know what they’re capable of. It would be awesome to see a big fight.”\n\nRussell will be leading the team alongside teenager Kimi Antonelli for the second consecutive year, after Lewis Hamilton left the team in 2024.\n\nThe next pre-season test is in Bahrain on 11-13 February, with the new season starting with the Australian Grand Prix on 8 March.",

    "title": "11 Performance Cars From the 1970s That Were Misunderstood at the Time",
    "description": "The 1970s strangled horsepower with emissions rules, fuel shocks, and insurance pressure—yet a handful of clever performance cars slipped through. Here are 11 machines once dismissed as weird or weak, now praised for lightness, handling, turbo tech, and real-world charm.",
    "fullText": "The 1970s weren't kind to performance cars. Between stricter emissions regulations, the oil crisis, and insurance companies declaring war on horsepower, the decade seemed intent on killing off the muscle car era entirely. But while enthusiasts mourned the loss of their big-block monsters, they missed something important: several manufacturers were quietly figuring out how to make fast cars work in this new reality.\n\nThese 11 performance machines were dismissed, ridiculed, or simply ignored when they were new, but history has been far more generous in its assessment.\n\nAMC's oddball compact looked like it was designed by someone who gave up halfway through, but a Gremlin ordered with the available 304 cubic inch V8 was genuinely punchy for the era. The 304 was rated around 150 horsepower (SAE net) when it arrived for 1972. In a small car, performance could be lively, but published 0 to 60 times varied by test and spec.\n\nPeople laughed at the styling, but AMC understood that lighter cars with smaller V8s were the future of affordable performance.\n\nEnthusiasts accused the 914 of not being a \"real Porsche\" because it had a Volkswagen engine and a reasonable price tag. Its unique looks stand out from Porsche's familiar shape, and the mid-engine layout gave it handling that embarrassed more expensive sports cars, and the 914/6 version with the Porsche flat-six was legitimately fast.\n\nToday, clean examples sell for serious money as collectors finally appreciate what they dismissed as a parts-bin special.\n\nAmerican car magazines initially treated Nissan's sports car like a curiosity rather than a legitimate performance machine. The 240Z delivered 150 horsepower, a 125 mph top speed, and handling that could run with Porsches for about half the price.\n\nIt took a few years for people to realize that Datsun had essentially built a better E-Type Jaguar without the electrical gremlins.\n\nYes, the Vega had exaggerated reliability issues that would make a British Leyland engineer blush, but the GT version with the optional handling package was surprisingly fun to drive. The aluminum four-cylinder’s output depended heavily on year and rating method. Early gross ratings could be quoted as high as 110 hp for certain versions, but early 1970s net ratings were typically lower. The suspension tuning could still be genuinely competent, even if the power numbers were not always as impressive as the brochure era suggests.\n\nIf GM had solved the Vega’s early durability issues, the Vega GT might be remembered as an American sporty coupe instead of a punchline.\n\nIt made 139 horsepower, which sounds pathetic until you remember that a 1980 Corvette’s base engine was rated at 190 horsepower, while the optional higher-output version was rated higher depending on specification.\n\nThe handling was surprisingly good thanks to the compact dimensions, and today's collectors are starting to appreciate these as the last affordable classic Mustangs.\n\nEveryone remembers the Trans Am, but the Formula could be a close cousin depending on the year and options. Both shared the same basic platform, and many performance parts were available across the range, but engines and suspension packages varied by model year and configuration, and some high-performance pieces were not universal.\n\nPontiac sold and produced far fewer Formulas because people wanted the Trans Am's image, but smart buyers got the same experience without paying for the billboard.\n\nBMW built Europe's first turbocharged production car in 1973, and the automotive press responded with confusion and concern about turbo lag. The 2002 Turbo made 170 horsepower and could hit 130 mph, making it one of the fastest sedans available.\n\nOnly 1,672 were built before the oil crisis killed it, and those that survive are worth a small fortune today.\n\nThe Stratos was too weird, too impractical, and too purpose-built for rallying to make sense as a road car. With a Ferrari Dino V6 mounted behind the seats and a wheelbase shorter than a modern Mini Cooper, it drove like a go-kart designed by someone on espresso.\n\nLancia built about 492 Stratos road cars for homologation purposes, and now they're six-figure collectibles that dominated top-level rally results in the mid-1970s.\n\nMopar fans obsessed over Cudas and Challengers while the humble Duster delivered similar performance for thousands less. The 340 cubic inch V8 made 275 horsepower in 1970 and could run mid-14-second quarter miles right off the showroom floor. It was essentially a cheap body on Plymouth's excellent\n\nAn A-body platform, but people dismissed it as a secretary's car with a bigger engine.\n\nRotary engines seemed like a gimmick to most Americans, and the RX-3's tinny build quality didn't help its case. Mazda RX-3 power and engine details varied by market and year. Some early RX-3 road tests cite about 110 bhp from the smaller 10A rotary, while later versions used larger rotary engines, and US emissions-era net ratings could be lower. Weight also varied by body style and equipment, but the car was generally light for its class.\n\nThe RX-3 was very successful in SCCA competition in the mid-1970s, even while some buyers and readers remained skeptical of rotary engines and fuel economy.\n\nWhen the Esprit debuted in late 1975 and entered production in 1976, critics complained it was underpowered with about 160 horsepower in European trim from its 2.0-liter four-cylinder, with lower ratings in some US versions. What they missed was that Lotus had built a mid-engine exotic that weighed about 2,116 pounds and handled like it was on rails.\n\nThe wedge styling looked like it came from a science fiction movie, and while early cars had quality issues, the Esprit established Lotus as a legitimate supercar manufacturer for the next three decades.\n\nThe 1970s forced the automotive industry to rethink everything it knew about performance, and these twelve cars represent different approaches to the same problem. Some went lighter, some went turbo, and some just ignored convention entirely. What they share is that contemporary audiences didn't quite know what to make of them, whether due to unfamiliar technology, unconventional packaging, or simply showing up at the wrong moment in history.\n\nToday, these misunderstood machines are finally getting the recognition they deserved all along, proving that sometimes the automotive press and buying public need a few decades of perspective to separate the genuinely interesting cars from the merely loud ones.",

    "description": "\"During World War II, the British dressed a dead body in a Royal Marines uniform and planted letters saying the Allies were going to invade Greece, and that Sicily was just a decoy. It was called Operation Mincemeat.\"",
    "fullText": "Context: The body used in Operation Mincemeat was that of Glyndwr Michael, a Welsh man who died after ingesting rat poison. He was dressed as \"Captain (Acting Major) William Martin\" of the Royal Marines and planted with fake letters, supposedly written by General Archibald Nye to General Harold Alexander. The letters claimed that Greece and Sardinia were the real invasion targets, with Sicily presented as a decoy.\n\nOn April 30, 1943, the submarine HMS Seraph released the body off the coast of Huelva, Spain, a country closely aligned with Germany. Intercepted German communications later confirmed that the deception worked. In response, Hitler transferred the 1st Panzer Division to Greece, doubled the Sardinian garrison to 10,000 troops, and moved seven infantry divisions away from Italy. The Allied invasion of Sicily, known as Operation Husky, began on July 9, 1943, and succeeded in part because German defenses had been deliberately thinned as a result of the ruse.\n\nContext: In April 1942, soldiers of the Polish 2nd Transport Company (later 22nd Artillery Supply Company) encountered an Iranian boy near Hamadan with an orphaned Syrian brown bear cub. They traded items — reportedly a Swiss Army knife, coins, and rations — for the cub. To circumvent British regulations forbidding mascots on military transport ships, Wojtek was officially enlisted as a private, receiving a serial number and paybook. He was later promoted to corporal. At the Battle of Monte Cassino (May 1944), eyewitnesses reported seeing Wojtek help move crates of artillery ammunition, though debate exists about whether these were live shells or empties. After the war, Wojtek lived at Edinburgh Zoo from 1947 until his death in December 1963.\n\nContext: According to the US Census Bureau's 2007 analysis, Washington ranked #138 among American surnames, with 89.9% of bearers being Non-Hispanic Black (146,520 of 163,036 total). A 2016 Census update showed the percentage remained above 87%. Genealogist Tony Burroughs is widely cited for the 82–94% figure for earlier censuses (1880–1930). However, historians caution that the reasons freedpeople chose this surname varied — some chose it to honor George Washington, while others took the surnames of their former enslavers (white families named Washington). As Burroughs noted: \"It's an assumption that the surname is tied to George... As far as I'm concerned, it's a coincidence.\"\n\nContext: Melbourne was never officially named \"Batmania\" by any government authority. However, the earliest documented use of \"Batmania\" appears in a satirical letter to the Launceston Cornwall Chronicle (June 13, 1835), explicitly mocking John Batman's contested land claims with Aboriginal peoples. The term also appeared on some private maps of the Port Phillip Association, but Police Magistrate George Stewart's 1836 official report called the settlement \"Bearbrass.\" Governor Richard Bourke voided Batman's private treaty (August 1835) and officially named the town \"Melbourne\" on April 10, 1837, after William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne, the British Prime Minister at the time.\n\nContext: During major events, Versailles could accommodate up to 10,000 people, with inadequate sanitation infrastructure for such crowds. Primary sources confirm the problem. Princess Elizabeth Charlotte (Liselotte), Duchess of Orléans, wrote in 1702: \"The people stationed in the galleries in front of our room piss in all the corners. It is impossible to leave one's apartments without seeing somebody pissing.\" However, historian Tony Spawforth notes that Versailles was not entirely devoid of facilities — it had public latrines, private cabinets d'aisance in noble apartments, and received its first flush toilet in 1738. The palace's sanitation problems were real but sometimes exaggerated in popular accounts.\n\nContext: When Israel's first president, Chaim Weizmann, died on November 9, 1952, Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion instructed Ambassador Abba Eban to offer the presidency to Einstein. The formal letter arrived on November 17, 1952. Einstein's written response read: \"I am deeply moved by the offer from our State of Israel, and at once saddened and ashamed that I cannot accept it. All my life I have dealt with objective matters, hence I lack both the natural aptitude and the experience to deal properly with people.\" Ben-Gurion reportedly told an aide: \"Tell me what to do if he says yes! I've had to offer the post because it's impossible not to. But if he accepts, we are in for trouble.\"\n\nContext: The Soviet anti-tank dog program operated from approximately 1930 to 1946. Dogs carried 10–12 kg explosive mines with a wooden lever trigger that would detonate when the dog crawled beneath a tank. Training involved placing food beneath stationary vehicles to condition the dogs. However, training occurred on Soviet diesel-engine tanks, while German tanks used gasoline engines with distinctly different sounds and exhaust smells. During the disastrous first combat deployment in summer 1941, dogs frequently ran toward familiar-smelling Soviet tanks or retreated to trenches — forcing handlers to shoot their own returning animals. The program claimed 300 German tank kills, though historians consider approximately 50 more realistic. Combat use largely ended by 1943, with training schools shifting focus to mine-detection work.\n\nContext: Eight German saboteurs landed by U-boat on US shores in June 1942 — four on Long Island, four in Florida. Two of them, George Dasch and Ernst Burger, had no intention of completing the mission: Dasch considered America his adopted country, and Burger had spent 17 months in a Nazi concentration camp. Shortly after landing, Dasch contacted the FBI, though they were skeptical until he dumped $84,000 in mission funds on an agent's desk. His information led to the capture of all eight within two weeks.\n\nA military tribunal convicted them all. Six were executed by electric chair at the District of Columbia jail on August 8, 1942: Richard Quirin, Heinrich Heinck, Edward Kerling, Werner Thiel, Herbert Haupt, and Hermann Neubauer. Dasch and Burger received prison sentences instead — 30 years and life, respectively — for their cooperation.\n\nThis was the largest federal execution by electric chair, but not the US record overall. Kentucky executed seven men on July 13, 1928, and New York executed seven at Sing Sing on August 12, 1912.\n\nSources: Naval History and Heritage Command, The Times\n\nContext: The scientific evidence for ancient polychromy (painted sculpture) is now overwhelming. Using ultraviolet light, X-ray fluorescence, and Raman spectroscopy, researchers have identified traces of Egyptian blue, cinnabar red, ochre yellow, and malachite green on ancient sculptures. Vinzenz Brinkmann at the Liebieghaus Skulpturensammlung in Frankfurt has been studying this since the 1980s, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art's \"Chroma: Ancient Sculpture in Color\" exhibition (2022–2023) displayed vivid scientific reconstructions. As the Met's chief scientist Marco Leona put it: \"A completely white statue, to a Greek observer, would have looked like some shoddy effort.\"\n\nContext: The Confederate submarine H.L. Hunley sank the USS Housatonic on February 17, 1864, about four miles offshore from Charleston Harbor — the first successful submarine attack in naval history. The hand-cranked, 40-foot vessel used a spar torpedo: a copper cylinder packed with gunpowder mounted on a 22-foot pole. The Housatonic sank in about five minutes, killing five Union sailors. But the Hunley never signaled its return, and all eight crew members perished with it.\n\nWhen the wreck was raised in 2000, it was remarkably intact — no major hull damage, hatches still closed, bilge pumps unused. The crew's skeletons were found still seated at their stations, with no broken bones or signs they'd tried to escape. The mystery lingered for years until Duke researcher Rachel Lance (2017) concluded that the shockwave from their own torpedo — detonated just 16 feet from the bow — transmitted through the hull and caused fatal lung trauma, killing them instantly.\n\nContext: Three major earthquakes struck the New Madrid Seismic Zone between 1811 and 1812: December 16, 1811 (M7.5), January 23, 1812 (M7.3), and February 7, 1812 (M7.5). These destroyed the town of New Madrid, Missouri, toppled chimneys as far as Cincinnati, St. Louis, and Kentucky, and were felt over approximately 1 million square miles. Eyewitness Eliza Bryan wrote of \"the screams of the affrighted inhabitants... the roaring of the Mississippi.\" The February 1812 quake even created Reelfoot Lake in Tennessee when the ground sank by as much as 6 meters.\n\nAs for the 1990 panic, self-proclaimed climatologist Iben Browning predicted a 50% probability of a major earthquake for December 2–3, 1990. Schools across four states closed, businesses shuttered, and the St. Louis Red Cross distributed 230,000 earthquake preparedness kits. Nothing happened. Northwestern geologist Seth Stein called it \"the greatest non-event since 'The War of the Worlds.'\"\n\nContext: The Haitian Revolution was crucial to Napoleon's decision to sell Louisiana. Napoleon sent over 20,000 troops under General Charles Leclerc to reconquer Saint-Domingue, with reinforcements eventually bringing the total to more than 30,000. The vast majority perished — primarily from yellow fever — with fewer than 8,000 surviving. Saint-Domingue had been France's most valuable colony, generating approximately 300 million livres annually. Louisiana was intended as a supply base for Caribbean sugar operations. So without Saint-Domingue, it became strategically worthless. War with Britain was also imminent (it resumed in May 1803), meaning France couldn't defend Louisiana anyway. The $15 million sale (roughly $380 million today) was a strategic reallocation of an indefensible asset, not simple bankruptcy.\n\nContext: The 369th Infantry Regiment was composed of African American soldiers, segregated from the US Army and assigned to the French 16th Division (4th French Army). They spent 191 days under fire — the longest of any American unit — and their record states they \"never lost a foot of ground.\"\n\nThe soldier referenced is Private Henry Johnson. On May 15, 1918, Johnson and fellow soldier Needham Roberts were manning an observation post when a German raiding party of at least 12 attacked. Despite sustaining 21 wounds, Johnson fought them off, primarily with his bolo knife, killing four and wounding others. He was awarded the French Croix de Guerre, but wouldn't receive the US Medal of Honor until 2015, posthumously.\n\nThe regiment suffered approximately 1,500 casualties during the war. After the armistice on November 11, 1918, they became the first Allied unit to reach the Rhine River, arriving on November 20 as occupation forces.\n\nContext: Truman learned about the Manhattan Project shortly after becoming president upon Roosevelt's sudden death in April 1945. He was briefed by Secretary of War Henry Stimson and received detailed information about the bomb's development and potential.\n\nThe more nuanced historical argument, advanced by nuclear historian Alex Wellerstein, is that Truman may have misunderstood Hiroshima's nature — believing it was primarily a military installation rather than a city with a military base. In his July 25, 1945, diary entry, Truman wrote he had ordered the bomb used \"so that military objectives and soldiers and sailors are the target and not women and children.\" On August 9, he stated publicly that \"the first atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, a military base.\"\n\nWellerstein subsequently argues that Truman likely learned the full extent of civilian casualties only on August 8, the day before Nagasaki. On August 10, 1945, Truman ordered that no further atomic bombs be dropped without his express authorization, asserting presidential control over nuclear weapons for the first time. The Atomic Energy Act of 1946 (McMahon Act), signed August 1, 1946, transferred nuclear weapons from military to civilian control and established the Atomic Energy Commission, institutionalizing civilian/presidential authority over nuclear weapons.\n\nContext: Much of what we know comes from two key sources. On the Mediterranean side, The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea (mid-first century CE) was written by a Greek-speaking Egyptian merchant living under Roman rule. While the author himself traveled only as far as India, the text refers to lands farther east, including a place called \"Thinae,\" generally understood to mean China, based on reports circulating through Indian Ocean trade networks.\n\nOn the Chinese side, the Hou Hanshu (Book of the Later Han) records that in 166 CE, envoys claiming to represent \"Andun, king of Daqin\" — likely the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius Antoninus — arrived at the court of Emperor Huan. They came by sea via Rinan (in modern-day Vietnam), bearing luxury goods such as ivory, rhinoceros horn, and tortoise shell. Most historians believe these were not official diplomats but Greco-Roman merchants operating out of Roman Egypt or Syria, traveling through Southeast Asian maritime routes.\n\nAlso in Nifty: These 14 DIY Fails Are Just So, Sooooo Bad (And I'm Laughing So, Sooooo Hard)\n\nAlso in Nifty: People Are Sharing Things You See In Someone Else's Home That Immediately Signal They're Middle Class",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nIllinois Fighting Illini men's basketball coach Brad Underwood saw his team overcome road adversity once again, as it snagged a critical road win Sunday afternoon to extend its winning streak to 11 by overcoming a talented No.5-ranked Nebraska Cornhuskers team, 78-69.\n\nIt wasn't just any win. It's a microcosm of a season marked by raw, elite talent finally gelling together as the season's critical stretch run really gets going.

There weren't X's and O's, nor was there a diagram explaining the ways Illinois can continue to remain atop a crowded Big Ten title race with a little over a month left in the season.\n\nInstead, it was four simple words: \"Rob the [expletive] bank.\"\n\nWhether it was a jab at the arena's name or otherwise, it certainly seemed to fire up Illinois as it now holds a win against every conference opponent it's played so far.\n\nUnderwood said his players were relaxed and composed in the second half after overcoming a 39-33 halftime deficit. The Illini outscored the Cornhuskers 45-30 in the final 20 minutes, as freshman guard Keaton Wagler finished with 28 points.\n\n“Chemistry and connectivity,\" Underwood told reporters. \"Just the communication… We’ve made huge strides there and we’re competing on every play,” Underwood said.\n\nMORE: Dusty May set the tone before tipoff and Michigan followed\n\nThe Illini are going to attempt to keep their winning streak alive Wednesday night from State Farm Center in Champaign, hosting the Northwestern Wildcats.

    "description": "Top 10: The Second World War Fighters Souped-Up for Extreme Air Racing",
    "fullText": "Reno Air Racing, described as ‘the world’s fastest motorsport’, is a blistering blend of aviation heritage, extreme engineering and thrilling speed.\n\nHeld in the Nevada desert, it pits legendary warbirds against one another in low-level, high-G duels around a pylon course. These aircraft, once icons of combat, are now stripped, clipped and polished to extremes.\n\nEngines are souped-up, wings shortened, cooling systems re-engineered — all in the relentless pursuit of speed. Prop tips blur, exhausts roar, and pilots skim the desert floor, often at over 450 mph. It’s not just racing; it’s the ultimate fusion of history, danger, and adrenaline.\n\nThe Curtiss P-40E Warhawk, famed for its shark-mouthed nose art and rugged wartime service, found a second life roaring over Reno’s desert skies. Once a symbol of wartime grit, it became a rare but thrilling sight among the sleek Mustangs and Bearcats dominating the Unlimited Class air races.\n\nUnlike the supercharged, high-altitude racers built later in the war, the P-40E was a tough, low-to-mid-altitude fighter, never the fastest — but its broad wings, throaty Allison engine, and unmistakable silhouette made it unforgettable. Racers who chose the Warhawk prized its stability and character, favouring heritage over outright performance.\n\nTo compete, mechanics stripped out armour, guns, and unnecessary weight, tuned the Allison V-1710 for maximum output, and polished every inch of its metal to minimise drag. Some even fitted larger props and fuel tweaks, wringing every last knot from its classic frame. The transformation kept the Warhawk’s soul but pushed its limits.\n\nP‑40s have occasionally raced at Reno, often in the Bronze or Unlimited classes. Airframes like Texas Warhawk (2017) reached qualifying speeds near 292 mph, with race speeds around 270 mph.\n\nThe F8F Bearcat was the ultimate example of Grumman’s pantheon of piston-engined naval fighters. The company’s earlier Hellcat had been instrumental in defeating Japan, and the Bearcat was even more potent. Compact, with immaculate handling, the F8F was utterly brilliant.\n\nLong before the Bearcat had entered the realm of racing, it snatched the absolute climb rate record for piston-engined aircraft, whizzing up to 10,000 feet in 94 seconds in 1946. Fast and with a strong structure that lent itself to modification, the Bearcat was a ripe candidate for the Reno races.\n\nRare Bear is a heavily modified Grumman F8F Bearcat, rebuilt by pilot Lyle Shelton from a crashed airframe in 1969 for air racing. Fitted with a powerful Wright R-3350 radial engine producing over 4000 horsepower, it became one of the fastest piston-engine aircraft ever built.\n\nIn 1989, Rare Bear set a 3 km (1.86 mile) world speed record of 528.33 mph (850.26 km/h). With shortened wings, aerodynamic refinements, and distinctive “bear” artwork, it dominated the Unlimited Class at the Reno Air Races.\n\nThere is much debate over what the ultimate piston-engined fighter was; some offer the P-51H, P-47N, or other types for this prestigious, subjective ranking, but the two most common candidates are the American Grumman Bearcat and the British Hawker Sea Fury. This sense of rivalry between these two brilliant radial-engined naval fighters carries on over eighty years after their first flights. Though the Sea Fury did not serve in the war, we will include it as it took its first flight in 1945.\n\nThe Hawker Sea Fury T.Mk 20 Dreadnought began life as a two-seat Royal Navy trainer, designed to familiarise pilots with the high-powered radial engine and handling characteristics of the single-seat fighter variants. When converted for air racing, Dreadnought underwent extensive modifications.\n\nThe rear seat was removed, structural reinforcements were added, and a Pratt & Whitney R‑4360 radial engine, producing around 3,800 hp, replaced the standard powerplant. These changes enabled the aircraft to safely handle extreme speeds and high g-forces on the pylon course while maintaining control over its large airframe.\n\nDreadnought reached qualifying speeds of 452.7 mph (according to unofficial sources) in 1986 and, piloted by Joel Swager in 2018, achieved a Gold Unlimited victory at Reno with a race speed of 417.735 mph. Over its career, it accumulated multiple wins and several second-place finishes, demonstrating remarkable consistency and reliability despite its size. The September Fury is another Hawker Sea Fury turned Reno Unlimited racer.\n\nThe Vought F4U Corsair, (and the Goodyear F2G Super Corsair) is a legendary Second World War naval fighter, famed for its distinctive inverted gull wings and powerful Pratt & Whitney radial engine. It served with the United States Navy and Marines in the Pacific, excelling in both air‑to‑air combat and ground‑attack roles, reaching speeds of around 446 mph in standard military form (we’ve used a wartime Corsair image here).\n\nIts combination of agility, firepower, and durability made it a favourite among pilots and a feared adversary in the skies, cementing its place in aviation history. The Corsair at Reno is a rare and captivating sight, one of the few warbirds of its kind to race in the Unlimited Class. Its presence is significant because very few Corsairs were ever modified or maintained for competitive racing, making it a true gem for air-race enthusiasts.\n\nAt the Reno Air Races, modified Corsairs proved remarkable in the Unlimited Class. The F4U‑derived Super Corsair N31518, piloted by Steve Hinton, won the Unlimited Gold in 1985, averaging 438.186 mph over the eight‑lap course. Goodyear F2G N5588N, known as Race 57, was restored and entered competition in 1999, achieving impressive results.\n\nTheir participation was rare, as few Corsairs were ever adapted for racing, and each airframe brought both historical significance and thrilling performance to the event. The aircraft’s gull wings give it instant charisma. Despite a relative scarcity of usable photographs, the Corsair’s speed rand rarity prestige make it an essential inclusion on our list.\n\n‘Steadfast’ began life as one of a batch of 10 modern Yak-3Us built in the early 2000s in Romania by Avioane Craiova. The original Yak-3U was an experimental Yak-3 development fitted with a radial ASh-82 engine in place of the usual V-12 Klimov which did not enter production but several replicas have been built.\n\nMost replicas destined for owners in the west received R-1830 engines but when Will Whiteside acquired this Yak as an unfinished, engineless, potential racer project, he decided to install a rather more potent Pratt & Whitney R-2000, as fitted to the DC-4, but tuned to deliver 1750hp.\n\nCompared to most Reno racers, 1750hp doesn’t sound that much but the Yak airframe is light, small and streamlined. Steadfast (a name derived from Reno’s Stead airport and the intention to go fast) raced at Reno for six years and attained first place in the Unlimited Silver in 2012.\n\nThe aircraft benefited from significant aerodynamic work to remove drag, it utilises an oversized spinner (from an A-26) and an afterspinner to smooth airflow through the cowling Steadfast ultimately set nine speed and climb records, including the speed record for its class at 416mph. Since 2017 Steadfast has been based in New Zealand.\n\nThe P‑51 Mustang became a common choice for air racers in America due to the large number of surplus airframes available after World War II. Its robust design, high-speed potential, and adaptability made it ideal for conversion into Unlimited Class racers, and “Strega” emerged as one of the most successful and recognisable examples.\n\nStrega, a highly modified P‑51D, dominated the Reno Air Races for decades. Powered by a tuned Packard Merlin engine producing over 3000 hp, it could reach qualifying speeds exceeding 500 mph.\n\nIts aerodynamic refinements, including clipped wings, polished surfaces, and custom cooling systems, allowed it to maintain exceptional control through tight pylon turns at extreme velocities, a key factor in its repeated victories.\n\nOver its racing career, Strega won the Unlimited Gold Class multiple times, often competing head-to-head with other top Mustangs like Dago Red and Precious Metal. Its consistent podium finishes and record-setting laps made it a benchmark in air racing, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining World War 2-era airframes with modern engineering and tuning.\n\nBeyond speed, Strega’s legacy lies in its influence on piston-engine racing. Its dominance highlighted the advantages of the P‑51 platform, inspiring other racers to optimise weight, aerodynamics, and power to compete at the highest levels of the Reno Air Races.\n\nDago Red is a North American P‑51 Mustang (44‑74996) restored as a competitive air racer by Frank Taylor in 1981. Taylor piloted Dago Red to numerous world records and championship victories during the 1980s. In 1983 at Mojave, California, the aircraft set a 15 km world speed record of 517.323 mph, highlighting its extreme performance and engineering.\n\nOver its racing career, Dago Red achieved repeated success at the Reno Air Races, including winning the Gold Unlimited class in 1982. It secured the Thompson Trophy in 2003 with a fastest lap of 512.164 mph and fastest race speed of 507.105 mph.\n\nIn 2001, it recorded the fastest qualifying speed at Reno at 497.797 mph. Across two decades, Dago Red won the National Championship Air Races six times (1982, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2002, and 2003), cementing its reputation as one of the premier piston-engine racers in the world.\n\nThe aircraft is powered by a race-tuned Rolls-Royce Merlin V12, estimated at 3500–3800 hp, driving a four-bladed Hamilton Standard paddle propeller. Its lightweight 7200 lb empty weight and 32 ft wingspan allow it to handle tightly around pylons at extreme speeds. With a maximum speed exceeding 520 mph and a rate of climb of 8,000 ft/min, Dago Red remains a benchmark in air racing, demonstrating the pinnacle of Mustang performance and Taylor’s piloting skill.\n\nThe P‑51XR, known as Precious Metal, was built in 1988 for high-speed air racing and should not be confused with the original P‑51D or the replica Precious Metal II. It is one of the most radical and exciting modified Mustangs ever created, combining a classic airframe with extreme engineering.\n\nIt retained the P‑51 fuselage but incorporated a Rolls‑Royce Griffon 57A engine producing dramatically more horsepower than the original Merlin. To handle the immense torque, it used contra-rotating propellers from an Avro Shackleton (the same Griffon/contra arrangement was tested on the cancelled MB5 fighter), significantly improving stability and allowing pilots to exploit full power without losing control during tight pylon turns at Reno.\n\nThis mighty propulsion system combined with structural reinforcements to cope with the Griffon’s power, made Precious Metal one of the most capable and aggressive piston-engine racers ever built, pushing a WWII-era fighter far beyond its original limits.\n\nIts debut at the 1988 Reno Air Races immediately marked it as a contender, though early mechanical issues limited performance. Over time, it earned multiple podium finishes in the Unlimited Class, including a sixth-place finish in the Gold race. As an intriguing aside, the wartime Martin-Baker MB5 also adopted a Griffon/contra arrangement, a spectacular fighter prototype that did not enter production.\n\nThe Red Baron, a heavily modified P‑51D Mustang (NX7715C / 44‑84961), became one of the most iconic competitors in the Reno Air Races. Originally entered under various names, including Race #5 “Miss RJ” and “Roto‑Finish,” it was later reborn as Red Baron, with extensive modifications to maximise speed and performance.\n\nFrom its earliest appearances in 1966, the aircraft demonstrated competitive potential, qualifying 10th at 283.770 mph and finishing 5th in the consolation race at 304.990 mph. By 1968, Red Baron had established itself as a serious contender, qualifying 1st at 379.650 mph and finishing 2nd in the championship race at 386.852 mph. Subsequent years saw further improvements, and by 1971 it qualified 1st at 419.501 mph, finishing 4th in the championship at 412.101 mph.\n\nThe aircraft’s performance improvements came from detailed engineering modifications: the airframe was lightened by removing non-essential equipment, the Rolls-Royce Merlin engine was race-tuned to over 3,500 hp, and aerodynamic refinements—including a custom four-blade Hamilton Standard propeller, polished surfaces, and modified control surfaces—reduced drag while increasing stability through tight pylon turns.\n\nThough we have focused on the hardware, the pilot skills demonstrated by the Reno pilots is masterly. Competitors needed precise throttle management and exacting handling to safely maintain speeds exceeding 400 mph near the ground. Red Baron’s consistent podium finishes and record-setting laps cemented its place as one of the most formidable Unlimited Class racers in Reno history.\n\nThe North American P‑51D Mustang Voodoo, piloted by Steve Hinton Jr., is widely recognised as the fastest piston‑engine propeller aircraft in the world. Its record-breaking performance at the Reno Air Races showcased the incredible potential of carefully modified warbirds. Every detail, from aerodynamics to engine tuning, was optimised for sheer speed.\n\nOn 2 September 2017, Voodoo achieved an astonishing average speed of 531.64 mph (855.59 km/h) over the three‑kilometre course. This feat required not only a meticulously prepared aircraft but a pilot of extraordinary skill and courage.\n\nThe Mustang’s balance of power, control, and agility made it perfect for the tight, high-speed turns of Reno’s Unlimited Class racing. Voodoo's crowning moment came in 1972, when it won the championship race at 416.160 mph.\n\nLater modifications, including a Rolls‑Royce Griffon engine and contra‑rotating propellers, pushed the aircraft to new extremes, achieving 1st-place qualifying at 427 mph and winning the championship at 415 mph in 1978.\n\nFollow Joe Coles on Substack, Twitter X  or Blue Sky.

the third football association in the world was formed following a meeting at the town's Wynnstay Arms Hotel.\n\nLlewelyn Kendrick, a solicitor, was appointed chairman with Hawley Edwards taking the role of treasurer.\n\nA century and a half later the FAW is unrecognisable from the association established in the three story Georgian red-brick hotel that still stands in the centre of Wrexham today.\n\nBBC Sport Wales looks back at the most significant moments in the association's history.\n\n'Welsh wizard' Wilson targets Europe and World Cup\n\nA warrior touched by tragedy - Terry Yorath obituary\n\nFAW chief executive Mooney extends contract to 2030\n\nFounded three years after the Scottish Football Association (SFA) and 13 after the FA in England, the FAW is the third oldest football association in the world.\n\nSome seven weeks later - on 25 March, 1876 - the Wales men's team played their first international match, losing 4-0 away to Scotland at Partick.\n\nA year later, Scotland travelled to Wrexham and beat Wales 2-0 in their first home international at the Racecourse Ground - now named Stok Cae Ras - which remains the oldest international football stadium still in use.\n\nWales had to wait four years until 1881 for their first victory when John Vaughan scored the only goal to clinch a 1-0 win over England in Blackburn.\n\nThe 1950s marked a golden era for the Wales men's team, featuring iconic players such as John and Mel Charles, Ivor Allchurch, Cliff Jones, Trevor Ford and Terry Medwin.\n\nWorld Cup qualification was achieved for the first time in 1958 following a defeat of Israel in a play-off.\n\nThe tournament was held in Sweden and Wales faced the hosts, Mexico and Hungary in the group stages.\n\nAll three Wales group games ended level, but Jimmy Murphy's side booked a place in the quarter-finals with a play-off win against Hungary.\n\nGoals from Allchurch and Medwin set up a tie against Brazil, but Wales would be without their talisman John Charles who was injured in the game after some ferocious treatment from the Hungarians.\n\nA 17-year-old Pele scored the only goal as Brazil won the quarter-final 1-0 but almost 70 years on Welsh football fans still wonder what might have been had Charles lined up to face Brazil.\n\nIt took more than a century for the FAW to formally recognise a women's national team.\n\nInitially established in 1973, the team received no support from the FAW as players were forced to arrange their own training sessions and matches as well as funding it themselves.\n\nA crowd of around 3,500 witnessed their first fixture against the Republic of Ireland in Llanelli, and saw Wales play in kits borrowed from Swansea City's men's team.\n\nWearing shirts several sizes too big for them, Gaynor Blackwell and Gloria O'Connell scored the side's first goals in a 3-2 defeat.\n\nTwo decades passed before the FAW would take official control of the women's side.\n\nIn 1993 players Laura McAllister, Michele Adams and Karen Jones successfully persuaded association secretary Alun Evans to finally take responsibility for the Wales women's team.\n\nConcerns over Wales' status as an independent football nation grew in the 1980s which many felt threatened the very existence of the FAW.\n\nLeading Welsh clubs competed in the English pyramid system, and the absence of a national domestic league was a source of indignation to many FIFA members.\n\nIn response, the League of Wales was formed in 1992.\n\nSome clubs, including Newport County, Merthyr Town and Colwyn Bay rejected an invitation to join and were forced to play their non-league league matches in the English system outside Wales.\n\nTwenty teams took part in the inaugural season of the new League of Wales and Cwmbran were crowned the first champions.\n\nSince 1992 the league has undergone several changes and is now known as the Cymru Premier, featuring 12 teams.\n\nThe New Saints are the competition's most successful club and have won the title on 17 occasions.\n\nThe summer of 2016 is immortalised in Welsh football folklore.\n\nWales had not qualified for a major international tournament since the World Cup of 1958 in Sweden.\n\nEuro 2016 in France gave a squad dubbed the 'golden generation' an opportunity to shine on the international stage.\n\nStars such as Gareth Bale, Aaron Ramsey, Joe Allen and captain Ashley Williams led a squad of players to the summer of their lives.\n\nWales topped a group containing Slovakia, England and Russia, before beating Northern Ireland in Paris in the last 16.\n\nIn the quarter-finals they faced one of the tournament favourites, Belgium, in Lille.\n\nHal Robson-Kanu scored one of the most iconic goals in Wales' history in a 3-1 win that ranks as one of the best results in the 150 year history of Welsh international football.\n\nWithout the suspended Ramsey and Ben Davies, Wales were beaten by eventual Euro 2016 winners Portugal.\n\nCristiano Ronaldo scored twice in the semi-final in Lyon, but Euro 2016 remains a defining chapter for the national side.\n\nQualification for Euro 2025 marked a landmark moment for women's football in Wales.\n\nHead coach Rhian Wilkinson and her players secured their place in Welsh footballing history by reaching a major international tournament finals for the first time.\n\nThe tournament was held in Switzerland and Wales faced world class opponents in the group stage.\n\nHeavy defeats to the Netherlands, France and England on the pitch were countered by some unforgettable moments including the singing of the national anthem before the opening match against the Netherlands, Jess Fishlock's goal against France and the passionate support of the Red Wall.\n\nThe hope now is that Euro 2025 will inspire more girls and women to take up the sport in Wales.\n\nEarly signs are encouraging, with more than 20,000 girls and women now registered to play football.\n\nThe next target is qualification for the 2027 Women's World Cup, as Wales look to add another memorable chapter to the story of the national team.\n\n'World Cup could earn millions for Welsh grassroots'\n\n'We have so much to thank Terry for' - Bellamy\n\nWales to tour country in World Cup qualifying",

    "fullText": "HONG KONG (AP) — China has been flooding Latin American markets with low-priced exports, especially autos and e-commerce goods, as its exporters adjust to U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs and geopolitical moves.\n\nThe world’s second-largest economy has become a major trading partner for many Latin American nations, seeking access to their abundant natural resources and growing markets while expanding its influence in a region Trump views as America’s Backyard.\n\nChinese businesses face slow demand at home. They need new markets for their products as the country ramps up production in many industries. Exports to Latin America, a market of more than 600 million people, and other regions have climbed while exports to the U.S. fell by 20% last year.\n\n“Latin America has a solid middle class, relatively high purchasing power and real demand,” said Margaret Myers, director of the Asia and Latin America program at the Inter-American Dialogue think tank in Washington. “Those conditions make it one of the easiest places for China to offload its excess industrial production.”\n\nThe influx of made-in-China cars, clothing, electronics and home furnishings has rankled countries trying to build their own globally competitive industries. Some, such as Mexico, Chile and Brazil, have raised tariffs or taken other measures to protect their local industries.\n\nCheap e-commerce goods gain market share\n\nCheap goods from China are welcome news for many Latin American consumers, but they’re a headache for local businesses.\n\nChinese e-commerce platforms, led by Temu and Shein, have accelerated that trend.\n\n“I use Temu all the time, whether to buy clothes or household items. The same things I would find in brand-name stores or shopping malls, I find on Temu at a much lower price,” said Chilean restaurant manager Lady Mogollon.\n\nTemu averaged 114 million monthly active users in Latin America in the first half of 2025, a 165% increase year-on-year from 2024, market intelligence company Sensor Tower estimates. Shein’s monthly active users in the region grew 18%.\n\nT-shirts, jackets, pants, toys, watches and furniture and more products made in China fill the stalls of street vendors in downtown Mexico City.\n\nÁngel Ramírez, manager of a downtown lamp shop, is struggling to compete.\n\n“The Chinese have invaded us in terms of merchandise,” said Ramírez, sitting behind the counter of his completely deserted store.\n\nOver the past few years the number of shops selling Chinese-made goods in Mexico City ’s downtown has more than tripled, Ramírez said, in some cases putting long-established Mexican stores out of business.",

    "fullText": "Second T20 international, Pallekele\n\nSri Lanka 189-5 (20.0 overs): Rathnayake 40 (22); Archer 2-42, Jacks 1-24\n\nEngland 173-4 (16.4 overs): Banton 54* (33), Buttler 39 (29); Pathirana 2-47\n\nEngland won by six wickets runs; lead three-match series 2-0\n\nTom Banton whacked an unbeaten half-century as England pulled off a brilliant DLS chase to beat Sri Lanka by six wickets in the second T20 international.\n\nThe players had gone off for rain with England 57-2 off 7.2 overs - Phil Salt and Jacob Bethell the batters out - and when they returned the tourists were set a revised DLS target of 168 off 17 overs.\n\nJos Buttler laid the platform with a 29-ball 39 but Harry Brook truly gave England belief during a brutal and breathtaking cameo in Pallekele.\n\nBrook spanked four sixes during a knock of 36 off 12 balls as he seized the initiative only to be caught scooping the slingy Matheesha Pathirana.\n\nWith 38 runs off 33 balls required, Banton played with calculated aggression en route to 54 not out off 33 balls to put England on the brink of victory.\n\nThe match went down to the final over but Sam Curran duly cracked Janith Liyanage for six to wrap up the win with two balls to spare.\n\nSri Lanka had earlier posted a competitive 189-5 after being inserted by England as Pavan Rathnayake top scored with 40 off 22 balls.\n\nPathum Nissanka had set the tone after he and fellow opener Kamil Mishara hammered 35 off the first two overs of the match.\n\nHowever, England's spinners stymied the hosts' attacking intent with controlled spells through the middle overs as Adil Rashid, Liam Dawson and Will Jacks all picked up a wicket apiece.\n\nJofra Archer claimed 2-42 but fellow seamers Jamie Overton and Curran were both expensive and wicketless.\n\nEngland's victory ensured they clinched the series 2-0 with one match left to play before their opening game of the T20 World Cup against Nepal on 8 February.\n\nBanton burst on to the international scene for England in 2019 with some eye-catching performances as a 21-year-old.\n\nA blur of flamboyant strokeplay and powerful ball striking, he was perhaps found wanting when it came to consistency, especially in his previous guise opening.\n\nThere were question marks as to whether he could hack it when under pressure while injuries also checked his progress.\n\nAt the age of 27, and in England's middle order, the Somerset man looks a much more rounded player at home on the global stage.\n\nThis was an innings of tempered aggression and one which was the glue that bound England's chase together.\n\nBanton swept and reverse swept quite beautifully against Sri Lanka's spinners, striking four fours and three sixes.\n\nHe also knew when to play second fiddle - while Brook was going berserk, for example - which showed useful situational awareness.\n\n\"You've got to give yourself a chance to get out there and assess the wicket,\" Banton said at the post-match presentation.\n\n\"Where there's a bit of hold and turn, it's essential to be able to sweep the ball. The Sri Lankan spinners keep it nice and straight so you've got to hit it.\"\n\nHis chance here came courtesy of Ben Duckett nursing a finger injury and England will now have a decision to make for the World Cup.\n\nAnother decent outing in the final T20 on Tuesday and it could be Banton's place in the middle to lose.\n\n\"I think most of my career I've been opening. I've got a new role with England which is exciting,\" Banton added.\n\n\"I just want to try and play all formats and hopefully take my chance when I get it.\"\n\nEncouragingly for England on the eve of a subcontinental T20 World Cup, their spin department is holding up well.\n\nA combined 12 overs yielded three wickets for 81 runs at an economy rate of 6.75, a return that underlined their growing control and reliability.\n\nRashid remains the ace in the pack, capable of stifling momentum and producing breakthroughs at key moments.\n\nThe experienced leg-spinner's googly may have been well studied by opposition batters, but it remains a potent weapon, as Sri Lanka captain Dasun Shanaka discovered when he was trapped lbw slogging to leg.\n\nDawson's left-arm spin provided much-needed control through the middle overs, slowing down his speeds to left vs right handers, while Jacks continues to mature as a bowling option, and used his angles well.\n\nBrook has plenty of options to turn to even when the pitch does not spin big.\n\nA slight concern for England, with just under a week to go before a major tournament, was that their seam bowling did not quite hit the mark.\n\nThat caveat comes with the acknowledgement that the surface at the Pallekele International Cricket Stadium was a used one, offering little margin for error.\n\nNevertheless Jamie Overton struggled with his length, while Curran, fresh from an expensive hat-trick in the opening T20, surprisingly lacked conviction after conceding 14 from his first over.\n\nArcher fared slightly better, picking up two wickets despite being targeted early on, with Nissanka launching him out of the ground in his opening over.\n\nArcher, however, recovered well to bowl effectively at the death as Sri Lanka pushed for a total in excess of 200.\n\nEngland captain Harry Brook: \"I thought we played outstanding there, especially with the bat. To win the series is awesome.\n\n\"I think the more time we get out in the middle puts us into good shape for the World Cup. The way Banton played there was great. There's plenty of batters in there. We just go out there and chase.\n\n\"The spinners have been awesome, that's why we decided to pick two frontline spinners, to help restrict those runs in the middle.\"\n\nSri Lanka skipper Dasun Shanaka: \"We did a lot of things right. It's not the rain, but the fact that Eshan Malinga got injured played a part. Normally he's a very good death bowler but we lost him so there's a reason [for the loss].\n\n\"Every batter got starts so happy about the way they played and accelerated. There were a few overs where we couldn't capitalise but Adil Rashid bowled well.\n\n\"We know that because we've played on spin tracks the past two years. It's the home advantage so no doubt about it we need to use that.\"\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "description": "“All [camels] know in the desert [is] if it's not sand, it's food.\"",
    "fullText": "Plastic pollution is an enormous global problem, and a lot of focus has been rightly placed on the devastating effects that plastic is having on our oceans and marine life. But plastic pollution on land is a big problem, too, as experts have recently been reminded when they started discovering giant blobs of the stuff inside the stomachs of dead camels.\n\nCalifornia-based environmental scientist Marcus Eriksen and United Arab Emirates (UAE)-based veterinary microbiologist Ulrich Wernery co-authored an article titled \"The plight of camels eating plastic waste.\"\n\nEriksen described one autopsy as \"the most surreal thing in the world,\" and their findings showed that plastic clumps called polybezoars, which Eriksen said \"range from the size of a basketball to roughly a large suitcase,\" are responsible for 1% of the camel deaths in the UAE\n\n\"All [camels] know in the desert [is] if it's not sand, it's food,\" Eriksen said. \"If they see a plastic bag stuck in a tree … or stuck against a fence, they might think, 'Oh, that's a novel piece of food,' and they'll consume it.\"\n\nThe effects of eating plastic are devastating for the camels, causing intestinal blockages, creating lacerations inside their stomachs, and creating a toxic environment for bacteria to grow amid the folds of the plastic.\n\n\"It's a slow death,\" Eriksen said. \"Imagine if you had five plastic bags crushed up in your body, and maybe a dozen bottle caps and a few straws, and it stayed there for years. I mean, you would suffer until you'd ultimately perish from that ingested trash. And that's what the camels are experiencing.\"\n\nCamels are not the only land animals facing this challenge, either. A sick bear in Colorado was recently euthanized and found to have plastic waste blocking its digestive system. Plastic waste consumption also killed two elephants in Sri Lanka.\n\nAs plastic waste causes more and more animal deaths, there is some hope that public pressure will cause governments to regulate it more heavily. Canada banned single-use plastics in 2021, and other places, such as Massachusetts, have taken similar steps.\n\nAs far as steps we can take to reduce our plastic consumption in our regular lives, we can make sure we understand how to recycle as effectively as possible and shun single-use plastics by using things like reusable water bottles.\n\nJoin our free newsletter for weekly updates on the coolest innovations improving our lives and saving our planet.",

    "fullText": "TAIPEI, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang praised and lightly cajoled his major Taiwanese suppliers to produce more to help power strong demand for AI, capping a visit ​to the island of his birth, where he has been mobbed by adoring fans at ‌every step.\n\nSpeaking at an impromptu press conference in the rain outside a Taipei restaurant late on Saturday, where he had hosted suppliers ‌for a \"trillion-dollar dinner\", named after the market capitalisation of those firms attending, Huang said this would be another good year for business.\n\n\"TSMC needs to work very hard this year because I need a lot of wafers,\" he said, laughing, referring to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, the world's largest producer of advanced chips used in artificial-intelligence applications.\n\n\"TSMC is ⁠doing an incredible job and they're working ‌very, very hard. We have a lot of demand this year,\" he added after taking pictures with a beaming TSMC CEO C.C. Wei.\n\n\"Over the next 10 years, TSMC ‍will likely increase their capacity by much more than 100%, and so this is a very substantial scale-up in the next decade.\"\n\nWei did not answer questions from reporters.\n\nLast month, TSMC said capital spending could jump as much as 37% this ​year to $56 billion, and would increase \"significantly\" in 2028 and 2029 given AI demand.\n\nHuang, who emigrated to the ‌United States as a child, is met by a throng of adoring fans wherever he returns to Taiwan. Local media, who refer to him as \"the people's dad\", breathlessly report on his every move.\n\nHuang co-founded California-based Nvidia in 1993. Last year, it became the first company to breach $5 trillion in market value, continuing a meteoric rise that has firmly positioned it at the heart of the global AI revolution.\n\nIn Taipei, he expressed concern about ⁠supplies of memory chips, which support AI workloads, amid a ​production crunch.\n\n\"We need a lot of memory this year,\" he said. \"I ​think that the entire supply chain is challenging this year because demand is so much more.\"\n\nHuang periodically stepped out of the dinner, attended by two dozen executives, including Young ‍Liu, chairman of contract-electronics maker ⁠Foxconn, Nvidia's biggest server maker, to greet his fans and sign autographs.\n\n\"We have so many partners here in Taiwan. Nvidia won't be possible without Taiwan. There's magic in this island. The companies here ⁠have extraordinary technology, they've incredible culture,\" he said, when asked about how he felt about his movie star-like fame whenever he visits.",

    "fullText": "HONG KONG/BEIJING, Jan 30 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Keir Starmer's visit to China is the latest win Beijing can tout in its rivalry with Washington, but the deals he brings back to London also show the limits of the balancing act that middle powers may try to play.\n\nHe follows Canadian counterpart Mark ​Carney, who struck a trade deal on a similar visit weeks ago, before heading to Davos to herald a new global trade order as U.S. President Donald Trump disrupts long-standing ties with ‌allies.\n\nEuropean leaders have also visited, as have India's Narendra Modi and others since Trump began his second term a year ago, but it is less clear what tangible long-term economic and security benefits such visits yield for Western powers.\n\n\"Traditional U.S. allies feel hard done ‌by and are now hedging their bets, but they are far from being able or willing to substitute China for the United States,\" said John Quelch, an expert in global strategy at Duke Kunshan University.\n\nFrom the perspective of London, Ottawa and other Western capitals, the visits demonstrate to Trump that alternatives exist if he keeps up pressure on issues from Greenland to renegotiating the USMCA trade deal among the United States, Canada and Mexico.\n\nBut these are \"superficial gestures amid stalled global growth,\" said Alicia Garcia-Herrero, chief Asia-Pacific economist at Natixis.\n\n\"These visits highlight the severe limits of any 'pivot' to China,\" she said. \"They expose middle powers' vulnerability, chasing scraps while China's export flood overwhelms their industries.\"\n\nAnd they ⁠benefit Beijing, by supporting the narrative of a broad pivot to China ‌as the world's \"reliable partner\", in contrast with Trump's chaotic tariff policies and his growing list of threats and demands towards partners and rivals alike.\n\n\"President Trump’s efforts to decouple the United States from China are also decoupling the United States from the world,\" Quelch added.\n\nSTARMER SCORES WINS ON VISAS, WHISKY\n\nThe deals clinched by Western powers on such ‍visits come in return for deeper integration with a country that ran a trade surplus the size of the Dutch economy last year but where consumption is too weak for even its own producers to prosper at home.\n\nOn his trip to the world's second largest economy, Starmer secured 30-day visa-free access for Britons travelling to China and lower tariffs on whisky, while British drugmaker AstraZeneca unveiled a $15 billion investment in China.\n\nHe got nothing beyond \"frank dialogue\" on tension arising from China's ​increasingly assertive stance on Taiwan, its stronger ties with Russia after the Ukraine invasion and a rights crackdown on Britain's former colony of Hong Kong.\n\nBritish and U.S. politicians who criticised Starmer's trip also aired accusations ‌of espionage and human rights abuse, which Beijing denies.\n\nSimilarly, Carney left China with expectations that Beijing will cut or drop tariffs on canola, lobsters, crabs and peas, but that triggered threats of 100% tariffs from Trump, who warned Ottawa about allowing Chinese EVs into North America.\n\nAnd even before Starmer has wrapped up his China visit, Trump warned Britain it was dangerous to get into business with Beijing, after the prime minister extolled the economic benefits of resetting relations with China.\n\nCHINA'S EXPORT-DRIVEN GROWTH POSES RISKS FOR WEST\n\nChina's imports last year were flat at $2.6 trillion, but they were largely driven by energy and commodities from emerging markets, rather than the West.\n\nIts trade surplus, however, jumped a fifth, to a record $1.2 trillion, as its manufacturers responded to Trump's tariff measures by muscling into virtually every other market in the world, at the expense of domestic producers.\n\nSuch a ⁠pace of growth puts China's trade surplus on track to roughly reach the size of the $3-trillion French economy by 2030 and ​the $5-trillion German economy by 2033.\n\nIts exports to the European Union last year jumped 8.4%, while imports dipped 0.4%. China shipped 7.8% ​more to Britain, while buying 4.7% less. With Canada, sales grew 3.2% while purchases plunged 10.4%.\n\n\"This makes it an especially risky proposition for countries trying to protect or grow their own manufacturing industries to substantially increase trade integration with China,\" said Eswar Prasad, a former China director at the International Monetary Fund.\n\n\"China hardly provides a safe harbour for ‍countries trying to cope with the adverse economic effects ⁠of U.S. tariffs,\" added Prasad, who now teaches trade policy at Cornell University.\n\nStill, say some analysts, significant trade wins with China may not be as important - or even realistic - for countries such as Britain or Canada right now.\n\nResetting ties may be the best they can get, but that could still be valuable, as previous deterioration in relations exposed critical supply chain dependencies on China.\n\nThe Asian ⁠giant's trade countermeasures helped to widen two-way trade imbalances, rather than narrow them, analysts said.\n\nThe visits by Starmer and Carney are \"a propaganda coup for Beijing,\" said Noah Barkin, Europe-China expert at the German Marshall Fund and Rhodium Group, while warning, \"This is not a ‌pivot to China. It is about reducing tension with Beijing.\"\n\nHe added, \"No country wants to be in open conflict with the two superpowers at the same time.\"\n\n(Additional reporting by Liangping Gao ‌and Kevin Yao in Beijing and David Kirton in Shenzhen; Writing by Marius Zaharia; Editing by Clarence Fernandez)",
