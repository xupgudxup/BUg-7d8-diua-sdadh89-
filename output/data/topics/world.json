    "fullText": "Billionaire Mark Cuban isn't pretending to have all the answers. When someone on Bluesky said he could “literally end world hunger” without making a dent in his net worth, Cuban didn't brush it off. Instead, he answered, “I’m in! Tell me how.”\n\nWhen a second user doubled down, saying Cuban must not be that smart if he didn't know how his wealth could help end hunger, Cuban fired back sarcastically: “I’m dumb. I can’t figure out how to end world hunger.” But he quickly pivoted to something he believes he can do something about: the American healthcare system.\n\n“I do promise that I will continue to change healthcare in this country and make it more affordable, possibly setting a path towards Universal Healthcare,” Cuban said.\n\nFast Company Calls It a ‘Groundbreaking Step for the Creator Economy' — Investors Can Still Get In at $0.85/Share\n\nEarn While You Scroll: The Deloitte-Ranked #1 Software Company Growing 32,481% Is Opening Its $0.50/Share Round to Accredited Investors.\n\nHe's already been making moves. Through his company, Cost Plus Drugs, Cuban is working to bring down drug prices by eliminating the middlemen who inflate costs. The company adds just a 15% markup on medications and publishes its entire price list online. It now offers over 6,000 medications.\n\nCuban has been especially critical of pharmacy benefit managers, who he believes were supposed to lower costs but have instead become profit-driven giants. According to him, they acquired insurance providers and retail pharmacies and are now attempting to expand into pharmaceutical manufacturing. “They got greedy,” Cuban told Fortune earlier this year.\n\nAlthough Cuban believes “healthcare is a right,” he argues that moving the U.S. to a universal healthcare system isn't the quick fix people assume it is. In a September post on X, he said, “The easy answer is to say Universal Healthcare. The challenge is that every single country that has UHC, moved to it before medical science introduced advanced expensive equipment.”\n\nTrending: An EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace—Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\n\nHe added that the hard part is delivering care fairly without financially devastating doctors and hospitals. “The only challenge is how we design the system that works in this country,” he wrote.\n\nCuban has floated an alternative idea: keep insurers from being the central force, eliminate premiums, and expand cash-pay options with clear pricing. That way, patients would commit to what they can afford, with taxpayers covering the rest.",

    "fullText": "LOS ANGELES (AP) — Peter Arnett, the Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter who spent decades dodging bullets and bombs to bring the world eyewitness accounts of war from the rice paddies of Vietnam to the deserts of Iraq, has died. He was 91.\n\nArnett, who won the 1966 Pulitzer Prize for international reporting for his Vietnam War coverage for The Associated Press, died Wednesday in Newport Beach and was surrounded by friends and family, said his son Andrew Arnett. He had been suffering from prostate cancer.\n\n“Peter Arnett was one of the greatest war correspondents of his generation — intrepid, fearless, and a beautiful writer and storyteller. His reporting in print and on camera will remain a legacy for aspiring journalists and historians for generations to come,” said Edith Lederer, who was a fellow AP war correspondent in Vietnam in 1972-73 and is now AP’s chief correspondent at the United Nations.\n\nAs a wire-service correspondent, Arnett was known mostly to fellow journalists when he reported in Vietnam from 1962 until the war's end in 1975. He became something of a household name in 1991, however, after he broadcast live updates for CNN from Iraq during the first Gulf War.\n\nWhile almost all Western reporters had fled Baghdad in the days before the U.S.-led attack, Arnett stayed. As missiles began raining on the city, he broadcast a live account by cellphone from his hotel room.\n\n\"There was an explosion right near me, you may have heard,\" he said in a calm, New Zealand-accented voice moments after the loud boom of a missile strike rattled across the airwaves. As he continued to speak air-raid sirens blared in the background.\n\n\"I think that took out the telecommunications center,\" he said of another explosion. “They are hitting the center of the city.”\n\nIt was not the first time Arnett had gotten dangerously close to the action.\n\nIn January 1966, he joined a battalion of U.S. soldiers seeking to rout North Vietnamese snipers and was standing next to the battalion commander when an officer paused to read a map.\n\n\"As the colonel peered at it, I heard four loud shots as bullets tore through the map and into his chest, a few inches from my face,” Arnett recalled during a talk to the American Library Association in 2013. “He sank to the ground at my feet.”\n\nHe would begin the fallen soldier’s obituary like this: \"He was the son of a general, a West Pointer and a battalion commander. But Lt. Colonel George Eyster was to die like a rifleman. It may have been the colonel's leaves of rank on his collar, or the map he held in his hand, or just a wayward chance that the Viet Cong sniper chose Eyster from the five of us standing in that dusty jungle path.\"\n\nArnett had arrived in Vietnam just a year after joining AP as its Indonesia correspondent. That job would be short-lived after he reported Indonesia’s economy was in shambles and the country’s enraged leadership threw him out. His expulsion marked only the first of several controversies in which he would find himself embroiled, while also forging an historic career.\n\nAt the AP’s Saigon bureau in 1962, Arnett found himself surrounded by a formidable roster of journalists, including bureau chief Malcolm Browne and photo editor Horst Faas, who between them would win three Pulitzer Prizes.\n\nHe credited Browne in particular with teaching him many of the survival tricks that would keep him alive in war zones over the next 40 years. Among them: Never stand near a medic or radio operator because they're among the first the enemy will shoot at. And if you hear a gunshot coming from the other side, don't look around to see who fired it because the next one will likely hit you.\n\nArnett would stay in Vietnam until the capital, Saigon, fell to the Communist-backed North Vietnamese rebels in 1975. In the time leading up to those final days, he was ordered by AP’s New York headquarters to begin destroying the bureau’s papers as coverage of the war wound down.\n\nInstead, he shipped them to his apartment in New York, believing they’d have historic value someday. They’re now in the AP’s archives.\n\nArnett remained with the AP until 1981, when he joined the newly-formed CNN.\n\nTen years later he was in Baghdad covering another war. He not only reported on the front-line fighting but won exclusive, and controversial, interviews with then-President Saddam Hussein and future 9/11 mastermind Osama bin Laden.\n\nIn 1995 he published the memoir, “Live From the Battlefield: From Vietnam to Baghdad, 35 Years in the World's War Zones.”\n\nArnett resigned from CNN in 1999, months after the network retracted an investigative report he did not prepare but narrated alleging that deadly Sarin nerve gas had been used on deserting American soldiers in Laos in 1970.\n\nHe was covering the second Gulf War for NBC and National Geographic in 2003 when he was fired for granting an interview to Iraqi state TV during which he criticized the U.S. military’s war strategy. His remarks were denounced back home as anti-American.\n\nAfter his dismissal, TV critics for the AP and other news organizations speculated that Arnett would never work in television news again. Within a week, however, he had been hired to report on the war for stations in Taiwan, the United Arab Emirates and Belgium.\n\nIn 2007, he took a job teaching journalism at China’s Shantou University. Following his retirement in 2014, he and his wife, Nina Nguyen, moved to the Southern California suburb of Fountain Valley.\n\nBorn Nov. 13, 1934, in Riverton, New Zealand, Peter Arnett got his first exposure to journalism when he landed a job at his local newspaper, the Southland Times, shortly after high school.\n\n\"I didn't really have a clear idea of where my life would take me, but I do remember that first day when I walked into the newspaper office as an employee and found my little desk, and I did have a — you know — enormously delicious feeling that I'd found my place,\" he recalled in a 2006 AP oral history.\n\nAfter a few years at the Times, he made plans to move to a larger newspaper in London. En route to England by ship, however, he made a stop in Thailand and fell in love with the country.\n\nSoon he was working for the English-language Bangkok World, and later for its sister newspaper in Laos. There he would make the connections that led him to the AP and a lifetime of covering war.\n\nArnett is survived by his wife and their children, Elsa and Andrew.\n\n\"He was like a brother,\" said retired AP photographer Nick Ut, who covered combat in Vietnam with Arnett and remained his friend for a half century. \"His death will leave a big hole in my life.”\n\nAP journalist Audrey McAvoy contributed to this report.",

    "title": "Gut bacteria have evolved rapidly to digest starches in ultra-processed foods",
    "description": "UCLA study finds gut microbes are evolving differently in industrialized and non-industrialized parts of the world.",
    "fullText": "Gut bacteria evolve rapidly in response to different diets, UCLA evolutionary biologists report in a new study. The researchers found that gene variants that help microbes digest starches found in ultra-processed foods have “swept” the genomes of some species of gut bacteria in industrialized parts of the world. Because these starches are industrially produced and have only been around for a few decades, scientists believe natural selection must have been acting strongly to make these genes dominant so quickly. What’s more, the researchers have discovered that bacteria are evolving differently in industrialized and non-industrialized parts of the world.\n\nThe study’s findings, published in Nature, scanned the genomes of almost three dozen species of gut bacteria using data from around the world and identified a process called horizontal gene transfer, in which bacteria transfer DNA from one strain to another, as the mechanism for this rapid evolution. Horizontal gene transfer has previously been identified as the mechanism that allows bacteria to evolve antibiotic resistance so quickly, but the prevalence of this process in gut microbes has been relatively unknown until now.\n\n“The discovery that the ability to digest novel starches is a target of natural selection in gut bacteria is interesting, but we found an even more robust, stronger signal that there are different targets of selection across many genes and many species in industrialized and non-industrialized populations,” said UCLA doctoral student and paper first author Richard Wolff. “What are the gut microbiomes in industrialized populations responding to? We’ve picked out one example with these starches, but there’s likely many possibilities we haven’t grappled with yet.”\n\nWolff and corresponding author, UCLA professor of ecology and evolutionary biology Nandita Garud, developed a novel statistic that identifies locations in the DNA of 30 gut bacteria species where genes have risen to high frequency, or “swept,” in that species. The statistic looks for tiny regions of homogeneity against a backdrop of immense diversity separating different strains of the same species.\n\n“Different strains of E. coli, for example, have diverged from each other as much as humans have diverged from chimps, yet we call them the same species. Despite this diversity, there are still shared fragments of DNA present in many hosts — a hidden thread connecting our microbiomes,” said Garud.\n\nDifferent genes appeared to be selected for in industrialized and non-industrialized populations, and one gene in particular was sweeping only in industrialized populations. That gene is associated with the ability to digest maltodextrin, which is made from cornstarch and has been used in processed foods since the 1960s.\n\n“We saw the adaptive signal very strongly, but we can’t say for sure yet if it’s specializing in maltodextrin or a broader class of starch derivatives. There might be intermediate steps as the bacteria adapt to different starch sources,” said Wolff. “There are a lot of steps in between eating a diet full of cassava and breadfruit and a diet full of Hot Cheetos or something like that.”\n\nBacteria can take up DNA from their environment in many different ways: They can eat it; they can be infected by a virus that carries DNA between them; and it can be transmitted when bacteria clump together and form a bridge that allows them to move between each other.\n\nBut humans have only a few strains of the same species of gut bacteria, and these strains typically stay with each person for many years. So the pervasiveness of the newly discovered adaptation raises the question: How do DNA fragments become shared between individual humans?\n\n“Each person might have a couple of different strains of E. coli,” said Garud. “If fragments of DNA are transmitted horizontally across different strains in different hosts, and these strains seemingly are faithful to their respective hosts, where do they recombine? How do they move between individual people to become fixed in a whole population?”\n\nWhile the answer will emerge with future research, the discovery that gut bacteria evolve rapidly in response to different diets, and the possibility that novel starches may be exerting strong evolutionary pressure on them, suggest that careful attention to what we eat could play a more varied role in promoting good health than we think.\n\nThe research was funded by the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation.",

    "description": "YouTube announced that it has secured the global rights to Hollywood's biggest night, a major victory in the fight over live events.",
    "fullText": "Hollywood's biggest night is going to a streamer.\n\nThe Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced on Wednesday that YouTube will hold the global rights to the Oscars from 2029 through 2033.\n\nWhile that means they'll no longer be on ABC starting in 2029, ending a more than 50-year run of consecutive broadcasts on the television network, the Oscars will continue to be available for free worldwide — just on YouTube and YouTube TV. As part of the partnership, red carpet coverage and other behind-the-scenes content from before the award show is also included.\n\nThe news comes as streamers like YouTube, Netflix, and Amazon Prime, and others, increasingly compete over live events to host on their respective platforms. Historically, the Oscars are one of the most-watched nights of TV, and in non-presidential election years, it is often the only non-sporting event to chart within the top 100 most-watched telecasts of the year.\n\n\"The Oscars are one of our essential cultural institutions, honoring excellence in storytelling and artistry,\" YouTube CEO Neal Mohan said in a statement. \"Partnering with the Academy to bring this celebration of art and entertainment to viewers all over the world will inspire a new generation of creativity and film lovers while staying true to the Oscars' storied legacy.\"\n\nDisney and ABC will continue to hold the rights to the Oscars through 2028, including the milestone 100th Academy Awards.\n\nOutside of the Oscars, the Google Arts & Culture initiative will provide digital access to select Academy Museum exhibitions and programs, the academy said in a statement.\n\nThe agreement was also struck at a time when YouTube has evolved beyond a place people post and watch short clips and amateur videos on mobile and desktop to become a fixture in the living room. The monthly Nielsen Gauge shows YouTube grabbing the top spot in share of TV viewing among media companies for months running, with a 12.9% share in October, ahead of Disney (11.4%) and NBCUniversal (8.6%).\n\nThe nature of what people are watching has also changed. The streaming data analysis company Digital i found that videos lasting 30 minutes or more accounted for 73% of total viewing on YouTube in the US in October 2024, up 8% from a year earlier.\n\nYouTube has encouraged this shift, rolling out new tools for creators to incentivize them to make serialized shows that look like what you think of as traditional TV.\n\nYouTube's living room-domination plans loomed in the background of its recent highly public dispute with Disney over how much it should pay the media company to carry its channels like ESPN and ABC News on YouTube TV. Google recently shared numbers showing YouTube TV was the No. 4 pay-TV service in the US.\n\nTraditional media companies have tried to combat YouTube's expansion by taking a page from the platform and striking deals with YouTube video creators and podcasters.",

    "description": "James Trafford is up against one of the best in the world in Gianluigi Donnarumma, but should he stick it out as number two at Manchester City?",
    "fullText": "On Tuesday afternoon, James Trafford was preparing for Manchester City's Carabao Cup quarter-final against Brentford after boss Pep Guardiola told the media he would be starting the game.\n\nAt the same time, Gianluigi Donnarumma was polishing his latest individual accolade having been named Fifa best goalkeeper for 2025, three months on from winning a similar gong at the Ballon d'Or awards.\n\nIt sums up how Trafford is up against the very best in the business.\n\nThe Englishman started the season as number one after returning to City in the summer but has been warming the bench since the arrival of the towering Italian from Paris St-Germain.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trafford provided a reminder of his capabilities with a solid clean sheet in City's 2-0 victory over the Bees which helped the side into the semi-finals of the competition where they will face Newcastle. However, a return to the bench awaits for the visit of West Ham in the Premier League on Saturday.\n\n\"He is a goalkeeper, James cannot play left-back,\" said Guardiola. \"At the moment we have a keeper in Gigio playing in that position but he is a top keeper, there is no doubt about that. I am really pleased he can play two more games.\n\n\"He played in the Champions League and I am a guy who wants to give opportunities to everyone.\"",

    "description": "“I don't even know how it's been approved, to be honest,” said boxing world champ Skye Nicolson.",
    "fullText": "Anthony Joshua will make quick work of Jake Paul when the fighters collide atop a Netflix show at the Kaseya Center in Miami, Florida, this Friday, Dec. 19.\n\nThat’s according to former WBC featherweight world champion and current WBC interim super bantamweight titleholder Skye Nicolson, a Matchroom stablemate of Joshua’s, who told Uncrowned on Tuesday that “it’s going to be very one-sided, and over early, in favor of Anthony Joshua.”\n\nThe fight represents a considerable step-up for Paul, who has feasted mostly on a diet of past-their-prime MMA fighters and journeymen boxers in the boxing ring.\n\nHis sole loss came against Tommy Fury in 2023, but he has since rebounded with visible improvements and wins over Mike Perry, a 58-year-old Mike Tyson, and a 39-year-old Julio Cesar Chavez Jr., the latter of whom is a former middleweight world champion.\n\nRegardless, the gulf in amateur background, skill set and accomplishments between Paul and Joshua, a former two-time heavyweight king, is vast. And Joshua is the heavy betting favorite for a reason.\n\nNicolson commended Paul for his “almost delu-lu confidence” but said she couldn’t “see it going any other way apart from a very one-sided early finish” because “it's [a] scarily dangerous” matchup for Paul.\n\n“I don't even know how it's been approved, to be honest, but I guess money talks,” Nicolson said on Uncrowned's \"The Ariel Helwani Show.\" “We'll see on Friday, but I don't see what Jake's seeing.”\n\nOne of the things Paul perhaps sees is Joshua’s apparent struggles when dealing with fighting smaller heavyweights, as 6-foot-2 fighter Andy Ruiz Jr. shook up the world by upsetting Joshua in 2019, before 6-foot-3 Oleksandr Usyk toppled \"AJ\" in back-to-back bouts in 2022 to 2023.\n\n“Ruiz, Usyk … Jake Paul? There's levels,\" Nicolson said.\n\nShe then reiterated her prediction for the fight, and that it would represent a poor reflection for the sport of boxing if it even went the distance. “If it goes past two rounds, I will be shocked,” she said.\n\nNicolson continued: “I think [Paul's] improved. He works really, really hard. He’s putting his absolute all into it. You can't knock any of the effort, but there are levels. And [Joshua] is not an Olympic gold medalist and a former world champion for nothing. He's naturally huge. And Jake Paul's not. If it goes past two rounds, I will be very shocked.”\n\nNicolson finished by remarking that the only acceptable result for boxing, and for Joshua, is for the Brit to batter Paul. “If he goes the distance with Jake Paul, it’s not good for boxing,” she said.\n\n“It’s good for boxing if he doesn’t kill Jake, obviously, which is possible. But … if it goes eight whole rounds and he doesn’t knock out Jake, that will definitely be tainting to AJ’s legacy.”\n\nThe Paul vs. Joshua main card airs Friday on Netflix from 8 p.m. ET.

Once again, we will have to liberate Vienna. Well, perhaps the Austrians will reconsider. It doesn’t mean that we want this. But one of the principles postulated by our supreme commander-in-chief is when we are forced to act, then we act.”\n\nSolovyov’s rant followed him as he traveled to the Ukrainian city of Pokrovsk for a propaganda hit last week. Russian President Vladimir Putin has so far been unable to capture the city in its years-long conflict with Ukraine.\n\nSolovyov’s rant also dropped as concerns are growing about Russia possibly targeting another country on top of their invasion of Ukraine.\n\nHungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto cautioned this week that tensions are escalating with Russia and Europe would not survive a war.\n\n“Freezing Russian assets was already a serious step, but using those assets goes even further. This is a war provocation of an unprecedented scale,” he said about the EU using frozen Russian assets. “Therefore, at today’s Foreign Affairs Council, I will make it clear that for Hungary, the risk of further escalation is unacceptable. Simply because if a war were to break out between Europe and Russia, Europe would not survive it.”\n\nBrussels wants to send another €210 billion to Ukraine, including around €115 billion for weapons.\n\nThe EU is disregarding its own rules by planning to finance this package through frozen Russian assets.

Mark Rutte, secretary general of the NATO alliance, made a similar warning.\n\n“The shadow of war is knocking on Europe’s door and that war could be bigger and bloodier than what we have experienced in recent times,” Rutte said.\n\nSolovyov has gone on fiery, scorched-Earth rants in the past, openly fantasizing in July about a nuclear attack on the United States.\n\n“It doesn’t mean that we want this. But one of the principles postulated by our supreme commander-in-chief is when we are forced to act then we act. First, of course, the principle of ‘do no harm’ but then…please don’t blame us,” Solovyov said on Tuesday.\n\nWhile speaking in Moscow this week, Putin denied Russian plans to invade Europe, dismissing warnings to prepare for potential war as “hysteria.”\n\nThe post Putin Ally Names European Countries Russia Will ‘Destroy’ as World War III Fears Loom first appeared on Mediaite.",

It marked the industry’s ​biggest electric-vehicle retreat since U.S. President Donald Trump’s sweeping auto-policy changes iced already cooling EV demand.\n\nFarley had spent years telling staff and investors that catching up to Tesla and China’s leading EV makers amounted to an existential struggle. ‌Now – after losing about $13 billion on EVs since 2023 – Farley says the path to survival lies in ditching these unprofitable models.\n\n“We can't allocate money for things that will not make money,” he told Reuters on Monday. “As much as I love those products, the customers in the U.S. were not going to pay for ‌them. And that was the end of that.”\n\nFarley’s angst reflects the broader conundrum facing auto executives in the wake of Trump-administration policies that stripped the industry of EV subsidies and eased restrictions on tailpipe pollution.\n\nMost automakers now can’t sell EVs in the U.S. profitably or in volume – but must sell them in China, Europe and other markets to appease regulators and compete with Chinese automakers expanding globally.\n\nThat’s left Ford and other automakers with the challenge of tailoring vastly different vehicle lineups for different regions.\n\nThe approach layers on extra expenses the industry thought it had left behind in recent decades through globalization – making essentially the same car, with common supply chains, to sell worldwide. Fifteen years ago, then-CEO Alan Mulally called the strategy ‘One Ford.’\n\nNow Farley needs many Fords. His company and others have been turning to partnerships to absorb ⁠the extra costs of catering to different global markets. Renault and Ford earlier this month ‌announced they would partner to build affordable EVs for Europe.\n\nFollowing the partnership announcement, Ford said Monday it won’t build the electric commercial van it initially planned for that market. Ford has also been seeking a Chinese partner to provide EV platform technologies, Reuters has reported.\n\nOn EVs, Farley hopes to thread the needle by killing most EV models but preserving a $30,000 midsize electric truck due out in 2027, ‍which a specialized skunkworks team in California has engineered to take on EV powerhouses Tesla and China's BYD.",

    "fullText": "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — Saturn's giant moon Titan may not have a vast underground ocean after all.\n\nTitan instead may hold deep layers of ice and slush more akin to Earth’s polar seas, with pockets of melted water where life could possibly survive and even thrive, scientists reported Wednesday.\n\nThe team led by researchers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory challenged the decade-long assumption of a buried global ocean at Titan after taking a fresh look at observations made years ago by NASA’s Cassini spacecraft around Saturn.\n\nThey stress that no one has found any signs of life at Titan, the solar system’s second largest moon spanning 3,200 miles (5,150 kilometers) and brimming with lakes of liquid methane on its frosty surface.\n\nBut with the latest findings suggesting a slushy, near-melting environment, “there is strong justification for continued optimism regarding the potential for extraterrestrial life,” said the University of Washington’s Baptiste Journaux, who took part in the study published in the journal Nature.\n\nAs to what form of life that might be, possibly strictly microscopic, “nature has repeatedly demonstrated far greater creativity than the most imaginative scientists,\" he said in an email.\n\nJPL’s Flavio Petricca, the lead author, said Titan’s ocean may have frozen in the past and is currently melting, or its hydrosphere might be evolving toward complete freezing.\n\nComputer models suggest these layers of ice, slush and water extend to a depth of more than 340 miles (550 kilometers). The outer ice shell is thought to be about 100 miles (170 kilometers) deep, covering layers of slush and pools of water that could go down another 250 miles (400 kilometers). This water could be as warm as 68 degrees Fahrenheit (20 degrees Celsius).\n\nBecause Titan is tidally locked, the same side of the moon faces Saturn all the time, just like our own moon and Earth. Saturn’s gravitational pull is so intense that it deforms the moon’s surface, creating bulges as high as 30 feet (10 meters) when the two bodies are closest.\n\nThrough improved data processing, Petricca and his team managed to measure the timing between the peak gravitational tug and the rising of Titan’s surface. If the moon held a wet ocean, the effect would be immediate, Petricca said, but a 15-hour gap was detected, indicating an interior of slushy ice with pockets of liquid water. Computer modeling of Titan’s orientation in space supported their theory.\n\nSapienza University of Rome’s Luciano Iess, whose previous studies using Cassini data indicated a hidden ocean at Titan, is not convinced by the latest findings.\n\nWhile “certainly intriguing and will stimulate renewed discussion ... at present, the available evidence looks certainly not sufficient to exclude Titan from the family of ocean worlds,\" Iess said in an email.\n\nNASA’s planned Dragonfly mission — featuring a helicopter-type craft due to launch to Titan later this decade — is expected to provide more clarity on the moon’s innards. Journaux is part of that team.\n\nSaturn leads the solar system’s moon inventory with 274. Jupiter’s moon Ganymede is just a little larger than Titan, with a possible underground ocean. Other suspected water worlds include Saturn’s Enceladus and Jupiter’s Europa, both of which are believed to have geysers of water erupting from their frozen crusts.\n\nLaunched in 1997, Cassini reached Saturn in 2004, orbiting the ringed planet and flying past its moons until deliberately plunging through Saturn’s atmosphere in 2017.\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

    "fullText": "▾ Previous: Around The World, Part 27: Planting trees\n\nFri, 12 Dec 2025 by Thomas ten Cate · Comments\n\n Game Development, Around the World\n\nEven though the in-game world is fairly small compared to Earth, I want it to feel big. Part of that is being able to see things that are far away.\n\nFor context: by now, I have settled on a third-person “chase camera” rather than a top-down view. It feels so much more immersive, and makes the gameplay (in particular, matching up maps to your surroundings) more interesting as well.\n\nRemember that my world is now a flat plane that wraps around, rather than an actual sphere. However, it would be great if we could still make it look like a sphere, so that distant lands would gradually appear over the horizon. Mountains would be visible from a greater distance, so that the terrain actually matters beyond just the shape of the coastline.\n\nUntil now, I’ve been using a view distance of 5 km. That’s still a lot compared to other open-world games! But a landmass at 5 km does not look very far away, because it’s so big. For gameplay purposes, it would be good if view distance could be increased to about 25 km. Otherwise, the part of the world that the player can see is too small compared to the maps, and they won’t have anything to orient themselves by.\n\nHow does it work out if we just look at the geometry? My planar planet is 512 km wide, so let’s pretent that’s the circumference of a spherical planet. Its radius would then be 83 km. Terrain generation is scaled down relative to the real world, so that the tallest mountain is about 2500 m high. Assuming a ship of up to 25 m tall, the mountain’s peak will be visible over the horizon from 22 km away. That’s pretty close to the 25 km I figured out above, so I decided to sail with these numbers for now: let’s fake a planet radius of 83 km.\n\nWe now have some problems to solve.\n\nTo actually be able to sail around the world, you need to be able to sail off the west edge and reappear at the east edge, and vice versa. That’s easy enough to implement with some modular arithmetic applied to the ship’s coordinates. However, any nearby objects and terrain must also exhibit the same wrapping: if you are near the west edge of the world, you should be able to see across it, so anything near the east edge would have to be moved near you as well. This, too, can be implemented with some modular arithmetic.\n\nHowever, it would have to be applied to every object in the game individually. That’s tedious at best, and bad for performance at worst, so I came up with the solution of parenting every object to a 2×2 km chunk. Only the chunks are moving around; their children just come along for the ride. The node hierarchy looks like this:\n\nHere’s an example of how a nearby NPC ship would become visible, even though it’s all the way on the other side of the map in world coordinates:\n\nThe chunks themselves take care to move their children to adjacent chunks whenever they cross a chunk boundary, so the code of individual objects doesn’t need to care about the chunking at all.\n\nAs before with the spherical world, we’re going to run into floating-point precision issues. Godot by default uses 32-bit floats for object and vertex positions, which have only 23 bits of precision; at 512 km from the origin, the distance between two successive floating-point numbers is about 6 cm. The official recommendation in the Godot docs is not to go beyond 8 km for a 3D third-person game, and not beyond 64 km for any 3D game.\n\nI started out hoping that this wouldn’t be an issue, but it turns out to be real: far away from the world origin, the ship started jittering weirdly, and the sails started jittering relative to the ship. A solution was needed.\n\nBuilding Godot with 64-bits precision is possible, but adds a lot of overhead: now every vector and matrix in the game uses twice the memory, including the large procedurally generated terrain meshes. Would that be a problem? Not necessarily, but it turns out there’s now an easier solution.\n\nSince we’re moving chunks around anyway, we can implement a floating origin system there as well. Just before rendering a frame, the chunk containing the player’s ship is moved to the global origin (0, 0), and all other chunks are positioned relative to it:\n\nThis ensures that every object we care about remains close to the global origin, where floating-point precision is sufficient. As long as none of the code assumes that global coordinates (relative to Godot’s global origin) are the same as world coordinates (relative to the north-west corner of the world map), this works great: the jitter is gone.\n\nLet’s take a look at how we could implement a fake planet curvature. In particular, I want distant objects to gradually sink below the horizon.\n\nThis could be done in a vertex shader: simply compute the distance to the camera (measured on the horizontal plane), calculate how far downwards the vertex should move, and move it:\n\nThe drawback is that this shader would need to be applied to every object in the world, meaning I would have to use custom shaders everywhere and couldn’t benefit from Godot’s built-in materials anymore. Tedious! Another drawback is that the visible meshes would no longer align with their physics shapes, which becomes relevant if we want to do object picking (e.g. clicking on the peak of a distant mountain to set a course towards it).\n\nBut I had an idea I wanted to try. Now that we have chunks, maybe we could pull the chunks themselves downwards, and have all their children come along for the ride?\n\nMy first attempt was to introduce some skew. In 3D games, the position and orientation of an object is usually represented as a matrix, and mine is no different. Godot uses 3×4 matrices: a 3×3 part to represent rotation and scale, and a 3x1 part for translation. But rotation has 3 degrees of freedom, and scale has another 3, so that means that we have 3 more degrees of freedom we can play with to make the chunk align (somewhat) with the sphere. Because chunks are in the y = 0 plane and are neither rotated nor scaled, the matrix looks like this, where tx, 0, tz is the translation vector (the chunk’s position):\n\nIf we want to move points within the chunk only on the vertical axis (y), depending on their position in the xz plane, we have two components rx, rz we can play with, as well as ty:\n\nMy idea is then as follows: modify these variables rx, rz, ty in such a way that the chunk’s corners end up on the sphere. Because we have 4 corners and only 3 variables, this is impossible; instead, we do it only for the 3 corners that are closest to the camera, and let the 4th end up where it will. It’s hard to draw in 3D, but in 2D you can see the idea better:\n\nEvery object inside these chunks will end up skewed as well, but because the effect is slight, this shouldn’t be visible.\n\nHere’s how it looks when I modify the curvature in real time:\n\nAt lower curvatures, it’s quite effective!\n\nHowever, there’s a problem with this approach that might not be obvious at first: physics. The built-in Godot Physics engine is well known to be bad at anything except pure translation and rotation; it doesn’t even support scaling. The newly integrated Jolt engine is better in this regard, but it draws the line at skewing, and starts emitting a lot of errors if a physics shape like a cylinder has any skew introduced to it.\n\nSo, let’s try something so stupid that it couldn’t possibly work: do not skew chunks at all, but just move them on the vertical axis, like this:\n\nAmazingly, at small curvatures such as I’m using, this works just fine and the visual difference compared to skewing is not even noticeable. You might think it would introduce visible cracks between terrain chunks, but no: because farther chunks are moved farther downwards, the cracks are always hidden behind nearby terrain. It’s a keeper!\n\nNow that we have the ability to make stuff gradually appear over the horizon, we need some stuff that actually will gradually appear over the horizon. With a ship of 25 m tall, even though the horizon itself is (surprisingly) only 2 km away, we can see tall mountains at a distance of 25 km. So a draw distance of 5 km is not nearly enough anymore.\n\nIt’s easy enough to increase this value in the configuration, but this increased the amount of terrain by a factor of 5² = 25, and tanked the frame rate. Some quick math shows that, at the terrain resolution of 8 m that I’m using, the 50×50 km patch of terrain around the player consists of 39 million triangles, and this is too much for my GPU.\n\nFortunately, we don’t need that many triangles, because on distant terrain they’re smaller than a pixel. It’s time to introduce a LOD (level-of-detail) scheme to our terrain: render nearby terrain at full detail, but reduce the number of triangles on terrain chunks farther away.\n\nA classic problem with this are seams, or cracks, between adjacent terrain meshes of a different LOD. It’s often just a few pixels, but it’s still quite visible especially in motion. Here, I tweaked some values to make the problem more visible:\n\nThere are various solutions. The most elegant is to introduce special bits of mesh to cover the cracks, which are only made visible when the two adjacent terrain chunks are currently displayed at different LODs. Due to all the different edge cases (pun wholeheartedly intended), it’s surprisingly fiddly to get this right.\n\nFortunately there’s a simpler method, which is to simply add a ‘skirt’ of quads that hangs down from the edge of each chunk:\n\nThe normals on the skirt are copied from the adjacent vertices, so they receive the same lighting, and it won’t look as if there’s an actual small cliff there. And with that, the crack is gone:\n\nThis should also cover up any cracks caused by moving chunks vertically, though I haven’t spotted any so far.\n\nThe trees I added in the previous post make a huge difference to the believability and sense of scale of the terrain. It would be sad if they couldn’t be rendered up to a large distance.\n\nHowever, as it currently stands, being near a rainforest will drop the framerate to about 40 fps; the tree meshes take 15 ms to render. Since I want this game to run well on potato hardware, it should run at around 150-200 fps on my mid-range Radeon RX 7600 card, meaning a frame budget of only 5-7 ms.\n\nThe standard trick is to not render full meshes at a large distance, but rather pre-render the mesh into a texture from various points of view, and then just render a single quad with the texture applied: an impostor.\n\nGodot doesn’t have support for impostors built in, but adding tooling inside the editor is really easy, so I built this quick and dirty impostor baking scene:\n\nIt iterates through all the tree meshes at 8 different angles, and renders each to a suitably sized viewport through an orthogonal camera (to simulate an infinite distance). Each orientation is rendered twice: once to capture colour and alpha, once to capture normals. The textures have pretty low resolution, but that’s fine, because they’re never viewed up close anyway:\n\nThese are then applied directly to the impostor quad, depending on the viewing angle:\n\nThis increased the frame rate from 40 fps to about 130 fps. There’s some more low-hanging fruit that will improve the frame rate further, so this is fast enough for the time being.\n\nLet’s see all of the above in action while the player sails towards a remote island: the distant terrain, planet curvature, and tree impostors. I’ve edited the video for brevity, because it ran over 3 minutes; one of the biggest game design challenges will be to make sure the player has something to do during these long voyages.\n\nThe transition from impostors to real geometry is still fairly noticeable, probably because the impostors cast a smaller shadow. But it’s plenty good enough for now.\n\n▾ Previous: Around The World, Part 27: Planting trees",

    "title": "Ukraine says its small propeller battle drones can now go faster than Formula 1 cars",
    "description": "Mykhailo Fedorov said the drone was powered by a motor built in Ukraine. Its reported speed nearly rivals the fastest high-speed trains in the world.",
    "fullText": "A small Ukrainian drone built to chase down and intercept other aerial systems has recently achieved a speed of 400 kmph, or 248.5 mph, Kyiv's digital transformation minister said on Tuesday.\n\n\"400 km/h — that's the speed reached by an interceptor drone powered by a motor from Motor-G, a member of Brave1UA,\" Mykhailo Fedorov wrote in a social media post. Brave1 is Ukraine's defense innovation platform.\n\nSuch a velocity means that the interceptor can beat the official speed record for Formula 1 racing, achieved by Valtteri Bottas in 2016 at 231.46 mph.\n\nA speed of 248.5 mph also allows the drone to nearly match the fastest high-speed trains in the world. The Shanghai Maglev, for example, reached speeds of 280 mph during tests in October, but is commercially operated at 186 mph.\n\nAnd a motor-powered interceptor would be doing so with propellers, rather than the jet engines or high-thrust combustion systems that propel other vehicles to extreme speeds. Because interceptor drones are designed to destroy other drones at a low cost, Ukraine's manufacturers typically price them below $6,000 each.\n\nIt's another sign of how quickly the war is transforming the local weapons industry, which has turned hobbyist drones into some of the fastest yet cheapest aircraft on the battlefield. Four months ago, another Ukrainian interceptor drew widespread attention for reaching 195 mph in flight.\n\nUkraine is now ramping up ambitions to export such war technology, saying that its locally built missiles, drones, and anti-air systems have been tried and tested against Russia.\n\nA video posted by Fedorov on Tuesday said that producing drone motors in Ukraine \"seemed impossible\" just two years ago, but that Motor-G is now making 100,000 motors a month.\n\n\"Today, more and more drones are flying on motors made in Ukraine,\" the minister wrote.\n\nKyiv has been particularly focused on increasing the speed of its interceptors because Russia has been developing its own versions of the Iranian Shahed, which are long-range attack drones.\n\nThe most commonly used models of these loitering munitions fly at roughly 115 to 180 mph, and are often released in large numbers to overwhelm Ukrainian air defenses. The Russian tactic created the urgent need for Ukraine to develop cheap ways to destroy the Shaheds, which led to the rise of interceptor drones.\n\nHowever, Moscow has been repeatedly reported to be experimenting with smaller waves of new jet-powered Shaheds, which are believed to reach speeds of 230 mph.\n\nTheir emergence at the start of the year initially sparked fears in Ukraine that they would be too fast for interceptors to catch, though recent reports and war footage indicate that Ukrainian manufacturers have managed to close the gap.\n\nOne jet-powered Shahed, for example, was filmed being approached by a Ukrainian interceptor from behind in late November.",

For some, that desire has grown stronger in recent months, thanks to high valuations in the tech sector and growing concerns about a potential AI bubble.\n\n\"Because international stocks make up a significant portion of the available equity market, it makes sense for most investors to have some exposure to international stocks,\" Amy Arnott, a portfolio strategist at Morningstar, said in a statement.\n\nThe investment research firm said it compiled a list of top international equity funds and ETFs for investors to consider, screening for funds with the lowest-cost primary share classes that had a gold Morningstar Medalist Rating. The funds that were highlighted also had 100% analyst coverage, meaning they were unilaterally rated as a \"Buy,\" and had at least $100 million in assets.\n\nHere are the funds that topped Morningstar's list, ordered from lowest to highest expense ratio.",

    "title": "Some of SHRM's largest affiliates stress independence after $11.5 million discrimination verdict",
    "description": "Affiliates of the world's largest HR trade group reaffirmed their independence in the wake of a discrimination judgment.",
    "fullText": "Some of the largest affiliates of the Society for Human Resource Management have publicly reaffirmed their operational independence from the trade group after it lost an employee-discrimination lawsuit in a $11.5 million verdict.\n\nBusiness Insider identified LinkedIn posts from 10 US affiliates that reference the case that led to the so-called \"nuclear\" verdict on Dec. 5. That includes SHRM's largest affiliate, in Southern California, which has roughly 3,500 members. All the posts stress how the groups operate independently from SHRM international, which is based in Virginia.\n\n\"While we are an affiliated chapter of SHRM, we are not governed by SHRM's management, and we were not involved in this case,\" said New York City SHRM.\n\n\"We have our own bylaws, board, finances, programming, and strategic priorities,\" wrote Chicago SHRM.\n\nNYC SHRM and Chicago SHRM say they have around 1,400 and 1,000 members, respectively.\n\nSimilar statements were posted on LinkedIn by SHRM affiliates in the northeastern US, Texas, Oregon, Illinois, and California. The vast majority of affiliates have not publicly commented on the legal situation.\n\nSHRM says it has 556 chapters worldwide. The organization sends some funds to its chapters, which may encourage local members to get certified and may also require members to pay dues to the international organization. Chapters are one kind of affiliate; state councils, of which there are 51, are another.\n\nThe organization said in response to Business Insider's questions that the independence of its affiliates \"has always been the case.\"\n\n\"We actually make a point of reminding our chapters and state councils that they are separate legal entities and make their own operational decisions,\" SHRM representative Eddie Burke said in an email. He didn't respond to questions about the substance of the posts.\n\nThe lawsuit that SHRM lost earlier this month was filed in 2022 by Rehab Mohamed, an Egyptian woman who worked at the association as an instructional designer from 2016 until 2020. She said in her complaint that she was racially discriminated against by a white supervisor and faced retaliation for complaining to management.\n\nA Colorado federal jury found SHRM liable on both fronts. The association was hit with $1.5 million in compensatory damages and $10 million for punitive damages. SHRM has said it plans to file an appeal and that the jury's decision \"does not reflect the facts, the law, or the truth of how\" it operates.\n\nJane Billbe, president of Washington State SHRM, told Business Insider in an email that its post \"was intended to provide clarity for our members and stakeholders — not to distance ourselves from SHRM.\"\n\nThe California affiliate, the Professionals In Human Resources Association, wrote on LinkedIn that its code of ethics requires \"that everyone involved with PIHRA act with integrity, comply with applicable laws, and treat others with dignity and respect, free from discrimination, harassment, or retaliation.\"\n\nRafael Rivera, the affiliate's CEO since 2010, told Business Insider that he couldn't recall ever issuing a statement like it and believed some of his group's members were unaware of the distinction between the affiliate and main branch, or that SHRM had just lost an employee-discrimination case.\n\n\"The intent is to inform our audience that may not have the information,\" he said. \"They may assume that we're one and the same.\"\n\nIt's not the first time SHRM and its chapters haven't seen eye-to-eye. In 2016, SHRM sued a Northern California chapter for planning to hold its \"HR West\" event out of state without buy-in from SHRM chapters covering the cities where the event was to be held. The suit was dropped after the judge suggested that the agreement between the two parties wasn't as airtight as SHRM had asserted.\n\nBurke, the SHRM spokesperson, said that chapter \"is no longer part of our affiliated network.\"\n\nSome of the SHRM affiliates that posted on LinkedIn after the recent verdict wrote that they were speaking out because they'd been receiving inquiries from members concerned about the lawsuit and their affiliate's relationship to SHRM international. Some chapters require their members to also be members of SHRM, which increased its annual fee by 13% earlier this year, to $299. Burke said SHRM wouldn't be increasing dues this year.\n\nIn addition to membership, SHRM sells access to HR educational materials and credentialing programs, and bills itself as \"the foremost expert, researcher, advocate, and thought leader on issues and innovations impacting today's evolving workplaces.\"\n\nAhead of the trial, SHRM made an unsuccessful bid to have the plaintiff's lawyers barred from portraying it as a specialist in HR best practices. During the proceedings, the plaintiff argued that SHRM botched its own HR investigation into Mohamed's accusations of discrimination and retaliation.\n\nOne SHRM affiliate, DallasHR, said in its statement on LinkedIn that the verdict underscored the need for HR professionals to support and learn from one another.\n\n\"This is a validation of one of the core reasons DallasHR exists,\" the group said. \"Too often we assume in our organizations we are 'all trained up' and 'that would never happen here.' But none of us should rest on yesterday's knowledge.\"",

The answer I believe is OpenAI,\" wrote Osborne, who ran the UK Treasury from 2010 to 2016, in a Tuesday X post confirming the move.\n\nOsborne takes the role of managing director and head of OpenAI for Countries, an initiative launched by the AI startup in May that will see OpenAI partner with nations to build data centers and expand its $500 billion Stargate project beyond the US.\n\nThe former finance minister, who was a member of parliament in the right-leaning Conservative party until 2017, is the latest ex-British political heavyweight to join a US tech firm.\n\nRishi Sunak, the former UK prime minister, took on roles at OpenAI rival Anthropic and Microsoft as an advisor in October, while ex-deputy prime minister Nick Clegg worked as a senior executive on Meta's global affairs team from 2018 until stepping down at the start of 2025.\n\nBritish political salaries are dwarfed by the earnings of even midlevel employees at US tech companies. British prime ministers earn an annual salary of around £174,000 ($232,000), while salaries for research engineers at Meta can be as high as $400,000.\n\nOsborne's arrival comes as OpenAI continues to bulk up its executive ranks. The AI startup hired former Instacart and Meta exec Fidji Simo as its new CEO of applications in May, and this week hired veteran Google executive Albert Lee to lead its mergers and acquisitions team.",

    "description": "In an era where international talent is at an all-time high, it might be hard to believe that it’s only been just over two decades since Utah’s Andrew Bogut became the first foreign-born winner of the John R. Wooden Award.",
    "fullText": "The John R. Wooden Award will celebrate it's 50th anniversary this season. Leading up to the award ceremony on April 10, 2026, The Sporting Tribune in partnership with the Wooden Award and the Los Angeles Athletic Club will highlight past winners of the Wooden Award and the Legends of Coaching Award.\n\nIn an era where international talent is at an all-time high, it might be hard to believe that it’s only been just over two decades since Utah’s Andrew Bogut became the first foreign-born winner of the John R. Wooden Award.\n\nBogut’s 2004-05 sophomore campaign with the Utes placed him into an exclusive club of college basketball history, as he led the program to the Sweet 16 in the years immediately after longtime head coach and program builder Rick Majerus left the program and received consensus national player of the year honors as a result.\n\nIn the Utes’ first season under Ray Giacolletti, Bogut averaged 20.5 points and 12.2 rebounds per game to lead the team to a 25-4 regular season record overall, with a 13-1 mark in Mountain West play. Bogut’s most impressive outing of the season was a 31-point, 13-rebound clinic in a 71-62 conference win over Wyoming on Valentine’s Day, where he made 11-of-16 attempts from the field.\n\nThe Utes would eventually fall to New Mexico in the 2005 Mountain West championship game, but still received a No. 6 seed in the NCAA Tournament as an at-large. Bogut continued his dominance in the first round of March Madness, pouring in 24 points on 9-of-13 shooting to lead Utah over a feisty No. 11 seed in UTEP before beating No. 3 seed Oklahoma in the Round of 32.\n\nIn the days after Bogut’s college career ended with a loss to Kentucky in the 2005 Sweet 16, he was awarded the Wooden Award with a decisive finish in the voting ahead of Duke’s JJ Redick and Illinois’ Dee Brown. Being from Australia, Bogut wasn’t too familiar with Coach Wooden’s legacy when he won the award but he still cherished the honor all the same.\n\n\"I'd heard the name before. College basketball isn't very big in Australia,\" Bogut told the Associated Press after winning the award in 2005. \"He's a legendary coach -- one of the best of all-time … It's very special just to have my name engraved on that trophy with the likes of Larry Bird, Michael Jordan and Tim Duncan.”\n\nBogut joined another very exclusive club in basketball history a few months later, as the Milwaukee Bucks selected him with the No. 1 overall pick in the 2005 NBA Draft. Bogut played 14 seasons in the NBA, winning a championship with the Golden State Warriors in 2015 in addition to earning third-team All-NBA honors with the Bucks in 2010.",

It will also partner with tech companies to recommend early career managers to take a leave of absence from their private-sector roles to join the Tech Force.\n\n“If you’re thinking about, long term, a career in technology, there is no bigger and more complex set of problems than we face in the federal government,” Kupor said in a call with reporters ahead of the program’s announcement Monday.\n\nThe Trump administration has sought to implement AI to modernize and make more efficient systems across the federal government, including with the controversial Department of Government Efficiency. That effort, launched under Elon Musk earlier this year, is no longer operating as a “centralized” organization, officials said last month.\n\nPresident Donald Trump in July also signed an AI action plan, a set of initiatives and policy recommendations that centered on growing US AI infrastructure and scaling back regulation to promote US competitiveness.\n\nMembers of the new US Tech Force will work directly for individual agencies on projects determined by agency leadership. OPM will conduct an initial review and technical assessment of applicants and recommend approved candidates to agencies for final interviews and hiring decisions.\n\nApplications open Monday, and OPM hopes to have most members of the first cohort placed in roles within the first quarter of 2026.\n\nMembers of the Tech Force are expected to work on projects such as incorporating advanced AI into drones and other weapons at the Department of Defense, building out the Trump Accounts platform at the Internal Revenue Service, and using AI to improve intelligence at the State Department, among other initiatives, according to Kupor.\n\nThroughout the two-year program, OPM plans to bring in Silicon Valley CEOs and other executives for speaker events. It will also partner with around 25 tech companies to provide mentorship and career planning advice to members of the cohort. Microsoft, Adobe, Amazon, Meta and xAI are among the companies that have signed on as partners of the program.\n\nThe program will conclude with a job fair, where program members will have access to both public- and private-sector opportunities. Salaries for members of the Tech Force are expected to range from approximately $130,000 to $195,000.\n\n“There is an incredible race for talent in these areas … so part of what we want to do is be competitive on compensation,” Kupor said. He added that he wanted potential applicants to “understand that in doing this, they’re going to learn a bunch, they’re going to tackle really complex problems, and then they can ultimately go back to the private sector, if that’s what they want to do, and certainly will have the opportunity to maximize their financial opportunity as a result.”",

    "fullText": "Global macro analyst Luke Gromen, long known for his bullish stance on Bitcoin (BTC) as a hedge against fiat debasement, has adopted a more cautious outlook for the near term.\n\nSpeaking during a recent podcast appearance, Gromen warned that the asset could fall toward the $40,000 range.\n\nDuring the podcast, Gromen stressed that his broader investment thesis has not changed.\n\nHe continues to believe that long-term currency debasement will push investors toward scarce assets such as gold and Bitcoin.\n\nDollar debasement is the decline in the U.S. dollar’s purchasing power due to expanding money supply, inflation, or excessive government debt. This prompts investors to seek scarce assets like Bitcoin (BTC) or gold as protection.\n\nHowever, he now argues that gold and select equities may offer a cleaner expression of that trade than Bitcoin in the coming years.\n\n“Basically everything but gold and the dollar are likely to get waylaid,” Gromen said.\n\nGromen pointed to Bitcoin’s failure to make new highs relative to gold as a key warning sign. The absence of that breakout, he argued, suggests Bitcoin’s risk-reward profile has deteriorated.\n\nTreasury Secretary Bessent to propose major changes that could reshape crypto regulation\n\nAnalyst warns Fed’s $40B monthly Treasury buys could reprice crypto\n\nTeachers union warns new bill could put retirement savings at risk\n\nHe also highlighted a break below key long-term technical levels.\n\nAccording to Gromen, similar technical breakdowns in the recent past were followed by drawdowns, raising concerns that Bitcoin could face a deeper correction if history repeats.\n\n“When these technicals broke, each of the last three times, the median decline in Bitcoin was 65%–70% each time,” he said.\n\n\"The size it had grown in my portfolio, to me it just spoke to me a need to right-size it and substantially reduce positions. Because I think it's going a lot lower.\"\n\nAnother factor weighing on sentiment, according to Gromen, is the growing discussion around quantum computing risks. While most crypto traders consider it as a distant threat to Bitcoin’s cryptography, the topic has gained traction among investors.\n\nGromen suggested that large holders who have accumulated Bitcoin over the past decade may be increasingly inclined to hedge or trim exposure as the narrative gains visibility.\n\n“If I thought quantum was a risk I wanted to at least hedge somewhat, I would start to take some off the table,” he said, pointing to what he perceives as whale selling alongside weak price action.",

    "fullText": "The 1970s gave us muscle cars, oil crises, and some truly wild automotive experiments. While everyone's chasing Camaros and Corvettes at auctions, there's a whole world of fascinating machines from that decade that fly under the radar.\n\nThese overlooked cars offer character, quirky engineering, and surprisingly solid performance without the six-figure price tags. Some were ahead of their time, others were wonderfully weird, and a few were just plain misunderstood.\n\nAlright, time to check out these gems from the '70s that deserve more love from collectors.\n\nThe Gremlin gets mocked for its chopped-off rear end, but this little oddball was actually pretty clever. AMC created it by literally cutting down a Hornet to compete in the subcompact market, and it worked.\n\nWith optional V8 power, the Gremlin could surprise unsuspecting muscle cars at stoplights, and its quirky styling has aged into legitimate charm. You could get one with a 304 cubic inch V8 that made around 150 horsepower, which was respectable for the era.\n\nWhile collectors chase AMX models, clean Gremlins remain affordable and are starting to earn respect as honest, unpretentious American compacts.\n\nThe wedge-shaped TR7 was supposed to be Triumph's answer to modern sports car design, and while it had production issues, the driving experience was genuinely fun. Its \"wedge\" design was polarizing, earning the tagline \"The Shape of Things to Come,\" though reliability concerns overshadowed its decent handling.\n\nThe four-cylinder engine produced about 92 horsepower in North American spec, which sounds modest but kept the car nimble and engaging. Later TR8 models got a V8, but even the standard TR7 offers an accessible entry into British sports car ownership.\n\nThese days, you can find them for a fraction of what you'd pay for an MGB or Spitfire.\n\nBefore the 240Z became a collector darling, Datsun was building sensible sedans that happened to be incredibly well-engineered. The 710 was a reliable, practical sedan that competed with Toyota Corollas but somehow never achieved the same nostalgic status.\n\nIts 2.0-liter engine made around 94–97 horsepower (SAE net), depending on emissions spec and could reliably cruise all day without complaint. The wagon versions are particularly appealing today, offering classic lines and surprising cargo space.\n\nWhile collectors obsess over Z-cars, the humble 710 represents Datsun's commitment to quality without demanding classic car prices.\n\nSold through Mercury dealers, the Capri II was a captive import from Ford of Europe rather than a traditional American pony car. Built in Germany, it brought European hatchback styling and a more refined driving feel to the U.S. market at a time when domestic performance cars were shrinking.\n\nPower came from sensible options like the 2.3-liter four-cylinder or an optional 2.8-liter V6, prioritizing balance and fuel economy over straight-line speed.\n\nWhile it never tried to compete directly with muscle cars, the Capri II offered tidy handling, distinctive fastback styling, and a level of character that set it apart from its American contemporaries. Overshadowed by Mustangs and later fox-body Capris, the Capri II remains an overlooked slice of 1970s transatlantic automotive history.\n\nThis mid-engine, targa-topped Italian was designed by Bertone and offered sports car thrills in an affordable package. With just about 75 horsepower from its 1.5-liter engine, the X1/9 wasn't about straight-line speed but rather handling and driver engagement.\n\nThe mid-engine layout gave it phenomenal balance, making it a blast on twisty roads. Its removable roof panel predated the Miata's popularity by decades and offered open-air driving without sacrificing structural rigidity.\n\nWhile Fiat's rust reputation scared some buyers away, well-maintained examples prove that proper Italian sports cars don't need big price tags.\n\nThe Volaré replaced the beloved Valiant and initially suffered quality issues, but the platform itself was quite capable. Once Chrysler sorted out the early problems, these became solid, dependable cars with comfortable rides.\n\nYou could option them with everything from slant-six engines to 360 cubic inch V8s making around 160–170 horsepower (SAE net), depending on year/trim. The Road Runner package added some muscle car DNA to a practical body, creating an interesting sleeper.\n\nEarlier Mopars often get all the love, but clean examples represent affordable entry into Chrysler performance heritage.\n\nBefore Subaru became synonymous with crossovers, they built a compact pickup truck with rear-facing jump seats in the bed. The BRAT (Bi-drive Recreational All-terrain Transporter) cleverly avoided the chicken tax by including those seats, classifying it as a passenger vehicle.\n\nIts four-wheel drive system was ahead of its time for a small truck, and the about 67 horsepower from its flat-four engine was adequate for the lightweight body. The quirky design and practical utility made it perfect for outdoor enthusiasts.\n\nToday, rust-free BRATs are increasingly hard to find, but they remain much more affordable than vintage Toyota trucks.\n\nThe Alfetta brought Italian performance engineering to the sedan market with its unique transaxle layout for perfect weight distribution. Named after Alfa's successful racing cars, it featured a rear-mounted transmission that helped achieve 50/50 balance.\n\nThe four-cylinder engine produced around 109-130 PS but delivered smooth power and that distinctive Alfa character. Its handling was exceptional for a sedan, rewarding drivers who appreciated precise steering and responsive chassis dynamics.\n\nWhile collectors chase Spiders and GTVs, the Alfetta sedan offers genuine Alfa driving pleasure without the premium prices.\n\nThe Vega had serious quality issues at launch, but the GT version with its sport suspension and styling upgrades was actually entertaining to drive. Its aluminum-block four-cylinder was innovative if flawed, producing around 85 horsepower (SAE net) in typical mid-’70s GT spec (varies by year/engine option).\n\nThe lightweight body and decent handling made it competitive in autocross and club racing. Many enthusiasts have discovered that dropping in a small-block V8 turns the Vega into a genuine pocket rocket.\n\nSure, the reputation keeps values low, but that means more opportunity for builders and drivers who want an affordable project.\n\nFrench engineering excellence doesn't get enough credit in American collector circles, and the 504 proves that point beautifully. This sedan won European Car of the Year and featured independent suspension, comfortable seating, and surprisingly robust construction.\n\nThe fuel-injected four-cylinder made around 96 horsepower but delivered smooth, refined power delivery. Its ride quality was exceptional, combining European handling with comfortable long-distance cruising.\n\nWhile Citroëns get the quirky attention, the 504 represents practical French design that actually worked reliably in American conditions.\n\nBefore the RX-7 became a rotary icon, Mazda built the smaller RX-3 with the same spinning triangle magic. U.S.-market RX-3s used the larger 12A rotary, with published outputs closer to about 90 horsepower in North American spec; the engine’s willingness to rev was a big part of the appeal.\n\nRacing versions dominated their classes in IMSA competition, proving the chassis was more than just economical transportation. The coupe and wagon versions offer distinctive styling that stands out from typical Japanese offerings.\n\nCollectors focus on RX-7s and leave these earlier rotaries as affordable alternatives with genuine motorsport heritage.\n\nVolvo built a reputation on safety and practicality, but the 242 GT showed they understood driving dynamics too. This special edition featured unique aerodynamic bodywork, sport suspension, and distinctive alloy wheels.\n\nThe fuel-injected four-cylinder produced around produced about 123 hp in fuel-injected B21E form (outputs varied by market and rating standard) and delivered surprisingly spirited performance. Its handling was sharp for a Volvo, rewarding drivers who pushed it through corners.\n\nWhile 240-series cars are common, finding a genuine GT with its special equipment is increasingly difficult, yet they remain affordable compared to BMW 2002s.\n\nThese twelve overlooked machines from the 1970s prove that collector appeal isn't always about what's most expensive or most famous. Each offers something special, whether it's innovative engineering, quirky charm, or genuine driving pleasure that got overshadowed by flashier contemporaries. The best part about exploring these forgotten gems is that you can actually afford to buy one, drive it, and enjoy it without worrying about depreciation or astronomical restoration costs. As the collector car market continues evolving, smart enthusiasts are discovering that sometimes the most rewarding classics are the ones everyone else walked past.",

    "fullText": "Our Delta One tickets got us access to the expansive Delta Sky Club at LAX.\n\nAlong with two large buffet areas and a bar, the space had many comfortable seating zones and private bathrooms with showers.\n\nIt was fun having so many complimentary food options — including vegan ones — but we tried not to overdo it as we had already pre-selected meals for our flight.\n\nWhen it was time to board the plane, we walked over to our gate and were among the first passengers welcomed.\n\nAs we settled into our seats, the friendly flight attendants offered us drinks and snacks right away.\n\nSince the plane had a staggered layout and my husband and I both wanted window seats, my \"suite\" was one row behind his.\n\nThat meant we couldn't hold hands, as we usually do, during takeoff. But rather than feeling nervous, I felt safely cocooned in my personal space.\n\nThe suite had a door to slide shut for privacy and side buttons for adjusting the seat's angle and lighting.\n\nThe blanket and pillow were cozy, and the travel kit had some useful amenities, like slippers, lip balm, hand cream, and an eye mask.\n\nI was hoping for a pair of pajamas, but those weren't offered on our 8 p.m. flight.\n\nOnce we leveled off, I was able to fully recline in the Delta One lie-flat seats. It was such a relief.\n\nMore than anything, the ability to lie down flat made the biggest difference in how much I enjoyed the long flight.\n\nI was even able to fall asleep off and on — something I'm never able to do on a plane\n\nUnlike me, my husband doesn't mind flying — he just doesn't like the lack of space on most plane seats. At over 6 feet tall with a burly build and size-14 shoes, he's always hoping for more legroom.\n\nFortunately, the Delta One suite delivered with its roomy seat and foot cubby.\n\nMy husband was so comfortable that he didn't even bother taking off his shoes or fully reclining during the entire flight.\n\nOur overnight flight included a three-course dinner and next-day breakfast, plus plenty of snacks and drinks.\n\nWe had ordered vegan options and were pleasantly surprised at how tasty the food was, from grain bowls to salads to plates with hummus and veggies.\n\nThe retractable table I ate on felt roomy and sturdy, and eating with real silverware, porcelain dishes, and cloth napkins elevated the experience.\n\nWatching TV on the nicely sized screen in front of me helped me forget I was in a flying metal tube thousands of feet above the ground.\n\nThough Delta offered plenty of new movies and shows for me to stream, I ended up turning to old favorites like \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" and listening to soothing music.\n\nMeanwhile, my husband was rocking out to a famous Bruce Springsteen concert from 1979.\n\nAll in all, our pricey flight was so enjoyable that I almost wished it lasted longer.\n\nWhen we landed at Heathrow Airport the following afternoon, we didn't even have jet lag. We just felt ready to take on the day.\n\nSplurging isn't always possible, but we're keeping our options open for future flights. As they say, it's not about the destination, it's about the journey.",

    "title": "Meet the world's 5th-richest person: Oracle founder Larry Ellison's net worth hit massive highs and lows in 2025",
    "description": "Meet Larry Ellison, the world's fifth-richest man. He cofounded Oracle in 1977 and is still one of Silicon Valley's top dogs.",
    "fullText": "Larry Ellison is the founder and chief technology officer of the software giant Oracle.\n\nNow, he's also the world's fifth-wealthiest man, with a net worth of $238 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nEllison's 2025 was marked by big financial gains and losses. Ellison briefly claimed the title of the world's richest person when his net worth soared to $393 billion that September. Oracle shares surged after the company reported quarterly results and delivered a blockbuster outlook for its AI-powered cloud business. Later that month, his wealth had nearly doubled during the year.\n\nHowever, his fortune took a $25 billion hit toward the end of 2025 after Oracle's shares fell by more than 11% based on weaker-than-expected earnings results. December 12 marked one of the largest single-day drops in net worth this year. Tesla chief Elon Musk then resumed his place as the world's wealthiest man.\n\nOracle, like other tech giants, is betting big on artificial intelligence, and Ellison is leading the charge at the company. His latest focus is on building data centers for companies such as OpenAI.\n\nEllison started Oracle in 1977. Decades later, despite living in Hawaii, he's still one of the top dogs in Silicon Valley.\n\nHere's a look at Ellison's life and career so far.\n\nEllison was born in the Bronx on August 17, 1944, to a single mother, Florence Spellman. Raised in Chicago's South Side, he attended the University of Illinois but dropped out after his adoptive mother died. He later attended the University of Chicago for a semester, but also dropped out.\n\nIn 1966, at the age of 22, he moved to Berkeley, California, near the emerging tech hub of Silicon Valley. He worked a series of jobs, including at Wells Fargo and mainframe maker Amdahl, where he picked up programming skills.\n\nOracle was founded in 1977 with $2,000, inspired by IBM scientist Edgar F. Codd's revolutionary idea of relational databases. Its first product was dubbed Version 2. After briefly rebranding as Relational Software Inc., the company became Oracle Systems in 1982 and went public in 1986 with $55 million in revenue.\n\nGrowth was rapid, but in 1990, Oracle nearly went bankrupt after revenue miscalculations led to losses and layoffs. By 1992, the launch of Oracle7 put the company back on track. Throughout the '90s, Oracle sparred with rivals like Informix and benefited from the dot-com boom, supplying databases to countless startups.\n\nFlush with cash, Oracle went on an acquisition spree, buying PeopleSoft for $10.3 billion in 2005 and Sun Microsystems in 2010, gaining control of key technologies like MySQL. That same year, Ellison recruited Mark Hurd alongside Safra Catz, who later became co-CEOs.\n\nEllison stepped down as CEO in 2014, assuming the roles of chairman and chief technology officer.\n\nEllison, Oracle's largest shareholder, has used his fortune to fuel a life of high-profile investments, philanthropy, and headline-making purchases.\n\nHe races yachts, sails, and partially financed the BMW Oracle USA team that won the 2010 America's Cup.\n\nHe has also built a collection of Richard Mille watches worth hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars each. In 2009, he purchased the Indian Wells tennis tournament for $100 million.\n\nIn 2012, he bought 98% of the Hawaiian island of Lanai, where he later moved full-time, developing real estate and a wellness retreat, and backing a farming startup. His real estate portfolio also includes mansions in Malibu, Palm Beach, and Rhode Island.\n\nHe has been an active investor for a long time. An early backer of Salesforce, he also invested in Leapfrog and the ill-fated Theranos.\n\nOne of his most lucrative bets was NetSuite: A $125 million stake in 1998 turned into a $3.5 billion windfall when Oracle acquired the company in 2016.\n\nEllison also served on Apple's board in the late 1990s and joined Tesla's board in 2018 before stepping down in 2022.\n\nEllison's daughter, Megan, is an Oscar-nominated film producer and the founder of Annapurna Pictures. The company has produced films like \"Zero Dark Thirty\" and \"American Hustle.\"\n\nEllison's son, David, is also in the film business. His company, Skydance Media, has produced movies like \"Terminator: Dark Fate\" and films in the \"Mission: Impossible\" franchise.\n\nAfter months of discussions in 2024, Skydance Media and Paramount agreed to a deal, which created Paramount Skydance. David is the CEO. Ellison and David, who own a controlling stake in Paramount and were outbid by Netflix for Warner Bros. Discovery, launched a hostile $30-per-share offer for all of WBD in December 2025.\n\nParamount Skydance oversees Paramount Pictures, the streaming services Paramount+ and Pluto TV, as well as CBS and cable networks, including Comedy Central and MTV.\n\nEllison signed the Giving Pledge in 2010, vowing to give away 95% of his fortune.\n\nHe has donated millions, including $200 million to a USC cancer center in 2016, which was eventually renamed the Ellison Institute of Technology. The EIT announced an Oxford campus in 2023.\n\nHe's also been visible during Donald Trump's second term as president.\n\nEllison appeared alongside Sam Altman of OpenAI and Masayoshi Son of SoftBank at Trump's press conference the day after the president's inauguration in January 2024 to announce Project Stargate, a joint venture that would see up to $500 billion investment in AI infrastructure in the US.\n\n\"He's sort of CEO of everything. He's an amazing man,\" Trump said as he introduced Ellison, who is seen as his longtime ally.",

They are requested to ensure that these tickets are specifically allocated to loyal fans who are closely connected to their national teams.\n\n\"In total, 50% of each PMA allocation will fall within the most affordable range, namely supporter value tier (40%) and the supporter entry tier (10%). The remaining allocation is split evenly between the supporter standard tier and the supporter premier tier.\"\n\nFor England and Scotland, this will mean about 400 tickets will be available for £45 for their group matches.",

    "fullText": "PDC World Darts Championship: Glen Durrant - Price can rival the two Lukes originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nYou might be forgiven for thinking all the conversation in the run up the PDC World Championship has been about the two Lukes: Littler and Humphries and to a large extent you would be correct. There are other names that some fancy to test the most recent two World Champions.\n\nWhen Darts World talked to Glen Durrant, three-time Lakeside (WDF) champion and winner of the PDC's Premier League, he agreed that at least one other player should be in the mix:\n\nLet's talk about Gerwyn Price - can he keep up with the two Lukes and compete?\n\nHe can absolutely still cut it at the top of the sport. His A game is as good as any player in the world right now. He’s super fit, so fatigue isn’t coming into it. I’d like to see him be 3-0 down in a match and come back to win it 4-3.\n\nIt’s almost like he needs that great match early doors to get his belief back. He had that at the World Matchplay where he seemed to be 5-0 down after the first break, but it’s part of his game now, to know he can come back from the jaws of defeat. The only thing I think Gerwyn Price needs is to show that resilience. He needs to show that grit. But right now, he can be as good as anybody when he is at the top of his game.\n\nTHE PDC WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP IN FACTS AND FIGURES: Arm yourself on dartsdatabase.co.uk\n\nIs his 11 world ranking representative of how good he is or do you think he should be higher than that?\n\nHe’s at No. 3 in the world in my eyes. I think the two Lukes are just a little bit ahead of him. There are some great players around at the moment. Stephen Bunting looks like he’s just searching for that little bit extra at the moment. James Wade has had an unbelievable season so far. If I had to give you my top 10 right now, Price would definitely be at three.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS! Gerwyn Price wins PDC World Darts Championship\n\nPrice v Littler. If it were to happen, if those guys were to meet in the quarterfinals, would that be one of the best quarterfinals of all time?\n\nI’ve done the draw, done the little league table, the fantasy of how it plays out. I’ve got it down that they will meet in the quarter-finals, that seems like a match-up we can anticipate.\n\nThere have been some epic games at Alexandra Palace. Sometimes as a commentator you get to watch some mouthwatering ties, and I think that this is a tie that would excite the players, but the crowd would love it too. It’s what we want.\n\nI think it’ll happen, I think they are the two standout players in that section, and I think it’s going to be an absolute belter.\n\nGLEN DURRANT WINS PREMIER LEAGUE: Watch Duzza's 2020 Moment of triumph\n\nAs a former player turned pundit Glen also look for value in the betting market and was talking via 10Bet . Does he see one of those fairytale runs that Ally Pally is famous for happening this year:\n\nBack to the PDC World Championships. Who could rattle a few cages?\n\n“I don't really think it's been the year of the underdog with the domination of the two Lukes. I've struggled to get value for people. You know, I'll give you a couple of names here:\n\n“ I think Martin Schindler can go on and run this year. I think Jermaine Wattamina is in the form of his life. I think there's a couple of young players too who could do well like Van Veen and Manby. I'm a big fan of the North American scene. Adam Savada, etc... . But I don't see them going deep because the elite players just look so good.\n\n“Also, I don't see, for example, a Scott Williams reaching the semi-final like a couple of years ago. I think the cream will rise to the top.\n\n\" So looking up and down the draw, I mean, as we said, you think the top eight could potentially be your quarter-final, and there's every reason why we can say that.\n\n“ Everyone's writing off Rob Cross… at 175 to 1. Rob Cross is not a 175 to 1 shot. I hope he finds his form there.\n\n“It's intriguing. It's exciting. It's going to be the place to be. It's what everyone's going to be watching. And if seeds go, then great. But I'd be surprised if we don't see one of those real top elite players picking up that million quid.”\n\nGet \n\nDarts World subscriptions options include Print, Digital and All Access packages, as well as exclusive products and competitions",

    "description": "WORLD CUP 2026: Comment: Fifa’s extortionate prices have led to accusations of ‘betrayal’ and Miguel Delaney argues that The FA must flex its power now to save fans and potentially enhance England’s chances on the pitch",
    "fullText": "The Fifa leadership travel to Doha on Monday, for a series of meetings around “The Best” awards, where certain sources are anticipating at least some tension. And not over who wins.\n\nA number of national associations remain aggravated by the astronomical World Cup 2026 ticket prices, and want to directly raise it. The Football Association says it will relay fan concerns to Fifa, but the Football Supporters’ Association expects more. They expect the FA to actually push on this, and display proper support.\n\nIf it doesn’t, there will be uproar and potential escalation of the latest controversy surrounding Fifa and the World Cup.\n\nThe story should already be bringing much more scrutiny on the conduct of the FA – and other major federations – in football’s power structure.\n\nSources within such federations generally insist that they must maintain a diplomatic stance when dealing with the top brass of Fifa and Uefa, due to the risk of political ostracisation, given that both federations are top-down executive president models with little scope for dissent.\n\nSo, they generally say very little that is challenging, as they attempt to keep some influence.\n\nExcept, what is the point of any of that if you say nothing and have absolutely no influence when it matters most?\n\nThe FA’s first obligation, after all, is to the football public of England. To its constituents.\n\nYou may as well be politically ostracised if you can’t serve them in something like this.\n\nAnd what is going to happen anyway? It’s not like Fifa or Uefa are going to cut off Forward or HatTrick funding.\n\nBoth federations absolutely love Wembley, knowing how much more lucrative it is than any other European stadium. That means little to no risk of losing major fixtures.\n\nFA lobbyists may point to the bid for the Fifa Women’s World Cup 2035, but there’s no competition there.\n\nAnd, in any case, do they really have a mandate to secure a tournament at any cost – like that to their fans?\n\nThe refusal to publicly speak on this would be utterly spineless.\n\nSuch an approach is all the more surprising right now, given that there is constant tension between football’s various stakeholders – from the Premier League to European Football Clubs (the new name for the European Club Association) – and you need sharp elbows to secure your space in the calendar. You need a sense of fight.\n\nMany of those same stakeholders often declare themselves shocked at the meekness of the major federations, from the FA to the associations of France, Germany and Spain. There’s a feeling that they absolutely waste their potential power, and that they should be moral guardians of the game.\n\nInstead, various sources describe them as “the most complicit in the preservation of football’s system” due to the refusal to flex their greater muscle and, worse, “patsies”.\n\nFifa and Uefa have allowed the game to be taken over by greater power, with virtually no challenge. And this has far greater future risks.\n\nThe great frustration with this ticket crisis – even though you could have said this about any of Fifa’s controversies over the last few weeks – is that a potential outlet for dissent is so obvious and powerful.\n\nIf the 10-15 wealthiest federations coordinated action, or even put out a joint statement, it would “rattle” Fifa president Gianni Infantino on this, according to insiders. It would be dissent he is not used to.\n\nSo simple, so potentially effective in this controversy.\n\nIf Fifa still doesn’t budge on prices, and a position in this patronage system is apparently so valuable to the federations, there is another option.\n\nThe national associations can use the ample money they receive from Fifa and Uefa to subsidise the tickets of regular match-going fans.\n\nMany of the latter are already talking of having to make very hard decisions on whether to attend next summer’s tournament. It could be reasonably argued that full support is all the more valuable, given that this looks like England’s best chance of winning a World Cup in decades.\n\nBut, really, there is something deeper here.\n\nThere is a moral and political argument.\n\nThe member associations, most of all the FA, should do much more for their constituents. As was reported on these pages on Saturday, FA chair Debbie Hewitt is ideally placed as Fifa chair.\n\n“I’m not known for being a silent observer,” she said on taking that role.\n\nThere’s never been a more important moment to prove that.",

    "fullText": "Copper prices have exploded to record highs again, not because the world is running out of the metal, but in part because the United States is scooping up so much of it that everyone else is scrambling for what's left.\n\nBenchmark three-month copper hit an all-time high of $11,952 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange on Friday. It's now trading around $11,655 per ton, up roughly 33% so far this year.\n\nThe US has been aggressively stockpiling metal ahead of potential tariffs, pulling huge volumes out of the tradable global system and tightening supplies everywhere else.\n\n\"US inventory is effectively 'trapped',\" analysts at Goldman Sachs wrote in a report on Tuesday.\n\nHowever, the global copper market is expected to post a 300,000-ton surplus next year.\n\nThe latest copper price surge caps a volatile year for the red metal used in construction, electrical grids, and electronics.\n\nEarly this year, traders rushed copper into the US in anticipation of President Donald Trump's steep import tariffs.\n\nBut months later, the administration unexpectedly excluded refined copper from those duties, leaving importers sitting on piles of metal.\n\nEven so, the market isn't convinced the reprieve will last.\n\nGoldman's analysts wrote that they now expect the White House to announce a refined copper tariff in the first half of 2026 for implementation in 2027. Such a delay would likely encourage further US stockpiling, as expectations of future tariffs keep domestic buyers pulling copper out of the global market.\n\nMeanwhile, the rest of the world faces a growing supply squeeze, with Goldman expecting a 450,000-ton deficit next year.\n\nFurthermore, the world's copper supply has been rattled by real disruptions.\n\nProduction setbacks at big miners in Indonesia, Congo, and Chile have squeezed output in recent months.\n\nThat dynamic has helped drive high copper premiums across the rest of the world.\n\n\"Producers plan to impose record premiums on European and Asian customers next year, effectively compensating for profits they could earn selling to the US,\" wrote Ewa Manthey, a commodities strategist at ING, last week.\n\nAdding to the upside pressure, speculation has flooded the market as traders are piling into positions tied to AI infrastructure and energy transition themes, treating the metal almost like a tech-linked asset.\n\nInvestors are piling into bets linked to data-center construction — a speculative trend Goldman's analysts warn has left prices open to a sharp reversal.\n\nThat makes copper vulnerable to any wobble in AI stocks, particularly if the hype around data center buildouts fades.\n\n\"The copper price rally in December is becoming highly speculative, which makes it vulnerable to a rapid reversal,\" wrote Goldman's analysts.\n\nGoldman's copper price forecast for 2026 is $11,400 per ton — lower than current levels.",

One proposal is to use some of the tens of billions of dollars in frozen Russian assets held in Europe.\n\n“The aggressor must pay,” Zelenskyy told the Dutch parliament earlier Tuesday.\n\nOn Monday, he attended peace talks in Berlin with U.S. President Donald Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff, Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz. Zelenskyy voiced readiness to drop his country’s bid to join NATO in exchange for Western security guarantees, but rejected the U.S. push for ceding territory to Russia.\n\n“These security guarantees are an opportunity to prevent another wave of Russian aggression,” he told journalists. “And this is already a compromise on our part.”\n\nThirty-five countries backed the International Claims Commission, but they now must ratify the treaty, a process which usually requires legislature approval. That level of support is unprecedented for the start of a Council of Europe treaty.\n\nThe commission will assess claims made to the already operational register of damages, which was launched during a Council of Europe summit in 2023. Some 80,000 claims have already been filed with the register, which is based in The Hague.\n\nEU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas told a press conference the bloc would give one million euros ($1.1 million) to finance the commission's operation. An estimated 3.5 million euros ($4.1 million) are needed overall.\n\nMany of the same countries have also backed a new international court, also under the umbrella of the Council of Europe, to prosecute senior Russian officials for the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",

    "fullText": "South Korea’s women added to the trophy cabinet twice in 2025, but underwhelming results in several international friendlies leave Shin Sangwoo and his squad with a point to prove at next year’s AFC Women’s Asian Cup.\n\nThe year started on a high note for the South Korean women’s national team with victory in February’s Pink Ladies Cup. Korea won all three of their matches and did so with a better goal difference than Russia to claim the title. Sure, it wasn’t the most glorious win, given the calibre of the teams involved and the status (or lack thereof) of the tournament itself, but it was a win nonetheless, and the squad returned from the UAE with a nice shiny platter to put in the KFA trophy cabinet.\n\nIn May, Shin Sangwoo’s warriors were off to Australia for a pair of friendlies against the hosts of next year’s AFC Women’s Asian Cup. Buoyed by large and enthusiastic home crowds, the Matildas proved tough opponents. The results — a 1-0 loss and a 2-0 loss — weren’t terrible, but did lay bare a weakness in Korea’s goalscoring department, the team’s inability to get across the line (or at least, to do so in the right goal) damaging their confidence.\n\nThere were two more friendlies in late spring, this time on home soil as Korea played host to Colombia. The first match in Incheon ended as a 1-0 loss; Korea did well to hold their own fast and physical opponents. Despite the frustrating lack of goals, the home fans were treated to a moment of elation as Kim Minjeong made a cracking save to deny Usme’s penalty. There was further joy a few days later in Yongin as Jung Minyoung finally put an end to the goal drought just two minutes into her international debut. An unfortunate own goal from Kim Jinhui brought the sides level before the final whistle, but on some level, the friendlies were a success. Manager Shin experimented with formations, and everyone in the squad got minutes on the pitch, with the exception of third goalkeeper Woo Seobin.\n\nIn July, South Korea hosted the EAFF E-1 Football Championship (East Asian Cup), with both men’s and women’s competitions happening in venues around Gyeonggi-do in what must have been a busy week for those guys who shake the giant Taegukgi. The tournament saw Korea’s women take on some of their toughest competitors in the region. Against China, the final score was 2-2; Ji Soyun’s dramatic injury-time equaliser earned her a nomination for the KFA’s goal of the year. Another late equaliser, this time from Jeong Dabin, made it 1-1 against fierce rivals Japan. As Japan and China faced each other on the final matchday, a win for either team would secure them the title, but yet another stalemate in that match opened the door for Korea to swoop in and claim the victory, which they did with an assured 2-0 victory over Chinese Taipei (Taiwan).\n\nThus, Korea’s women lifted the East Asian Cup for the first time in 20 years, proving in the process that they can still compete with the regional football powerhouses despite a relative lack of investment and development in the women’s game. More accuracy in front of goal could have helped deliver a more decisive victory, but a trophy is a trophy, not to mention a huge confidence booster.\n\nThere were no A matches in the October international window due to the National Sports Festival, the KFA electing to avoid clashes so that the squads of the eight WK League clubs wouldn’t be left depleted. The national team still made headlines in the autumn as it emerged that several players had demanded equal treatment with the men’s team, allegedly threatening to boycott A matches unless their conditions, including business class flights for international fixtures, were met. The news divided more reasonable fans and provided ammunition for keyboard warriors who seem to think that national pride would be better served by defunding and disbanding the women’s team than supporting the Taeguk Warriors in women’s competitions.\n\nIt remains unclear in which section of the plane the squad travelled for their latest excursion, a trip to Europe for friendlies against Wales and the Netherlands. Shin should have fancied his team’s chances in Malaga as they lined up against a Welsh team on an 11-match winless run (spoiler alert: now 12), but it was his side that conceded first; Kim Minji scored her international debut in the second half to bring things level. After appearing the weaker side for much of the match, Korea seemed to gain some momentum after the goal, but it was too late.\n\nThe Netherlands were always going to be difficult opponents for Korea. In fact, Korea could learn a thing or two from the Dutch model of rapidly developing the domestic women’s football environment with the explicit core aim of improving the national team. WSL all-time top goalscorer Vivianne Miedema completed a hat-trick within 35 minutes; her teammates made it 5-0 by half time. The second half was goalless, but the damage was already done. The scoreline in this match, and England’s 8-0 thumping of China in front of 74,611 fans at Wembley a few days earlier, serve as a stark reminder that the top teams in Asia still have catching up to do when it comes to the women’s game.\n\nConceding five goals in 45 minutes and scraping a draw against a lower-ranking team on bad form: these are not results that inspire confidence, but the proof of the pudding is in the eating, and this pudding — next year's Asian Cup — is still in the oven, raw in the middle.\n\nUnder Shin Sangwoo the women's national team is making progress. He has used this year's A matches to play around with the squad, trying out several formations and starting lineups. Goalkeeper Kim Minjeong has solidified her place in the first eleven. A much-discussed \"new generation\" of players has been welcomed into the fold, with 12 players receiving their first senior call-up and 17 making their international debut this year. More of Korea's squad than ever before are playing regularly for fully professional clubs in the top leagues of Europe and North America.\n\n(Photo by Darrian Traynor/Getty Images)\n\nLooking ahead to the Asian Cup, there is still work to do (isn't there always?). South Korea's women need to be more effective in front of goal. Goals, especially early goals, will boost the squad's confidence as they progress through the tournament and face tougher opposition. Players need to avoid becoming downcast when chasing a result, and trust themselves and their footballing ability rather than resorting to messy tackles and avoidable fouls.\n\nMental toughness will be key in the group stage as Korea are set to face hosts Australia. The Matildas have beaten them twice in 2025, and the home crowd will only be more animated for this major tournament. They are also joined in Group A by Iran and the Philippines. The former didn't make it past the group stage in their Asian Cup debut in 2022, while the latter became the underdog story of that tournament, securing their first-ever qualification for the FIFA Women's World Cup by reaching the semi-finals; they were beaten to the final by South Korea.\n\nNext year's Asian Cup has been a clear driving force behind the women's national team activities in 2025. It's a natural focal point when reflecting on this year, and South Korea's performance at the tournament may well alter the 2025 narrative when looking back in a few months' time. With drastic changes coming to the WK League in 2026 and the national team undergoing a generational shift, women's football in Korea is at a crossroads — let's hope this year's trophies are a sign of things to come.",

    "fullText": "For more than a decade, the International Rescue Committee’s (IRC) annual Emergency Watchlist has accurately predicted 85-95 percent of the countries most likely to face a worsening humanitarian crisis in the coming year. The 2026 report highlights 20 countries and ranks the 10 at greatest risk, as a shifting world order leaves them to confront surging crises amid shrinking international support.\n\nThese countries are home to just 12 percent of the global population, yet account for 89 percent of global humanitarian need. In 2026, tens of millions of people are set to face deepening hunger, displacement and violence as international funding and political attention continue to decline.\n\nRead on to learn more about the 10 countries most likely to face a worsening humanitarian crisis in 2026 and find out how the IRC is responding.\n\nThe threat of renewed conflict between Israel and the Lebanese nonstate armed group Hezbollah is growing, even as approximately 80 percent of Lebanon’s population lives in poverty. Fighting between the two sides in 2024 displaced 1.4 million people in Lebanon and 96,000 Israelis. A return to large-scale conflict in 2026 would overwhelm Lebanon’s fragile public services and sharply escalate humanitarian needs.\n\nThe IRC has been working in Lebanon since 2012, delivering emergency and long-term support to Lebanese citizens and refugees. We offer legal services, protection, education and economic support, as well as mental, sexual and reproductive health services to people affected by and recovering from crises.\n\nLearn more about the IRC’s response in Lebanon.\n\nArmed groups linked to Islamic State and al-Qaeda have engaged in an escalating campaign of kidnappings, forced recruitment and attacks on civilians in Burkina Faso for the past eight years. They have blockaded towns, cutting off more than a million people from food, water and health care. Recurring floods and droughts have also driven displacement and compounded the crisis. Pervasive insecurity has curbed the ability of humanitarians to reach the communities in greatest need.\n\nSince 2019, the IRC has been operating in Burkina Faso to address the humanitarian needs of populations affected by conflict and food insecurity. Its interventions span several sectors: water and sanitation, health, nutrition, economic recovery, protection, women's empowerment and governance. In close collaboration with authorities and local and international partners, the IRC works in accordance with humanitarian principles across seven regions to help communities survive, recover and rebuild their futures.\n\nLearn more about the IRC’s response in Burkina Faso.\n\nMali is facing escalating instability following changes in government, the withdrawal of French forces and the growing presence of the Russian Africa Corps. Armed groups—particularly Jama'at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM)—have expanded across central and southern Mali, attacking key trade routes and blocking the flow of fuel and goods into the capital, Bamako.\n\nThe IRC has been providing humanitarian assistance to crisis-affected populations in Mali since 2012, focusing on children, women and internally displaced persons. Our holistic approach integrates programming focused on health and nutrition, economic support, protection against violence and displacement, education, food security and equitable access to essential services.\n\nLearn more about the IRC’s response in Mali.\n\nConflict in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is growing despite a 2025 peace deal with Rwanda. Clashes involving the Rwandan-backed M23 armed group are escalating, as the group continues to expand its territorial control in eastern DRC and to exploit valuable rare earth and gold mining sites. Violence involving a number of local armed groups as well as forces from Uganda, Burundi and Rwanda is driving displacement, worsening food insecurity and increasing the risk of disease outbreaks.\n\nThe IRC has been operating in the DRC since 1996 to improve the well-being of crisis-affected communities, with a particular focus on women and children. In 2024, the IRC supported more than 305,000 people through its health, nutrition, WASH and education programs, while also strengthening child protection, advancing women’s empowerment and promoting community governance.\n\nLearn more about the IRC’s DRC response.\n\nFive years after the military took power in 2021, the violent conflict in Myanmar between armed groups and the central military continues with no end in sight. Meanwhile, Myanmar’s humanitarian response remains severely underfunded, even after a major earthquake in 2025 escalated the crisis in the country, leaving a total of 16.2 million people in need of humanitarian assistance.\n\nThe IRC initiated an emergency response in Myanmar following Cyclone Nargis in 2008. The IRC has worked with local partners to expand its activities since then, serving people affected by the escalating conflict since February 2021, as well as marginalized and stateless communities. The IRC currently works across multiple sectors in six states, including providing emergency response to communities affected by the earthquake in March 2025.\n\nLearn more about the IRC’s Myanmar response.\n\nHaiti has experienced political chaos since President Jovenel Moïse was assassinated in 2021, leaving the country without effective government or security. Armed gangs now control nearly all of Haiti’s capital, Port-au-Prince. Internationally supported attempts to restore order have failed and the mandate of the Transitional Presidential Council, which currently rules Haiti, is set to expire in February 2026. Gangs could exploit this power vacuum, worsening the situation for civilians who are facing increasing violence, hunger and displacement.\n\nThe IRC has a history of providing humanitarian support in Haiti since 2010, working with a strong network of civil society organizations and local groups to respond to the needs of communities affected by internal displacement and longstanding gang violence. Since December 2022, our services have focused on cholera prevention for internally displaced people and support for survivors of violence, including gender-based violence.\n\nInterconnected domestic and regional dynamics are driving instability across northern Ethiopia that could tilt into widescale conflict. In addition, fighting perpetuated by armed groups continues to displace civilians. Climate shocks like droughts and floods worsen the humanitarian situation. With significant aid cuts, including a $387 million reduction from USAID in 2025, humanitarian agencies are ill-equipped to handle these overlapping crises.\n\nThe IRC began its operations in Ethiopia in 2000, providing support to refugees from neighboring countries as well as Ethiopians living in crisis-affected and underserved communities. The country continues to face recurring challenges, including conflict, natural hazards and climatic shocks, all of which disproportionately affect vulnerable populations. We respond through multisectoral programming in health and nutrition, child protection, education, women’s protection and empowerment, economic recovery and development and environmental health.\n\nLearn more about the IRC’s work in Ethiopia.\n\nSouth Sudan is at risk of sliding back into civil war, as the 2018 peace agreement collapses and the current government breaks down. Meanwhile, the civil war in neighboring Sudan has led to an influx of refugees, added to domestic tensions and disrupted vital oil exports, triggering economic turmoil and growing unrest among unpaid security forces. Relentless annual flooding is devastating food production and has trapped millions in a deepening humanitarian crisis.\n\nFor over three decades, the IRC has stood as a lifeline for communities across the region, responding to the urgent needs of those affected by conflict, displacement and disaster. As one of South Sudan’s largest humanitarian actors, we reach over a million people with health, protection, education and economic empowerment services. In an unstable nation, the IRC’s work is not only lifesaving, it is life-restoring, helping individuals and families rebuild with dignity and hope.\n\nLearn more about the IRC’s South Sudan response.\n\nMore than two years of conflict have devastated Gaza and killed over 70,000 people, according to the Gaza Ministry of Health. In October 2023, Hamas and other armed Palestinian groups attacked southern Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking 200 hostages. The resulting military conflict between Israel and Hamas has systematically destroyed infrastructure, markets and essential food, water, shelter and health services across Gaza. Almost 80% of buildings have been damaged or destroyed and around 90% of the population have been displaced, often multiple times.\n\nA U.S.-led and regionally backed \"peace plan,\" including a ceasefire in October 2025, offers limited hope that external pressure may help reduce the intensity of conflict in 2026. However, there have been repeated violations of the October ceasefire in the weeks after it came into effect, and catastrophic levels of humanitarian need remain a certainty. Meanwhile, in the West Bank, escalating settler violence, financial restrictions and territorial fragmentation are eroding Palestinian security and daily life.\n\nThe IRC and our partners work to provide lifesaving services in the occupied Palestinian territory. In Gaza, that includes clean water, malnutrition treatment, protection and empowerment for women and children, early childhood development, psychosocial interventions, emergency reproductive health and other critical humanitarian needs. In the West Bank, the IRC and our partners continue to provide psychosocial interventions and early childhood development services, as well as build the capacity of community first aid workers.\n\nLearn more about the IRC’s oPt response.\n\nFor the third year in a row, the IRC ranks Sudan atop the Watchlist as the country most likely to experience a deteriorating humanitarian crisis. Sudan’s catastrophic civil war, waged between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and Rapid Support Forces (RSF), has killed over 150,000 people since April 2023 and is preventing lifesaving aid from reaching communities in need. The conflict has also triggered a devastating food crisis, forcing regions of Sudan into famine and causing deaths every single day.\n\nWhen the conflict began in 2023, the IRC adapted its programs and scaled up our response to address increased humanitarian needs. Despite operational challenges, the IRC continues to provide support in Blue Nile, Gedaref, Khartoum, River Nile, South Kordofan and White Nile states and is working on re-establishing its presence in Jazera state.

Rodriguez had established herself as number one contender to Vaquer's title last week, when she took out Bella as she was attempting to demand her rematch after her loss to Vaquer at Survivor Series.\n\nRodriguez tried to overpower Vaquer to start off their match, and she got a lot of offense in throughout the bout. Vaquer went to the top rope to hit a flying cross body, but her challenger caught her and slammed her to the canvas. The champion tried to get Rodriguez in an armbar around the ropes, but before the referee could even begin a five count, Rodriguez had Vaquer up and hit a power bomb.\n\nVaquer hit the Devil's Kiss in the middle of the ring, causing Rodriguez to retreat to the corner where Vaquer hit her with a meteora. She tried to get Rodriguez up for the SVB, but couldn't. On the outside of the ring, Rodriguez caught a second Vaquer cross body and looked to throw her into the ring post, but Vaquer countered and sent Rodriguez face-first into the post.\n\nIt was then that Bella came out of the crowd to attack Vaquer. She connected with the Rack Attack 2.0 in the ring and later in a backstage segment, Bella said she demanded respect as a legend in the business from the other women.\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

    "fullText": "Although Diablo 4: Lord of Hatred takes players to the never-before-seen region of Skovos, it also marks the return of many beloved characters.\n\n on December 15, 2025 at 12:42PM PST\n\nAfter two and a half years, eleven seasons, and one massive, game-changing expansion, Diablo 4's Age of Hatred is finally coming to a close. Announced as part of 2025's The Game Awards, Diablo 4's next expansion, Lord of Hatred, marks the end of the game's ongoing saga--one which has seen Lilith, Inarius, Mephisto, and the humans of Sanctuary engage in an epic struggle to gain control of the world and its future. But while the upcoming expansion promises a \"satisfying\" conclusion and an \"epic, final showdown\" with the game's big bad, Mephisto, it also promises a number of other exciting features, too.\n\nPrior to the expansion's announcement, GameSpot, IGN, and PC Gamer were invited to attend an exclusive interview with two key members of Lord of Hatred's narrative team: lead narrative designer Matt Burns and narrative designer Eleni Rivera. The pair were eager to answer our questions about Lord of Hatred, even those that were, admittedly, both thirsty and bizarre. We left the Q&A session with a better understanding of Mephisto's plans, the lore behind the revamped Paladin class, and the Skovos Isles, as well as a great deal of anticipation--anticipation for more personality-filled dialogue options, plenty of \"Jedi mind tricks,\" and the return of Amazons, Lilith, and Ralph Ineson's velvety voice.\n\nIGN: Vessel of Hatred felt like you guys were holding your breath. Was that a Band-Aid or a part of the story that you always wanted to tell? I'm sure you guys heard a little bit of the feedback that Vessel of Hatred was good and also felt like it was teasing out of the showdown that we were all really waiting for. I'm wondering how much of that was planned versus you guys just taking longer to produce this big showdown.\n\nBurns: It's always been our intention. This is an \"Age of Hatred\" or Mephisto-Lilith-themed saga. Even before the base game came out--once we had finished our work on it, but before the actual release date--we were already planning out the next chapters of the story and it was always going to be about the story about Mephisto, his plans for Sanctuary, and ultimately all culminating to a final confrontation with him.\n\nRivera: When it comes to story, there's always things that change and it's trying to figure out what can we keep, what gets lost, and what is the streamline--especially when it comes to telling this really fun, big story. With Vessel of Hatred, we wanted to really dig into Mephisto and his motivation and keep that with Neyrelle. Now we get a chance to end it. I think it's sticking to our themes about family; that's a really big theme that we have with Mephisto and Lilith, and her children and Inarius. I think that it's finally all coming together. And that was always the plan--to have this big story that feels well-thought-out, and characters that you love and you want to fight for and want to fight against.\n\nIGN: And is this the final showdown?\n\nBurns: Yeah, this is a final showdown. We're going to see Mephisto in his full prime evil demonic glory. It's like what Eleni was talking about a little earlier: When you look at the bigger picture, you're seeing these phases of Mephisto, right? In the base game, he's very on the edges. He's not reborn yet and he's taking on the wolf form. In Vessel, he's a little more powerful because now he's in this Soulstone and he's able to do more. And so in Lord of Hatred, it's like there are no more chains on him. And although he's assuming--at first, at least--this form of Akarat, this prophet figure, he likes to manipulate people and do those sorts of things. He's using a new tool now to do that, but ultimately, the story culminates in us facing him, taking off his mask, and really just having this big epic showdown with him.\n\nRivera: It'll be very satisfying, I think, for the players with a lot of the story. There will be satisfaction along with horrors, and I think that's the best thing for Diablo. You've got some crazy, horrific things, and then you get this nice finale.\n\nGameSpot: Could you tell us a bit more about the Paladin and how they differ from previous games?\n\nBurns: There've been Paladins in Diablo before as well as the Crusader, who's similar to a Paladin in many ways because they're using the light as their source of magic. The Diablo 4 Paladin is a little bit different in terms of the lore and story. Rather than coming from the Zakarum church or being part of this big religion or institution, they're of a smaller order who are independent. And they're just out in the world trying to do good. They've learned from the past that being part of these big institutions inevitably leads to corruption, so they've purposefully, intentionally gone out and said, \"We're not going to get involved in that kind of stuff. We're just going to find the light within us and use that to do good out in the world.\" And so they have these oaths that they live by so that they don't follow the corruption and that sort of thing.\n\nEleni Rivera: The fun part is that we get to reinvent the Paladin. While they recognize the past, they know about the Zakarum, they know about other Paladins that have existed… They get to redefine who they are, what they are, and what The Order is. That's who they are. They even choose a new name when they join The Order, and their name is directly connected to what they find the most important within it. It's so cool. You get a chance to see this new form of who they are.\n\nBurns: And what's interesting about them too is they--due to their close connection with the light--are also aware of angels and the heavens. They know that angels are beings of light. And so they don't worship angels or anything like that, but they see them as these embodiments of light and embodiments of values that are associated with the light, like valor.\n\nGameSpot: Could you tell us a bit more about the region that's coming with the expansion? Are there any real-life locations that inspired it, or parts of history?\n\nBurns: Skovos is really cool, really unique, and interesting to Sanctuary. We mentioned earlier that Skovos is where Lilith, Inarius, and these other rebel angels and demons created Sanctuary, and then they hung out in Skovos. It wasn't necessarily called Skovos back then, but they lived there at the dawn of the world. This is where they created humans, or rather where they created the first humans: the Firstborn. When you think about this saga as a story of family, as Eleni said, or maybe as one about what humanity's fate is, it makes sense to bring this culmination with Mephisto to where humanity itself began. There's tons of Firstborn ruins and, sometimes, not even ruins--it's the modern-day people, the Askari. They've maintained this architecture, they live within it, and they see the Firstborn as part of their heritage in a way, even though it's distant.\n\nThere's a lot of different environments throughout these different islands. Each one of them has a unique theme and flavor. We explore a lot of the culture of this place, so you have the Amazons and you have this oracle order, this Order of Seers. We get to see how they work together and how they rule over this island nation to help it function and survive all this terrible stuff that's happening in other parts of Sanctuary.\n\nBut the big interesting point of conflict is that now the bad stuff that was happening in Sanctuary--the stuff that we saw in base game and Vessel of Hatred--now it's coming to Skovos. Mephisto, in the body of Akarat, has gathered a bunch of followers, he's brought them all to Skovos, and he's disrupting the order and the piece of this place. Anything you want to add to that, Eleni?\n\nRivera: I feel like you covered a lot of it, but it's really beautiful. It's stunning and it's a place that you haven't seen before, so I think that's really exciting. And there's just a lot to look at. There's water that you get to look at, and I know that's very small, but it's just… the environment team did a really good job. And in general, there's a lot of deep lore that we got a chance to explore there. I think that'll be really exciting for players who really love lore and players who are also just diving into Diablo for the first time.\n\nGameSpot: And compared to Vessel, how large is Lord of Hatred? How many hours of story can we expect?\n\nRivera: I would say it's comparable to Vessel of Hatred. The map is pretty big. Like Matt said, there's a lot of lore stuff you get to explore in Skovos, so it's got quite a bit of content that the players get to dive into.\n\nPC Gamer: How do you approach creating a villain like Mephisto in a way that feels like a threat to the player, given that our player characters have just killed tons of demons that were already very powerful?\n\nRivera: It's narrative. It's understanding what a player's weakness is, right? And it's building that up and connecting the player to people like Neyrelle and Lorath. You have these stakes that get bigger and bigger because you care about them more. So when it comes to someone who's so powerful, or someone who can defeat all these demons, what really is the thing that will get them to crack? It's the people that they love, the people that they want to fight for, and Sanctuary. And when it comes to creating a really big villain, it's building off that.\n\nBurns: When we first introduced [Mephisto] in the base game, part of the reason we introduced him that way is because he's not the antagonist in the story yet. We're hunting Lilith and he's helping us, and so it's creating this feeling of, \"Yeah, I don't know if I should trust him or I shouldn't trust him, but he's sort of useful to me, so at what point will the usefulness wear out or will he turn the tables on me?\" Because it's going to happen eventually, right? I think we wanted to introduce him that way just so that it would feel a little different than suddenly there's a prime evil sitting in front of you and you just want to fight him.\n\nI mean Eleni said it perfectly: It's how his effect on the characters we care about--and on the world at large--raises the stakes. And again, we're continuing this thread of him always being a bit of a devil on our shoulder. We're not always working with the best characters--sometimes our allies are a little shifty, too. He exploits that reality. He makes us doubt, maybe sometimes our actions, and the people around us.\n\nIGN: How do you make side quests feel like an organic part of the story when there's literally Satan running around?\n\nBurns: One thing that we've done is there are a number of side quests where it's a continuation of a character story that you meet in the main campaign. There are quests that follow an important character that you're around for some amount of time, and now you get to see what has happened to them after all these big events have unfolded. Yeah, Mephisto is running around and the stakes are so high, but what's going on with these other characters? It's about showing the aftermath of those big events, or showing the repercussions of the devil running loose.\n\nRivera: Yeah. I mean, the main story is so specific to our main characters, but the side quests are what breathe life into Sanctuary. They show us what everybody else is doing while the world is crumbling, and seeing intimate stories--seeing what other characters who maybe we know but they're not in the main quest--I think that gives us a chance as writers to dive deeper, and gives players get the chance to understand what these people are doing while there is this chaos. Life keeps on life-ing even when you've got Mephisto running amok. And I think that's the cool part about writing side quests.\n\nGameSpot: It seems like this idea of generational trauma is really at the core of this saga. Is that something that was intentional to this story? Are there some other ideas and themes that you were really hoping to get across and explore?\n\nBurns: Yes. One of the themes that's present throughout is this idea of the passing of the torch, or like you said, it's sort of a generational… Maybe trauma is part of it, but also how you pass on legacy, and whether you can even pass it on at all. And in passing on a legacy, what kind of burden are you putting on the new people?\n\nFor Lilith wanting to protect Sanctuary, or for the Horadrim wanting to do their thing, these are not easy jobs, right? They require a lot of sacrifice. Sometimes the goal is noble, but passing it on can be hard because you know that you're dooming these people to a tough life. That's definitely a theme that we played with in base game and Vessel, and also we explore in Lord of Hatred as well.\n\nThere's also this prophecy in the base game, and I think it shows up in Vessel of Hatred too, that Rathma had. He had these visions and saw the Great Serpent, and this is still a part of the story. As Eleni said, fate is a big theme and so is this prophecy, how it's unfolding, what it actually means, and whether it must happen or can be avoided. This thing will unfold and be fulfilled, but maybe not in the way the characters necessarily suspect. There will be a lot of sacrifices and choices made by characters that there are no coming back from. [Lord of Hatred] is going to be a big, exciting culmination of everything that started in the base game.\n\nPC Gamer: Could you talk a little bit more about Lilith coming back to the story and what her role is? I know there are quite a few players that really, really enjoyed her in the first game.\n\nRivera: We all love Lilith, right? She's cool, she's hot, she's our mom. I think it's really exciting we get a chance to see her in a new way. There's a lot of intimacy that we get to have with Lilith, and I think that we've always wanted to--or at least I've always wanted to--partner up with her. But Lilith will always be a demon at the end of the day. She has her own motivations and she's always going to have her own idea of what she wants in the world. So she has to decide whether or not she wants to ally with us for this bigger problem.\n\nBurns: The only thing I'd add is, again, it's about bringing these different threads to a close. In the base game, we were fed Lilith's blood petals--fed her blood. She's been a part of us this whole time. And though we defeated her in Hell, something of her has lived on in us. There's a presence inside of us that is slumbering basically. And now that we're going after Mephisto and the stakes are high and the fate of the world hangs in the balance, her presence within us really becomes a key to figuring out how to stop Mephisto. Like she said in the base game, \"There would be no victory without me.\" That sort of idea, it's true--we will need her to fix this and to save Sanctuary from Mephisto.\n\nGameSpot: What inspired the decision to bring back Lilith so soon? Were you a bit worried about bringing her back or was it just something that seemed like, \"Oh no, we have to do this?\"\n\nBurns: Like when I mentioned earlier, before the base game actually released and we were planning out future stories, we always did want to bring her back. Then it became a question of when. It was about finding the right opportunity to do it and make it feel the most impactful to the story.\n\nDuring [Vessel of Hatred's] development, we were toying around with the idea. We actually made some of these scenes where you heard her speaking. There was a scene where you saw her reflection or something like that too, but we cut those things out of Vessel because we were just trying to figure out, \"Okay, where's the place where we should highlight that so that it feels like something really juicy and impactful and not just a little thing that happens and then there's no payoff for it yet?\" You know what I mean?\n\nRivera: I feel like one of the biggest things is deciding how much payoff we want. We talk a lot about how this expansion is going to be super satisfying and everything will feel like it's tied together. Vessel of Hatred was the story of Neyrelle, it was a story of Mephisto, and it was about seeing what he could do without the power of being in Sanctuary. Now that he's out, it's seeing what he's going to do with this free will back in Sanctuary but masked as this major religious figure.\n\nBurns: One fun thing we're doing in Lord of Hatred that we didn't really do before is, with Lilith, you have different dialogue options for how you want to respond to her about certain things. We know that people have different feelings for her--whether she was right, whether she was wrong or whether they would've wanted to join her or not--and so we wanted to explore that through some of the dialogue you can have with her. Now, you get to see different ways she'll respond to you as well based on your decisions.\n\nRivera: I feel like Lilith is so nuanced and so complex. You get a mix of seduction and horror all at the same time and it's so cool and fun. And now we get a chance to really see her in a different way. When we last saw her we were fighting against her, but now there's a bigger issue. There's more at stake here, so it's her deciding what's important to her.\n\nGameSpot: You brought up that you now have options for how you want to interact with Lilith, and I thought that was really interesting because, right now, choice-driven, branching CRPGs are becoming more of the standard in the industry. Is that something that you've ever thought about exploring with Diablo? Having more choice throughout the story, exploring maybe different endings, different stories, and branching paths? Is that even possible in the structure of the game?\n\nBurns: I think it's cool and I enjoy that kind of stuff too. For Lord of Hatred, it's \n\nRivera: That's why we do it sometimes in side quests. It's not like you have two different paths, but I do think we get to explore a little bit of that. There was a side quest from, I think in Vessel of Hatred, that you get to have an alternate ending based on what you choose.\n\nIGN: Romance options? That's all I got.\n\nBlizzard PR representative: Are you asking, \"Can we hook up with Lilith?\"\n\nGameSpot: It's what everybody's thinking.\n\nRivera: In terms of romance, we get to see a little bit of Lorath's past, which is something that we haven't really gotten a chance to see with other characters. He has interactions with Queen Adriana that we get to see. We also get to see a lot more of Lorath, how he was painted in the past, and who he was versus who he's become now.\n\nPC Gamer: Is Lorath back? Are we going to hear more Ralph Ineson?\n\nBurns: Yeah, Lorath is one of the main characters in the expansion. He's going to be with you almost all the time throughout the campaign, except the times you split up and you're off doing different things, right? But yeah, he's there, he's continuing his story. There's a lot about Lorath and the Horadrim in Lord of Hatred. And again, it goes back to the themes of legacy and the fate of the Horadrim.\n\nWe've been in VO sessions with Ralph recording all of his lines, and it's always great to hear his voice again. The moment you hear it, you're like, \"Oh yeah, it's Lorath.\" That's been really fun and I'm super excited about Lorath's story in Lord of Hatred. I think it has a lot of great moments. He's a lot of fun to write as a character and, again, Ralph's voice is just amazing.\n\nAnother thing is Lorath has a history in Skovos, and that's something we'll explore in the campaign but, years and years ago, he came to Skovos with some other Horadrim and went on an adventure there. He met this Amazon named Adriana and they formed a bond, so he has some history with her. And now Adriana is the Amazon queen of Skovos. So with him coming back, there's a connection he has to this place that we're going to explore.\n\nIGN: I'm curious about how you guys are going to make players care about Akarat. The importance of the final cut scene of Vessel of Hatred might have been lost on people unless they're in deep on Diablo, but he's obviously a different type of puppet than a wolf. I'm curious about how you think about bringing Akarat as a character into the fold--and all the baggage that comes with him--and trying to explain why that matters while also showing this new version of the Lord of Hatred who is now walking around as a deity.\n\nRivera: When it comes to Akarat, he's just going to appear as a normal man. I think what is going to really cut deep is the amount of people who are now rushing to get to Skovos; seeing the influence that he has because he's such a big figure in the world and he's been doing miracles in Sanctuary. The idea of all these people worshiping this person that you know as a player is Mephisto, I think that is where that terror starts to come.\n\nHe also has his Jedi mind tricks, right? Mephisto is very good at getting in your head. You think you see one thing, but really he's showing you something else and that's the power. We get a chance to show how Mephisto really plays with your emotions and I think that's the best part about him.\n\nBurns: Just to add to that, a couple interesting things about Mephisto in this form--and ways to create interest for folks playing through it--is at first he's defying expectations, right? Yeah, he's a prime evil in this body, but he's not doing anything bad, which is interesting because that's how Mephisto was in the base game as well. Oftentimes, he's just telling you the truth. Maybe he's trying to get his own way by saying it, but he isn't always lying about things. Right now, he's just out there helping people and doing miracles. So it becomes this question, or this mystery, of what is he doing it all for? Why is he putting on this act? What's his end game for it all?\n\nThe other thing--and this ties into our themes--is that I think that Mephisto believes that humans don't really have any control over their fate. They're just cattle that more advanced entities or intelligent entities like him can lead around. What he's doing here is almost to prove a point to us, The Wanderer, and also to Lilith; you can create these things, these humans, and you can hope that they have some kind of free will or agency, but ultimately I'm going to show you that they don't. That's something else we play with, again, to just deepen his character a bit and make it more interesting.\n\nIGN: You have described Diablo IV as The Hatred Saga, and with this being the final confrontation with the Lord of Hatred, one would assume that that means that's the end of the aforementioned saga. I'm wondering how you guys are thinking about Diablo IV's future. I'm assuming that there's going to be more Diablo IV after this.\n\nBurns: You're right in terms of us just looking at it as The Hatred Saga, and really that's been our focus--just bringing this story to a close in a really big and impactful way. But there are other stories to tell on Sanctuary, of course, though I can't really go into detail about any other stuff.\n\nRivera: I think the best part is Diablo's live service. It gives us the opportunity to dive into whatever we want. Like Season 11, right? We get a chance to bring Hadriel back and we're getting a chance to talk to this angel that we only met briefly in Diablo II. We get to expand Hadriel's lore, which is really cool. We get a chance to always, possibly, tell new stories. But right now, we're just focusing on getting this expansion out and seeing what happens.\n\nThe above interview has been lightly edited for clarity and brevity.\n\nGot a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "title": "New Quantum Antenna Reveals a Hidden Terahertz World",
    "description": "Researchers at the University of Warsaw have unveiled a breakthrough method for detecting and precisely calibrating terahertz frequency combs using a quantum antenna made from Rydberg atoms. By combining atomic electrometry with a powerful terahertz-to-light conversion technique, they achieved the first measurement of a single terahertz comb tooth—something previously impossible due to the limits of electronics and optical tools.",
    "fullText": "A research team from the Faculty of Physics and the Centre for Quantum Optical Technologies at the Centre of New Technologies, University of Warsaw has introduced a new way to measure hard-to-detect terahertz signals using a \"quantum antenna.\" In their work, the scientists applied an innovative radio wave detection setup based on Rydberg atoms that not only senses terahertz radiation, but also accurately calibrates a so-called frequency comb in this part of the spectrum. Until recently, the terahertz range was considered a blank area in the electromagnetic spectrum, and the method reported in the journal Optica opens the door to extremely sensitive spectroscopy and a new class of room-temperature quantum sensors.\n\nTerahertz (THz) radiation, being part of the electromagnetic spectrum, lies at the boundary of electronics and optics, positioned between microwaves (used, for example, in Wi-Fi) and infrared. Although it holds immense potential for applications that include inspecting packages without harmful X-rays, superspeed 6G communication, and spectroscopy and imaging of organic compounds, turning this potential into precise and sensitive measurements has been technically very difficult. In the past few years, scientists have made major strides in both generating and detecting terahertz radiation, yet until now they had not been able to measure a frequency comb in this region with the required precision.\n\nFrequency combs as ultra-precise electromagnetic rulers\n\nWhy is this so important? Frequency combs, which earned a Nobel Prize in 2005, can be imagined as an incredibly accurate ruler made not from a solid material, but from light or radio waves. Instead of millimeter markings, there is a sequence of evenly spaced lines (\"teeth\") at strictly defined frequencies. This \"electromagnetic ruler\" lets physicists determine the frequency of an unknown signal with extraordinary accuracy simply by seeing which \"tooth\" it matches. Because of this, frequency combs act as reference standards that can be used to calibrate and stabilize many types of instruments over a wide range of frequencies. Depending on where in the electromagnetic spectrum this ruler sits, scientists talk about optical, radio, or terahertz frequency combs.\n\nTerahertz frequency combs are particularly attractive because they can support calibration and highly accurate measurements in a band where the oscillation frequencies are higher than typical radio waves but lower than optical waves (light). However, such combs are notoriously difficult to measure with high precision, since their oscillations are too rapid for conventional electronics and cannot be directly captured with standard optical methods. Researchers have been able to determine the spacing between the comb \"teeth\" and to measure the total power spread across the spectrum, but determining how much power belongs to a single tooth has remained a major challenge.\n\nRydberg atoms turned into quantum antennas\n\nThe scientists from the Faculty of Physics and the Centre for Quantum Optical Technologies at the Centre of New Technologies, University of Warsaw have now overcome this obstacle and, for the first time, measured the signal emitted by a single terahertz comb tooth. To achieve this, they employed a gas of rubidium atoms prepared in a Rydberg state. A Rydberg atom is defined as having a single electron excited to a very high orbit by being illuminated with precisely tuned lasers. This \"swollen\" atom acts as a quantum antenna that is extremely sensitive to external electric fields. In addition, by using tunable lasers, the detector can be adjusted to respond to one specific frequency within such a field, across a range that extends up to terahertz waves.\n\nTraditionally, in Rydberg electrometry, the phenomenon of Autler-Townes splitting is used to measure the electric field. Its huge advantage is that the measurement result depends only on fundamental atomic constants, providing an absolutely calibrated readout. Unlike classical antennas, which require laborious calibration in specialized radio laboratories, the atomic-based system is, in a sense, a standard unto itself. Moreover, thanks to the richness of energy states in the atom, such a sensor can be tuned almost continuously over an enormous range, from a direct current (DC) signal up to the aforementioned terahertz.\n\nHybrid terahertz to light conversion for extreme sensitivity\n\nHowever, this method has a limitation: on its own, it is not sensitive enough to record very weak terahertz signals. To remedy this, the research team additionally applied a radio wave-to-light conversion technique invented at the University of Warsaw and adapted it to the needs of terahertz radiation. In this process, the weak terahertz signal is converted into optical photons, which can then be detected with immense sensitivity using single-photon counters. This hybrid approach is the key to success: it combines the extreme sensitivity of photon detection with the ability to \"recover\" the calibration capabilities of the Autler-Townes method even for the weakest signals.\n\nThe sensor based on Rydberg atoms possesses all the features needed to perform precise frequency comb calibration: it can be tuned to a single tooth of the comb, and then retuned to the next, and the next. The scientists managed to observe several dozen teeth in a very wide frequency range this way. Additionally, thanks to the knowledge of the fundamental properties of atoms, the comb was directly calibrated, precisely determining its intensity.\n\nNew path for terahertz metrology and future technologies\n\nThe results obtained by the physicists from the University of Warsaw Wiktor Krokosz, Jan Nowosielski, Bartosz Kasza, Sebastian Borówka, Mateusz Mazelanik, Wojciech Wasilewski, and Michał Parniak represent much more than the development of another sensitive detector. Their work lays the groundwork for a new area of metrology. With the help of Rydberg atoms, the transformative uses of optical frequency combs can now be extended into the previously difficult terahertz region. Importantly, unlike many quantum technologies that require extremely low temperatures, this system functions at room temperature, which greatly lowers costs and makes future commercialization more realistic. This creates an opportunity to build reference measurement standards for the coming generation of terahertz technologies.\n\nThe project \"Quantum Optical Technologies\" (FENG.02.01-IP.05-0017/23) is implemented as part of Measure 2.1 International Research Agendas of the Foundation for Polish Science, co-financed by the European Union from Priority 2 of the European Funds for Modern Economy Programme 2021-2027 (FENG). The research is also one of the results of the SONATA17 and PRELUDIUM23 projects funded by the National Science Centre.)\n\nMaterials provided by University of Warsaw, Faculty of Physics.

    "fullText": "New analysis suggests Bitcoin’s four-year cycles have been replaced — and the world’s biggest cryptocurrency could rebound to $140,000 at some point in the next 180 days.\n\nAccording to Copper, the arrival of exchange-traded funds tracking BTC’s spot price have changed this digital asset’s behavior, and given way to what it calls the “cost-basis returns cycle.”\n\n“Across 2024/2025, Bitcoin has exhibited the same repeatable pattern: price breaks to new all-time highs, corrects sharply, and then finds support almost perfectly at its ETF investor cost basis before beginning the next expansion.”\n\nThe company’s analysis suggests we have seen this play out three times since these ETFs launched back in January 2024 — with each cycle delivering returns of more than 60%.\n\nCopper also claims this has exposed a significant divide between crypto-focused traders and institutional investors, with some Bitcoin commentators claiming it is “the worst bull market ever.”\n\nSo… what exactly causes these sharp corrections once BTC enters price discovery mode? Well, its analysis suggests that institutions rebalancing their portfolios is primarily to blame — an activity that “transforms Bitcoin’s volatility into realized returns.”\n\n“Institutions are not ‘staking sats’ — in fact, most do not care about sats at all now that Bitcoin is accessible through equities-style ETF shares. They care about risk-adjusted contribution to a portfolio.”\n\nGenerally speaking, it’s been recommended that institutions allocate somewhere between 2% and 5% into Bitcoin — but a sudden surge in price can have a huge impact.\n\n“Without rebalancing, a modest 2% Bitcoin allocation drifts to 6.2% in less than 180 days during these cycles. A 5% allocation drifts dangerously close to double-digit.”\n\nCopper’s head of research Fadi Aboualfa told Cryptonews that Bitcoin is now at a critical juncture.\n\n“With BTC now trading near its $84,000 cost basis, that pattern points to a move north of $140,000 in the next 180 days. If cost basis rises 10% to 15% as in prior cycles, the resulting premium seen at past peaks produces a target range of $138,000 to $148,000.”\n\nThe prospect of a return to all-time highs within the next six months would provide a much-needed dose of “hopium” for traders. However, other analysts have warned there are few catalysts that can drive BTC forwards at the moment. The Federal Reserve’s recent 0.25 percentage point interest rate reduction was largely priced in, with policymakers suggesting there may only be one cut in 2026.\n\nA big test will concern what happens if Bitcoin’s value falls below its cost basis for ETF investors — and whether sell-offs would intensify if institutions spent a prolonged period in the red.",

    "title": "Rich Western countries face a stark choice: 6-day workweeks or more immigration, top economist warns",
    "description": "One of the world's foremost economists, Lant Pritchett, has a plan.",
    "fullText": "Eva is a fellow on Fortune's news desk.\n\nA specter is haunting Europe—the specter of aging.\n\nMany Western countries are facing what the World Bank calls a “profound demographic crisis.” The twin perils of an aging population and record-low fertility rates are predicted to send their populations plunging in the coming decades.\n\nThe worst consequences of this demographic shift, per the World Bank, are economic. Soon the shrinking working population in the U.S., Canada, or Germany won’t be able to meet their own constant demands for high-quality goods and services. These rich, senescent countries will have to make a hard choice for economic survival: force people to work more, or allow immigrants to fill in?\n\nLant Pritchett, one of the world’s top thinkers on developmental economics, has seen this crisis coming for decades over his career at Harvard, the World Bank, and Oxford University, where he currently heads a research lab. He told Fortune his radical plan to stave off economic disaster.\n\nIn the long run, without intervention, the UN predicts a decline in population growth could cascade into a full-on population “collapse.” That collapse is not likely to occur until well into the next century—if it comes at all. However, in the short run, population decline presents a real and relatively simple economic problem: The West soon won’t have enough workers.\n\nThe ratio of working-age people to elderly people in rich countries will soon become so diminished that support for elders will be unaffordable. In Japan, a nation already facing the consequences of a graying population, the average cost of nursing care is projected to increase 75% in the next 30 years, with Prime Minister Fumio Kishida warning the nation is on “the brink.” In the U.S., think tanks have warned, an older population with more retirees means a shrinking tax base and higher demands on programs like Social Security and Medicare, along with a smaller number of working-age people to pay into those programs.\n\nIn short, we have a “ticking time bomb” on our hands, in the words of Greece’s Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, whose government introduced a six-day workweek last year to address the nation’s labor shortages. The move prompted fury and protests among workers as they watched their German and Belgian cousins embrace four-day workweeks.\n\nIndeed, even as some European countries and a few American companies flirt with working less, panicked economists and politicians are sounding the alarm: We need to work more. A study conducted by consulting firm Korn Ferry found by 2030, there will be a global human talent shortage of more than 85 million people, roughly equivalent to the population of Germany. That talent shortage could slash $8.5 trillion from nations’ expected revenues, affecting highly educated sectors such as financial services and IT as well as manufacturing jobs, which are considered “lower skilled” and require less education.\n\nNow is the time to act, economic veteran Pritchett told Fortune. But doing so involves some radical rethinking of the current immigration debate.\n\nClassical economics offers a number of ways to address a labor shortage, Pritchett said. Since most of the unfilled jobs are “unskilled,” or don’t require a degree to complete, one solution for businesses and governments is to invest in automation, essentially having robots fill the gap. But while automation helps get the jobs done, it depresses human workers’ wages by decreasing the number of jobs available, “exacerbating” the issue, Pritchett said.\n\nSome have called for increasing wages to induce more people to work. But most of the working-age population in the U.S. is already employed. Despite a well-documented decline in the portion of working-age men with jobs over the past few decades, Pritchett said the vast majority of working-age men are working, meaning raising pay would have small effects at best. There’s room for more women to work, he noted, but that could take away from other important responsibilities that are overwhelmingly shunted to women, such as caring for family or raising children.\n\nThat leaves two other options: forcing workers to work more or allowing an influx of legal, controlled immigration.\n\nMitsotakis’s plan for a six-day workweek is a step in the right direction for the short term, Pritchett said.\n\nBut “economics is not just about direction: It’s about magnitude,” he added. In other words, he says, small policy tweaks won’t do it. If we’re trying to address a big, structural problem with the U.S. labor force, the solution needs to be ambitious and comprehensive—precisely the type of legislation American politicians have largely avoided in recent years.\n\nIf policymakers simply try to make everyone work an additional day, the math simply won’t work out in the long run, Pritchett said. Even if Greece has “fantastic success” and increases its working hours by 10% over the next 30 years, that growth would represent a “drop in the bucket” in fighting a worsening labor shortage. He calculated a demographic labor force gap of 232 million people globally in his most recent paper, even assuming the highest possible labor force participation rate.\n\n“You can’t solve a problem that’s growing over time with [a labor force] that has an upward bound,” he said. You would have to keep the labor force working more and more, and even then, you would never be able to fill in the gap.\n\nPritchett has a better idea. He knows the current immigration debate is fraught, since the West is concerned with the social ramifications of allowing more migrants into its borders. But he maintains the only way to solve rich countries’ labor problem is to let in immigrants to work, particularly from countries where population growth is increasing, such as Nigeria or Tanzania, rather than decreasing.\n\nIn his view, the Western debate on immigration has taken on an unnecessarily binary flavor, with the choice depicted as one between a path to citizenship or closed borders. In an article titled “The political acceptability of time-limited labor mobility,” Pritchett says the West will soon have to abandon this view. Instead, he advocates for developed nations to embrace a system where immigrants can come to their country to work for a limited time—while also buying goods and services, renting homes, starting companies, and hiring workers—and then go back home, leaving both parties wealthier.\n\nThe truth, Pritchett said, is the U.S. needs low-skilled migrants, and many migrants need the economic boost from working in the U.S. Immigration is a symbiotic relationship that the West cannot quit—that’s why it’s so hard for us to actually control our borders.\n\n“The way to secure the border is to create a legitimate way for people and firms to get the labor that the economy really needs in legitimate, legal ways, and until we have that, the whole debate over the wall and stuff is just silly,” Pritchett said.\n\nIf anything, the intensifying crackdown on undocumented and legal migration since the late 1980s has led to mass settlement, according to Hein de Haas, a sociologist of immigration. Prior to the 1980s, the U.S. and Mexico enjoyed a relationship similar to the work-visa program Pritchett envisions. Mexicans freely flowed across the border, coming for a short time to work, returning home to enjoy their money, and sometimes repeating this journey over several years, Haas wrote. They never permanently settled because, knowing they could come and go as they pleased, they did not have to.\n\nThe U.S. facilitated this temporary migration programs specifically aimed at Mexicans,  encouraging contract workers to come to the U.S. after  World War I and II. The second of these, the Bracero Program, established a treaty for the temporary employment of Mexican farmworkers in the U.S., and was so popular that it was extended far beyond its initial life span, allowing nearly 5 million Mexicans to temporarily work in the U.S. from 1942 to 1964. (The program ended in 1965, when the U.S. sharply limited immigration from Latin America as part of a major overhaul of immigration laws.)\n\nWhat Pritchett suggests isn’t too dissimilar from simply turning the clock back to a time when migrants could move and work freely. He proposes a fixed-term system: A worker comes to the U.S. with the understanding that they are not on a path to citizenship, works on a three-year contract, and then returns to their home country. After an “off period” of six months to a year, the migrant could come back for another three years.\n\n“There are a billion people on the planet who would come to the U.S. under those terms,” Pritchett said. “But we don’t have that available.”\n\nHe isn’t exaggerating about the billion. In a 2010 survey, Gallup asked people around the world whether they would like to temporarily move to work in another country. Some 1.1 billion responded “yes,” including 41% of the age 15-to-24 population and 28% of those ages 25-44, Pritchett said.\n\n“What you could make in America in three years and go back to Senegal with is a fortune compared to anything else you could do to make your way in Senegal,” he added. “You go back to Senegal, you build a house, you buy your own business, and you’ve transformed your life by working temporarily.”\n\nTo avoid potential labor shortages in sending nations, Pritchett’s system would depend on bilateral agreements between the host and sending countries, and nations “could choose to put limits on their participation” to address their own labor needs, Pritchett said.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. would receive fresh batches of workers for service industries, elderly care, or manufacturing—essentially, all the jobs that would be otherwise unfilled.\n\nPolicies like these are not yet being discussed on the national stage, but Pritchett believes that will soon change. With the upcoming labor shortage and the unpopularity of forcing workers to toil for longer, politicians will have to expand their understanding of immigration to allow for policies like his. For now, he’s planting the seed.\n\nIn partnership with economist Rebekah Smith, Pritchett has started an organization called Labor Mobility Partnerships (LaMP) that aims to build political support for a temporary rotational migration system. The way he sees it, nothing will change by pitching the idea to politicians (“who tend to be followers, not leaders”) so instead, he is working with countries that are currently already expanding their immigration channels, like Spain.\n\nHe is also courting business leaders in sectors that will be the hardest hit by labor shortages, such as elderly care, who could “be potentially a powerful force” in explaining to politicians why policies like his are necessary.\n\n“Ideas at times are like dams: huge, unmoving, impregnable, able to hold the water back forever,” Pritchett writes in the conclusion of his paper. “But a small, strategically placed crack can cause a dam to be washed away overnight.”\n\nA version of this story was published on Fortune.com on Aug. 4, 2024.",

    "fullText": "SpaceX is reportedly preparing for a monster IPO — and a booming Starlink is a big reason why.\n\nGlobal web traffic from SpaceX's satellite-based internet service more than doubled in 2025, according to data from Cloudflare, a cybersecurity company that handles tens of millions of requests between users and websites every second.\n\nIt's the latest year of explosive traffic growth for Starlink, which uses a constellation of more than 9,000 low-orbit satellites to provide internet connection, including to remote areas.\n\nSpaceX said in November that the service has 8 million active customers, up from 4 million in September 2024, and is now online in over 150 markets.\n\nAround 23 airlines have also announced plans to use Starlink to offer high-speed WiFi on their planes, and SpaceX has signalled it could soon launch its own mobile carrier service powered by the satellite network.\n\nStarlink's growth comes as reports suggest a colossal SpaceX public listing is on the cards. Elon Musk seemed to confirm on Wednesday that the rocket maker is considering an IPO as early as next year, which multiple outlets have reported could see SpaceX valued at around $1.5 trillion.\n\nThat would catapult SpaceX into the list of the world's most valuable companies, and potentially put Musk within touching distance of becoming the first-ever trillionaire.\n\nSince its founding by Musk in 2002, SpaceX has successfully commercialized reusable rockets, a feat previously thought impossible by many within the space industry, and now launches more cargo into orbit than any other company.\n\nIn the long term, SpaceX aims to fulfill its billionaire founder's ambitious visions of colonizing Mars and putting data centers in space with its giant Starship rocket.\n\nFor now, however, the Texas-based company's huge valuation is driven by the success of Starlink, with Musk saying this month that the satellite network was \"by far\" the largest driver of SpaceX's revenue.\n\nCloudflare's annual report found that in the more than 20 countries and regions where Starlink launched in 2025, internet traffic from its satellite service surged immediately after the service became available. Cloudflare said that internet traffic grew 295% in Botswana this year, with Starlink launching in the African country in August 2024.\n\nThere's no sign of Starlink slowing down, with SpaceX preparing to launch the service in India next year.\n\nThere's also little sign of major competition. Rival services, including Amazon's Leo and China's Spacesail, are attempting to build their own constellations, but they have launched fewer satellites than Starlink.",

    "fullText": "A United Airlines flight bound for Tokyo was forced to return to Washington Dulles International Airport on Saturday after losing power in one of its engines shortly after takeoff, triggering a brush fire on the ground and prompting a federal investigation. The Boeing 777-200 was carrying 275 passengers when the incident occurred, according to the airline.\n\nUnited Flight 803 departed Dulles around 12:35 p.m. en route to Tokyo’s Haneda Airport. After the engine issue was detected, the aircraft circled the area for just under an hour before landing safely back at Dulles. United said there were eight crew members aboard and no injuries were reported.\n\nU.S. Transportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy said in a post on X that a piece of the jet’s engine cover broke off after takeoff, sparking a brush fire near the runway. He added that the Federal Aviation Administration will investigate the incident.\n\nI've been briefed on United Flight 803 from Dulles to Japan. \n\nHere’s what we know:\n -An engine failed on the Boeing 777-200ER shortly after take-off\n -275 passengers, 15 crew members on board\n -A piece of the engine cover separated and caught fire, sparking a brush fire on… https://t.co/IxkFJU2Fes\n\n— Secretary Sean Duffy (@SecDuffy) December 13, 2025\n\nEmily McGee, a spokesperson for the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority, said the fire was quickly extinguished and that airport fire and rescue crews evaluated the aircraft after it returned. Smoke from the brush fire was visible across the tarmac as other flights continued arriving and departing.\n\nThe incident briefly disrupted operations at Dulles and drew the attention of passengers across the airport.\n\nHouman David Hemmati, a California-based ophthalmologist, was seated on a separate United flight bound for Los Angeles when his pilot announced a ground stop.\n\n“We are on a ground stop,” the pilot told passengers, Hemmati said. “There’s an incident on the runway.”\n\nLooking out his window, Hemmati said he saw thick smoke rising near the runway, illuminated by flashing emergency vehicles. He took photos and posted on X, writing, “Praying it’s not a crash.”\n\nHemmati’s flight was later diverted to another runway and allowed to depart around 1 p.m. As the plane climbed, he said smoke was still visible below.\n\nCommercial aircraft are designed to fly safely on a single engine, particularly during critical phases like takeoff. Pilots train extensively for engine failures, and standard protocol typically calls for returning to the departure airport when a problem occurs shortly after liftoff.\n\nKey details from the incident include:\n\nFlight: United Airlines Flight 803\n\nPassengers: 275 passengers and eight crew members\n\nIssue: Loss of power in one engine after takeoff\n\nGround impact: Engine cover debris sparked a brush fire\n\nOutcome: Safe return to Dulles with no reported injuries\n\nNext step: FAA investigation underway\n\nUnited praised the response of its crews and airport personnel in a statement released Saturday.\n\n“United is grateful to our crews and to the teams at Washington Dulles for their quick work to help ensure the safety of everyone involved,” the airline said. United added that it is working to rebook passengers on a later flight.\n\nThe FAA has not released details on what caused the engine cover to detach or whether the aircraft had any prior maintenance issues. Investigators are expected to examine flight data, maintenance records, and debris from the engine as part of the inquiry.\n\nThe Boeing 777 remains one of the most widely used wide-body aircraft in international travel, but any engine-related issue shortly after takeoff draws immediate scrutiny from regulators.\n\nFor passengers aboard Flight 803, the incident ended without injury but with a tense delay to an already long journey. For United and federal investigators, the focus now turns to determining what failed and whether any broader inspections are needed.\n\nThe FAA’s findings will ultimately determine whether the incident was an isolated mechanical failure or part of a larger concern.",

    "fullText": "He rewrote the rule book with Rockstar then left it all behind. Now Dan Houser is back with a storytelling-focused studio to take on AI-obsessed tech bros and Mexican beauty queens\n\nThere are only a handful of video game makers who have had as profound an effect on the industry as Dan Houser. The co-founder of Rockstar Games, and its lead writer, worked on all the GTA titles since the groundbreaking third instalment, as well as both Red Dead Redemption adventures. But then, in 2019, he took an extended break from the company which ended with his official departure. Now he’s back with a new studio and a range of projects, and 12 years after we last interviewed him, he’s ready to talk about what comes next.\n\n“Finishing those big projects and thinking about doing another one is really intense,” he says about his decision to go. “I’d been in full production mode every single day from the very start of each project to the very end, for 20 years. I stayed so long because I loved the games. It was a real privilege to be there, but it was probably the right time to leave. I turned 45 just after Red Dead 2 came out. I thought, well, it’s probably a good time to try working on some other stuff.”\n\nAt first, he looked into film or TV writing, but didn’t like what he found. “That world was not overly excited by me and I was not overly excited by them,” he says. “I’ve spent 20 years talking about how games are the coming medium and now they are the medium […] you look at TV and the budgets and the amount of money they can generate, but the creative ambition is so small at times”. It seemed to Houser that it would be easier to come at the industry with IP that had already been generated. So he moved to Santa Monica and formed Absurd Ventures, bringing in Greg Borrud (founder of Seismic Games and Pandemic Studios) as head of games and, as COO, Wendy Smith, previously at the New Yorker and Ralph Lauren, and a White House special assistant during Bill Clinton’s presidency.\n\nIt was clear from the start it wouldn’t just be a video games studio. In 2024, the company released the 12-part story podcast A Better Paradise, a dystopian thriller about an ambitious online game world overseen by a powerful AI presence that begins to become sentient – with devastating consequences. Its creator is the mysterious tech billionaire Dr Mark Tyburn, a British inventor who intends the game as a digital utopia, then abandons it when things go awry. In some ways it is a satire on our current digital oligarchy, in which billionaire tech bros wield astronomical influence over society.\n\n“All of these tech companies start out with grandiose ambitions, this ‘we are going to save the world through togetherness’-type gibberish,” he says. “We’ve created some of the most powerful people in history in terms of reach and mind control. Those people end up living with far more money than anyone’s ever had. And it feels, as someone who lives in the society that they have helped create, that there are moments in those journeys when they must have felt their product was not quite what they intended it to be and was doing unforeseen harm, and … they went out of their way to ensure that was not regulated. That Faustian moment I find fascinating, and that’s not to say I wouldn’t make the same choice or judge them for it, I just find it interesting.”\n\nTellingly perhaps, the company at the centre of A Better Paradise, Tyburn Industria, feels much more like a games studio than a social media mega-corp. Also, the lead protagonist is a writer who finds himself at the centre of the game’s development. Is there an element of autobiography here?\n\n“Yeah, of course – at that level,” says Houser. “But I also wanted to write about games and tech in a way that felt authentic. To lean slightly more into the games side in terms of the office environment was really easy for me. I know what it’s like to work in a games company obviously. I wanted to try and bring that to life in a way that felt real and to capture some of the micro dramas.”\n\nHaving turned A Better Paradise into a novel, Houser’s Santa Monica studio is now working on an open-world video game version. He’s not saying how it will fit in with the podcast, just that Mark Tyburn and the AI at the heart of his game, NigelDave (a wildly intelligent program, fixated by humans but with no understanding of how they function), will both figure in the action.\n\nAlso in development at the company’s second studio in San Rafael, is the Absurdaverse, a comedy universe populated by a menagerie of weird characters, from a skeletal warrior to an ageing hippy. The company is planning a series of animated TV shows and/or movies for the concept, but also another open world game, which Houser has described as, “a living sitcom”. Again, he’s vague on the details, but it looks to be a more story-driven take on The Sims, possibly utilising AI to create emergent narratives around the characters and their lives. “We’re trying to use the memories of NPCs in a fun way,” he says. “Just trying to make it a bit more alive. You’ll see when we talk about it more, but it is shaping up really well. It’s a completely gamey game – very mechanics driven. With both games, we’re trying to make them really strong on mechanics, really fun to play, accessible, but plenty of depth.”\n\nHouser is also planning a game around the company’s third IP, the comic book series American Caper, co-written with fellow Rockstar alumnus, Lazlow. With its cast of escaped convicts, crooked lawyers and Mexican beauty queens, it is perhaps the closest out of all his new projects to Grand Theft Auto. Which is perhaps why the interactive version is going in a different direction. “I’m not making an open-world game for that,” says Houser. “We’re actually looking at maybe doing more of a story game. We’re still kind of exploring it.”\n\nWe talk a little bit about the current prevalence of forever games such as Minecraft, Fortnite and Roblox and how they’re sucking up a lot of the world’s playtime. But Houser is adamant that there’s still a vast audience for mature single-player narrative experiences – and that’s what he’s aiming at.\n\n“We’re trying to be ambitious, to make new stuff,” he says. “At some level [our projects] are traditional console games, accessible, but action-oriented story-driven open world console games – but then at the same time, we’re doing it a slightly different way or with slightly different subject matter. Three years ago we were watching one of those PlayStation showcases, and if you blinked and missed the credit sequences, you couldn’t tell where one game ended and the other began. Everything was sort of dark purple and about space ninjas. They were about this apocalypse or that apocalypse but always felt the same.”\n\n“That’s fine. Some of them are amazing games. But we were like, well, we’ve got limited money and we are starting from scratch. We have to have good stories and fun dialogue, and make sure our gameplay is amazing and accessible, and our art direction has to be fresh – at all points, it has to feel different. We have to make stuff where people go, ‘Well, I’ve never played a game about that’, and then treat the audience, not just as gamers, but as human beings.”\n\nSo he’s not worried about the industry’s current obsession with live-service multiplayer mega-games? “I still think there is enough of an audience who want new stuff and single player-led stuff,” he says. And then in his characteristically self-deprecating way he adds: “I hope so. Or we’re in a little bit of trouble.”",

    "description": "Mason Mount is delivering for Manchester United - but can his performances force him into Thomas Tuchel's World Cup squad?",
    "fullText": "\"I have to tell you, I love that kid.\"\n\nRuben Amorim's first public observations on Mason Mount after his appointment as Manchester United head coach just over a year ago have stood the test of time.\n\nIt has taken longer than hoped for United's fanbase to come to the same conclusion, but Mount's goal and overall performance at Wolves last week had them purring.\n\nSuddenly, the hole left by the impending departure of Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo to the Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) doesn't look quite so difficult to fill.\n\nMount's game intelligence plus his awareness and ability to play in tight spaces are coming to the fore. Now the phrase most used about him is: \"His quality was never in doubt.\"\n\nAlmost two and a half years into the five-year contract he signed in July 2023, Mount's own bold declarations about the future have some meaning.\n\n\"I am hugely ambitious,\" he said on his arrival at Old Trafford. \"I know how amazing it feels to win major trophies and what it takes to do it.\n\n\"I will be giving everything to experience that again at Manchester United.\"\n\nIt is fair to say the statement of intent Mount made after completing his £55m move from Chelsea is yet to be fulfilled.\n\nMatch-winner Mount's quality 'never in doubt'\n\nAmorim hails Mount after win at Wolves\n\nA Champions League and Club World Cup winner with Chelsea, Mount was an injury-time substitute for United's 2024 FA Cup final victory over Manchester City. He started the Europa League final defeat by Tottenham in May and was part of the United squad that finished 15th.\n\nNot that the 26-year-old regrets leaving boyhood club Chelsea.\n\nSpeak privately to people who know Mount well and you get the impression restoring United's fortunes offered the kind of challenge that enthused him.\n\nUnder Erik ten Hag at the time, the club made it clear they wanted him. That matters. It still does. That is why Amorim's first words were perfectly put.\n\nAs the former Sporting coach assessed the squad he was inheriting, he knew in Mount he was getting a high-level, flexible player who could fit into a variety of different positions within his system, something Amorim felt he did not have enough of.\n\nLeft, right, as an orthodox number 10, as a six, or an eight, Mount has a range of experiences that make him very useful for a coach who regards adaptability as a key weapon.\n\n\"He's a very smart player,\" was Amorim's response when asked about Mount on Friday before Monday's Premier League game with Bournemouth. \"He's really technical.\n\n\"Sometimes being a technical player is not just having fun with the ball. It's the quality of the pass, the reception, how to receive the ball. Mason can balance our team quite well.\"\n\nAmorim is not alone at United's Carrington training ground in recognising Mount's qualities. He is certainly not the only one genuinely glad a player who can offer so much is able to put injury issues to one side and deliver performances on a consistent basis.\n\nNo-one would argue the past couple of years have been easy. Mount himself has admitted dealing with two extended absences and a couple of smaller frustrating ones was tough.\n\nBut staff around Carrington admired the professional attitude Mount adopted throughout his various recoveries.\n\nTraining-ground sources have said the player left no stone unturned in pursuit of staying fit and was regularly one of the last to leave after long stints in the ice bath and sauna sessions.\n\nHe is regarded as a link within Amorim's squad - someone who knits groups of players together - which has been particularly evident this season when, it is generally acknowledged, United's players have remained tight and focused on delivering better results.\n\nMount is also well liked by non-football staff because he is helpful, which is not something that can be taken for granted in the playing department at United or any other club. He spends time with a couple of kids who are regulars outside the training ground, has spoken with them and their parents and still wears a bracelet one of them gave him.\n\nThese traits are all positives on a human scale.\n\nHowever, in the pressurised world of the Premier League, they are side issues compared to delivering on the pitch - and just now, he is on a roll.\n\nOutstanding in the win at Crystal Palace on 30 November, Mount followed up with an excellent performance against Wolves, who were admittedly poor at Molineux but proved they can be obdurate and diligent in their unlucky loss at Arsenal.\n\nGoals in both victories have taken his overall tally for United to seven, to match his shirt number, a fact not lost on the club's content creators who put them all on the app and launched a vote for which was the best. His second in the Europa League semi-final against Athletic Bilbao - a two-touch, 50-yard effort to seal a 4-1 win - came out on top.\n\nThe idea over the next few weeks and months is to widen that particular area of debate as United push for a European place - their overall aim - and try to secure a top-five berth likely to deliver a return to the Champions League a year before schedule.\n\nMount won the most recent of his 36 England caps in the 2022 World Cup quarter-final defeat by France in Qatar.\n\nDespite three years without an international appearance, Three Lions boss Thomas Tuchel has not forgotten him.\n\nMount revealed in the summer his former manager at Chelsea had been in touch. The pair were spotted chatting after last month's home defeat by Everton and while competition for World Cup places is fierce and Mount is rated as unlikely to break in at this stage, it cannot entirely be discounted.\n\nThe player himself is not setting that as a target. Sources say his focus and drive remains on delivering on those first words following his arrival from Chelsea.\n\nMount recognises turning the United tanker around has to be a collective effort but there are signs it is heading in the right direction, even if the process is lengthy and not without the odd glitch.\n\nHe clearly has a significant role though. Mount has missed one game so far this season though injury. His impact is starting to be felt.\n\nJust as United prepare to lose two significant attacking forces to Afcon, they can look for Mount to deliver in their absence with an increased feeling of confidence.\n\nLatest Manchester United news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Man Utd - what do you want to know?",
