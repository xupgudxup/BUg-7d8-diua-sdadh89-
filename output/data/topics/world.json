    "fullText": "Carlos Alcaraz admitted it was tougher than expected to beat world number 102 Yannick Hanfmann at the 2026 Australian Open, despite advancing in straight sets.\n\nThe world No.1 Spaniard’s third-round clash tested his rhythm early, even though he eventually sealed a 7-6(7-4), 6-3, 6-2 victory to reach the third round at Melbourne Park.\n\nAfter the match, Alcaraz spoke honestly about the challenge posed by Hanfmann’s level and pace on the big stage.\n\nCarlos Alcaraz said after his Australian Open second-round win that his opponent pushed him harder than expected.\n\n“I knew he was going to play great. I mean, I know his level, I played him a few times already. To be honest, it was tougher than I thought at the beginning.\n\n“I didn’t feel the ball that good. You know, the ball was coming as a bomb, forehand and backhand,” Alcaraz stated.\n\nAlcaraz’s second-round match saw some early resistance from the German qualifier, ranked 102 in the world, especially in a closely contested first set that went to a tie-break.\n\nBut once the top seed found his groove, he took command to close out the match in straight sets and keep his bid for a maiden Australian Open title alive.\n\nSpeaking further about his performance, Alcaraz acknowledged how he turned things around after a difficult opening frame.\n\n“Really, really happy that I got through a really difficult first set and then I started to feel a little bit better on the court,” he concluded.\n\nWith the win secured in roughly 2 hours and 44 minutes, Alcaraz moves into the third round, where he will look to build momentum and push deeper into the draw at the Australian Open, a title that has eluded him previously despite his status as one of the sport’s brightest stars.",

    "description": "The European Union could roll out a never-before-used tool known as a trade \"bazooka\" should Trump move forward with his proposed tariffs.",
    "fullText": "Europe is weighing retaliation if President Donald Trump imposes more tariffs — and it threatens the US's big global advantage.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron pushed to activate what's commonly referred to as a trade \"bazooka\" in response to Trump's recent threat to impose an additional 10% tariff on European countries unless they agree to a deal ceding control of Greenland.\n\n\"The anti-coercion mechanism is a powerful instrument, and we should not hesitate to deploy it in today's tough environment,\" Macron said at the World Economic Forum at Davos on Tuesday.\n\nMacron was referring to a tool passed by the EU in 2023 that would allow it to impose tariffs on imports and restrict services from the US.\n\nThe hit to services such as pharma, tech, and finance would be the new blow to the US economy, as tariffs tend to focus on goods. While the US has a trade deficit for goods, it has a surplus for services.\n\nThe US exported $1.1 trillion in services in 2024, according to data from the St. Louis Federal Reserve, and has exported more services than it has imported for the last five decades, making it the world's leading services exporter. The St. Louis Fed said in its report that it means \"the U.S. can specialize in services and trade with other countries, which leads to greater efficiency and more benefits for consumers.\"\n\nThe Bureau of Economic Analysis also found that the US exported $489 billion in services to Europe that same year.\n\nAlex Durante, a senior economist at the nonpartisan Tax Foundation, told Business Insider that these threats are \"uncharted territory,\" and Trump's push to acquire Greenland could put the US' international standing at risk.\n\n\"America really would lose whatever standing it still has in the world if it were to go forward and do something like that,\" Durante said.\n\nWhite House Spokesman Kush Desai told Business Insider that \"the Trump administration has kept its word\" on its trade deal with the EU earlier this year, adding, \"the EU's time would be better spent delivering on these trade commitments.\"\n\nIn his plan, Trump called out eight European countries that opposed US control of Greenland and sent troops to the country, including Denmark, Germany, France, and the United Kingdom, as potential targets for more tariffs.\n\nThose tariffs would be raised to 25% in June if those countries do not agree to the deal, Trump said.\n\n\"This tariff will be due and payable until such time a deal is reached for the complete and total purchase,\" he wrote in a Truth Social post.\n\nA Q&A from the EU Commission said that the anti-coercion tool is \"designed to be broad\" to allow for an \"efficient response to an individual case of economic coercion with minimal or no impact on the EU economy.\"\n\nIt could restrict access to European markets for US-based service exporters, such as Big Tech companies and Wall Street firms.\n\nThe trigger for this tool, per the Commission, would be a situation in which a country pressures a member of the EU into making a decision through trade threats.\n\nDurante highlighted the intellectual property issues; the EU could restrict certain IP licenses for US firms. It could similarly limit US banks' access to EU markets, increasing costs domestically.\n\n\"A lot of those sectors, in terms of the tariffs that Trump has imposed, have been insulated from that because of the exemptions,\" Durante said.\n\nIf Trump follows through on his threatened tariffs on EU countries, prices of affected goods would likely increase. The Kiel Institute for the World Economy — a German think tank — found in a recent report that examined over 25 million shipment records that 96% of US tariffs have been paid by US consumers between January 2024 and November 2025.\n\nAnd if the EU rolls out the bazooka, it would take time — the Commission said it would have four months to examine the allegations and up to six months to determine an appropriate response. At the same time, the Trump administration is awaiting the Supreme Court's ruling on the legality of many of the president's tariffs, which could limit the tools that Trump has for future trade threats.\n\nAmerican workers could also be affected, Durante said, because the anti-coercion tool would target \"natively American firms\" and reduce their market access and profitability.\n\n\"When you have this kind of tit for tat policy, the US threatens something, the EU responds, and then we threaten something else even beyond that, it could really get out of hand very fast and make citizens of both the EU and the US worse off,\" Durante said.",

Fink said that China's population size and different privacy regime could translate into a major data advantage.\n\nThat dynamic, Fink argued, makes collaboration among the US and its allies essential. \"I would much rather say that we need to spend more money to make sure that we're competing properly against China,\" he said.\n\nStill, Fink warned that the AI boom could disappoint if its benefits remain concentrated among a small group of dominant firms.\n\n\"The key to that is making sure that the demand only comes if technology is diffused for more applications, more utilizations,\" he said.\n\n\"If technology is just the domain of the six hyperscalers, we will fail,\" he added.\n\nFink's comments came amid a broader debate about whether massive investments in AI are sending the stock markets into a bubble.\n\nSome leaders, including OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, have cautioned about overexcitement in AI — even as they acknowledge the technology's game-changing potential.\n\nMeanwhile, Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates said in late October that AI was in a bubble.",

Security guards cleared Congress Hall after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink wrapped up around noon.\n\nWhile waiting to go back in to hear Trump, attendees, including financier Anthony Scaramucci and University of California chief investment officer, Jagdeep Singh Bachher, could be seen sipping coffee and eating saffron risotto Milanese.\n\nA French journalist approached me to ask whether Trump's threats were real.

His methods are causing great tension among his allies, but they agree that the Arctic is an area of risk.\n\n\"I think President Trump is right. Other leaders in NATO are right. We need to defend the Arctic,\" as China and Russia increase their presence there, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said in a Wednesday morning appearance at Davos.\n\nAs Trump seeks Greenland, insisting that it's key for protection against Russia and China, his allies don't actually disagree with his security concerns.

He expects tensions with the US to de-escalate, \"I think at the end of the day, we'll find an off-ramp on this.\"\n\nAfter an electrical issue on Air Force One delayed the president overnight, a replacement plane, a Boeing C-32A, was scrambled into action to bring him to Europe.\n\nAs of around midday Swiss time, the jet, a modified Boeing 757 often used as Air Force Two, was still in the air, flying close to Paris and heading for Zurich airport, where it looks likely to land within the next hour.\n\nIf, like many high-profile World Economic Forum attendees, Trump travels by helicopter from Zurich airport, it would take about another 30 to 40 minutes to reach Davos.\n\nThat could put him in the Swiss Alps just before 1.30 p.m. CET, and he is scheduled to speak at 2:30 p.m. CET.\n\nHowever, there will likely be further added time due to security and other preparations.\n\nIn short, we don't exactly know.\n\nNo clear indication has been given of what the president plans to discuss in his special address to the Davos crowd.

As Business Insider's Jennifer Sor noted yesterday, stocks tumbled in one of the worst days for the US market since April 2025. Both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq dropped more than 2%, while the Dow wasn't far behind, losing 1.8%.\n\nThings are looking much calmer so far on Wednesday, with investors seemingly in a classic holding pattern ahead of the president's speech later.

The first: Can the West grow economies fast enough to overcome deficits?\n\n\"That can be one big issue, especially with the rising deficits of the US,\" Fink said.\n\nSecondly, another limiting factor is whether Western economies can make a J-curve of demand happen for AI and other technologies.\n\n\"The key to that is making sure that the demand only comes if technology is diffused for more applications, more utilizations,\" Fink said. \"If technology is just the domain of the six hyperscalers, we will fail.\"\n\nTax us — that's the message from nearly 400 wealthy people, who've signed an open letter addressed to the leaders gathering at Davos.\n\nThe letter's co-signees called out a \"handful of global oligarchs with extreme wealth,\" accusing them of harming society as a whole across governance, tech, innovation, and the environment.\n\nThe solution, per the letter, comes down to one thing — taxing the superrich.\n\nSignatories include the actor Mark Ruffalo, film producer and activist Abigail Disney, and musician Brian Eno.\n\n\"I believe President Trump is going to be about 3 hours late,\" US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said at a morning presser. \"I haven't seen the updated schedule.\"\n\nICYMI: Trump had to switch planes after an electrical fault was detected on board Air Force One.\n\nDavid Steinbach, Hines' global chief investment officer, didn't mince words when describing the overall real-estate environment.\n\n\"It's been a really bad few years, honestly,\" Steinbach told me. \"Really beginning in 2022.\"\n\nDavid Steinbach, Hines' global chief investment officer, didn't mince words when describing the overall real-estate environment.\n\n\"It's been a really bad few years, honestly,\" Steinbach told me. \"Really beginning in 2022.\"\n\nRising geopolitical tensions and the siloing of regions can make the environment even trickier. Especially for a company with over $90 billion of assets across 30 countries. Still, Steinbach told me that Hines raised about 50% more discretionary capital year over year in 2025.\n\n\"There's a risk and opportunity, right? The risk is it's now different. And that's probably not changing anytime soon,\" Steinbach said. \"The opportunity is a lot needs to be built now, because you've got supply chains that need to get re-looked. You got very directive investments in-country.\"\n\n\"That's creating a lot of demand as well,\" Steinbach added.\n\nOn the schedule for Wednesday: Citadel CEO Ken Griffin, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates, Nvidia chief Jensen Huang, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks, and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff.\n\nTrump ran into some travel trouble en route to Davos late Tuesday. He was forced to switch from Air Force One to a backup plane after an electrical fault was detected on board. Flight maps show Air Force One making a U-turn over the waters off Long Island, then landing back in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe president is now back on the road and on his way to Switzerland.",

    "fullText": "A PGA Tour veteran has sent a jolt through the golf world with a candid take on LIV Golf’s ripple effect. While many criticize LIV Golf and the professionals who play in it, Tom Hoge doesn’t. The reason – the Saudi-backed league has helped him financially in a unique way.\n\n“Well, I would say personally speaking, I’m probably the player that’s benefited absolutely the most from LIV coming along. I played well in 2022 right before LIV got going, which brought an offer from LIV, so I went down that road for a little bit. But, sticking with the PGA Tour and the changes they made, I’ve played in every signature event since they were established. And I would say nobody’s benefited more financially than I have cuz I’ve played well in some of those events and been in all of them,” Tom Hoge revealed in conversation with Trey Wingo.\n\n“So, it’s been fantastic for me. So, I shouldn’t be the guy here, complaining about any of that coming along. But it is tough for the game of golf that there’s a lot of great players that are on LIV that we’re not competing with against every week like we were.”\n\nThe 36-year-old PGA Tour professional from Statesville, North Carolina, stated that LIV’s inception has brought him financial benefits. However, he is not the only one. Many professionals on the PGA Tour have benefited indirectly from LIV’s inception. As former CEO Greg Norman highlighted, the Saudi-backed league disrupted the market, which was essential to restoring balance.\n\nBefore LIV’s arrival, the prize pools for PGA Tour events weren’t that large. And there weren’t many additional benefits that athletes enjoy today. For instance, the PGA Tour started its for-profit entity and offered equity stakes to golfers. The standard prize pool on the PGA Tour was around $8-$9 million. Then came LIV Golf, offering $20-$25 million per event. This put pressure on the PGA Tour to pay golfers more.\n\nThus, the PGA Tour started elevating events in 2023, which officially became the Signature Events in 2024. These events feature higher prize money of around $20 million or more.\n\nSince Tom Hoge performed well in 2022, he has been eligible to play Signature Events until now. In 2025, too, he was eligible for and played all Signature Events. He posted strong results in many of them, including T8 at The Sentry ($550,000), T3 at THE PLAYERS Championship ($1,325,000), T5 at Valero Texas Open ($304,000), T14 at the Masters ($336,000), and T7 at the Memorial ($603,200). These finishes underscore his claim of major financial gains from post-LIV Tour upgrades.\n\nIn 2024, he also finished strongly at many events. Hoge received $642,500 at the 2024 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am, $646,000 at the 2024 The Genesis Invitational, $389,666 at the 2024 Arnold Palmer Invitational, and $1,160,000 at the Travelers Championship. This shows that a large part of his official money came from the Signature events in both 2024 and 2025.\n\nWhile he enjoys the financial benefits, he also misses playing with some of the best golfers. Playing against strong competitors makes an athlete strong. Jon Rahm, Bryson DeChambeau, Joaquin Niemann, and Patrick Reed are some of the many gold golfers playing LIV Golf. Their exclusion from PGA Tour events influences the field’s strength, which also impacts the OWGR points.\n\nAlthough Tom Hoge is happy with almost every change the PGA Tour has gone through after LIV’s inception, he dislikes one thing that may come from 2027.\n\nTiger Woods’s Future Competition Committee (FCC) planned for a redesigned schedule from 2027. The new schedule will likely feature fewer events and may start in February instead of January. Woods and the FCC aim to mitigate viewership competition from the NFL in January. CEO Brian Rolapp supports this view and the redesigned schedule. However, Tom Hoge doesn’t.\n\nHoge told Golf Channel the pre-LIV model worked well. It allowed players to pick events freely with equal stature throughout the season. He praised past flexibility where stars like Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson elevated chosen events without a rigid top-heavy structure. If the redesigned schedule reduces the number of events, it will take away this flexibility. Therefore, Hoge opposed a reduced schedule. Instead, he valued the ability to take a month off or play four straight weeks.\n\nTom Hoge’s comments highlight how LIV Golf’s arrival reshaped his financial outlook while also changing the competitive feel of the PGA Tour. As golf moves toward another possible shift, his perspective reflects both gratitude for new opportunities and concern for what may be lost.\n\nThe post Greg Norman Was Right All Along as PGA Tour Champ Owns Up to Benefiting from LIV Golf appeared first on EssentiallySports.",

    "description": "In a client-server world, identity and authority are anchored in a server that logs people in and enforces\npermissions. When you take the server away, though, it might seem like there’s no solid foundation for\nauthentication or authorization. Is there a principled way to establish trust in a distributed application?",
    "fullText": "When I first started thinking about authentication and authorization in a local-first context I\nfound it super weird and confusing, like I’d stepped through the looking-glass. I found myself\nwrestling with big philosophical questions like “where does authority ultimately come from?” and\n“what does it mean to know someone?“.\n\nI’m going to walk you through my journey, from that initial disorientation to what I believe are\nsolid, principled approaches, in the course of developing the @localfirst/auth library.\n\nIt might not be obvious why this might be disorienting, so I’ll explain.\n\nWithout a server, it’s not clear where authority or identity come from.\n\nTraditional authentication and authorization ultimately “root out” in a physical piece of hardware,\nowned and controlled by a company that you’ve decided to trust. The hardware is a server that has\nyour username and password and rules about what you’re allowed to do. It might be controlled by your\nemployer, or a SaaS provider, or a big tech company.\n\nThe server is like a guard at the castle gates. If the server doesn’t recognize you, it doesn’t let\nyou in. If the server doesn’t think you should be allowed to have something, it doesn’t give it to\nyou.\n\nOf course, the whole point of local-first software is that we don’t love that arrangement.\n\nBut when you take away that central server, you’re losing the thing that all our notions of security\nare anchored to.\n\nIf all you have is clients, who are peers — which means they relate to each other as equals — then\nhow do we know who is who? How do we know who to trust? What do permissions even mean — who exactly\nis “giving permission”?\n\n“Bootstrapping” has become a word that we associate with something as easy and routine as turning\nyour computer on. But the whole point of bootstrapping as a metaphor is that it’s supposed to be\nimpossible: You can’t lift yourself up by pulling on your bootstraps.\n\nIt’s like living in a monarchy and realizing that the king is just another person, and not someone\nappointed by the gods. Just like countries making that transition from monarchy to democracy, we’re\nsuddenly adrift, and have to come up with completely new arrangements to solve problems that were\nalready solved — even if in a suboptimal way.\n\nWithout a server, it feels like we’re having to pull ourselves up by our bootstraps on some\nfundamental questions:\n\nIn 2020, a couple of weeks into the pandemic, I started work on a library that became\nlocalfirst/auth.\n\nI had to learn about modern cryptography starting from zero.\n\nI was immediately fascinated by how empowering public-key cryptography is, in the sense that it\ncan put me on an equal footing with even very powerful adversaries.\n\nThe movies would lead you to believe that defeating encryption is something a dude in a hoodie can\ndo just by typing really hard.\n\nBut in the real world strong cryptography can’t be defeated.* It just\ncan’t.**\n\nHere is legendary cryptologist and mathematician Daniel J. Bernstein writing over a decade\nago:\n\nFor most cryptographic operations, there exist widely accepted primitives that have been\nextensively studied, and breaking them is considered computationally infeasible on any existing\ncomputer cluster.\n\nThe point is you don’t need a lot of money, or computing power, or specialized equipment. Strong\nencryption doesn’t cost any more than weak encryption. It doesn’t cost any more to use a long\nencryption key than a short one. It’s just math. It’s just code.\n\nSo anyway I’m sitting down to work on this, and the first thing that makes my head spin is, how do\nyou know you’re talking to?\n\nWhen we collaborate or communicate online using a traditional cloud-based platform, we can think of\nthe service provider as vouching for us — introducing us to other people and confirming our\nidentity.\n\nIf I’m using Slack to talk to you, you know it’s me because Slack says it’s me, and you trust Slack.\nAnd maybe Slack knows it’s me because I logged in with Google: Google vouched for me, and Slack\ntrusts Google.\n\nIf we don’t want to put our trust in a centralized third party, then who will vouch us?\n\nIn a system where everyone’s a peer, then maybe peers could vouch for peers, in some kind of chain\nof trust.\n\nBut that chain has to be anchored somewhere: Maybe Charlie vouches for Bob to Alice, but who vouches\nfor Charlie?\n\nIgnoring the infinite regress problem for the moment, it seems clear that the solution will be\nsomething something public-key cryptography. But to do public-key cryptography, you need to know\npeople’s public keys.\n\n”Crypto is a tool for turning a whole swathe of problems into key management problems. Key\nmanagement problems are way harder than virtually all cryptographers think.”\n\n— Dr. Lea Kissner\n\nDr. Kissner was the head of information security at Twitter and I don’t think they meant the above\ntweet to be encouraging.\n\nBut I do find it encouraging. Even granting that key management is a hard problem, the idea that you\ncan collapse lots of different problems into this one problem is exciting, because you just have to\nfocus on solving that thing. If you can succeed at the key management thing — it’s is a big if — but\nif you can, then you can solve this “whole swathe of problems.”\n\nSo how do we learn people’s public keys?\n\nHere in Spain, I can obtain a certificate from the treasury department to install in my browser,\nwhich allows me to transparently authenticate to government websites and sign official documents\ndigitally.\n\nThe most obvious solution is to have some trusted party keep a directory of people and their public\nkeys, and of course that’s totally a thing that exists.\n\nThe certificate authorities (CAs) that make secure https connections possible are an example. Some\nbig companies have their own certificate authorities to anchor their employees’ digital identities.\nAnd countries can do the same for residents.\n\nThis is what my public PGP\nkey looks\nlike.\n\nBut we’re trying to do this without depending on centralized services.\n\nIf you want a decentralized solution, the alternative seems to be for people to actively share their\nown keys directly with each other.\n\nThis was the approach taken by PGP (“Pretty Good Privacy”) in the 1990s.\n\nPGP was the first encryption toolset intended for ordinary users. The idea was that people would put\ntheir public keys on their websites and in their email signatures. Apparently there were key signing\nparties where people exchanged and signed each other’s keys.\n\nFrom the looks of it these parties were lit.🥳\n\nIn 2014, Keybase had a better idea: People can just post their public keys in\nmachine-readable form on public sites where they have accounts, like Twitter or GitHub. They called\nthese “social proofs”. Then anyone can look up a person’s public keys by username, and use them to\nverify their identity.\n\nI’ve used Keybase to “verify myself” by posting machine-readable statements on\nTwitter,\nGitHub, and\nReddit\n\nThe first applications to truly bring end-to-end encryption to the masses were messaging apps. The\nSignal protocol came out in 2013, and two years later WhatsApp brought it to their entire customer\nbase, and overnight about a billion people were using encrypted messaging. Since then WhatsApp’s\nuser base grew to two billion and then to three billion, making it one of the most widely used\ncommunication tools in all of human history.\n\nThis succeeded because they made encryption transparent to the user. The key insight is that a\npublic key will never be like an email or a telephone number. It’s not a stable component of our\ndigital identity. Wrangling encryption keys is a job for computers, not for people. Devices should\njust generate keys as needed and we should never see them or have to think about them. Private keys\nshould never leave the device, and public keys should be shared automatically with other devices.\n\nWe’re agreed, then, that device-to-device sharing of keys is better than key signing parties. But\nAlice’s device still needs to know that Bob’s device is really Bob’s device, and not Eve’s device\npretending to be Bob’s device.\n\nTOFU considered squishy. Image: Yoav Aziz\n\nWhatsApp and Signal take an approach called “Trust On First Use”, or TOFU. Here’s how that works:\n\nThere’s a little risk there, they’re both taking a little leap of faith, but it’s a one-time thing,\nit’s probably fine.\n\nThat seems reasonable. The problem, though, is that the “first use” bit is kind of misleading,\nbecause in practice TOFU doesn’t happen just once.\n\nRemember, the keys we care about are device-level keys, not user-level keys. So what happens when\nBob gets a new phone, or Alice reinstalls the software on her laptop?\n\nWhat happens is an “account reset”, and at that point we’re back to TOFU — except that now, the\nattack scenarios are a bit more plausible: an impostor might have engineered the reset, and it would\nbe more feasible to exploit it.\n\nWhen a user has an account reset, the messaging apps suggest to everyone they communicate with that\nthey compare “security codes” or “safety numbers”. Most users don’t do this — I never have, I can’t\nimagine that people less technical than me do this.\n\nAnd anyway this is bad enough for a single pairwise connection; where this all really falls apart is\nin a large group, where the number of pairwise connections scales exponentially with the size of the\ngroup.\n\nWith a balanced PAKE, both parties need to know the password.\n\nSo when you want to connect with someone and don’t know their public key, is there an alternative to\nTOFU for securing that initial connection?\n\nThe most promising approach is to first share a single-use password out of band (in person, or via a\nchannel you already trust). There is whole a family of cryptographic protocols that support this,\ncalled PAKEs (for “password-authenticated key exchange”).\n\nWe’re saying “password” but it’s generally presented as an invitation code.\n\nIn the most common forms, both parties need to know the secret code; this is called a balanced\nPAKE.\n\nThe downside is that the inviter and invitee need to connect directly to validate the invitation.\n\nWith an asymmetric PAKE, a third party can verify the password without knowing it.\n\nWith an asymmetric PAKE (asymmetric because the verifier doesn’t need to know the password) a\nthird party can validate an invitation code without knowing it in advance or asking for it.\n\nThis brings us back to Keybase. In 2017 or so, they decided to try to monetize by building a\nSlack-but-encrypted thing for enterprise customers. They quickly realized that even if the global\nnerd population thought the idea of putting your public key on Twitter was really cool, Jim in\nAccounts Payable is probably just not going to do that. Sorry, it’s just not going to happen.\n\nSo they needed a way to bootstrap that initial key exchange, and they proposed something called a\nSeitan Token Exchange (presumably “seitan” because it’s not as\nsoft as tofu).\n\nThis is the approach I stole for localfirst/auth. At the time I didn’t know a PAKE from a hole in\nthe ground, but as it turns out this is essentially an asymmetric PAKE.\n\nWe’ve been talking about “identity”; but the beauty of this approach is that identity doesn’t need\nto mean “who you are in the world”, in the sense of linking to your real name or email or whatever —\nit can just mean “who you are to me“.\n\nRather than linking identity to a name or an email address, we link it to a relationship.\n\nFor example, in Ink & Switch’s Backchannel project one\nof the motivating use cases was connecting an anonymous source to a journalist. With a system like\nthis the source doesn’t have to have a name at all; the only thing that matters is that they’re able\nto interact once.\n\nTrust and identity are ultimately rooted in real-world relationships and interactions between human\nbeings. I know you because we interact, whether that’s face-to-face or online. That’s what it\nmeans to “know” someone. And we can use that interaction to bootstrap cryptographically secure\nconnections going forward. And if you have those secure connections with other people and I trust\nyou, I can benefit from your connections, and so on, forming a network of trust relationships.\n\nThat helps us clear up our thinking about identity:\n\nA. Real-world human interactions and relationships.\n\nThis feels correct to me: It’s natural, human-scale, and rooted in social reality.\n\nThe server-centric model roots our identity in getting distant corporations to vouch for us.\n\nWith this model, instead can we vouch for ourselves:\n\nAnd we can vouch for each other:\n\nIs it possible to have a secure, distributed access control list?\n\nSo now I have a way of knowing it’s you. But how do I know if you’re on my team? How do I know if I\nshould share this document with you, or if you should be able to edit it?\n\nOn a server this information is often recorded in some kind of access control list (ACL). So\nmaybe we need that, but distributed — everybody needs a copy of the same list. How would that work?\n\nMy first thought was that we could just put this information in an Automerge document and replicate\nit across everyone’s devices that way. But we can’t just let anyone edit this document at will. It\nshould be obvious if anyone changes the permissions, and we need to know who changed the\npermissions, and if they … had permission to do so? Do we need an ACL for the ACL?\n\nLet’s ignore that rabbit hole of infinite regress for the moment and focus on the mechanics. We need\na way of replicating a document that is:\n\n✅ tamper-evident: it shouldn’t be possible for someone to surreptitiously modify the list\n\n✅ eventually consistent: everybody should have the same list\n\n✅ authenticated: we need to know who has written changes to the list\n\nSo let’s look at some options for data structures.\n\nWhen we say “tamper-resistant” the first thing you might think of is a hash chain (or\nblockchain), where each link contains a cryptographic hash of the previous link, so it’s\nimpossible to modify one link or change the order without breaking the chain.\n\nThe problem is that this chain needs to be linear. Replicating it while ensuring consistency\nrequires enforcing a strict ordering; and cryptocurrency blockchains are famously … not optimized\nfor efficiency.\n\nTo accomplish this without burning enough fossil fuels to power multiple small countries, we could\nuse a hash graph. A hash graph is a hash chain plus branching. A CRDT like Automerge combines a\nhash graph with automatic conflict resolution logic to support replication with eventual\nconsistency. Git works the same way but with manual conflict resolution.\n\n✅ tamper-evident\n\n✅ eventually consistent\n\nSo far so good. But we still need a way of verifying who made which changes to our distributed\naccess control list.\n\nA signature graph is a hash graph where the individual operations are signed by the author. This\ngives us all three things.\n\n✅ tamper-evident\n\n✅ eventually consistent\n\n✅ authenticated\n\nIf you look at the work of anyone who’s trying to tackle this problem, you’re going to see some kind\nof signature graph: the Matrix protocol,\nDXOS’s HALO, Fission’s\nUCANs, etc. It’s a case of convergent evolution — we’ve all more\nor less independently landed on this data structure.\n\nThe way this works, concretely, is that there’s a series of operations on the group:\n\nThe first link, the root of the chain, marks the creation of the group and by definition adds\nthe founder to the group as an admin. It also includes the founder’s public keys.\n\nEach subsequent link represents an administrative action such as inviting a member, removing a\nmember, promoting a member to admin (or another role), or demoting a member.\n\nEach link contains a cryptographic hash of the preceding link, so the order of the links\ncannot be altered.\n\nEach link contains a digital signature of its content by the member making the change, so that\nits authenticity can be independently verified, and so that the link body cannot be tampered with.\n\nWhen I found a group, I am the only member and the only authority. I can decide to add members, and\nI can decide to delegate authority to them as well. Another member with admin authority could even\nremove me from the group.\n\nThis is a key point that we’ll come back to: In a group, authority is rooted in the act of\ncreating the group.\n\nTo be replicable, this data structure needs to be a CRDT. However, you can’t model group permissions\nusing a JSON CRDT like Automerge. I’ll explain why.\n\nHere we have two concurrent actions, but there’s no conflict, and we can resolve this by picking one\nor the other in an arbitrary but deterministic order. So far, nothing a generic CRDT couldn’t handle.\n\nWhat if someone takes actions while concurrently being removed? For example, what if Bob adds\nCharlie to the group and concurrently, Alice removes Bob from the group? Now we have a conflict.\n\nQ. Is Charlie in the group or not?\n\nIt’s important to resolve this correctly, or else Bob could circumvent his removal by writing a\nconcurrent operation adding proxy-Bob to the group.\n\nA: No. Removals always take precedence. We resolve that conflict by prioritizing removals. A\ngeneric CRDT like Automerge won’t be able to resolve this conflict in a principled way; it won’t\neven see it as a conflict. So this has to be implemented as a custom CRDT engine.\n\nWhat if two admins remove each other concurrently? (Or more generally, what if there’s a cycle of\nconcurrent removals?)\n\nAs a scenario involving two legitimate members of the group, this is far-fetched and unlikely to\nhappen. A more realistic and worrying scenario might be, for example, a compromised and revoked\ndevice trying to undo its revocation.\n\nOption 1: Remove both The logical conclusion of “removals take precedence” is to remove both.\n\nHowever, this seems unlikely to be the correct way of resolving the issue. It leaves Charlie\norphaned in a group without admins and creates an opening for a denial-of-service attack, where a\nrogue device blows up the group rather than allowing itself to be removed.\n\nOption 2: Fork the group Another approach is to “fork the world” into two parallel versions of\nthe same group: one where Alice stays and one where Bob stays. Then each member decides which world\nthey want to live in. This reflects the reality of a decentralized system.\n\nI suspect that in practice it’d be hard to communicate what’s going on to most users, and it would\njust be confusing and upsetting.\n\nI call option 2 the “Papal Schism” approach, in honor of the time when there were two popes and all of\nCatholic Christendom had to decide which one to follow.\n\nOption 3: Keep the senior member The solution I settled on is to let seniority be a proxy for\nwho is more likely to be in the right. In this case, Alice has been in the group longer than Bob, so\nshe stays.\n\nThe key insight for me was that the root node of a signature graph gives you an anchor for\nauthority. If I create a group, by definition I get to decide who’s in it.\n\nAt the moment of creation, Alice is the absolute dictator of a group with no other members: Alice\ndecides who to add to the group. Alice decides if she wants to delegate her authority to other\nmembers. She can make everyone else an admin too.\n\nThis delegates the right to remove anyone, including herself, from the group. But even once she’s\ngone, the authority behind any action — any addition or removal of members, any further delegation\nof authority — can always be traced back to the authority inherent in her act of creation.\n\nWe started with two big questions about how we find our footings in a local-first world.\n\nThe Seitan protocol that I decided to use, like any other flavor of PAKE, is complex and involves\nmany cryptographic subtleties. But any invitation protocol, no matter how involved, has something\nvery simple at its core: An interaction that takes place in the context of some existing\nrelationship.\n\nIn the beginning there was a relationship.\n\nAt first, it felt like cheating, or a cop-out, to rely on a “pre-existing trusted side channel” to\ntransmit this invitation. But it’s not at all. And it’s not a minor thing or an implementation\ndetail either — in fact, it’s the core of this whole thing.\n\nHow does Alice know it’s Bob? Because Alice and Bob had that interaction where Alice communicated\nthe invitation code to him, and Bob is able to prove that he’s the one she had that interaction\nwith.\n\nThe fact that this pre-existing channel exists at all is very significant; it only exists because\nthere is some kind of pre-existing relationship between Alice and Bob in the real world.\n\nSo, that’s our answer: preexisting human interactions and relationships are what anchor\nidentity.\n\nWhen you found a company, you decide who you want to invite to work with you. Depending on how you\nset things up, you might end up being removed from the company later on. But the authority to do\nthat can ultimately be traced back to delegations of authority you made.\n\nWhen you start any kind of project, you decide who you want to go on that journey with you, or if\nyou want to go it alone.\n\nWhen you begin writing a document, you don’t have to share it with anyone - you could keep it to\nyourself forever. If you do share it, the details are up to you: Do you share it with the whole\nworld? Just with your team? Just with one person? Whose input will you pay attention to?\n\nNone of this gives you any power over anyone outside the context of the thing you created: They can\nchoose whether to accept, and they can stop collaborating with you at any time.\n\nIt only recently occurred to me that authority and authorship come from the same root word.\n\nAuthority is rooted in authorship, in the act of creation.\n\nSo. These are the answers I’ve found to our big questions. I think they’re good answers. As it\nturns out, not only you can anchor decentralized security on something solid, but the foundation\nwe’ve found is something more legitimate, more satisfying, more human than a distant company’s\n“because I said so”.\n\nIf you’re looking to secure a local-first application, take a look at my\n@localfirst/auth library, which is a working\nimplementation of these ideas, including an auth provider for integration with\nautomerge-repo.\n\nAt some point in the process of creating localfirst/auth, I realized that I’d made a custom CRDT; so\nI extracted the machinery for creating, validating, and interpreting signature chains into the\nCRDX package. This can be used on\nits own to create an encrypted, authenticated CRDT with bespoke conflict detection and resolution\nlogic.\n\nIf you take any of this out for a spin — or if you have questions about how it works — please get in\ntouch with me — via one of the (pre-existing, trusted) channels listed below!\n\nThis library’s shape emerged from a series of conversations early on with Peter Van\nHardenberg of Ink & Switch. Peter drilled\ninto my head the idea that device keys should be generated locally and never leave the device, and\npointed me towards Keybase’s signature chains.\n\nMartin Kleppmann of Cambridge University has been very generous\nwith his time and expertise. Martin is the creator of\nAutomerge and co-author with Peter of Ink & Switch’s\nlocal-first manifesto. Much of localfirst/auth is an\nexpression in code of his theoretical work. Every time I’ve been stuck on something, Martin has\nco-written a paper that solves that exact thing. These two papers were particularly helpful:",

    "fullText": "When I swapped my iPhone for a Nokia, Walkman, film camera and physical map, I wasn’t sure what to expect. But my life soon started to change\n\nWhen two balaclava-clad men on a motorbike mounted the pavement to rob me, recently, I remained oblivious. My eyes were pinned to a text message on my phone, and my hands were so clawed around it that they didn’t even bother to grab it. It wasn’t until an elderly woman shrieked and I felt the whoosh of air as the bike launched back on to the road that I looked up at all. They might have been unsuccessful but it did make me think: what else am I missing from the real world around me?\n\nBefore I’ve poured my first morning coffee I’ve already watched the lives of strangers unfold on Instagram, checked the headlines, responded to texts, swiped through some matches on a dating app, and refreshed my emails, twice. I check Apple Maps for my quickest route to work. I’ve usually left it too late to get the bus, so I rent a Lime bike using the app. During the day, my brother sends me some memes, I take a picture of a canal boat, and pay for my lunch on Apple Pay. I walk home listening to music on Spotify and a long voice note from a friend, then I watch a nondescript TV drama, while scrolling through Depop and Vinted for clothes.\n\nI’m constantly contactable, I have no personal boundaries, and my attention span disappeared a long time ago. Since the first iPhone in 2007, smartphones have become indispensable to modern life, with the average person in the UK spending four hours and 20 minutes online per day. “Social media provides frictionless access to an infinite universe of mostly free digital drugs,” says Anna Lembke, author of Dopamine Nation. “And the algorithm tailors the experience for each unique brain, making it very reinforcing, while also injecting just enough novelty in the infinite scroll to overcome boredom and tolerance. All these features combined keep us clicking and swiping long after we want to.” Over time we develop tolerance, which means “we need more of it and a more potent form to get the same effect.”\n\nIncreased screen time has been associated with depression, anxiety and poorer sleep. But is it possible to live lo-fi in a hi-tech world? For a month, I tried: swapping my iPhone for a Nokia which I can only use to text, call and play Snake; also, a Walkman and a film camera. I picked up physical copies of books, newspapers and magazines; I used a London A-Z for directions, and hunted down my physical bank cards or tried to use cash. The only screen time exception was for work, where from 9-5 I used my laptop to respond to emails and write.\n\n“You’re going to look like such a performative hipster,” my flatmate Ben says, as I’m setting up my new devices. He’s right. I leave the Walkman behind, but my bag is still heavier than usual with my book, notepad, A-Z and wallet. I haven’t taken the bus into work yet from my new home so I follow a hand-drawn map to the stop and run for a bus. I stupidly didn’t write down the bus number but that one sounds familiar. It’s not the one, two friendly strangers tell me, but I can swap on to another at Angel. “We’ve outsourced our memory to our phones,” says Nicholas Kardaras, author of Digital Madness and a former assistant clinical professor of psychology at Stony Brook University, New York. “And unfortunately the ease and comfort of being lubricated by technology just means our human skills atrophied. It is use it or lose it.”\n\nThe bus is crawling. Normally, I would have looked up a different route. I try to message a friend back but it’s difficult having to click each button multiple times for the letter I want. “Hard work,” I manage. I read for the rest of the journey.\n\nOn my lunch break, my sister and I go for a walk around the park. When she leaves me to do another lap, I have an urge to check Instagram and my emails but I’m only getting the odd SMS. I’m craving the back-and-forth WhatsApps with friends telling me fun facts about their day. I feel a little unsettled, but I try to focus on the changing leaves on the trees. I have thoughts that wouldn’t usually have the time to surface. How stressful.\n\nAfter work, I go to see the saxophone player cktrl at the ICA. I’m a little worried about collecting the tickets without access to the Dice app I bought them on, but I show them my passport instead. I would normally join the throngs of people filming a song or two, so I could upload some blurred clips with poor sound to social media to show that I had a great time. But I can’t, so I watch him play, undistracted. Then a flashlight glares behind me, as someone films an entire track. I vow never to be that annoying person again.\n\nMy digital detox is starting to stress out my friends. Nicole finally gets through to me, saying: “I hate your dumb phone.” She’s been texting, but didn’t realise you had to click twice to make it send as an SMS not an iMessage. Another friend wants to share a dating story and texts: “Omg this is a terrible time not to access voice note.” And, when my landlord messages asking us to send pictures of the new carpet on WhatsApp, which I can’t do, Ben texts: “You’re going to be such a liability this month.”\n\nIn the evening, my date sends me the address of a pub to meet him at “for your A-Z”. I allow lots of time to decipher its tiny font and navigate my way there. He’s running late, so I sit by the fireplace in the pub and read my book. I look like I’m waiting for someone to chat me up. When he arrives, he shows me how to turn on predictive text, which is a relief for my very tired thumbs.\n\nAt lunchtime, I put on the terrestrial TV and watch Escape to the Country, where I learn about the housing market in Herefordshire. I want to cook myself an elaborate meal – for dinner, and also for entertainment, but when I get to the shops, I remember that I can’t look up a recipe on my phone, so I settle for tomato pasta.\n\nMy flatmate picked up a Nina Simone CD for me in a charity shop. I try to play it on my Walkman, but realise it needs batteries. On my lunch break I buy some (who knew there were so many sizes?) and walk home from the office listening to it. Spotify can be overwhelming with its hundred million tracks, so it’s nice to remove the element of choice and focus on the album as it was intended, not scrambled by shuffle mode. Rosanna Irwin, who runs Samsú – a collection of digital detox cabins in Ireland – knows the importance of analogue listening: she leaves her guests with cassette tapes she makes with her father. After reaching a state of burnout, working long hours in tech – first at Meta and later for a climate tech company – she visited the Danish island of Samsø with her husband in 2023, and found peace amid the scrappy phone service and incredible nature.\n\n“My mental health was very poor,” she says. “I was spending a lot of time online and I did an accidental digital detox on this island and came back invigorated from the experience.” She recommends a three-day retreat. “There’s a lot of science to show that it’s around 72 hours in nature where the true magic starts to happen.”\n\nI meet my friend at Vauxhall station, and we walk to a cafe for breakfast, then to Tate Britain. Camilla is pretty offline: she’s a doctor and doesn’t have social media. She rarely responds to texts and is maybe one of the most joyful people I know. But she says she feels so much guilt about not replying sooner and hates the fact that phones are like this ever-present person in the room, distracting you from being totally engaged with the real-life friends around you.The sentiment resonates with me; we both want to be more spontaneous.\n\nInspired by our conversation, I call Aakriti, who doesn’t live too far away. I meet her and two of her friends and we eat empanadas. On the way home, I have to ask the only man on the platform for help. The overground isn’t due for 24 minutes, so I wonder if there is a faster route. There isn’t, so I shiver at the outdoor station wishing I could book an Uber.\n\nIt’s tipping down with rain when I arrive at Canada Water, and I don’t want to ruin my A-Z to search for Rotherhithe Street. I know The Mayflower pub is on the river and ask a man at a convenience store to point me in the right direction. I’m early, so I squint at my book in the candle-lit pub, feeling very Victorian. There’s a hilarious waiter, who is telling dating stories from Grindr, and it’s much better than my book. This no-technology thing is making me nosy. I pay for my roast with cash, which feels almost fake now, like I’m in a game. Then my friend and I go to the cinema – the Picturehouse in central London, because it’s in between where we both live. They charge us £20 for a ticket, which I would never have paid had I known before we made the trip. I’m left fuming, but luckily the movie is good.\n\nI need to call the bank. My flatmate has sent rent money to my Monzo account, which I can only access on the app, and I get a text saying that I’ve gone into an unarranged overdraft. When I get to the tube in the morning, my Oyster card has run out, so I top up the credit and miss my train – I would usually have used a payment card on Apple Pay instead. I have to wait eight minutes for the next one. I’m flustered by the time I get to the office and feel stressed about not being able to check how much money is in my account or transfer money between accounts.\n\nThere’s a group of children on a school trip on my train. The teacher is trying to keep them entertained by getting them to play a word association game. “When I say ‘bread’,” she says. “You could say, ‘sandwich’. Let’s have a go. ‘School,’” the teacher says. “Prison,” a child shouts back. When I arrive in Notting Hill, I study the map at the station to make sure I surface from the correct exit. I memorise key landmarks so I know where to turn – the Gate Cinema is by the road I need to get to Uxbridge Street. I’m late, and don’t have time for mistakes, so I start walking down the street quickly, scouring every restaurant until I find the Palestinian cafe I’m looking for.\n\nThe worries I felt at the start of the experiment about getting lost and not being able to communicate with friends seem to have diminished. I’m calmer, and present when I’m with people. I look around the train on my morning commute and notice that everyone except one person has their eyes glued to their phones. The man opposite me doesn’t have earphones, a phone or a book. I try not to catch his eye, as I’m worried I’ve been staring. Things are less relaxed when I try to meet my friend Navid after work. We can’t pick a place to meet and he is frustrated because he can’t send me links: “Please return to WhatsApp you Neanderthal.” He’s late, so I wait outside the station for 45 minutes. He arrives with a big grin, knowing I’m a bit irritated, but I get my own back by torturing him with two hours of experimental jazz.\n\nAfter work, I go to see my friend Scarlett, who is being held captive by a corgi puppy. It’s dark and damp when I arrive in south-east London but I’ve written out the directions to the house as carefully as I can. I didn’t bring my A-Z because my bag was too heavy, but I’m certain I can’t mess up the 10-minute walk. I call my mum and we natter for 20 minutes before I realise I haven’t spotted the turning. In a panic, I ask her to look up my location on Google Maps, which is obviously cheating, but I’m now late and in the middle of a cemetery. I’ve gone completely the wrong way and she has to narrate the route to my destination.\n\nIt’s been a busy weekend so far and I feel like having a lazy day. I walk to a yoga class and then go for a wander. As I’m walking, and listening to my one CD, I get a call from the guy I’m dating who has just finished work. We try to hunt down a board game to play, but when the local charity shops fail us, we pick up some newspapers and magazines and the ingredients for a roast chicken instead. We then sit on the sofa playing music and reading in the old fashioned way. It feels like we’ve retired.\n\nI finally get around to calling the bank to pay my rent, which is late for the first time. I’ve been putting off the inevitable 20-minute call that includes reading out lots of sort codes and bank numbers and spelling the names of my landlord along with the various friends I owe money to. It’s quite unnerving transferring money without checking the details with my own eyes, and the woman on the phone keeps telling me that it would be much easier to do this online.\n\nFor all the frustrations of the month, I’m sad the experiment is over. I’m left with the feeling that living offline puts other people out: if we’re looking for a place to eat or a pub to go to it’s down to them, they’re on map duty, and I’m not able to book Ubers. But I was happier and calmer – relieved of the endless scrolling, waiting for texts back, and the need to communicate with people all the time. After about a week, I wasn’t reaching for my phone and I had the patience to read. It was nice not to be able to look at my work emails in the evening. I’m determined to delete my main distractions: Depop, Hinge and Instagram. Scouring charity shops for clothes is much more satisfying; dating with no distractions is so much easier; and I can live without reels about botched Botox and AI animals. “Big tech platforms are not addictive accidentally, they’re addictive by design,” says Kardaras. “They’re selling their product by targeting the vulnerable: if the algorithm detects that a young person has a body image issue or is struggling with self-harm or depression, then they bombard them with content on that subject that exacerbates their mental unwellness.” On my last day, I get an email from Scarlett: “Splashed my phone with water whilst listening to the Lily Allen album in the bath, now phoneless and actually want to copy you.” It seems I’m not the only one keen to disconnect.",

    "description": "A new report warns the U.S. could lose the ability to sustain combat within weeks of a China war over Taiwan, as munitions run dry, logistics collapse and global markets face a $10T shock.",
    "fullText": "FIRST ON FOX: The Trump administration asked for redactions to a sweeping new Heritage Foundation report modeling a potential U.S.–China war over Taiwan, even though the analysis relied entirely on publicly available, unclassified data, according to the report’s authors.\n\nThe redacted report, TIDALWAVE, warns that the United States could reach a breaking point within weeks of a high‑intensity conflict with China — conclusions that the authors say prompted senior national security officials to seek redactions over concerns adversaries could exploit the findings or use them to identify U.S. and allied military vulnerabilities.\n\nThose conclusions include warnings that U.S. forces would culminate far sooner than China, suffer catastrophic losses to aircraft and sustainment infrastructure in the Pacific, and still fail to prevent a global economic shock estimated at roughly $10 trillion, nearly a tenth of global GDP.\n\nSKIES AT STAKE: INSIDE THE US-CHINA RACE FOR AIR DOMINANCE\n\nAccording to the report's authors, the AI‑enabled model drew exclusively on open‑source government, academic, industry and commercial information. An unredacted version of the report was provided to authorized U.S. government recipients for internal use.\n\nUnlike traditional tabletop war games, TIDALWAVE employs an AI‑enabled model that runs thousands of iterations, tracking how losses in platforms, munitions, and fuel compound over time and drive cascading operational failure early in the conflict.\n\nAccording to a Heritage spokesperson, the report had been shown to \"high-level national security officials\" who requested some of the specifics be crossed out in black ink before its release to the public. The report still details how quickly U.S. forces could reach a breaking point and why the conflict would carry global consequences.\n\n\"Redactions were made at the request of the U.S. government to prevent disclosure of information that could reasonably enable an adversary to (1) re mediate or ‘close’ critical vulnerabilities that the United States and its allies could otherwise exploit, or (2) identify or exploit U.S. and allied vulnerabilities in ways that could degrade operational endurance, resilience, or deterrence,\" the report said.\n\nA Department of War spokesperson declined to comment on discussions surrounding TIDALWAVE's publication, but added: \"The Department of War does not endorse, validate, or adjudicate third-party analyses, nor do we engage publicly on hypothetical conflict modeling. As a general matter, we take seriously the protection of information that, if aggregated or contextualized, could have implications for operational security.\"\n\nThe White House could not be reached for comment.\n\nAccording to the report’s redacted findings, the U.S. would culminate in less than half the time required for the People's Republic of China in a high-intensity conflict. Culmination is defined as the point at which a force becomes incapable of continuing operations due to the loss of platforms, ammunition and/or fuel.\n\nThe report is explicit that the first 30 days to 60 days of a U.S.-China war determine its long-term shape and outcome, as early losses in aircraft, ships, fuel throughput and munitions rapidly compound and cannot be recovered on operationally relevant timelines.\n\nThe report concludes that the U.S. is not equipped nor arrayed to protect and sustain the Joint Force in a conflict with China in the Indo-Pacific. Rapid platform attrition, brittle logistics, concentrated basing and insufficient industrial surge capacity combine to force an early operational breaking point for American forces.\n\nThe report warns that U.S. reliance on a few large, concentrated forward bases — particularly in Japan and Guam — leaves American airpower dangerously exposed to Chinese missile forces.\n\nIn multiple scenarios, up to 90% of U.S. and allied aircraft positioned at major forward bases are destroyed on the ground during the opening phase of the conflict, as runways, fuel depots, command facilities and parked aircraft are hit simultaneously.\n\nThe report finds that critical U.S. precision‑guided munitions — including long‑range anti‑ship missiles, air‑to‑air interceptors and missile‑defense systems — begin to be unavailable within five to seven days of major combat operations. Across most scenarios, those critical munitions are completely exhausted within 35 days to 40 days, leaving U.S. forces unable to sustain high‑tempo combat.\n\nFuel emerges as the most decisive vulnerability of all. The report makes a critical distinction: the U.S. does not run out of fuel in most scenarios — it loses the ability to move fuel under fire.\n\nCHINA’S MISSILE SURGE PUTS EVERY US BASE IN THE PACIFIC AT RISK — AND THE WINDOW TO RESPOND IS CLOSING\n\nChinese doctrine explicitly prioritizes attacks on logistics vessels, ports, pipelines and replenishment tankers. Even limited tanker losses, port disruptions or pipeline severance are sufficient to drive fuel throughput below survivable levels, forcing commanders to sharply curtail air and naval operations despite fuel remaining in aggregate stockpiles.\n\nChinese ammunition stockpiles of critical munitions begin to be depleted after approximately 20 days to 30 days of major combat operations. However, substitution effects extend China’s ability to sustain combat operations out to months — well beyond the point at which U.S. forces culminate, according to the report.\n\nThe consequences extend far beyond the battlefield.\n\nThe redacted report concludes the U.S. is highly unlikely to prevent massive global economic fallout once a Taiwan conflict begins.\n\nDisruption of shipping lanes, destruction of critical infrastructure and the collapse of Taiwan’s semiconductor production would trigger a global economic shock estimated at roughly $10 trillion, with enduring ripple effects across financial markets, manufacturing and global trade.\n\nThe report comes amid years of concern over U.S. military readiness and industrial capacity, as China rapidly expands its naval forces and shipbuilding base.\n\nThe U.S. Navy operates a smaller fleet than planned, while American shipyards face workforce shortages, aging infrastructure and chronic delays — even as China, the world’s largest shipbuilder, continues to outpace the U.S. in producing new naval hulls.\n\nWar Secretary Pete Hegseth and other military leaders have vowed to put the Pentagon on a wartime footing for industrial capacity.\n\nPerhaps most alarming, TIDALWAVE warns that the scale of losses in the Indo‑Pacific would leave the U.S. unable to deter or respond effectively to a second major conflict elsewhere in the world.\n\nA war over Taiwan could open the door to follow‑on aggression by adversaries such as Russia, Iran or North Korea, fundamentally destabilizing the global security order.\n\nThe report is blunt in its assessment: existing Pentagon programs and congressional funding are too slow, too fragmented and too modest to address the scale of the challenge. In many cases, the timeline required to fix critical vulnerabilities exceeds the likely timeline to conflict.\n\nTo avoid what the authors describe as a strategic defeat, the report urges Congress to immediately expand munitions stockpiles, strengthen fuel reserves and distribution infrastructure, harden and disperse forward bases, and accelerate sustainment and logistics reforms. Without rapid action, the authors warn, the U.S. risks entering a conflict it is structurally unprepared to fight or sustain.\n\nWith intelligence warnings mounting that China could move on Taiwan before the end of the decade, TIDALWAVE cautions that the window to correct these deficiencies may be closing faster than Washington is prepared to act.",

    "fullText": "World Cup 2026 ticket holders can now access priority visa appointments for travel to the United States - but doubt remains whether fans from every country to have qualified will be able to enter.\n\nThe Fifa Prioritised Appointment Scheduling System - or Fifa Pass - announced by US President Donald Trump in November, went live on Tuesday.\n\nIt was introduced in part because citizens of some countries whose teams have qualified for the 2026 World Cup may not otherwise receive visa appointments in time for the tournament.\n\nBut the US State Department has stressed that a Fifa Pass appointment does not guarantee a visa will be approved, with all ticket holders having to \"undergo thorough security screening and vetting\".\n\nMost citizens of countries under the US visa waiver programme, which covers much of Europe, including the UK, along with Japan, Australia and others, can ordinarily travel visa-free for up to 90 days, so do not need to use the Fifa Pass. Travellers from those countries would need to apply instead for an Esta - an Electronic System for Travel Authorization.\n\nA senior State Department official said the new Fifa Pass system will cut wait times - with applicants in \"over 80%\" of countries now able to schedule a visa appointment in \"less that 60 days\".\n\nIt added: \"At the visa appointment, the applicant must show they qualify for the visa and plan to follow our laws and leave at the end of the tournament.

    "fullText": "Nathan Aspinall has opened up about his unusual experience at the Saudi Arabia Darts Masters, admitting the crowd “weren’t all there of their own accord” even as the event made headlines for its record-breaking $200,000 nine-dart prize.\n\nAspinall’s comments highlight the cultural differences faced by the Professional Darts Corporation (PDC) as it pushes into new global markets.\n\nThe Saudi Arabia Darts Masters, held at Riyadh’s Global Theater, marked the first PDC event in the kingdom, drawing world champion Luke Littler, Luke Humphries, and Michael van Gerwen to a country with strict no-alcohol laws and a developing darts fanbase.\n\nAspinall said the experience was “certainly different” and admitted that the atmosphere felt more restrained than the usual lively darts nights in the UK or Europe.\n\n“I’m not stupid. I feel like they [the crowd] weren’t all there of their own accord, shall we say, and it was quite a small venue,” he said. “Everything needs to start somewhere, but as long as people walk away from the week and are like, ‘You know what, we really enjoyed the darts’, and it gets good coverage.”\n\nThe Englishman said he enjoyed playing despite the muted energy and found humor in the crowd’s unfamiliarity with darts’ scoring quirks, laughing with opponent Lourence Ilagan as spectators clapped at the wrong moments during his opening win.\n\nThe PDC responded by saying all attendees were legitimate ticket-holders or guests and praised the event’s turnout, noting that the atmosphere and crowd make-up can differ from long-established European tournaments.\n\nBeyond the atmosphere, the event made global headlines for offering the biggest nine-darter prize in PDC history: a staggering $200,000 (£149,400). Any player who landed a perfect leg would take home $100,000 (£74,700), doubled to $200,000 if they finished on a bullseye.\n\nThe unprecedented prize pool reflects Saudi Arabia’s growing ambition to establish itself as a hub for elite sport, with similar investments seen in golf, Formula 1, and boxing.\n\nFor the PDC, the record bonus signals an opportunity to grow the sport in new regions, even as it navigates challenges around culture and fan engagement.\n\nAspinall’s candid comments may reflect those early growing pains, but his willingness to engage and the PDC’s record incentives show darts’ global expansion is gaining serious momentum.",

    "fullText": "Liverpool have a golden opportunity to sign the next Sadio Mane.\n\nThe Senegalese international was probably one of the best players to have ever played for the club. At this peak, Mane was the epitome of Jurgen Klopp's greatest era at the club.\n\nWhen he was running at defences, you just had confidence that Liverpool were going to be able to win games consistently.\n\nMane was a special player. Someone who was selfless and who worked hard for the team but who was also capable of individual brilliance.\n\nMost importantly, he was a top professional. This was apparent in the African Cup of Nations final on Sunday night with Mane staying on the pitch during Senegal's boycott after a dubious penalty was awarded against them.\n\nUltimately, Mane convinced his players to continue the game and played a key role in creating Senegal's winner to crown himself a champion for the second time in the tournament's history.\n\nIt's a remarkable time for Senegal right now. Mane is just the leading face of a golden generation and there is so much more to come.\n\nOne of the biggest factors behind Senegal's rise to prominence has been the Generation Foot academy. This is the academy that produced Mane and which has a partnership with FC Metz.\n\nAlongside Mane, they have also developed players like Ismaila Sarr, Pape Matar Sarr, Lamine Camara and many others.\n\nThey are the leading academy in Senegal and they always have exciting gems worth keeping an eye on who are ready to follow in Mane's footsteps.\n\nWe know Liverpool like to scout in Senegal. They've just signed Mor Talla Ndiaye from a Senegalese club and are expected to sign Sidy Barhama Ndiaye from another Senegalese side.\n\nBut they should now direct their attention to Generation Foot, where there is a really exciting young player who might just be the next Mane.\n\nLet us introduce you to Sega Fall Mbodji. He's only 16-years-old but he's already a regular member of Generation Foot's first-team, who play in Senegal's top tier.\n\nMbodji became the youngest ever goal-scorer in the club's history at 15-years-old earlier this season, and he's also the fourth youngest to make an appearance for the club.\n\nAn exciting winger with great technical skills, he can play on either wing and he is a brilliant dribbler.\n\nWhat stands-out about him is his decision making and his intelligent movement, Mbodji always receives the ball facing forward and ready to attack his opponent.\n\nHe makes clever runs behind the defensive lines and has the composure to finish chances.\n\nMaking history at such an impressive club and breaking records at his age is worth taking notice.\n\nRight now he's not made his mark at international level yet so this is a golden chance for Liverpool to strike and agree a deal for him to join the Reds, before the other big clubs start to sniff around for him.",

    "fullText": "Scores of private jets landed near Davos on Monday as the rich and powerful descended on the Alpine town for the World Economic Forum's annual meeting.\n\nBusiness Insider tracked at least 157 private jets that arrived near the Alpine town, using data from ADS-B Exchange and JetSpy. These flight-tracking tools don't participate in privacy systems that many business-jet owners have signed up for to hide their movements from most similar tools.\n\nMore than half of the flights tracked landed at Zurich International Airport. Another 45 came into Friedrichshafen, a German city on the shore of Lake Constance, just over the Swiss border. The rest were spread across other smaller airports in Switzerland.\n\nThey included airplanes belonging to Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff and the former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, according to data from JetSpy.\n\nJetSpy also showed numerous companies' private jets arriving in the area, including those of Aramco, BlackRock, Blackstone, Citigroup, Google, HP, JPMorgan Chase, Lockheed Martin, and the quantitative hedge fund Two Sigma.\n\nThe most popular private jet was the Gulfstream G650, representing 31 of the flights tracked by Business Insider.\n\nBuying one typically costs over $65 million. It can accommodate up to 19 people or be configured with a double bed and a shower.\n\nThe world's newest private jet, the G800, also appeared three times on Monday. Gulfstream only delivered the first one in August.\n\nAt 7,600 miles, the longest trip was made by the Gulfstream G700 that JetSpy says belongs to Benioff. It flew for 14½ hours from Hawaii. Meanwhile, a commercial flight would have taken two stops and over 24 hours.\n\nOther major journeys included airplanes arriving from Kuala Lumpur, Mumbai, and Uruguay.\n\nPrivate jets flew in from dozens of different countries, including Sierra Leone and Montenegro.\n\nLondon was the most popular departure point, with 19 flights coming from four airports in and around the British capital. However, many of these planes appear to have stopped only briefly on the way toward Davos. For example, a Google private jet spent 13 hours on the ground near London after arriving from San Jose.\n\n10 private jets departed from around New York, seven from the Bay Area metropolitan regions, and six from Dubai.\n\nDozens more are expected to arrive throughout the week.\n\nTuesday also saw the arrival of jets belonging to Bill Gates, Michael Dell, and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, according to data from JetSpy.",

    "description": "In his opening remarks at the World Economic Forum, Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, warned that AI could heighten wealth inequality.",
    "fullText": "Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, the world's largest asset management firm, kicked off the World Economic Forum on Tuesday with a critique of capitalism.\n\nMore wealth has been created since the fall of the Berlin Wall than at any other time in human history, but it has not translated into shared prosperity, said Fink, who was appointed as interim co-chair of the World Economic Forum in August 2025, replacing founder Klaus Schwab.\n\n\"In advanced economies, that wealth has accrued to a far narrower share of people than any healthy society can ultimately sustain,\" he said.\n\nFink warned that the pattern of unequal wealth distribution could repeat in the era of AI.\n\n\"Early gains are flowing to the owners of models, owners of data, and owners of infrastructure,\" said Fink.\n\n\"The open question, what happens to everyone else? If AI does to white collar workers what globalisation did to blue collar workers, we need to confront that today, directly.\"\n\nHe urged those gathered at the annual meeting in Davos to rethink how prosperity is defined and to create a \"credible plan\" for broad participation in the gains AI can deliver.\n\n\"This is going to be the test. Capitalism can evolve to turn more people into owners of growth instead of spectators watching it happen,\" said Fink.\n\nThe world's wealthiest 10% own roughly 75% of global wealth, while the poorest half hold only about 2%, according to the World Inequality Report 2026, released in December 2025 and based on data compiled by 200 researchers.\n\nFink acknowledged in his speech that the World Economic Forum has lost trust and \"feels out of step with the moment.\"\n\n\"Davos is an elite gathering trying to shape a world that belongs to everyone,\" Fink said, adding that the forum should be more transparent and precise about what economic success means, especially with those who don't feel represented at gatherings like Davos.\n\n\"Prosperity just isn't the growth in the aggregate. It's not just GDP. It can't be measured by GDP or the market caps of companies. It has to be judged by many people who see it, who can touch it, can feel it, and can build their own future on it,\" said Fink.\n\nFink has previously spoken about how the pandemic fueled a rethink of the US economy.\n\nIn his 2022 annual letter to shareholders, Fink said the growth of stakeholder capitalism — the idea that companies should prioritize interests beyond shareholders — was a natural evolution of how capitalism can best work to build a strong economy.\n\n\"It is through effective stakeholder capitalism that capital is efficiently allocated, companies achieve durable profitability, and value is created and sustained over the long-term,\" he said.\n\nBlackRock, which manages some $14 trillion in assets, has been one of the loudest voices in support of environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) investing, with Fink often highlighting climate change and sustainability in his annual letters.",

Maybe it's that there are reportedly a lot more people here than there have been in a long time.\n\nWhatever the case, everyone seems to be on edge. Multiple attendees told me they were already feeling exhausted, as if we were halfway through the week, even though we're just getting started.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's ongoing threats against Europe over his desire to take over Greenland have been a big talking point. Speculation continues to swirl about his Wednesday address.\n\nI heard the word \"trust\" used a lot yesterday in the context of the rising geopolitical tension and fears that we've reached a breaking point.\n\nFor the business world, that means a global economy that's a lot less … global. We've been headed in that direction for a while, but this week feels like an inflection point. Talk of the year ahead includes discussions about businesses needing to silo their global operations, even for digitally focused strategies.\n\nIt's not all doom and gloom. The conversations around AI have been fascinating, from the evolution of AI agents to concerns over cyber risks in the space to the potential that physical AI (think robots and autonomous systems) could be much larger than generative AI.\n\nFor more of our Davos coverage, please follow along on our live blog and",

The three-piece set, in its winter-white shade, featured a delicate floral print.\n\nShe wore the ensemble with ballet flats and chunky black glasses.\n\nIuliia Bazhan, a model and the founder of Evoautism, attended in a full Chanel getup.\n\nShe wore a jacket and miniskirt from the fashion house's Coco Neige collection, a floor-length coat, and white boots with thick chain detailing.\n\nOne attendee, photographed by Business Insider, accessorized his navy jacket with a multicolored scarf, sunglasses with orange-tinted lenses, and blue leather gloves.\n\nHe also wore a thick gold ring and a giant watch.\n\nOne woman was seen in Davos wearing a bright-pink suit with a white mock-neck top. On its own, the outfit was chic and feminine — especially when paired with her Louis Vuitton tote bag.\n\nHowever, she didn't accessorize with heels or jewelry. Instead, she wore tan snow boots and brown leather gloves.\n\nOf course, they're doing so fashionably. One person wore dark-wash jeans with white socks, red sneakers, and a puffy coat that combined both colors with others across its statement print.\n\nThey also wore a thick red scarf and a lilac beanie.\n\nSarah Backhouse, an executive director at executive networking company World Fifty Group, matched the fur collar of her Frankie Shop coat with a cozy fur hat.\n\nShe accessorized the ensemble with Saint Laurent sunglasses and a Maison Goyard bag.\n\nWealth manager Andrew Gan gave his suit a Davos upgrade with a fur-lined coat and sunglasses as he headed to the Philippines House to moderate.\n\nNidhi Sinja, the head of marketing and communications for BCG North America, opted to carry a notebook in her quilted weatherproof Tory Burch bag.\n\nShe coordinated the look with a North Face coat and L.L. Bean boots, both in cream hues that matched her white purse.\n\nWendy Diamond is the founder and CEO of Women's Entrepreneurship Day Organization. She's also an investor and board advisor for numerous companies.\n\nShe wore a green satin suit, a statement charm necklace, and thick black boots. She told Business Insider that green is her \"happy color,\" and that she likes to wear bright colors when \"the world is so dark.\"\n\nWhen the CEO of Philip Morris International US travels, even for long trips, she takes a carry-on. Her trick: Pick a color for the week and coordinate outfits around that, with travel-well fabrics. For Davos this week, the color is black.\n\nJonathan Nowak Delgado, a senior advisor at nonprofit ViaTalenta Foundation, per his business card, has a strategy to stand out at Davos: wear a mix of bold colors.\n\nHis outfit included a statement orange scarf, which his mother made for him.\n\nOne attendee photographed by Business Insider was seen wearing a tweed suit beneath a gray fuzzy coat and a thin, floral scarf.\n\nIn addition to the fabric layers, she wore black platform boots, white sunglasses, Chanel earrings, and a pink Prada handbag.\n\nJolie Hunt, the CEO of communications agency Hunt & Gather, has worn some of the event's most statement-making looks.\n\nOn Monday, she donned a printed minidress from Balmain with sheer tights, paired it with Larroudé x Libertine pumps adorned with lips, and carried an Hermès Birkin bag.",

The company had some success by having AI follow its old policies, but had a real \"breakthrough\" after its developers rebuilt everything from scratch.\n\nThat involved giving an AI agent clear underlying goals, Khosrowshahi said, such as making the customer feel good after the interaction.\n\n\"Allowing the AI actually to reason through that and throwing away all of the old policies is turning out to be the most promising way forward,\" he said.\n\nKhosrowshahi added that companies are essentially a \"bunch of policies,\" and that to get the full potential of AI, they would need to \"break down those rules and start over.\"\n\nInternally, Uber developers are using AI tools like Anysphere's Cursor and Anthropic's Claude, he added.\n\nMany companies have been ramping up their AI spending in the hope of unlocking productivity gains. A recent poll of IT professionals by RBC Capital found that 90% of respondents plan to spend more on AI this year.\n\nHowever, there are also fears that AI isn't always living up to the hype, and companies are grappling with concerns that it's eroding workers' skills.\n\nKhosrowshahi acknowledged that getting AI adoption right at a company isn't always plain sailing.\n\n\"You have to survive through a bunch of car crashes internally to do so,\" he said.",

    "fullText": "Five years ago, I changed careers from a dental hygienist to a full-time travel writer. Since then, I've spent much of each year on the road, researching destinations and traveling internationally.\n\nWhat I enjoy most, though, is planning and hosting trips for women.\n\nEach year, I bring small groups together in destinations around the world, and certain places consistently stand out.\n\nIt's rarely the most trendy or Instagram-famous locations that resonate most. Rather, the trips women love are built around places that feel safe, comfortable, and easy to enjoy together.\n\nThese are the five destinations I recommend most often for girls' trips, and a few must-try highlights in each spot.\n\nYork is perfect for a girls' trip because it's so easily walkable and has plenty to offer, from modern boutique shops and pubs to historic cobbled streets full of stories from the past.\n\nThe English city is also easily accessible by a short train ride from London or Edinburgh.\n\nPro tip: Book a historical walking tour with Mad Alice; she's phenomenal.\n\nIncredible outdoor experiences, restaurants, wildlife experiences, and temples are all within reach in this central part of Bali.\n\nUbud is also a great place for relaxation, as it's known for its first-class wellness resorts that still feel accessible, especially compared to similar retreats elsewhere in the world.\n\nPro tip: Hire a private driver while you're there, as traffic can feel overwhelming to navigate. Keep in mind that some resort packages, including several at Goddess Resorts, include access to a driver.\n\nWith about 300 days of sunshine a year, first-class wineries, white-washed buildings, and a beautiful coastline, Santa Barbara is a great travel destination in California.\n\nIts downtown is walkable and full of shops, and the newly revitalized Funk Zone is home to more restaurants, bars, and wine tasting rooms than I can count.\n\nPro tip: Take the Santa Barbara Trolley tour for a great overview of the city's sights and history.\n\nScottsdale is easily accessible for a range of travelers as it's just a short drive from the Phoenix Airport. Surrounded by the Sonoran Desert, the city's natural beauty is also visible around every turn.\n\nPro tip: Eat brunch at Hash Kitchen if you want to enjoy Instagrammable surroundings and a build-your-own Bloody Mary bar.\n\nIf you've ever wanted to feel ike you are the main character in a storybook, head to the charming Alsace region in France.\n\nA short train ride from Paris will land you right in the heart of Alsace, and you can explore numerous villages and wineries with both German and French influence.\n\nEach village has its own charm, but my favorites are Eguisheim, Obernai, and Ribeauville.\n\nPro tip: Go during December to see the villages come alive with Christmas markets — it's magical!",

    "fullText": "Steven Bartlett said one use of AI has mattered more to his business than anything else: translating his podcast into other languages.\n\n\"There's nothing more important than what we've done for our business than translations. Period,\" Bartlett said during the \"What it Takes to Build\" panel at the World Economic Forum at Davos on Tuesday.\n\nThe British entrepreneur and host of \"The Diary of a CEO\" podcast was in conversation with Jessica Lessin, the CEO of The Information, alongside Bret Taylor, formerly the co-CEO of Salesforce and CTO of Meta.\n\nBartlett said using AI tools to translate the podcasts was initially an \"expensive experiment.\" The problem he was trying to solve, he said, was reaching the untapped market of non-English speakers.\n\n\"If we're just in English, we're reaching like 10% of the world,\" Bartlett added.\n\nThere were technical challenges, too. Some languages use longer words, Bartlett said, meaning three-hour English-language conversations could become significantly longer when translated, risking the audio and video falling out of sync.\n\nTwo years ago, Bartlett announced on LinkedIn that \"The Diary of a CEO\" had hired a full-time data scientist who helped the company achieve a technological breakthrough, enabling them to use AI to translate the podcast into \"EVERY language.\"\n\nAt Davos and in the LinkedIn post, Bartlett did not elaborate on exactly how the AI translations work. Today, however, the videos show Bartlett speaking Spanish in a voice similar to his own, a shift he said had significantly expanded the podcast's reach.\n\n\"This month, 28% of my audience is Spanish,\" he said, adding that Spanish speakers now have access to interviews with some of the world's most high-profile podcast guests, citing his own interview with former first lady Michelle Obama as an example.\n\nOther guests on the podcast include former vice President Kamala Harris, Simon Cowell, and the psychologist Jordan Peterson.\n\nSpotify said in its \"2025 Wrapped\" press release in December 2025 that \"The Diary of a CEO with Steven Bartlett\" was the platform's second-most-listened-to podcast globally, behind \"The Joe Rogan Experience.\" On YouTube, Bartlett's podcast channel has 14.5 million subscribers.",

    "description": "A sell-off in Japanese government bonds was part of a one-two punch hitting markets on Tuesday, alongside Trump's latest Greenland threats.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump's latest threats to hike tariffs on major European economies are shaking up markets on Tuesday, but a surge in Japanese bonds yields is also weighing on investor sentiment.\n\nJapanese 40-year bond yields surged to 4.2% on Tuesday from 3.94% on Monday — the first time ever they've crossed the 4% mark. Yields started the year at 3.6%. Rates on 30- and 20-year bonds have also spiked.\n\nIn a note to clients on Tuesday, Jeffrey Favuzza, an equities trader at Jefferies, called the Tuesday sell-off a two-standard-deviation move lower. When yields rise, bond prices fall.\n\nWhat's behind the volatility? A potential pause on food taxes.\n\nOn Monday, Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi called a snap parliamentary election set to be held on February 8. Takaichi's goal is to gain more support for her agenda — which includes a proposed 2-year break from the 8% tax on food products — in the new parliament.\n\nThe news has been too much for investors to swallow. Japan's government debt levels have already been a concern for markets, and investors fear such a tax holiday would exacerbate an already shaky fiscal situation.\n\nAs of 10:30 am ET, the S&P 500 was down 1.16%, while the Nikkei 225 had fallen 1.11%. Meanwhile, gold, which investors have increasingly seen as a hedge to the threat of global fiat currency debasement, was up 3.3%. The Japanese bond turmoil was part of a one-two punch battering markets, along with Donald Trump's increasingly aggressive rhetoric on Greenland.\n\n\"These moves highlight the extent to which investors are souring on this snap election that is promising a food sales tax holiday, which will only make a bad fiscal situation worse,\" David Rosenberg, the founder of Rosenberg Research, said in a note on Tuesday. \"Since Takaichi took office in October, longer-term interest rates have jumped +80 basis points, with obvious spillover effects across the globe.\"\n\nRising Japanese bond yields have an impact on broader markets because of the country's outsize influence on global capital flows. Both domestic and foreign investors have used low yields to lever up positions in higher-yielding assets like US Treasurys and stocks.\n\nWith yields surging, Japanese investors could pivot away from US bond markets and simply buy domestic government debt. It also revives fears of an unwind of the \"carry trade.\" Concerns about the carry trade have been on display in recent years, as investors fear an unwind of levered positions amid rising Japanese yields.\n\nYields on 30-year US Treasurys rose to 4.9% on Tuesday from 4.84% on Monday. Generally, higher long-term government bond yields tend to hurt equity performance as investors can get attractive returns on risk-free assets.\n\nHow things develop in Japan in the days ahead should be top of mind for investors, said Jean Boivin, head of the BlackRock Investment Institute, in a note on Tuesday.\n\n\"On a quieter data week, we are looking at what global flash PMIs say about global activity. Otherwise, the focus is on Japan where the expected snap election may pave the way for the ruling Liberal Democratic Party to pursue looser fiscal policy and add more pressure to global long-term bond yields,\" Boivin and his team wrote.\n\nThere are plenty of other things happening this week for investors to keep an eye on, too.\n\nFor one, Trump is speaking in Davos on Wednesday, perhaps offering another update to his approach to acquiring Greenland from Denmark. Trump may also join G7 leaders for dinner in Paris on Thursday, per an invite from French President Emmanuel Macron. Michigan Consumer Sentiment data is also out on Friday, which could provide a window into whether renewed tariff uncertainty is weighing on Americans' economic outlook.",

I'm not sure that's true of all human immigrants, but it will definitely be true of the AI immigrants,\" he said.\n\nHarari asked the audience whether they want to allow AIs to be recognized as \"legal persons\" with rights in their countries, giving them the ability to start businesses, form and preach their own religions, or befriend their children on social media.\n\n\"If you want to influence where humanity is going, you need to make a decision now,\" he said.\n\nHarari is a distinguished research fellow at the University of Cambridge's Centre for the Study of Existential Risk, and a history professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Alongside \"Sapiens,\" his book tracing human history across the centuries, he also released \"Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow\" in 2015, where he discussed the existential threat AI poses to humanity.\n\nHarari is not the first person to refer to \"AI immigrants.\" Earlier this month, the Nvidia CEO, Jensen Huang, referred to robots using the term, and said \"AI immigrants\" will help humans with work we no longer want to do, such as manufacturing jobs, AFP reported.",

Despite an economy comparable in size to that of the United States, Europe invests only a fraction as much in venture-backed firms, and the gap is widening as capital concentrates around AI and other winner-take-all technologies. The consequences are visible in lower innovation, weaker returns for investors, and a steady outflow of entrepreneurial talent. But Europe’s venture deficit is not inevitable. While structural disadvantages exist, policy choices and investor behavior play a decisive role.",

    "fullText": "Trial involving 4,000 children will explore impact on mental health, sleep and time spent with friends and family\n\nA pioneering investigation into the impact of restricting social media access for children in the UK has been announced as politicians around the world consider action on the issue.\n\nIn December, Australia became the first country to ban under-16s from social media, with governments in other countries, including the, coming under pressure to do the same.\n\nHowever, while experts say there is evidence that aspects of social media are harmful to most children, there has been no large-scale experimental study exploring the effect of limiting time spent on social media in healthy children as a population.\n\n“This study is a world first to try to look at that question,” said Prof Amy Orben, of the University of Cambridge, who is co-lead of the study.\n\nOrben and colleagues plan to study about 4,000 children across 30 secondary schools in Bradford, West Yorkshire, focusing on students in years 8, 9 and 10.\n\nAll participants would be asked to complete an initial questionnaire on areas including their mental health, sleep and friendships, and to download the research app on their main device.\n\nEach year group in each school would be randomly assigned to one of two conditions: the app would simply record the pupils’ social media use, or it would curtail their social media use by limiting access to the apps for TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, X, LinkedIn, Reddit, YouTube and Snapchat to one hour a day, as well as imposing a curfew from 9pm to 7am.\n\nCrucially, the team said, all pupils within a particular year group in a school would experience the same intervention.\n\n“We know that if we take away social media for one adolescent, that might have a very different impact than if we take it away for their whole friendship group for a certain period of time,” Orben said.\n\nAccess to messaging apps including WhatsApp would not be restricted, the team said, as they were important for family communication.\n\nAfter six weeks students would complete another questionnaire. After an initial pilot period beginning in April, the team planned to start the study itself in October, with the first results expected in summer 2027.\n\nMembers of the House of Lords are preparing to vote on an amendment brought by John Nash to the children’s wellbeing and schools bill which would introduce an outright ban on children using social media.\n\nThe amendment has the support of some Labour peers, and if it passes in the Lords it will then be debated in the Commons, where 61 Labour MPs recently wrote a letter to the prime minister urging him to bring in a ban.\n\nLiz Kendall, the technology secretary, reassured MPs on Tuesday that the government’s consultation on the issue would only take a few months and that it would have a firm position by the summer.\n\nHowever, Nash insisted he would press ahead with his attempt to legislate immediately for a ban, saying on Tuesday: “The time for delay and procrastination is over. Without swift action to raise the age limit for social media to 16, we are at risk of a societal catastrophe.\n\n“That is why I am urging all fellow peers to vote for my amendment, which has the backing of peers from every major party, to end the disastrous harm being done to our young people by social media and to give them their childhood back.”\n\nWhile the researchers have noted that the study, called the IRL trial, has limitations – for example students may use devices that belong to other people or may choose not to participate – they said they hoped the results would shed light on the effect of restricting teens’ social media use.\n\n“The participants’ levels of anxiety is our key outcome, and we’re also interested in depression,” said Dr Dan Lewer, who leads the Bradford Centre for Health Data Science and is co-lead of the study. The researchers would also explore the impact by looking at which apps were used and when, as well as participants’ sleep patterns, experiences of bullying, time spent with friends and family, and how they compared themselves to other young people, he said.\n\nThe trial was independent from the UK government’s announcement of a consultation on whether to ban under-16s from social media, Orben said, adding that the results may be valuable for other countries debating the issue.\n\n“The decision that policymakers need to make is up to them,” she said. “We’re really just delivering the best quality evidence we can in the timeframes that are available.”",

    "fullText": "Fulham are battling Wolfsburg and Real Betis in the race to sign Troy Parrott following his huge impact in the Republic of Ireland’s quest to qualify for the World Cup 2026.\n\nSo far, the trio are the clubs that have gone in strongest in what is expected to be a wide race for the AZ Alkmaar forward over the next few months.\n\nThe 23-year-old's profile exploded after the five goals against Portugal and Hungary that sent Heimir Hallgrimsson’s side into a World Cup play-off.\n\nBut that was only on the back of burgeoning development that had made a series of clubs around the Premier League and European football take note of his impact in the Netherlands.\n\nWolfsburg have talked about a €20m (£17.4m) deal, but it is understood that AZ would want even more. Fulham have so far shown the strongest interest from the Premier League.\n\nHaving energised his career at AZ, though, Parrott is understood to want to be very considerate about his next steps. While the forward does want to return to the Premier League at some point - he initially came through the Tottenham Hotspur system - any English move would have to fully make sense for both his current position and future prospects, which is why he is happy to stay in Europe.\n\nThe Bundesliga is an appealing option, particularly with the way the competition has proven so successful in developing young talent.\n\nAway from his prolific run for his country, Parrott has hit nine goals in 13 Eredivisie games, with 10 more goals this term in Conference League qualifiers and the KNVB Cup.\n\nParrott is tied fourth in the Eredivisie top scorer standings, with Ayase Ueda clear with 18 goals in as many games for Feyenoord.",

    "description": "A real-world comparison of GPT-5.2-Codex (high), Claude Opus 4.5, and Gemini 3 Pro on two coding tasks, focusing on quality, speed, and cost.",
    "fullText": "If you want a quick take: Claude Opus 4.5 was the most consistent, GPT-5.2-codex (high) delivered strong code with slower turnaround, and Gemini 3 Pro was the most efficient but less polished.\n\nIf you want a quick take, here’s how the three models performed in our tests:\n\n💡 If you want the safest pick for real “ship a feature in a big repo” work, Opus 4.5 felt the most reliable in my runs. If you care about speed and cost and you’re okay polishing UI yourself, Gemini 3 Pro is a solid bet.\n\nOkay, so right now the WebDev leaderboard on LMArena is basically owned by the big three: Claude Opus 4.5 from Anthropic, GPT-5.2-codex (high) from OpenAI, and finally everybody's favorite, Gemini 3 Pro from Google.\n\nSo, I grabbed these three and put them into the same existing project (over 8K stars and 50K+ LOC) and asked them to build a couple of real features like a normal dev would.\n\nSame repo. Same prompts. Same constraints.\n\nFor each task, I took the best result out of three runs per model to keep things fair.\n\nThen I compared what they actually did: code quality, how much hand-holding they needed, and whether the feature even worked in the end.\n\n⚠️ NOTE: Don't take the result of this test as a hard rule. This is just a small set of real-world coding tasks that shows how each model did for me in that exact setup and gives you an overview of the difference in the top 3 models' performance in the same tasks.\n\nFor the test, we will use the following CLI coding agents:\n\nHere’s the repo used for the entire test: iib0011/omni-tools\n\nWe will check the models on two different tasks:\n\nEach model is asked to create a global action menu that opens with a keyboard shortcut. This feature expands on the current search by adding actions, global state, and keyboard navigation. This task checks how well the model understands current UX patterns and avoids repetition without breaking what's already in place.\n\nEach model had to add real usage tracking across the app, persist it locally, and then build an analytics dashboard that shows things like the most used tools, recent activity, and basic filters.\n\nWe’ll compare code quality, token usage, cost, and time to complete the build.\n\n💡 NOTE: I will share the source code changes for each task by each model in a .patch file. This way, you can easily view them on your local system by cloning the repository and applying the patch file using git apply <path_file_name>. This method makes sharing changes easier.\n\nThe task is simple: all models start from the same base commit and then follow the same prompt to build what is asked in the prompt.\n\nAnd obviously, as mentioned, I will evaluate the response from the model from the \"Best of 3.\"\n\nLet's start off the test with something interesting:\n\nGPT-5.2 handled this surprisingly well. The implementation was solid end to end, and it basically one-shotted the entire feature set, including i18n support, without needing multiple correction passes.\n\nThat said, it did take a bit longer than some other models (~20 minutes), which is expected since reasoning was explicitly set to high. The model spends more time thinking through architecture, naming, and edge cases rather than rushing to output code. The trade-off felt worth it here.\n\nThe token usage was noticeably higher due to the reasoning set to high, but the output code reflected that.\n\nYou can find the code it generated here: GPT-5.2 High Code\n\n💡 NOTE: I ran the exact same prompt with the same model using the default (medium) reasoning level. The difference was honestly massive. With reasoning set to high, the quality of the code, structure, and pretty much everything jumps by miles. It’s not even a fair comparison.\n\nClaude went all in and prepared a ton of different strategies. At the start, it did run into build issues, but it kept running the build until it was able to fix all the build and lint issues.\n\nThe entire run took me about 7 minutes 50 seconds, which is the fastest among the models for this test. The features all worked as asked, and obviously, the UI looked super nice and exactly how I expected.\n\nYou can find the code it generated here: Claude Opus 4.5 Code\n\nTo be honest, this exceeded my expectations; even the i18n texts are added and displayed in the UI just as expected. Absolute cinema!\n\nGemini 3 got it working, but it's clearly not on the same level as GPT-5.2 High or Claude Opus 4.5. The UI it built is fine and totally usable, but it feels a bit barebones, and you don't get many choices in the palette compared to the other two.\n\nOne clear miss is that language switching does not show up inside the action palette at all, which makes the i18n support feel incomplete even though translations technically exist.\n\nYou can find the code it generated here: Gemini 3 Pro Code\n\nOverall, Gemini 3 lands in a very clear third place here. It works, the UI looks fine, and nothing is completely broken, but compared to the depth, completeness, and polish of GPT-5.2 High and Claude Opus 4.5, it feels behind.\n\nThis test is a step up from the action palette.\n\nYou can find the prompt I've used here: Prompt\n\nGPT-5.2 absolutely nailed this one.\n\nThe final result turned out amazing. Tool usage tracking works exactly as expected, data persists correctly, and the dashboard feels like a real product feature. Most used tools, recent usage, filters, everything just works.\n\nOne really nice touch is that it also wired analytics-related actions into the Action Palette from Test 1.\n\nIt did take a bit longer than the first test, around 26 minutes, but again, that’s the trade-off with high reasoning. You can tell the model spent time thinking through data modeling, reuse, and avoiding duplicated logic. Totally worth it here.\n\nYou can find the code it generated here: GPT-5.2 High Code\n\nGPT-5.2 High continues to be slow but extremely powerful, and for a task like this, that’s a very good trade.\n\nClaude Opus 4.5 did great here as well.\n\nThe final implementation works end to end, and honestly, from a pure UI and feature standpoint, it’s hard to tell the difference between this and GPT-5.2 High. The dashboard looks clean, the data makes sense, and the filters work as expected.\n\nYou can find the code it generated here: Claude Opus 4.5 Code\n\nGemini 3 Pro gets the job done, but it clearly takes a more minimal approach compared to GPT-5.2 High and Claude Opus 4.5.\n\nThat said, the overall experience feels very bare minimum. The UI is functional but plain, and the dashboard lacks the polish and depth you get from the other two models.\n\nAlso, it didn't quite add the button to view the analytics right in the action palette, similar to the other two models.\n\nYou can find the code it generated here: Gemini 3 Pro Code\n\nOverall, Gemini 3 Pro remains efficient and reliable, but in a comparison like this, efficiency alone is not enough. 🤷‍♂️\n\nAt least from this test, I can conclude that the models are now pretty much able to one-shot a decent complex work, at least from what I tested.\n\nStill, there have been times when the models mess up so badly that if I were to go ahead and fix the problems one by one, it would take me nearly the same time as building it from scratch.\n\nIf I compare the results across models, Opus 4.5 definitely takes the crown. But I still don’t think we’re anywhere close to relying on it for real, big production projects. The recent improvements are honestly insane, but the results still don’t fully back them up. 🥴\n\nFor now, I think these models are great for refactoring, planning, and helping you move faster. But if you solely rely on their generated code, the codebase just won’t hold up long term.\n\nI don't see any of these recent models as “use it and ship it” for \"production,\" in a project with millions of lines of code, at least not in the way people hype it up.\n\nLet me know your thoughts in the comments.\n\nSoftware and DevOps engineer with 4+ years of experience building for the web and cloud, mainly with TypeScript, Python, Go, Docker, and Kubernetes.

    "description": "In developing EnergyNet we have leveraged and are extending lessons from telecom's shift from a centralized, circuit-switched phone system to decentralized, packet-switched data networks. EnergyNet utilizes 1) an Energy Router that enforces galvanic separation and utilizes software-controlled energy flows over a DC backplane, 2) Energy Local and Wide Area Networks (ELAN/EWAN) based on DC microgrids that interconnect through an open Energy Protocol (EP), and 3) a control plane comprised of the Energy Router Operating System (EROS) and EP Server which is managed at operator scale through an Energy Network Management System (ENMS). We distinguish the architectural contribution (Tier-1 including components, interfaces, and operating model) from expected outcomes contingent on adoption (Tier-2). The latter includes local-first autonomy with global interoperability, near-real-time operation with local buffering, removal of EV-charging bottlenecks, freed grid capacity for data centers and industrial electrification, as well as a trend toward low, predictable, fixed-cost clean energy. Evidence from early municipal demonstrators illustrates feasibility and migration paths.",

    "fullText": "Patrick Reed stands by the sentiment that he wants to be a worldwide player. It's something he has not only said but followed up on throughout his career.\n\nThe 2018 Masters champion opened his 2026 campaign last week at the Dubai Invitational on the DP World Tour and will compete in this week's Dubai Desert Classic. Next month, he'll kick off his fifth season competing for LIV Golf, where he has one win in 45 career starts. Late last year, he also made starts on the Asian Tour.\n\nOver the weekend, Reed was asked about a possible return to the PGA Tour. He's not eligible for the Returning Member Program, which only four players fit the criteria for, but that doesn't mean he hasn't thought about going back.\n\n\"I mean, of course; if it were up to me, I'd play everywhere,\" Reed told Golf Digest's Evin Priest. Then he continued: \"I'm already playing on three tours, why not add one more? I always enjoyed my time out there on the PGA Tour.\n\n\"Let's be honest, out there, it's the best tour in the world. Look at what they've done in golf … I could see myself playing there at some point again. But right now, you just never know; everything's so fluid.”\n\nReed joking about competing on four tours is somewhat ironic, considering the Texan's reason for leaving the PGA Tour in the first place was centered around wanting to spend more time at home with his family. “It wears on you as an athlete, wears on you as a person, as a father, and this is for me, I feel like this is the best decision ever,\" Reed said in 2022. \"Now I can compete at the highest level, but also prepare and get ready for every single event and be able to be home, and even though I'll be grinding at home getting ready, I'll be able to spend time with the kids.\"\n\nBut his praise for the PGA Tour is not too surprising. He has maintained, even since leaving, he wants to play all around the world, including back on the PGA Tour eventually.\n\n\"Right now, it's not even a decision,” Reed said. \"That was for ’22 and on winners. So, I definitely would have to think about it … if that number (came) down to 2018. Right now, it's hard to say really what we're going to do or anything like that.\"\n\nLast year, Reed tied for third at the Masters. He's a nine-time winner on the PGA Tour and has lifetime membership on the DP World Tour, which he received in 2019.\n\n\"Right now, the biggest thing is trying to play some good golf these (two) weeks, not only to solidify myself out here on DP, but to have a good momentum going into the year.”\n\nFor every LIV Golf event he competes in that is the same week as a DP World Tour event, Reed must pay fines for competing in a conflicting event. The amount of each fine is unknown, but Reed said having to pay those won't stop him.\n\n“Me traveling and playing around the world ... it helps this tour, but also it's something I've always held true to my heart and wanted to do,\" Reed saod. \"So, if that's what it takes, that's what it takes.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on Golfweek: Patrick Reed calls PGA Tour 'the best tour in the world' in Dubai",

    "fullText": "Fans from around the globe cast their ballots, picking who should start in the NBA All-Star Game next month in Los Angeles. Those fan votes (50% of the total) — combined with votes from NBA players (25%) and select media (25%) — have chosen the 10 All-Star Game starters. There are five starters from the Eastern Conference and five from the West (even though those players will later be divided into two USA and one World team for the new format, more on that below).\n\nThose All-Star Game starters will be unveiled today on NBC, read by the NBA Showtime crew live on set at 2 p.m. Eastern. This will be right before the tip-off of the Oklahoma City at Cleveland game, part of a quadruple header of Martin Luther King Day games on NBC and Peacock.\n\nRefresh this page, where we will have all the details on who the starters will be, as well as analysis of those selections.\n\nNow that the fans have had their say, it falls to the coaches around the league.\n\nNBA coaches will vote to choose the seven reserve (or bench) players from each conference. The results of the vote and the names of the remaining NBA All-Stars will be announced next week on NBC.\n\nThose starters and reserves will then be divided up into three teams as part of a new USA vs. World All-Star Game format. Two international players, Luka Doncic in the West and Giannis Antetokounmpo in the East, were the top vote-getters among fans.\n\nWhile the idea of a USA vs. international players All-Star Game format has been talked about for years, 2026 felt like the right time.\n\nThat's because the NBA All-Star Game returns to NBC and debuts on Peacock in the middle of the Milan Cortina Winter Olympics. That was a perfect setup for the first-of-its-kind All-Star Game format.\n\nThe 24 All-Star players will be divided into three teams — two USA teams and one world team — that will compete in a round-robin tournament of four 12-minute games. Each of the three teams will have a minimum of eight players (if the USA or World teams are short on players, the league office will select one or more players to reach the required number).\n\nAt the end of the round-robin, the two top teams will play a championship game (the fourth 12-minute game of the day) for the title.\n\nAll-Star weekend tips off on Feb. 13 with the Rising Stars at the Intuit Dome at 6 p.m. PT, featuring the league's top first- and second-year players. Also on the 13th is the NBA All-Star Celebrity Game, featuring stars from media, sports and entertainment at the Kia Forum. The Forum also hosts the fifth annual NBA HBCU Classic at 8 p.m. that night.\n\nOn Saturday, Feb. 14, All-Star Saturday night — featuring the Skills Challenge, 3-point Contest and the Dunk Contest — will take place at the Intuit Dome.\n\nThe 75th NBA All-Star Game will take place on Sunday, Feb. 15, at 5 p.m. Eastern, earlier than in previous years, leading into more coverage of the Milan Cortina Winter Olympics.\n\nPeacock NBA Monday will stream up to three Monday night games each week throughout the regular season. Coast 2 Coast Tuesday presents doubleheaders on Tuesday nights throughout the regular season on NBC and Peacock. On most Tuesdays, an 8 p.m. ET game will be on NBC stations in the Eastern and Central time zones, and an 8 p.m. PT game on NBC stations in the Pacific and often Mountain time zones. Check local listings each week. Both games will stream live nationwide on Peacock. NBC Sports will launch Sunday Night Basketball across NBC and Peacock on Feb. 1, 2026.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe NBA is trying its hand at a brand new All-Star Game format in 2026, but the honor of being named a starter remains unchanged. As in years' past, five players from each conference receive the starter label, even though 15 players will actually start as part of the league's three-team format.\n\nIf the early voting returns were any indication, fans expect the World team to have an advantage over the two USA teams on All-Star Weekend. Luka Doncic, Giannis Antetokounmpo and Nikola Jokic were the top three vote-getters in the NBA's final update on Jan. 7, with Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Victor Wembanyama also not far behind.\n\nFor the Americans, Jalen Brunson put together a strong showing in early voting returns, while Stephen Curry was near the top of the balloting in the West even as he approaches his 38th birthday.\n\nWhich 10 players are 2026 NBA All-Star Game starters?

The teams will play a round-robin format to determine who will advance to the championship game. All games will be played on Sunday, Feb. 15.\n\nIf all three teams are tied after the round-robin format, point differential will be used to determine which teams go to the championship game. Each game will be 12 minutes, adding up to the equivalent of a 48-minute game of basketball.\n\nLocation: Intuit Dome, Inglewood, CA\n\nThe 2026 NBA All-Star will tip off at 5 p.m. ET on Sunday, Feb. 15 from the Los Angeles Clippers' Intuit Dome.

    "fullText": "The billionaires and business execs are hitting the slopes.\n\nA sleepy ski town tucked in the Swiss Alps is being taken over by the world's elite (and a bunch of journalists) for the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland.\n\n(If you want to see how you get to this town, here's how I did it. And no, it wasn't by private jet.)\n\nYour immediate reaction to Davos might be a massive eye roll. Davos has gotten a reputation in recent years as a gathering of the elite who are out of touch with everyday people.\n\nThis year, though, some of the biggest topics at Davos will impact everyone. You can follow everything that's going on in our live blog and with our special Davos newsletter.\n\nTrump: In all honesty, the conversation around Davos largely starts (and arguably ends) with the president's appearance on Wednesday. He famously skipped attending the event in person last year (he had just been inaugurated). Instead, he offered a blistering virtual address that largely attacked the rest of the world.\n\nThis time, he's coming with a big contingent, and it's the talk of the town. He's already said a focus of his speech will largely be affordability, interestingly choosing a US-specific issue on the global stage. (It is America First, after all.)\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom is also coming to town. He plans to argue that Trump's economic agenda has been a failure. It's another example of the ever-evolving future of capitalism, a topic we've been closely covering this year.\n\nTariffs: Tariffs have been a staple of Trump's second term, and they don't appear to be going anywhere. Their impact is also felt worldwide, making them a perfect fit for the global Davos crowd.\n\nTheir latest iteration is a threat Trump is wielding against countries that oppose his plan to take over Greenland. Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said controlling Greenland is actually about Trump trying to avoid conflict.\n\nAI: You didn't think you'd get through this without an AI mention, did you? Last year, the word of the conference was \"agentic AI.\" This year it feels like three letters will be top of mind: ROI. The bets have been placed, and they are big, but what is AI doing for companies?\n\nAlso expect some chatter about how the tech is affecting workforce headcounts.",

OpenAI's chief research officer, Mark Chen, said in December that Mark Zuckerberg attempted to lure some OpenAI engineers to Meta by hand-delivering them soup.\n\nxAI's focus on hiring comes as the startup continues to grow despite being embroiled in controversy over its Grok chatbot.\n\nThe AI startup raised $20 billion earlier this month at a valuation of over $230 billion, as it battles backlash around the world over Grok generating sexualized images of real people on X.\n\nThe social media platform said last week it would prevent Grok from sexualizing images of real people after California's Attorney General said the state would launch an investigation into reports that Grok had produced deepfakes of women and minors on X.\n\nThe AI chatbot has also faced temporary bans in Indonesia and Malaysia, and an investigation from the UK's media regulator. xAI did not respond to a request for comment.",

    "description": "Luisa Zhou followed the traditional path her immigrant parents wanted, then built a million-dollar business that gave her time and flexibility.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Luisa Zhou. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nMy parents raised me to get good grades, go to a good college, and get a good job. They were entirely focused on security because they didn't want my sister and me to experience the hardships that they had as immigrants. They encouraged me not to take risks — just keep my head down, work hard, and appreciate what I had.\n\nThe day I got into Princeton, I thought, \"Thank goodness. I'm going to be OK.\" I graduated with an engineering degree and started working in analytics at a financial services company.\n\nIt was what I'd been raised to do, but from the beginning, it wasn't a good fit. I hated that my boss wouldn't let me leave before 5, even if I'd finished all my work. Still, I thought that if I climbed the corporate ladder, the work might become more challenging and fulfilling.\n\nIn my early 20s, I met a man who was launching a startup. He brought me on as cofounder because of my engineering background. Raising money for the startup opened my eyes to a whole new world of career options. That venture failed, but it gave me a different skill set and worldview.\n\nAfter that, I started working at a digital ad startup. I had a six-figure salary and a cool job, but I still wanted more.\n\nThen, my family had a difficult year: my dad had heart surgery, my mom was diagnosed with cancer, and my little sister experienced an eye injury that required her to sit in the dark for weeks on end. My sister was staying with me, and as I shut the door on the way to work one day, she quietly said \"Bye.\" It broke my heart that I had to leave her.\n\nThat's the moment I vowed to do something that would let me spend more time with the people I loved.\n\nI'm fairly risk-averse, so I didn't do anything sudden. Instead, I spent the next two years building my side business, offering coaching, ad consulting, and other services. I was working on my lunch break and at night, so I had even less time for family than before.\n\nThat's where my background really helped me. My parents and grandparents raised me on a Chinese proverb: \"First bitter, then sweet.\" I knew I was working hard then, so I could enjoy the fruits later.\n\nThose early years were challenging because I'm not naturally confident. It seemed like no one believed in me. I was seen as nice, but not necessarily smart or business-minded. That gave me a chip on my shoulder, and I was determined to prove myself. The year I was 26, the business did more than $1 million in revenue. Last year, I did more than $1.5 million in revenue, while working fewer hours.\n\nAt first, I didn't understand that $1 million doesn't mean you're a millionaire, especially when you factor in costs and taxes. I still needed to learn about managing money and work on my own mindset about spending. As I did that, my wealth really accumulated: by the time I was 30, I had $1 million in investable assets.\n\nToday, I'm 36. Although I'm a millionaire, my parents still nervously ask me if work is going OK every time we speak. They don't understand this alternative path, and that's OK. We just don't talk about it much.\n\nHaving financial security was worth the non-stop work in those earlier years. These days, I typically work about four hours a day. I limit my screen time and only book phone calls two weeks out of the month. I spend about two hours each day walking my German Shepherd, and I have the flexibility to spend time with my husband — he's a doctor, so his schedule is much more demanding. I can easily travel to visit my parents.\n\nIt took a lot to get here, but I'm so glad that I've been able to step away from the time-money trade-off.",

    "description": "PwC's global CEO survey found that more than half of CEOs say they aren't seeing increased revenue or cost benefits from their investments in AI.",
    "fullText": "Everyone wants to know when AI investments will pay off.\n\nMost CEOs say they're still waiting, according to PwC's latest Global CEO survey, released on Monday to coincide with the start of Davos.\n\nThe consulting giant questioned 4,454 chief executives across 95 countries and territories about their strategic priorities and outlook in the year up to November 2025.\n\nMore than half of the CEOs surveyed, 56%, said AI hasn't produced revenue or cost benefits for their businesses to date.\n\nSome reported benefits for either revenue or costs: around a third said their revenue was up in the last year, and 26% said they were seeing lower costs from AI.\n\nBut only 12% said they had both decreased costs and increased revenue using AI in the last 12 months.\n\nRecent Morgan Stanley data on S&P 500 companies showed that certain sectors are seeing higher, measurable AI-driven returns than others. Technology, communication services, and financials topped the list, while energy companies were rising fast up the list.\n\n\"A small group of companies are already turning AI into measurable financial returns, while many others are still struggling to move beyond pilots,\" said Mohamed Kande, PwC's global chairman, in a press release.\n\n\"That gap is starting to show up in confidence and competitiveness—and it will widen quickly for those that don't act.\"\n\nEnsuring maximum returns from AI requires a balance of business strategy, strong underlying data architecture, and the right talent strategy. No matter how excited CEOs are about AI, they also have to get employees on board to see returns.\n\nA recent EY survey on how AI is being used at work found that companies are missing out on 40% of the AI productivity gains they could achieve with the right strategy.\n\nPwC found that the 12% of CEOs reporting both cost and revenue gains were two to three times more likely to have also built a strong AI foundation, meaning they have embedded AI extensively across products and services, demand generation, and strategic decision-making.\n\nAs they grapple with AI uncertainty and geopolitical volatility, CEOs told PwC they are less confident about their short-term growth outlook than they were last year.\n\nOnly 30% of those surveyed said they are very or extremely confident about revenue growth over the next 12 months, down from 38% in last year's report and a peak of 56% in 2022.\n\nThe strongest approach to dealing with future uncertainty was embracing reinvention, including through dealmaking and venturing into new sectors, PwC found.\n\nThe consulting giant found there was a \"strong association among a higher percentage of revenue coming from new sectors, bigger profit margins, and greater CEO confidence in company growth prospects.\"\n\n\"The companies that succeed will be those willing to make bold decisions and invest with conviction in the capabilities that matter most,\" said Kande.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "Embark Studios’ multiplayer extraction shooter game has already sold 12m copies in just three months. Will it capture you too?\n\nReleased last October Arc Raiders has swiftly become one of the most successful online shooters in the world, shifting 12m copies in barely three months and attracting as many players as established mega hits such as Counter-Strike 2 and Apex Legends. So what is it about this sci-fi blaster that’s captured so many people – and how can you get involved?\n\nCreated by Swedish developer Embark Studios, Arc Raiders is an extraction shooter: an online multiplayer game that drops you into a world with other people to search for valuable weapons and items before attempting to escape with all your spoils. You can play alone or with up to two friends in a squad. Most extraction shooters feature two types of gameplay: Player vs Environment (PvE), which means exploring the world and fighting computer controlled enemies, and Player vs Player (PvP), which means fighting any other players you come across on your travels and then stealing their stuff. In Arc Raiders, you don’t have to fight everyone you meet: in fact human raiders rarely attack each other, choosing to band together instead. The game gives you a few stock phrases to shout such as “don’t shoot!”, or you can plug in a mic, chat to strangers you meet and form alliances.\n\nArc Raiders is set on a post-apocalyptic Earth in the distant future. The planet has suffered an ecological disaster that has wiped out most of the population and most technology. Now, a robotic alien invasion force named Arc has arrived to plunder all the remaining natural resources and kill off humanity, forcing everyone to flee underground, where a vast subterranean city named Toledo has been built. Now Earth is patrolled by a menagerie of deadly android guards.\n\nYou play as a raider making daring trips topside to scavenge ruined towns and facilities. As you go on more raids, your character earns experience points, which can be spent on improving their survival, looting and movement abilities, and finds blueprints that enable them to make more stuff. You can also carry out missions for traders, who will reward you with useful items. Traders also sell you things that you haven’t yet learned to craft yourself.\n\nThere are a lot of extraction shooters out there, from dystopian survival thriller Escape from Tarkov to the southern gothic horror of Hunt: Showdown 1896. What Arc Raiders brings is an excellent sense of style, with interesting environments, excellent music and audio, compelling lore and engrossing set-piece battles with the giant robots. Some enemies, such as the vast mecha-spider-like Matriarch, are absolutely huge and require lots of players to join forces in ad-hoc battles. These thrilling encounters have been widely shared on Twitch, TikTok and Instagram – as have comic moments where players fall off buildings, or accidentally kill themselves with guided missiles. The enemies, from the drone-like Wasps and Hornets to the lumbering land-based Bombardiers, are powered by machine-learning and AI that make them fun and unpredictable foes.\n\nJust jump in! Arc Raiders is available on PC, Xbox and PS5 and I’d recommend getting a gaming headset so you can chat to other players, if you haven’t got one. Also, listening to the world through headphones gives you a better understanding of where threats are coming from. Once you customise your character, you can start going on raids. In the beginning you can only access one map, the Dam Battlegrounds, but others such as the wrecked urban landscape of Buried City and the deadly industrial complex Stella Montis open up later. I’d advise sticking to the Dam until you have many hours of experience, as the other places are swarming with enemies and other players tend to be more aggressive. For your first few raids, just explore the map, get to grips with the different enemies and pop into buildings to search cabinets, lockers and desks for items.\n\nCollect absolutely everything at first – useful resources such as wires and springs will let you craft items later, while rare goods such as toasters and radios can be sold or recycled for scrap. You’ll begin with a very basic weapon and accessories but as you go you’ll find new guns, grenades and medicines, which you can store in your room or sell. With the money you earn, you can buy items from traders. It’s important to become self-sufficient as soon as possible, so concentrate on upgrading your workstations (where you craft new items). Whenever you find a blueprint, which teaches you a new item to craft, put it in your inventory’s safe pocket – this lets you keep it even if you’re killed during a raid. Blueprints are more likely to be found in high value areas (marked on your map in red) or during daily special events such as night raids and electromagnetic storms – but these are more risky and competitive.\n\nThese player guides by Games Radar, IGN and Rock Paper Shotgun are extremely useful.\n\nThe game’s skill tree has three branches – Conditioning, Mobility and Survival. You won’t be able to unlock everything, so think about how you’re going to play. I’d prioritise Mobility skills that focus on stamina at first as you’re going to be doing a LOT of running away. After this, it depends on you: if you’re going to fight other players, prioritise Conditioning skills: if you just want to loot and get outta there, prioritise the more stealth-focused Survival options.\n\nAs soon as you can, arm yourself with two guns: one that’s effective against Arc enemies (the Ferro is great for this); and one that is useful against other players, such as the Kettle or Stitcher, which are effective against even the best guns in the game. You should also carry bandages, shield rechargers and adrenaline shots. Consider taking smoke grenades everywhere as they’ll help you escape both Arc robots and aggressive players. Even when you have the best weapons and armour, you can still be overpowered by basic flying enemies such as Wasps and Hornets, so buy a bunch of seeker grenades – they’re cheap and highly effective against these tenacious foes.\n\nAs soon as you have the money, increase the size of your stash – ie the number of items you’re allowed to store. Keep doing this until you max it out to 280 slots. You’re gonna need them.\n\nIf you need to make money fast, go to Dam and visit the Pale Apartments, Ruby Residence and Pattern House – they are filled with high-value trinkets such as statues, snow globes and pottery jugs, and are relatively safe to explore.\n\nAt the beginning of each run, after you choose which map area you want to visit, the game offers you the chance to start with a basic gun and some health items. It lets you get to grips with the area and do a bit of looting without the risk of losing valuable equipment. This is a brilliant option for when you’re exploring a new map for the first time, or if you just need to recoup your supplies after being killed on a previous run.\n\nThe game takes aggressive behaviour into account when matching you with other players. If you shoot people, you’re more likely to be put on servers where people shoot back. If that doesn’t sound like fun, be nice to other raiders. Use the emote wheel to greet them, and join up to fight larger enemies. You’ll learn faster and I’ve often been given items by players who I’ve helped out.",

    "description": "Patrick Reed played on three professionalc circuits in 2025, but none of the were the PGA Tour,. He says he'd consider returning if he was given the opportunity",
    "fullText": "DUBAI — Patrick Reed is a true golfer of the world.\n\nIt’s why he’s in the Middle East to kick off his 2026 season with three DP World Tour events before the LIV Golf season starts next month. That globetrotting commitment to both the DP World and Asian tours is why he’s still ranked No. 41 in the world, despite LIV not receiving Official World Golf Ranking points.\n\nEarlier this month, the 2018 Masters champion was enjoying a well-earned rest following his 32-event 2025 season when news broke that fellow LIV golfer Brooks Koepka was going back to the PGA Tour via the newly established Returning Member Program. The plan was created for LIV players who have not been a PGA Tour member for two years and who have won the Masters, U.S. Open, PGA Championship, Open Championship or Players Championship from 2022-2025. Only Koepka, Cameron Smith, Bryson DeChambeau and Jon Rahm were eligible, and the latter three said last week they would continue to play on LIV.\n\nReed, who has played on LIV since its 2022 inaugural season and has one individual victory in 45 total starts, didn’t have the ability to consider the opportunity, but at the Dubai Invitational on Saturday, he was asked, hypothetically, if he would think about returning. “I mean, of course; if it were up to me, I'd play everywhere,” Reed said.\n\nHe does play everywhere. In 2025, the Texan teed up in 14 LIV events, four majors, 10 DP World Tour tournaments and four Asian Tour stops. “I'm already playing on three tours, why not add one more?” he added with a laugh. “I always enjoyed my time out there on the PGA Tour. Let's be honest, out there, it's the best tour in the world. Look at what they've done in golf … I could see myself playing there at some point again. But right now, you just never know; everything's so fluid.”\n\nSince donning the green jacket in 2018, Reed, 35, has been a regular feature in majors. He was fourth at the U.S. Open at Shinnecock immediately after his Masters victory and 10th at the 2019 Open Championship. He logged top-10s at Augusta National in 2020 and 2021 before becoming a serious Masters contender again. Reed finished T-4 in 2023 and T-3 last year, where he was genuinely in the hunt on the back nine on Sunday.\n\nDespite that form in golf’s four biggest events recently, Reed is not eligible for the Returning Member Program, given it rewards major victories after LIV debuted in 2022.\n\n“Right now, it's not even a decision,” Reed said. “That was for ’22 and on winners. So, I definitely would have to think about it … if that number [came] down to 2018. Right now, it's hard to say really what we're going to do or anything like that. Right now, the biggest thing is trying to play some good golf these [two] weeks, not only to solidify myself out here on DP, but to have a good momentum going into the year.”\n\nReed, a nine-time PGA Tour winner, was given honorary life membership on the DP World Tour in 2019 due to his staunch support of the European circuit. His commitment will run even deeper this year when he is likely to be paying fines for each LIV event he plays that conflicts with a DP World Tour tournament. The amount of each fine is not known.\n\nAs reported by The Telegraph, LIV Golf has paid fines in the past on behalf of its players but will no longer do so in 2026. That won’t stop Reed though, although he says he’d “love for it to be resolved.”\n\n“I always plan on showing my support on this tour and it's not going to stop me,” Reed said. “Starting this year, any fines or anything like that will go on the players, not on LIV. Right now, playing [these three] DP World Tour events [before the LIV season starts Feb. 4], I'm not getting fined.\n\n“Me travelling and playing around the world … it helps this tour, but also it's something I've always held true to my heart and wanted to do. So, if that's what it takes [paying the fines], that's what it takes.\n\n“I've always wanted to be a worldwide player,” he said.",

    "title": "An Alaskan mine that's been in political limbo for years might be the key to satisfying America's huge appetite for copper",
    "description": "S&P Global said in a recent analysis that copper supply would fall short of demand for the next 15 years, barring significant increases in production.",
    "fullText": "Copper prices are soaring, and supply is expected to badly lag demand in the coming decade, but a small Alaska mine that's been in political limbo for years might hold the key to meeting the voracious appetite for the metal.\n\nBristol Bay is located in the southwest corner of Alaska, in the easternmost arm of the Bering Sea. The area boasts one of the nation's richest sockeye salmon runs. It's also home to a stalled project to mine a resource that's highly important to the AI infrastructure boom.\n\nLocals know all about the Pebble Mine project. The site was touted as having the potential to bring an economic windfall to the remote area, but was stalled by an EPA ruling. The wrangling over the project has gone on for over a decade and has spanned three presidential administrations—but with a copper shortage looming, the mining project has been thrust back into the spotlight.\n\nCopper prices are up sharply, breaking above $12,000 a ton for the first time in the last week and rising more than 40% in 12 months. The AI buildout is one factor that's sent demand soaring. However, a study by S&P Global this month said that supply will fall massively short between now and 2040, barring a sizable increase in production.\n\nThe firm predicts that copper production will peak in 2030, leaving the world roughly 10 million metric tons short by 2040.\n\nThe Pebble Mine project sits on vast copper and gold reserves. However, its operations have been blocked since 2014 under an Environmental Protection Agency provision that has remained in place across the Obama, Biden, and Trump administrations.\n\n\"Pebble is a world-class deposit,\" Deantha Skibinski, who serves as executive director of the Alaska Miners Association, told Business Insider. \"The copper in the ground at the pebble project is immense.\"\n\nShe added that there are few copper producers in the US with the type of reserves that Pebble Mine is sitting on. The project's owner says the site is the world's largest undeveloped store of both copper and gold. It also has large deposits of molybdenum and silver, two metals that also play a role in the AI buildout.\n\nSkibinski recalled the EPA's 2014 decision to block the mine during its exploratory phase after it failed a watershed assessment.\n\n\"What they did, which we contend is not legal, is that they issued the 404(c) veto preemptively, meaning before the company went into permitting,\" she said. \"And that is unprecedented.\"\n\nPebble Limited responded with a lawsuit, kicking off a long, complicated legal saga. More than a decade later, the mine is still not in operation.\n\nNow, as the US under Trump scrambles to secure domestic supplies of critical materials, Skibinski thinks the Pebble Mine project should get another look by the administration.\n\n\"You would think that the government should fully examine, transparently and honestly, how to get more mines that produce copper and other minerals online,\" she said. \"But when you talk about what it actually takes, there are many that say they're not interested in going that route.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump expressed support for other Alaska mining endeavors during his first term, including the Pebble Mine and a project that would open up the state's mineral-rich Ambler Mining District. But the New York Times reported in 2020 that Donald Trump Jr. opposed the mine's construction, citing the potential environmental impacts.\n\nA spokesperson for Trump Jr. did not return a request for comment. The White House did not reply to a request for comment about the administration's current stance on the Pebble Mine project.\n\n\"It is crucial for the President and all the federal agencies that may be holding up Pebble to understand that copper is vital for meeting our needs of a modern society that relies on it,\" said Lisa Reimers, an area native and the CEO of construction and logistics company Iliamna Development. \"Pebble Mine is an important project for the United States so we are not to be dependent on foreign companies for copper.\"",

    "fullText": "The next stop on Donald Trump’s world tour—or takeover—may be America’s northern neighbor.\n\nThe president, 79, has turned his attention toward Canada, fixating on what he sees as vulnerabilities along its northern border that could be exploited by U.S. adversaries Russia or China, two U.S. officials, a senior administration official, and three former senior U.S. officials told NBC News.\n\n“They certainly need to up their game when it comes to Arctic capabilities,” one official told the outlet, adding that Canada’s northern border “is not acceptable given today’s threats” and that “the status quo is not enough.”\n\nTrump has repeatedly complained about what he views as Canada’s weak defenses, sparking conversations with Canadian officials about a broader Arctic security strategy, NBC reported. Among the initiatives that have caught Trump’s interest are expanded U.S. maritime patrols and the purchase of additional icebreakers—specialized ships designed to operate in ice-covered waters—operating in or around Canadian territory.\n\n“Trump is really worried about the U.S. continuing to drift in the Western Hemisphere and is focused on this,” one official told NBC.\n\nThey added: “At the end of the day, this is to stop Russia and China from having a further presence in the Arctic.”\n\nWith 3.85 million square miles and 40 million residents, Canada is the largest target on Trump’s growing list of potential land grabs.\n\nThe conversations come as Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney met with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing on Friday, signaling an effort to deepen ties between the two countries. Carney became the first Canadian leader to visit China since 2017.\n\nTrump’s fixation on Canada, aides say, is part of a broader effort to “solidify” the Western Hemisphere—and falls in line with his aggressive campaign to acquire Greenland, the semiautonomous Danish territory.\n\n“Canada stands to benefit from the U.S. having Greenland,” one administration official said.\n\nCarney on Friday voiced support for Denmark’s NATO membership and said Greenland—home to roughly 57,000 residents and located northeast of Canada—should determine its own future.\n\nTrump’s increasingly frequent assertions that “We do need Greenland, absolutely,” for defense purposes, have rattled Denmark, whose leaders have repeatedly warned they will not give up the world’s largest island, and that an American takeover would end NATO.\n\nWhite House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller asserted on Saturday that under “the law,” nations were not entitled to their territory if they were unable to defend it. The Trump aide belittled the Danish government, saying its “tiny” military was failing to adequately protect Greenland.\n\n“With respect to Denmark, Denmark is a tiny country with a tiny economy, and a tiny military,” Miller said of Fox’s Hannity.\n\n“They cannot defend Greenland. They cannot control the territory of Greenland. Under every understanding of law that has existed about territorial control for 500 years, to control a territory you have to be able to defend a territory, improve territory, inhabit a territory. Denmark has failed on every single one of these tests.”\n\nMeanwhile, officials told NBC that the White House has voiced similar criticisms of Canada, which has increased its defense spending but continues to fall short of NATO’s goal.\n\n“The world doesn’t see Canada as a major force when it comes to defense,” the official told NBC.\n\nTrump has previously said “it’s highly unlikely” he would use military force against Canada. But after his shock invasion of Venezuela and the abduction of then-President Nicholas Maduro on Jan. 3., the president has not ruled out deploying U.S. military troops to countries including Colombia, U.S. ally Mexico, and Greenland.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to the White House and to Carney’s representatives for comment.",

    "fullText": "SYDNEY, N.S. — American netminder Bianca Birittieri made an incredible 38 saves, while linemates Emily Pohl and Lindsay Stepnowski scored in the first and second, to help lead the United States to a 2-0 gold medal victory Sunday night at U18 Women's Worlds in Nova Scotia — and not just any gold medal world championship win at that.\n\nThe Americans reclaimed gold medal bragging rights, marking their 10th title at the IIHF Under-18 Women's World Championship, and did so on Canadian ice, in front of a sold-out crowd of more than 5,000 fans at Centre 200 in Cape Breton Island.\n\nNot only did they fight against a sea of red and white spectators and a strong, skilled Canadian squad, but according to the International Ice Hockey Federation, this American contingent is the first national under-18 team to ever win \"perfect gold\" at U18 Women's Worlds, which means the stripes and stars squad never trailed an opponent and were never tied throughout the entire week-and-a-half-long international tournament.\n\nThis was a history-making world championship.\n\nThe U.S. coaching staff told its team to \"do the same thing we've been doing,\" Pohl said to media of the stick-to-habits message she and her teammates followed throughout the tournament, since it proved so successful, and ultimately \"perfect\" in the IIHF stats.\n\n\"Obviously, I think we did it well,\" Pohl said, a big smile on her face and a gold medal wrapped around her neck, teammates Taila Hansen and Birittieri at her side.\n\n\"We just played fast, re-loaded(ed) pucks and just worked our hearts out,\" added Hansen, whose smile matched her teammates and message echoed what head coach Courtney Kennedy told media after the game.\n\n\"They've been training and buying in every day, all the time,\" said Kennedy, whose lineage hails from Glace Bay on Cape Breton Island in Nova Scotia, slight tears forming in her eyes as she spoke of her late grandmother and family from the host province for the world championship.\n\n\"We were kind of hard on them in terms of trying to understand the system,\" Kennedy said. \"It's not a crazy system — it's literally play from your heart and play for each other, and they chose to do that, and... watching them today, they chose time and time again to play the right way.\"\n\nBut truth be told, while earlier tournament games featured large gaps between teams, in particular between the top two North American squads and their opponents, this gold medal game could have gone either way, with one single play able to make the difference at any time. As women's hockey followers know, this is par for the course between the long-time rivals.\n\nAs for starting Birittieri in the crease Sunday, \"there were saves she made that just stole the momentum... and you can just take the wind out of the sails of a team, and you need that, \" Kennedy said of why she picked her for the gold medal game.\n\n\"There's one save, one save in a game that can almost put the nail in the coffin, and she made that one save; I want to say it was on Milani on that left side, I was like, 'wow,' and you could just feel it,\" Kennedy said.\n\n\"Because that Canada team is incredibly talented and they did nothing but play their hearts out, too,\" she said.\n\nAs for Brittieri, \"it's always an hounour to wear the jersey, and to get the chance to play in the gold medal game and get the win is just incredible,\" the humbl goalie told reporters, flanked by Hansen, Pohl and their gold medals.\n\nBoth sides of the border stepped onto the ice Sunday night prepared, but Pohl's goal came early at 14:08 in the first on an assist from Hansen, and that set an intense but winning pace for the United States.\n\n\"She executed it perfectly; I just had to tap it in,\" Pohl said of the opening the scoring with help from her linemate.\n\n\"I was going up to the dot and was like what are we going to do,\" Hansen said of her assist. \"I was going to (put it back)... but then I was like, 'no, go forward,' and it worked out.\"\n\nHansen also helped out on Stepnowski's goal at 18:17 in the second period to seal the deal for the Americans, who were able to hold Canada's determined offence at bay through the remainder of the game despite the red and white crashing the net, pulling netminder Lea-Rose Charrois for 11 seconds late in the third in an attempt to create a scoring chance, and a much-needed timeout to strategize a potential late-game comeback — which is always possible when Canada and the United States face off.\n\nFor her part, Lea-Rose Charrois made 25 saves to help keep Canada in the game.\n\n\"We started really strong,\" Canadian head coach Vicky Sunohara said in the mixed zone. \"The skating, puck in deep, the forechecking. I thought we had opportunities, but we didn't bury the puck ,and there were times when we shot when we didn't have anybody driving the net, and gave their goalie confidence; didn't really challenge her.\n\n\"I think for the most part, though, you get one in and it could change the momentum,\" Sunohara agreed with a single play potentially changing the game.\n\n\"I thought we gave it everything we had; they're a very good team and they worked hard for 60 minutes, so I'm not taking anything away from them.\"\n\n\"I think as a group we did reallly well,\" agreed Canadian captain Hayley McDonald, a silver medal around her neck despite a tear-stained face.\n\n\"It's truly an honour to play not just for your country, but on home turf, and having this game sold out is amazing,\" she said.\n\nBut Canada's best efforts couldn't stop the U.S. from its \"perfect gold\" at the 2026 rematch of U18 worlds past.\n\nThe IIHF also handed out its individual awards after Sunday's gold medal game, with 16-year-old American forward Jane Daley of Medfield, Mass., winning most valuable player for her 12 goals and oustanding offence on behalf of the world champions.\n\nLeading the All-Star Team, which was voted on by accredited media attending the event, she was joined by American captain and defender Margaret Averill, along with Canadian forwards Adrianna Milani and Sofia Ismael, as well as red and white blueliner Megan Mossey.\n\nTop goalie honours went to Switzerland's Norina Schrupowski, who made 149 saves on a whopping 159 shots to post an impressive 93.71 save percentage over 227 minutes between the crease, according to IIHF official stats.\n\nThe IIHF Directorate also handed out awards, including Best Goalkeeper to Schrupowski, Best Defender to Averill and Best Forward to Daley.\n\n\"USA Hockey has a really high standard and they recruit the best players,\" Hansen said of the philopshy behind the American road to gold, which could set the standard for what happens on the ice at the 2026 Olympic Winter Games in Milano, Italy.\n\n\"The coaches, the staff, everyone,\" she said. \"I think just buying into what they say and doing it for each other, they really preach that, doing it for the teammate next to you, holding that rope for them... that kind of sets the standard, and everyone knows that at all levels.\"",

    "fullText": "Despite leaving Liverpool as one of the most highly regarded coaches in world football in 2024, Jurgen Klopp said he never thought of himself as amongst the game's best.\n\n\"I never considered myself a world-class coach,\" Klopp told AFP and other media in an interview in Leipzig, \"because I still had so many questions when I finished.\"\n\n\"I was like 'how can I be world-class with these questions still?'\"\n\nAfter starting out at Mainz, where he took the club to the top flight for the first time, Klopp moved to Borussia Dortmund, where he won two Bundesliga titles and reached the 2013 Champions League final.\n\nAfter signing with Liverpool in 2015, Klopp's Reds won every trophy on offer, including the Champions League and Premier League.\n\nIn his new role as Red Bull's global head of football, where he oversees a multi-club structure with teams including RB Leipzig, New York Red Bulls and Paris FC, Klopp said that he wants to help coaches answer those questions.\n\n\"My role with the coaches is to be the guy I never had. I sat in my office very, very, very often, very, very, very alone.\n\n\"A lot of people gave me advice and have great ideas... It's great to have ideas, but it's really not that easy to make the final decision.\n\n\"I want to be in moments when I know they are alone, or feel alone. I want to be there.\"\n\nKlopp oversaw the firing of then-Leipzig coach Marco Rose, a long-time friend, in 2025 and said that being on the other side felt odd.\n\n\"Grave-digger of the coaches -- that's a title I never wanted to win!\"\n\n- 'I never watch the goals back' -\n\nFrom taking Mainz to the Bundesliga to breaking Liverpool's Premier League drought, Klopp improved clubs and players wherever he went.\n\nOften taking over with teams at a low ebb, the coach would try and put things in perspective.\n\n\"How did I start a game? I would say 'the worst news is you can lose it' -- so let's try and win it... Do not try to avoid defeat -- try to win.\"\n\nThe coach said he told his players: \"Giving your all doesn't mean you will get anything, but it's your only chance to get something. That's pretty much how you do it.\n\n\"We gave everything -- and sometimes we got something.\"\n\nKlopp said that media and fans were too focused on results.\n\n\"I never watch the goals back, because I want to understand the game to the left and the right of the result.\n\n\"I want to understand why it happened... Results are the result of the performance. So we worked on the performance and the results came later.\"\n\nThe 58-year-old said that he \"didn't take any pride\" out of trophy ceremonies and parades.\n\n\"I love being a part of it, not in the middle of it. You might see pictures where someone gave me a trophy and I'd take it, but I didn't need to touch it.\n\n\"For me, it was the journey that I loved. That gave me much more than the moment (of winning).\"\n\n- 'You know if Jurgen Klopp is in the room' -\n\nKlopp retains cult-like status at his former clubs, with fans remembering the German for his sideline antics and everyman appeal as much as his successes.\n\nRB Leipzig sporting director Marcel Schaefer told AFP that Klopp has brought the same presence into his new role, even if he is no longer on the sideline.\n\n\"He has something that is unique. He has a god-given talent which everyone knows from his coaching jobs.\n\n\"He can catch people in five to 10 minutes.\"\n\nSchaefer said that Klopp plays an important role in player recruitment by \"talking to families, talking to players about our vision, about our project.\n\n\"You know if Jurgen Klopp is in the room.\"\n\nSince stepping down at Anfield, Klopp has been linked to an array of high-profile coaching jobs, but said that a return to the dugout is unlikely.\n\n\"I don't expect to change my mind, but I don't know.\n\n\"We're building a house right now and my missus wanted to have a really big trophy room. There was another small room and I said 'this is enough, because we know how many trophies we have, we will not add any'.\n\n\"It might sound arrogant, but I know I can coach a football team. But I don't need to do it until my last day.\"",

    "fullText": "China is now a key market for global carmakers, and, surprisingly, buyers there are shifting back to sedans that offer serious tech. Automakers are pushing boundaries to get noticed, and Nissan is one of them. The brand launched two new electrified sedans and a refreshed Teana late last year – the latter being the more premium take on the Altima sold in the US.\n\nThe new Teana, built by Dongfeng Nissan, puts a big emphasis on tech and interior quality. It looks a class above what you’d expect from an Altima-based sedan. Part of that comes from a glowing AI speaker on the dash, but the real surprise is the material choice. Nissan worked with Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation (MCC) to use Durabio, a plant-based plastic that looks and feels closer to crystal than the usual trim.\n\nIn China, buyers care about big screens, lighting, and how upscale a car feels. The Teana’s interior is built to make a strong first impression, and it stands out even more when you see it lit up at night.\n\nDurabio is more than just a marketing fluff. MCC developed it as a bio-based plastic using plant-derived isosorbide. It’s clearer and handles light better than regular polycarbonate, which helps create lighting that looks deep and high-end instead of cheap or artificial.\n\nOn the Teana, Durabio is used for the inverted-pyramid AI speaker that lights up with six pillars glowing in up to 256 colors. The material refracts light cleanly, giving it a crystal-like look without needing a clear coat. That saves manufacturing steps, lowers environmental footprint, and still meets automotive durability standards.\n\nTeana runs a Huawei-based operating system to go with Durabio. The end result is an interior that feels modern and thoughtfully put together (at least visually), not just a quick update.\n\nMeanwhile, the US-market Altima heads into 2026 with almost no changes from last year. It remains affordable and practical, but next to the Teana, it comes across as very restrained. Nissan still sells a lot of sedans in the US, with over 255,000 units last year (out of the brand's over 760,000-unit sales), but the Altima’s own sales dropped to 93,268 in 2025, down 18 percent from the year before.\n\nThat drop probably comes from the Altima’s age. The current model dates back to 2018, with its last big update in 2022. It no longer stands out for design or interior appeal. After seeing what Nissan has done with the Teana, it’s fair to ask (hope, even) if a more upscale, more distinctive Altima could bring buyers back to the midsize sedan segment.\n\nFor now, there’s no clear answer. But with China getting the more ambitious upgrades, it’s easy to see how a bit of that Durabio-inspired thinking could only help the Altima.\n\nView the 9 images of this gallery on the original article",

It's raised fears of an end to NATO — a decades-old alliance that has been a pillar of American strength in Europe and around the globe — and raised questions on Capitol Hill and around the world about what Trump's aggressive, go-it-alone foreign policy will mean for world order.  “When the most powerful military nation on earth threatens your territory through its president over and over and over again, you start to take it seriously,” Sen.

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Republican lawmakers are scrambling to contain President Donald Trump's threats of taking possession of Greenland, with some showing the most strident opposition to almost anything the Trump administration has done since taking office.\n\nThey gave floor speeches on the importance of NATO last week. They introduced bills meant to prevent the U.S. from attacking Denmark. And several traveled to Copenhagen to meet with Danish counterparts.\n\nBut it's not clear that will be enough, as the president continues to insist that he will take control of the Arctic island. It's raised fears of an end to NATO — a decades-old alliance that has been a pillar of American strength in Europe and around the globe — and raised questions on Capitol Hill and around the world about what Trump's aggressive, go-it-alone foreign policy will mean for world order.\n\n“When the most powerful military nation on earth threatens your territory through its president over and over and over again, you start to take it seriously,” Sen. Chris Coons told The Associated Press.\n\nThe Delaware Democrat organized the bipartisan trip to Denmark to “bring the temperature down a bit,” he said, as well as further talks about mutual military agreements in the Arctic. Republican Sens. Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska accompanied a handful of Democrats on the trip. Also, Republican lawmakers joined in meetings in Washington last week with the Danish foreign minister and his Greenlandic counterpart where they discussed security agreements.\n\nYet it's clear Trump has other ideas. He said Saturday he will charge a 10% import tax starting in February on goods from eight European nations because of their opposition to his Greenland plans.\n\nTrump said on social media that because of modern weapons systems “the need to ACQUIRE is especially important.”\n\nThe pushback to Trump's Greenland plans\n\nKey Republicans have made clear they think that forcefully taking Greenland is out of the question. But so far, they've avoided directly rebuking Trump for his talk of possessing the island.\n\nTillis on social media called Trumps tariff plans “bad for America, bad for American businesses, and bad for America’s allies.”\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., told reporters Thursday that “there’s certainly not an appetite here for some of the options that have been talked about or considered.”\n\nIn a floor speech, Thune's predecessor as Republican leader, Sen. Mitch McConnell, warned that an attempt to seize Greenland would “shatter the trust of allies\" and tarnish Trump's legacy with a disastrous foreign policy decision.\n\nRepublican and Democratic lawmakers alike see an obvious path to bolstering American interests in Greenland while keeping the relationship with NATO-ally Denmark intact.\n\nIn a meeting with lawmakers Thursday, Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen and his Greenlandic counterpart Vivian Motzfeldt discussed how the countries could work together to develop critical mineral industries and military cooperation, Coons said. The diplomats also told the senators there is no evidence of Chinese or Russian activity in Greenland.\n\nTrump has made the argument that the U.S. should take Greenland before China or Russia do, prompting worry across Europe. Troops from several nations have been sent to Greenland in support of Denmark.\n\nMurkowski said on social media that “our NATO allies are being forced to divert attention and resources to Greenland, a dynamic that plays directly into Putin’s hands by threatening the stability of the strongest coalition of democracies the world has ever seen.”\n\nLawmakers are looking at a few options for taking a military attack on Greenland off the table. Still, the Trump administration has shown little if any willingness to get congressional approval before taking military action.\n\nLawmakers, including Republicans like Murkowski, are pushing legislation that would prohibit Department of Defense funds from being used to attack or occupy territory that belongs to other NATO members without their consent.\n\nThe Alaska senator also suggested Congress could act to nullify Trump's tariffs. Murkowski and several other Republicans have already helped pass resolutions last year meant to undo tariffs around the globe, but those pieces of legislation did not gain traction in the House. They would have also required Trump's signature or support from two-thirds of both chambers to override his veto.\n\nDemocrats have also found some traction with war powers resolutions meant to force the president to get congressional approval before engaging in hostilities. Republicans last week narrowly defeated one such resolution that would prohibit Trump from attacking Venezuela again, and Democrats think there could potentially be more Republicans who would support one applying to Greenland.\n\n“What I’ve noticed is these war powers resolutions, they do put some pressure on Republicans,” said Sen. Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat who has forced votes on several similar resolutions. He said the tactic has also compelled the Trump administration to provide lawmakers with briefings and commitments to get congressional approval before deploying troops.\n\nStill, while dismissing the Venezuela war powers resolution on Wednesday, Republican leaders made the argument that the legislation should be ruled out of order because the Trump administration has said there are currently no U.S. troops on the ground in Venezuela.\n\nThat argument may set a precedent for future war powers resolutions, giving Republicans a way to avoid voting against Trump's wishes.\n\n“If you don't have boots on the ground, it's a moot point,” said Sen. Mike Rounds, a South Dakota Republican, about war powers resolutions in general. He also argued that the prospect of taking Greenland over the objections of Denmark is nothing \"more than a hypothetical.”\n\nOther Republicans have expressed support for Trump's insistence that the U.S. possess Greenland, though they have downplayed the idea that the U.S. would take it by force.\n\nThat's left the strongest objections on the Republican side of the aisle coming from a handful of lawmakers who are leaving Congress next year.\n\nRep. Don Bacon, a Nebraska Republican, told The Omaha World Herald that an invasion of Greenland would lead to Trump's impeachment — something he would “lean” towards supporting.\n\nTillis, another retiring Republican, has directed his criticism at Trump advisors like White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller.\n\n“The fact that a small handful of ‘advisors’ are actively pushing for coercive action to seize territory of an ally is beyond stupid,” he said.",

    "fullText": "Braves $38M clubhouse leader, Gold Glove winner, World Series champion could retire after 2026 season originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Atlanta Braves have done fairly well this offseason, with most of their major moves coming early. However, if there is one area where the Braves can still improve, it is the starting rotation. Braves GM Alex Anthopoulos isn’t just looking for any starter — he wants someone capable of starting a playoff game in October.\n\n“We’ve explored the starting rotation, adding and getting some type of starter, whether that’s trade or signing. We’d like for it to be someone impactful, someone we think can start a playoff game,” Anthopoulos said.\n\nThe Braves are usually known for having a strong rotation, but last season was different as injuries piled up throughout the year. Looking ahead to 2026, the rotation appears to be in good shape, but it’s the years beyond that where things get interesting for Atlanta.\n\n“Beyond Spencer Strider and Spencer Schwellenbach, there are no clear locks for the Atlanta Braves rotation beyond 2026,’” HTHB’s Chase Owens wrote.\n\nOne big name to monitor beyond this season is veteran Chris Sale. With Sale nearing his 40s, it will be interesting to see how he evaluates where he is in his career once the season concludes. HTHB’s Steven Teal believes Sale could be done with baseball if he has a strong 2026 campaign.\n\n“As far as his health goes, Atlanta's training staff, along with Sale making some lifestyle changes, has helped keep him on the field successfully. As mentioned above, his rib injury was just a freak thing as he made a great diving play against the Mets, hoping for a complete game. Had that injury not occurred, Sale would have likely completed the season and thrown over 170 innings again. There's no reason to believe he won't be as good this season for the Braves. If he pitches well enough, he could complete his career,” Teal wrote.\n\nWhile losing Sale would undoubtedly hurt, the veteran starter has put together an outstanding career and has little left to prove. During his time with the Braves, he has largely silenced critics who labeled him as injury-prone.\n\nSale has also been a valuable mentor in the clubhouse and within the pitching staff, but there is a real possibility that this season could be the end of the line for him. If so, the Braves may soon be saying goodbye to one of their most respected clubhouse leaders.",

    "title": "At This Office Park, Scamming the World Was the Business",
    "description": "Times journalists got a rare look inside one of the compounds where the online fraud industry makes its billions. Inspirational slogans (“Keep going”) were just the start.",
    "fullText": "Reporting from Min Let Pan, Myanmar\n\nIn a Southeast Asian war zone, cloaked in dense rainforest, the Chinese settlement dedicated to scamming people from Kentucky to Kazakhstan grew fast on fertile ground.\n\nOver just a few months, a sprawling office park materialized and metastasized in the chaotic borderlands of Myanmar, with cavernous rooms holding rows of computer monitors and walls decorated with inspirational work slogans: “Dream chaser,” “Keep going,” “Making money matters the most.” In video conference suites, bookshelves stocked with fake business tomes and ersatz modern art simulated the kind of boardroom a successful crypto investor might inhabit.\n\nThe scam center, Shunda Park, opened for business in 2024 with more than 3,500 workers from nearly 30 nations, including Namibia, Russia, Zimbabwe and France. Some had been kidnapped and enslaved, but all had become skilled in the art of the online grift. When the scammers bilked $5,000 out of someone, they struck a Chinese gong. A $50,000 shakedown earned a celebratory pounding of a giant drum, then an offering to a Chinese deity resplendent in his golden altar.\n\nWhile each nationality required a different approach — for Americans, one scammer told me, the preferred mark was “white old men” — the general approach was the same: an online foray by a sympathetic and attractive person, followed by an invitation to participate in a select investment opportunity.\n\nVictims were not just lonely hearts or technologically timid retirees. Using generative intelligence and deepfake videos, as well as fraudulent businesses, websites and financial apps, the scammers at Shunda embraced the long con and reeled in people from almost every demographic.\n\nBut in late November, Shunda Park was unexpectedly captured by a rebel force long at odds with the Myanmar military, whose coup nearly five years ago catapulted this Southeast Asian nation into civil war and created a chaotic space for criminality to thrive. The photographer Jes Aznar and I were granted rare access to the scam compound to document the inner sanctum of this secretive, highly fortified industry. Shunda Park had been closed for business by the rebel militia, but we were able to meet some of its scammers, both those who were trying to return home and others who wanted to find another job in the fraud business.\n\nWith millions of people falling victim to online shakedowns every year, the cyberscamming industry has quickly grown into one of the planet’s most lucrative criminal enterprises, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.\n\nIn the United States alone, in 2024, at least $10 billion was stolen through cyberscams run out of Southeast Asia, the U.S. Treasury Department said. That figure is likely only a fraction of the true toll because victims are often too embarrassed to admit they have been fooled. Late last year, the United States formed its first ever federal task force to combat scam centers and the Chinese transnational crime networks that American investigators say run them.\n\nThe Myanmar junta, which has imprisoned members of an elected government and killed thousands of civilians, recently vowed to tackle the scam networks. But its current crackdown feels like a Potemkin exercise. The global profits from online cons rival the gross domestic products of the countries where the fraud factories have proliferated, including Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos.\n\nThese illicit proceeds do not just line the pockets of the gangs, most of which are originally from China; dirty money also flows to powerful elites across the region — most of all, crime-watchers say, to powerful people in the conflict-ridden, failed state of Myanmar.\n\nOur journey to Shunda Park occurred during what was supposed to be a lull in the fighting between the Myanmar military and the opposition militia, known as the Karen National Liberation Army. (The Karen, pronounced Kuh-REN, are one of Myanmar’s many ethnic groups that have been persecuted by the military for generations.)\n\nWhat we discovered inside Shunda Park’s thick walls ringed by razor wire resembled a set for an apocalyptic film. Amid white office blocks, Chinese restaurants and luxury villas reserved for the compound’s Chinese bosses, bonfires burned, consuming the tools of the illicit economy. Piles of electronic equipment — keyboards, tangles of cables and thousands of cellphones — littered the site. In some buildings, with nearly every step I took, I crunched on SIM cards, scattered like snow in the tropical heat.\n\nWhile members of the Karen militia handed over armfuls of evidence to the police in Thailand, along with a man identified as the compound’s Chinese boss, no representatives of foreign governments or intelligence agencies have come to Shunda Park to investigate. Now, the fighting has intensified, and all of Shunda Park’s workers have scattered. Other proof of scamming has gone up in flames.\n\n“We are trying our best, but we are not scam experts,” said Padoh Saw Taw Nee, the spokesman for the K.N.L.A.’s political wing, as he leafed through a notebook with instructions on how to cheat middle-aged women in Taiwan. “We do not like that our land is known as the place where criminals cheat people.”\n\nThe layers of victimhood at a place like Shunda Park are complex. Many of the scammers who worked here say they were duped, too. They arrived in neighboring Thailand, thinking they had been hired for well-paying tech or marketing jobs. Others thought they were checking out merchandise for online sales businesses. Instead, they were hustled at gunpoint across the river that demarcates the border with Myanmar.\n\nI spoke with several scammers whose bodies bore scars from beatings or tight shackles. They never received payment for their 12-hour shifts, they said. Life was a Sisyphean loop: sleep, eat, scam, eat, sleep, scam.\n\nKason, a 22-year-old from Malaysia who is being identified only by his first name, said he suffered only two “hard” beatings. But his legs and torso were crisscrossed with traces of lacerations from what he called “many, many” smaller beatings.\n\nHis job for more than a year was to send endless “hellos” into the social media ether. If he did not receive responses from at least 5 percent of the greetings, then he would be punished physically, he said.\n\nIvan, a Malaysian who once worked as a member of the ground staff at the Singapore airport, said he was chained in a crucifixion position and denied food for days.\n\n“You think you know hell,” he said, “and it’s actually even worse.”\n\nIn one of the Shunda Park workrooms, bobblehead dolls and fake gold bars enlivened the space. At the front, near a statue of a Chinese god worshiped by the gangsters, were three port-a-potty style boxes that scammers said were used as punishment chambers, in clear sight of the rest of the room. Elsewhere in the compound, behind a barbecue restaurant, a row of cement torture cells was outfitted with bars and shackles.\n\nNot all the workers at Shunda landed there unwillingly. Many of the Chinese employees at Shunda Park received salaries, a review of records in one finance office shows. A company called Huisheng International, for instance, had stacks of wage receipts, sick-leave forms and medical tests for H.I.V. and syphilis, among other diseases, all written in Chinese. Employees were identified by nicknames like “Eastern Dragon” or “Little Li.” Contracts in the office specified that workers would be bound by Myanmar labor law.\n\nWhile most of the workers at Shunda Park were transported to safety via Thailand, about 900 Chinese workers refused to leave for more than two weeks, despite the compound being in the middle of an active conflict zone. The Chinese government has periodically cracked down on the scamming industry, arresting Chinese workers who are repatriated. So tense was the situation that days before our visit, some Chinese workers had tried unsuccessfully to wrestle weapons away from the Karen soldiers, according to members of the militia and other scammers who witnessed the melee.\n\nAll but one Chinese man at the compound refused to speak with me. The scammers shielded their faces with their hands or with masks. The one worker who agreed to talk said he had been promised a salary of 30,000 yuan a month, or $4,250. But upon arriving, he said, he only received 30,000 Thai baht a month, or $940. Records in the finance office showed base salaries of that amount.\n\n“They tricked me,” he said of his employers. The boom of shelling punctuated our conversation.\n\nAround him, rotten food festered. On the basketball court and by a nightclub, fires smoldered. A French bulldog that used to be cared for by one of the compound’s Chinese managers padded by, before collapsing in the shade provided by a luxury sedan. The cars on site came from all over Myanmar, including a fire department vehicle from halfway across the country. There was also an oil tanker truck with Chinese license plates.\n\nThe Myanmar military appears determined to reclaim Shunda Park, even as it dynamites buildings in other scam centers to show it is tough on crime. Workers at those raided sites, also run by Chinese criminal networks, however, say the crackdowns are just for show. In fact, some of the workers at Shunda said they had just arrived from these cleared out compounds. With international sanctions biting, Myanmar’s generals, supported by business allies and sympathetic militias, have embraced various illicit economies, making the country a global crime capital.\n\nOutside the scam compounds, life is impoverished and insecure. The Myanmar military regularly launches airstrikes around Shunda Park, and across the rest of the country, targeting civilians. More than 3.5 million people nationwide are now displaced.\n\nAs the shelling intensified, we climbed into pickup trucks and sped away. Our driver, the commander of the K.N.L.A.’s special forces, varied his speed to ward off the suicide drones that terrorize the area’s roads. A few days before, an armed drone detonated a bus length away from one of the trucks.\n\nIn the next village, in an area where an ethnic armed group aligned with the junta had held sway, I spotted more neat rows of scam centers being built, Chinese red lanterns hanging from the eaves. Chinese workers wandered through the construction site, shirts off in the heat.\n\nA few days later, the 900 or so Chinese workers left Shunda. Some went over the border to Thailand. But most headed to other Chinese compounds in the wilds of Myanmar, where scammers are busy finding their next victims.\n\nBerry Wang contributed research.",

    "title": "In my 60s, I sold the home I raised my son in and took a job on a cruise ship. It gave me the freedom I needed.",
    "description": "After selling my longtime home at nearly 70, I paid off debt, traveled the world, and rediscovered confidence and creativity.",
    "fullText": "At almost 70, with my son grown and building his own creative life, I realized the home I had poured myself into for two decades no longer supported the future I wanted.\n\nFor almost 20 years, that house looked like the picture of stability. Teal doors, a tire swing, and a sunny studio beside the garage. It was where I raised my son as a single mother and built my photography career. Most people assumed I would stay there forever.\n\nBut when my son graduated and moved to Orlando, something shifted. I had spent years encouraging him to live the life he wanted. Suddenly, I realized I needed to do the same.\n\nBehind the postcard charm, a truth emerged. The house no longer supported my future. What once felt like a comfortable sanctuary had become a moneypit, its growing debt reminding me daily that I could not afford the life or the freedom I wanted. I had built a home to raise a confident and independent child, and I had done that, but holding on to the house was keeping me from evolving into the next chapter of my life, a chapter filled with creative possibilities that debt made impossible to pursue.\n\nSorting through the rooms, I noticed how little the objects mattered. It was never the things, only the memories. And memories do not require storage space. I photographed what mattered, donated most of the rest, and watched the remnants of my old life line the curb. Letting go gave me breathing room for the first time in years. I could imagine what came next.\n\nSelling the house gave me the financial and emotional space to address something I had avoided for years. I needed extensive dental work, and with missing teeth, I no longer felt confident in my own smile. As a photographer, I had spent decades coaxing others to relax while I avoided the lens myself.\n\nI trusted a cosmetic dentist in southern Brazil, the parent of an exchange student I once hosted, and the cost was far more realistic than in the United States. After surgery and the initial healing, I traveled to Rio. For the first time in years, I felt free to focus my lens and smile at the world around me without hesitation.\n\nThe physical and financial weight I had carried for years began to lift. Brazil restored my confidence and reminded me that reinvention was still possible.\n\nBefore selling my house, I had researched ways to travel while working. A friend hosted dinners as a sommelier on cruise ships, and my algorithm kept suggesting photography jobs at sea. I applied to a few with curiosity.\n\nWhile I was still in Rio, the call came. I was offered a contract as the master photographer on a premium luxury cruise line, a role that would take me across multiple continents. To qualify, I needed a Seafarer Certificate, which at my age required extensive medical tests and functional exams. It was humbling, but I passed.\n\nI was notified with less than a week to prepare that my contract would start in Sydney. After a 31-hour flight, knowing I would board within 24 hours, I dropped my bags at the hotel and walked the waterfront from Darling Harbor to the Opera House. A mist hung in the air, turning the city into a soft shimmer through my lens.\n\nLife at sea was a study in contrasts. I photographed in a studio on the 15th floor but slept far below in a windowless cabin. I climbed endless flights of stairs each day. The ancient programs, cameras, and equipment made my days long and tedious. But above deck, the ocean made everything worth it. An unobstructed sunset on open water can shift your entire mood. Each time we reached a new port, the world opened again. My creative mojo began to gel for the first time in a long while, and I realized I was able to absorb so much only because I had let go of so much.\n\nIn six months, I had visited three continents, become healthier than I had been in years, and for the first time in decades, my smile came without hesitation. My financial responsibilities felt lighter, and the spark I had been missing finally came back after years of accumulating belongings and obligations that had kept me anchored when I was ready to sail into another chapter filled with creativity.\n\nWhile recovering in Miami from an injury, I received another unexpected call. An apartment had become available in the Asbury Park building where I had applied years earlier. It had an ocean view, a community of artists and musicians, and a rent I could actually afford. It felt like the universe was giving me the chance to finally act on my hopes and creativity.\n\nI had let go of everything that once held me back. What I gained was freedom, the freedom to create, to travel, and to smile freely again, with my camera as my ticket forward.",

    "fullText": "Private jets are descending on the typically quiet ski town of Davos as the masters of the universe make their way to Switzerland for the World Economic Forum.\n\nBill Gates, Nvidia's Jensen Huang, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, and JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon are among the business leaders scheduled to attend, along with world leaders like French President Emmanuel Macron, Argentina's Javier Milei, and Donald Trump.\n\nIt's unlikely any of these titans will fly commercial.\n\nLast year, private aviation traffic in the region during WEF week was about five times the usual level, with more than 150 jets landing at area airports, according to JetSpy, which tracks FAA-registered aircraft.\n\nThey were registered to billionaires like Michael Dell and Robert Smith, and hailed from Palm Beach and Dubai, Paris, and Doha.\n\nThis weekend, corporate jets owned by Google, BlackRock, and IBM were among those that arrived in the area, according to data from JetSpy.\n\nFew WEF attendees will fly into Engadin Airport, the airport closest to Davos and the highest in Europe by altitude.\n\n\"For many years, the WEF week has actually been one of the quietest weeks of the winter season for us,\" Christian Gorfer, the airport's chief financial officer, told Business Insider in an email.\n\nDue to airspace restrictions within a 25 nautical mile radius of Davos, all flights to and from Engadin require prior authorisation from the Swiss Air Force.\n\n\"Some of our regular customers do fly in and out during that week, but WEF participants generally do not make their way to [Engadin],\" Gorfer said.\n\nInstead, many private jets and government airplanes will arrive at the Zurich Airport alongside regular airlines. It's about a two-hour drive away from the Alpine town, but the wealthiest people will travel by helicopter instead.\n\nThe airport estimated there will be an extra 1,000 takeoffs and landings during the conference, with some landing after its typically strict curfew of 11:30 p.m. Zurich Airport is also extending the opening hours for an observation deck for planespotters and other aviation enthusiasts.\n\nOthers fly into Germany's Friedrichshafen Airport, a Jetspy spokesperson told Business Insider.\n\nThe jets will be a parade of some of the most expensive on the market.\n\nMany opt for the Gulfstream G650, which costs tens of millions and was the transport of choice for attendees like Gates, Louis Bacon, and executives from BlackRock and Goldman Sachs last year. Others fly on the Bombardier Global 7500, which has been dubbed the \"Ferrari of the Skies.\"",

    "fullText": "The Africa Cup of Nations reaches its climax on Sunday with a showdown between host nation Morocco, looking to win the title for the first time in 50 years, and Sadio Mane's powerful Senegal side.\n\nThe final kicks off at 1900 GMT at the Prince Moulay Abdellah Stadium in Rabat, where almost all the 69,000 spectators will be backing Morocco, captained by African player of the year Achraf Hakimi.\n\nThe first AFCON ever to start in one year and end in another could be the second in a row to be won by the host nation, with the Atlas Lions aiming to follow in the footsteps of Ivory Coast, crowned champions on home soil in 2024.\n\nWalid Regragui's Morocco have established themselves in recent years as Africa's pre-eminent national team, becoming the first from the continent to reach a World Cup semi-final, in 2022, and climbing to 11th place in the world rankings.\n\nHowever, they have long been AFCON underachievers, with their only title to date coming in 1976. This will be their first final since 2004, when they lost to Tunisia when Regragui was part of the team.\n\nSenegal, meanwhile, are appearing in their third final in four editions and are targeting a second title to follow their 2022 triumph, when Mane scored the decisive shoot-out penalty against Egypt in Yaounde.\n\n\"We dreamt of being here and now we have done it,\" Regragui told reporters on Saturday.\n\nHe has been under suffocating pressure to deliver the title for the football-mad nation, and would possibly not have kept his job through to the approaching World Cup in North America had he not reached the final.\n\n\"I hope this is just the beginning and not our last AFCON final,\" he added.\n\n\"Big football nations want to be up there on a regular basis. Tomorrow we want to try to make history.\"\n\nHe added: \"Senegal will need to be really strong to beat us at home, although they are capable.\"\n\nMorocco's success over the last four weeks has been based around the attacking threat of Real Madrid winger Brahim Diaz, the tournament's top scorer with five goals, and a defence which has conceded only once.\n\nBeing at home brings extra pressure, but can also be a huge advantage, and Senegal have complained about the conditions in which they were welcomed to Rabat ahead of the game.\n\nThe Lions of Teranga were based in the northern port city of Tangiers until they arrived in Rabat by train on Friday.\n\nThe Senegalese Football Federation complained about a \"lack of adequate security\" for the team's arrival amid a crowd of fans \"which put the players and staff at risk\".\n\nIt also complained about their hotel, the fact that their supporters were given fewer than 3,000 tickets for the final, and about being asked to train at the Moroccan team's base in nearby Sale.\n\n\"What happened was not normal,\" said Senegal coach Pape Thiaw.\n\n\"Given the number there, anything could have happened. My players could have been in danger.\n\n\"That type of thing should not happen between two brother countries.\"\n\nMane, a two-time winner of the African player of the year award, said after netting the winner in the semi-final against Egypt that Sunday's game would be his last ever AFCON appearance.\n\nBut Thiaw insisted on the eve of the game that the former Liverpool forward may have to rethink that decision.\n\n\"I think he made his decision in the heat of the moment and the country does not agree, and I as coach of the national team do not agree,\" said Thiaw.\n\n\"We would like to keep him for as long as possible,\" added the coach, who is without centre-back and captain Kalidou Koulibaly due to suspension.\n\nOff the pitch this edition of Africa's premier sports event has demonstrated that Morocco is determined to be a successful co-host of the 2030 World Cup.\n\nThe tournament has been free of the problems that have plagued earlier AFCONs, the stadiums and pitches have generally been of a high quality and high-speed rail links show a country significantly upgrading its infrastructure.",

    "fullText": "Lindsey Vonn continued her remarkable form in the lead up to the Winter Olympics with her seventh World Cup podium of the season in Sunday's super-G in Tarvisio won by Emma Aicher.\n\nAmerican star Vonn finished 0.27 seconds behind Germany's Aicher to claim second after taking third in Saturday's downhill on the same piste in Italy.\n\nThe American star has re-established herself as a force in the sport at the age of 41 after coming out of retirement with a titanium knee replacement that allows her to ski pain-free.\n\nAnd with less than three weeks to go until the start of the Milan-Cortina Games, the 2010 Olympic downhill champion was again impressive on one of her favourite courses.\n\nVonn has never missed out on the podium in Tarvisio, which made its World Cup comeback this weekend after a 15-year absence and where her tally now reads two wins, five second places and one third spot.\n\n\"It was a good race today, it was tough conditions with the visibility but I'm really happy to be on the podium again,\" Vonn said to Italian broadcaster RAI.\n\n\"Of course I'm close to another win but it is what it is, I think I'll save the hundredths (of seconds) for Cortina!\"\n\nVonn, who has a commanding lead in the downhill standings, is now 10 points behind new super-G leader Sofia Goggia after the Italian speed specialist finished sixth.\n\nGoggia had another disappointing run and finished 1.13sec behind Germany's Aicher, who held off Vonn and Ester Ledecka to claim her fourth career World Cup win and second of the season.\n\nBut the 33-year-old was helped by previous super-G leader, New Zealand's Alice Robinson, losing control after the final jump and crashing over the finish line.\n\nA shocked Robinson was seen on the verge of tears after her accident, which left her nearly three seconds off the pace and 20 points behind Goggia.\n\nGoggia is one of Italy's alpine skiing medal hopes at the Olympics with uncertainty over the participation of overall World Cup title holder Federica Brignone, who is also giant slalom world champion.\n\nBrignone has not competed since suffering a double leg break in April and could well arrive at the starting gate for the Olympics without having raced a single event this winter.\n\nShe could also forgo the final Italian stage before the Games, in Kronplatz, where a giant slalom is scheduled for Tuesday.",

    "fullText": "UK gas prices don't form in isolation - they're the result of a global system where LNG tankers move molecules across oceans, storage facilities buffer seasonal demand swings, and physical constraints create friction that simple supply-demand models miss.\n\nThis guide explains the infrastructure and economics that connect US shale production to UK power plants. You'll learn how LNG shipping works, why UK gas prices track Henry Hub (Louisiana) with a 6-8 week lag, and how traders calculate netback prices to decide whether exporting US gas to Europe is profitable. You'll see why LNG is the flexible marginal source while Norwegian pipelines provide inflexible baseload, and how charter rate volatility (which spiked 5x in 2025) can turn a profitable cargo into a loss overnight.\n\nThe guide also covers the UK's structural vulnerability: storage capacity below 2% of annual demand (versus 20% in continental Europe). You'll understand why this makes UK prices volatile, how storage arbitrage works (and why most seasonal spreads don't cover storage costs), and why NBP can decouple from TTF despite physical interconnection - a basis risk that's burned countless traders who assumed prices would converge.\n\nYou'll work through real calculations: shipping costs for Atlantic crossings, netback comparisons between European and Asian markets, and storage break-even analysis using German salt caverns. By the end, you'll see how global gas dynamics feed directly into the spark spread formulas you'll learn next.\n\nPhysical Foundations taught you why gas plants set marginal power prices. This guide shows you where gas prices come from - the global infrastructure that determines the fuel input cost. Next, you'll learn spark spreads (power minus gas minus carbon), which combine gas prices with power and carbon markets to identify profitable generation opportunities.\n\nComplete the Physical Foundations guide first. You need to understand merit order dispatch and why gas-fired plants are marginal price-setters. No prior trading experience required.\n\nTrack Henry Hub and NBP prices online or on TradingView for a month. When Henry Hub makes a significant move, set a calendar reminder for 6-8 weeks and check whether NBP followed. The lag will become intuitive, not theoretical.\n\nGet the complete guide in PDF format for offline reading and reference.",

    "fullText": "If you follow me, you might already know Tech Workers Coalition (TWC). For everybody else, TWC is an international organization that supports union and political organizing of workers within the tech sector. It's heavily decentralized and has chapters spread throughout North America and Europe. It includes every kind of profession in the field: developers, content moderators, designers, testers, sysadmins, data workers, customer service, and so on.\n\nThe organization, over the years, tried different paths to communicate to the outside what it does, why it does what it does, and what it would like to do in the future. The most recent iteration is probably this Identity Document, which gets regularly printed into flyers and handed to newcomers during onboarding sessions.\n\nThe challenge comes from different factors:\n\nI've been part of TWC for 7 years now. I helped start the Berlin chapter, then the Italian chapter, and in the last two years, the Global chapter. I've talked with hundreds of people participating in the communities, coached many chapter organizers, given workshops and onboarding sessions, and facilitated hundreds of meetings within TWC. It is now an integral part of my present and my past.\n\nIn this article, I want to give my take on why I do this, why I think it's important, and why some of you might want to join us. Because, ultimately, it is not so obvious and linear why somebody should be contributing their time to TWC rather than, for example, a union.\n\nLet me preface by saying that I strongly believe that any healthy political ecosystem is composed of organizations aware of their own role. Constructive relationships are also built by behaving in a way that fosters the success of your peers and the health of the whole ecology, rather than by exclusively pursuing the success of your own ideas, your own model, and your own issues. In the context of political participation and activation, this often translates into growing the organization with just the right people, rather than growing indefinitely. Trying to incorporate everybody and preventing them from joining organizations with slightly different values or goals turns political engagement into a zero-sum game. That means that we often invite workers NOT to join TWC if it's not the right thing for them, and rather do direct workplace organizing, join a union, or a party.\n\nThis article, then, while advocating for the merit and worth of participating in TWC, should be seen primarily as a useful tool to decide if you might be a good fit for TWC or if you should rather join a different space.\n\nSo, why Tech Workers Coalition? Why should you join? And how would your effort translate into impact?\n\nOne of the most recognized contributions of TWC has always been its ability to complement unions at the local level. Often stuck in a Fordist mindset, unions struggle to grasp the implications of cognitive labor and its specificities, worsening the gap of language, culture, and aesthetics between unions and office workers in the tech sector.\n\nThis doesn't happen magically: TWC organizers create offline and online community spaces, conferences, and events for green and experienced tech organizers to connect. They develop relationships with unions and link them to workplaces that are interested in organizing. They translate in both directions and facilitate interactions. They offer educational activities specific to labor organizing in the tech sector that unions overlook.\n\nUnions are often big organizations, slow to adapt and transform. Cognitive work poses deep challenges that are still unsolved at a global strategic level. TWC allows tech unions to still develop and thrive on the ground by filling the gaps in the areas traditional unions cannot yet see.\n\nThe more we go on, the more we realize how the tech elites, especially in the USA, are openly supporting a return to Fascism and other forms of oppression. They are reshaping the global economy to entrench themselves in the productive processes and state machinery. They imprint their values and beliefs on the psychic landscape of the ever-increasingly alienated modern and post-modern worlds.\n\nMany are fighting the tech oligarchs from without: hackers and FOSS communities, environmental activists, NGOs, and sometimes even governments. The truth is, though, that the real leverage is between the office chair and the keyboard. We could talk extensively about economics, infrastructure, power analysis, and even draw historical comparisons with the organizing of early factory workers, when only a few, like Marx, were advocating for focusing on them rather than organizing farmers, like most socialists were doing. It would be a long and boring analysis. Suffice to say that there's a lot of power in the tech industry, and that's a lot of power that could be contested and won by tech workers. We are uniquely positioned to bind such power enough to, at the very least, limit the harm the tech industry is doing to the rest of the world or, in the best scenario, reshape how and why technology is produced.\n\nWhat if you believe this, but you don't work in tech? Well, join TWC anyway. Workplace organizing is not possible for everybody: geography, workplace conditions, or, as I said, a different career path might prevent you from doing “the Thing”. TWC is a space where you can help others do “the Thing”. It's meta-organizing, baby. For some, it is frustrating: they want to be directly involved, they want the tension of a high-stakes union election, or the thrill and risk of a direct action during a protest. For others, it is cozy and reassuring: you help a hundred plants grow, and some of them for sure will bear fruit.\n\nThe tech labor movement is, worldwide, a relatively young phenomenon. In some countries, it's unheard of. In some others, it is growing and exploring what's possible. While we are beginning to understand what works and what doesn't, nobody really has found a magic formula that solves it all. Contrary to other forms of labor organizing, where ideas decades old are crystallized and organizations struggle to keep up with social and political changes, in the tech sector there's a lot of experimentation going on.\n\nOn one side it is stressful for many: some workers just want to improve their workplace and would like to have a cookiecutter strategy to apply. On the other side, for the more creative and ambitious, there's a lot of room to try new approaches. For example, we are still not set on what a strike in tech looks like. Some workers just stop working. Some employ traditional forms like picketing or marching instead of going to the office. Some others do more fun and creative stuff to keep busy and attract attention: live streaming, union-themed game jams and hackathons, and so on and so forth.\n\nTWC acts as a network throuch which these ideas travel. Traditional media or social media don't always cover these topics, especially outside the USA. Established networks of unions often talk high-level strategy and rarely go into such level of detail. TWC instead often sees meetings with tech workers from all over, sharing their stories and circulating know-how they didn't know they had. In a way, being in TWC feels like the early internet: tech labor is fragmented and disconnected across national boundaries, and absent from traditional media. TWC acts as a network for the first time, allowing tech workers to discover that in Czechia, India, or the Philippines, there are people like them, with similar issues, but maybe completely different approaches, ideas, and aesthetics.\n\nAs we said, the fight against Big Tech takes many shapes. TWC doesn't collaborate only with labor organizations, but, especially at a local level, acts as an aggregator for people working professionally on the political side of technology: researchers, investigators, artists, occultists, cooperative entrepreneurs, sometimes even party politicians.\n\nThis means that many members of TWC get involved in a lot of different and interesting initiatives happening at the fringes of our network: experimental commoning of technology, litigations, hackatons, policy-making, campaigns, performances, exhibitions, and so on.\n\nIn many places, especially smaller cities, TWC becomes a beacon for anybody working with radical technology but dissatisfied with the more traditional aggregation around hackerspaces or technical communities.\n\nFor some of us, this turned into a whole new career. Workplace organizing is fundamental, but after you're done, after you have your union in place, the company will probably still be working on how to feed the souls of innocent babies into a spirit-grinding, high-performance, demonic contraption. It takes a long time before the union is strong enough to push the company away from the business of butchering baby souls and towards more useful endeavors.\n\nThere are many cases of members that, after several years of TWC, decide to abandon their career in the tech startup or corporate world and go do something different. Some get employed by unions. Some start their own cooperative with their friends. Others join TWC meetings after waking up early to work on a farm. Some go teach in a movement school or join an NGO. Personally, participating in TWC allowed me to connect with people who eventually got me involved into AI Forensics first, and Reversing.works later. The full story here.\n\nI hope this article gave a compelling overview of what I helped build through a whole fifth of my life and I will keep building going forward. A journey that thought me agency, compassion, patience, dedication, and especially the ecstactic joy of seeing the world and the life of people around you change and get better over time.\n\nIf you're tired of arguing on the internet, if you think there's nothing to be done to form a union at work, if you're forced to “monitor the situation”, join TWC.",

    "fullText": "Experts warn use of VPNs makes it hard to limit access to technology that can create nonconsensual explicit images\n\nDays after Malaysia made global headlines by announcing it would temporarily ban Grok over its ability to generate “grossly offensive and nonconsensual manipulated images”, the generative AI tool was conversing breezily with accounts registered in the country.\n\n“Still here! That DNS block in Malaysia is pretty lightweight – easy to bypass with a VPN or DNS tweak,” Grok’s account on X said in response to a question from a user.\n\nGrok’s ability to allow users to create sexually explicit images, including images of children, has created a global outcry over recent weeks, with regulators and politicians around the world launching investigations. Indonesia and Malaysia became the first two countries to announce blocks on the technology, with Malaysia’s regulatory body saying last Sunday it had “directed a temporary restriction” on access to Grok, effective as of 11 January 2026. Officials in the Philippines have said they too plan to ban the technology.\n\nBlocking access to Grok is not straightforward, however. The technology not only exists across multiple platforms, including a standalone app and website, but is also integrated across X, which, along with Grok, is owned by Elon Musk’s xAI.\n\nOver the past week, X users, and even Grok itself, have advised people on how to bypass restrictions. This includes using a VPN – many of which are available for free – or changing domain name system (DNS), the protocol on the internet that turns address names into IP addresses that load websites.\n\nWhen the Guardian tried to use Grok in Indonesia, its website was working even without a VPN, though the Grok app did not work. Grok was also still responding to Indonesian accounts on X, where it functions as an integrated chatbot. X has not been subject to a ban.\n\nEven if governments could completely restrict Grok, though, this is not a real solution, said Nana Nwachukwu, an AI governance expert and PhD researcher at Trinity College Dublin.\n\n“Blocking Grok is like slapping a Band-Aid on a weeping wound that you haven’t cleaned,” she said. “You block Grok, and then you go around shouting you’ve done something. Meanwhile, people can use VPNs to access the same platforms.” Or, they could simply turn to one of the many other platforms that offer the same functions, including “smaller, general purpose AI systems that are largely unknown”, Nwachukwu added.\n\nGovernments should instead focus on law enforcement and investigating individuals who use such tools to break the law, she added. “Platforms are required by law to provide information to law enforcement when a crime has been committed,” Nwachukwu said. “If we see people being arrested, people being tried in courts, people being jailed for these offences, that’s a sign that this is a real crime.”\n\nX should build accountability into its platform – and clean itself up, said Nwachukwu: “All of those offending images should be removed from the platform.”\n\nOn Wednesday, X announced additional safeguards in response to continued public anger, saying it would stop the @Grok account on X from “allowing the editing of images of real people in revealing clothing such as bikinis”, including paid subscribers. However, the Guardian found that it was possible to get around such restrictions by using the standalone version of Grok, easily accessible through a web browser, to create short videos in which clothes are removed from images of real women.\n\nThis could then be posted to X’s public platform, where it could be viewed by users around the world within seconds.\n\nMusk’s company also said that, in jurisdictions where such content is illegal, it will geoblock the ability of all users in those locations to generate images of real people in bikinis, or similar attire, in Grok on X, adding that “xAI is implementing similar geoblocking measures for the Grok app”.\n\nExperts warn users may still be able to get around such “geoblocks” through a VPN. It is also not clear in which countries such restrictions will be implemented.\n\nIn Malaysia, the communications minister, Fahmi Fadzil, has said restrictions on Grok would only be lifted once the ability to produce harmful content had been disabled, according to local media reports.\n\nDr Nuurrianti Jalli, a visiting fellow at the media, technology and society programme at ISEAS – Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore, said the threat of blocking Grok could be a useful way to apply pressure to companies to respond quickly, adding that it “shifts the debate from ‘individual bad actors’ to questions of platform responsibility, safety by design, and accountability when safeguards fail”. It could also “slow the spread of abuse, reduce casual misuse and create a clear boundary around what authorities consider unacceptable”, she said.\n\nIn Indonesia, Grok has been used to create nonconsensual sexualised images of singers and celebrities, including one of the country’s most popular girl groups, JKT48, while in Malaysia, women report similar abuses, including cases where the tool has been used to remove their hijabs, according to Malaysian media.\n\nSome women resorted to publicly telling Grok on X that they do not authorise it to “crawl, take, process or edit” any of their photos.\n\nJalli said governments should push for greater transparency “about how safety measures are implemented, how abuse reports are handled and what enforcement steps are taken when harmful content is generated or circulated”.\n\nThe Malaysian communications and multimedia commission and the ministry of communications did not respond to a request for comment. Indonesia’s ministry of communication and digital affairs also did not respond.\n\nNwachukwu said safeguards should be built into the AI system, rather than “gates” built around it. “Both the [geographic] restriction from X, [and] the restriction from the government is gated access, and gates can be broken down,” she said.\n\nAdditional reporting from Hidayatullah",

    "fullText": "Big tech treats our attention like a resource to be mercilessly extracted. The fightback begins here\n\nIn the last 15 years, a linked series of unprecedented technologies have changed the experience of personhood across most of the world. It is estimated that nearly 70% of the human population of the Earth currently possesses a smartphone, and these devices constitute about 95% of internet access-points on the planet. Globally, on average, people seem to spend close to half their waking hours looking at screens, and among young people in the rich world the number is a good deal higher than that.\n\nHistory teaches that new technologies always make possible new forms of exploitation, and this basic fact has been spectacularly exemplified by the rise of society-scale digital platforms. It has been driven by a remarkable new way of extracting money from human beings: call it “human fracking”. Just as petroleum frackers pump high-pressure, high-volume detergents into the ground to force a little monetisable black gold to the surface, human frackers pump high-pressure, high-volume detergent into our faces (in the form of endless streams of addictive slop and maximally disruptive user-generated content), to force a slurry of human attention to the surface, where they can collect it, and take it to market.\n\nFracking (of the Earth and of our minds) produces tectonic instability, toxicity and the despoliation of our landscapes, natural and social. We now know that the heedless exploitation of our external environment has been so relentless and irresponsible that human survival on Earth has been placed in actual jeopardy. The new “gold rush” into the inner environment of the human psyche is well on its way to effecting parallel, if even more insidious destruction.\n\nThe stakes are existential. And that is because, rightly understood, our actual human “attention” – the thing the frackers want, in the form of our eyes on their screens – is nothing less than our ability to care, our ability to think, our ability to give our minds, time and senses to ourselves, the world and each other. To commodify that is to commodify our very beings. The problem isn’t “phones”, and it isn’t “social media”. The problem is human fracking, a world-spanning land-grab into human consciousness – which big tech is treating as a vast, unclaimed territory, ripe for sacking and empire.\n\nThat’s the bad news. The good news is that novel forms of exploitation produce novel forms of resistance. What fills the coffers of the six largest corporations on the planet is nothing other than the stuff of our humanity. Which is to say this new fight for our attention stands in a long line of clashes between those who are willing to reduce people (their labour, their eyeballs) to cash value and those who insist on a higher view of human flourishing. This history is long and complex, and often painful. But it tells us this much: we can fight back. Indeed, we must.\n\nSo what is to be done about this new kind of human exploitation that is harming us – harming children and adults, compromising our deliberative politics and our psychological wellbeing? Regulatory efforts are piecemeal and actively thwarted by the powerful interests in play. Psychopharmacological fixes for the ever-expanding damage merely monetise the destruction in a complementary way and render us better able to submit to conditions that are palpably at odds with human flourishing. How to confront a problem that is both unspeakably intimate and unthinkably extensive?\n\nThe answer is clear: we, the actual people of this planet, must come together in decisive solidarity; we must say no to the human frackers, and do so by insisting, in new ways, that human attention is human, and it is ours, and we will use it to make the worlds in which we want to live. In other words, we need a movement.\n\nThink that sounds quixotic? Well, keep in mind that’s how actual change actually happens. And it can happen fast. The environmental movement as we know it did not exist in 1950, but by 1970 it was a global force. In 1946 Reynolds Tobacco was using doctors to promote cigarettes. Fewer than 20 years later, the American Medical Association and the US surgeon general publicly averred that smoking caused lung cancer.\n\nAnd the changes get much bigger than that. Precious few do-gooders devoted themselves to environmental politics in 1925. That’s because “environmental politics” wasn’t even a thing. It took a cultural shift (and the work of advocates such as Rachel Carson) across the mid-20th century to establish the physical environment – the unity of land, water, and air that produces shared life – as a politically tractable object around which diverse groups could organise. This is to say that the very structures of politics, not just our beliefs and hopes, are themselves emergent forms. New things come into being, and old things pass away.\n\nWhere attention is concerned, there are mounting signs that we are reaching an inflection point. People of all sorts, Maga Republicans and Mamdani progressives, hipsters in Portland and evangelicals in Arkansas – people who don’t agree about anything – all actually do agree that something is totally wrong with a world in which everyone spends nearly all their time scrolling endlessly through the algorithmic feeds of their social media, a world where military-grade technology and trillion-dollar corporations take aim at children, and feed them whatever it takes to keep them hooked.\n\nYou can only abuse people so much, and then, eventually, they turn, they rise, they insist on something else. Already politicians on the right and the left are identifying this issue as one that moves the electorate. In 30 years, we will look back, and this era – the wild west of the tech princes’ smash-and-grab into our hearts, souls and relationships – will be difficult to explain to our grandkids. “How did you all let that happen?” they will ask. And we’ll have to say: “It’s hard to explain: it happened before we noticed; it was so much fun, especially at first; it took us time to figure out what was going on … ”\n\nBut we are figuring it out. We write as representatives of a fast-growing and increasingly well-organised movement, focused on pushing back against the human frackers, and giving shape to a new politics of human attention. At the heart of our efforts? The formation of broad coalitions devoted to the politics of human attention, the practice of diverse forms of study that call forth the life-giving powers of the mind and senses, and the promotion of sanctuary spaces for the protection and cultivation of the kinds of attention that make life good. We call this work attention activism.\n\nOur claim? That all of us already have the tools to resist the frackers, because all of us already have things we do and care about that put us beyond the reach of the algorithms. We all already know the deepest truth: that true human attention isn’t the click and swipe of screen time. True human attention is love, curiosity, daydreaming and taking care of ourselves and others.\n\nYes, new technologies give rise to new kinds of exploitation and resistance. But new forms of exploitation can even give rise to genuinely new forms of politics. You couldn’t brutalise an industrial proletariat before the factory system. Steam engines set the conditions of possibility for this development. They weren’t themselves a “problem”, of course; they gleamed and were precise and powerful. Who could see them operate without awe? But they also created a world in which it was possible to aggregate and extract physical labour from human beings in a revolutionary way. Along the way, they created a new kind of political subject, Homo economicus, a person who had been reduced, in the calculus of modernity, to “labuor value”. Actual revolutions followed – and a new kind of politics was born which reflected a new world of industrial labour, and new forms of labour solidarity, such as unions and workers’ parties.\n\nThe new system of human fracking is turning all of us into attentional subjects in a powerful new way. Homo attentus is the end user of every networked system – economic, political, expressive. With this new form of life comes, as we have discovered, appalling new vulnerability. But we are on the brink of understanding the new power that has come into our hands in the fracklands. We believe a new kind of politics beckons. What will it look like? It is hard to say. And there are reasons to be fearful. But if we, the people, can take up the banner of a new kind of freedom movement – a movement for the true freedom of attention itself, what we call attensity – and deploy our truly human attention in new ways, with a new understanding of the stakes, we can defy the frackers, and insist on creating, together, a human world.\n\nD Graham Burnett is professor of history at Princeton University.

    "fullText": "SYDNEY, N.S. — American forward Emily Pohl and blueliner Margaret Averill notched two goals and added two assists apiece to help lead the United States handily take the Swedes out of gold medal contention with a 9-1 win Saturday evening at the 2026 IIHF Under-18 Women's World Championship at Centre 200.\n\nForward Jane Daley was one of five other players to put one on the scoreboard for the U.S., making her record-setting 12th goal of this year's tournament, according to the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF). She leads all players with 17 points total.\n\nAverill and Pohl opened it up in the first to make it 2-0 going into the first intermission, forwards Jillian McLaughlin and Daley added a couple \n\nThree of those first seven goals were scored on American powerplays, including one on a five-on-three in the second, which included a two-minute interference from defender Ebba Westerlind and a five-minute spearing penalty, that came with a game misconduct, from forward Moa Stridh, served by fourth-liner Greta Johansson, which certainly didn't help the Swedish squad with the game off the ice — and perhaps their mentality on the ice.\n\nThat being said, there were plenty of Swedish fans in the stands in the Cape Breton arena, wearing team jerseys, holding up brightly coloured signs, and cheering them on throughout, but the whoops and hollers were perhaps no louder than when Tilde Grillfors snuck one past American goalkeeper Bianca Birrittieri on a powerplay just over three minutes into the final frame, narrowing the gap to 7-1 for the U.S.\n\nDespite the Swedish support in the crowd, and the goalie change from starter Meja Engelin to Thea Holmberg going into the third period, there just wasn't enough time for the yellow and blue squad to catch up to the visibly stronger American team.\n\nCentre Talla Hansen scored on an Averill assist and winger Lindsay Stephnowski capped it off with help from Pohl to seal the 9-1 deal and earn a berth to Sunday's gold medal game for the United States.\n\nBirrittieri didn't earn the shutout but made a solid 17 stops for the U.S., while Engelin made a respectable 25 saves on 32 shots against. Holmberg saved seven of nine shots in her third-period appearance in the crease.\n\n\"This sucks,\" Swedish captain Ebba Westerlind told reporters matter-of-factly after the tough semifinal loss.\"We compete every time,\" she said, adding, \"the U.S.A. is really good, so we try to do our best.\"\n\n\"I think we did some good things... (but) I felt like they were first on the pucks, especially in the first period,\" she said, but pointed out \"we did better throughout the game.\"\n\nNow that Sweden is moving on from semis, it's time for \"eat, sleep, rest,\" Westerlind said of focusing on what's coming next for her country at U18 women's worlds — a chance to go home with bronze medals around their necks. \"We know we have to do the best we can... and focus on the win.\"\n\nSweden will play for bronze bragging rights earlier Sunday at Centre 200. The Swedes last won a silver medal at the 2023 IIHF Under-18 Women's World Championship, which they hosted in their home country in the northern community Ostersund.\n\nAs for the Americans, four-point contributor Pohl said, \"we don't take any of our opponents lightly.\n\n\"We knew it was going to be a good game, but I think all of us are us are prepared,\" the Woodbury, Minn., native said.\n\n\"Our coaches and teammates do a great job preparing all of us. So, (we) just (to) have fun and smile out there, and play our game that we know how to play.\"\n\nUnited States head coach Courtney Kennedy said her team was \"enjoying the moment\" of the semifinal celebration before turning thoughts to tomorrow's battle for the world championship title.\n\n\"It was a lot of work to get here,\" she said. \"I'm very proud of the players, and I'm proud of the way they played through all three periods of every single game, and it's uphill from here.\n\n\"Whoever wins this next game, we're going to have to prepare and get back to the drawing board about what we need to be successful, and both teams that we could end up playing, they're both fantastic, they're well-coached, and (Sunday) will be a hard, hard game.\"\n\n\"Tomorrow's another day,\" Kennedy said.\n\nEarlier Saturday, Finland beat Slovakia 7-1 in a relegation game, marking the first time the normally top-ranked women's hockey country, which means they'll be moving down a division in the IIHF under-18 international pool.\n\nThe large scoring gaps at this U18 worlds isn't what many fans, or serious women's hoockey watchers, want to see, as international development should be helping close these gaps to ensure competition continues to improve and the game continues to grow worldwide.\n\nSweden faces off in the bronze medal game at 3:30 p.m. AT, while the United States goes for gold at 7:30 p.m. AT.",

    "title": "Trump 25% tariff on European allies until Denmark sells Greenland to US",
    "description": "Heads of state across Europe respond in solidarity with Denmark and Greenland, and boycott of World Cup suggested",
    "fullText": "Heads of state across Europe respond in solidarity with Denmark and Greenland, and boycott of World Cup suggested\n\nDonald Trump threatened a 25% tariff on a slew of European countries including Denmark, Germany, France and the UK – until the US is allowed to purchase Greenland, in an extraordinary escalation of the president’s bid to claim the autonomous Danish territory.\n\nIn a lengthy post on Saturday on Truth Social, Trump said he would impose a 10% tariff on Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Finland beginning 1 February, “on any and all goods sent to the United States of America”.\n\nHe said the tariff will increase to 25% on 1 June.\n\n“This Tariff will be due and payable until such time as a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland,” Trump said.\n\nThe president’s longstanding interest in acquiring Greenland “one way or the other” has become a fixation since the US raid that captured Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro earlier in January. While he has claimed the Arctic territory’s current status poses a national security threat to the US, this has been disputed by US allies, including Denmark.\n\nIn the Saturday morning post, Trump said forces from the eight European nations “have journeyed to Greenland, for purposes unknown”. It was an apparent reference to Nato allies deploying troops in Greenland on Thursday in response to Trump’s threats to forcefully take the Arctic island, which is an autonomous territory of Denmark.\n\n“The President’s statement comes as a surprise,” Lars Løkke Rasmussen, Denmark’s foreign minister, responded on social media. “Earlier this week, we had a constructive meeting with Vice President Vance and Secretary Rubio. The purpose of the increased military presence in Greenland, to which the President refers, is to enhance security in the Arctic.”\n\n“Every insult, threat, tariff and lie that we receive strengthens our resolve,” Rasmus Jarlov, the conservative chair of Denmark’s defence committee, wrote in more direct language. “The answer from Denmark and Greenland is final: We will never hand over Greenland. We pray that our true allies will stand with us because we are going to need it.”\n\nThe tariff threat against Nato allies united the leaders of those nations in unusually blunt language, after months of treading carefully for fear of triggering the volatile US president’s rage.\n\nIn response to Trump’s comments on Saturday, the EU commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said in a statement that the Europeans “have consistently underlined our shared transatlantic interest in peace and security in the Arctic, including through NATO. The pre-coordinated Danish exercise, conducted with allies, responds to the need to strengthen Arctic security and poses no threat to anyone.”\n\n“The EU stands in full solidarity with Denmark and the people of Greenland,” she added. “Tariffs would undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral.”\n\n“Our position on Greenland is very clear – it is part of the Kingdom of Denmark and its future is a matter for the Greenlanders and the Danes,” the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, said. “Applying tariffs on allies for pursuing the collective security of Nato allies is completely wrong. We will of course be pursuing this directly with the US administration.”\n\nEmmanuel Macron, the French president, drew an implicit comparison between Trump’s threats to seize Greenland and Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. “No intimidation or threat will influence us – neither in Ukraine, nor in Greenland, nor anywhere else in the world when we are confronted with such situations,” Macron wrote in a social media riposte to Trump.\n\nFinland’s president, Alexander Stubb, whose excellence at golf previously made him something of a Trump whisperer, echoed the warning about a potential “downward spiral”.\n\n“We will not let ourselves be blackmailed,” the Swedish prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, added. That sentiment was echoed by Norway’s prime minister, Jonas Gahr Støre, who wrote: “Threats have no place among allies.”\n\nGermany’s leadership was more reserved, with the German chancellor Friedrich Merz leaving it to his spokesperson, Stefan Kornelius, to say only that the government “has taken note of” Trump’s statements and plans to coordinate with allies to “decide on appropriate responses at the appropriate time”.\n\nOn Friday, however, a spokesperson on foreign policy for the chancellor’s Christian Democrat party, Jürgen Hardt, suggested that Germany could threaten to boycott the World Cup Trump is hosting this summer “as a last resort in order to get Trump to see sense on the Greenland issue”. Polling done before Trump’s latest threat for the popular German tabloid Bild revealed broad support for a World Cup boycott, with 47% of Germans in favor and just 35% against, should the US annex Greenland.\n\nEven before the new tariff threat, there were mass protests in Greenland and Denmark on Saturday against Trump’s efforts to “acquire” the island.\n\nHis latest tariff threat comes just eight months after Trump announced that he had struck a trade pact with the UK – and six months after he announced a pact with the European Union.\n\nThe UK would have protection against future US tariffs “because I like them”, Trump declared in the summer. He described the pact with the EU as a “powerful deal” and an “important” partnership.\n\nTrump’s sudden reversal on Saturday even managed to alienate one of his biggest fans, Nigel Farage, the leader of the rightwing, anti-immigrant party Reform UK. “We don’t always agree with the US government and in this case we certainly don’t. These tariffs will hurt us,” Farage wrote.\n\nThere was also criticism from Trump’s own Republican party. Thom Tillis, a US senator from North Carolina, called the president’s threat “bad for America” but “great for Putin, Xi and other adversaries who want to see Nato divided”.\n\n“The fact that a small handful of ‘advisers’ are actively pushing for coercive action to seize territory of an ally is beyond stupid,” Tillis added.\n\nThe president has repeatedly turned to tariffs in a bid to force countries to bend to his will – with some success. Days after returning to office for his second term in early 2025, Colombia agreed to accept military aircraft carrying deported migrants after Trump threatened steep duties on the country’s exports to the US.\n\nTrump, who has previously extolled the benefits of tariffs as a negotiating tool, stressed on Saturday that the US was “immediately open to negotiation” with Denmark and any of the countries it was threatening to hit with these new tariffs.\n\nHis aggressive global trade strategy has raised fears for the US economy, which analysts and policymakers have warned could face significant damage from sweeping tariffs on the world.\n\nWhile the White House has played down such concerns, a vast wave of tariffs unveiled by Trump last spring – when he proclaimed the start of a new era for the US economy – was quickly reversed as global markets fell sharply.\n\nBut his administration’s erratic rollout of other tariffs nevertheless significantly strained US trade ties with the world. Americans now face an overall average effective tariff rate of 16.8%, according to the Budget Lab at Yale, the highest level since 1935.\n\nThe Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, said recently that Greenland’s defence is a “common concern” for the whole of Nato. The Guardian reported that European troops had deployed to Greenland, in part, to establish what a more sustained ground deployment on the territory could look like, and partly to reassure the US that European Nato members were serious about Arctic security.\n\nFewer than one in five of Americans approve of Trump’s efforts to acquire Greenland, a poll published on Thursday by Reuters/Ipsos found. Both Democrats and Republicans oppose the effort, and only 4% of Americans think the US should take Greenland using military force.\n\nMuch of Trump’s wider trade strategy is currently in the hands of the US supreme court, which is mulling whether the imposition of many of his tariffs was legal. A decision could be announced as early as next week.",

    "description": "Visits to the US by international travelers declined for the eighth straight month in December, in a continued blow to the tourism industry.",
    "fullText": "The US isn't the tourist destination it once was.\n\nVisits to the US by international travelers declined for the eighth straight month in December, according to data released earlier this month by the National Travel and Tourism Office.\n\nIn 2025, visits to the US were down among 10 of the top 20 overseas tourist-generating countries, including India, Germany, and South Korea.\n\nThe decline is a sustained blow to the travel and tourism industries, which in 2024 supported more than 15 million jobs, and generated about $1.3 trillion in economic output — including $181 billion from inbound international travel.\n\nMajor tourism hubs like Las Vegas are seeing widespread layoffs due to the downturn, forcing workers to get creative with their career pivots. Business Insider reported earlier this month that laid-off hospitality workers contributed to a 55% increase in dancer auditions at a Las Vegas strip club compared to the prior six months.\n\nIt doesn't appear the travel bug has gone anywhere — just that international tourists are avoiding the US.\n\nIn Australia, for example, overseas arrivals and departures data released Friday by the country's Bureau of Statistics shows that international travel returned to pre-pandemic levels just before the lockdowns began in 2020. Australians travelling to Canada rose 4% in the last year, 10% more visited India, and visits by Australians to China and Japan rose 20% and 21%, respectively, but 3.2% fewer booked a trip to the US.\n\nFewer Canadian travelers are visiting the US, as well, opting instead to go further south to Mexico, Business Insider reported last April.\n\nComplicating demand were ongoing trade frictions, tariff battles, and geopolitical unease, which helped fuel grass-roots boycotts of US goods and, in some cases, changes in travel plans.\n\nEuropean travel firms and analysts pointed to tariff-driven consumer backlash and growing anti-American sentiment as factors that contributed to early-year softness in bookings, even as demand showed signs of rebounding later in the summer.\n\nDomestic travel has helped cushion the blow so far, with the US Travel Association projecting that domestic leisure travel was forecast to grow 1.9% to $895 billion in 2025.\n\nHowever, if international visitors continue to stay away, destinations that depend on overseas spending — from iconic tourism cities to national parks — could feel growing pressure as the US heads into a high-stakes stretch of global events in 2026 and beyond.",
