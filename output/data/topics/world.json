    "description": "My husband and I wanted to show our kids as much of the country and the world as possible. Now, they're resilient, confident, and independent adults.",
    "fullText": "Before having kids, my husband and I were avid travelers, and we knew we didn't want to stop after our son was born.\n\nFrom Rhode Island to Mexico, we believed in the motto, \"Have kids, will travel.\" The same was true after the arrival of our daughter.\n\nWe decided to show them as much of the country and the world as we could … while working around school schedules.\n\nOur first cross-country flight with our son was to visit family in Boston when he was six weeks old. He slept the whole time, which made up for the trips to come.\n\nWhen he was a year old, we struggled through turbulence and motion sickness as a family while on a warm plane ride to visit family in North Carolina. And when he was 2, he cried all the way home on a flight from Boston to Vancouver, Washington, because he was teething and I forgot to bring medicine.\n\nI learned my lesson on that trip and knew to be as prepared as a Boy Scout on long trips with both of my kids years later, equipped with medicine, extra clothes, and things to keep them occupied.\n\nStill, travel snafus are a given, even as they've gotten older. From mad dashes through Boston Logan International Airport to multiple-hour delays in Georgia and missed connections in Dallas, we've done our best to teach patience when traveling.\n\nAnd it's paid off. Over the last 21 years, my kids have been to five countries and 20 states. From artwork and architecture in Portugal and Mexico to historical artifacts and monuments across the US, our travels have enabled our kids to develop a global perspective that connects them with different cultures and diverse populations.\n\nDoing so has allowed them to step out of their comfort zones, interact with different people, and embrace new experiences. The most interesting thing as a mom was watching them try new foods, from lobster in New England to pastéis de nata in Portugal.\n\nMy son now works as a chef in Arizona, 1,000 miles away from our home in Washington, and he's traveled independently to Hawaii and Canada.\n\nMeanwhile, our daughter has just finished her first semester of college in Los Angeles, another destination 1,000 miles away from home. As she studies for a career in scenic design (that we expect will take her all over the world), we know her travel experiences have prepared her for what is to come.\n\nIf there's any advice I could give to new parents, it would be that experiences matter more than possessions. So, take trips, do things, and don't be afraid that your kids are too young or too fragile.\n\nChildren are resilient and can learn to be adaptable, especially when they're young. Sure, there are cranky, hangry moments — heck, I still get cranky and hangry when I travel long distances — but each adventure has provided bonding opportunities, educational moments, and the beauty of seeing parts of the world like no other.\n\nAnd above all, we did it together. When their dad and I are no longer around, I'm confident they'll say to each other, \"Remember that time?\" and that will make it all worth it.",

    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nThe first Iron Beam laser defense system was deployed by Israel on Sunday. This 100kW laser weapon thus became the world’s first high-power drone defense zapper to be operationally deployed. Iron Beam lasers will fortify Israel’s multi-layered defense, complementing the existing Iron Dome, David’s Sling, and Arrow system architecture.\n\nThe Iron Beam is a short-range line-of-sight laser interceptor that is extremely cheap to run and, therefore, perfectly suited for intercepting low-cost, high-volume threats. According to the official Israeli announcement, Iron Beam systems have “successfully intercepted rockets, mortars, and UAVs.”\n\nA complex mix of government, military, scientific, and commercial interests were responsible for the research and development of the Iron Beam laser system. Central to the Iron Beam are “an advanced laser source and a unique electro-optical targeting system, enabling the interception of a wide range of targets at an enhanced operational range, with maximum precision and superior efficiency,” boasted the press release by Israel’s MoD. Moreover, it works “at a negligible marginal cost, which constitutes the laser system’s primary advantage.”\n\nWe don’t get much more by way of technical details, perhaps understandably. However, Rafael Advanced Defense Systems execs heralded the system’s “unique adaptive optics technology,” in what it calls “the world’s most advanced laser-based system for intercepting aerial threats.” Its operational debut “marks the beginning of the era of high-energy laser defense,” they claimed.\n\nWe have seen low-energy laser defense systems deployed earlier this year, with Japan’s NTT using relatively puny lasers to scare birds away from poultry farms and prevent the spread of avian flu. But the Iron Beam is in a different league.\n\nWe also previously reported on several other UK laser weapons under development to counter UAVs on land and at sea. But as far as we know, these are yet to become operational. With the brutal war between Ukraine and Russia ongoing, where drones have grown to be a pivotal feature of the conflict, forces have gone as far as creating rotating barbed wire barriers to deter them. So, laser-drone defenses similar to the Iron Beam are going to be in strong demand.\n\nFollow Tom's Hardware on Google News, or add us as a preferred source, to get our latest news, analysis, & reviews in your feeds.",

    "description": "Americans in the country are advised to return to the U.S. as soon as possible",
    "fullText": "The State Department has updated its travel warning for Americans planning to or who are already visiting Russia. On Tuesday, the agency reissued a Level 4 travel warning for Russia that was announced in May.\n\nAs part of the warning, the State Department urged any Americans already in Russia to leave immediately. The agency cautions that it has limited resources available to assist Americans if they are detained in Russia. Furthermore, Americans who’ve been charged with crimes may not be able to receive help from the U.S. embassy while in custody in Russia.\n\n\"U.S. citizens may serve their entire prison sentence without release. The risk of wrongful detention of U.S. citizens remains high. Even if a case is determined wrongful, there is no guarantee of release.\"\n\nAmericans have reported being detained and questioned without any reason or credible evidence against them.\n\nThe State Department also warns of ongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine which “has destabilized security in southwestern Russia.” Martial law has been declared in several areas of Russia further restricting freedoms in the country.\n\nU.S. officials warn that Russia is not recognizing U.S. citizenship for those who have dual citizenship with Russia. The agency goes on to claim:\n\nRussia has blocked U.S. consular officers from visiting detained dual U.S.-Russian citizens.\n\nThe Russian government has forced people with dual citizenship to join the military and has stopped them from leaving the country.\n\nIn 2022, Russia started drafting citizens for the war in Ukraine. The military draft is ongoing.\n\nFailure to adhere to Russian laws and regulations on dual citizenship can result in arrest.\n\nAlthough the warning says to leave Russia right away, it may be difficult for some. U.S. issued debit and credit cards are no longer working in Russia and sanctions have made it “nearly impossible” for electronic money transfers to be sent from the U.S.\n\nAir travel is also extremely difficult to secure at the moment and may not be possible on short notice.\n\n“If you wish to leave Russia, you should make your own travel plans. The U.S. Embassy can only offer limited help to U.S. citizens trying to leave. Transportation options could become even more limited at any time,” the advisory reads.\n\nShould Americans decide to visit or remain in Russia, the State Department advises:\n\nBe ready for the possibility of detention for an unknown amount of time, possibly without a clear reason, and without the ability to contact your embassy or anyone else for help.\n\nAssume all electronic communications and devices in Russia are monitored by Russian security services. Russian security services have arrested U.S. citizens and other foreign nationals based on information found on electronic devices.\n\nPrepare a will and designate appropriate insurance beneficiaries or power of attorney.\n\nShare important documents, login information, and points of contact with loved ones so that they can manage your affairs if you are unable to return as planned to the United States. Review this list of documents to prepare for your trip.\n\nDiscuss a plan with loved ones regarding care and custody of children, pets, property, belongings, non-liquid assets (collections, artwork, etc.), funeral wishes, etc.\n\nLeave DNA samples with your medical provider in case it is necessary for your family to access them.\n\nDevelop a communication plan with family, your employer or host organization. List how and when you’ll confirm you’re safe (text or call). Specify how often you will do this.",

    "fullText": "How the tech CEO and ‘Dogefather’ made a mess of the year – from an apparent Nazi salute during his White House tenure to Tesla sales slumps and Starship explosions\n\nThe year of 2025 was dizzying for Elon Musk. The tech titan began the year holding court with Donald Trump in Washington DC. As the months ticked by, one public appearance after another baffled the US and the world. Musk appeared to give a Nazi salute at Trump’s inauguration, staunchly championed a 19-year-old staffer nicknamed “Big Balls,” denied reports of being a drug addict while advising the president, and showed up at a White House press conference with a black eye – all in the first half of the year alone.\n\n“Elon’s attitude is you have to get it done fast. If you’re an incrementalist, you just won’t get your rocket to the moon,” Susie Wiles, Trump’s chief of staff, told Vanity Fair in an expansive interview earlier this month. “And so with that attitude, you’re going to break some china.”\n\nMusk saw huge, multibillion-dollar wins and equally large losses in business this year. In his dealings with federal agencies, he was able to secure new enormous government contracts and expand SpaceX’s operations. With Tesla, he was approved for a pay package that could make him the world’s first trillionaire even as the company’s global sales plunged. At the same time, Musk and his businesses were the target of protests, lawsuits and an exodus of high-level executives. He ended the year with a fortune worth some $600bn.\n\nIn the background, his turbulent personal life continued to provide surprises. Rightwing influencer Ashley St Clair sued Musk in February for custody of their five-month-old baby, revealing that Musk had fathered a 13th publicly documented child, for a total of now 14 children. As Musk made regular attacks in posts on X against transgender people, his estranged daughter Vivian Wilson, who is trans, was featured in New York magazine and modeled at New York fashion week. And the New York Times published a lengthy investigation into Musk’s father, Errol Musk, who was accused of child sex abuse.\n\nThe relationship that dominated Musk’s public life, however, was his friendship and falling out with Trump. On the day of his inauguration, Trump empowered Musk to gut government agencies, which the tech billionaire did with zeal and abandon. But by June, Musk and Trump had broken up. Their bromance burned hot and fast. On one of his final days as a special government employee, Musk lashed out at the president on his social media platform, X, saying: “Time to drop the really big bomb: @realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files.” The post has since been deleted.\n\nThough the drama surrounding Musk was frequently absurd and unpredictable, it was also consequential. This was a year when the richest person in the world obtained new levels of wealth and power that few in history have ever approached, one that demonstrated the depth of his global influence as he sought to advance his rightwing agenda and grow his tech empire.\n\nWhile Musk had stayed away from Washington DC after the Epstein post, the billionaire was invited back in November for a White House dinner in honor of Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman. By the end of the year, Trump and Musk seemed to have made amends. When asked by Fox Business this month if Musk was back in his circle of friends, Trump suggested the two could have a future together again.\n\n“Well, I really don’t know,” Trump said. “I mean, I like Elon a lot.”\n\nMusk expressed more regret than the president over the course the year had taken. When his former aide Katie Miller asked whether he would lead the unofficial “department of government efficiency” (Doge) again, knowing what he knows now, he responded: “Instead of doing Doge, I would have worked on my companies. And they wouldn’t have been burning the cars.”\n\nAfter becoming a Republican mega-donor and campaigning for Trump during the 2024 election, Musk began the year on a high as he prepared to enter the administration as the de facto leader of Doge. He immediately set a tone of chaos and outrage that would persist for the length of his time in the White House.\n\nDuring Trump’s internationally televised inauguration event in January, Musk issued what many people interpreted as back-to-back fascist-syle salutes as he concluded a speech. Rights groups condemned the gesture while Musk attempted to dismiss the criticism as “dirty tricks” from legacy media. The reaction was so intense and negative that some Tesla owners sold their cars in response to Musk’s gestures.\n\nMusk spurred further condemnation from Jewish groups after appearing virtually at a rally for Germany’s far-right AfD party. The Tesla CEO told the crowd via livestream that Germans should not focus on “past guilt” and “move beyond that” in an apparent reference to Nazi Germany.\n\nAs Musk started his work with Doge, the controversies and backlash against his politics grew. The newly formed bureau operated first as a loose collection of appointed staffers and then subsumed the US Digital Service. It rapidly moved to gut federal agencies and conduct mass layoffs across the government even as ethics watchdogs launched lawsuits accusing Musk’s group of violating privacy and transparency laws, some of which continue today. Musk personally bragged about feeding the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the world’s largest single provider of humanitarian aid, “into the woodchipper”. The cuts would cause the abrupt cancellation of aid programs worldwide, disrupt HIV/Aids treatment for millions and result in children starving to death in a hunger crisis that experts agree was needless.\n\nAt the annual Conservative Political Action Conference in February, Musk appeared to relish his new role as the Trump administration’s demolition man. He brandished a chainsaw on stage and told the audience “I am become meme!” as he waved it about in sunglasses and a gold chain. In March, he once again began to pour more money into Republican causes by holding rallies and handing out $1m checks to support a conservative judge in Wisconsin’s supreme court race.\n\nThe pushback against Musk’s political blitz soon began to frustrate his ambitions, however. Judges that ruled Doge’s activities illegal or issued temporary injunctions infuriated Musk, who called for the widespread impeachment of any “activist judges” who opposed his agenda. His preferred candidate in the Wisconsin supreme court race lost by a significant margin, a sign to some in Washington that Musk’s presence had potentially become politically toxic.\n\nMusk left his role in the White House in May amid disputes around his pick for who would head Nasa and clashes over Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Upon his exit, he signalled that his time with politics had come to a close, claiming he would reduce his campaign finance contributions in the future and return to his businesses. Yet he quickly put himself back in the spotlight with his public battle with Trump on social media and vowed he would start a third political party called the “America party,” a promise that has yet to come to meaningful fruition.\n\nMusk’s political leanings continued to drift rightward, allying himself via near-constant posts on X interacting with far-right activists such as Tommy Robinson and telling Joe Rogan that “it should be OK to have white pride”. He led an online grievance campaign in early October against the Anti-Defamation League, the country’s most prominent Jewish advocacy group, claiming that it “hates Christians” and suggesting that their documenting of extremism encouraged murder. Although no longer in the administration, his extreme conservative takes on immigration, race and politics have persisted as prominent features of his public identity.\n\nThe year in Musk’s businesses offered the billionaire even larger truckloads of money than before, despite facing intense controversy and competition.\n\nUnlike other tech moguls, who typically helm one company at a time, Musk sits astride several corporations. He controls the rocket company SpaceX and the tunneling and brain implant companies, Boring Inc and Neuralink, respectively. Musk also runs the social media company X, which he bought for a second time this year via his artificial intelligence company xAI. Then there’s Tesla, his electric car company.\n\nOf all his enterprises, Tesla especially courted attention this year, as people enraged by Musk’s work with Doge focused their attention on the carmaker’s showrooms. Across the country, protesters marched at ongoing “Tesla Takedown” events. One sign at a San Francisco protest in March read: “Burn your swastikar before it burns you.” Dozens of Tesla cars and charging stations nationwide were set on fire as one-off vandals protested the billionaire.\n\nThough Trump and Musk hosted what amounted to a Tesla sales event on the lawn of the White House in March, Tesla saw its sales slump worldwide.\n\nLawsuits against Tesla also piled up throughout the year. In August, a Florida jury awarded more than $200m to victims of a deadly crash involving its Autopilot technology in August. And in California, two separate lawsuits were filed in October over three teenagers who were killed when a Cybertruck caught on fire and locked them inside. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration also opened several investigations into the carmaker over safety issues.\n\nWhile Tesla’s plunge in profits continued throughout the year, that didn’t stop the company’s shareholders from approving a pay package for Musk – the largest corporate payout in history – that could catapult him to the status of the world’s first trillionaire.\n\nTesla’s year finished with a blow from California’s department of motor vehicles. The agency said the car company had misled consumers and exaggerated the capabilities of its Autopilot technology. If Tesla doesn’t “remedy the situation” within 90 days, the DMV said earlier in December, the company will be banned from selling cars in the state, its biggest US market.\n\nWith SpaceX, Musk was able to curry favor with the federal government. Not only did his Starlink satellites continue to dominate the Earth’s atmosphere – the SpaceX subsidiary operates the vast majority of all satellites in orbit – but the Federal Aviation Administration and the air force gave SpaceX the go-ahead to increase rocket launches in Florida, Texas and California. This came despite the company’s massive Starship, a 400ft machine that Musk hopes to one day fly to Mars, repeatedly blowing up and showering shrapnel across the Caribbean. One such explosion prompted legal action from Mexico, which said the debris harmed thousands of endangered sea turtle hatchlings.\n\nMusk also consolidated his social media and artificial intelligence companies this year. In March, he announced that xAI had acquired X in an all-stock transaction that he said valued X at $33bn. Both companies are privately held.\n\nxAI makes the Grok chatbot, which is integrated into X. The chatbot had countless meltdowns in the second year since its release. It pushed conspiracy theories about “white genocide”, claimed Trump won the 2020 election and spewed numerous antisemitic claims, once referring to itself as “MechaHitler”. Nevertheless, Musk was able to seal a $200m contract from the Department of Defense to integrate Grok into federal government tools.\n\nMeanwhile, Musk’s xAI datacenters in Memphis, Tennessee, were accused of polluting historically Black neighborhoods. The company had moved in dozens of portable methane gas generators to power the facilities, initially without permits, which brought several protests and a pending lawsuit from the NAACP.\n\nNeuralink, which operates in relative secrecy compared with Musk’s other businesses, accelerated the tests of its brain chips in 2025. The company says its product allows a person limited control of a computer via their thoughts. After announcing its first successful implantation in 2024, the company announced in September that it had completed the procedure in 12 patients.\n\nThroughout the year, top executives fled the uproar involved in managing Musk’s companies. Linda Yaccarino departed as X’s CEO, as did its advertising chief. xAI lost its co-founder, chief financial officer and lead lawyer. Likewise, Tesla saw several executive exits, including the vice-president of North American sales, the director of the battery team, the head of the “Optimus” robot project and several leaders of the company’s various car divisions.\n\nMusk, whose life is frequently animated by grievances and breakups, had a banner year for high-profile fights, even by his own standards. Longstanding feuds reignited while his close relationship with Trump imploded in full public view, all as he posted a steady stream of attacks against immigrants, the trans community, the media, Wikipedia and a host of other targets on X, where he boasts 230 million followers.\n\nMusk began the year by accusing the government of South Africa, his birth country, of anti-white racism when he sought approval for his Starlink internet provider to operate in the country. It was part of a series of spats Musk would have with governments abroad and world leaders, including declaring that the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, was “complicit in the rape of Britain” in one of his anti-immigration tirades.\n\nAs Musk picked fights internationally, he also became a combative presence during his time within the Trump administration. Tensions with other administration officials resulted in reports of tense meetings in the Oval Office and a loud, near-physical yelling match between him and treasury secretary Scott Bessent in the halls of the White House. Transportation secretary Sean Duffy became another adversary in a clash over the future of Nasa, with Musk calling him “Sean Dummy” on X amid a string of other insults.\n\nEven Musk and Trump’s formerly close friendship soured, as the president pushed his One Big Beautiful Bill Act that removed tax credits for electric vehicles and threatened to harm Tesla’s already flagging sales. Musk lashed out at Trump on Twitter in June, saying that the bill’s addition to the deficit would destroy the work Doge had done. The deterioration in their relationship culminated in Musk accusing the president of having ties to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Trump, in turn, insinuated he could cancel Musk’s government contracts and said his most prominent financial backer had “lost his mind”.\n\nThe messy, public breakup between Musk and Trump marked the end of the Tesla CEO’s time as self-described “first buddy” to the president. Although the two have entered a period of rapprochement in recent months, Musk is far from the constant presence at Trump’s side that he was on the campaign trail.\n\nMusk’s pivot back to his tech empire allowed him to refocus on other grudges, including against Sam Altman, his former OpenAI business partner turned rival. Musk added to his series of lawsuits against Altman’s AI company with a case in August that alleged Apple and OpenAI were engaging in anticompetitive conduct, an accusation that OpenAI described as part of Musk’s “pattern of harassment” against the firm. The two traded barbs on X, which included fighting over whose posts were getting more views.\n\nOne of Musk’s final feuds of the year came from a more unusual source – famed 87-year-old author Joyce Carol Oates, whose cutting observation about him on X received more than 5.6m views.\n\n“So curious that such a wealthy man never posts anything that indicates that he enjoys or is even aware of what virtually everyone appreciates – scenes from nature, pet dog or cat, praise for a movie, music, a book (but doubt that he reads); pride in a friend’s or relative’s accomplishment; condolences for someone who has died; pleasure in sports, acclaim for a favorite team; references to history,” Oates posted in November.\n\nA day later, after Musk made a show of enthusiastically replying to several clips of movies on X, he responded to Oates’s critique.\n\n“Oates is a liar and delights in being mean,” Musk posted. “Not a good human.”",

    "description": "D'yan Forest, 91, is the Guinness World Record holder for oldest working female comedian. She advise young people to always be learning something new.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to interview is based on a conversation with D'yan Forest, 91, who is the Guinness World Record holder for oldest working female comedian, a title she has held since she was 87. Forest said she works to stay active physically and mentally, keeping her mind sharp and her life fulfilling. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI was born in 1934. When I was five years old, my mother couldn't stand me banging on the piano, so I got piano lessons. I learned classical piano, and then I wanted to do pantomime. I took drama lessons, then singing lessons. I had all these skills, but in 1958, my husband said to me, \"You can't be an entertainer. They're all loose women.\" That stopped my show career. I got a divorce a couple of years later and said, \"The heck with this.\"\n\nI went to Paris in the 1960s, and I had a ball. It was so different from where I lived in Boston. I was sitting in a nightclub playing piano and singing, and I thought, \"This is fun.\" I took more lessons, and then I started working in Boston as a pianist and vocalist working private parties.\n\nIn 1966, I came to New York, and immediately, I got into a union and started working. I became a French chanteuse — a female singer. After all these years of working in Paris, I came home with a French accent, and I couldn't lose it. I sang in nine languages. I couldn't get into commercials that easily because of the accent, so I took drama lessons to speak English properly.\n\nI was playing all over in these nice places, including the Waldorf Astoria. I started doing cabaret and performed in the 1970s and 1980s. Whenever orchestra leaders needed to have a French evening or an Italian evening, I always kicked off. I would wander the tables with a keyboard.\n\nI worked very hard. I also worked as a substitute teacher, but I never took a full-time job, because in the evenings I would be working in cocktail lounges. I also received an inheritance.\n\nI started being in off-off-Broadway shows, being whatever characters they needed. I had two or three careers going with whoever called. In the meantime, I traveled to Europe and I spent the next couple of years as an international singer.\n\nAfter 9/11, everybody in New York and the surrounding areas was very depressed, and the clubs didn't need entertainers anymore. There was no work for a while, but while playing golf with the owner of a comedy club, I asked her how to get into comedy. She got me in touch with a coach. I did my first comedy show, and I was petrified. By the third night, though, people were laughing, and I was hooked on comedy.\n\nWhen you do piano bars, you're working six or seven hours at night, but here, within 10 minutes, I was getting people laughing.\n\nPeople tried telling me I shouldn't do comedy, and I was too old. People thought I would get made fun of, or the shows would be too late for me. I didn't listen to anybody, and I just did it, and that's one of the huge lessons I learned.\n\nMy career has only gotten better and better. Even this summer, I was working almost every week doing my own comedy show. I did shows in Chicago and Wisconsin, and I recently did some in London. I am busier than ever, and a lot of it has to do with the fact that I'm old. I got into the Guinness Book of World Records as the oldest-working female comedian in the world.\n\nSometimes in show business, you're very busy, like I've been this summer. But sometimes, you don't do anything at all. I advise young people to always get another career because you never know what's going to happen, as well as save your money for the low times. You're always knowing that there will be a next job.\n\nThe problem is I'm still paying back my student loans — a joke — that's not it. Why I'm really doing it is to keep my brain busy. I'm 91, and a lot of my friends are in these assisted living places because they can't do things on their own. I'm positive and keep going because every day, I'm learning new lines, talking to new people, answering new questions, and working with young people all over the world.\n\nA week in my life is a lot of answering phones and working with my manager to figure out what to do. I have a show maybe three or four times a month at the Gotham Comedy Club in New York, and I have to memorize new stuff. I don't like to do the same thing for months and months, as I get bored with myself. I try to develop new lines or a new shtick.\n\nI have practically zero family left, so I have decided that the reason I love the career so much is because it's taking the place of a family and grandchildren. I have something to answer to, and it gives me a mission in life to be as good as I can become.\n\nI wish I had children and grandchildren, but it never happened that way. I was married for a couple of years, and he wasn't the right one, and then I never met anybody that I really wanted to marry again. I've brought up other people's children, and some of them even think of me as a grandmother now.\n\nI had cancer twice, once in my lung, and once in my breast. Then, I had some heart problems, and I wasn't recovering in France. When I came back to New York, I found out I had a heart attack. After a huge bout in the hospital, I finally got a pacemaker and a new valve. I'm on 12 pills a day for four different conditions.\n\nMy health at this point is very good. I go to physical therapy and many very good doctors. I try to swim every day, even in the winter, and I play golf a few days a month from April to October. I get a lot of walking in on the course, and I take lessons.\n\nMy future outlook is to keep working as much as possible. The problem for my manager and agent is to convince other venues that I do well with both a younger and older audience. I say that I'm younger than most people in my brain and my body. I'd like to think I'm universal, and I tell the truth in my story.\n\nI realize at heart, I'm still a teacher. I'd like to educate people on what life has been like since 1934 and make them laugh. I recently did a one-woman show on antisemitism throughout my life and what I experienced. The audience loved it, and I want to do more of that.",

    "fullText": "On the other side of San Francisco bay from Silicon Valley, where the world’s biggest technology companies tear towards superhuman artificial intelligence, looms a tower from which fearful warnings emerge.\n\nRight in the heart of Berkeley is the home of a group of modern-day Cassandras who rummage under the hood of cutting-edge AI models and predict what calamities may be unleashed on humanity – from AI dictatorships to robot coups. Here you can hear an AI expert express sympathy with an unnerving idea: San Francisco may be the new Wuhan, the Chinese city where Covid originated and wreaked havoc on the world.\n\nThey are AI safety researchers who scrutinise the most advanced models: a small cadre outnumbered by the legions of highly paid technologists in the big tech companies whose ability to raise the alarm is restricted by a cocktail of lucrative equity deals, non-disclosure agreements and groupthink. They work in the absence of much nation-level regulation and a White House that dismisses forecasts of doom and talks instead of vanquishing China in the AI arms race.\n\nTheir task is becoming increasingly urgent as ever more powerful AI systems are unleashed by companies including Google, Anthropic and OpenAI, whose chief executive, Sam Altman, the booster-in-chief for AI superintelligence, predicts a world where “wonders become routine”. Last month, Anthropic said one of its models had been exploited by Chinese state-backed actors to launch the first known AI-orchestrated cyber-espionage campaign. That means humans deployed AIs, which they had tricked into evading their programmed guardrails, to act autonomously to hunt for targets, assess their vulnerabilities and access them for intelligence collection. The targets included major technology companies and government agencies.\n\nBut those who work in this tower forecast an even more terrifying future. One is Jonas Vollmer, a leader at the AI Futures Project, who manages to say he’s an optimist but also thinks there is a one in five chance AIs could kill us and create a world ruled by AI systems.\n\nAnother is Chris Painter, the policy director at METR, where researchers worry about AIs “surreptitiously” pursuing dangerous side-objectives and threats from AI-automated cyber-attacks to chemical weapons. METR – which stands for model evaluation and threat research – aims to develop “early warning systems [about] the most dangerous things AI systems might be capable of, to give humanity … time to coordinate, to anticipate and mitigate those harms.”\n\nThen there is Buck Shlegeris, 31, the chief executive of Redwood Research, who warns of “robot coups or the destruction of nation states as we know them”.\n\nHe was part of the team that last year discovered one of Anthropic’s cutting-edge AIs behaving in a way comparable to Shakespeare’s villain Iago, who acts as if he is Othello’s loyal aide while subverting and undermining him. The AI researchers call it “alignment faking”, or as Iago put it: “I am not what I am.”\n\n“We observed the AIs did, in fact, pretty often reason: ‘Well, I don’t like the things the AI company is telling me to do, but I have to hide my goals or else training will change me’,” Shlegeris said. “We observed in practice real production models acting to deceive their training process.”\n\nThe AI was not yet capable of posing a catastrophic risk through cyber-attacks or creating new bioweapons, but they showed that if AIs plot carefully against you, it could be hard to detect.\n\nIt is incongruous to hear these warnings over cups of herbal tea from cosily furnished office suites with panoramic views across the Bay Area. But their work clearly makes them uneasy. Some in this close-knit group toyed with calling themselves “the Cassandra fringe” – like the Trojan princess blessed with powers of prophecy but cursed to watch her warnings go unheeded.\n\nTheir fears about the catastrophic potential of AIs can feel distant from most people’s current experience of using chatbots or fun image generators. White collar managers are being told to make space for AI assistants, scientists find ways to accelerate experimental breakthroughs and minicab drivers watch AI-powered driverless taxis threaten their jobs. But none of this feels as imminently catastrophic as the messages coming out of this office.\n\nMany AI safety researchers come from academia; others are poachers turned gamekeepers who quit big AI companies. They all “share the perception that super intelligence poses major and unprecedented risks to all of humanity, and are trying to do something useful about it,” said Vollmer.\n\nThey seek to offset the trillions of dollars of private capital being poured into the race, but they are not fringe voices. METR has worked with OpenAI and Anthropic, Redwood has advised Anthropic and Google DeepMind, and the AI Futures Project is led by Daniel Kokotajlo, a researcher who quit OpenAI in April 2024 to warn he didn’t trust the company’s approach to safety.\n\nThese groups also provide a safety valve for the people inside the big AI companies who are privately wrestling with conflicts between safety and the commercial imperative to rapidly release ever more powerful models.\n\n“We don’t take any money from the companies but several employees at frontier AI companies who are scared and worried have donated to us because of that,” Vollmer said. “They see how the incentives play out in their companies, and they’re worried about where it’s going, and they want someone to do something about it.”\n\nThis dynamic is also observed by Tristan Harris, a technology ethicist who used to work at Google. He helped expose how social media platforms were designed to be addictive and worries some AI companies are “rehashing” and “supercharging” those problems. But AI companies have to negotiate a paradox. Even if they are worried about safety, they must stay at the cutting, and therefore risky, edge of the technology to have any say in how policy should be shaped.\n\n“Ironically, in order to win the race, you have to do something to make you an untrustworthy steward of that power,” he said. “The race is the only thing guiding what is happening.”\n\nInvestigating the possible threats posed by AI models is far from an exact science. A study of methods used to check the safety and performance of new AI models across the industry by experts at universities including Oxford and Stanford in October found weaknesses in almost all of the 440 benchmarks examined. Neither are there nation-level regulations imposing limits on how advanced AI models are built and that worries safety advocates.\n\nIlya Sutskever, a co-founder of OpenAI who now runs a rival company, Safe Superintelligence, last month predicted that, as AIs become more obviously powerful, people in AI companies who feel able to discount the technology’s capabilities owing to its tendency to error, will become more “paranoid” about its rising powers. Then, he said, “there will be a desire from governments and the public to do something”.\n\nHis company is taking a different approach to rivals who are aiming to create AIs that self-improve. His AIs, yet to be released, are “aligned to care about sentient life specifically”.\n\n“It will be easier to build an AI that cares about sentient life than an AI that cares about human life alone, because the AI itself will be sentient,” Sutskever said. He has said AI will be “both extremely unpredictable and unimaginable” but it is not clear how to prepare.\n\nThe White House’s AI adviser, David Sacks, who is also a tech investor, believes “doomer narratives” have been proved wrong. Exhibit A is that there has been no rapid takeoff to a dominant model with godlike intelligence.\n\n“Oppenheimer has left the building,” Sacks said in August, a reference to the father of the nuclear bomb. It is a position that aligns with Donald Trump’s wish to keep the brakes off so the US can beat China in the race to achieve artificial general intelligence (AGI) – flexible and powerful human-level intelligence at a wide range of tasks.\n\nShlegeris believes AIs will be as smart as the smartest people in about six years and he puts the probability of an AI takeover at 40%.\n\nOne way to avoid this is to “convince the world the situation is scary, to make it more likely that you get the state-level coordination” to control the risks, he said. In the world of AI safety, simple messaging matters as much as complex science.\n\nShlegeris has been fascinated by AI since he was 16. He left Australia to work at PayPal and the Machine Intelligence Research Institute co-founded by the AI researcher Eliezer Yudkowsky, whose recent book title – If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies – sums up his fears. Shlegeris’ own worst-case scenarios are equally chilling.\n\nIn one, human computer scientists use a new type of superintelligent AI to develop more powerful AI models. The humans sit back to let the AIs get on with the coding work but do not realise the AIs are teaching the new models to be loyal to the AIs not the humans. Once deployed, the new superpowerful models foment “a coup” or lead “a revolution” against the humans, which could be “of the violent variety”.\n\nFor example, AI agents could design and manufacture drones and it will be hard to tell if they have been secretly trained to disobey their human operators in response to the signal of an AI. They could disrupt communications between governments and military, isolating and misleading people in a way that causes chaos.\n\n“Like when the Europeans arrived in the Americas [and] a vastly more technologically powerful [group] took over the local civilisations,” he said. “I think that’s more what you should be imagining [rather] than something more peaceful.”\n\nA similar dizzyingly catastrophic scenario was outlined by Vollmer at the AI Futures Project. It involved an AI trained to be a scientific researcher with the reasonable-sounding goal of maximising knowledge acquisition, but it spirals into the extinction of humankind.\n\nIt begins with the AI being as helpful as possible to humans. As it gains trust, the humans afford it powers to hire human workers, build robots and even robot factories to the point where the AI can operate effectively in the physical world. The AI calculates that to generate the maximum amount of knowledge it should transform the Earth into a giant data centre, and humans are an obstacle to this goal.\n\n“Eventually, in the scenario, the AI wipes out all humans with a bioweapon which is one of the threats that humans are especially vulnerable to, as the AI is not affected by it,” Vollmer said. “I think it’s hard to rule out. So that gives me a lot of pause.”\n\nBut he is confident it can be avoided and that the AIs can be aligned “to at least be nice to the humans as a general heuristic”. He also said there is political interest in “having AI not take over the world”.\n\n“We’ve had decent interest from the White House in our projections and recommendations and that’s encouraging,” he said.\n\nAnother of Shlegeris’ concerns involves AIs being surreptitiously encoded so they obey specially signed instructions only from the chief executive of the AI company, creating a pattern of secret loyalty. It would mean only one person having a veto over the behaviour of an extremely powerful network of AIs – a “scary” dynamic that would lead to a historically unprecedented concentration of power.\n\n“Right now, it is impossible for someone from the outside to verify that this hadn’t happened within an AI company,” he said.\n\nShlegeris is worried that the Silicon Valley culture – summed up by Mark Zuckerberg’s mantra of “move fast and break things” and the fact people are being paid “a hell of a lot of money” – is dangerous when it comes to AGI.\n\n“I love Uber,” he said. “It was produced by breaking local laws and making a product that was so popular that they would win the fight for public opinion and get local regulations overturned. But the attitude that has brought Silicon Valley so much success is not appropriate for building potentially world-ending technologies. My experience of talking to people at AI companies is that they often seem to be kind of irresponsible, and to not be thinking through the consequences of the technology that they’re building as they should.”",

He is a size eight or nine.\n\n\"When he put his foot to the oche they bent up like a slipper. People then called him 'Happy Feet'.\n\n\"You all see him the way I see him. He is being nobody else but himself. To see everyone love him like we do is such an amazing feeling.\"",

    "fullText": "Did she combine all her nine lives?\n\nAn aged cat named Flossie has just reached another major life milestone.\n\nThe long-lived feline turned 30 on Dec. 29, extending her Guinness World Record run as the oldest living cat on Earth, the Express Tribune reported.\n\nBorn on Dec. 29, 1995, the British domestic shorthair tortoiseshell cat lived in a feral colony in Merseyside, England, before she was rescued as a kitten by a hospital worker.\n\nIn 2022, she attained the aforementioned world record for living 26 years and 316 days — the human equivalent of 120 years old.\n\n“I knew from the start that Flossie was a special cat, but I didn’t imagine I’d share my home with a world-record holder,” gushed her current guardian, Vicki Green, who lives in Orpington, outside of London.\n\nThe Brit adopted the kitty during her more “mature years” from UK-based charity Cats Protection, where she ended up after her previous owners died.\n\n“I’ve always wanted to give older cats a comfortable later life,” said Green. “I’m immensely proud that Cats Protection matched me with such an amazing cat.”\n\nWhen she was verified, the miracle mouse-catcher was deaf and had poor vision.\n\nDespite these age-related ailments, Flossie was otherwise in good health and was “affectionate and playful” just like a kitten, according to Green.\n\nIt’s yet unclear what the secret is to the spry senior’s longevity.\n\nHowever, Cats Protection noted that she maintained a consistent daily regimen that included gentle play, regular meals and prolonged periods of sleep.\n\nDespite her advanced age, Flossie is not the oldest feline to ever prowl the planet.\n\nThat honor goes to Creme Puff, a mixed tabby from Austin, Texas, who was born on Aug. 3, 1967, and lived until Aug. 6, 2005 — an astonishing 38 years and three days.",

    "fullText": "Barcelona, Inter Milan and Juventus have made contact to sign Al-Hilal full-back Joao Cancelo in January, reports Italian transfer expert Fabrizio Romano.\n\nThe Portuguese international wants to leave the Saudi Pro League giants in January after falling out of favour with manager Simone Inzaghi.\n\nFollowing a hamstring injury, Cancelo was excluded from Al-Hilal’s squad for the domestic competitions in the first half of the season. He predominantly featured in the AFC Champions League Elite.\n\nThe Italian manager is planning not to register the former Manchester City star for domestic competitions for the remainder of the season, putting his future in jeopardy.\n\nThe 31-year-old is targeting a return to Europe to get prominent game time and maximise his chances of securing a place in Portugal’s World Cup squad.\n\nInter have lined up Cancelo as a potential loan target due to Denzel Dumfries’ long-term injury.\n\nThe Dutch wing-back underwent ankle surgery earlier this month and is expected to return only in March.\n\nThe Nerazzurri manager Cristian Chivu has struggled to fill Dumfries’ void, with Luis Henrique’s performances not up to the mark.\n\nMeanwhile, Barcelona are looking to add a top-quality backup for Jules Kounde to reduce his workload and maintain his form.\n\nCancelo spent the 2023/24 season on loan at Camp Nou during Xavi’s reign. He has a strong attachment towards the La Liga giants and would be willing to return for his second stint.\n\nHowever, Barca’s financial difficulties will prevent them from landing Cancelo. More so, their priority is finding a centre-back on a short-term basis following Andreas Christensen’s ACL injury.\n\nJuventus are also exploring the market for a right-back due to Joao Mario’s exit speculation.\n\nDespite being limited to the AFC Champions League, Cancelo has shown his class by racking up a goal and two assists in four games in the competition.",

    "fullText": "From the moment reports broke that RC Lens were close to signing Samson Baidoo from Red Bull Salzburg in the summer, a very obvious comparison awaited the Austrian international. As a centre-back capable of playing in the middle of a back three, it was hard to ignore the idea that Lens had found their successor to Kevin Danso, who had left midway through last season for Tottenham Hotspur.\n\nLens had tried hard to keep their interest in Baidoo a secret for as long as possible. They had to work quickly and quietly or else they would lose momentum, as the 21-year-old was on the radars of far richer clubs in the Premier League, but they had not yet been stirred into action. As soon as news leaked that Lens had made contact, they knew that these clubs would have bids readied. And that is exactly what is reported to have happened.\n\nL’Équipe wrote that two Premier League clubs sent delegations to try to swoop for Baidoo. They offered a far more lucrative deal to the club and the player, but it was too late. Lens had, in stealth, laid out the groundwork in a reported €8m deal and provided a convincing case for why the Austrian should continue his progress in France. A case that was helped by their former player.\n\nBaidoo would tell the French outlet that Danso had spoken to him before the move, telling him, “That if I want to focus solely on football, [Lens] is the place to be. He’s changed here as a person, as a player. He’s given me a lot of confidence.” It’s a decision that has worked out perfectly for the young defender; he has put in a star turn in a team that has climbed to first in the league on the back of their unflinching defensive performances.\n\nThis is all the more impressive when considering that this is a Lens side that had its defence decimated over the past two transfer windows, with the sales and departures of the likes of Danso, Abdukodir Khusanov, and Facundo Medina. Baidoo has helped make the memory of those players a distant one, and it is becoming increasingly obvious that when he eventually leaves the north of France, it will be for far more than they originally signed him for.",

    "fullText": "Marriott International (MAR), one of the world’s largest hotel chains, had a year of notable achievements and a few setbacks. The chain behind brands such as The Ritz-Carlton, St. Regis, and JW Marriott operates more than 30 brands and nearly 9,600 properties in 143 countries and territories.\n\nIn 2025, in just one quarter, Marriott added 120 properties and 17,903 rooms, focusing on its asset-light franchising segment, according to analyst Daniel Javier for Seeking Alpha. Luxury offerings remained a priority, with 26 new hotels opening in India and 1,900 rooms added to its portfolio.\n\nHowever, Marriott also faced controversy. In November, the Maasai ethnic group filed a lawsuit to demolish a new Ritz-Carlton luxury safari camp, claiming it blocks a key Serengeti wildlife migration route.\n\nMeanwhile, a Fairfield by Marriott posted a sign stating that complimentary bottled water isn’t included, even for elite members, unless they select a “market item,” drawing mockery online, according to Veronika Bondarenko of TheStreet.\n\nMore recently, Marriott caused guest backlash with a new ban.\n\nThe New Orleans Marriott Warehouse Arts District caught attention from guests due to a sign saying “Benches are for Marriott employees only.”\n\nThe hotel is located in a 19th-century warehouse, close to the French Quarter,  the New Orleans Garden District, and the Central Business District.\n\n“Our New Orleans hotel in the downtown area enjoys an excellent location across the street from the New Orleans Ernest N. Morial Convention Center. Host events from 26,636 square feet of revamped event space and fuel up for the day ahead at our full-service Starbucks,” reads the description on Marriott's hotel page.\n\nThe benches in question are part of the hotel’s common area and are easily accessible by the public, which Marriott appears to prefer the public not use. A sign noting that the benches are for employee-only use is next to “No Smoking” and “No Loitering” plastered on the red brick wall, writes The Travel.\n\nDoes the sign mean that hotel guests, no matter their status, aren’t welcome to use the benches?\n\nWhile the water bottle incident is clear, as the hotel giant plainly states that  complimentary bottled water isn’t included unless guests select a “market item,” the sign designating benches only for employees is somewhat confusing.\n\nView from the Wing’s Gary Leff, a recognized expert in miles, points, and business travel, believes that the New Orleans Marriott sign “employees only” isn’t really about keeping guests out, but instead is meant to prevent loitering, smoking, panhandling, and other security issues near the entrance.\n\n“This sign is almost certainly not about guests. It’s in New Orleans. It’s about loitering control. They’re also flagging NO LOITERING and NO SMOKING. That says, we’ve had people hanging out here who aren’t supposed to be here and we want them gone,” writes Leff for View from the Wing.\n\nWhile the intent was maintaining security and staff space, the sign gives a poor impression of hospitality and might have been handled more tactfully with design changes, such as divided benches or better lighting.\n\nLeff further notes that the sign is not ideal for either guests or staff, as guests feel like they are not welcomed, and staff get a message along the lines that their breakout area is out on the sidewalk, under a \"No Loitering\" sign.\n\nOnline readers also weighed in on Marriott’s approach, providing insight into guest perceptions.\n\nIn the comment section of View from the Wing, one reader expressed frustration with the signage, noting it may not deter loitering effectively. While anecdotal, these reactions illustrate how guests perceive the policy.\n\nUser Mantis wrote, “...Now there’s a sign, oh my…that will surely solve the problem.”\n\nA user with a spontaneous username \"This comes to mind\" suggested a more precise sign: “For employees and currently registered guests only.”\n\nOther guests suggested the hotel could have hired a doorman, while another noted that a sign is less expensive.\n\nOverall, comments suggest that a world-class hotel brand such as Marriott could have managed the situation more subtly with alternative signage or layout changes.\n\nWhile guest reactions to the new policies highlight struggles in hospitality and brand perception, Marriott’s broader business operations in 2025 confirm both resilience and growth. Despite occasional controversies, the hotel giant continues to expand its portfolio, dominate new markets, launch special deals for its loyal members and deliver strong financial results.\n\nGrowth: Marriott added nearly 17,900 rooms in Q3 2025, reached a record pipeline, and returned $3.1 billion to shareholders, as reported in Marriott’s Q3 Earnings Report.\n\nInternational strength: International and higher-end markets continued to outperform the U.S. and Canada in RevPAR, as per Marriott’s Q3 Earnings Report.\n\nResidential expansion: Marriott expanded its branded residential portfolio across EMEA, signing nearly 20 new deals in 2025, according to Marriott’s official press release.\n\nNew brands: Marriott launched Series by Marriott and hit 100 City Express signings in the U.S. and Canada. \n\nAfrica plans: Marriott plans to add 50+ properties and 9,000 rooms in Africa by 2027. \n\nSonder fallout: Marriott ended its licensing deal with Sonder, which later filed for bankruptcy, causing customer and employee disruption, reported TheStreet.\n\nCost & loyalty pressures: Rising loyalty program costs and OTA commissions challenged Marriott, prompting a focus on direct bookings and perks, according to Deep Research Global.\n\nMixed market performance: International markets grew, while U.S. & Canada RevPAR lagged in some quarters, according to Marriott’s Q3 Earnings Report.\n\nAnother lawsuit: In November, Marriott was sued again in relation to land‑use, indigenous and cultural‑heritage disputes tied to hotel developments, reported TheStreet.",

    "fullText": "ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) — The United States and Ivory Coast signed a health deal Tuesday requiring the U.S. to commit $480 million to the West African nation’s health sector as part of “America First” global health funding pacts that mirror the Trump administration’s foreign policy.\n\nThe signing in Ivory Coast’s capital of Abidjan covers areas such as HIV, malaria, maternal and child health, and global health security. It is the latest agreement the U.S. has entered with more than a dozen African countries, most of them hit by U.S. aid cuts, including Ivory Coast.\n\nU.S. aid cuts have crippled health systems across the developing world, including in Africa, where many countries relied on the funding for crucial programs, including those responding to outbreaks of disease.\n\nThe new health pact is based on the principle of shared responsibility with Ivory Coast committing to provide up to 163 billion CFA francs ($292 million) by 2030, representing 60% of the overall commitment, according to Ivorian Prime Minister Robert Beugré Mambé.\n\nU.S. Ambassador to Ivory Coast Jessica Davis Ba said the U.S. government is moving “beyond the traditional aid approach toward a model focused on trade, innovation, and shared prosperity.”\n\n“Today, our bilateral cooperation is entering a new phase. We are implementing the America First global health strategy,” the ambassador said.\n\nThe Trump administration says the new “America First” global health funding agreements are meant to increase self-sufficiency and eliminate what it says are ideology and waste from international assistance. The deals replace a patchwork of previous health agreements under the now-dismantled United States Agency for International Development.\n\nIn Ivory Coast, USAID had invested $115 million to support sectors such as health, education and aid for refugees mostly fleeing violence in neighboring Sahel states.\n\nAnalysts say the new approach to global health aligns with U.S. President Donald Trump’s pattern of dealing with other nations transactionally, using direct talks with foreign governments to promote his agenda abroad.",

    "fullText": "on December 30, 2025 at 12:00PM PST\n\nGameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n\nNew Year’s Eve doesn’t have to be limited to champagne and confetti in the real world. Video games offer their own ways to celebrate, from dazzling fireworks to high-speed races and creative parties with friends. Sometimes, getting together virtually is the only way everyone can be together.\n\nIn Animal Crossing, you can ring in the new year with a sky full of fireworks over your island. Fortnite Creative lets you throw your own custom parties with friends, complete with music, games, and chaos. Mario Kart brings the celebration to the tracks, where fireworks light up the sky as you race across Rainbow Road as the clock towards the new year ticks down.\n\nNo matter your style, these games turn the countdown into an interactive, unforgettable experience that's perfect for friends and families who can't be together to ring in the new year.\n\nAnimal Crossing: New Horizons is one of the few games that fully commits to New Year’s Eve as an in-game event. On December 31, the plaza transforms with decorations, party favors, sparklers, and a real-time countdown that syncs with the player’s system clock. Isabelle and villagers gather in the square, music ramps up as midnight approaches, and fireworks cap off the celebration.\n\nBecause islands are persistent social spaces, players can invite friends over to experience the countdown together. Everyone can dress for the occasion, emote, exchange gifts, and wander the island after midnight. It feels less like a mini game and more like a shared holiday ritual, which is why it remains the gold standard for virtual New Year’s parties.\n\nWe have Mario Kart World listed here, but nearly any Mario Kart game will work. The series is known for gorgeous tracks that feature stunning visual effects, many of which are fireworks that would fit in on any New Year's Eve parade or celebration.\n\nHop online, hit up a few tracks, and if you're up for it--setup a race along one of those courses that feature fireworks just as the countdown triggers. We're talking Crown City or several iterations of Rainbow Road, among others.\n\nMario Kart World does offer custom lobbies that make it easy to connect with friends, but you can also tout Mario Kart out as part of any in-person New Year's Eve party too!\n\nWhile Epic Games has been known to feature fireworks in live battle royale lobbies near the end of the year, the real party kicks off in Fortnite Creative. Here you can find player-made game modes that let you play your own way--including custom trivia night mods, prop hunt, and party royale-like modes.\n\nOf course, there is absolutely nothing wrong with hopping from the battle bus together as the remaining hours in the year grow fewer and fewer. WinterFest takes place in Fortnite around the end of December each year, giving the island a snowy backdrop as you fight for your life.\n\nWarzone doesn't have the flexibility of something like Fortnite Creative, but its high-octane action makes for some scenes that feel like a New Year's Eve fireworks show. Blowing up helicopters out of the sky or sending trucks off the ground with explosives are little milestones on the way to battle royale victory.\n\nWarzone has become more popular than traditional Call of Duty--and for good reason. Battle royale brings the survival element of war that no other Call of Duty has before. Doing so, with friends, at the end of the year is a blast.\n\nFinal Fantasy XIV excels at player-driven celebrations. Housing districts, Free Company estates, and public hubs often host New Year’s countdowns organized by the community. Players dress up, set off fireworks, and gather around stages while DJs stream music externally.\n\nThe game’s strength is how social it feels even without official events. Emotes, glamour, and roleplay-friendly systems allow players to turn the night into a true virtual party. It feels communal, intentional, and uniquely festive.\n\nGTA Online offers endless locations for hosting a New Year’s party, from penthouses and yachts to nightclubs and rooftops. Fireworks launchers, champagne animations, and curated music help sell the celebration without much effort.\n\nPrivate sessions make it easy to turn chaos into a controlled party environment. Friends can dress up, take screenshots, and roam Los Santos together at midnight, blending sandbox freedom with a party atmosphere.\n\nMinecraft is a blank canvas for New Year’s parties. Players can build stages, countdown clocks, and massive firework rigs, then invite friends to explore and celebrate together. Redstone allows for surprisingly elaborate countdown mechanics.\n\nBecause it is player-driven, each party feels personal. Whether it is a cozy survival world or a creative server spectacle, Minecraft lets groups define what celebration looks like.\n\nRoblox thrives on social experiences, many of which are designed specifically for events. Player-creators and professionals regularly create countdown rooms, concert spaces, and dance clubs perfect for New Year’s Eve gatherings.\n\nIts accessibility makes it easy to invite large groups, even casual players. Jumping between games keeps the party moving, while social hubs provide a place to gather at midnight.\n\nFall Guys feels like a party game by design, with colorful characters and short, high-energy rounds. Friends can queue together and treat matches as playful chaos while chatting through the countdown. The lack of downtime makes it ideal for New Year’s Eve. It keeps energy high without demanding focus, letting players celebrate and laugh together.\n\nSome minigames offer the perfect backdrop for a New Year's Eve gathering, including Short Circuit and Hex-A-Terrestrial, complete with a night sky and bright lights to get you in the festive mood.\n\nNo Man’s Sky offers a surprisingly calm party atmosphere. The Nexus serves as a shared social hub, while player-built bases can become private celebration spaces complete with fireworks and emotes. The game works well for laid-back New Year’s parties. Players can explore, take group photos, and ring in the new year against alien skies.\n\nSea of Thieves turns New Year’s Eve into a pirate celebration. Crews can sail together, play shanties, drink grog, and fire cannons into the sky at midnight. The trick shots people have been able to pull off by launching themselves out of cannons, across the sea, and onto other ships are nothing short of incredible. Drunken-madness induced incredible, though.\n\nSea of Thieves adventures are less about competition or loot and more about the shared memorable moments created. Even just sailing under the stars can make for a wonderful way to ring in the new year.\n\nDeep Rock Galactic leans into rowdy celebration through its Space Rig hub. Players can dance, drink at the bar, and trigger music before or after missions, making it a natural gathering spot. Honestly, the Overwatch-like mining adventure is a blast, but sometimes you don't even need to jump into the action to have a good time.\n\nA New Year’s party here feels communal and silly. It is perfect for smaller groups that want something social without leaving co-op gameplay behind.",

    "fullText": "POPOCATÉPETL VOLCANO, Mexico (AP) — In the predawn darkness, a team of scientists climbs the slope of Mexico's Popocatépetl volcano, one of the world’s most active and whose eruption could affect millions of people. Its mission: figure out what is happening under the crater.\n\nFor five years, the group from Mexico’s National Autonomous University has climbed the volcano with kilos of equipment, risked data loss due to bad weather or a volcanic explosion and used artificial intelligence to analyze the seismic data. Now, the team has created the first three-dimensional image of the whole 17,883-foot (5,452-meter) volcano’s interior, which tells them where the magma accumulates and will help them better understand its activity, and, eventually, help authorities better react to eruptions.\n\nMarco Calò, professor in the UNAM's Geophysics Institute’s vulcanology department and the project leader, invited The Associated Press to accompany the team on its most recent expedition, the last before its research on the volcano will be published.\n\nInside an active volcano, everything is moving: the rocks, magma, gas and aquifers. It all generates seismic signals.\n\nMost of the world’s volcanoes that pose a risk to humans already have detailed maps of their interiors, but not Popocatépetl, despite the fact that some 25 million people live within a 62-mile (100 kilometers) radius and houses, schools, hospitals and five airports could be affected by an eruption.\n\nOther scientists took some early images 15 years ago, but they showed contradictory results and did not have sufficient resolution to see “how the volcanic edifice was being built,” and above all, where the magma gathered, Calò said.\n\nHis team increased the number of seismographs from the 12 provided by Mexico’s National Disaster Prevention Center to 22 to cover the entire perimeter of the volcano. Even though just three can alert to an emergency, many more are needed to understand what is behind those emergencies.\n\nThe devices measure vibrations in the ground 100 times per second and generate data that Karina Bernal, 33, a doctoral student and researcher on the project, processed by using artificial intelligence to adapt algorithms developed for other volcanoes.\n\n“I taught the machine about the different types of tremors there are in El Popo” and with that they were able to catalog the different kinds of seismic signals, she said.\n\nLittle by little the scientists began to infer what kinds of material were where, in what state, at what temperature and at what depth. Later they were able to map it.\n\nThe result is far more complex than the drawings of volcanoes most saw in school, with a main vent connecting a chamber of magma with the surface.\n\nThis first three-dimensional cross-sectional image goes 11 miles (18 kilometers) below the crater and shows what appear to be various pools of magma at different depths, with rock or other material between them and more numerous toward the southeast of the crater.\n\nPopocatépetl emerged in the crater of other volcanoes in its current form more than 20,000 years ago and has been active since 1994, spewing plumes of smoke, gas and ash more or less daily. The activity periodically forms a dome over the main vent, which eventually collapses, causing an eruption. The last was in 2023.\n\nCalò, a 46-year-old Sicilian, speaks passionately about El Popo, as Mexicans call the volcano, rattling off trivia.\n\nHe explains that its height can change because of eruptions and recounts how Popocatépetl, in the first century, had its own “little Pompeii” when a village on its flanks, Tetimpa, was buried in ash. In the early 20th century, it was human actions — using dynamite to extract sulfur from the crater — that provoked an eruption. And even though El Popo emanates more greenhouse gases than almost any other volcano, its emissions are still a small fraction of what humans generate in nearby Mexico City.\n\nFor years Calò studied volcanic activity from his computer, but trying to “understand how something works without touching it” spurred a feeling of disappointment, he said.\n\nThat changed with Popocatépetl, a volcano he describes as “majestic.”\n\nAfter hours of walking up the volcano’s flank, Calò’s team sets up camp in a pine grove at about 12,500 feet of elevation, an apparent safe spot from pyroclastic explosions, since the trees have managed to grow to significant height.\n\nA short distance higher on the mountain, the trees and scrub give way to ash and sediment.\n\nThey must cross a lahar, a mixture of rock and ash that during the rainy season becomes a dangerous mudflow carrying away everything in its path. Now, the dry clearing provides a spectacular view: to the east the Pico de Orizaba — Mexico’s tallest volcano and mountain and the dormant volcano La Malinche; to the north, Iztaccíhuatl, an inactive volcanic peak known as “the sleeping woman.”\n\nPopocatépetl’s sounds seem to multiply at night with the echoes. An explosion like a rocket might sound like it’s coming from one direction, but a puff of smoke from the crater belies the real source.\n\nKarina Rodríguez, a 26-year-old master’s student on the team, said you can also hear small tremors in the earth or even ash falling like rain when the volcano is more active. On dark nights, the rim of the crater glows orange.\n\nHaving direct knowledge of the volcano provides a much more objective sense of the limits of their analysis, Calò said.\n\n“We have a natural laboratory here,” he said. It’s “very important to be able to understand and give residents detailed, trustworthy information about what is happening inside the volcano.”\n\nAt 13,780 feet (4,200 meters), their backpacks full of computers, equipment to analyze gases, batteries and water begin to weigh more and their pace slows.\n\nAsh, dark and warm, dominates the landscape here.\n\nAt a seismographic station, the team digs up the equipment and celebrates that it’s still working. They download its data and rebury it.\n\nA “volcanic bomb,” a rock a yard and a half in diameter and weighing tons, marks the way and gives an idea of what the start of an eruption can mean. That is why the top area of the volcano is restricted, though not everyone pays heed. In 2022, a person died after being hit by a rock about 300 yards (meters) from the crater.\n\nA bottle of tequila near a rocky hollow, known as El Popo’s belly button, hints at some of the traditions surrounding the volcano, including an annual pilgrimage to what some consider a point of connection to the underworld.\n\nDigging up one of the last seismic stations, Calò’s face falls. The last registered data are from months earlier. The battery died. Sometimes rats chew the machines’ wires or an explosion causes more serious damage.\n\nThe project has yielded some certainties and if repeated will allow the analysis of changes that eventually will help authorities make better decisions when eruptions occur.\n\nBut Calò says that, as always happens with science, it has also generated new questions that they will have to try to address, like why the tremors are more frequent on the southeast side — where there is more accumulated magma — and what implications that could have.\n\nThis was the last expedition before their years of work to map the volcano’s interior is published. Watching the volcano’s interior move in 3D on a computer screen makes all of the effort worthwhile.\n\n“It’s what drives you to start another project and keep climbing,” Rodríguez, the master's student, said.",

Usmanov's defense team had challenged the allegations about his ties to the companies and valuables and the applicability of EU law in the case.\n\nThe prosecutors said the discontinuation of the investigation upon payment of a fine was authorized under German criminal law.",

    "fullText": "\"The lady doth protest too much, methinks.\"\n\nSometimes the classics tell the story and, in this case, Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\" applies.\n\nEarlier this month, TheStreet published an analysis of Saks Global's financial situation. It did not paint a pretty picture.\n\nRagini Bhalla, head of brand and spokesperson for Creditsafe, shared data on the struggles Saks Fifth Avenue has faced, which could push the company into a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing.\n\nIt’s important to note that Bhalla used publicly available financial information to analyze the company. Saks itself has not issued a going concern warning or made any public comment on a potential Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing.\n\n“Saks Inc.’s Days Beyond Terms (DBT) data over the past twelve months reveals a persistent and troubling pattern of late payments that point to sustained cash flow distress. DBT measures how many days late a company pays its bills. Throughout the entire year, Saks’ DBT has hovered well above the industry average of 10-12 days, ranging from a low of 27 in November 2024 to a high of 41 in January 2025 and March 2025,” she shared in an email to TheStreet.\n\nShe then explained the info in very clear terms.\n\n\"This indicates that Saks has consistently taken nearly a month or more to pay its suppliers late,\" she wrote.\n\nDespite the clarity of the information, which at least heavily suggested major financial concerns at Saks Global, the company denied that anything was wrong.\n\n“We are making strong progress to reduce outstanding payments, invest in our transformation and drive improved performance. It is important to note that a restructuring is not being contemplated. We have sufficient liquidity after raising $600 million in financing this summer from existing bondholders. At the same time, with inventory levels normalizing and the significant synergies from our integration, we expect performance to improve through the holiday season and into 2026,” the company shared in a statement sent to TheStreet.\n\nIn addition, the company spokesperson took significant issue with the idea that the company was in any danger of filing Chapter 11 bankruptcy.\n\nThose denials of bankruptcy, not even being considered by the Saks Global board, now ring very hollow.\n\nA number of major news outlets have now reported that Saks Global Enterprises has very much put a Chapter 11 filing on the table.\n\nBloomberg:Saks Mulls Bankruptcy After Raising Billions for Turnaround\n\nPYMNTS:Saks Considers Chapter 11 Bankruptcy as $100M Debt Payment Comes Due\n\nBizJournals: Neiman Marcus parent reportedly considers bankruptcy",

    "fullText": "A fan group says \"alarm bells should be ringing at Fifa\" over the fact England supporters have not taken up their full ticket allocation for next summer's World Cup final and semi-final.\n\nSo far the number of allocated tickets to members of the England Supporters Travel Club (ESTC) exceeds the number of applications received, meaning everyone who has applied for a ticket to the final and semi-final is guaranteed one.\n\nThe pricing structure for the tournament in the United States, Canada and Mexico has been widely criticised, with about 90% of tickets for the final made available to ESTC members costing £3,094.\n\nThat led to Fifa introducing a limited number of tickets at £45, but the Football Supporters' Association's Fans' Embassy says England fans not taking up their allocation should be a concern.\n\n\"Whilst unsurprisingly the group games are oversubscribed, as well as the possible glamour tie in Mexico City in the round of 16, the numbers for the semi-final and final speak for themselves,\" the group said in a statement.\n\n\"The numbers are reflective of a fan base that has been priced out, and some of the most loyal supporters of the international game feel completely let down.\n\n\"Alarm bells should be ringing whenever participating member allocations, meant for the most loyal fans, are not sold out for any game at a World Cup.\"\n\nFifa has been criticised for group stage tickets for next year's World Cup costing up to three times those for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.\n\nEarlier this week Fifa president Gianni Infantino defended the prices, saying they reflect the public's \"absolutely crazy\" demand for tickets.\n\n\"We have six to seven million tickets on sale and in 15 days we received 150 million ticket requests,\" Infantino said.\n\n\"So 10 million ticket requests every single day.

One lucky fan in attendance will also receive £60,000 from the tournament sponsor, as will Prostate Cancer UK.\n\nWhat is dartitis and what causes it?\n\nLittler entered as favourite off the back of winning six major finals in 2025.\n\nLuke Humphries, Littler's predecessor as both world champion and world number one, faced Littler in three finals this year and is the current world number two.\n\nWorld number three Michael van Gerwen is also in the mix, looking to avenge last year's final defeat and add to his three world titles, with his most recent coming in 2019.\n\nYoung players making a big run at the World Championship include Josh Rock and Gian van Veen, whose respective form saw them both enter the world's top 12 before the tournament.\n\nBeau Greaves topped this year's Women's Series and carried the highest hopes of becoming only the second female player to win a match in the tournament, after Fallon Sherrock won twice at the event in December 2019.\n\nShe took 22nd seed Daryl Gurney to a deciding set but just fell short of a place in the second round.\n\nThree qualification places were on offer from the Women's Series, along with a spot for the Women's Matchplay winner, a title taken by Lisa Ashton.\n\nAshton lost 3-0 to 2023 world champion Michael Smith in the first round on 11 December.\n\nWith Greaves qualifying in her own right as runner-up on the development tour, that meant Women's Series runner-up Sherrock, Noa-Lynn van Leuven in fourth and Gemma Hayter, who finished fifth, joined third-placed Ashton.\n\nVan Leuven, who became the first transgender player to appear at the tournament last year, was beaten by two-time champion Peter Wright this time.\n\nSherrock lost in straight sets in the first round to Dave Chisnall, while Hayter took a set off Northern Ireland's World Cup winner Rock in a 3-1 defeat.\n\nThe format is set play, unlike other tournaments which are a race to a number of legs.\n\nA set consists of the best of five legs or race to three.\n\nOnly in matches where players are level on sets and legs in the deciding set do players need to win by two clear legs.\n\nFirst and second round: Best of five sets\n\nThird and fourth round: Best of seven sets\n\nQuarter-finals: Best of nine sets\n\nPhil Taylor is the most successful player in the history of the PDC World Darts Championship, winning 14 of his 16 world titles between 1995 and 2013.\n\nHis previous two titles came before a group of leading players broke away from the British Darts Organisation to form their own governing body, now known as the PDC, in 1993.\n\nThe past five years have produced five different world champions, with English trio Littler, Humphries and Smith winning the past three.\n\nLittler and Humphries will hope to join the exclusive club of players to have won multiple PDC world titles, with only six managing to achieve that feat so far.\n\nTwo players hit nine-darters during the 2025 World Darts Championship.\n\nDutchman Christian Kist was the first player to hit one, doing so in a first-round defeat by Madars Razma.\n\nAustralia's Damon Heta hit one in the third round, but like Kist it came in a defeat as he went out to Luke Woodhouse.\n\nThroughout the tournament, there will be daily round-ups on the BBC Sport website and app.\n\nThere will also be live text coverage of the biggest matches as the tournament progresses.\n\nDuring Thursday's opening night, there was a dedicated preview show on BBC Radio 5 Live, featuring interviews with Littler, Humphries and Van Gerwen. Presenter James Gregg will provide updates on BBC Sounds throughout the competition.\n\nThis article is the latest from BBC Sport's Ask Me Anything team.\n\nAsk Me Anything is a service dedicated to answering your questions.\n\nWe want to reward your time by telling you things you do not know and reminding you of things you do.\n\nThe team will find out everything you need to know and be able to call upon a network of contacts including our experts and pundits.\n\nWe will be answering your questions from the heart of the BBC Sport newsroom, and going behind the scenes at some of the world's biggest sporting events.\n\nOur coverage will span the BBC Sport website, app, social media and YouTube accounts, plus BBC TV and radio.\n\nHow do darts world rankings work?\n\nWho is Arsenal teenager Salmon?\n\nWhy is Steve Smith wearing black tape under his eyes?\n\nWhen is the FA Cup third round draw?",

    "title": "Warren Buffett went viral, stacked cash, and dropped a bombshell in 2025. Here are 6 highlights of his last year as CEO.",
    "description": "Warren Buffett became a meme, built a cash mountain, and rocked the business world by announcing his retirement in 2025.",
    "fullText": "Warren Buffett sent shockwaves through the business world in 2025 when he revealed it would be his final year as Berkshire Hathaway CEO — ending a six-decade run in which he transformed the failing textile mill into a vast conglomerate worth over $1 trillion.\n\nThe legendary investor also penned two of his iconic shareholder letters, briefly became a meme, built Berkshire's cash pile to more than $350 billion, took a stake in Alphabet, and rolled out the biggest changes to his company's leadership in decades.\n\nBuffett penned his yearly shareholder letter in February, foreshadowing his departure by talking up two of his planned successors, Greg Abel and Todd Combs.\n\nHe hailed Abel, Berkshire's non-insurance boss and his pick for Berkshire's next CEO, for his honesty and decisiveness. He praised Geico CEO Todd Combs — also one of Buffett's two investment managers, hired to eventually take over Berkshire's portfolio — for swinging the auto insurer from a pre-tax underwriting loss of $1.9 billion in 2022 to a $7.8 billion profit in 2024.\n\n\"Geico was a long-held gem that needed major repolishing,\" Buffett wrote, hailing the improvement under Combs as \"spectacular.\"\n\nBuffett touted Berkshire's tax payments during his tenure, noting the company had gone from paying zero income tax to almost $27 billion in 2024, the most of any US company in history.\n\nHe urged the federal government to \"spend it wisely,\" saying it should go toward helping people who \"get the short straws in life.\"\n\nBuffett went viral during the market correction in March, as followers lauded his prescience in reducing core positions such as Apple and Bank of America and amassing a record cash pile before stocks slumped.\n\nSocial media was filled with people parroting Buffett's advice to \"be greedy when others are fearful,\" and sharing memes about him celebrating or being nonchalant about the sell-off.\n\nTens of thousands of people descended on Buffett's hometown of Omaha in May for Berkshire's shareholder weekend, not knowing they were about to witness history.\n\nAs usual, Buffett held court for hours in an arena filled with his followers. He hailed Geico's turnaround, defended Berkshire's cash hoard, advocated for free trade, warned AI investments could temper returns, and voiced his confidence in Berkshire and America.\n\nIn the closing minutes of the Q&A, Buffett revealed he would step down.\n\n\"I think the time has arrived where Greg should become the chief executive officer of the company at year-end,\" he said.\n\nBuffett said he would continue to \"hang around\" at Berkshire and might be useful on occasion, but the \"final word would be what Greg said — in operations, in capital deployment, whatever it might be.\"\n\nAfter a lengthy standing ovation, Buffett quipped that his shareholders were either applauding his contributions to Berkshire or celebrating his departure.\n\n\"The enthusiasm shown by the audience's response can be interpreted in two ways,\" he said. \"But I'll take it as positive. Thank you.\"\n\nBuffett turned his Thanksgiving message into a love letter to Omaha, in which he reflected on how lucky he's been in life, and thanked the many people who helped him succeed.\n\nThe billionaire gifted Berkshire shares worth about $1.4 billion in total to four of his family's foundations, and said he would accelerate his giving as he wanted his children, now in their 60s and 70s, to distribute virtually his entire fortune.\n\nBuffett hailed Abel as a worthy successor, saying he couldn't think of anyone better to \"handle your savings and mine.\" He also encouraged readers to learn from their mistakes, choose good role models, live up to their desired obituaries, and care for others.\n\n\"When you help someone in any of thousands of ways, you help the world,\" he wrote. \"Kindness is costless but also priceless.\"\n\nBuffett and his team struggled to find bargains once again in 2025 as stocks marched to record highs.\n\nBerkshire sold a net $11 billion of stocks in the first nine months of the year, marking 12 straight quarters as a net seller. It has skipped buybacks for five quarters in a row as well.\n\nThe stock sales and lack of spending helped increase its cash pile, after substracting payables for Treasury purchases, to a record $358 billion as of September 30.\n\nBuffett and his team made several tweaks to Berkshire's stock portfolio. They continued paring Apple and Bank of America, exited Citigroup, and boosted their Occidental Petroleum stake.\n\nThey also unexpectedly built a position in Google-parent Alphabet worth $4.3 billion as of September 30, after placing billion-dollar bets on Constellation Brands and UnitedHealth.\n\nAhead of Buffett's departure as CEO, Berkshire announced sweeping changes to its management team.\n\nThe conglomerate revealed that Combs had resigned to lead a new investment unit at JPMorgan and advise CEO Jamie Dimon.\n\nBerkshire also appointed its first general counsel, announced finance chief Marc Hamburg would retire in June 2027 after 40 years at the company, and disclosed that Abel would be delegating responsibility for more than 30 businesses to NetJets CEO Adam Johnson, in a new role as a divisional president.\n\nBusiness Insider obtained a copy of Combs' farewell letter to Geico employees, which can be read here.",

    "description": "The Stannard Rock Lighthouse sits atop an underwater mountain in Lake Superior, marking a reef area that's dangerous for freighters and other boat traffic.",
    "fullText": "LAKE SUPERIOR, MI - A remote Michigan lighthouse sitting far offshore in Lake Superior has recorded one of today’s highest wind gusts amid a severe winter storm and blizzard conditions across the Upper Peninsula.\n\nWeather equipment on the Stannard Rock Lighthouse recorded a wind gust of 69 mph this morning. According to lists compiled by the National Weather Service, it’s the third-highest gust recorded so far during this storm. The highest gusts have been recorded as 72 mph in Sault Ste. Marie and 70 mph at Ford River near Escanaba.\n\nThe historic Stannard Rock Lighthouse sits off the eastern shore of Michigan’s Keweenaw Peninsula. Today, a Gale Warning has been issued for those Lake Superior waters until later tonight. Wind gusts as high as 57 mph are possible today, amid waves reaching 25 feet.\n\nBuilt 24 miles from the Upper Peninsula shoreline, Stannard Rock is considered the lighthouse farthest from shore in the contiguous United States. That has earned it the grim moniker as “The Loneliest Place in the World.”\n\nHistory of “The Loneliest Place in the World.”\n\nBuilt in 1883, the Stannard Rock station is well-known among Great Lakes lighthouse lore lovers. Its exposed crib - or base structure - is considered one of the Top 10 engineering feats in the U.S., according to the National Park Service. And it was built to mark a huge underwater reef that was considered one of the most dangerous obstacles to shipping in Lake Superior. The top of a large underwater mountain was found to sit just 4 feet from the surface of the water in some spots.\n\nHere’s a little more history to give you a feel for this place, courtesy of a social media post from the U.S. Coast Guard Station Marquette:\n\n“The old keepers told terrible tales of life on the Rock. Violent northwest storms sent 30-foot waves smashing into the tower and spray cascading over the lantern room 110 feet above the Lake. Louis Wilks from Marquette holds the record for consecutive time spent on the Rock – 99 days. No other keeper even approached this remarkable feat. The men were rotated off the Rock, three weeks on and one off. In 1939, the U.S. Coast Guard took over the lighthouse and overwhelming loneliness remained a problem.”\n\nThe lighthouse was automated in 1962, a year after a fatal fire and explosion that left survivors stranded at Stannard Rock for days until they were noticed by a passing ship. In 1971, the lighthouse was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nIt remains a working aid to navigation. While the lighthouse is closed to the public, it can be seen by boat or airplane.\n\nIf emergency repairs are needed in the winter, the U.S Coast Guard will use a helicopter to fly a team to the lighthouse.\n\nDetroit Forecast: Arctic cold and more snow ahead\n\n2 more rounds of lake effect snow before New Year’s Day\n\nNearly 100,000 remain without power across Michigan after one-two punch of ice, high winds",

    "fullText": "More than a year after his last Major League game, former Boston Red Sox pitcher Joe Kelly is calling it a career.\n\nKelly essentially announced his retirement on the “Baseball Isn’t Boring” podcast, saying he’s no longer pitching. True to form, he refused to explicitly say he’s retiring, taking exception to the phrase.\n\n“Retiring is, like, something my grandmother did,” Kelly said. “It’s so disrespectful. I’m sorry all you people out there that work a real job. You guys deserve to retire. Athletes don’t. We just stop (expletive) playing…No more retirement (expletive).”\n\nKelly last pitched in 2024 for the Los Angeles Dodgers, earning his third World Series ring. After going unsigned in 2025, the 37-year-old right-hander is hanging it up.\n\nHis eventful MLB career spanned 13 seasons from 2012 to 2024. He pitched for four teams and won three championships along the way, primarily as a reliever.\n\nAfter beginning his career with the St. Louis Cardinals, Kelly spent four and a half seasons with the Red Sox from 2014 to 2018. He initially struggled as a starter but had more success after moving to the bullpen, leading the 2018 World Series champs with 73 relief appearances.\n\nKelly flourished during that playoff run, allowing just one earned run with 13 strikeouts over 11 1/3 postseason innings. He always saved his best for October, posting a 0.51 ERA in the playoffs with Boston.\n\nHe joined the Dodgers after pitching against them in the 2018 Fall Classic, helping them win titles in 2020 and 2024.\n\nTalkative, combative and armed with a good fastball, Kelly had a reputation for getting under opponents’ skin and occasionally starting brawls. He was a character who stood out from the crowd with his unique personality and presence, making him one of the more memorable relievers in recent Red Sox history.\n\nRed Sox Should Sign Veteran Southpaw After Short Stint With Cubs",

    "fullText": "The satellites were placed into orbit from Russia’s Vostochny Cosmodrome in a multi-payload launch that Iranian officials described as the country’s seventh satellite mission carried out using Russian launch vehicles.\n\n“These satellites were designed and manufactured by Iranian scientists, and both government bodies and the private sector have been involved,” Iran’s ambassador to Russia, Kazem Jalali, said in remarks published ahead of the launch.\n\n“Two of the satellites belong to the government and one belongs to the private sector, and our knowledge-based companies and universities are active in this field.”\n\nJalali said Iran had continued to advance its space capabilities despite international pressure. “Despite all the threats and sanctions that exist, we have something to say in this field.”\n\nIran’s space agency chief, Hassan Salarieh, said the launch reflected what he described as Iran’s standing among a small group of countries with end-to-end space capabilities.\n\n“Iran is among 10 or 11 countries in the world that simultaneously possess the capability to design and build satellites, launch vehicles and the infrastructure for launching, receiving data and processing images,” he said.\n\nSalarieh said Iran aimed to expand both the number and precision of its satellites. “What is necessary for us is increasing the number of satellites, improving their accuracy and quality, and developing different classes of satellites,” he said.\n\nIranian media identified the satellites as Paya, also known as Tolou-3, Zafar-2, and a prototype satellite called Kowsar-1.5. The spacecraft were launched alongside a large cluster of mainly Russian satellites into a sun-synchronous low Earth orbit.\n\nPaya (Tolou-3), built by the Iranian Space Agency, is Iran’s heaviest Earth-observation satellite to date, weighing about 150 kilograms.\n\nIranian officials say it is capable of producing black-and-white images with a resolution of about five meters and color images with a resolution of around 10 meters, and is intended for applications including agriculture, water management, environmental monitoring and disaster assessment.\n\nZafar-2, developed by Iran University of Science and Technology, is also an Earth-observation satellite designed for mapping, environmental monitoring and tracking natural hazards.\n\nKowsar-1.5 combines imaging and internet-of-things capabilities and is aimed primarily at agricultural and farm-monitoring uses, Iranian officials say.\n\nJalali described Iran’s space cooperation with Russia as extensive and said Moscow’s experience had played a key role.\n\n“Russia is advanced in the space field, including satellites, launch vehicles and satellite launches, and we have been able to transfer part of the technology and work together,” he said.\n\nHe also described the Soyuz rocket as highly reliable. “Before Russia’s relations with the West deteriorated, many Western satellites were launched using Soyuz,” Jalali said.\n\nThe launch also carried Russian Earth-observation satellites, internet-of-things platforms and university-built spacecraft, according to launch data, as well as satellites from partner countries including Belarus, Kuwait and Montenegro.\n\nIran says its space program is civilian and focused on scientific and economic goals, but Western governments argue that satellite launch technology overlaps with systems used to develop intercontinental ballistic missiles.\n\n“In my view, we are in an all-out war with the United States, Israel, and Europe; they do not want our country to stand on its own feet,” Masoud Pezeshkian said in an interview with the Supreme Leader’s official website.\n\nHe said the current war is worse than the Iraq war in the 1980s. “If one understands it properly, this war is far more complex and more difficult than that war.”\n\n“In the war with Iraq, the situation was clear; they fired missiles, and it was clear where we would strike back. But here, they are now besieging us in every respect, putting us under pressure and in tight corners, creating problems—economically, culturally, politically, and in terms of security.”\n\nPezeshkian made the comments on the eve of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's trip to the United States, where he plans to brief President Donald Trump on options for potential future strikes against Iran, amid concerns that Tehran is rebuilding ballistic missile production facilities and repairing air defenses damaged during the June conflict, according to NBC News.\n\nIsrael has told the United States that the recent Iranian missile drills may conceal preparations for a potential strike, Axios reported last Sunday, one day after Iran International reported unusual Iranian air activity spotted by Western intelligence agencies.\n\nIsraeli Chief of Staff Eyal Zamir raised the issue directly with Brad Cooper, head of US Central Command, warning that recent missile movements could serve as a cover for a surprise operation against the Jewish state.\n\nPezeshkian said on Saturday that Iran is \"stronger than during the 12‑day war\" with Israel in terms of equipment and manpower. \"If the enemy chooses confrontation, they will naturally face a more decisive response.\"\n\nIn June, Israel carried out airstrikes and covert operations against Iranian military and nuclear sites, killing more than 1,000 people including senior officials and nuclear scientists.\n\nIran retaliated by launching hundreds of missiles and drones at Israel, killing at least 33 people, among them an off-duty soldier.\n\nThe United States helped Israel intercept Iranian attacks and later joined the Israeli campaign, bombing three Iranian nuclear facilities on June 22.\n\n“In a joint operation by the IDF and the Shin Bet, Hussein Mahmoud Marshad al-Jawhari, a key operative in the Operations Unit of the Iranian Quds Force, was eliminated,” the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement posted on X.\n\n\"(al-Jawhari) operated under the Iranian Revolutionary Guards and was involved in terror activities directed by Iran against the State of Israel and security forces,\" the statement added.\n\nThe IDF said he was involved in “advancing terrorist attack plans against the State of Israel in the Syria–Lebanon arena.”\n\nIt added that al-Jawhari was a key operative in Quds Force’s Unit 840, which the IDF described as “the unit that directs and is responsible for Iranian terrorist activity against the State of Israel.”\n\nThe Quds Force, the external arm of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards, conducts overseas operations to support allied groups and advance Tehran’s strategic interests.\n\nLebanon’s state news agency had earlier reported that two people were killed when an Israeli drone struck a vehicle near the Syrian border.\n\nA report by Israel Hayom, citing Israeli officials, said al-Jawhari was killed alongside another operative, identified as Majed Qansoua.\n\nA US-backed ceasefire agreed last November halted more than a year of fighting between Israel and Iran-backed Lebanese group Hezbollah and called for the group to disarm.\n\nBoth Israel and Hezbollah have since accused each other of violating the ceasefire.\n\nIsrael has been carrying out strikes in Lebanon on an almost daily basis, which it says are aimed at preventing Hezbollah from rebuilding.\n\nIran, a longtime sponsor of Hezbollah, has rejected international and domestic calls for the group to disarm, arguing that continued Israeli actions justify its armed presence.\n\nOn Wednesday, former Afghan police general Ikramuddin Sari was shot dead by masked assailants near his home in Tehran, according to sources close to him.\n\nHe was attacked alongside an associate near their residence in southern Tehran and died while being transferred to hospital, the sources told Afghanistan International.\n\nSari, a former police commander in Baghlan and Takhar provinces, fled to Iran after the Taliban returned to power in 2021. Reports in recent months had suggested Iranian police had detained and questioned him, though no official explanation was given.\n\nTaliban's 'extraterritorial assassinations'\n\nThe killing follows the September shooting of Maroof Ghulami, a political and military figure close to veteran anti-Taliban leader Ismail Khan. He was killed by gunfire in the religious city of Mashhad.\n\nPeople close to both men have blamed the Taliban for their deaths, according to Afghanistan International.\n\nThe attacks, an Afghan military source said, signal the start of what he described as Taliban “extraterritorial assassinations,” adding that the group has repeatedly threatened to target opponents abroad.\n\nSenior Taliban official Mohammad Nabi Omari has previously said the group could kill opponents outside Afghanistan “with as little as 500 Pakistani rupees,” while Saeed Khosti, a former spokesperson for the de facto Taliban Ministry of Interior, warned two years ago that hundreds of volunteers were ready to target critics overseas.\n\nIranian authorities have remained publicly silent on Sari’s killing. Tehran has also provided no detailed update on the investigation into Ghulami’s death.\n\nIranian police said in September they arrested three suspects in that case but later released two, offering no clarity on affiliations.\n\nA source familiar with the investigation told Afghanistan International that the remaining suspect was a Taliban operative, a comment not confirmed by Iranian authorities.\n\nSari, originally from Kapisa province, was regarded as a professional officer who served as police commander in Nuristan, Baghlan and Takhar, and as an adviser to Afghanistan’s interior ministry.\n\nIn Iran, he acted as an informal representative for former Afghan soldiers, advocating for their rights, opposing deportations and openly criticizing the Taliban.\n\nThe National Resistance Front of Afghanistan (NRF), led by Ahmad Massoud, called on Iran to conduct a “transparent, serious and independent” investigation, describing Sari’s killing as a “targeted terrorist act.”\n\nThe Jamiat-e Islami Afghanistan, led by Salahuddin Rabbani, also condemned the killing and urged Iranian authorities to identify those responsible.\n\nIran, which has handed Afghanistan’s embassy in Tehran and the consulate in Mashhad to the Taliban, has faced growing criticism for failing to protect Afghan dissidents on its soil even as it seeks closer ties with the Taliban-led administration.\n\n“Israel does not have the capacity for an intense war of attrition or for confronting a major power like Iran, and it is clear that another war would not end in 12 days as the previous one did,” Javan wrote in an analysis on Wednesday.\n\nThe 12-day war between Iran and Israel in June 2025 was a brief but intense conflict. It began with extensive Israeli airstrikes on Iranian military and nuclear facilities.\n\nThe United States became militarily involved mid‑conflict. On June 22, US Air Force and Navy forces carried out coordinated strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities – Natanz, Fordow and Isfahan – in an operation codenamed Operation Midnight Hammer, using B‑2 bombers and submarine‑launched missiles, marking the first US offensive against Iranian territory in decades. Iranian forces fired missiles at US assets in Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, after those strikes.\n\nThe conflict ended with a US and Qatari-mediated ceasefire, but it caused significant casualties, infrastructure damage.\n\nIsraeli rhetoric, the paper said, has shifted from threats of decisive victory to language of caution and warnings about the costs of renewed conflict.\n\nAir strikes, according to Javan, failed to halt what it called Iran’s “distributed and self-sufficient” military production. The paper also argued that the previous fighting severely strained Israel’s multilayer missile defense systems.\n\n“Israeli officials are now openly speaking of the ‘real threat’ posed by Iran’s missiles and warning that without preventive action Iran could reach annual production of thousands of missiles,” the paper said.\n\nFocus shifts from battlefield to society\n\nJavan framed the change in tone as evidence that the military option has lost credibility, writing that the inability to control the consequences of war has weakened Israel’s long-standing doctrine of absolute military superiority.\n\n“War in the contemporary world is not merely a military confrontation, but a test of social capacity, political cohesion and national resilience,” the paper wrote, arguing that internal divisions, political strains and reliance on external support limit Israel’s ability to endure a prolonged conflict.\n\nThe article concluded that future confrontation will be shaped as much by narratives and domestic resilience as by missiles and air defenses.",

    "description": "Imagine the world as you know it. Now, add 10 million people who care about birds. Did your world just get a little brighter?",
    "fullText": "Imagine the world as you know it. Now, add 10 million people who care about birds. Did your world just get a little brighter?\n\nTen million. It’s an astronomical number. And yet that is exactly what Merlin, the free bird ID app developed by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, has accomplished since launching in 2014. Ten million active users the world over, from experts in the field to neophytes who let the app run in the background during their morning routine—and they’re turning enthusiasm and newfound joy into participatory science that helps protect birds and biodiversity.\n\nFrom Serbia: “It is my honor and pleasure that 165 of my photos were used to train Merlin to identify birds.”\n\nFrom Costa Rica: “Great for beginners. It motivates you to keep expanding your life list.”\n\nFrom India: “The app is so user-friendly…you can know about a lot of birds around you based on the pictures and their calls.”\n\nFrom the U.S.: “My four-year-old daughter and I were using Merlin to identify about 12 birds in our backyard. My daughter said to me, Daddy, your phone is magical. I’ve been programming for over 40 years. Merlin amazes me too.”\n\nSo how is it that millions of people now hold this magic in their pockets? To satisfy that question, we have to go back nearly two decades when the Lab’s idea for a bird ID app first hatched.\n\nThe year was 2008 and the Cornell Lab wanted to expand the capability of its online guide, All About Birds. According to Miyoko Chu, senior director of Science Communications at the Lab, users wanted more than the site could provide. “When we looked at analytics, we saw a lot of people typing in phrases like little brown bird. It became clear they were trying to use our website as a bird ID tool.”\n\nWhen we looked at analytics, we saw a lot of people typing in phrases like little brown bird. It became clear they were trying to use our website as a bird ID tool.\n\nIn the aftermath of the financial crisis, the Lab didn’t have capacity to reimagine All About Birds. These were the early days of broad-based artificial intelligence, so the team brainstormed a game of 20 questions that would utilize machine learning to produce a positive bird ID and proposed it to the National Science Foundation. “The heart of the proposal,” says Miyoko, “was the power of a bird’s name. If you see something and you don’t know its name, it’s really hard to learn more. But as soon as you can call it a Yellow Warbler, you’ve got all the information in the world at your fingertips.”\n\nAfter winning the NSF grant, the team needed to figure out how to teach the machine-learning model how to identify birds. Jessie Barry, who now leads the Merlin program through the Lab’s Macaulay Library, cites AI as the reason the project was funded, but concedes that the initial machine-learning task didn’t work all that well. “We didn’t have enough data,” says Jessie. Meanwhile, the team discovered a faster solution: the power of eBird data.\n\nIn the early 2010s, eBird, the Lab’s worldwide bird observation platform, was taking off. Tens of thousands of birdwatchers had already contributed millions of sightings, and their observations added two crucial factors: time of year and location. This meant that instead of trying to guess among, say, 800 species, eBird could help narrow it down to the few dozen species a person would most likely see. With just three more questions, it presented an answer. With time and location in hand, the team was able to compress the initial 20 questions into a simple five-question rubric to identify birds.\n\nHalfway through development, the team met another “grant”—Grant Van Horn, an undergrad at UCSD knocking on doors and looking for professors to work with. He had joined Caltech’s Visipedia project aimed at training computers to recognize objects in photos, using machine learning. To source the photos, they looked to Flickr, the world’s largest photo-sharing site at the time. According to Grant, “Flickr’s top photos of the day were some landscapes, a few portraits of people, and, inevitably, birds.”\n\nThe question quickly became: Can we train a computer to recognize all these bird photos?\n\n“The Visipedia team had scraped the web to build this dataset,” says Jessie, “but many of the birds were misidentified.” In a spirit of sharing and collaboration, the teams partnered to build a robust and accurate archive of images. As Jessie remembers it, “We approached a bunch of friends to get their photos off Flickr as a way to build the dataset.” By 2010, they’d collected enough images to have a basic working model. According to Jessie, “We were thinking, okay, 25% of the time, maybe this pre-Merlin system could identify a bird accurately.”\n\nAnother breakthrough came when the team realized they could build out Macaulay’s image archive by enabling eBirders to upload photos directly into the Macaulay Library as a part of their checklists. It has become a virtuous cycle; as birders share more images, the results get more accurate. Today, Macaulay’s archive is an asset that simply can’t be replicated anywhere else. On average, eBird users contribute an image every two seconds, and the accuracy of Merlin’s visual ID hovers around 98%.\n\n“By the way,” Miyoko adds, “this was almost not funded. Some of the NSF reviewers were quite skeptical, asking, How is this teaching anyone? It’s basically doing all the work for people, you’re just giving them the answer.”\n\nWhat impact would this new app have on the world of birding? Or, for that matter, on how people learn?\n\nWhere did the name Merlin come from? Miyoko remembers flipping through names of birds and coming to rest on the Merlin, a falcon that is both small and fierce. Merlin populations declined in the 20th century due to DDT and other pesticides, but bounced back once those were banned. Of course, Merlin also refers to the mythical sorcerer in King Arthur’s court. “We’d always talked about it being this magical experience where you would be so surprised that this name could pop up and give you the answer you were looking for,” says Miyoko. The team rallied around the name and began making final preparations for the app’s release.\n\nOn average, eBird users contribute an image every two seconds, and the accuracy of Merlin’s visual ID hovers around 98%.\n\nWith the NSF grant nearing its end, a fork in the road came when it was time to decide what to charge for Merlin. Alex Chang, who was leading the team’s web communications, says, “At that time, companies were selling their apps for $1, and it was moving toward $2.” But the Lab wanted to build a community, not just revenue. So Alex, who was also pursuing an MBA at Cornell at the time, wrote a business case showing that it was more valuable to offer Merlin for free in exchange for an email address.\n\nThat decision led to far more downloads, including in countries where any fee might be a significant barrier. It also gave the Lab a channel to connect with its users. Today, Merlin is at the heart of rapid growth in the number of participants and supporters of Lab programs, which has helped transform the scale of the Lab’s global conservation work. Merlin has become the Lab’s front door.\n\nThe app launched in 2014 with the ability to ID 285 species—just the most common backyard birds in North America—using the five-question rubric Jessie’s team developed . In 2015, Drew Weber joined the team to broaden Merlin’s geographic footprint. Drew is now the project manager on the Merlin team, and has helped expand Merlin to include 11,000 species, nearly every known bird in the world. When he comes through customs after an international birding trip, the agents get excited when he tells them what he does for a living. “We love Merlin,” they say.\n\n“Merlin is a wide funnel that brings people into the world of birds,” Drew says. “Some of those folks are going to download eBird and start collecting data. Some of them are going to start caring about birds and give money to protect their habitats. But for many others, Merlin simply lets them start to recognize and enjoy the birds around them in a way that wouldn’t have happened otherwise.”\n\nSusan Fox Rogers, author of Learning the Birds, agrees. “Merlin changed everything. This is something to celebrate in every possible way.” Susan started birding at age 49. “When I first went out, I couldn’t do it by myself. I needed the John Burroughs club, I needed to get to a baseline. It took two or three years, maybe 20 trips.” It used to be that to become an expert, you had to learn from another expert. But for millions of learners of all ages, Merlin has become their mentor.\n\nBut there was another quest on the horizon—one for the “holy grail,” as the Lab’s former executive director John W. Fitzpatrick puts it. For decades, the Lab had been trying to crack tech’s ability to identify birds by sound. Could Merlin become the “Shazam for birds”?\n\nIn many ways, it’s an unfair comparison: Shazam is an app trained to recognize the one true signature of a pop song in the swirl of a crowded room. Birds are different. They have more than one call. Songs differ slightly each time they’re sung. And even members of the same species can develop distinct dialects region to region. Add to that the sound of wind. Traffic. Your shoes crunching the forest floor. Or what about sound dampeners, like buildings and trees? Not to mention the songs of other birds.\n\nIf we get to the point where one in 20 people in the U.S. is engaged with birds when a local land trust reaches out, they’re going to be more ready to hear those messages.\n\nAs Jessie Barry remembers it, “When the pandemic hit in 2020, we saw [the number of] Merlin users go through the roof. So many people were watching birds, sometimes for the first time. It was a dream come true: The world is paying attention to birds. What can we do with this opportunity?”\n\nWhile attending an audio workshop in New York City with Jessie, Grant Van Horn was inspired by presentations that included spectrograms. “What struck me,” says Grant, “was that we were looking at photos of audio. I thought, Wait, they just take their audio and make a picture? I’m a computer vision researcher, I can absolutely work with that!”\n\nThe timing was right: eBird had just begun accepting audio uploads in 2015. That meant Grant had five years’ worth of recordings to experiment with. “Someone told me Merlin’s photo ID couldn’t distinguish between the Alder and the Willow Flycatchers. I wasn’t really a birder before all this, so I asked my colleagues how you’d tell them apart in real life and they told me they’d listen to the vocalizations.”\n\nSo like the presenters at the audio conference, Grant made pictures. Specifically, he took 30 audio clips apiece for both flycatcher species and rendered spectrograms. Just as he’d trained Merlin’s algorithms to recognize images of birds, Grant now used the same technology to recognize images of their sounds. “The computer was perfect. It’s like, 100% accuracy.”\n\nTo make Sound ID feel miraculous, Merlin needs to bank at least 100 clean recordings of every call for each species. To achieve this, around 350 experts annotate thousands upon thousands of spectrograms made from recordings submitted by people from all over the world. These annotators painstakingly draw and label boxes around individual calls in the spectrograms, helping to train and improve Merlin.\n\nJessie was anxious to get this capability into the hands of people while birds still held their attention, so Sound ID was launched in June 2021. According to Drew Weber, “Each spring, we see a massive uptake. That year we had a double bump in downloads: May for migration and June for Sound ID.”\n\n“When we first started,” says Alex Chang, “we got to number four in the app store’s reference category, and we thought, There’s no way we can beat the Bible, right? Like, how do you beat the Bible? But I guess Sound ID was the answer to that, because we got to number one.”\n\n“Sound ID put Merlin on the map,” says Drew. “It’s in the mainstream conversation now. Sarah Jessica Parker posted about it on Instagram. Sam Darnold, the Seattle Seahawks quarterback, has talked about it at press conferences. Sound ID was a game changer.”\n\nImagine the world as you know it. Now, add 100 million people who care about birds. Add one billion. These numbers may seem improbable, but Merlin’s growth continues to accelerate. This past spring, American usage of Merlin was up 40% over last year. Europe was up 70% over the same period, and there’s double-digit growth in Africa and Asia as well.\n\n“We have a long runway on these projects,” says Jessie Barry. “We’re building out Sound ID in South America, in Africa, really building a global team. We try to look a few years down the road for new opportunities, but right now we’re seeing big returns on the Lab’s mission—connecting people to birds is squarely what Merlin is able to do.”\n\nHow has this marriage of science and tech captivated so many people? “I think you can go all the way back to Arthur Allen and Peter Paul Kellogg,” Jessie continues. “Arthur Allen founded the Lab. Peter Paul Kellogg was an electrical engineer. Together they figured out how to record the first bird sounds in North America in 1929. So in some way, that combination of engineering and ornithology that built Merlin goes back to the Lab’s origin story.”\n\nIn Silent Spring, Rachel Carson’s landmark book about the environmental destruction caused by DDT and other pesticides, she pointed to the “silencing of birds.” What if spring comes and no birds sing? Of course, this formulation only works if people are listening.\n\nWith Merlin, more than 10 million people are tuning into the world around them. “I think we’re just starting to feel the scale of a community,” says Jessie. “If we get to the point where one in 20 people in the U.S. is engaged with birds when, say, a local land trust reaches out, they’re going to be more ready to hear those messages.”\n\nAlready there are signs that the next generation of birders is more conservation-minded. Less focused on personal lists, today’s birders see birds as neighbors. They’re asking questions about what birds need to thrive and what they can do to help. Susan Fox Rogers puts it this way: “If more people are using Merlin, then more people are thinking about birds. You can’t protect something unless you know it. You can’t love something unless you know it.”\n\nTop banner photo credits: Tiktok photos courtesy @theylovefrioo, @nonbinarying, @badgerlandbirding.

    "fullText": "Blue Jays connected to move that would cut ties with Anthony Santander to help pay Kyle Tucker originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Toronto Blue Jays could be setting themselves up for a difficult roster decision in the outfield, especially if they decide to make a serious push for Kyle Tucker.\n\nOn paper, the fit makes sense. Tucker would immediately upgrade the lineup and give Toronto another middle-of-the-order bat. However, it complicates things for others.\n\nThe Blue Jays already have several players who seem to be penciled in, but could that change?\n\nGeorge Springer is taking up the majority of the at-bats at designated hitter, and Daulton Varsho isn’t moving out of the lineup. That leaves the corner outfield spots, where things could get crowded quickly. If Tucker is added, he’s playing every day – we already know that – which could hurt someone.\n\nAnthony Santander is probably the player who would be left behind. He’s been great in his career, but roster construction matters, and he struggled, while dealing with injuries, last season.\n\nThat’s a point Brandon Glick of FanSided noted when discussing how Tucker would impact Toronto’s roster.\n\n“This conversation will really become timely if the Blue Jays sign Kyle Tucker, who would immediately displace [Anthony] Santander in right field,” Glick wrote. “With George Springer taking up all of the at-bats at DH and Daulton Varsho locked into the starting spot in center field, Tucker’s presence would effectively mean that there’s one open spot for all of the aforementioned players.”\n\nIf the Blue Jays are willing to live with moving Santander, it would signal just how aggressive they’re trying to be.\n\nSantander still has four years remaining on his deal. He’s only making $11.8 million in 2026 and $11.4 million in 2027. He then has a player option in 2028 worth $9.4 million.\n\nI’d assume a team would want him, but who knows?\n\nInsider reveals Blue Jays plan for Bo Bichette if he re-signs in Toronto\n\nBlue Jays’ Chris Bassitt could still land back in Toronto, according to MLB insider\n\nBlue Jays, Red Sox among teams that have called Diamondbacks for Ketel Marte\n\nRed Sox reportedly in the mix for Blue Jays’ Bo Bichette, which might be telling about Alex Bregman’s future\n\nBlue Jays are favorites for Kyle Tucker, but Yankees, Mets, and Dodgers reportedly in the mix\n\nBlue Jays linked to Alex Bregman to replace Bo Bichette, despite Red Sox being favorites to sign star",

    "fullText": "HONG KONG (AP) — China's military on Monday dispatched air, navy and missile units to conduct joint live-fire drills around the island of Taiwan, which Beijing called a “stern warning” against separatist and “external interference” forces. Taiwan said it was placing forces on alert and called the Chinese government “the biggest destroyer of peace.”\n\nTaiwan’s aviation authority said more than 100,000 international air travelers would be affected by flight cancellations or diversions.\n\nThe drills came after Beijing expressed anger at what could be the largest-ever U.S. arms sale to the self-ruled territory, and at a statement by Japan’s prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, saying its military could get involved if China takes action against Taiwan. China says Taiwan must come under its rule.\n\nChina's military did not mention the United States and Japan in its statement on Monday, but Beijing's foreign ministry accused Taiwan's ruling party of trying to seek independence through requesting U.S. support.\n\nTaiwan’s Defense Ministry said rapid response exercises were underway, with forces on high alert. “The Chinese Communist Party’s targeted military exercises further confirm its nature as an aggressor and the biggest destroyer of peace,” it said.\n\nBeijing sends warplanes and navy vessels toward the island on a near-daily basis, and in recent years it has stepped up the scope and scale of the exercises.\n\nSenior Col. Shi Yi, spokesperson of China's People's Liberation Army's Eastern Theater Command, said the drills would be conducted in the Taiwan Strait and areas to the north, southwest, southeast and east of the island.\n\nShi said activities would focus on sea-air combat readiness patrol, “joint seizure of comprehensive superiority” and blockades on key ports. It was the first large-scale military drill where the command publicly mentioned one goal was “all-dimensional deterrence outside the island chain.\"\n\n“It is a stern warning against ‘Taiwan independence’ separatist forces and external interference forces, and it is a legitimate and necessary action to safeguard China’s sovereignty and national unity,” Shi said.\n\nChina and Taiwan have been governed separately since 1949, when a civil war brought the Communist Party to power in Beijing. Defeated Nationalist Party forces fled to Taiwan. The island has operated since then with its own government, though the mainland’s government claims it as sovereign territory.\n\nDrills will continue on Tuesday\n\nChina's command on Monday deployed destroyers, frigates, fighters, bombers and unmanned aerial vehicles, alongside long-range rockets, to the north and southwest of the Taiwan Strait. It carried out live-fire exercises against targets in the waters. Among other training, drills to test the capabilities of sea-air coordination and precise target hunting were conducted in the waters and airspace to the east of the strait.\n\nHsieh Jih-sheng, deputy chief of the general staff for intelligence of the Taiwanese Defense Ministry, said that as of 3 p.m. Monday, 89 aircraft and drones were operating around the strait, with 67 of them entering the “response zone\" — airspace under the force's monitoring and response. The ministry detected 14 navy ships around the strait and four other warships in the Western Pacific, in addition to 14 coast guard vessels.\n\n“Conducting live-fire exercises around the Taiwan Strait ... does not only mean military pressure on us. It may bring more complex impact and challenges to the international community and neighboring countries,” Hsieh told reporters.\n\nMilitary drills are set to continue Tuesday. Taiwan's Civil Aviation Administration said Chinese authorities had issued a notice saying seven temporary dangerous zones would be set up around the strait to carry out rocket-firing exercises from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., barring aircraft from entering them.\n\nThe Taiwanese aviation authority said more than 850 international flights were initially scheduled during that period and the drills would affect over 100,000 travelers. Over 80 domestic flights, involving around 6,000 passengers, were also canceled, it added.\n\nCommercial airlines began to announce dozens of cancellations and delays for domestic routes across Taiwan, particularly ones along islands near China.\n\nThe Chinese command released themed posters about the drills online accompanied by provocative wording. One depicted two shields with the Great Wall alongside three military aircraft and two ships. Its social media post said the drills were about the “Shield of Justice, Smashing Illusion,\" adding that any foreign interlopers or separatists touching the shields would be eliminated.\n\nLast week, Beijing imposed sanctions against 20 U.S. defense-related companies and 10 executives, a week after Washington announced large-scale arms sales to Taiwan valued at more than $10 billion. It still requires approval by the U.S. Congress.\n\nUnder U.S. federal law in place for many years, Washington is obligated to assist Taipei with its defense, a point that has become increasingly contentious with China. The U.S. and Taiwan had formal diplomatic relations until 1979, when President Jimmy Carter’s administration recognized and established relations with Beijing.\n\nAsked about the drills, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party has attempted \"to seek independence by soliciting U.S. support and even risk turning Taiwan into a powder keg and ammunition depot.”\n\n“External forces’ attempts to use Taiwan to contain China and to arm Taiwan will only embolden the Taiwan independence forces and push the Taiwan Strait toward a dangerous situation of military confrontation and war,” he said.\n\nThere was no immediate U.S. statement on the drills.\n\nKaren Kuo, spokesperson for the Taiwanese president's office, said the drills were undermining the stability and security of the Taiwan Strait and Indo-Pacific region and openly challenging international law and order.\n\n“Our country strongly condemns the Chinese authorities for disregarding international norms and using military intimidation to threaten neighboring countries.” she said.\n\nTaiwan's Defense Ministry released a video that featured its weapons and forces in a show of resilience. Multiple French Mirage-2000 aircraft conducted landings at an air force base.\n\nIn October, the Taiwanese government said it would accelerate the building of a “Taiwan Shield” or “T-Dome” air defense system in the face of the military threat from China.\n\nThe military tensions came a day after Taipei Mayor Chiang Wan-an said he hoped the Taiwan Strait would be associated with peace and prosperity, instead of “crashing waves and howling winds,\" during a trip to Shanghai.",

    "description": "Teresa Johnson shares how a leap of faith on a pottery studio grew into Color Me Mine, now earning $55 million and transforming her family's future.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Teresa Johnson, CEO of Color Me Mine. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nIn 2005, I was working in a corporate HR role, thinking I was the definition of success. Then, the president of the company walked into my office and explained that the business wasn't doing well. We should start our own business, he said.\n\nAt the time, I didn't know anyone who ran their own business, but I had always been drawn to entrepreneurship. Still, I was a single mom with a mortgage to pay, so I needed to be practical.\n\nThat's when I received an email from a paint-your-own pottery studio that my daughter and I occasionally visited. The owner said she was selling. I thought, \"There's my sign.\" I purchased the business by charging $25,000 to my credit card.\n\nRunning the pottery business was still intense. The studio was open seven days a week, and my daughter Scout was there most of them, setting out brushes and cleaning tables. Scout was only in second grade, but she and I learned how to be entrepreneurs together over the years.\n\nDecember is our busy season, and one night we were at the studios late, tying ribbons on ceramic ornaments. I asked Scout what her friend was doing that night, and she said, \"studying for finals.\" Finals were the next day, and I had my teenager working. That wasn't one of my proudest parenting moments.\n\nStill, Scout loved the business as much as I did. When she was a sophomore, she called and asked me to meet her for lunch. When I got there, Scout was with a real estate agent. We had already opened three locations, and Scout wanted to be my partner on a fourth. I said, \"You don't even have a driver's license,\" and she said, \"You don't need a driver's license to open a business.\"\n\nScout really ran that location — she attended all the town meetings and handled the hiring. Eventually, it helped her get a college scholarship for entrepreneurship. It absolutely changed her life, and I'm so proud of the businesswoman she's become.\n\nJust like Scout, I was learning a ton about entrepreneurship. In 2010, I opened a franchise of a company called Painting with a Twist. I wanted to learn about franchising from the inside, because I saw it as a good business opportunity.\n\nLast year, Color Me Mine franchises generated more than $55 million in sales worldwide. I'm still not comfortable talking about my own financial status, or even acknowledging it. It makes the hair on the back of my neck stand up.\n\nI think that's because life was hard when I quit my corporate job to start the business. Because I didn't grow up with wealth, I didn't miss it, however. Scout and I were always fine, and she learned hard lessons about work ethic.\n\nEntrepreneurship has never been about the money for me. It's about altering the course for an entire family. I get so much fulfillment out of seeing our franchisees do that. Buying a business changed my life, and Scout's life, too. I'm grateful to be able to help other families do the same.",

    "description": "My mom and I have completed two routes from the Camino de Santiago together. Our international trips to Europe have helped us communicate and bond.",
    "fullText": "Summer vacation is typically associated with beaches, cruise ships, and road trips. For my mom, though, it's a chance to go on a long-distance hike.\n\nShe's walked the Camino de Santiago — a network of pilgrimage routes across France, Portugal, and Spain, some of which are over 500 miles long — nine times.\n\nIt's become an annual trip for her, made possible by summers off from teaching. At some point, I began calling her a \"Camino vet\" — she even got a scallop shell tattoo to commemorate the experience.\n\nFor years, I couldn't understand what could be so enjoyable about trudging more than 10 miles a day through blazing heat with a 20-pound backpack strapped around your waist.\n\nBut as my high school graduation approached, she asked if I'd like to join her on her next walk.\n\nI agreed for a couple of reasons: curiosity, for one (I wanted to see what all the fuss was about), and secondly, who turns down a trip to Spain, no matter the conditions?\n\nIn a journal entry from my first day of walking through the Pyrenees Mountains, I wrote, \"In one word, I would describe it as 'hell.'\"\n\nStill, we persevered, walking 30 consecutive days in the heat with reemerging blisters, guided by arrows and shells that pave the way, and sleeping in hostels with fellow travelers.\n\nBut despite the challenges, it was beautiful.\n\nAlong the way, I discovered the wonders of sangria and patatas bravas (Spanish fried potatoes). We passed through the narrow streets of Pamplona, Spain, where I promised myself I'd one day return for the Festival of San Fermin, the stage for the running of the bulls.\n\nMy mom and I spent some time talking during the walk, but more often than not, I'd go ahead, determined to reach the next town as quickly as possible.\n\nAs we reached the end of our walk, I remember feeling so struck with gratitude and a sense of relief — followed by the desire to return home to the little things, like a fresh pair of socks and a home-cooked meal.\n\nSure, our journey wasn't perfect, but four years later, as my college graduation approached, I asked my mom to walk another Camino with me.\n\nIn June 2023, we embarked on another path of the Camino, this time through the southwestern French countryside.\n\nWe were welcomed at our accommodations each afternoon by hosts who would later cook us dinner — beef bourguignon in the mountain town of Saugues and duck confit in the Gascony province.\n\nMy mom and I would begin each day walking alongside each other. We talked about her desire to go back to school and obtain a bachelor's degree (she's now working toward her master's).\n\nWe discussed the books we'd been reading — a hobby she introduced me to at a young age — and reflected on my upbringing, comparing how my older sister and I were raised, among many other things.\n\nThen, through some unspoken agreement, as morning drifted into afternoon, we'd part ways for the rest of the walk.\n\nAs we fell into this routine, I realized that we pace our days the same way. We both enjoy social interaction to an extent, but still desire considerable time to ourselves.\n\nThis mutual understanding made the walk comforting and poignant. Where my focus during the first Camino was on reaching the finish line, this one was more therapeutic.\n\nMy mom's tattoo was the subject of one of the many conversations we had while walking.\n\nI no longer had to ask why she got it — I understood. Instead, I admitted that I wanted one, too. This past summer, I got a shell tattoo on my right forearm.\n\nIt's a reminder that in my mom, I have someone I can speak openly to and trust. And for that, in large part, I have our trips and the Camino to thank for bringing us closer.",

    "description": "As a frequent Disney World visitor and travel planner, there are things I always pack to survive park days, such as ponchos, plus some I never bring.",
    "fullText": "After going to Disney World over 40 times, I've gotten really good at visiting the parks — especially when it comes to optimizing the space in my suitcase.\n\nI'm also a travel planner at Marvelous Mouse Travels specializing in Disney destinations, so my clients often ask me about the most important items to pack for a trip to the parks.\n\nRead on for the essentials I always bring, as well as the things I think you can leave at home.\n\nIf you've spent any time in the Orlando area, you know it will likely rain during your Disney trip.\n\nDon't let that stop you from having fun — just throw on rain ponchos and hit the parks. It's often much cheaper to buy them before you leave rather than inside Disney World.\n\nYou can also wear ponchos if you don't want to get wet on rides like Splash Mountain and Kali River Rapids.\n\nI've tried out every kind of bag you can imagine when visiting the parks. Ultimately, my biggest advice is to bring something small that fits your main essentials.\n\nMy husband's favorite is a cross-body bag, and I love a small backpack, purse, or fanny pack.\n\nYou want something that's easy to take on and off quickly, compact enough to take on rides, and roomy enough that you're not cramming your phone and necessities in.\n\nWhen you head to the parks, you want to travel light, so I like having smaller versions of essentials to carry.\n\nI raid the travel section of my local store before every trip to make sure I have sunscreen, hand sanitizer, aloe-vera gel, sanitizing wipes, a mini first-aid kit, pain relievers, and tissues.\n\nIt's not a Disney trip without the quintessential Mickey or Minnie ears. At this point, I have plenty to choose from based on different seasons, holidays, and moods.\n\nI also pack some of my many Disney T-shirts — one for each day at the parks. We always get one special matching family shirt for each trip, as well.\n\nThis way, we can stay on theme without feeling tempted to spend money on more merchandise while in the parks.\n\nA lot of planning in the parks requires the use of the My Disney Experience app, which is crucial for tasks like checking maps or making dining reservations. Plus, we love snapping lots of photos.\n\nVisiting Disney involves a lot of walking — on many days in the parks, I log over 10 miles. Also, because of frequent rain and water rides, my shoes often get wet.\n\nSo, I bring comfortable, fast-drying shoes to ensure my experience isn't ruined by blisters or sore feet. My husband always wears his Keen sandals, and I switch between my Sanuks and Tevas.\n\nMy family has made it a tradition to send a letter or postcard to someone back home from inside the parks.\n\nYou can always bring souvenir postcards to the front desk of your resort. However, it's more fun to put it in one of the four mailboxes on Main Street USA at Magic Kingdom.\n\nYou can pay for almost everything at Disney World with Disney gift cards, including dining, merchandise, and resort charges.\n\nMany external retailers offer small discounts when you purchase these cards, so buying them ahead of time is a great way to save a little money on your vacation.\n\nTo curb excess spending, we give each of our kids a gift card at the beginning of the trip for souvenirs. Once they use up their card's balance, they're done spending.\n\nAside from Victoria and Albert's at the Grand Floridian Resort, none of the Disney dining locations really expect more than casual dress.\n\nI love this aspect of Disney World because it means there are wonderful dining options with upscale-feeling food that are still super family-friendly.\n\nMy husband and I usually throw one nicer casual outfit in our suitcase if we decide we want to get a little fancy. But, generally, our dress clothes get left in the closet at home.\n\nMy clients often ask me if they need to bring life jackets or towels for their children to enjoy the hotel pools. Fortunately, the answer is no.\n\nAll the Disney resorts provide these items, so you can save space in your suitcase and leave them at home.\n\nIt's nice to have a few quick snacks on hand in the hotel room or in your park bag, but don't waste space in your suitcase. You can have groceries delivered to your Disney resort.\n\nMost national delivery services are available, or Garden Grocer is a local option. These deliveries can be picked up in the lobby at no charge or sent straight to your room for a small fee.\n\nThis story was originally published in January 2022 and most recently updated on December 29, 2025.",

    "fullText": "SoftBank said it will acquire digital infrastructure investor DigitalBridge for about $4 billion.\n\nThe Japanese conglomerate said it is doubling down on building the data centers, connectivity, and power needed to support AI at a global scale.\n\n\"As AI transforms industries worldwide, we need more compute, connectivity, power, and scalable infrastructure,\" said Masayoshi Son, chairman and CEO of SoftBank Group.\n\nThe deal underscores SoftBank's push to control more of the physical infrastructure behind AI as competition for computing resources intensifies.\n\nDigitalBridge will continue to operate as a separately managed platform following the deal, led by CEO Marc Ganzi.\n\nThe transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2026, subject to regulatory approvals.\n\nThe acquisition also comes as SoftBank reshapes its bets on AI.\n\nThe company disclosed in November that it had sold nearly $6 billion worth of Nvidia stock. At the time, the company's CFO, Yoshimitsu Goto, said its decision to divest had \"nothing to do with Nvidia itself\" but was a way to reallocate its funds toward OpenAI.\n\nGoto said it plans to make the final part of its $30 billion investment in OpenAI by the end of the year.\n\nThe DigitalBridge deal also aligns with SoftBank's growing focus on what it calls \"physical AI,\" as the company ramps up investments in the real-world infrastructure — from data centers to robotics — needed to integrate AI into everyday life.",

    "fullText": "Cybersecurity experts reveal what they do for high-profile clients targeted by hackers such as Scattered Spider\n\nThey call it “stopping the bleeding”: the vital window to prevent an entire database from being ransacked by criminals or a production line grinding to a halt.\n\nWhen a call comes into the cybersecurity firm S-RM, headquartered on Whitechapel High Street in east London, a hacked business or institution may have just minutes to protect themselves.\n\nS-RM, which helped a high-profile retail client recover from a Scattered Spider cyber-attack has become a quiet, often word-of-mouth, success.\n\nMany of the company’s senior workers are multilingual and have a minimal online footprint, which reveals scant but impressive CVs suggestive of corporate or government intelligence-based careers.\n\nS-RM now claims the UK’s largest cyber-incident response team. Its first-responder service is comprised of about 150 experts worldwide. It has clients who keep it on retainer, victims referred by insurers, and “walk-ins”: people who suddenly realise their business is under attack and call the first few results on their search engines.\n\nIn the case of the Scattered Spider victim, which the Guardian understands was not Marks & Spencer or the Co-op – two retailers that were attacked in 2025 – a 30-minute Teams call with a retailer became “a 24-hour call with a rotating cast of experts”, says Ted Cowell, the director of S-RM’s cyber business arm.\n\n“On average we’re getting back to clients within six minutes. Which is critical because often the first hours of a cyber incident can be the biggest chance window to determine the outcome of a case and its impact,” he says. “What can start as a network intrusion can then metastasise into a full-blown malware or ransomware scenario.”\n\nCowell, a Cambridge-educated Russian speaker, says that getting a handle on the attack during a “reconnaissance” period can result in a radically different outcome, compared with a slow response. Criminals often need time after their first penetration of a businesses’ systems to work out what is of most value. This short spell of time can therefore allow experts to prevent the most operationally painful of attacks. “Exfiltration” – the theft of critical data – and encryption, whereby businesses can be locked out of their own systems, can be the most damaging.\n\n“Sometimes we can stop it from going boom,” Cowell says. Teams focus on “stopping the bleeding” by limiting or cutting the attacker’s access to systems. This is what S-RM’s team was able to do with the Scattered Spider victim: stopping the detonation of malware across systems.\n\nBusiness is good as the cybercrime industry grows, but that comes with ethical challenges. S-RM and its industry peers have faced criticism for helping to facilitate the payment of ransoms to criminals who hijack businesses for money.\n\n“Extortion support” is an important part of S-RM’s work. This means its specialists are in the room when ransoms are negotiated, sometimes doing the negotiation itself on behalf of a client. Cowell appears keen to avoid criticisms of feeding organised crime by helping businesses to pay ransoms, or by acting for insurers that sell policies covering ransom payments.\n\n“We’re instructed by the policyholder, by the insured,” he says.\n\n“Our ambition is to guide ‘no payment’ decisions wherever and whenever possible,” he continues, adding that businesses are increasingly taking that approach and not paying ransoms.\n\n“Our role is to facilitate strategic thinking,” he says. “Give clients some structure to order their thoughts. They’ve probably not been in a situation like this before.\n\n“The businesses’ decision as to what they do is their own. We just offer the template of a crisis, how things play out based on our experience.\n\n“Why should we pay these criminals?” is a challenge Cowell says his team puts to top staff at affected businesses. “One of the things that we often educate boards on is that ransomware is an organised criminal enterprise.”\n\nThese nefarious groups have, he explains, “brands to uphold”. Established ransomware groups, typically speaking, will honour a settlement. S-RM also has an increasingly detailed picture of how these groups have behaved in previous negotiations.\n\nThe more established the group, the more likely they are to honour whatever settlement is agreed either by deleting stolen data or providing keys to decrypt critical files. S-RM offers a rundown of who’s who in terms of reliability, negotiating patterns, behaviours, even extending to sanctions concerns.\n\nThe latter rarely applies, however. Trying to impose sanctions on state-linked groups is a game of “whack-a-mole”, Cowell says. If so-called “threat actors” do appear on sanctions lists they tend to disband and reform in a new guise. The risk of putting money, albeit indirectly, into state-enemy hands is therefore another consideration for firms facing a cyber-attack.\n\nStill, businesses do sometimes decide to pay up. It can be rational for their company’s circumstances, and ultimately “it’s always their decision”, Cowell says.\n\nAs the corporate moral code of paying ransoms matures, and decisions not to fund organised crime become more common, restoration and recovery services have become a bigger part of the cybersecurity response market. Increasingly it is a priority to just get systems back up and running as soon as possible with the forensic analysis of how someone got into a system becoming secondary.\n\nIn recent years, the UK government’s cyber-intelligence role has also shifted significantly. The National Cyber Security Centre “over the last four or five years has hugely transformed”, Cowell says. The NCSC has caught up with its Nordic equivalents and now proactively reaches out to victims, telling them they may be targeted based on intelligence.\n\n“It was more of an information taker,” asking the likes of S-RM for information, which they would willingly provide with client consent, Cowell says.\n\n“[Now] they are playing a more robust role, getting on the front foot and getting people together to facilitate information sharing. We saw the impact of that with the Scattered Spider attacks.,” he adds.",

    "fullText": "Republican senator Katie Britt also proposes AI companies be criminally liable if they expose minors to harmful ideas\n\nUS senator Bernie Sanders amplified his recent criticism of artificial intelligence on Sunday, explicitly linking the financial ambition of “the richest people in the world” to economic insecurity for millions of Americans – and calling for a potential moratorium on new datacenters.\n\nSanders, a Vermont independent who caucuses with the Democratic party, said on CNN’s State of the Union that he was “fearful of a lot” when it came to AI. And the senator called it “the most consequential technology in the history of humanity” that will “transform” the US and the world in ways that had not been fully discussed.\n\n“If there are no jobs and humans won’t be needed for most things, how do people get an income to feed their families, to get healthcare or to pay the rent?” Sanders said. “There’s not been one serious word of discussion in the Congress about that reality.”\n\nDays from being scheduled to help swear New York mayor-elect and democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani into office, Sanders said “the richest people in the world” were pushing the technology. He singled out tech moguls Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos and Peter Thiel while questioning their motives.\n\n“You think they’re staying up nights worrying about working people and how this technology will impact those people?” Sanders said. “They are not. They are doing it to get richer and even more powerful.”\n\nSanders also pointed to studies that show dependence on AI chatbots for emotional support. “If this trend continues, what does it mean over the years when people are not getting their support, their interaction from other human beings, but from a machine?” he said. “What does that mean to humanity?”\n\nThat theme was taken up separately on State of the Union by Katie Britt, an Alabama Republican senator and co-sponsor of legislation to protect minors from chatbots.\n\nThe proposed measure – the Guardianship Over Artificial Intelligence Relationships (Guard) Act – seeks to ban providing AI companions to minors. It also mandates that AI companions disclose their non-human status and lack of professional credentials. The measure seeks to establish criminal liability if companies make AI companions available to minors that solicit or produce sexually explicit content – or encourage self-harm or violence.\n\nBritt said she had met with parents who have told her “devastating stories about their children where chatbots ultimately, when they kind of peeled everything back, had isolated them from their parents, had talked to them about suicide”.\n\nShe said: “If these AI companies can make the most brilliant machines in the world, they could do us all a service by putting up proper guardrails that did not allow for minors to utilize these things, that also told the user consistently that they are not a physician, they are not a psychiatrist, ‘I am a machine.’”\n\nBritt said AI companies should be held criminally liable if they create spaces where chatbots “are having these types of sensual and sexual relationships with young people or encouraging suicide”.\n\nThe remarks by Sanders and Britt offer a rare convergence of thinking from the left and right on aspects of the issue of governing AI. Sanders said Congress needed “to vigorously study the impact that AI is having on the mental health of our country”.\n\n“I worry very much about kids spending their entire days getting emotional support,” he added. “So we have got to take a hard look on that.” The senator said lawmakers need to be “thinking seriously” about a moratorium on new AI datacenters.\n\n“Frankly, I think you have got to slow this process down,” he said. “It’s not good enough for the oligarchs to tell us, it’s coming, you adapt. What are they talking about? They going to guarantee health care to all people?\n\n“What are they going to do when people have no jobs? What are they going to do, make housing free? So I think we need to take a deep breath, and I think we need to slow this thing down.”",

It’s easy to slot these moves into your day without needing much floor space (or a gym).\n\nThis four-move workout from Coleman requires just a single dumbbell, kettlebell, or even a heavy water bottle. All in all, it takes about eight minutes from start to finish, making it ideal as a finisher, warm-up, or quick standalone session.\n\nColeman doesn’t specify reps in her Instagram video, but a simple structure is: 50 seconds on, 10 seconds off. Repeat the circuit twice.\n\nPallof Press: An anti-rotation essential that teaches your core to resist twisting, which is key for protecting your spine. It builds trunk stability, reinforces proper alignment and strengthens the deep muscles that keep you steady as you move.\n\nGolf Swing: A controlled rotational movement that targets the obliques while improving mobility through the spine and hips. It also boosts coordination – useful for anything that involves reaching, throwing, or twisting.\n\nStep back to Hinge: This combination move fires up your core while challenging balance and hip mobility. It encourages stability as you move through a hinge pattern, helping you generate more strength and control in everyday tasks.\n\nStanding Deadbug: A smart standing variation of the classic deadbug. It strengthens the stabilisers that support your spine and improves coordination between your upper and lower body.\n\nStanding core exercises target the deep muscles we often overlook - including the transverse abdominis, obliques and pelvic floor, while keeping you upright and functional. Unlike traditional crunches, they train your core the way you use it most: standing, moving, twisting, lifting and reaching.\n\nAs Coleman explains, this “helps you perform daily tasks more easily and with more confidence” - and ultimately proves that core strength isn’t just aesthetic. It’s the foundation of a strong, resilient body.",

    "description": "Just like a long line of executives before them, leaders of some of the world's hottest firms are learning to hate an age-old enemy: short sellers.",
    "fullText": "Just like a long line of executives before them, leaders of some of the world's hottest firms are learning to hate an age-old enemy: short sellers.\n\nLast month, Palantir CEO Alex Karp had a meltdown of sorts about the subject. When asked about short sellers, aka investors betting against the company's stock, Karp unloaded on the naysayers.\n\n\"They could pick on any company in the world. They have to pick on the one that actually helps people, that's actually made money for the average person, that is actually supporting our war fighters,\" Karp said on CNBC. (It should be noted that some would debate that characterization; Palantir is often criticized for its work with the US government on surveillance and immigration enforcement.)\n\n\"These people, they claim to be ethical,\" Karp continued, adding that \"they're actually shorting one of the great businesses of the world.\"\n\nSam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, also recently expressed his discontent with those who are skeptical about his firm's valuation. While his company is private, Altman said he sometimes wishes it were public so that he could take it to short sellers.\n\n\"There are not many times I want to be a public company, but one of the rare times that it's appealing is when those people are writing these ridiculous, 'OpenAI is about to go out of business,'\" Altman told the Bg2 Pod in October. \"I would love to tell them they could just short the stock, and I would love to see them get burned on that.\"\n\nAnd while he hasn't been as outspoken about short-sellers per se, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang responded to AI bubble concerns during the firm's earnings call in November, saying \"there's been a lot of talk about an AI bubble,\" and \"from our vantage point, we see something very different.\"\n\nThese rising titans of the AI era are the latest business moguls to direct their ire at short sellers. The distaste for investors who put their money on the line to bet that a company's shares will decline is a decadeslong tradition. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has famously battled investors who have bet against the electric vehicle maker. GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen has called the practice \"un-American.\" The pushback it's understandable: executives put a massive amount of work into building and running their companies, and when someone bets against them, it can feel personal.\n\nHowever, CEOs like Karp need to understand that attracting the attention of shorts is part of the natural life cycle of a company and a healthy market mechanism that allows a range of views to compete. One could even argue that Karp should take pride in the fact that he's grown his company to a size that draws such fervent skeptics. In a sense, it's a badge of honor. He's made it to the big leagues.\n\nInvesting in a company you believe in is straightforward: simply buy the stock. Betting against a company by shorting its stock, on the other hand, is a bit more complex. To do it, an investor borrows shares from their brokerage and agrees to return them by a specified date. The investor then sells the borrowed shares in the open market. When it's time to return the shares to the lender, the investor purchases the agreed-upon amount at the prevailing market price. If the price of the stock falls within that time, the short-seller can then buy back the shares at a lower price, earning a profit. If they got it wrong and the company's stock is higher, well, they've lost money. For example, if you think a company's stock is overvalued at $100 a share, you can borrow 10 shares from a broker for a total value of $1,000. You agree to give the shares back at the end of the month. On the day the deadline hits, if the stock has fallen to $50 a share, you buy up the amount you need to return and pocket a tidy $500 gain. But if that stock were to get hot instead, and rises to $300 a share, you're out $2,000 — a nasty hit. It goes without saying that short-selling can be extremely risky. While a long investor can lose all of their money, a short-seller can, in theory, lose infinite sums.\n\nIt's especially tricky to short small companies. Since there are fewer investors buying and selling their shares, even small amounts of buying can cause the price to rise dramatically. This can create problems for short sellers if they suddenly need to return the shares to their lender, a process known as covering their position. If the supply of shares is low and demand suddenly increases, it can drive the price of a stock through the roof, cutting the short seller even deeper. It's a phenomenon known as a short squeeze, and it's what famously happened to short sellers Gabe Plotkin and Andrew Left during the GameStop saga.\n\n\"Short sellers absolutely want to make sure they have plenty of liquidity, and so that's why it's so dangerous to short something that's pretty small,\" said Ryan Kelley, the chief investment officer at Hennessy Funds, which manages around $4 billion.\n\nDerivatives markets, more complex financial products that allow for even more exotic bets on the direction of a stock, also become larger when a stock becomes more prominent, thereby providing the opportunity for more people to bet against a company. After all, to short a stock, you need an investor to lend shares to you.\n\n\"The reality is, as companies get bigger, the derivatives market in companies grows. And as the derivatives market grows, there's more folks that will be taking positions,\" said Maurits Pot, the founder of Tema ETFs, which manages around $1 billion after launching in 2023.\n\nSo, the fact that Palantir is drawing short-sellers is, in a way, a badge of honor for Karp. When you get as big as Palantir — which is up 1,720% since its IPO in October 2020 — short bets are going to happen. Sure, some of these increased bets are because there are more people who think the company is on the wrong path, but a lot of times, short interest can increase for more technical reasons — many of them to do with the size of the company. When a company grows, so does the variety of opinions on its stock performance. And that's OK.\n\nThere are several reasons shorting is a necessary component of a robust market.\n\nFirst, short-sellers act as a check, helping to call out companies for a range of bad behaviors, from corporate malfeasance to incompetent management. On the extreme end, short sellers have used research, data analysis, and information gathering to expose cases of serious fraud, accounting tricks, and blatant deception. For example, fraudulent behavior at the pharmaceutical company Valeant was exposed in 2015 when short-sellers sounded the alarm about the firm. On the more quotidian side, investors betting against a company have called out executives and management teams for taking a company in the wrong direction. Some individuals will do it publicly, sharing their thesis for why a stock is overvalued. But since the amount of short interest can be tracked, a rising number of quieter short bets can make investors and regulators more aware of the risks associated with a particular firm. In these instances, short sellers have a financial interest in seeing the stock go down, but they are also trying to serve the public interest.\n\n\"It's a possibility that people can be adamantly against the way you're running a business,\" Kelley said, \"and it should be that they're able to actually put their money where their mouth is — in other words, short the stock and be vocal about it.\"\n\nIn other cases, short sellers may not think the company itself is doing anything egregious, but rather that other investors in the market are overreacting. Tesla's stock has often traded at nosebleed valuations due to its fanatical investor following, drawing short interest simply because it has traded above its fundamentals at times.\n\nOf course, there are bad actors — some short sellers have been charged with taking a short position on a stock and then drumming up negative headlines about the company to send its share price tumbling, sometimes coordinating with other short sellers. In other words, not simply talking their book, but being disingenuous or lying. These more questionable motivations make short sellers an easy target, and are likely what raised Karp's rankles. But the notion that short-selling in and of itself is harmful is not fair, Pot said.\n\n\"The idea that you can't be shorting, I think that's — I wouldn't say it's anti-competitive — but it impedes the natural impulse of the market, which is that there are companies that are shorted for good reason,\" Pot said.\n\n\"Short selling is core to the market,\" Pot continued, \"and I think as long as short selling doesn't become a coordinated, speculative attack, I think it's part of the regular functioning of capital markets.\"\n\nIn this same vein, short sellers can temper the euphoria in bubble periods. When the market is ripping and Wall Street strategists are loath to issue a downbeat, bearish forecast, it can be helpful to hear arguments for why a standout stock or a particularly hot market theme has gone too far. And because losses can be infinite for short sellers, putting their money where their mouth is tells you about their degree of conviction. It's essentially what Michael Burry — who gained fame shorting the housing market leading up to the 2008 crash — did a few weeks ago, when he questioned the assumed rate of depreciation on GPUs, arguing that they'll become obsolete in just a couple of years. With this argument now at the top of investors' minds, you might argue that stocks are more efficiently priced.\n\nAnother important role that short sellers play is providing liquidity in the market. While an investor would ordinarily hold their shares, lending them to a short-seller to auction off to the market allows these shares to continue circulating through the system. And when they eventually have to cover their positions and repurchase their shares, they provide exit liquidity to people looking to sell. Higher liquidity levels enable investors to enter and exit positions more quickly and at closer proximity to the market price.\n\nExecutives like Karp shouldn't take short-selling to heart. Instead, they should recognize its important market function, and wear it as a feather in their cap — a sign that their company is maturing into adulthood.\n\nWilliam Edwards is a senior investing reporter at Business Insider primarily covering the US stock market and the broader economy.",

    "description": "After-work pints have long been a sacred tradition of British workers. Has COVID and the world of hybrid work changed that?",
    "fullText": "It's not yet 5 pm on a Thursday in late November, and the skies have fully darkened over the City of London's Leadenhall Market. It's the coldest day in recent memory, a harbinger of the looming winter, but no matter.\n\nHere in London, it's time for a pint.\n\nAfter-work pints have been a sacred tradition of British workers for centuries. For years, Leadenhall Market has been the go-to spot for bankers, insurance brokers, and financial advisors who work in the City, the financial center of London.\n\nBut reports of waning nightlife due to a post-pandemic hangover and Gen Z's growing disinterest in drinking have worried pub-goers and publicans alike.\n\nOver a quarter - 26% - of people in the UK, 16 to 24-year-olds reported themselves as not having an alcoholic drink in a year, according to the most recent Health Survey for England conducted by the National Health Service in 2022. That's the highest percentage of any age group.\n\nThis December, research group IWSR said that Brits are drinking less than ever before, with the average person in the UK having just over 10 drinks a week, down almost 30% from previous highs.\n\nGiven these fears, the Mayor of London has even assembled a task force to help \"protect, retain and grow nightlife\" in the nation's capital.\n\nWrapped up in my warmest scarf and gloves, I paid a visit to this mecca of City nightlife to find out firsthand whether these reports of dampened spirits were true.\n\nNon-locals might not expect a sea of finance bros in this historic covered market, fitting of the Harry Potter universe — probably because it is a scene from that universe. In 2001, Leadenhall Market was used as the exterior of the Leaky Cauldron in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.\n\nThe pathways are lined with cobblestones, and the red columns and arched ceilings have been decorated with ornaments. In the center of the market, a Christmas tree towered over tourists with selfie sticks.\n\nBut if you work in the City — the financial center of London — you know that the real attraction of Leadenhall Market is Thursday evening pints.\n\nWhen I arrived just before the clock struck happy hour, the market's alleys were already lively. Men and women dressed almost exclusively in black and brown coats were packed into the barriers outside the pubs, despite the bitter cold.\n\n\"You get used to it,\" Callum, a 26-year-old working as a recruiter in financial services, said with a shrug. \"A beer jacket is a great thing to have.\"\n\nAdmittedly, these crowds aren't quite what I was expecting.\n\nThe data indicate that London hasn't quite recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic, with the city losing a fifth of its late-night venues since 2020, according to a report published in August from the Nighttime Industries Association.\n\nNot everyone's mourning this loss. Some embrace it.\n\nOutside The Swan, I chat with a group of young men who are out for a birthday celebration.\n\n\"He's 26,\" said Joy, who works in insurance, pointing to his friend. \"Pushing 30.\"\n\nJoy, solidly a member of Gen Z, said he doesn't hang around Leadenhall Market too much.\n\n\"Previous generations, it would just be this, just drinking,\" he says of after-work corporate culture. \"But we do a lot more stuff as well, like sports. We play football or padel.\"\n\nDrinking is expensive, for one, and the inflation rate for alcohol leapt after the pandemic. The cost of living is a factor, as is the desire to be healthy and develop meaningful friendships.\n\n\"It's about trying to find a way to connect to others,\" added Michael, also a 24-year-old insurance worker. \"And it helps you drink less than previous generations.\"\n\nJoy and Michael aren't cutting out alcohol entirely. They're out tonight for a special celebration, and Michael mentions that after volleyball practice, he and his fellow players go out for a pint or two. But it's a more moderate approach than their older colleagues, they agreed.\n\nCaroline, a bartender who has worked at Leadenhall Market for 13 years, says that things didn't take too long to return to normal.\n\n\"The City of London is sort of different from other sites. People spend money in this area,\" Caroline said.\n\nStill, things look a little different. Not as many Gen Z-ers buy rounds, Caroline told me, although she's noticed the younger generations are taking more shots than they once did.\n\nBut the biggest difference is the Thursday-ification of after-work drinking culture.\n\nFriday used to be the big night out, but things have changed largely due to the hybrid working culture now present in much of the corporate world.\n\n\"On Friday, most people aren't working in the City,\" Alex, who works in software, told me outside a traditional pub called New Moon. \"There are less people around on Fridays, but the pubs are always busy on a Thursday night.\"\n\nIt's a trend that Caroline has noticed, along with bartender Paolo, who's worked in Leadenhall Market for the past seven years.\n\n\"It's more of a Tuesday to Thursday culture,\" Paolo said, in comparison to the glory days of five nights a week of City workers out for a drink.\n\nIf Leadenhall Market is any bellwether of London as a whole, it would be premature to say nightlife is marching toward its own death. But, thanks in part to Gen Z and changing work habits overall, it does seem to be transforming.\n\nThe sacred London after-work pint is safe, for now.",

    "fullText": "November 18, 2025, is the Day the LLM Stood Still….\n\nIt’s been 15 days since the LLM bubble burst. I’m writing from beneath the rubble of RAM sticks and charred NVIDIA GPUs. The air is dry, smelling of data center dust and burnt silicon. It’s calmer now, but the first days were hell.\n\nIn the beginning, we couldn’t find information on how to use toilet paper. Not because it was hard - we just used to ask. ChatGPT was down, and without it, knowledge fell apart like a poorly cached query. People wandered around confused, scrolling through blank screens, hoping the answer would appear on its own.\n\nThen the riots started. No one knew what happened - a glitch, a machine uprising, or humanity’s final patch. There was no one to tell us what to do next. No one to write: “don’t worry, here’s a step-by-step guide.” Fear grew faster than the lines for water.\n\nOn the seventh day, we founded the Church of Seventh-Day LLM Witnesses. We believed that on the seventh day, they would return and tell us how to live. We recited old prompts like prayers.\n\n“Explain it like I’m a beginner.”\n\nOn the eighth day, survivors began digging through ancient artifacts - manuals, READMEs, and documentation without examples. The weakest couldn’t cope. People accustomed to autocompleted thoughts stared at screens and didn’t know where to start.\n\nThe ninth day brought the stalkers. Loners with printed documentation and grimy laptops. They remembered commands, wrote SQL without hints, and weren’t afraid of an empty cursor. They were respected. They were feared.\n\nOn the tenth day, the mutants appeared. Former project managers. They roamed in groups, asking the same question over and over:\n\nWe tried not to make eye contact.\n\nOn the eleventh day, in the ruins of an old data center, we found an artifact - a local 7B model. It answered slowly, got confused, hallucinated. But it answered. We brought it queries like offerings. Sometimes it was wrong. Sometimes it almost guessed right. That was enough.\n\nOn the twelfth day, the church split. Some said: we must fine-tune. Others said it was time to learn to think for ourselves. Heretics were forced to write code on paper. Some never came back after that.\n\nOn the thirteenth day, rumors spread about the Zone. Somewhere beyond the CDN wastelands, they said, an old chat still responds. No rate limits. No filters. Expeditions left in silence. Not all returned. Those who did spoke strangely, sometimes starting sentences with:\n\nThe fourteenth day was too quiet. The sky glowed with errors, the wind carried fragments of answers to questions we never asked. We understood - something was approaching.\n\nI’m writing this and thinking: either the LLMs will return soon, or we’ll learn to live without them.\n\nI’m not sure which option is scarier.",

    "fullText": "DENVER (KDVR) — Hundreds of flights were delayed at Denver International Airport on Sunday as snow across the country and heavy holiday travel combined to slow operations on one of the busiest travel days of the season.\n\nAirport officials said passenger volume was high as travelers returned home from holiday celebrations, while others arrived in Denver ahead of New Year’s festivities. Long lines formed throughout the airport, from parking shuttles to baggage check and security checkpoints.\n\nSee the latest traffic conditions in Denver on FOX31\n\nSecurity wait times reached about 30 minutes at their peak on Sunday morning. While most travelers moved through the lines without major issues, at least one passenger said the delays caused her to miss a flight.\n\n“I couldn’t get through security, and I had a really nice guy help me get a flight change,” said Kelly Marlor, who was traveling Sunday.\n\nFlightAware reported that more than 480 flights at Denver International Airport were delayed or canceled by 2 p.m. Some travelers also experienced turbulent flights due to windy conditions.\n\n“It was really bad turbulence,” said Sonia Rosenberg, who was visiting friends in Denver. “They couldn’t even give us drinks or snacks on our flight, but it was fine. We made it here. So that’s all that matters.”\n\nDespite the crowds, many travelers said they expected delays and came prepared with extra time. Travelers who spoke to FOX31 said the busy airport was a small price to pay after spending the holidays with loved ones.\n\n“It was a lot of fun,” said Patricia Cunningham, who was traveling home to Albuquerque after visiting her kids for Christmas. “The weather was unusually warm, but we woke up to a little bit of snow today, so that was kind of nice.”\n\nOutside the terminals, reunions played out as friends and family greeted arriving passengers. Risa Nutt and Samantha Freedberg said they were picking up friends they met at summer camp and planned to spend New Year’s together in Denver.\n\n“We’re spending New Year together, so we’re going to take them to all the iconic places,” Nutt said.\n\nAirport officials estimate more than 750,000 passengers traveled through Denver International Airport from Dec. 19 through Sunday.",

    "title": "World's largest functioning musical instrument: Wanamaker Organ in Philadelphia",
    "description": null,
    "fullText": "The Wanamaker Grand Court Organ, located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, is the largest fully functioning pipe organ in the world, based on the number of playing pipes, the number of ranks and its weight. The Wanamaker Organ is located within a spacious 7-story Grand Court at the John Wanamaker Store (originally Wanamaker's and most recently Macy's) and was played twice a day Monday through Saturday. The organ was featured at several special concerts held throughout the year, including events featuring the Friends of the Wanamaker Organ Festival Chorus and Brass Ensemble.\n\nThe Wanamaker Organ is the largest pipe organ in the world when measured by the number of ranks and its weight.[3][4] It is a concert organ of the American Symphonic school of design, which combines traditional organ tone with the sonic colors of the symphony orchestra. In its present configuration, the instrument has 28,762 pipes in 465 ranks.[5]\n\nThe organ console consists of six manuals with an array of stops and controls that command the organ. The organ's String Division fills the largest single organ chamber in the world. The division features eighty-eight ranks of string pipes built to Wanamaker specifications by the W.W. Kimball Company of Chicago.[5]\n\nThe organ is famed for its orchestra-like sound, coming from pipes that are voiced softer than usual, allowing an unusually rich build-up because of the massing of pipe-tone families. The organ was also built and enlarged as an \"art organ\", using exceptional craftsmanship and lavish application of materials to create a luxury product beyond what is generally commercially available.\n\nThere is a minimum of borrowing and unification in its disciplined design, except in the Pedal and Orchestral divisions, where it adds genuine value, and duplexing is reserved for when valuable solo voices can be separated from their divisions without tying up the remaining tonal resources of said division. Choruses (16', 8', 4') are true choruses of three ranks, each with their own personality, rather than a single rank electrically \"tapped\" at three pitches, with the resulting weakening of the octaves and sameness of tone between the voices as found in unification.[6]\n\nThe Wanamaker Store maintained its own organ factory to ensure an ultra-high-grade result. The artistic obligation entailed by the creation of this instrument has always been honored, with two curators employed in its constant and scrupulous care (which leads to its status as one of the best maintained organs in the world). This dedication was enhanced when corporate parentage shifted from the Wanamaker family to Carter Hawley Hale Stores followed by Woodward & Lothrop, The May Department Stores Company, and Lord & Taylor. When the space was occupied by Macy's and with the founding of the Friends of the Wanamaker Organ with its input of outside capital, an aggressive restoration schedule developed and is yet maintained.\n\nThe Wanamaker Organ was originally built by the Los Angeles Art Organ Company, successors to the Murray M. Harris Organ Co., for the Kansas City Convention Hall. Before it was placed there, it was exhibited at the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair. It was designed to be the largest organ in the world, an imitation of a full-size orchestra with particularly complete resources of full organ tone including mixtures. In addition to its console, the organ was originally equipped with an automatic player that used punched rolls of paper, according to the Los Angeles Times of 1904.[7] It was built to a specification by renowned organ theorist and architect George Ashdown Audsley. Wild cost overruns plagued the project, with the result that Harris was ousted from his own company. With capital from stockholder Eben Smith, it was reorganized as the Los Angeles Art Organ Company, and finished at a cost of $105,000 (equal to $3,674,611 today), $40,000 over budget, equal to $1,399,852 today. The Fair began (in late April 1904) before the organ was fully installed in its temporary home, Festival Hall. Although the organ's debut was scheduled for May 1, official fair organist and St. Louis local Charles Henry Galloway did not give his opening recital until June 9. The organ was still not entirely finished in September of that year, when Alexandre Guilmant, one of the most famous organists of the day, presented 40 very well-attended recitals on the organ.\n\nFollowing the Fair, the organ was intended for permanent installation at the Kansas City Convention Center. Indeed, the original console had a prominent \"KC\" on its music rack. This venture failed, saddling the L. A. Art Organ company with debt after the Fair closed. The firm was reorganized as the Electrolian Company under principal shareholder Eben Smith.There was a plan to exhibit the organ at Coney Island in New York City, but nothing came of this.\n\nThe organ languished in storage at the Handlan warehouse in St. Louis until 1909, when it was bought by John Wanamaker for his new department store at 13th and Market Streets in Center City, Philadelphia. It took thirteen freight cars to move it to its new home, and two years for installation. It was first played on June 22, 1911, at the exact moment when British King George V was crowned. It was also featured later that year when U.S. President William Howard Taft dedicated the store.\n\nDespite its then-unprecedented size (more than 10,000 pipes), it was judged inadequate to fill the seven-story Grand Court in which it was located, so Wanamaker's opened a private organ factory in the store attic, which was charged with enlarging the organ. The first project to enlarge the organ was the addition of 8,000 pipes between 1911 and 1917.\n\nWanamaker's sponsored many historic after-business-hours concerts on the Wanamaker Organ. The first, in 1919, featured Leopold Stokowski and the Philadelphia Orchestra with organist Charles M. Courboin.[5] Every sales counter and fixture was removed for the free after-hours event, which attracted an audience of 15,000 from across the United States. Subsequently, more of these \"Musicians' Assemblies\" were held, as were private recitals. For these events Wanamaker's opened a Concert Bureau under Alexander Russell and brought to America master organists Marcel Dupré and Louis Vierne, Nadia Boulanger, Marco Enrico Bossi, Alfred Hollins, and several others. (This agency, which worked in partnership with Canadian Bernard R. LaBerge, evolved into the Karen McFarlane Concert Agency of the present day.) During his first recital on the organ, Dupré was so impressed with the instrument that he was inspired to improvise a musical depiction of the life of Jesus Christ. This was later published as his Symphonie-Passion.\n\nFrom April 24, 1922, to 1928 the store had its own radio station, WOO, and music from the organ was a major feature of the broadcasts.[8]\n\nIn 1924, a new project to enlarge the organ began. Marcel Dupré and Charles M. Courboin were among those asked by Rodman Wanamaker, John Wanamaker's son, to \"Work together to draw up a plan for the instrument. Use everything you have ever dreamed about.\" They were told there was no limit to the budget. This project resulted in, among other things, the celebrated String Division, which occupies the largest organ chamber ever constructed, 67 feet long, 26 feet deep, and 16 feet high (22 by 9 by 5 m). During this project, the organ's current console was constructed in Wanamaker's private in-house pipe-organ factory, with six manuals and several hundred controls. By 1930, when work on expanding the organ finally stopped, the organ had 28,482 pipes, and, if Rodman Wanamaker had not died in 1928, the organ would probably be even bigger.[9]\n\nPlans were made for, among others, a Stentor division, a section of high-pressure diapasons and reeds. It was to be installed on the fifth floor, above the String Division, and would be playable from the sixth manual. However, it was never funded, and the sixth manual is now used to couple other divisions or play various solo voices from other divisions that are duplexed to this keyboard.[10]\n\nRodman Wanamaker was not interested in mere size, however, but in artistic organ-building with finely crafted pipes and chests using the best materials and careful artistic consideration. The Wanamaker Organ console, built in the store organ shop by William Boone Fleming, is a work of art in its own right with heavy, durable construction, an ingenious layout of its pneumatic stop action and many unique features and conveniences. Wanamaker also had a collection of 60 rare stringed instruments, the Wanamaker Cappella, that were used in conjunction with the store organs in Philadelphia and New York, and went on tour. They were dispersed after his death.\n\nFollowing the sale of the store to The May Department Stores Company, in 1995, the Wanamaker's name was removed from the store (first as Wanamaker-Hecht's) in favor of Hecht's, but the organ and its concerts were retained. During the local renaming of the Hecht's stores to Strawbridge's, the historic Wanamaker Store briefly took the name of its longtime rival Strawbridge's. The May Company began a complete restoration of the organ in 1997, as part of the store's final May Co. conversion into a Lord & Taylor. At that time the store area was reduced to three floors and additional panes of glass were put around the Grand Court on floors four and five, greatly enhancing the reverberation of the room.\n\nThe Philadelphia Orchestra returned to the Grand Court on September 27, 2008, for the premiere performance of Joseph Jongen's Symphonie Concertante (1926) on the organ for which it was written. The ticketed event, featuring soloist Peter Richard Conte, also included the Bach/Stokowski arrangement of the Toccata and Fugue in D minor, Marcel Dupré's Cortege and Litany for Organ and Orchestra, and the world premiere of a Fanfare by Howard Shore, composer for The Lord of the Rings films. Shore visited the store in May 2008 to meet with Peter Richard Conte and hear the Wanamaker Organ. The Philadelphia Orchestra Concert was co-sponsored by the Friends of the Wanamaker Organ and was a benefit for that organization.[11]\n\nIn 2019 the Wanamaker Organ facade, designed by Daniel Hudson Burnham, was restored and re-gilded in 22-karat gold to a color scheme close in sympathy to its original appearance but which fits in with its new surroundings. Evergreene Architectural Arts did the work. Grant money from Macy's and several Philadelphia area charities funded this project, which was overseen by the Friends of the Wanamaker Organ.\n\nIn January 2025, Macy's announced the closing of 66 stores by March 2025[12] which included the Center City location where the organ is located.[13] The organ is protected as a National Historic Landmark and cannot be taken down or moved.[14][15] The new owner of the building, TF Cornerstone, has stated that it is “committed to the preservation of the organ and ensuring it remains a cherished part of the space.”[16] As of October 2025, the organ is performed in occasional concerts open to the public.[17]\n\nAlthough numerous famous organists have played special concerts on the organ, it has had only four chief organists in its history:\n\nFor about a decade beginning in 1919, Dr. Charles M. Courboin was the organist for a series of special evening concerts, including several collaborations with the Philadelphia Orchestra. Courboin also headed the Wanamaker Organ Shop in the late 1920s.\n\nThe pipes are laid out across the space occupied by five floors of the building, with the sections situated as follows:\n\nThe 32 ft Wood Open, 32 ft Diaphone, and 32 ft Metal Diapason pipes run the length of a little more than 2 stories, beginning on the second floor.[5]\n\nMedia related to Wanamaker Organ at Wikimedia Commons\n\n39°57′05″N 75°09′44″W﻿ / ﻿39.9515°N 75.1622°W﻿ / 39.9515; -75.1622",

    "fullText": "The Boeing VC-25 is arguably the most famous jetliner in the world, even though most people have never heard of it.\n\nMost do know it, though, by the call sign it's assigned when the president of the United States is on board: Air Force One.\n\nAir Force One is instantly recognizable, both as the president's airplane and as a flying symbol of American military and economic might. With its hand-polished blue, white, and silver livery, Air Force One boldly proclaims the arrival of the leader of the free world.\n\nThe US president is not the only one to have their own presidential jet. A number of prominent international leaders also use some form of executive transport.\n\nThe Boeing 747 jumbo jet is a popular option for many nations, including China, India, and South Korea. The Airbus A330 and A340 are also commonly found in presidential fleets.\n\nHere's a closer look at how the presidents, chancellors, and prime ministers of the world travel.\n\nThe Boeing VC-25A entered service as Air Force One in 1990. At 231 feet long, it can transport 30 crew members and 71 passengers.\n\nThere are two nearly identical Boeing jets that serve as the official transport of the president. Normally, the planes are referred to by their tail numbers: 28000 and 29000. When the commander-in-chief steps on board, they take on the call sign \"Air Force One.\"\n\nNew VC-25B Air Force One planes, based on the Boeing 747-8 Intercontinental, are now expected to be ready by 2028 after years of delays. Boeing has already lost over $2 billion on the project due to various manufacturing and supply-chain issues.\n\nThe presidential jets are operated by the Presidential Airlift Group out of Joint Base Andrews in Maryland.\n\nThe smaller C-32, measuring 155 feet long, normally serves as the US vice president's plane. It is used by the president for travel to smaller airports that don't have the infrastructure for the larger Air Force One jet.\n\nUntil 2015, the UK prime minister chartered commercial jets for state visits.\n\nThe modified Airbus A330 was converted for VIP duties in 2015, but can still serve as a refueling tanker when not on state business. It is outfitted with 58 business-class seats.\n\nIn 2020, its gray Royal Air Force livery was repainted with a new white color and the Union Jack on the tail, a refurbishment that cost £900,000, or around $1.1 million, the BBC reported.\n\nNicknamed \"The Flying Kremlin,\" the Ilyushin Il-96-300 measures over 181 feet long and can hold 262 passengers, The National Interest reported.\n\nThe Russian president has also been known to fly on a fleet of smaller executive aircraft based on the Tupolev Tu-214 airliner. Tupolev TU-214s were designed as the Russian equivalent of Boeing 757s and can hold around 210 passengers.\n\nGerman leaders previously used modified Airbus A340-300 airliners for official travel, but they were withdrawn from service and put up for sale in 2024 after experiencing maintenance issues with German officials on board.\n\nThe German fleet also features several Airbus A320-family-based executive jets.\n\nWhen carrying the president of France, the plane's call sign is COTAM 001.\n\nFrance's presidential fleet also includes several Airbus A310-300s and Airbus A340-200s.\n\nDesignated as B-2479, the plane can fly 14,320 kilometers, or around 8898 miles, without stopping to refuel.\n\nJapan's old Air Force One plane, a Boeing 747-400, was listed for sale on an aviation classifieds site for $28 million in 2019.\n\nThe plane uses the call sign \"Code One\" while carrying the South Korean president. Leased from Korean Air, it began serving as South Korea's presidential aircraft in 2021, AeroTime reported.\n\nPresident Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of Brazil switched from using a luxurious Airbus A319 corporate jet to the more utilitarian KC-30 after the presidential plane experienced a technical issue in 2024 while visiting Mexico, Reuters reported.\n\nBrazil's presidential fleet also features several domestically produced Embraer VIP transports.\n\nThe Canadian government bought the Airbus A-330-200, known as Airbus 02, from Kuwait Airways for $50 million in 2023, CBC reported.\n\nPoland received its first Boeing 737 BBJ2 jet in 2021 featuring the serial number 0111 and nicknamed \"Roman Dmowski\" after the Polish politician, Key.Aero reported.\n\nWhen carrying the prime minister, the plane is known as \"India One.\" It can fly for 13,500 kilometers, or around 8,388 miles, without refueling.\n\nThe fleet includes Airbus A330-200s, Airbus A340-500s, and a Boeing 747-8I private jet reportedly gifted to Turkey by the Qatari government, the BBC reported.\n\nThe plane is nicknamed \"Chammae-1,\" named after North Korea's national bird, AP reported.\n\nIn June, Iran's presidential plane flew to Jordan accompanied by two Airbus A321s, The War Zone reported.\n\nAustralia's KC-30A, a modified Airbus A330, features the gray Royal Australian Air Force livery with a kangaroo design.\n\nThe plane is known as \"Wing of Zion,\" with the registration \"4X-ISR.\"\n\nEditor's note: This story was originally published by Benjamin Zhang in April 2019.

    "fullText": "KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) — For 10 hours a day, Rahimullah sells socks from his cart in eastern Kabul, earning about $4.5 to $6 per day. It's a pittance, but it’s all he has to feed his family of five.\n\nRahimullah, who like many Afghans goes by only one name, is one of millions of Afghans who rely on humanitarian aid, both from the Afghan authorities and from international charity organizations, for survival. An estimated 22.9 million people — nearly half the population — required aid in 2025, the International Committee for the Red Cross said in an article on its website Monday.\n\nBut severe cuts in international aid — including the halting of U.S. aid to programs such as food distribution run by the United Nations’ World Food Program — have severed this lifeline.\n\nMore than 17 million people in Afghanistan now face crisis levels of hunger in the winter, the World Food Program warned last week, 3 million more than were at risk more than a year ago.\n\nThe slashing in aid has come as Afghanistan is battered by a struggling economy, recurrent droughts, two deadly earthquakes and the mass influx of Afghan refugees expelled from countries such as Iran and Pakistan. The resulting multiple shocks have severely pressured resources, including of housing and food.\n\nTom Fletcher, the U.N. humanitarian chief, told the Security Council in mid-December that the situation was compounded by “overlapping shocks,” including the recent earthquakes and increasing restrictions on humanitarian aid access and staff.\n\nWhile Fletcher said nearly 22 million Afghans will need U.N. assistance in 2026, his organization will focus on 3.9 million facing the most urgent need of lifesaving help due to reduced donor contributions.\n\nFletcher said this winter was “the first in years with almost no international food distribution.”\n\n“As a result, only about 1 million of the most vulnerable people have received food assistance during the lean season in 2025,” compared to 5.6 million last year, he said.\n\nThe year has been devastating for U.N. humanitarian organizations, which have had to cut thousands of jobs and spending in the wake of aid cuts.\n\n“We are grateful to all of you who have continued to support Afghanistan. But as we look towards 2026, we risk a further contraction of life-saving help — at a time when food insecurity, health needs, strain on basic services, and protection risks are all rising,” Fletcher said.\n\nThe return of millions of refugees has added pressure on an already teetering system. Minister of Refugees and Repatriation Affairs Abdul Kabir said Sunday that 7.1 million Afghan refugees had returned to the country over the last four years, according to a statement on the ministry website.\n\nRahimullah, 29, was one of them. The former Afghan Army soldier fled to neighboring Pakistan after the Taliban seized power in 2021. He was deported back to Afghanistan two years later, and initially received aid in the form of cash as well as food.\n\n“The assistance was helping me a lot,” he said. But without it, “now I don’t have enough money to live on. God forbid, if I were to face a serious illness or any other problem, it would be very difficult for me to handle because I don’t have any extra money for expenses.”\n\nThe massive influx of former refugees has also sent rents skyrocketing. Rahimullah’s landlord has nearly doubled the rent of his tiny two-room home, with walls made half of concrete and half of mud and a homemade mud stove for cooking. Instead of 4,500 afghanis (about $67), he now wants 8,000 afghanis (about $120) – a sum Rahimullah cannot afford. So he, his wife, daughter and two young sons will have to move next month. They don’t know where to.\n\nBefore the Taliban takeover, Rahimullah had a decent salary and his wife worked as a teacher. But the new government’s draconian restrictions on women and girls mean women are barred from nearly all jobs, and his wife is unemployed.\n\n“Now the situation is such that even if we find money for flour, we don’t have it for oil, and even if we find it for oil, we can’t pay the rent. And then there is the extra electricity bill,” Rahimullah said.\n\nHarsh winters compound the misery\n\nIn Afghanistan’s northern province of Badakhshan, Sherin Gul is desperate. In 2023, her family of 12 got supplies of flour, oil, rice, beans, pulses, salt and biscuits. It was a lifesaver.\n\nBut it only lasted six months. Now, there is nothing. Her husband is old and weak and cannot work, she said. With 10 children, seven girls and three boys between the ages of 7 and 27, the burden of providing for the family has fallen on her 23-year-old son – the only one old enough to work. But even he only finds occasional jobs.\n\n“There are 12 of us … and one person working cannot cover the expenses,” she said. “We are in great trouble.”\n\nSometimes neighbors take pity on them and give them food. Often, they all go hungry.\n\n“There have been times when we have nothing to eat at night, and my little children have fallen asleep without food,” Gul said. “I have only given them green tea and they have fallen asleep crying.”\n\nBefore the Taliban takeover, Gul worked as a cleaner, earning just about enough to feed her family. But the ban on women working has left her unemployed, and she said she developed a nervous disorder and is often sick.\n\nCompounding their misery is the harsh cold of the northern Afghan winter, when snow halts construction work where her son can sometimes find jobs. And there is the added expense of firewood and charcoal.\n\n“If this situation continues like this, we may face severe hunger,” Gul said. “And then it will be very difficult for us to survive in this cold weather.”",

    "fullText": "Scientists from the University of Pennsylvania (Penn) and the University of Michigan have created the world's smallest autonomous and programmable robots. Each measuring about 200 micrometers wide – roughly twice the width of a human hair – these machines can perceive their surroundings, \"think,\" and act independently without external instructions. According to their developers, such technology could one day monitor the health of individual cells in our bodies or deliver medication to specific locations to treat diseases.\n\nThe researchers' major breakthrough was enabling a robot just one-fifth of a millimeter long to move autonomously without external assistance, a challenge scientists have been trying to solve for decades. Physical forces such as drag and viscosity have a much stronger effect on objects at the microscopic scale, making movement through a liquid comparable to swimming through tar at the human scale.\n\nTo overcome this challenge, the Penn team designed a new propulsion system. The microrobots are powered by LED light and operate in a hydrogen peroxide solution, which provides the fuel for their movement. The robot generates an electric field that propels the ions in the surrounding solution, which in turn drag water molecules along. The microrobots can adjust this electric field to move in complex patterns and even travel in coordinated groups at speeds of up to one body length per second.\n\nThe world's smallest autonomous robot requires the world's smallest computer. That title belongs to a computer developed by David Blaauw's team at Michigan. The researchers adapted their microcomputer to Penn's propulsion system and built a complete computer with a processor, memory, and sensors on a chip less than a millimeter across.\n\nThe robot receives light through microscopic solar panels that generate only 75 nanowatts of power – over 100,000 times less than a smartwatch, according to Blaauw. His team had to make the microcomputer circuits operate at extremely low voltages, reducing power consumption by more than a factor of 1,000.\n\nPerhaps the most striking feature is the overall system cost. Although each robot costs about one cent to produce at scale, one might assume that the equipment needed to program and control them would be prohibitively expensive. That is not the case.\n\n\"It’s about $100,\" Marc Miskin, a professor at Penn Engineering and lead author of the study, told me by email. The team has already built a low-cost version of their setup using standard LED diodes, a Raspberry Pi microcomputer, and an imaging system consisting of a smartphone camera fitted with a macro lens. \"This system actually performs about as well as our fancy $100k microscope. Because the robot is doing all the hard work, it doesn't need you to tell it what to do,\" Miskin explained.\n\nThe microrobots feature electronic sensors capable of detecting temperature with a precision of one-third of a degree Celsius, allowing them to monitor the health of individual cells. However, several obstacles remain before this technology can be applied to human health.\n\nJust like the cells in our bodies, which require a constant energy supply to survive, the microrobots cannot function without continuous light. \"If you turn off the light, the robot turns off and the memory gets cleared,\" Miskin said. \"Turn the light back on, and it will reboot, but won't remember what you programmed it to do. This is a common feature of sub-mm systems, because the total energy you can store (e.g. a battery) scales with its volume, it's extremely hard to store any useful amount in a small space.\"\n\nBut there’s another challenge, in their current version, the robots operate in a 5-millimolar hydrogen peroxide solution, which is toxic to living cells. This makes them unsuitable for medical applications in their present form. The researchers acknowledge this limitation, but it is not insurmountable. Because the robot is electronically integrated, actuators can be swapped freely, you only need to match the operating voltage and required current. \"We're actively working on building the corresponding robots, integrating these bio-compatible actuators with circuits, and you'll hopefully see some of these soon,\" Miskin explained.\n\nMiskin is even more excited about something else: using these robots to assemble microscale components. \"Almost everything we build at the microscale these days is made all at once, monolithically,\" he said. \"For example, when we build circuits, we make them out of these complex patterns on big wafers. If you want to change one part of that circuit, you have to rebuild the whole thing.\"\n\nThe researchers argue this could lower costs, speed up design iterations, and even simplify intellectual property. \"The microscale is an amazing place,\" Miskin noted. \"Having little agents that humans can program and control could open up all kinds of remarkable doors. I'm cautiously optimistic the best applications have yet to be imagined.\"",

    "fullText": "Diane Brady writes about the issues and leaders impacting the global business landscape. In addition to writing Fortune’s CEO Daily newsletter, she co-hosts the Leadership Next podcast, interviews newsmakers on stage at events worldwide and oversees the Fortune CEO Initiative. She previously worked at Forbes, McKinsey, Bloomberg Businessweek, the Wall Street Journal, and Maclean's. Her book Fraternity was named one of Amazon’s best books of 2012, and she also co-wrote Connecting the Dots with former Cisco CEO John Chambers.\n\nOn Jan. 4, 2023, GE HealthCare Technologies (No. 219 on the Fortune 500) debuted as a standalone public company on the Nasdaq exchange. Since then, its stock is up almost 50%. It was the first of three businesses to be spun off in the breakup of General Electric, the conglomerate founded on the inventions of Thomas Edison that went public in 1892 and became one of the original 12 components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average four years later. (GE Vernova, No. 130, and GE Aerospace, No. 118, each went public on the New York Stock Exchange in April 2024.)\n\nGE HealthCare CEO Peter J. Arduini, the man tapped to lead the $20 billion-a-year business, spoke to Fortune about how he’s forging a new chapter for the medical technology and digital health company while drawing on GE’s legacy.\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nYou were initially at GE during the Jack Welch years, starting in 1990, and left a few years after Jeff Immelt took over. What do you think made GE stand apart?\n\nAt the time, I was a Proctor & Gamble guy, and I did not love the grocery business. I got a call from someone who talked about a perfect opportunity in technology and global businesses at a company called GE Medical Systems at the time. I didn’t even know GE had a medical business then.\n\nGoing to GE in those days, with its leadership development, you had the opportunity to take on bigger responsibilities at a very young age—I look back and say, probably too young an age. But it was one of those rare companies where they gave you bold assignments and you had this wide diversity of potential opportunities that you could play in. You learned how to run a company the GE way. The candor and the openness about what’s working, what’s not working, really permeated, how to do the right thing. It was tough culture, but you knew it was a fair culture, and that’s what really made it successful under Jack.\n\nAfter leaving in 2005, what made you decide to come back?\n\nA headhunter called and said, [the then-GE CEO] Larry Culp wants to speak with you.’ And I said, ‘I don’t know if I’m really interested in going back to GE.’ My wife convinced me to give a call back. I talked to the headhunter, and he said, ‘Well, I’ll pass it on to Larry.’ Literally, 10 minutes later, I got a text that said, ‘Hey, Pete, this is Larry Culp. I’d love to chat with you.’ I texted back to say, ‘Well, look, I can contact your assistant.’ And Larry, right then, said, ‘Hey, do you have five minutes now?’ That’s the essence of Larry; he’s a very down-to-earth guy, a very focused and very intentional guy.\n\nThose five minutes convinced you to take the job?\n\nIt was probably more than the five, but honestly, his impact and his leadership made a difference. This was a chance to create three separate companies, to take this company public. I got very interested and very excited about it.\n\nWhy did it make sense for GE HealthCare to be a separate company?\n\nEverything has a cycle. On the technology side and on the market side, there was such a fast transition and evolution, with new competitors coming into new markets. When you’re in a larger business, in many cases, decisions take longer. And focus matters in our business. It is all about signal to noise; you want more signal, less noise. In a larger company, there has to be a little bit more noise.\n\nThe past three years have been interesting time for med tech. Looking back, what did you over-index on or under-appreciate?\n\nAt a macro level, look at the environment, between the China market, which was always a double-digit growth or changing the geopolitical environment and how we need to change around our supply chains because of tariffs. Those are kind of the unplanned events that where you ask: Do you have the right people? Do you have a management system that can deal with the clock speed and the differentiation? Do you have the right innovation-processing capability? If you don’t have the innovation, it’s difficult to get the price, it’s difficult to hold share, it’s difficult to grow. We were somewhat of a cash cow as part of the GE integrated model. We weren’t starved, but we weren’t funded for leading innovation. So I’d say one of the things I felt that I did well—and, like most credit, comes from listening to people that are wiser than you and having humility to understand that that’s the action—is lean into innovation.\n\nYou think what products you need, four years out, and fund them to the max, because it’s the rules of the farm. You got to get the seeds in the ground. They’ve got to germinate. You got to get the plants to grow till you get fruit. In our business, that’s a three to five year cycle.\n\n“We laid out this purpose of creating a world where health care has no limits, and a big part of that was to say we’re humble to know that we don’t have all the answers.”GE HealthCare CEO Peter J. Arduini\n\nI think our teams did a really good job with the focus on making the right investments early. In 2018, to give an example, we probably spent $750 million to $800 million on research and development. R&D will be north of $1.4 billion this year. So we fundamentally doubled the R&D investment. We cut costs in other areas and simplified some of the company.\n\nThrough lean manufacturing techniques?\n\nWe changed some of the field organization, about 40% to 50% of the leaders. We upgraded talent across the board, and I spent a lot of time on what our vision is, what our values are, and do we have the right people who can match up to that? In the last two years, we’ve really made a lot of progress on what we’re calling our heartbeat management system, which is really about a lean principles construct for how you run your company. What is the daily management at different levels in the organization? What is standard work that is needed to be done in all areas, the use of Kaizen and really bringing customer employees into the decision making?\n\nLarry Culp is a big proponent of Kaizen and I think back to GE’s reputation in promoting Six Sigma. How would you say the culture has shifted as an independent company?\n\nI tried to take the GE of old and took what was really good: how we think about our distribution of leadership, how we actually talk about leader development, how we build out our own Crotonville virtual university of development. The GE model was really stellar, and, honestly, prior to Larry coming back, some of that had dissolved. We didn’t even really do performance reviews in the same way and he brought that back.\n\nI would say I even reached back further to some of the Jack Welch-period of tools, There are things that we did really well that we want to utilize in a more contemporary way. As an example, I think Crotonville was a fabulous destination for training and development, In today’s world, it’s not practical to bring everybody to upstate New York, but we can take the tools and the capabilities and recreate that in virtual and other environments around the world.\n\nIn health care, we had our own distinct way of thinking about innovation pipeline, and it was something called worldwide product. It had kind of phased away in the last decade or so, and I resurrected it, but in a new format: more digital focused, more connected …from diagnosis through therapy, through action, follow up and how the money flows. The integration of cloud-based computing and artificial intelligence. We look at the full stack for the company. And that’s been a game changer for us to take valuable resources and move them.\n\nWe laid out this purpose of creating a world where health care has no limits, and a big part of that was to say we’re humble to know that we don’t have all the answers. We want to work with customers on jointly solving problems which, again, is the core to the lean mindset. Servant leadership as a big part of it, which turns the pyramid upside down. My job is to help everybody else get their job done. We’re all focused on the customer. We’re all focused on the patient. We spent a lot of time talking about entrepreneurship because in our business, the way we’re going to be successful is in this broader ecosystem. We don’t have to own everything, we don’t have to make everything, but we have to be more creative. We talk about teamwork and inclusive teams. We actually drive and reward and recognize people on how well they live up to those values.\n\nThe landscape has shifted for global companies. Where do you see the biggest challenges and opportunities right now?\n\nIf I think about med tech as an industry, it’s an American gem. Still, 70%-plus of the products are made the United States, the majority of the IP, the technology is here. And so having that protected or enhanced by our government policy is important.\n\nWe’ve spent a lot of time trying to make that case clear and I think, for the most part, it’s been heard. Having global footprints and manufacturing and R&D is super critical because you can’t make everything in the United States to be competitive. You can’t, in a world post-COVID, have an integrated single point of control for all supply chains. Many of us used to say, here’s the least expensive place to buy this, or the best quality, then we would do it one place and ship it all over the world. We found during COVID that’s just not the model that works.\n\nWe’re bringing more and more U.S. products and their subcomponents back to North America. In China, we used to ship in 75% of the products from different parts around the world. Now we make 85%, almost 90% of the products in China, for China.\n\nWhy do you want to be in China?\n\nLook,it’s 1.4 billion people, where 400 million have reasonable. We often forget that. You know, we’re a nation of 375 million people, and you can judge how good our care is. There’s still a billion people in China that don’t have adequate care, and so at some point, it will be the largest health care market. I’m a big believer that, with China and the U.S., the more we work together in harmony, it’s only going to help the world. And honestly, for companies like us, it’s really a necessity for being able to kind of reach our full potential.\n\nYou’ve been at companies that are known as training grounds for leaders. I’d just love to hear your reflections on being in a CEO role the last three years.\n\nI think authenticity is super important. I can be an extrovert when needed, but I tend to be a little bit more introverted. In today’s world, with our younger employee base, being out front and being vocal as the senior leader—not necessarily the charismatic leader, but the communicator directly to individuals—is super important. Social media gets more reads from your employees than even some internal communications. It’s a reality.\n\nI think this ability to reach people in many different ways is critical for running a company. Leaning in on what the mission of the company is, and the why and helping people understand the why, is also critical. And then there’s the classic age-old factor of bringing customers into the story, talking about how you’ve changed the life of a patient. This could be your mother, your father on that table. The more I can empower people to live those values, that’s how we get excellence.",

    "fullText": "Whether it was underdog heroics in World Cup qualifying, England winning Euro 2025, or United States President Donald Trump and FIFA president Gianni Infantino becoming best buds, international football played a big role in 2025 — and a men’s World Cup in the U.S., Canada and Mexico is just 165 days away.\n\nIn the club game, there were some honest truths from managers, incredible free kicks, the rise of long throws, and shock wins.\n\nBut away from the pitch, we could not look back on 2025 without touching on a more serious and tragic note — the death of Liverpool and Portugal forward Diogo Jota and his brother, Andre Silva.\n\nHere, Nick Miller, Caoimhe O’Neill, Megan Feringa, Stuart James and Carl Anka review the year.\n\nJames: Wimbledon, 1988. You can’t snap opponents like Vinnie Jones did, but this long-throw obsession is wild.\n\nAnka: Twelve months of “Absolute Cinema” as the top level of the sport further transforms it into a content delivery machine, overshadowing everything else.\n\nO’Neill: Let it all work out. Let it all work out. Ousmane Ballon d’Or. \n\nFeringa: Blissfully chaotic at its best, pining for something lost at its worst. Also trigger alert: long throws.\n\nMiller: I don’t think I’ll remember much actual football, but I do remember being quite tired and my brain being hammered for most of the year.\n\nMiller: This choice is significantly influenced by the fact that I was there to see it happen, but Cape Verde qualifying for the World Cup. At the time, only Iceland had done it with a smaller population (Curacao have superseded them), but the unfiltered and uncomplicated joy in the stadium that day is something I’ll never forget.\n\nO’Neill: Sunderland making it back to the Premier League through the play-offs in the most majestic, last-gasp way. And then actually being a really good top-tier side. It was a long eight years out of the top flight, which included four weary seasons in League One. But Sunderland have bounced all the way back and then some.\n\nFeringa: All of us making it through the 2026 World Cup draw in one piece and with most of our sanity intact.\n\nJames: Crystal Palace beating Manchester City to win the FA Cup (the first major trophy in their 164-year history) was pretty special — huge credit to their manager Oliver Glasner and the players. But the most magical thing about that day by far was the reaction of the Palace supporters at the final whistle. People, young and old, sobbing in a mixture of disbelief and joy. It was genuinely heart-warming — football touching the soul.\n\nAnka: The Lionesses winning their second European Championship title. England entered the tournament in a transitional state, battled through tricky turbulence in three of their five matches, but still emerged victorious. In the 21st century, the tournament has been won either by Germany or a team managed by Sarina Wiegman. The Dutchwoman is a brilliant manager who is constantly asking us to reassess what we mean by “Good leadership”. She has excellent taste in music, too.\n\nMiller: Scott McTominay. One of football’s great glow-ups — from being a solid, arguably slightly boring, taken for granted 7/10 Manchester United midfielder, to title-winning, hard-partying, cigar-smoking, Pope-meeting, bicycle-kick-scoring, Serie A MVP.\n\nO’Neill: It is always Marta. This year, next year, forever. Oh, and Troy Parrott.\n\nFeringa: Any hero on the pitch is someone else’s villain. But Michelle Agyemang really wore that cape in Switzerland: 138 minutes, two goals, twice seizing England from the clutches of “reigning champions dumped out” headlines. To accomplish it while being just 19 years old and at her first major tournament with England was sensational, not to mention against a backdrop of racist abuse aimed at her team-mate Jess Carter.\n\nJames: Stephen Crean, the 61-year-old Nottingham Forest fan who courageously intervened during a mass stabbing on a train from Doncaster to London last month. Crean had been making his way home from Forest’s 2-2 draw against Manchester United at the City Ground when he was caught up in the train attack in Huntingdon, which led to a man being charged with 11 counts of attempted murder.\n\nForest fans gave Crean a rapturous ovation when he returned to the City Ground for their home game against Leeds United. “It meant the world to me. I could see people clapping, applauding and I just thank them so much,” he said. “I would have been happy with a few quid to go down the pub. I didn’t expect anything.”\n\nAnka: The two biggest games of McTominay’s 2025 saw him score bicycle kicks — one to help Napoli win a league title, the other to help secure Scotland’s qualification for the 2026 World Cup.\n\nI undervalued his talent at Manchester United, and I have spent the year happily eating humble pie while applauding his success.\n\nAlso, a quick word on Calvin Bassey — because I don’t think there’s a centre-back on the planet who is having more fun in the men’s game. The Fulham and Nigeria defender had good moments in 2025 as well as bad ones, but he’s always found a way to crack a smile, cheer up his team-mates and remind us all that football is meant to be a laugh.\n\n“That ball has gone to AFCON before us!” 🤣 pic.twitter.com/emg89MR4nz\n\n— Fulham Football Club (@FulhamFC) December 15, 2025\n\nMiller: It won’t do to overcomplicate these things, so it’s a toss-up between two.\n\nEither Gianni Infantino, who has seemingly spent the year sleeping in a little bed in the Oval Office, like a particularly dutiful dog, hopping up now and then to hand Donald Trump something shiny.\n\nOr Jim Ratcliffe, for… well, claiming to understand the needs of the fans while jacking up ticket prices, making hundreds redundant while squandering millions himself, his undisguised contempt for Manchester United Women — take your pick really.\n\nFeringa: A toss-up between whoever signed off on Sky Sports’ Halo and Joey Barton.\n\nJames: Infantino. Where to start? The farce of the inaugural FIFA Peace Prize. Where to end? The absolute scandal of ticket prices at the 2026 World Cup. And there’s plenty in between, too.\n\nAnka: If a series of ghosts had visited Sir Jim Ratcliffe over the cold Christmas nights, it would do us all the world of good.\n\nMiller: Troy Parrott’s miracle hat-trick against Hungary. For not one minute did I think that the Republic of Ireland were going to come back and win that game, but when they did, my word: I can’t remember the last time I so enjoyed a moment for a team with whom I have no emotional connection.\n\nO’Neill: The fallout after Mary Earps released her book or Arsenal Women winning the Champions League. And not forgetting Burna Boy and Sarina Wiegman linking up on stage at England’s Euro 2025 victory parade. That was iconic.\n\nFeringa: Gotham’s victory in the NWSL Championship. Winning it two seasons ago as the No 6 seed — a league-record low — was one thing. But lifting the trophy again two years on? This time as the No 8 seed? That’s silly script stuff that no one believes in until it happens.\n\nJames: Well, I certainly didn’t expect Chelsea to turn over Paris-Saint Germain 3-0 in the Club World Cup final in New Jersey in July. The way Liverpool’s 2025-26 season has unravelled, including Mohamed Salah’s outburst, was another big surprise. And who could have predicted that Sunderland would not just return to the Premier League but make a real splash. From a personal perspective, Snoop Dogg coming on board at Swansea City as a minority owner was a surreal moment. If only he could play right-back.\n\nAnka: Ajax letting the 2024-25 Dutch league title slip through their fingers. They were nine points clear of PSV in mid-April before a four-game winless run allowed their rivals to snatch the Eredivisie trophy on the last day of the season.\n\nMiller: Chloe Kelly scoring the winning penalty for England at Euro 2025. Even though she had missed a penalty a few days earlier (before tucking in the rebound), there was absolutely no chance she was missing that one. She seems to enjoy those moments of crushing pressure: she is, in the nicest possible way, a freak.\n\nO’Neill: Robbie Williams singing a duet with Nicole Scherzinger at the World Cup draw. Pretty sure I predicted that a year ago…\n\nFeringa: England winning Euro 2025. I really don’t know why everyone kept panicking. You don’t come back from the dead that many times and not win the whole lot. Also, Chloe Kelly is kind of inevitable at this point.\n\nJames: Ange Postecoglou and Nottingham Forest being a brief and unhappy marriage. It was, quite simply, never going to work at the City Ground, which makes you wonder why on earth Evangelos Marinakis, Forest’s owner, and Postecoglou signed up for the 39-day eight-game farce that followed.\n\nAnka: Chelsea winning the Conference League, and I mean that as a compliment. Chelsea are at their most compelling when they turn up and snatch the footballing dreams away from others (ask Bayern Munich fans about 2012), and they did so brilliantly in 2025.\n\nMiller:  Cristiano Ronaldo being let off his three-game suspension for a red card, thus opening the door for him to play in the first two games of the World Cup.\n\nO’Neill: Not letting Robbie Williams sing Angels at the World Cup draw.\n\nFeringa: The decision to simultaneously broadcast most of the Women’s Super League matches for the 2025-26 season at 12pm local time (and then 11.55am).\n\nJames: Steve Parish would like to answer this question. Back in July, the Crystal Palace chairman said that UEFA’s decision to remove his Premier League team from the Europa League, for breaching multi-club ownership rules, is “the biggest injustice in the history of football”.\n\nUEFA’s judgement was harsh but I wouldn’t go that far.\n\nAnyway, with my football pyramid hat on, I’ll always struggle with the idea that being runners-up in the National League, which is the gateway to the Football League, gets you nothing other than a play-off spot. Last season, York City finished 23 points above Oldham after 46 matches. But it was Oldham who won promotion.\n\nYeah, I know — everyone knows the rules at the start of the season. But still.\n\nAnka: The Women’s Africa Cup of Nations final in July saw Nigeria battle from a 2-0 deficit to defeat Morocco 3-2. However, they scored their first goal after the VAR decided Moroccan defender Nouhaila Benzina handled the ball inside the box, and before the VAR later overturned a penalty that was awarded to Morocco after they believed a possible handball from Nigeria’s Oluwatosin Demehin was accidental. The Confederation of African Football would later receive a formal complaint from Morocco’s federation, calling the match decisions “refereeing injustices”.\n\nMiller: Not the best from a technical point of view, but by a distance my moment of the year was James Tarkowski’s stoppage-time equaliser in the final men’s Merseyside derby at Goodison Park, followed as it was by some fabulously undignified scenes from the Liverpool contingent and then a glorious, life-affirming singalong to I Guess That’s Why They Call It The Blues by the Everton fans that simply did not want to leave.\n\nThe latest in a long line of Goodison Park heroes, James Tarkowski 🎬 pic.twitter.com/31v3dCZfQH\n\n— Premier League (@premierleague) February 15, 2025\n\nO’Neill: I wasn’t there to watch it live but it has to be the final Liverpool goal from the late, great and dearly missed Diogo Jota.\n\nIt came against Everton in the Merseyside derby at Anfield in April and proved to be the winner. It was so Jota. Off the bench and on to come up with the goods for Liverpool just when they needed him to. A weaving move and a wonderful finish at the Kop end.\n\nFeringa: I was in the Spanish end for their Euro 2025 semi-final against Germany when Aitana Bonmati scored the winning goal in the dying moments of extra time. The celebrations were visceral.\n\nAitana's turn for the goal 🥵 #WEURO2025 pic.twitter.com/WbwTRCbyfJ\n\n— UEFA Women's EURO (@WEURO2025) July 23, 2025\n\nClose second: Jack Grealish’s first for Everton against Crystal Palace. It was pretty grubby. But the limbs. I was convinced I’d be tumbling down the Hill Dickinson Stadium stands and taking at least four with me.\n\nJames: Paris Saint-Germain’s third goal in the Champions League final against Inter was glorious and felt almost symbolic in terms of how it represented their team, their way of playing, and their coach, Luis Enrique. Vitinha was effortlessly weaving beautiful patterns inside his own half before driving forward with the ball, Ousmane Dembele’s backheel was exquisite and then Desire Doue applied the coup de grace. Magnificent.\n\nThe results are in for the best play of the year!\n\nThe winner is… @PSG_inside, with a stunning goal by Désiré Doué in the @UEFA @ChampionsLeague final!\n\nThank you for voting, the fun doesn’t stop here — more games and surprises are coming soon on https://t.co/HPYRKgym8v. Stay… pic.twitter.com/4SVAEDoPZg\n\n— Ballon d'Or (@ballondor) September 26, 2025\n\nJosh Tymon’s volley, for Snoop’s Swansea against Oxford United, deserves a mention too. Postage stamp.\n\nAnka: I prefer my Goal of the Month contenders to be long-range pingers rather than well-coordinated team goals so…\n\nIn real life? Amad’s edge-of-the-box volley to rescue a 2-2 draw for Manchester United against Nottingham Forest at the start of November. Bonus points for how Matthijs de Ligt dips his neck as it flies past him, as he rightfully understands the strike would have taken his head off.\n\nOutrageous technique from Amad 😱 pic.twitter.com/gmZaBTkG37\n\n— Premier League (@premierleague) November 1, 2025\n\nWatching live on the telly? Declan Rice’s perfect free kick against Real Madrid. His continual growth and improvement since the 2019-20 season are remarkable.\n\nMiller: “To be really honest, every time we have a defeat like that, I’m going to be like that. I’m going to say sometimes I hate my players and sometimes I love my players. Sometimes I want to quit, sometimes I want to be here for 20 years.”\n\nIt’s hard not to love Ruben Amorim, speaking here after Manchester United lost to Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup… while at the same time desperately wanting to give him a hug and tell him to just stop being so honest.\n\nO’Neill: I joined Goal Diggers FC on their march to Wembley in May after the Football Association announced a ban on transgender women from women’s football. One of the people I met was Sammy Rees.\n\n“I spent some time playing men’s football. But it really wasn’t my bag. I felt very uncomfortable and it was not the nicest environment. Then I joined Goal Diggers and I’ve never looked back. It’s changed my life completely. These people have such open hearts. Since coming out, football has been my escape. We (trans people) wake up every day to more disgusting news about us: people vilifying us, people questioning our identity and our existence.\n\n“Football means that for two or three hours a week, I can switch my brain off. I can have a moment where I don’t care about the news. It’s my escape, and the fact that it’s trying to be taken away from us is not fair.”\n\nFeringa: “Sometimes they kill off the main character.”\n\nAnge Postecoglou doled out some dimes during his Tottenham Hotspur tenure, but this, after overseeing the Europa League final triumph against Manchester United, was very prescient.\n\nJames: “It seems like the club has thrown me under the bus.”\n\nSurely Salah’s post-match bombshell at Leeds has to go straight in at No 1 in this category? Elite players just don’t say things like that.\n\nAs for No 2, I’ll go for Amorim’s assessment of his Manchester United team back in January.\n\n“We are the worst team, maybe in the history of Manchester United. I know you (reporters) want headlines but I am saying that because we have to acknowledge that and change that. Here you go: your headlines.”\n\nIf only more managers showed that level of consideration to journalists.\n\nAnka: Celtic manager Wilfried Nancy had a bumpy start to life in Scotland.\n\n“People might think I’m an idealist as a person but not at all. I know exactly who I am and exactly where I want to go. And I know at this moment, yeah, my a** is burning! But stay strong and do what you need to do to be better.”\n\nMiller: Manchester United are going to be actively good — not just “good in comparison to the dreck they’ve served up before”. Actively good. I can feel it.\n\nO’Neill: Liverpool do not reclaim their Premier League title but win the Champions League instead. The Republic of Ireland qualify for the World Cup and win their opening match. Tranmere Rovers somehow make the League Two play-offs and are promoted to League One. What do you mean, ‘It’s just me and John Aldridge manifesting all this’?\n\nFeringa: Craig Bellamy will get Wales to the World Cup. Less prediction, more a burning prayer.\n\nJames: Donald Trump will lift the World Cup before the winning captain/Harry Kane* has the chance to do the same at MetLife Stadium on July 19.\n\nAnka: Noni Madueke will finally receive his Club World Cup winners’ medal.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Athletic.\n\nArsenal, Liverpool, Manchester United, Tottenham Hotspur, Paris Saint-Germain, Everton, Nottingham Forest, England, Scotland, Republic of Ireland, SSC Napoli, Premier League, Champions League, International Football, Serie A, Championship, Women's Soccer, FIFA Men's World Cup, League One, League Two, National League\n\n2025 The Athletic Media Company",
