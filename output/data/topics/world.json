    "fullText": "Brooks Koepka is the story in the world of golf right now, with the American set to make his return to the PGA Tour on Thursday.\n\nIt was only two weeks ago when Koepka was reinstated as a PGA Tour member, after he moved on from LIV Golf on December 23rd.\n\nThe five-time major champion is the first player to jump ship from LIV and return immediately to the PGA Tour.\n\nKoepka managed to win a major during his time with LIV but in general, his form at the four biggest events in the game was nowhere near good enough.\n\nThe highlight of that stretch came at Augusta National, where he finished second in the Masters. Still, it’s a long way back from that peak.\n\nPGA Tour boss Jay Monahan welcomed him back ahead of this week’s start at Torrey Pines. “We are excited for Brooks’ return,” Monahan said. “I know he wants to be here.”\n\nKoepka has never been one to shy away from giving an honest answer. So when the 35-year-old was asked if there’s anything he misses about LIV Golf, his response felt genuine.\n\n“I think maybe just being around the guys, right, because we’re not — everybody’s not around each other all the time,” Koepka said.\n\n“I think sometimes, I mean we were all one big traveling circus, right? That’s kind of what it is. It’s fun and I’m going to miss some of those guys, seeing those guys pretty much week to week out there. The relationships I’ve built with those guys and not seeing them all the time, that will be quite different.”\n\nNow back on the PGA Tour, Koepka will have a chance to reconnect with familiar faces and get to know some of the newer names making their mark in the sport.\n\nDuring his media availability on Tuesday, Koepka was asked what he missed most about the PGA Tour while playing for LIV Golf.\n\n“That’s a good question. I think the ability to have my family out all the time. I think that was one thing because they didn’t travel too much over the last few years.”\n\n“But like they’re going to be out this week, so I am super excited to be able to have them out.“\n\nThe transition back to regular life on the PGA Tour should help with that. It also puts him back in front of some of golf’s toughest competition, something he also seemed to miss during his time with LIV.\n\nThe question now is whether Koepka can still measure up against golf’s elite after his time away. The Farmers Insurance Open this week will give us an early look at how well he adapts back into the fold and whether he can hit the ground running.",

    "fullText": "If you’ve ever complained that the U.S. treats the World Baseball Classic like extended spring training, congratulations: Team USA appears to have heard you. The early commitments for 2026 look like a cheat code – power, speed, and (finally) pitching that isn’t just guys who answered the phone.\n\nStart with the face of the team: Aaron Judge isn’t just participating – he’s Team USA’s captain. And that’s not a ceremonial title, it’s a signal that this run is serious. Mark DeRosa is back as manager, and MLB’s Michael Hill is the GM, plus the coaching staff has legit teeth – Skip Schumaker, Andy Pettitte, Matt Holliday, David Ross, and more.\n\nThe bats are obnoxious, in the best way, of course. Judge is joined by Bryce Harper at first base, Bobby Witt Jr. and Gunnar Henderson up the middle, Alex Bregman on the dirt, plus Will Smith behind the plate, and Kyle Schwarber (DH) to launch nukes. Toss in Corbin Carroll’s rocket wheels, Byron Buxton’s ceiling, and Pete Crow-Armstrong’s glove-and-guts energy, and this lineup can win pretty, win ugly, and win loud.\n\nNow the scary part: pitching. Team USA already has Paul Skenes and Tarik Skubal, and MLB.com points out that means the U.S. can roll out both 2025 Cy Young winners. Add Logan Webb for innings and steady, Clayton Kershaw for the big-game aura, and Mason Miller for 101-mph late-inning violence, and you’ve got a staff that looks built to dominate.\n\nAnd yes, the road map helps. Pool B is in Houston at Daikin Park (Brazil, Great Britain, Mexico, Italy), quarterfinals are back in Houston, and the semifinals and final are in Miami. Translation: Team USA gets a home-field runway – if it handles business early.\n\nWhy the urgency? Because the U.S. won the Classic in 2017, it then had to settle for silver in 2023. This roster is built to win it all again, and it’s doing it the right way: depth, velocity, and star power.\n\nIs it already the best Team USA WBC roster ever? Absolutely. And the most dangerous part is what’s still possible: final rosters aren’t even out yet – meaning the best ever conversation isn’t just smoke.\n\n— Enjoy free coverage of the top news & trending stories on The Big Lead —\n\nNFL: Super Bowl LX odds: Opening line for Patriots, Seahawks revealed\n\nNBA: NBA Power Rankings, 30 teams ranked from worst to first\n\nNHL: NHL Power Rankings, 32 teams ranked from worst to first\n\nSPORTS MEDIA: NFL’s crazy preseason Super Bowl 60 graphic resurfaces\n\nWWE: WWE Power Rankings ahead of Royal Rumble\n\nThe post Team USA’s 2026 WBC roster could be the best baseball team ever  appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "title": "As we breach 1.5°C, we must replace temperature limits with clean-energy targets",
    "description": "Actionable goals are needed to guide the world towards what needs to happen most quickly: shifting economies to clean energy sources.",
    "fullText": "On 28 October 2025, United Nations secretary-general António Guterres acknowledged that the totemic goal of the Paris climate agreement is going to be missed: “The truth is that we have failed to avoid an overshooting above 1.5 °C in the next few years”1.\n\nGuterres was merely stating the obvious. In 2024, Earth’s global mean surface temperature averaged 1.55 °C above pre-industrial levels2, and the average for 2023–25 is 1.48 °C, perilously close to the limit. Keeping to the Paris target now looks impossible by any realistic measure. Yet this moment should not invite despair. Instead, it demands an urgent reframing of how climate progress is measured and mobilized.\n\nThe world today looks very different from that in 2015 when the Paris goal was framed. Although emissions are still rising and global actions on climate change are slow, a lot of progress has been made. Clean energy is expanding rapidly and decarbonization, not fossil fuels, is the new ‘business as usual’. In the first three quarters of 2025, growth in clean electricity generation outpaced that in energy demand for the first time, implying that fossil fuels are being displaced (see go.nature.com/3jvqzcb).\n\nWe argue that the main focus of climate action in 2026 and beyond should be on accelerating the clean-energy revolution. And the rate at which clean energy displaces fossil fuels in the global economy should become the key measure of climate progress. Here we describe how such progress can be tracked and incentivized using a metric we call the clean-energy shift. Unlike chasing intangible temperature targets, cleaning up the energy sector is a more-focused battle that the world can win.\n\nTo move forwards, climate scientists and policymakers must first accept that the Paris 1.5 °C target has outlived its usefulness. Although initially valuable as a unifying focus for international efforts to increase mitigation, continuing to emphasize a failed temperature target might produce more harm than good.\n\nOne reason is the difficulty of determining when and whether the world has crossed the line. Forecasts suggest that Earth is likely to exceed the 1.5 °C threshold around 2028, for instance (see go.nature.com/4pf95x6). But in the terminology of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), “exceedance” of 1.5 °C refers to the midpoint of a 20-year period at that level3. Confirmation would therefore not come until a decade after the fact.\n\nSuch a target, requiring years of expert interpretation to assess, could never have great salience for decision makers. And it challenges public understanding because, by definition, no person experiences global average temperatures. Moving to a higher number when 1.5 °C is crossed, such as 1.6 °C or 1.7 °C, would only make climate target setting seem arbitrary and unrooted in scientific evidence.\n\nMore concerningly, the emphasis on keeping Earth’s temperature below 1.5 °C might serve to justify risky interventions in the climate system. For example, injecting vast amounts of sulfate aerosols into the stratosphere through ‘solar radiation modification’ could be one of the few remaining ways to bring 1.5 °C back into reach. But it might also alter precipitation patterns or result in a burst of warming if the programme were suddenly halted.\n\nMore complex temperature targets won’t help. Discussions have begun around the concept of ‘overshoot’, in which the planet’s average temperature would be brought back to 1.5 °C by 2100 after a period exceeding that level4. But its achievement would be even harder to pin down. While in overshoot, no one can be sure whether it is permanent or temporary. A successful return to 1.5 °C could be confirmed only at the end of the century.\n\nAny approach based on projections to 2100 is unlikely to inspire public interest or political action because the goal is so far off. It is hubristic to think that researchers can predict accurately how emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence will affect the climate, or how Earth’s climate system itself will respond to unprecedented conditions.\n\nInstead, we propose that policymakers focus on rapidly building the clean-energy systems that can deliver the safer climate and thriving economies that populations demand. These goals are already agreed. For example, in 2023 at the UN Conference of the Parties (COP) 28 climate summit in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, countries called for a tripling of renewable-energy capacity globally by 2030 and the transition away from fossil fuels to reach net zero by 2050. Whereas delegates at COP30 in Belém, Brazil, in 2025, struggled to agree to phase out fossil fuels, support for accelerating clean energy is almost universal.\n\nTo fulfil this mandate, the world needs one clear number with which to measure climate progress during a transition that ends the use of fossil fuels. We think the most promising metric is one we term the ‘clean-energy shift’. Building on a concept initially proposed by Bloomberg New Energy Finance founder Michael Liebreich (see go.nature.com/3zr5y1), we define it as the growth rate in clean-energy generation minus the growth rate in total energy demand for a given time interval.\n\nThis metric emphasizes that clean-energy supply must expand faster than overall energy demand for decarbonization. When the percentage growth of clean-energy supply exceeds the growth in total energy use, fossil fuels get squeezed out of the system. By contrast, simply measuring clean energy share is insufficient, because fossil fuels might also rise overall to meet extra demand.\n\nFor example, if clean-energy grows by 6% each year and total energy demand grows by 3%, the clean-energy shift is +3%, meaning that clean energy is displacing fossil energy as a share of total energy generation. The bigger the number, the faster the exit from fossil fuels.\n\nClean-energy shift measures progress in a positive way5, towards a 100% clean economy, rather than negatively towards net zero. This would reduce the political resistance that arises from the perceived economic sacrifice of limiting emissions. Chasing the number zero will never motivate politicians concerned about economic development. Framing decarbonization as a story of building clean-energy industries and jobs is more appealing. The metric points to policies that are politically feasible, economically desirable and already advancing rapidly technologically, including solar, wind, batteries, geothermal, hydro and nuclear — without picking winners.\n\nThe power of pursuing this approach is evident in recent energy trends. Between 2018 and 2020, the annual percentage growth of clean-energy generation rose sharply, driven by rapid additions of solar, wind and storage capacities. Total global energy demand also grew, but at a slower rate, implying that growth in clean-energy production began eating into the share of fossil fuels. If this clean-energy shift can be increased further, the world would see a peak and then a steady decline in fossil-fuel use and related emissions. Indeed, data from China suggest the nation’s emissions peak could come as soon as this year6.\n\nIt is up to policymakers to determine how high the clean-energy shift should be. For example, to eliminate fossil fuels by 2050, the metric would need to rise substantially, from around 4% over the past five years, and keep climbing through the 2030s and 2040s. This means that clean-energy generation must continue its current rapid growth, rising several percentage points faster than total energy demand each year.\n\nAlthough challenging, trends in solar, wind and storage deployment suggest that this acceleration is achievable — although it will require expanded manufacturing capacity, grids built to integrate renewable technologies, continued reductions in battery costs and political will.\n\nTo achieve global decarbonization by 2050, policymakers need short-term milestones. We suggest they might set global targets of clean-energy shifts in five-year intervals — like rungs on a ladder, each climbing closer to a safe climate. It should be noted that the intervals are non-linear in terms of added capacity: because clean-energy shift is a percentage-growth metric, the higher rungs reflect increasingly rapid rates of clean-energy expansion, rather than a constant yearly addition.\n\nEncouragingly, the world has already climbed the first two rungs. We calculate an average shift of about 3.4% during 2014–19, rising to about 5.7% in 2024. The next rungs would need to sustain or increase these numbers to enable a fossil-fuels exit by 2050. Lower numbers would mean fossil fuels staying longer as part of the energy mix.\n\nThese intervals can be aligned with the five-year timelines used by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) policy process, such as major COP agreements, reviews of ‘nationally determined contributions’ and ‘global stocktakes’ of progress towards the Paris goals for emissions reductions.\n\nThe clean-energy shift metric also respects long-established UN principles of equity and accountability, including the concept of ‘common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities’ in climate policy. The metric would not be a legally binding top-down number but the upward product of the collective efforts of all countries, which would continue to determine their own energy policies.\n\nIndividual countries can use the metric to track their own progress. And several major emitters already include clean-energy targets in their Paris commitments. For example, India met its 50% non-fossil power capacity goal five years ahead of its 2030 target. China has more than doubled its wind and solar capacity over the past three years. The European Union currently has about one-quarter of its energy consumption supplied by renewable sources, which it has mandated should rise to 42.5% within five years.\n\nNo metric can cover everything. And the clean-energy shift excludes emissions from sources other than fossil fuels, such as greenhouse gases resulting from deforestation, soil cultivation or wildfires. But the climate damage caused by fossil fuels is unique in its scale — comprising 90% of the carbon dioxide problem (38 of 42 gigatonnes in 2024)7.\n\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-026-00246-z\n\nWatts, J. & Xipai, W. in The Guardian (28 October 2025).\n\nWorld Meteorological Organization.

    "fullText": "Advertising Standards Authority says firm advised by George Osborne ‘trivialised risks of cryptocurrency’\n\nA cryptocurrency company advised by George Osborne has been banned from showing a set of adverts that suggested using its services could be a solution to the cost of living crisis.\n\nCoinbase, which appointed the former Conservative chancellor to chair its global advisory council last year, has been told by the UK’s advertising watchdog that its adverts were “irresponsible” and “trivialised the risks of cryptocurrency”.\n\nThe adverts from the US crypto exchange include a sarcastic two-minute video showing people singing “everything is just fine, everything is grand” as their home falls into a state of disrepair and suffers a power cut, while outside Britons cheerfully dance through streets littered with rats and piles of overflowing bin bags.\n\nAs the ad progresses, a shopper faces rising prices for fish fingers in a supermarket, white-collar workers lose their jobs, a sewage pipe bursts and rubbish falls from the sky.\n\nThe clip ends with large text saying: “If everything’s fine, don’t change anything”, before being replaced with the Coinbase logo. The company, which was founded in 2012, provides a platform for people to buy and sell various cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said the advertising campaign, which launched in August, implied that using Coinbase could be an alternative to the financial concerns associated with the cost of living, and so trivialised the risks associated with investing in cryptocurrencies.\n\n“We considered that using humour to reference serious financial concerns, alongside a cue to ‘change’, risked presenting complex, high-risk financial products as an easy or obvious response to those concerns,” it said.\n\nOsborne was appointed in December to run Coinbase’s global advisory council to assist with the company’s lobbying in the UK and EU, having already been an adviser to the company for the past two years.\n\nThe company’s chief policy officer at the time said Osborne would play an “active role in helping us with policymakers around the world”. Last August, the former Tory MP had written a column in the Financial Times warning that the UK has been left behind in the cryptocurrency boom and is in danger of missing a second wave of demand.\n\nThe former politician last month added a role at ChatGPT developer OpenAI to his portfolio of positions, which also includes being the chair of the British Museum and a co-host of a podcast with the former Labour minister Ed Balls.\n\nThree posters from Coinbase were also banned by the ASA, which in large letters stated: “Home ownership out of reach,” as well as “real wages stuck in 2008” and “eggs now out of budget”. Small white background text read: “Everything is fine”repeatedly. The bottom of the poster said: “If everything’s fine, don’t change anything” next to the Coinbase logo.\n\nNeither the video nor the posters contained any information about the risks of investing in cryptocurrencies, the ASA said, despite the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority warning that cryptocurrency is “largely unregulated and high risk, and that buyers should be prepared to lose all of their money”.\n\nThe video advert by Coinbase had already been banned from television by Clearcast, which approves television ads in the UK, but the ASA said it had been shown on multiple online platforms, while the posters had been displayed in “high-traffic areas such as the London Underground and rail stations”.\n\nA spokesperson for Coinbase said: “While we respect the ASA’s decision, we fundamentally disagree with the characterisation of a campaign that critically reflects widely reported economic conditions as socially irresponsible.\n\n“The advert was intended to provoke discussion about the state of the financial system and the need to consider better futures, not to offer simplistic solutions or minimise risk.\n\n“While digital assets are not a panacea, we believe their responsible adoption can play a constructive role in a more efficient and freer financial system. Coinbase remains committed to authentic, thought-provoking communication and to operating responsibly within the UK’s regulatory framework.”",

    "fullText": "Workers informed after message had erroneously said affected employees in US, Canada and Costa Rica had already been told\n\nAmazon has told workers it is cutting 16,000 jobs globally to streamline its operations, hours after sending out a message to staff about the layoffs apparently in error.\n\nIt is the second major wave of job cuts at the US online retail giant, and comes just three months after the company said it was slashing 14,000 roles.\n\nThe majority of jobs affected are expected to be in the US, although some roles in the UK may also be affected.\n\nThe company said the “additional organisational changes” were designed to “strengthen our organisation by reducing layers, increasing ownership, and removing bureaucracy”, according to a blogpost to staff from Beth Galetti, the senior vice president of people experience and technology.\n\nGaletti said some teams had not been affected by the job cuts announced in October, but this was not the beginning of regular waves of layoffs. “Some of you might ask if this is the beginning of a new rhythm – where we announce broad reductions every few months. That’s not our plan,” she wrote.\n\nUS-based employees who are affected will be offered 90 days to find a new role internally, with the timing for applying for new roles varying in other countries.\n\nGaletti said Amazon would continue to hire new staff and invest in “strategic areas and functions that are critical to our future”.\n\nThe official announcement came just hours after workers at Amazon Web Services (AWS) received an online meeting invitation from a top executive on Tuesday for the following day – subsequently cancelled – that also contained a draft email revealing the cuts.\n\nThe message erroneously said that affected employees in the US, Canada and Costa Rica had already been told they had lost their jobs.\n\nIt was signed by Colleen Aubrey, a senior vice-president of applied AI solutions at the company’s cloud computing arm AWS, while the layoffs were referred to in the email as “Project Dawn”.\n\n“Changes like this are hard on everyone,” Aubrey wrote in the email, which was seen by multiple news outlets including Reuters and Bloomberg. “These decisions are difficult and are made thoughtfully as we position our organisation and AWS for future success.”\n\nThe email referred to a separate message from Amazon’s human resources boss, which did not appear to have been sent.\n\nAmazon has been trying to reverse a pandemic hiring spree in an effort to cut costs and slim down its huge operation, which employs about 1.5 million people worldwide.\n\nAmazon’s chief executive, Andy Jassy, has previously warned white-collar workers at the company that their jobs could be taken by AI in the next few years.\n\nThe news of fresh Amazon layoffs came as the US delivery company United Parcel Service (UPS) said it would cut up to 30,000 jobs this year, adding to last year’s job reductions, as it focuses on higher-margin shipments.\n\nUPS has been working to cut millions of low-value deliveries it carries out for Amazon, which is its largest customer but increasingly also a delivery rival. UPS has called its business with Amazon “extraordinarily dilutive” to margins.",

    "description": "Chloe Lee, a financial advisor, describes how solo surf camp trips in Bali boosted her confidence and built global friendships.",
    "fullText": "I met Chloe Lee after a sunset yoga class on a wooden deck inside our surf camp in Bali, Indonesia. She spun around excitedly when she heard me tell someone I was from Singapore too, and we bombarded each other with questions.\n\nLater that evening, at a Friday-night barbecue, the 22-year-old financial advisor told me it was her fifth visit to the camp. It explained why she knew every staff member, the two camp cats, and the fluffy white camp dog by name. We passed around lemongrass-scented bug spray and chatted about why young people like us are drawn to adventure sports.\n\nOver poke bowls after an intense surf session, we caught up again and talked about what kept bringing her back to the island.\n\nOur chats have been edited for length and clarity; the following is in Lee's words.\n\nMy introduction to surfing was through my partner, who told me about it in late 2023. We took a surf trip with some of our friends, and when I tried it, I actually enjoyed it. It was really scary, but I was surprised that I could stand up and catch some waves.\n\nIt took me one more trip — this time in Bali — before I decided that I definitely wanted to do this again.\n\nIn 2024, I had been working at JPMorgan for a year and felt very burned out. I decided to go on my first solo trip and chose to go surfing. I picked Bali again because it was close to home, and I did tons of research on different surf camps before settling on one. I wanted to improve at surfing, but a key criterion was also being able to meet new people.\n\nThese trips can be expensive, and taking days off means losing the commission I earn from onboarding new clients. But the mindset among Gen Z is shifting. It's about seeing things on Instagram and TikTok and using your adult money to treat yourself and do something your parents didn't dare to do before.\n\nI've visited this camp four times since my first solo trip. One reason that keeps drawing me back is the instructors, their technique, and the familiarity I have built with them.\n\nI really enjoy the community, hostel-like environment of the surf camp. I know that even if I come by myself, I will have a good time with other people. I've brought other friends and my partner since, and we always have a group to hang out with.\n\nI love that I stay in touch with the other surfers, most of whom live across the world. I can always follow influencers and see how people in different places live, but this feels so much more personal. I've also become close friends with several people from Singapore who are here. We play pickleball together, and one of them has even become my client.\n\nSurfing isn't popular in Singapore, and I feel like I've found people I can share my new hobby with. We have a group chat and send each other memes or content related to surfing, something my main group of friends can't relate to. Picking this up has also helped me bond with new people I meet back home, since most people are surprised to find someone who surfs regularly.\n\nMy surf trips are unlike any other travel experience — I feel like I'm truly on a getaway, rather than when I'm on trips where sightseeing, shopping, or food are the focus. I've realized that I don't interact with anybody else on regular trips. Here, I'm constantly engaging with people over meals or while we're in the water.\n\nIt's also so different from any other sport I've tried. I'm fully immersed when I'm in the water — I'm not thinking about work or anything back home. My attention is on catching the right waves, making my turns better, and avoiding injuries.\n\nI'm a very risk-averse person, and I still get scuffed surfing. However, the end result is so fulfilling that the element of danger feels worthwhile. For me, it's the adrenaline high of knowing I'm doing something that I thought I could not.\n\nTelling people I surf makes me feel proud and cool, like I'm doing something different. So many people have also asked me to bring them along when I go next.\n\nAnother thing I love about these trips is that I'm getting my body moving and being active, especially since I didn't do a lot of exercise back home.\n\nSurfing is physically demanding, and it's forced me to watch my health more. I never thought I'd try yoga until I realized I needed a lot of hip mobility and flexibility to improve my surfing. I've signed up for yoga classes and now go regularly back home.\n\nIt's also an escape from the bustle and stress back home, where people are obsessed with talking about work and LinkedIn milestones. When I come here, conversations are different. I've met tech founders, digital nomads, and people who are traveling full time.\n\nSurfing has also given me confidence and changed my mindset about a few things. It reminded me that I can do hard things and that I enjoy being uncomfortable. Waiting for waves has also taught me how to be patient and be aware of timing, which has translated into how I live and my relationships back home.\n\nI want to try more, maybe snowboarding next.",

It would have been the first time, I think, that men and women are on the same playing field, playing for the same exact amount of money.\n\n\"But I also think it's great that we are getting this opportunity, so that's my mixed feelings.\"\n\nThe indoor golf set-up features teams of players hitting shots at a five-storey-high simulator screen before moving to a short-game area with bunkers and a green that can rotate 360 degrees, creating hole-to-hole variations.\n\nAsked about the prospect of a mixed-gender event, Mike McCarley, a former TV executive who founded the TGL alongside McIlroy and Woods said the idea had been discussed.\n\n\"I think that is something that's interesting to us and is interesting to the LPGA and is interesting to a lot of the players we're talking to,\" said McCarley.\n\n\"Right now, we're really focused on building (the TGL) out and providing, frankly, a nice stage and really nice platform to showcase the players and their personalities.\"\n\nKorda, 27, is yet to commit to entering the event, saying she is \"still weighing out the time commitment\" required to play in the tournament.\n\nWorld number one Jeeno Thitikul and British golfers Charley Hull and Lottie Woad are among the players confirmed to compete.\n\nAtlanta Drive beat New York GC 4-3 to win the first TGL title last year, with a prize pot of £10.39m being split between the two finalists.\n\nThis season's competition, external began on 28 December, with a best-of-three final set to start on 23 March.\n\nThe start date and prize pot for the women's competition is yet to be announced, beyond it being scheduled to take place in winter 2026-27.",

    "fullText": "The AI Doc: Or How I Became an Apocaloptimist, co-directed by Daniel Roher, delves into the world of AI through the lens of personal anxiety\n\nAre we barreling toward AI catastrophe? Is AI an existential threat, or an epochal opportunity? Those are the questions top of mind for a new documentary at Sundance, which features leading AI experts, critics and entrepreneurs, including Sam Altman, the OpenAI CEO, with views on the near-to-midterm future ranging from doom to utopia.\n\nThe AI Doc: Or How I Became an Apocaloptimist, directed by Daniel Roher and Charlie Tyrell and produced by Daniel Kwan (one half of The Daniels, the Oscar-winning duo behind Everything Everywhere All At Once), delves into the contentious topic of AI through Roher’s own anxiety. The Canadian film-maker, who won an Oscar in 2023 for the documentary Navalny, first became interested in the topic while experimenting with tools released by OpenAI, the company behind the chatbot ChatGPT. The sophistication of the public tools – the ability to produce whole paragraphs in seconds, or produce illustrations – both thrilled and unnerved him. AI was already radically shaping the filmmaking industry, and proclamations on the promise and peril of AI were everywhere, with little way for people outside the tech industry to evaluate them. As an artist, he wondered, how was he to make sense of it all?\n\nRoher’s anxiety only increased when he and his wife, fellow film-maker Caroline Lindy, learned that they were expecting their first child. “It felt like the whole world was rushing into something without thinking,” he says in the film, as his excitement for parenthood collided with dread over the unknown variable of AI, which in just a few short years went from proprietary experiment to public good.\n\nThe AI Doc thus arises out of Roher’s most pressing question: is it safe to bring a child into this world? Alongside Kwan, Roher convened a series of experts to both explain the mechanics of the tech – and clarify some nebulous, alienating terms – and search for an answer. (It is both comforting and a little disturbing, for example, that no one seems to have a clear answer to the question “what is AI?”). In individual sit-down interviews, leading machine learning researchers including Yoshua Bengio, Ilya Sutskever and DeepMind co-founder Shane Legg all agree that there are aspects of AI models that humans cannot and will never be able to understand. Standard AI models are trained on “more data than anyone could ever read in several lifetimes”, as one machine learning expert puts it. And the pace of machine learning exceeds that of precedent – or film. “Any example you put in this movie will look absolutely clumsy by the time the movie comes out,” Tristan Harris, co-founder of the Center for Humane Technology and a prominent voice in the apocalyptic 2020 Netflix documentary The Social Dilemma, tells Roher.\n\nThe film first hears from a series of doomerists, or people concerned AI – and in particular Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), a still-theoretical form of AI whose capabilities exceed those of humans – could lead to the extermination of humanity, including Harris, his Center for Humane Technology co-founder Aza Raskin, Ajeya Cotra, an AI risk adviser, and Eli Yudkowsky, an AI alignment pioneer. Such figures warn that humans could very easily lose control of super-intelligent AI models, with little to no recourse. Yudkowsky’s 2025 book is bluntly titled If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies.\n\nAI companies, they say, are unprepared for the consequences of reaching AGI, which could “become superhuman maybe in this decade”, says Dan Hendrycks, director of the Center for AI Safety. Should humans no longer be the most intelligent beings on Earth, they warn, it is possible that AGI would view the species as irrelevant. Connor Leahy, co-founder of EleutherAI, compared the potential future relationship of super-intelligent AGI and humans to that of humans and ants: “We don’t hate ants. But if we want to build a highway” over an anthill – “well, sucks for the ant.”\n\nSeveral in the doomer camp, many of whom do not have children, react discouragingly to Roher’s question about parenthood. “I know people who work on AI risk who don’t expect their child to make it to high school,” says Harris, in a line that drew gasps from a preview audience in Park City.\n\nOn the other side are optimistic figures such as Peter Diamandis, founder of the XPRIZE Foundation trying to extend human life, who claims that “children born today are about to enter a period of glorious transformation”; Guillaume Verdon, a leader of the “effective accelerationism” movement in Silicon Valley; Peter Lee, the president of Microsoft Research; and Daniela Amodei, the co-founder and president of OpenAI rival Anthropic. So-called “accelerationists” see AI as a potential cure to a myriad of seemingly intractable issues afflicting humanity: cancer, food and water shortages for an ever-growing population, insufficient renewable energy and perhaps most pressing, climate emergency. Without AI, they argue, countless future lives would be lost to drought, famine, disease and natural catastrophes.\n\nDevelopment of AI, however, relies on computing power, which requires vast amounts of energy. A final group of interviewees, critics and observers largely outside the tech world – including Karen Hao, a journalist and author of the book Empire of AI: Dreams and Nightmares in Sam Altman’s OpenAI, and Liv Boeree, Win-Win podcast hos – connect AI to the tangible, physical world, such as the data centers sucking up water in the American west, leaving residents with sky-high electricity bills and drained reservoirs. The current narratives around AI, according to Emily M Bender, a computational linguistics professor, exclude and dehumanize the people it is already impacting, and will continue to disrupt.\n\nRoher eventually arrives at the five most powerful people – all men – currently leading the AI arms race: Altman; Elon Musk, the xAI CEO; Dario Amodei, the Anthropic CEO; Demis Hassabis of DeepMind and Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg. Altman, Amodei and Hassabis sit for interviews that more or less defend their companies’ respective positions. According to the film, Zuckerberg declined to participate; Musk agreed but then got too busy.\n\nAltman, who at the time of the interview was expecting his first child, insists that he’s “not scared for a kid to grow up in a world with AI”. He and his husband Oliver Mulherin welcomed their son via a surrogate in February 2025, an event Altman later said “neurochemically hacked” his brain, leading people in his life to think that he would “make better decisions” for OpenAI and ChatGPT when it comes to “humanity as a whole”. The 40-year-old CEO went on to say that both his and Roher’s child would likely “never be smarter than AI” which “does unsettle me a little bit, but it is reality”.\n\nAt one point, Roher asks Altman if it is indeed impossible to reassure him that everything in regards to AI is going to be OK. “That is impossible,” Altman affirms, though he does say that OpenAI’s lead in the AI arms race allows it to spend more time on safety testing.\n\nThe AI Doc ultimately lands somewhere in between doomerism and optimism – apocaloptimism, as they call it, searching for “a path between the promise and the peril”. That path should include, according to numerous film subjects: significant, sustained, paradigm-shifting international coordination, akin the mid-century frameworks and agreements introduced to moderate the development of atomic weapons – more corporate transparency for AI companies, an independent regulatory body to police AI developers, legal liability for the companies’ products, such as ChatGPT, mandatory disclosure of genAI use for media and a willingness to keep adapting the rules for rapidly shifting tech.\n\nWhether or not the US government and companies, let alone the world, can do it remains an open question, with differing opinions on first steps. But if there is one thing the many subjects all agree on, it’s that there’s no going back to a time before AI. As Anthropic co-founder and CEO Amodei puts it: “This train isn’t going to stop.”\n\nThe AI Doc: Or How I Became an Apocaloptimist is screening at the Sundance film festival and will be released on 27 March",

    "fullText": "Popularity of EVs in country is part of global trend of emerging markets spurning fossil fuel cars at surprising speeds\n\nWhen Berke Astarcıoğlu bought a BMW i3 in 2016, he was one of just 44 people in a country of 80 million to buy a battery electric vehicle (BEV) that year. By the time he bought a Tesla in 2023, BEVs were no longer a complete oddity in Turkey, making up 7% of new car sales.\n\nFast-forward two years and electric cars are selling so fast that Turkey has caught up with the EU in its rate of adoption. Its market is now the fourth largest in Europe, behind Germany, the UK and France.\n\n“A premium product is a thing that makes you happy but that not everyone can have,” said Astarcıoğlu, a mechatronic engineer from Istanbul and the developer of an app to find charging stations. “My Tesla has become an ordinary car over here.”\n\nBEVs made up 16.7% of new car sales in Turkey in 2025, just behind the EU’s 17.4%, registration data published on Tuesday shows. While uptake is lower than in the Netherlands or the Nordics, where BEVs make up 35% to 96% of new cars sold, sales in Turkey have raced ahead of almost every country in southern and eastern Europe.\n\nIts electric vehicle surge is part of a global trend in which emerging markets from Uruguay to Vietnam are spurning fossil fuel-burning cars at surprising speed. The latest data comes as Turkey prepares to host the UN climate summit, and one month after the EU watered down its 2035 ban on new combustion engine cars.\n\nAnalysts attribute the boom to a disparity in Turkey’s special consumption tax, which has left electric cars only slightly more expensive than comparable petrol cars. Sales remained high even after the government raised taxes on electric vehicles in August.\n\n“Practically speaking, Turkish people don’t buy electric vehicles because it’s eco-friendly,” said Ufuk Alparslan, an analyst at the climate thinktank Ember, saying that running costs were lower for electric cars. “The motivation is purely economical.”\n\nElectrifying car fleets is seen as a crucial step to decarbonising the transport sector and reducing pollution, but efforts in many regions have run into roadblocks. In the EU, where planet-heating emissions from cars have risen by 17% since 1990, attempts to phase out combustion engines have been met with fierce resistance from the automobile industry.\n\nThe Turkish government does not have a dedicated electric vehicle strategy but has championed a domestic carmaker, Togg, which in 2024 overtook Tesla as the country’s leading EV seller. In an interview with Bloomberg HT last week, Togg’s board chair, Fuat Tosyalı, announced plans to increase production from 40,000 cars in 2025 to 60,000 in 2026.\n\nTogg’s entry into the market, which was buoyed up by tax support and zero-interest credit from state-owned banks, has helped normalise electric vehicle adoption, said Berkan Bayram, the founder of the Turkish Electric and Hybrid Vehicles Association. “It gained the heart of Turkish buyers.”\n\nForeign carmakers who must contend with import duties have benefited from the Togg-friendly tax system, with manufacturers including Tesla reducing motor power in Turkey to fall into the same favourable tax bracket. China’s BYD is also jostling for a greater share of the market and plans to build a $1bn factory in Turkey.\n\nIn addition to the environmental benefits of displacing fossil fuel vehicles, the transition to electric mobility could be a geopolitical boon for countries that do not produce oil themselves. Turkey’s car fleet is expected to quadruple in size by 2053, sending demand for oil imports soaring, according to a report by InstitutDE, a Turkish diplomatic thinktank in Brussels.\n\nWhile imports will rise in all scenarios studied, a failure to run more cars on electricity would heighten Turkey’s exposure to external shocks, price volatility and geopolitical risks, the report found.\n\nHowever, the recent increase in BEV sales may not herald a systemic shift away from fossil fuel cars. The tax incentives are “very fragile” and can change easily, said Baki Kaya, an economist and former diplomat who co-wrote the InstitutDE report.\n\n“It’s not the result of a strategic decision,” he said. “And I’m personally not that optimistic [it will continue].”\n\nAnalysis from Ember found the overall tax burden on electric cars remained high, with the total tax applied to electric cars in the lowest bracket reaching 50%, and rising to 86% in a higher bracket. Without changes, inflation and exchange rates could soon shrink the number of affordable BEVs, Alparslan said.\n\n“Although electric cars have started to become widespread in Turkey, there is still a large, untapped potential to reduce energy imports through renewable energy and electric vehicles,” he said. “Tax policies that keep electric vehicle prices at more affordable levels could accelerate this momentum.”",

Four of the deceased were passengers, while the other two on board were flight crew. There were no survivors. (The FAA said in an initial notice that seven had died, with one survivor, who was seriously injured.)\n\nA news release shared by the airport on Monday, Jan. 26, read, \"According to the flight manifest there were six people on the flight. No one from the incident was transported to the hospital, and all on the flight are presumed to be deceased. The identities of the people on the flight are not being released publicly at this time, pending positive identification.\"\n\nJacob Hosmer was the captain of the flight, NBC affiliate KPRC reported. The Houston-area pilot, 47, was confirmed to have been among the victims of the crash by his father, Gary.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\n“He’s in Heaven now with Jesus,” Gary told the outlet.\n\nA friend, who knew Hosmer for 15 years as an aviation specialist, said, \"I would describe him as a great pilot, a loving husband, and a phenomenal father,” adding, “He was always kind. He was always laughing.\"\n\nThe plane involved in the crash had arrived from Texas, according to Reuters. It is registered to a company with a Houston address shared with the personal injury law firm Arnold & Itkin.\n\nHosmer had Houston-based injury law firm Arnold & Itkin LLP listed as his employer on LinkedIn since May 2025.\n\nThe firm's founders, Kurt Arnold and Jason Itkin, were not on the aircraft, multiple sources told ABC affiliate KTRK.\n\nHowever, Kurt's wife, attorney Tara Arnold, was reportedly killed in the crash, sources told the outlet.\n\nHarris County Commissioner Lesley Briones, a close friend of the family, told the outlet, \"I'm close friends with Kurt and Tara Arnold, and we're still waiting for additional information. Unfortunately, the plane went down (Sunday) evening in Maine, and my heart hurts for them, for their children, and for their families.\"\n\nArnold & Itkin have not shared an official statement about the crash as of Tuesday, Jan. 27.\n\n\"She was a phenomenal person, a bold leader, and someone with a heart of service,\" Briones continued of Tara, according to KTRK. \"She was very involved in Precinct 4 and our nonprofit, Precinct 4 Forward. My heart is with Kurt, their children, and everyone affected.\"\n\nEvent planner Shawna Collins was also on board the aircraft, according to her daughter, the outlet reported. Collins reportedly spoke to her daughter about the business trip just before the flight, which was heading to Europe.\n\nThe Bangor Police Department did not immediately respond to PEOPLE's request for confirmation of the victims' IDs on Tuesday, Jan. 27.\n\nIn an audio recording of air traffic controllers’ conversation following the crash, one person said, “Aircraft upside down. We have a passenger aircraft upside down.”\n\nFirst responders arrived at the scene less than a minute after the conversation about the upside-down aircraft, airport director Jose Saavedra said, according to the Associated Press.\n\nThe plane caught fire after the crash, according to the FAA. The exact circumstances surrounding the crash remain unclear.\n\nThe airport was being impacted by Winter Storm Fern, with snow falling at the time of the crash, CBS affiliate KHOU and Reuters reported.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nFormer New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick will likely be enshrined in the NFL Hall of Fame, but it won't happen in 2026.\n\nIn a shocking decision, Belichick did not receive the 80% of votes necessary for enshrinement in his first year on the ballot.\n\nDespite Belichick's eight Super Bowl rings, six as a head coach, he did not reach 40 of the 50 votes required. One of the main reasons, as outlined by Seth Wickersham, was due to the Spygate and Deflategate cheating scandals that took place during Belichick's tenure. According to an anonymous source of Wickersham's, some \"believed Belichick should 'wait a year' before induction as penance for Spygate.\"\n\nThe decision not to elect Belichick in his first year of eligibility was not well received. Despite the coach's past scandals and the current unsuccessful transition to college coaching, he is still widely accepted as deserving of the Hall of Fame and should have been elected in his first year.\n\nHere is more on the NFL world's reaction to Belichick not being a first-ballot Hall of Famer.\n\nMORE: Why is Bill Belichick not a first ballot Hall of Famer?\n\nThe former star defender weighed in on Belichick not being elected to Canton in his first year on the ballot. Watt never played for Belichick, always against him, but that didn't stop him from respecting an NFL legend. Watt himself will be first eligible for a call to the hall in 2028.\n\nI can’t be reading this right.\n\nThis has to be some knock-off Hall of Fame or something, it can’t be the actual NFL Hall of Fame.\n\nThere is not a single world whatsoever in which Bill Belichick should not be a First-Ballot Hall of Famer. https://t.co/OXhL1Sd4FM\n\n— JJ Watt (@JJWatt) January 27, 2026\n\nButler spent nine years in the NFL. He began his career playing for Belichick in New England for two years. He then spent the 2011 season with the Carolina Panthers before ending his career with a six-year stint with the Indianapolis Colts. Even though Butler wasn't with the Patriots long, he still respects Belichick.\n\nIf BILL BELICHICK isn’t a first ballot HOFer who is!? pic.twitter.com/qywmMgbLuD\n\n— Darius Butler (@DariusJButler) January 27, 2026\n\nMcAfee is always outspoken when it comes to sports.

He spent the majority of his career (2006 to 2013) with the Pittsburgh Steelers. Clark played against Belichick several times, but there is no doubt in his mind that Belichick is deserving of enshrinement.\n\nBill Belichick not being a first ballot Hall of Famer means that no coach should ever be. It means that the voters have decided there isn’t a coaching resume that warrants First Ballot consideration!\n\nHe is the GREATEST, most ACCOMPLISHED coach of all time! This is egregious!\n\n— Ryan Clark (@Realrclark25) January 27, 2026\n\nMahomes is likely going to find himself in Canton one day.

She fell in love with the business and went on to become known as the “lobster lady” as she faithfully tended traps for decades\n\n“I like doing it, I like being along the water,” she told The Associated Press in 2021. “And so I’m going to keep on doing it just as long as I can.”\n\nOliver died Wednesday, according to a family obituary published Monday.\n\n“Her life has been celebrated in books, articles, and across social media platforms worldwide,” the obituary states. “Yet despite her renown, she remained quiet and humble, greeting everyone with a quick, radiant smile and eyes that literally twinkled.”\n\nAs she worked on the water over the years, Oliver watched the lobster industry drastically evolve, from a working-class food to a pricey delicacy. Lobsters fetched 28 cents a pound on the docks when she first started trapping them. Today, it's 22 times that at $6.14 a pound.\n\nYet many of the aspects of the job remained the same. She had to get up in the early morning hours — long before dawn — and use small fish called menhaden, or pogies, to lure lobsters from a boat once owned by her late husband, the “Virginia.”\n\n“Virginia was more than a local icon; she was a living piece of Maine’s maritime history,” the Maine Lobster Festival said in a statement honoring Oliver, where she once served as grand marshal of the festival's parade.\n\nMaine Gov. Janet Mills, who once presented Oliver with a special state recognition for her birthday, posted on social media that the lobster lady's life inspired \"the next century of hardworking Maine fishermen.\"",

    "fullText": "From rhino-sized Rhyhorns to worm-like Diglett, visitors to PokéPark Kanto will roam a forest populated by lifelike Pokémon statues when the attraction opens next week\n\nIn Japan, February is normally a period of quiet reflection, a month defined by winter festivals in Sapporo’s snowy mountains and staving off the cold in steaming hot springs. Traditionally, international tourists start to arrive with the blossoms in spring – but thanks to the opening of Pokémon’s first ever amusement park on 5 February, this year, they are likely to come earlier.\n\nUnlike the rollercoaster-filled thrills of Tokyo Disney Sea or Universal Studios Japan in Osaka, PokéPark Kanto is essentially a forest populated by models of the creatures from the perennially popular games. Nestled in the quiet Tokyo suburb of Inagi, half an hour from the city centre, the park is a walkable forest with more than 600 Pokémonin it. Where the Mario-themed Super Nintendo World slots neatly into the massive Universal Studios Japan, PokéPark Kanto is hidden in the back of the less glitzy, funfair-esque Japanese theme park Yomiuri Land.\n\nTaking up 26,000 sq metres, the family-friendly attraction is divided into two main areas: Pokémon Forest and the plaza-esque Sedge Town. Tickets for the park are bought via a lottery system – and currently sold out for the next three months – ranging between ¥7,900 (£38) for a standard adult ticket and ¥14,000 (£66) for a queue-skipping priority pass.\n\nThe park’s creative direction has been overseen by one of the original Pokémon creators, Junichi Masuda. Visitors roam a series of explorable habitats, littered with endearingly lifelike statues of hundreds of Pokémon, arranged in fun tableaus where various species are interacting with each other. Walking through PokéPark Kanto feels akin to becoming a Pokédex-clutching David Attenborough, a re-creation of what it would be like to observe these fantastical creatures in the wild. Beaver-esque Bidoofs use their two front teeth to cut down a real tree. Worm-like Diglett burrow above the soil to greet a smiling Eevee.\n\nEach Pokémon is presented in full scale too, making the larger creatures especially awe-inspiring. From a lorry-sized re-creation of the rocky behemoth Onix to a herd of rhinoceros-sized Rhyhorns lining the main path, each habitat is a joy to behold, with hidden creatures dotted throughout the trees and grass as a reward for eagle-eyed kids.\n\nIn many ways, it’s surprising it has taken this long for a permanent Pokémon theme park to be erected. With Pikachu and pals celebrating their 30th anniversary this year, Pokémon is still comfortably the highest-grossing media brand in the world: its total estimated lifetime revenue of $150bn comfortably surpasses Disney properties such as Star Wars and Marvel. The Pokémon company’s profit rose to ¥70.3bn in the year ending February 2025 – roughly £337m – and with a range of new games, merchandise and the new theme park, its profits in 2026 are only likely to increase.\n\nAfter clearing the Pokémon forest, visitors are greeted by a Pokémon parade in Sedge Town square, where there are also Pokémon-themed versions of fairground games such as ring toss, Pokémon-themed food, and an Eevee-themed carousel. Visitors can also walk into a real-life Pokémon Centre (an iconic building from the games and anime) and grab a seat at a gym where they can watch a live Pokémon battle that blends human performers with cutting-edge animatronics.\n\nThe Pokémon Company has numerous Pokémon Centre shops all over Japan selling exclusive merchandise. PokéPark Kanto will continue this lucrative trend, selling plushies and clothing that people will have to travel there to own. Video games are huge business in Japan, one of the country’s main cultural exports – but theme parks based on the country’s virtual stars are a newer phenomenon. Since Super Nintendo World first opened its doors at Universal Studios Japan in 2021, it has been transplanted to Universal’s parks in Hollywood and Florida, with all locations helping to drive multi-billion dollar quarterly revenues.\n\nThanks to a weak yen post-pandemic, recent years have seen tourists flock to Japan. While it has been a boon to the economy, the flood of incomers has led to tension. From phone-camera-weilding influencers behaving badly, to overcrowded streets inconveniencing locals, the 42 million visitors who arrived in Japan in 2025 have come alongside a notable nationwide rise in anti-foreigner sentiment. Newly appointed prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, is already doubling down on anti-tourist legislation. It’s safe to say that PokéPark Kanto, with its family-friendly international appeal, will only increase visitors to Japan’s overcrowded capital.",

    "fullText": "Tech chiefs waxed poetic about AI to delegates at Davos. Plus, the ‘human’ drama of AI startups and why Tesla is thriving in Texas\n\nHello, and welcome to TechScape. This week’s edition is a team effort: my colleague Heather Stewart reports on the plans for AI’s world domination at Davos; I examine how huge investments have followed AI companies with little to their names but drama and dreams; and Nick Robins-Early spotlights how lax regulation of autonomous driving in Texas allowed Tesla to thrive.\n\nWhen they weren’t discussing Donald Trump, delegates at the World Economic Forum last week were being dazzled by the prospects for artificial intelligence.\n\nUp and down the main street of the Swiss Alps town, almost every shopfront was temporarily emblazoned with the neon slogan of a tech firm – or a consultancy promising to tell executives how to incorporate AI into their business. Cloudflare’s wood-panelled HQ urged delegates to “connect, protect and build together”, and Wipro’s shouted: “Dream Solve Prove Repeat.”\n\nAt the conference, tech CEOs laid out their hopes for how the physical manifestations of AI will blanket the world in the coming years. Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella told a rapt audience about how “token factories”, as he calls datacenters, will have to be distributed across the world, to diffuse the benefits of AI globally.\n\n“To me, a long term, scalable solution is to have all of these token factories part of the real economy connected to the grid, connected to the telco network – and that’s what will drive that scale, whether it’s in the global south, or in the developed world,” Nadella said.\n\nMeanwhile Google was showing off the latest iteration of its Google Glasses to excited delegates; and there were endless sessions in the Davos congress centre about the technology’s potential benefits – including a breathless chat with late addition to the schedule Elon Musk, though with the SpaceX IPO apparently looming, he was keenest to talk about going to Mars.\n\nAway from the glitzy shopfronts, though, there was significant concern being expressed that all this proves to be an epic bubble.\n\nIn an interview with the Financial Times, DeepMind chief Demis Hassabis warned that some aspects of AI investment do look, “bubble-like”, but insisted that, “if the bubble bursts, we [ie Google, not society at large] will be fine”.\n\nNadella offered one test for how we would know if it is a bubble – which I didn’t find reassuring. “A tell-tale sign of this as a bubble, is if all we’re talking about are the tech firms,” he said.\n\nMuch of Silicon Valley has been captivated over the past week by a “very human drama”, as the Wall Street Journal put it. Thinking Machines Lab, a startup founded by former OpenAI chief technology officer Mira Murati, fired her own chief technology officer, Barret Zoph, over a relationship with a colleague and a recent lack of productivity, per the Journal. Within hours, her ex-employee – along with one of her co-founders and a third employee – had reportedly signed offers with OpenAI, which they left just last year to join her startup. The three had told her they disagreed with the direction of the company in the meeting that ended with Zoph’s firing, according to the Journal. For his part, Zoph told the Journal that Murati had fired him simply for telling her he was considering another job.\n\nAs dishy as the drama might be, the stakes of Murati’s mess differ from a juicy celebrity entanglement that might be chronicled in TMZ or Page Six, two of my favorite publications. The stakes in San Francisco are billions of real dollars and more than $10bn potential ones. Murati’s company has raised $2bn in venture capital since its founding in February 2025. It is valued at $12bn. The talent involved in these California productions – not movies but rather AI tools used by hundreds of millions of people – takes on superstar significance.\n\nThinking Machines has released one product, Tinker, in October 2025, meant to streamline the customization of large language models, a rather niche concern in comparison with ChatGPT’s ambitions to replace Google search or Claude’s coding aptitude.\n\nThe massive investment and resulting valuation are chasing little in terms of real offerings from the company. A new company profiled in the New York Times last week, Humans&, has naught but a dream, an ugly website – and several hundred million dollars. Researchers from Google, Anthropic, and Elon Musk’s xAI, including one who helped develop the notorious Grok AI tool, founded the company just three months ago. They aim to facilitate collaboration between humans and machines rather than separation – “innovations in long-horizon and multi-agent reinforcement learning, memory, and user understanding”, per the site. If that sounds gauzy, it is because the company has not launched a product.\n\nHumans& has raised $480m from Nvidia, Jeff Bezos, and Google, per the New York Times. It is valued at $4.48bn. It has – say it with me one more time – not launched a product.\n\nWhatever fears of an AI bubble may be circulating, the money is still flowing, chasing after the future with an enormous but uncertain bet in the present.\n\nElon Musk announced last week that Tesla had removed human safety monitors from its Robotaxis in Austin, Texas, as the company moves to expand its autonomous vehicle business. As with most things Musk, the reality was a bit more complicated – Tesla’s vice-president of software later clarified on X that the company had deployed “a few unsupervised vehicles mixed in with the broader robotaxi fleet with safety monitors”.\n\nWhat Tesla’s test-run of fully driverless vehicles did highlight, however, was the difference between how much leeway Texas gives autonomous vehicles compared with California, the birthplace of autonomous driving in the US and the home of the highest number of self-driving cars in the country. The Texas department of motor vehicles does not have regulatory authority over autonomous vehicles in the state, instead autonomous vehicles are governed by the state’s transportation code. Although a new government authorization system for autonomous vehicles is set to be implemented in the coming months, there’s currently no application process required for autonomous vehicle operators in the state. \n\n “Autonomous vehicles on Texas roads are subject to all traffic laws and can be cited for safety violations, but do not yet require specific authorization to operate,” the Texas DMV said.\n\nAlso surprising is the state’s lack of regulations on operating an autonomous vehicle if it’s for personal, non-commercial use. As long as it complies with some stipulations, such as traffic laws and safety standards, an autonomous vehicle can drive around Texas without anyone in the car.\n\n “Any motor vehicle equipped with an automated driving system may operate in this state,” the Texas transportation code states. “An automated motor vehicle may operate in this state with the automated driving system engaged, regardless of whether a human driver is physically present in the automated motor vehicle.”\n\nMeanwhile in California, the state’s department of motor vehicles requires three stages of testing and permitting for commercial autonomous vehicles. Regulators are also in the process of considering new rules that could add even more requirements on vehicle operators. Tesla caused confusion last October when Musk announced a ride-hailing service in the Bay Area, only for regulators to say that the company did not have authorization to operate paid or unpaid autonomous rides to the public. On the Robotaxi section of Tesla’s website, it only mentions Texas.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Jan 27 (Reuters) - American composer Philip Glass withdrew the world premiere of his symphony \"Lincoln\" from the Kennedy Center on Monday, ​saying the work's values conflict with those of the performing ‌arts venue that was taken over by President Donald Trump.\n\nGlass is the latest musical luminary ‌to withdraw from the Kennedy Center since Trump named himself chairman and filled its board with his allies last year.

    "description": "As a Disney travel planner who's visited the theme parks many times, here are the mistakes I always see people make that cost them time and money.",
    "fullText": "I've been to the Disney parks over 50 times, so I've truly done it all.\n\nI'm also a travel planner at Marvelous Mouse Travels who specializes in Disney destinations, so a big part of my job is making recommendations about how to plan an epic trip. I also give my clients a lot of advice on what not to do.\n\nHere are some of the biggest mistakes people make at Disney World.\n\nIf you have any flexibility, avoid scheduling your Disney vacation during major school breaks in the US.\n\nHoliday weekends, spring break, and winter holidays will almost always bring the biggest crowds to the theme parks.\n\nDisney doesn't really have many low seasons anymore, but avoiding these highly popular times will give you more freedom to explore the parks with fewer crowds and lower ticket prices.\n\nThe theme parks are a big part of the Disney experience, and I love spending time at them. However, there's so much more to do in the area.\n\nFor one, I recommend taking a day off to lounge by your hotel's pool, resort hop, shop at Disney Springs, or even play a round of mini-golf.\n\nWhen we go to the parks, my family also usually takes a midday break to rest and relax. It is supposed to be a vacation, after all.\n\nSpeaking of just how much there is to do at Disney beyond the parks, you must check out its shopping, dining, and entertainment complex Disney Springs. It's free to explore.\n\nPick up some souvenirs at the massive World of Disney shop, check out the hundreds of sets and amazing displays at the Lego store, or just enjoy some snacks while you bask in the Florida sun.\n\nIf you get really hungry, head over to grab a delicious lunch at one of my favorite eateries, like Homecomin' or Frontera Cocina.\n\nMy No. 1 tip for visiting theme parks of any kind is to arrive early.\n\nYou'll get a huge jump on your day if you get to the parks as soon as they open, or just before. Crowd levels tend to be much lower at this time, meaning you can experience many attractions early in the day.\n\nAs with most theme parks, the longer you stay, the lower your daily ticket and accommodation costs are likely to be with bundles.\n\nIf you're already paying to travel to Disney, do yourself a favor and stay a few extra days.\n\nAfter all, the biggest complaint I get from clients is that they didn't stay long enough. In my opinion, a week is the ideal amount of time to truly experience Disney World.\n\nSome organization and prep are required for the ideal Disney World trip, but you shouldn't overplan.\n\nYou don't need to schedule every moment of your day or have every detail organized. Make a general outline of your daily agenda — with dining reservations and a list of must-do rides and attractions — but leave room for spontaneous fun.\n\nIf you're on too tight a schedule, you'll miss all the good stuff, like unique character interactions.\n\nThe park-hopping ticket option allows you to visit more than one park per day for less than it'd cost to buy each ticket separately.\n\nHowever, unless you're staying for only a very short time and want to see as much as possible, there are few reasons to park hop with small kids.\n\nIt can just become an unnecessary added expense that you probably won't make the best use of if you're pausing for afternoon naps or breaks.\n\nHowever, groups with older children or only adults may enjoy and fully take advantage of the flexibility that park hopping offers.\n\nIf you want to dine at table-service restaurants, you should make reservations in advance. However, eating three sit-down meals a day at Disney World will take up way too much of your time.\n\nMany table-service experiences can take 90 minutes to two hours from start to finish, so you wouldn't be left with much time to experience the rest of the parks.\n\nOne table-service reservation a day is usually a perfect respite from the hustle and bustle without overcrowding your schedule.\n\nRider swap, or rider switch, is a great service when traveling with young children who aren't tall enough for or don't want to ride certain attractions.\n\nIt allows one parent or guardian to wait with the child while the rest of the party rides. Once the first group returns, the waiting adult can go on the attraction without having to get in the back of the line.\n\nHowever, not enough people know about it, and they can end up wasting time in lines.\n\nJust get in the habit of asking the park employee at the front of the ride whether it's available for a particular attraction.\n\nStaying off the property can save you money, and I've done so many times on Disney trips. However, if you've never stayed at a Disney resort, you're missing out.\n\nThese stays can come with practical benefits, including complimentary transportation to and from the parks. The biggest perk, though, is the access to extra Disney magic.\n\nThese resorts typically have incredibly immersive themes and special touches that should be experienced at least once. Though there are some extravagant Disney resorts, there are also value ones that tend to be more budget-friendly.\n\nThis story was originally published on November 9, 2021, and most recently updated on January 27, 2026.",

    "description": "Dave...",
    "fullText": "As marauding state agents fill US streets, a leading German soccer official says countries should consider what was once unthinkable: skipping the 2026 World Cup.\n\nThis week, a leading German soccer official, Oke Göttlich, said that the time has come to consider the unthinkable: a boycott of the World Cup to protest Donald J. Trump’s United States. The most watched sporting event on earth is due to be played this year in the United States, Canada, and Mexico, and Göttlich said in a Friday interview, before a federal agent murdered Minneapolis VA nurse Alex Pretti, that “the time has come” to “seriously consider and discuss this.” Göttlich was responding not only to state agents marauding US streets but also to Trump’s military threats against Greenland and the people of Europe, which have shattered old alliances. However specious these alliances may have been, the alternative that Trump is advancing is a new world order of unchecked US aggression, where the ghoulish Stephen Miller feels free to call for occupation and bloodshed.\n\nGöttlich is no lightweight. He is one of the German federation’s 10 vice presidents and the president of the Bundesliga club St. Pauli. Folks may know St. Pauli as a proudly left-wing, openly anti-fascist team whose fans generally align with what Göttlich is putting forward, although calling for a boycott goes beyond what any European soccer power broker has done. It moves the “Overton window” as to where this discussion could go. Göttlich was pressed by a reporter about the St. Pauli players on the German national team and whether he felt like he was undercutting their personal and national ambitions. Göttlich replied, “The life of a professional player is not worth more than the lives of countless people in various regions who are being directly or indirectly attacked or threatened by the World Cup host. What were the justifications for the boycotts of the Olympic Games in the 1980s? By my reckoning the potential threat is greater now than it was then. We need to have this discussion.”\n\nIt is actually past time to have this discussion. Ten long months ago, I wrote a piece with Jules Boykoff titled, “With ICE Out of Control, How Can the US Cohost the 2026 World Cup?” It was a call for countries outside of the United States to boycott. We did not know at the time that the US would threaten war on European soil, abduct world leaders, blow fisher-folk out of the ocean, kidnap 5-year-olds, and execute US citizens in the streets. And yet even 10 months ago, in the aftermath of the ICE kidnappings of Mahmoud Khalil and Rumeysa Ozturk and the revelations that the US was sending people to labor camps in El Salvador, it was clear that the direction of this country would be toward fascist violence.\n\nOur argument was that countries were being deeply irresponsible by not warning their citizens that traveling to the United States would be perilous and not just for them: players, coaches, and their families would all be at risk. Now even FIFA former chief, that monument to corruption Sepp Blatter, is saying that it could be dangerous for fans to travel to the United States. But Göttlich is taking it to the next level by challenging nations to stay home. FIFA, the world governing body for soccer, has witnessed its chief, Gianni Infantino, affect a weak and bent posture when in Trump’s presence. During Trump’s second term, Infantino has visited the White House more than any foreign leader and presented Trump with that tacky FIFA Peace Prize. Infantino might feel like a world leader when paraded around by Trump like a hairless poodle, but his subservience to Trump has created an opportunity for Göttlich to be a real leader.\n\n“As organizations and society, we’re forgetting how to set taboos and boundaries, and how to defend values,” Göttlich said. “Taboos are an essential part of our stance. Is a taboo crossed when someone threatens? Is a taboo crossed when someone attacks? When people die? I would like to know from Donald Trump when he has reached his taboo, and I would like to know from [German soccer chief] Bernd Neuendorf and Gianni Infantino.”\n\nWhile Göttlich cited the 1980 Olympic boycott of Moscow following their invasion of Afghanistan, a far better historical comparison comes from his own backyard: the 1936 Berlin Olympics. Hitler used these games to normalize his Nazi regime and project himself as a leader among world leaders. We can, of course, look back at that Olympics and revel in classic sports moments like Jesse Owens winning four gold medals and ruining Hitler’s dreams of Aryan supremacy.\n\nBut the deeper story of those games is the shameful decision of countries to travel to Berlin to play for the entertainment of their fascist hosts in the first place. This is not hindsight. There were explosive debates across the globe, particularly the United States, about competing in a Germany already imprisoning dissidents and Jews, burning books, and building a military arsenal for territorial expansion. Organizations like the NAACP agitated for a US boycott. The Amateur Athletic Union, by a sliver of a vote, ignored their pleas as well as the arguments of others and sent US athletes to compete. These decisions now look obscene. Göttlich is offering countries a way to avoid being depicted as cowards, quislings, or villains in the eyes of history. Countries should boycott the World Cup games scheduled to be played in the United States. Ten months ago, they needed to do it for the safety of their own fans. Now they must act for the safety of the rest of us.\n\nOne last note: I went to college in the Twin Cities. I still have many friends in the area. My anger at watching Trump send killers to fill the streets of Minneapolis is personal, but the people there have bravely shown that such state violence will be met with a response. Minnesotans aren’t Gianni Infantino. Their backs are not bent, and if you ask them to kiss Trump’s ring, they will bite that finger to the bone.",

    "description": "Data Consistency is simply a need to keep data consistent within a particular boundary and time. There are two main scopes ... Local data is immediately consistent - there are no delays, it appears either in its final form or not at all. In the global scope however, things look totally different.",
    "fullText": "Data Consistency is simply a need to keep data consistent within a particular boundary and time. There are two main scopes:\n\nAll systems that persist data deal with the first data consistency scope, local to module/service. It might seem obvious, but it is worth stating clearly and openly, as it is the fundamental building block from which global, system-wide data consistency is constructed. And interestingly, if our system consists of a monolith with just one module, or there are multiple but totally independent modules, not exchanging any data, we deal solely with this simpler, local scope.\n\nLocal data consistency always operates within a single data source of one module or service. Let's say that we use a relational database, creating the task assigned to two human workers as:\n\nThis operation is fully atomic and immediate; task and its workers are created at once or nothing happens, neither task nor its workers are there. There are no intermediate cases. We can also have a document-based version:\n\nSame effect, different technology - atomic creation of a task with assigned workers, since they all live in a single document. Local data is immediately consistent - there are no delays, it appears either in its final form or not at all.\n\nIn the global data consistency scope however, things look totally different - let's see how & why.\n\nTo illustrate it better, let's complicate our task and workers flow a bit; adding state and two timestamps to the task-worker association:\n\nLet's also say that we have two independent services:\n\nNow, after creating the task with initial task-worker associations, task-service must somehow synchronize this state with worker-service, in a transactional way. Meaning, there cannot be a situation where a task with REQUESTED workers was created, but worker-service never learned about this fact and did not give workers a chance to respond to such profitable requests. How might this guarantee be provided? What problems lie ahead?\n\nThe most important fact to note is that both services are independent processes, separately deployed and split by the network; they have their own, isolated data stores as well. We are about to fail miserably, if our implementation idea is as follows:\n\nWhat is stored in task-service DB is completely independent of the worker-service state. Crucially, we could have workers accept or reject a task that does not exist. If suddenly task-service goes down, after getting responses from worker-service and the transaction fails to commit. It might likewise fail, if there is a temporary problem with the network or database. Especially considering the fact that awaitWorkerResponses method makes HTTP requests that could take up to 30 seconds; it is not a good idea to execute such blocking calls inside database transactions.\n\nWhat is the solution? Is it really a (distributed) transaction?\n\nCases of this kind, at first glance looking like (distributed) transactions, can often be designed and thought of as long-running processes. What is the difference?\n\nWith transactions, we require atomicity and immediate visibility of all or no changes:\n\nIt is simple and works beautifully, but only within the scope of a single database instance that stores all data in one place. It breaks down instantly, when we need to synchronize state across multiple modules/services and their independent data stores. Let's redesign our tasks with workers into a long-running process and see how it solves these issues.\n\nThe process is now more complex but is resilient and robust - every possible failure scenario is correctly dealt with. Crucially, it consists of all common patterns & techniques seen in the long-running processes that deliver eventual data consistency globally, across various modules/services:\n\nLet's analyze it in more detail; there are many interesting things going on here.\n\nFirst, there is the create task + initial task workers assignment transaction, local to task-service. Simple, atomic, always works as expected. Then, we must have a way to trigger assignment of workers in worker-service. Scheduled task-workers-synchronizer job runs a few times per second and it:\n\nThis scheduled job guarantees that for each task - required number of workers will eventually be requested and the late ones will not be considered any longer. To actually assign workers and make them work, worker-service must handle it properly.\n\nIn worker-service, we mainly consume TaskWorkerRequested events and:\n\nThat is what mostly worker-service does - knows the details of workers availability and can interact with them, in real time.\n\nLet's go back to task-service - it now is about to consume WorkerTaskAccepted and WorkerTaskRejected events. In both cases:\n\nAnother important detail worth pointing out in the whole process is concurrency - there is the scheduled job, that might run in a few instances, and multiple event publishers and consumers often work and modify the same data as well. To make it behave correctly, we must control concurrency by locking properly.\n\nThat is a lot of details and changes compared to a single (distributed) transaction; but, the process is now not only truly resilient and robust, it also is more flexible and extensible. For example, we could add monitoring of task workers - are they really working on assigned tasks? If not, we can introduce the ABANDONED state and set it where & when appropriate. If a task is executed too slowly, more workers might be assigned to it and so on - there is a great deal of flexibility here.\n\nAs we saw, long-running processes are in many ways different from transactions. Local transactions, in the scope of a single module/service, guarantee immediate consistency. All changes either take place and are immediately visible after commit or - we rollback and nothing changes, data remains in the before transaction state.\n\nLong-running processes on the other hand, consist of multiple local transactions that take place in different modules/services; they are coordinated through events/requests, sent asynchronously in the background. Because of that, data is eventually consistent, not immediately - it cannot be immediate, since we modify something that lives in various copies and formats, and is owned by different components. Naturally then, there are unavoidable delays & intermediate states in these processes we must accept. In our working example, task and TO_REQUESTED task workers are created first. After some time (short, but still), the scheduled job runs and publishes related events - this is the first delay. Then, another service must receive and process these events - second delay. And this is how it works, this is the nature of long-running processes: resilient, transparent and flexible, but some delays and temporary inconsistencies are always there as a feature, not a bug.\n\nIs there maybe something resembling local transactions more, but providing global data consistency guarantees? Well, there is the Two-phase commit (2PC) protocol; unfortunately, it has many flaws. How it works on the high level:\n\nEventual consistency is still there, it is unavoidable - neither commit nor rollback message could be received at exactly the same time by all participants; even if only milliseconds-long, delay is still there. It is a fundamental network & physics limitation - immediate consistency is possible to achieve only in the single node context. What is more, the 2PC approach is blocking and requires all participants to be online and responsive throughout the whole process; if any of them goes down, either everything must be stopped and rolled back or - there are significant delays and locking.\n\nDelays are an inherent and unavoidable aspect of distributed systems nature - we cannot nor should try to escape it. It is much wiser to embrace this reality and design robust solutions aligned with it - explicitly handling and presenting intermediate states & eventual consistency, instead of pretending they do not exist.\n\nThe Saga Pattern is just a more sophisticated name for long-running processes of the kind we have worked on, throughout the example. It is a more standardized way to coordinate a few local transactions between multiple modules/services, taking all possible execution paths and state transitions into consideration. Compared to our example, a couple of things are generalized here.\n\nThe core building block of any Saga (process) is the modify state & notify others about the change action - it must be transactional, absolutely. If it is not, instead of eventual consistency we will have an indeterminate one. The common generalization of what we did in our example - sending events for all task workers in a certain state, created previously in a transaction - is the Outbox Pattern. It is not magic, it is just a more universal way of storing events/requests to be sent later on, in the background, and then actually sending them and synchronizing related state with the database. As an alternative, there is the Change Data Capture (CDC) approach - listening to changes on the database level and doing something - publishing events, sending requests - with those changes. It is more generic, but also lower level and often tightly coupled to a specific database. Whatever strategy we choose for this crucial action, there must be a hard guarantee that when the state changes, other Saga participants are always notified about this change (eventually).\n\nAnother crucial part of Sagas are compensations: they handle state transitions in case of failures, at any possible step of the process. Opposite to simple database transactions, they are not general but concrete and specific to the process. Why is it so? Sagas operate on the higher abstraction level - reversing them means rolling back one or a few already committed database transactions. To make it crystal clear, let's work on another example:\n\nAs we see, pretty elaborate state transitions are coordinated between services purely by publishing and reacting to specific events. The main idea here: design a process such that its state can be correctly resolved at any stage, irrespective of the outcome. How and what exactly happens at each state transition is specific to the process, but in the end, it always synchronizes through a carefully planned sequence of events, commands and requests.\n\nThis brings us to the last crucial aspect of Sagas - state coordination strategies, choreography and orchestration. We know choreography already - that essentially was our example: state coordinated in a decentralized way by the process participants (services) themselves, without any central component. It does not require any additional infrastructure components, other than having some way to exchange data through events; although idempotent HTTP requests, executed in the background, work fine as well. But, as the Saga gets more complex, with a growing number of states and possible transitions between them, it becomes rather messy and hard to wrap one's head around - this is where orchestration comes to the rescue. In this approach, there is a centralized orchestrator/coordinator. It holds the current saga state, listens to all impactful events and issues appropriate commands/requests. Since it is centralized, it requires changing events flow to be more command/request-oriented. Adapting our example to this strategy, on OrderCreated event, Saga Coordinator creates saga state. Then, it publishes something like a ReserveInventoryCommand; inventory-service listens to it and issues ReserveInventoryResult in response. Saga Coordinator listens to this event as well and publishes CancelOrderCommand or PreparePaymentCommand, depending on the previous command result. These commands are then handled by order-service or payment-service respectively.\n\nAnd so the orchestration goes - essentially, every state transition of the process goes through and is coordinated by the coordinator/orchestrator. It consumes all required events and issues commands/requests to synchronize every process participant accordingly; knowing the current, global process state, the coordinator is fully responsible for keeping it coherent as a whole. Since the state is now centralized, it is often easier to reason about and design more complex flows; auditability of the current process stage/step is another benefit - but it all requires having this additional component to manage. Crucially, if the coordinator is down and not available, Sagas do not work; it constitutes a single point of failure. But for more complex data flows, it definitely is worth its tradeoffs.\n\nAs we have seen, immediate data consistency is achievable only locally, in the context of a single module/service, using one particular data store. Once we transition into the realm of multiple modules/services, taking advantage of many various data stores, a different approach must be taken.\n\nAs we have also learned, delays and the resulting eventual consistency lie at the very heart of the distributed systems nature; it is much wiser to embrace this reality, rather than trying to fight and resist it. That is why long-running processes (Sagas) work so well: they encourage us to design our processes as a sequence of independent and compensable steps, with clear boundaries and explicitly defined transitions. Delays and eventual consistency are treated as first-class citizens here; we cleanly and openly move between process steps. Each of them may take however long it needs to complete, explicitly informing about its current state.\n\nIn summary, true transactions are possible only locally; globally, we must embrace delays and eventual consistency as fundamental laws of nature. What follows is designing and building resilient systems, handling this reality openly and gracefully; they might be synchronizing constantly, but always arriving at the same conclusion, eventually.",

    "description": "England centre Meg Jones targets the first women's Lions tour in 2027 and back-to-back World Cups in 2029 as she sets new rugby goals.",
    "fullText": "In the months after England finally achieved their World Cup dream, centre Meg Jones wondered what challenges remained in her rugby career.\n\nJones, who was the team's vice-captain, was nominated for the player of the tournament award after a series of standout displays in the Red Roses' march to an emotional triumph.\n\n\"After the World Cup, I thought that was it, like I've won it now, I've won rugby. What more is there to do?\" Jones told BBC Sport.\n\n\"The comedown was surreal. Obviously there was good stuff, but you also get massively overwhelmed. It's crazy the adrenaline and all the highs you're on.\n\n\"So I was a bit like, what's going to make me drive, and what's going to create the spark again?\"\n\nIn January, at the Red Roses' first get-together since lifting the World Cup in September, head coach John Mitchell provided that spark.\n\nThe New Zealander challenged his World Cup winners to take their games to new levels to give themselves the best possible chance of making the squad for the historic British and Irish Lions women's tour in 2027.\n\n\"Mitch is unbelievable the way he thinks,\" added Jones, who was awarded an MBE in the New Year Honours list. \"The passion and drive just radiates off him.\n\n\"I'm feeling more motivated now, that there's something that we can keep pushing on for.\n\n\"I'm only 29 and it's given a bit of spring to my step.\n\n\"Playing for the Lions is not something I've ever dreamed of really. I've played for Great Britain at the Olympics so I understand that whole camaraderie, bringing all the nations together, and I love that side of things. It's exciting, for sure.\"\n\nEngland have dominated the Women's Six Nations, winning 21 of the 30 editions, and will start their bid for a fifth successive Grand Slam in April.\n\nBut the Red Roses have only won three World Cups to New Zealand's six and have never won two in a row, something Mitchell wants his players to rectify.\n\n\"We had a lot of young girls in that squad who were probably going 'wow, I'm feeling fresh' but the rest of the girls were like 'we've just won a World Cup, we've never done back to back, so what's going to really drive us to do that?' said Jones.\n\n\"Even just looking at the trophy, the amount of times New Zealand's name is on there, you're like, 'I want to override that a little bit'. I want to be part of that legacy.\"",

    "description": "The situation is part of a larger trend.",
    "fullText": "Rising sea levels are slowly and quietly reshaping coastlines, threatening communities built along and around them. One institution, the Pā'ia Youth & Cultural Center, is relocating.\n\nHawaiʻi Journalism Initiative reported that officials are planning to rebuild the center farther inland.\n\nThe Pāʻia Youth & Cultural Center is located near Baldwin Beach Park on Maui's North Shore. The park itself has endured repeated flooding and shoreline retreat.\n\nGlobally, ocean levels are rising, and storms are growing stronger, largely due to rising global temperatures. The sea level in Hawaiʻi has risen five inches since 1970, according to the State of Hawaiʻi Climate Change Portal.\n\nBenjamin Rachunas, the managing director of the center, says that time is of the essence, per the news report. While programs haven't been affected just yet, he noted that: \"Fast-forward 10 years, it's going to be a problem.\"\n\nThe situation is part of a larger trend of coastal erosion and flooding events threatening homes, schools, roads, and livelihoods across the Pacific and beyond. This slow-moving crisis is being fueled by the burning of coal, oil, and gas, and global temperature increases.\n\nDistant events also add pressure. In Greenland, scientists found that extreme ice melt episodes have nearly doubled in recent decades, accelerating sea level rise. Meanwhile, the Arctic has seen more frequent marine heat waves, which melt sea ice faster. These global changes driven by human activity contribute to rising seas that can affect communities like Pā'ia.\n\nCoastal communities have had to adapt to their new normal of experiencing coastal flooding from time to time. The Hawaiʻi Climate Change Portal noted that the state only experienced two instances of flooding due to high tide between 1970 and 1980. Between 2010 and 2020, there were 40 flood days.\n\nFlooding, saltwater intrusion, and erosion undermine local economies and displace entire neighborhoods. In coastal states like Hawaiʻi, Florida, and Louisiana, billions of dollars in property and cultural heritage are at risk as the ocean continues to creep inland and flood cities.\n\nIn Maui, plans are moving forward to relocate the youth center while developing long-term adaptation measures such as elevated activity spaces and \"breakaway walls\" to let water through when needed, per the news report. The youth center will be raising funds that will make it flood-ready, lessening potential damage to the structure.\n\nGlobally, scientists emphasize that reducing the burning of oil, coal, and gas is essential to slowing this phenomenon. Shifting toward cleaner, more affordable energy sources can help limit temperature increases and ease pressure on vulnerable coastlines.\n\nDo you think America could ever get all of its power from clean energy?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nOn a personal level, some of the best long-term steps include improving household resilience, staying informed about coastal risks, and learning more about critical environmental issues.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

The closure of the U.S. Agency for International Development last year and a drop in ⁠allocations from other developed countries has already hit ​developing economies, especially in Africa.\n\nOnce 2025 data becomes ​available, it is likely to show a large drop in Official Development Assistance flows, said McNair.\n\nHe said the trend was \"a net negative\" for ‍African nations, as many ⁠governments face difficulties funding public services and investment - but would at the same time promote domestic accountability as governments rely less on external financing.\n\nThe ⁠report also highlighted a broader decline in bilateral finance flows and private external debt - also trends likely ‌to be exacerbated by aid cuts from 2025 onwards.\n\n(Reporting Colleen Goko; ‌editing by Karin Strohecker and Kevin Liffey)",

    "fullText": "Former FIFA president Sepp Blatter on Monday backed a proposed fan boycott of World Cup matches in the United States because of the conduct of President Donald Trump and his administration at home and abroad.\n\nBlatter was the latest international soccer figure to call into question the suitability of the United States as a host country. He called for the boycott in a post on X that supported Mark Pieth's comments in an interview last week with the Swiss newspaper Der Bund.\n\nPieth, a Swiss attorney specializing in white-collar crime and an anti-corruption expert, chaired the Independent Governance Committee's oversight of FIFA reform a decade ago. Blatter was president of the world's governing body for soccer from 1998-2015; he resigned amid an investigation into corruption.\n\nIn his interview with Der Bund, Pieth said, “If we consider everything we’ve discussed, there’s only one piece of advice for fans: Stay away from the USA! You’ll see it better on TV anyway. And upon arrival, fans should expect that if they don’t please the officials, they’ll be put straight on the next flight home. If they’re lucky.”\n\nIn his X post, Blatter quoted Pietha and added, “I think Mark Pieth is right to question this World Cup.”\n\nThe United States is co-hosting the World Cup with Canada and Mexico from June 11-July 19.\n\nThe international soccer community's concerns about the United States stem from Trump's expansionist posture on Greenland, travel bans and aggressive tactics in dealing with migrants and immigration enforcement protestors in American cities, particularly Minneapolis.\n\nOke Göttlich, one of the vice presidents of the German soccer federation, told the Hamburger Morgenpost newspaper in an interview on Friday that the time had come to seriously consider boycotting the World Cup.\n\nTwo weeks ago, travel plans for fans from two of the top soccer countries in Africa were thrown into disarray when the Trump administration announced a ban that would effectively bar people from Senegal and Ivory Coast from following their teams unless they already have visas. Trump cited “screening and vetting deficiencies” as the main reason for the suspensions.\n\nFans from Iran and Haiti, two other countries that have qualified for the World Cup, will be barred from entering the United States as well; they were included in the first iteration of the travel ban announced by the Trump administration.\n\nAP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nTrinity Rodman has officially put pen to paper, ending months of uncertainty with a record-setting agreement that keeps her with the Washington Spirit through 2028.\n\nTrinity Rodman is now reportedly the highest-paid women's soccer player in the world.\n\nThe 23-year-old forward signed a three-year deal with the Washington Spirit, where she started her career, valued at an estimated $2 million per year, when counting in bonuses.\n\nThe deal comes… pic.twitter.com/8MMmCr1O3p\n\n— PBS News (@NewsHour) January 26, 2026\n\nThe United States forward signed a new three-year contract worth more than $2 million per year, including bonuses, according to multiple reports. The deal makes Rodman the highest-paid player in NWSL history and, per her agent Mike Senkowski, the highest-paid women’s soccer player in the world. The announcement was made at an event in Los Angeles alongside Spirit owner Michele Kang and club executives, while Rodman continues training with the USWNT.\n\nMORE: Athlete cult favorite Jack in the Box announces 75th anniversary streetwear drop\n\n“It feels amazing. I’m very happy, I’m very blessed,” Rodman said after signing. “I think it’s a monumental and game-changing moment right now.” She added that the deal aligns with her long-term vision, calling it “perfect timing with the World Cup happening in the U.S.”\n\nThe agreement closes a chaotic chapter that began when Rodman’s previous contract expired on Dec. 31. Despite being the league’s most recognizable star, she entered the offseason without a deal, fueling speculation that she could leave the National Women's Soccer League entirely. Sources indicated that top clubs abroad — particularly in England — had made lucrative offers that Washington could not match under the league’s salary cap, which stood at $3.5 million per team in 2025.\n\nIn late November, Rodman and the Spirit reportedly reached a creative four-year agreement that would have averaged more than $1 million per season. That proposal was later rejected by the league, with commissioner Jessica Berman ruling that it violated league rules. The NWSL also accused Rodman of attempting to circumvent the cap, prompting the NWSL Players Association to file a grievance on her behalf, calling the intervention a violation of the collective bargaining agreement.\n\nAs the standoff intensified, the league’s board of governors approved a new High Impact Player (HIP) rule in December, allowing teams to exceed the salary cap by up to $1 million for certain star players. Spirit president of soccer operations Haley Carter confirmed that Rodman’s new contract benefited from the implementation of that rule.\n\n“Not only me personally but all of us at the Spirit are profoundly grateful that she has chosen to stay with us,” Kang said, referencing the “very compelling alternatives” Rodman had elsewhere.\n\nMORE: Ex-NFL QB Kellen Mond roasts former head coach: 'Leadership is an atmosphere you create'\n\nRodman, drafted second overall by Washington in 2021, helped deliver the club’s first NWSL championship as a rookie and has remained its centerpiece ever since.",

You’re a C programmer now.\n\nExcept you’re not. You’ve just learned that C is a language where you type things and hope they work. That lesson - hope as a development strategy - will follow you through pointers, memory allocation, and eventually into production systems where hope gets people killed.\n\nThis isn’t hyperbole. The Therac-25 killed patients because of race conditions that “usually worked.” Knight Capital lost $440 million in 45 minutes because of code that “worked in testing.” The traditional C tutorial path doesn’t just fail to prepare engineers for safety-critical work - it actively teaches habits that certification auditors will reject.\n\nThe first line of most C tutorials introduces a function that violates nearly every principle of safety-critical software:\n\nprintf uses dynamic memory. The format string parsing, buffer management, and output handling all involve allocation patterns that cannot be statically analysed for worst-case behaviour.\n\nprintf has unbounded execution time. Depending on the format string, arguments, and output device, the same printf call can take microseconds or seconds. In a system with real-time constraints, this is unacceptable.\n\nprintf can fail silently. Most tutorials ignore the return value. In safety-critical systems, every function call must have its return value checked and its failure modes handled.\n\nprintf teaches output-first thinking. The programmer’s first instinct becomes “print something to see if it worked” rather than “prove it works before running it.”\n\nNone of this means printf is evil. It’s a useful debugging tool and perfectly appropriate for user-facing applications. The problem is that it’s the first thing we teach, and first lessons shape everything that follows.\n\nAfter “Hello World,” tutorials progress to dynamic memory:\n\nThis teaches several dangerous patterns:\n\nMemory size determined at runtime. The program cannot know its memory requirements until execution. Static analysis cannot prove memory bounds. The certifier cannot verify worst-case resource usage.\n\nAllocation can fail. And the tutorial’s “handle error… somehow” comment reveals that nobody really knows what to do when it does. In safety-critical systems, “somehow” isn’t a specification.\n\nManual lifetime management. The programmer must remember to free memory, in the right order, exactly once. Forget and you leak. Free twice and you corrupt. Use after free and you get undefined behaviour.\n\nHeap fragmentation is invisible. A program can run successfully for months, then fail when fragmentation finally prevents allocation. No amount of testing catches this reliably.\n\nFor safety-critical systems governed by DO-178C, IEC 62304, or ISO 26262, dynamic memory allocation is either prohibited entirely or requires extensive justification and analysis. Yet it’s the second thing we teach new C programmers.\n\nThe tutorial might mention this is “a bug,” but it doesn’t explain that this isn’t just wrong - it’s undefined. The C standard permits the compiler to do literally anything: crash, corrupt memory, send your browsing history to your employer, or appear to work perfectly until production.\n\n“Appears to work” is the most dangerous outcome. The off-by-one error might never manifest in testing because the memory after the array happens to be unused. Then in production, with different memory layout, the system fails in ways that cannot be reproduced or diagnosed.\n\nTraditional tutorials treat undefined behaviour as an edge case to avoid. Safety-critical development treats it as an existential threat to be eliminated by design.\n\nEngineers who transition to safety-critical domains discover that everything they learned needs to be unlearned. DO-178C Level A (for flight-critical avionics software) requires:\n\n100% code coverage. Every statement, every branch, every condition must be exercised by tests. Printf debugging doesn’t generate coverage data.\n\nTraceability. Every line of code must trace to a requirement, and every requirement must trace to tests that verify it. “It seemed like a good idea” isn’t traceable.\n\nStatic analysis. Tools must verify that code cannot exhibit undefined behaviour, exceed resource bounds, or enter unanalysable states. Malloc defeats most static analysers.\n\nDeterministic execution. Given the same inputs, the system must produce the same outputs. Always. Dynamic memory allocation introduces non-determinism through fragmentation and allocation timing.\n\nBounded resource usage. Memory, stack depth, and execution time must all have provable upper bounds. Recursion, dynamic allocation, and unbounded loops are prohibited or severely restricted.\n\nThe traditional tutorial path - printf, malloc, hope - is precisely what certification prohibits.\n\nThe approach taught in c-from-scratch inverts the traditional progression:\n\nInstead of starting with syntax and hoping correctness emerges, this methodology starts with correctness and derives syntax.\n\nBefore writing any code, define what problem you’re solving and what failure looks like. Not “I want to track a heartbeat” but “I need to detect when a periodic signal stops arriving within a bounded time, with no false positives during normal jitter and guaranteed detection of actual failures.”\n\nA heartbeat monitor can be expressed as a finite state machine with three states:\n\nThis isn’t pseudocode. It’s a mathematical specification that can be analysed for completeness (all state/input combinations handled), determinism (each combination has exactly one outcome), and termination (no infinite loops possible).\n\nFrom the state machine, we can prove:\n\nTotality: Every state has a defined transition for every input. There are no undefined cases.\n\nConvergence: From any state, the system eventually reaches either ALIVE (if pulses arrive) or DEAD (if they don’t).\n\nBounded memory: The state machine requires exactly one state variable and one timestamp. O(1) memory, provable statically.\n\nBounded time: Each transition is a constant-time operation. O(1) execution, provable statically.\n\nThese proofs exist before any C code is written.\n\nThe struct is not a convenient data container - it’s a physical encoding of the mathematical model:\n\nEvery field exists because the math requires it. There are no “might be useful later” fields. The struct is the state machine.\n\nImplementation becomes mechanical transcription of the mathematical specification:\n\nThis code contains no creativity. It’s a direct translation of the state machine. The creativity happened in the mathematical design, where it could be analysed and proven correct.\n\nTests don’t verify that the code “seems to work.” They verify that the mathematical contracts hold:\n\nEach test corresponds to a mathematical property. If the test fails, either the implementation is wrong or the proof was flawed. Either way, we know exactly what to fix.\n\nThe c-from-scratch framework standardises on a four-function interface for all safety monitors:\n\nStatic allocation. The caller provides memory. The module never allocates.\n\nDeterministic state transitions. All state changes happen in update(). Status queries are pure functions.\n\nComposability. Modules with identical interfaces can be combined, chained, and verified independently.\n\nTestability. Each function has clear preconditions and postconditions that tests can verify.\n\nThis isn’t an arbitrary convention. It’s the minimal interface that supports formal verification while remaining practical for real systems.\n\nThe math-first approach isn’t just for flight software. Consider:\n\nMedical devices: IEC 62304 Class C software (which can cause death or serious injury) has requirements similar to DO-178C. The same methodology applies.\n\nAutomotive: ISO 26262 ASIL-D (highest automotive safety level) requires similar rigour. Self-driving systems need provable behaviour.\n\nFinancial systems: Knight Capital’s $440 million loss came from code that “worked” until it didn’t. Deterministic, provable systems prevent this class of failure.\n\nInfrastructure: Power grids, water treatment, and industrial control systems increasingly require formal methods. The traditional tutorial path doesn’t prepare engineers for this work.\n\nEven in non-safety-critical domains, the discipline pays off. Code designed mathematically is easier to test, easier to maintain, and easier to reason about. The techniques scale down gracefully.\n\nThe first step is recognising that traditional C education optimises for the wrong thing. It optimises for “getting something working quickly” when it should optimise for “knowing why it works.”\n\nThe second step is accepting that correctness requires more upfront effort. Defining invariants before writing code feels slow. It is slow - initially. The time is recovered many times over during testing, debugging, and maintenance.\n\nThe third step is building new habits:\n\nThese habits feel awkward at first. Like all habits, they become automatic with practice.\n\nThe c-from-scratch repository provides a complete framework for learning this approach. Each module includes:\n\nStart with the Pulse module. It’s roughly 200 lines of code, but those 200 lines demonstrate every principle: closed state, total functions, bounded resources, deterministic execution.\n\nFor a structured learning path, “C From Scratch: Learn Safety-Critical C the Right Way” walks through the methodology from first principles, building toward a complete capstone project.\n\n“Hello World” isn’t wrong. It’s just the wrong starting point for engineers who will work on systems that matter.\n\nThe traditional C tutorial path teaches hope-based development: write code, run it, hope it works, debug when it doesn’t. This approach cannot produce software that meets safety certification requirements, and it builds habits that must be painfully unlearned.\n\nThe alternative - proving correctness before implementation - requires more discipline but produces code that can be trusted. When that code controls an aircraft, monitors a pacemaker, or manages a power grid, “can be trusted” isn’t a nice-to-have. It’s the entire point.\n\nAs with any methodology, suitability depends on context. Not every program needs formal verification. But every programmer benefits from understanding what formal verification requires - because it clarifies what “correct” actually means.\n\nHope is not a certification strategy. Mathematics is.\n\nWilliam Murray is a Regenerative Systems Architect with 30 years of UNIX infrastructure experience, specializing in deterministic computing for safety-critical systems.

    "description": "The Maia 200 AI chip is described as an inference powerhouse — meaning it could lead AI models to apply their knowledge to real-world situations much faster and more efficiently.",
    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nMicrosoft has revealed its new Maia 200 accelerator chip for artificial intelligence (AI) that is three times more powerful than hardware from rivals like Google and Amazon, company representatives say.\n\nThis newest chip will be used in AI inference rather than training, powering systems and agents used to make predictions, provide answers to queries and generate outputs based on new data that's fed to them.\n\nMaia 200 is already being deployed in Microsoft's U.S. central data center region, with the company set to use the chips to generate synthetic data and in reinforcement training to improve next-generation large language models (LLMs). The AI accelerator will also be used to power Microsoft Foundry and 365 Copilot AI, and be part of the infrastructure that the company can provide through its Azure cloud platform.\n\nThe new chip delivers performance of more than 10 petaflops (1015 floating point operations per second), Scott Guthrie, cloud and AI executive vice president at Microsoft, said in a blog post. This is a measure of performance in supercomputing, where the most powerful supercomputers in the world can reach more than 1,000 petaflops of power.\n\nThe new chip achieved this performance level in a data representation category known as \"4-bit precision (FP4)\" — a highly compressed model designed to accelerate AI performance. Maia 200 also delivers 5 PFLOPS of performance in 8-bit precision (FP8). The difference between the two is that FP4 is far more energy efficient but less accurate.\n\n\"In practical terms, one Maia 200 node can effortlessly run today’s largest models, with plenty of headroom for even bigger models in the future,\" Guthrie said in the blog post. \"This means Maia 200 delivers 3 times the FP4 performance of the third generation Amazon Trainium, and FP8 performance above Google’s seventh generation TPU.\"\n\nMaia 200 could potentially be used for specialist AI workloads, such as running larger LLMs in the future. So far, Microsoft's Maia chips have only been used in the Azure cloud infrastructure to run large-scale workloads for Microsoft’s own AI services, notably Copilot. However, Guthrie noted there would be \"wider customer availability in the future,\" signaling other organizations could tap into Maia 200 via the Azure cloud, or the chips could potentially one day be deployed in standalone data centers or server stacks.\n\nGuthrie said that Microsoft boasts 30% better performance per dollar over existing systems thanks to the use of the 3-nanometer process made by the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), the most important fabricator in the world, allowing for 100 billion transistors per chip. This essentially means that Maia 200 could be more cost-effective and efficient for the most demanding AI workloads than existing chips.\n\nMaia 200 has a few other features alongside better performance and efficiency. It includes a memory system, for instance, which can help keep an AI model’s weights and data local, meaning you would need less hardware to run a model. It's also designed to be quickly integrated into existing data centers.\n\nMaia 200 should enable AI models to run faster and more efficiently. This means Azure OpenAI users, such as scientists, developers and corporations, could see better throughput and speeds when developing AI applications and using the likes of GPT-4 in their operations.\n\n—'It won’t be so much a ghost town as a zombie apocalypse': How AI might forever change how we use the internet\n\n— GPT-4 has passed the Turing test, researchers claim\n\n—The more advanced AI models get, the better they are at deceiving us — they even know when they're being tested\n\nThis next-generation AI hardware is unlikely to disrupt everyday AI and chatbot use for most people in the short term, as Maia 200 is designed for data centers rather than consumer-grade hardware. However, end users could see the impact of Maia 200 in the form of faster response times and potentially more advanced features from Copilot and other AI tools built into Windows and Microsoft products.\n\nMaia 200 could also provide a performance boost to developers and scientists who use AI inference via Microsoft’s platforms. This, in turn, could lead to improvements in AI deployment on large-scale research projects and elements like advanced weather modeling, biological or chemical systems and compositions.",

    "description": "Quite an advantage in today’s world.",
    "fullText": "Here’s what you’ll learn when reading this story:\n\nChondrichthyan fishes—a group that includes rays, skates, chimaeras, and sharks—are thought to have energy intensive reproduction cycles due in no small part to long gestation times and small litters.\n\nHowever, a new study analyzing the epaulette shark (Hemiscyllium ocellatum) of Australia and New Guinea finds that this species shows no noticeable spike in metabolic rate during reproduction.\n\nThis is good news for both the epaulette shark and the coral reef system, which relies on the species to keep the underwater habitat healthy.\n\nThe epaulette shark (Hemiscyllium ocellatum), which lives off the coast of northern Australia and New Guinea, is a strange creature. For one, it’s the youngest known shark in the world, with genetic evidence suggesting their emergence only nine million years ago. But its true claim to fame is found within its common moniker—this three-foot-long “walking shark” can not only use its thick, muscular fins to explore its coral ecosystem, but it can also traverse above water between coral heads at low tide. Some experts argue that this may suggest that sharks could one day evolve to walk on land.\n\nBut a new study, published in the journal Biology Open, makes an even more puzzling discovery about this fascinating shallow-sea creature. Energy is king in the natural world, and a large driver of evolution is developing strategies to reduce energy expenditure by any means necessary. One of the biggest drains of that energy—as any human mother will tell you—is the physical act of reproduction, but even this immensely energy-intensive task has been remarkably streamlined in the epaulette shark.\n\n“Reproduction is the ultimate investment … you are literally building new life from scratch,”Jodie Rummer, the senior author of the study from James Cook University (JCU), said in a press statement. “We expected that when sharks make this complex egg, their energy use would shoot up.”\n\nThe assumption is that the reproduction cycle of sharks—along with other chondrichthyan fishes such as rays, skates, and chimaeras—are energy-intensive due to small litter sizes and their long gestation periods. The frilled shark (Chlamydoselachus anguineus), for example, holds the record for the longest vertebrate gestation at 3.5 years. To get more data on the energy requirements for shark reproduction, Rummer and her team recorded metabolic and physiological changes in five epaulette sharks during oviparous (egg-laying) reproduction by tracking oxygen uptake and measuring reproductive hormones. The results were not what the scientists expected.\n\n“There was no uptick in energy use, it was completely flat,” Rummer said in a press statement. “These sharks appear to have adapted their physiology to be able to optimize their energy use. This work challenges the narrative that when things go wrong—such as warming oceans—that reproduction will be the first thing to go.”\n\nThis good news expands beyond just epaulette sharks themselves. When animals are under stress, reproduction is often impacted as a means to conserve energy—and there’s no greater stressor than climate change. Luckily, the amazing “walking shark” doesn’t require an immense energy spike for reproduction, suggesting that the shark could continue exploring Australia’s coral reefs even as its waters warm.\n\n“Under environmental stress, many species will choose between survival and reproduction, but the epaulette shark might be able to continue to produce eggs, even under such stressors,” Carolyn Wheeler, the lead author and a recent JCU Ph.D. graduate, said in a press statement. “That’s encouraging, because healthy sharks equal healthy reefs.”\n\nWith any luck, future descendants of the epaulette shark will survive long enough to walk on an Earth where the dangerous effects of anthropogenic climate change are far in the rearview.\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "fullText": "\"One thing that I love about distance racing is the 10-minute victories,\" says Jaime Mack, a few hours into the 2025 Round the County Race.\n\nThis annual two-day event organized by the Orcas Island YC and the Friday Harbor Sailing Club circumnavigates the islands comprising Washington State's San Juan County with a Saturday night stopover in Roche Harbor on San Juan Island. The 65 nautical-mile race regularly attracts triple-digit fleets and unfurls in early November, with even-numbered years rounding clockwise and odd-numbered years taking a counterclockwise course.\n\nThe direction matters, of course, because the waters surrounding the San Juans have notoriously strong currents that can leave a fleet parked up or inverted, especially when someone forgets to ply the wind machine with enough Benjamins. Much like the 2025 race.\n\nI consider Mack's words as we slowly fetch Matia Island, maybe 10 miles into our 34 nautical-mile first leg. While November in the Pacific Northwest is often wet and stormy, and always dark, this particular weekend is a stunner: bluebird skies, sunshine and warm temperatures.\n\nBetter still, our skipper Justin Wolfe has assembled a great crew consisting of Ben and Jen Morgan Glass, and Andy and Jaime Mack aboard Ripple (in still water), his Paul Bieker-designed Riptide 35. We've never sailed together as a crew, and most of us are new to the boat, but Ripple is well-prepared, and our logistics are carefully sorted.\n\nThere are just two hiccups: foul currents and a dearth of breeze.\n\nTake, for example, the first \"chapter\" from the starting area at Lydia Shoal, in Rosario Strait, to Point Lawrence, Orcas Island's northeastern-most point. The smart money, at least temporarily, wagers on the course's western edge, while we find ourselves milking a thin kelp- and rock-dodging breeze that carries us east, then north.\n\nFlash forward two hours, and we're slatting in lumpy waves next to other boats that started with us, temporarily looked smarter, only to be (closely) examining our sheer line or transom at this next restart.\n\nI savor this 10-minute victory, as the rest of the day looks challenging.\n\nThe Round the County Race has a long history of temperamental winds, so the Sailing Instructions require boats to record their times at the legs' halfway points, perchance it becomes impossible to finish the complete legs by the 1800 cutoff.\n\nSuch is our fate aboard Ripple, as it becomes clear by 1430 that our objective is evolving from finishing the leg to fetching the halfway mark by its 1600 deadline.\n\nStill, math is math, and the VHF calls start at around 1530. We aren't happy to announce our own retirement 10 minutes later, but the last 2 miles will be someone else's 10-minute victory.\n\nWe tuck Ripple into its berth three hours later, and the reason for the race's strong local following refocuses: Sailors, bundled in winter jackets, mingle on the docks with libations and victuals. There are a few groans about the day's breeze, of course, but most scuttlebutt that I overhear involves sunshine and warm temperatures. This is my fifth time doing this race, and every year is different, from torrential rains to big breeze to frigid temperatures, but the race is (usually) good sailing, has a laid-back vibe, and the chance to hang with friends in Roche Harbor are-for me-its gravity.\n\nWe nail our boat-end start the following morning, and we assume a windward lane as we reach toward San Juan Island's Hanbury Point. Our A1.5 spinnaker is pulling, and after yesterday, 7 knots of Speed Over Ground feels big.\n\nWe shift gears several times between the J1.5 and the A1.5 and commit to an offshore lane that gives us fine views of San Juan Island's western shoreline. Jibing Ripple's kite is easy in the 10 to 15 knot breeze, and the boat's water-ballast system, combined with our active crew ballasting, keeps us rumbling.\n\nMount Baker's glaciated summit appears as we reach San Juan Island's southern flanks, and, eventually, the leg's halfway point. But as we pass Colville Island, in the Strait of Juan de Fuca, the missing Benjamins again become problematic.\n\nWe push up Rosario Strait, bucking a 2-knot current and hanging onto increasingly fickle fingers of wind with Ripple's A1.5.\n\nMack's words about 10-minute victories play out again as our section of the fleet negotiates Bird Rocks. We opt for a westerly routing, but for a pregnant hour, the smart move looks to have been the easterly line. Jen Morgan Glass, our tactician, and Wolfe work some magic, linking scuffed-up stretches of brine amongst swaths of greasy-looking saline, while the rest of us keep the sails-and mood-trimmed.\n\nOur position, which had been looking bearish, transitions into another 10-minute win, before the bottom falls out. Flow detaches from our foils, and nothing budges our SOG above zeros. Painful.\n\nMountaineers say the final 5 feet are the crux of any climb, and this truism resonates as we stare at the finishing line for what feels like hours. We're talking frisbee range, but bow stems are all that matter.\n\nAnd we're not alone: the nearby fleet compresses, all of us parked, as we rifle through headsails and kites. All options hang limply as the sun slouches west.\n\nWe drift toward the finish line in a tight scrum-cum-rulebook-knowledge-melee. We finally catch the RC's finishing whistle and clear out, making room for others who are still fighting for their final five feet.\n\nThe day's bonnet blue sky fades to black as stars and a waning gibbous moon punctuate our delivery back to the Orcas Island YC. I burrow into my down jacket and consider how celebrating 10-minute victories helps to justify hours of hard work while also distributing the day's dividends more widely across the fleet than mere award-ceremony hardware.\n\nGranted, it would be nice to use some of these dividends to bribe next year's wind machine, but it wouldn't be a full value Round the County Race without restarts, challenging currents, kelp, and the tapping of local knowledge.\n\nBut hey, at least it didn't rain.\n\nThe post The Allure and Agony of Seattle’s Round-the-County appeared first on Sailing World.",

    "fullText": "Last August, we earmarked a handful of young players to have breakout years. Now halfway through the season, how are those picks looking?\n\nIn a world of hot takes and bold predictions, it’s easy to spew incendiary comments without holding yourself accountable. We don’t do that here at Urban Pitch.\n\nPrior to the start of the 2025-26 season, we dropped our customary “Breakout Stars to Watch” list, and it’s about that time to put our predictions under the microscope. We’re just over halfway through a season that has already had so much intrigue, and with so much still to play for, it’s the perfect time to check back in.\n\nSimilar to last year, we’ll pick out the best of the bunch from our initial list, as well as throw in some new names that have firmly made their mark.\n\nLily Yohannes, 18, OL Lyonnes, United States\n\nWe’ll kick it off with maybe the name I’m most proud of. Saying the 18-year-old American Lily Yohannes has shone would be a gross understatement; quite frankly, she deserves all the superlatives. In her first season with one of the giants of women’s football, OL Lyonnes, she hasn’t once looked out of place. She began with a goal and a stellar performance in her debut against Olympique Marseille and hasn’t looked back.\n\nShe’s racked up four goals and four assists in her 18 appearances, which makes her just one off her total G/A tally from last year, and we’re only in January. She’s a sensational player, and at such a tender age, it’s genuinely frightening to think about the kind of ceiling she has (if she even has one).\n\nThe standout moment of the season wasn’t hard to pick; her goal in the UEFA Women’s Champions League against St. Pölten was voted goal of the league phase, and rightfully so. She picked the ball up just inside the opposition half before spotting the goalkeeper off her line and lofting the ball into the back of the net from the edge of the center circle.\n\nGonzalo Garcia, 21, Real Madrid, Spain\n\nSince shining in the Club World Cup over the summer, Gonzalo Garcia began the season slowly, and even had a stint back with Real Madrid’s Castilla U-21 team. Kylian Mbappe’s Ballon d’Or-level play hasn’t helped his case, and like with fellow young striker Endrick, he struggled to break into the team consistently as we thought he might. However, Mbappe’s injury in January saw Garcia get a rare chance, and he made the most of his opportunity.\n\nIn the five-game stretch where he started, Garcia bagged five goals and one assist with a scintillating hat-trick against Real Betis in his first start of that run. It was a brief but telling period that reminded the world just how talented the 21-year-old is. With Mbappe fit once again, there’s no telling how much game time Garcia will see, but with Madrid sending Endrick on loan rather than their homegrown Spaniard, maybe new coach Álvaro Arbeloa has bigger plans for Garcia.\n\nGilberto Mora, 17, Club Tijuana, Mexico\n\nThe U-17 player with the most goals in the world in 2025, Club Tijuana diamond Gilberto Mora continues to take his play to higher levels. His Liga MX Apertura campaign ended with an impressive five goals and one assist in 14 appearances, but it was during the break in the season for the FIFA U-20 World Cup where he truly turned on the shine.\n\nDespite going out in the quarterfinals to Argentina, Mora was one of the tournament’s best players. He bagged three goals and two assists in Mexico’s five matches played, and his performances backed up the numbers. His elite technical ability and eye for a killer pass in the middle of the park are golden attributes, and having only just turned 17 in October, there’s still so much more growth ahead for one of the Americas’ brightest stars.\n\nMichelle Agyemang, 19, Arsenal, England\n\nProbably the most unfortunate update of the list, Michelle Agyemang was on cloud nine after her super showing at the 2025 Women’s EUROs. She began her season with two goal contributions in her opening five games of the WSL season, in which she played with Brighton and Hove Albion on loan from Arsenal. However, a torn ACL while on international duty with England cut her season short, and it’s unclear when she’ll make her return. It’s devastating for the 19-year-old, who will likely lose out on nearly a year of development, but with her temperament and talent, I have a feeling she’ll be back stronger.\n\nLennart Karl, 17, FC Bayern, Germany\n\nWe mentioned Mora had the most U-17 goals in 2025, and the player right behind him was Bayern Munich’s Lennart Karl. He was an unknown quantity to most at the beginning of the year, but his performances on the biggest stage have made him a household name.\n\nHis stunner against Club Brugge made him the youngest player to score for FC Bayern in a Champions League game, and he’s since gone on to add two more to that tally this season in back-to-back games. With additional stellar performances against Arsenal and Sporting, Karl also became the youngest player to score in three consecutive UEFA Champions League matches.\n\nAdd that to his four goals and two assists in the Bundesliga, and you’ve got a breakout senior campaign to remember for Bayern’s young phenom.\n\nStill only 21 years old, Nico Paz has played a major role in Como’s resurgence in Serie A since being promoted in 2024. After a solid 2024-25 campaign that represented his first full season of senior football, Paz taken things to even loftier heights under Cesc Fabregas in 2025-26. Paz already has eight goals and six assists this season, only one off his goal contributions for the entirety of last year, and while he’s not a new commodity to clued-in European football fans, I still think he isn’t spoken about enough in the conversations around Europe’s best young players.",

    "fullText": "Man, it is a really weird time in the software world right now. Like a lot of people, when I picked up ChatGPT and Midjourney back in late 2022. It felt like wizardry.\n\nFor a year I experimented and experimented. I wrote about how Midjourney responds to emojis and even tried to see if I could write a children’s book with AI. The output here looks pretty rough today, but it was a revelation at the time. And the AI tools just kind of gradually got better and better.\n\nOne thing that never really clicked for me though was agentic coding. The vision is that you tell an LLM what you want, and it just goes off and executes it. It never really worked that well. It felt like the agents just kind of plowed through code and broke a bunch of stuff on the way to making the fix I wanted. Coding agents were more a curiosity, not something I could actually use.\n\nHowever, this is all about to change. And it is going to change everything about how software is built.\n\nI was drawn back by a post called Welcome to Gas Town by Steve Yegge.\n\nGas Town is part visionary, part performance art. It’s a Mad Max-themed fever dream that enables agents, managing agents, managing agents. There’s a mayor, rigs, polecats, a deacon and a refinery—and they all work together in this vast factory where vibes go in and code comes out.\n\nThere’s a lot of really clever ideas that somewhat mesh together. You’ve probably heard about the context window LLMs have. Essentially it’s their short-term memory. Once an agent uses about 20% of its context window, its intelligence drops off a cliff and it starts doing insane things like dropping databases.\n\nGas Town employs a trick to manage that issue. It assigns tasks to ephemeral “Polecat” agents. Polecats do a task and then disappear—basically removing the challenge of managing context windows.\n\nMaggie Appleton articulated the value of Gas Town well:\n\nWe should take Yegge’s creation seriously not because it’s a serious, working tool for today’s developers (it isn’t). But because it’s a good piece of speculative design fiction that asks provocative questions and reveals the shape of constraints we’ll face as agentic coding systems mature and grow.\n\nAnd so, intrigued by Gas Town, I decided to try vibe coding again.\n\nI’m not the type to just dip my toes in. If I’m going to do something, I do a cannonball.\n\nI’m always looking for the meta. What is the best strategy and who knows how to execute it? I read that Anthropic’s CTO keeps five agents running constantly and barely looks at the actual files. Either that’s marketing or there must be something there, or maybe both?\n\nI read a bunch of articles and watched a ton of YouTube videos. YouTube was pretty wild. There are these videos with guys streaming 5-10 Claude Code terminals, blaring EDM (lol) and managing all these agents.\n\nI’m kind of poking fun, but I actually learned a lot about setup from that BridgeMind channel. If you’re interested I might start with his videos about Warp and the OpenCode CLI.\n\nI wanted to see how well these agents actually work, but I needed an easy entry point. A Chrome extension to restyle Hacker News seemed perfect. It’s been in my backlog for a while, and because it’s purely frontend, I knew I’d be comfortable judging the output.\n\nAnd honestly it was. Initially I tried to one-shot the thing and—as I expected—that was a failure. But then I decided to slow down. I told the agent to scaffold a chrome extension to restyle Hacker News pages. It worked. And I kind of just broke up these tasks into smaller pieces. Tested them as I went.\n\nSure there were bugs. But I kind of just did what I do when I’m reviewing any engineers’ code. Inspect the DOM, look at the styles, look at the console and then give feedback. When the context window hit’s 20% I typically close that window and open a new chat. The OpenCode CLI even allows you to drop screenshots. It’s pretty wild.\n\nNow, I don’t have a dozen agents running at the same time. I never felt the need to have more than two working. And I’m honestly not sure how UI work even gets shipped in Gas Town? My guess is Yegge is probably a lot less concerned with UX than I am.\n\nWith AI agents, the last mile—that final polish and detailing—will be critical. We already see this in Salesloft, where sellers review generative emails before sending. In design, it manifests as small UI tweaks. It will be something else for doctors and something else for mechanical engineers. But I think there is a real opportunity in refining how humans interact with the agent’s output, creating better loops for feedback and adjustment.\n\nYou know what? There’s something here though. I don’t really like the term “vibe coding.” And I know the concept is polarizing. But after tinkering with this stuff for a couple days—I think agents are about to change how we build software.\n\nThe conception of what it looks like to make software is going to change pretty quickly.\n\nThe three major functions on a delivery team (or feature team) are engineering, design and product management. I’ve long thought we’re going to start to see more overlap in those functions. I’m even more sure of it now.\n\nI think we’re going to start to see a hybrid role emerge—product engineer.\n\nWhat does this mean delivery teams will look like in the future? I imagine they are either significantly smaller or significantly more productive. I’m not sure if QA is embedded into these teams the same way they are currently or if there is a separate team of—well, people managing QA agents. I have a lot of questions.\n\nThis also makes me think a lot about Ben Thompson’s theory on bundling and unbundling. From 2010 to 2015, companies quickly moved on the back of frameworks. First like Ruby on Rails and Bootstrap. Then on other technologies like Angular and React. The speed these frameworks provided caused an unbundling in the software world.\n\nPoint solutions were able to move fast and gather steam while slow incumbents either weren’t nimble enough or weren’t in a place to capitalize on the productivity provided by frameworks. Starting in 2016, that changed. Customers were overwhelmed with choices. Larger companies caught on and smaller ones consolidated into larger platforms.\n\nI think that’s about to shift again. And probably this year.\n\nDavid Cummings called it out in his newsletter this weekend. SaaS companies are about to see a massive wave of new competition. And it is going to happen extremely fast. The bar to build software has been lowered. A two-person team will soon be able to build what used to take a whole department.\n\nThis puts incumbent software companies in a pretty dangerous situation. Those that are not able to be nimble and go fast are going to be in real trouble. I think this is especially true in the consumer, SMB and mid-market segments. Enterprise software may have some buffer as customers of enterprise software are buying a process more than the software itself.\n\nHonestly, it makes me a little nervous. The industry is going to change and everyone’s jobs are going to look a little different—product design included.\n\nBut as someone who got into software just because I wanted to make things, this is a dream come true. I’m seeing a glimpse of the vision I hoped for in 2022. It’s not just a toy anymore. It’s an unbelievable tool for builders.\n\nIf you’ve been ignoring AI tools because you think they are overhyped, or maybe don’t see how they fit into your workflow. I’d encourage you to give them another look.",

    "description": "For a long time the question has been asked: if China decides to invade Taiwan, can it be stopped by the US?",
    "fullText": "For a long time the question has been asked: if China decides to invade Taiwan, can it be stopped by the US?\n\nIn short, is the US still the world’s sole superpower, able to dictate terms to Beijing even just off the China coast – or can the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) now bring the long-standing “Pax Americana”, the rules-based international order, to a conclusive end?\n\nWe may find out quite soon now, even as Sir Keir Starmer travels to Beijing this week to break bread with Xi Jinping. Last week, away from the slopes of Davos and largely unnoticed outside the shipping industry, the geopolitical order shifted significantly. A bulk cargo ship named Winning Youth arrived in China carrying 200,000 tons of iron ore.\n\nBig cargoes of iron ore arrive in China all the time, of course, to feed the nation’s enormous appetite for primary steel. Normally, however, the ore comes from Australia (64pc) or Brazil (the other major supplier at 22pc).\n\nThe Winning Youth’s cargo was different. It was the first to be shipped from the enormous Simandou deposits in Guinea, West Africa. The ship departed from the Conakry anchorage on Dec 2.\n\nThe Simandou mines, the associated rail line to the coast, and the specially built barge port on the Morébaya river estuary from which the ore is loaded aboard ships in the anchorage, are a massive joint project.\n\nThis has complex finances, but according to analysis house Drewry: “Chinese entities collectively have the largest strategic influence across the entire project through both mine ownership and shared control of the rail-port infrastructure. China is the largest combined strategic stakeholder.”\n\nThe Simandou project is not yet properly online: it took three weeks to get the Winning Youth fully loaded, much longer than it will take to load a bulker once the railway and the barge terminal are up to full capacity. (The mine isn’t really a bottleneck: it’s more a matter of simply scooping ore up and putting it in railway cars rather than mining as generally understood.)\n\nBut Simandou is expected to ramp up fast over the next few years, perhaps shipping 120 million tons annually in the near term. It’s also expected that most – if not all – of that ore will go to China.\n\nThat matters, because Australian control over the bulk of China’s iron ore supply is often thought to be one of the factors holding Xi Jinping back from an active military campaign to conquer Taiwan. Australia would surely cease shipments of ore in response to such a campaign, and the damage to China’s enormous industries would be colossal.\n\nHowever, not many years from now, this would have much less effect as massive amounts of ore would still be shipping from Simandou. As the shape of the world’s cargo routes changes, so too will the calculus of power in the Taiwan Strait.\n\nConfrontation in the strait is in fact already under way, with Chinese military manoeuvres there now so menacing that the “Fourth Taiwan Strait Crisis” is deemed to have been going on since 2022.\n\nThis is the background to Sir Keir’s visit to Beijing this week. Accompanied by British business leaders, his trip is reportedly aimed at restoring the “golden era” of Sino-British trade and investment seen under Theresa May.\n\nThe Starmer Government’s eagerness to woo China was apparent in its decision days ago to allow the new Chinese “super embassy” in London to go ahead – a decision described in The Telegraph by former Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith as “a humiliating sell-out”.\n\nBritish messaging is mixed, however. Last week the nuclear-powered attack submarine HMS Anson arrived at Gibraltar. Gibraltar is the submarine’s first stop on her way to Australia, where she will probably spend at least six months based out of Perth as part of Submarine Rotational Force West.\n\nSRF-West is the first stage of the Australia-UK-US “Aukus” agreement, which will evolve into a tri-national force of nuclear attack boats based at Perth, and the infrastructure in Australia and the UK which will build and support them.\n\nSince Anson is probably the only serviceable attack submarine in the Royal Navy at the moment, and with the Russian threat in the Atlantic ever more present, it is clear that the Government is placing a very high priority indeed on Aukus.\n\nThe whole point of Aukus, of course, is to confront China’s growing power in the Pacific.\n\nMainland China refuses to have diplomatic relations with any nation which recognises Taiwan as independent.\n\nDiplomats, at least, believe that diplomatic relations with China are essential – although in the case of the UK the result appears to be a large piece of Chinese territory in central London occupied by a massive CCP spy fortress. Only a few small nations recognise Taiwan as independent, probably the best known being the Vatican.\n\nQuite a lot of nations, however, take an “ambiguous” stance towards Taiwanese independence. They have diplomatic relations with China, embassies and all, and they do not formally recognise Taiwan’s nationhood.\n\nThey do not have embassies in Taipei and Taiwan does not have embassies in their capitals, but there are people and buildings that do much the same thing.\n\nThe UK, for instance, has the British Office in Taipei, staffed by Foreign Office employees who would be diplomats if they were accredited as such.\n\nTaiwan has a similar “Taipei Representative Office” in Belgravia. There is a parking space across the street with “diplomats” painted on it, for all that the representatives in the office are – officially – not diplomats, which somewhat gives away the British Government’s real stance.\n\nRather more importantly, the entire US policy towards Taiwan has always been one of “strategic ambiguity”. What this has actually tended to mean, however, is fairly firm and evident American backing for Taiwanese independence and democracy.\n\nDuring the run up to the 1996 election in Taiwan, for instance, China made a serious attempt to frighten the Taiwanese into voting for the pro-Beijing candidate. More than 100,000 troops were mustered on the mainland side of the strait and amphibious invasion exercises took place.\n\nChina also fired ballistic missiles into Taiwanese territorial waters, causing enough upset that merchant shipping ceased using the strait twice and maritime insurance rates for Taiwan increased significantly.\n\nThis sabre-rattling, however, was largely negated by the arrival of two US aircraft carrier groups and other naval elements.\n\nThat confrontation is nowadays known as the Third Taiwan Strait Crisis (the first two, in the 1950s, involved artillery bombardments from the mainland against outlying Taiwan-controlled islands).\n\nChinese air and naval power was fairly negligible in the mid-1990s, a fact that was illustrated by the carrier USS Nimitz twice cruising through the strait along with various other US warships. The pro-Beijing candidate in Taiwan got less than 15pc of the vote.\n\nEver since then, the US military has assumed that a fight against China would be likely, with its traditional Cold War foe Russia relegated to second place.\n\nThis makes sense: the Chinese economy is now no less than 20 times the size it was in the mid-1990s and the CCP’s defence budget is the second biggest in the world, much bigger than that of Russia even with Vladimir Putin’s new war economy.\n\nNeedless to say, Chinese air and naval power are no longer negligible. Indeed, by count of warships the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) is actually bigger than the US Navy, though America for the moment still has a considerable advantage in terms of overall tonnage and missile launch tubes – probably more important numbers.\n\nMeanwhile the People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) now has hundreds of fifth-generation stealth fighters and more than 100 long-range strategic bombers able to mount devastating missile strikes against enemy fleets and bases far away.\n\nProbably more significantly still, the People’s Liberation Army Rocket Force (PLARF) – this is a separate arm of service in China – does not only have intercontinental nuclear missiles.\n\nIt also has more than 3,000 shorter-ranging ballistic, hypersonic and cruise missiles able to strike targets with conventional warheads at great distances. In particular, US bases in Guam, Japan and South Korea are threatened, and if US warships in the region can be located and tracked, they can potentially be sunk.\n\nThe US military ought nonetheless to be enormously more powerful than China’s. US nominal GDP is still half again that of China, and crucially the US spends proportionally more on defence, or as the new administration prefers to put it, on “war”: 3.4pc to China’s 1.7pc. America’s colossal military spending, approaching $1tn a year, is roughly triple that of China.\n\nBut that isn’t the whole picture. Both China and the US mostly make their own armaments and recruit from their own labour markets: and the cost of Chinese-made weapons, planes, ships, etc, is much lower than US-made ones. Chinese soldiers, sailors and airmen are much cheaper than Americans.\n\nThis cost difference is illustrated by the fact that China’s vast shipbuilding industry, far and away the biggest in the world, built warships of a combined tonnage equal to the entire Royal Navy in just the four years up to 2025 and this rate is accelerating. American shipyards, so expensive that they can mostly win business only from the Pentagon, are struggling even to replace existing US warships as they wear out – let alone expand the fleet.\n\nComparisons like this explain the fact that on a purchasing-power parity basis, as opposed to nominal GDP, the Chinese economy is actually a third again bigger than the US.\n\nThis suggests that in terms of buying and hiring power the American war department only enjoys a 50pc advantage, rather than a three-fold one.\n\nThen there is the fact that a battle in the vicinity of Taiwan would see US forces operating at long range from their bases and the Chinese close to theirs.\n\nIn the scenario of an amphibious invasion by China, a US Navy attack submarine – or perhaps an allied Aukus one, HMS Anson or one of her successors – might well slip past or fight through relatively unpracticed PLAN anti-submarine forces and into the Taiwan Strait.\n\nParts of the strait are too shallow for a nuclear attack boat, but this would still be a fox-in-the-henhouse event for the invasion fleet: the sub’s torpedoes and missiles would take a fearful toll of the Chinese amphibious forces. The submarine might well survive to escape once it was out of weapons.\n\nBut if such a submarine were part of the Aukus force at Perth, it would then have a journey of 4,000 miles back to base to re-arm itself, and then another equally long voyage to get back into the fight.\n\nThe sub captain might head instead for a closer US base such as Guam, but this would still be nearly 2,000 miles away. The boat might then arrive only to find the base knocked out, or might be sunk at the jetty by long-ranging Chinese strikes.\n\nMeanwhile, a Chinese warship near Taiwan would be only briefly absent if it needed to resupply, meaning that each Chinese ship would deliver a lot more combat power than an equivalent US or allied one. The US president might choose to strike Chinese bases on the mainland, of course, but it is definitely possible that this would be viewed as overly escalatory – an ever-present consideration in a war where both sides have intercontinental nukes.\n\nAll these factors tend to erode the American spending advantage. It was not a total surprise when a Pentagon summary – the so-called “Overmatch Brief” – leaked last month.\n\nIt was based on years of US wargaming, classified intelligence briefings and simulations, and it stated categorically that America would “most likely suffer decisive defeat” if it attempted to intervene against any attempt by China to conquer Taiwan.\n\nOne reason that the Overmatch Brief is not surprising, of course, is that the Pentagon has every incentive to suggest that it needs more resources. Similarly the fact that it leaked to the media was not a shock – if nobody knows that such a document exists, it has much less effect. The Overmatch Brief may one day be compared to the “missile gap” and “bomber gap” ideas put forth by the US Air Force in the 1950s, claiming that the Soviet Union’s forces were hugely stronger than they actually were in an attempt to obtain a bigger budget.\n\nFactors of budget relative to scenario, indeed, have powerful effects on all militaries. For instance it seems clear that the first and quite probably decisive stages of any China-Taiwan-US shooting war would be an air and sea contest mostly involving long-range missiles. On the US side the missiles would mostly be launched from ships or aircraft.\n\nThis is a pleasing thought for the US Navy and the US Air Force. It is not at all pleasing for the US Army and Marine Corps, who would not wish to be left out.\n\nThis has led to the curious spectacle of the Marines converting many of their conventional combat units into so-called “Littoral Regiments” and the Army similarly creating what it calls “Multi Domain Task Forces”. Both of these are basically land-based missile units, a sort of American PLARF. The problem is that America would probably not wish to provoke China in advance, so they cannot be based on Taiwan and thus would probably not be all that much use.\n\nThese matters aside, the big question for Xi, Trump and the various China hawks in his team – undersecretary of defence for policy Elbridge Colby, for instance – is this: what would happen if China moved against Taiwan and the US intervened?\n\nThe usual way to find an answer to this sort of question is wargames – the military version of what is called “modelling”, if one is talking about subjects such as pandemic disease or climate change. There have been many wargames around the idea of a Chinese invasion or blockade of Taiwan.\n\nMost of them have taken place behind the curtain of classified information, as with the Overmatch Brief. Such models may benefit from better or more detailed data. What is almost always true is that secret modelling is even more likely to be driven by an underlying agenda than openly visible work.\n\nThat’s why it’s probably useful for most of us to look at public wargame modelling of a possible fight for Taiwan. An influential Washington think tank, the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), has made a strong effort here.\n\nThe CSIS wargames acknowledge some uncomfortable realities for the US forces.\n\nAmerican cruisers and destroyers, for instance, have truly amazing defences against incoming Chinese missiles of various kinds, and such defences can mean that even a major Chinese strike can be resisted by a US aircraft carrier strike group or another kind of US Navy surface taskforce.\n\nBut the numbers are remorseless. In one example, China sends out a force of 24 H-6 heavy bombers armed with four YJ-12 ship-killer missiles each. The bombers can range far out into the Pacific, sweeping large stretches of ocean with their radar. If they have any vague idea where a US Navy task force may be, they can locate it.\n\nIf the US force includes a carrier, its radar plane is likely to detect the Chinese bombers long before they can find the carrier, and in that case the carrier’s fighters are likely to solve the problem.\n\nThe CSIS model doesn’t acknowledge the reality that a strike package of H-6s would be unlikely to get past responding US Navy fighters, especially if they were armed with the new beyond-visual-range air-launched SM-6.\n\nThe bombers would probably all have been shot out of the sky before they ever got a sniff of the carrier, which would remain below their radar horizon.\n\nBut if there are no US radar planes or fighters in play, the hail of missiles from the Chinese bombers is likely to overwhelm even the extremely strong Aegis/Standard defence of US cruisers and destroyers, sinking most if not all of them.\n\nIf the US ships do beat off such an attack, the Chinese bombers fly home, re-arm and return in a matter of hours. The American ships’ missile tubes will be largely empty this time, and this is before the extra firepower of the far-away land-based PLARF batteries comes into play.\n\nThe CSIS wargames still do not predict the clear-cut defeat seen in the Overmatch Brief. Indeed, their results suggest that in fact if the US is committed to the fight and doesn’t hesitate at the start, it can knock China back with a very bloody nose in the event of any serious fight over Taiwan.\n\nThe end result would be a Taiwan Strait filled with burning and sinking Chinese wrecks and the survivors of the Chinese invasion force trapped on Taiwan with their supply lines from the mainland cut, eventually forced to surrender.\n\nBut the US Navy and Air Force would have suffered on a scale not seen since the Second World War. Hundreds of American fighter jets would have been destroyed, mostly wrecked on the ground in their bases in Japan and elsewhere by long-ranging Chinese strikes.\n\nThe US Navy and its allies would lose dozens of ships and thousands of sailors. HMS Anson or her future successor on SRF-West would probably have done a huge amount of damage to the PLAN and its amphibious fleet, knowing our submariners, but they would in all likelihood have gone down fighting in the end, assuming they could rearm and get back in the battle often enough.\n\nBoth China and the US would be seriously damaged as global military powers, and Taiwan would still be free but shattered as a nation and an economy – and that would mean knock-on damage to all world economies, given how vital the Taiwanese semiconductor industry is to us all.\n\nThe lesson of history for us all to take away – not only the US, but Australia, Britain and everyone else in the West – is that ancient and well-tried truism: if you would have peace, prepare yourself for war.\n\nThe way to persuade Xi Jinping not to invade Taiwan is to make the chance of failure higher.\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "title": "Finland is trying to poach top tech and AI talent from the US with 2-week visas and better work-life balance",
    "description": "Finland wants to lure American engineers and researchers with fast-track visas and good work-life balance as part of the global AI talent wars.",
    "fullText": "Finland is stepping into the tech talent wars.\n\nThe Nordic country is making a push for tech workers from abroad, with a particular focus on the US. The goal is to attract engineers and researchers working in deep tech, especially in the fields of quantum computing, AI, and health innovation.\n\nThe effort comes as competition for AI talent intensifies worldwide and tech workers in the US grapple with layoffs, burnout, and visa complications. KPMG's annual survey of global CEOs found that 70% were concerned about competition for AI talent. According to BCG's 2024 talent tracker report, the US remained dominant in attracting AI talent worldwide.\n\nAlready known for its tech scene, Finland, with a population of around 5.6 million, is positioning itself as a place where American tech workers can find a better work-life balance without sacrificing their careers — a notable contrast to the famous grindset of Silicon Valley.\n\n\"Of course, there might be long days once in a while, but it's such a high value, and it's also protected by law that you can't work more than an average of 40 hours per week,\" Laura Lindeman, head of the Work in Finland program, told Business Insider.\n\nShe said that even in the tech sector, when people leave work for the day, they really do leave. \"Offices are silent,\" she said. Employers in Finland, often ranked the happiest country in the world, also see the benefit of workers having lives outside work, she said, adding that the general sentiment is \"it narrows your thinking if you only work.\"\n\nFinland is working with more than 30 Finnish tech companies and universities to promote open roles to foreign workers. A preview of the job openings being promoted under the program includes roles with Oura Health (the company behind the Oura Ring), quantum computing firm QMill, and Aalto University.\n\nLindeman said Americans interested in working in Finland should consider reaching out to companies or universities, even if no open roles are listed, as some employers are open to creating positions for the right candidate. While the campaign emphasizes the US, it also targets talent from India, Brazil, and other parts of Europe.\n\nOnce candidates receive a job offer, they can apply for a specialist visa through Finland's Fast Track program. Approved applicants can receive a work-residence permit in as little as two weeks, with processing times averaging about 10 days, Lindeman said. Finland also offers integration programs to help newcomers settle in, and spouses of workers on specialist visas are eligible for work permits, she added.\n\nGovernment data suggests interest from Americans is already rising. Finland granted 60 specialist residence permits to US citizens in 2024 and 85 in 2025, according to Finnish immigration statistics. The number of residence permits granted to US researchers also increased, from 35 in 2024 to 46 in 2025.\n\nJordan Blake Banks, an American who moved to Finland in 2019 to pursue a master's degree through the Fulbright program, said the country offers plenty of benefits, from its forests to its emphasis on work-life balance. After finishing her degree, Banks stayed in Finland and eventually landed a job as a sustainability consultant at Deloitte in Helsinki.\n\n\"The general idea is that the company and the colleagues respect you as a person, and that you can have your free and personal time,\" she said, adding parents regularly leave work during the day for family obligations without stigma. Many Finns also take about a month of vacation during the summer, along with time off in the winter.\n\nBanks said salaries in Finland tend to be lower than in comparable roles in the US, but she thinks the gap is offset by more affordable essential services, including healthcare, education, and childcare.\n\nWhile learning Finnish isn't necessary for working in the country — Lindeman said English is widely used in the tech industry, and about 80% of Finns speak fluent English — Banks said not knowing the language can feel isolating in everyday life.\n\nShe enrolled in a four-month integration program run by the city, where she learned the language and eventually passed the national exam required to become a Finnish citizen. Banks also met her now-wife while living in Finland.\n\nOne cultural adjustment of living in Finland, she said, has been that the people tend to be more reserved than Americans. \"If you're coming from a very friendly culture or a very warm culture, I think that could be a shock,\" she said, adding she'd been able to use that to her advantage.\n\nBanks said speaking up helped her land a paid research position at her university. \"I was willing to make contact and be the brave American willing to ask for things,\" she said.",

    "description": "Gary He has visited McDonald's restaurants in more than 55 countries. His favorites include the McSki in Sweden and a UFO-shaped McDonald's in the US.",
    "fullText": "Most McDonald's locations around the world follow a familiar design: red-and-white branding topped with golden arches. But some stand out for their distinct architecture and unique backstories.\n\nFrom a glass-covered restaurant in Batumi, Georgia, to one built over an ancient Roman road in Italy, the fast-food chain has found unique ways to blend with the local surroundings while maintaining its individuality.\n\nIn his book, \"McAtlas: A Global Guide to the Golden Arches,\" which was released in November 2024, author and photojournalist Gary He captured the essence of some of these locations while explaining what makes each one special.\n\nBetween 2019 and 2024, He traveled to over 55 countries and dined at more than 100 McDonald's restaurants. When it came to picking his top locations, he had clear favorites.\n\n\"I wanted to document the more interesting parts of the largest restaurant group in the world,\" He told Business Insider, emphasizing that the project was an independent undertaking.\n\nHere are five unique McDonald's locations that He recommends fans of the brand must visit.\n\nThe McDonald's in Sälen, Sweden, tops He's list of best locations.\n\nNestled in one of Sweden's biggest ski resorts, Lindvallen, this spot offers a unique \"ski-thru\" experience. It allows skiers to grab a Big Mac without leaving their skis.\n\nThe restaurant opened in 1996 and operates daily from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. during ski season.\n\n\"The air is so clean and crisp — it's like being on top of the world,\" He told Business Insider, adding, \"When I visited, it wasn't even busy. It was just me, the McSki, and the mountains. I was just hanging out and enjoying myself.\"\n\nGetting there isn't easy, though. He said it took him six hours to travel from Stockholm, with three transfers — first, from a train station at Borlänge Centralstation to a bus, and then 48 stops later, another bus — but the journey was worth it.\n\n\"The McSki is hands-down the coolest McDonald's I've visited anywhere in the world,\" He said.\n\n\"I really love the Shenzhen location in China,\" said He, adding, \"It was the first McDonald's in China at a time when the country wasn't fully open to American businesses.\"\n\nThe restaurant opened on October 8, 1990, in Shenzhen's special economic zone. On its first day, it welcomed over 40,000 customers despite a seating capacity of 460, the South China Morning Post reported.\n\nThe restaurant balances local design with the chain's signature branding. The three-floor building features pagoda-style roofs, integrating traditional Chinese architectural design with the golden arches.\n\nHave you ever wondered what it's like to enjoy a Big Mac on a static passenger plane? In Taupo, a town in New Zealand, you can.\n\nNamed one of the \"world's coolest McDonald's,\" per a signpost, this restaurant is inside a decommissioned DC-3 plane built in 1943. At first, it was used as a passenger plane and then as a crop duster, an agricultural aircraft that sprays pesticides on crops from the air.\n\nIn 1984, it was decommissioned and, per Atlas Obscura, became a promotional product in Taupō's Aeroplane Car Company's parking lot until McDonald's bought it in 1990.\n\n\"The airplane location in Taupo is iconic,\" said He.\n\nA McDonald's in the shape of a UFO is fitting for Roswell, a town known for its rumored alien sightings and extraterrestrial encounters.\n\nThe town became popular in 1947 when a mysterious aircraft, which the local newspaper, the Roswell Daily Record, identified as a \"flying saucer,\" crashed into a ranch. Then, in 1980, Stanton Friedman, a former nuclear physicist, came across the 1947 news story and alleged it to be an alien spacecraft, sparking widespread outcry.\n\nGovernment records later showed the aircraft was a top-secret government surveillance balloon used to detect echoes of Soviet nuclear-testing blasts.\n\nBut by then, people were convinced the government was hiding information about alien life, and UFOs had become a mini-industry with several themed attractions, such as the annual UFO festival and a museum, spread across town.\n\nIn 2005, a few miles from the crash site, McDonald's opened a restaurant shaped like a spaceship with neon lights.\n\nBut He loves the restaurant for more than just its exteriors.\n\n\"It has a gift shop,\" he said, adding, \"I mean, it's cool looking, but they have merchandise, which I think is super cool.\"\n\nThe gift shop features Ronald McDonald in a spacesuit and alien statues.\n\nHe's final favorite is the Méqui1000 in São Paulo, Brazil, a spot that combines playful creativity with historical significance.\n\n\"It looks like the White House but decorated as a kindergartner's art project,\" He said, adding that the restaurant's façade undergoes multiple changes in a year and is usually adorned with vibrant artwork for promotional campaigns.\n\nMéqui1000 also holds cultural significance; it was the 1,000th McDonald's in Brazil, one of 20 nations with over 1,000 McDonald's stores, according to Yahoo Finance.\n\n\"It's a huge market and an important location,\" He said.\n\nThe menu here also features items exclusive to Brazil, like the Super Mac, a fully loaded burger with lettuce, tomato, and onion, which is in a contrast to the simpler burgers popular in the US.\n\n\"Culturally, Americans want it [their burgers] cheap, fast, and straightforward, but in Brazil and other countries, people want their burgers a little more dressed up,\" He said.\n\nEditor's note: This story was first published in November 2024 following an interview with photojournalist Gary He. It was updated in January 2026.",

    "description": "The My Disney Experience app has become essential for trips to Disney World and Disneyland, but relying on phones at the parks may not be so bad.",
    "fullText": "Every December, I take my family to Disneyland.\n\nOn our most recent annual trip, we snagged some great dinner reservations and checked into our themed hotel with ease. This time, my granddaughter was finally tall enough to ride more attractions, like Space Mountain and Tiana's Bayou Adventure.\n\nSoon, though, I realized something: Although our group had never had so much fun at Disney, we'd also never spent so much time on our phones.\n\nOur increased screen time wasn't due to texting or surfing the web — we were just managing our entire vacation on the My Disney Experience app.\n\nThough early versions of the app began making rounds in 2012, I didn't try it until a trip to Disney World in 2018.\n\nWhen checking into our hotel on the property, I'd turned down the chance to have our park tickets and room key loaded onto the app because I consider myself pretty old school.\n\nHowever, I finally caved by lunchtime.\n\nWhile at Animal Kingdom's Flame Tree Barbecue, I noticed several people just walking up to the counter and being handed food without ever waiting in the long line I'd been standing in.\n\nThat's when my wife told me about mobile ordering, a new service Disney had rolled out just a few months prior. I was hungry, so I decided to give it a try.\n\nIn a few taps, I'd placed our lunch order. The app asked if I was in the area and ready to pick up the food. I answered yes.\n\nWithin minutes, I got another alert saying my food was ready. I casually walked past the throngs of guests still waiting to even place their orders and picked up my pulled-pork sandwich.\n\nI felt like I'd been granted membership to a secret club.\n\nMy so-called \"secret\" club didn't last, as the COVID-19 pandemic ushered in a new way of life, one where contactless interactions were preferred.\n\nMobile ordering, both at Disney and other institutions, has become the norm and, in some cases, the default or only option. Contactless check-in via a mobile app also became increasingly popular across various hotel chains, including Disney properties.\n\nDisney's app has since become a hub for park tickets, room keys, dinner reservations — and even line-skipping features.\n\nThere are still paper maps, physical tickets, and room key cards available for those who want them, but now, it feels difficult to imagine a trip to the parks without a smartphone loaded with the My Disney Experience app.\n\nThough I was once hesitant to use an app as my key card at a Disney hotel, it just made sense during our December trip.\n\nMy hotel reservation was linked to the other guests in my party, so they could easily unlock our suite and make room charges using the app. The only time we went to the front desk was to get a key card for our granddaughter because she likes to open the door herself.\n\nWhen it came time to enter the park, we scanned our tickets in the app and used our phones for entry. The app helped us check ride wait times so we could maximize our day. We also used it to peruse the menus of restaurants we might want to dine at, make reservations, and then receive alerts when our table was ready.\n\nOur biggest use of the app was reserving rides with the Lightning Lane, a service we'd paid extra for so we could skip the lines on popular attractions.\n\nEvery time we got off one ride, my wife was on the app, refreshing to check availability while trying to make the next reservation for our whole family.\n\nThough she did miss a few conversations while heads-down on her phone, it felt like a small sacrifice to make in order to efficiently secure seats on popular attractions for our whole family.\n\nWith everything we could need in this app, all we really had to do was make sure we had an extra battery and phone chargers in our bags.\n\nWalking around the park, I thought I'd feel sad seeing empty alcoves where machines once dispensed paper Fast Passes or the ticket booths in the process of being removed.\n\nHowever, I realized I really just feel nostalgic. Any wistful reflections would be a bit romanticized since the past may be simpler, but it wasn't always better.\n\nWhen my wife and I visited Disney World for the first time in the '80s, we picked up our park tickets from our travel agent, flew with physical boarding passes, and carried printed-out copies of our hotel reservations and rental-car agreement.\n\nTimes have definitely changed, but it sure is more convenient to travel with a digital boarding pass and the Disney app loaded on my phone instead of carrying a bunch of papers.\n\nAnd by not waiting in lines to order food or check in at a hotel, maybe parkgoers can free up their time to spend more of it having fun with family.\n\nBut if your face is buried in your phone, you're going to miss a lot — whether the special menu recommendations that come with placing a food order with a cashier or the look on a loved one's face as they get off a great ride.\n\nUltimately, the ability to manage your entire Disney trip on an app isn't exactly a bad thing — it just comes down to how you use it.",

    "description": "As a frequent traveler who's been around the world, I fell in love with Bali. The island is home to great food, warm people, and lots of things to do.",
    "fullText": "As an American who's traveled to 44 countries over the last 30 years, I've seen my fair share of unforgettable places.\n\nBut if I had to choose one place to visit again and again, it would be Bali, an island and province in Indonesia that combines vibrant culture, natural beauty, and a pace of life that feels both energizing and restorative.\n\nAfter spending a month on the island in 2023, I fell in love. Here's what made my trip to Bali so special.\n\nOne of my favorite meals during my time in Bali came from a street vendor. The Javanese meal, called Tahu Tek, featured fried tofu, bean sprouts, a thick peanut sauce, and a pile of crackers on top. It cost me less than $2 (USD), but it was packed with flavor.\n\nBali's food scene goes far beyond street food, though. Even dining at restaurants felt affordable, making it easy to try local specialties, including babi guling, a traditional whole roasted pig.\n\nPlus, I could easily find international cuisine alongside local dishes.\n\nI often went to Milk & Madu, which served American-style food like pizza and burgers. I also loved spending mornings at cafés in Canggu, sipping smoothies and enjoying breakfast bowls.\n\nOne of the main things that makes Bali truly special is its people. I've been to many destinations where the locals aren't always open to expats and travelers. But here, everyone I met was warm, welcoming, and genuinely kind.\n\nFor example, I used an app called Grab, similar to Uber, where drivers can pick up passengers on their motorbikes or in their cars.\n\nI was wary about riding on the back of a stranger's bike, but the friendly drivers I had across several rides quickly made me feel at ease. Some would even check in with me during the ride to make sure everything was OK or to ask if I needed them to slow down.\n\nPlus, I found an amazing community of digital nomads, creatives, and expats who decided to trade their office jobs for laptops in cafés. As an American living abroad, this made me feel at home.\n\nIt gave me a sense of familiarity in a new environment and made it easier to connect, since there was no language barrier. I felt more comfortable starting conversations and sharing experiences with other expats and long-term travelers.\n\nDuring my time in Uluwatu, I met another nomad, and a simple conversation turned into spending the next few days together exploring. These kinds of moments felt much more natural and common in Bali than in other places I've visited, and I felt a strong sense of openness and connection.\n\nAnother thing I loved about Bali was the diverse range of activities available. Whether I was in the mood to visit temples or relax on the beach, there was always something to do.\n\nFor example, in Ubud, I wandered through the Sacred Monkey Forest Sanctuary, where ancient temples sit under jungle canopies. There were signs everywhere warning visitors to hold onto their belongings, and for good reason. The sanctuary is home to over 1,260 monkeys, who I saw climbing railings and jumping between statues.\n\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, I also visited Alas Harum, a tourism destination in Tegallalang with lots of opportunities for adventure. Here, I flew out on a giant swing that went over rice fields. Taking in the view from way above the terraces was equal parts terrifying and fun.\n\nAnd when I wanted to relax, I visited the beach clubs, where I lounged by the water with music playing and a drink in my hand.\n\nAfter traveling to 44 countries, I can confidently say I'm no stranger to exploring new places.\n\nEvery destination I've visited has shown me new ways of living, but in Bali, I experienced a way of life that felt joyful, balanced, and connected. Plus, the tropical, warm, and consistent weather didn't hurt either.\n\nBetween the amazing food, the warm people, and the sense of adventure, I'm already dreaming of my next trip to this beautiful island.",

They tweaked marketing, packaging, or pricing to suit regional tastes. But in today’s fractured world, such superficial localization is no longer good enough. Trade policies conflict. Data laws clash. And many governments now enforce data sovereignty laws and mandates for local sourcing and technology transfer. They require companies to perform key operations, stretching from research and development to manufacturing and data processing, within their country, instead of merely selling products from abroad. The result is a profound shift in how global companies operate. They duplicate supply chains, adjust to local markets in real time, and integrate national and regional suppliers, even at the cost of scale efficiencies, to ensure redundancy and tailor best practices for every market.",

    "description": "The lawsuit was filed by an international group of plaintiffs.",
    "fullText": "Shortly after Meta (then Facebook) bought WhatsApp in 2014, it promised to implement a surprisingly un-Facebooky feature: End-to-end encryption. The move was supposed to be a boon for privacy, ensuring nobody could see your messages aside from the recipient and yourself. Even now, WhatsApp's website claims, \"No one outside of the chat, not even WhatsApp, can read, listen to, or share [your messages].\" However, a new lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court in San Francisco is now claiming that's not the case.\n\nAccording to reporting from Bloomberg, an international group of plaintiffs has sued Meta, saying that the app's claims of end-to-end encryption are a lie. The lawsuit alleges that Meta and WhatsApp \"store, analyze, and can access virtually all of WhatsApp user's purportedly 'private' communications.\"\n\nThe plaintiffs include users from Australia, Brazil, India, Mexico, and South Africa, who are being represented by attorneys from several firms. The allegations cite \"whistleblowers\" who helped bring this information to light, but no more is known as of yet.\n\nWhen I reached out to Meta for comment, Meta strongly denied the allegations. The company called the lawsuit \"frivolous,\" assuring users that WhatsApp uses the open-source Signal protocol for encryption and adding that \"[a]ny claim that people's WhatsApp messages are not encrypted is categorically false and absurd.\"\n\nIf the lawsuit succeeds, it could affect billions of users around the world. That's because the plaintiffs' lawyers are asking the court to certify a class-action lawsuit.\n\nIn the meantime, WhatApp is far from the only option for encrypted messaging apps. While it's unclear how the lawsuit will proceed, those looking to jump ship might want to look at alternatives like Signal or Viber instead. Note that some apps, like Telegram, do offer end-to-end encryption, but don't enable it by default. (Personally I use Line, because of the anime stickers.)",

    "description": "RAGBRAI is the world's oldest, longest annual bicycle tour. Here's what to know about the 53rd annual edition July 19-25.",
    "fullText": "RAGBRAI 2026 will take riders on a scenic journey this summer from the Loess Hills overlooking the Missouri River in northwest Iowa through the plains of central Iowa to the Mississippi River on the state's eastern boundary.\n\nThe route for the 53rd edition of the Register's Annual Great Bicycle Ride Across Iowa, announced on Saturday, Jan. 24, will extend 391.4 miles from Onawa to Dubuque. Along the way the seven-day bike tour will stop overnight in Harlan, Guthrie Center, Boone, Marshalltown, Independence and Dyersville.\n\nIt will be the shortest RAGBRAI ever, but will be hillier than all but nine other editions.\n\n“The mileage is not as intense as it’s been in years past,” RAGBRAI Director Matt Phippen said. \"What they can’t always plan for is the elevation.”\n\nHere is what to know about RAGBRAI 2026.\n\nThe world’s longest and oldest annual bicycle tour, RAGBRAI draws tens of thousands of participants from around the world. Spanning the final full week of July, it always goes from west to east across Iowa.\n\nThe ride begins at or near the Missouri River and ends at the Mississippi, taking advantage of the fact that Iowa is bordered by the nation's two longest rivers. The events division of USA Today Co., the corporate parent of the Des Moines Register, runs the ride.\n\nRAGBRAI evolved from an idea hatched by riding buddies Donald Kaul, the Des Moines Register's Washington columnist, and copy editor and features writer John Karras. They called the 460-mile cross-state ride from Sioux City to Davenport the Great Six-Day Bike Trip.\n\nAt his editor's behest, Karras invited readers along. When Kaul and Karras arrived in Sioux City on Aug. 26, 1973, to start the ride, there were about 200 cyclists waiting for them.\n\nThey wrote stories along the way about the people they met and sights they saw in small towns across Iowa. Readers were enthralled with tales of the ride and characters like Clarence Pickard, a pith-helmeted, 83-year-old retired farmer from Indianola who rode the entire way on a used women's bicycle he bought just before the ride.\n\nMore: As RAGBRAI grows from lark to legendary at age 50, it still offers glimpses of 'authentic Iowa'\n\nThe Second Annual Great Bicycle Ride Across Iowa, or SAGBRAI, followed in 1974. Karras renamed it the Register's Annual Great Bicycle Ride Across Iowa in 1975. Later, its date shifted permanently to the last full week of July each year, adding a seventh day.\n\nSince then, RAGBRAI has grown into a professionally managed event that draws riders from all 50 states and as far away as Australia and South Africa. During its 50th anniversary edition in 2023, some 60,000 riders crowded onto the Day 4 ride from Ames to Des Moines.\n\nRAGBRAI will be held Sunday to Saturday July 19-25. Most riders add an extra night, gathering in the starting town the Saturday before the ride begins for an early start the following morning. Colloquially known as \"Day 0,\" this year's will be July 18 and the town will be Onawa, which will mark the event with a daylong festival and bike expo.\n\nThis year's ride will cover 391.4 miles, making it the shortest RAGBRAI to date. The previous shortest edition came in 1977 with a 400-mile journey from Onawa to Lansing. Over the preceding 52 years, routes have averaged about 470 miles, according to RAGBRAI. On six occasions, including as recently as 2023, the route was more than 500 miles long.\n\nOrganizers will continue to change the route until after the annual Route Inspection Ride in June. Natural disasters like flooding and tornadoes, as well as road construction, can force organizers to make alterations.\n\nRAGBRAI 2026 will travel from Onawa in northwest Iowa to Dubuque in northeast Iowa. There will be 16,027 feet of climb, the 10th-most of any RAGBRAI, according to the organizers.\n\nNo matter what route the ride takes, there are some serious hills, especially coming in and out of river valleys. In some years, like the hilliest-ever RAGBRAI in 2024, the hills never end. In 2026 the first and second days are short in mileage but will be the hilliest.\n\nThe first day packs 3,465 feet of climb into 58.5 miles as it climbs through the Loess Hills. The second day will be the hilliest of the week with 3,554 feet of climb crammed into just 53.9 miles.\n\n“They’re so unique,” Phippen said of the Loess. “When you’re riding your bike in that area it doesn’t feel like Iowa. It doesn’t look like Iowa. … It’s another view of what Iowa has to offer.”\n\nThere also is the possibility that RAGBRAI will pass by Pilot Mound, setting up a steep drop into the Des Moines River valley near Boone, the Day 3 overnight town, and then a notorious climb back out. The final route has not been determined.\n\nOn paper the 81.4-mile fifth day from Marshalltown to Independence appears to be the hardest because it is 19 miles longer than any other day and has the third-most feet of climb.\n\nBut the hilly first and second days also could be challenging. As always, weather will play a large role in determining which days are the toughest because headwinds, heat or rain can make any day more challenging.\n\n“You have days in the 60s (miles) and you have 1,500 feet of climb, so just a normal day of riding anywhere in Iowa. But, you throw in headwinds, and that day is super hard now,” Phippen said. “Unless Mother Nature blesses us with tailwinds every day, that’s the only possible way we have easy days on RAGBRAI.”\n\nRegistration opened Nov. 15. Weeklong passes cost $250 until Feb. 28. Beginning March 1, weeklong prices increase, peaking at $400 beginning June 1. Single-day passes also are available for $45 until Feb. 28. They will cost more thereafter, reaching $70 when bought during the ride at the RAGBRAI campgrounds.\n\nWeeklong nonrider passes for support drivers and others tagging along will cost $45 until the end of February and $50 after March 1.\n\nRegistration is required for all vehicles entering RAGBRAI campgrounds. Weeklong vehicle passes cost:\n\n$45 for cars, SUVs, minivans and pickup trucks.\n\n$80. for box trucks and RVs up to 25 feet long and for 15-passenger vans.\n\n$100 for buses, RVs and pickup truck-trailer combos longer than 25 feet, up to a maximum of 45 feet.\n\n$120 for vehicles or truck-trailer combos over 45 feet.\n\nRegistration pays for the things that make RAGBRAI, RAGBRAI, including:\n\nFour ambulances and paramedic teams on the route each day and free emergency medical transportation.\n\nTraffic control by Iowa State Patrol troopers.\n\nFree support and gear, or SAG, service, which patrols the route to pick up riders experiencing mechanical or physical breakdowns.\n\nOfficial camping areas with portable toilets.\n\nRoute maps and GPX files for riders and support drivers\n\nDirectional marking of the bike and support vehicle routes.\n\nAn embroidered patch for weeklong riders and a century patch for those who complete the 100-mile loop.\n\nBicycle shipping stations at the end of the ride.\n\nThe opportunity to utilize long-term parking in the starting or ending town.\n\nThe overnight towns are the six where riders will spend the night as they wend their way across Iowa: Harlan, Guthrie Center, Boone, Marshalltown, Independence and Dyersville.\n\nPass-through towns are where riders can pause for breakfast, a snack or refreshment and to play games and sometimes join spontaneous dancing, goat yoga and other shenanigans as they travel between the starting, ending and overnight towns. Meeting towns are daily midpoints where riders can rendezvous with companions and support vehicles.\n\nEach year RAGBRAI has one day with an optional, added loop, providing riders who choose to take advantage of it enough distance to complete a total ride of at least 100 miles. The loop is named for RAGBRAI co-founder Karras, who died in 2021.\n\nThe optional century loop day will be announced in April, Phippen said.\n\nSince 2015, RAGBRAI has offered optional detours for gravel riders.\n\nLast year's route included daily optional gravel sections adding up to a total of 83 miles for the week. This year also will include gravel options every day. Details will be released in April, Phippen said.\n\n“We have the best gravel in the nation,” he said. “So we want to show it off. As long as it makes sense, as long as it’s safe, we’ll find more ways to add gravel.”\n\nOccasionally, the full route also has stretches of gravel due to road construction, flooding or other events. The full route in 2023 had a 2.5-mile section of gravel with two hills on it, and the 2024 route had a mile-long section.\n\nAs of January, there are no plans to take the regular route on gravel roads in 2026, Phippen said. But the final route is still being determined, he said.\n\n“If something happens throughout the year, the route does evolve, it does change,” he said.\n\nThe question of whether RAGBRAI will visit any state other than Iowa would have seemed implausible before 2025 because, after all, it is the Register's Great Bicycle Ride Across Iowa. But on the second day of RAGBRAI's far northerly route last July it veered across the border for a 15-mile excursion through southern Minnesota.\n\nGiven the central Iowa route, RAGBRAI will stay solely within the confines of Iowa in 2026, Phippen said.\n\n“There’s no plans to go to any other states this year,” he said.\n\nMost riders favor road or gravel bikes, but heavier mountain bikes are far more popular than they once were. Tandems and recumbent bikes are everywhere. Each year there are more electric-assist bikes. And as always, RAGBRAI's rolling carnival attracts people on everything from high-wheeled penny-farthings to skateboards.\n\nOver its 53 years numerous celebrities and athletes have ridden RAGBRAI, from longtime Oakland Raider Ben Davidson in the 1980s to seven-time NASCAR Champion Jimmie Johnson in 2017 and \"American Pickers\" star Mike Wolfe in 2019.\n\nSome celebrities give no advance notice of their plans to participate. It was a surprise treat in 2025 when NBA hall-of-famer David Robinson joined the ride.\n\nRAGBRAI is a bike tour, not a race. It's open to riders of all ages and abilities. People can ride all seven days or just one day. Some people go for the whole week but only ride parts of each day. You win by having as much fun as you can while moving along at your own pace.\n\nRAGBRAI also asks riders to make sure everyone has a good time by respecting the residents of the towns that host them. The number of riders is often many times larger than their populations and the event is only possible because volunteers spend hundreds of hours preparing for and hosting the cyclists.\n\nPhilip Joens has ridden parts of 20 RAGBRAIs. He has completed the river-to-river trek nine times. He covers retail and real estate for the Des Moines Register and can be reached at 515-284-8184 or at pjoens@registermedia.com.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Des Moines Register: What to know about RAGBRAI as it prepares for 2026",

    "fullText": "I’ve been a games journalist since 2007, but still there isn’t much video games coverage that feels like it’s specifically for people like me. So I’m creating a home for it: Mothership\n\nWhether you’re reading about the impending AI bubble bursting or about the video game industry’s mass layoffs and cancelled projects, 2026 does not feel like a hopeful time for gaming. What’s more, games journalists – as well as all other kinds of journalists – have been losing their jobs at alarming rates, making it difficult to adequately cover these crises. Donald Trump’s White House, meanwhile, is using video game memes as ICE recruitment tools, and game studios are backing away from diversity and inclusion initiatives in response to the wider world’s slide to the right.\n\nThe manosphere is back, and we’ve lost mainstream feminist websites such as Teen Vogue; bigots everywhere are celebrating what they see as the death of “woke”. Put it all together and we have a dismal stew of doom for someone like me, a queer woman and a feminist who’s been a games journalist and critic since 2007.\n\nEverything I just listed off in that paragraph speaks to an urgent need for something different. This is why I’m launching a gender and identity-focused gaming publication called Mothership. It’s independent and worker-owned; it will rely on subscribers’ support to exist. Mothership will focus on reporting on the good and bad of modern-day game-making – alongside investigations, reviews, criticism, and historical deep dives into games and developers who paved the way to now. It will be a website for people who read the news with dread, including gaming news, and worry that Gamergaters got what they always wanted. And it will be a place for readers who wish there was something like a Teen Vogue, but for games (and without a corporate owner to kneecap it).\n\nAfter all, the last two decades have seen a lot of actual, valuable change, and modern games are evidence of that. We exist, now, in a gaming world with more female characters, more non-binary characters, more queer characters, and more characters who don’t fall into rigidly defined gender stereotypes. The GDC State of the Game Industry survey for 2025 found that 66% of surveyed game developers were male, compared with 75% in 2020, and 94% in 2009.\n\nMore people than ever can now see themselves reflected in game characters, and more diverse development teams are creating them. But change has not come easy – and we’ve seen a lot of backlash to this progress. Few websites still in existence are able to cover this backlash while also keeping their reporters safe and motivated to continue.\n\nI have dreamed of founding a website like this for a long time; it’s not as if readers haven’t wanted it before now. The problem I saw with the idea was not that people wouldn’t want it, but rather that I didn’t see a good way to pay for it. Journalism has been facing a monetisation crisis since the advent of the internet. It’s hard to convince readers to pay for something they are used to getting for free.\n\nBut I know the readers are there. In the mid-2010s, I worked for a small “geek girl” feminist website called the Mary Sue, and it was a unique pleasure to write very specific articles for a very specific audience. The Mary Sue relied on advertising income, which meant that all of us had to write up to six articles every weekday; there wasn’t time to spend on investigative reporting, for example, or long-form critical essays. I’m still proud of what we achieved, despite the intensity of those working conditions, not to mention the amount of harassment we faced just for existing. But I always dreamed of working for a place that had the same editorial remit without the harsh working conditions and quotas.\n\nLater, I left the Mary Sue and went on to work for Kotaku and then Polygon, both huge games websites where I was writing for broader audiences, rather than the hyper-specific one we catered to at the Mary Sue. As I watched many smaller games websites crumble over the course of the 2010s and 20s, I figured this was the only type of games website that was going to survive. The idea of working for a small, feminist games website – my dream – increasingly looked like an impossible speck of starlight in a far-off galaxy.\n\nBut then, in the summer of 2025, my then-employer Polygon underwent a mass layoff and acquisition. We went from a staff of 42 people to just eight. After a particularly disheartening video call with our website’s new owners, I realised I was going to have to quit. Every piece of the dream felt well and truly dead. I had not got into journalism to be taken advantage of by people who saw me and my colleagues as so easily replaceable as to be barely human.\n\nAnother one of my colleagues at Polygon – Zoe Hannah, games editor – quit as well, for similar reasons. She hit me up with an idea she had for a feminist games website. “You should do it,” I told her. And then I sat there for a moment and thought about it. No, we should do it! This was what I had wanted to do, before the industry had transformed me into someone so gnarled and jaded that I no longer believed it was even possible.\n\nSix months on, after many DMs with former colleagues from Polygon, the Mary Sue and Kotaku, plus other notable writers who’ve covered gender and identity in games – Zoe and I are launching Mothership together, today. We have had the benefit of advice and inspiration from many other independent, worker-owned outlets that have come before us, such as Defector, the Flytrap, and Aftermath. Already, we’ve surpassed 1,200 paid subscribers. (I knew the readers were there.) And we don’t need millions of them. Mothership is a publication for a very specific audience: the people who don’t fit the mould of the masculine, hardcore gamer image that marketing and pop culture have been dishing out since the 90s. We want to serve this audience well.\n\nI believe our website is a necessity in our current political climate. It should have existed before, when I and millions of other girls who grew up playing games were made to feel out of place by media and advertising that was laser-focused on teenage boys. But it’s not too late for me to make sure it exists now.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump may still dominate the news cycle, but inside the White House, the foundations of his power are weakening—and he knows it, according to Trump’s biographer.\n\nOn the latest episode of Inside Trump’s Head, author Michael Wolff described a White House increasingly gripped by anxiety as the president enters a pivotal midterm year burdened by collapsing polls, international resistance, self-inflicted crises that refuse to fade, and growing alarm among aides that Trump is losing interest in the presidency.\n\n“If you lose Donald Trump’s interest, you lose Donald Trump,” Wolff said.\n\n“He’s not interested in policy. He’s not interested in bureaucracy. He’s interested in unfettered attention.”\n\nAccording to Wolff, the daily work of governing—incremental wins, trade-offs, and detail—bores Trump, draining his energy at a moment when political discipline matters most.\n\nThat disengagement has become increasingly visible on the world stage. After heading to the World Economic Forum in Davos expecting to be treated as an untouchable strongman, Trump instead encountered coordinated resistance from allies who, Wolff argued, are no longer content to maneuver quietly around him.\n\n“Trump’s virtue to voters is that no matter what happened, he looked strong,” Wolff told co-host Joanna Coles.\n\n“Now he cannot take Greenland, he cannot take Canada, he cannot do any of the things that he has huffed and puffed and said he will do.”\n\nWolff said the same pattern is playing out at home, where the administration has struggled to contain the fallout in Minneapolis following two fatal encounters involving federal immigration officers this month, further inflaming protests and political backlash.\n\n“This has now become a very, very complicated situation,” Wolff said.\n\nFor Trump, Minneapolis represents the kind of crisis he finds hardest to manage: one that can’t be bullied into submission or drowned out by spectacle.\n\n“He cannot threaten his way out of it,” Wolff said.\n\n“He can’t seem to generate a new headline to get himself out of it,” he continued. “The headlines that are generated are bad headlines.”\n\nThat dynamic, Wolff argued, points to a broader problem for Trump as the midterms approach. Governing, he said, demands a tolerance for incremental progress, which is at odds with Trump’s appetite for dominance and immediate results.\n\n“The work of the presidency does not inspire him,” Wolff said.\n\n“If it becomes complicated, that has to be pushed to the side.”\n\nAs Trump disengages, Wolff went on to say, the president has increasingly turned to performative conflict, including high-profile lawsuits and public feuds with powerful institutions. Once effective at projecting strength, those tactics now risk reinforcing the impression of a leader struggling to maintain control.\n\n“There’s only so many times you can sue people for $5 billion or $20 billion,” Wolff said. “You look foolish.”\n\nWith a little over nine months until the midterm elections, Wolff framed the moment as a genuine inflection point—not just for Republicans, but for Trump himself.\n\n“We’re in the middle of a pivotal campaign,” Wolff said.\n\n“Conceivably one of the most important campaigns ever waged. This is potentially, in November, the end of Donald Trump.”\n\nWhen reached for comment, White House Communications Director Steven Cheung told the Daily Beast: “Michael Wolff is a lying sack of s--t and has been proven to be a fraud.

    "fullText": "\"I just love a challenge really, that's my problem.\"\n\nWelsh PE teacher Lauren Stockley draws a smile as she plots out another busy year.\n\nNot content with just heading to the Ironman 70.3 World Championships in Nice in September, she has her sights set on more Hyrox glory.\n\nFor those unfamiliar, Hyrox is a global fitness racing competition designed to test an athlete's endurance and strength.\n\nIt has become hugely popular and last year thousands descended on Cardiff for a three-day event at the Principality Stadium.\n\nStockley, 26, has proved a natural talent. A little over a year after completing her first Hyrox, she was part of a quartet who set a women's world record in London in December 2025.\n\nHow Hyrox became the latest sporting craze\n\nHyrox: The new fitness trend sweeping the capital\n\nHyrox comprises of 8km of running with eight exercise stations in between.\n\nCompetitors endure 1km on a standing ski machine, 50m sled push, 50m sled pull, 80m burpee jumps, 1km indoor rowing, 200m kettlebell carry, 100m sandbag lunges, and to finish, 100 throws and catches of a medicine ball.\n\n\"I've always been involved in sport in my whole life really,\" Stockley said.\n\n\"I was a competitive swimmer and runner from a young age.\n\n\"When I went to university I enjoyed a lot of hockey but after that I got into a bit of CrossFit, so I've sort of done everything.\n\n\"With CrossFit I enjoyed the Olympic lifting but it compromised my running quite a bit and that's when I saw Hyrox as this big fitness event and thought I'd like to give that a go.\"\n\nStockley's Hyrox debut came at an open event in Birmingham with her performance earning her qualification for the World Championships in Chicago.\n\n\"I was like 'right I actually need to do a bit of training for this,'\" she said.\n\n\"I did first pro in Glasgow, the weights increased and I won that in my age group.\n\n\"I was fifth in my age group at World Champs in 2025 and it's been going in a nice trajectory ever since.\"\n\nIn her first year of professional Hyrox races, Stockley could have been forgiven for easing herself into the sport, but by the year's end she had set a world record alongside Alexandra Hill, Saskia Geddes and Allana Falconer.\n\n\"I'd met them before but we'd never actually raced together so we were sort of put together in this team,\" Stockley recalled.\n\n\"It was never an aim for us [to set a world record]. We were always going to give it a good go, it was the last race of London Hyrox, so it was like, 'right let's do this.'\n\n\"We looked up at the board and said 'oh my gosh I think this is a world record', it was a surprise but we went as hard as we could.\n\n\"Once we'd finished I think the realisation set in and the announcer realised 'oh my God this is a world record'\".\n\nStockley is now preparing for the Elite 15 competition in Phoenix, Arizona which serves as one of four Hyrox majors.\n\nThe State Farm Stadium, home to NFL's Arizona Cardinals, will serve as host for the event, with Stockley competing in the singles on 29 January before returning two days later for the age group doubles.\n\nThe top three finishers at each earn automatic qualification to June's World Championships in Sweden.\n\nStockley says competition will be fierce.\n\n\"To be with those top girls, they're running under that hour mark so that's definitely a goal,\" she said.",

    "title": "What's New in Pandas 3",
    "description": "pandas 3.0 has just been released. This article uses a real‑world example to explain the most important differences between pandas 2 and...",
    "fullText": "You can connect with me on \n LinkedIn\n to discuss collaborations and work opportunities.\n\nYou can also follow me on\n Twitter,\n Bluesky and\n Mastodon.\n\npandas 3.0 has just been released. This article uses a real‑world example to\nexplain the most important differences between pandas 2 and the new pandas 3\nrelease, focusing on performance, syntax, and user experience.\n\nBefore diving into the technical details of pandas 3, it is worth providing\nsome context on how pandas is developed and what to expect from its release cycle.\n\nMany software projects develop new features in parallel between major releases.\nIf pandas followed this model, development might look like this:\n\nThis is often what users expect. In reality, pandas development follows a\ndifferent approach:\n\npandas does not develop features in parallel across major versions. Instead,\nnew features land continuously on the main development line and are included\nin the next release once they are ready (for example 2.1). As a result,\npandas 3.0 does not include everything developed since pandas 2.0 (released\nalmost three years ago), but primarily what has been added since pandas 2.3,\nwhich was released roughly six months ago.\n\nMost importantly, the pandas developers consistently prioritize backward\ncompatibility. Instead of continuously breaking APIs to improve everything\nthat can be improved, we aim to fix what can reasonably be fixed without\nforcing users to rewrite their codebases. Users maintaining large pandas\nprojects, or those who simply do not want to relearn pandas syntax every\nyear, will likely appreciate this philosophy.\n\nThe downside of this conservative approach is that pandas cannot always offer\nstate‑of‑the‑art performance or a clean and consistent API, and instead will suffer\nfrom some design decisions that made sense a couple of decades ago, but that we would\nimplement differently if we started pandas today. For users starting fresh with\ndataframe‑based projects, it is worth considering Polars,\nwhich could learn from pandas experience to deliver a dataframe library with\nimpressive performance, full Arrow support, and a cleaner and more consistent API.\n\nThat said, pandas 3 still introduces several significant changes that improve\nperformance, syntax, and the overall user experience. Let’s take a closer look.\n\nThe examples in this article use a dataset containing 2,231,577 hotel room records,\nwith the following structure:\n\nWe will start with pandas 2. Our first operation is to add the maximum number of children\na room can accommodate to the maximum number of people (adults), but only for U.S. hotels.\n\nThis produces the infamous warning:\n\nIf you have used pandas for any length of time, you have almost certainly\nseen this before. What is happening can be summarized as follows:\n\nIn practice, most users do not fully understand the underlying issue and handle\nthe warning in one of two ways (often based on advice from StackOverflow or a chatbot):\n\nThe standard solution to this class of problems is copy‑on‑write:\n\nAfter countless hours of work that began well before pandas 3, copy‑on‑write is\nnow fully implemented. The warning is gone, and all the .copy() calls in pandas\ncode can be safely avoided after moving to pandas 3.\n\nLet's revisit the same example, this time focusing on syntax rather than memory behavior.\nFor users who write pandas pipelines rather than interactively exploring data in a notebook,\nthe previous example can be rewritten using method chaining:\n\nThis style avoids repeated assignments and makes the sequence of operations explicit.\nHowever, while method chaining itself makes the code more readable, many users will find\nthis version harder to read, largely because of the required use of lambda,\nwhich is a non‑trivial pandas concept.\n\nIn pandas, column access typically uses either df.column or df[\"column\"].\nWith method chaining, however, the intermediate DataFrame object does not exist as a\nnamed variable at each step. Even if we create df, the df in the assign operation\nis not the DataFrame object at the time of assigning (with only U.S. hotel data), but\nthe original DataFrame with all rows:\n\nThe use of lambda delays evaluation so that column expressions are resolved\nagainst the correct intermediate DataFrame. While effective, this approach using\nlambda makes reading pandas code significantly harder. Other libraries such as\nPolars and PySpark address this more cleanly using a col() expression API.\n\npandas 3 introduces the same mechanism:\n\nThis is a significant step forward, making pandas code much more readable, in particular\nwhen using method chaining. But there is still room for improvement. For comparison,\nthe equivalent filter in Polars looks like this:\n\nUsing an explicit .filter() method makes the operation being performed clearer.\nExperienced Python developers will be familiar with Tim Peter's brilliant\nZen of Python which states that\n\"explicit is better than implicit\". Using df[...] for both filtering and selection is\nsurely convenient, \n\nMore importantly, pandas still relies on the bitwise & operator for combining conditions.\nIdeally, users would write condition1 and condition2, but Python reserves and for\nboolean evaluation and does not allow libraries to override it.\n\nUsing & leads to this surprising behavior:\n\nThe expression is evaluated as 1 == (1 & 2) == 2, not (1 == 1) and (2 == 2).\nThe same happens when each side of the & is a pandas expression. This is why in the previous\nexample [(pandas.col(\"property_type\") == \"hotel\") & (pandas.col(\"country\") == \"us\")] \nconditions must be carefully parenthesized.\n\nSince overriding and, or, and not is not possible in Python, and not likely to be allowed\nanytime soon, the Polars approach is probably the best it can be done. Implementing .filter() and\nallowing passing multiple conditions as different arguments is something that could be\nimplemented in pandas, and will hopefully be available to users in a future version.\n\nAnother important improvement in pandas 3 is better support for user‑defined functions (UDFs).\nIn pandas, UDFs are regular Python functions passed to methods such as .apply() or .map().\n\nIf you have used pandas for a while, you have probably heard that .apply() is considered bad practice:\n\nThis reputation is often deserved. For example, adding max_people and max_children row‑by‑row:\n\nproduces the same result as the vectorized version, but increases execution time from roughly 3 ms\nto 11 seconds (around 4,000x slower).\n\nHowever, not all problems vectorize cleanly. Consider transforming a room name such as\n\"Superior Double Room with Patio View\" into a structured string like:\n\nA fully vectorized solution quickly becomes complex and hard to maintain.\nThis implementation takes around 14 seconds with the example dataset:\n\nThe equivalent UDF is (at least in my opinion) far clearer:\n\nThis version runs in about 22 seconds, roughly 70% slower than the\nvectorized approach, but is far easier to read and maintain.\n\npandas 3 introduces a new execution interface that allows third‑party\nengines to accelerate UDFs. One example is bodo.ai,\nwhich can JIT‑compile both pure Python and pandas code:\n\nWith bodo.ai, the same code runs in around 9 seconds, less than half of\nthe time needed with the standard UDF version, and also 35% faster than\nthe vectorized version. And this speed-up is gained while retaining the\nclarity of the UDF implementation.\n\nAlthough a 35% speed‑up may not sound dramatic, JIT compilation has a\nfixed startup cost, the time to compile the code, which does not depend\non the amount of data processed later. As datasets grow larger, the\nrelative gains increase substantially. For very large datasets,\nthe difference can be dramatic. So, in this example, if we had 100\nmillion rows instead of 2, using bodo.ai would improve performance massively.\n\nCrucially, execution now happens outside pandas itself. This opens the door\nto an ecosystem of specialized execution engines. For example,\nBlosc can accelerate NumPy‑style\nworkloads using compressed memory execution, and works with pandas 3 as\nsimply as bodo, just by using engine=blosc2.jit(). Enabling this ecosystem\nadds endless possibilities. For example, bodo.ai also supports distributed\nexecution on HPC clusters, and other engines may emerge for different use-cases\nand different strategies.\n\nIf you read my earlier article pandas 2.0 and the Arrow revolution,\nyou may be wondering what became of that effort.\n\nAt the time pandas 2 was being released, the core team was committed to\nimplement a more aggressive transition to Apache Arrow. Primarily, to make\nsure users could always benefit from the performance and compatibility enhancements\nArrow provides. This would be particularly relevant for strings, where the legacy\nimplementation is really suboptimal compared to the Arrow one. Ultimately,\nthis plan was scaled back. This is in short what happened:\n\nWith an example, the new strings look like this:\n\nIn the example, the data type is the new str type, and the missing value is\nrepresented by NaN, and when comparing NaN == \"a\" the return is False.\nYou can't know whether the code above uses NumPy's objects internally, or\nArrow strings, since that depends on the environment and not the code itself.\n\nMissing values are not the float NaN anymore but pandas <NA> which is not\nexactly a value itself, but a reference to whether the value is missing or not.\nIn Arrow, a separate array is used to establish which values are missing.\nThe main difference in the example is that <NA> == \"a\" in this case returns\n<NA> and not False as the default pandas 3 implementation.\n\nI'm not personally aware of any current plan or effort to change the pandas 3\nstatus quo significantly. While the new approach is a good trade-off between\nbackward compatibility and allowing users to benefit from Arrow by default, it\ncomes with its drawbacks. Now there are 3 different ways to represent strings,\nsince the PyArrow example above is still valid in pandas 3, as it would be\nsetting dtype=\"object\" and using the original implementation. It may also not\nbe ideal for some users to have the same code running with different implementation\ndepending on whether PyArrow is installed or not. This can be tricky for example\nfor developers of other libraries, who can't make assumptions on what a pandas\nstring is internally.\n\nClearly, the users that will benefit more from the new pandas 3 strings are users\nwith existing codebases concerned about backward compatibility. While the new\nchanges are not fully backward compatible, migrating to pandas 3 should be really\nstraightforward.\n\nUsers who need a simpler and modern dataframe experience based on Arrow, and are\nless concerned about pandas legacy, Polars is a great alternative.\n\nYou can connect with me on \n LinkedIn\n to discuss collaborations and work opportunities.\n\nYou can also follow me on\n Twitter,\n Bluesky and\n Mastodon.",

However, after this upcoming season, the picture at the position becomes a major focus. Outside of two Braves starters, there are no pitchers currently under contract beyond that point.\n\n“Beyond Spencer Strider and Spencer Schwellenbach, there are no clear locks for the Atlanta Braves rotation beyond 2026,’” HTHB’s Chase Owens wrote.\n\nThe Braves are content with the starters they have this season, but there comes a point when the future must be considered. Atlanta reportedly checked in on Milwaukee Brewers ace Freddy Peralta before he was traded. Anthopoulos knows the team needs another starter, but it cannot be just anyone.\n\n“We’ve explored the starting rotation, adding and getting some type of starter, whether that’s trade or signing. We’d like for it to be someone impactful, someone we think can start a playoff game,” Anthopoulos said.\n\nThere is still a name on the market that the Braves could pursue: Framber Valdez. FanSided’s Mark Powell believes Atlanta can get a deal done.\n\n“But Valdez is the best starting pitcher available after Ranger Suarez signed with the Boston Red Sox. His catcher cross-up could cost him some money on what's been a slow market for free-agent starting pitchers. That should only help a team like the Braves, which has an elite rotation (when healthy) but quite frankly needs more bodies. Adding Valdez to a group that already includes Chris Sale, Spencer Strider and Reynaldo Lopez is borderline unfair,” Powell wrote.\n\nThe Braves would benefit greatly from adding Valdez, as it would give the rotation two left-handers and create a nightmare matchup for opposing teams. Atlanta’s rotation is already strong, but this type of move could elevate it to an elite level.\n\nValdez is still chasing another World Series championship, and there may be no better opportunity than joining the team that once defeated the Houston Astros on the game’s biggest stage. Anthopoulos still has room to make another offseason addition as Spring Training approaches.",

He was joined on 265 by Americans Ryan Gerard, Matt McCarty and Andrew Putnam, Gerard posting a seven-under 65 and McCarty and Putnam each signing for a 68.\n\nScheffler, 29, became the first player since Tiger Woods to grab his 20th US PGA Tour title before the age of 30.

During the managerial search for the right fit, the position was an attractive one given the talent on the roster. Ultimately, the Orioles decided to hire Craig Albernaz.\n\n“The Orioles’ search for a new manager is over. Baltimore has hired Cleveland associate manager Craig Albernaz to become its skipper, the club announced Monday,” MLB.com’s Jake Rill wrote.\n\nThe Orioles have had a huge offseason so far, even though most of their moves came at the start of free agency. Acquiring Pete Alonso was a major coup, alongside several other additions. With some names still left on the market, Baltimore could also pursue Framber Valdez.\n\n“Baltimore has already committed $195 million to four free agents -- Pete Alonso, Ryan Helsley, Zach Eflin and Leody Taveras -- ranking sixth in spending thus far. But general manager Mike Elias, entering the final year of his contract, has one more haymaker left: Framber Valdez. With Ranger Suárez landing $130 million over five years in Boston, Valdez projects to get around six years and $180 million -- a deal that would vault the O's past the Dodgers and Blue Jays as baseball's top free agent spenders,” ESPN’s Paul Hembekides wrote.\n\nAdding Valdez would be huge for the Orioles, bolstering their rotation significantly. Part of the reason his free-agent market has dragged on is the controversy over a questionable pitch-crossing incident.\n\n“Both Framber Valdez and César Salazar were brought into the manager’s office after the game. Valdez is said to have apologized to Salazar but said the cross-up was not on purpose,” JomBoy Media wrote.\n\nIf the cross-up wasn’t intentional, then Valdez has no character concerns, allowing the Orioles to pursue the World Series–winning lefty without hesitation. Baltimore is eager to return to the playoffs after their 100-win season just a couple of years ago.\n\nValdez would likely play a major role in that push, as the Orioles aim to rebound after a disappointing 2025.

    "description": "World’s top TikTok creator Khaby Lame seals a $900 million deal, becoming a controlling shareholder as the creator economy shifts toward equity ownership",
    "fullText": "Khaby Lame, the Senegalese-born TikTok star with the largest following on the platform, has struck a landmark commercial deal valued at approximately $900 million, marking one of the most significant monetisation moves ever by a global digital creator.\n\nThe transaction involves the partial sale of his company, Step Distinctive Limited, to Rich Sparkle Holdings, a United States-listed firm that disclosed the acquisition alongside a broader strategic partnership focused on scaling Lame’s commercial operations worldwide.\n\nUnder the agreement, Rich Sparkle, through its operating partners, will hold exclusive rights to Khaby Lame’s global commercial activities for an initial period of 36 months.\n\nThese rights cover brand partnerships, endorsements, licensing, and e-commerce ventures, signalling a shift from traditional influencer marketing to a platform-driven business model.\n\nRich Sparkle estimates that the integrated structure combining traffic, fulfilment, operations, and proprietary technology could eventually generate more than $4 billion in annual sales once fully implemented.\n\nAs part of the deal, Khaby Lame will become a controlling shareholder in Rich Sparkle Holdings, positioning him not just as a creative partner but as an equity stakeholder in the commercial infrastructure built around his brand.\n\n“This is not just an equity acquisition, but a revolution in the global content e-commerce model,” the company said, adding that the combination of a US-listed platform, globally recognised content IP, and supply chain expertise could unlock unprecedented shareholder value.\n\nThe rollout of the commercial strategy will initially focus on the United States, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia, with execution planned over the next three years. Rich Sparkle will work with Anhui Xiaoheiyang Network Technology Co., Ltd., a China-based content commerce operator with experience in large-scale creator-led e-commerce.\n\nKhaby Lame rose to global prominence through silent, minimalist videos that humorously dismantle overly complicated life hacks. His wordless format has allowed him to transcend language barriers and build a vast, culturally diverse audience at remarkable speed.\n\nHe currently commands an estimated 360 million followers across social media platforms, making him one of the most influential digital figures in the world and a rare example of truly global creator reach.\n\nBeyond conventional commerce, the agreement also authorises the development of an AI-powered digital twin of Lame, enabling regulated use of his facial features, voice patterns, and behavioural cues.\n\nRich Sparkle says this could support multilingual content, virtual livestreams, and round-the-clock engagement.\n\nThe broader strategy also includes premium brand collaborations and co-branded intellectual property in sectors such as beauty, fragrance, and apparel, highlighting how creator influence is increasingly being transformed into long-term industrial-scale businesses.",

    "description": "More than 36,500 Iranians were killed by security forces during the January 8-9 crackdown on nationwide protests, making it the deadliest two-day protest massacre in history, according to documents reviewed by Iran International's Editorial Board.",
    "fullText": "For more than two weeks and counting, the country has existed inside a manufactured silence. The public internet, the basic infrastructure of modern life, has been reduced to rumor and fragments. What remains functional are the regime’s approved channels, whitelisted networks that keep the state connected to itself while cutting the country off from civic circulation.\n\nFrom outside Iran, this condition is often described as another episode of unrest. From inside, it feels closer to a new revolution that has already cost the country thousands of lives.\n\nIran has experienced a massacre and entered a post-massacre moment, a phase in which the state no longer performs restraint. It kills, buries, rewrites the narrative, and disconnects.\n\nThe blackout is not a byproduct of disorder. It is part of the machinery. Violence is easier to carry out when it is harder to document, and easier to deny when proof is delayed, partial, or erased.\n\nFrom the studio of The Program with Kambiz Hosseini, where Iranians have been calling into a live call-in program broadcast to Iran, the question no longer sounds abstract. It sounds prosecutorial.\n\nWhat, exactly, does the world believe it is watching?\n\nThe calls do not arrive as speeches. They arrive as exertion, as voices pushing through dead air and dropped connections.\n\nAli, calling from Mazandaran in northern Iran, addresses the security forces directly. “You do not need to put your weapon down. No one is afraid of you.” He repeats it, not as bravado, but as fact. Fear, he suggests, is no longer the organizing principle.\n\nPouria, calling from Shiraz in southern Iran, offers a different register. “We did not abandon a single wounded person, and we did not allow anyone to be left behind or written off.” The language is practical, almost logistical. It describes a moral line that held even as institutions collapsed. Do not leave anyone behind.\n\nBahram, from a working-class neighborhood in southern Tehran, explains why he went into the streets. “For my country, and for my children.” It is not an ideological statement. It is an intergenerational one.\n\nMahsa, from Najafabad, asks for something simpler. “I want to tell the story of my city.” The request itself is an indictment. In Iran today, telling the story of a place can be an act of defiance.\n\nFrom the southern port city of Bandar Abbas, Alia’s anger is controlled and unsentimental. “You thought we were afraid. We are not afraid. We are angry, and we are waiting.” She repeats it, sharpening the point. “They think we are afraid. We are not. We are angry, and we are waiting.” She does not ask to be comforted. She asks to be heard.\n\nThese voices share a quality that has become rare in authoritarian systems. They are unembellished. They do not seek spectacle. They insist on being recorded.\n\nThat insistence recalls the life of Raha Bohlouli-Pour, a university student who was shot and killed by Iranian security forces near Fatemi Square in Tehran on January 8, 2026. Raha, whose name in Farsi means free, was interested in art and music, according to her online profiles.\n\nShe was not an organizer or a public figure. She carried no slogans and belonged to no faction. In a political culture trained to search for enemies, she was unexceptional.\n\nRaha did not die because she exercised power or issued demands. She died because she embodied a way of being the state has learned to fear. Her generation does not aspire to heroic gestures or sacrificial myths. It seeks something quieter and more difficult to suppress, the right to live an ordinary life with dignity, continuity, and attention. To breathe without permission. To imagine tomorrow without explanation.\n\nShe left behind no manifesto. What remains are fragments, short reflections, carefully chosen lines. Her language returns again and again to elemental concerns, breathing, continuing, tomorrow. Even when fear appears, it is not dramatized. Her writing is restrained and lucid. If it is political, it is so in the most basic sense. It insists that being alive is not negotiable.\n\nOne detail matters. Raha wrote names. She named detainees and the missing. She recorded people as people, not as abstractions. She understood how repression begins, not with bullets, but with erasure. Violence becomes easier once names disappear and individuals dissolve into numbers.\n\nThat is why the callers matter. They produce the most destabilizing thing such a state can face, a record. Names. Places. Timelines. Descriptions of fear moving through neighborhoods, and of solidarity moving faster. Strangers pulling one another out of danger. Shopkeepers closing doors. Families taking risks that would be unthinkable in a normal society.\n\nNavid, a physician from Tehran, describes hospitals overwhelmed, security forces stationed inside wards, families pleading for information, and staff pushed beyond exhaustion into something closer to moral injury. He does not sound ideological. He sounds like someone trying, with diminishing success, to remain human inside a system designed to punish humanity.\n\nThe numbers, always and only the numbers, arrive as estimates.\n\nOne widely cited figure suggests the death toll may exceed twenty thousand. Whether the final count is higher or lower will matter to historians and prosecutors. The deeper point is simpler. The state has made counting dangerous, and then uses uncertainty as camouflage.\n\nThis is what post-massacre means.\n\nNot only that people have been killed, but that proving they were killed becomes a second battlefield.\n\nPeople no longer sound shocked. They sound worn down by the reliability of cruelty.\n\nIran today is no longer merely in internal crisis. When a government treats its own population as an enemy force, the consequences do not remain contained. They ripple outward through refugee flows, regional instability, and a precedent that other regimes quietly study.\n\nThe calls continue coming into the show. Not because a phone line can defeat a security apparatus, but because history is written by those who insist on being counted as human.\n\nThe state can disrupt the signal. It cannot fully erase the insistence.\n\nThat insistence, name by name and breath by breath, may be the most dangerous thing in Iran right now.\n\nWhat we are witnessing in Iran today can be categorized as a crime against humanity.",

    "fullText": "The agreement reflects a shared commitment to ensure that anyone who wishes to train, compete, or pursue a sporting dream is able to do so.\n\nMaccabi World Union and the TOM – Tikkun Olam Makers – initiative signed a new strategic partnership last week aimed at advancing inclusive and accessible sport for people with disabilities, with a particular focus on IDF disabled veterans, ahead of the Maccabiah Games in the summer of 2026.\n\nThe agreement reflects a shared commitment to ensure that anyone who wishes to train, compete, or pursue a sporting dream is able to do so through practical, affordable, and accessible solutions. The partnership is expected to extend beyond the 2026 Maccabiah and continue toward the Paralympic Games in 2028.\n\nMaccabi World Union, the largest Jewish sports organization in the world and the organizer of the Maccabiah, will work alongside TOM, an Israeli–international initiative dedicated to developing low-cost solutions for people with disabilities. Together, the organizations will develop tools and technologies that enable participation in sport, particularly for IDF disabled veterans. These solutions will be made freely available worldwide through TOM’s platform.\n\nThe collection of solutions will be named after Professor Sir Ludwig Guttmann, a Holocaust survivor and widely regarded as the father of the Paralympic Games, and will be presented during the Maccabiah. An international innovation conference on inclusive sports is also planned ahead of the opening of the Games.\n\nAs part of the initiative, TOM and Maccabi World Union will collaborate with the IDF Disabled Veterans Organization, Beit Halochem rehabilitation centers, the Paralympic Association and Committee, and additional bodies to identify barriers that prevent people with disabilities from participating in sport and to map needs directly from the field.\n\nThe development of solutions for the wounded is part of a joint initiative with the Rehabilitation Division and MAFAT at the Ministry of Defense, and the Casualties and Disabled Soldiers Department of the IDF (Personnel Directorate).\n\nThe partnership also includes plans to establish an innovation complex in “Maccabiah City” ahead of the 2026 Games, featuring a “Master Workshop” where athletes and visitors will be able to observe the development of Paralympic equipment and new technological solutions.\n\nMaccabi World Union CEO Roy Hessing said the Maccabiah represents more than competition.\n\n“The Maccabiah is far more than a sporting event – it is a declaration of unity and the triumph of the Jewish spirit before the entire world,” he said. “This year, with delegations from more than 50 countries, we have an opportunity to show how Israel turns the challenges of injury into extraordinary achievements. The partnership with TOM and the IDF Disabled Veterans Organization is designed to ensure that no physical barrier prevents our heroes – men and women alike – from returning to the field. We are building a pathway that begins with rehabilitation and ends on the Maccabiah podium, rooted in a deep belief in the power of sport to build both body and soul.”\n\nTOM founder Gidi Grinstein said the collaboration would have a global impact.\n\n“This collaboration with Maccabi World Union will create the largest portfolio of solutions in the world for participation in sport by people with disabilities,” he said. “It is a true breakthrough for IDF disabled veterans and for people with disabilities in Israel and around the world. Israel is among the global leaders in rehabilitation, and we are proud to contribute to that leadership together with Maccabi World Union and Jewish communities worldwide. For us, this is a mission and a partnership with one of the most significant Jewish organizations in the world.”",

    "fullText": "LONDON (AP) — No more fawning praise. No more polite workarounds and old-style diplomacy. And no one is calling Donald Trump “daddy” now.\n\nEuropean leaders who scrambled for a year to figure out how to deal with an emboldened American president in his second term edged closer to saying “no,” or something diplomatically like it, to his disregard for international law and his demands for their territory. Trump's vow to take over Greenland and punish any country that resists, seems to have been the crucible.\n\n\"Red lines\" were deemed to have been crossed this year when Trump abruptly revived his demand that the United States “absolutely” must rule Greenland, the semiautonomous region that is part of NATO ally Denmark. That pushed even the most mild-mannered diplomats to issue sharp warnings against Trump, whom they had flattered withroyal treatment and fawning praise.\n\n“Britain will not yield\" its support for Greenland's sovereignty, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said. Several of the continent's leaders said “Europe will not be blackmailed” over Greenland.\n\n“Threats have no place among allies,” said Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre.\n\nThe tough diplomatic talk around the showdown last week in Davos, Switzerland, was not the only factor pressuring Trump. U.S. congressional elections are approaching in November amid a sinking stock market and wilting approval ratings. European leaders also are not the first to stand in Trump's way during his second term — see Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.\n\nBut the dramatic turnabout among Europe's elite, from “appeasing” Trump to defying him, offers clues in the ongoing effort among some nations of how to say “no” to a president who hates hearing it and is known to retaliate.\n\n“We want a piece of ice for world protection, and they won’t give it,” Trump told his audience at the World Economic Forum. “You can say yes, and we will be very appreciative. Or you can say no, and we will remember.”\n\nIn recent days, Europe offered abundant refusals to go along with Trump, from his Greenland demand and joining his new Board of Peace and even to what Canada's Mark Carney called the “fiction” that the alliance functions for the benefit of any country more than the most powerful. The moment marked a unity among European leaders that they had struggled to achieve for a year.\n\n“When Europe is not divided, when we stand together and when we are clear and strong also in our willingness to stand up for ourselves, then the results will show,” Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said. “I think we have learned something.”\n\nFederiksen herself exemplified the learning curve. A year ago, she and other leaders were on their heels and mostly responding to the Trump administration. She found it necessary to tell reporters in February 2025, “We are not a bad ally,” after Vice President JD Vance had said Denmark was “not being a good ally.”\n\nTrump is transactional. He has little use for diplomacy and no “need (for) international law,” he told The New York Times this month. Therein lay the disconnect between typically collaborative European leaders and the Republican president when he blazed back into the White House saying he wanted the U.S. to take over Greenland, Panama and perhaps even Canada.\n\n“In Trump's first term, Europe didn't know what to expect and tried to deal with him by using the old rules of diplomacy, with the expectation that, if they kept talking to him in measured terms, that he would change his behavior and move into the club,” said Mark Shanahan, associate professor of political engagement at the University of Surrey,.\n\n“It's very hard for other leaders who deal with each other through the niceties of a rules-based system and diplomatic conversation,\" Shanahan said. \"It is hard for them to change.”\n\nFive months after Trump's inauguration last year, with his Greenland threat in the air, European leaders had gotten their heads around Trump management enough to pull off a meeting of NATO nations in the Netherlands. NATO members agreed to contribute more and widely gave Trump credit for forcing them to modernize.\n\nSecretary-General Mark Rutte, known as the coalition's “Trump whisperer,\" likened the president's role quieting the Iran-Israel war to a “daddy” intervening in a schoolyard brawl.\n\nLesson 2: Consider saying no — and make choices accordingly\n\nTraditional diplomacy exists to preserve possibilities of working together. That often means avoiding saying a flat “no” if possible. But Trump's Greenland gambit was so stark a threat from one NATO member to another that Greenland's prime minister actually said the word.\n\n“Enough,” Jens-Frederik Nielsen said in a statement shortly after Trump's remarks Jan. 5. “No more pressure. No more hints. No more fantasies about annexation.”\n\nThat played a part in setting the tone. Denmark's leader said any such invasion of Greenland would mark the end of NATO and urged alliance members to take the threat seriously.\n\nThey did, issuing statement after statement rejecting the renewed threat. Trump responded last weekend from his golf course in Florida with a threat to charge a 10% import tax within a month on goods from eight European nations — Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Finland. The rate, he wrote, would climb to 25% on June 1 if no deal was in place for “the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland” by the United States.\n\nLesson 3: Reject Trump's big-power paradigm\n\nTrump's fighting words lit a fire among leaders arriving in Davos. But they seemed to recognize, too, that the wider Trump world left him vulnerable.\n\n“Trump was in a fairly weak position because he has a lot of other looming problems going on,” domestically, including an upcoming U.S. Supreme Court decision on his tariffs and a backlash to immigration raids in Minnesota, said Duncan Snidal, professor emeritus of international relations at Oxford University and the University of Chicago.\n\nCanada's Carney said no by reframing the question not as being about Greenland, but about whether it was time for European countries to build power together against a “bully\" — and his answer was yes.\n\nWithout naming the U.S. or Trump, Carney spoke bluntly: Europe, he said, should reject the big power's “coercion” and “exploitation.\" It was time to accept, he said, that a “rupture” in the alliance, not a transition, had occurred.\n\nUnsaid, Snidel pointed out, was that the rupture was very new, and though it might be difficult to repair in the future, doing so under adjusted rules remains in U.S. and European interests beyond Trump's presidency. “It's too good a deal for all of them not to,” Snidel said.\n\nBefore Trump stepped away from the podium in Davos, he had begun to back down.\n\nHe canceled his threat to use “force” to take over Greenland. Not long after, he reversed himself fully, announcing “the framework\" for a deal that would make his tariff threat unnecessary.\n\nTrump told Fox Business that “we’re going to have total access to Greenland,” under the “framework,\" without divulging what that might mean.\n\nFrederiksen hit the warning button again. In a statement, she said, “We cannot negotiate on our sovereignty.\"",

    "fullText": "Random thoughts while waiting on the release of the new Super Bowl commercials.\n\nThe sight of Cubs star Pete-Crow Armstrong and Bears star Caleb Williams hanging out together at the Blackhawks and Bulls games was a nice way to portray Chicago as the biggest small town in America. Los Angeles has its Hollywood culture and New York is the media center of the world, but nowhere are the local sports stars as big a deal as they are in Chicago.\n\nIt’s nothing new, of course. Chicago’s stars have always supported each other. When the Bears played at Wrigley Field, Bobby Hull was a season ticket holder, and Billy Williams used to get tickets for games from Bears receiver Dick Gordon.\n\nThe budding bromance of Crow-Armstrong and Williams should last a long time, or at least until the Cubs and Bears sign them to massive deals.\n\nOne of the primary requisites of the job of commissioner of a major sports league should be the ability to project strength. But the commissioners of the NFL, NBA, NHL and Major League Baseball are all weaklings, as evidenced by a report from The Athletic that Roger Goodell, Adam Silver, Gary Bettman and Rob Manfred will meet with President Donald Trump to help promote America 250, a celebration of the country’s 250th birthday.\n\nWhile Trump’s jackboots instill fear in Minneapolis, Chicago and other American cities, and he embarrasses the country on the international stage, these four pretend leaders will be posing for photo-ops in the Oval Office and pretending all is right with the country. None of them has the courage to speak out against what’s happening in America.\n\nLucky for them, they’re only beholden to the billionaire owners of their league’s teams, not the average fans who support their respective sports.\n\nESPN’s Pat McAfee has always appealed to the lowest common denominator, so it’s no surprise the clueless commentator is taking on unidentified media members who point out his lame frat boy act, calling them “fat … lazy nerds” on his TV show.\n\nMcAfee also tweeted that sports journalists “hate what sports are for people (happiness). They hate what sports are for society (unifier) … they’re political journalists by nature who’ve preyed on sports because they saw it as an easier path to ‘make it.’ Their days are numbered … my show being broadcasted on ESPN 10 hours a week with ZERO creative say from any ‘journalism school’ puppets is living proof of that.”\n\nActually, the audience of McAfee’s show is relatively tiny, or else it would be in a better time slot than in the early afternoon, when everyone else is working. He’s already wearing thin on college football fans, and sooner or later the ratings will slide and ESPN will pull the plug and send him off to UFC analysis, where he belongs.\n\nIllinois is having another stellar season, thanks to a deep team led by freshman Keaton Wagler. The 11th-ranked Illini are 17-3 after Saturday’s 88-82 road win over Purdue and in contention for the Big Ten title.\n\nAnd when the Illini are winning, coach Brad Underwood is at his most ornery, as when he recently sparred with an Illinois reporter who praised Tomislav Ivišić for a good game against Northwestern despite what he called an “up-and-down season.”\n\n“You guys say he’s been up and down,” Underwood shot back. “I just say his role changed. You guys create more damn narratives that are full of (bleep). That’s what he does. That’s why he’s been on draft boards. He’s big and can shoot the cover off of it. … No one has ever doubted Tommy.”\n\nLove him or hate him, Underwood is never afraid to speak his mind.\n\nKudos to White Sox general manager Chris Getz for immediately spending the $20 million he saved by dumping Luis Robert Jr.’s contract, signing reliever Seranthony Dominguez to a two-year, $20 million deal. Now maybe he can move Grant Taylor into the rotation where he belongs.\n\nMike Berman was a professional and a hardworking sports reporter willing to work long hours at NBC-5. A Glenbrook North alumnus who grew up rooting for Chicago teams, he did his job for 10 years without calling attention to himself. His work spoke for itself.\n\nBerman, who was let go by the station last week, deserved a better fate. Hopefully he winds up on another local station that will appreciate his work ethic.\n\nTerry Boers, who died Friday at age 75, was remembered by most as a radio host and an original member of The Score. But he was also a great newspaperman. Boers and I competed on the Illini basketball beat for one season back in the early 1990s, when he was still at the Chicago Sun-Times. He was as good a beat writer as there was and handed me my lunch on many occasions.\n\nBoers eventually found his way to radio, where he could put his brash personality into his job. He became a legend at WSCR-AM 670, along with the other originals such as Mike North, Tom Shaer and Dan McNeil. There will never be another quite like Boers, which is why his death has brought so many tributes from colleagues.\n\nCubs manager Craig Counsell is a Green Bay Packers fan, but he assured the media he is not a Bears hater. “Look, I grew up a Packers fan for sure,” he said before the Cubs Convention. “The Bears have struggled for a while, and so when a team hasn’t done well for a whole and starts to do well, you see what it does to a city. You feel it. That part of me knows what it’s doing for the city, and you root for that a little bit.”\n\nAsked who would be booed \n\nIt’s a tough call, but my guess is Counsell is still Public Enemy No. 1 among cheeseheads.",

    "description": "EY's global chief innovation officer, Joe Depa, said he advises his teams to write their own content first and then ask AI to refine it.",
    "fullText": "AI is getting better every day — but EY's global chief innovation officer told Business Insider there are still signs that reveal an AI-generated response.\n\nDepa leads the Big Four firm's global AI, data, and innovation strategy, and part of his job involves overseeing how employees integrate AI.\n\nThat vantage point has given Depa what he calls a \"high sensitivity\" for detecting AI-generated work. While he's all in on the technology and doesn't have set limits on how often employees should use it, he said AI should be used to amplify human creativity, not replace it. He said there are situations where \"it's too much AI,\" and the person hasn't \"infused any of their own original thoughts.\"\n\nIn that case, \"there does become a point of AI becoming a little bit less efficient or effective,\" Depa said. The executive added that it's important to maintain a sense of individuality and style so that everyone doesn't sound the same.\n\nAs companies urge employees to adopt AI, Depa's comments underscore the fine line employees walk between using the technology as a tool and depending on it too heavily.\n\nEven if workers want their bosses to know they're keeping up with the latest tech, they may not want them to know just how much they're relying on it. In a Business Insider survey with 220 respondents, 40% said \"yes\" or \"sometimes\" when asked whether they hide or downplay their AI use at work.\n\nDepa said he notices a few signs that point to AI-generated responses, including mistakes. While AI tools have improved significantly, they can still hallucinate. Here are a few other writing- and presentation-specific examples that point to AI, according to Depa:\n\nWhen it comes to written communication, Depa said there are a few signals that indicate it was generated by AI with minimal human oversight or input. \n\nOne of the most common is neutral and overly formal writing. He added that AI-generated writing may lack personal aspects, emotion, and humor.\n\nThe writing may also be too polished, with no shifts in pattern, structure, or flow. He said AI-generated writing tends to be generic or corporate-sounding, sometimes relying too heavily on buzzwords and descriptors.\n\nAnother red flag is repetitive language, such as relying on the same phrases or sentence structures to open multiple sentences or paragraphs.\n\nIn general, Depa advises his teams to write their own content with the bullets and messaging they want to convey, and then ask an AI tool to refine it. If used correctly, Depa said AI tools can challenge your thinking.\n\n\"If you write it yourself first and then ask for the enhancement using AI, I feel like that's much more productive,\" Depa said.\n\nIn presentations, Depa said an over-reliance on AI results in surface-level insights that lack specific examples. Another giveaway is when topics are addressed too broadly, with little consideration for the audience.\n\nHe also flagged \"hedging,\" which he said AI does by design. He said AI often steers away from clear recommendations and presents alternatives.\n\n\"Anytime you see vagueness or general statements that don't really tell you anything, I would often say that's AI,\" Depa said.",

But we sent a small editorial team to bring you the best of it — BI-style — and I want to tell you about it.\n\nAki Ito is our chief correspondent on careers, a huge topic for Davos — and for us. She asked people across business tough questions about the future of work (believe me, I was in the room) to help bring insights for your success. She also moderated a conversation with chief people officers from companies across the business world. You'll see her takeaways from that soon.\n\nBen Bergman on tech, same thing. Ben is a leading scoop-getter and thinker on our crackerjack tech team. We know you care about tech from every angle — innovation, work, investments, culture, productivity hacks, fun. Ben was all over town meeting with people and moderating panels so that we can be in-the-know on what's in and what's out for you. You might have caught Ben on CNN twice last week!\n\nDan DeFrancesco is the lead writer on this newsletter every weekday. As you know, it's a smart, witty read across tech, markets, and business — the opposite of aggregation that's common in newsletters. So it's important for us to make sure Dan has the widest view of what's going on in the world. As he hustled around, Dan also wrote our new pop-up Davos Diary newsletter every day last week. We hope to do more special editions to meet these moments!\n\nKim Last leads our live journalism — events like panels and conferences IRL, and live conversations online. We put on three events at Davos, convening some of the most interesting and in-the-flow people on the mountain. We'll keep you informed of what's on our calendar, as conversing with the audience we're serving is a top priority at BI right now. (Kim also got a now-famous hair blowout at the start of the week — Davos hack!)\n\nWe know not everyone can make it across the world. That's why, in addition to the special newsletter, we did a daily live blog, bringing you everything from the serious to the wacky. Across last week, we did 180 posts, not just from the five of us, but from reporters and editors who did an excellent job following the chatter from around the world. Those blogs, and our wrap post, are available here.\n\nWhat about me? I was there doing the Davos thing — meetings, moderations. But I also made a point to snap some photos of the fabulous fashion.

    "fullText": "Go 1.26 doesn’t introduce dramatic syntax changes or paradigm shifts — and that’s intentional. Instead, it focuses on the kinds of refinements that matter when you’re running long-lived backend services, high-throughput APIs, or performance-sensitive systems: reducing boilerplate, tightening runtime behavior, and improving tooling where engineers actually feel pain.\n\nThis release is less about learning new tricks and more about removing friction you’ve quietly accepted over the years. From cleaner pointer initialization to a garbage collector tuned for modern workloads, Go 1.26 quietly raises the bar for production Go.\n\nThis article walks through what’s new in Go 1.26, why these changes were introduced, and how they solve real problems, all based strictly on the official Go 1.26 release notes.\n\nGo’s evolution has always favored predictability over novelty. That philosophy is especially visible in Go 1.26.\n\nNone of the changes here force rewrites. None break existing code. But together, they address problems teams hit at scale:\n\nGo 1.26 is about making day-to-day engineering easier, in ways that quietly add up over the years.\n\nGo 1.26 allows new to accept an expression instead of just a type. This removes the need for temporary variables when initializing pointer fields, especially common in API models and configuration structs. It makes intent clearer and code easier to read.\n\nBefore Go 1.26, new could only accept a type. Now it can accept an expression.\n\nIn real systems, pointers are often used to represent optional values, not mutability. This shows up everywhere: JSON APIs,config structs,protobufs.\n\nBefore Go 1.26, initializing pointer fields meant awkward patterns:\n\nThe go fix command is now built on Go’s analysis framework, the same foundation used by go vet. This enables smarter, analyzer-driven code fixes that align with current best practices, making large codebase upgrades safer and more predictable.\n\ngo fix has been rebuilt using the same analysis framework that powers go vet. Old fixers are removed; new ones are analyzer-driven and future-proof.\n\nUpgrading Go versions in large codebases is rarely trivial. Teams want:\n\nThe new go fix is designed for real upgrade workflows, not toy examples.\n\nMultiple documentation commands have been removed in favor of a single go doc entry point. This simplifies documentation access, reduces cognitive overhead, and makes it easier for developers—especially newcomers—to find what they need quickly.\n\nGo 1.26 removes cmd/doc and go tool doc. Everything is consolidated under\n\nThis is a classic example of Go reducing cognitive overhead. Multiple commands existed for historical reasons, not because developers needed them.\n\nSmall change, real usability win.\n\nThe pprof web UI now opens with flame graphs by default. Flame graphs make it immediately clear where CPU time is spent, helping engineers identify bottlenecks faster during performance tuning or incident response.\n\nWhen you open the pprof web UI, it now defaults to flame graphs.\n\nFlame graphs answer the first question engineers ask during performance issues:\n\n“Where is my time actually going?”\n\nThis is tooling evolving to match real-world usage.\n\nLighter, cleaner, and easier on the system — like green tea compared to heavy coffee.\n\nWhat the name implies (but does not technically define)\n\nGreen → better locality, efficiency, and less waste\n\nTea → smooth, steady behavior instead of sharp spikes\n\nThe Green Tea garbage collector, previously experimental, is now the default in Go 1.26.

    "fullText": "The Henderson Silver Knights paid tribute to the International Hockey League’s Las Vegas Thunder, and they did good to live up to the memory of Southern Nevada’s first professional hockey team.\n\nOn Saturday, the Silver Knights relied on late-game heroics and strong defense to ride out a close 4-3 victory over the Tucson Roadrunners.\n\nIt would not take long for the Silver Knights to get themselves on the board. Ten seconds into their first power play, the Silver Knights were able to cash in for an early lead. Lukas Cormier, making his return to the lineup, got a shot off from the point, and Kai Uchacz took advantage of the chaos and finished the play by sliding the puck past Roadrunners goaltender Matthew Villalta to break the ice.\n\nMinutes later, Sloan Stanick would keep his momentum rolling and give his team a cushion. The undrafted forward has already made waves early in his time in Henderson, and he did it again on an incredible solo effort. Getting a turnover in the offensive zone, Stanick launched a wicked shot that beat Villalta clean and secured his third goal in his first five AHL games.\n\n“He’s gotten to the hard areas to score goals,” said head coach Ryan Craig about the rookie. “I think his first two goals were from the top of the crease. His goal tonight, he reloads back above and scores between the hashmarks with a real good shot.”\n\nThe good times would not always last, however. Andrew Agozzino would put Tucson on the board on a quick-developing play to make good on the Roadrunners’ first possession in the offensive zone.\n\nNo change in the score during the second period, but what remained apparent was how aggressive the Silver Knights forecheck was. By the time the second was over, they had limited the Roadrunners to only seven shots.\n\n“They didn’t have any offense,” said forward Tuomas Uronen.\n\nJesper Vikman would be up for the challenge, however, especially on a breakaway save in the second period.\n\n“Every save matters. Obviously, that one maybe meant a little more to our team,” said Vikman.\n\nThe third period would see the Roadrunners catch yet another break. Keeping the play on the offensive zone by mere inches, Tyler Tullio was able to best Vikman on the glove side to tie the game up at two.\n\nHowever, the Henderson power play would once again make the difference. Taking advantage of a prolonged power play and Villalta breaking his stick, Uronen saw his opportunity and beat a Roadrunners defender to the front of the net. The Finn did not miss from point blank range, getting the puck between Villalta’s pads to put the Silver Knights back in the lead.\n\n“There’s moments in games, and I think that was the moment in this game,” said Uronen on the quick play.\n\nUronen would finish the job on another power play, besting Villalta with a beautiful shot off the post and into the net.\n\nAn Austin Poganski deflection would cut the lead back down to one to keep things interesting, but the Silver Knights would close the deal out to take the fans and Thunder alumni home happy.\n\nHowever, Craig wants more as the Silver Knights approach the second half of the season.\n\n“Still learning, still growing,” said Craig about his team. “We haven’t necessarily seen everybody together for a little while, which is okay. Opportunities are here for guys.”",

    "fullText": "Vicky Mboko called Sunday's match at the Australian Open against first-seeded Aryna Sabalenka “a learning curve.”\n\nIf so, the 19-year-old Canadian is catching on very quickly.\n\nSabalenka won in two sets — 6-1, 7-6 (1) to reach the quarterfinals — but Mboko put enormous pressure on the world's top-ranked player in the second set and was a few shots away from forcing a third at Rod Laver Arena.\n\nAfter trailing 4-1 in the second set, Mboko rallied to force the tiebreaker and seemed to have the momentum until Sabalenka did, well, Sabalenka-like things and won her 20th straight tiebreak.\n\n“I think at the end of the day it really came down to experience,” Mboko said. “She played really great tennis. I, of course, had my chances.”\n\n“It was a pretty nice experience being it was my first time on the center court playing against the world No. 1,\" she added.\n\nMboko, No. 16 in the WTA Tour rankings, is becoming famous as a slow starter, which she was in the first set against the top-ranked Sabalenka. But it was different in the second once she seized an opening.\n\n“Trying to find my rhythm as the match went on was important for me,” she said. “I was pretty close in the second set.\"\n\nMboko has been showing off her tennis all across Australia.\n\nShe was the runner-up a week ago in the Adelaide International, losing to Mirra Andreeva in the final 6-3, 6-1.

Sabalenka, who is shooting for her third Australian Open title in four years, also made that point.\n\n“She’s an amazing player,” Sabalenka said of Mboko. “It was quite a fight. I’m super happy that I was able to close this match in straight sets. The second set was a bit tricky.”\n\nSabalenka faces another rising star in American 18-year-old Iva Jovic in the quarterfinals.\n\nMore AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis",

    "description": "Stan Winston and Michael Lantieri detail their real-world practical solutions to creating the film’s huge stars.",
    "fullText": "The jeep heads right for us, the driver so terrified he smashes into a log, shearing the windows and the seat backs clean off as the vehicle skids under, spinning almost out of control. A roar echoes from the dense grove behind the jeep; trees shudder, toppling down, crushed by some monstrous weight. Then it appears, its vast body supported by two powerful legs, its voracious jaws filled with teeth the size of daggers — a living Tyrannosaurus rex. The huge creature gives chase, careening through the mud. The T-rex smashes through the log, reducing it to kindling, then crashes into the jeep, denting its side and upending it into the mud. The driver and his companions stumble from the wreckage as the fearsome beast, more terrifying than any dragon of legend, chases them deep into the dense jungle of Jurassic Park.\n\nThis startling sequence, filmed in a single breathless shot, is one of dozens of collaborations between full-scale dinosaur creator Stan Winston and mechanical effects supervisor Michael Lantieri on Steven Spielberg's long-awaited adventure epic. Along with stop-motion animator Phil Tippett and ILM visual-effects supervisor Dennis Muren, ASC [whose contributions are further detailed in AC July, 1993], Lantieri and Winston round out Jurassic Park's revolutionary dinosaur-design team.\n\nUsing every known effects technique, and some they created out of necessity specifically for Jurassic Park, they may well have done the impossible: given convincing life to an unholy menagerie of creatures who haven't walked the earth in millions of years. It’s an achievement that may well change forever the way we look at effects films.\n\nLantieri and Winston's work was used almost exclusively for the live-action dinosaur effects during principal photography. Together, they helped one another solve problems that have plagued effects experts such as Willis O'Brien from the prehistoric era of cinematic illusion — the silent The Lost Continent and the legendary King Kong — to the present day. “We really worked as one crew,\" Lantieri marvels. “Early on, our four-person design team took this pie, which represented all of the effects in Jurassic Park, and cut it up. We figured who could best do each effect, and then one or the other would say, 'We can go so far with this; can you pick up from here and run with it?'\"\n\nIn the beginning there was Stan Winston. As the multi-Academy Award-winning makeup effects artist will tell you, every dinosaur created for Jurassic Park began on the drawing boards at his Stan Winston Studio in Van Nuys. The bearded makeup impresario is a cagey fox, dazzling his audience with reams of techno-jargon, but the man has undeniably produced some of the most remarkable creations in screen history: the xenomorph queen of Aliens, the Pumpkinhead demon (from the film he also directed), the robotic cyborg of The Terminator and the shape-shifting T-1000 in Mark 'Crash' McCreary.\n\nWhat gives Winston's mechanical marvels their edge seems to be a philosophy stemming from his own humble beginnings as a struggling actor who fell into the field he now dominates almost by accident. \"I got involved in a makeup apprenticeship program while I was waiting to be a star,\" he admits. \"I was a big Lon Chaney fan and I was inspired by him to create wonderful, bizarre and incredible fantasy and real characters for film. When I realized a prosthetic makeup on an actor's face wouldn't allow me to fully realize the characters I was asked to create, I began using special effects technology to create fantasy characters that were completely animatronic puppets. I haven't gone from makeup to special effects; I have increased my palette with more colors that allow me to create characters using all the technology available, be it a makeup, a prosthetic, or dinosaurs for Jurassic Park.\" Unlike others in Winston's field, he sees his creations as characters who have to perform, on cue, like any other actor. This makes his task more demanding, and more rewarding.\n\nOne and a half of Winston's two years on Jurassic Park were spent designing the creatures who populate fictional billionaire John Hammond's bizarre island amusement park. All told, Winston's crew visualized nine different species of dinosaurs, most prominent of which were two-legged predators such as the Tyrannosaurus rex, velociraptors [above], and \"spitters,\" [the dilophosaurus] along with four-footed vegetarians such as triceratops and the mammoth brachiosaurus. \"Steven felt that there should be a consistent dinosaur design,\" Winston explains, \"so even dinosaurs that were only realized in the computer at ILM, such as the ostrich-like gallimimus, were designed here. The approach is very simple and it's what we do on every project: artistically, everything starts on the drawing boards. We're certainly not going to throw two tons of clay at an armature and start sculpting a full-sized Tyrannosaurus rex and hope that it looks great! On Jurassic Park, our concept artist was Mark 'Crash' McCreary, who did all the final renderings of the dinosaurs. The creatures' skin coloring was created by Shane Mahan and John Rosengrant, among many others.\"\n\nOnce the designs were finalized on paper, Winston's crew created 1/5th-scale sculptures of each dinosaur, except for the brachiosaurus, which was so huge in life that Winston opted to do him as a 1/19th-scale model. These clay maquettes were molded, cast in fiberglass and painted not only to show Spielberg what the creatures would look like in three dimensions, but also to serve as the models for the computer-generated dinosaur effects created by Phil Tippett in conjunction with ILM and Dennis Muren. Winston's crew also fabricated 1/5th-scale mechanical versions of each character destined to become a full-scale animatronic puppet.\n\nWinston says it was a brainstorm in the middle of the night that led him to devise a system for exactly translating his miniature dinosaurs into their full-scale counterparts: using cross-sections taken at precise intervals from his 1/5th-scale dinosaurs, he had them blown up five times and made into wooden patterns which were then strung along metal spines. \"We covered the wooden patterns with fiberglass to create a smooth solid surface, then started putting clay on it to make our finished sculpture,\" Winston boasts, \"and that became our sculpting armature. It ended up looking exactly like a very large version of those wooden dinosaur skeleton toys you can buy! The form of the dinosaur was done virtually by mechanical drawing, so our full-scale creations were identical to our 1/5th-scale maquettes. All we had to do then was to sculpt the skin and the detail. Later I learned this was exactly the way the Statue of Liberty was built!\"\n\nEach of the full-scale dinosaurs, which included the Tyrannosaurus rex, the spitters, the velociraptors, a triceratops and an insert brachiosaurus head and neck, took teams of sculptors months to craft to Winston and Spielberg's satisfaction. The sculptures were then molded, and from these molds flexible skins were cast which were then fitted over graphite and metal skeletons laden with all manner of mechanical devices: air bladders to simulate breathing, cable-actuated systems to perform certain body movements, radio-controlled servo motors to control facial motion. The creatures were all designed to operate in real time.\n\nMeanwhile, mechanical effects supervisor Michael Lantieri was hard at work creating what the four man design team laughingly called “dinosaur interfaces,” mechanical systems that would help these full-scale behemoths to stand, walk and perform in scenes. \"We always joked that Stan got the glamorous end of it,\" Lantieri says, \"but the behind the-camera work turned out to be really important and Stan was great about including us. We really worked together. If he'd made a creature that was only there from the waist up, we built out of our special 'dinosaur interface' things that could be attached to the creature to move it. Stan and I talked about where we could attach our interfaces, how we would move them and the speed [we would use]. We built a lot of different rigs that would accommodate Stan's puppeteers, underground cranes and dollies, as well as pneumatic cranes that would assist with the broad movements. In addition, my guys would be involved in the shoving and pushing needed to give the full range of motion.\"\n\nOf all the life-size dinosaurs, the velociraptors embody the most controversial blending of techniques: at the core of several of the various effects models are human beings. Given the dubious legacy of el cheapo productions such as Unknown Island, The Land Unknown, and Japan's legendary contribution to the genre, the Godzilla series, the idea of man-in-a-suit dinosaurs has been reviled by cineastes from time immemorial. Today, the man-in-a-suit approach has become state-of-the-art, and Winston is almost single-handedly responsible for the public's dramatic change in attitude. \"If there was a man inside a dinosaur, there was a great deal of technology inside that dinosaur, too,\" Winston observes.\n\n\"For Jurassic Park, we designed and built full-sized, performing, live-action dinosaurs. The methods we used involved whatever technology was required to create the performance needed. We built two man-in-suit raptors and two fully animatronic, no-human-being puppet raptors utilizing a combination of cable and servo control. We also made a set of walking legs and a set of running legs from the waist down. For certain shots, we created insert hands which could, for example, open doors. Then we fabricated our stunt raptors, full-sized floppy puppets and poseable puppets. All told, we built 8 to 10 full-sized raptors that did different things. We also built a baby raptor splitting out of its shell [seen featured image at top of page], which was totally real-time using cable control.\"\n\nWinston's goal was to create fluid, believable dinosaurs that bore no trace of the mechanics which gave them life. Specifically, he wanted to conquer the phenomenon he refers to as \"waga-waga,\" which he scientifically defines as the jolt that occurs when a large moving mass comes to a stop. Such jolts, which mimes employ to simulate robotic movement, work fine for machines like in The Terminator, but they would have seriously undermined Winston's attempt to bring his dinosaurs to convincing life. Through the careful application of some unusual, though strangely related technologies, the raptors and some of Winston's other dinosaur creations, most dramatically the full-scale Tyrannosaurus rex, employed a breakthrough \"anti-waga\" system. They were dubbed \"Steadi-Dinos\" because their movements were based on neutral buoyancy, the same principal which is integral to the Steadicam. This concept was envisioned by Craig Caton, one of Winston's key mechanical designers.\n\n\"I saw the relationship between a person having a hard time trying to hold a camera at the end of his arm and the need to hold up a head mechanically on a long neck,\" Winston beams, \"and I realized that the same wonderful system of counterspringing the camera so the weight load becomes neutral could help us mechanically. We realized that this could work very well for us in terms of certain head and neck movements, to make everything fluid. The actual infrastructures of our dinosaurs were countersprung just like a Steadicam, which made our creatures' movements totally fluid and organic. That technology went into the spitters and the velociraptors, two of our most active dinosaurs.\"\n\nBut this system achieved its most remarkable results in Jurassic Park's star attraction, a 40'-long, 9,000-pound animatronic machine that perfectly recreated the appearance and fluid motion of a full-sized Tyrannosaurus rex. \"The technology of the T-rex is beyond anything I think anybody has ever seen,\" Winston says. \"One of our big problems was figuring out how to make this 40'-long creature move quickly and violently, perform wonderfully, yet come to a smooth stop on cue without the waga-waga you would expect. We solved the problem through a series of computer-involved aspects of ramping up and ramping down speed, and by building accelerometers into our anti-waga devices. A series of accelerometers enabled us to measure the speed of the hydraulic rams moving within our dinosaur, which allowed us to counter that movement with other rams moving in the opposite direction elsewhere in the body. So our T-rex never completed a particular move and stopped without another aspect of the body compensating immediately. In order to keep this creature moving with speed and dynamics, nothing was allowed to come to a hard stop against its rigid 9,000 pounds without something else counterbalancing that motion. When its head comes to a sudden stop, something moves in the neck to compensate for it at that exact split second, which acts as a shock absorber. It's wonderful how this guy performs — he’s fast and big and dangerous and he's a great actor.\"\n\nWinston was concerned that the T-rex, weighing in at 9,000 pounds, was potentially as lethal off camera as on, and he began to worry about how to control this gigantic performer so it would interact on cue with its environment and not present a safety hazard. \"Unlike any other hydraulic creature you've seen in an amusement park, say King Kong [at Universal Studios], whose specific moves have been programmed in over a long period of time and who repeats those movements over and over, our Tyrannosaurus rex was this big hydraulic machine that had to perform on cue,\" Winston states. \"When you're an actor in a film, you have to be able to take direction immediately, so I was concerned about how to coordinate the computer keyboards with 8 or 10 people on them to make these big moves. The biggest problem we had beyond all this technology was safety. There's a real big danger factor working on a set with a 9,000-pound machine. This dinosaur could've killed someone really easiiy.\"\n\nAs with many of Winston's best ideas, the ideal solution to this hazard presented itself in the middle of the night. Winston had worked with performance Waldos many times before, but these telemetry suits, which translate the motion of the person wearing them into the performance of the mechanical creature itself, were designed for more humanoid characters. No one had ever devised a telemetry system for creatures that didn't mimic human motion. \"Thinking back to our 1/5th-scale mechanical T-rex prototype, I had the brainstorm that we could actually use one similar to it as our telemetry puppet!\" Winston says. \"I realized that we could literally build a performance Waldo for the T-rex that duplicated every motion he made in 1/5th scale, and use that as an interface for us to organically puppet the creature. Instead of having linear potentiometers linked to a control board, each potentiometer would correspond to a cylinder in our puppet version of the T-rex, so we had a 9,000-pound puppet that was literally operated by puppeteers manipulating a small version. That way, Steven could say, 'Let him rear up' and we could pull our 1/5th-scale Waldo back and let him act; our full-scale T-rex performed on the spot. If a situation required a really critical move, we could puppet it on the fly, and then, using the computer system that controlled our T-rex, we could record that move and repeat it over and over again at the push of a button.\"\n\nThe animatronic Tyrannosaurus rex was built in two parts. The upper body from head to tail down to the knee made up one section, while the legs comprised the other. The two sections could appear to be one creature by strategically placing a tree branch across the joint, there was also a set of dummy legs that could be positioned under the mechanical upper body. The effects team also constructed a foresection of the T-rex consisting of the front half of his body, which at 4,000 pounds was easier to move around than the full 9,000-pound version.\n\nThe gross movements of the nose to tail T-rex's massive upper body were controlled via a motion platform Winston calls the \"Dino-Simulator\" because of its similarities to a flight simulator, a hydraulically actuated, computer-operated platform capable of handling all six axes of movement smoothly, even while bearing an enormous weight load. Winston stresses that the full scale T-rex's articulation was tied directly into the flight-simulator concept. \"We took that same technology and, like branches on a tree, moved it right out to the tip of its nose,\" he says. \"The basis for the hydraulics and the mechanics and the fluidity of the T-rex's movement was the methodology behind flight simulators. The Dino-Simulator could fluidly move the creature forward, back, from side to side, and up and down. We took that system and continued to work up into the beast with hydraulic cylinders, transducers, and the addition of accelerometers, so what worked the Dino-Simulator also moved the entire dinosaur. Our problem was that it wasn't enough for the T-rex to move fluidly; it had to perform, so we had to take another step because now we had a long load-bearing situation that was setting itself up for an amazing waga! The solution involved computer cards to rapidly ramp-up and ramp-down speed, combined with counter-moves to stop the waga.\"\n\nAssisting with the construction of the Dino-Simulator was only the tip of the T-rex for veteran floor effects specialist Lantieri, who gives off the impression of a youthful elf with enormous enthusiasm for the problem-solving that comprises most of his work. It's hard to believe he got his start some 20 years ago handling effects for The Six-Million Dollar Man series at Universal Studios, where he now works his magic from his permanent, Spielberg-funded workspace on the lot. Along the way, Lantieri has won two Academy Award nominations and three British Academy Awards for his ability to contribute invisible expertise to such landmark productions as Who Framed Roger Rabbit and the Back To The Future films.\n\nEven with all of this experience, however, Lantieri had never faced problems like those confronting him on Jurassic Park: \"Once you bring a dinosaur in for a shot, then what do you do with it? Not only did we have to move our creatures within the shot, we had to move them into position for the next setup. We had to be able to turn them around and move them out of the way. This meant we had to build very dinosaur-friendly sets to accommodate our winches and cranes and air bearings, most of which helped move the creatures into position and also, for certain shots, handled some of their broad movements in conjunction with Stan's puppeteers.\n\n\"We literally built a walker with training wheels to move the full set of T-rex legs. We also mounted the Dino-Simulator onto a tower that I built which was on air bearings, so we could use high-pressure air to glide a great deal of weight. Air bearings are used for moving heavy equipment out in the real world, but we use it for simulating earthquakes and other effects where we move big, heavy objects.\"\n\nSuch as 9,000-pound dinosaurs. This concept brings us back to the aforementioned shot in which the tyrannosaurus rex wreaks havoc on a jeep. \"The T-rex was supposed to give chase, run through a grove of trees, break through a gigantic log that's fallen across the road, then slam into the jeep,\" Lantieri smiles, pausing to catching his breath. \"Naturally, Steven wanted it in one shot. Upon the action cue, we were controlling half a dozen large real trees that had to be mowed down in sequence before we even see the T-rex. Each tree had to be scored, precut and hinged using internal cables, as well as cables on a pulley at a 45-degree angle. We set off sequential charges in the trees and had them spring loaded so they'd seem to plow from the back forward.\n\n\"Then we had this tree that had fallen across the road, which had to rip the windshield and shear the seat backs off our jeep as it crashes under it, but then break as our T-rex plows through it!\" Lantieri says, shaking his head. \"The fallen tree was built as a hollow log. It was made out of steel, then skinned with fiberglass and real bark and real limbs and real leaves. We then put a big air-driven piston through the center of it, so that when it was closed, just like a big barrel bolt, the log was sturdy and sound. The jeep actually drove into it at 30 m.p.h. and sheared the windshield off as everyone ducked at the last second, which was a real stunt that Gary Hymes supervised.\n\n\"A beat behind that, in the same shot, the T-Rex plunges through this log chest-first, which meant that we had to weaken the log and cause it to break itself open so we didn't hurt our creature! The second the jeep went through, I used high-pressure air to pull the piston and create a weak joint in the middle of the tree. The tree was then pulled back from the outside edges using hydraulics, like a swinging barn door, so that at the moment of impact with the T-rex we didn't hurt our star dinosaur.\n\n\"Lastly,\" Lantieri says with visible relief, \"we kept the shot going as the T-rex hits the side of the jeep, denting it and causing it to raise off the ground. Since our 9,000-pound animatronic puppet didn't have the strength to do what a real T-rex weighing 20 tons might do, we had to build a jeep that would dent itself on cue and appear to raise off the ground from the impact! We had the entire side of the jeep rigged with pneumatic rams and covered with lead sheets painted to look like the genuine steel skin. The ram, which was extended and welded to the lead skin, was then closed at high pressure at the moment of impact with the T-rex, and it sucked a great big dent in on the side of the jeep. We also had a pneumatic foot hidden behind the rear tire that slammed down into the ground and lifted the jeep off the ground, all of which had to be timed to the movement of the creature. This whole sequence was done in one shot, so you can imagine the amount of timing and cueing required in order for my crew and the stunt people to all hit their marks at the right moment. That was a huge mechanical effect.\" For added protection, the shot was also done as a motion-control move minus the T-rex, which could then be added later by ILM.\n\nThe film's most elaborate mechanical effects set piece again involved the Tyrannosaurus rex, who ravages a two-car caravan on a tour of Jurassic Park. The tour vehicles were supposed to be driverless Ford Explorers on a magnetic track. In reality, they were either radio-controlled or blind-driven vehicles which a driver controlled from underneath the hood. Lantieri had gained a lot of experience with these systems on Roger Rabbit, but he had never created a car that would literally crush itself. \"The crushable car was a real Ford Explorer,\" Lantieri explains. \"We replaced the door panels we wanted to crush with lightweight aluminum and lead, and we created replaceable, crushable roofs as well. We built a telescoping roll cage inside the headliners of the car, which was what actually pulled the roof down. We also had metal buckling on the side and glass breaking. It was all hydraulically driven, like a big crush press that we could control with joysticks. We stood right by the camera and Steven would say, 'Crush it a little more... a little more.' We were trying to give the feeling that this creature's foot was actually on top of the car, crushing it, which meant it couldn't seem like a mechanically clean crush. The car had to rock and crush at the same time, which required some puppeteering. When we shot our pickup scene inside the car with the two kids, we had to be sure that the roll cage was engineered to come to a stop at the right height so it wouldn't harm them, because Steven wanted it to look as if they were almost crushed.\"\n\nOnce the T-rex finishes demolishing the Ford Explorer, he bulldozes it over a cliff, where it lands in the branches of a huge tree. The kids then clamber out of the crushed vehicle as the branches give way, and the car chases them down the tree. The mix of kids and a 3,000-pound falling Ford had all the elements of a full-scale real-life disaster, but both Lantieri and Spielberg were fanatical about safety precautions. \"The tree was built on Stage 27, which is a pit,\" Lantieri recalls. \"Our tree was 60' high, and so detailed that its trunk was even covered with rolled bark that would scrape off as the car slid down it. The tree had to hold the weight of the real Explorer we were going to fly down after it got shoved over a cliff, so you can imagine all the safety precautions we had to go through. We used one of our regular cars with the motor removed, so it was just the frame and body, and we removed or replaced every piece that could break off. The only pieces that broke were ones that we controlled so we knew where they were going to fall. The car was always on a cable, but it still had to fall like it wasn't. It couldn't jerk when it fell. We actually put it into freefall using custom-built hydraulic wedges with electronic braking. That way, we could bring the car from a freefall to a controlled stop in one foot and it wouldn't snap on the cables because of the braking. It was all controlled digitally using a system we built combined with a descender rig that was capable of holding three or four tons. That way, we were able to drop a full-sized car on a limb above people's heads and do close calls. It was a tremendous responsibility, as well as a challenge, to make this look real.\"\n\nTo complicate matters further, the entire effect had to be completely timed out to Spielberg's nod. \"We had hydraulically controlled branches that would break on cue,\" Lantieri reveals, \"so I could build that cinematic tension that Steven loves to create — he's famous for it. After the car hit, the branch slowly started creaking and bent until he nodded, and then we let the branch break and the car fall. Steven knew exactly the length of suspense that he wanted to build. He'd say, 'Let it slip a little... let it slip... now!' and the car had to go right on the money. And it had to be repeatable. After the tree branch broke, we reset and reskinned it. We were all set to go while he waited, or we wouldn't be there the next day. That's part of the joy and challenge of working with someone like Steven.\"\n\nLantieri and company also created the usual atmospheric effects — rain, mist and fog — on set and on location, and also took care of details such as dinosaur tracks and park fences. \"Fencing!\" Lantieri shrieks. \"Let me tell you about a simple job, the kind of thing that would just slide by on this movie. When I read the script, the last thing on my mind was fencing! I was thinking, 'My God, the special effects on this movie! Do I really want this job?' But once we got the drawings and they said, 'Okay, just go put some fence up for us,' well, that took months.\"\n\nAnd yet, Lantieri concludes, \"I'm wondering where I go from here. I hope that having the opportunity to work on this film, with Steven as our fearless leader, wasn't a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.\"\n\nWinston concurs, adding: \"To me, the most exciting thing about Jurassic Park is that these dinosaurs are beautiful, they're real, and everything about their movements and their looks is organic. Some of the finest artists in the world worked for the longest time designing them, creating their look, their texture, and their movement, and the piece de resistance is the fact that they do perform and that they can act. And when they can't do something, that's where ILM and Dennis Muren come in. It'll be a beautiful, seamless mix of technologies so that what you see are living dinosaurs that are almost too real to be real.\"\n\nAlso from the June 1993 issue of AC is Jurassic Park: When Dinosaurs Rule the Box Office, in which cinematographer Dean Cundey, ASC details his approach to the project.",

    "fullText": "In 2016, Olympus Camera made some buzz in the photo world when they claimed that their new camera was capable of an impressive 6.5 stops of stabilization and that the limiting factor was in fact the rotation of the Earth.  This was rather surprising given the slow and steady improvement since the first such stabilization systems were introduced in lenses in the 1990s.  These only provided a couple stops of benefit.  Since then the technology has improved dramatically and the move from film to silicon has allowed it to be incorporated into the camera itself as IBIS.\n\nA major driver of this increase in stabilization performance has been in the gyroscopic sensors used to measure the vibration and control electronics used to correct it.  For these types of applications, the accuracy of the zero offset of the gyro sensor is often the limiting factor.  Even when perfectly still, noise will cause the sensor to read a small but non-zero value, which will in turn cause the stabilization system to drift.  The smaller the drift, the longer the stabilization system can hold an image steady.  If there were no noise on the gyro sensor and the stabilization system worked perfectly, it should in theory be able to provide an infinite number of stops of benefit.  However, at somewhere around 6 stops of shutter speed increase, the limiting factor stops becoming the electronics, and instead becomes the rotational motion of the Earth!\n\nTo illustrate , lets imagine that you are somewhere on the Earth’s surface, pointing the camera due East or West.  For simplicity, lets assume you are on the equator, but your latitude doesn’t actually matter for this analysis.  There are 86,400 seconds in a day, so Earth rotates at a rate of 2π/86400 radians/second, or 7.27*10^-5 rad/s.  That means that your subject, which is presumably stationary on Earth’s surface as well, is rotating at this rate.  Your camera, which is using its IBIS system to attempt to keep everything as still as possible, may not realize that you are rotating with your subject and will instead try to zero out any rotation of the camera, including that of the Earth.  More technically, the camera is trying to maintain stability with respect to an inertial reference frame, which by virtue of the Earth’s rotation, you and your subject are not.\n\nThe camera will of course move with the Earth and your subject, but will rotate relative to the subject.  If the camera is pointed east as shown in the figure above, it will rotate up relative to the subject.\n\nLets say that you have an exposure time given by the variable T.  IBIS will therefore cause the image to move by a distance on the sensor given by:\n\nUsing our typical standard for the maximum allowable blur to be 1 pixel width, we get the maximum allowable shutter time to be\n\nA 24 megapixel full frame camera will have pixels that are 0.0059mm wide.  Plugging this into the above equation, we get\n\nIf we take 1/Focal Length as the standard advice for the maximum shutter speed you can use to achieve sharp images, this equation says we can use shutter speeds 81 times as long with stabilization before Earth’s rotation blurs the image by one pixel.  In more familiar terms:\n\nNeat.  Of course not all cameras have the same 0.0059mm pixel pitch, but the rule for the maximum hand-held shutter speed will vary accordingly, so this 6.3 stops will be consistent across most cameras.  We can turn this around and say that in order to provide 6.3 stops of stabilization, the system must be able to measure and compensate for rotations of the camera as slow as the Earth’s, or 360 degrees per day.  That’s pretty impressive.\n\nPresumably, a calculation like the one above or very similar was the inspiration for the claim by Olympus Camera:\n\n“6.5 stops is actually a theoretical limitation at the moment due to rotation of the earth interfering with gyro sensors”\n\nSince then the plot has thickened.  Olympus has released the OM-D E-M1X which claims to have 7.5 stops of stabilization, and Panasonic claims their new 70-200 f/2.8 has 7 stops of stabilization.  How could this be?  Without access to the data used to perform the CIPA stabilization rating test for these pieces of equipment, it’s difficult to say for sure.  In theory though, there are some possible ways to work around the limitations placed be Earth’s rotation:\n\nThe first isn’t a good solution for many reasons.  Don’t have GPS signal?  Shooting next to a magnet?  Your system won’t work.  The second solution is much more plausible, but still very difficult.  The user would have to be pointing the camera at the subject for long enough such that the drift in their aim at the subject is smaller than the drift from the rotation of the earth.  This is also implausible.  What is concerning though, is that this second method is one that could work very well to cancel out Earth’s rotation on the CIPA specified stabilization test apparatus.\n\nFor the CIPA stabilization test, the camera is mounted to a vibration platform.  The camera is then moved by the platform in a way that is determined by a CIPA provided waveform designed to mimic the motions from hand-holding a camera.  The setup is shown below:\n\nIn this test setup, the camera is mounted to a very stable platform and held there for a long time before and after the test images are being taken.  In theory, this could make it much easier to for the camera to identify and filter out any effects from Earth’s rotation.  If the waveform has no very low frequency components, it would be easy to identify any low frequency motion as Earth’s rotation.  Without knowing exactly what waveform is given to camera manufacturers to perform this test though, it’s impossible to draw any meaningful conclusions.  It would be great if we could get some independent verification of the stated stabilization values, but CIPA seems to make that deliberately difficult.  As quoted on their application guide:\n\nThis seems unnecessarily restrictive to me and makes independent verification and analysis of the test impossible.\n\nThis has been a long way of saying that I don’t know if Olympus and Panasonic have found a way to compensate for the Earth’s rotation in their stabilization systems, breaking through the 6.3 stop limit, or if they are achieving 7+ stops through oddities of the CIPA rating test.  If anyone has one of these cameras with 7+ stops of stabilization and some time on their hands, it would be really cool to show the camera breaking through the Earth rotation barrier.  If the cameras can’t, and you could show that Earth’s rotation is actually the limiting factor on the stabilization system, well that would be pretty cool too.",

    "description": "Jack Edwards shapes the online world’s reading habits from BookTok. But can he handle his success?",
    "fullText": "“Samuel Johnson, William Hazlitt, Harold Bloom and James Wood. And now you?”\n\n“Oh, I mean, that’s pretty crazy to hear, but I don’t know.”\n\nDr Johnson never filmed a “spicy books with cartoon covers” vlog. But Jack Edwards cannot quite deny being the most important literary critic in the world. In commercial terms, he certainly is. A nod from him fills bathtubs, train carriages and public parks with copies of a book he likes. Booksellers buy and arrange their stock to his taste. And he is not confined to new releases. When he dug up an obscure Dostoevsky (White Nights), his positive review moved it from cellars to shop windows instantaneously. I first met him for this interview around the time of the 2024 International Booker Prize. He had been asked to host the ceremony – and to livestream it. I watched him cruise up the red carpet, encircled by cameras and attendants.\n\nEdwards is a literary tastemaker, but not in the familiar mode. You will not find any submissions of his languishing in the LRB slush pile. Instead he posts on BookTok and BookTube, the social media planes concerned with reading, where millions of viewers watch videos about books. At first, BookTok was confined to the lonely bedrooms of coronavirus lockdowns. Now it has stalls at the Hay Festival and the National Literacy Trust. Waterstones has “BookTok made me buy it” tables.\n\nEdwards is the foremost star of these platforms. Per his bio, he is the “internet’s resident librarian”. He is 27 years old and, on YouTube, has 1.5 million subscribers and 158 million views – which is roughly 16 and 1,755 Wembley Stadiums respectively. He is conventionally handsome, and excitable and sensitive in manner. He started YouTube while at secondary school in Brighton. His first videos were “day in the life” vlogs, study tips and A-level results reactions.\n\nThe boom came when he progressed to Durham University to study literature. His atmospheric recordings of undergraduate life proved so popular that the dean of his college now calls its oversubscription “the Jack Edwards effect”.\n\nHis next major growth spurt came when his university career ended. When Oxford University rejected his master’s application in 2020, Edwards posted a video of himself crying, entitled “oxford university rejected my masters application… (sorry this video is sad)”. Social media rewards confession. Authenticity, sincerity and vulnerability were important – more important than orthodox intellectual baubles. He described social media to me as “democratic… When you log on, you don’t need a qualification, you don’t need to be an established journalist.”\n\nGraduating into the pandemic was “confusing and strange”, he says. Edwards did not feel he could be a “StudyTuber” if he was no longer a student. He spent a month alone. During it, he read 30 books and decided he wanted a career in them. But he could not secure a job in a hotel, let alone one in publishing.\n\nUnlike other hopefuls, however, Edwards had a platform. He could not get jobs with publishers, but HarperCollins was willing to publish his guide to university life, The Uni-Verse. Having tried the conventional routes into employment, Edwards launched himself as a full-time book influencer. He posted reading-related videos from London, Paris, New York, Korea and elsewhere. The period was “really special” to Edwards. He read favourite authors in their native locations. He started Mieko Kawakami’s All the Lovers in the Night on the bullet train to Tokyo and finished the last page as the train arrived. “From the first page I was just absolutely entranced… I felt this real sense of catharsis, that I’d been through this entire journey, physically throughout Japan, but also with that author.” Occasionally, in a bodega, a coffee shop, a bookstore or a library, people would “tap me on the shoulder and say that they read their favourite book because they found it from my channel. And there’s no better feeling in the world than that – nothing.”\n\nLike many graduates his age, Edwards settled down in London. He posts reviews, commentary and hauls. His style as a literary creator has become defined, and honours the lessons of his social media success. Books get positive reviews if they stir his emotions – especially if they make him weep. With social media, he told me, “we can visually see people reacting to a book and having a kind of subjective emotional response that feels even more personal than maybe a book critic or journalist can. [In traditional reviews] we don’t get to see them crying in response to a book that broke their heart. I think that’s part of the magic of BookTok.”\n\nEdwards champions BookTok and also defends it. Critics argue that the platform is more about being seen reading than actually reading, and that it promotes low-quality fiction. Edwards rejects that characterisation energetically: “The only feature common to all ‘BookTok books’ – which can mean both enemies-to-lovers roommate novels and Greek mythological retellings – is popularity with a young audience.” He reminds me of “White Nights”, the Dostoevsky story that his review placed “alongside Colleen Hoover and Sarah J Maas on a ‘BookTok made me buy it’ shelf… I’ll recommend contemporary novels alongside classics because I think often we’re looking for those moments that resonate with us and that feel perennial, that feel evergreen.”\n\nHis favourite classics are by Toni Morrison and James Baldwin. They are “people who I think really understood the human condition, what it was to feel, to love, and to interact with the people around us.” More recently, “I’m a big Sally Rooney fan. She talks about when you’re on your deathbed you’ll think about the people that you loved and that you interacted with… it’s not frivolous to make art about the people that you loved and that you interacted with.”\n\nHe keeps his core content mostly apolitical. There is a progressive, inclusionary tone to his videos – “a book from every country in Asia” or “banned books and rainbow capitalism” – but he is seldom explicitly partisan online. He is more outspoken, however, on his X account, where he reposts Jeremy Corbyn and Zarah Sultana and makes no secret of his dislike for Keir Starmer’s Labour government.\n\nMostly, his commitment is to books. He told me: “I think one of the truest things for the world right now is that the worst of times can facilitate really incredible art, and we need that sort of self-expression.” Where we have come from, where we are going, and so on are crucial considerations when giving praise: “They always do represent where we’re at as a society and a culture.” Edwards quoted Bertolt Brecht, asking if there will also be singing in the dark times – and answering yes: there will be singing about the dark times.\n\nWhen we first spoke I was struck by how open and positive Edwards was. It may come easily to the enormously successful, but Edwards maintained a generous, pleasant perspective the whole time we spoke. Abusive comments: “Sometimes people’s responses can be quite personal. I suppose that’s probably the drawback. But the pros outweigh the cons by a long way!” A spanner about the Booker’s politics: “You’re making me work for it, I’m on my toes!” Suffering a fanbase pile-on, as he did after criticising the author of The Kissing Booth: “Yeah! People feel very strongly about books. That’s part of the fun!” On the relevance of establishment awards: “For me they’re a good guiding light to discover new things.” On pressure: “I obviously feel pressure being online… to always keep it kind.”\n\nIt seems he has always been that way. A student at university contemporaneously with Edwards told me how sardonic whispers would circulate whenever it became known that “the YouTuber” was in a bar. People would ask for selfies, not without a trace of nastiness. At that time, Edwards was far from successful enough to overwhelm such sneers. But he was always a good sport. I was shown a picture in which he had been willing to hold up a baby doll that he had been handed without explanation.\n\nBut soon after our first interview, Edwards’s output waned. His videos became sparser and more subdued, and they stayed that way for the rest of 2024. Then, at the start of 2025, Edwards posted a confessional video titled “every book I want to read in 2025 (and why i stopped posting book reviews)”. He described last year as “something to survive” and admitted that it had “got to the point where I had to really seriously consider whether I wanted to continue doing this.”\n\nEdwards is subject to copious online abuse. On camera, he mentioned withholding his opinions on pop culture because people called them cringe. But the harassment is much harsher than that, and touches on topics Edwards does not mention. The top posts on his own Reddit page accuse him – without citing evidence – of not reading the books he talks about, plagiarising reviews and “scamming” his followers with unsubstantial paid-content tiers. The thread about him on the gossip forum Tattle Life has been remade after reaching the site’s comment limit four times. The comments often speculate, cruelly, about his sexuality.\n\nOn top of calculated abuse, Edwards also suffered from the ambient pressures of fame. For instance, the book review site Goodreads labels Edwards’s account “#1 most read”: if he leaves a review on a book, it will be the first one users see, meaning a negative review can severely affect a book’s chances of success.\n\nAll this got to Edwards. Friends asked if he realised he was apologising and issuing disclaimers before speaking when he socialised with them. He lived with his “guard up all the time, flinching constantly, feeling just genuinely afraid to share anything”. He stopped posting opinions and even changed his accent because of criticism. In the video in which he discussed his withdrawal, he acknowledged commenters who said they missed “the old Jack”. He said, “I miss him too, I really do.”\n\nBecoming an influencer is now by many accounts the most popular career ambition for the young. But many who succeed take long breaks for their mental health, or withdraw entirely. Edwards reckons that online fame is “not something the human brain is wired for”. He described it as “traumatic” to see “so many people discussing something about you.” It feels “so invasive and intimate”.\n\nEdwards was born in Brighton in 1998 with terrible eyesight. A prescription of 8.75 keeps you off the football pitch. “You don’t really see the ball until it’s, like, inches from your face, and by that point it’s too late to pick which part of the head it’s gonna hit,” Edwards told me when we spoke again in August last year. His bookishness proceeded from his near blindness; his parents taught him the letters very young so they could get him a proper eye test. He started a blog to review the new Hunger Games film when he was 14.\n\nIf reading was a solitary pastime for Edwards the child, it is a solitary job for Edwards the man. He lives in a flat in Soho – not a cheap part of London – with another content creator for a flatmate. He never joined anything like a graduate scheme with colleagues his age. He rents a co-working space because, he says, “I like to feel like there is life going on around me.” He sometimes wishes someone would give him feedback on his work before he publishes it, because when the first judges are the commenters, “at that point there’s no room to manoeuvre… you kind of get tested in the public court before you, you know?”\n\nEdwards’s Zoom background featured the same bookshelves visible in his dejected January 2025 video. But he seemed to have developed a new toughness since then. He looked older, with a more muscular neck and longer, slightly receding hair, and he seemed almost bloody-minded about pushing on. In his own words, “Maybe my prefrontal cortex just developed, but I no longer care to have to argue my point or prove my moral worth every time I don’t enjoy something.” He dismissed unfair criticism flatly, calling it “nitpicking culture” and “moral panic” that is “not how the world works”. Where his old videos overshared in “toxic honesty”, he now has definite lines about not discussing his friends or relationships. That “really cutting remarks” are the comments that “stay with you”, he acknowledged as an unfortunate but permanent fact. He had a detached view of social media. As well as disdaining the angsts it causes, he distrusts the comforts it offers. “You have this illusion of community,” it was surprising to hear him say, “when we’re really very alone.”\n\nHis latest project is an attempt to forge real community, though it is still essentially a social media product. He wants his new book club, Inklings, to be “this book club community where I can have something that’s a bit more solid, tangible”. When I asked about his hopes for the next five years, he said he was focusing on the work. At that time, Inklings had no episodes but was already the fastest-growing club in the platform Fable’s history. Since then, its episodes have featured Oisín McKenna (Evenings and Weekends), David Nicholls (One Day), Coco Mellors (Cleopatra and Frankenstein), Luke Thompson (Bridgerton) and the actor Cillian Murphy.\n\nIn September, he recorded an episode with Palestine-born novelist Yasmin Zaher at the Saatchi Gallery. A large, orderly crowd filled pews in a white gallery lit by pink accent lights. I had been the only man of the first 20 people to queue. It was possible to track the location of a daddy long legs that was floating through the room by the screaming and lurching it provoked. Edwards came down the aisle in a t-shirt and corduroy trousers, laughing nervously and smiling at his fans, who cheered. On stage, he said it was “so special for me to get to be here with you all… to take this thing we do in isolation… moments we spend in our own heads… and turn it into community”.\n\nEdwards said he escaped feeling overexposed by “finding something – for me, it’s been books and reading – to refract everything through”. He asked whether Zaher’s characters obsessed over “being clean, perhaps because there’s little else they can control”, and whether, in the case of another, the “dirty parts of her she couldn’t clean then became a target”. He said we knew “almost too much” about the protagonist when we heard her “sexual perversions and hot takes”, and mentioned another who “withholds, and she keeps for herself almost as a way of maintaining ownership of, and having control of, her identity, and saying, actually, I can’t be defined by external sources; I define myself”.\n\nZaher’s novel, The Coin, was her debut. Edwards asked if being unknown allowed her a “lack of inhibitions”. She agreed that you are freer when “you don’t know who your audience may be”. Edwards knows who his audience is, and they know him. He told me of fans commenting on his interviews that they could answer every question for him.\n\nBut if the relationship is not free; it is tender. Rose, 25, unemployed after failing to find a job in publishing, had been watching him “constantly for five years”. She said, “I literally rediscovered the love of literature through him – so big, big fan.” Allesia, 21, unemployed after recently graduating, had gotten into Edwards after immigrating from Ukraine six years ago, at which point she could not read in English. “I like how accessible he is to people who don’t read or have just started reading.” Ryan, 28, had watched Edwards for a decade. He now directs AI engineering at a tech company but had previously worked for influencers in LA. He had seen that “it’s all consuming when your entire life is to be someone; that can be brutal”.\n\nAlmost everyone was there by themselves. Some came with a parent or a friend, but I didn’t see a crowd of three. Rose said Edwards’s content was “the kind you stumble onto when you’re, like, in your room alone”. Ryan said that in his decade of viewing he had come to “enjoy my self more”. Almost immediately after taking the microphone, Edwards had said, “Bear with me while I try not to cry.” It was easy to imagine his audience feeling he had done the same for them. Edwards helped people, Rose reckoned: “He brings a lot of, like, humanity and empathy… I think the world would be a better place if everyone read fiction. It’s literally learning how to put yourself in other people’s shoes.”\n\nEdwards is working on his first novel. He would only tell me that it is historical and set in the UK. He will certainly find a publisher. He claims his whole life has been “that pursuit of letters on a page”. Whether that pursuit will lead to literary greatness of course remains to be seen. He may not become Dr Johnson – but Jack Edwards seems, at last, to be becoming himself.\n\n[Further reading: Cats are better than dogs – and much better than David Baddiel]",

    "fullText": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — The bloodiest crackdown on dissent since Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution is slowly coming into focus, despite authorities cutting off the Islamic Republic from the internet and much of the wider world.\n\nCities and towns smell of smoke as fire-damaged mosques and government offices line streets. Banks have been torched, their ATMs smashed. Officials estimate the damage to be at least $125 million, according to an Associated Press tally of reports by the state-run IRNA news agency from over 20 cities.\n\nThe number of dead demonstrators reported by activists continues to swell. Activists warn it shows Iran engaging in the same tactics it has used for decades, but at an unprecedented scale — firing from rooftops on demonstrators, shooting birdshot into crowds and sending motorcycle-riding paramilitary Revolutionary Guard volunteers in to beat and detain those who can’t escape.\n\n“The vast majority of protesters were peaceful. The video footage shows crowds of people — including children and families — chanting, dancing around bonfires, marching on their streets,” said Raha Bahreini, of Amnesty International. \"The authorities have opened fire unlawfully.”\n\nThe killing of peaceful protesters — as well as the threat of mass executions — have been a red line for military action for U.S. President Donald Trump. An American aircraft carrier and warships are approaching the Mideast, possibly allowing Trump to launch another attack on Iran after bombing its nuclear enrichment sites last year. That risks igniting a new Mideast war.\n\nIran's mission to the United Nations did not respond to detailed questions from the AP regarding the suppression of the demonstrations.\n\nThe demonstrations began Dec. 28 at Tehran’s historic Grand Bazaar, initially over the collapse of Iran's currency, the rial, then spread across the country.\n\nTensions exploded on Jan. 8, with demonstrations called for by Iran's exiled crown prince, Reza Pahlavi. Witnesses in Tehran told the AP before authorities cut internet and phone communication that they saw tens of thousands of demonstrators on the streets.\n\nAs communications failed, gunfire echoed through Tehran.\n\n“Many witnesses said they had never seen such a large number of protesters on the streets,” said Bahar Saba of Human Rights Watch. “Iranian authorities have repeatedly shown they have no answers other than bullets and brutal repression to people taking to the streets.”\n\nAli Akbar Pourjamshidian, a deputy interior minister speaking on state TV Wednesday, acknowledged the violence began in earnest on Jan. 8.\n\n“More than 400 cities were involved,\" he said.\n\n“Tonight you all must be vigilant. Tonight is the night for keeping mosques, all bases everywhere filled with ‘Hezbollahi,’” Yekta said, using a word for “followers of God” that carries the connotation of fervent supporters of Iran's theocracy.\n\nAlready weakened by the 12-day war Israel launched against Iran in June, the authorities decided to fully employ violence to end the demonstrations, experts said.\n\n“I think the regime viewed it as this was a moment of existential threat and that they could either allow it to play out and allow the protests to build and allow foreign powers to increase their rhetoric and increase their demands on Iran,” said Afshon Ostovar, an expert on the Revolutionary Guard and professor at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterrey, California.\n\n\"Or they could turn out the lights, kill as many people as necessary ... and hope they could get away with it. And I think that’s what they ultimately did.”\n\nBasij key in disrupting protests\n\nIn Iran, one of the main ways its theocracy can squash demonstrations is through the Basij, the Guard's volunteer arm.\n\nMosques in Iran include facilities for the Basij. Guard Gen. Heydar Baba Ahmadi was quoted by the semiofficial Mehr news agency in 2024 as estimating “79% of Basij resistance bases are located in mosques and 5% in other holy places.”\n\nIranian state media repeatedly has aired images of mosques damaged in the protests without exploring their links to the Basij.\n\n“Most neighborhood Basij bases are co-located with mosques and most neighborhood Basij leaders are associated with the mosque leadership,\" Ostovar said, adding that demonstrators “going after regime targets” associated with repression would have considered them “a legitimate part of it.”\n\nVideos show Basij holding long guns, batons and pellet guns. Anti-riot police can be seen wearing helmets and body armor, carrying assault rifles and submachine guns.\n\nThe videos show police firing shotguns into crowds, something authorities deny despite corpses showing wounds consistent with metal birdshot. Scores have reportedly suffered blinding eye wounds from birdshot — something seen in the protests around the 2022 death of Mahsa Amini.\n\nIran's semiofficial ILNA news agency reported that Tehran's Farabi Eye Hospital, the premiere clinic for eye injuries, called in “all current and retired doctors” to help those injured.\n\nWe “received accounts that the security forces were just firing relentlessly at protesters,” said Bahreini of Amnesty International.\n\n\"They’re not just targeting one or two people to create a climate of terror for people to disperse ... but just relentlessly firing at thousands of protesters and chasing after them, even as they were fleeing so that more people were just collapsing to the ground with severe gunshot wounds.”\n\nCasualties grow as crackdown intensifies\n\nFor two weeks, Iran offered no overall casualty figures. Then on Wednesday, the government said 3,117 people were killed, including 2,427 civilians and security forces. That left another 690 dead that Pourjamshidian identified as “terrorists.”\n\nThat conflicts with figures from the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency, which put the death toll on Saturday at 5,137, based on activists inside Iran verifying fatalities against public records and witness statements. It said 4,834 were demonstrators, 208 were government-affiliated personnel, 54 were children and 41 were civilians not participating in protests.\n\nDeath tolls in Iran have long been inflated or deflated for political reasons. But the fact that Iran's theocracy offered any death toll — and gave a number beyond any other political unrest to strike the country in the modern era — underlines the scale of what happened.\n\nIt also provides a justification for the ongoing mass arrest campaign and internet shutdown. State media report dozens to hundreds of people detained daily.\n\nPourjamshidian also gave an extensive list of vandalism from the protests and crackdown, including 750 banks, 414 government buildings, 600 ATMs and hundreds of vehicles that sustained damage.\n\nMeanwhile, uncertainty looms for Iran's theocracy over what Trump may or may not do.\n\nTraditionally, Iranians hold memorial services for their late loved ones 40 days after their deaths — meaning the country could see renewed demonstrations around Feb. 17. Online videos from Behesht-e Zahra, the massive cemetery on the outskirts of Tehran, show mourners chanting: “Death to Khamenei!”\n\nSatellite photos from Planet Labs PBC analyzed by the AP show large numbers of cars daily at Behesht-e Zahra’s southern reaches, where those killed in the demonstrations are being buried.\n\nElaheh Mohammadi, a journalist at Tehran's pro-reform newspaper Ham Mihan, recently noted it had been shut by authorities. She said journalists were working on stories about Behesht-e Zahra they weren't able to publish.\n\n“We send out a message to let people know we’re still alive,” Mohammadi wrote online. “The city smells of death.”\n\n“Hard days have passed and everyone is stunned; a whole country is in mourning, a whole country is holding back tears, a whole country has a lump in its throat.\"",
