    "fullText": "Rich Beem has given some insight into what viewers at home might not pick up on about how Scottie Scheffler acts on the course, as the world number one looks to get back on track after an odd start to the year.\n\nScottie Scheffler may have already picked up a win this season, but his slow starts in recent events have caught more attention than his victory at The American Express.\n\nHe’s failed to shoot under par in the opening rounds of his last three tournaments: the WM Phoenix Open, the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am, and now the Genesis Invitational.\n\nOn Thursday at Riviera, he was five over through 10 holes when play was suspended, marking the worst opening round of his PGA Tour career.\n\nWhat’s made things stranger is how he has responded each time. Despite the slow starts, Scheffler hasn’t finished lower than 12th this year and was just one shot away from making the playoff at TPC Scottsdale.\n\nSpeaking on the Sky Sports Golf Podcast, Rich Beem said he is confused by what is happening with Scheffler right now. He also pointed out that the 29-year-old might not be as calm as people think.\n\n“I can’t explain it. Somebody has asked me what’s going on with Scottie Scheffler? Well, he’s human, first of all, we know that. It doesn’t make sense, especially from the standpoint of Phoenix, he still went out and made five or six birdies in the opening round and still shot over par,” he said.\n\n“I can understand maybe Riviera, opening day, very tough. I can even understand maybe a little bit where you get off to a bland start at Pebble Beach. It’s not going to get any easier going forward. I’m assuming his next start is going to be Bay Hill where he’s won. Then he’s going to go to The Players Championship, one of the hardest golf courses on tour.\n\n“It’s a trend that could continue just because of the venues, not that I fully expect it to, but it’s just not happening for him. And we all know that he gets a little hot under the collar at times. Maybe some people don’t quite see it as much as we do in the media when we follow him every day.”\n\nThere’s an argument that Scheffler handles pressure better than anyone else in the field. Few players look as relaxed when they’re out in front.\n\nBut heading into 2026, it’s been a while since we’ve seen him truly at his best. Even when results dipped early last season, he was coming off a hand injury – and most understood the slow return.\n\nHe’s had his moments of frustration too. The one that stands out is his reaction during the BMW Championship in 2024, which drew plenty of criticism at the time.\n\nEven so, you have to give Scheffler credit for how he’s managed to fight back recently. In each of his last three starts, he turned things around when it could have gone wrong.\n\nIf he hadn’t found a way to channel that frustration, there’s every chance he’d have missed two cuts already this season – and not by narrow margins either.\n\nWyndham Clark says if women’s golfers should be allowed to play on TGL\n\nRory McIlroy’s recent comments suggest a new caddie is needed to take his game to the next level\n\n90-year-old Gary Player shares key golf swing advice with eye-catching workout video",

    "fullText": "The World Baseball Classic is not just a tournament; it is a high-stakes, emotion-fueled battleground where national pride is on the line with every pitch. Since its inception in 2006, the WBC has delivered some of the most electric, unforgettable moments in the sport’s history, transforming spring training tune-ups into global spectacles. The tournament brings together the absolute best players on the planet, allowing them to drape their country’s flag over their shoulders and compete for ultimate bragging rights.\n\nOver the course of five iterations, with the next chapter set to unfold in 2026, certain nations have separated themselves from the pack. They have built dynasties, broken hearts, and consistently found ways to survive the chaotic, sudden-death nature of international tournament play. Some of these countries rely on deep pipelines of MLB superstars, while others lean on established domestic leagues and unmatched team chemistry to topple the heavyweights.\n\nBut when the dust settles, the truest measure of a baseball powerhouse is simple: who wins when the lights are brightest? Taking a look at the all-time victory leaderboard heading into the 2026 tournament reveals a fascinating hierarchy of global baseball talent. It highlights the expected juggernauts alongside a few nations that consistently punch above their weight on the international stage.​\n\nFrom the passionate fanbases of the Caribbean to the meticulously crafted rosters of Asia and the deep talent pools of North America, here is how the most successful countries in World Baseball Classic history stack up.\n\nMexico has steadily evolved into a legitimate force on the WBC stage, proving it can hang with anyone in the world. Their unforgettable run to the semifinals in 2023, highlighted by a massive upset over Team USA, proved that their blend of MLB talent and fearless pitching is a recipe for deep tournament runs. They always bring the heat and a passionately loud fan base to the ballpark.​\n\nDo not let the European flag fool you; the Netherlands is an absolute baseball powerhouse fueled by elite talent from Curaçao and Aruba. They have a reputation as the tournament’s ultimate giant-slayer, most notably breaking Dominican hearts with a pair of stunning walk-off wins in 2009. With a consistently slick-fielding infield and timely hitting, they are a perennial threat to reach the championship rounds.​\n\nVenezuela’s rosters always read like an MLB All-Star ballot, loaded with franchise cornerstones and elite sluggers. While they have occasionally struggled to translate that immense on-paper talent into championship hardware, their explosive offense makes them a nightmare matchup. When their pitching staff aligns with their heavy hitters, they are practically unstoppable.\n\nSouth Korea approaches the WBC with a level of tactical precision and national pride that makes them an incredibly tough out. Their dramatic run to the 2009 final against Japan cemented their status as an elite baseball nation. Armed with contact-heavy lineups and fundamentally flawless defense, they know exactly how to execute in high-pressure situations.\n\nLong considered the boogeymen of international amateur baseball, Cuba’s rich history in the sport translates beautifully to the WBC. They stormed to the finals in the inaugural 2006 tournament and have consistently remained a threat ever since. Even as the global talent pool has deepened, their aggressive style of play and raw athleticism demand total respect.​\n\nThe Dominican Republic brings a level of swagger and star power to the WBC that is simply unmatched. Their dominant, undefeated run to the 2013 championship remains one of the most impressive feats in tournament history. When this island nation gets rolling, it transforms the stadium into a massive party, fueled by elite pitching and light-tower power.\n\nDespite inventing the game, Team USA took a while to fully figure out the unique rhythm of the World Baseball Classic. They finally broke through to claim the crown in 2017 and followed it up with a thrilling run to the 2023 final. When the American superstars fully buy in, their sheer depth of talent is an overwhelming force of nature.\n\n​\n\nNo team plays with more visible joy, passion, and chemistry than Puerto Rico. They have suffered consecutive heartbreaking defeats in the 2013 and 2017 championship games, but their consistency is undeniably impressive. Famous for their blond hair dye and relentless energy, they are the heartbeat of the tournament and an absolute joy to watch.\n\nSamurai Japan is the undisputed king of the World Baseball Classic, boasting three tournament titles and an unmatched aura of dominance. From Daisuke Matsuzaka’s heroics in 2006 to Shohei Ohtani’s epic 2023 strikeout, their WBC history is the stuff of legend. Their incredible fundamental execution and elite pitching depth make them the ultimate gold standard of international baseball.\n\nMORE: Top 10 Winter Olympians of Team USA since 2000\n\nThe beauty of the World Baseball Classic lies in its unpredictability, where a single pitch can alter the course of a nation’s sporting history. While Japan currently sits comfortably on the throne, the gap between the traditional powerhouses and the rest of the world is rapidly closing. As we look ahead to 2026, the stage is set for new rivalries, fresh upsets, and another thrilling chapter in the greatest international baseball showcase on earth.\n\nOLYMPICS: Final 2026 Winter Olympics medal count, standings\n\nNFL: 4 blockbuster NFL trades we want to see before the 2026 draft\n\nNFL DRAFT: 2026 NFL Scouting Combine day-to-day TV schedule, how to watch\n\nMLB: MLB Power Rankings as 2026 Spring Training begins\n\nNBA: Updated NBA Power Rankings as a new week begins\n\nVIRAL: Watch Johnny Gaudreau’s children join Team USA hockey gold medal celebration\n\nThe post Most wins in World Baseball Classic’ appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "title": "Lasses Spotlight: Sunderland Women On The International Stage",
    "description": "There’s an international break coming up for Sunderland Women - how will this affect Mel Reay’s squad?",
    "fullText": "International breaks can sometimes feel like an interruption to the rhythm of a club season, but for Sunderland Women, this one serves as a powerful reminder of who they are becoming. Seven players have been called up across four nations, spanning senior World Cup qualifiers and youth international fixtures. Not one of these selections is unexpected. Every player involved is already a recognised figure within their national programme, and their call-ups reflect continuity, trust and the calibre of footballer Sunderland now attract and develop.\n\nFor a club that has rebuilt itself with patience and purpose, this international window is not merely a point of pride. It is a statement about Sunderland’s trajectory. The squad is no longer a collection of promising Championship players quietly working under the radar. It is a group whose influence stretches across continents, whose talent is acknowledged at the highest levels, and whose presence on the international stage feels entirely natural.\n\nKatie Kitching’s involvement with New Zealand is a perfect example. Her selection for the Football Ferns’ World Cup qualifiers is not a surprise, nor is it a sudden breakthrough. Kitching has been part of New Zealand’s plans for some time, and her performances for Sunderland have only reinforced her standing. She has been one of the club’s most consistent and influential players since she arrived, combining technical quality with intelligence and a relentless work ethic. Her ability to link midfield and attack, to carry the ball with purpose, and to dictate tempo has made her indispensable on Wearside.\n\nFor New Zealand, she offers versatility and composure in high-pressure fixtures. For Sunderland, her international involvement is another layer in her development, exposing her to different tactical demands and the intensity of knockout-style football. Her call-up is not a reward for a purple patch; it is a continuation of her established role within a national team preparing for a crucial qualifying campaign.\n\nThe Republic of Ireland contingent reflects a group of players who are already firmly embedded in their national setup, each at different stages of their international journey. Jamie Finn, Grace Moloney and Marissa Sheva are all familiar figures within the Irish squad, and their call-ups for World Cup qualifiers are entirely consistent with their standing.\n\nFinn, with more than twenty caps to her name, has long been a trusted figure for Ireland. Her versatility, tactical intelligence and composure have made her a reliable presence in green, just as they have in red and white. At Sunderland she has been a model of consistency, adapting seamlessly to different roles and offering a level of maturity that anchors the team around her. Her selection is not news; it is simply the continuation of a career that has already earned significant international respect.\n\nMoloney’s inclusion reflects her growing importance within the Irish goalkeeping group. With nine caps, she is still in the earlier stages of her international career, but she has quickly established herself as a dependable option. Her performances for Sunderland have shown her authority and shot-stopping qualities that translate naturally to the international stage. Her call-up is a recognition of her upward trajectory and the trust she has earned in recent windows.\n\nSheva, meanwhile, brings twenty caps’ worth of experience to the Irish forward line. Her energy, directness and relentless work rate have made her a valuable asset for Ireland, just as they have for Sunderland. She is a player who stretches defences, presses intelligently and offers versatility across the front line. Her involvement in the qualifiers is entirely expected, reflecting her established role within the squad and the consistency of her contributions.\n\nWales have also turned to Sunderland for their World Cup qualifiers, selecting Rhiannon Roberts and Mared Griffiths. Roberts is one of the most experienced internationals in the squad, a player whose leadership and defensive intelligence have been central to Wales’ progress in recent years. Her presence at Sunderland has already proven invaluable, offering guidance to younger players and stability in key moments. Her call-up is a continuation of a distinguished international career, and her performances in the WSL2 have shown that she remains a player of significant quality.\n\nGriffiths’ selection comes at a very different moment in her club journey. Having only just joined Sunderland on loan from Manchester United in January 2026, she has not yet made her debut for the club. Her call-up, therefore, is not a reflection of her time on Wearside but of her established standing within the Welsh national setup. A talented and composed midfielder, Griffiths has been steadily building her international profile, and her involvement in Wales’ qualifiers is a natural continuation of that trajectory. For Sunderland, her arrival and immediate international involvement underline the calibre of player the club is now able to attract.\n\nNew loan signing, Caragh Hamilton has also been called up for Northern Ireland. Interestingly enough on their announcement graphic as a ‘forward’ which surprise a few fans myself included. Although she is listed as a defender at club level, Northern Ireland have frequently used her higher up the pitch as a midfielder and winger, where her energy, ball carrying and pressing suit the demands of international football.\n\nHamilton’s inclusion in the Northern Ireland squad for the FIFA Women’s World Cup 2027 qualifiers against Switzerland and Turkiye is a deserved recognition of her consistency and experience at international level. Hamilton has been a senior Northern Ireland international since 2012 and has accumulated 53 caps and 7 goals for her country, making her one of the squad’s most seasoned players. Her versatility, experience and tactical intelligence make her an important asset as Northern Ireland look to build momentum in their World Cup qualifying campaign.\n\nMared Griffiths’ call up to the Wales senior squad for their upcoming fixtures is another important step in the rise of one of the most exciting young midfielders in British football. Still only eighteen, Griffiths has already made four senior appearances for Wales and scored once, building on an impressive youth international record that includes fifteen caps and three goals for the under seventeen side and six caps and one goal for the under nineteen team.\n\nShe plays primarily as a midfielder for Wales, operating with intelligence, energy and a natural ability to carry the ball through tight spaces. Her recent performances at club level, including her sensational long range goal on her Sunderland debut, have only strengthened her reputation as a player with enormous potential. Wales have used her in central and advanced midfield roles, trusting her creativity and composure in possession. Her ongoing development at Sunderland, combined with her growing international experience, makes her an increasingly important figure for Wales as they build towards future qualification campaigns.\n\nCompleting the list is Ella West, called up to Scotland’s Under-19 squad for a series of friendlies. While youth international fixtures may not carry the same weight as senior qualifiers, they are crucial in shaping the careers of young players. West has been on Scotland’s radar for some time, and her selection is a continuation of her involvement at youth level. For her, this is an opportunity to test herself against high-quality opposition, to experience the demands of international football, and to continue her development in an environment designed to challenge and elevate young talent.\n\nHer call-up also reflects Sunderland’s long-standing commitment to youth development. The club has a proud history of producing players who go on to represent their countries, and West’s inclusion continues that tradition. She is a player with significant potential, and her international involvement will only enrich her understanding of the game.\n\nTaken together, these call-ups paint a picture of a squad that is both diverse and deeply talented. Sunderland Women are no longer a team quietly rebuilding in the Championship; they are a club whose players are shaping international campaigns, influencing World Cup qualifiers, and representing their nations with pride. The breadth of call-ups, spanning New Zealand, Ireland, Wales and Scotland, speaks to the global reach of the squad and the quality that runs through it.\n\nFor the club, this international break is a moment to reflect on the progress made in recent years. Sunderland have built a squad that blends experience with youth, international pedigree with domestic promise. The players called up are not fringe figures or occasional squad members; they are central to their national teams’ plans. That level of recognition is not accidental. It is the result of careful recruitment, strong coaching and a culture that encourages players to grow, compete and aspire.\n\nThere is also a practical benefit. Players who compete internationally return with sharpened instincts, heightened confidence and a deeper understanding of the game. They bring back lessons learned from facing different styles, different systems and different pressures. That experience filters into the squad, raising standards and enriching the team’s tactical awareness.\n\nOf course, international duty also brings challenges. Travel, fatigue and the risk of injury are always considerations. But for Sunderland, the positives far outweigh the concerns. Having so many players involved in international football enhances the club’s reputation, attracts new talent and reinforces the message that Sunderland is a place where careers can flourish.\n\nAs the league resumes, the returning internationals will bring with them the momentum of representing their countries. They will return to a squad that has grown in confidence and cohesion, ready to push forward in the WSL2. And they will carry with them the pride of having worn their national colours, knowing that they are part of a club that supports and celebrates their ambitions.\n\nThis international break is not a pause for Sunderland Women. It is a milestone, a marker of how far the club has come and a glimpse of where it is heading. With players competing on the world stage, the future looks bright, ambitious and full of possibility. And when they return to Wearside, they will do so not just as Sunderland players, but as representatives of nations, carrying experience that will only strengthen the team’s journey ahead.",

    "description": "A video of influencer RJ Princy Parikh with David Miller went viral after India’s loss, but she claimed she received rape threats and body-shaming abuse, prompting her to delete it from Facebook and plan a police complaint. On the field, South Africa beat India by 76 runs, bowling them out for 111. David Miller starred with 63, while Jansen and Maharaj led the bowling.",
    "fullText": "In the clip, Parikh was seen circling Miller, with the caption “David Miller! What a player” and the on-screen line “I thought we were friends, David.”\n\nSoon after, Parikh claimed she started receiving serious online abuse, including rape threats and body-shaming comments. Because of this, she deleted the video from Facebook but kept it on Instagram, and said she plans to file a police complaint over the threats.\n\nSouth Africa crushed India by 76 runs in their first Super Eight match of the T20 World Cup 2026 at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad, leaving India in a must-win situation for their remaining two games to reach the semifinals. \n\nChasing 188, India were bowled out for just 111 in 18.5 overs, ending their 12-match T20 World Cup winning streak.\n\nIndia’s chase collapsed early, with Ishan Kishan and Tilak Varma falling cheaply. Suryakumar Yadav and Abhishek Sharma tried to rebuild, but Sharma was dismissed in the fifth over. \n\nWashington Sundar and Yadav also failed to build partnerships, and although Hardik Pandya and Shivam Dube added 35 runs, regular wickets kept India under pressure. Dube’s dismissal for 42 sealed India’s fate.\n\nSouth Africa’s bowlers dominated, with Marco Jansen taking 4/22, Keshav Maharaj 3/24, and Lungi Ngidi conceding just 15 runs in four overs. \n\nEarlier, David Miller anchored South Africa’s innings with a match-winning 63 off 35 balls after they were 20/3, sharing a 97-run stand with Dewald Brevis (45 off 29). Tristan Stubbs added a quick 44* to help South Africa post 187/7. Jasprit Bumrah took 3/15.",

    "fullText": "Ryan Woodman missed out on the Six Nations, but the promising Dragons forward has been backed to be in the Wales squad at next year's World Cup.\n\nThe 22-year-old blind-side flanker, who can also play lock, is on Steve Tandy's radar and trained with the Test squad last month.\n\nHe is a leading option if Wales need reinforcements for Ireland and Italy after losing flanker Taine Plumtree and lock Rhys Davies to injury.\n\nDragons defence coach Dale MacLeod is confident Woodman will make an international breakthrough soon, and tips him to be mixing it with the world's best in Australia next year.\n\n\"He is a talent and I have no doubt that he will be in the group that goes to the World Cup,\" said MacLeod.\n\nCardiff coach Van Zyl holds talks with Benetton\n\nMurchie to join Wales as defence coach in summer\n\n'Life in Welsh rugby' but stats show issues remain\n\nThe former Wales Under-20s captain will feature for Dragons against Benetton at Rodney Parade on Saturday (17:30 GMT).\n\n\"It's really important that we manage him and don't get him there too early,\" said MacLeod about the forward's international ambitions.\n\n\"He got the opportunity train with Wales and it's so good when young men get a small taste of it.\n\n\"I think it's critical that they get a taste rather than getting thrown in and it was great for him because he is a super talent.\n\n\"I believe he has the attributes to become world class, it's just how we manage, grow and develop him.\n\n\"Steve and his coaching group are doing a great job and I love how they are growing the next lot of players.\"\n\nWoodman made his Dragons debut in 2023 and has made 42 appearances.\n\nHe has featured in 12 of 15 games this season, showing his versatility with two starts in the second row.\n\n\"Aerially he is outstanding, whether at the line-out or catching high balls. On the edges he has a good skill set and is growing his collisions and physicality,\" said Macleod.\n\n\"Being a tall lad that will take a bit of time, but he's right across the game whether in defence or attack.

    "fullText": "Morocco are weighing up a sensational move to hire Xavi Hernandez as doubts intensify over the future of head coach Walid Regragui just months before the 2026 World Cup, per The Athletic.\n\nThe Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF) has publicly denied that Regragui has left his post, but senior figures have sounded out potential replacements.\n\nFormer Barcelona midfielder and head coach Xavi is among the names being discussed.\n\nNo agreement has been reached, and sources close to the Spanish tactician suggest he would prefer to take on a new role after this summer’s tournament rather than immediately.\n\nRegragui made history by guiding Morocco to the semi-finals of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, the furthest any African nation has progressed in the competition.\n\nThat remarkable run increased expectations at home, fuelled by significant investment in facilities and infrastructure over the past decade.\n\nHowever, subsequent tournaments have failed to match that high.\n\nMorocco exited at the last-16 stage of the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations and then fell agonisingly short in last month’s 2025 final, losing in extra time to Senegal on home soil.\n\nCriticism of Regragui’s pragmatic style has grown louder, with pressure mounting despite his previous achievements.\n\nMorocco have been drawn alongside Brazil, Scotland and Haiti at the expanded 2026 finals in the United States, Canada and Mexico, and the FRMF could make a coaching change before the tournament begins.\n\nXavi would be a bold appointment. The 46-year-old impressed during his stint as Barcelona head coach, winning the league and Spanish Super Cup while blooding many young players.\n\nA World Cup winner with Spain in 2010, he enjoyed a glittering career at Barcelona, lifting four Champions League titles and eight La Liga crowns.\n\nHe moved into coaching with Al-Sadd and later returned to manage Barcelona between 2021 and 2024.",

    "fullText": "Liverpool could hit two birds with one stone if they are to sign the latest name being linked with the club.\n\nAccording to the father of Roland Sallai, Szoboszlai's international teammate, Liverpool have already made contact to sign the Galatasaray winger.\n\n\"Liverpool could be such a destination, and I admit, I wouldn't be surprised if this club change happened now, in the winter,\" Tibor Sallai told Blikk.\n\n\"I know that contact has already been made through a management office. I don't want to and I don't want to shout anything, but my son will really have a good chance in the summer, if there is an offer that is also beneficial for Galatasaray, to change country and level. It wouldn't be just any moment if Liverpool were to run out onto the Anfield Road turf with three Hungarians in the starting lineup.\"\n\nSallai's father is referencing the fact that Liverpool already have Milos Kerkez and Szoboszlai playing for them.\n\nHere's why this could be a really good move for Liverpool. While Sallai is a little bit on the more experienced side he is an extremely versatile player.\n\nPredominantly, he is a winger. He has been playing that position ever since he started his career in senior football.\n\nBut this season Sallai has also become a right-back at Galatasaray. He's played really well in that position, impressing against Juventus and Manchester City in the Champions League, while coming up against some really tricky wingers.\n\nSo, there should be no surprise that he would be on Liverpool's radar. Sallai is the type of player Liverpools' recruitment team have loved over the last few years.\n\nHe can solve a problem at right-back, he can provide depth on the wings, and on top of that he's even played through the middle for Hungary's national team, so he could potentially be used as a false nine, too.",

    "description": "JP Morgan Chase chief warns that rising asset prices with people leveraging to the hilt is reminiscent of the 2008 global financial crisis",
    "fullText": "Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JP Morgan Chase, has warned that some lenders are doing “dumb things” and he is starting to see parallels to the era before the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nDimon, 69, who steered America’s biggest bank through the global financial crisis, told investors: “Unfortunately, we did see this in ’05, ’06 and ’07, almost the same thing — the rising tide was lifting all boats, everyone was making a lot of money, people were leveraging to the hilt.\n\n“My own view is people getting a little comfortable that this is real, these high asset prices and high volumes, and we won’t have any kind of problem, whatsoever.”\n\n• How a doomsday AI blog post wiped out billions\n\nReferring to unspecified competitors, he added: “I see a couple people doing some dumb things. They’re just doing dumb things to create [net interest income], or say they’re winning in the mortgage business.”\n\nHe also said he expects the credit cycle will eventually deteriorate again, potentially as a result of AI related disruption to software companies.\n\n“There’s always a surprise in a credit cycle … And this time around, it might be software, because of AI … There’s moving tectonic plates underneath it, it causes the industry to be challenged.”\n\nDimon warned in October about weakness in the credit market after the collapses of auto lender Tricolor Holdings and car-parts supplier First Brands Group. He told investors at the time: “When you see one cockroach, there are probably more, and so everyone should be forewarned of this one.”\n\nDimon’s latest warning came as a Bank of America client survey found that, for the first time, an “AI bubble” is the biggest concern of credit investors, who noted the high levels of borrowing of cloud service providers, known as “hyperscalers”, including Microsoft, Amazon, Meta Platforms and Google.\n\nInvestors expect hyperscaler debt issuance of $285 billion this year, up from the $210 billion expected in December’s survey. Some 23 per cent of respondents saw the threat of an AI bubble as their top concern, up from 9 per cent in Bank of America’s previous survey in December.\n\nFears of a potentially unsustainable surge in investment and valuations of AI companies overtook “bubbles in credit” as the top concern, according to the survey.\n\nMeanwhile, “few worry about geopolitics or a central bank policy error”, the bank’s analysts wrote.\n\nHowever, investors were less worried about the ultimate tech disruption ahead, with only 10 per cent saying that AI-driven corporate obsolescence is their big worry.",

    "fullText": "The Citrini Research report titled “The 2028 Global Intelligence Crisis” became a major viral sensation this week across social media platforms. The conversation has been dominated by a significant lean toward the findings as 77% of influencers align with the warnings while 23% express disagreement. The report gained massive traction because it presents a detailed scenario in which the success of artificial intelligence (AI) leads to a systemic financial collapse. It specifically targets the stability of the global economy and has influenced market prices for several major technology and payment companies as people evaluate the implications of abundant machine intelligence, says GlobalData, a leading intelligence and productivity platform.\n\nShreyasee Majumder, Social Media Analyst at GlobalData, comments: “The overall sentiment among influencers reflects a deep and growing anxiety about the unmodeled risks associated with rapid technological advancement. Most observers view the report as a vital stress test for existing economic assumptions about labor and consumption. Influencers see the current environment as a high stakes game where labs and corporations are forced to automate even if doing so eventually damages the consumer base that supports their revenue.”\n\nBased on an analysis of the tweets, the reaction to Citrini Research’s report is polarized, viral, and highly engaged. Here is a summary of the discussions, divided into opinions of agreement and disagreement:\n\nInfluencers agree with AI displacement spiral\n\nInfluencers disagree with predicted global crisis",

    "fullText": "Japan’s OHISAMA demonstration satellite is scheduled to be launched in fiscal 2026 on a mission that could revolutionize clean energy.\n\nAlthough earlier experiments have detected signals transmitted from orbit, the OHISAMA project aims to be the first in the world to deliver solar power to a receiving site on Earth and convert it into usable electricity.\n\nThe satellite will be carried aboard Space One Co.’s Kairos 5 small rocket.\n\nSpace-based solar power (SBSP) refers to the concept of placing large solar collectors in orbit that can convert sunlight into electricity onboard. That energy is transmitted wirelessly, typically by microwave or in some concepts by laser, to a receiving station on Earth.\n\nThe received energy is then converted back into electricity for distribution through the grid.\n\nSBSP remains an experimental technology and is positioned as a long-term research and development target under the Japanese government’s Basic Energy Plan.\n\nUnlike ground-based solar and wind power, SBSP is largely insulated from weather-related variables and the day-night cycle.\n\nIn addition, the ability to modulate transmission output and redirect power to different locations could make SBSP a flexible option during disasters and periods of fluctuating demand.\n\nA model proposed by Japan Space Systems (J-spacesystems), a nonprofit R&D foundation commissioned by the Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry to develop the system, envisions an architecture featuring 2.5-kilometer-square solar arrays deployed in geostationary orbit about 36,000 kilometers above Earth.\n\nElectricity generated in orbit would be transmitted by microwave to a ground-based receiving antenna roughly 4 kilometers in diameter and then fed into the power grid.\n\nUnder this model, a single SBSP unit would generate about 1 gigawatt, an output described as sufficient to cover more than 10 percent of Tokyo’s annual electricity consumption.\n\nMICROWAVES BEAMED FROM 450 KM ABOVE\n\nAccording to J-spacesystems, the experiment will test whether power transmitted from space as microwaves can be efficiently converted back into electricity on the ground.\n\nThe OHISAMA satellite, weighing about 180 kg, carries an integrated power-generation and transmission panel measuring 70 cm by 2 meters.\n\nIts generating capacity is a modest 720 watts, but the mission aims to use energy received by a 64-meter parabolic antenna at the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency’s (JAXA) Usuda Deep Space Center in Nagano Prefecture to light an LED.\n\nThe Usuda facility is used to track and communicate with deep-space spacecraft.\n\nFollowing a successful wireless power transmission test from an aircraft at an altitude of 7 km in 2024, the satellite mission will beam power from a 450-km orbit to assess how transmission distance, the ionosphere and the atmosphere affect efficiency.\n\nA central challenge in SBSP wireless power delivery is limiting diffraction-driven beam spreading, which typically requires very large transmitting apertures and precise phase control.\n\nMany SBSP concepts rely on retrodirective beam control: the ground-based rectenna sends a pilot signal that the satellite uses to steer the microwave beam back toward the receiver.\n\nJapan has extensive R&D experience in microwave power transmission and retrodirective beam pointing.\n\nAccording to J-spacesystems, SBSP development is accelerating in the United States, China and Europe, and the U.S. military is also widely believed to be pursuing its own experimental satellites.\n\nFirst proposed in the United States in the 1960s, the SBSP concept holds that space-based systems could deliver as much as 10 times more energy per year than terrestrial solar because cloud cover and the day-night cycle constrain generation on Earth.\n\nIn Japan, SBSP research and development has been under way since the 1980s. Through ground-based trials and other tests, Japan has advanced the demonstration and validation of key component technologies, including high-precision beam control, integrated generation-and-transmission panels, and more efficient conversion of electrical power into microwaves.\n\n“Technologically, Japan is leading the world in this field,” said Hiroki Yanagawa, a senior executive in J-spacesystems’ Satellite System and Earth Observation Division.\n\nSBSP COULD POWER LUNAR EXPLORATION\n\nIn 2023, the California Institute of Technology launched an SBSP demonstrator and succeeded in short‑distance power transmission in space as well as in detecting faint microwave signals on the ground. But it did not deliver usable electricity at meaningful levels.\n\nIf electricity beamed from OHISAMA can be received, converted and used on the ground, it would represent a world first.\n\nSuch a success would likely be followed by additional in-orbit trials, with an eye toward commercialization in the 2040s. Potential longer-term applications include supplying power from orbit to support lunar exploration missions.\n\nThe launch schedule, however, remains contingent on the performance of Space One’s Kairos rocket.\n\nAfter failures of the first two launches, attention has shifted to the flight of Kairos 3 on Feb. 25.\n\n“While overseas rockets were an option, we selected Kairos in line with national policy to support Japan’s private-sector launch capabilities,” said Yanagawa of J-spacesystems.",

    "fullText": "As the Northeast U.S. begins to dig out from a powerful blizzard, more than two dozen flights in and out of Southwest Florida International Airport (RSW) in Fort Myers were canceled on Tuesday, Feb. 24, according to FlightAware.\n\nThe blizzard caused over 2,000 U.S. flights to be canceled Tuesday, with the bulk of disruptions in and around New York, Boston and Philadelphia.\n\nAcross Florida airports, 114 flights were delayed and around 385 canceled, with most at Orlando, Fort Lauderdale, Miami and Tampa.\n\nOn Monday, Feb. 23, the winter storm caused at least 90 cancellations and 15 delays at RSW.\n\nAirlines, including American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, JetBlue, Southwest and United Airlines, are waiving change fees and fare differences for those who planned to travel to the hardest-hit areas and now need to change plans.\n\nAccording to FlightAware.com, which provides real-time flight information, as of 7:30 a.m., the following delays and cancellations of flights have been reported within, into or out of the United States today, Feb. 24:\n\nFlight cancellations and delays at RSW as of 10 a.m., Feb. 23, according to FlightAware:\n\nHere's the breakdown by airport as of around 7:30 a.m. Feb. 24. Click the airport names for detailed flight info and updated numbers throughout the day.\n\nDon't wait until you're already at the airport to check your flight. Monitor your flight early and often, starting now, as cancellations will increase as the weather conditions worsen.\n\nDownload your airline’s mobile app and turn on push and text notifications for alerts about your flight. Some apps have a “Where’s My Plane?” feature that lets you see whether the aircraft scheduled to operate your flight has arrived, is delayed en route, or hasn’t departed yet from its previous airport. That can be an early signal of trouble.\n\nIf your flight is canceled, use the airline's mobile app to rebook as soon as possible, according to Scott Keyes, founder of Going. If you need to talk to someone, Keyes suggests calling one of the carrier’s international lines.\n\n\"The best thing travelers can do is to be as proactive as possible switching to a new flight,” Keyes told USA TODAY. “When a flight gets canceled, all of a sudden hundreds of passengers need new itineraries. There may only be a handful of seats left on the best flights, and it's a first-come, first-(served) endeavor.”\n\nIf your flight is canceled for any reason, you’re entitled to a full refund if you choose not to fly on alternative itineraries offered by your airline. The same goes for “significant” delays or changes.\n\nYou can get all of Florida’s best content directly in your inbox each weekday day by signing up for the free newsletter, Florida TODAY.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Fort Myers News-Press: RSW airport flight cancellations today after Northeast blizzard",

    "description": "The UK-based autonomous vehicle software startup said on Tuesday it had raised $1.5 billion from a host of Big Tech giants and global automakers.",
    "fullText": "Wayve is revving up its global robotaxi ambitions with fresh funding as it prepares to take on Waymo in London.\n\nThe UK-based autonomous vehicle software startup announced early Tuesday in the UK that it had raised $1.5 billion from a host of Big Tech giants and major automakers.\n\nThe funding round, which values the startup at $8.6 billion, includes $1.2 billion from investors including Microsoft, Nvidia, and Uber, as well as Mercedes-Benz, Nissan, and Stellantis.\n\nIt also includes additional capital from Uber, which is tied to deployments of Wayve-powered robotaxis across the globe. The two companies have a deal to launch self-driving vehicles on Uber's app in over 10 markets worldwide, starting with London this year.\n\n\"We've been learning to drive on British roads for the last eight years, and so this is our home turf,\" Alex Kendall, CEO of Wayve, told Business Insider in an interview.\n\nThe CEO said the latest funding round is key to pursuing the company's ambition to license its software to major automakers and robotaxi fleet platforms like Uber.\n\nUnlike Tesla or Waymo, Wayve is solely focused on developing software for other companies looking to deploy self-driving cars. It is not building its own fleet of robotaxis.\n\nKendall said owning a fleet is expensive, and Tesla's approach to building its own car can be a constraint since it limits the company to one vehicle platform.\n\n\"Everyone wants autonomy, but not everyone wants to buy a Tesla,\" he said.\n\nKendall added that Wayve's AI driver is designed to be generalizable — the same way a human can quickly learn to drive different cars and in new cities.\n\nThat allows Wayve's technology to quickly adapt to new driving environments and learn new road rules, from switching to the opposite side of the road to right turns at a red light, without relying on high-definition mapping and sensors, the approach taken by rivals like Waymo. It also allows the AI driver to be adapted by different automakers, which may have different sensor configurations on their cars, such as lidar or cameras.\n\n\"Because that's what we've built, it enables us to take this business model that enables high-margin software revenues,\" Kendall said.\n\nWayve says that over the past year, its fleet of Ford Mach-Es outfitted with its AI driver has driven in more than 500 cities across Europe, North America, and Japan without being trained on city-specific data.\n\nThe company is also planning to license its technology to carmakers as an advanced driver-assistance system like Tesla's Full Self-Driving, which handles most driving tasks with human supervision.

    "title": "Now Discord Is Saying It's Delaying Global Age Verification",
    "description": "Discord is taking its age verification rollout back to the drawing board.",
    "fullText": "Since it was announced a little over a week ago, Discord's global age verification rollout has been a bit of a mess. First, the chatroom and voice chat company had to clarify that it won't require all adults to upload an ID or facial scan to prove how old they are, as the initial post left many users with that impression. Second, the announcement came shortly after one if its existing customer service partners was breached, which lead to hackers getting a hold of user information, including government IDs provided for age verification. Third, users discovered that Discord had partnered with Peter Thiel-backed company Persona for an experiment in the UK, which raised flags about surveillance and security, and saw some personal identifying information being uploaded to the cloud when users thought it would be processed on-device. Now, Discord is admitting that it messed up, and is trying to make amends.\n\nIn a post on its website, titled \"Getting Global Age Assurance Right: What We Got Wrong and What's Changing,\" Discord admitted that its new \"teen-by-default\" age settings haven't had the warmest reception. The company said that it \"knew this rollout was going to be controversial,\" but added that \"we failed at our most basic job: clearly explaining what we're doing and why.\" It then reiterated that \"over 90% of users will never need to verify their age to continue using Discord exactly as they do today,\" while still doubling down on providing \"real safeguards\" for teenage users. That said, corporate damage control aside, the company also said it's going to delay the global age verification rollout, and is going to make concrete changes to attempt to address user concerns.\n\nTo that end, Discord is making the following changes to its controversial global age verification rollout:\n\nGlobal age verification will now be delayed from March to the \"second half of 2026.\" Until that point, age verification will only remain active in areas where it is legally required, like the UK and Australia.\n\nOn launch, Discord will provide a list of every age verification vendor it works with and their practices.\n\nAll age verification partners will only offer facial scanning on-device.\n\nBefore global age verification launches, Discord will develop alternative age verification methods beyond scanning your face or providing an ID, like providing credit card information instead. However, such methods might not be legally allowed in certain area, like Australia, the UK, and Brazil.\n\nDiscord will add spoiler channels as an option for communities, so they don't need to use age-restricted channels to hide age appropriate, but still sensitive, content anymore. This will allow accounts that aren't able to age verify to access these channels.\n\nThe company will publish a technical blog once age verification launches going into detail on how its systems work, and will add age verification metrics, including how many users were asked to verify or which age verification methods they used, to ongoing transparency reports.\n\nEssentially, the idea is that if you're an adult Discord user (and you live in a region that allows it, which Discord says may not be everywhere), Discord will likely be able to use factors like your signup email, your account age, and your activity to guess your age. If so, you'll be automatically filtered into the correct age group and will be able to keep using the app as usual. Otherwise, you'll be labeled a teen, and will need to verify by either scanning your face, providing a government ID, or using one of Discord's new alternative methods. Or, you could keep using the app unverified, but you'll lose access to age-restricted channels and any content Discord thinks is inappropriate enough to block for you.\n\nTo that end, not much has changed about Discord's end goals, and the company did acknowledge that \"we know many of you believe the right answer is not to do this at all.\" However, Discord also said that its hand is being forced in regions including the UK, Australia, and Brazil, with \"Europe and multiple US states close behind.\" In scaling age verification globally, Discord says it wants to \"show regulators that it's possible to verify age without collecting identity,\" also stating that \"we don't want to know who you are. We just need to know whether you're an adult.\"\n\nTo be fair, that still seems to involve knowing who users are to some extent, as you'll still need to hand over some type of personal identifying information to verify, or rely on Discord's age prediction to collect information to estimate your age in the background. But as a show of good faith, Discord acknowledged its \"experiment\" with Persona, and that Persona's use of off-device facial scanning did not meet its bar for privacy.\n\nWhat happens next is unclear. Discord's made a lot of promises, but now it has to follow through on them. The company also didn't provide a strict deadline for its age verification rollout, so its possible it could continue to get pushed back in regions that don't legally require it. However, Discord is also up for for an IPO sometime this spring. Certainty and a happy consumer base will likely make investors happy, but that probably also means keeping regulators and concerned parents appeased. Continue to expect compromises, especially when Discord has already come under fire for exposing teens to sensitive material and adult conversations before.",

He batted at his destructive best.\n\nSurprise greeted the sight of Brook walking down the steps rather than Bethell after Salt nicked off to Shaheen but the thinking was smart.\n\nIt kept the right-hander away from Pakistan's five spinners on a turning pitch at the start of his innings and allowed him to take advantage of the powerplay fielding restrictions.\n\nBrook faced three dots in his first five balls but then took left-armer Salman Mirza for a four and six in the second over.\n\nHe muscled a brutal straight six over long-on off while hitting spinner Mohammad Nawaz for 17 in the sixth, before nudging singles after Banton nicked off to Usman Tariq. The mystery spinner was Pakistan's major threat.\n\nAt halfway, Brook kicked on again, crashing leg-spinner Shadab Khan for a perfect straight six. He scored all around the ground but those straight hits and his drives through the covers were particularly eye-catching.\n\nHe reached three figures with two more hits over mid-off - one for six and another a one-bounce four.\n\nIt made him the third man to score centuries in all three formats for England, after Jos Buttler and Dawid Malan, but more importantly it keeps them on course for a third T20 title.\n\nThe win means England qualify before their final Super 8 game against New Zealand on Friday. They can use that match to try and fine tune.\n\nButtler's form remains a major worry. One of England's all-time greats, who has scored 15 runs in his last five innings and got a bottom edge on a cut here, is struggling.\n\nBefore that, England's fielding, which had remained strong through the tight wins against Nepal, Scotland and Italy in the group stage and Sri Lanka on Sunday, faltered.\n\nBethell let two regulation stops through his hands on the boundary and Brook dropped Shadab on four before he made an important 23. There was also the careless moment of a no-ball for one too many fielders outside the 30-yard circle.\n\nSahibzada Farhan was Pakistan's highest scorer with 65 but he and Babar Azam batted too slowly in a partnership of 46 in 44 balls.\n\nLiam Dawson and Jamie Overton did well to restrict Pakistan in the second half of the innings. Left-arm spinner Dawson took three wickets and a fine high catch while Overton bowled Babar and had Farhan lbw, also taking an excellent diving catch of his own.\n\nThey ensured Pakistan did not kick on from their platform and, along with Brook, were the other major plusses for England.\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "fullText": "Every year, the football world shifts its attention to one of the most important checkpoints in the pre-draft calendar — the NFL Scouting Combine. Hosted in Indianapolis at Lucas Oil Stadium, the event marks the true beginning of draft season for front offices across the National Football League. It’s where film study meets measurable reality — where speed, explosiveness, strength, and movement skills are tested under a microscope. For prospects, it’s not just an evaluation; it’s a high-stakes job interview played out in front of coaches, executives, and scouts from every team.\n\nThis year’s spotlight centers on the players ranked at the top of Daniel Jeremiah’s latest top prospect board, a group loaded with elite athletic traits and immediate NFL potential. The list reflects the modern direction of the league — explosive edge defenders, versatile defensive backs, dynamic skill players, and quarterbacks capable of handling complex offensive systems. While game tape built their reputations, the combine will test how those traits translate in standardized drills and competitive environments. For some, it’s a chance to confirm elite status. For others, it’s an opportunity to rise dramatically with one standout performance.\n\nAs the drills begin and the testing numbers roll in, these top prospects enter the most revealing phase of their pre-draft journey. The combine won’t finalize their draft positions — but it will shape the conversation around them in a big way.\n\nMendoza carries himself like a true franchise quarterback, showing poise and command in high-pressure situations. His arm talent allows him to make layered throws with timing and precision, while his size helps him absorb contact and stay composed. He processes defenses quickly and rarely looks rushed mentally. Teams see a quarterback who can operate structure but still create when plays break down.\n\nLove is one of the most explosive offensive weapons in the class, capable of scoring from anywhere on the field. His acceleration through the hole and long-speed in open space make him a constant big-play threat. He runs with patience and vision, then flips a switch once he sees daylight. If his testing matches the tape, he’ll solidify elite playmaker status.\n\nBailey is a disruptive edge rusher with the power and burst to stress offensive tackles snap after snap. He plays with physical urgency, attacking the pocket and forcing quarterbacks off their spots. His length helps him control contact and win leverage battles at the line. Evaluators are especially intrigued by how much more upside he still has as his pass-rush toolbox develops.\n\nReese is an explosive athlete off the edge with range that shows up against both the run and pass. He closes space quickly and flashes the ability to wreck plays in the backfield. His pursuit motor stands out — he doesn’t quit on plays and consistently chases down ball carriers. With refinement, he has the traits of a high-impact defensive playmaker.\n\nStyles brings size, speed, and versatility that allow him to impact the game in multiple defensive roles. He moves fluidly in coverage but also plays with downhill force against the run. His physical profile makes him a matchup eraser against modern hybrid offenses. Coaches value defenders who can stay on the field in any situation — Styles fits that mold.\n\nBain is a relentless pass rusher who plays with power, urgency, and technical discipline. He consistently generates pressure by converting speed to strength and attacking leverage points. His intensity shows in how hard he plays every snap, especially in pursuit. He profiles as the type of defender offenses must account for in protection schemes.\n\nTate is a refined route runner who wins with timing, precision, and body control. He tracks the ball naturally and consistently positions himself to make difficult catches look routine. His game is built on reliability — quarterbacks can trust him to be exactly where he’s supposed to be. He projects as a dependable high-volume receiving target.\n\nDelane is a long, athletic corner with strong coverage instincts and physical press ability. He competes aggressively at the catch point and shows confidence challenging receivers downfield. His movement skills allow him to stay attached through routes and recover when needed. He has the traits teams look for in a boundary corner who can handle top matchups.\n\nDowns is a true playmaking safety with range, awareness, and sharp diagnostic skills. He reads offensive concepts quickly and arrives at the ball with decisive speed. Whether in coverage or run support, he consistently impacts plays with sound positioning. His instincts and football IQ make him one of the most complete defensive backs in the class.\n\nLemon is an electric playmaker whose acceleration and agility stand out immediately. He thrives after the catch, turning short receptions into explosive gains with quick cuts and burst. His ability to stretch the field vertically adds another dimension to his game. Offenses will value his versatility and big-play potential from multiple alignments.\n\nUltimately, this group represents the talent expected to define the early portion of the 2026 NFL Draft. The combine serves as both validation and opportunity — confirming what evaluators believe while opening the door for new storylines. From measurable dominance to unexpected breakout performances, this week helps transform top prospects into future professionals.\n\nOLYMPICS: Final 2026 Winter Olympics medal count, standings\n\nNFL: 4 blockbuster NFL trades we want to see before the 2026 draft\n\nNFL DRAFT: 2026 NFL Scouting Combine day-to-day TV schedule, how to watch\n\nMLB: MLB Power Rankings as 2026 Spring Training begins\n\nNBA: Updated NBA Power Rankings as a new week begins\n\nVIRAL: Watch Johnny Gaudreau’s children join Team USA hockey gold medal celebration\n\nThe post Top draft prospects ahead of the 2026 NFL scouting combine appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "description": "Package managers are legion. Every programming language and operating system has its own solution, each with subtly different semantics for dependency resolution. This fragmentation prevents multilingual projects from expressing precise dependencies across language ecosystems; it leaves external system and hardware dependencies implicit and unversioned; it obscures security vulnerabilities that lie in the full dependency graph. We present the \\textit{Package Calculus}, a formalism for dependency resolution that unifies the core semantics of diverse package managers. Through a series of formal reductions, we show how this core is expressive enough to model the diversity that real-world package managers employ in their dependency expression languages.",

    "fullText": "We explore the strange food-obsessed world of a new game whose tech was once called ‘an insult to life itself’ by Hayao Miyazaki, the film-maker behind Spirited Away\n\nA strange piece of software has recently landed on the PC gaming store Steam. And “software” feels like the cleanest way to describe it. Existing somewhere between a full-blown life sim, a science project and a kind of haunted fish tank, Anlife: Motion-learning Life Evolution probably would have disappeared without making much impact if it wasn’t for one unusual factor. Several years ago some of its creators were absolutely roasted on camera by one of the genuine legends of Japanese animation.\n\nBack in 2016, Hayao Miyazaki, the director of movies such as Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away, was shown new technology that used AI in order to animate models. Faced with a zombie that utilised its head to move by knocking its skull against the ground and wriggling its body like a fish, Miyazaki declared what he had seen was “an insult to life itself”. It’s hard not to watch the clip without feeling slightly seared – but now, a decade later, the ashen-faced developers from that room have sufficiently recovered to make their work widely available.\n\nJudging by the chatter surrounding the launch, at least some of the people downloading Anlife are doing so in the hope that it might provide some kind of indication of the current state video games’ relationship with AI. Putting aside the often broad use of that term, this is certainly a thing that’s worth trying to understand, whether it’s because of the job losses caused by AI or blamed on AI, or the sheer number of games made with the assistance of AI models now landing on storefronts such as Steam.\n\nThere’s a problem here, though. And it’s that Anlife itself is such a cheerfully inconsequential thing that it’s hard to read too much of anything into it.\n\nAnlife promises players an evolution simulator where “AI-driven block creatures move in unexpected ways.” What this comes down to for the most part involves placing a range of different creatures into a small environment and then watching as they learn to get around.\n\nVisually Anlife is pure Frutiger Aero, offering landscapes of green valleys and sparkling water that could be the kind of soothing images MRI technicians sometimes encourage you to look at during a lengthy scan. Sonically it’s equally inoffensive: with a range of bloops, bleeps and popping sounds, we’re pitched right into the soundtrack of a million 00s day spas.\n\nThis desire to soothe permeates to the level of mechanics, too. Over the course of an idle morning with Anlife you can place a range of simple creatures in the environment and then give them food that will encourage them to breed or mutate. You can expand your territory and then lure creatures towards water or up into the air in order to create more variations. There are plenty of things to unlock (including a shadow tech tree that has you covered if you want to annihilate your digital sea monkeys rather than watching them flourish) but the ecosystem is kept simple. It’s a game about watching how things decide to crawl towards food.\n\nThe thrill of all of this presumably comes down to the “how” in that last sentence. This is where the game’s slightly mysterious use of AI is probably involved. And it’s true that, after a few hours of play, you’ll have Anlife’s funny little blob creatures exploring new kinds of joints and body arrangements as they swim and fly and generally roll around eating.\n\n(AI has a history of being used to make creatures walk around, incidentally, often using small neural networks and computer evolution. In 2009, the UK-based games technology company NaturalMotion developed a project in which a bipedal model learned to walk using evolved neural networks. The company was subsequently bought by Zynga in 2014.\n\nThere are two problems, however, the first being that the focus on unlocking the skill tree gives the opening hours of Anlife the feel of a rather mindless clicker game that it struggles to shake off. The second comes down to something that I gather people studying procedural generation sometimes refer to as “the oatmeal problem”.\n\nThe oatmeal problem, which was first formulated by writer, developer and academic Kate Compton, hinges on the fact that every single bowl of oatmeal in the universe is unique. Just not in a very interesting way. Similarly, when Anlife’s creatures discover a new way of rolling or bouncing or flapping their bodies towards food, they’re still just moving towards food. It makes for a game that’s either about really, really paying attention to tiny variations in detailing, or about completely zoning out and just enjoying the floaty aesthetic. Over the course of my time with Anlife, I’ve generally started with the first approach and then discovered, after 10 minutes, that I’ve slid into the second.\n\nThe more I played Anlife, the more I ended up thinking about something I heard from one of the first AI researchers I ever spoke to, all the way back in 2013. The real value of AI, they explained – and I am paraphrasing here – is that it could one day become a completely alien form of intelligence. Which means that us humans would have the lens of a different kind of mind through which to see ourselves and our quirks and cognitive fallacies – things that can be hard to spot when you’re talking to people who think in a very similar way to you.\n\nSince then the apparent focus for a lot of companies such as OpenAI seems to be completely the opposite: creating mimetic plagiarism machines that sometimes seem to exist only to tell people what they already want to hear.\n\nIt feels as if Anlife is filling a very small and specific niche. It isn’t trying to disguise its AI use, as far as I am aware. It’s actually trying to draw attention to the way it uses AI to allow its little creatures to move around. It’s not just a game born of AI, in other words. It’s a game that in some small way is actually about AI. It wants to be slightly alien. It doesn’t want to hide itself or ingratiate; it wants to examine AI’s innate capacity for otherness.",

    "description": "A former legal counsel for TikTok quit her job in 2023 to travel the world on a motorbike, seeking adventure and personal growth with her partner.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on an interview with Nerine Mak, a 33-year-old former senior commercial counsel for TikTok who's traveling the world on a motorbike. It has been edited for length and clarity\n\nI'm the eldest of five children. Our house was full of sibling squabbles, lots of negotiation, and mediation, which is probably why I joined the school debating team. A legal degree was a natural progression.\n\nI moved to Australia for college, then returned to Singapore, where I began working as a legal counsel at Ernst & Young in April 2017.\n\nEighteen months later, I became the regional legal counsel for Sephora. I'd only been there for nine months when, in July 2019, a TikTok recruiter approached me.\n\nI stayed at TikTok until I turned 30, when I quit to travel the world on a motorbike.\n\nI decided to go and meet them for interview practice. I knew TikTok was a social media app, but that was about it. When I found out that ByteDance was a major tech company with educational and B2B products, as well as TikTok, I was seriously impressed.\n\nI interviewed for a legal counsel role that'd support the revenue-generating business in Southeast Asia and Oceania. Within 48 hours, the recruiter called me to say I'd passed the first interview, and my second interview would be the next day.\n\nI started taking the process very seriously.\n\nMy first interview was with the hiring manager, then I was interviewed by three people from different business units, and finally, my last interview was with an HR member.\n\nI was still learning a lot at Sephora and wasn't ready to leave, but the opportunity at TikTok was just so appealing.\n\nWhen I told my parents I was going to work for TikTok, my dad didn't really have that much confidence in the company. Initially, I was nervous about the idea of joining, too, because when I asked about my specific job scope, it was still rather unknown.\n\nI received a welcome pack with backpacks, laptop bags, stickers, and stationery.\n\nAt the time, we were working in a coworking space. In my previous roles at Sephora and EY, we collaborated, but at TikTok, the collabs were more dynamic, frequent, and face-to-face.\n\nMy day-to-day involved more meetings, whereas in my earlier roles, independent work carried greater weight.\n\nEach day, I'd have meetings from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., then I'd still have up to three hours of work left before I finished for the day.\n\nThe most challenging year I had was 2021. One of my projects was to launch the TikTok Shop in Indonesia. It was the first to launch globally, so countries like the UK and the US saw my project as the blueprint.\n\nI burned out at least three times that year. Of course, it was very rewarding once launched and turned out to be very successful. My team grew to 10 lawyers, and we'd have weekly catch-ups on ByteDance's all-in-one platform, Lark.\n\nAt 23, I told myself I'd leave my job by 30 to pursue my own growth and discovery. I knew that traveling the world would give me the kind of life lessons my job couldn't give.\n\nAfter 18 months, I started playing around with the idea of van life. In March 2021, a friend referred me to a mechanic, Haren, whom he knew and who could share some car maintenance tips.\n\nHaren and I started dating and decided to travel together. Within three months, I decided to swap the van for a motorbike, and we agreed to leave our jobs and ride off-road bikes from Singapore to Europe.\n\nI left in November 2023. At first, they tried to talk me out of leaving, but I was transparent about my dream of exploring the world. We made sure we had a solid budget, so we didn't have to worry while traveling.\n\nTwo months before we were about to leave, my father said, \"I've bought a bike and Mummy and I are coming too.\" They decided to ride from Singapore to Germany and meet us on the way.\n\nHaren and I set off on January 20, 2024, at 5:30 a.m. I couldn't sleep the night before. When I woke up, my family prepared a farewell party, and our friends arrived on bikes to ride with us to the border.\n\nMy parents joined us on May 5, 2024, on the border of Laos and China. We traveled through China together and then met up again in Poland to travel through the Baltics before we rode to Norway. They're now back in Singapore.\n\nWe've now ridden off-road from Singapore through China and across Afghanistan.\n\nMy day involves leaving the guest house by 11 a.m., riding for two hours, and going sightseeing during our lunch hour. We usually stop riding just before sunset.\n\nWe try not to be rigid with our plans because a lot of the joy and surprises we get come from interacting with locals. They'll invite us into their homes for dinner or to their farms to ride on their horses.\n\nIt was a very promising role, but I knew I had to do this for myself. One of the biggest lessons I've learned is to be optimistic. Your closest people might have doubts about your plans, but you have to follow your heart.\n\nI've been taking on ad hoc legal work for friends who have small businesses. We plan to travel through February, then park our bikes for the next eight months due to family commitments. I'm also thinking of taking this opportunity to get either full-time or part-time legal work.\n\nI would still like to grow my legal skills. That would be a way to bring in income to fund future journeys as well. The freedom I get on two wheels is my passion and will stick with me for the rest of my life.",

    "description": "There is no GPS at the Red Planet, but a new technology called Mars Global Localization lets Perseverance determine precisely where it is — without human",
    "fullText": "There is no GPS at the Red Planet, but a new technology called Mars Global Localization lets Perseverance determine precisely where it is — without human help.\n\nImagine you’re all alone, driving along in a rocky, unforgiving desert with no roads, no map, no GPS, and no more than one phone call a day for someone to inform you exactly where you are. That’s what NASA’s Perseverance rover has been experiencing since landing on Mars five years ago. Though it carries time-tested tools for determining its general location, the rover has needed operators on Earth to tell it precisely where it is — until now.\n\nA new technology developed at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California enables Perseverance to figure out its whereabouts without calling humans for help. Dubbed Mars Global Localization, the technology features an algorithm that rapidly compares panoramic images from the rover’s navigation cameras with onboard orbital terrain maps. Running on a powerful processor that Perseverance originally used to communicate with the Ingenuity Mars Helicopter, the algorithm takes about two minutes to pinpoint the rover’s location within some 10 inches (25 centimeters). Mars Global Localization was first used successfully in regular mission operations on Feb. 2, then again Feb. 16.\n\n“This is kind of like giving the rover GPS. Now it can determine its own location on Mars,” said JPL’s Vandi Verma, chief engineer of robotics operations for the mission. “It means the rover will be able to drive for much longer distances autonomously, so we’ll explore more of the planet and get more science. And it could be used by almost any other rover traveling fast and far.”\n\nThe upgrade is especially valuable given how well Perseverance’s auto-navigation self-driving system has been working. Enabling the rover to re-plan its path around obstacles en route to a preestablished destination, AutoNav has proved so capable that the distance Perseverance can drive without instructions from Earth is largely limited by the rover’s uncertainty about its whereabouts. Now that it can stop and determine its exact location, Perseverance can be commanded to drive to potentially unlimited distances without calling home.  Implementation of Mars Global Localization comes on the heels of another innovation from the Perseverance team: the first use of generative artificial intelligence to help plan a drive route by selecting waypoints for the rover, which are normally chosen by human rover operators. Both technologies enable Perseverance to travel farther and faster while minimizing team workload.\n\nUnlike on Earth, there is no network of GPS satellites in deep space to locate spacecraft on planetary surfaces. So missions — whether robotic or crewed — must come up with other ways to determine their location.\n\nAs with NASA’s previous Mars rovers, Perseverance tracks its position using what’s called visual odometry, analyzing geologic features in camera images taken every few feet while accounting for wheel slippage. But as tiny errors in the process add up over the course of each drive, the rover becomes increasingly unsure about its exact location. On long drives, the rover’s sense of its position can be off by more than 100 feet (up to 35 meters). Believing it may be too close to hazardous terrain, Perseverance may prematurely end its drive and wait for instructions from Earth.\n\n“Humans have to tell it, ‘You’re not lost, you’re safe. Keep going,’” Verma said. “We knew if we addressed this problem, the rover could travel much farther every day.”\n\nAfter each drive comes to a halt, the rover sends a 360-degree panorama to Earth, where mapping experts match the imagery with shots from NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO). The team then sends the rover its location and instructions for its next drive. That process can take a day or more, but with Mars Global Localization, the rover is able to compare the images itself, determine its location, and roll ahead on its preplanned route.\n\n“We’ve given the rover a new ability,” said Jeremy Nash, a JPL robotics engineer who led the team working on the project under Verma. “This has been an open problem in robotics research for decades, and it’s been super exciting to deploy this solution in space for the first time.”\n\nThe small team began working in 2023, testing the accuracy of the algorithm they’d developed using data from 264 previous rover stops. The algorithm compared rover panoramic photos to MRO imagery and correctly pinpointed the rover’s location for every single stop.\n\nKey to Mars Global Localization is the rover’s Helicopter Base Station (HBS), which Perseverance used to communicate with the now-retired Ingenuity Mars Helicopter. Equipped with a commercial processor that powered many consumer smartphones in the mid-2010s, the HBS runs more than 100 times faster than the rover’s two main computers, which, built to survive the radiation-heavy Martian environment, are based on hardware introduced in 1997.\n\nAs a technology demonstration designed to test capabilities, the Ingenuity mission was able to risk employing more powerful commercial chips in the HBS and the helicopter even though they hadn’t been proven in space. It paid off: Expected to fly no more than five times, the rotorcraft completed 72 flights.\n\nThe power of the HBS processor inspired Verma to look for ways the Perseverance mission might harness it. “It’s almost like a gift. Ingenuity blazed the trail, proving we could use commercial processors on Mars,” Verma said.\n\nTapping into the HBS computer has had its challenges. To address reliability, the team developed a “sanity check”: The algorithm runs on the HBS multiple times before one of the rover’s main computers checks to ensure the results match. During testing, the team repeatedly found the rover’s position was off by 1 millimeter. They discovered damage to about 25 bits — a minuscule fraction of the processor’s 1 gigabyte of memory — and developed a solution to isolate those bits while the algorithm runs.\n\nAlongside the broader Mars Global Localization process, the team’s sanity check and memory solutions are expected to find new uses as faster commercial processors are employed in future missions. In the meantime, the team has already turned their sights to the Moon, where difficult lighting conditions and long, cold lunar nights make knowing exactly where spacecraft are located all the more critical.\n\nNASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which is managed for the agency by Caltech, built and manages operations of the Perseverance rover on behalf of NASA’s Science Mission Directorate in Washington, as part of NASA’s Mars Exploration Program portfolio.\n\nTo learn more about Perseverance:\n\nhttps://science.nasa.gov/mission/mars-2020-perseverance\n\nMelissa Pamer / DC Agle \nJet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.\n626-314-4928 / 818-393-9011\nmelissa.pamer@jpl.nasa.gov / agle@jpl.nasa.gov\n\nKaren Fox / Molly Wasser\nNASA Headquarters, Washington\n202-358-1600\nkaren.c.fox@nasa.gov / molly.l.wasser@nasa.gov",

    "fullText": "Life is complicated. Regardless of what your beliefs or politics or ethics are, the way that we set up our society and economy will often force you to act against them: You might not want to fly somewhere but your employer will not accept another mode of transportation, you want to eat vegan but are at some point in a situation where the best you can do is a vegetarian option.\n\nSometimes it’s not even our hand being forced but us not having the mental strength or priorities to do something: I could just not use WhatsApp because it is owned by Meta but my son’s daycare organizes everything through WhatsApp and do I really want to force my belief on all those very busy parents and caretakers or should I just bite the bullet and use the tool that seems to work for everyone – even though it’s not perfect?\n\nThere are no one-size-fits-all solutions for this: Sometimes a belief or ethic you hold is so integral to you that you will not move. Sometimes they are held loosely enough to let go under certain conditions. There’s a multitude of factors and thoughts that go into those kinds of decisions and at some point you just gotta make a call based on what’s in front of you and your priorities.\n\nWhat I am saying is: We are all doing things we know are not ideal, are either morally questionable or do not align with our values. That’s life. I for example know that consuming meat is problematic for ethical and ecological reasons, I still do it sometimes. I reduce as much as I can but I am far from perfect. Just one of the many examples of my actions not being perfectly and purely aligned with my beliefs.\n\nAnd I am 100% sure each and every reader will have similar experiences. We are imperfect and messy beings. In the end all you can do is actually try to make good decisions based on your values, try to learn from your actions and ideally do better – or at least understand what were the forces that go you to act against your values.\n\nCory Doctorow, probably one of the most influential writers about digital technology and culture celebrated the 6th anniversary of his personal blog pluralistic – congratulations! Cory is quite the phenomenon, I know nobody with his amount of output and his consistency of publication. It is scary just how consistently he writes and published while also churning out books. I do admire his work ethic tremendously.\n\nBut one thing in his celebratory post rubbed me the wrong way and I think it’s worth pointing out. Not for the one specific case but because it highlights a problematic way of thinking that I see a lot in current tech discourse that stands in the way of us actually improving the world.\n\nSo Cory outlines his process of how he publishes to his blog (and then pushes the same writing out to other places). He describes how one QA step in his process is piping his writing through an LLM (using the Ollama software, it’s unclear which open weight LLM he uses) to check for typos and small grammar mistakes. He then points out how some readers might find that problematic:\n\n“Doubtless some of you are affronted by my modest use of an LLM. You think that LLMs are “fruits of the poisoned tree” and must be eschewed because they are saturated with the sin of their origins. I think this is a very bad take, the kind of rathole that purity culture always ends up in.”\n\nUsing LLMs isn’t always popular with the cool crowd, Cory knows that. And he wants to defend his (quite modest) use, which I understand: Nobody likes their problematic behavior being pointed out to them. But as outlined: Life’s complicated. Cory could just have said “I know there are many critiques of LLMs, but right now that is the best way for me to enable my work, I try to limit the problematic aspects by using a small open weight model and checking the results in detail.” and have moved on. But he needed to make a stand. And that stand lead him into the problematic train of thought that I wanted to point out here. Because many, many people listen to him and basically take his word as the gospel. So great power, great responsibility and such.\n\nThe whole argument is based on a strawman. Let’s look at Cory’s words:\n\nLet’s start with some context. If you don’t want to use technology that was created under immoral circumstances or that sprang from an immoral mind, then you are totally fucked. I mean, all the way down to the silicon chips in your device, which can never be fully disentangled from the odious, paranoid racist William Shockley, who won the Nobel Prize for co-inventing the silicon transistor\n\nCory is right in pointing out that almost any technology we have has been touch by problematic figures. Racists, fascists, sexists, rapists. You name it. Anything you touch will have some research or engineering or product work by a person you despise in it.\n\nThe strawman is his claim that people who criticize LLM usage are doing that for some form of absolutist reasons. That they have a fully binary view of the world as separated into “acceptable, pure things” and “garbage”. Which is of course false. Because they are using a computer, using warm water that’s probably heated through the use of fossil fuels etc.\n\nHe attacks a ridiculous made-up figure to deflect from specific criticism of LLM use (that many probably wouldn’t even apply that strongly to his use case). But that’s not where criticism of LLMs comes from: It’s mostly specific focusing on the material properties of these systems, their production and use.\n\n“Refusing to use a technology because the people who developed it were indefensible creeps is a self-owning dead-end. You know what’s better than refusing to use a technology because you hate its creators? Seizing that technology and making it your own. Don’t like the fact that a convicted monopolist has a death-grip on networking? Steal its protocol, release a free software version of it, and leave it in your dust:”\n\nHere again Cory is misrepresenting the LLM-critic’s argument: Sam Altman is a scam artist and habitual liar, but that’s not one of the first 10 to 20 reasons people criticise OpenAI’s products. Sure, basically every leading figure in the “AI” space seems to be unpleasant at best but that’s true for most of tech TBH. People criticise LLMs for their structural properties, their material impacts, for the way they make it harder to learn and grow, for the way they make products worse while creating massive negative externalities in the form of emissions, water use and e-waste. For the way these systems can only be build by taking every piece of data – regardless of whether the authors consent or even explicitly refuse – and how the training needs ungodly amounts of harmful, exploitative labor done mostly by people in countries from the global majority. How it materially harms the commons.\n\nEven if OpenAI was run by decent, ethical, friendly, trustworthy people (which would then of course make them not work on the products OpenAI has, but it’s just a thought experiment) their products would need to be criticized for what they are and what they do. It’s really not about these few dudes running the companies.\n\nCory misrepresents the arguments (well basically hides them) in order to not have to face any material criticism and turns them into “you just don’t like these people” which frames the criticism as emotional and not rational. As if it was about not liking a bunch of rich men.\n\nHe then goes into how the path forward is to “steal the protocol”. His following paragraph goes into detail:\n\n“That’s how we make good tech: not by insisting that all its inputs be free from sin, but by purging that wickedness by liberating the technology from its monstrous forebears and making free and open versions of it”\n\nAnd here we are coming to the core of the problematic argument. Because Cory implicitly argues that technology is neutral and that one can just change its meaning and effect through usage. But as Langdon Winner argues in his famous essay “Do artifacts have politics” artifacts have built-in politics deriving from their structure. A famous example is the nuclear power plant: Due to the danger of these plants, their needs with regards to resources as well as security, power plants imply a certain form of political arrangement based on having a strong security force/army and a way to force these facilities (and facilities to store the waste in) upon communities potentially against their will.\n\nArtifacts and technologies have certain logics built into their structure that do require certain arrangements around them or that bring forward certain arrangements. The second aspect is often illustrated by how ships are organized: Because ships are sometimes in dangerous situations and sometimes critical decisions need to be made, the existence of ships implies the existence of a hierarchy of power relationships with a captain having the final say. Because democracy would be too slow at times. These politics are built into the artifact.\n\nUnderstanding this you cannot take any technology and “make it good”. Is a torturing device “good” if the plans on how to build it are creative commons? Do we need to answer the existence of the digital torment nexus by building an open source torment nexus? I’d argue we need to destroy it – regardless of what license it is released under.\n\nThat does not mean that it is impossible to take certain technologies or artifacts and try to reframe them, change their meaning. In some way computers are one such example: They were first used by governments, banks and other corporations to reach their goals but where then taken and reframed as devices intended to support personal liberation. It’s a bit more complicated (for why, dive into the late David Golumbia’s “The Cultural Logic of Computation”) but let’s give that one to Cory. Sure, sometimes it is possible to take something originally built for nefarious purposes and find better uses for it. But is that true for everything? Very obviously not.\n\nLet’s just look at the embedded politics of LLMs: In order to train a capable system you need data. Lots of it. AI companies keep buying books to scan them, they download everything from every legal or illegal source claiming “fair use” (a doctrine that only applies to the US by the way) or that “scraping is always okay”. Capable LLMs require a logic of dominance and of disregarding consent of the people producing the artifacts that are the raw material for the system. LLMs are based on extraction, exploitation and subjugation: To produce these systems – even if you release the end result as open weights for people to use at home – you need to take cultural works, personal writing etc. from people who not only not consented but actively reject that notion. The politics of LLMs is violence. How does one “liberate” that? What’s the case for open source violence?\n\nHe uses a so-called “open source LLM” and that’s very much how he presents his values but open-source LLMs do not really exist. You can download some weights but cannot understand what went into them or really change or reproduce them. Open source AI is just marketing and openwashing.\n\nCory shows his libertarian leanings here: If everything is somehow “free and open” then we have won. But “free and open” in this context usually means that “certain privileged groups have easy access to it and are not limited in what to do with it”. That’s one of the core problems with the whole “open Source” movement: That it reduces all struggle to if one can get their hands on the tools and has any restrictions to using them.\n\nThis also shines through in Cory arguing that we need to “liberate” technology. What a strange idea: Technology doesn’t need liberation, people do. Technologies are tools, not what we actually care about. Sure, sometimes technologies can play a role in liberating people but just as often “freeing” a technology does quite the opposite to people: Ask the women who have massive amounts of nonconsensually created sexualized images and videos generated of them whether they think that the “liberation” of stochastic images generators is liberating them? Technology doesn’t need to be free. It cannot be free because freedom as a concept applies to people.\n\nAnd freedom is not the only value that we care about. Making everything “free” sounds cool but who pays for that freedom? Who pays for us having for example access to the freedom an open weight LLM brings? Our freedom as users rests on the exploitation of and violence against the people suffering the data centers, labeling the data for the training, the folks gathering the resources for NVIDIA to build chips. Freedom is not a zero-sum game but a lot of the freedoms that wealthy people in the right (which I am one of) enjoy stem from other people’s lack thereof.\n\n“Purity culture is such an obvious trap, an artifact of the neoliberal ideology that insists that the solution to all our problems is to shop very carefully, thus reducing all politics to personal consumption choices:”\n\nCory labels people’s values and their prioritization as “purity culture” (referring back to the black and white strawman the started this part of his post with) and then pulls a really interesting spin here: Many people criticizing LLMs come from a somewhat leftist (in contrast to Cory’s libertarian) background. Cory intentionally frames those leftist thoughts that put politics based on values as “neoliberal ideology” that reduces “all politics to personal consumption choices”. This is clever narratively: Tell those stupid leftists that they are just neoliberals, the thing they hate! Awesome.\n\nBut the argument against using LLMs is not about shopping and markets at all. My not using LLMs does not influence anything in that regard, Microsoft will just keep making the data center go BRRRRRRR.\n\nIn a way this framing shows more about Cory’s thinking than about that of the people he criticises: Cory is focused on markets and market dynamics and in that world it’s about purchasing. But moral choices only sometimes relate to markets. They do when I for example choose only to buy fairly produced garments. But when I for example refused conscription (when I was young Germany still forced every young man to learn how to kill) that was not a shopping decision. That was politics as well as leading an ethical life.\n\nPeople do not believe that “not using LLMs” will solve the issue of OpenAI etc all existing. They do no want to build on, use products with so clearly defined harms and negative externalities. Because they believe it to be wrong. Sure, there might be a utilitarian argument for “the thing exists anyways and if it saves you time, that’s good, right” but many people are not utilitarians. They want to lead a life where they feel their actions align with their values. In a way that is a path to freedom: To having the freedom to make the decisions one feels are right are in alignment with one’s values.\n\nWhich Cory actually also believe and acts upon when it’s about his values: He has refused to create a Bluesky account in spite of wanting to be there cause his friends are there for (good!) ideological reasons: Because Bluesky was back then and honestly is still today mostly centralized with the Bluesky corporation having a central chokepoint to control the network. Cory believes that one sometimes needs to make decisions based on one’s values. He just does not think that your values as someone not wanting to use LLMs matter.\n\nI mean, it was extraordinarily stupid for the Nazis to refuse Einstein’s work because it was “Jewish science,” but not merely because antisemitism is stupid.\n\nEverybody hates Nazis. Implying that one is in any way like the Nazis is just a killer argument. But let’s talk about Nazis for a second. The Nazis did a lot of psychological and medical research. On people they interned and later killed in concentration camps. There actually was a massive debate within especially psychology whether using the results of that kind of research is ethically possible. Utilitarianism of course argues that if it’s there one should use it but especially when your whole discipline is focused on understanding how our psyche works in order to for example help people in trauma just taking research that has been created through unthinkable violence and torture feels wrong. Feels contrarian to what your whole discipline is there for. This reminds me of Ursula K. Le Guin’s story “The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas“: Omelas is an almost perfect city. Rich, democratic, pleasant. But it only works by having one small child in perpetual torment. Okay, but if that kid is already suffering because those other people chose to, should you walk away? Of just reap the fruits of that suffering?\n\nSometimes you need to walk away.\n\nCory then repeats the strawmen we already talked about and lands here:\n\n“It’s not “unethical” to scrape the web in order to create and analyze data-sets. That’s just “a search engine””\n\nAgain, he twists the argument in the way that the AI corporations like to do it as well: Search engines scour the web so AI companies should be allowed the same. It’s the same technology! But what’s the purpose?\n\nA search engine scrapes pages to build an “index” in order to let people find those pages. The scraping has value for the page and its owner as well because it leads to more people finding it and therefore connecting to the writer, journalist, musician, artist, etc. Search engines create connection.\n\nAI scrapers do not guide people towards the original maker’s work. They extract it and reproduce it (often wrongly). “AI”‘s don’t point out to the web for you to find other’s work to relate to, they keep you in their loop and give you the answer cutting off any connection to the original sources.\n\nWhile the technology of scraping is the same, the purpose and material effects of those two systems is massively different. Again, Cory misrepresents the critique and tries to make it look unreasonable by making it just a conversation about tech without regarding how that technology affects the world and the people in it.\n\nI appreciate a lot of work Cory Doctorow has done in the last decades. But the arguments he presents here to defend his usage of LLMs for this rather trivial task (which TBH could probably be done reasonably well with traditional means) are part of why the Internet – and therefore the world – looks like it does right now. It’s a set of arguments that wants to delegitimize political and moral actions based on libertarian and utilitarian thinking.\n\nTechnologies are embedded not only in their deployment but also in their creation, conceptualization. They carry the understanding of the world that their makers believe in and reproduce those. A bit like an LLM reproduces the texts it learned from: It might not always be a 100% identical replica but it’s structurally so similar that the differences are surface level.\n\nIn order to build an Internet and a world that is more inclusive, fairer, freer we need to move past the dogma of unchecked innovation and technology. We need to re-politicize our conversations about technology and their effects and goals in order to build the structures (technological, political, social) we want. The structures that lead to a conviviality in harmony with the planet we all live on and will live on till the end of our days.\n\nThat path is paved with discussions about political and moral values. Discussions about how certain technological artifacts do align with those values or not.\n\nI do agree with Cory that demanding perfect purity lead nowhere. We are imperfect people in an imperfect world. I just do not think that this means to go all accellerationalist. Just turning the “open source” dial up to 11 does not stop the apocalypse. It’s a lot harder.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.",

    "description": ": Watchdogs warn models that can generate realistic images of people must comply with data protection laws",
    "fullText": "A global coalition of privacy watchdogs has fired a warning shot at the generative AI industry, saying companies churning out realistic synthetic images can't pretend that data protection rules don't apply.\n\nThe joint statement [PDF] signed by more than 60 regulators, including the UK Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) and Ireland's Data Protection Commission (DPC), boils down to a simple point: if your model can convincingly fake a person, you don't get to pretend data protection law doesn't exist.\n\n\"Recent developments – particularly AI image and video generation integrated into widely accessible social media platforms – have enabled the creation of non-consensual intimate imagery, defamatory depictions, and other harmful content featuring real individuals,\" said the signatories. \"We are especially concerned about potential harms to children and other vulnerable groups, such as cyberbullying and/or exploitation.\"\n\nThe warning lands weeks after the ICO and DPC opened formal probes into Elon Musk's xAI following reports that its Grok chatbot produced sexual images of real people without their consent.\n\nThe group says organizations dabbling in generative AI need to build safeguards from the start and think carefully about risks such as non-consensual imagery, misuse of someone's likeness, and potential harms to children – all areas where the tech has raced ahead of social norms and, in some cases, common sense.\n\nThe regulators stress that the law already covers this, and that firms don't get a free pass just because the content came from a machine.\n\nWilliam Malcolm, executive director of Regulatory Risk & Innovation at the ICO, said: \"People should be able to benefit from AI without fearing that their identity, dignity or safety are under threat. AI already plays a large role in all our lives, and everybody has a right to expect that AI systems handling their personal data will do so with respect. Responsible innovation means putting people first: anticipating the risks and building in meaningful safeguards to ensure autonomy, transparency, and control.\n\n\"Public trust is foundational to the successful adoption and use of AI. Joint regulatory initiatives like this show global commitment to high standards of data protection in AI systems and help provide regulatory certainty. We expect those developing and deploying AI to act responsibly. Where we find that obligations have not been met, we will take action to protect the public.\"\n\nThe joint statement on AI-generated imagery suggests that if companies want to keep pushing ever more realistic AI into everyday products, they should expect regulators to keep asking awkward questions about how it all works. ®",

    "fullText": "Russia’s invasion of Ukraine four years ago launched Europe’s biggest conflict since World War II, causing immense suffering for civilians and harrowing ordeals for soldiers while rewriting the post-Cold War security order.\n\nThe fighting enters its fifth year on Tuesday, and it shows no signs of stopping anytime soon.\n\nThe U.S. has brokered talks with delegations from Moscow and Kyiv as part of the Trump administration's yearlong push for peace. But reconciling key differences, such as the future of Russian-occupied Ukrainian land and postwar security for Ukraine, has thwarted progress.\n\nMeanwhile, thousands of each countries’ troops have died on the battlefield, and Ukrainian civilians have been battered by Russian aerial strikes that have brought years of power outages and water cuts.\n\nHere’s a look at the conflict, by the numbers, since the full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022.\n\nThe upper end of the estimated number of soldiers killed, wounded or missing on both sides, according to a report last month by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a think tank.\n\nIt estimated that Russia suffered 1.2 million casualties, including up to 325,000 troop deaths, between February 2022 and December 2025 — what it said was the largest number of troop deaths for any major power in any conflict since World War II.\n\nRussia has not released figures on battlefield deaths since January 2023, when it said more than 80 soldiers were killed in a Ukrainian strike, bringing the total military deaths Moscow has confirmed to just over 6,000.\n\nCSIS estimated that Ukraine has seen 500,000 to 600,000 military casualties, including up to 140,000 deaths.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said earlier this month that 55,000 Ukrainian troops have died in the war. Many are missing, he said.\n\nNeither Moscow nor Kyiv gives timely data on military losses. Independent verification is not possible.\n\nThe U.N. Human Rights Monitoring Mission’s count for civilian deaths in Ukraine since Russia’s all-out invasion, though it says that is likely an underestimate. More than 40,600 civilians were injured over the same period, it said in a December report.\n\nThe war has killed at least 763 children, according to the U.N.\n\nLast year was the deadliest for civilians in Ukraine since 2022. The conflict killed 2,514 civilians and injured 12,142 in the country in 2025 — a 31% increase in civilian casualties over 2024, it said.\n\nThe percentage of Ukrainian land occupied by Russia, according to the Institute for the Study of War.\n\nOver the past year, Russia has gained just 0.79% of Ukraine’s territory in the grinding war of attrition, the Washington-based think tank said in calculations provided earlier this month to The Associated Press, underscoring the little progress Moscow's forces have made despite huge costs in troops and armor.\n\nBefore Russia’s all-out invasion, it controlled nearly 7% of Ukraine, including Crimea and parts of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in the east, as Moscow-backed separatists fought the Ukrainian army, according to Ukrainian officials and Western analysts.\n\nThe percentage drop in foreign military aid to Kyiv last year compared with the annual average between 2022 and 2024, according to Germany’s Kiel Institute, which tracks assistance to Kyiv.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump stopped sending American weapons paid for by the U.S. to Ukraine after he took office just over a year ago. European countries, striving to make up the difference, increased their military aid last year by 67% compared with the 2022-2024 period, the institute said in a report this month.\n\nForeign humanitarian and financial aid to Ukraine fell by 5% last year in comparison with the average in the previous three years, it said.\n\nThe number of Ukrainian civilians who have left their country.\n\nSome 5.3 million of those people have found refuge in Europe, according to a report this month from the U.N. office in Ukraine.\n\nAdditionally, around 3.7 million Ukrainians forced out of their homes have moved elsewhere within the country, the U.N. said in December.\n\nUkraine's prewar population was more than 40 million.\n\nThe number of Russian attacks that affected the provision of medical care in Ukraine since the full-scale invasion, according to a report from the World Health Organization on Monday.\n\nThere was a nearly 20% increase in such attacks last year compared with 2024, the U.N. agency said.\n\nA report earlier in the month from the WHO documented at least 2,347 strikes on health care facilities, in addition to others that damaged vehicles and the storage of medical supplies.\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

    "fullText": "Are aliens real? The question has animated conspiracy theories for decades and enthralled at least one former president of the United States. In a recent interview, Barack Obama became the first American president to affirm a belief in the existence of extraterrestrial life, but insisted that it was not being stored inside the top-secret Area 51 military base in Nevada.\n\nFor Bill Diamond, the president and chief executive of the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence Institute (Seti) in California, Obama’s beliefs are hardly radical. Seti is the world’s leading research organisation dedicated to the scientific search for life beyond our planet – and Diamond insists that aliens are out there.\n\n“Oh yes,” says the 69-year-old scientist. “I do believe aliens are real. Definitely… It is one of the questions we ask if you want to get a job at Seti. If you don’t believe in aliens, there’s probably no point having a job with us.” Diamond’s job involves overseeing teams of scientists working on various projects and sifting through torrents of data from radio telescopes, searching for patterns that nature alone cannot explain.\n\nDiamond is careful, though, to draw distinctions in what he means by aliens. He is not talking about flying saucers and abductions. “Life is probably very common in the universe,” he says. “It’s when you start talking about complex organisms, intelligence and then, ultimately, technology that it becomes a different matter.\n\n“The conditions that would allow for [aliens] to exist, which are mostly time and evolution, are probably not going to be as common as the conditions that allow just basic cellular life to emerge. But statistically speaking, there will be many examples of intelligent and ultimately technological life on other worlds.”\n\nSo if they do exist, what will they look like? Public imagination of aliens in film and fiction are of little men flying through our skies in spaceships and etching elaborate patterns into wheat fields. Diamond smiles at the cliché. Reality, he believes, is both less theatrical and far harder to picture.\n\n“It’s very hard for us to imagine what aliens would be like,” he says, but points to the biodiversity of our own planet which may offer clues. Aliens may even be similar to creatures like jellyfish, he suggests. “We have jellyfish that, from my point of view, are pretty extraordinary looking, a bit like aliens – and various sea creatures and birds and reptiles and mammals and so forth.” On Earth alone, evolution has produced creatures that seem almost otherworldly. Octopuses with nervous systems that extend into their arms, whales capable of complex communication. If such diversity exists under one sky, perhaps it’s not so difficult to imagine stranger things still under another.\n\nThe same physical laws apply everywhere, Diamond notes. Gravity, chemistry and energy behave the same way across the known universe. This does not mean that aliens would look human but it does mean that they would be shaped by similar constraints. “They will obviously be shaped by their environment. A bigger planet than Earth is going to have a stronger gravitational field that’s going to require an organism that is capable of withstanding that gravitational pull so likely to be a more robust physical species. A planet slightly smaller would have a lower gravitational field that might allow for more spindly, less structurally solid beings.”\n\nSo if aliens do exist, how would they get in touch? Diamond is clear about what he does not expect. “I think crop circles are rather unlikely,” he says. “If you’re an advanced civilisation, and you are able to be here in some capacity, having a presence or impact on our planet and you wanted to get our attention or have the technology to visit Earth in some direct or impactful way, you have technology far beyond our ability to imagine.”\n\nSuch a civilisation would not stumble upon us. It would already know we were here. It would have studied our atmosphere, our radio signals. It would understand our level of technology and, almost certainly, our languages, Diamond says.\n\nInstead, he believes that contact is far more likely to come as a signal. “First contact is most certainly going to be an observation of a phenomena that nature doesn’t produce, that we can say that’s technology,” he says. “Certainly, if an advanced civilisation wanted to get in touch or contact us, radio transmission would be one of the most efficient and effective ways.”\n\nHowever, he jokes that even if aliens could contact us, they might not want to. “There is a joke amongst some researchers,” he says. “When alien spacecraft fly by the Earth, they lock the doors.”\n\nAt Seti, Diamond describes three ways that scientists search for life. The first is “in situ” exploration, sending instruments directly to a place of interest. Nasa’s Perseverance rover is currently exploring Mars to determine whether life exists or once existed there. That approach, for now, is limited to our own solar system. The second is remote observation. The James Webb Space Telescope can examine the atmospheres of distant planets up to around 1,000 light years away. The third is the search for extraterrestrial intelligence itself, though Diamond prefers a more precise description. What Seti is really seeking, he says, is extraterrestrial technology, something that acts as a proxy for life and intelligence.\n\nSo, when might all of this happen? “A Seti discovery could happen tomorrow, it might not happen for a thousand years, we don’t know,” Diamond says. “But one of the things we also say in this business is that the probability for finding life beyond Earth if you don’t look for it is zero.”\n\nThe challenge, he explains, is scale. If a signal was sent from Alpha Centauri, the closest star system to our solar system, it would only take four years to get here. Yet if an alien civilisation 1,000 light years away sent a message today, it would not reach us for 10 centuries. If we replied, our response would take just as long. Therefore, any exchange would unfold across generations rather than lifetimes.\n\nThat does not dampen his optimism. Humanity has been technologically capable for barely a century. In that time, we have gone from inventing radio to building space telescopes that can study worlds hundreds of light years away. Given enough time, our reach will expand.\n\nA confirmed detection would be historic. Diamond and his colleagues are already thinking about what it would mean. What will that discovery do to humanity as we know it? Change it for the better, Diamond hopes.\n\n“Whatever the nature of the discovery, almost certainly it will have an impact on us,” he says. “How will it impact religious beliefs and how will it impact governments and international diplomacy?”\n\nFor a man who spends his days contemplating vast distances and civilisations he may never see, the conclusion is strikingly human. “I hope we will be excited by the news and not threatened by it. Maybe people would finally realise we are all on this one planet as one little island and in this together so it might be smart for us to co-operate instead of fighting with each other.”\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "fullText": "Italian cricket is in crisis days after the country's T20 World Cup debut, as it emerged that a senior national governing body official has been investigated over a sexual assault allegation.\n\nFederazione Cricket Italiana (FCRI) women's cricket co-ordinator Prabath Ekneligoda, 57, was the subject of a criminal investigation relating to a claim he inappropriately touched a member of the Azzurri women's national team.\n\nMultiple members of the Italy board are said to have resigned over this case and other governance issues, BBC Sport has been told.\n\nThe sexual assault allegation was made to police in Rome in March last year by a player who has represented the national team.\n\nThe player, whose identity is protected for legal reasons, alleged that the sexual assault occurred during a massage on a knee injury at a training session, and she had been scared to report the incident because she feared it would cost her a spot in the team.\n\nAn investigation was concluded by a Rome prosecutor in November 2025 and Ekneligoda was interviewed by police the following month.\n\nA decision is now set to be made on whether there is sufficient evidence to bring it to trial. Ekneligoda's lawyer said his client denies the allegation, that there are ulterior motives to the allegation, and that a witness supports his version of events.\n\nFCRI said in a statement to BBC Sport it \"noted proceedings are currently under way before the federal prosecutor's office\" and will \"co-operate with the relevant authorities\".\n\n\"The Italian Cricket Federation reiterates that its conduct is guided by principles of fairness, transparency and the protection of its registered members, as well as by the ethical and civic standards that underpin the sporting system,\" added the statement.\n\n\"The federation therefore defers to the competent judicial authorities for any determinations arising from the matter.\"\n\nEkneligoda, who is originally from Sri Lanka, was suspended from his role with the FCRI in November but has remained a visible presence on the Italian cricket scene.\n\nHe is the partner of FCRI president Maria Lorena Haz Paz and accompanied her to India for the men's T20 World Cup.\n\nBBC Sport has seen evidence that Ekneligoda attended Italy's matches wearing official accreditation and was permitted to sit with the rest of the FCRI party.\n\nEkneligoda was also seen at various events laid on for Italy's cricket delegation, including a reception at the Italian consulate in Kolkata for officials, players and coaching staff.\n\nThe FCRI, its president Haz Paz, and safeguarding officers, had full knowledge of the seriousness of the claim made against Ekneligoda before the World Cup.\n\nLast weekend, Il Messaggero, external and Corriere della Sera, external reported the allegation in the Italian media for the first time.\n\nAs of Monday, Ekneligoda was still listed as the women's cricket coordinator on the FCRI website.\n\nSources have told BBC Sport that some members of the FCRI's board have resigned over the matter, and other governance issues, which has placed Haz Paz's position under greater scrutiny.\n\nSenior officials in Italian cricket fear potential reputational damage, and the possibility of legal cases, will hamper opportunities to capitalise on their debut T20 World Cup appearance and grow the game further in the country.\n\nHaz Paz was appointed president of the Italian cricket federation in February 2025 until 2028.\n\nItaly's debut at the T20 World Cup, and the stories of some of their players, had captured the imagination of the cricket world.\n\nThe Azzurri failed to make the Super 8 stage but beat Nepal in Mumbai and gave England a scare in Kolkata in their Group C fixtures.\n\nIPL-linked teams 'not considering Pakistan players'\n\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone\n\n'It smacks of England' - Australia fail again at T20 World Cup",

Hope your week has gotten off to a great start.\n\nThe Miami Hurricanes had some notable happenings in the sports world since the last time I touched base, so let’s get right to them.\n\n1) Holy moly. What a night it was in Coral Gables last Tuesday night.\n\nI had my phone and tables set up side by side and was watching the dramatics unfold in both Canes baseball and Canes hoops at the same time.\n\nMiami baseball found themselves down 5-0 going into the eighth inning against UCF, and while it felt over, I figured I’d watched it this far and would stick with it. And boy, I’m glad I did. With two outs, Jake Ogden clubbed one out to left to get back inside slam range and make it 5-2 going to the ninth.\n\nMeanwhile, Miami kept seesawing back and forth with the Virginia Tech Hokies on the hardwood. The stubborn Hokies continued to hold a slim lead that Miami would quickly erase, only to see VT jump back again. It felt like a game that, in the stars, was supposed to go Tech’s way. At least those were the vibes.\n\nBut then, UCF’s pitcher got wiiiiiiiild and plunked three Canes in the bottom of the ninth. Michael Torres got a ball past the infield for a single to plate two and tie the game. Suddenly, it felt like it could be Miami’s night.\n\nMARK LIGHT MAGIC!!!! pic.twitter.com/93Htyjuf5S\n\n— Miami Hurricanes Baseball (@CanesBaseball) February 18, 2026\n\nNext door, up 67-66 with 3.6 seconds left, Tech drove the ball to the hoop. Except their man fell down and half-stumble/threw up a shot that missed. Tech missed the offensive rebound, and time expired on a crucial win at Watsco Center.\n\nThe Canes survive!

Clutch defined him.\n\nNearly seven years removed from undergoing surgery for a brain tumor, Vance Sheahan (@SheahanVance) delivered a signature win for @CanesBaseball on Tuesday.\n\n🔗 https://t.co/ss5iB6WnBr pic.twitter.com/AToe04oV0U\n\n— D1Baseball (@d1baseball) February 19, 2026\n\nNights like this don’t come around often, and for those who got to go to one (or both), man, I am envious. A tremendous night for Miami athletics.\n\n2) Saturday night was, unfortunately, tough for the Hurricanes on the hardwood in Charlottesville .\n\nBut they gave the Wahoos everything they had and took that game right to the wire. Miami tied it up at 83 on a driving basket by Malike Renau with seven seconds left. Unfortunately, what happened in the Canes’ favor the Saturday before burned them against Virginia. With under four seconds left, Tre Donaldson fouled Jake Mallory on a three, and Mallory sank all three free throws for the winning margin.\n\nStill, that’s not a game you expect to win, although it would have been basically a tourney clincher if they’d gotten it.\n\nNext up is at FSU on Tuesday night. The Seminoles have been playing well lately, and Miami, well, almost never seems to beat them in basketball. This team needs to get this one in Tallahassee after coming up short in Coral Gables against them earlier in the year. A loss could push Miami back towards the bubble after working hard to get off it.\n\n3) Boy, how the Canes are crushing the baseball right now.\n\nI’ll just leave this here for you.\n\nCuvet's grand slam is Miami's 21st HR this season in their 9th game\n\nCanes hit their 21st HR in game 18 last year.

Dylan Dubovik went nuclear against Lafayette, with five of his nine hits in 11 ABs going for extra bases.

    "title": "Chasing Virat Kohli, carrying Pakistan: Sahibzada Farhan’s goals in T20 World Cup",
    "description": "Having scored 220 runs already, Sahibzada Farhan has emerged as Pakistan’s batting constant in a turbulent T20 World Cup. As questions swirl around strike rates, collapses, and pressure on senior players, Sahibzada Farhan remains unmoved. Even with Virat Kohli’s iconic tournament run record in view. For him, the focus is simple: to score runs and not think about the milestones.",
    "fullText": "TimesofIndia.com in Kandy: In a T20 World Cup where Pakistan’s campaign has lurched between frustration and uncertainty, Sahibzada Farhan has quietly become their most reliable presence. With 220 runs to his name and at least two matches still to come, Farhan finds himself in rare territory, one that inevitably invites comparisons, records, and pressure.\n\nAt the pre-match press conference, he was asked a million dollar question on whether he is aiming to take down Virat Kohli's 12-year-old record as leading run-getter in the T20 World Cup. Kohli amassed 319 runs in the 2014 edition and 296 runs in 2022. His 319-run tally is still the highest by any batter in a single T20 World Cup.\n\n“I don’t look at stats. Even when I perform, people tell me how many runs I’ve scored,” he told reporters. “If you start thinking about records, it becomes an added burden. I want to finish well. I want Pakistan to be proud.”\n\nThat philosophy has shaped Farhan’s T20 World Cup so far. In a tournament where rain washed away momentum and Pakistan’s batting order repeatedly collapsed under pressure, Farhan has provided something invaluable: time at the crease. While critics have questioned strike rates and tempo, a conversation that has followed Pakistan’s top order for years, Farhan pushed back gently but firmly. “This is international cricket. You can’t start hitting from ball one every time. You have to read the pitch,” he explained. “If the ball is in my range, I attack. Once I get momentum, I try to take it long so the team can benefit.”\n\nThose words also reflect Pakistan’s broader dilemma. The bowlers, especially the spinners, have largely delivered. The batting, however, has struggled to keep pace, particularly against top opposition. Farhan did not shy away from acknowledging that reality. “Yes, we have collapsed in batting,” he admitted. “In T20 cricket, your top three or four have to score runs. We haven’t done that consistently. But the boys are working hard, and they are focused.”\n\nDespite the scrutiny, Farhan spoke with notable calm about the pressure surrounding senior players and teammates. Whether it was Saim Ayub’s lean run or the criticism aimed at experienced campaigners, Farhan stressed belief and roles over panic. “Not every player can perform in every match. Everyone has their own role,” he said. “Saim is an impact player. He believes in himself, and that belief matters in T20 cricket.”\n\nAttention also turned to upcoming challenges, including facing elite pacers. Asked about squaring up against England's Jofra Archer, Farhan was refreshingly blunt. “It’s not a big deal,” he shrugged. “We’ve faced him before. He will plan for me, but I have planned for him too. That’s international cricket.”\n\nWhat perhaps stood out most was Farhan’s clarity amid chaos. Rain delays, points-table permutations, decisions at the toss, none seemed to interest him. “Those calls are for the captain and coach,” he said. “Our job is to prepare and play according to the conditions.”\n\nAs Pakistan head deeper into the Super Eight phase, Farhan’s runs carry added weight. Each innings inches him closer to Kohli’s historic World Cup tally, even if he insists that the numbers mean little. Yet records means a lot to the players, especially in the subcontinent. \n\nWhether he reaches the mark or not, one thing is clear. In a T20 World Cup filled with noise around Pakistan’s batting, Sahibzada Farhan has chosen the quietest route, scoring runs, absorbing pressure, and letting his bat talk.",

    "description": "I traveled to Africa and South America after high school. The gap year taught me more about adulthood than college ever did.",
    "fullText": "After spending two months watching women and girls fetch water from the village tap and then walk home with the enormous containers balanced on their heads, I had become increasingly determined to try to help with this daily task. I had admired the women's strength before, but as my neck muscles ached and my scalp bruised under the weight, my admiration had only grown.\n\nGambian women's lives were very different from my life in Long Island, New York — and that was exactly the point of my gap year between high school and college.\n\nThe trip consisted of teaching English in Gambia, exercising and caring for the resident horses on a private wildlife reserve in Namibia's Kalahari Region, teaching English in Patate, Ecuador, volunteering at both an elderly care center and an animal rescue in Quito, Ecuador, and exploring the Galápagos Islands.\n\nEighteen years later, I can confidently say that my gap year played a significant role in shaping the person I have become, and that's why I am encouraging my little sisters, who are 18 and 13, to take a gap year after high school as well.\n\nStarting my trip in the Gambia was like being thrown into the deep end of the adulting pool. The only ATM in the country that accepted my debit cards was a six-hour round-trip from the village where I was staying, and it had a daily withdrawal limit.\n\nOvernight, I went from being a financially clueless teenager who asked my parents for a top-up when I needed it, to getting a crash course on setting and sticking to a budget. I quickly learned the value of money.\n\nMy relationship with time was as lackadaisical as my relationship with money. But having people and animals relying on me forced me to develop a sense of time management. This was especially true in the Kalahari Desert, where it was imperative that every worker, visitor, volunteer, and domesticated animal be inside before the sun was directly overhead to avoid heat stroke.\n\nLearning budgeting and time management served me well in college and my career. But these were small nuggets of wisdom compared to the bigger lessons I learned about racism, privilege, and the freedom of life lived offline.\n\nAs a white-presenting Colombian American living in the Gambia, it was only the second time in my life when I looked different from everyone else around me. People stared when I walked through Serrekunda Market, and kids would excitedly yell \"toubab\" (the Mandinkan word for \"white person\").\n\nI did not fault them for their reactions; instead, I did my best to absorb the experience of being treated differently because of the color of my skin. It has since helped me better identify when my unconscious biases arise.\n\nI stepped into my freshman year calm, confident, technologically detoxed, and refreshed after my academically rigorous high school experience.\n\nWhere some of my peers self-medicated their separation anxiety, social anxiety, or overwhelm with binge drinking, I had already had a year to process these emotions and learned to adapt. The result was a smoother transition into academic life, a high GPA at the end of my freshman year, and a maturity that caught the attention of internship hiring managers.\n\nMore importantly, though, it gave me freedom, awareness, compassion, and a global lens through which I still process life.\n\nThis is what I really want for my sisters. I want them to know a life away from the noise and pressure of the digital world. I want them to have the space to learn from and be shaped by different people and cultures. I want them to have a year where they are not pushing themselves to excel academically or professionally, but instead can just learn who they are and what they want to do with their lives.\n\nCollege has become an oppressive financial burden. If they pursue it, I hope they are as mentally and emotionally prepared as possible so they get the most out of their financial investment.\n\nMy sisters would undoubtedly have their own experiences that leave unique imprints on their minds. If that helps them collect themselves before journeying into the messy, confusing world of adulthood, that sounds like a year well spent.",

    "description": "Artificial intelligence is driving two overlapping shifts that are reshaping marketing. First, conversational AI is displacing websites and traditional search as the way people learn about products, shrinking traffic, narrowing choice, and forcing companies to rethink visibility when answers are generated rather than clicked. This transition—from search engine optimization to generative engine optimization—favors brands whose information is structured, trusted, and easy for AI systems to synthesize. Second, AI agents are beginning to act as buyers, making purchasing decisions on behalf of humans. As algorithms increasingly evaluate options and transact, marketing must adapt to a world in which the customer may be a machine with its own decision logic, requiring leaders to redesign content, infrastructure, and strategy for both human and algorithmic audiences.",

Now I am trying to think less and the bat will now do the talking and I react [to] what's in front of me,\" Hetmyer said afterwards.\n\nZimbabwe rued dropping him twice, with the hapless Musekiwa wishing the Wankhede turf would swallow him up after he spilled two opportunities his team-mates would have expected him to take.\n\nIt might have been different had the first been held, although with strike rates of 238 (Rutherford), 210 (Shepherd) and 325 (Holder), possibly not.\n\nZimbabwe were never in the chase after Motie and Hosein turned the screw - West Indies' left-arm tweakers bagging seven of the wickets to fall.\n\nThe West Indies World Cup bandwagon rolls on after banking another impressive victory and the only concern is whether they are peaking too early.\n\nCertainly on this evidence they will take some stopping.\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

It has rarely been pretty.\n\nFor every Joe Root, Kevin Pietersen or Graham Thorpe, there have been far more troubled by the tweakers.\n\nEngland beat Sri Lanka by 51 runs on Sunday, meaning victory against Pakistan on Tuesday will secure a place in the semi-finals, but the issue that has dogged their batting throughout this T20 World Cup did not go away.\n\nFour of England's top five were out to spinners. The other, Tom Banton, was run out.\n\nAnd Pakistan used six different spinners in their match against India earlier in the tournament. They have bowled a higher percentage of spin than any other team.\n\nEngland's problems have not gone unnoticed.\n\n\"They were struggling against the spinners,\" said batter Sahibzada Farhan.\n\n\"We have one of the best spin attacks. which has Usman Tariq, [Mohammad] Nawaz, Shadab [Khan], even Abrar [Ahmed] is one of the top spinners.\n\n\"I am confident we will give them a tough time.\"\n\nEngland's 'Jack of all trades' delivers for Brook again\n\nWhy is there talk about a Pakistan spinner's action?\n\nEngland's issues against spin at this tournament are curious, given what had come before.\n\nDuring the T20 series against Sri Lanka before this World Cup they lost only three wickets against spin across three matches.\n\nEven in the one-day international series that preceded it, with many of the same players, they averaged 43.9 collectively against the turning ball.\n\nHowever, those numbers have nose-dived on the biggest stage.\n\nOverall, 21 of England's 38 wickets have fallen to spin - not a major disparity to the 17 against pace - but more significant have been the moments those dismissals have come.\n\nThere were four in succession against Italy in the group stage and before that six in a row through the middle in defeat by West Indies in Mumbai.\n\nThe Sri Lanka win was the third occasion England were unable to break from a stranglehold.\n\n\"We were very good in the bilateral series here against Sri Lanka, where we played spin,\" said spinner Liam Dawson in defence of his top order.\n\n\"We know we can bat a lot better than what we have batted. We've won games and that's the main thing.\"\n\nAn lbw dismissal to Dunith Wellalage means England's captain Harry Brook has been removed by spinners four times in a row at this World Cup.\n\nOverall he now averages 19.1 against spin in T20 internationals, compared to 46.2 against the quicks.\n\nJacob Bethell, who played a horrible slog to fall to Maheesh Theekshana on Sunday, has got out to a spinner in every innings.\n\nJos Buttler was pinned in front by Wellalage, though he looked equally as troubled by the seamers.\n\nButtler, who has made three single-figure scores in a row, was the only player from the expected XI for Tuesday to train on Monday evening.\n\nGiven England rarely train when there is only one day between matches, that shows Buttler's struggle to find form.\n\nTuesday's match is again in Pallekele, where England have now won four T20s in a row in a matter of weeks. It is becoming a home far away from home in the Sri Lankan jungle.\n\nThe match will also be played on a fresh, unused pitch, which England will hope is more suited to clean-hitting. If not they, of course, have their own potent spin attack as Sunday's win showed.\n\nBut Pakistan's spin attack still looms large. It features 6ft 4in mystery spinner Usman Tariq, whose side-arm action and stop-start run-up is almost unique in world cricket.\n\nIt has been discussed at length throughout this tournament and Brook was seen mimicking his approach on Friday while England trained in the nets.\n\n\"It's just weird that he pauses more than anything,\" Bethell said last week.\n\n\"It's also interesting how they only use him after the 10-over mark.\n\n\"Maybe we try and put some pressure on them and see if they want to bring him on earlier - that might mess him up a bit.\"\n\nBanton is the only England batter to have faced Tariq before, having done so at the ILT20. He was dismissed by the lanky spinner and afterwards appeared to question the legitimacy of his bowling action.\n\nThe insights of Sam Curran, Tariq's ILT20 captain, and Buttler and Luke Wood, who played with him in the Abu Dhabi T10, may be useful.\n\nEngland should know what is coming.\n\nA threat they have rarely nullified stands between them and a World Cup semi-final.\n\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

    "description": "BBC Sport explores the unfolding security situation in Mexico and the potential impact on this summer's World Cup.",
    "fullText": "Mexico's co-hosting of this summer's Fifa World Cup could be compromised by the eruption in drug cartel violence which began on Sunday, experts have told BBC Sport.\n\nThe Jalisco New Generation (CJNG) drug cartel - one of the country's most powerful and feared criminal organisations - has engaged in gun shootouts with the Mexican military, blocked roads and burned vehicles in response to the killing of its leader Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes, better known as 'El Mencho', in an army operation.\n\nViolence began in the central-western Jalisco state - where a code red security situation has been declared - and has now spread to at least a dozen more regions, with videos posted online showing gunmen patrolling streets and smoke billowing over cities.\n\nAt least 25 National Guard officers have been killed inside 24 hours.\n\nGuadalajara, capital city of Jalisco and home to more than a million people, is scheduled to host four matches at this summer's tournament. Another five are scheduled in Mexico City, and four in Monterrey.\n\n\"When you push down on the cartels you do get pushback - the danger is that it can be very difficult to manage a security situation that spirals out of control,\" says Javier Eskauriatza, assistant professor of criminal law at the University of Nottingham.\n\nThe power vacuum created by El Mencho's killing could lead to a period of instability and further conflict as contenders vie to replace him.\n\n\"In general the cartels have an economic interest in making sure the World Cup is peaceful,\" Dr Eskauriatza adds.\n\n\"Yes they pay off politicians and local police forces, but they also buy restaurants and own hotels. They are part of the economic system.\n\n\"It is useful for them if Brits, Americans, and others go to Mexico, spend their money and have a good time.\"\n\nBBC Sport has contacted Fifa for comment.\n\nThe CJNG is estimated to be worth more than £10bn and has tens of thousands of members. It has been responsible for a series of massacres, kidnappings and killings of politicians since its formation in 2009.\n\nBut some cartel figures retain a level of popularity within local communities in Mexico, as they provide financing for local infrastructure and facilities.\n\n\"The response by the CJNG is, in a way, required by the rules of the game - if you have your leader nabbed, you have to respond, otherwise you look weak\", says Dr. Eskauriatza.\n\n\"They are not idiots - they know that social media will film and amplify these videos for them and and they have made sure the response looks national.\"\n\nThe US government has advised Americans in Jalisco to shelter indoors until further notice, while fellow World Cup co-host nation Canada has cancelled flights to the Puerto Vallarta airport, and flight tracking apps showed many aeroplanes returning to their departure destinations around the world.\n\n\"In terms of tourists, I would say there will be a moderate risk for them\", says Dr. Karina Garcia-Reyes, senior lecturer in criminology at UWE Bristol.\n\n\"Unless more military operations are conducted this week, I would expect that the authorities in the most affected areas will be able address potential risks, so overall I would expect tourists to be safe as long as they follow the authorities' indications.\"\n\nSecurity planning for the World Cup has already been under scrutiny over the deployment of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers to major US cities by President Donald Trump, leading to the killings of two US citizens by federal agents so far this year, and a series of mass protests.\n\nLast month, Football Supporters Europe said it was \"extremely concerned by the ongoing militarisation of police forces in the US\".\n\nNow eyes are on Mexico and whether it can guarantee the safety of travelling fans.\n\nFour football matches - two in the top flight and two in the second division - were postponed on Sunday because of the violence.\n\n\"People in Mexico are hoping that this is a one-off retaliation and that as the cartel reorganises itself, things will settle down,\" says Monica Serrano Carreto, professor of international relations at El Colegio de Mexico.\n\n\"But there is also a risk that this leads to a new period of instability, unpredictability and the violence continues.\n\n\"The type of weapons that the cartel has access to means that a military-style confrontation in the aftermath is inevitable - the government would have known that. We have seen in the past they [the cartel] even have weapons capable of shooting down helicopters.\n\n\"I think it will already have had an impact on how people view coming to Mexico because the images are top of the news around the world.\"\n\nMexico has been under increased political pressure to take action against cartels in the past year.\n\n\"This response is not unique but is very serious and very high scale,\" says Jon Benjamin, UK ambassador to Mexico between 2021 and 2024.\n\n\"President Trump has designated the cartels as terrorist organisations and Mexico has already handed over dozens of cartel figures to them. The Trump factor is very important in what is happening.\"",

    "fullText": "Barcelona midfielder Gavi is entering the most important phase of his recovery and his eyes are already fixed on the next World Cup.\n\nAccording to SPORT, the 21-year-old is highly motivated to return in time to fight for a place in Spain’s squad.\n\nAfter months of frustration on the sidelines, the young midfielder is finally back training with the group, taking careful steps toward full fitness.\n\nGavi has been out of top-level competition for nearly five months following surgery on his right knee meniscus on September 23.\n\nThe procedure forced him into a long rehabilitation process, but now he is gradually reintegrating into team sessions.\n\nHis workload remains controlled, with both the medical department and coaching staff keeping a close watch on every movement.\n\nWithin Barcelona, it has been made very clear that there will be no shortcuts.\n\nThe club believes it would make little sense to rush his return after showing patience for months.\n\nThe priority is to help Gavi regain confidence, rhythm and match sharpness without risking setbacks.\n\nGavi wants to play the World Cup. (Photo by Florencia Tan Jun/Getty Images)\n\nA knee injury is delicate, and Barcelona want him to feel completely secure before stepping back into competitive action.\n\nAs such, optimism is growing internally, as the upcoming international break could actually benefit him, giving him uninterrupted weeks of training without the pressure of immediate match demands.\n\nThe plan is for him to complete full sessions consistently, increase intensity step by step, and reconnect with the feeling of being a competitive footballer.\n\nFor Gavi, the past months have been difficult and now, feeling useful to the team again before the end of the season is his short-term objective.\n\nMeanwhile, Luis de la Fuente has maintained regular contact with him.\n\nThe Spain coach is closely following his progress and understands both the risks and the potential reward.\n\nDe la Fuente has never hidden his admiration for the Barcelona midfielder and believes he could still play a role if he reaches the required level in time.\n\nReaching the World Cup will not be easy, as competition in Spain’s midfield is fierce. Despite that, if Gavi regains his rhythm and intensity, the door will not be closed.",

    "fullText": "It was an exciting week made up of unforgettable moments for the girls at Inter Academy New England, who took part in a fully immersive journey into the Nerazzurri world.\n\nThrough visits to the stadium, training ground, and the Club's headquarters, the American delegation had the opportunity to experience the passion, history, and values that define Inter.\n\nOn the night of Inter vs. Juventus, which ended with the Nerazzurri winning 3-2, the young Academy players experienced firsthand the intensity of one of the most legendary rivalries in Italian football.\n\nBefore kick-off, the girls took part in activities and fan interactions in the Museo LED area, taking photos and creating content for social platforms, which added to the atmosphere. They then took to the stage of the Inter Live Show in a night made even more memorable by the Nerazzurri's victory.\n\nTo close out the stadium experience, the Academy had the chance to watch the squad's warm-up up close, soaking in the moments leading up to kick-off from a unique perspective in a crucial match.\n\nThe journey continued at the Konami Football Centre, where the girls participated in training sessions throughout the week, led by the technical staff of the Nerazzurri Youth Sector. It was an incredible and educational experience that allowed the young participants to interact directly with the Club's ideology.\n\nOn Friday, two players from the Inter Women's squad and coach Gianpiero Piovani came onto the pitch and made the week even more memorable. Through moments of connection and the presentation of final participation certificates by Bugeja, Bowen, and the coach, the girls at the Academy felt a sense of belonging to the Nerazzurri family.\n\nThe visit came to an end at Inter HQ, with an exclusive Trophy Room Tour. It served as a journey into the Club's history through trophies and achievements that tell the story of the Nerazzurri's glories and inspire future generations.\n\nIt was a week that will stay in the hearts of the young Inter Academy New England players, highlighting the strength of the Inter Academy project globally. It is a connection across cultures, brought together by the same colours and Nerazzurri passion.",

    "fullText": "When it comes to football on the island of Ireland, there isn't much 102-year-old Charlie O'Leary has not seen or done.\n\nFrom serving as the Republic of Ireland's kitman at two World Cups and a European Championship, to refereeing behind the Iron Curtain, the Dubliner has an almost legendary status.\n\nWhat is not as well known is his involvement in founding the \"street leagues\", which helped hone the skills of some of the best players in the history of both the Republic and Northern Ireland.\n\nNow his story is the focus of a new film which will premiere at the Dublin International Film Festival on Tuesday.\n\nAs the Republic's kitman, O'Leary was part of the national team setup during its golden era, when Ireland defeated England in Stuttgart at Euro '88 and famously stunned Italy in New York at World Cup '94.\n\nBut his influence stretches to some other iconic moments thanks to the street leagues, which he founded in East Wall in Dublin in 1945.\n\nCharlie suggested to the local priest the idea of using the parish church's juvenile sodality - a religious group for young parishioners - as the basis for a football league.\n\nThe sodality was organised on the basis of the local streets - and so the street leagues were born.\n\n\"Schoolboy football hadn't been organised and there was nowhere for a young boy around 14 if he wanted to play football,\" Charlie said.\n\n\"At least this gave those kids at that age a chance of representing those roads in football and getting them interested.\n\n\"So we formed the leagues and they really cottoned on.\"\n\nSo much so that by the 1950s the leagues had spread across Dublin and then to cities across the island, including Belfast.\n\nThe leagues first took root in east Belfast, where people associated with the Harland and Wolff shipyard were among the first to compete.\n\nThey began to feature young men who would go on to achieve sporting greatness.\n\nIn the Republic they included Tony Dunne, who won the European Cup with Manchester United in 1968, Liam Brady, winner of the FA Cup with Arsenal and two Serie A titles with Juventus, and Johnny Giles, part of the great Leeds United side of the 1960s and 70s.\n\nIn Northern Ireland, at least three of the 1958 World Cup squad spent time in the street leagues - Harry Gregg, Bertie Peacock and Jimmy McIlroy.\n\nIn later years Manchester United's Sammy McIlroy - who went on to manage Northern Ireland - and Jimmy Nicholl, current Northern Ireland assistant manager, took part in the leagues.\n\nThere was an early sign of things to come in 1957 when Republic of Ireland B took on Romania B in Dublin.\n\n\"There was Liam Tuohy of Newcastle, Noel Payton of Leeds and Dickie Whittaker of Chelsea, all three of them standing together, shoulder to shoulder, for the national anthem,\" Charlie said.\n\n\"Each of those had played, you could pull a curtain over where they lived, the houses were that close.\n\n\"On one day they represented Ireland and all played in the street leagues.\"\n\nCharlie was born just a few months before the Irish Free State - as it was then known - played its first international football match.\n\nThe story of his life - which has therefore spanned the entire existence of his country's national team - will be shown in The Charlie O'Leary Story - From Johnny Cullen's Hill to the Olympic Stadium Rome.\n\nFergus Dowd, who produced the film along with Joe Lee, said the street leagues gave opportunities to young people who would not otherwise have had them.\n\n\"One of the players said to Charlie it was like playing for your country, you played for your street but you were amongst friends and it was really community based,\" he said.\n\n\"I think in a sense we've really sort of lost that innocence - these kids had a jersey on, they were representing the road and their mothers and fathers were watching, so it was a massive community event.\n\n\"Nowadays a lot of the clubs here have their own academies whereas this grew very much organically and it was down to Charlie's idea of making it happen.\"\n\nThe leagues persisted into the 1970s, giving an opportunity to the man who delivered Northern Ireland's greatest moment on the world stage, Gerry Armstrong.\n\nA few years after his iconic goal sealed a 1-0 victory against hosts Spain in the 1982 World Cup, it was the turn of the Republic of Ireland to revel in a shock victory.\n\nThey defeated England 1-0 in Euro '88 and Charlie was watching from the dugout, having been appointed kitman two years earlier.\n\n\"I saw grown men cry,\" Charlie said.\n\n\"There was a man who used to live next door to me and he had gone with his son and he came over to me and he was sobbing.\n\n\"He said 'Charlie, I can boast, I was here when we beat England'.\"\n\nSix years later there was another iconic win, this time against Italy at the World Cup and again, Charlie was there.\n\nThose great victories were masterminded by Jack Charlton, who Charlie said was the best man manager he ever worked under.\n\nHe recalled one occasion when the boss quizzed him after some players were involved in a \"drinking session\" the night before which had ended in a \"rumpus\".\n\n\"He said 'I'm asking you a simple question, what happened last night?',\" Charlie said.\n\n\"I said 'boss hang on a second, if I tell you then you're involved and you've got problems to resolve.\n\n\"I tell you what I'll do, if I say to you everything is resolved, then it's all resolved.\n\n\"So Jack said, 'that's all I want to know, we'll leave it at that,'\n\n\"I got away with that gag every time there was a problem.\"\n\nFrom being part of the backroom team for those famous victories to refereeing in East Germany during the Cold War - \"a bit frightening\" - Charlie has plenty of footballing highlights to pick from.\n\nSo what is his favourite moment?\n\n\"I have to say, I'm a Roman Catholic, when we went to Italy [for the 1990 World Cup] we were brought to see the Pope,\" he said.\n\n\"I was frozen, I couldn't speak.\n\n\"People say, I said this and I said that, I don't remember saying that.\n\n\"But that to me was the biggest thrill I ever got in my life.\"",

    "fullText": "Olympic champion Keely Hodgkinson says she feels \"closer than ever\" to breaking the women's 800m outdoor record - the longest-standing world record in athletics.\n\nJarmila Kratochvilova set the record of one minute 53.28 seconds in Munich in July 1983.\n\nBut Britain's Hodgkinson, who broke the event's indoor world record on Thursday, believes she can surpass Kratochvilova and achieve something that will \"cement her place as the greatest of all time\".\n\n\"It's not an easy feat and there's a reason it has stood for so long, \" Hodgkinson told BBC Sport.\n\n\"I think this is the closest I've felt near it. I do really believe that we can break it, but a lot of things have got to come together.\"\n\nHodgkinson's stunning indoor run in France saw her cross the line in 1:54.87 to smash a world record which had stood since 3 March 2002 - the day the Briton was born.\n\nHer coach, Jenny Meadows, told BBC Sport the athlete's time in Lievin could have been up to one second faster - and Hodgkinson is aiming higher still.\n\n\"I've known for weeks I'm capable of breaking it. It's just a matter of getting out on the day,\" she said.\n\n\"We can push it even further in the future, as long as I stay healthy and I think this is hopefully just the beginning.\"\n\nVictory came after a difficult year for the 23-year-old, who stormed to Olympic gold at the Paris Games in 2024.\n\nHodgkinson was left unable to train after tearing her hamstring just a few months after that triumph and has been building her way back ever since.\n\n\"After winning the Olympics, it really wasn't what I thought was going to happen,\" she said.\n\n\"It makes you stop and strip back everything and think, why is this happening? What are the problems?\n\n\"But, we got through it, I became a stronger person, and I think this is now the reward of all of that happening.\"\n\nHow Hodgkinson broke a 23-year-old world record\n\nHodgkinson smashes women's indoor 800m world record\n\nHodgkinson admits a lot of things need to come together for her to break Kratochvilova's record but her recent performances have convinced others in the sport it's only a matter of time.\n\nWorld Athletics president Lord Coe told the Sunday Times he believes Hodgkinson will achieve the feat this year.\n\nThere have been claims that Kratochvilova's performance was assisted by the systematic doping regime that existed in her country at the time - something she has strenuously denied., external\n\nHowever, her time remains more than a second quicker than Hodgkinson's current personal best of 1:54.61 - a national record she set in London in 2024.\n\n\"We're on the right path and we've seen evidence in training that we think that it's possible,\" Hodgkinson said.\n\n\"I think the reason this year has gone so well for me is because I've had my healthiest winter training I've had in years.\"\n\nWhile the race Hodgkinson and her team may target for any record attempt may remain a mystery, Hodgkinson says she is always keen to put in a big performance in London.\n\n\"My coach did say two years ago that 2026 will be a good year,\" she said.\n\n\"London is very special to me. I would love nothing more than to do something like that in front of a home crowd.\"\n\nThe last 12 months have been a rollercoaster of emotions for Hodgkinson.\n\nAfter numerous injury setbacks, Hodgkinson took world 800m bronze in September, with training partner Georgia Hunter Bell securing silver.\n\nDespite the ups and downs, Hodgkinson still describes 2025 as \"my best year\".\n\n\"I still had a good time - my entire personality is not my job,\" she said.\n\n\"There's so much more outside of life than just what I have going in my career.\"\n\nDuring her rehabilitation, Hodgkinson's team mates dubbed her 'Keely 2.0' - a nod to her reinvention and ability to come back stronger.\n\nCoach Trevor Painter bought her a giant Himalayan salt lamp to, as she says, \"send happy vibes\".\n\n\"He says my moods were unpredictable last year\" she joked.\n\n\"It's meant to calm the energy in the atmosphere.\n\n\"It weighs about forty kilograms, so imagine me trying to carry it up the stairs, but I actually think it worked!\"\n\nFirst up, though, will be March's World Athletics Indoor Championships in Poland, where Hodgkinson will be the firm favourite for gold.\n\nOutdoors, she will have an exciting new name next to her on the start line.\n\nIn October, two-time 400m hurdles world champion Femke Bol announced she will step up to compete in the 800m.\n\nEarlier this month, the Dutch superstar won her debut race in Metz, France, setting a national record of 1:59.07 in the process.\n\n\"'Me and Femke are really good friends,\" Hodgkinson said.\n\n\"We've grown up a little bit together over the years. Femke is a very talented woman, but I also know what it takes to run the 800m at these times.\n\n\"Just give her some time [and] she'll get there.\"\n\nWhen asked if she would consider it a potential rivalry, Hodgkinson said: \"I wouldn't call it a rivalry right now, but she's good, and she'll get where she needs to be when she's ready.\"",

    "fullText": "Defending T20 World Cup champions India need \"two big performances\" to reach the semi-finals after Sunday's huge defeat to South Africa, said their assistant coach.\n\nIndia came into the T20 World Cup as hot favourites on home soil but were thrashed by 76 runs in the Super Eights as 80,000 fans at the massive Narendra Modi stadium were stunned into silence.\n\nIn their first chase of the tournament, India's batting came up woefully short in the face of some disciplined South Africa bowling.\n\nIndia collapsed to 111 all out in 18.5 overs in response to South Africa's 187-7 as their 12-match win streak in the T20 World Cup came to a crashing end.\n\nThe magnitude of the defeat has left India with a desperate net run-rate of -3.8 and likely needing to win their last two Super Eight matches convincingly to make it to the semi-finals.\n\nAnything less and India will need to rely on a combination of other results going their way.\n\n\"Very disappointed in the performance,\" said Ryan ten Doeschate.\n\n\"When you set out to win a World Cup, don't expect someone to come and deliver it to you halfway through,\" the assistant coach added.\n\n\"We've messed up on a grand scale and now the onus is on this group of guys to turn it around and put in two solid performances.\"\n\nIndia are grouped with South Africa, the West Indies and Zimbabwe in Super Eights, with the top two advancing to the semi-finals.\n\nThe West Indies face Zimbabwe on Monday night in Mumbai in their Super Eights opener.\n\nIndia next face giant-killers Zimbabwe, who have already beaten Australia and Sri Lanka, on Thursday in Chennai.\n\nSouth Africa play the West Indies the same day in Ahmedabad where Aiden Markram's side could put one foot firmly in the semi-finals with another win.\n\n\"Obviously with the way the group goes, you need at least four points to get through now, and it's going to need two big performances and a big bounce back from everyone,\" said Ten Doeschate.\n\nIndia's fragile batting was exposed against an in-form bowling attack led by left-arm quick Marco Jansen, who returned figures of 4-22 from 3.5 overs. Keshav Maharaj took 3-24 with his left-arm spin.\n\nIndia's media tore into the team on Monday morning.\n\n\"The night the cloak came off,\" blazed a headline in the Indian Express newspaper.\n\n\"Sloppy India reach point of no return,\" said the Hindustan Times.\n\nIndia's ultra-aggressive left-handed opening pair have failed to fire, leaving a shaky middle order to pick up the pieces.\n\nIshan Kishan was out without scoring to Markram on Sunday, while the world's top- ranked T20 batter Abhishek Sharma fell to Jansen for 15, his only runs of the tournament so far after three ducks.\n\n\"It's certainly not panic stations,\" said Ten Doeschate, who hinted there could be discussions about India's batting line-up.\n\n\"If those guys (Ahbishek and Ishan) bat for six overs, the score is going to be 70-plus,\" said Ten Doeschate.\n\n\"So can we get them to temper the way they're playing and be a little bit smarter?\n\n\"Or do we just let them go on the way they are?\n\n\"Or do we bring in a right-hander at the top and make a change somewhere in the middle?\"\n\nCaptain Suryakumar Yadav agreed India need to use their brains in the first six-over power play when only two fielders are allowed on the boundary.\n\n\"Chasing 180-185, you can't win the game in the power play, but you might lose it,\" he said after his side stumbled to 31-3 after six overs, which became 43-4 a few balls later and then 51-5.\n\n\"We lost too many wickets in the power play.\"\n\nThe 2024 champions also have the weight of history against them. No team has ever retained the T20 World Cup and no side have ever won the trophy on home soil.",

It's an opportunity she's had for years, wrestling all over the world, but she's bringing it to local wrestlers here in North Texas, to show who they are and tell their story.\n\n\"When I started wrestling in Texas, there were only three girls in the state, and I didn't really have a lot of guidance,\" Athena said last year. \"I look at such a young generation now and the gap of experience level, from those of us that have traveled the world and those of us that are just getting started, and there's not a lot of crossover with that.\"\n\nFront row tickets to the show are sold out but second row and general admission tickets are still available here.",

    "fullText": "The two-time champions West Indies have looked confident and clinical in the shortest format, showcasing their trademark flair and aggressive style. Under the guidance of head coach Daren Sammy, the Caribbean side have spoken about creating their own slice of history, but consistency will be crucial as the competition intensifies.\n\nThe West Indies enter the match on the back of four consecutive wins, putting behind a disappointing run in bilateral series before the tournament. Shai Hope and Shimron Hetmyer have led the batting charge, while Jason Holder and Roston Chase have provided balance with their all-round skills. Romario Shepherd has also impressed with both bat and ball, particularly on Indian surfaces where he has IPL experience.\n\nZimbabwe, on the other hand, have been one of the biggest revelations of the tournament. The Sikandar Raza-led side have pulled off memorable victories over former world champions Australia and Sri Lanka, earning respect and recognition on the global stage. Young batter Brian Bennett has been their standout performer with the bat, while Blessing Muzarabani and Brad Evans have been among the leading wicket-takers in the competition.\n\nWith short boundaries and a batting-friendly pitch expected at the Wankhede Stadium, West Indies are likely to target a big-hitting approach, but Zimbabwe’s confidence and resilience suggest they are capable of pushing their opponents to the limit.\n\nWest Indies vs Zimbabwe T20 World Cup 2026 match: Live streaming details\n\nWhen will the West Indies vs Zimbabwe T20 World Cup 2026 match be played?\n\nThe West Indies vs Zimbabwe Super 8 match will be played on Monday, February 23, 2026.\n\nWhere will the West Indies vs Zimbabwe T20 World Cup 2026 match be played?\n\nThe match will take place at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai, India.\n\nWhat time will the West Indies vs Zimbabwe T20 World Cup 2026 match start?\n\nThe match is scheduled to begin at 7:00 PM IST, with the toss at 6:30 PM IST.\n\nWhich TV channels will broadcast the West Indies vs Zimbabwe T20 World Cup 2026 match?\n\nThe game will be broadcast live on the Star Sports Network in India.\n\nHow to watch live streaming of the West Indies vs Zimbabwe T20 World Cup 2026 match?\n\nFans can watch the live stream on the Jio Hotstar app and website.\n\nWhere can we follow the West Indies vs Zimbabwe T20 World Cup 2026 match online?\n\nLive ball-by-ball updates and coverage will be available on TimesofIndia.com.",

    "fullText": "With Mauricio Pochettino about three weeks from selecting the U.S. roster for March training camp and friendlies, a rush of good news concerning two players arrived a few hours apart Saturday:\n\nMidfielder Tyler Adams was on the field for the first time in more than two months and striker Ricardo Pepi was in uniform for the first time in six weeks.\n\nAdams, who recovered earlier than anticipated from a sprained knee ligament, started in Bournemouth’s 0-0 draw at West Ham, while Pepi, in uniform after recovering from a fractured forearm, scored a sensational goal as a second-half sub in PSV Eindhoven’s 3-1 triumph over Heerenveen.\n\nRicardo Pepi laat zich direct gelden bij zijn rentree 🎯👏#psvhee pic.twitter.com/z4UrAtaZkr\n\n— ESPN NL (@ESPNnl) February 21, 2026\n\nWith both back in the mix for national team duty next month — Adams is certain and Pepi is probable — Pochettino has, at the moment, almost his entire player pool available for selection.\n\nOnly midfielder Gio Reyna (muscular issue) and winger Alex Zendejas (adductor) have remained out for multiple weeks.\n\nAdams, the 2022 World Cup captain, missed 10 matches before suiting up at Everton on Feb. 10 — an absence of eight weeks instead of up to a feared three months. On Saturday, he logged 66 minutes, completed 41-of-45 passes and earned the second-best defensive statistics among players on both teams as eighth-place Bournemouth extended its Premier League unbeaten streak to seven.\n\nWith his left forearm well-protected, Pepi entered in the 76th minute and, after video replay negated his apparent goal, he rocketed a 25-yard shot in the 87th minute to stretch his Eredivisie scoring streak to six games. He increased his league total to nine and overall count to 12 in just 22 appearances.\n\nThe timing was ideal for the 23-year-old Texan, who, while injured, fell behind Coventry City’s Haji Wright and Derby County’s Patrick Agyemang on the U.S. depth chart behind No. 1 striker Folarin Balogun (Monaco).\n\n“Amazing feeling to be back!” Pepi posted on social media. “Thank you to all the PSV’ers for the warm support on my return.”\n\nPochettino plans to name his squad for next month’s camp March 17 ahead of friendlies in Atlanta against Belgium on March 28 and Portugal on March 31 — the last gathering before his World Cup decisions. He must submit a provisional list of between 35 and 55 players to FIFA by May 11 before announcing the 26-man squad on or about May 26.\n\nIt was quite a week for Balogun, who followed his two-goal performance against reigning European champion Paris Saint-Germain on Tuesday with a second-half goal that sparked Monaco’s three-goal uprising to shock Ligue 1 leader Lens, 3-2.\n\nHe increased his overall goal haul to 11: five in Ligue 1, five in the Champions League and one in the French Cup.\n\nMidfielder Tanner Tessmann (58 minutes) and third-place Lyon saw their 13-game winning streak across all competitions end with a 3-1 defeat at Strasbourg.\n\nRight back Tim Weah was Olympique Marseille’s best player from an analytical standpoint in a 2-0 loss at Brest, extending fourth-place OM’s overall slump to 1-3-2 heading into next Sunday’s critical home match against Lyon.\n\nToulouse center back Mark McKenzie served a yellow card suspension and missed the 1-1 draw with Paris FC.\n\nCenter back Chris Richards helped Crystal Palace register its second shutout in three Premier League matches, a 1-0 victory over last-place Wolverhampton, which played a man short for about a half-hour before conceding the goal.\n\nLeft back Antonee Robinson was held out of Fulham’s 3-1 triumph at Sunderland without an official explanation, his third consecutive league absence. He had played 90 last weekend in the FA Cup.\n\nMidfielder Brenden Aaronson (73 minutes) and Leeds earned their third straight away draw in Premier League play, a 1-1 result at Aston Villa.\n\nAfter productive matches in the English Championship last week, Wright and Agyemang were quiet. Wright played 71 minutes in a 2-0 victory at West Brom and Agyemang went 90 in a 2-0 loss at Watford.\n\nMidfielder Aidan Morris went 75 in Middlesbrough’s 0-0 draw with second-to-last Oxford, leaving his club three points behind first-place Coventry but six points ahead in the race for the second promotion to the Premier League.\n\nChristian Pulisic, who has been battling bursitis, returned to AC Milan’s lineup after three substitution appearances with a 62-minute effort and two quality scoring chances during a 1-0 home loss to Parma — its first loss in Serie A since the August opener, a stretch of 23 games.\n\nMidfielder Weston McKennie, who has been in tremendous form for Juventus this winter, played all of the 2-0 loss to Como, a result that stretched the Turin club’s winless rut to five games heading into the home leg of the Champions League affair with Galatasaray on Wednesday. (Juventus lost last week’s opener, 5-2.)\n\nMidfielder Yunus Musah remained on the bench for the seventh time in nine matches as Atalanta edged Napoli, 2-1. He has appeared in 14-of-26 Serie A matches with just three starts, totalling 447 minutes.\n\nIn Serie B, goalkeeper Jonathan Klinsmann has conceded 10 goals in three matches, the most recent setback coming in Cesena’s 3-2 loss to Spezia.\n\nMidfielder Malik Tillman played 81 minutes in Bayer Leverkusen’s 1-0 loss at Union Berlin, ending a seven-game unbeaten streak heading into the Champions League second leg Tuesday against Olympiacos. Leverkusen won the first leg, 2-0.\n\nTeenage center back Noahkai Banks (17th start) continued to impress at Augsburg, which used a late comeback to earn a 3-2 victory at Wolfsburg.\n\nReyna’s call-up hopes continued to dim after missing his fifth consecutive match for Mönchengladbach. Over two months, he has played just 28 minutes. Teammate Joe Scally, a right wing back, played the entire match.\n\nMidfielder James Sands’ run of 17 consecutive starts for St. Pauli across all competitions ended, but he entered in the 80th minute and helped seal a 2-1 victory over Werder Bremen, which lifted the Hamburg side out of the automatic relegation zone.\n\nIn the second division, left wing back John Tolkin (70 minutes) and Holstein Kiel lost at Karlsruher, 3-1 — their fifth consecutive loss overall.\n\nMidfielder Johnny Cardoso made his fifth consecutive La Liga start for Atlético Madrid, which defeated Espanyol, 4-2, to snap a three-game winless streak in league play.\n\nRight back Alex Freeman did not play in Villarreal’s 2-1 win over Valencia.\n\nWhile Pepi’s goal headlined the U.S. contributions for PSV Eindhoven, right back Sergiño Dest made his 22nd start as the league leaders continued to run away with the title, thanks to a 20-2-2 record and a plus-41 goal differential.\n\nCenter back Auston Trusty’s second red card in four weeks – for violent conduct in the 74th minute – imperiled Celtic, which conceded Hibernian’s late winner in the 2-1 outcome. He will miss next Sunday’s Old Firm clash against Rangers.\n\nOn opening weekend, three Vancouver players in the U.S. pool – center back Tristan Blackmon, midfielder Sebastian Berhalter and striker Brian White – played the whole match as the Whitecaps edged Real Salt Lake, 1-0. RSL midfielder Diego Luna sat out with a knee ailment.\n\nFive goalkeeping candidates started, led by Pochettino’s undisputed starter, New York City’s Matt Freese, who made five saves in a 1-1 draw against the L.A. Galaxy. The others were New England’s Matt Turner, Chicago’s Chris Brady, Columbus’ Patrick Schulte and Cincinnati’s Roman Celentano.\n\nCenter backs Tim Ream (Charlotte), Miles Robinson (Cincinnati) and Walker Zimmerman (Toronto) and left wing back Max Arfsten (Columbus) played every minute and midfielder Luca de la Torre (Charlotte) went 69.\n\nLos Angeles FC midfielder Timothy Tillman assisted during his 82-minute stint in the 3-0 home rout of Inter Miami before 75,673 at the Coliseum. Midfielder Cristian Roldan captained Seattle’s 2-0 win over Colorado.",

    "fullText": "In his 20-year career as a sports photopgraher, Simon Stacpoole has had moments when he had to remind himself it is a job.\n\n\"It's ridicuous at times when you're sitting there with the best seats in the house to some of the biggest sports events in the world, and you're being paid to be there.\"\n\nStacpoole from Nantwich, Cheshire, covers four football matches a week on average, and has taken pictures at four World Cup finals.\n\nHis favourite World Cup was Qatar 2022, he said, as seeing Lionel Messi a matter of feet away of him, sat on people's shoulders holding the trophy was a \"sight to behold.\"\n\nStacpoole started studying photography at school as a teenager, and realised he had a \"bit of an eye\" for a picture.\n\nA degree in the subject followed, and coming from a sporting family, he said combining photography and sport for a job \"made total sense.\"\n\nAfter two decades in freelancing for an agency, he still gets a buzz to see his images published.\n\n\"As a photographer, you want to see your pictures used big and in print.\"\n\nThe most nervous he has ever been in the job was the first Olympics he had been to, London 2012, and the night of the 100m final.\n\nStacpoole had recently lost his father, was full of pent up emotion and knew he had to nail the shot of Usain Bolt.\n\n\"I've got 9.5 seconds to get my act together, I was positioned just around the bend from the finishing line, you just have to wait for him to appear, just out of your blind spot.\"\n\n\"Before you know it, it's over, and fortunately it all worked out.\"\n\nHe said there were moments when you needed to \"sharpen your elbows a bit\" to get the best image at major sporting finals, but photographers respected each other, as they were all in the same boat.\n\nThe downsides of the job are spending so much time away from family and missing social events, as well as many hours on the road, he said.\n\n\"You could have one of those really bad games where you've had five goals up the wrong end of the pitch, I'm soaking wet, the motorway's closed on the way home.\"\n\n\"The classic combo that leaves you questioning your life choices sometimes.\"\n\nRead more Cheshire stories from the BBC and follow BBC Stoke & Staffordshire on BBC Sounds, Facebook, X and Instagram.",

    "fullText": "Braves' $7M injury prone fan favorite, World Series champion deemed unreliable, questioning future originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Atlanta Braves are officially underway with their 2026 Spring Training games, and there are still plenty of questions to be answered before Opening Day. One lingering question from last season was whether the Braves would bring back Ozzie Albies. Braves GM Alex Anthopoulos didn’t make that decision clear during the 2025 season.\n\n“With all these options (on players), we always make the decision at the end of the year — you have five days after the World Series, and that’s when you make the decision. It’s just, things can happen, things change. You always wait,” Anthopoulos said.\n\nThe Braves ended their season in disappointment, but the organization was quick to resolve Albies’ future. They opted to bring back their fan favorite and the player who has consistently been the best at his position for the team.\n\n“The Braves are going to pick up their club option on infielder Ozzie Albies. The club hasn’t announced the decision yet, but president of baseball operations Alex Anthopoulos confirmed the move in a radio appearance, per Mark Zinno of 92.9 The Game,” Steve Adams wrote for MLB Trade Rumors.\n\nHowever, heading into the regular season, if Albies’ injuries continue, he could become a liability for the Braves.\n\n“Even really good players can become liabilities in one form or another. That doesn't take away from the player they were, but it should inform the Braves' decisions and fans' perception that some guys can't be trusted in certain roles anymore,” HTHB’s Eric Cole wrote. “It was kind of a fun bit for a few years there, where the national media just continually disrespected Ozzie Albies despite the fact that he was among the best second basemen in all of baseball. However, what first looked like just some rough injury luck has become a pattern, and it is now completely fair to call him injury-prone and wonder about his future with the Braves.”\n\nThe Braves are extremely grateful for what Albies has contributed to the organization, but his injuries have also put the team in difficult situations. This season is a must-prove year for the star infielder.\n\nIf Atlanta wants to be successful, they need Albies on the field. If he can’t stay healthy, he risks letting down the Braves faithful once again. There was once a time when it was believed the Braves would have no hesitation keeping Albies for his entire career, but injuries have cast uncertainty over that future.",

    "description": "While Shield AI is looking into weapons for the V-BAT, the world's best militaries already have a slew of other strike options, Brandon Tseng told BI.",
    "fullText": "Brandon Tseng, Shield AI's cofounder, said there's a common misconception about his company's signature software-powered drone: People say it needs to be armed.\n\nThe more experienced militaries who work with Shield AI, however, know they don't need that capability in modern war, Tseng told Business Insider.\n\n\"Who doesn't ask for that? The US military doesn't ask for that because we understand joint fires. The Ukrainians don't ask for it anymore, either,\" said the former Navy SEAL, who is Shield AI's president.\n\nThe V-BAT, a vertical takeoff and landing drone that uses artificial intelligence to fly in jammed environments, has primarily been used for intelligence and reconnaissance missions in high-profile conflict zones such as Ukraine. Shield AI said the V-BAT flew over 200 missions there in 2025.\n\nThe drone is still meant to be a multi-mission platform, Tseng said, and Shield AI has been exploring ways to mount weapons on it. The firm announced a partnership last month with South Korean arms manufacturer LIG Nex1 to equip the V-BAT with six-pound guided missiles.\n\n\"But at the end of the day, look: I describe V-BAT as a mini predator, reaper drone,\" Tseng said. \"That's the mission it's doing, which is: It's finding targets. And it's hard to find targets, you have to be out there for a long period of time.\"\n\nTo be fair, the MQ-9 Reaper is also commonly equipped with missiles.\n\nHowever, Tseng said sophisticated militaries already have a vast array of other weapons that can turn the V-BAT's intel into a precision strike.\n\n\"If you have been in these combat zones, the US allies who fought closely with us in Afghanistan, they do not ask for organic fires on board the V-Bat,\" Tseng said. \"Because everybody is so used to just saying: 'Okay, I have a targeting package. What fires asset do I have lined up? Is it a one-way attack drone? Is it HIMARS? Is it artillery? Is it an SM-6? SM-3?\"\n\n\"Doesn't matter. You can find weapons,\" he added. \"The weapons are available. You need, actually, more intelligence.\"\n\nThis was a framework that Ukraine still needed to improve when the V-BAT began spotting targets there in early 2024, Tseng said. The drone is meant to fly for over 13 hours and be easily deployable, requiring a two-person launch crew and no runway.\n\nTseng said that while Ukraine excelled in tactical drone warfare, its troops weren't used to having a long-range asset that could spot targets for regular strategic attacks as the US military did.\n\n\"The strategic effects would happen, but they would be rare,\" he said. \"They'd be very, very deliberately planned operations, very expensive operations, things like what they did to the Russian runways with sending quadcopters deep into Russia via trucks.\"\n\nUkrainian drone teams would use the V-BAT to find important targets, such as Russian S-300 and S-400 air defense systems, only to realize they hadn't linked up with the right teams to strike them, Tseng said.\n\n\"We'd say: 'Why didn't you guys have these weapons lined up?' They'd say: 'Oh, well, we didn't think to coordinate,'\" Tseng said.\n\nSince then, Kyiv's forces have been using intelligence from V-BATs to carry out strikes with systems such as one-way attack drones or US-made HIMARS, Tseng said.\n\n\"There was a lot of learning over the past year for the Ukrainians,\" he added.",

    "description": "Cardiac arrhythmias are a major cause of morbidity and mortality increasing the risk of stroke, heart failure, and sudden cardiac death. Imageless electrocardiographic imaging (ECGI) provides a non invasive alternative to electrical mapping from body surface potentials, but conventional ECGI is confined to epicardial reconstructions and can miss arrhythmias originating in deeper myocardium. We address this by reconstructing three dimensional cardiac activity with a volumetric formulation that solves an inverse source problem via Green's functions, enabling full volume activation mapping and improved localization in anatomically complex regions. We evaluate the approach on simulated premature ventricular beats and on four challenging patient cases, a right ventricular outflow tract premature ventricular contraction, a left bundle branch block, a ventricular tachycardia, and Wolff Parkinson White, and additionally assess performance on an open source myocardial infarction dataset. Results show that volumetric ECGI recovers 3D activation and sharpens arrhythmia origin localization, achieving a 59.",

    "description": "On Saturday night, the MMA world leader returned to Paramount+ with a new UFC Fight Night card in Houston, TX. […]",
    "fullText": "On Saturday night, the MMA world leader returned to Paramount+ with a new UFC Fight Night card in Houston, TX. On the event’s main card, top 15 heavyweights Serghei Spivac and Ante Delija went toe-to-toe, looking to move up in the UFC heavyweight rankings.\n\nSpivac ended up getting the decision win after a violent and back-and-forth war. Let’s look at how his victory changed our latest UFC heavyweight rankings.\n\nSerghei Spivac has remained a consistent top-15-level fighter at heavyweight for the last five years. While he has lost six times inside the Octagon, his most recent setbacks have come to elite competition like Tom Aspinall, Waldo Cortes-Acosta, and Ciryl Gane. However, he also has quite a few big wins against big-name or ranked foes.\n\nHe scored another in February when he earned a very hard-fought win over talented finisher Ante Delija. His latest win stopped a potential losing skid and got him back in our top 10.\n\nFormer Brave CF star Shamil Gaziev has put together a notable run in the division. Although a doctor stoppage in 2024 gave him his first loss, the Dagestani big man is 3-1 in the Octagon, including two nasty knockouts. Gaziev is a rising heavyweight fighter to keep an eye on. However, he took a big risk in November when he okay’d a short-notice fight with Waldo Cortes Acosta. The decision backfired, and he suffered a stinging knockout loss.\n\nPFL and Contender Series veteran Rizvan Kuniev lands in our UFC heavyweight rankings after he scored the biggest win of his career with a hard-fought victory over Jailton Almeida in February. While it wasn’t pretty, he proved he can compete with top-10 talent. He will need a definitive W in his next fight if he wants to hold on to a spot in our latest rankings.\n\nMarcin Tubura has quietly been a mainstay of the UFC heavyweight rankings over the last half-decade. While he owns a 14-8 record in the company, he has grown immensely as a fighter in the last few years. He is 10-3 in his last 12, with his only losses coming to elite talents Alexander Volkov, Serghei Spivac, and current interim heavyweight king Tom Aspinall.\n\nIn March, he picked up a hard-fought win over Aspinall’s trainer partner and one of the better rising prospects in the division, Mick Parkin.\n\nSergei Pavlovich has been an absolute crushing machine during much of his UFC career. After a loss to Alistair Overeem in his debut, he reeled off six straight wins, and all of those victories came by way of a devastating knockout. However, a two-fight losing streak stopped all of his momentum. But he has righted the ship in 2025 and scored a pair of decision wins. The most recent was against Waldo Cortes-Acosta in Shanghai.\n\nDominican big man Waldo Cortes Acosta has quietly become a serious force in the heavyweight division. In his 12 bouts inside the Octagon, he has posted 10 wins, including against some notable talents in the top 15. The latest came in January at UFC 324 against fan-favorite Derrick Lewis.\n\n“Salsa Boy” showed why he is one of the more athletic and polished strikers in the division when he added a two-time challenger to his hit list inside the Octagon.\n\nWhile there have been some very tough losses in the career of Curtis Blaydes, he has remained a top-five level heavyweight for much of the last decade. At UFC 299, he had an opportunity to finally right his big-fight wrongs and did so in a major way when he handed Jailton Almeida his first loss in the Octagon.\n\nThe win moved “Razor” into a UFC 304 title fight against Tom Aspinall. Unfortunately, his big fight curse returned, and after a strong start suffered a TKO loss in Round 1. At UFC Baku, the talented wrestler returned and was able to grind out a hard-fought win over Rizvan Kuniev. But the victory did little to get him back into title contention.\n\nAlexander Volkov has been a top-level MMA heavyweight for a long time. While he has been unable to earn a UFC title shot, he has remained a stalwart of the top 10 for years. To many who watched UFC 310, he scored a victory against Ciryl Gane that should have earned him a title. However, the judges did not score it his way, and he suffered a crushing defeat to the Frenchman.\n\nIn October, he bounced back from the setback to get himself right back into title contention by scoring a very hard-fought split-decision win over top-five talent Jailton Almeida.\n\nCiryl Gane is a fantastic athlete and the most technical heavyweight striker in the sport. It is why he is consistently in the title discussion. However, his wrestling deficiencies continue to be a problem, and they showed up again in his UFC 310 clash with Alexander Volkov. Fortunately for “Bon Gamin,” he was able to escape with a decision win.\n\nThe victory earned him a title opportunity at UFC 321. However, the good luck he had against Volkov turned to bad, and his chance at winning UFC gold again was stopped after just a few minutes when he poked champ Tom Aspinall in both eyes and caused a fight-ending no-contest.\n\nEnglishman Tom Aspinall is the best heavyweight in the UFC. That became official when MMA GOAT Jon Jones decided to walk away from the sport earlier this year. The Englishman has beaten many of the best fighters in the division for the last three years and is the undisputed top big man in the eyes of most UFC fans.\n\nAfter definitively avenging the lone loss of his UFC career in the summer of 2024, he made his first defense of the undisputed title in October. Unfortunately, a nasty eye poke from opponent Ciryl Game ended the UFC 321 main event after just a few minutes. An immediate rematch early in 2026 seems likely.\n\nNew UFC Middleweight Rankings: Is Strickland vs. Chimaev Next After UFC Houston?\n\nComplete UFC Fight Night Results & Highlights: Sean Strickland Dominates In Bounce Back Win\n\nRonda Rousey Explains Why TKO Being Cheap Killed Plans For Return Fight in UFC",

    "fullText": "MILAN (AP) — The first female president in the International Olympic Committee’s 132 years got a proper stress test in the first games of her history-making leadership.\n\nKirsty Coventry was widely seen as having good overall success at the Milan Cortina Winter Games that also gave a taste of challenges set to be tougher running into the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.\n\n“An incredible games, and an incredible experience for me as my first in this role,” she told IOC colleagues Sunday.\n\nCoventry insisted in Milan pre-games that “our game is sport,” yet playing politics was inevitable.\n\nShe started the Winter Games building “very good chemistry” with U.S. Vice President JD Vance — who was booed at the opening ceremony — and had seemed likely to close it with U.S. President Donald Trump, who she has not yet met. He did not travel as many expected for Sunday's men’s ice hockey final that the U.S. won.\n\nIn between, political pressure on Coventry was intense during the days-long drama of the Ukraine skeleton racer’s helmet memorializing athletes and coaches killed in the Russian military invasion.\n\nCoventry’s face-to-face, trackside meeting with Vladyslav Heraskevych early Feb. 12 that failed to avert his disqualification has helped define her leadership style.\n\nHer tears in a subsequent meeting with international media is a powerful image of her presidency — though Heraskevych himself wasn't impressed.\n\nThe next day, at a news conference in Milan, a list was detailed to Coventry of IOC issues with its own finances, plus future Olympic hosts, their officials and governments.\n\n“It’s a job only a woman could do,” she said with relish, “and I’m looking forward to continuing to do it.”\n\nThe Ukrainian political strategy had been “a baptism of fire” for the new president, the former IOC marketing director Michael Payne told The Associated Press on Sunday.\n\nCoventry going directly to engage Heraskevych in sports diplomacy was a shift from her predecessors Thomas Bach and Jacques Rogge, who also were Olympic athletes.\n\nAt age 42, having swum for Zimbabwe as recently as the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics, Coventry is just 13 months older than a huge star at these games, Lindsey Vonn.\n\n“We saw at these games her values and her humanity,” IOC member Tricia Smith, a silver medalist in rowing for Canada at the 1984 Los Angeles Games, told The Associated Press. “And I think that’s exceptionally positive for the Olympic Movement as we move forward.”\n\nThe 72-year-old Bach sat next to Coventry again Sunday at the IOC’s meeting: He in suit and tie, she in smart casual knitwear that is becoming her signature look.\n\nThe generational change is clear for the Olympics, which wants and needs to stay relevant with athletes who are increasingly their own tech-savvy brands.\n\nAfter seven years as sports minister in the government of Zimbabwe, Coventry was no management rookie.\n\nOne of her four IOC vice presidents, Pierre-Olivier Beckers, said in Milan that people who had thought she was too young to lead were wrong.\n\n“I think she’s maturing at an incredible pace,” Beckers told reporters, adding she was “a joy for people like me to work with. Her ability to surround herself, to listen to people, all advisors, to make up her mind quickly, is just astonishing.”\n\nOne aspect of Coventry's management style that drew negative reactions, online and in Milan, was criticizing staff in her last set-piece media event Friday.\n\nCoventry is one of the more transparent leaders among the Olympic sports bodies mostly based in Switzerland. She had four scheduled news conferences in Milan within 20 days, plus an impromptu media session after meeting Heraskevych.\n\nOn Friday, she publicly lost patience when asked about news developments that she said she was unaware of — on the topics of Russian doping, an Olympic bid from Germany, and FIFA president Gianni Infantino attending Trump's Board of Peace launch Thursday.\n\nClearly frustrated, Coventry eventually said “maybe someone needs to be dismissed because I’m not aware of that either” and asked of her media team: \"What happened guys? Where are we?”\n\nCoventry has a big 2026 with signature policy to be decided under the “Fit for the Future” banner. Reviews are ongoing into how the IOC picks games hosts, Olympic sports and sponsor programs, plus protecting female sports.\n\nKey meetings are in the IOC's Swiss home city Lausanne on June 24-25 with more likely late in the year.\n\nThe next Olympics is a constant focus. There is a pressing issue around L.A. Games organizing chief Casey Wasserman, that was persistent in Milan over news of his historic ties to Jeffrey Epstein’s former girlfriend, and Coventry will soon need to meet Trump.\n\n“She can leave (Milan) with a massive sigh of relief. The brand is in robust health,” Payne said Sunday.\n\nHe warned of more politicization of Olympic sports worldwide before the next Olympics in the United States. The IOC winning the appeal brought by Heraskevych will help set limits on how athletes express views.\n\n“L.A. will be a completely different dimension,” Payne said. “It’s going to be complicated, to put it mildly.”\n\nAP Winter Olympics coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics",

    "fullText": "T20 World Cup, Super 8s Group 2, Pallekele\n\nEngland 146-9 (20 overs): Salt 62 (40), Jacks 21 (14); Wellalage 3-26,\n\nSri Lanka 95 (16.4 overs): Shanaka 30 (24); Jacks 3-22\n\nA superb bowling performance breathed life into England's T20 World Cup campaign as Harry Brook's side beat co-hosts Sri Lanka by 51 runs in their opening match of the Super 8s phase.\n\nEngland remained unconvincing with the bat in posting 146-9 but their bowlers took full advantage of a tricky surface to knock over their hosts for 95.\n\nJofra Archer dismissed key batter Pathum Nissanka and fellow opener Kamil Mishara but even more impressive were the three wickets for all-rounder Will Jacks inside the powerplay.\n\nJacks, who has struggled with the ball at times in this tournament, removed Kusal Mendis and Pavan Rathnayake in consecutive deliveries and added the scalp of Dunith Wellalage as Sri Lanka crumbled to 34-5 under the pressure of a chase.\n\nAfter Kamindu Mendis chipped back a catch to Liam Dawson and Dushan Hemantha hit his own wicket, Jacks combined with Tom Banton to complete a fine relay catch on the boundary to dismiss Dasun Shanaka, Sri Lanka's captain and the last recognised batter, for 30.\n\nThat England's batting remains far from perfect is pushed to another day. Jos Buttler made a tortured seven from 14 balls, Jacob Bethell fell to a wild slog and Tom Banton ran himself out.\n\nPhil Salt's 62 and 21 from Jacks, who was the next highest scorer in a fine all-round display, were crucial.\n\nEngland play Pakistan on Tuesday and New Zealand on Friday in their remaining Super 8s matches.\n\nOne win should be enough to qualify for the semi-finals.\n\nSalt and Jacks dragged England to a score but Sri Lanka still appeared favourites at halfway.\n\nThough England defended 128 on this ground in a series before the World Cup, Sri Lanka chased 182 with two overs to spare to beat Australia here in the group stage.\n\nThis surface was trickier than that one. Its sticky nature and decent turn offered assistance to the spinners and Jacks capitalised.\n\nAfter conceding four from an accurate first over, Jacks got one to grip to take the leading edge of Mendis. Rathnayake charged him a ball later and was caught skying a hideous swipe.\n\nBrook also used Archer for three consecutive overs at the start.\n\nArcher bowled at high pace and had Nissanka, who scored a brilliant hundred against Australia, caught at deep square leg before finding the edge of Mishara.\n\nHemantha's dismissal – he hit his stumps with his bat flapping at Jamie Overton – summed up a poor Sri Lanka batting display, not that England will care.\n\nAfter nervy wins over Nepal, Scotland and Italy in the group stage, they are closing in on a place in the last four.\n\nStill we wait for England's batting to truly fire at this tournament.\n\nWith his feet stuck and best form seeming distant, Buttler missed three deliveries and toe-ended another before being pinned in front by Wellalage's left-arm spin on the reverse sweep.\n\nOnly 37 runs came from the powerplay, with Bethell caught at short third trying to hit Maheesh Theekshana over mid-wicket.\n\nAs the pressure to score rose, Banton took on a single that was never there and Brook was trapped tentatively on the crease for 14.\n\nThe highest partnership of the match was 26 between Salt and Sam Curran. Battling cramp from the ninth over, Salt did not find top gear and Curran holed out at long-on\n\nJacks targeted the off side smartly and struck four important fours and Overton clubbed a six in the last over.\n\nThere remains room for improvement but England's tactic of favouring batting depth - Jacks was at number seven and Overton nine here – is proving to be smart as the top order struggles.\n\nT20 World Cup: England complete convincing win over Sri Lanka - as it happened\n\nTMS podcast: Bowlers bail out England as they beat Sri Lanka\n\nIs Buttler's form a worry?

    "fullText": "In his latest BBC Sport column, England World Cup winner Matt Dawson discusses what went wrong in England's record home defeat by Ireland and what areas could be improved for the final two rounds.\n\nRemember two years ago when England were going to get beaten at home by 40 points against Ireland?\n\nThe narrative in this tournament rarely plays out as expected. Teams overperform and sides crack under pressure. That is the beauty of the Six Nations.\n\nThat predicted thumping in 2024 never happened. Instead, England stunned Grand Slam-chasing Ireland with the last play of the game to win 23-22.\n\nRoll on two years, when expectations were much lower, and Ireland delivered that record away win.\n\nAndy Farrell's side arrived with the mentality to deliver a historic victory, bringing the tactics and accuracy needed to win.\n\nThe 21-point difference at Allianz Stadium came down to tactics and decision-making. England made a load of mistakes, and some of that came down to trying to play the match like a game of chess.\n\nThe issue with doing that is that they could not change on the hoof how they wanted to play.\n\nThe tactical battle between coaches Andy Farrell and Steve Borthwick was won by Farrell, but England need players on the field who are able to change tactics as they go.\n\nThey have struggled with sticking to the script instructed to them by Borthwick, with any changes then being delivered at half-time.\n\nGiven the talent and winning run, I was expecting England to adapt better.\n\nWhy do teams play with a high tempo against them? Because England are good.\n\nIt looked like they thought another team could not replicate Scotland's attacking play from last week.\n\nIt was very unlike England, but that is what happens when you get stressed.\n\nThey lacked the senior Lions mentality to get out of sticky situations. Over the last two weeks, where were those decision-makers?\n\nThe defence and attack needed adjusting in the first quarter. They waited 40 minutes and had conceded 22 points.\n\nEngland have good leadership, but Maro Itoje - who will only get better with more minutes under his belt - cannot do it all on his own.\n\nHe wants the leaders around him to step up in their roles, especially given he is not finishing games at the moment.\n\nSomeone like Ollie Chessum can jump in with an idea of how to fix the line-out. Freddie Steward, who can see the flow of the game from the back, could offer input on where the space to attack is.\n\nThe squad has not changed from the 12-game winning run. They are a group of very good rugby players.\n\nEllis Genge was honest and brave in his assessment, but I do not feel let down by England.\n\nThey are capable of winning in Rome and Paris.\n\nThe loss should not be the reason for a load of changes for the Italy game, as Borthwick's continuity in selection is what brought success.\n\nDespite a rest week coming, a three-game block of games is very taxing and England have the depth available.\n\nI would freshen up the half-backs and bring in Fin Smith and Jack van Poortvliet.\n\nAlex Mitchell's injury may open that door for Van Poortvliet, but I want to give a new opportunity to key decision-makers in an away Six Nations game.\n\nSmith is a confident player and, having been England's starting 10 in last year's Six Nations, he will want to prove his ability to adapt in-game.\n\nFull-back George Furbank is another intelligent player who can spot space in attack, and I want to see him as he will also be chomping at the bit to prove his worth.\n\nI would then go Tom Roebuck and Henry Arundell on the wings. A free-flowing game in Rome suits their attacking attributes.\n\nThe back row, too, I felt lacked some balance against Ireland.\n\nBringing Henry Pollock and all his energy off the bench is a play that I would go back to.\n\nA new outlook and perspective from players who have been outside the pressure cooker may well bring long-term benefits.\n\nSix Nations fixtures, results, standings and how to follow on the BBC\n\nIs Borthwick under pressure after nightmare defeat?\n\nRuthless Ireland hit record away win over England\n\nRuthless Ireland beat England, & Scotland come back in Cardiff\n\nNow the narrative is that they did not win big away games in 2025. They beat what was in front of them, and they have proved themselves to be a good side.\n\nLike a good golfer, they are tinkering that bit too much. That has enormous ramifications.\n\nThe progress up until the Scotland game was good enough for a World Cup, but they are trying lots of different things that they do not need at the moment.\n\nOff the back of a tough 2024, England used being the underdog to their advantage.\n\nThey won in Argentina with a young squad and beat New Zealand in November. It becomes trickier when you are known to be one of the top sides.\n\nEngland were getting into that bracket as they blew Wales away, and the rest of the Six Nations knew they were going to have to come up with something superhuman to beat them.\n\nThat is exactly what has happened, and Borthwick's side must deal better with higher expectations.\n\nThe pressure is also different, as every breath for the past month has been about the Six Nations and possibly winning it. That is draining and tiring.\n\nFinding the energy as an underdog to play above yourself is easier than finding that spark within yourself when you are expected to win.\n\nEvery single year you will get these types of results, and that will not change.\n\nIt is not out of the question that England go to Paris and beat France. What is the narrative then?\n\nNothing said Ireland could win against them by 20-odd points - and it happened.",

I confess to using both of these programs, but I’ve noticed that, well, it’s as if they’re trying to please, with statements like “You’re absolutely right, Jeff,” and “That’s pretty much right.” Often, when I ask, “Would you mind thinking for a bit longer on that?”, I then get another response saying: “Jeff, you’re absolutely right, again, to query that result. It turns out I was a bit hasty in my reply …”\n\nIf the world runs even more on information filleted out from the sump of the internet by LLMs, what are the consequences? Can we look forward to a future in which AI is more concerned with appearing sympathetic (getting good reviews?) than being factual? Er, a bit too human?

We're pumped for the bowling crew, they've been working hard. The partnership [between Miller and Brevis] steadied the ship and kept us in the game. We looked at where we could run hard and our batting in the middle was the difference.\n\n\"We're going to have to enjoy this but park it and get our minds sharp [to face West Indies]. We don't want to take confidence and good vibes for granted.\"\n\nIndia captain Suryakumar Yadav: \"You can't win the game in the powerplay, but you can lose it. We lost too many wickets in the powerplay.\n\n\"Hopefully we bat well, bowl well and field well [against Zimbabwe]. I hope we play the same brand of cricket, nothing changes.\"\n\nTest Match Special commentator Prakash Wakankar: \"You see the satisfaction but also the steely determination on the faces of the South Africa players. Right from the toss, there wasn't the customary smile from Markram, who was very serious and focused.\n\n\"The disappointment from the captain after getting out really said a lot. It clearly shows that South Africa came here with a plan and executed it with ruthlessness to deliver a result that will be very, very well received by their supporters.\"\n\nT20 World Cup: South Africa complete impressive win over India - as it happened\n\nHow South Africa conquered Test cricket in 2025\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

Brook took two wickets.\n\nFour years later they were roommates with the Under-19s and now Jacks is keeping Brook's first World Cup campaign as captain afloat.\n\nWhen this tournament began with questions around Brook's suitability to be captain after off-field controversy in Wellington, it was Jacks who was put forward to speak to the media to defend his mate.\n\nAgainst Nepal, the right-hander hit 39 not out, without which England would have suffered one of the great World Cup shocks, and his first T20 fifty against Italy, a powerful 53 not out, pushed a tight game out of the reach of the Italians in their valiant chase.\n\nHis 21 with the bat and three wickets with the ball against Sri Lanka was another gift for Brook, coming on the captain's 27th birthday.\n\nEngland now sit one win from a World Cup semi-final.\n\n\"He is a very competitive lad,\" said Brook. \"He was annoyed when he got out tonight.\n\n\"After his first over he said 'I always bowl better when I am annoyed'. That was one of the reasons I kept him on.\n\n\"He is that perfect player. He is the Jack of all trades who can do everything.\"\n\nJacks' Ashes was not all fairytale proposals below Sydney Harbour Bridge.\n\nOff the field, he was one of the England players plastered across the front page of the Australian newspapers with a pint in hand in Noosa.\n\nOn it, he struggled with his two wickets in the third Test against Australia in Adelaide costing 212 runs. Across the series he took six wickets for 394 runs.\n\nJacks' stubborn batting in Australia did show a side of his game that hinted at promise and now he is thriving as England's T20 man for all seasons.\n\nBacked by Brook on Sunday he was asked to open the bowling for England for the first time since a match against Australia in Barbados at the last T20 World Cup.\n\nThat day, after what Jos Buttler later described as a \"gut feel\", Aussie opener Travis Head – the man who cut and pulled him into submission in Adelaide – sent him onto the Kensington Oval roof in an over that cost 22 runs. England's campaign never recovered.\n\nThis time his opening over cost only four, even that a boundary courtesy of a misfield.\n\nBrook said it was a \"last-minute\" decision to give Jacks the new ball, the logic being that with a shorter boundary to the left-handed Kamil Mishara's leg side it was better to have Jacks' off-spin turning the ball away.\n\nTypically, after that good first over, Jacks dismissed two right-handers in his next – the dangerous Kusal Mendis poking and chipping back a catch and Pavan Rathnayake charging and slicing a catch high to the off-side ring.\n\n\"Rathnayake's been a very good player for them, and probably their best player of spin - the way that he runs down the pitch,\" Brook said.\n\n\"To get him out first ball was a very crucial part in the game for us.\"\n\nControl was something often lacking with Jacks' off-spin during the winter but here he delivered his most accurate spell.\n\nBowling four overs on the spin, he pitched 91% of his deliveries on the stumps or in the channel - the highest of any England match of his career.\n\nHis only bad ball, one which slipped from his sweaty hand, was pulled for six by Dasun Shanaka but later Jacks got his revenge by being the initial catcher in a brilliant relay grab with Tom Banton.\n\nIf his first three wickets put England on course for victory, the dismissal of Shanaka confirmed it.\n\n\"I love getting the responsibility with the ball,\" Jacks said.\n\n\"It encourages me to get into the game and perform better.\n\n\"[Opening the bowling] is not foreign for me. And with a surface like that, I come in knowing what to do.\"\n\nJacks has been given the nickname of Slim Shady by some England players during this tournament – a reference to his pre-tournament haircut and bleached blond hair. In the dressing room he has even been asked to rap.\n\nBrook appears happy with his Jack of all trades. He is keeping this winter rolling on.\n\nEngland bowlers secure crucial win over Sri Lanka\n\nMen's T20 World Cup tables, top run-scorers & wicket-takers\n\nStats battle: Can you beat our new T20 World Cup game?",

    "fullText": "It has been a while since Welsh rugby fans have woken up on a Sunday morning after a rugby international feeling agony and hope in equal measure.\n\nBut that is what happened this weekend after Wales' excruciating 26-23 Six Nations defeat against Scotland in Cardiff.\n\nThe agony represents Wales losing - after leading 20-5 and 23-12 - to a Scotland side that only held the advantage for the final six minutes of the game.\n\nThe hope comes from Wales producing the finest performance of the Steve Tandy era, one that shows what could be possible.\n\nYes, it was a 24th defeat in 26 internationals since October 2023 and a 14th successive Six Nations loss in a record stretching back three years.\n\nYes, Wales have slipped to 12th in the world rankings and are still facing another Wooden Spoon with matches to follow against a rejuvenated Ireland and then Italy.\n\nAnd the off-the-field disarray that has engulfed Welsh rugby still exists and will continue to rumble on in the coming weeks.\n\nHowever, for a couple of hours on Saturday evening in the Principality Stadium, in a magically mad occasion against the Scots, the Wales team and fans recreated the epic experience that has been on show so often in the past.\n\nAnd offered hope of what it could look like again in the future.\n\nWales' late loss 'gut-wrenching' - Lake\n\nScotland show 'bottle' & 'grit' in 'ugly' Cardiff win\n\n'Scotland's terrible beauty reverses the narrative on extraordinary day'\n\nFor the opening hour, Wales finally had some attacking momentum with ball-carriers powering over the gain line.\n\nFront-row duo Rhys Carre and captain Dewi Lake had arguably their most effective games for Wales, while Scarlets centre Eddie James provided the midfield momentum with a series of thundering charges in what could prove a coming-of-age performance.\n\nThen there was Aaron Wainwright. The Dragons talisman was immense for a second successive week, continuing his terrific tournament, despite Wales' adversity.\n\nThe back rower has played two games at number eight and featured at blind-side flanker against France.\n\nNo matter where he has been asked to play, Wainwright has consistently been Wales' most effective performer and was the highest carrier with 22 against Scotland, five more than Lake.\n\nThe attacking intent was orchestrated expertly by returning fly-half Sam Costelow, who excelled after replacing Dan Edwards.\n\nCostelow being helped off the field injured in the second half was one of the saddest sights of the day.\n\nWales' defence was still not perfect and they will need a separate specialist coach after the tournament so Tandy is not having to undertake two roles.\n\nBut it was a significant improvement on the 15 tries and 102 points conceded in the opening two heavy defeats against England and France.\n\nIn Tandy's first six games in charge Wales yielded 302 points and 42 tries.\n\nAdd 26 points and four more tries against Scotland - but it was a commendable effort against the wave of Scottish second-half attacks.\n\nIndustrious locks Dafydd Jenkins and Ben Carter, in his first Six Nations start after replacing Adam Beard, topped the tackle charts with 22 each.\n\nForaging flankers Alex Mann and James Botham managed to gain some turnover penalties, which had been sorely lacking in the first two matches.\n\nWing Josh Adams was outstanding in the opening exchanges with a telling try-saving tackle on Huw Jones and vital interception.\n\nAdams' continued selection has received criticism but in an inexperienced backline, what was evident was the amount of organising and communication he was providing, especially in defence.\n\nEnglish referee Matt Carley was officiating in his 50th international and his name popped up quite prominently on social media after the game by Welsh fans who felt hard done by.\n\nThey pointed to a number of decisions which they felt could have gone Wales' way.\n\nThis included Scotland number eight Matt Fagerson being offside and obstructing Wales replacement prop Archie Griffin in the build-up to George Turner's match-winning try from a driving maul.\n\nSome Welsh fans, and former Wales fly-half Jonathan Davies, also felt there was a harsh penalty reversal for a Tomos Williams' illegal clearout at a ruck, when Wales could have kicked three points to extend the lead to seven.\n\nTandy afterwards said he thought that decision was a fair call and refused to blame any decisions for Wales' defeat.\n\nAfter all, Scotland won the second half 21-6 and were the dominant attacking force after half-time.\n\nThe major issue Wales will look at will be concentration for the Darcy Graham try.\n\nIt was inspired by a moment of magic from Finn Russell who capitalised on Wales sleeping in defence from a restart.\n\nThe blame cannot lie with the ball boy or girl who efficiently presented the ball on the halfway line for Russell to kick off quickly.\n\nThey were merely doing their job, while Wales' players were not.\n\nWhether the blame lies with Botham, who watched a ball bounce over his left shoulder, or new cap Gabriel Hamer-Webb who was outpaced by Darcy, will be decided in the post-match review.\n\nWhoever shoulders the responsibility, it proved a major turning point in the game as it reduced the deficit to four points and enabled the visitors to dominate the final quarter.\n\nTandy will also be looking for more impact from his bench after the second-half replacements, prop Nicky Smith aside, failed to match the intensity of the starting side.\n\nThis is compared to Scotland, whose introduced players contributed significantly to the victory.\n\nWales' discipline is still an issue with centre Joe Hawkins picking up a yellow card for an early high tackle, an 11th sin-binning in seven games during Tandy's tenure.\n\nHowever, that is progress from the 16 penalties and four yellow cards conceded just three weeks ago against England.\n\nWales also need to utilise to fins an effective way of maximising Louis Rees Zammit's attacking ability after his switch from wing to full-back.\n\nThe Principality Stadium crowd of 57,744 against France, the lowest in Cardiff in the Six Nations era was criticised. Rightly so.\n\nSix days later, the Cardiff cauldron was completely different as 70,000 witnessed a scintillating spectacle on and off the field.\n\nSome of that was down to Wales' marked improvement, with the home fans starved of any success or expectation during the past couple of years.\n\nAfter all, Wales have now suffered 11 successive Six Nations defeats in Cardiff with the most recent success against Scotland four years ago in February 2022.\n\nBut Wales, led by the inspirational Lake, got the Principality Stadium rocking.\n\n\"The support was incredible,\" said Tandy.\n\n\"There's lots of questions asked about the crowds, but they were unbelievable.\n\n\"Everyone felt it. The players gave them something to cheer about, but ultimately they got behind the team. It's a snapshot of what we want to be.\"\n\nThe challenge, for everybody involved in Welsh rugby, will be to replicate this environment in the final game of the tournament against Italy on 14 March.\n\nThe match has the same early evening kick-off as the Scotland showdown.\n\nThis past weekend cannot be a one-off if Wales are to be inspired to that overdue and elusive Six Nations success in front of their own fans.",

    "description": "That's the third leader from the Kingdom of God Global Church alleged to be part of a sprawling forced labor and money laundering scheme.",
    "fullText": "A federal grand jury in Michigan has indicted a third defendant in an alleged forced labor conspiracy tied to the Kingdom of God Global Church — a sprawling ministry that prosecutors say used coercion, abuse and threats of divine punishment to run a multi-state call center operation that brought in roughly $50 million in donations over more than a decade.\n\nKathleen Klein, 53, known within the church as \"Prophetess,\" was named in a superseding indictment returned Feb. 11 in the Eastern District of Michigan, the U.S. Department of Justice announced (1). She joins co-defendants David Taylor and Michelle Brannon, who were first indicted in July 2025 and arrested the following month in a coordinated nationwide takedown by the FBI.\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers.

Taylor, the church's founder, and Brannon, its executive director, each face up to 20 years per count on charges of forced labor, conspiracy to commit forced labor and money laundering conspiracy. All three defendants have denied the allegations.\n\n\"This case reflects the gravity of forced labor schemes that strip victims of their basic human rights and subject them to physical and brutal psychological abuse,\" Assistant Attorney General A. Tysen Duva said in a statement. \"Combating human trafficking is a top priority for the Department of Justice. We will relentlessly pursue those who facilitate and profit from forced labor and fight to obtain justice for survivors.\"\n\nThe superseding indictment also added new allegations that Taylor frequently requested and received sexually explicit photographs and videos from female church workers — some of whom prosecutors say were afraid to refuse.\n\nThe church, formerly known as Joshua Media Ministries International, was headquartered in Taylor, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit. According to court filings, Taylor referred to himself as an \"Apostle\" and claimed to be Jesus Christ's \"best friend\" and \"second in command\" (2). The Justice Department says the church operated at least nine call centers across Michigan, Missouri, Florida and Texas (3).",

    "fullText": "Catarina Macario was immaculate last year. The leading goalscorer for the USWNT showcased her ability to hold up play, connected across generations with international teammates and found the back of the net eight times in 10 appearances with two assists. Three of those goals came in the last two months of 2025 as the U.S. finished the year with two friendlies against Italy.\n\n“It has been a good year. It has been a year that I’ve tried to find some consistency,” Macario told TNT Sports at the time. “I’m still trying to find my rhythm and whatnot, but it’s been good.”\n\nTwo months into the year, however, and the picture looks different.\n\nMacario picked up another injury in late December that has kept her out of Chelsea’s Champions League squad, as well as the latest U.S. roster for next month’s SheBelieves Cup. That Macario is currently unavailable for selection has only exacerbated the question of her professional future; the 26-year-old’s contract with Chelsea expires in four months.\n\nMacario’s decision about her future carries high stakes. Here is what we know so far.\n\nChelsea face Arsenal in the quarterfinals of the Women’s Champions League next month. The reigning WSL champions look to right the ship against the reigning continental champions after a period of poor form and internal tension among Chelsea’s top brass.\n\nMacario, though, won’t be playing. She was left off Chelsea’s roster for the tournament, which was published on Feb. 7, due to a heel injury.\n\nThe Brazilian-American striker’s future has been a prolonged topic of discussion over the past two months. Her contract with Chelsea is set to expire this summer and with the World Cup in Brazil 16 months away, Macario’s next move will be critical.\n\nThe forward, who has been dealing with injuries for much of the season, last featured for Chelsea on Dec. 10 in a Champions League match against Roma. The week prior, she was with the U.S. for a pair of friendlies against Italy in Florida, scoring three goals across the two fixtures.\n\nShe has not been on the pitch since.\n\n“Cat had some heel pain before Christmas and she’s managing that,” Chelsea manager Sonia Bompastor said on Jan. 16 ahead of the FA Cup game against Crystal Palace. “She’s progressing in her rehab and heading in the right direction, but won’t be available for the weekend.”\n\nQuestions continued as Macario was left off of the USWNT roster for the SheBelieves Cup, which runs from March 1-7 and features matches against Argentina, Canada, and Colombia.\n\n“My understanding is that there has been a heel injury that I think she’s getting closer and closer with every day, but she’s not available for selection yet at Chelsea,” U.S. head coach Emma Hayes said after announcing her roster. “I don’t know when that is going to come. I don’t know if it’s one week, two, three weeks away, but I know she’s not available for selection.”\n\nHayes has experimented heavily with the U.S. roster; she capped 44 players in 2025 alone and awarded 16 debuts. While that phase of her development is over for this cycle, Hayes said she still sees Macario fitting into her depth chart, even while injured.\n\n“Honestly, if Cat Macario and Sophia Wilson were fit for selection, they would have been selected as the nines,” she said, adding an update for fellow forward Wilson, who missed 2025 on the field while pregnant with her first child.\n\nChelsea have had a turbulent season domestically. They sit third in the WSL, trailing front-runners Manchester City by nine points. Their 5-1 loss to the Manchester side on Feb. 1, which followed a 2-0 loss to Arsenal on Jan. 24, raised serious concern over Bompastor’s future with the club; the French manager had never lost two consecutive matches in her coaching career.\n\nBefore joining Chelsea, Bompastor coached OL Lyonnes, where Macario began her professional career. In 2021, the two won a Champions League title together. Macario signed with Chelsea in 2023 when Hayes was still managing the team. When Hayes departed for the USWNT in 2024, Chelsea hired Bompastor to replace her.\n\nBompastor guided the team to a domestic treble last season, but this season has been significantly more challenging on and off the pitch, with some sources describing to The Athletic a power struggle behind the scenes. On Feb. 6, Chelsea and Bompastor agreed to a contract extension that will run until 2030, a vote of confidence by the front office. Three days later, the team parted ways with former head of women’s football Paul Green, who had been with the club since 2013 and worked closely with Hayes.\n\nStill, it is unclear whether or to what extent these realities factored into Macario’s decision to reject Chelsea’s contract extension offer. As she enters what could be the peak of her career with the 2027 World Cup on the horizon — Macario’s first opportunity to win a major trophy with the U.S. — her next club will play a key role in her trajectory.\n\nMacario moving back to the U.S. for the first time since she played at Stanford University is a possibility, as The Athletic previously reported. The San Diego Wave are located in the area where she grew up after moving to the U.S. from Brazil when she was 12 years old.\n\nOne source told The Athletic that Macario had turned down Chelsea’s contract extension offer and said she also received offers from other European clubs. In order to protect relationships, the source spoke with The Athletic on the condition of anonymity. Another source said the San Diego Wave were front-runners to sign her.\n\nOn Feb. 13, ESPN reported that the Wave were in advanced negotiations to sign Macario. They reiterated that a deal had not yet been signed, but that Macario had expressed enthusiasm at the prospect of returning home and playing in the NWSL for the first time. The NWSL team declined to comment when approached by The Athletic. Macario is yet to publicly voice an opinion on her preferred next step, but the attraction of returning home and playing in the NWSL for the first time is clearly tempting from the outside.\n\nOn the sporting side, it makes sense for Macario to land somewhere she’s all but guaranteed substantial and consistent minutes on the pitch — something she was not able to do at Chelsea due in large part to injuries, including an ACL tear in 2022 and the nagging knocks that have occurred since.\n\nUnlike European leagues that lack evenly distributed competition, in the NWSL, Macario could find consistent game time and consistent competition. It could also be advantageous to experience the pace and physicality for which the NWSL is known.\n\nThe league allows incoming transfers up until March 16, three days after the first match of the season. The introduction of the High Impact Player rule, which allows NWSL clubs to spend up to $1 million above the salary cap on a player or players who meet predetermined qualifications, could also help an NWSL team sign Macario. The rule was established in December but is currently being disputed by the NWSL Players Association, which claims the rule misinterprets the “roster classification” as described in the league’s Collective Bargaining Agreement.\n\nMacario may decide to stay put at Chelsea until her contract is up this summer, but if she does have her sights set on the NWSL, it would behoove her to begin the season with them and give herself the extra time to adjust and gel, especially with Champions League play no longer a consideration for her and Chelsea’s hopes of a domestic title growing thin.\n\nMeanwhile, an early exit for Macario could benefit Chelsea, who could receive something in a transfer before the summer. After June, she becomes a free agent and could walk away on her own accord, and she’s not the only Chelsea player with contract talks on the horizon.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Athletic.\n\nUS Women's national team, Chelsea, NWSL, Women's Soccer\n\n2026 The Athletic Media Company",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. Department of Homeland Security is suspending the TSA PreCheck and Global Entry airport security programs as a partial government shutdown continues.\n\nThe programs are designed to help speed registered travelers through security lines. Suspending them could cause headaches for fliers.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a statement that “shutdowns have serious real world consequences.” She also said that “TSA and CBP are prioritizing the general traveling population at our airports and ports of entry and suspending courtesy and special privilege escorts.”\n\nThe partial government shutdown began Feb. 14 after Democrats and the White House were unable to reach a deal on legislation to fund the Department of Homeland Security. Democrats have been demanding changes to immigration operations that are core to President Donald Trump’s deportation campaign.\n\nDemocrats on the House Committee on Homeland Security criticized the decision about airport security.\n\nThey said on social media that the administration was “kneecapping the programs that make travel smoother and secure” and accused them of “ruining your travel on purpose.”",

    "fullText": "Jacob Bridgeman closed in on a first US PGA Tour title on Saturday, firing an impressive seven-under par 64 to take a six-stroke lead over world number two Rory McIlroy heading into the final round of the Genesis Invitational.\n\nBridgeman, who played the iconic Riviera Country Club course for the first time on Wednesday, made his way around like an old hand, matching the tournament's 54-hole record with a 19-under par total of 194.\n\nMcIlroy started the day one stroke behind co-leaders Bridgeman and Marco Penge but endured a tough day on Riviera's greens and finished with just three birdies and a bogey in his two-under 69 for 200.\n\nBridgeman, a 26-year-old American chasing his first PGA Tour title, was up by three after three birdies in his first four holes.\n\nHe picked up four strokes in the space of three holes to pull away for good. After rolling in a 12-foot birdie at the 10th he eagled the par-five 11th -- where he landed his 259-yard approach a foot from the pin. He drilled an 11-foot birdie putt at the 12th.\n\nMcIlroy, who completed his career Grand Slam at the Masters last year, admitted to some frustration as he found himself unable to put pressure on Bridgeman.\n\n\"The greens got really fast there at the end of the day,\" McIlroy said. \"You're grinding over three-footers and all of a sudden you get one that you think you can have a bit of a run at and if you hit it a little bit too hard ...\"\n\n\"I found the greens really, really difficult today,\" added McIlroy, whose difficulties were epitomized at the par-five 17th, where he was on the green in two but ultimately missed a four and a half-foot birdie putt.\n\nMcIlroy said he'd aim for a fast start on Sunday.\n\n\"I'm hitting the ball well. If I can keep driving it like that, putting the ball in the fairway, just giving myself chances and go from there -- that's all I can really do,\" said McIlroy, who was one stroke in front of South African Aldrich Potgieter.\n\nThe 21-year-old Potgieter, who claimed his lone PGA Tour title to date at the Rocket Classic in Detroit last year, had an eagle and six birdies in his six-under 65 and at 12-under was one clear of England's Aaron Rai, who shot a 66.\n\nWorld number one Scottie Scheffler, who pushed his streak of PGA Tour cuts made to 68 without a stroke to spare after an erratic two days, climbed the leaderboard with a five-under 66 for five-under 208.\n\nScheffler, who said this week he has a \"weird\" relationship with Riviera, made four of his six birdies on the back nine, shaking off his lone bogey with the help of solid putting.\n\n\"At times it still felt weird,\" he said. \"The golf course is gettable in the morning, the greens are fresher. So I was able to hole a few putts, which is key.\"",

    "fullText": "Briton Sandy Ryan became a two-weight world champion with a hard-fought points win over Karla Ramos Zamora in Nottingham, claiming the vacant WBC light-welterweight title.\n\nThe 32-year-old was below her best in a high-tempo contest against the awkward Mexican at the Motorpoint Arena.\n\nZamora's relentless output made several rounds difficult to score, but Ryan's cleaner counters proved decisive with the judges.\n\nScores of 95-95, 97-93 and 97-93 gave the Derby fighter a majority decision.\n\n\"I knew Zamora was going to be tough, but my lord she is tough,\" Ryan said. \"I think I broke my right hand in round three and from there it became a bit more messy.\n\n\"I made it hard work for myself. But it's because she's tough as well.\"\n\nA former welterweight world champion, Ryan improves her record to nine wins, three defeats and one draw.\n\nShe was fighting on the undercard of Leigh Wood v Josh Warrington, who meet in their rematch later on Saturday.\n\nWood v Warrington 2: Ryan becomes two-weight world champion - listen\n\nThe Uber-driving English champion & his 30-year fight for a passport\n\nBenn joining Zuffa 'dagger in the heart' for Hearn\n\nRyan returned to the world stage after considering retirement following back-to-back defeats by Mikaela Mayer.\n\nShe lost her WBO welterweight title in a close decision in September 2024 and was beaten again in their March 2025 rematch.\n\nRyan sprinted to the ring at 19:20 GMT to a quarter-full 8,000-seat arena, though a vocal pocket of Derby fans cut through the quiet.\n\nThe fight started at a quick pace. Zamora - fighting at world level for the first time - pressed forward and targeted the body.\n\nRyan responded with a sharp left hook in the second but was forced onto the back foot as Zamora kept the pressure on.\n\nAlthough Ryan was landing with the cleaner counters, Zamora was more effective with her inside work. By halfway, it was tighter than expected.\n\nBruised around the eyes, Ryan traded in the seventh as blood streamed from Zamora's nose, the visitor edging the exchanges.\n\nRyan boxed behind the jab in the ninth before they ended toe-to-toe, swinging at close range.\n\nAt the final bell, a case could be made for either fighter, or a draw.\n\nThe win, gritty rather than pretty, puts Ryan back in contention.\n\nUndisputed champion Katie Taylor holds the division's other belts but has yet to confirm her next move. At welterweight, unified champion Lauren Price may loom as a future target.\n\nA crossover bout with former MMA champion Cris Cyborg - now 5-0 in professional boxing - has also been previously mooted.\n\nEarlier in the night, Bilal Fawaz became British and Commonwealth light-middleweight champion by dethroning Ishmael Davis in a close contest.\n\nDavis, 30, started well and landed the more crisp and cleaner punches with Fawaz guilty of too much showboating and theatrics.\n\nBut Fawaz, 37, upped his punch output and took advantage in the second half as Davis tired.\n\nThe judges scored it 114-114, 115-113 and 115-114.\n\nNigerian-born Fawaz adds the British and Commonwealth titles to his collection, though he continues the fight for a British passport and is currently not able to fight or travel abroad.\n\nFawaz, who was trafficked to the UK as a teenager and after escaping a traumatic beginning to life, is now married and a father of two children, as well as working as an Uber driver.\n\n\"I know I'm 37 years old and I don't have much time. If I don't capitalise on what I have now, my dream will slip away. This is just the beginning, I am ready. I want it all,\" he said.\n\n\"It's sensational. It's overwhelming.\"\n\n\"I'm not a domestic fighter,\" he said. \"It's just that nobody gave me a chance. Eddie [Hearn] gave me a chance and I've proved him right ever since.\n\n\"Now I need to make some money and feed my family.\"\n\nWithout a passport, Fawaz cannot travel abroad to accept any world title opportunities outside of the UK.\n\n\"Get this man a passport,\" promoter Eddie Hearn added.\n\nAlso on the undercard in Nottingham, Molly McCann claimed her third professional win by outpointing Beata Dudek, while teenagers Leo Atang and Tiah Mai Ayton continued their unbeaten runs.\n\nHeavyweight Atang, 19, stopped Dan Garber inside a minute to make it five from five, and Ayton, also 19, went the distance for the first time in her fifth bout, defeating Catherine Tacone Ramos on points.\n\nPopular heavyweight Dave Allen returned to winning ways with a first-round stoppage of Karim Berredjem. The 33-year-old from Doncaster had lost to Russian Arslanbek Makhmudov - who is scheduled to face Tyson Fury in April - in his last outing.\n\nBoxing schedule and results 2026\n\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "fullText": "The \"Boca World\" has a new protagonist. Adam Bareiro was officially presented as the club's new signing after sealing a deal that will tie him to the institution for the next three seasons. The 29-year-old Paraguayan forward returns to Argentine football after his stint with Fortaleza in Brazil, thus fulfilling a long-held wish of Juan Román Riquelme, who always had him as a top priority on his radar.\n\nThe transfer was closed for a figure close to 3 million dollars. A significant detail of the operation is that half of that amount went to River Plate, a club that still owned 50% of his rights. In fact, his \"millonario\" past sparked the first tense moment of the day: while heading to his medical examination, a River fan confronted him, shouting \"traitor.\" Bareiro, far from getting into controversy, simply smiled and continued with the signing protocol.\n\nAfter passing his medical exams and signing a three-year contract (with an option for one more), the striker immediately moved to La Bombonera. There, he was seen in one of the boxes watching the match against Racing, already immersed in the atmosphere of his new home. With this move, Boca adds hierarchy and attacking power to face the challenges of 2026, backed by the absolute confidence of the management in his goal-scoring ability.\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence.

    "fullText": "The Orioles’ Grapefruit League opener yesterday was a resounding success, at least if you’re a pitcher or Pete Alonso. The Birds’ newest slugger mashed a two-run homer in his O’s spring debut to provide all the offense in a 2-0 win over the Yankees. Trevor Rogers, Keegan Akin, Rico Garcia, Grant Wolfram, Jose Espada, and Trey Gibson combined on a three-hit shutout, with Gibson pitching the final three innings for the save. All of those guys except Gibson are either locks or strong candidates for the Opening Day roster, so it’s nice to see them all start well.\n\nThe O’s have a return engagement at Ed Smith Stadium today against the Pirates. Dean Kremer, who will soon be leaving the Orioles to pitch for Team Israel in the World Baseball Classic, takes the mound today. It’s strange to think that Kremer might have to compete for a rotation spot, but that may be the case, as he, Chris Bassitt, and Zach Eflin (if healthy) are three candidates for two openings behind Rogers, Kyle Bradish, and Shane Baz.\n\nToday’s game marks the Orioles debuts for Taylor Ward and Blaze Alexander, while Dylan Beavers and Ryan Mountcastle will also be starting for the first time this spring. Adley Rutschman and Gunnar Henderson, the latter of whom will soon leave for the WBC as well, are the only Orioles from yesterday’s game who are starting again today. They’ll take on Pirates prospect Wilber Dotel. Former Orioles Ryan O’Hearn and Billy Cook are in the Pirates’ lineup this afternoon.\n\nThe game will be televised on MASN and on radio on 98 Rock.\n\nLF Taylor Ward\nC Adley Rutschman\n1B Ryan Mountcastle\n2B Blaze Alexander\nDH Gunnar Henderson\nRF Dylan Beavers\nCF Leody Taveras\n3B Weston Wilson\nSS Luis Vázquez",

    "fullText": "The Enola Gay, the Boeing B-29 Superfortress bomber that dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima in World War II, is so large that it couldn't fit into the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum's flagship location on the National Mall in Washington, DC.\n\nInstead, it's displayed at the museum's second location, the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, Virginia.\n\nThe Udvar-Hazy Center features over 200 aircraft on display, but the Enola Gay remains one of the most prominent objects in its collection.\n\nTake a closer look at the historic aircraft.\n\nA second \"Fat Man\" atomic bomb was dropped on Nagasaki on August 9, 1945, by another Boeing B-29 Superfortress named Bockscar, which is on display at the National Museum of the US Air Force in Dayton, Ohio.\n\nThe emperor of Japan announced the country's surrender on August 15.\n\nTibbets commanded the Air Force's 509th Composite Group in charge of deploying nuclear weapons. The hand-picked squadron trained at an abandoned airfield in Windover, Utah.\n\nTo make the B-29 aircraft capable of carrying the atomic bomb, all of its protective and defensive armament, except for the 50-caliber tailguns, were removed to get rid of excess weight. It was also left unpainted, which saved the 850 pounds that the paint would have added.\n\nAt least 70,000 people died in the initial blast from the bombing of Hiroshima, and the death toll over five years may have exceeded 200,000 people due to the aftereffects, according to the US Department of Energy's Office of History and Heritage Resources.\n\nJapan and anti-nuclear weapons scientists released an updated higher estimate in the 1970s that counted 140,000 deaths at Hiroshima.\n\nThe Enola Gay was rattled by shockwaves from the explosion, even as it had already flown 11.5 miles away.\n\nIt took museum staff 300,000 hours to reassemble and restore the Enola Gay, with 12 truckloads transporting all of its parts.\n\nIn 1995, the fuselage and other parts of the Enola Gay were displayed at the National Air and Space Museum's flagship location in Washington, DC, in an exhibit tied to the 50th anniversary of the bombing of Hiroshima.\n\nThe script of the exhibit was rewritten several times as various interest groups debated how it was presented and how the decision to drop the bomb was framed, according to the Smithsonian Institution Archives.\n\nVeterans' groups pushed for the exhibit to emphasize Japanese aggression and present the narrative that dropping the atomic bomb saved lives by ending the war. Anti-war activists opposed having the exhibit justify the use of the bomb and sought to highlight its victims by protesting with alternative exhibits on the sidewalk outside the museum.\n\nWeighing 137,500 pounds with a wingspan of 141 feet, the fully assembled plane is too large for the National Air and Space Museum's flagship location on the National Mall in Washington, DC. The Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, Virginia, offers more room with 340,000 square feet of exhibit space.\n\nThe Enola Gay is displayed among other aircraft from World War II, including the Northrop P-61C Black Widow, the first US aircraft designed for combat at night.\n\nOver 80 years after the bombing of Hiroshima, the Enola Gay remains not just a World War II artifact, but a symbol of a turning point that ushered the world into the nuclear age.\n\nAfter years of debate over how to present the aircraft, the permanent exhibition takes a minimalist approach, leaving visitors to decide how to understand its legacy.",

    "fullText": "The noise is one of the first things that hits you on arrival in India.\n\nThe chatter. The beeping of horns. A thrilling assault on the senses.\n\nEngland have also battled to dampen the noise around their group throughout this T20 World Cup campaign.\n\nShould Brendon McCullum stay on as coach? Is Harry Brook the right man to be captain?\n\nEven after reaching the relative tranquillity of central Sri Lanka, Brook fielded questions about the ongoing situation regarding Pakistan players' involvement in The Hundred.\n\nBrook's pre-prepared answers – he gave it in two separate interviews to different questions – did not say much, but he did at least show support for those involved.\n\nOn another day, Brook's admission that England had \"probably underestimated a couple of the sides\" when scraping through the group stage would have taken the headlines.\n\nIt was honest, but not a great look for a team battling a perception of being loose with their preparation.\n\n\"We obviously didn't know all the players and we had minimal stats on some of them,\" Brook said.\n\n\"That's something that we can definitely improve on in the future, especially in tournaments further down the line - getting your homework done a little bit earlier.\"\n\nEngland's performance in the group stage was undoubtedly unconvincing.\n\nThey were taken to the final ball by Nepal and lost to West Indies in Mumbai, before edging to wins over Italy and Scotland in Kolkata.\n\nBatters got in and got out - Tom Banton's 63 not out the only real match-defining score. Even the ever-reliable Adil Rashid has gone for nine runs per over or \n\nIt means England have shown little to suggest they can threaten late into the tournament to this point.\n\nWithout improvement this will likely be a fourth underwhelming major tournament in a row since they won the T20 World Cup in 2022.\n\nBut Brook's comments also reflect some of the difficulties faced by the major nations at this World Cup – a tournament in which no team has built an entirely compelling case to suggest they will be champions.\n\nPlayers from the lower-ranked teams expressed their keenness to perform, not just to cause an upset but also to prove they are deserving of the greater opportunities they so desperately seek.\n\nThe Test-playing sides, in contrast, had everything to lose. Just ask Mitchell Marsh when he gets off his flight to back to Australia on Saturday.\n\nAnd for all their struggles to finish matches with ease, England were also ahead in all three games against their lower-ranked opponents.\n\nNepal's chase looked to have stalled, Scotland were 127-8 and Italy 1-2 in the first over of their chase.\n\nMost former England captains would not admit it, and maybe Brook has shown he would, but it would only be human to relax in those situations.\n\nMost of all, however, England are hoping familiarity brings an upturn in fortunes.\n\nThey returned to Sri Lanka on Tuesday, first spending two nights in Colombo before taking the winding drive to Pallekele.\n\nColombo was where Brook stood in front of his team-mates in late January and apologised for his late-night antics in Wellington and the subsequent fallout – an attempt to draw a line under the Ashes defeat.\n\nPallekele was where England won all three T20s against the very same team they now face.\n\nEngland said they were badly prepared for the Ashes and now admit to being underprepared for this group stage. For the next task they could hardly have had better preparation.\n\n\"It's just about reading the pitch and the conditions as quickly as possible and communication's key,\" said Brook, when asked what he learned from beating Sri Lanka.\n\n\"We obviously had that last game where we only got 130, but that ended up being a winning score.\n\n\"You never quite know what's going to happen with the pitch and until you end up playing on it.\"\n\nThe 3-0 win, which concluded less than three weeks ago, took England's winning run in T20s against Sri Lanka to 11.\n\nThere have been six UK prime ministers since England last lost to Sunday's opponents in the shortest format.\n\nSri Lanka's key bowlers Wanindu Hasaranga and Matheesha Pathirana have also been ruled out with injury.\n\nAnd after Sri Lanka, England will face Pakistan before a meeting with New Zealand.\n\nThey have won their past three T20 series against Pakistan and beat the Black Caps last year. That was a rain-hit contest but in the one match completed, England racked up 236-4.\n\nThe favourable draw, set by the pre-seedings that have sent the four group winners into the other side of the Super 8 draw, means there will be no excuses should England fail to progress to the semi-finals.\n\nThat was the minimum requirement before this tournament began and relief at avoiding a group-stage exit should not hide that fact.\n\nEngland and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) chief executive Richard Gould arrived in Sri Lanka on Saturday, with managing director Rob Key to follow on Sunday.\n\nIt is described as a pre-planned trip rather than anything that should ramp up the pressure on coach Brendon McCullum, whose future remains in question after the Ashes debacle.\n\nThese may be three matches for McCullum to save his job – should he want to continue into the summer. Two wins would likely be enough to take England into the semi-finals.\n\nAnything less and that noise would only ramp up again.\n\nLive ball-by-ball commentary of every match on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra, BBC Sounds and the BBC Sport website and app, plus live texts with in-play clips and highlights.\n\nIs Buttler's form a worry? England's T20 World Cup so far analysed\n\nI won't bat for myself to correct form - Buttler\n\nEngland still confident despite unconvincing run - Jacks",

    "fullText": "Liverpool's injury list has been the bane of their existence this season.\n\nAlthough three or four injuries across the entire team wouldn't be the end of the world, the fact that Arne Slot's defence has often had three players absent has probably been a hard pill to swallow.\n\nDue to this, and the Reds' lack of depth, their defensive line has been brought into question on more than one occasion with several players being linked with a summer move.\n\nHowever, now that one of Slot's injury-prone men seem to be back to full fitness, it could be his time to shine and his chance to prove why the Anfield outfit have chosen to keep him around for so long.\n\nShop the goalkeeper range today\n\nShop the third kit range today!\n\nThere's no hiding from the fact that Joe Gomez is a 'special' player.\n\nIn fact, up until he injured his knee in the 2020-21 season, the Englishman was Virgil van Dijk's main defensive partner.\n\nSince that injury, the former Charlton man has been side-lined on several occasions with his body seemingly being made of glass.\n\nHowever, now that he's returned from his latest ailment, it feels like now could be his time to shine, especially since Jeremie Frimpong and Conor Bradley are injured.\n\nGomez is 28 years old now and with the 2026 World Cup just around the corner, a solid end to the 2025-26 season could be exactly what he needs to get into Thomas Tuchel's plans, especially because of how versatile he is.\n\nThe Englishman's most recent cameo against Brighton further proved why Slot should start against Nottingham Forest on Sunday.\n\nDue to Gomez's injury history, it's not hard to see why Slot has often chosen against starting the Englishman on a regular basis.\n\nAnd, when he has gone against his better judgement, the 28-year-old has often left the pitch early due to injury.\n\nHowever, during his 20-minute cameo against Brighton, the centre-back rolled back the years and proved why Jurgen Klopp chose to bring him to Anfield in the first place.\n\nAccording to Sofascore, the defender maintained a 100 per cent pass accuracy during his cameo and even won 100 per cent of the tackles he attempted.\n\nHe may have committed a couple of fouls during that time but his confidence on the ball was second to none.\n\nThe added stability that the centre-back brought to Liverpool's starting XI was rather helpful and, since Forest beat Fenerbahce 3-0 last time out, they'll have a point to prove.\n\nIt will also be Vitor Pereira's second game in charge and, if we look back to when the Portuguese manager first took over at Wolves, he won them a fair few games at the start.\n\nLiverpool have a lot riding on Sunday's game and, if they lose, they could end up missing out on a top four spot, which, for a team of their quality, would be horrendous.",

    "description": "The watch world is rejoicing over the Supreme Court's ruling on Trump's tariffs as dealers say the prices of pre-owned Swiss watches could dip.",
    "fullText": "The watch world breathed a collective sigh of relief over the Supreme Court's decision on President Donald Trump's trade policy.\n\nIn a 6-3 decision on Friday, the court ruled that imposing most of Trump's tariffs exceeded his authority under a 1970s law. The ruling is a hefty blow to the policies he put in place against foreign countries, which companies have had to reckon with for nearly a year.\n\nWatch dealers have told Business Insider that they and their shoppers stand to benefit from the ruling. Pre-owned watch retailer SwissWatchExpo CEO Eugene Tutunikov said it would likely lead to lower pre-owned watch prices in the next six months — he expects declines of 2% to 3%. Without tariffs looming overhead, the market is poised to snap back faster than retail prices as sellers set their prices and buyers take the deals.\n\n\"Supply will loosen up, and purchasing power goes right back to the collector where it belongs,\" Tutunikov said.\n\nA break from tariffs would make the entry point for luxury watch collecting more accessible.\n\nCue the celebrations among Swiss watch lovers who've been caught in a storm of retail price increases from leading brands like Rolex over the past year. Supply chain constraints also made it harder to do business in the secondhand market.\n\nTariff tensions between Switzerland and the US have been up and down since Trump's Liberation Day. US imports of Swiss goods faced a baseline tariff of 10% from April 2025 until Trump eventually raised it to 39%, sending shockwaves through the watch industry. The two countries continued negotiations until Trump agreed to lower the rate to 15% after speaking with Rolex and other Swiss companies.\n\nTrump clapped back at the nation's highest court over its Friday ruling, saying he'd find alternative ways to keep his trade agenda intact.\n\n\"The Supreme Court did not overrule tariffs. They merely overruled a particular use of IEPPA tariffs,\" Trump said, citing the law referenced in the court's ruling.\n\nHowever, the Supreme Court's move is still a win in the books of watch dealers who've said the decision would allow pricing in the pre-owned market to return to being based on value and demand rather than tariffs.\n\n\"If they are indeed lifted, we expect it would meaningfully improve sentiment across the industry, increase access to important pieces, and ultimately benefit collectors, retailers, and brands alike,\" said Joshua Ganjei, CEO of European Watch Company, which sells pre-owned and vintage watches.",

    "fullText": "Savinho has missed the last 13 games for Manchester City. The Brazilian international was injured during Manchester City’s nil-all draw with Sunderland at the Stadium of Light at the beginning of January. Pep Guardiola has now revealed that Savinho is nearing a return to the pitch, which is good news for his team. Also, the Manchester City manager revealed that he has high hopes for Savinho as a player. Savinho is a player who can dazzle and frustrate in the same passage of play. But as Pep Guardiola said after his team’s win over Salford City, if the Brazilian international can put it all together, he could become a devastating weapon for his team.\n\nSpeaking after Manchester City’s 2-nil win over Salford City in their FA Cup fourth-round tie at the Etihad Stadium, Pep Guardiola revealed that Savinho could have played a few minutes against the League Two side. The Manchester City manager also revealed that if Savinho can put it all together with his end product, he will become a valuable weapon for his team. Speaking on Savinho’s injury situation, and the Brazilian international’s obvious potential, Pep Guardiola said: “He’s been out for six weeks. He could [have played] a few minutes, but we didn’t want to take risks. Training two days ago was wow, so good. He’s close. Now we have a long week and players coming back.”\n\n“Already Savinho, when he will learn to make the finished product he will be an unbelievable winger on both sides.”\n\nPep Guardiola’s assessment of Savinho is on the money. The Brazilian winger has the potential to become a key player for Manchester City. What has plagued Savinho since he arrived at City from Troyes is his end product. Savinho’s finishing is unreliable, and he squanders too many chances. His delivery and decision-making in the final third also remain inconsistent. None of these revelations are groundbreaking; they have been known for some time now. It is up to Savinho to rectify these areas of his game to take the next step as a player. He simply has to get an opportunity to become a consistent player for Manchester City.\n\nThere is strong competition now amongst the City sqaud for roles on either wing. Antoine Semenyo, Jeremy Doku, Rayan Cherki and Phil Foden all stand in Savinho’s way. You could throw Omar Marmoush into that mix as well. To make good on Pep Guardiola’s assessment, Savinho has to improve his end product. He has no other choice. Modern squads are built on options, and Guardiola has plenty available in wide areas. Supporters see a similar idea in games too, where players can buy V Bucks to open up more choices and customise their experience before jumping back into action. For Savinho, the challenge is simple — take the next step and make himself the first option when it matters most.\n\nIt is good news for Manchester City to have Savinho back from injury. His return gives Pep Guardiola another attacking option to utilize. Pep Guardiola has also explained what Savinho needs to do to grow as a player. It is now up to him to take the next step and not be squeezed out of Pep Guardiola’s squad.",
