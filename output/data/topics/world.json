    "description": "YouTuber-turned-boxer Paul and former world heavyweight champion Joshua will clash on 19 December",
    "fullText": "Jake Paul and Anthony Joshua will square off in a strange fight tonight, pitting a YouTuber-turned-boxer against a former two-time world heavyweight champion.\n\nJoshua is the latter, to avoid any confusion, with the Briton entering Friday’s fight in Miami as a huge favourite. “AJ” holds standout victories over the likes of Wladimir Klitschko, Joseph Parker, Kubrat Pulev, Dillian Whyte and Alexander Povetkin. However, the 36-year-old is entering this bout, which streams live on Netflix, on the back of a brutal stoppage loss to Daniel Dubois in September 2024.\n\nMeanwhile, Paul comes into this contest – a professional bout, with knockouts allowed and standard 10oz gloves in use – with a 12-1 pro record. The American, 28, last fought in June and outpointed former world middleweight champion Julio Cesar Chavez Jr, following a decision win over heavyweight legend Mike Tyson last November.\n\nTyson was 58 at the time, with the fight proving controversial to fans and pundits but lucrative to the boxers; Paul reportedly took home $40m and Tyson $20m.\n\nNow, Paul and Joshua will seemingly clear even Paul’s payday from that bout – and by some distance.\n\nIn the days leading up to the confirmation of this bout in November, the Daily Mail reported, “Sources tell us that a gargantuan prize pot of around £140m [$184m] has been mooted,” seemingly to be split evenly between Joshua and Paul. However, Paul later took to X (formerly Twitter) with a different figure, seemingly referencing the fight purse.\n\nSeveral days after the Mail’s report was published, Paul tweeted: “Stop asking me. $267 Million.” That works out at approximately £200m.\n\nSports and entertainment accountant Oriana Morrison told The Independent on Tuesday: “Even if the lower figure – the rumoured $184m purse – is true, AJ could bring home $92m [£70m]. We haven’t seen a boxing match with a purse at this level since Mayweather vs Pacquiao in 2015 or even Mayweather vs McGregor in 2017. It’s higher than any Saudi purse to date.”\n\nMorrison, who was referencing Floyd Mayweather’s bouts with Manny Pacquiao and Conor McGregor, continued: “The US never really got the chance to savour Anthony Joshua’s talent and charisma. This is the perfect setting for this fight and definitely a turning point for boxing in the US.\n\n“MVP [Most Valuable Promotions, Paul’s company] and Jake Paul are dragging new audiences into boxing. They’re forcing boxing to modernise its promotion and pay fighters better than established promoters.”",

    "fullText": "Rising darts star Beau Greaves has been described as 'world class' by the game's top player, so how far can she go on the biggest stage?\n\nThe 21-year-old begins her PDC World Championship campaign against 22nd seed Daryl Gurney at Alexandra Palace in London on Friday evening.\n\nAnd despite losing on her only previous appearance at the tournament, she is rated odds-on favourite by bookmakers to beat Gurney, a World Cup winner with Northern Ireland, and reach the second round.\n\nGreaves hit the headlines when defeating world champion Luke Littler in October to reach the World Youth Championship final. Interest in the contest was such that visitors almost crashed the online system offering score updates.\n\nThat came amid an unbeaten run of 86 matches in the Women's Series, which has provided five competitors in an expanded 128-player world championship.\n\nLittler admitted he hoped to avoid the woman nicknamed 'Beau and Arrow' when the draw was made.\n\n\"Beau Greaves is definitely one that I wouldn't want to play,\" said Littler, who in January became the youngest world darts champion aged 17, told BBC Sport.\n\n\"She's world class, that's why she's won the Women's World Championship three times.\n\n\"She's been dominating the Women's Series for two or three years now and she's only going to get better and better.\"\n\nFive-time world champion Raymond van Barneveld has predicted a good run in the Worlds could see Greaves invited to the eight-player Premier League - although 2021 world champion Gerwyn Price described that suggestion as \"a joke\".\n\nOnly one woman has won matches on the world stage at the Ally Pally - Fallon Sherrock twice in December 2019 - while Greaves' debut three years ago ended in a first-round defeat by William O'Connor.",

    "fullText": "OpenAI is the latest to make a political hire as big tech spreads its tentacles around the world. So what’s the attraction?\n\nGeorge Osborne getting a new job isn’t exactly news. Since leaving frontline politics, the former chancellor has served as the chair of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, edited (not entirely successfully) the Evening Standard, advised asset manager BlackRock, joined boutique advisory firm Robey Warshaw, been appointed as the chair of the British Museum and taken on roles including advising crypto firm Coinbase. Oh, and like any white man of a particular age, he co-hosts a political podcast.\n\nBut Osborne’s latest job is the most eye-opening – and is an alarming augur of what is to come. OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, has become the latest organisation to employ Osborne. He will run OpenAI for Countries, a unit tasked with working directly with governments while expanding the company’s Stargate datacentre programme beyond the US. At least it was announced with a tweet, rather than a LinkedIn post.\n\nThe tweet prompted jokes, as did Osborne’s single-handed attempt to boost laggard employment figures brought about by his policies as the chancellor of austerity. But it’s a serious moment, because it’s another sign that the biggest AI firms are starting to behave less like normal companies and more like quasi-governments. They’re negotiating “national” partnerships, pitching a values-led vision of “democratic AI” and hiring former senior politicians as their diplomatic corps. It’s a similar path we have seen from other industries, including oil, pharma and defence, in previous decades – which is why it’s important to try to recognise the risks and head them off before AI companies can repeat the same trick.\n\nThe initiative Osborne is heading up, OpenAI for Countries, does what it says on the tin. It’s designed to embed OpenAI’s models and infrastructure inside the machinery of states, becoming an invaluable, indefatigable part of the running of our lives. OpenAI is in talks with about 50 countries to provide them with critical national infrastructure. Whether you welcome Osborne being put in that role rather than a tech executive is a little like Hobson’s choice: who do you distrust the least? But it’s an indication of how tech companies see their position in society that they are hiring such high-powered people for these roles.\n\nOsborne is not the first to don the branded hoodie and Silicon Valley lifestyle. His fellow coalition government bod Nick Clegg blazed the trail as head of global affairs for Meta. At the time of his initial hiring as a vice-president at Facebook in 2018, his appointment was treated as a PR move – a big name to help the company navigate scandal and scrutiny. But it hinted that platforms had become political actors, whether they liked it or not. The industry’s outsized spending on lobbyists (€151m in Europe alone at the last count) to support the political beasts is an indication of what is at stake. The numbers involved also hint at the scale of the prize that tech companies see: the 10 largest big tech firms now outspend the biggest 10 companies in the pharma, finance and automotive industries combined.\n\nThe former chancellor isn’t even the first former controller of the UK public purse to be handy to big tech. In October of this year, Rishi Sunak took advisory roles with Microsoft and the AI firm Anthropic, less than two years after he convened the AI safety summit at Bletchley Park. Sunak, at least, already had the regulation hoodie in his wardrobe.\n\nYou can read these moves in two ways. The generous interpretation is that these companies are hedging: trying to anticipate tech regulation and ensure they understand it. The more cynical interpretation is that they are attempting to shape the geopolitical story around AI from inside the machine, hiring former leaders less for their technical insight than their institutional muscle memory and networks.\n\nEither way, it leaves democracies with a problem. Governments are supposed to set the rules of the road. But the tech companies they are meant to regulate are on a different scale, planting their feet in different countries. When Sunak convened the Bletchley Park summit, it was notable that he turned interviewer to quiz Elon Musk, sitting starry-eyed on stage as Musk dominated the discourse.\n\nIt’s time to recognise these companies are acting like political actors. That means it’s time to treat them like political actors, too. We need more transparency: governments signing up to OpenAI for Countries agreements should publish the details of their partnerships by default. We should also ask more questions about infrastructure dependence. Governments love Stargate-style investments in their countries, and want to be able to don a hard hat, cut a ribbon and issue a press release. But if they are in effect a new layer of national backbone, they should be studied more closely – as if they are utilities, rather than receive the good grace of a startup-style mystique.\n\nThe more tech companies start to act like politicians and global leaders, the more we need to treat them like it. That doesn’t mean deference; it means more scepticism and journalistic interrogation.\n\nChris Stokel-Walker is the author of TikTok Boom: The Inside Story of the World’s Favourite App",

It has the feel of a really excellent graphic novel.\n\nSupergiant Games, PC, Switch\n\n A stylish return to Greek mythology for developer Supergiant Games, this time starring daughter of the underworld Melinoë, who is trying to prevent the titan Chronos from destroying everything. You are aided in your attempts to kill Time by a range of absurdly attractive fellow immortals and vicious familiars. Repeated runs bring gradual mastery of Melinoë’s spells and weapons, tipping the scales of fate ever so slightly in your favour.\n\nSokpop Collectiv, PC\n\n A gardening sim that’s also a horror adventure, Grunn is a weird, often unsettling experiment in game design, set in a Dutch village inhabited by ghostly figures and intriguing secrets. Trim the lawn, collect photos, but be extremely careful when visiting the church or exploring that weird bunker beyond the hedgerow.\n\nMegagon Industries, PC, Xbox\n\n All is well with the world as you carve beautiful lines down pristine mountain snowscapes – until you smack into a rock or fly off a cliff, that is. Minimalist in both its aesthetic and its simple, stripped-back play, this is one of the best games ever made about skiing. Playing with other people adds a little enjoyable chaos to the experience, but Snow Riders is best when it’s just you and the mountain, and you’re testing your perseverance against a particularly challenging trail.\n\nNintendo, Switch 2\n\n Nintendo’s favourite ape returns in a wild take on the classic platform adventure, accompanied by series regular Pauline, who is able to attain shapeshifting magical powers. Instead of pixel-perfect jumps, you punch, crunch and blast your way through exotic locations, collecting power-ups and pulverising bosses, tearing up the Super Mario level design book as you go. Smashing.\n\nCapcom, PC, PS5, Xbox\n\n Capcom’s spectacular monsters, from fluffy pink snarling apes to elder dragons that command lightning, have long been waiting for a world big enough to contain them. Wilds is that world: an expanse of desert, volcanic plains, jungle and icy peaks that provides the perfect habitats for an extraordinary, dangerous menagerie – and perfect arenas in which to fight them. The story is a thrill ride of escalatingly epic face-offs, but afterwards it opens up a vast menu of more challenging hunts.\n\nHazlelight Studios/Electronic Arts, PC, PS5, Switch, Xbox\n\n Two aspiring writers become trapped in each others’ stories in this eminently likable interactive take on buddy comedy. Except they’re not buddies: they’re polar opposites. Standoffish sci-fi writer Mio and happy-go-lucky fantasy writer Zoe come to understand each other better as they are forced to cooperate their way through the bizarre realms of their imagination Play transforms unpredictably every 20 minutes - one level could be all-action space-blasting, the next will have you puzzling through a fantasy jungle as transforming animals, and an unexpected diversion will have you working together to wriggle sentient hotdogs into buns. You’ll be brought closer to your player two as well, as navigating these collaborative scenarios requires communication, patience, and a sense of humour.\n\n11Bit Studios, PC, PS5, Xbox\n\n After crash-landing on a planet supposedly rich in a valuable mineral, Jan Dolski finds himself all alone. The rest of the crew died on impact. So to keep the mission going, and escape an imminent sunrise that will fry him out of existence, he must clone himself to create a crew. After twenty-ish hours split between exploring a hostile planet, managing the base’s resources and managing the squabbles between all the alternate Jans, you will be left with a lot to ponder about how our life choices shape who we are.\n\nPanic, PC, PS4/5, Switch, Xbox\n\n Set at the time of Ecuador’s journey to the 2002 World Cup finals, Despelote is a beautifully designed semi-autobiographical adventure about a young boy and his obsession with the beautiful game. Focusing on families, childhood and the uniting power of fandom, it’s a unique take on the idea of a sports sim.\n\nTwo Point Studios/Sega, PC, PS5, Switch 2, Xbox\n\n The Two Point series of management sims has consistently combined humour and deep strategy to compelling effect, and the latest is no exception. Your role as museum manager is to gather exhibits from around the world then display them in an attractive setting to pull in visitors. Meanwhile there are staffing issues to contend with, and is your cafe serving nice enough snacks? It’s an engrossing challenge and the cartoon-style visuals provide plenty of amusing asides.\n\nSucker Punch/Sony, PS5\n\n A deliciously easy to enjoy and arrestingly beautiful samurai action game about a female warrior, Atsu, on a revenge quest, which unselfconsciously reproduces every possible trope of the genre, with panache. We have tense sword stand-offs under falling leaves. We have enemies eyeing each other menacingly from either side of a burning bridge. We have hot springs, shrines and quiet moments playing the shamisen or wielding a sumi-e ink brush. We have wolves and foxes leading us to secret spots in nature. And we have a selection of delightfully fun weapons and a seemingly endless horde of bandits and villains to use them on. Uncomplicated, beautifully made entertainment.\n\nKojima Productions/Sony, PS5\n\n Troubled delivery man and resistance hero Sam Bridges returns in Hideo Kojima’s visually astonishing, eccentric and engrossing sci-fi sequel. Moving the action to an apocalyptic Australia provides landscapes of stark beauty – and the odd kangaroo. And while the story is often indecipherable, the realisation of Kojima’s ghostly universe is incredible. This is a wasteland you can wallow in for months.\n\nSandfall/Keplar, PC, PS5, Xbox\n\n An extravagantly French role-playing game in which a band of depressed people from a ravaged Paris set out to kill a supernatural painter, who wipes out a generation of people with a few strokes of her brush each year. It is surreal, exciting, melodramatic, sometimes self-indulgent, and strangely hopeful – a breath of fresh air even in a genre that’s hardly starved of stylish, thematically ambitious games.\n\nHexecutable, PC \n\n A satirical slice-of-life game about life as a dieting-obsessed teen in the 00s, Consume Me is extremely funny and has a point to make. Juggling studies with social time and walking the dog, Tetris-ing food on to your plate and and enduring excruciating conversations with your parents, all makes you properly relive the overwhelm and pressure of adolescent life. The presentation, meanwhile, is exuberantly, lovably absurd.\n\nNintendo, Switch 2\n\n The showcase title for the Switch 2 is another glorious addition to the Mario Kart universe, boasting a delightful cast of characters and 30 varied circuits joined by a network of highways that provide the chance to explore a wide open landscape for the first time in the series. Add in the wonderful soundtrack of electronic lounge jazz pop bangers and you have another family gaming staple that will remain on rotation for years.\n\nSpooky Doorway/Raw Fury, PC\n\n It’s the late 19th century and you’ve just arrived at a remote hotel in the west of Ireland to investigate the disappearance of a young woman. But as you dig for clues, the dead emerge from their graves – and they’re really not happy. Part Agatha Christie detective sim, part folk-horror opus, this is a fascinating and engrossing experience that has things to say about class, belief and colonialism.\n\nNeoBards/Konami, PC, PS5, Xbox\n\n In 1960s Japan, a young girl’s fury at her bullying father becomes a spectral nightmare that consumes a whole town. Written by acclaimed visual novel author Ryukishi07, the game puts you in familiar Silent Hill territory, which means foggy streets, fiendish puzzles and truly horrible monsters. But by infusing the uncanny, mythology and superstition with feminist themes, it is an intriguing slant on a much loved (and feared) series.\n\nTeam Cherry, PC, PS4/5, Switch, Switch 2, Xbox\n\n Even the most tenacious player will feel like giving up at some point while trapped in Pharloom, a decaying realm full of desperate little bugs that was once a gleaming religious capital. Here lie some truly wretched places: former farms now fetid swamps, dank underground caverns overgrown with moss and misery, grand halls now dust-covered and reverberating with foreboding. And of course there are the guardians of these places, from mind-rotted beast-tamers to corrupted pilgrims and bug-automatons, silk-poisoned creatures and the realm’s former rulers, who stand in the way of your progress. Silksong’s most forbidding foes take hours to overcome. Its worst places will entrap you in despair. But it is worth it, because of the awe-inspiring moments that you will experience along the way: the hard-won victories, those first steps into previously locked-off realms, the secret revelations that seem so personal it’s hard to believe that any of the game’s millions of other players could discover them the same way. An extraordinary game whose sometimes extreme difficulty is both a strength and a weakness.\n\nDogubomb/Raw Fury, PC, PS5, Xbox\n\n A young man inherits a mysterious mansion from his uncle: a sprawling pile whose layout changes every day. He needs only to find the secret 46th room, and the place is his for ever. The mansion turns out to be an education: on the personal history of the family that owned it, the mysterious forces that shaped it and the political climate of the wider world in which it is situated. But before you get anywhere near Blue Prince’s deeper mysteries, you must master its blueprints. Behind every door is a choice: do you draft a library? A hallway with several exits? A security room, a laboratory, a pool, a bedroom, a nursery, a drawing room? Each will have its own secrets to discover, a useful item or a key or a new piece of information that gets you ever closer to that elusive 46th room. And each might offer you a new path to the rest of the mansion, or locked doors that you haven’t the means to pass. Every day, with every new route that you carve through these rooms, every dead end you meet, your knowledge accumulates. By the time you do reach that final destination, you’ll have so many unanswered questions, you won’t be able to resist continuing. Blue Prince turns out to be an almost bottomless mystery, leaving you with pads full of notes, theories, numbers and names, lines from books that you want to remember and drawings of strange mechanisms. It is among the best puzzle games ever made: atmospheric and understated and unforgettably clever; still somehow able to show you something new even after tens of hours of patient exploration.",

    "fullText": "on December 18, 2025 at 1:48PM PST\n\nGameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n\nThe most wonderful time of the year, in both the real world and in Fortnite, has arrived. Winterfest is here, and that means lots of free stuff. As has become tradition in Fortnite, Epic Games has brought back the Winterfest Cabin, which is full of free cosmetics waiting to be opened.\n\nThere are 14 free gifts available in the cabin, and you can open one each day. In past years, these gifts would stack--if you missed a day, you'd be able to open two the following day. But it doesn't work that way this year. This time, you really can only open one present each day, no matter what. So be sure to keep up with them, or else you might miss out on some of the gifts.\n\nAs you can see from the graphic, this year's collection of gifts includes two free skins, two back blings, two pickaxes, two musical instruments, a glider, a weapon wrap, a Fortnite-original jam track based on Carol of the Bells, a contrail, and a few sprays and emoticons for good measure.\n\nThe skins are in the two large presents in the back on the left side of the room, but you won't be able to open them at the start. You can unlock the Glacial Dummy skin after opening seven other presents, which means he'll be available on Christmas day, And you can get Cheeks, the hamster man, only after you've picked every other present, which means he'll unlock on New Year's Eve.\n\nBeyond those two skins, you can unlock the presents in any order you want. And despite the fact there's a Hogwarts student chilling in the cabin while the Harry Potter movie theme plays, none of the free gifts have anything to do with the Harry Potter franchise.\n\nFor a better look at some of the free rewards, as pulled by fortnite.gg, you can pull from this year's Winterfest Cabin, scroll on.

    "description": "It's impossible to deny the success of Embark Studios' extraction shooter Arc Raiders. Now, as 2025 comes to a close, the studio is reflecting on the momentous launch, which was recently capped off by the title's win for Best Multiplayer Game at the 2025 Game Awards, and what's to come in 2026. If you're to believe Embark, which seems on top of the world right now, \"the work is just beginning.\"\nIn a post to Arc Raiders website, the shooter's executive producer Aleksander Grondal writes, \"We had a feeling that Arc Raiders was something special. Internally, we were having a blast playing it before release, and your reaction to the tech test in April gave us an inkling of what was to come.",

    "fullText": "Anthony Joshua will outweigh Jake Paul by at least 27 pounds Friday in their controversial Netflix boxing match. The two fighters tipped the scales Thursday at the event’s official weigh-ins in Miami.\n\nJoshua, an Olympic super heavyweight champion and two-time unified heavyweight world champion, weighed in at 243.4 pounds for Friday’s heavyweight collision.\n\nPaul, who was previously preparing for a fight against 135-pound boxing world champion Gervonta Davis before Joshua stepped in on short notice, weighed in at a much lighter 216.4 pounds.\n\nThe vast size difference between the two fighters has been one of many divisive points ahead of this weekend’s matchup. Joshua is one of the most accomplished heavyweights of this era. Standing 6-foot-6 with a gargantuan 82-inch reach, he remains one of the top-ranked boxers in the world. He challenged for the IBF world title in his last fight — a September 2024 loss to Daniel Dubois at London's Wembley Stadium.\n\nBecause of the immense size and skill gap between the two fighters, Joshua was contractually not permitted to weigh-in heavier than 245 pounds.\n\nPaul vs. Joshua will be contested with 10-ounce gloves across eight three-minute rounds at Miami's Kaseya Center. Prelims begin at 4:45 p.m. ET and stream on Netflix's Tudum platform, while the main card begins at 8 p.m. ET and airs live on Netflix, free for all subscribers. Main event rings walks are expected around 10:30 p.m. ET.\n\nUncrowned will have full live coverage and round-by-round results of the action.",

    "description": "How does a 30-tonne, 30-metre-long Boeing passenger jet go missing for well over a decade? Surely in today’s high-tech, hyper-surveilled and bureaucratic world, such a scenario is impossible. Apparently not.",
    "fullText": "How does a 30-tonne, 30-metre-long Boeing passenger jet go missing for well over a decade? Surely in today’s high-tech, hyper-surveilled and bureaucratic world, such a scenario is impossible. Apparently not.\n\nThe case of the misplaced plane is just the latest revelation to hit Air India, the beleaguered South Asian carrier that has already been in the headlines following a tragic crash earlier this year.\n\nNow comes the news that this longstanding airline somehow managed to leave one of its old Boeing passenger jets, a 737-200 registered as VT-EHH, gathering dust in Kolkata Airport for 13 years, having completely forgotten it owned it in the first place.\n\nIn fact, when Air India was first contacted about the parking fees for the plane, it denied ownership. But now the airline has finally admitted that it had indeed managed to lose track of the offending plane, and is thus responsible for paying the 10 million rupees (around £85,000) parking bill that it has accrued over the past decade.\n\nTo state the obvious, this isn’t the sort of thing that usually happens to airlines – for equally obvious reasons. The economics of a modern airline mean that planes generally spend as much time in the air as possible, and are only really grounded when they absolutely need to be. If you’re going to spend more than £100 million on a passenger jet, you don’t want to leave it stationary where it might develop problems (planes are, after all, designed to be in the air).\n\nPlanes don’t tend to get retired all that often. Most jetliners will usually spend at least ten years in service with their original airline, after which they may even be sold on to smaller airlines in developing countries (though that happens less regularly these days). Alternatively, older jets can be repurposed into cargo planes, where they can sometimes fly for another 20 years.\n\nAs a last resort, old planes can be sold on to companies who specialise in breaking them down and selling the individual parts. Hence those slightly haunting images of plane “graveyards” in places like Arizona, where they are eventually stripped down into their individual components.\n\nEven leaving aside the numerous business reasons for not letting a plane rust away in an airport parking lot, there are also practical reasons why such a situation is unlikely. As you might expect, airlines have plenty of paperwork when it comes to their hardware, much of which has to be refiled on an annual basis to ensure that planes remain fit to fly.\n\n“Given the regulatory oversight, it’s hard to comprehend that an airline could ever ‘lose’ an aircraft,” says aviation industry expert John Strickland, founder of JLS Consulting. “Things like maintenance and individual component serial numbers would need to be clearly documented.”\n\nThough of course that would require Air India to have had the particular plane on their inventory in the first place.\n\nSome analysts have pointed out that the plane’s orphan status could have resulted from its slightly confusing history. For a start, the plane had originally been registered as belonging to Indian Airlines, another state-owned airline that was eventually merged with Air India back in 2007. Following the merger, the plane was leased out to the Indian postal service to work as a cargo plane. Maybe the paperwork got lost somewhere during the changeover?\n\nNew Zealand-born Campbell Wilson, Air India’s chief executive, claimed the plane had been missed off the ledger when Air India was privatised back in 2022. If the plane wasn’t included on the records at the time, the new company wouldn’t have known it had even acquired it – and would thus have ignored any letters from the Kolkata Airport revenue department.\n\nCould the plane have been put to better use? Almost certainly.\n\nThe fact that the jet had already been fitted out for cargo flights would suggest it could have been used for that purpose. Failing that, it could have been sold for parts. That said, the sale would have been unlikely to make much difference to Air India’s bottom line.\n\n“The aircraft itself is an old one with negligible value,” says John Strickland. “It might have been useful for salvage of materials, but little or nothing more.” Though presumably that is still better than having to settle a 13-year storage bill.\n\nAre there any lessons for other airlines around the world? On the one hand, the “lost” passenger jet does appear to be a one-off – with no other recorded incidents of airlines losing planes in this way. On the other hand, Kolkata Airport has reportedly claimed to have found other “abandoned” planes over the past decade – so this may not be the last time we hear about the strange story of a forgotten plane.\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "title": "Millionaires are rethinking where they move — soaring private healthcare costs are redrawing the global map",
    "description": "Henley & Partners say data shows wealthy families shifting plans as private healthcare costs surge worldwide and cheaper European options gain appeal.",
    "fullText": "A surge in global wealth migration seems to be colliding with an overlooked but increasingly decisive factor: the soaring cost of private healthcare.\n\nHenley & Partners, an investment migration firm, said its client data and new cost comparisons from a global health index show wealthy families are no longer choosing where to live solely on tax or lifestyle, but are increasingly factoring in the long-term cost of private healthcare.\n\nThe firm said in a press release this month that it has received applications from 92 nationalities in 2025, supporting clients across more than 50 residence and citizenship programs.\n\nApplications jumped 43% year-over-year in the first three quarters of 2025 compared with the same period in 2024, it said.\n\n\"Global mobility is becoming a core risk-management strategy for wealthy families,\" said Christian H. Kaelin, the firm's chairman. Clients \"are scrutinizing not only access to residence and citizenship, but also the real cost of sustaining that lifestyle — especially the price of reliable private healthcare.\"\n\n\"Destinations that look attractive on paper can become far less so once true healthcare exposure is understood,\" he added.\n\nHenley & Partners cited the SIP Health Cost Index 2025, from the SIP Medical Family Office in Switzerland, a global benchmark released earlier this month, which ranks 50 countries by the true cost of private healthcare using international private medical insurance (IPMI) premiums as of August 2025.\n\nIn Europe, the UK ($11,726) and Greece ($9,654) sit at the pricier end due in part to insurance taxes, it said. while Switzerland ranks mid-table at $8,912. The UAE ranks 10th globally, with an average of $9,680.\n\nSome of the mid-range markets include South Africa, Saudi Arabia, and Monaco, which range from roughly $7,100 to $7,600.\n\nKevin Bürchler, CEO of SIP Medical Family Office, which is behind the SIP Health Cost Index 2025, said inflation in private healthcare \"is rising worldwide, but the pace and pattern differ dramatically.\"\n\nSpeaking to Business Insider, he pointed to \"value\" destinations such as Italy, Portugal, and Austria, which offer lower costs and proximity to top-tier medical hubs like Switzerland and Germany.\n\nWhile ultra-high-net-worth individuals can absorb steep premiums, the cost gap matters for affluent families, especially those planning toward retirement, he said.\n\n\"It can make a significant difference whether you pay $30,000 plus for private health insurance versus $10,000,\" or whether \"a doctor consultation costs $500 or $50,\" he added.\n\nThat pressure, among other factors, is reshaping behavior, especially among Americans.\n\n\"US citizens were 5% of our client base in 2018, whereas today they comprise 40%,\" Basil Mohr-Elzeki, managing partner at Henley & Partners North America, told Business Insider — a shift he described as part of a broader hedge that includes healthcare resilience.\n\nHe said healthcare costs are explicitly cited in at least 15% of client decisions, making it a top-five factor behind geopolitical risk, global mobility, legacy planning, and tax optimization.\n\nInterest is rising in Portugal, Italy, Greece, Malta, and in cost-effective Latin American options such as Panama and Costa Rica, he said, adding that Turkey also attracts clients for affordable private medical tourism.\n\nMohr-Elzeki said many aging clients are increasingly seeking alternative healthcare options abroad — not only because of the cost, but also to access different medical opinions and treatments outside the US system, which he said, while \"top-tier,\" may have a \"commercial bias.\"\n\nHenley & Partners said the SIP Index is helping clients \"avoid hidden high-cost traps\" as healthcare becomes a central part of global mobility planning.",

    "title": "In the first full year without a longtime investing leader, $55 billion Viking Global lags behind its Tiger Cub peers",
    "description": "Ning Jin, Viking Global's former chief investment officer, left at the end of August 2024 to start his own fund.",
    "fullText": "Eleven months into 2025, $55 billion hedge fund Viking Global sits in an underwhelming position.\n\nThe long-running Tiger Cub — a nickname for the group of firms connected to the late Julian Robertson's Tiger Management — is up just 5.8% through November in its flagship stock-picking hedge fund after a 0.5% gain last month, a person close to the manager told Business Insider.\n\nThis trails the returns of the overall S&P 500, which was up more than 16% through the same stretch, as well as many of the firm's main rivals.\n\nFellow Tiger Cubs Coatue, Maverick, and D1 have all outperformed Andreas Halvorsen's Viking Global through the same stretch. Coatue is up more than 13% through November, a person familiar with the firm told Business Insider. Lee Ainslie's Maverick was up over 23% through November 21, according to HSBC's Hedge Weekly report. And Dan Sundheim's D1 has returned 28% through November in the firm's public equities book, an individual close to the manager told Business Insider.\n\nThe managers mentioned declined to comment or did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nFor Viking, this run of performance coincides with the firm's first calendar year without Ning Jin, the former chief investment officer of the manager.\n\nJin was with Viking for 17 years and was the sole CIO of the firm in 2019 before departing in August of last year. He launched his own firm, Avantyr Capital, earlier this quarter with $1.5 billion.\n\nViking has become somewhat of an incubator for the industry's next generation, as several former executives for the firm have gone on to start their own funds, with Sundheim being the biggest of the Viking spin-offs.\n\nThe firm's current CIO is Justin Walsh, who first joined Viking as an intern in 2010. He started full-time at the manager in 2011 and has steadily climbed the ranks since.\n\nAt a conference last summer, Walsh spoke about the market risks associated with the growth of large multistrategy hedge funds like Citadel and Millennium, as well as his favorite luxury stock, Cartier-owner Richemont. Walsh was the portfolio manager for industrials and consumer stocks before becoming CIO after Jin's departure.\n\nViking's portfolio and investment style differ somewhat from those of its tech-heavy Tiger Cub peers. The manager is known for taking a more diversified approach, with a significant focus on its short book, to hedge market risk.\n\nIn 2022, that paid off for the long-running firm: Viking was down 2.5% that year in its public equities portfolio, while funds like Coatue and Tiger Global suffered much heavier losses.\n\nBut that means the firm can miss out on big gains when the market is powered by a small subset of companies. According to regulatory filings, the manager's biggest holdings, as of the end of the third quarter, are four financial services companies: PNC, JPMorgan Chase, Charles Schwab, and Capital One.\n\nWithin Viking's top 10 holdings, only Microsoft and Taiwan Semiconductor would be considered a part of the AI trade that has fueled much of the overall market's gains in 2025.",

    "fullText": "Kenyan debutant David Munyua caused a huge shock at the PDC World Championship, coming from two sets down to beat world number 18 Mike de Decker in an enthralling end to Thursday's afternoon session.\n\nAlthough Munyua had acquitted himself well on his first appearance at Alexandra Palace, an upset had looked extremely unlikely when the Belgian moved within one set of victory.\n\nMunyua, who works as a vet, missed darts to win the second set, did the same in the third but eventually won it, edged the fourth and fought back to win the match in the fifth.\n\nThe 30-year-old, who qualified via the African Darts Group Qualifier, was broken in the first leg of the decider but produced an astounding outer bull-treble 20-bullseye 135 finish to level it, before holding his nerve to complete victory.\n\nIn his on-stage interview after the match, Munyua described his win as \"amazing\" and said it was a \"very big moment for the sport, for Africa and for Kenya\".\n\nFormer BDO world champion Mark Webster said on Sky Sports: \"This is what the World Championship is all about. Forget about the stats in terms of big averages - it had drama all the way through.\n\n\"David put in a big performance. It just backs up that we're going global with this sport.\"\n\nThe defeat continued De Decker's disappointing record at the World Championship, with the 2024 World Grand Prix winner yet to make it past the last 64 at six appearances at Alexandra Palace.",

    "title": "How Morocco plans to use hosting Afcon as springboard to become a global football powerhouse",
    "description": "Morocco will host the Africa Cup of Nations, which begins on Sunday",
    "fullText": "Morocco is poised to host the Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) from Sunday, an event seen as a crucial stepping stone in its ambitious journey to become a global football powerhouse and a significant dress rehearsal for its co-hosting duties at the 2030 World Cup.\n\nThe North African nation, which famously reached the semi-finals of the 2022 World Cup, will welcome 24 teams from across the continent, utilising nine new or renovated stadiums in six cities.\n\nThis marks only the second time Morocco has staged the biennial tournament, yet it arrives amidst a period of intensified football engagement.\n\nThe country regularly hosts \"home\" games for other African nations during World Cup qualifiers and recently secured the rights to host five consecutive Under-17 Women’s World Cups, alongside the Women’s Africa Cup of Nations in July.\n\nOfficials openly frame this Afcon as a high-visibility dry run for the 2030 World Cup, where Morocco will serve as a primary co-host alongside Spain and Portugal, with Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay each hosting a single match.\n\nA cornerstone of Morocco's grand vision is the planned Hassan II Stadium, projected to be the world's largest football arena with a capacity of 115,000 upon its completion in 2028.\n\nThis new national stadium epitomises one of Africa's most aggressive infrastructure drives.\n\nBeyond sports, Morocco has pursued rapid development across various sectors, updating airports, expanding high-speed rail networks, and attracting major tourism investments to cities such as Marrakech and Tangier, all aimed at accommodating a surge in visitors.\n\nThe Royal Moroccan Football Federation has simultaneously invested heavily in youth development and coaching, aiming to elevate standards across the sport.\n\nA prime example is the lavish Mohammed VI Football Complex near Rabat, which serves as the training base for the senior national team during the Africa Cup. This commitment to nurturing young talent appears to be yielding results.\n\nMorocco's historic run to the 2022 World Cup semi-finals was a first for any African or Arab side, and the nation further cemented its rising status by winning the Under-20 World Cup in October.\n\nFouzi Lekjaa, president of the Royal Moroccan Football Federation, articulated this ambition to French sports paper L’Equipe in July, stating: \"It’s not dreaming, we have legitimate ambitions.\"\n\nLekjaa, who also manages budget affairs within the Moroccan prime minister's cabinet, views sport as a vital engine for economic development.\n\nHowever, these significant investments have not been without controversy, sparking heated debate regarding the nation's priorities.\n\nWhile thousands of visitors will encounter areas rich with hotels, restaurants, new roads, and other tourist infrastructure, vast swathes of the country present a stark contrast.\n\nIn rural regions, far removed from financial hubs, residents frequently voice complaints of neglect and a lack of investment, citing critical issues such as healthcare, literacy, and employment.\n\nDuring \"Gen Z\" demonstrations earlier this year, protesters notably chanted, \"Stadiums are here but where are the hospitals,\" directly linking the substantial football investments to broader societal inequalities.\n\nYoung people, in particular, express frustration over overcrowded schools, deteriorating hospitals, and inconsistent basic services.\n\nPrime Minister Aziz Akhannouch’s government has faced accusations of channelling billions into prestige projects like stadiums instead of addressing pressing social needs.\n\nSeveral members of Morocco's national team publicly supported these protests. In October, King Mohammed VI asserted that these two categories of development were not mutually exclusive or in competition.\n\nThe tournament also unfolds as Morocco actively works to solidify its position as a regional power.\n\nThrough its \"Atlantic Initiative,\" the country has sought to deepen ties with landlocked nations in West and Central Africa, expanding the reach of its banking and telecommunications industries and offering those without coastlines access to newly constructed ports.\n\nMorocco's normalisation of ties with Israel has strengthened its relationship with the United States, and it has also garnered support from most European Union members regarding its sovereignty over the disputed Western Sahara.\n\nThis issue, however, remains a source of tension with Algeria, despite a UN Security Council resolution this year that Morocco interpreted as a breakthrough.\n\nThe Polisario Front, based in southern Algeria, continues to advocate for the territory’s independence.\n\nFurthermore, while Morocco has offered tourist visas to spectators attending the Africa Cup, it has simultaneously moved in recent years to curb migration from some of the participating countries.\n\nFor instance, visa requirements for Ivorian citizens were reinstated last year, partly to deter irregular migration attempts.\n\nMorocco has long been perceived as a gateway to Europe, sharing a border with the EU via the Spanish territories of Ceuta and Melilla on the North African coast, and with Spain’s Canary Islands approximately 100 kilometres away.\n\nThe kingdom has drawn criticism from migrant rights groups for its aggressive enforcement measures, including clearing encampments and relocating migrants to remote areas far from European borders.\n\nThe Moroccan Association for Human Rights’ Rabat branch reported an increase in arbitrary arrests and forced expulsions of migrants in the run-up to the Africa Cup this week.\n\nThe Africa Cup of Nations final is scheduled for 18 January at Prince Moulay Abdellah Stadium in Rabat, which opened in September.",

Whether you’re sitting shoulder-to-shoulder with a friend or coordinating online across continents, there’s something uniquely enjoyable about overcoming challenges together.\n\nXbox’s ecosystem, bolstered by Game Pass and cross-platform support, has become a standout destination for cooperative play of all kinds. From story-driven adventures built entirely around teamwork to sprawling survival sandboxes that let players create their own world, the platform offers one of the richest selections of co-op experiences anywhere--often without the need to break the bank.\n\nThis list isn’t about the biggest names; it’s about games that foster connection. Some push innovation in engaging cooperative gameplay, others are great drop-in titles for visiting friends, and a few provide you with enough ridiculous moments to break ice of any thickness. Whatever your preferred genre or style of co-op play, you'll find something on this list that'll have you coordinating, competing, and celebrating with your pals.\n\nFew games embody the spirit of cooperation as fully as It Takes Two. Designed from the ground up to require two players, this award-winning adventure blends platforming, puzzle-solving, and genre-hopping creativity into one of the most joyful (but also emotionally-devastating) couch co-op experiences available.\n\nEvery chapter introduces new mechanics, from magnet-powered abilities to time-manipulation sequences. These developments often echo the emotional journey of the two emotionally fraught characters, and progress demands communication, synchronization, and trust. It Takes Two's Friend’s Pass makes it even more accessible, allowing one purchase to cover both players, or to experience a demo if you've not yet taken the plunge. Whether you’re battling giant squirrels in the wild or navigating miniature worlds inside a child’s room, the adventure confronts you with themes of unity, loyalty, and the depths of familial love. It Takes Two remains one of the best co-op experiences not just on Xbox, but in gaming as a whole.\n\nHalo has long defined cooperative shooting on Xbox, with many entries in the series still regarded as the best shooters by many, and The Master Chief Collection stands as the definitive way to experience the franchise with friends. This massive compilation includes six full campaigns, all playable cooperatively (although cross-play only works for Halo 3-4 main campaign and ODST).\n\nEach entry offers a slightly different flavour of teamwork, from the tense corridors of the original to the squad-based vehicular chaos of later games, and offers more than 120 multiplayer maps as well as community-created co-op content.\n\nOnline co-op allows up to four players in many campaigns, while local play supports two, making it ideal for both couch and online sessions. While still a good nostalgic time, performance improvements and quality-of-life updates have polished the experience significantly since launch. Whether you’re revisiting the series or discovering it for the first time, The Master Chief Collection remains a benchmark for cooperative FPS gameplay and an essential piece of Xbox history. Why not play it on the console it was made for?\n\nPowerwash Simulator 2 builds on the surprisingly addictive formula of the original by expanding environments, tools, and multiplayer options into a full-fledged shared experience in online, shared, and split-screen co-op. The premise is simple (you just clean things) but the game's simplicity gives way to relaxing, collaborative gameplay that'll see hours pass by as if they were minutes. Working together to restore derelict vehicles, muddied murals, and crusty old houses, turns into a calming blend of methodical cleaning and quiet teamwork. You could even use it to catch up about the day's events.\n\nThe sequel features more intricate multi-stage jobs, improved water physics, and new powerwasher customization options. Co-op lets you divide and conquer or tackle hard-to-reach angles together, and communication naturally emerges as you and your partner strategize how to approach each mess. It’s the kind of game that encourages conversation, turning long sessions into both a chill hangout and a satisfying completionist exercise. If you’re looking for low-stress, feel-good co-op where you can yap over low-stakes gameplay, Powerwash Simulator 2 is an excellent choice. Keep an eye out for new DLC, updates, and free content coming in 2026.\n\nChaotic, unpredictable, and consistently hilarious, Totally Reliable Delivery Service is a physics-based sandbox where the goal of delivering packages is often less central than the floppy hijinks that happen along the way.\n\nUp to four players can join forces to race, tumble, awkwardly grapple, and ragdoll their way through a world packed with toys, vehicles, and interactive objects. The intentionally wobbly controls mean getting just about anything done is a bit of an adventure, whether you're desperately hanging onto a helicopter carrying a fragile box or launching your team into orbit with explosive machinery. Have you delivered anything in one piece? Probably not. Did you have fun doing it? Absolutely. Totally Reliable Delivery Service rarely punishes failure; in fact, failure is often the best part. It's a reliably funny pick for friend groups who are happiest when embracing the absurd.\n\nWhile Formula 1 might initially seem like a solitary sport, what with being alone in the cockpit of a car for most of it, F1 25 brings in an element of competitive and cooperative racing thanks to solid online functionality and couch co-op modes.\n\nWhether you want to compete on the same team or join a full multiplayer grid, the sense of shared progression makes the game a bit more immersive than just blasting through countless races on your own. Although we missed an F1 game in 2026, the game’s refined physics, snappy circuits, and broadcast-quality vibe make it feel every bit the modern game. It's not bad for first-time drivers, either, with accessible assists ensuring new players can keep up. F1 25 can also be played in VR, so if you're a fan of great VR games, you can literally put yourself in the driver's seat for this one.\n\nWe don't often give games 10/10 but in our Split Fiction review, we had to award this highest of accolades. This game truly is an unmissable co-op experience on Xbox. It has to be played to be believed.\n\nSplit Fiction is a two-player adventure from the creators of It Takes Two, another that made the list. Like the studio’s earlier title, every element--from puzzle design to narrative progression--requires genuine teamwork. It's not just a slapped on multiplayer mode, but a game built for two.\n\nProtagonists Mio and Zoe are full of character and charm, traversing beautifully realized realities that shift between sci-fi structures, fantastical landscapes, and surreal dream spaces, each introducing new mechanics that emphasize collaboration, and each written or imagined by the leads themselves. It's a literary tale of friendship and creative identity, bringing together two disparate characters and their inner worlds. Whether you're manipulating time, controlling gravity, or using asymmetric abilities to bridge gaps, both players remain equally essential throughout the experience. We can't sing its praises enough.\n\nThe Hazelight Friend Pass returns, allowing two people to play with only one copy of the game, and lowering the barrier to entry. You've really got no excuse not to play one of 2025's best games on Xbox.\n\nGrounded 2 is still in development so while you can play it on Xbox GamePass, and it's one of the best current Xbox GamePass games, it might have plenty of… bugs (sorry). It's a tried and tested formula, though, by shrinking players to insect size and dropping them into a backyard teeming with danger, Grounded 2 transforms everyday blades of grass into towering forests and ants into territorial predators, expanding on the groundwork established by the original game.\n\nCo-op is where the game's survival-crafting elements truly shine. Up to four players can work together to build bases, craft survival tools, and explore the expansive yard, discovering secrets and confronting increasingly hostile creatures. The dynamics of survival feel more approachable and enjoyable when shared, and it's a nice light-hearted alternative to usually gloomy survival games. With ongoing updates until the game leaves early access, Grounded 2 continues to expand its world, so now is the perfect time to jump in with both feet.\n\nVampire Survivors lets up to four players combine chaotic builds as they face endless waves of monsters in increasingly wild arenas. Cooperative play drastically alters the game’s single-stick shooter rhythm--abilities overlap, bullets multiply, and strategic synergy becomes more important as enemies flood the screen. It. Is. Chaos.\n\nLocal co-op for up to 4 players makes it easy to team up and introduce new friends to this bullet storm breakthrough. You can revive each other, share pickups, and lean into different upgrade paths to balance damage, defense, or support roles. The game’s quick sessions make it ideal for players looking to jump in for fast, intense runs without heavy time commitments. Despite its simple, retro aesthetic, Vampire Survivors delivers one of the most engaging co-op loops on Xbox thanks to its unpredictability, progression system, and endlessly satisfying power curve. Also: big walls of bullets are always fun.\n\nOvercooked! remains one of the definitive couch co-op series thanks to its frantic kitchen chaos, escalating absurdity, and teamwork that pushes friendships to their limits. Overcooked! All You Can Eat combines both games into one delicious dish, along with plenty of new content and a full remaster.\n\nUp to four players must coordinate to chop ingredients, cook dishes, wash plates, and serve recipes under increasingly ridiculous scenarios--just try not to lose your cool, it's surprisingly easy to do so. Communication becomes both your greatest weapon and source of silliness as plans fall apart and the group scrambles to salvage orders before the timer runs out. The addition of online multiplayer broadens accessibility, while new recipes, mechanics, and cooperative abilities enhance the game's replayability. Whether you’re cooperating to serve a dish you'd be proud of, or accidentally sabotaging each other in the heat of the moment, Overcooked! is one of the best value for money party games on Xbox where just about anyone can instantly enjoy.\n\nSet within a sprawling, disaster-stricken research facility, Abiotic Factor blends survival, crafting, base-building, and exploration. Up to six players can work together as brilliant scientists navigating dangerous anomalies, otherworldly creatures, and the remnants of failed experiments. The game encourages players to take on complementary roles, from security teams and engineers to phytogenic botanists, each contributing unique skills to group survival.\n\nCo-op builds naturally as you divide tasks like defending choke points, researching new tools, or expanding secure safe rooms--remember, you do have to live here too. Environmental puzzles and randomized threats keep sessions unpredictable, while its emphasis on exploration rewards groups who communicate and plan. Abiotic Factor is a co-op Xbox game that'll have you hooked right from the start with its ridiculous tongue-in-cheek humor and limitless possibilities.\n\nA timeless sandbox classic and all-round cozy game, Terraria transforms into an entirely different experience when played cooperatively. With friends, its vast 2D world becomes a shared playground where you can collaborate on ambitious structures, share resources, and tackle bosses that benefit from coordinated combat. The Paladin's Shield accessory, for example, functions best in multiplayer, bolstering the team's defences with a buff that pulls damage onto the wearer.\n\nThe game’s progression system encourages players to split up tasks--mining for ores, exploring biomes, gathering rare items, or defending home bases, for example--while coming together for major milestones like defeating the Wall of Flesh and advancing into Hardmode. Co-op amplifies the game’s sense of discovery as players uncover secrets and generate shared stories, structures, and in-game lives. Even more than a decade after release, Terraria remains endlessly replayable thanks to frequent updates, deep crafting systems, and open-ended creativity.",

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Stacey Kennedy, the US CEO for Philip Morris International, based in Stamford, Connecticut. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI began my career with Philip Morris International, a tobacco company, in 1995 as a territory sales manager. I held several other positions before becoming vice president of sales for the Southeast region in Atlanta in 2006.\n\nFrom there, I worked in Lausanne at the VP level and subsequently became the managing director for multiple countries in Europe, before being appointed president of the South and Southeast Asia region. I assumed the role of CEO of PMI's US business in January 2023.\n\nI just celebrated 30 years at PMI. I've spent half of my career in the US and half outside the US. I'm a former smoker myself who switched to IQOS, a heated tobacco product, more than a decade ago.\n\nHere's what a typical day in my life looks like.\n\nI allow myself five minutes to check my phone and ensure there's nothing urgent, as we're a global business and things can happen overnight.\n\nI start my mornings with a mantra of 'pay myself first.' I've adopted the mental image of putting my own oxygen mask on first, because if you start the day refreshed, you can show up as a better leader.\n\nIn my ideal morning, I get out of the house and take a mindful walk in my neighborhood. I add a 15-minute yoga routine after the walk.\n\nThe less ideal morning is when I skip the walk, either because the weather isn't great or I decide to trade it for 30 minutes of extra sleep, and then try to get my 15 minutes of yoga and stretching to start the day, regardless.\n\nI'm not a big breakfast person, so I might grab a handful of berries or a couple of figs. I always have a double espresso from my Nespresso machine. Occasionally, I'll have a matcha from a Cuzen Matcha maker.\n\nI usually go into the office in Stamford four days a week on average, and it's about a 25-minute drive away. What makes me anxious before walking into the office is whether the business is moving fast enough — if we're innovating with urgency while staying disciplined and responsible.\n\nMy mornings are filled with meetings. I've ensured we have a well-organized office layout with numerous open spaces, a barista bar, and coffee corners.\n\nI spend a lot of my morning with my direct reports, working on our strategic plans, and there's a lot of travel mixed in there, too.\n\nWe have our flagship factory in Owensboro, Kentucky, and we're building a new factory in Aurora, Colorado. Additionally, we have an office in Washington, D.C., where I spend time on policy and regulatory matters. I work with our teams and policymakers and regulators, including the FDA, to ensure adult smokers have access to better alternatives.\n\nWe start with the global management team and board meetings, which are fixed on the calendar. We're usually six weeks out for non-fixed things that come up on the schedule.\n\nWe've developed interesting ways to ensure that there's free and flexible time. We have something called P.O.D.D. meetings — a problem, opportunity, discussion, and decision meeting. We address issues that arise and ensure we don't miss a critical opportunity.\n\nOne of my leadership principles is to identify your strengths and operate from a position of strength, while also acknowledging your weaknesses. I have my fair share of flaws; one of mine is the importance of running timely, efficient, and effective meetings.\n\nI'm not a particularly timely person myself — I just don't possess that capability. To me, time is a concept, and as a curious person, I love engaging in conversations. When I get into a deep discussion or solve a problem, I honestly can't tell you if I've spent 40 minutes or four hours, because I'm fully immersed. My husband is an extremely timely person, so this drives him bananas.\n\nI think it's a great way to sit and hear different topics from different groups.\n\nI usually have lunch in a conference room or an open space. Sometimes, I go down to the canteen, but I prefer to have a smaller group with me so I can actually have a conversation.\n\nIf I'm choosing my meal, it's usually a salad with grilled chicken and a drizzle of olive oil. If it's a lunch arranged around a bigger meeting, my assistant chooses, and I'm very happy to eat what someone else has decided. It's one less decision to make.\n\nI take a moment at the end of the day with my chief of staff and assistant to reflect on what we accomplished that day and review the schedule for the rest of the week.\n\nMy job is very demanding, and it's easy to get overwhelmed; it's also easy to get frustrated. My non-negotiable indulgence that gets me through the day is a strong espresso and an IQOS break.\n\nDuring the moments when things feel overwhelming, I almost always go to a gratitude practice. It's amazing how much it shifts your entire mood and perspective away from the things that frustrate or make you grumpy and onto the things that are so important to be grateful for.\n\nI try to have dinner with the family at 7 p.m., but sometimes it ends up being 7:30 p.m., depending on whether my teenage 16-year-old twins have sports practice after school.\n\nNormally, I'm the chef, and when I travel, I try to set my husband up for success — he's definitely not a chef. We had to have crockpot lessons.\n\nI cook a Mediterranean-style diet. It's likely a salad with grilled fish and possibly rice.\n\nWe have a 'check your phone at the door' policy, and it's been a game changer for the whole family. My husband almost always brings an interesting topic to the dinner table. It's a great way for our kids to develop their own perspective on things.\n\nI've gotten into a couple of shows with the kids on weekends, and my son has a wicked sense of humor, so we got into Parks and Recreation. We don't watch TV during the week, because they're off with their homework.\n\nI almost always have a decaf espresso with my husband after dinner and debrief on our day.\n\nI read in the evening for anywhere between 30 and 60 minutes. I usually allow myself two fiction books and a nonfiction book. I save fiction for the weekend, because once I start a fiction book, it's really hard to put it down.\n\nGoing to bed before 10 p.m. is really tough for me, but I try to have my lights out by 11 p.m. so I can have an ideal morning.\n\nI usually do a quick check-in before I start reading, so if everything's OK by 10 p.m., we're good to go.\n\nIf I check in, I try not to get caught up in responding to everyone. Sometimes I do. I might send my chief of staff a quick note so that she can get this organized first thing in the morning, but I limit myself to no more than five to 10 minutes of work-related tasks at night.\n\nWhen I go to bed, I'm a great sleeper. I'm about asleep the second my head hits the pillow.\n\nI rarely go into the office, but I do work to engineer any tasks that need to be done on the weekends around the family schedule.\n\nI attend as many regattas as I can. My son is in crew and loves it, and my daughter's in debate. I volunteer as a parent judge at debate competitions.\n\nMy non-routine routine is what helps me show up as my best. If I'm too routine and scheduled, I feel like I'm in a box. I need a bit of free space and curiosity to drive me.",

    "fullText": "Study author says tech companies are reaping benefits of artificial intelligence age but society is left to pay cost\n\nThe AI boom has caused as much carbon dioxide to be released into the atmosphere in 2025 as emitted by the whole of New York City, it has been claimed.\n\nThe global environmental impact of the rapidly spreading technology has been estimated in research published on Wednesday which also found that AI-related water use now exceeds the entirety of global bottled-water demand.\n\nThe figures have been compiled by the Dutch academic Alex de Vries-Gao, the founder of Digiconomist, a company that researches the unintended consequences of digital trends. He claimed they are the first attempt to measure the specific effect of artificial intelligence rather than datacentres in general as the use of chatbots such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini soared in 2025.\n\nThe figures show the estimated greenhouse gas emissions from AI use are also now equivalent to more than 8% of global aviation emissions. His study used technology companies’ own reporting and he called for stricter requirements for them to be more transparent about their climate impact.\n\n“The environmental cost of this is pretty huge in absolute terms,” he said. “At the moment society is paying for these costs, not the tech companies. The question is: is that fair? If they are reaping the benefits of this technology, why should they not be paying some of the costs?”\n\nDe Vries-Gao found that the 2025 carbon footprint of AI systems could be as high as 80m tonnes, while the water used could reach 765bn litres. He said it was the first time AI’s water impact had been estimated and showed that AI water use alone was more than a third higher than previous estimates of all datacentre water use.\n\nThe figures are published in the academic journal Patterns. The International Energy Agency (IEA) said earlier this year that AI-focused datacentres draw as much electricity as power-thirsty aluminium smelters and datacentre electricity consumption is expected to more than double by 2030.\n\n“This is yet more evidence that the public is footing the environmental bill for some of the richest companies on Earth,” said Donald Campbell, the director of advocacy at Foxglove, a UK non-profit that campaigns for fairness in tech. “Worse, it is likely just the tip of the iceberg. The datacentre construction frenzy, driven by generative AI, is only getting started.\n\n“Just one of these new ‘hyperscale’ facilities can generate climate emissions equivalent to several international airports. And in the UK alone, there are an estimated 100-200 of them in the planning system,” said Campbell.\n\nThe IEA has reported that the largest AI-focused datacentres being built today will each consume as much electricity as 2m households with the US accounting for the largest share of datacentre electricity consumption (45%) followed by China (25%) and Europe (15%).\n\nThe largest datacentre being planned in the UK, at a former coal power station site in Blyth, Northumberland, is expected to emit more than 180,000 tonnes of CO2 a year when at full operation – the equivalent to the amount produced by more than 24,000 homes.\n\nIn India, where $30bn (£22.5bn) is being invested in datacentres, there are growing concerns that a lack of reliability from the National Grid will mean the construction of huge diesel generator farms for backup power, which the consultancy KPMG this week called “a massive … carbon liability”.\n\nTechnology companies’ environmental disclosures are often insufficient to assess even the total datacentre impact, never mind isolating AI use, said De Vries-Gao. He noted that when Google recently reported on the impact of its Gemini AI, it did not account for the water used in generating the electricity needed to power it.\n\nGoogle reported that in 2024 it managed to reduce energy emissions from its datacentres by 12% due to new clean energy sources, but it said this summer that achieving its climate goals was “now more complex and challenging across every level – from local to global” and “a key challenge is the slower-than-needed deployment of carbon-free energy technologies at scale”.\n\nGoogle was approached for comment.",

    "fullText": "Billionaire Mark Cuban isn't pretending to have all the answers. When someone on Bluesky said he could “literally end world hunger” without making a dent in his net worth, Cuban didn't brush it off. Instead, he answered, “I’m in! Tell me how.”\n\nWhen a second user doubled down, saying Cuban must not be that smart if he didn't know how his wealth could help end hunger, Cuban fired back sarcastically: “I’m dumb. I can’t figure out how to end world hunger.” But he quickly pivoted to something he believes he can do something about: the American healthcare system.\n\n“I do promise that I will continue to change healthcare in this country and make it more affordable, possibly setting a path towards Universal Healthcare,” Cuban said.\n\nFast Company Calls It a ‘Groundbreaking Step for the Creator Economy' — Investors Can Still Get In at $0.85/Share\n\nEarn While You Scroll: The Deloitte-Ranked #1 Software Company Growing 32,481% Is Opening Its $0.50/Share Round to Accredited Investors.\n\nHe's already been making moves. Through his company, Cost Plus Drugs, Cuban is working to bring down drug prices by eliminating the middlemen who inflate costs. The company adds just a 15% markup on medications and publishes its entire price list online. It now offers over 6,000 medications.\n\nCuban has been especially critical of pharmacy benefit managers, who he believes were supposed to lower costs but have instead become profit-driven giants. According to him, they acquired insurance providers and retail pharmacies and are now attempting to expand into pharmaceutical manufacturing. “They got greedy,” Cuban told Fortune earlier this year.\n\nAlthough Cuban believes “healthcare is a right,” he argues that moving the U.S. to a universal healthcare system isn't the quick fix people assume it is. In a September post on X, he said, “The easy answer is to say Universal Healthcare. The challenge is that every single country that has UHC, moved to it before medical science introduced advanced expensive equipment.”\n\nTrending: An EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace—Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\n\nHe added that the hard part is delivering care fairly without financially devastating doctors and hospitals. “The only challenge is how we design the system that works in this country,” he wrote.\n\nCuban has floated an alternative idea: keep insurers from being the central force, eliminate premiums, and expand cash-pay options with clear pricing. That way, patients would commit to what they can afford, with taxpayers covering the rest.",

His reporting in print and on camera will remain a legacy for aspiring journalists and historians for generations to come,” said Edith Lederer, who was a fellow AP war correspondent in Vietnam in 1972-73 and is now AP’s chief correspondent at the United Nations.\n\nAs a wire-service correspondent, Arnett was known mostly to fellow journalists when he reported in Vietnam from 1962 until the war's end in 1975. He became something of a household name in 1991, however, after he broadcast live updates for CNN from Iraq during the first Gulf War.\n\nWhile almost all Western reporters had fled Baghdad in the days before the U.S.-led attack, Arnett stayed. As missiles began raining on the city, he broadcast a live account by cellphone from his hotel room.\n\n\"There was an explosion right near me, you may have heard,\" he said in a calm, New Zealand-accented voice moments after the loud boom of a missile strike rattled across the airwaves. As he continued to speak air-raid sirens blared in the background.\n\n\"I think that took out the telecommunications center,\" he said of another explosion. “They are hitting the center of the city.”\n\nIt was not the first time Arnett had gotten dangerously close to the action.\n\nIn January 1966, he joined a battalion of U.S. soldiers seeking to rout North Vietnamese snipers and was standing next to the battalion commander when an officer paused to read a map.\n\n\"As the colonel peered at it, I heard four loud shots as bullets tore through the map and into his chest, a few inches from my face,” Arnett recalled during a talk to the American Library Association in 2013. “He sank to the ground at my feet.”\n\nHe would begin the fallen soldier’s obituary like this: \"He was the son of a general, a West Pointer and a battalion commander. But Lt. Colonel George Eyster was to die like a rifleman. It may have been the colonel's leaves of rank on his collar, or the map he held in his hand, or just a wayward chance that the Viet Cong sniper chose Eyster from the five of us standing in that dusty jungle path.\"\n\nArnett had arrived in Vietnam just a year after joining AP as its Indonesia correspondent. That job would be short-lived after he reported Indonesia’s economy was in shambles and the country’s enraged leadership threw him out. His expulsion marked only the first of several controversies in which he would find himself embroiled, while also forging an historic career.\n\nAt the AP’s Saigon bureau in 1962, Arnett found himself surrounded by a formidable roster of journalists, including bureau chief Malcolm Browne and photo editor Horst Faas, who between them would win three Pulitzer Prizes.\n\nHe credited Browne in particular with teaching him many of the survival tricks that would keep him alive in war zones over the next 40 years. Among them: Never stand near a medic or radio operator because they're among the first the enemy will shoot at. And if you hear a gunshot coming from the other side, don't look around to see who fired it because the next one will likely hit you.\n\nArnett would stay in Vietnam until the capital, Saigon, fell to the Communist-backed North Vietnamese rebels in 1975. In the time leading up to those final days, he was ordered by AP’s New York headquarters to begin destroying the bureau’s papers as coverage of the war wound down.\n\nInstead, he shipped them to his apartment in New York, believing they’d have historic value someday. They’re now in the AP’s archives.\n\nArnett remained with the AP until 1981, when he joined the newly-formed CNN.\n\nTen years later he was in Baghdad covering another war. He not only reported on the front-line fighting but won exclusive, and controversial, interviews with then-President Saddam Hussein and future 9/11 mastermind Osama bin Laden.\n\nIn 1995 he published the memoir, “Live From the Battlefield: From Vietnam to Baghdad, 35 Years in the World's War Zones.”\n\nArnett resigned from CNN in 1999, months after the network retracted an investigative report he did not prepare but narrated alleging that deadly Sarin nerve gas had been used on deserting American soldiers in Laos in 1970.\n\nHe was covering the second Gulf War for NBC and National Geographic in 2003 when he was fired for granting an interview to Iraqi state TV during which he criticized the U.S. military’s war strategy. His remarks were denounced back home as anti-American.\n\nAfter his dismissal, TV critics for the AP and other news organizations speculated that Arnett would never work in television news again. Within a week, however, he had been hired to report on the war for stations in Taiwan, the United Arab Emirates and Belgium.\n\nIn 2007, he took a job teaching journalism at China’s Shantou University. Following his retirement in 2014, he and his wife, Nina Nguyen, moved to the Southern California suburb of Fountain Valley.\n\nBorn Nov. 13, 1934, in Riverton, New Zealand, Peter Arnett got his first exposure to journalism when he landed a job at his local newspaper, the Southland Times, shortly after high school.\n\n\"I didn't really have a clear idea of where my life would take me, but I do remember that first day when I walked into the newspaper office as an employee and found my little desk, and I did have a — you know — enormously delicious feeling that I'd found my place,\" he recalled in a 2006 AP oral history.\n\nAfter a few years at the Times, he made plans to move to a larger newspaper in London. En route to England by ship, however, he made a stop in Thailand and fell in love with the country.\n\nSoon he was working for the English-language Bangkok World, and later for its sister newspaper in Laos. There he would make the connections that led him to the AP and a lifetime of covering war.\n\nArnett is survived by his wife and their children, Elsa and Andrew.\n\n\"He was like a brother,\" said retired AP photographer Nick Ut, who covered combat in Vietnam with Arnett and remained his friend for a half century. \"His death will leave a big hole in my life.”\n\nAP journalist Audrey McAvoy contributed to this report.",

    "title": "Gut bacteria have evolved rapidly to digest starches in ultra-processed foods",
    "description": "UCLA study finds gut microbes are evolving differently in industrialized and non-industrialized parts of the world.",
    "fullText": "Gut bacteria evolve rapidly in response to different diets, UCLA evolutionary biologists report in a new study. The researchers found that gene variants that help microbes digest starches found in ultra-processed foods have “swept” the genomes of some species of gut bacteria in industrialized parts of the world. Because these starches are industrially produced and have only been around for a few decades, scientists believe natural selection must have been acting strongly to make these genes dominant so quickly. What’s more, the researchers have discovered that bacteria are evolving differently in industrialized and non-industrialized parts of the world.\n\nThe study’s findings, published in Nature, scanned the genomes of almost three dozen species of gut bacteria using data from around the world and identified a process called horizontal gene transfer, in which bacteria transfer DNA from one strain to another, as the mechanism for this rapid evolution. Horizontal gene transfer has previously been identified as the mechanism that allows bacteria to evolve antibiotic resistance so quickly, but the prevalence of this process in gut microbes has been relatively unknown until now.\n\n“The discovery that the ability to digest novel starches is a target of natural selection in gut bacteria is interesting, but we found an even more robust, stronger signal that there are different targets of selection across many genes and many species in industrialized and non-industrialized populations,” said UCLA doctoral student and paper first author Richard Wolff. “What are the gut microbiomes in industrialized populations responding to? We’ve picked out one example with these starches, but there’s likely many possibilities we haven’t grappled with yet.”\n\nWolff and corresponding author, UCLA professor of ecology and evolutionary biology Nandita Garud, developed a novel statistic that identifies locations in the DNA of 30 gut bacteria species where genes have risen to high frequency, or “swept,” in that species. The statistic looks for tiny regions of homogeneity against a backdrop of immense diversity separating different strains of the same species.\n\n“Different strains of E. coli, for example, have diverged from each other as much as humans have diverged from chimps, yet we call them the same species. Despite this diversity, there are still shared fragments of DNA present in many hosts — a hidden thread connecting our microbiomes,” said Garud.\n\nDifferent genes appeared to be selected for in industrialized and non-industrialized populations, and one gene in particular was sweeping only in industrialized populations. That gene is associated with the ability to digest maltodextrin, which is made from cornstarch and has been used in processed foods since the 1960s.\n\n“We saw the adaptive signal very strongly, but we can’t say for sure yet if it’s specializing in maltodextrin or a broader class of starch derivatives. There might be intermediate steps as the bacteria adapt to different starch sources,” said Wolff. “There are a lot of steps in between eating a diet full of cassava and breadfruit and a diet full of Hot Cheetos or something like that.”\n\nBacteria can take up DNA from their environment in many different ways: They can eat it; they can be infected by a virus that carries DNA between them; and it can be transmitted when bacteria clump together and form a bridge that allows them to move between each other.\n\nBut humans have only a few strains of the same species of gut bacteria, and these strains typically stay with each person for many years. So the pervasiveness of the newly discovered adaptation raises the question: How do DNA fragments become shared between individual humans?\n\n“Each person might have a couple of different strains of E. coli,” said Garud. “If fragments of DNA are transmitted horizontally across different strains in different hosts, and these strains seemingly are faithful to their respective hosts, where do they recombine? How do they move between individual people to become fixed in a whole population?”\n\nWhile the answer will emerge with future research, the discovery that gut bacteria evolve rapidly in response to different diets, and the possibility that novel starches may be exerting strong evolutionary pressure on them, suggest that careful attention to what we eat could play a more varied role in promoting good health than we think.\n\nThe research was funded by the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation.",

    "description": "YouTube announced that it has secured the global rights to Hollywood's biggest night, a major victory in the fight over live events.",
    "fullText": "Hollywood's biggest night is going to a streamer.\n\nThe Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced on Wednesday that YouTube will hold the global rights to the Oscars from 2029 through 2033.\n\nWhile that means they'll no longer be on ABC starting in 2029, ending a more than 50-year run of consecutive broadcasts on the television network, the Oscars will continue to be available for free worldwide — just on YouTube and YouTube TV. As part of the partnership, red carpet coverage and other behind-the-scenes content from before the award show is also included.\n\nThe news comes as streamers like YouTube, Netflix, and Amazon Prime, and others, increasingly compete over live events to host on their respective platforms. Historically, the Oscars are one of the most-watched nights of TV, and in non-presidential election years, it is often the only non-sporting event to chart within the top 100 most-watched telecasts of the year.\n\n\"The Oscars are one of our essential cultural institutions, honoring excellence in storytelling and artistry,\" YouTube CEO Neal Mohan said in a statement. \"Partnering with the Academy to bring this celebration of art and entertainment to viewers all over the world will inspire a new generation of creativity and film lovers while staying true to the Oscars' storied legacy.\"\n\nDisney and ABC will continue to hold the rights to the Oscars through 2028, including the milestone 100th Academy Awards.\n\nOutside of the Oscars, the Google Arts & Culture initiative will provide digital access to select Academy Museum exhibitions and programs, the academy said in a statement.\n\nThe agreement was also struck at a time when YouTube has evolved beyond a place people post and watch short clips and amateur videos on mobile and desktop to become a fixture in the living room. The monthly Nielsen Gauge shows YouTube grabbing the top spot in share of TV viewing among media companies for months running, with a 12.9% share in October, ahead of Disney (11.4%) and NBCUniversal (8.6%).\n\nThe nature of what people are watching has also changed. The streaming data analysis company Digital i found that videos lasting 30 minutes or more accounted for 73% of total viewing on YouTube in the US in October 2024, up 8% from a year earlier.\n\nYouTube has encouraged this shift, rolling out new tools for creators to incentivize them to make serialized shows that look like what you think of as traditional TV.\n\nYouTube's living room-domination plans loomed in the background of its recent highly public dispute with Disney over how much it should pay the media company to carry its channels like ESPN and ABC News on YouTube TV. Google recently shared numbers showing YouTube TV was the No. 4 pay-TV service in the US.\n\nTraditional media companies have tried to combat YouTube's expansion by taking a page from the platform and striking deals with YouTube video creators and podcasters.",

    "description": "“I don't even know how it's been approved, to be honest,” said boxing world champ Skye Nicolson.",
    "fullText": "Anthony Joshua will make quick work of Jake Paul when the fighters collide atop a Netflix show at the Kaseya Center in Miami, Florida, this Friday, Dec. 19.\n\nThat’s according to former WBC featherweight world champion and current WBC interim super bantamweight titleholder Skye Nicolson, a Matchroom stablemate of Joshua’s, who told Uncrowned on Tuesday that “it’s going to be very one-sided, and over early, in favor of Anthony Joshua.”\n\nThe fight represents a considerable step-up for Paul, who has feasted mostly on a diet of past-their-prime MMA fighters and journeymen boxers in the boxing ring.\n\nHis sole loss came against Tommy Fury in 2023, but he has since rebounded with visible improvements and wins over Mike Perry, a 58-year-old Mike Tyson, and a 39-year-old Julio Cesar Chavez Jr., the latter of whom is a former middleweight world champion.\n\nRegardless, the gulf in amateur background, skill set and accomplishments between Paul and Joshua, a former two-time heavyweight king, is vast. And Joshua is the heavy betting favorite for a reason.\n\nNicolson commended Paul for his “almost delu-lu confidence” but said she couldn’t “see it going any other way apart from a very one-sided early finish” because “it's [a] scarily dangerous” matchup for Paul.\n\n“I don't even know how it's been approved, to be honest, but I guess money talks,” Nicolson said on Uncrowned's \"The Ariel Helwani Show.\" “We'll see on Friday, but I don't see what Jake's seeing.”\n\nOne of the things Paul perhaps sees is Joshua’s apparent struggles when dealing with fighting smaller heavyweights, as 6-foot-2 fighter Andy Ruiz Jr. shook up the world by upsetting Joshua in 2019, before 6-foot-3 Oleksandr Usyk toppled \"AJ\" in back-to-back bouts in 2022 to 2023.\n\n“Ruiz, Usyk … Jake Paul? There's levels,\" Nicolson said.\n\nShe then reiterated her prediction for the fight, and that it would represent a poor reflection for the sport of boxing if it even went the distance. “If it goes past two rounds, I will be shocked,” she said.\n\nNicolson continued: “I think [Paul's] improved. He works really, really hard. He’s putting his absolute all into it. You can't knock any of the effort, but there are levels. And [Joshua] is not an Olympic gold medalist and a former world champion for nothing. He's naturally huge. And Jake Paul's not. If it goes past two rounds, I will be very shocked.”\n\nNicolson finished by remarking that the only acceptable result for boxing, and for Joshua, is for the Brit to batter Paul. “If he goes the distance with Jake Paul, it’s not good for boxing,” she said.\n\n“It’s good for boxing if he doesn’t kill Jake, obviously, which is possible. But … if it goes eight whole rounds and he doesn’t knock out Jake, that will definitely be tainting to AJ’s legacy.”\n\nThe Paul vs. Joshua main card airs Friday on Netflix from 8 p.m. ET.

This is a war provocation of an unprecedented scale,” he said about the EU using frozen Russian assets. “Therefore, at today’s Foreign Affairs Council, I will make it clear that for Hungary, the risk of further escalation is unacceptable.

    "fullText": "DETROIT, Dec 16 (Reuters) - Ford CEO Jim Farley walked through Ford’s Michigan design studio Monday afternoon, reflecting on how he was about to wipe out thousands of work hours on electric vehicles that he and his team had hoped would revolutionize the American auto industry.\n\nShortly after, his company announced it would kill several of those battery-powered models and take a $19.5 billion writedown on EV-related assets. It marked the industry’s ​biggest electric-vehicle retreat since U.S. President Donald Trump’s sweeping auto-policy changes iced already cooling EV demand.\n\nFarley had spent years telling staff and investors that catching up to Tesla and China’s leading EV makers amounted to an existential struggle. ‌Now – after losing about $13 billion on EVs since 2023 – Farley says the path to survival lies in ditching these unprofitable models.\n\n“We can't allocate money for things that will not make money,” he told Reuters on Monday. “As much as I love those products, the customers in the U.S. were not going to pay for ‌them. And that was the end of that.”\n\nFarley’s angst reflects the broader conundrum facing auto executives in the wake of Trump-administration policies that stripped the industry of EV subsidies and eased restrictions on tailpipe pollution.\n\nMost automakers now can’t sell EVs in the U.S. profitably or in volume – but must sell them in China, Europe and other markets to appease regulators and compete with Chinese automakers expanding globally.\n\nThat’s left Ford and other automakers with the challenge of tailoring vastly different vehicle lineups for different regions.\n\nThe approach layers on extra expenses the industry thought it had left behind in recent decades through globalization – making essentially the same car, with common supply chains, to sell worldwide. Fifteen years ago, then-CEO Alan Mulally called the strategy ‘One Ford.’\n\nNow Farley needs many Fords. His company and others have been turning to partnerships to absorb ⁠the extra costs of catering to different global markets. Renault and Ford earlier this month ‌announced they would partner to build affordable EVs for Europe.\n\nFollowing the partnership announcement, Ford said Monday it won’t build the electric commercial van it initially planned for that market. Ford has also been seeking a Chinese partner to provide EV platform technologies, Reuters has reported.\n\nOn EVs, Farley hopes to thread the needle by killing most EV models but preserving a $30,000 midsize electric truck due out in 2027, ‍which a specialized skunkworks team in California has engineered to take on EV powerhouses Tesla and China's BYD.",

    "fullText": "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — Saturn's giant moon Titan may not have a vast underground ocean after all.\n\nTitan instead may hold deep layers of ice and slush more akin to Earth’s polar seas, with pockets of melted water where life could possibly survive and even thrive, scientists reported Wednesday.\n\nThe team led by researchers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory challenged the decade-long assumption of a buried global ocean at Titan after taking a fresh look at observations made years ago by NASA’s Cassini spacecraft around Saturn.\n\nThey stress that no one has found any signs of life at Titan, the solar system’s second largest moon spanning 3,200 miles (5,150 kilometers) and brimming with lakes of liquid methane on its frosty surface.\n\nBut with the latest findings suggesting a slushy, near-melting environment, “there is strong justification for continued optimism regarding the potential for extraterrestrial life,” said the University of Washington’s Baptiste Journaux, who took part in the study published in the journal Nature.\n\nAs to what form of life that might be, possibly strictly microscopic, “nature has repeatedly demonstrated far greater creativity than the most imaginative scientists,\" he said in an email.\n\nJPL’s Flavio Petricca, the lead author, said Titan’s ocean may have frozen in the past and is currently melting, or its hydrosphere might be evolving toward complete freezing.\n\nComputer models suggest these layers of ice, slush and water extend to a depth of more than 340 miles (550 kilometers). The outer ice shell is thought to be about 100 miles (170 kilometers) deep, covering layers of slush and pools of water that could go down another 250 miles (400 kilometers). This water could be as warm as 68 degrees Fahrenheit (20 degrees Celsius).\n\nBecause Titan is tidally locked, the same side of the moon faces Saturn all the time, just like our own moon and Earth. Saturn’s gravitational pull is so intense that it deforms the moon’s surface, creating bulges as high as 30 feet (10 meters) when the two bodies are closest.\n\nThrough improved data processing, Petricca and his team managed to measure the timing between the peak gravitational tug and the rising of Titan’s surface. If the moon held a wet ocean, the effect would be immediate, Petricca said, but a 15-hour gap was detected, indicating an interior of slushy ice with pockets of liquid water. Computer modeling of Titan’s orientation in space supported their theory.\n\nSapienza University of Rome’s Luciano Iess, whose previous studies using Cassini data indicated a hidden ocean at Titan, is not convinced by the latest findings.\n\nWhile “certainly intriguing and will stimulate renewed discussion ... at present, the available evidence looks certainly not sufficient to exclude Titan from the family of ocean worlds,\" Iess said in an email.\n\nNASA’s planned Dragonfly mission — featuring a helicopter-type craft due to launch to Titan later this decade — is expected to provide more clarity on the moon’s innards. Journaux is part of that team.\n\nSaturn leads the solar system’s moon inventory with 274. Jupiter’s moon Ganymede is just a little larger than Titan, with a possible underground ocean. Other suspected water worlds include Saturn’s Enceladus and Jupiter’s Europa, both of which are believed to have geysers of water erupting from their frozen crusts.\n\nLaunched in 1997, Cassini reached Saturn in 2004, orbiting the ringed planet and flying past its moons until deliberately plunging through Saturn’s atmosphere in 2017.\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

The Mag 7 companies — Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), Nvidia (NVDA), and Apple (AAPL) — are essentially fueling the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nThese seven stocks are up on average 21% this year compared to a 15% gain for the S&P 500, according to Yahoo Finance data. Alphabet is the top performer with an advance of 62% amid optimism on its new Gemini 3 model.\n\nIn turn, the valuation of the S&P 500 has reached a level even most bulls would agree is on the rich side. Krishna's work reveals the S&P 500 is trading at the 91st percentile relative to its 10-year valuation history.\n\n\"Complacency\" could ignite an AI bubble, Deutsche Bank strategist Adrian Cox told me on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid (video above).\n\nIndeed, complacency appears to have settled in, despite the risks investors had to endure this year.\n\nRemember the \"Liberation Day\" tariff spectacle in April? The S&P 500 tanked 4.8% the day after President Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs on April 2. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) dropped a staggering 1,679 points.\n\nTariffs are now in effect, though they are not as severe as first advertised.\n\nAnd more recently, disappointments from AI darlings CoreWeave (CRWV) and Oracle (ORCL) have begun to call into question the near-term outlook for the AI trade.\n\n\"I think we're going to see some pretty massive bifurcation in 2026 in the AI trade,\" Sevens Report Research founder Tom Essaye said on Opening Bid.\n\nAlphabet is Essaye's top AI pick for 2026, though he acknowledges there are likely to be winners and losers from the Magnificent Seven complex next year.\n\n\"I think companies like Oracle that [are] not overextended financially but are sort of raising eyebrows with a lot of the spending that is tied to open AI, I think that companies like that could struggle,\" Essaye added. \"There's going to be some pretty serious bifurcation. We've seen it in the last, say, two months of 2025. I think that gets worse in 2026.\"",

    "fullText": "▾ Previous: Around The World, Part 27: Planting trees\n\nFri, 12 Dec 2025 by Thomas ten Cate · Comments\n\n Game Development, Around the World\n\nEven though the in-game world is fairly small compared to Earth, I want it to feel big. Part of that is being able to see things that are far away.\n\nFor context: by now, I have settled on a third-person “chase camera” rather than a top-down view. It feels so much more immersive, and makes the gameplay (in particular, matching up maps to your surroundings) more interesting as well.\n\nRemember that my world is now a flat plane that wraps around, rather than an actual sphere. However, it would be great if we could still make it look like a sphere, so that distant lands would gradually appear over the horizon. Mountains would be visible from a greater distance, so that the terrain actually matters beyond just the shape of the coastline.\n\nUntil now, I’ve been using a view distance of 5 km. That’s still a lot compared to other open-world games! But a landmass at 5 km does not look very far away, because it’s so big. For gameplay purposes, it would be good if view distance could be increased to about 25 km. Otherwise, the part of the world that the player can see is too small compared to the maps, and they won’t have anything to orient themselves by.\n\nHow does it work out if we just look at the geometry? My planar planet is 512 km wide, so let’s pretent that’s the circumference of a spherical planet. Its radius would then be 83 km. Terrain generation is scaled down relative to the real world, so that the tallest mountain is about 2500 m high. Assuming a ship of up to 25 m tall, the mountain’s peak will be visible over the horizon from 22 km away. That’s pretty close to the 25 km I figured out above, so I decided to sail with these numbers for now: let’s fake a planet radius of 83 km.\n\nWe now have some problems to solve.\n\nTo actually be able to sail around the world, you need to be able to sail off the west edge and reappear at the east edge, and vice versa. That’s easy enough to implement with some modular arithmetic applied to the ship’s coordinates. However, any nearby objects and terrain must also exhibit the same wrapping: if you are near the west edge of the world, you should be able to see across it, so anything near the east edge would have to be moved near you as well. This, too, can be implemented with some modular arithmetic.\n\nHowever, it would have to be applied to every object in the game individually. That’s tedious at best, and bad for performance at worst, so I came up with the solution of parenting every object to a 2×2 km chunk. Only the chunks are moving around; their children just come along for the ride. The node hierarchy looks like this:\n\nHere’s an example of how a nearby NPC ship would become visible, even though it’s all the way on the other side of the map in world coordinates:\n\nThe chunks themselves take care to move their children to adjacent chunks whenever they cross a chunk boundary, so the code of individual objects doesn’t need to care about the chunking at all.\n\nAs before with the spherical world, we’re going to run into floating-point precision issues. Godot by default uses 32-bit floats for object and vertex positions, which have only 23 bits of precision; at 512 km from the origin, the distance between two successive floating-point numbers is about 6 cm. The official recommendation in the Godot docs is not to go beyond 8 km for a 3D third-person game, and not beyond 64 km for any 3D game.\n\nI started out hoping that this wouldn’t be an issue, but it turns out to be real: far away from the world origin, the ship started jittering weirdly, and the sails started jittering relative to the ship. A solution was needed.\n\nBuilding Godot with 64-bits precision is possible, but adds a lot of overhead: now every vector and matrix in the game uses twice the memory, including the large procedurally generated terrain meshes. Would that be a problem? Not necessarily, but it turns out there’s now an easier solution.\n\nSince we’re moving chunks around anyway, we can implement a floating origin system there as well. Just before rendering a frame, the chunk containing the player’s ship is moved to the global origin (0, 0), and all other chunks are positioned relative to it:\n\nThis ensures that every object we care about remains close to the global origin, where floating-point precision is sufficient. As long as none of the code assumes that global coordinates (relative to Godot’s global origin) are the same as world coordinates (relative to the north-west corner of the world map), this works great: the jitter is gone.\n\nLet’s take a look at how we could implement a fake planet curvature. In particular, I want distant objects to gradually sink below the horizon.\n\nThis could be done in a vertex shader: simply compute the distance to the camera (measured on the horizontal plane), calculate how far downwards the vertex should move, and move it:\n\nThe drawback is that this shader would need to be applied to every object in the world, meaning I would have to use custom shaders everywhere and couldn’t benefit from Godot’s built-in materials anymore. Tedious! Another drawback is that the visible meshes would no longer align with their physics shapes, which becomes relevant if we want to do object picking (e.g. clicking on the peak of a distant mountain to set a course towards it).\n\nBut I had an idea I wanted to try. Now that we have chunks, maybe we could pull the chunks themselves downwards, and have all their children come along for the ride?\n\nMy first attempt was to introduce some skew. In 3D games, the position and orientation of an object is usually represented as a matrix, and mine is no different. Godot uses 3×4 matrices: a 3×3 part to represent rotation and scale, and a 3x1 part for translation. But rotation has 3 degrees of freedom, and scale has another 3, so that means that we have 3 more degrees of freedom we can play with to make the chunk align (somewhat) with the sphere. Because chunks are in the y = 0 plane and are neither rotated nor scaled, the matrix looks like this, where tx, 0, tz is the translation vector (the chunk’s position):\n\nIf we want to move points within the chunk only on the vertical axis (y), depending on their position in the xz plane, we have two components rx, rz we can play with, as well as ty:\n\nMy idea is then as follows: modify these variables rx, rz, ty in such a way that the chunk’s corners end up on the sphere. Because we have 4 corners and only 3 variables, this is impossible; instead, we do it only for the 3 corners that are closest to the camera, and let the 4th end up where it will. It’s hard to draw in 3D, but in 2D you can see the idea better:\n\nEvery object inside these chunks will end up skewed as well, but because the effect is slight, this shouldn’t be visible.\n\nHere’s how it looks when I modify the curvature in real time:\n\nAt lower curvatures, it’s quite effective!\n\nHowever, there’s a problem with this approach that might not be obvious at first: physics. The built-in Godot Physics engine is well known to be bad at anything except pure translation and rotation; it doesn’t even support scaling. The newly integrated Jolt engine is better in this regard, but it draws the line at skewing, and starts emitting a lot of errors if a physics shape like a cylinder has any skew introduced to it.\n\nSo, let’s try something so stupid that it couldn’t possibly work: do not skew chunks at all, but just move them on the vertical axis, like this:\n\nAmazingly, at small curvatures such as I’m using, this works just fine and the visual difference compared to skewing is not even noticeable. You might think it would introduce visible cracks between terrain chunks, but no: because farther chunks are moved farther downwards, the cracks are always hidden behind nearby terrain. It’s a keeper!\n\nNow that we have the ability to make stuff gradually appear over the horizon, we need some stuff that actually will gradually appear over the horizon. With a ship of 25 m tall, even though the horizon itself is (surprisingly) only 2 km away, we can see tall mountains at a distance of 25 km. So a draw distance of 5 km is not nearly enough anymore.\n\nIt’s easy enough to increase this value in the configuration, but this increased the amount of terrain by a factor of 5² = 25, and tanked the frame rate. Some quick math shows that, at the terrain resolution of 8 m that I’m using, the 50×50 km patch of terrain around the player consists of 39 million triangles, and this is too much for my GPU.\n\nFortunately, we don’t need that many triangles, because on distant terrain they’re smaller than a pixel. It’s time to introduce a LOD (level-of-detail) scheme to our terrain: render nearby terrain at full detail, but reduce the number of triangles on terrain chunks farther away.\n\nA classic problem with this are seams, or cracks, between adjacent terrain meshes of a different LOD. It’s often just a few pixels, but it’s still quite visible especially in motion. Here, I tweaked some values to make the problem more visible:\n\nThere are various solutions. The most elegant is to introduce special bits of mesh to cover the cracks, which are only made visible when the two adjacent terrain chunks are currently displayed at different LODs. Due to all the different edge cases (pun wholeheartedly intended), it’s surprisingly fiddly to get this right.\n\nFortunately there’s a simpler method, which is to simply add a ‘skirt’ of quads that hangs down from the edge of each chunk:\n\nThe normals on the skirt are copied from the adjacent vertices, so they receive the same lighting, and it won’t look as if there’s an actual small cliff there. And with that, the crack is gone:\n\nThis should also cover up any cracks caused by moving chunks vertically, though I haven’t spotted any so far.\n\nThe trees I added in the previous post make a huge difference to the believability and sense of scale of the terrain. It would be sad if they couldn’t be rendered up to a large distance.\n\nHowever, as it currently stands, being near a rainforest will drop the framerate to about 40 fps; the tree meshes take 15 ms to render. Since I want this game to run well on potato hardware, it should run at around 150-200 fps on my mid-range Radeon RX 7600 card, meaning a frame budget of only 5-7 ms.\n\nThe standard trick is to not render full meshes at a large distance, but rather pre-render the mesh into a texture from various points of view, and then just render a single quad with the texture applied: an impostor.\n\nGodot doesn’t have support for impostors built in, but adding tooling inside the editor is really easy, so I built this quick and dirty impostor baking scene:\n\nIt iterates through all the tree meshes at 8 different angles, and renders each to a suitably sized viewport through an orthogonal camera (to simulate an infinite distance). Each orientation is rendered twice: once to capture colour and alpha, once to capture normals. The textures have pretty low resolution, but that’s fine, because they’re never viewed up close anyway:\n\nThese are then applied directly to the impostor quad, depending on the viewing angle:\n\nThis increased the frame rate from 40 fps to about 130 fps. There’s some more low-hanging fruit that will improve the frame rate further, so this is fast enough for the time being.\n\nLet’s see all of the above in action while the player sails towards a remote island: the distant terrain, planet curvature, and tree impostors. I’ve edited the video for brevity, because it ran over 3 minutes; one of the biggest game design challenges will be to make sure the player has something to do during these long voyages.\n\nThe transition from impostors to real geometry is still fairly noticeable, probably because the impostors cast a smaller shadow. But it’s plenty good enough for now.\n\n▾ Previous: Around The World, Part 27: Planting trees",

    "fullText": "A small Ukrainian drone built to chase down and intercept other aerial systems has recently achieved a speed of 400 kmph, or 248.5 mph, Kyiv's digital transformation minister said on Tuesday.\n\n\"400 km/h — that's the speed reached by an interceptor drone powered by a motor from Motor-G, a member of Brave1UA,\" Mykhailo Fedorov wrote in a social media post. Brave1 is Ukraine's defense innovation platform.\n\nSuch a velocity means that the interceptor can beat the official speed record for Formula 1 racing, achieved by Valtteri Bottas in 2016 at 231.46 mph.\n\nA speed of 248.5 mph also allows the drone to nearly match the fastest high-speed trains in the world. The Shanghai Maglev, for example, reached speeds of 280 mph during tests in October, but is commercially operated at 186 mph.\n\nAnd a motor-powered interceptor would be doing so with propellers, rather than the jet engines or high-thrust combustion systems that propel other vehicles to extreme speeds. Because interceptor drones are designed to destroy other drones at a low cost, Ukraine's manufacturers typically price them below $6,000 each.\n\nIt's another sign of how quickly the war is transforming the local weapons industry, which has turned hobbyist drones into some of the fastest yet cheapest aircraft on the battlefield. Four months ago, another Ukrainian interceptor drew widespread attention for reaching 195 mph in flight.\n\nUkraine is now ramping up ambitions to export such war technology, saying that its locally built missiles, drones, and anti-air systems have been tried and tested against Russia.\n\nA video posted by Fedorov on Tuesday said that producing drone motors in Ukraine \"seemed impossible\" just two years ago, but that Motor-G is now making 100,000 motors a month.\n\n\"Today, more and more drones are flying on motors made in Ukraine,\" the minister wrote.\n\nKyiv has been particularly focused on increasing the speed of its interceptors because Russia has been developing its own versions of the Iranian Shahed, which are long-range attack drones.\n\nThe most commonly used models of these loitering munitions fly at roughly 115 to 180 mph, and are often released in large numbers to overwhelm Ukrainian air defenses. The Russian tactic created the urgent need for Ukraine to develop cheap ways to destroy the Shaheds, which led to the rise of interceptor drones.\n\nHowever, Moscow has been repeatedly reported to be experimenting with smaller waves of new jet-powered Shaheds, which are believed to reach speeds of 230 mph.\n\nTheir emergence at the start of the year initially sparked fears in Ukraine that they would be too fast for interceptors to catch, though recent reports and war footage indicate that Ukrainian manufacturers have managed to close the gap.\n\nOne jet-powered Shahed, for example, was filmed being approached by a Ukrainian interceptor from behind in late November.",

    "fullText": "Some of the best opportunities in the market next year could be outside the US.\n\nThat's the outlook among a growing chorus of forecasters on Wall Street, who say international stocks could be among the most promising investments in 2026 as the US market's rally stretches into its fourth year.\n\nGlobal equities are considered a valuable diversification option for investors. For some, that desire has grown stronger in recent months, thanks to high valuations in the tech sector and growing concerns about a potential AI bubble.\n\n\"Because international stocks make up a significant portion of the available equity market, it makes sense for most investors to have some exposure to international stocks,\" Amy Arnott, a portfolio strategist at Morningstar, said in a statement.\n\nThe investment research firm said it compiled a list of top international equity funds and ETFs for investors to consider, screening for funds with the lowest-cost primary share classes that had a gold Morningstar Medalist Rating. The funds that were highlighted also had 100% analyst coverage, meaning they were unilaterally rated as a \"Buy,\" and had at least $100 million in assets.\n\nHere are the funds that topped Morningstar's list, ordered from lowest to highest expense ratio.",

    "title": "Some of SHRM's largest affiliates stress independence after $11.5 million discrimination verdict",
    "description": "Affiliates of the world's largest HR trade group reaffirmed their independence in the wake of a discrimination judgment.",
    "fullText": "Some of the largest affiliates of the Society for Human Resource Management have publicly reaffirmed their operational independence from the trade group after it lost an employee-discrimination lawsuit in a $11.5 million verdict.\n\nBusiness Insider identified LinkedIn posts from 10 US affiliates that reference the case that led to the so-called \"nuclear\" verdict on Dec. 5. That includes SHRM's largest affiliate, in Southern California, which has roughly 3,500 members. All the posts stress how the groups operate independently from SHRM international, which is based in Virginia.\n\n\"While we are an affiliated chapter of SHRM, we are not governed by SHRM's management, and we were not involved in this case,\" said New York City SHRM.\n\n\"We have our own bylaws, board, finances, programming, and strategic priorities,\" wrote Chicago SHRM.\n\nNYC SHRM and Chicago SHRM say they have around 1,400 and 1,000 members, respectively.\n\nSimilar statements were posted on LinkedIn by SHRM affiliates in the northeastern US, Texas, Oregon, Illinois, and California. The vast majority of affiliates have not publicly commented on the legal situation.\n\nSHRM says it has 556 chapters worldwide. The organization sends some funds to its chapters, which may encourage local members to get certified and may also require members to pay dues to the international organization. Chapters are one kind of affiliate; state councils, of which there are 51, are another.\n\nThe organization said in response to Business Insider's questions that the independence of its affiliates \"has always been the case.\"\n\n\"We actually make a point of reminding our chapters and state councils that they are separate legal entities and make their own operational decisions,\" SHRM representative Eddie Burke said in an email. He didn't respond to questions about the substance of the posts.\n\nThe lawsuit that SHRM lost earlier this month was filed in 2022 by Rehab Mohamed, an Egyptian woman who worked at the association as an instructional designer from 2016 until 2020. She said in her complaint that she was racially discriminated against by a white supervisor and faced retaliation for complaining to management.\n\nA Colorado federal jury found SHRM liable on both fronts. The association was hit with $1.5 million in compensatory damages and $10 million for punitive damages. SHRM has said it plans to file an appeal and that the jury's decision \"does not reflect the facts, the law, or the truth of how\" it operates.\n\nJane Billbe, president of Washington State SHRM, told Business Insider in an email that its post \"was intended to provide clarity for our members and stakeholders — not to distance ourselves from SHRM.\"\n\nThe California affiliate, the Professionals In Human Resources Association, wrote on LinkedIn that its code of ethics requires \"that everyone involved with PIHRA act with integrity, comply with applicable laws, and treat others with dignity and respect, free from discrimination, harassment, or retaliation.\"\n\nRafael Rivera, the affiliate's CEO since 2010, told Business Insider that he couldn't recall ever issuing a statement like it and believed some of his group's members were unaware of the distinction between the affiliate and main branch, or that SHRM had just lost an employee-discrimination case.\n\n\"The intent is to inform our audience that may not have the information,\" he said. \"They may assume that we're one and the same.\"\n\nIt's not the first time SHRM and its chapters haven't seen eye-to-eye. In 2016, SHRM sued a Northern California chapter for planning to hold its \"HR West\" event out of state without buy-in from SHRM chapters covering the cities where the event was to be held. The suit was dropped after the judge suggested that the agreement between the two parties wasn't as airtight as SHRM had asserted.\n\nBurke, the SHRM spokesperson, said that chapter \"is no longer part of our affiliated network.\"\n\nSome of the SHRM affiliates that posted on LinkedIn after the recent verdict wrote that they were speaking out because they'd been receiving inquiries from members concerned about the lawsuit and their affiliate's relationship to SHRM international. Some chapters require their members to also be members of SHRM, which increased its annual fee by 13% earlier this year, to $299. Burke said SHRM wouldn't be increasing dues this year.\n\nIn addition to membership, SHRM sells access to HR educational materials and credentialing programs, and bills itself as \"the foremost expert, researcher, advocate, and thought leader on issues and innovations impacting today's evolving workplaces.\"\n\nAhead of the trial, SHRM made an unsuccessful bid to have the plaintiff's lawyers barred from portraying it as a specialist in HR best practices. During the proceedings, the plaintiff argued that SHRM botched its own HR investigation into Mohamed's accusations of discrimination and retaliation.\n\nOne SHRM affiliate, DallasHR, said in its statement on LinkedIn that the verdict underscored the need for HR professionals to support and learn from one another.\n\n\"This is a validation of one of the core reasons DallasHR exists,\" the group said. \"Too often we assume in our organizations we are 'all trained up' and 'that would never happen here.' But none of us should rest on yesterday's knowledge.\"",

The answer I believe is OpenAI,\" wrote Osborne, who ran the UK Treasury from 2010 to 2016, in a Tuesday X post confirming the move.\n\nOsborne takes the role of managing director and head of OpenAI for Countries, an initiative launched by the AI startup in May that will see OpenAI partner with nations to build data centers and expand its $500 billion Stargate project beyond the US.\n\nThe former finance minister, who was a member of parliament in the right-leaning Conservative party until 2017, is the latest ex-British political heavyweight to join a US tech firm.\n\nRishi Sunak, the former UK prime minister, took on roles at OpenAI rival Anthropic and Microsoft as an advisor in October, while ex-deputy prime minister Nick Clegg worked as a senior executive on Meta's global affairs team from 2018 until stepping down at the start of 2025.\n\nBritish political salaries are dwarfed by the earnings of even midlevel employees at US tech companies. British prime ministers earn an annual salary of around £174,000 ($232,000), while salaries for research engineers at Meta can be as high as $400,000.\n\nOsborne's arrival comes as OpenAI continues to bulk up its executive ranks. The AI startup hired former Instacart and Meta exec Fidji Simo as its new CEO of applications in May, and this week hired veteran Google executive Albert Lee to lead its mergers and acquisitions team.",

    "description": "In an era where international talent is at an all-time high, it might be hard to believe that it’s only been just over two decades since Utah’s Andrew Bogut became the first foreign-born winner of the John R. Wooden Award.",
    "fullText": "The John R. Wooden Award will celebrate it's 50th anniversary this season. Leading up to the award ceremony on April 10, 2026, The Sporting Tribune in partnership with the Wooden Award and the Los Angeles Athletic Club will highlight past winners of the Wooden Award and the Legends of Coaching Award.\n\nIn an era where international talent is at an all-time high, it might be hard to believe that it’s only been just over two decades since Utah’s Andrew Bogut became the first foreign-born winner of the John R. Wooden Award.\n\nBogut’s 2004-05 sophomore campaign with the Utes placed him into an exclusive club of college basketball history, as he led the program to the Sweet 16 in the years immediately after longtime head coach and program builder Rick Majerus left the program and received consensus national player of the year honors as a result.\n\nIn the Utes’ first season under Ray Giacolletti, Bogut averaged 20.5 points and 12.2 rebounds per game to lead the team to a 25-4 regular season record overall, with a 13-1 mark in Mountain West play. Bogut’s most impressive outing of the season was a 31-point, 13-rebound clinic in a 71-62 conference win over Wyoming on Valentine’s Day, where he made 11-of-16 attempts from the field.\n\nThe Utes would eventually fall to New Mexico in the 2005 Mountain West championship game, but still received a No. 6 seed in the NCAA Tournament as an at-large. Bogut continued his dominance in the first round of March Madness, pouring in 24 points on 9-of-13 shooting to lead Utah over a feisty No. 11 seed in UTEP before beating No. 3 seed Oklahoma in the Round of 32.\n\nIn the days after Bogut’s college career ended with a loss to Kentucky in the 2005 Sweet 16, he was awarded the Wooden Award with a decisive finish in the voting ahead of Duke’s JJ Redick and Illinois’ Dee Brown. Being from Australia, Bogut wasn’t too familiar with Coach Wooden’s legacy when he won the award but he still cherished the honor all the same.\n\n\"I'd heard the name before. College basketball isn't very big in Australia,\" Bogut told the Associated Press after winning the award in 2005. \"He's a legendary coach -- one of the best of all-time … It's very special just to have my name engraved on that trophy with the likes of Larry Bird, Michael Jordan and Tim Duncan.”\n\nBogut joined another very exclusive club in basketball history a few months later, as the Milwaukee Bucks selected him with the No. 1 overall pick in the 2005 NBA Draft. Bogut played 14 seasons in the NBA, winning a championship with the Golden State Warriors in 2015 in addition to earning third-team All-NBA honors with the Bucks in 2010.",

    "fullText": "The US government is launching an early career hiring and talent development program to bring more technology and artificial intelligence employees to the public sector, as part of the Trump administration’s efforts to modernize government systems and stay ahead in the global tech race.\n\nThe launch of the “US Tech Force” is designed to address a technical and early career talent gap across the government, according to Scott Kupor, the director of the Office of Personnel Management which is spearheading the program. The effort comes amid a broader war for AI talent, with tech companies offering sizable salaries and other perks to attract top engineers and researchers.\n\nOPM plans to hire an initial cohort of 1,000 early career software engineers, data scientists, project managers and AI experts to be placed across government agencies for the two-year program. It will also partner with tech companies to recommend early career managers to take a leave of absence from their private-sector roles to join the Tech Force.\n\n“If you’re thinking about, long term, a career in technology, there is no bigger and more complex set of problems than we face in the federal government,” Kupor said in a call with reporters ahead of the program’s announcement Monday.\n\nThe Trump administration has sought to implement AI to modernize and make more efficient systems across the federal government, including with the controversial Department of Government Efficiency. That effort, launched under Elon Musk earlier this year, is no longer operating as a “centralized” organization, officials said last month.\n\nPresident Donald Trump in July also signed an AI action plan, a set of initiatives and policy recommendations that centered on growing US AI infrastructure and scaling back regulation to promote US competitiveness.\n\nMembers of the new US Tech Force will work directly for individual agencies on projects determined by agency leadership. OPM will conduct an initial review and technical assessment of applicants and recommend approved candidates to agencies for final interviews and hiring decisions.\n\nApplications open Monday, and OPM hopes to have most members of the first cohort placed in roles within the first quarter of 2026.\n\nMembers of the Tech Force are expected to work on projects such as incorporating advanced AI into drones and other weapons at the Department of Defense, building out the Trump Accounts platform at the Internal Revenue Service, and using AI to improve intelligence at the State Department, among other initiatives, according to Kupor.\n\nThroughout the two-year program, OPM plans to bring in Silicon Valley CEOs and other executives for speaker events. It will also partner with around 25 tech companies to provide mentorship and career planning advice to members of the cohort. Microsoft, Adobe, Amazon, Meta and xAI are among the companies that have signed on as partners of the program.\n\nThe program will conclude with a job fair, where program members will have access to both public- and private-sector opportunities. Salaries for members of the Tech Force are expected to range from approximately $130,000 to $195,000.\n\n“There is an incredible race for talent in these areas … so part of what we want to do is be competitive on compensation,” Kupor said. He added that he wanted potential applicants to “understand that in doing this, they’re going to learn a bunch, they’re going to tackle really complex problems, and then they can ultimately go back to the private sector, if that’s what they want to do, and certainly will have the opportunity to maximize their financial opportunity as a result.”",

    "fullText": "Global macro analyst Luke Gromen, long known for his bullish stance on Bitcoin (BTC) as a hedge against fiat debasement, has adopted a more cautious outlook for the near term.\n\nSpeaking during a recent podcast appearance, Gromen warned that the asset could fall toward the $40,000 range.\n\nDuring the podcast, Gromen stressed that his broader investment thesis has not changed.\n\nHe continues to believe that long-term currency debasement will push investors toward scarce assets such as gold and Bitcoin.\n\nDollar debasement is the decline in the U.S. dollar’s purchasing power due to expanding money supply, inflation, or excessive government debt. This prompts investors to seek scarce assets like Bitcoin (BTC) or gold as protection.\n\nHowever, he now argues that gold and select equities may offer a cleaner expression of that trade than Bitcoin in the coming years.\n\n“Basically everything but gold and the dollar are likely to get waylaid,” Gromen said.\n\nGromen pointed to Bitcoin’s failure to make new highs relative to gold as a key warning sign. The absence of that breakout, he argued, suggests Bitcoin’s risk-reward profile has deteriorated.\n\nTreasury Secretary Bessent to propose major changes that could reshape crypto regulation\n\nAnalyst warns Fed’s $40B monthly Treasury buys could reprice crypto\n\nTeachers union warns new bill could put retirement savings at risk\n\nHe also highlighted a break below key long-term technical levels.\n\nAccording to Gromen, similar technical breakdowns in the recent past were followed by drawdowns, raising concerns that Bitcoin could face a deeper correction if history repeats.\n\n“When these technicals broke, each of the last three times, the median decline in Bitcoin was 65%–70% each time,” he said.\n\n\"The size it had grown in my portfolio, to me it just spoke to me a need to right-size it and substantially reduce positions. Because I think it's going a lot lower.\"\n\nAnother factor weighing on sentiment, according to Gromen, is the growing discussion around quantum computing risks. While most crypto traders consider it as a distant threat to Bitcoin’s cryptography, the topic has gained traction among investors.\n\nGromen suggested that large holders who have accumulated Bitcoin over the past decade may be increasingly inclined to hedge or trim exposure as the narrative gains visibility.\n\n“If I thought quantum was a risk I wanted to at least hedge somewhat, I would start to take some off the table,” he said, pointing to what he perceives as whale selling alongside weak price action.",

    "fullText": "The 1970s gave us muscle cars, oil crises, and some truly wild automotive experiments. While everyone's chasing Camaros and Corvettes at auctions, there's a whole world of fascinating machines from that decade that fly under the radar.\n\nThese overlooked cars offer character, quirky engineering, and surprisingly solid performance without the six-figure price tags. Some were ahead of their time, others were wonderfully weird, and a few were just plain misunderstood.\n\nAlright, time to check out these gems from the '70s that deserve more love from collectors.\n\nThe Gremlin gets mocked for its chopped-off rear end, but this little oddball was actually pretty clever. AMC created it by literally cutting down a Hornet to compete in the subcompact market, and it worked.\n\nWith optional V8 power, the Gremlin could surprise unsuspecting muscle cars at stoplights, and its quirky styling has aged into legitimate charm. You could get one with a 304 cubic inch V8 that made around 150 horsepower, which was respectable for the era.\n\nWhile collectors chase AMX models, clean Gremlins remain affordable and are starting to earn respect as honest, unpretentious American compacts.\n\nThe wedge-shaped TR7 was supposed to be Triumph's answer to modern sports car design, and while it had production issues, the driving experience was genuinely fun. Its \"wedge\" design was polarizing, earning the tagline \"The Shape of Things to Come,\" though reliability concerns overshadowed its decent handling.\n\nThe four-cylinder engine produced about 92 horsepower in North American spec, which sounds modest but kept the car nimble and engaging. Later TR8 models got a V8, but even the standard TR7 offers an accessible entry into British sports car ownership.\n\nThese days, you can find them for a fraction of what you'd pay for an MGB or Spitfire.\n\nBefore the 240Z became a collector darling, Datsun was building sensible sedans that happened to be incredibly well-engineered. The 710 was a reliable, practical sedan that competed with Toyota Corollas but somehow never achieved the same nostalgic status.\n\nIts 2.0-liter engine made around 94–97 horsepower (SAE net), depending on emissions spec and could reliably cruise all day without complaint. The wagon versions are particularly appealing today, offering classic lines and surprising cargo space.\n\nWhile collectors obsess over Z-cars, the humble 710 represents Datsun's commitment to quality without demanding classic car prices.\n\nSold through Mercury dealers, the Capri II was a captive import from Ford of Europe rather than a traditional American pony car. Built in Germany, it brought European hatchback styling and a more refined driving feel to the U.S. market at a time when domestic performance cars were shrinking.\n\nPower came from sensible options like the 2.3-liter four-cylinder or an optional 2.8-liter V6, prioritizing balance and fuel economy over straight-line speed.\n\nWhile it never tried to compete directly with muscle cars, the Capri II offered tidy handling, distinctive fastback styling, and a level of character that set it apart from its American contemporaries. Overshadowed by Mustangs and later fox-body Capris, the Capri II remains an overlooked slice of 1970s transatlantic automotive history.\n\nThis mid-engine, targa-topped Italian was designed by Bertone and offered sports car thrills in an affordable package. With just about 75 horsepower from its 1.5-liter engine, the X1/9 wasn't about straight-line speed but rather handling and driver engagement.\n\nThe mid-engine layout gave it phenomenal balance, making it a blast on twisty roads. Its removable roof panel predated the Miata's popularity by decades and offered open-air driving without sacrificing structural rigidity.\n\nWhile Fiat's rust reputation scared some buyers away, well-maintained examples prove that proper Italian sports cars don't need big price tags.\n\nThe Volaré replaced the beloved Valiant and initially suffered quality issues, but the platform itself was quite capable. Once Chrysler sorted out the early problems, these became solid, dependable cars with comfortable rides.\n\nYou could option them with everything from slant-six engines to 360 cubic inch V8s making around 160–170 horsepower (SAE net), depending on year/trim. The Road Runner package added some muscle car DNA to a practical body, creating an interesting sleeper.\n\nEarlier Mopars often get all the love, but clean examples represent affordable entry into Chrysler performance heritage.\n\nBefore Subaru became synonymous with crossovers, they built a compact pickup truck with rear-facing jump seats in the bed. The BRAT (Bi-drive Recreational All-terrain Transporter) cleverly avoided the chicken tax by including those seats, classifying it as a passenger vehicle.\n\nIts four-wheel drive system was ahead of its time for a small truck, and the about 67 horsepower from its flat-four engine was adequate for the lightweight body. The quirky design and practical utility made it perfect for outdoor enthusiasts.\n\nToday, rust-free BRATs are increasingly hard to find, but they remain much more affordable than vintage Toyota trucks.\n\nThe Alfetta brought Italian performance engineering to the sedan market with its unique transaxle layout for perfect weight distribution. Named after Alfa's successful racing cars, it featured a rear-mounted transmission that helped achieve 50/50 balance.\n\nThe four-cylinder engine produced around 109-130 PS but delivered smooth power and that distinctive Alfa character. Its handling was exceptional for a sedan, rewarding drivers who appreciated precise steering and responsive chassis dynamics.\n\nWhile collectors chase Spiders and GTVs, the Alfetta sedan offers genuine Alfa driving pleasure without the premium prices.\n\nThe Vega had serious quality issues at launch, but the GT version with its sport suspension and styling upgrades was actually entertaining to drive. Its aluminum-block four-cylinder was innovative if flawed, producing around 85 horsepower (SAE net) in typical mid-’70s GT spec (varies by year/engine option).\n\nThe lightweight body and decent handling made it competitive in autocross and club racing. Many enthusiasts have discovered that dropping in a small-block V8 turns the Vega into a genuine pocket rocket.\n\nSure, the reputation keeps values low, but that means more opportunity for builders and drivers who want an affordable project.\n\nFrench engineering excellence doesn't get enough credit in American collector circles, and the 504 proves that point beautifully. This sedan won European Car of the Year and featured independent suspension, comfortable seating, and surprisingly robust construction.\n\nThe fuel-injected four-cylinder made around 96 horsepower but delivered smooth, refined power delivery. Its ride quality was exceptional, combining European handling with comfortable long-distance cruising.\n\nWhile Citroëns get the quirky attention, the 504 represents practical French design that actually worked reliably in American conditions.\n\nBefore the RX-7 became a rotary icon, Mazda built the smaller RX-3 with the same spinning triangle magic. U.S.-market RX-3s used the larger 12A rotary, with published outputs closer to about 90 horsepower in North American spec; the engine’s willingness to rev was a big part of the appeal.\n\nRacing versions dominated their classes in IMSA competition, proving the chassis was more than just economical transportation. The coupe and wagon versions offer distinctive styling that stands out from typical Japanese offerings.\n\nCollectors focus on RX-7s and leave these earlier rotaries as affordable alternatives with genuine motorsport heritage.\n\nVolvo built a reputation on safety and practicality, but the 242 GT showed they understood driving dynamics too. This special edition featured unique aerodynamic bodywork, sport suspension, and distinctive alloy wheels.\n\nThe fuel-injected four-cylinder produced around produced about 123 hp in fuel-injected B21E form (outputs varied by market and rating standard) and delivered surprisingly spirited performance. Its handling was sharp for a Volvo, rewarding drivers who pushed it through corners.\n\nWhile 240-series cars are common, finding a genuine GT with its special equipment is increasingly difficult, yet they remain affordable compared to BMW 2002s.\n\nThese twelve overlooked machines from the 1970s prove that collector appeal isn't always about what's most expensive or most famous. Each offers something special, whether it's innovative engineering, quirky charm, or genuine driving pleasure that got overshadowed by flashier contemporaries. The best part about exploring these forgotten gems is that you can actually afford to buy one, drive it, and enjoy it without worrying about depreciation or astronomical restoration costs. As the collector car market continues evolving, smart enthusiasts are discovering that sometimes the most rewarding classics are the ones everyone else walked past.",

    "fullText": "Our Delta One tickets got us access to the expansive Delta Sky Club at LAX.\n\nAlong with two large buffet areas and a bar, the space had many comfortable seating zones and private bathrooms with showers.\n\nIt was fun having so many complimentary food options — including vegan ones — but we tried not to overdo it as we had already pre-selected meals for our flight.\n\nWhen it was time to board the plane, we walked over to our gate and were among the first passengers welcomed.\n\nAs we settled into our seats, the friendly flight attendants offered us drinks and snacks right away.\n\nSince the plane had a staggered layout and my husband and I both wanted window seats, my \"suite\" was one row behind his.\n\nThat meant we couldn't hold hands, as we usually do, during takeoff. But rather than feeling nervous, I felt safely cocooned in my personal space.\n\nThe suite had a door to slide shut for privacy and side buttons for adjusting the seat's angle and lighting.\n\nThe blanket and pillow were cozy, and the travel kit had some useful amenities, like slippers, lip balm, hand cream, and an eye mask.\n\nI was hoping for a pair of pajamas, but those weren't offered on our 8 p.m. flight.\n\nOnce we leveled off, I was able to fully recline in the Delta One lie-flat seats. It was such a relief.\n\nMore than anything, the ability to lie down flat made the biggest difference in how much I enjoyed the long flight.\n\nI was even able to fall asleep off and on — something I'm never able to do on a plane\n\nUnlike me, my husband doesn't mind flying — he just doesn't like the lack of space on most plane seats. At over 6 feet tall with a burly build and size-14 shoes, he's always hoping for more legroom.\n\nFortunately, the Delta One suite delivered with its roomy seat and foot cubby.\n\nMy husband was so comfortable that he didn't even bother taking off his shoes or fully reclining during the entire flight.\n\nOur overnight flight included a three-course dinner and next-day breakfast, plus plenty of snacks and drinks.\n\nWe had ordered vegan options and were pleasantly surprised at how tasty the food was, from grain bowls to salads to plates with hummus and veggies.\n\nThe retractable table I ate on felt roomy and sturdy, and eating with real silverware, porcelain dishes, and cloth napkins elevated the experience.\n\nWatching TV on the nicely sized screen in front of me helped me forget I was in a flying metal tube thousands of feet above the ground.\n\nThough Delta offered plenty of new movies and shows for me to stream, I ended up turning to old favorites like \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" and listening to soothing music.\n\nMeanwhile, my husband was rocking out to a famous Bruce Springsteen concert from 1979.\n\nAll in all, our pricey flight was so enjoyable that I almost wished it lasted longer.\n\nWhen we landed at Heathrow Airport the following afternoon, we didn't even have jet lag. We just felt ready to take on the day.\n\nSplurging isn't always possible, but we're keeping our options open for future flights. As they say, it's not about the destination, it's about the journey.",

    "title": "Meet the world's 5th-richest person: Oracle founder Larry Ellison's net worth hit massive highs and lows in 2025",
    "description": "Meet Larry Ellison, the world's fifth-richest man. He cofounded Oracle in 1977 and is still one of Silicon Valley's top dogs.",
    "fullText": "Larry Ellison is the founder and chief technology officer of the software giant Oracle.\n\nNow, he's also the world's fifth-wealthiest man, with a net worth of $238 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nEllison's 2025 was marked by big financial gains and losses. Ellison briefly claimed the title of the world's richest person when his net worth soared to $393 billion that September. Oracle shares surged after the company reported quarterly results and delivered a blockbuster outlook for its AI-powered cloud business. Later that month, his wealth had nearly doubled during the year.\n\nHowever, his fortune took a $25 billion hit toward the end of 2025 after Oracle's shares fell by more than 11% based on weaker-than-expected earnings results. December 12 marked one of the largest single-day drops in net worth this year. Tesla chief Elon Musk then resumed his place as the world's wealthiest man.\n\nOracle, like other tech giants, is betting big on artificial intelligence, and Ellison is leading the charge at the company. His latest focus is on building data centers for companies such as OpenAI.\n\nEllison started Oracle in 1977. Decades later, despite living in Hawaii, he's still one of the top dogs in Silicon Valley.\n\nHere's a look at Ellison's life and career so far.\n\nEllison was born in the Bronx on August 17, 1944, to a single mother, Florence Spellman. Raised in Chicago's South Side, he attended the University of Illinois but dropped out after his adoptive mother died. He later attended the University of Chicago for a semester, but also dropped out.\n\nIn 1966, at the age of 22, he moved to Berkeley, California, near the emerging tech hub of Silicon Valley. He worked a series of jobs, including at Wells Fargo and mainframe maker Amdahl, where he picked up programming skills.\n\nOracle was founded in 1977 with $2,000, inspired by IBM scientist Edgar F. Codd's revolutionary idea of relational databases. Its first product was dubbed Version 2. After briefly rebranding as Relational Software Inc., the company became Oracle Systems in 1982 and went public in 1986 with $55 million in revenue.\n\nGrowth was rapid, but in 1990, Oracle nearly went bankrupt after revenue miscalculations led to losses and layoffs. By 1992, the launch of Oracle7 put the company back on track. Throughout the '90s, Oracle sparred with rivals like Informix and benefited from the dot-com boom, supplying databases to countless startups.\n\nFlush with cash, Oracle went on an acquisition spree, buying PeopleSoft for $10.3 billion in 2005 and Sun Microsystems in 2010, gaining control of key technologies like MySQL. That same year, Ellison recruited Mark Hurd alongside Safra Catz, who later became co-CEOs.\n\nEllison stepped down as CEO in 2014, assuming the roles of chairman and chief technology officer.\n\nEllison, Oracle's largest shareholder, has used his fortune to fuel a life of high-profile investments, philanthropy, and headline-making purchases.\n\nHe races yachts, sails, and partially financed the BMW Oracle USA team that won the 2010 America's Cup.\n\nHe has also built a collection of Richard Mille watches worth hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars each. In 2009, he purchased the Indian Wells tennis tournament for $100 million.\n\nIn 2012, he bought 98% of the Hawaiian island of Lanai, where he later moved full-time, developing real estate and a wellness retreat, and backing a farming startup. His real estate portfolio also includes mansions in Malibu, Palm Beach, and Rhode Island.\n\nHe has been an active investor for a long time. An early backer of Salesforce, he also invested in Leapfrog and the ill-fated Theranos.\n\nOne of his most lucrative bets was NetSuite: A $125 million stake in 1998 turned into a $3.5 billion windfall when Oracle acquired the company in 2016.\n\nEllison also served on Apple's board in the late 1990s and joined Tesla's board in 2018 before stepping down in 2022.\n\nEllison's daughter, Megan, is an Oscar-nominated film producer and the founder of Annapurna Pictures. The company has produced films like \"Zero Dark Thirty\" and \"American Hustle.\"\n\nEllison's son, David, is also in the film business. His company, Skydance Media, has produced movies like \"Terminator: Dark Fate\" and films in the \"Mission: Impossible\" franchise.\n\nAfter months of discussions in 2024, Skydance Media and Paramount agreed to a deal, which created Paramount Skydance. David is the CEO. Ellison and David, who own a controlling stake in Paramount and were outbid by Netflix for Warner Bros. Discovery, launched a hostile $30-per-share offer for all of WBD in December 2025.\n\nParamount Skydance oversees Paramount Pictures, the streaming services Paramount+ and Pluto TV, as well as CBS and cable networks, including Comedy Central and MTV.\n\nEllison signed the Giving Pledge in 2010, vowing to give away 95% of his fortune.\n\nHe has donated millions, including $200 million to a USC cancer center in 2016, which was eventually renamed the Ellison Institute of Technology. The EIT announced an Oxford campus in 2023.\n\nHe's also been visible during Donald Trump's second term as president.\n\nEllison appeared alongside Sam Altman of OpenAI and Masayoshi Son of SoftBank at Trump's press conference the day after the president's inauguration in January 2024 to announce Project Stargate, a joint venture that would see up to $500 billion investment in AI infrastructure in the US.\n\n\"He's sort of CEO of everything. He's an amazing man,\" Trump said as he introduced Ellison, who is seen as his longtime ally.",

    "fullText": "PDC World Darts Championship: Glen Durrant - Price can rival the two Lukes originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nYou might be forgiven for thinking all the conversation in the run up the PDC World Championship has been about the two Lukes: Littler and Humphries and to a large extent you would be correct. There are other names that some fancy to test the most recent two World Champions.\n\nWhen Darts World talked to Glen Durrant, three-time Lakeside (WDF) champion and winner of the PDC's Premier League, he agreed that at least one other player should be in the mix:\n\nLet's talk about Gerwyn Price - can he keep up with the two Lukes and compete?\n\nHe can absolutely still cut it at the top of the sport. His A game is as good as any player in the world right now. He’s super fit, so fatigue isn’t coming into it. I’d like to see him be 3-0 down in a match and come back to win it 4-3.\n\nIt’s almost like he needs that great match early doors to get his belief back. He had that at the World Matchplay where he seemed to be 5-0 down after the first break, but it’s part of his game now, to know he can come back from the jaws of defeat. The only thing I think Gerwyn Price needs is to show that resilience. He needs to show that grit. But right now, he can be as good as anybody when he is at the top of his game.\n\nTHE PDC WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP IN FACTS AND FIGURES: Arm yourself on dartsdatabase.co.uk\n\nIs his 11 world ranking representative of how good he is or do you think he should be higher than that?\n\nHe’s at No. 3 in the world in my eyes. I think the two Lukes are just a little bit ahead of him. There are some great players around at the moment. Stephen Bunting looks like he’s just searching for that little bit extra at the moment. James Wade has had an unbelievable season so far. If I had to give you my top 10 right now, Price would definitely be at three.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS! Gerwyn Price wins PDC World Darts Championship\n\nPrice v Littler. If it were to happen, if those guys were to meet in the quarterfinals, would that be one of the best quarterfinals of all time?\n\nI’ve done the draw, done the little league table, the fantasy of how it plays out. I’ve got it down that they will meet in the quarter-finals, that seems like a match-up we can anticipate.\n\nThere have been some epic games at Alexandra Palace. Sometimes as a commentator you get to watch some mouthwatering ties, and I think that this is a tie that would excite the players, but the crowd would love it too. It’s what we want.\n\nI think it’ll happen, I think they are the two standout players in that section, and I think it’s going to be an absolute belter.\n\nGLEN DURRANT WINS PREMIER LEAGUE: Watch Duzza's 2020 Moment of triumph\n\nAs a former player turned pundit Glen also look for value in the betting market and was talking via 10Bet . Does he see one of those fairytale runs that Ally Pally is famous for happening this year:\n\nBack to the PDC World Championships. Who could rattle a few cages?\n\n“I don't really think it's been the year of the underdog with the domination of the two Lukes. I've struggled to get value for people. You know, I'll give you a couple of names here:\n\n“ I think Martin Schindler can go on and run this year. I think Jermaine Wattamina is in the form of his life. I think there's a couple of young players too who could do well like Van Veen and Manby. I'm a big fan of the North American scene. Adam Savada, etc... . But I don't see them going deep because the elite players just look so good.\n\n“Also, I don't see, for example, a Scott Williams reaching the semi-final like a couple of years ago. I think the cream will rise to the top.\n\n\" So looking up and down the draw, I mean, as we said, you think the top eight could potentially be your quarter-final, and there's every reason why we can say that.\n\n“ Everyone's writing off Rob Cross… at 175 to 1. Rob Cross is not a 175 to 1 shot. I hope he finds his form there.\n\n“It's intriguing. It's exciting. It's going to be the place to be. It's what everyone's going to be watching. And if seeds go, then great. But I'd be surprised if we don't see one of those real top elite players picking up that million quid.”\n\nGet \n\nDarts World subscriptions options include Print, Digital and All Access packages, as well as exclusive products and competitions",

    "description": "WORLD CUP 2026: Comment: Fifa’s extortionate prices have led to accusations of ‘betrayal’ and Miguel Delaney argues that The FA must flex its power now to save fans and potentially enhance England’s chances on the pitch",
    "fullText": "The Fifa leadership travel to Doha on Monday, for a series of meetings around “The Best” awards, where certain sources are anticipating at least some tension. And not over who wins.\n\nA number of national associations remain aggravated by the astronomical World Cup 2026 ticket prices, and want to directly raise it. The Football Association says it will relay fan concerns to Fifa, but the Football Supporters’ Association expects more. They expect the FA to actually push on this, and display proper support.\n\nIf it doesn’t, there will be uproar and potential escalation of the latest controversy surrounding Fifa and the World Cup.\n\nThe story should already be bringing much more scrutiny on the conduct of the FA – and other major federations – in football’s power structure.\n\nSources within such federations generally insist that they must maintain a diplomatic stance when dealing with the top brass of Fifa and Uefa, due to the risk of political ostracisation, given that both federations are top-down executive president models with little scope for dissent.\n\nSo, they generally say very little that is challenging, as they attempt to keep some influence.\n\nExcept, what is the point of any of that if you say nothing and have absolutely no influence when it matters most?\n\nThe FA’s first obligation, after all, is to the football public of England. To its constituents.\n\nYou may as well be politically ostracised if you can’t serve them in something like this.\n\nAnd what is going to happen anyway? It’s not like Fifa or Uefa are going to cut off Forward or HatTrick funding.\n\nBoth federations absolutely love Wembley, knowing how much more lucrative it is than any other European stadium. That means little to no risk of losing major fixtures.\n\nFA lobbyists may point to the bid for the Fifa Women’s World Cup 2035, but there’s no competition there.\n\nAnd, in any case, do they really have a mandate to secure a tournament at any cost – like that to their fans?\n\nThe refusal to publicly speak on this would be utterly spineless.\n\nSuch an approach is all the more surprising right now, given that there is constant tension between football’s various stakeholders – from the Premier League to European Football Clubs (the new name for the European Club Association) – and you need sharp elbows to secure your space in the calendar. You need a sense of fight.\n\nMany of those same stakeholders often declare themselves shocked at the meekness of the major federations, from the FA to the associations of France, Germany and Spain. There’s a feeling that they absolutely waste their potential power, and that they should be moral guardians of the game.\n\nInstead, various sources describe them as “the most complicit in the preservation of football’s system” due to the refusal to flex their greater muscle and, worse, “patsies”.\n\nFifa and Uefa have allowed the game to be taken over by greater power, with virtually no challenge. And this has far greater future risks.\n\nThe great frustration with this ticket crisis – even though you could have said this about any of Fifa’s controversies over the last few weeks – is that a potential outlet for dissent is so obvious and powerful.\n\nIf the 10-15 wealthiest federations coordinated action, or even put out a joint statement, it would “rattle” Fifa president Gianni Infantino on this, according to insiders. It would be dissent he is not used to.\n\nSo simple, so potentially effective in this controversy.\n\nIf Fifa still doesn’t budge on prices, and a position in this patronage system is apparently so valuable to the federations, there is another option.\n\nThe national associations can use the ample money they receive from Fifa and Uefa to subsidise the tickets of regular match-going fans.\n\nMany of the latter are already talking of having to make very hard decisions on whether to attend next summer’s tournament. It could be reasonably argued that full support is all the more valuable, given that this looks like England’s best chance of winning a World Cup in decades.\n\nBut, really, there is something deeper here.\n\nThere is a moral and political argument.\n\nThe member associations, most of all the FA, should do much more for their constituents. As was reported on these pages on Saturday, FA chair Debbie Hewitt is ideally placed as Fifa chair.\n\n“I’m not known for being a silent observer,” she said on taking that role.\n\nThere’s never been a more important moment to prove that.",

    "description": "US copper stockpiling ahead of potential tariffs is draining metal from the global market and tightening supplies worldwide.",
    "fullText": "Copper prices have exploded to record highs again, not because the world is running out of the metal, but in part because the United States is scooping up so much of it that everyone else is scrambling for what's left.\n\nBenchmark three-month copper hit an all-time high of $11,952 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange on Friday. It's now trading around $11,655 per ton, up roughly 33% so far this year.\n\nThe US has been aggressively stockpiling metal ahead of potential tariffs, pulling huge volumes out of the tradable global system and tightening supplies everywhere else.\n\n\"US inventory is effectively 'trapped',\" analysts at Goldman Sachs wrote in a report on Tuesday.\n\nHowever, the global copper market is expected to post a 300,000-ton surplus next year.\n\nThe latest copper price surge caps a volatile year for the red metal used in construction, electrical grids, and electronics.\n\nEarly this year, traders rushed copper into the US in anticipation of President Donald Trump's steep import tariffs.\n\nBut months later, the administration unexpectedly excluded refined copper from those duties, leaving importers sitting on piles of metal.\n\nEven so, the market isn't convinced the reprieve will last.\n\nGoldman's analysts wrote that they now expect the White House to announce a refined copper tariff in the first half of 2026 for implementation in 2027. Such a delay would likely encourage further US stockpiling, as expectations of future tariffs keep domestic buyers pulling copper out of the global market.\n\nMeanwhile, the rest of the world faces a growing supply squeeze, with Goldman expecting a 450,000-ton deficit next year.\n\nFurthermore, the world's copper supply has been rattled by real disruptions.\n\nProduction setbacks at big miners in Indonesia, Congo, and Chile have squeezed output in recent months.\n\nThat dynamic has helped drive high copper premiums across the rest of the world.\n\n\"Producers plan to impose record premiums on European and Asian customers next year, effectively compensating for profits they could earn selling to the US,\" wrote Ewa Manthey, a commodities strategist at ING, last week.\n\nAdding to the upside pressure, speculation has flooded the market as traders are piling into positions tied to AI infrastructure and energy transition themes, treating the metal almost like a tech-linked asset.\n\nInvestors are piling into bets linked to data-center construction — a speculative trend Goldman's analysts warn has left prices open to a sharp reversal.\n\nThat makes copper vulnerable to any wobble in AI stocks, particularly if the hype around data center buildouts fades.\n\n\"The copper price rally in December is becoming highly speculative, which makes it vulnerable to a rapid reversal,\" wrote Goldman's analysts.\n\nGoldman's copper price forecast for 2026 is $11,400 per ton — lower than current levels.",

One proposal is to use some of the tens of billions of dollars in frozen Russian assets held in Europe.\n\n“The aggressor must pay,” Zelenskyy told the Dutch parliament earlier Tuesday.\n\nOn Monday, he attended peace talks in Berlin with U.S. President Donald Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff, Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz. Zelenskyy voiced readiness to drop his country’s bid to join NATO in exchange for Western security guarantees, but rejected the U.S. push for ceding territory to Russia.\n\n“These security guarantees are an opportunity to prevent another wave of Russian aggression,” he told journalists. “And this is already a compromise on our part.”\n\nThirty-five countries backed the International Claims Commission, but they now must ratify the treaty, a process which usually requires legislature approval.

    "fullText": "South Korea’s women added to the trophy cabinet twice in 2025, but underwhelming results in several international friendlies leave Shin Sangwoo and his squad with a point to prove at next year’s AFC Women’s Asian Cup.\n\nThe year started on a high note for the South Korean women’s national team with victory in February’s Pink Ladies Cup. Korea won all three of their matches and did so with a better goal difference than Russia to claim the title. Sure, it wasn’t the most glorious win, given the calibre of the teams involved and the status (or lack thereof) of the tournament itself, but it was a win nonetheless, and the squad returned from the UAE with a nice shiny platter to put in the KFA trophy cabinet.\n\nIn May, Shin Sangwoo’s warriors were off to Australia for a pair of friendlies against the hosts of next year’s AFC Women’s Asian Cup. Buoyed by large and enthusiastic home crowds, the Matildas proved tough opponents. The results — a 1-0 loss and a 2-0 loss — weren’t terrible, but did lay bare a weakness in Korea’s goalscoring department, the team’s inability to get across the line (or at least, to do so in the right goal) damaging their confidence.\n\nThere were two more friendlies in late spring, this time on home soil as Korea played host to Colombia. The first match in Incheon ended as a 1-0 loss; Korea did well to hold their own fast and physical opponents. Despite the frustrating lack of goals, the home fans were treated to a moment of elation as Kim Minjeong made a cracking save to deny Usme’s penalty. There was further joy a few days later in Yongin as Jung Minyoung finally put an end to the goal drought just two minutes into her international debut. An unfortunate own goal from Kim Jinhui brought the sides level before the final whistle, but on some level, the friendlies were a success. Manager Shin experimented with formations, and everyone in the squad got minutes on the pitch, with the exception of third goalkeeper Woo Seobin.\n\nIn July, South Korea hosted the EAFF E-1 Football Championship (East Asian Cup), with both men’s and women’s competitions happening in venues around Gyeonggi-do in what must have been a busy week for those guys who shake the giant Taegukgi. The tournament saw Korea’s women take on some of their toughest competitors in the region. Against China, the final score was 2-2; Ji Soyun’s dramatic injury-time equaliser earned her a nomination for the KFA’s goal of the year. Another late equaliser, this time from Jeong Dabin, made it 1-1 against fierce rivals Japan. As Japan and China faced each other on the final matchday, a win for either team would secure them the title, but yet another stalemate in that match opened the door for Korea to swoop in and claim the victory, which they did with an assured 2-0 victory over Chinese Taipei (Taiwan).\n\nThus, Korea’s women lifted the East Asian Cup for the first time in 20 years, proving in the process that they can still compete with the regional football powerhouses despite a relative lack of investment and development in the women’s game. More accuracy in front of goal could have helped deliver a more decisive victory, but a trophy is a trophy, not to mention a huge confidence booster.\n\nThere were no A matches in the October international window due to the National Sports Festival, the KFA electing to avoid clashes so that the squads of the eight WK League clubs wouldn’t be left depleted. The national team still made headlines in the autumn as it emerged that several players had demanded equal treatment with the men’s team, allegedly threatening to boycott A matches unless their conditions, including business class flights for international fixtures, were met. The news divided more reasonable fans and provided ammunition for keyboard warriors who seem to think that national pride would be better served by defunding and disbanding the women’s team than supporting the Taeguk Warriors in women’s competitions.\n\nIt remains unclear in which section of the plane the squad travelled for their latest excursion, a trip to Europe for friendlies against Wales and the Netherlands. Shin should have fancied his team’s chances in Malaga as they lined up against a Welsh team on an 11-match winless run (spoiler alert: now 12), but it was his side that conceded first; Kim Minji scored her international debut in the second half to bring things level. After appearing the weaker side for much of the match, Korea seemed to gain some momentum after the goal, but it was too late.\n\nThe Netherlands were always going to be difficult opponents for Korea. In fact, Korea could learn a thing or two from the Dutch model of rapidly developing the domestic women’s football environment with the explicit core aim of improving the national team. WSL all-time top goalscorer Vivianne Miedema completed a hat-trick within 35 minutes; her teammates made it 5-0 by half time. The second half was goalless, but the damage was already done. The scoreline in this match, and England’s 8-0 thumping of China in front of 74,611 fans at Wembley a few days earlier, serve as a stark reminder that the top teams in Asia still have catching up to do when it comes to the women’s game.\n\nConceding five goals in 45 minutes and scraping a draw against a lower-ranking team on bad form: these are not results that inspire confidence, but the proof of the pudding is in the eating, and this pudding — next year's Asian Cup — is still in the oven, raw in the middle.\n\nUnder Shin Sangwoo the women's national team is making progress. He has used this year's A matches to play around with the squad, trying out several formations and starting lineups. Goalkeeper Kim Minjeong has solidified her place in the first eleven. A much-discussed \"new generation\" of players has been welcomed into the fold, with 12 players receiving their first senior call-up and 17 making their international debut this year. More of Korea's squad than ever before are playing regularly for fully professional clubs in the top leagues of Europe and North America.\n\n(Photo by Darrian Traynor/Getty Images)\n\nLooking ahead to the Asian Cup, there is still work to do (isn't there always?). South Korea's women need to be more effective in front of goal. Goals, especially early goals, will boost the squad's confidence as they progress through the tournament and face tougher opposition. Players need to avoid becoming downcast when chasing a result, and trust themselves and their footballing ability rather than resorting to messy tackles and avoidable fouls.\n\nMental toughness will be key in the group stage as Korea are set to face hosts Australia. The Matildas have beaten them twice in 2025, and the home crowd will only be more animated for this major tournament. They are also joined in Group A by Iran and the Philippines. The former didn't make it past the group stage in their Asian Cup debut in 2022, while the latter became the underdog story of that tournament, securing their first-ever qualification for the FIFA Women's World Cup by reaching the semi-finals; they were beaten to the final by South Korea.\n\nNext year's Asian Cup has been a clear driving force behind the women's national team activities in 2025. It's a natural focal point when reflecting on this year, and South Korea's performance at the tournament may well alter the 2025 narrative when looking back in a few months' time. With drastic changes coming to the WK League in 2026 and the national team undergoing a generational shift, women's football in Korea is at a crossroads — let's hope this year's trophies are a sign of things to come.",

Football's world governing body then embarked on its own set of awards for the top players and coaches in the sport.\n\nThe Ballon d'Or has been in circulation since 1956, and despite FIFA's global standing as a football entity, The Best awards still have some catching up to do to be considered of the same prestige as the Ballon d'Or.\n\nBallon d'Or winner Ousmane Dembele is in contention to do the double on the 11-man shortlist. The France winger is one of four PSG nominees following the French giants' treble season, while Lamine Yamal is among a Barcelona trio.\n\nHarry Kane (Bayern Munich / England)\n\nKylian Mbappe (Real Madrid / France)\n\nCole Palmer (Chelsea / England)\n\nMohamed Salah (Liverpool / Egypt)\n\nLamine Yamal (Barcelona / Spain)\n\nSpain star Aitana Bonmati claimed her third successive Ballon d'Or Feminin in 2025 and is looking to make it a double-treble by retaining the FIFA prize.\n\nSandy Baltimore (Chelsea / France)\n\nNathalie Bjorn (Chelsea / Sweden)\n\nAitana Bonmati (Barcelona / Spain)\n\nLucy Bronze (Chelsea / England)\n\nMariona Caldentey (Arsenal / Spain)\n\nTemwa Chawinga (Kansas City Current / Malawi)\n\nKadidatou Diani (Lyon / France)\n\nMelchie Dumornay (Lyon / Haiti)\n\nPatri Guijarro (Barcelona / Spain)\n\nLauren James (Chelsea / England)\n\nChloe Kelly (Arsenal / England)\n\nClaudia Pina (Barcelona / Spain)\n\nAlexia Putellas (Barcelona / Spain)\n\nAlessi Russo (Arsenal / England)\n\nLeah Williamson (Arsenal / England)\n\nArne Slot has had a tough time at Liverpool so far this term, but the Dutchman's Premier League title win in his maiden season at Anfield has got him in the mix for the men's coach award.\n\nSarina Wiegman, winner in 2022 and 2023, is back in the mix after leading England to a successful defence of their Euros title.\n\nTwo-time winner Emiliano Martinez has the chance to retain his prize.
