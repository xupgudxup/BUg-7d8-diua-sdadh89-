    "fullText": "DUNEDIN, Fla. (AP) — Vladimir Guerrero Jr. was the last person to leave the Toronto dugout after the Game 7 loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers in the World Series last fall because the star slugger wanted that to be the moment when he moved on.\n\nThe first full workout for the Blue Jays at spring training Monday brought some clarity to that plan.\n\n“When I left, I felt like I had faced reality, and the only thing I had left to say to myself was just thank God for the year I had, for the year the team had had,” Guerrero said through an interpreter. “Right then, I just turned the page.”\n\nThe Blue Jays lost the decisive game 5-4 in 11 innings, missing on a second consecutive chance to clinch the franchise's third championship at home. For manager John Schneider, this spring training is no different from a year ago.\n\n“The main message is we’re not defending anything,” Schneider said. “We’re not defending the AL East. We’re not defending the American League. We’re attacking 2026 like we did in 2025 or any year, really. You’re trying to win the division, you’re trying to win the World Series. That’s it.”\n\nGuerrero jolted the franchise at the start of the spring last year, when he said there was no deal on a new contract and that his own deadline for getting one done had passed, raising the specter of free agency in 2026.\n\nInstead, the sides settled on a $500 million, 14-year contract early last season, and the son of Hall of Famer Vladimir Guerrero went on to hit .292 with 23 home runs and 84 RBIs.\n\nIn the postseason, Guerrero had a 1.289 OPS while hitting .397 with eight homers in 18 games and was MVP of the American League Championship Series. He didn't homer in any of his first three trips to the playoffs, and the Blue Jays lost all six of those games.\n\n“Going back to the postseason last year, I think it’s really cool for everyone to be on that heightened stage and to see how they responded,” Schneider said. “I think that kind of bleeds into this year, but (Guerrero) has been a little bit more vocal than I’ve ever seen him, a little bit more loose than I’ve ever seen him and understands that he’s one of the best players in the game.”\n\nThe 26-year-old Guerrero, a five-time All-Star, is now the longest-tenured Blue Jays player.\n\n“I don’t see myself as a leader,” Guerrero said. “I always put myself as a good teammate, and when you are a good teammate, then you become a good leader. I’m a good teammate.”\n\nHis role as the face of the franchise was cemented when Bo Bichette left the team, signing a $126 million, three-year with the New York Mets and moving from shortstop to third base.\n\n“It’s difficult not having him around,” said Guerrero, who played with Bichette through the minor leagues. “I mean, we played 10 years together. But at the same time, I understand it’s business, and he has to take care of his family as well.”\n\nThe Blue Jays signed Japanese infielder Kazuma Okamoto to fill the void left by Bichette while adding pitchers Dylan Cease and Cody Ponce.\n\n“I think we’re very capable,” Guerrero said. “I think it’s going to be more fun, and I’m actually more happy than last year.”\n\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB",

    "description": "The Lionesses return to competitive action next month as their campaign to qualify for the 2027 Women's World Cup begins. So what changes could we see?",
    "fullText": "The Lionesses return to competitive action next month as their campaign to qualify for the 2027 Women's World Cup in Brazil begins.\n\nSarina Wiegman's side travel to Turkey to face Ukraine on Tuesday, 3 March (17:00 GMT) before hosting Iceland at the City Ground on Saturday, 7 March (12:30).\n\nThere are just eight international camps before England hope to be in Brazil for the World Cup - so they will want to ensure there are no slip-ups in their first qualifying matches of the year.\n\nEngland have been drawn in a qualifying group alongside 2023 winners Spain - who beat the Lionesses in the final - as well as Ukraine and Iceland.\n\nWiegman will name her squad for the first time in 2026 on Tuesday at 11:00 - who might feature and what are the key decisions for the Dutchwoman?\n\nSuccess in 2025 - are the Lionesses ready for 2026?\n\nEngland have not had a competitive fixture since winning Euro 2025 as they beat China 8-0 and Ghana 2-0 in friendly matches at the end of last year.\n\nBefore that, they suffered a 2-1 defeat by Brazil on their homecoming return but recorded a 3-0 win over Australia three days later.\n\nThe matches gave Wiegman an opportunity to test new players and formations - handing a debut to 30-year-old goalkeeper Anna Moorhouse in the process.\n\nAmong those to receive their first senior call-ups to the squad were defenders Anouk Denton, Taylor Hinds and forward Freya Godfrey.\n\nThere was also time for England stars Leah Williamson, Lucy Bronze and Lauren James to recover from lengthy injuries.\n\nChelsea defender Millie Bright, who captained England to the World Cup final in 2023, announced her retirement in October having withdrawn from the Euros.\n\nThere was a serious blow for Arsenal forward Michelle Agyemang - one of England's key players in Switzerland - as she was carried off on a stretcher after suffering an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury during the win over Australia.\n\nBut it's been a successful time for the other Lionesses in Arsenal's squad, including captain Williamson, who lifted the Champions Cup in February.\n\nAnd Chelsea goalkeeper Hannah Hampton was named the world's best goalkeeper at the Ballon d'Or awards in September, as Wiegman picked up the best coach award.\n\nHampton also wrapped up the BBC Women's Footballer of the Year award in November after being caught up in the fallout of Mary Earps' autobiography, which was released earlier that month.\n\nMost of Wiegman's key players have returned from injury in recent weeks - but there will still be some noteable absentees.\n\nManchester United midfielder Ella Toone is out with a hip issue until the end of March so will not feature against Ukraine or Iceland.\n\nThere are not many midfield options available with Aston Villa's Missy Bo Kearns also absent, while team-mate Lucia Kendall came off the bench to play 28 minutes of Villa's 7-3 thrashing by Tottenham on Sunday - her first appearance in five weeks due to a thigh injury.\n\nElsewhere, Arsenal winger Beth Mead fractured her shin so is out but Chloe Kelly made her return at the end of January and is available for selection.\n\nArsenal defender Hinds has had an ankle injury that has kept her out for a few weeks but she could still be included.\n\nChelsea full-back Niamh Charles is also sidelined with an ankle injury but team-mate Aggie Beever-Jones came on as an 83rd-minute substitute in their win over Liverpool on Sunday so her return is timely.\n\nTottenham full-back Ella Morris is close to returning from the ACL injury she suffered last year but will not be back in time.\n\nMeanwhile, Agyemang and Arsenal defender Katie Reid are still recovering from their respective ACL injuries.\n\nThere remains a lack of full-back options for Wiegman with Manchester United captain Maya Le Tissier seen as back-up for Bronze despite playing her club football at centre-back every week.\n\nCharles' absence and Hinds' recent injury means there are limited options at left-back too - meaning Manchester City's Alex Greenwood could once again make the switch from centre-back to full-back.\n\nThere could be a recall for Bay FC's Anouk Denton, who moved to the American club from West Ham in February, two months after making her England debut.\n\nLondon City Lionesses forward Godfrey has impressed this season and Wiegman was at Leigh Sports Village on Sunday to see her grab an assist in a 2-1 defeat by Manchester United.\n\nThe 20-year-old was called up for the first time in November but remains uncapped - so she will hope to feature this time around.\n\nTeam-mate Izzy Goodwin could be a surprise call-up in Beth Mead's absence, though Chelsea's James is back so Wiegman has other attacking options.\n\nWiegman will need to manage players like Kelly, Bronze and Keira Walsh who have not been fully fit in recent weeks and they may not be able to start both games.\n\nBut she will have been boosted by James' impressive display for Chelsea on Sunday, while Jess Park has shone for United and Lauren Hemp for Manchester City.",

    "fullText": "England narrowly avoided a disaster in their final T20 World Cup group match against Italy on Monday.\n\nHarry Brook won the toss and controversially decided to bat first at Eden Gardens in Kolkata.\n\nEngland were 105/5 after a shaky opening 13 overs before Will Jacks rescued the innings with an unbeaten 53 from 22 balls.\n\nItaly then battled back from 22/3 to 135/4 in their run chase, making the England players and fans nervous.\n\nHowever, the Italians ultimately collapsed to 178 all out, and the Three Lions qualified for the Super 8s.\n\nBrook made an interesting comment about England’s performance in his post-match interview, which many will disagree with.\n\nHarry Brook has every reason to be pleased with his team’s progression into the last eight of the competition.\n\nHowever, it would be foolish to suggest that England’s performance against Italy was anything to be proud of.\n\nItaly are the 26th-ranked team in the ICC T20I Team Rankings, so it should never have been a close contest.\n\nThat is why it was so surprising to hear Brook’s claim that England bowled well on Monday.\n\n“I thought we fielded excellently, and we bowled nicely as well,” he said. “I never had a doubt at the end with Sam [Curran] and Jamie [Overton]. Sam has been awesome, and he has been throughout this comp so far.\n\n“When Jof is on a heater, you want to get as much out of as possible – he did that today in his first couple of overs.”\n\nWithout question, England will need to bowl much better in the next stage of the tournament if they want to make the semi-finals.\n\nWhile Brook praised England’s bowlers, he did recognise that their batting unit must improve quickly.\n\n“We haven’t played our best cricket,” he added. “At the end of the day, we have made it through, and we’re heading to Sri Lanka, so we can be happy about that.\n\n“A little bit of a trend in this competition. We have not managed to string along the score as we like to do as a batting unit. We have got to keep on being brave and taking our options.”\n\n202 would normally be an excellent T20 score, but England would have hoped for at least 220 against cricket minnows Italy.\n\nBen Stokes finally has a rude awakening about importance of helmets in cricket\n\nMatthew Renshaw’s scathing interview reveals main culprit behind Australia’s disastrous loss vs. Zimbabwe\n\nSir Geoffrey Boycott reignites Joe Root debate after England’s T20 World Cup loss to West Indies",

    "fullText": "PARIS, Feb 16 (Reuters) - French police searched the Arab World Institute in Paris on Monday as part of a ‌probe into its former head, ex-culture minister Jack Lang, and ‌his links to late convicted U.S. sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, prosecutors said.\n\nFrance's National Financial Prosecutor (PNF) said ​in a statement that the Arab World Institute was among several locations being raided.\n\nProsecutors this month opened a preliminary investigation of Lang and his daughter Caroline on suspicion of tax fraud following the release of documents on Epstein in ‌the U.S.\n\nLang, who was ⁠culture minister under late Socialist president Francois Mitterrand, resigned this month from the Arab World Institute, which he had led ⁠since 2013.\n\nHe has said he was unaware of Epstein's crimes despite corresponding with him between 2012 and 2019, 11 years after the financier was convicted of soliciting ​prostitution ​from an underage girl.

    "title": "Nvidia: A complete guide to the hardware company behind the AI boom",
    "description": "Nvidia is one of the world's most valuable companies. Read about its history, leadership, and financials.",
    "fullText": "Nvidia has been around for over three decades, but the chipmaker became a household name only in the past few years.\n\nIn October 2025, the AI chipmaker became the first company to hit a $5 trillion market cap.\n\nNvidia was founded in 1993 by Jensen Huang, Chris Malachowsky, and Curtis Priem, \"with a vision to bring 3D graphics to the gaming and multimedia markets.\"\n\nThe boom in AI technology has made it one of the most valuable companies in the world as companies scramble to buy its graphics processing units. Here's what you need to know about Nvidia.\n\nNvidia's origin story began at a Denny's during a meeting between Huang — who once worked for the chain — Malachowsky, and Priem.\n\nPersonal computing was on the cusp of taking off, and the trio sought a way to capitalize on it. Huang said in a 2010 interview with Stanford University's engineering school that they \"wondered whether starting a graphics company would be a good idea.\"\n\n\"We brainstormed and fantasized about what kind of company it would be and the world we could help,\" he said. \"It was fun.\"\n\nTheir goal was to improve the experience of gaming on a PC.\n\nIn 2006, it released CUDA, a general-purpose programming interface that would expand its business far beyond gaming.\n\nOn Sequoia Capital's \"Crucible Moments\" podcast, Andrew Ng, a Stanford professor who founded Google Brain, recalled his students telling him, \"Hey, Andrew, there's this thing called CUDA — not that easy to program, but it's letting people use GPUs for something different.\"\n\n\"We started to see 10x or even 100x speedups training neural networks on GPUs because we could do 1,000 or 10,000 things in parallel rather than one step after another,\" he added.\n\nNvidia's GPUs were used to train AlexNet, an image classification system unveiled in 2012 that significantly influenced the field of deep learning.\n\nThe launch of ChatGPT in late 2022 ushered Nvidia into a new era. The chipmaker's shares surged by more than 1,000% from 2022 to early 2026.\n\nMuch of that growth came from the success of Nvidia's H100 chip, which it released in March 2022. The $40,000 chip, named for the computer scientist Grace Hopper, has played a crucial role in providing the computing power for large language models.\n\nSince the launch of Nvidia's Blackwell chips, which are twice as fast as its Hopper chips, customers including SoftBank, Amazon Web Services, and Microsoft have also flocked to the company.\n\nNvidia's success may be best personified by its CEO, Jensen Huang.\n\nA 61-year-old bona fide tech mogul, Huang has a net worth of about $165 billion, according to Forbes. While some execs sport chains or Patagonia vests, Huang is often spotted in a leather jacket. Business Insider identified at least six versions he's worn over the years, including a nearly $9,000 lizard-embossed coat from Tom Ford he wore at the company's global AI conference, GTC, in 2024. He commemorated Nvidia's stock price hitting $100 with a tattoo of Nvidia's logo on his arm.\n\nHuang's early years were tumultuous. He was born in Taiwan, and he spent time there and in Thailand before his parents sent him to the United States because of social unrest in the region.\n\nHe attended a reform school in Kentucky. He later moved to Oregon, where he was reunited with his parents. In high school, he became a nationally ranked table tennis champion.\n\nHuang graduated from Oregon State University with a degree in electrical engineering in 1984.\n\nDuring his freshman year, Huang met Lori Mills, his future wife. In an interview at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, he said he won her over by offering to help her with her homework. They married five years after meeting and now have two children.\n\nJensen Huang later earned a master's in electrical engineering from Stanford, and he worked at the chip companies LSI Logic and Advanced Micro Devices before launching Nvidia.\n\nHuang sold about 1.3 million shares of Nvidia when the company hit a $3 trillion market cap in June 2024, but he retains a more than 3% stake in the company.\n\nNvidia's business is built around GPUs, which can handle tasks simultaneously, as opposed to central processing units, or CPUs, which are in standard computers.\n\nNvidia's GPUs have become a mainstay of the AI revolution because they provide the computing power needed to run massive large language models like OpenAI's GPT-4 and Meta's Llama 3.\n\nDemand for Nvidia's H100 chips, built on its Hopper architecture, has been so high in late 2023 and 2024 that tech execs like Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk have bragged about how many units they're training new technology on. ByteDance has found workarounds to the US export bans on the chips to China. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have bought up thousands of units to fuel their AI ambitions, while venture capitalists have bought Nvidia GPUs as backup units for their startups.\n\nIn 2024, Nvidia unveiled its Blackwell chips, which it says are twice as fast as its Hopper chips and have attracted customers including SoftBank, Amazon Web Services, and Microsoft. The recent frenzy around the Chinese company DeepSeek's models has fueled demand for Nvidia's H200 chips.\n\nIn January 2025, Huang also unveiled new chips targeting the gaming, robotics, and autonomous vehicle industries, as well as partnerships with Toyota and Microsoft.\n\nAt the January 2026 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Huang unveiled the new Vera Rubin architecture that will succeed Blackwell. During his presentation, Huang said Vera Rubin is built to confront the core problem of a surge in computing demand.\n\nCompared with Nvidia's Blackwell architecture, Huang said Rubin delivers more than three times the performance, can run inference up to five times faster, and offers significantly higher inference compute per watt.\n\nA key to Nvidia's success is also CUDA, a software layer that can link GPUs to almost any AI application a developer wants to run. It's a critical component of the competitive advantage, or moat, that Nvidia has built up over the years.\n\nStill, AMD, Nvidia's main competitor, is quietly catching up. In October 2025, AMD announced a major multi-year strategic partnership with OpenAI under which OpenAI will deploy up to 6 gigawatts of AMD Instinct GPUs for its AI infrastructure starting in the second half of 2026. The deal is expected to bring tens of billions of dollars in revenue to AMD over time.\n\nNvidia's other competitors include Intel and IBM. Tech giants like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta have also released their own AI chips.\n\nNvidia overtook Apple and Microsoft for the title of the most valuable company in the world when it hit a historic $5 trillion in market capitalization in October 2025.\n\nAfter a tumultuous start to 2025 over chip export restrictions to China that would have cost billions in losses for Nvidia, Nvidia is heading into 2026 with confidence that demand for its AI chips is far from peaking.\n\nIn 2025, the chipmaker's blockbuster third-quarter results brought in $57 billion in revenue, including $51 billion from its data center business alone, beating Wall Street expectations. Nvidia raised its fourth-quarter forecast to $65 billion in sales, helping revive AI and semiconductor stocks after a brief slump. Shares of Nvidia and peers rallied on the upbeat outlook.\n\nHuang repeatedly dismissed fears of an AI bubble, arguing that the shift from CPUs to GPUs, the rise of agentic AI, and monetization through advertising all point to sustained growth. Nvidia also expanded its influence through major partnerships with OpenAI, Anthropic, and hyperscalers such as Meta.\n\nLooking to 2026, Nvidia is betting big on next-generation chips like Blackwell Ultra, massive AI infrastructure projects, and growth areas including robotics and automotive. While US export restrictions on China remain a headwind, Nvidia expects hyperscalers and global AI investment to keep demand strong into next year.\n\nNvidia is based in Santa Clara, California. Nvidia's headquarters, known as Voyager, was designed by the architectural firm Gensler and is about 750,000 square feet.\n\nIt has parks, \"treehouses\" for gatherings, and places designed to help employees focus. However, the overall design is intended to facilitate Nvidia's flat organizational structure.\n\n\"When you're moving that fast, you want to make sure that that information is flowing through the company as quickly as possible,\" Huang told the Harvard Business Review in 2023.\n\nIt's also a way to create more harmony between leadership and workers. Huang, who in 2023 oversaw 50 direct reports, has said that CEOs \"by definition\" should have the most direct reports at a company.\n\nHuang has earned a reputation among those who work with him as a demanding boss. Meetings with Huang can get heated, and senior employees have described his tough questions as a \"Jensen grilling.\"\n\nNvidia's top executives include Ian Buck, a vice president of hyperscale and high-performance computing; Colette Kress, the chief financial officer; and Bryan Catanzaro, a vice president of applied deep learning research.\n\nLanding a job at Nvidia isn't easy, but Lindsey Duran, a VP of recruitment, told BI that Nvidia applicants should express an interest in generative AI, tap into their professional network for referrals, and aim to do an internship.",

    "fullText": "Men's T20 World Cup, Group B, Pallekele\n\nAustralia 181 all out (20 overs): Head 56 (29); Hemantha 3-37\n\nSri Lanka 184-2 (18 overs): Nissanka 100* (52), Kusal Mendis 51 (38)\n\nAustralia's hopes of reaching the Super 8 stage of the T20 World Cup are all but over after Sri Lanka's Pathum Nissanka hit a brilliant unbeaten 100 to condemn them to an eight-wicket defeat in Pallekele.\n\nStunned by Zimbabwe in their second outing on Friday, Australia needed a win to keep their qualification fate in their own hands but it is Sri Lanka who march into the next round.\n\nFor Australia to sneak through as the second-placed team from their group, they now need Zimbabwe to lose both of their remaining matches against Ireland and Sri Lanka and then to defeat Oman themselves which would bring net run-rate into play.\n\nAustralia's predicament came from their inability to convert a good start from their openers Travis Head and Mitchell Marsh as they set the home side a target of 182 after a collapse in the second half of their innings.\n\nDespite the feeling Sri Lanka could have a complicated chase on their hands because of a pitch which was slowing down, they eased to victory with the Australian bowling attack lacking any bite in the absence of injured Pat Cummins, Josh Hazlewood and Mitchell Starc.\n\nAnd the Sri Lanka duo of Nissanka and Kusal Mendis took full advantage.\n\nWith wicketkeeper Mendis providing perfect support with a composed 51 from 38 balls, Nissanka brought up his century in 52 balls to take his side past the finish line with an innings that blended brute power and finesse.\n\nAustralia had Marsh return after recovering from a groin injury that forced him out of the first two matches and the returning skipper gave his side a solid platform batting alongside Head, who hit a long-overdue half-century off 27 balls.\n\nThey powered Australia to 104-0 in 8.2 overs before Head departed for 59 and it marked the beginning of dramatic downturn.\n\nMarsh followed him shortly after with a brisk 54 as they unravelled alarmingly to be bundled out for 181, losing their final five wickets in the space of just seven runs and 14 balls.\n\nWith Sri Lanka chasing down the target with ease, the Australians are left clinging to only the slimmest mathematical hope and will watch nervously as Zimbabwe face Ireland on Tuesday.\n\nIt looked as though Sri Lanka's chase of 182 might slip away early when Kusal Perera fell to Marcus Stoinis only eight balls in.\n\nBut it became clear almost immediately Nissanka was operating on an entirely different level in Pallekele, playing \"an innings for the ages,\" as Test Match Special commentator Daniel Norcross labelled it.\n\nNissanka raced to 38 off 20 balls to lift Sri Lanka to 61‑1 at the end of the powerplay.\n\nKusal Mendis then picked up the pace against Australia's spinners, bringing up his third consecutive half-century of this T20 World Cup in 35 balls before Nissanka joined him, reaching his fifty in just 32 deliveries.\n\nAustralia would have hoped for a way back after Mendis departed in the 13th over with Sri Lanka on 105‑2, and though Pavan Rathnayake walked in, he only needed to play second fiddle to Nissanka, who effortlessly took Sri Lanka past the target.\n\nThe 27‑year‑old Sri Lanka opener was outstanding in manipulating the leg‑side field all game, scoring 26 runs through mid‑wicket and another 20 through square leg.\n\nBut he mixed brutal hitting with plenty of finesse too, guiding 15 runs down to third with some deft late cuts.\n\nAdding extra sweetness to Nissanka's day was an extraordinary catch he took to dismiss Glenn Maxwell and keep Australia at bay in the closing stages of their innings.\n\nHaving dropped Maxwell in the previous over, Nissanka more than made up for it with a brilliant flying catch at backward point to send back the Australia all-rounder, who had looked dangerous.\n\nThough there will be concern for pacer Matheesha Pathirana, who walked off with an injury, Sri Lanka will fancy their chances of putting on a good show in the Super 8s and making it to the semi-finals, with both Nissanka and Mendis in good form.\n\nAustralia captain Mitchell Marsh: \"I thought it was a competitive total at the halfway mark but with the start we had, maybe a few short. Well played to Sri Lanka.\n\n\"We know that at our best we can make big scores but we lost our way a little bit at the end and Sri Lanka bowled well. Not much more to say other than Sri Lanka outplayed us.\n\n\"It's a devastated group. We are in the lap of gods now. We haven't been at our best. We will watch the Zimbabwe vs Ireland game and hope.\"\n\nSri Lanka captain Dasun Shanaka: \"One of the best performances in the recent times. Really happy with how the proceedings went.\n\n\"We were still very positive after losing [Pathirana] in the powerplay. We had the confidence and knew about the wicket. Each and every one showed a good body language today. And everyone wanted to contribute somehow.\n\n\"We hope to continue like this in the tournament. It's wonderful to qualify after many years. It's a good team. We should go to the next round and hopefully make to the semis. Thanks to the massive crowd today.\"\n\nNissanka's century leads Sri Lanka to victory and puts Australia on brink - as it happened\n\nWho needs what to reach T20 World Cup Super 8s?\n\nMen's T20 World Cup tables, top run-scorers & wicket-takers",

We don't want it to be that close and feel those nerves.\n\n\"But, going forward, it's more experience and we can never have enough of that.\"\n\nEngland progress at World Cup despite Italy scare\n\n'England have no chance at T20 World Cup if they do not improve'\n\nJofra Archer took two wickets in the first over of Italy's chase but Ben Menenti smashed 60 from 25 balls and Grant Stewart 45 from 22 to give Italy real hope.\n\nWith Stewart at the crease, the tournament's lowest-ranked side needed 30 runs from the final two overs for an almighty upset.\n\nThat England came through is obviously a positive. Sam Curran, who also defended 10 from the last over against Nepal, dismissed Stewart in the penultimate over.\n\nHe admitted there have been nerves throughout the initial group stage.\n\n\"It's actually just a tricky stage in a World Cup,\" Curran told the BBC.\n\n\"You're nervous, you've got all kinds of nerves and expectation.\n\n\"I had a little chat with Morgs [former England captain Eoin Morgan] before the toss and said these are the hardest games because we want to get there so badly.\n\n\"Now we've done it it's [about] enjoying it. This is our first aim and now we focus on the teams that we know will be in our group.\"\n\nEngland will play their entire Super 8s phase in Sri Lanka, where they recently beat the co-hosts 3-0 in a T20 series.\n\nTheir opponents are yet to be confirmed. If it goes to seeding then it will be Sri Lanka, Pakistan and New Zealand with the top two progressing to the semi-finals.\n\nJacks said he remains as confident in England as when the group left Sri Lanka at the start of the month.\n\n\"Going back to Sri Lanka, we feel confident there,\" he said. \"That experience is good for us.\n\n\"We've obviously done it the hard way, we've not made it easy. But the most important thing is we are on to the Super 8s.\"",

    "fullText": "It has been a miserable season for Marc-Andre ter Stegen, who has made only three appearances for Barcelona and Girona. The 33-year-old missed almost the entire first half of the season as he was recovery from back surgery, and after moving to Montilivi, he featured twice before tearing his hamstring.\n\nThere is little chance of ter Stegen returning to action before April, which means he would have a matter of weeks to get himself up to speed ahead of this summer’s World Cup. He has hopes of being Germany’s starter at a major tournament for the very first time, although his injury woes have left these in tatters.\n\nRecent comments by Germany head coach Julian Nagelsmann have appeared to back this up. As per Sempre Barca, he has admitted that ter Stegen’s current situation makes it difficult for him to be called up for the World Cup.\n\n“There are three things to consider regarding the goalkeeper position. It’s a tragic injury (for ter Stegen), which I deeply regret. I will never rule him out completely because it is his turn. We have to make the right decision for him and for us. And at the moment, the situation is not favourable.”\n\nGiven that he is 33 years of age, ter Stegen will not have too many years left in football – especially consider his recent injury woes. This summer’s World Cup would have been the perfect time for him to be a starter for Germany at a major tournament, and at this stage, it appears that it will pass him by.\n\nGermany have a number of talented younger goalkeepers rising through the ranks, such as Bayern Munich’s Jonas Urbig and Freiburg’s Noah Atubolu. Both will fancy their chances of ousting ter Stegen in the coming years, and especially before the 2030 World Cup in Spain, Portugal and Morocco.",

    "fullText": "Multiple game creators describe ineffective moderation on the platform, resulting in unchecked hatred in forums and targeted campaigns of negative ‘anti-woke’ reviews\n\nFor years, the gaming storefront Steam has let abuse and bigotry pass through its moderation, according to players and developers who use it. The platform is now host to reams of content that violate its own guidelines.\n\nAccording to developers who spoke with the Guardian, abuse – particularly directed towards transgender creators – is a fact of life on the platform. “Everyone is at one another’s throats all the time in reviews, discussions, forums, anywhere you can possibly find it on Steam,” says content creator and Steam curator Bri “BlondePizza” Moore. “It ensures no one is safe on the platform; developers and consumers alike.”\n\nAside from the content of Steam’s forums, sources pointed to two main causes for concern: bigoted reviews posted on games’ Steam pages, which can hugely affect sales for their developers; and Steam curators (self-appointed taste-makers on the platform) directing campaigns against games they perceive to lean left or pursue inclusion.\n\n“I’m not new to online harassment,” says designer Nathalie Lawhead, who spent two years trying to get reviews removed from their games’ pages. Both reference allegations of sexual assault that Lawhead made in 2019. “I assumed reporting Steam abuse might have its own issues. But when people suggested that I open a ticket, I did have hope that this would be the way to get it resolved.”\n\nOne of the reviews, published in 2023, read, “cringe game, made by a liar”. The other, a review of Lawhead’s game Blue Suburbia posted in 2024, said: “A women [sic] who seeks to destroy other’s [sic] career made this. It’s very poorly put together. She also probably has dual Israeli citizenship with how pointy her nose is.”\n\nDespite Steam’s code of online conduct and community guidelines prohibiting “abusive language or insults”, public accusations or “discrimination”, moderators initially cleared both reviews after Lawhead reported them.\n\nSteam does not allow cleared content to be reported again by the same user unless it has been edited. So Lawhead asked others on social media to report the reviews, which prompted Steam to remove the antisemitic example. The other, however, was passed again. “We aren’t in a position to verify the accuracy of statements made in user reviews,” reads a response from Steam sent on 9 January 2026, “and we don’t try to moderate reviews based on accuracy.” Removing reviews, the response claimed, could be seen as “censorship”.\n\n“Crushing,” is how Lawhead describes Steam’s missive. “The implication seems to be that I must prove my sexual assault [to Steam] if I want to be protected from harassment over it,” they say. “I am hard-pressed to see where the misunderstanding might be. They had all the information regarding the situation. It’s an obvious stance. It’s a choice.”\n\nThe remaining review was finally removed, but only after Lawhead personally approached an employee of Steam’s developer, Valve, outside the moderation ecosystem. “This was too much work just for two obviously unjustifiable reviews,” they say, describing having to resolve the issue outside the usual channels as awkward for both parties. “I think this entire process of moderation is broken.”\n\nWhile Lawhead was able to call on public support to help get reviews removed, that is not an option for every developer: not everyone has enough of a following. Others who have gone public with Steam moderation issues have received further harassment, and have asked to speak anonymously or be identified by their first names only.\n\nSome games have been targeted by Steam curators. Ethan, the developer of Coven, a first-person action-horror set in the 1600s, says he has been targeted by “CharlieTweetsDetected”, a curator devoted to recommending games based solely on whether their developers are perceived to have correctly mourned the assassination of rightwing activist Charlie Kirk.\n\nCharlieTweetsDetected’s review of Coven, a first-person action-horror game set in the 1600s, read simply “Celebrated Sept 10th on blue sky [sic]”. This encouraged others to post further reviews and comments related to Kirk (and not the game). “I even mentioned it to Steam support,” Ethan says, “how it stemmed from that curator list, but they weren’t interested.” Instead, Steam support claimed that “off-topic” constituted “a recipe for cookies, or something completely unrelated to video games that is clearly trolling.” Reviews referencing Kirk, including one reading simply “RIP Charlie Kirk” alongside a negative rating, did not fit that criteria according to Steam; all remain in place today.\n\nElsewhere, campaigns chase games that include trans or LGBTQ+ characters. A trans developer included on a curation list titled “NO WOKE” cites frequent discussion threads, including one that referred to them as a “transvestite” and asked whether their game included “woke faggotry.” Plane Toast’s Émi Lefèvre points to reviews and discussions of Caravan SandWitch, a sci-fi action-adventure and driving game, which frequently approach its queer characters negatively. “Too LBGTQ [sic] … There is no future or continuation for these sad gays and lesbians,” reads one among many that remain visible on the game’s store page.\n\n“For sure, the ‘anti-woke’ curators brought insincere negative attention to the game,” Lefèvre says. “Valve’s refusal to moderate any of this is making Steam reviews and forums the battleground for some kind of culture war, and is making them unsafe for marginalised people and regular gamers trying to simply enjoy the game they bought.”\n\nThanks to this influx of bad actors, and the lengths that developers need to go to in the hopes of getting hateful content removed from their pages, often without success, many report feeling held hostage by the platform. Steam has become essential for developers. It brings in millions of daily users – last month it had almost 42 million concurrent players – and billions of dollars. “No other storefront has the clout that Steam does,” Lawhead says. “Publishers don’t take you seriously if you’re not on it.”\n\nThat level of success results in hundreds of thousands of support tickets every week. Details about how Valve, a company that has been reported to employ fewer than 400 people, handles its moderation load are elusive. Online consensus, including among those formerly involved in Steam’s volunteer moderation programme (retired in 2022), is that the process must be outsourced. The Guardian reached out to Valve on multiple occasions, through multiple channels, \n\nDeveloper Phi endured an identical process to Ethan and Lawhead upon releasing Heart of Enya in 2021. After escalating a support ticket over transphobic reviews, Phi received the following response from a Steam agent: “It’s much better to continue working on the product, while letting the community use the helpfulness feature to surface reviews that they agree with or find to be uninformed.” (This exact wording was in Steam support’s response to Lawhead five years later.) “Most of our moderating decisions come down to a yes/no criteria … that’s a frustrating line to walk, and I think it inevitably leaves content that would be considered offensive.”\n\nThe agent suggested the issue would be discussed with their team, but after five years little appears to have changed.\n\n“To us, it seemed that in Steam’s [view], hateful comments about an individual is abuse – but targeting it towards a group of people is totally fine, that’s welcome speech,” Phi says. “We had no other choice for what to do about transphobia in our reviews. They’re still up there today.”\n\nRecourse for developers is limited. Some are looking into their own security, shoring up protections for developers on their team against being doxxed or hacked by trolls. Or, in the case of the developers of Caves of Qud, paying their own moderators to handle forums and the hate that spills out of Steam. Others push bigoted comments into public view in an attempt to cajole Valve, such as No More Robots head Mike Rose, who pushed back against racist reviews of its game Little Rocket Lab last year. “Woke game. Also has muslims,” reads one negative review; “please never, ever play any of our games ever again,” reads Rose’s response.\n\nOthers are just trying to roll with it. “Brown space lesbians trying and failing to contain a simple fungal outbreak” is, despite its original derogatory intent, “the hardest line in all of our marketing copy”, according to Ambrosia Sky developer Christina Pollock.\n\nIt is increasingly easy, however, for the average consumer to log on to Steam and encounter abuse, bigotry and hate, much of which has been cleared by moderators. And because reviews affect a game’s visibility on Steam, a single negative rating can mean the difference between success and failure. Lax moderation doesn’t just create individual harm but has profound professional and economic implications for developers across the platform.\n\nMany of them say they feel forced simply to endure it – unable to walk away from Steam’s near-monopoly on PC gaming. “If I am to continue existing on Steam, I am under the impression that I will have to go through this exhausting ordeal every time I want to report abuse,” Lawhead concludes. “This shouldn’t be normal.”",

    "fullText": "The biggest software companies might be reduced to mere data sources, says Snowflake's CEO.\n\n\"The big model makers want to create a world in which all of the data for all of the enterprises is easily available to them,\" Sridhar Ramaswamy said on an episode of Alex Kantrowitz's \"Big Technology Podcast\" published last week. \"Everything else, the world, is just a dumb data pipe that feeds into that big brain.\"\n\nPrior to becoming Snowflake's CEO in 2024, Ramaswamy was a partner at Greylock Ventures and cofounded AI search startup Neeva, which was acquired by Snowflake.\n\nRamaswamy added that Snowflake needs to operate with a \"fear\" that people would stop using AI agents developed by software companies and instead want an all-inclusive agent that has data from Snowflake, for example, and everywhere else\n\nHe said his solution was to let customers take the lead and decide how they want to access their data — directly through their own agents, or through a product like ChatGPT.\n\nIn the last few months, AI labs have evolved from being sources of AI infrastructure to becoming software providers themselves. OpenAI has entered the sales, support, and document analysis market, threatening incumbents such as Salesforce and Oracle.\n\nOn a podcast released last week, Andreessen Horowitz general partner Anish Acharya said software firms were being unnecessarily punished by Wall Street over fears that AI could take over their industry. The VC said that legacy software could not be replaced so easily, because it would not be worth it to use AI for every business function.\n\nHe said that software accounts for 8% to 12% of a company's expenses, so vibe coding to build the company's resource planning or payroll tools would only save about 10%. Instead, companies should focus on big-ticket items, like developing their core businesses or optimizing other costs.\n\nRamaswamy and Acharya's comments follow a brutal start of the month for software stocks, which dragged down tech and broader markets. The sell-off started when already-wary investors panicked about Anthropic's new AI tool, which can perform a range of clerical tasks for people working in the legal industry.",

    "description": "After weeks of debate about whether Pakistan's fixture against India would go ahead at the T20 World Cup, the action failed to deliver and it left the rivalry feeling more political than sporting.",
    "fullText": "Colombo awoke to its greyest sky of the week come Sunday morning. A portent, perhaps, of the weather forecast which briefly caused a scare prior to India's dominant win over Pakistan later that evening.\n\nIt certainly mirrored the cloud lurking over the build-up to cricket's most-charged derby. Pakistan relented on their original decision to boycott the fixture in solidarity with Bangladesh, who had to forfeit their place in this T20 World Cup when refused dispensation to play their games outside of India.\n\nArguably more interest stemmed from the pageantry of Sunday's game than from the actual cricket. Plenty were on handshake-watch given recent history between these two. Polite formalities did not return at the toss, Suryakumar Yadav and Salman Ali Agha giving each other the silent treatment.\n\nTo be ready for the myriad cameras capturing the flip of the coin, both captains have to be in place a good two minutes before getting on with the ceremony. When mired in such awkwardness, it seems an eternity.\n\nEnough time for a detail-oriented TV producer to spot that Salman, Pakistan's skipper, sported a kink in his collar. The scruffy schoolboy-look was rectified by an anonymous figure inadvertently stealing the situation's authority. It certainly detracted from the attempted strong-man image projected by stubborn leaders.\n\nAs did the behaviour of the ex-pros off the pitch. On the ICC broadcast, Rohit Sharma and Wasim Akram warmly greeted before walking the tournament trophy onto the field. Away from the cameras, Harbhajan Singh, Misbah Ul-Haq and Ramiz Raja were spotted in cordial conversation in the media area.\n\nThe stadium certainly felt different to earlier World Cup matches at this venue. A perimeter was set multiple blocks from the ground. Bags were inspected long before the entrance. And again upon arrival. The Sri Lankan special task force, previously unseen at this tournament, was out in force, automatic weapons on full display.\n\nEven the price of a fake jersey among street vendors shot up amid India-Pakistan inflation. Local entrepreneurs were delighted the fixture went ahead. As were the swarming hotels. Such was the influx in India's accommodation that Mohammed Siraj could not squeeze into the lift on his morning commute.\n\nThe backdrop reflected the magnitude of the occasion, but not necessarily any tension. That didn't come until the toss. Albeit there were some murmurs of discontent at the choice of pre-match music. Indian rapper Hanumankind performed with his dance troupe and pyrotechnics aplenty.\n\nHe appeared on the soundtrack to Dhurandhar, a movie released last year, the political undertones of which were not well received in Pakistan where the film is banned. Shortly after Sunday's performance concluded, the call to prayer could be heard from a local mosque. The cricketing gods have a sense of humour.\n\nBoth camps were reluctant to really delve into the off-field narratives. \"In these games the emotions are always going to be high but we need to deal with that,\" said Salman.\n\n\"We have played enough cricket and games like this. You have to see the bigger picture and win our next game to qualify for the Super 8s.\"\n\nKishan goes crazy as India hammer Pakistan\n\nOnce the cricket finally started, Ishan Kishan's belligerent hitting delighted the Indian-heavy crowd - which, it should be said, was not at capacity. Usman Tariq's curious action, his pause akin to Jorginho's jump when taking a penalty, dominated pre-match chat. He failed to remain the protagonist of the contest itself, albeit he did cheekily bow towards Suryakumar upon dismissing the man who was filmed mimicking his ways during Indian net sessions.\n\nAt the mid-innings break, some dared to think we could have a chase on our hands with Pakistan needing 176. India's dominant powerplay, taking four wickets and conceding just 39 runs, put a swift end to such notions.\n\nThe scoreline in this match-up at T20 World Cups now reads 8-1 in favour of India. This rivalry has become political, rather than a sporting one. As tedious as the interference is, it offers more to discuss than one side consistently outclassing the other.\n\nAs if aware of this, in a lull during Pakistan's inevitable defeat, the ICC replayed the cordial exchange between Wasim and Rohit prior to the match. Aren't we all getting along just fine? Just not to the extent that players shook hands once India wrapped up their shellacking. That sign of respect continues to feel some way off.\n\n\"We see them as a team - we are not thinking about this as a rivalry or whatever,\" said India's Axar Patel.\n\n\"We are playing against one team and we are focusing on cricket. Whenever I'm playing, I'm not thinking about whatever, I treat it as one match and opponent.\"\n\nAfter the final wicket, Hardik Pandya and Shivam Dube did not feel they had hit their desired workloads. The former bowled three overs in the match, the latter was not required. Out came bowling coach Morne Morkel to catch extra work with his baseball mitt. Opposition resoundingly dealt with yet more reps needed.\n\nAn apt reflection, not that it was required, of this contest's non-existent relationship with the sort of jeopardy required to make us all forget the politics.\n\nWho needs what to reach T20 World Cup Super 8s?\n\nMen's T20 World Cup tables, top run-scorers & wicket-takers\n\nWhy is there talk about a Pakistan spinner's action?",

    "fullText": "STAVANGER, Norway (AP) — Jeffrey Epstein repeatedly played up his ties to the former head of the Nobel Peace Prize committee in invitations to and chats with elites like Richard Branson, Larry Summers, Bill Gates and Steve Bannon, a top ally of President Donald Trump, the Epstein files show.\n\nThorbjørn Jagland, who headed the Norwegian Nobel Committee from 2009 to 2015, turns up hundreds of times in the millions of documents about the former U.S. financier and convicted sex offender that were released by the U.S. Justice Department last month.\n\nSince the release, Jagland, 75, has been charged in Norway for “aggravated corruption” in connection with an investigation prompted by information in the files, the economic crime unit of Norwegian police Økokrim said.\n\nØkokrim has said it would investigate whether gifts, travel and loans were received in connection with Jagland’s position. Its teams searched his Oslo residence on Thursday, plus two other properties in Risør, a coastal town to the south, and in Rauland to the west.\n\nHis attorneys at Elden law firm in Norway said Jagland denies the charges, and was questioned by the police unit on Thursday.\n\nWhile there is no evidence in the documents seen so far of any outright lobbying for the Nobel Peace Prize, Epstein repeatedly played up hosting Jagland at his properties in New York and Paris in the 2010s.\n\nIn September 2018, during Trump’s first term and in an apparent allusion to his interest in the peace prize, Epstein had a varied text-message exchange with Bannon, at one point writing — in one of many messages with untidy grammar: “donalds head would explode if he knew you were now buds with the guy who on monday will decide the nobel peace prize.”\n\n“I told him next year it should be you when we settle china,” he added, without elaborating.\n\nIn one email from 2013, mixing in investment tips and praise for PR tips, Epstein told British entrepreneur and magnate Richard Branson that Jagland would be staying with Epstein in September that year, adding: “if you are there, you might find him interesting.”\n\nA year after she left a job as White House counsel to President Barack Obama, in 2015, Kathy Ruemmler got an email from Epstein saying: \"head of nobel peace prize coming to visit, want to join?\"\n\nIn 2012, Epstein wrote former Treasury Secretary and Harvard University president Larry Summers about Jagland, saying “head of the nobel peace prize staying with me, if you have any interest.”\n\nIn that exchange, Epstein referred to Jagland — also a former Norwegian prime minister and former head of the Council of Europe, a human rights body — as “not bright” but someone who offered a “unique perspective.”\n\nThe financier wrote Bill Gates in 2014, saying that Jagland had been reelected as head of the Council of Europe.\n\n“That is good,” the Microsoft co-founder and formerly the world's richest man, wrote. “I guess his peace prize committee job is also up in the air?”\n\nDuring Jagland's tenure as chair of the committee, it gave the peace prize to Obama, in 2009, and the European Union in 2012.\n\nJagland was brought into Epstein’s orbit by Terje Rød Larsen, a Norwegian diplomat who helped broker the Oslo Peace Accords between Israel and Palestinians.\n\nLarsen and his wife are also facing corruption charges in Norway due to their association with Epstein.\n\nThe AP is reviewing the documents released by the Justice Department in collaboration with journalists from CBS, NBC, MS NOW and CNBC. Journalists from each newsroom are working together to examine the files and share information about what is in them. Each outlet is responsible for its own independent news coverage of the documents.",

    "fullText": "The T20 World Cup heads into the final week of group-stage fixtures with six spots in the Super 8s still up for grabs.\n\nWest Indies were the first team to qualify for the next phase, while India joined them with victory over Pakistan later on Sunday.\n\nHere's what the remaining teams need to progress to the next stage.\n\nThe top two teams in each group - A to D - will progress to the Super 8s, which will be made up of two groups of four.\n\nIf any teams are level on points after the four group-stage fixtures, they will be separated by number of wins and then net run-rate.\n\nThe International Cricket Council has pre-determined the Super 8 groups if the eight seeded sides qualify:\n\nX Group: India (X1), Australia (X2), West Indies (X3), South Africa (X4)\n\nY Group: England (Y1), New Zealand (Y2), Pakistan (Y3), Sri Lanka (Y4)\n\nIf any of those sides do not progress, the teams who do in their place will just fill the spot.\n\nEach team plays three more matches in the Super 8s phase, facing each of the other teams in their group once.\n\nAfter those fixtures, the top two teams from each group will advance to the semi-finals, with the winner of each Super 8s group facing the runner-up from the other.\n\nRemaining games: Pakistan v Namibia (18 Feb, 09:30) and India v Netherlands (18 Feb, 13:30)\n\nDefending champions India sealed their place in the Super 8s with a comfortable 61-run win over rivals Pakistan.\n\nPakistan slipped to third with that defeat, with their net run-rate taking a heavy hit.\n\nHowever, a win in their final game against Namibia on Wednesday would see them progress.\n\nUSA have played all of their games and are currently second but need Pakistan to lose their final game and for the Netherlands to lose or not overtake their net run-rate if they win.\n\nThe Netherlands must beat India, hope Pakistan lose and then it could come down to net run-rate.\n\nRemaining games: Australia v Sri Lanka (16 Feb, 13:30), Ireland v Zimbabwe (17 Feb 09:30 GMT), Sri Lanka v Zimbabwe (19 Feb, 09:30), Australia v Oman (20 Feb, 13:30)\n\nSri Lanka will progress with a win over Australia on Monday. If they lose they would likely need to beat Zimbabwe and then it could come down to net run-rate. Two wins would guarantee progression.\n\nAustralia would be eliminated if they lose to Sri Lanka on Monday and Zimbabwe beat Ireland on Tuesday. They may need to win both their remaining games and rely on net run-rate.\n\nZimbabwe will guarantee progression with two wins. One win potentially may be enough but it would come down to net run-rate.\n\nIreland need to win their last match and hope other results go their way because they can only qualify on net run-rate.\n\nRemaining games: England v Italy (16 Feb, 09:30), Scotland v Nepal (17 Feb, 13:30), West Indies v Italy (19 Feb, 05:30)\n\nWest Indies secured their progression with a nine-wicket win over Nepal on Sunday.\n\nEngland must beat Italy on Monday to progress. A defeat would likely see them eliminated on net run-rate.\n\nScotland need to beat Nepal and hope Italy beat England but do not overtake their net run-rate.\n\nItaly must beat England but could lose to West Indies and then net run-rate would decide who progresses. Two wins would see them through, as would a win against England and a washed-out game against West Indies.\n\nRemaining games: Afghanistan v UAE (16 Feb, 05:30 GMT), New Zealand v Canada (17 Feb, 05:30 GMT), South Africa v UAE (18 Feb, 05:30 GMT), Afghanistan v Canada (19 Feb, 13:30 GMT)\n\nSouth Africa are in a strong position to progress and their spot could be sealed on Monday if UAE lose to Afghanistan. Regardless of that result, a win against UAE on Wednesday would confirm their progression.\n\nNew Zealand likely need to win and hope that UAE do not win both of their games. If both of those things happen then net run-rate would decide who moves through.\n\nUAE likely need to win both of their remaining games and even then are likely to be relying on net run-rate to progress.\n\nAfghanistan need to win both of their matches, including one against UAE, and hope that neither UAE or New Zealand pick up points in their final game.\n\nCanada need to win both their remaining fixtures and will need other results to go their way.\n\nRun-rate is the average number of runs scored per over by a team in their entire innings - so, for example, a score of 140 off 20 overs equals seven runs per over.\n\nNet run-rate is calculated by subtracting the opposition's run-rate from the other team's run-rate.\n\nThe winning side will therefore have a positive net run-rate, and the losers a negative net run-rate.\n\nIn a tournament, net run-rate is worked out by taking the average runs per over scored by that team in each game and subtracting the average runs per over scored against them in each game.\n\nIf a team is bowled out inside their allotted overs, their run-rate is calculated by dividing the runs by the maximum overs they could have batted - 20 overs in the case of this tournament.\n\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "T20 World Cup, Group A, Colombo\n\nIndia 175-7 (20 overs): Kishan 77 (40); Ayub 3-25\n\nPakistan 114 (18 overs): Usman 44 (34); Hardik 2-16, Chakravarthy 2-17, Bumrah 2-17\n\nIndia continued their recent on-field dominance over Pakistan by winning their highly anticipated meeting in Colombo by 61 runs to confirm their place in the Super 8s of the T20 World Cup.\n\nAfter weeks of discussion and doubt over whether the match would even go ahead, India ultimately proved too strong and sealed a ninth successive win in completed matches against their rivals.\n\nAlthough the captains did not shake hands at the toss and there were no exchanges between the players after the final play, the rest of the match passed without any flashpoints amid the ongoing political tensions between the two nations and last year's military conflict.\n\nThe encounter was effectively won by a brutal early assault by India opener Ishan Kishan, who struck 77 from 40 balls on a tricky, turning pitch.\n\nIt gave co-hosts a flying start and meant, even with Pakistan's plethora of spinners slowing the scoring and taking wickets, they still posted 175-7.\n\nThat always felt a challenging total and Hardik Pandya took a wicket in the first over of the chase and Jasprit Bumrah two in the second to all but confirm the result.\n\nUsman Khan struck some blows in making 44 but Pakistan were swept aside - all out for 114 in 18 overs.\n\nWhile India are now certain to progress as they attempt to retain the title won in 2024, Pakistan must beat Namibia on Wednesday to guarantee their place in the Super 8s.\n\nShould they do so, the rivals could yet meet again in this competition in a semi-final or final.\n\nWho needs what to reach T20 World Cup Super 8s?\n\nMen's T20 World Cup tables, top run-scorers & wicket-takers\n\nIndia-Pakistan to go ahead as government ends boycott request\n\nFor a while it looked like this match would not happen.\n\nPakistan, whose last win against India was at the Asia Cup in 2022, announced a boycott a week before the tournament began, only to reverse their decision at the start of this week after extensive talks.\n\nIt went ahead, in front of a large crowd weighted towards Indian blue, because it is the most lucrative fixture in the world game, providing the funds upon which cricket's ecosystem survives in its current imperfect state.\n\nHow long that remains the case given India's dominance, built from their cricketing and financial might, remains to be seen.\n\nKishan's assault gave India breathing space and their bowlers were ruthless, even if their fielders dropped three catches.\n\nAfter Pakistan's seamers went the distance, Hardik began with a wicket maiden - dismissing right-hander Sahibzada Farhan, who skewed a pull shot high to mid-on.\n\nIn the next over, the majestic Bumrah pinned left-hander Saim Ayub in front with full inswinger, before Pakistan Salman Agha holed out playing a wild slog.\n\nEven Pakistan's biggest name, Babar Azam, was tamely bowled for five attempting a swipe to left-arm spinner Axar Patel in the fifth over, while left-handers Mohammed Nawaz and Faheem Ashraf meekly picked out fielders in the deep.\n\nAfter all of the build-up this was another underwhelming meeting.\n\nKishan's innings was an outlier across the match. He scored at a strike-rate of 192.50 per 100 balls. Only one other batter to face more than five deliveries, Shivam Dube - who made 27 from 17 balls - went at more than 130.\n\nOf the first 88 runs in the match, 77 came off the bat of Kishan as he made his second 50 in a row at this World Cup.\n\nHe was fortunate to chip three swings into gaps but otherwise hit cleanly in all directions until he was bowled by Ayub in the ninth over.\n\nSwitching through six different spinners, Pakistan's fightback came too late with mystery spinner Usman Tariq held back too long.\n\nAyub had Tilak Verma lbw for a stodgy 25 from 24 balls before Hardik hit his next ball to long-off. Had Ayub's hat-trick ball not narrowly missed Dube's edge and stumps after turning sharply, Pakistan may have had a better chance.\n\nTheir decision to bowl first also seemed a misstep, with the ball skidding through later on.\n\nDube was left to push India beyond 150 which was probably a par total in the conditions.\n\nIn truth, little went right for Pakistan.",

Former long-time bantamweight Muay Thai king Nong-O Hama takes on undefeated Russian standout Asadula Imangazaliev for the vacant ONE Flyweight Muay Thai World Title inside Bangkok’s iconic Lumpinee Stadium.\n\nThe explosive showdown takes place on March 20, live in Asia primetime, pitting a living legend and a young superstar against each other.\n\nNong-O spent years establishing himself as one of the most dominant World Champions in ONE Championship history.\n\nAfter winning the inaugural ONE Bantamweight Muay Thai World Title in 2019, he defended it a record seven times against top-flight opposition, blending sharp counters, clean combinations, and devastating finishing power.\n\nHis reign came to an end in a first-round knockout loss to Jonathan “The General” Haggerty in April 2023, and although he picked up another win at bantamweight a year later, the 39-year-old began reassessing his long-term path as the division grew bigger and more physical.\n\nThat’s when he decided to move to flyweight, which presented a fresh opportunity.\n\nAt 135 pounds, Nong-O could lean more heavily on his speed, balance, and timing. His debut in the division came at ONE Fight Night 28 against Kongthoranee Sor Sommai in a closely contested bout. Despite that fight ending in a split decision loss, his performance showed he could immediately compete with the division’s elite.\n\nThree months later at ONE Fight Night 31, the Evolve MMA representative returned with clear adjustments and defeated Kongthoranee by unanimous decision, controlling the tempo and displaying sharper movement across three fast-paced rounds in their rematch.\n\nThat victory carried significance. It confirmed Nong-O was not simply testing himself in a new weight class. He had recalibrated, and he had earned his place among the top contenders.\n\nThe Thai icon was initially scheduled to challenge for the flyweight Muay Thai crown at ONE 173 in November last year. However, after his opponent was not medically cleared to compete following the weigh-in and hydration test, the bout was shelved.\n\nNow, Nong-O finds himself standing opposite a young contender on a seemingly flawless trajectory.\n\nImangazaliev’s path has been fueled by momentum. After making waves with five wins – including four knockouts – on ONE Championship’s weekly Asia primetime spectacle, he secured a main roster contract at ONE Friday Fights 122 with a first-round head-kick knockout of seven-time Muay Thai World Champion “The Angel Warrior” Panpayak Jitmuangnon.\n\nThe finish instantly elevated the Team Mehdi Zatout product into serious contention.\n\nHe reinforced that status by stopping Kongthoranee in the second round at ONE Fight Night 39 this past January, extending his pristine record to 11-0, earning a US$50,000 performance bonus, and strengthening his claim for a World Title opportunity.\n\nWhile Nong-O brings World Championship composure and years of elite experience, Imangazaliev arrives in this matchup with explosiveness, confidence, and an unblemished record.\n\nWith the flyweight Muay Thai belt vacant, ONE Friday Fights 147 will determine who gets to claim the division’s throne. Inside the hallowed ground of Lumpinee Stadium, a new king will be crowned.",

    "fullText": "MILAN (AP) — Few figure skaters at the Winter Olympics have seen Adeliia Petrosian compete in real life.\n\nShe might leave with the gold medal.\n\nRussia's exclusion from international sports events during its war with Ukraine means that the 18-year-old Petrosian has only skated one senior competition outside of her homeland, the qualifier that earned her place as a neutral athlete in Milan.\n\nAs she readies to skate to Michael Jackson's music in the short program Tuesday, no one besides Petrosian and her controversial coach, Eteri Tutberidze, can be sure of her form, or whether she's injury-free.\n\nBut if Petrosian can get past skaters like the U.S. “Blade Angels” trio of Amber Glenn, Alysa Liu and Isabeau Levito, and Japanese stars Kaori Sakamoto and Ami Nakai, she'll shoot to sudden fame as the fourth consecutive Olympic champion from Russia.\n\nPetrosian is the latest star produced by Tutberidze, who revolutionized women's skating a decade ago by getting young girls barely in their teens to perform bigger and bigger jumps, only to have many of them struggle with repeated injuries.\n\nShe coached 2018 gold medalist Alina Zagitova, and a trio of standouts in 2022, when Anna Shcherbakova won the gold medal.\n\nBut the Beijing Games have been remembered less for Shcherbakova's triumph and more for the positive doping test turned in by another Tutberidze talent, 15-year-old Kamila Valieva. The case ended ultimately in a doping ban for Valieva that only recently ended, and an investigation into Tutberidze, though it found no evidence of wrongdoing by the Russian coach.\n\nTutberidze also was criticized for her harsh words toward her students in Beijing, while World Anti-Doping Agency president Witold Bańka said last week that he didn't “feel comfortable with her presence” at the Milan Cortina Olympics.\n\nAs part of the fallout from the Valieva case, the International Skating Union increased the minimum age from 15 to 17 for senior-level athletes. That means Petrosian is one of the oldest women's skaters that Tutberidze has coached at a major championship.\n\nPetrosian has landed quadruple jumps in Russian national events, much like her compatriots were able to do in previous Olympics, and none of the other skaters at the Milan Cortina Games are able to match those high-scoring elements.\n\nThe big question is whether she's fit enough to do it in Milan.\n\n“I can't turn properly,” Petrosian complained in a Russian documentary following Tutberidze released last week. Tutberidze said Petrosian had been making progress in a difficult program around the new year, but suddenly “everything hurt.”\n\nThere's been no indication of how Petrosian's condition may have changed in the last month as she readied for the Olympics.\n\nFitness has been a factor for months. Tutberidze previously told Russian media that Petrosian wanted to give up her place in September's Olympic qualifier for lower-ranked skaters after an injury but ended up competing because the Russian alternate's fitness was worse.\n\n“Let's imagine it's just Chelyabinsk.” That was the advice Russian skater Petr Gumennik got from his coach ahead of skating in the men’s event, to pretend that the Olympics were happening in that provincial Russian city.\n\nFor a few seconds, it felt as if the competition might indeed be happening in Russia.\n\n“When I went out there I got so much applause, there was such noise, you can't compare it to anything,” Gumennik said after skating in the short program, where he was 12th. “That's Olympic support. It was unexpected and it gave me strength and confidence.”\n\nGumennik was greeted by fans waving personalized banners with his face, calling out “well done” in Russian.\n\nThere also was a Russian flag in the stands, even though Olympic organizers have barred it from the Games, where athletes such as Gumennik and Petrosian were vetted for any support of the war before they were allowed to compete as neutral athletes.\n\nAs the Russian with the best chance of a gold medal at these Olympics, there may be even more support when Petrosian skates. ___\n\nAP Winter Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics",

    "title": "Too old or too good to ignore: The Mohammed Shami conundrum",
    "description": "Mohammed Shami's consistent domestic form and World Cup pedigree raise questions about his continued omission from the Indian team. Despite his impressive wicket-taking record, selectors appear hesitant, possibly due to age and injury concerns, while his coach insists performance and fire are paramount. His return remains a strong possibility.",
    "fullText": "These questions swirl every time Shami’s name is omitted from the Indian team. Everyone knows about him: the rasping seam, the wobble that refuses to settle and the habit of arriving at big tournaments and leaving with bigger hauls. Yet, for all that familiarity, his absence from the Indian team has now become a recurring theme.\n\nIndia are understandably wary of pinning their World Cup hopes on two high-class but injury-prone fast bowlers in their thirties: Shami and Jasprit Bumrah. With the domestic pace cupboard thin, the instinct is to invest early in younger bodies. What is harder to justify is ignoring pedigree. \n\nShami is India’s highest wicket-taker in ODI World Cups: 55 wickets at an average of 13.5 in 18 games. The recent numbers only strengthen his case. In four Ranji Trophy matches for Bengal, Shami bowled an average of 20 overs an innings and claimed 20 scalps at 18.6. In the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, he picked up 16 wickets in seven games. In the Vijay Hazare Trophy, he prised out 11 at 22.5 in five games. \n\nShami played a crucial role in India’s 2025 Champions Trophy, claiming 9 scalps from 5 games. Yet, he was omitted from 2025-26 central contracts.\n\nBadruddin Siddiqui, Shami’s long-time coach, does not mask his frustration. “There’s fire in him,” he says. “He is serious about playing for India. I always tell him --- perform karte raho: India will need you,” he says. For Siddiqui, the equation is simple. A cricketer’s job is to perform; the selectors’ job is to decide. “Age should never be a consideration. Fitness, performance and fire: that’s what matters.” \n\nDomestic cricket, Siddiqui argues, is too easily dismissed. “Bowling 25 overs in a day is not easy,” he says. “There is no bowler who can replace him. There is a lot left in him.” \n\nFormer Delhi pacer Sanjeev Sharma offers a more nuanced perspective. “There’s a lot of difference between domestic and international cricket,” he says. “Even a T20 international takes a lot out of you: in terms of fielding, bending and chasing. There is no place to hide in international cricket.” \n\n“Perhaps, Shami is not yet at the exact match-fitness level the selectors want him to be,” Sharma notes. \n\nPerhaps, communication has faltered, he says. But Sharma is unequivocal about Shami’s ability. \n\n“Skill-wise, he is your second-best fast bowler after Bumrah. There’s no doubt in my mind that Shami will return.” Around Shami, competition has intensified—Arshdeep Singh’s left-arm angles, Siraj’s stamina, Harshit Rana’s development. But competition does not erase class. “Performs speaks for itself,” Siddiqui says. “Bilkul wapas aayega: he will be back,” he adds.",

    "description": "From Costco to Toyota, global companies are filing lawsuits to secure tariff refunds should the Supreme Court decide to strike down Trump's duties.",
    "fullText": "Top global companies want their money back from the Trump administration.\n\nThe Supreme Court is in the process of deciding whether Trump's tariffs enacted under an emergency law, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, are legal. To companies that may have already paid billions in duties over the past year, a ruling against tariffs may not be enough to recoup funds.\n\nSmall businesses mainly spearheaded the initial wave of lawsuits against tariffs, but some of the largest global corporations are now filing lawsuits in fear that they may not be refunded should the Supreme Court overturn the duties.\n\nTypically, duties paid to the Customs and Border Protection undergo a process called liquidation within a year of the entry of the goods in question. Once liquidation occurs, the chances of getting any money back become slim — and for many companies, their time is running out.\n\nFrom Costco to Toyota, here are some of the largest global companies that want their tariffs refunded.\n\nCostco is seeking a \"full refund\" of tariffs it paid under the IEEPA, arguing the levies were imposed illegally and could soon become unrecoverable.\n\nIn a lawsuit filed with the Court of International Trade in December 2025, Costco's lawyers argued that the law, first enacted in 1977, has never authorized tariffs.\n\n\"The text of IEEPA does not use the word 'tariff' or any term of equivalent meaning,\" the company wrote.\n\nThe company also said in the complaint that it filed its own suit because even if the Supreme Court ultimately rules the tariffs unlawful, importers are not guaranteed refunds without separate court judgments. Costco said that its imports could begin entering \"liquidation\" as early as mid-December, which is a customs process that could permanently close the door on refunds. Customs has already declined to extend that timeline, Costco said in the suit.\n\nCostco did not disclose how much it has paid in duties.\n\nSubsidiaries of the Toyota Group, Toyota Tsusho America, Toyota Tsusho Canada, and Toyota Tsusho Nexty Electronics America filed a lawsuit in November 2025 to secure refunds.\n\n\"And this action is necessary now because the entries for which Plaintiffs paid tariffs imposed under authority of IEEPA will begin to become liquidated and final as a matter of law by January 31, 2026,\" the companies wrote in the complaint.\n\n\"Plaintiffs seek relief from the impending final liquidations to ensure that their right to a complete refund is not jeopardized,\" they added.\n\nThe auto sector has been among the industries most exposed to Trump's tariffs, which added duties on vehicles as well as on steel and aluminum. In May 2025, Toyota said that the higher import and export rates could cost the company about $1.3 billion over a two-month period.\n\nBYD's lawsuit marks the first from a Chinese carmaker against Trump's tariffs.\n\nThe EV giant filed the suit on February 9 and detailed nine executive orders related to trade that affected the company, including tariffs on cars, auto parts, aluminum, steel, and exports from China.\n\nIn the complaint, BYD wrote that it is seeking a refund of \"all IEEPA tariffs paid to date\" and \"all IEEPA tariffs that may be paid in the future.\"\n\nThe company also said that aside from China, its imports into the US from Canada, Germany, Mexico, and Poland were also affected.\n\nThe Chinese carmaker does not sell passenger cars in the US, but its business here includes buses, commercial vehicles, batteries, energy storage systems, and solar panels. According to its website, the company's truck plant in Lancaster, California, employs 750 workers.\n\nOn December 10, 2025, Goodyear Tire & Rubber filed its complaint and request for relief, and detailed how tariffs, especially the ones imposed on China, which changed nearly a dozen times, affected the company.\n\n\"Where CBP acts in a ministerial capacity (i.e., without discretion) in imposing a duty, the entry's liquidation cannot be protested,\" wrote Goodyear in its complaint as to why the company is asking the court to block liquidation.\n\nGoodyear sources a significant portion of its raw materials from Southeast Asia, where the rubber plant is widely commercially grown. According to Goodyear's website, the company's manufacturing facilities are located across 23 countries, including China, the US, Germany, Poland, and Thailand.\n\nAlcoa Corp, one of the world's top producers of aluminum, bauxite, and alumina, filed a complaint for tariff refunds on November 26, 2025.\n\nThis case is one of several dozen that were consolidated with AGS Company Automotive Solutions v. United States Customs and Border Protection, which became the lead case regarding IEEPA duty liquidation as of December 2025.\n\nAs of June 2025, tariffs on most steel and aluminum imports increased to 50%.",

    "fullText": "In his latest BBC Sport column, England World Cup winner Matt Dawson discusses the potential long-term impact of England's defeat by Scotland at Murrayfield, and the challenge of facing Ireland at Allianz Stadium on Saturday.\n\nI can easily reel off the losses that stuck with me in the Six Nations, as they can take you to a really dark place at times.\n\nScotland 2000, Ireland 2001 and France 2002 - they all still hurt.\n\nI was involved in all those campaigns and came up short of a Grand Slam by one victory three consecutive times.\n\nIt is important now to take stock and remember that defeat will happen again at some point before the 2027 Rugby World Cup.\n\nEngland will lick their wounds after yet another crushing defeat by Scotland, but even if a potential Grand Slam has gone, they still have a championship to play for.\n\nThe chance to win a Grand Slam does not come around very often, and that is the reality.\n\nLast week I said it would be foolish to draw a straight line from the opening weekend to a Grand Slam decider in Paris.\n\nThis tournament is magical for exactly that reason.\n\nTwo wins and England will be in a position to go to Paris and perhaps try to win the championship.\n\nThere is plenty to focus on and be excited about, and that Murrayfield pain will make England a better team.\n\nBig away wins are not easy in the Six Nations, and Saturday is another one that eluded Steve Borthwick.\n\nIt is not just about winning on another pitch as the World Cup is on neutral soil in Australia.\n\nIt is about the different feeling outside the Twickenham environment and home comforts.\n\nAs impressive as the 12-game winning run was, England still need that South African mentality - wherever you go in the world, you are expected to win and be globally successful.\n\nBorthwick is still yet to travel to Scotland, Ireland or France in the Six Nations and win.\n\nMost adversity comes from playing away from home, and Saturday gave the England players more of those scenarios.\n\nIt is very unlikely they will win a World Cup without a statement away victory beforehand.\n\nThere is a lot happening in these high-pressure games, and for high-paced players it is happening more quickly both physically and mentally.\n\nUnfortunately for Henry Arundell, who was being ultra-competitive, you have to read situations like the one when he took out Kyle Steyn in the air.\n\nEngland found themselves in a position where they were not playing well and were losing the scraps.\n\nIn those situations, you need clarity as well as competitiveness, and a red card obviously does not help to swing the momentum back.\n\nThat decision has cost England dearly and, given how competitive that wing slot is, I am sure Borthwick is going to have to manage that scenario.\n\nHenry is a 23-year-old and will, of course, bounce back, but it was reckless and a poor decision.\n\nWhat if that had been a championship decider or a World Cup knockout game?\n\nYou have to make good decisions under pressure. Being in those situations more often will help players learn.\n\nSix Nations: Scotland regain the Calcutta Cup\n\nError-strewn England flunk oldest Test at Murrayfield\n\nBewildering, bewitching, brilliant - Scotland's perfect day\n\nEngland will be licking their lips at the opportunity to bounce back against Ireland on Saturday.\n\nWe know England can perform with the comfort of home support, so it is not about putting things right - that will come in games in Rome and Paris.\n\nIt is about building on what they did prior to the Scotland game. Sometimes you have to park a game, write it off and move on.\n\nI thought I had seen England drift away from the kick-heavy style and strategy.\n\nScotland put on an attacking masterclass, whereas when England did attack it felt like they were punching for their lives but not actually landing anything.\n\nThey lacked shape, going left and right without making any progress - like a boxer on the ropes punching for their life but not actually hitting anything.\n\nGeorge Ford's failed drop-goal felt like a last-ditch option, which then resulted in what Borthwick described as a 10-point swing.\n\nI do not think you can blame Ford, the sequence was not set up properly and it felt like tired minds all over the place.\n\nDealing with a fast and furious game is, once again, a learning curve to take forward.\n\nTwo years ago there was plenty of talk that Ireland were going to beat England by 30 points at Twickenham.\n\nIt was such a mismatch in terms of where both sides were in their development.\n\nMarcus Smith's late drop-goal denied Ireland a potential Grand Slam, and that was a huge moment in Borthwick's tenure.\n\nNow England come in as favourites - it is amazing how quickly the landscape changes.\n\nHaving lost badly against France and nearly drawn against Italy, Ireland will be annoyed that everyone is writing them off.\n\nThey are a well-motivated team under Andy Farrell and are very well drilled.\n\nIreland will come out and probably play their best game of the campaign.\n\nScotland, in the space of a week, turned their disappointing loss in Rome into a convincing display against England.\n\nThat is how quickly things can change.\n\nDefeat next weekend and the pressure builds on England, with two difficult away fixtures to finish.\n\nSix Nations fixtures, results, standings and how to follow on the BBC\n\nRejuvenated Scotland sweep England aside in stunning Calcutta Cup win",

    "fullText": "What is the hardest coaching job in world sport?\n\nWe are talking about the ‘poisoned chalice’ roles — mostly big teams where standards are high, fans’ expectations are higher and where coaches also have to contend with the weight of a glorious history.\n\nWe asked our writers across all sports for their nominations for the title, from Manchester United to the USWNT via Ferrari team principal (among others). In each case, reporters were asked to focus on those teams’ wider historical context rather than simply this current season.\n\nAt the end of the article, you can vote for the job you think is the hardest in world sport. This list is far from definitive, so please do make your own suggestions in the comments below if you feel we have missed any roles out.\n\nCoaching the England men’s team is such a peculiar role that it even has a name attached: ‘An Impossible Job’. Former manager Graham Taylor was the subject of a documentary of the same name, which laid bare the team’s unsuccessful bid to qualify for the 1994 World Cup.\n\nPart of this is just the natural effect of assuming this country cares more about its national team than others. Many other nations have a lot of public pressure on this role and a lot of expectation, too. Yes, in the past, the media glare in that job has been ferocious — but that is not the case in quite the same way now. And it is certainly not distinctive to England either.\n\nPerhaps the hardest element is to bridge the gap between resources and record. The England men’s team have won one major tournament: the World Cup hosted by the country in 1966. But they now have the richest, most popular football league in the world in the Premier League on their doorstep. And yet, turning that to the advantage of the England team is a challenge that has yet to be resolved.\n\nCan Thomas Tuchel, the current coach who this week signed a new deal until the European Championship in 2028, be the man to do that at last?\n\nThere are many layers to why coaching the New York Jets feels like an impossible job. Let’s start with the simple statement: they are the New York Jets.\n\nThere is not an NFL team that has been referred to mockingly, or derisively, or served as the butt of a joke in television shows, movies or sketch comedies quite like this team. That reputation is part of what makes it hard to work here: the “Same Old Jets” of it all, a feeling that, eventually, things will go terribly, even when it feels like there is hope.\n\nThat ties to the franchise’s history. This is a team that has not won a Super Bowl since 1969 and has not found any sort of stability at quarterback since then, either. Coaching the Jets means answering to a fanbase that has grown increasingly angry the longer their playoff-less streak (15 years and counting) goes on. Current head coach Aaron Glenn is a beloved former Jets player and he was not granted much of a grace period — after one losing season, fans are already calling for his head.\n\nThe other challenge: ownership. Woody Johnson is known to be meddlesome, impatient and easily influenced by headlines.\n\nBut really, it all falls under the “Same Old Jets” umbrella, which coaches have failed to overcome going on for a few decades now.\n\nManaging Real Madrid is a uniquely difficult challenge. Florentino Perez, long-serving president of the record 15-time European Cup/Champions League winners, has little patience for long-term projects or planning, and no time for excuses or mitigating factors such as injuries or misfortune.\n\nPerez fills the dressing-room with big-name players who do not always fit together well, rarely enjoy detailed tactical instruction and seldom take responsibility when the team is not doing well.\n\nMadrid are actually owned by 80,000 members who demand the highest standards — and are surrounded by a voracious local media who mercilessly criticise anyone who even temporarily falls short.\n\nTo enjoy success in the Spanish capital, Madrid’s coach must be able to motivate and organise star players, while showing humility and intelligence in dealing with Perez, and accepting the only thing that really counts is regularly winning the biggest trophies.\n\nSince 2000, Madrid have had 18 different coaches — and just three have won a Champions League: Vicente del Bosque in 2000 and 2002, Carlo Ancelotti in 2014, 2022 and 2024, and Zinedine Zidane in 2016, 2017 and 2018.\n\nOther coaches with big reputations and personalities who have tried but failed include Jose Mourinho, Fabio Capello, Rafa Benitez, and, most recently, former playing icon Xabi Alonso. It is no surprise that the current incumbent, another former player, Alvaro Arbeloa, is feeling the pressure after just eight games.\n\nAll Formula 1 team principal jobs (the closest to a head coach’s role in other sports) come with pressure. But none compares to that of Ferrari, the sport’s most historic and trophy-laden team, who demand nothing but success. All of Italy is watching.\n\nIt is something Fred Vasseur, Ferrari’s team principal since 2023, felt last year. The team narrowly missed out on the title in 2024, only to then slide backwards and endure a winless season, despite the blockbuster signing of Lewis Hamilton. By mid-season, Vasseur was facing deep scrutiny in the press. Even with a new contract signed last June, that spotlight will only dim once success arrives.\n\nVasseur is Ferrari’s fifth team principal since 2014, with each of the past four changes coming abruptly in response to a lack of success. Simply fighting for wins is not enough to satisfy Ferrari’s board, the Italian press, or its fans watching around the world. Championships are the only currency they want to deal in.\n\nVasseur is acutely aware of that, his goal being to finally be the person to end Ferrari’s title drought (they last won the drivers’ title in 2007 and the constructors’ crown in 2008) and succeed in F1’s toughest job. But he needs to break the trend of his predecessors to make that happen.\n\nManchester United's 20 top-flight league titles, dating back to 1908, have been won by only three men: Ernest Mangnall, Sir Matt Busby and Sir Alex Ferguson. That is the same number of league-winning managers that Liverpool have had since 1990, Chelsea have had since 2010 and Manchester City have had since 2012.\n\nIt took United five attempts to land on Busby's true successor. That was long enough, but their next permanent manager will be the seventh since Ferguson's retirement after winning 38 trophies in his 26 years in charge.\n\nThat success made United one of the biggest clubs in the world — almost certainly the biggest in the English-speaking world — but also set an almost impossible standard to meet.\n\nWhoever eventually puts United back on their perch, in Ferguson's parlance, will have to work with an unpopular ownership, an insatiable media and a long list of ex-players who have been there, won it and started a podcast.\n\nBut most of all, they will need to match the expectation that United should be the dominant force in English football, even more than a decade on from the last of those league titles.\n\nTottenham are, in theory, one of the world’s most promising football clubs.\n\nBased in London, an international financial and sporting capital, they can attract talent over competition from most teams in the Premier League and beyond, and their world-class stadium and training ground are, or at least should be, a dream to operate in. They also have wealthy owners.\n\nAll of this leads to high expectations, but Spurs, irrespective of the manager, have consistently fallen short.\n\nNow-USMNT coach Mauricio Pochettino is considered the club’s most successful manager in the 21st century, taking Tottenham to a Champions League final and their highest finish in Premier League history (second). It felt like a golden age in waiting, but Spurs lost that final to Liverpool in 2019 and did not become English champions under Pochettino, failing to capitalise on the moment.\n\nSince then, Spurs have been on a steady decline — and no one has got particularly close to rescuing them over a sustained period.\n\nNo matter who has stood in the dugout, whether it has been Premier League winners Jose Mourinho or Antonio Conte, or Ange Postecoglou (who delivered the club's first trophy in 17 years last season at the expense of the club's worst league finish since 1976-77), Nuno Espirito Santo or Thomas Frank — the latter was sacked on Wednesday after only joining in June while Spurs have appointed the Croatian Igor Tudor until the end of the season — the product has never consistently matched the near-league-leading ticket prices. And the coaches are the ones who regularly take the blame.\n\nTottenham currently sit 16th in the Premier League, which led to the board moving on from Frank this week.\n\nThe potential of the young squad and the opportunity for investment should make them an exciting proposition for many top-class head coaches. But almost every type of manager has tried to establish Spurs as league and Champions League contenders post-Pochettino — and all have failed.\n\nThe average tenure of a permanent Chelsea manager this century is 532 days, or 17 and a half months. Across almost two decades of ownership under Roman Abramovich, the club ruthlessly chewed through many of the world’s most famous and successful coaches, banking a steady flow of trophies and pressing the ‘eject’ button at the first sign of failure.\n\nIt says something, then, that the Stamford Bridge dugout has become an even less forgiving environment since Abramovich, a Russian oligarch, sold up in 2022, following UK government sanctions imposed on him after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nLiam Rosenior is BlueCo’s fourth permanent head coach appointment in four years, and those numbers do not even account for Thomas Tuchel — the Champions League winner they inherited and quickly sacked, now in charge of England — or Frank Lampard, who returned for a second miserable stint as caretaker boss in 2023.\n\nTo win at the highest level with one of Europe’s youngest squads and satisfy a demanding and increasingly disillusioned fanbase is challenging enough. Then there is Chelsea’s unique executive structure, with co-sporting directors Paul Winstanley and Laurence Stewart heading up an increasingly sprawling brain trust overseeing everything from recruitment to injury prevention and management.\n\nIt is a structure that can only accommodate a head coach, not a manager, and both Mauricio Pochettino (in charge from 2023-2024) and Enzo Maresca grew weary of working within it. Rosenior, promoted with startling speed from BlueCo sister club Strasbourg, has been handed an incredible opportunity so early in his coaching career — but also a frighteningly difficult path to walk.\n\nPicture this: the biggest media market in the country. The franchise with by far the most World Series championships. The most intense fans in the game.\n\nThose are just a few things breathing down the neck of the manager of the New York Yankees.\n\nCalling it a tough job would be a major understatement. It even appears to take a physical toll — just look at the before and after photos of Joe Torre and Joe Girardi, who held the position before Aaron Boone took over in 2018.\n\nPressure like this exists nowhere else in baseball. Other teams tank for higher draft picks or trade their best players to retool, giving up today for a better tomorrow. In the Bronx, there is no such luxury. The Yankees must win every year — the fans demand it.\n\nTo the credit of owner Hal Steinbrenner, he does spend money bringing in some of the sport’s biggest names. But with great talent on the field also comes great expectations in the dugout — all while the manager is forced to explain his decisions to reporters twice a day while maintaining harmony between the clubhouse and the decision-makers in the front office.\n\nIn the biggest city in the U.S., being Yankees manager is a job nobody else can relate to.\n\nYou only need to look at the furore that followed recent defeats by Arsenal and Manchester City — and read The Athletic’s in-depth piece on the crisis happening behind the scenes — to understand the pressure that comes with managing Chelsea women. Sonia Bompastor has only lost three of her 37 Women’s Super League matches in charge of Chelsea since she was appointed in 2024, but there are still fans unhappy with the French manager.\n\nBompastor is a victim of her own success. Last season, she led Chelsea to an unbeaten domestic treble, and the expectations set by her predecessor and now-USWNT coach Emma Hayes, who won 16 trophies in her 12 years at the club. The standard at the club is unforgiving, and entertaining the idea of anything but total dominance is seen as a failure.\n\nThe only women’s club team with comparable expectations are Barcelona, where squad cohesion is helped by the fact that so many of the players are also longtime Spain team-mates. Bompastor has to integrate big-name signings from across the globe. Having such an array of talent is a blessing, but it leaves her with nowhere to hide.\n\nThe rest of the WSL are also narrowing the gap on Chelsea, whereas the only real threat to Barcelona’s dominance in Spain are Real Madrid, and even they have only beaten Barca once in 24 meetings.\n\nThe U.S. women’s national team’s win at the 1999 World Cup set a new bar and served as a catalyst not only for the women’s game domestically but around the world.\n\nThe head that wears the crown has always been heavy: until recently, the expectation of the USWNT was to not only win, but to annihilate opponents (think that 13-0 drubbing of Thailand at the start of their 2019 World Cup campaign). Head coach Emma Hayes will doubtless have found that out for herself since being appointed in 2023.\n\nIf anything, the job has become harder as the talent gap between the U.S. and every other nation has narrowed; they are No 2 in FIFA’s world rankings, trailing World Cup winners Spain.\n\nBalancing sustainable player development while still achieving results — yes, even in international friendlies — is a delicate balance to strike under the spotlight, and there may be no stage more daunting in women’s football than the USWNT.\n\nIt is beyond a joke, really. Just think of the Grampa Simpson meme showing him walking in and out, and that is Watford.\n\nThe second-tier side go through head coaches — it is ironic that they give them such a lofty title in the first place — quicker than you can say, \"another one bites the dust”.\n\nSince the Italian businessman Gino Pozzo bought the club in 2012, he has micro-managed his way through 23 incumbents of football's hottest seat. For context, there had been 34 in the club's 109-year history before then.\n\nOnly five coaches have lasted a whole campaign. Five seasons — including this one — have seen three different men in the dugout. In 2014-15 and 2019-20, there were four.\n\nIt appeared the hire-and-fire culture worked, as Watford spent six of seven seasons in the Premier League from 2015 to 2022. But they are not even a yo-yo club anymore. The string has snapped, the parachute payments from Premier League relegation have stopped, and that revolving door keeps on turning. Next!\n\nIt is a mistake to think of the Bayern Munich job as a coaching role — it is much more than that.\n\nThe starting point for the record 34-time German champions is that anything less than a domestic double of trophies each season is seen as performing below par, with every unconvincing performance — even in victory — subject to inquest.\n\nBut then there is the rapacious Bavarian and national media, for whom negativity about Bayern is big business, and a dressing room always loaded with forthright personalities and egos.\n\nThe club’s elders, Uli Hoeness and Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, present a separate challenge. Hoeness, the honorary president who played for Bayern from 1970 to 1979, rarely has an unspoken thought, especially about the standard of the team or the quality of coaching, meaning that plenty of scrutiny comes from inside the club, from seemingly unimpeachable figures.\n\nA Bayern coach needs tremendous presence, but also the humility to know their place at certain times and when to be deferential. That is a balance few have found in the club’s modern history.\n\nThe hardest coaching job is one where expectations are high, patience is low and, sometimes, the view is irrational. In the NBA, that means the jobs at two high-profile teams on each coast.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers head coach lives under constant strain. Pressure is intensely high for a fanbase (and ownership) used to winning. The Lakers have won 17 NBA titles, the second-most in league history. They are not used to losing. Even winning the NBA Cup (a feat with a nebulous value) is not enough. Darvin Ham was fired in 2024, the year after making the conference finals and hanging a Cup banner.\n\nThe Lakers have had 11 coaches in the last 25 years but only one has lasted more than three seasons in the job: Phil Jackson (from 1999-2004 and 2005-2011). Even Frank Vogel was fired in 2022, two years after winning a title.\n\nThe New York Knicks head coach feels the pressure, too. There have been 15 of them since 2000. But that franchise has not won an NBA championship in 53 years. The owner is demanding and impatient, and success is only success on the right terms.\n\nAfter two decades of ineptitude, Tom Thibodeau was fired last spring, despite leading the Knicks to their best finish in a quarter-century. Good luck to the new coach, and the one who replaces him.\n\nThere is an old cliche about the difficulty of coaching national teams in football. Clubs have big fanbases, sure, but they are splintered and spread around. When you manage a country, the number of people who think they can do a better job than you is roughly equal to the entire population.\n\nIn Brazil, that number is about 210million. Nearly all of them are obsessed with football. The older generations remember a time when the national team were the dominant force in the international game. The rest grew up hearing the tales and watching the videos — and many will still have seen one or two of the more recent World Cup wins (Brazil have lifted the game's most prestigious title a record five times). It is understandable that expectation often curdles into entitlement.\n\nWhat complicates things is a knot of competing dynamics. There are the zigzagging inferiority/superiority complexes when it comes to how Brazilian football compares to that played in Europe. There is the deathless debate around the compatibility — or otherwise — of winning and entertaining. There is also the fact that Brazil’s national self-image is so bound up with football.\n\nThe Brazil coach is not just picking 11 players and planning corner routines. He has to plot a course through all of that other stuff, all while loaded down by the weight of history. It is no great wonder most fail.\n\nNo NHL coaching job is quite like it.\n\nA longest-in-league-history championship drought means bringing the Stanley Cup to Toronto would all but guarantee instant legendary status and a statue outside the arena. The problem? That same historic drought — and all the failures along the way — have added to the pressure and noise in hockey’s largest market.\n\nCanada’s most populated city counts a fanbase that has only grown in the face of annual disappointment. The Maple Leafs, the NHL’s most valuable team, last won the Stanley Cup in 1967. There were just six teams in the league at the time. Today, there are 32.\n\nSince Punch Imlach led the Leafs to that last championship, 21 other coaches have tried — and ultimately failed — to satisfy a starved fanbase. Despite the billions of dollars invested over the years into the team’s expensive roster, facilities, resources and staff, the Leafs have never won more than two playoff rounds in a single season in that time.\n\nFrom 2005 to 2012, the Leafs did not even make the playoffs, adding to their sense of perennial heartbreak. Four coaches failed during that time. Two of them won the Stanley Cup elsewhere — giving weight to the notion that the Leafs might be cursed.\n\nWith 25 games remaining this season, the Leafs are in danger of missing the playoffs altogether for the first time in a decade. Craig Berube, a former Stanley Cup-winning coach who has been leading Toronto since 2024, is the latest person in the hot seat.\n\nPutting this season aside, the job of coaching one of Scotland’s big two could be naively regarded as a cakewalk. Historically, and certainly since the turn of the century, their budgets have dwarfed those of every other Scottish team. Your job, therefore, is to finish in front of the club over the road. Simple.\n\nBut in that respect, there is nowhere to hide. If you are Rangers and you wind up behind Celtic, you might as well have finished bottom. The same is true in reverse. To attend an Old Firm fixture, as the rivalry is known, is to understand the frenetic, vitriolic, passionate and sometimes poisonous world of football in Glasgow. It looks like easy street when it goes well. It is an untold nightmare if it goes badly.\n\nAnd, very often, the fate of a coach is wholly dictated by the structure around them and above them. Strain at boardroom level filters down onto the pitch, affecting resources and the quality of performances.\n\nYou have seen that at Rangers for more than a decade. You are seeing it at Celtic now. Yes, Wilfried Nancy was a disaster of an appointment, sacked after 33 days in charge last month — but when were Celtic last set up to fail as they seem to be at present? It made Nancy’s job a hospital pass, regardless of whether the former Columbus Crew coach was ever the right fit.\n\nWith regards to Glasgow, Vince Lombardi was bang on: there is no room for second place. It is sink or swim from a manager’s first morning in post — and rather them than me.\n\nThere is a phrase in Turkish football which roughly translates as “titles are won at the airport” — a reference to the big-name signings who are often greeted with frantic scenes when they get off the plane to finalise their deals.\n\nThe idea that new arrivals will inevitably mean success is an attitude shared by club presidents, too. The message to their coaches is “we’ve given you the stars, now win something”.\n\nWhich is part of the reason that coaching any of Istanbul’s big three clubs — Galatasaray, Fenerbahce and Besiktas — is almost an impossible job. Plenty of cultures think of football as a form of religion, but there are not many cities that do so with such chaotic intensity as Istanbul.\n\nGood luck to anyone in charge of any of them, but right now the biggest pressure is on Fenerbahce. Historically the most successful club in Turkey (they have won 28 Turkish titles to Galatasaray’s 26), they have not been champions since 2014, their longest-ever drought, and have had to watch Galatasaray demolish them for the last three seasons.\n\nThey are on their 11th different manager since that last success, and things are getting desperate: Jose Mourinho was sacked earlier this season and the man now in the hot seat is former Belgium manager Domenico Tedesco.\n\nKalen DeBoer took on maybe the greatest challenge in college football history two years ago by signing up to be the coach who replaced Nick Saban. Saban produced an unprecedented run of six national titles in 17 seasons at Alabama from 2007 to 2023.\n\nAlabama fans became accustomed to ruling the sport under Saban. But it has historically set the standard at national championship for its football program, long predating Saban. Before him, coach Bear Bryant won six national championships with the football team during the 1960s and 1970s and their excellence stretches back almost a century — with their 30 Southeastern Conference football championships by far the most in the history of the storied league.\n\nIn the early to mid-1900s, a time in the United States when elite Northeast universities and large institutions in the Midwest often ruled the sport, Alabama was a Southern powerhouse and source of pride for much of the state, though in-state rival Auburn also commands similar support. That Iron Bowl rivalry is yet another aspect that makes the Alabama job so difficult. An otherwise successful season can be severely damaged or even ruined by a loss to Auburn in the regular-season finale.\n\nThere is a saying that college football is like a religion in the Deep South, as much a part of a fan's identity as their faith. Bryant-Denny Stadium in Tuscaloosa, capacity 100,077, is among college football's largest and most hallowed cathedrals. Successful coaches at Alabama become legends. Coaches who fail to meet the lofty expectations, even respected alumni such as Ray Perkins, Mike DuBose and Mike Shula, are forever remembered for their shortcomings.\n\nIndia are international cricket’s sole powerhouse. Even if Australia, England, South Africa and New Zealand can compete in terms of the talent of their first team, India have a much deeper overall pool. The country has a total population of more than 1.4billion.\n\nGiven the perceived player advantage they possess, the coach faces immense scrutiny from all corners in a country that views the sport as a religion and its stars as gods. No sport rivals cricket’s status and no celebrities rival cricketers’ popularity in India.\n\nIndia wield immense financial firepower as a result and a considerable influence over cricket’s global body, the International Cricket Council. Jay Shah, the son of the nation’s home minister, is the council’s chairman.\n\nThose elements also make the coach’s job a fairly thankless one as India are expected to — and arguably should — beat every team they face.\n\nWhat do you think the hardest coaching job in world sport is?

    "fullText": "In this article, we’ll start with a basic example using std::mutex, look at its limitations, and then introduce std::shared_mutex, a reader-writer mutex added in C++17. Even in 2026, with many new concurrency features available, std::shared_mutex is still a valuable and practical tool.\n\nWe’ll begin with a small example (a standard “hello world” for this type of mutexes): a counter object that multiple threads can access:\n\nNothing scary so far, and this implementation is correct, thread-safe, and easy to understand.\n\nHowever, there’s a significant limitation: All access is exclusive.\n\nOnly one thread can call get() or increment() at any given time, even though get() does not modify the state.\n\nIn many real-world programs, shared data is read frequently and might be rarely updated/overriden.\n\nWith std::mutex, even multiple read-only operations block each other. This limits scalability and wastes available parallelism.\n\nHave a look at the following example:\n\nOn Compiler Explorer - see here https://godbolt.org/z/cdjrj8hGd - I’m getting the following output:\n\nNotice that some lines repeat the same value. That’s expected. The writer increments the counter every ~15 ms, but readers sample it every ~10 ms, so they can observe the same value more than once. Also, thread scheduling is not deterministic, so each reader may see a slightly different sequence.\n\nIn the demo code, there are many more reads than writes, so is the mutex the best solution here?\n\nstd::shared_mutex is a reader-writer mutex. It supports two locking modes:\n\nThis makes std::shared_mutex a good fit for read-mostly data structures.\n\nLet’s update the counter example:\n\nWith this change, many threads can call get() concurrently, writes remain fully protected, and read scalability improves with almost no extra complexity/\n\nOn Compiler Explorer - https://godbolt.org/z/W1es4qM8x - I’m getting:\n\nThe output is still nondeterministic, and it may look similar between std::mutex and std::shared_mutex. The key difference is not the values printed, but the fact that with std::shared_mutex multiple readers can hold the lock at the same time. This matters when the protected read section is non-trivial (parsing, lookups, copying data, etc.) and when the program is under real contention.\n\nOk, but let’s try to measure the gains to see the difference. I’ll add some extra sleep code to simulate a real “workload”, and then we can compare times.\n\nSee at Compiler Explorer. The output:\n\nOn this machine, std::thread::hardware_concurrency() reports 2 hardware threads. In this setup, the workload is intentionally read-heavy and each read holds the lock for a short but non-trivial amount of time. With std::mutex, all reads and writes use exclusive locking, so reader threads are effectively serialized and must wait for each other. As a result, the total runtime is about 285 ms.\n\nWith std::shared_mutex, read operations acquire a shared lock and can therefore run concurrently. On a system with two hardware threads, this allows two readers to make progress at the same time, significantly reducing contention. Under the same workload and timing parameters, the total runtime drops to about 102 ms. The exact numbers will vary between runs and platforms. Still, the difference clearly illustrates the main advantage of std::shared_mutex for read-mostly workloads: improved throughput when multiple readers can proceed in parallel.\n\nThe “counter” example is small, but the pattern becomes more useful with real data structures. A typical example is a cache.\n\nThis pattern appears often in real systems:\n\nUsing std::shared_mutex allows reads to scale while still keeping writes safe.\n\nA thread must not lock the same std::shared_mutex recursively:\n\nThis applies to both shared and exclusive ownership.\n\nIf upgrading is required, the locking strategy usually needs to change.\n\nstd::shared_mutex has overhead. If:\n\nthen std::mutex may be just as fast or even faster. Measuring is important.\n\nYou can read this recent article about some detailed measurements: When std::shared_mutex Outperforms std::mutex: A Google Benchmark Study – Tech For Talk\n\nSince C++17, the concurrency library has expanded significantly. We now have:\n\nThese tools focus mostly on thread lifetime, coordination, cancellation or lock-free programming.\n\nstd::shared_mutex fills a different role.\n\nIt is still a mutual-exclusion primitive, explicitly designed to protect a shared state with many readers and few writers. It does not compete with atomics, condition variables, or RCU.\n\nIn this article, we explored std::shared_mutex, a synchronization primitive designed for protecting read-mostly shared data. Unlike std::mutex, it allows multiple threads to read the same resource concurrently, while still ensuring exclusive access for writers.\n\nStarting from a simple counter example, we showed how a plain mutex serializes all access and how switching to std::shared_mutex enables concurrent reads with only small changes to the code. A simple benchmark experiment demonstrated that, under a read-heavy workload, this can significantly reduce contention and improve throughput.\n\nEven with newer concurrency features added in C++20 and later, std::shared_mutex remains a useful and practical tool when reads dominate writes and simplicity is preferred over more complex synchronization techniques.\n\nI've prepared a valuable bonus for you!\n\nLearn all major features of recent C++ Standards on my Reference Cards!\n\nCheck it out here:",

He also called for demonstrations in Los Angeles and Toronto. Police said in a post on X that the number of protesters reached some 250,000, more than the organizers had expected.\n\n“Change, change, regime change” the huge crowd chanted, waving green-white-and-red flags with lion and sun emblems. Iran used that flag before its 1979 Islamic Revolution that toppled the Pahlavi dynasty.\n\nAt a news conference, Pahlavi warned of more deaths in Iran if “democracies stand by and watch\" following Iran’s deadly crackdown on protesters last month.\n\n“We gather at an hour of profound peril to ask: Will the world stand with the people of Iran?” he asked. He added that the survival of Iran's government “sends a clear signal to every bully: kill enough people and you stay in power.”\n\nAn estimated 350,000 people marched on the streets of Toronto as part of the Global Day of Action Rally, Toronto Police spokesperson Laura Brabant said.\n\nAt the Munich rally, demonstrators sported “Make Iran Great Again\" red caps, mimicking the MAGA caps worn by U.S. President Donald Trump 's supporters. Among those sporting the caps was U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina who gave a speech to the crowd during which he was photographed holding up the headwear.\n\nMany at the rally waved placards showing Pahlavi, some that called him a king. The son of Iran’s deposed shah has been in exile for nearly 50 years but is trying to position himself as a player in Iran’s future.\n\nThe crowd chanted “Pahlavi for Iran,” and “democracy for Iran\" as drums and cymbals sounded.\n\n“We have huge hopes and (are) looking forward that the regime is going to change hopefully,” said Daniyal Mohtashamian, a demonstrator who traveled from Zurich, in Switzerland, to speak for protesters inside Iran who faced repression.\n\n“There is an internet blackout, and their voices are not going outside of Iran,” he said.\n\nAbout 500 protesters also rallied outside the presidential palace in Nicosia, Cyprus, with many holding up banners with slogans against Iran's government and in favor of Pahlavi.\n\nThe U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency says at least 7,005 people were killed in last month's protests, including 214 government forces. It has been accurate in counting deaths during previous rounds of unrest in Iran and relies on a network of activists inside Iran to verify deaths.\n\nIran’s government offered its only death toll on Jan. 21, saying 3,117 people were killed. Iran’s theocracy in the past has undercounted or not reported fatalities from past unrest.\n\nThe Associated Press has been unable to independently assess the death toll, given authorities have disrupted internet access and international calls in Iran.\n\nIranian leaders are facing renewed pressure from Trump, who has threatened U.S. military action. Trump wants Iran to further scale back its nuclear program. He suggested Friday that regime change in Iran “would be the best thing that could happen.\"\n\nIran was also the focus of protests in Munich on Friday, the opening day of an annual security conference in the city gathering European leaders and global security figures. Supporters of the Iranian opposition group People’s Mujahedeen Organization of Iran, also known as the Mujahedeen-e-Khalq, demonstrated.",

    "description": "After living abroad as a Peace Corps volunteer in Ecuador, Kat Smith knew she needed to live around the world. Her life would never be the same.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Kat Smith, 35, who has lived abroad since 2015. Smith, the founder of Away Abroad, a website for female travelers, currently lives in Trieste, Italy, with her husband. This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI think people don't always believe me when I say it, but living abroad has always felt more fun to me. I love the cultural challenges, the language barrier, the different food, and the process of figuring out the day-to-day.\n\nI'm originally from Conyers, a small town just outside Atlanta. In high school, I moved to Athens, Georgia. It was a typical small, suburban place — there weren't many people traveling internationally. Certainly, no one was moving abroad the way I eventually did.\n\nWhen I was 18, between graduating from high school and starting at the University of Georgia, my parents basically forced a gap semester on me. They came home from a dinner party one night and were like, \"Instead of going to college, you're going to Guatemala.\"\n\nI did not want to go, but hindsight is 20/20.\n\nGoing to Guatemala was the best thing that could have happened to me. While I was there, I met a Peace Corps volunteer. Spending time with them and being in the country changed my perception of the world and opened my eyes to what was even possible.\n\nWhen I got back and started university, I met with an advisor who had also served in the Peace Corps. After talking with him more, it just felt like the right path for me.\n\nIn 2013, almost exactly a month after I graduated from university, I joined the Peace Corps and left the US for Ecuador.\n\nAt the time I applied, you didn't really have much say in where you went. I basically said, \"Send me anywhere in the world,\" and they sent me to Ecuador. During training, they placed me in a community based on my skill set and the community's needs.\n\nI ended up in Tumbaco for 3 months for training and then in Arenillas, a really small town in the southwestern province of El Oro, where I lived for about two years.\n\nWhen my service ended, a friend of mine and I hitchhiked through the Peruvian Amazon and ended up working at an eco-lodge in the middle of the rainforest for a few months.\n\nAround that time, in 2015, my dad was like, \"Okay, you haven't been home in almost three years. I'm buying you a ticket—you're coming to visit.\" So, begrudgingly, I went back to the US.\n\nI remember feeling reverse culture shock more intensely than I ever felt culture shock. It completely caught me off guard. All of a sudden, the US didn't feel like home anymore. I felt like I didn't fit in.\n\nI also knew I wasn't the same person I'd been when I'd left, which created an internal conflict. I don't want to be that dramatic, but I had a different mindset, and trying to be the old me was hard.\n\nOver the years, I've lived in Panama City, been to Colombia, worked on a yacht in the South of France, and backpacked through Eastern Europe for a couple of months. I also backpacked between Vietnam and Thailand, and taught English in South Korea.\n\nSomewhere in the middle of all of that, I fell in love and got married in Colombia in 2018. Not long after, my husband and I moved to Vietnam, where we stayed for three years while I was teaching English, before leaving in 2021 because of COVID restrictions.\n\nAfter Vietnam, we went back to the US for a while. We bought a van, converted it, and traveled up and down the West Coast. I loved nature, but after a few months, I was ready to leave again.\n\nSo we tried Albania next. We stayed for a couple of months, but it didn't feel like the right long-term fit. Instead, we kept moving and spent time around the Balkans — traveling through Montenegro, Serbia, Bosnia, and Croatia.\n\nLooking back, I've made a few mistakes along the way.\n\nOne of the things I cringe about most is how I treated my friends and family back home. I was pretty insensitive about their choices — friends who just wanted to graduate, buy a house 10 minutes from where they grew up, and settle into a typical, structured, no-surprises kind of life. I think I judged that because I felt like what I was doing was so extravagant.\n\nBut honestly, I was a bit of a brat about accepting other people's paths.\n\nI did something similar with my family, too. I didn't really consider what it meant for them when I left. I was so focused on what it meant for me, and not necessarily on how it was affecting everyone around me.\n\nIn 2023, we moved to Italy for a job opportunity for my husband. He has an EU Blue Card — basically a work permit for skilled workers — and I'm on a family reunification visa linked to his.\n\nWe've been living in Trieste for the past 2.5 years. Trieste is fantastic, but it's also an up-and-coming city that's gotten really expensive, fast. Even in the short time we've been here, we've seen a big jump in costs. Our rent, for example, increased by $308 a month, which still feels crazy.\n\nOur apartment is really nice: one bedroom, one bath, open floor plan, and close to everything. I'm really into nature, and we have a beautiful view of the sea and the hills. We were paying $1,423 a month, and now it's $1,732.\n\nThat rising cost of living is one of the reasons we started looking at other places — just to get more for our money.\n\nWe ended up buying an apartment in Belluno for $260,955, and we'll move in April. Belluno is a much smaller town, kind of a gateway to the Dolomites, and it sits north of Venice. We're big mountain people, and the Dolomites are genuinely my happy place. Being closer to them means we can hike and snowboard more regularly without a long drive, which was a huge perk for us.\n\nAlthough we didn't choose Italy initially and only moved here for my husband's job, there are a lot of reasons we've chosen to stay rather than move on like we typically do after a few years.\n\nItaly has a strategic geographic position. I love living smack dab in the middle of the world. Not only is this exciting adventure-wise, but it's also meant more people have been able to visit us, including our parents, who aren't as keen on the long-haul flights.\n\nOn top of that, the culture clicks for both of us. As an intercultural couple, we have different triggers, things we look for, and things we want to avoid. Northern Italy has provided the perfect balance for us.\n\nI really hope Italy can be our home base, at least for the foreseeable future. But I also know myself: If, two years from now, it doesn't feel right, we'll pivot. I'm not setting a deadline; it's more about whether it still feels like home. And right now, it does.",

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Esther Perel, a renowned couples therapist, bestselling author, and podcast host. Perel lives in New York City and travels the world for speaking engagements. This story has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI have been interested in psychology since I was about 14. I wanted to understand myself, my family, and my surroundings. So, becoming a therapist was quite an obvious choice for me.\n\nI started working with large groups, then moved to families, then couples. In particular, I was interested in interracial, intercultural, inter-religious couples and families — families in cultural transition. What is sexuality in the culture, and how does it enter into the family culture and the couple's relationship?\n\nI spent 35 years in my therapy office, alone. At one point, I started to feel that the office was getting small. Therapy is not democratic; it's not accessible to many people who need it.\n\nI wrote \"Mating in Captivity\" (2006) and \"The State of Affairs\" (2017). Then, I started bringing people into the sessions, and that's the podcast. \"Where Should We Begin?\" was doing live anonymous couples therapy sessions at scale, all over the world, for free.\n\nIt's not therapy, but a way to bring the insights that happen in the office into the public square. Then I decided to step out of the office myself and go onstage to recreate the experience at scale with thousands of people.\n\nI created a card game during the pandemic because I wanted to give people something playful that helps them connect. I recorded courses on conflict and desire because for every book I wrote, people would then say, \"And then what do I do?\"\n\nRight now, I am working on a new tour and a few other projects that I'm keeping to myself until they happen. Although I live primarily in New York and spend a few months a year in Europe, I travel in bursts, and always with either a family member or friend. I mix pleasure and purpose, work and personal. I'm going on an adventure with someone.\n\nI still have a therapy practice, one or two days a week. I've never stopped because I think it's very important to keep close to the craft, and not just to become a storyteller.\n\nI get up around 7 to 7:30 a.m. As soon as I wake up, I need to move to feel calm. It's a bit of a paradox.\n\nI do yoga four times a week. I'm part of a group of friends who started practicing together during the pandemic. For six years, we've never missed a class. We do it in person and on Zoom, so wherever one is, one can join. It's very grounding and strengthening.\n\nA bunch of us in the group happen to be teachers. I became one by default — I've never been trained as one, but I know how to repeat what my teachers have said to me.\n\nOn other days, I exercise, also with a friend. It motivates me and makes me accountable. Alone, I would be a lazy bum. I'd be getting ready, then spend the day futzing around and never get there.\n\nI very rarely get a coffee outside. I like to make it, sit down, and look at who texted me in the middle of the night, since people in my life are in different time zones. Who am I waking up to this morning?\n\nFor breakfast, I eat grapefruit, yogurt, and berries, and on occasion, eggs.\n\nI don't start work before 10 a.m. so that I have time to do what I like to do in the morning. I work partly at home and partly at Magnificent Noise's podcast studio.\n\nMy work days are nicely segmented:\n\nI try to create a focus for the day so that I don't have to see patients and go to meetings when I'm in clinical mode. Still, I sometimes have to switch modes in such drastic ways that it's a bit jarring.\n\nIt's a lot to juggle. I have an amazing team of people that I work with, who are very knowledgeable about the different things that I do. I cannot do any of this alone.\n\nWhen I was exclusively working as a clinician, I often would say, \"I miss working with others.\" Now, I'm never just doing one thing. It's a very rich day, which I really missed back then.\n\nMuch changed after the pandemic. I don't have a practice office anymore. I practice from my home or go to other people's offices.\n\nSometimes, we meet outside, and we walk.\n\nIt's fantastic. When you're in motion, you experience your thoughts differently, and you respond differently to the person talking to you. You're not face-to-face; you're side-by-side, so the parallel position gives you a whole other interaction.\n\nSometimes, we stop, we sit down. We continue the session by the river. There's water floating by. That too is very calming. There's this intersection between beauty and calmness and motion and the depth of what you are reflecting upon at the same time.\n\nWhat I like about clinical work is that every human being is a whole universe opening up to you. It's an endless exploration. The psyche, the mind, the body, the painful and the joyful, the breaches and the connection, the people who suffered from too much attention, and the people who suffered from too little. I can't think of a subject that would be more diverse in its interests.\n\nI don't always take a lunch break. In general, I prefer to end the day earlier.\n\nI have very few routines when it comes to food. Most of my meals are home-cooked. I eat lots of nuts and fruit. I'm a major bread-and-cheese person, and sometimes a slice of both is a good lunch, too.\n\nToday, I cooked up a bunch of different vegetables. I made some chicken so it would last for two or three days. I am a big soup maker in the winter, and I like salads in the summer.\n\nI usually stop working around 5 p.m.\n\nI love movies. I love theater. I go with friends into the world to see art — paintings and performances. Probably, I'm at a theater two or three times a week. I saw the Broadway production of \"Oedipus\" twice. I just thought it was pertinent, current, exquisitely well-acted, beautifully written.\n\nI socialize, too. Meeting people for dinner, inviting them over. When I spend so much time on a screen, I like to see people in real life.\n\nI'm in a movie and book club as well.\n\nWe recently read \"Train Dreams\" by Denis Johnson. We've read Roberto Bolaño, Rachel Cusk. We're reading Muriel Spark for next month.\n\nFor the movie club, we just discussed \"The Worst Person in the World\" — I had just seen \"Sentimental Value\" by the same director, Joachim Trier. We've done the movie club every three weeks for the past six years — that's a lot of movies with a great group of people who have a lot to say.\n\nPlus, you have your homework, and you're not just going to read articles and social stuff. These little structured pieces of my life that actually invite real exploration and connection.\n\nAt night, I talk to my husband. I also go to look at the messages that I didn't catch for the day. I often spend the last half hour or hour on my phone. It's not the best. I sit on the couch, and I look at my calendar for tomorrow and who I'm meant to connect with.\n\nI rarely scroll through social media. I'm in a few different WhatsApp groups, so I see what's happening in my social world. That's how I unwind.\n\nI'm quite relational. Fundamentally, if I want to do something, I instantly think, \"Who do I want to do this with?\" Then, I organize the activity with that sociability. They are completely intertwined.",

    "fullText": "FRANKFURT, Feb 14 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank unveiled plans on Saturday to widen access to its euro liquidity backstop, making it globally available and permanent in a bid to bolster the international role of the single currency.\n\nAccess to such repo lines, a crucial source of funding during times of market stress, has been limited to just a handful of mostly Eastern European countries but ECB President Christine Lagarde has long seen the facility as a tool to boost the euro’s global reach.\n\n\"The ECB needs to be prepared for a more volatile environment,\" Lagarde said at the Munich Security Conference, the first time an ECB chief spoke at the event.\n\n\"We must avoid a situation where that stress triggers fire sales of euro-denominated securities in global funding markets, which could hamper the transmission of our monetary policy,\" she said in announcing the new facility.\n\nThe facility, to be available from the third quarter of 2026, will be open to all central banks around the world, provided they are not excluded for reputational reasons, such as money laundering, terrorist financing or international sanctions, the ECB said.\n\n\"This facility also reinforces the role of the euro,\" Lagarde said. \"The availability of a lender of last resort for central banks worldwide boosts confidence to invest, borrow and trade in euros, knowing that access will be there during market disruptions.\"\n\nUsed when banks are unable to obtain funding on the market, the repo line allows lenders to borrow euros from the ECB against high-quality collateral, to be repaid at maturity along with interest.\n\nUnlike previous lines, which had to be extended from time to time, the new facility will provide standing access for up to 50 billion euros.\n\nWith investors reassessing the dollar’s status due to the unpredictable nature of U.S. President Donald Trump’s economic policy, Lagarde has argued this was the time for the euro to gain market share, but this required a revamped financial and economic architecture.\n\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve maintains a similar tool, called the FIMA Repo Facility, which essentially protects the Treasury market since stress might otherwise force lenders to sell government bonds below market value.\n\n\"These changes aim to make the facility more flexible, broader in terms of its geographical reach and more relevant for global holders of euro securities,\" the ECB said in a statement.\n\nSuch a guaranteed access to euros could naturally increase demand for euro-denominated assets and encourage banks outside the 21-nation euro zone to buy assets from the bloc.\n\nFor a factbox on the details of the new repo facility, click here.",

    "fullText": "The cancellation of the official House delegation to the annual Munich Security Conference has drawn pushback from Democrats who still plan to attend, even as it’s upended a decades-long tradition of robust bipartisan participation in the high-profile global policy forum.\n\nA House leadership aide told The Hill that cancelling congressional delegations (CODEL) is standard operating procedure during the shutdown of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).\n\nBut House Democrats have sharply criticized Republicans for the cancellation, arguing that attending the conference is critical to restoring the United States’ standing with allies amid the Trump administration’s aggressive foreign policy approach.\n\n“Because of the Republican shutdown of the Department of Homeland Security, because Republicans refuse to make any compromises or any changes to ICE after the deadly murders of Alex Pretti and Renee Good, we have a shutdown, and therefore, we cannot go on official CODELS. I’ve decided, along with a number of my Democratic colleagues, to go anyway,” Rep. Yassamin Ansari (D-Ariz.) said in a video statement on Thursday.\n\nAnsari said she wants to make clear that Trump “does not define the United States, that we are committed to our allies, to NATO, to U.S. credibility and leadership around the world.”\n\nRep. Jason Crow (D-Colo.), who also attended the conference, told NBC News on Friday that Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) had ordered the hotel reservations, military flights and credentials lawmakers had for the conference to be cancelled.\n\nCrow called it the “wrong move,” NBC reported, saying that U.S. officials other than Secretary of State Marco Rubio need to be present at the event.\n\nWhile lawmakers aren’t prohibited from going and House Democrats are still widely planning to attend the conference on their own dime, it is unclear whether any House Republicans will be present. Unlike Johnson’s move to cancel the delegation, several bipartisan Senate delegations will still be attending the conference.\n\nFormer Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) will be attending in her “personal capacity” as a member of the Munich Security Conference Advisory Council, her spokesperson Ian Krager told The Hill in a statement.\n\n“Her presence reflects decades of leadership on transatlantic collaboration and underscores the importance of sustained U.S. partners at a moment of profound geopolitical uncertainty,” Krager said. “Speaker Pelosi remains committed to strengthening partnerships that advance collective security, economic prosperity and democratic governance.”\n\nSome of the other House Democrats present at the conference include Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), Jim Himes (D-Conn.) and Sarah McBride (D-Del.).\n\n“Some of us are going over anyway on our own dime to reassure and thank our allies,” Himes, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, had posted on X.\n\nOcasio-Cortez used a panel discussion at the conference on Friday to prop up the working class and accuse Trump of tearing “apart the transatlantic partnership.”\n\n“One of the reasons why not just myself, but … many Democrats that are here as well, is because we want to tell a larger story, that what is happening is indeed very grave, and we are in a new era, domestically and globally,” Ocasio-Cortez said on the panel, when asked about the significance of her representing the U.S. at the conference.\n\nRep. Joe Wilson (R-S.C.), a senior member on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, told Politico that it’s a “shame” lawmakers could miss the key conference.\n\nHowever, he added that: “It’s a very responsible position by the Speaker which matches the irresponsibility of the Senate Democrats to shut down the government. And so the responsible act is to be ever available to end the shutdown.”\n\nThe White House and Democrats have been at an impasse over a deal to fund DHS. A stopgap measure that temporarily funds the department for two weeks expired on Feb. 13.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) have been demanding sweeping reforms to the White House’s immigration tactics, including an overhaul of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, after agents fatally shot two U.S. citizens in Minnesota. While the White House sent a counterproposal to Democrats on their DHS demands, the minority leaders have argued that the offer falls short.\n\nThe Senate left Washington on Thursday without reaching a deal and DHS shut down at midnight.",

It's one of the bigger events on the LET and it's kind of a like a home event for me.\"\n\nHull started the day three shots off the lead and made the turn in two under for the day.\n\nShe dropped a second shot of the round on the 10th, but picked up four in the next three holes, with her charge including a 60-foot eagle putt on the par-five 12th.\n\nFurther birdies followed at the par-five 15th and 18th, putting the onus on her rivals to match her.\n\nIwai, who had moved into a share of the lead with a golden touch on the greens, bogeyed the 17th with a damaging three-putt that left her two shots back.\n\nAnd, after Alexander also bogeyed the penultimate hole, Hull was finally able to celebrate, even after Iwai birdied the last for a 67.\n\nMeanwhile, 24-year-old Rhodes kicked off her campaign to make September's Solheim Cup team with a superb final round that included six birdies and just one dropped shot.",

    "fullText": "T20 World Cup, Group C, Kolkata\n\nScotland 152 (19.4 overs): Berrington 49 (32); Rashid 3-36, Archer 2-23\n\nEngland 155-5 (18.2 overs): Banton 63 (41), Bethell 32 (28); Davidson 1-12\n\nEngland had another wobble but got their T20 World Cup campaign back on track with a five-wicket victory over Scotland in Kolkata - a result that leaves the Scots on the brink of a group-stage exit.\n\nAfter dismissing Scotland for 152 on a good batting pitch, England lost Phil Salt and Jos Buttler in the first two overs and were 86-4 when Harry Brook was caught for four.\n\nDefeat would have had England facing a humiliating early exit but Tom Banton fought his way through the tension to play the most important innings of his international career to date and secure victory with 10 balls to spare.\n\nHe broke the shackles by hitting spinner Mark Watt for consecutive sixes and finished 63 not out around contributions of 32 from Jacob Bethell and 28 by Sam Curran.\n\nScotland's application with the ball and in the field was admirable. They were ultimately punished for not taking advantage of the platform set by captain Richie Berrington's 49, which had his side 113-3 in the 13th over.\n\nAdil Rashid overcame an expensive start to finish with 3-36 for England, while an improved Jofra Archer took two wickets in the powerplay and finished with 2-23.\n\nIt means England will confirm their place in the Super 8s by beating Italy on Monday.\n\nScotland play Nepal in their final group match on Tuesday but may have been eliminated by other results by then.\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport\n\nHaving been lucky to escape against Nepal and been convincingly beaten by West Indies, England are still searching for a complete performance at this World Cup.\n\nThey have won World Cups before despite group-stage defeats but improvement is needed if they are to threaten the best in this tournament.\n\nScotland's opening bowling consisted of Brandon McMullen and Brad Currie's medium pace. They found far more movement than England's bowlers and Salt and Buttler sliced catches to the off-side ring for two and three respectively.\n\nThere were no boundaries off the bat in the first four overs.\n\nBethell brought some calm with his patient knock but England were ultimately grateful to Banton who had not lived up to his talents in his previous 36 internationals.\n\nUnlike Bethell, who was caught trying to help a scoop over short fine leg, and Brook - dismissed in the same fashion - Banton played straight and as a result looked more comfortable than any other batter.\n\nHe took only six from his first 10 deliveries and did not hit a boundary until his 11th.\n\nCurran hit two sixes to accelerate England towards the finish line and Will Jacks hit the winning runs, but it was Banton who delivered when England needed him most.\n\nThough Scotland's score always looked 20 runs below par, England were troubled at one stage.\n\nThey took three wickets in the powerplay, including Archer having the dangerous George Munsey and number three Brandon McMullen miscuing pulls in a lively opening spell of three overs, but Berrington countered impressively.\n\nBerrington, a good player of slow bowling, was particularly aggressive against England's spinners. He hit Rashid for two fours and a six in his second over and was the aggressor in a partnership of 71 with Tom Bruce.\n\nAt 113-3 in the 13th over, 190 was Scotland's target. Instead, the wicket of Bruce resulted in the innings sliding away.\n\nHe slog-swept Liam Dawson to deep square leg for 24 - one of six batters to wastefully pick out fielders in the deep.\n\nIn the next over Rashid pinned the sweeping Berrington in front as England's leg-spinner, having gone wicketless for 26 runs in his first two overs, took 3-10 in his second spell.\n\nDawson, who took 2-34, added the wicket of Michael Leask, also caught in the deep.\n\nScotland's collapse 5-14 in 3.3 overs ultimately denied them the 30 runs that could have kept them alive in this tournament.",

    "fullText": "Men's T20 World Cup, Group D, Ahmedabad\n\nNew Zealand 175-7 (20 overs): Chapman 48 (26); Jansen 4-40\n\nSouth Africa 178-3 (17.1 overs): Markram 86* (44), Miller 24* (17)\n\nSouth Africa won by seven wickets\n\nAiden Markram scored a blistering unbeaten 86 as South Africa raced to a seven-wicket win over New Zealand to maintain their 100% record at the T20 World Cup.\n\nSet 176, the Proteas surged to 83-1 after the powerplay as their captain, assisted by Quinton de Kock and Ryan Rickelton, brutally took down the Black Caps bowlers.\n\nMarkram brought up his half century from 19 balls - the joint-fastest of the tournament - with a straight six and with just seven overs of the chase gone, the outcome was never in doubt.\n\nNew Zealand managed to slow the run-rate but it was much too late and South Africa got over the line with 17 deliveries to spare, Markram finishing with eight fours and four sixes in his 44-ball knock.\n\nVictory puts the Proteas on the brink of qualification for the Super 8s and New Zealand still highly likely to join them if they beat Canada in their final Group D game.\n\nBlack Caps openers Finn Allen and Tim Seifert had come out swinging after their side batted first.\n\nAllen hit four fours and two sixes for his 17-ball 31 before Marco Jansen (4-40) crucially took three wickets in quick succession to bring South Africa back into the game.\n\nThe seamer sent back Seifert for 13 in his first over before dismissing Rachin Ravindra and Allen in the space of four balls in the final over of the powerplay.\n\nMark Chapman and Daryl Mitchell rebuilt the innings and New Zealand were scoring at around 10-an-over for more than half the innings.\n\nThey were 138-5 when Chapman fell to the last ball of the 14th over, having made 48 from 26 balls, with their opponents able to drag it back from there and restrict New Zealand to 175-7.\n\nIt appeared short at the halfway stage and within a few balls of the reply, that was confirmed.\n\nMarkram and De Kock got after opening bowlers Matt Henry and Lockie Ferguson from the off, then gave Jacob Duffy the same treatment when he came on.\n\nFerguson bowled De Kock with a slower ball but there was no slowing the Proteas as Markram continued his charge, first alongside Rickelton then Dewald Brevis, who both made 21.\n\nMarkram was able to watch from the non-striker's end as David Miller finished the job in style - launching Ferguson into the stands for a monstrous six.\n\nSouth Africa will official qualify for the Super 8s if the United Arab Emirates fail to beat Afghanistan on Monday.\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "fullText": "Manchester United have recovered the services of Harry Maguire, who resumed training following a brief injury scare.\n\nThe England international has been a mainstay at the back since recovering from the thigh issue that kept him on the sidelines for more than a month.\n\nHis return to action coincided with the appointment of Michael Carrick, who immediately fielded him as a regular starter alongside Lisandro Martinez.\n\nThe duo started at the back in the 44-year-old first five games in charge, producing brilliant displays on most occasions. Maguire, in particular, has been hailed for his ‘colossal’ outing in the 3-2 victory over Arsenal last month.\n\nHowever, fans feared that the Sheffield native’s momentum may have been interrupted by a new physical problem, as he was forced to leave the pitch in the 68th minute against West Ham United.\n\nAfter the midweek contest at the London Stadium, Maguire provided a positive update on his condition, telling members of the media that he’s feeling ‘alright’.\n\nThis initial relief has now been confirmed, as the big centre half was spotted training alongside his teammates on Saturday.\n\nThe official Man Utd X account posted videos of the morning session at Carrington, and Maguire could be clearly seen joining training from the get-go, putting all injury fears to bed.\n\nDue to their premature FA Cup exit, United will have an idle weekend, while the majority of other Premier League clubs will take part in the 4th round.\n\nCarrick’s men won’t play until February 23, when they host Everton for a Premier League contest at Old Trafford.\n\nHarry Maguire smiles while warming up for Man United at Old Trafford before kick-off. (Photo by Carl Recine/Getty Images)\n\nTherefore, this extended break will allow Maguire and others to fully recover their powers before the next one.\n\nCarrick had also revealed that Mason Mount is expected to be back for the clash against the Toffees. Matthijs de Ligt remains slightly behind the English midfielder in his rehabilitation process, but he’s also hoping to be fit enough for a call-up.",

    "description": "Sri Lanka braced itself for massive losses after Pakistan’s boycott calls, but now awaits a thrilling clash on Sunday.",
    "fullText": "Colombo, Sri Lanka — Almost 30 years ago today, India and Pakistan formed a combined cricket team to take on Sri Lanka ahead of the 1996 Cricket World Cup in an unprecedented moment of unity in the sport’s history.\n\nThe two age-old rivals put aside their differences and came together in an act of solidarity to support a fellow South Asian team, who faced the threat of match boycotts in a tournament they had battled hard to host.\n\nIndia versus Pakistan is the most highly marketed fixture at every multination tournament – the World Cup, Asia Cup or Asian Games – whether it’s a men’s, women’s or Under-19 event.\n\nFew sporting events globally carry the weight and anticipation of an India-Pakistan cricket match. So, when Pakistan’s government ordered its team not to face India at the ongoing T20 World Cup, the tournament was briefly pushed into a state of chaos.\n\nIt also left Sri Lanka, the designated host of the fixture, holding its collective breath.\n\nA week of negotiations led to a dramatic late U-turn by the Pakistani government and the match will now take place as scheduled on Sunday at the R Premadasa International Cricket Stadium in Colombo.\n\nBut what if the boycott had gone ahead? The impact could have been catastrophic, not just for Pakistan, but also for the International Cricket Council (ICC), as well as Sri Lanka.\n\nWith the crisis seemingly averted, the island nation stands poised to reap the benefits in its financial landscape, diplomatic standing and community.\n\nFor a country that is still grappling with the aftermath of the economic crisis of 2022, an India-Pakistan cricket fixture at a World Cup could prove to be a godsend.\n\nThe tourism and hospitality industry was one of the hardest hit during Sri Lanka’s financial meltdown and this match will see an enormous influx of fans from India and Pakistan coming into the country.\n\nHotels in and around Colombo were fully booked out well ahead of the tournament but the industry braced itself for heavy losses after Pakistan threatened a boycott.\n\n“There’s been a massive impact since the boycott was announced,” Sudarshana Pieris, who works in Sri Lanka’s hospitality sector, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“All major hotels in Colombo were fully booked by Indian travel agencies well ahead [of the match] and once the boycott was announced, we lost almost all of those bookings,” he said.\n\n“But after Pakistan reversed their decision, hotel room rates shot up by about 300-400 percent at five-star establishments in Colombo.”\n\nIt’s not just hotels but several other local businesses – from street vendors to high-end restaurants – who are hoping for an increased footfall and spending over the weekend.\n\nThese short trips and the experiences they offer could influence visitors to extend their stay or return to Sri Lanka on holiday, long after the game has ended, in a potential long-term benefit to the industry.\n\nAnother relatively underestimated impact of the game would be the employment opportunities it creates, albeit temporarily, in the media, event management, security and transportation industries.\n\nAsanka Hadirampela, a freelance journalist and broadcaster currently working as a Sinhala language commentator for the World Cup, recognises the marquee match as a great opportunity from a personal standpoint.\n\n“This is my first World Cup as a broadcaster,” Hadirampela said.\n\n“The India-Pakistan fixture is the biggest and most-watched game of the tournament. So to get to work on such a match is exciting and I consider it a special achievement.”\n\nThe lines are always blurred between sport and politics in South Asia.\n\nSo while the financial gains are expected to be significant, the fixture’s impact on the region’s geopolitical environment cannot go amiss.\n\nPakistan’s boycott, too, was explicitly political, as confirmed by the country’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif when he said that they were offering support to Bangladesh after the Tigers were kicked out of the tournament by the ICC.\n\nThe reversal of Pakistan’s decision, which they said came after requests to reconsider the boycott by several regional “friends”, was steeped in politics, too.\n\nSri Lanka’s President Anura Kumara Dissanayake reportedly had a phone conversation with PM Sharif, urging his government to rethink their decision to boycott the game as the successful staging of this encounter would not only position Sri Lanka as a capable host of global sporting events but also reinforce its standing as a neutral mediator in a region fraught with geopolitical complexities.\n\nSri Lanka and Pakistan have always maintained strong diplomatic relations, which have extended to the cricket field as well.\n\nSri Lanka were one of the first teams to travel to Pakistan following their 10-year ostracisation from international cricket, which came as a result of a terrorist attack targeting the Sri Lankan team in March 2009.\n\nWhen Al Jazeera reached out to Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC), its vice president Ravin Wickramaratne confirmed that SLC did, indeed, reach out to the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) after the boycott was announced.\n\n“We asked them to reconsider the decision,” Wickramaratne said.\n\n“It [boycott] would have impacted Sri Lanka economically, whether directly or indirectly.\n\n“We have always had a good relationship with the PCB and we have always supported them, so we’re happy with their decision.”\n\nA little over 24 hours ahead of the match in Colombo, there is a sense of palpable excitement and a growing buzz around the fixture as it returns from the brink of cancellation.\n\nAs of Saturday morning, 28,000 tickets had been sold for the game but local organisers expect a capacity crowd of 40,000 to make it into the stands.\n\nCome Sunday, thousands more will line the streets in and around Maligawatte, the bustling Colombo suburb that houses the famous Premadasa Stadium.",

    "fullText": "Men's T20 World Cup, Group B, Colombo\n\nIreland 235-5 (20 overs): Tucker 94* (51); Ahmed 3-33\n\nOman 139 all out (18 overs): Kaleem 50 (29); Little 3-16\n\nStand-in captain Lorcan Tucker hit an unbeaten 94 to lead Ireland to a 96-run win over Oman at the T20 World Cup.\n\nHaving lost their opening games against Sri Lanka and Australia, Ireland needed both victory and a boost to their net run-rate to have any hopes of progression.\n\nWhat was to be a first win at the tournament since beating England in 2022 looked in doubt when Tucker came to the crease with his side 25-2, but the wicketkeeper equalled his highest score in the format to power Ireland to 235-5 by the end of their innings.\n\nDespite Aamir Kaleem providing a half-century, Oman wickets fell quickly with Josh Little leading the way for Ireland's bowlers with three wickets for 16 runs.\n\nIreland play Zimbabwe on Tuesday (09:30 GMT) still needing a win and other results to go their way if they are to make the Super 8s.\n\nBrilliant Muzarabani helps Zimbabwe stun Australia\n\nWhile Tucker filled in for the injured Paul Stirling as captain, it was Tim Tector who opened the batting in place of the Belfast man.\n\nIreland's struggles for a top-order partnership, however, continued with Shakeel Ahmed doing the damage.\n\nThe 38-year-old, celebrating wickets in the style of Portugal footballer Cristiano Ronaldo, accounted for Tim Tector (5), Ross Adair (14) and Harry Tector (14) during the powerplay with Ireland reeling somewhat on 47-3 after six overs.\n\nWith Curtis Campher, who provided 12 off seven balls, not sticking around either, it was up to all-rounder Gareth Delany to team up with Tucker and give Ireland's innings some much needed momentum.\n\nThe pair's 101-run partnership off 56 balls took Ireland from what was a shaky start to a position that would lead to their highest ever T20 international total.\n\nWhile there were seven boundaries among Delany's 56 off 30 balls, it was Tucker's efforts that were to provide the headline act.\n\nAn inventive knock that featured 10 fours and four sixes, the only scare came when, with Ireland 67-4, Vinayak Shukla appeared to have him stumped only for the third umpire to judge that Oman's wicketkeeper had dislodged the bails without the ball in his hand.\n\nTucker certainly made the most of the reprieve, pressing on for what is the best knock of the tournament so far, eclipsing Tim Seifert's 89 against UAE for New Zealand.\n\nHe would end the innings frustratingly stranded at the non-striker's end, denied the chance for what would have been a first T20 century as George Dockrell, who plundered 35 from nine balls, faced the final three deliveries.\n\nIf 93 runs in the final five overs of Ireland's innings had appeared to leave the result a formality, Heinrich Malan's side will have had improving their net run-rate on the mind too.\n\nOman were 63-2 after the powerplay, and brought up their 100 in the 11th over, both ahead of the pace set by Ireland, but wickets feel too cheaply to ever bring such a target into realistic focus.\n\nAamir Kaleem led the way with the 44-year-old becoming the oldest player in T20 World Cup history to make a half-century, reaching his fifty in 28 deliveries to break the record set by team-mate Muhammad Nadeem against Sri Lanka only on Thursday.\n\nMost encouraging for Ireland's bowlers was the performance of Josh Little.\n\nThe seamer, who had been without a wicket in his past four T20 internationals, finished with figures of 3-16.\n\nThe 26-year-old, whose 4-23 against Sri Lanka at this tournament in 2021 built his reputation as Ireland's most dangerous quick, had been left out of the side for the opening two games this time around.\n\nBowling with a menacing pace throughout, the left-armer was denied a wicket with his fifth delivery when Ireland's struggles in the field at this tournament continued as Delany dropped Aamir in the deep.\n\nHe came back, however, to claim the wickets of Muhammad Nadeem, Jiten Ramanandi, Nadeem Khan to take away any remote hopes of an Oman victory.",

    "fullText": "Team GB's women curlers kickstarted their campaign with a superb first victory of these Winter Olympics, beating medal contenders Canada 7-6.\n\nAfter surrendering meekly in their opening two matches against China and South Korea, few fancied Rebecca Morrison's rink to right the wrongs against the world champions.\n\nHowever, the British team raised their game significantly, with Morrison in particular making the shots that she was missing earlier in the competition, to overcome a Canadian side who looked fragile after their loss to the United States on Friday.\n\n\"It just feels absolutely amazing to go out there and get our first win,\" skip Sophie Jackson told BBC Sport. \"We put the game together that we wanted to today - we had a good first half and carried that on in the second half.\"\n\nIt took until the third end for the Scottish quartet to get on the board, but after Canada skip Rachel Homan erred, Morrison kept her composure to slide in for three.\n\nAnother fabulous Morrison shot in the fourth forced another mistake from Homan and allowed GB to steal, before they were into the break 4-2 up.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nBoth their previous matches got away from the British rink after the interval, but they maintained their momentum here.\n\nPoints were traded in the sixth and seventh ends before Morrison - growing in stature by the minute - delivered another two to move her side four clear going into the penultimate end.\n\nCanada looked devoid of ideas. Homan, for whom Olympic gold has proved elusive throughout a stellar career, was floundering. One in the ninth left them needing a miracle but GB were not of a mind to let this one go.\n\n\"Becca played absolutely fantastically - we all did - but it's great to see Becca when she's like that and I'm sure she'll be on a roll now,\" Jackson added.\n\nThe women will look to continue their unlikely revival on Sunday against another fancied rink, Sweden (13:05 GMT).\n\nThey have six more round-robin matches to play, with a total of five or six wins potentially enough to clinch a semi-final place.\n\nAnd GB's men are next on the ice, playing their fourth match of nine against Czech Republic at 13:05 GMT on Saturday.\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "fullText": "SURPRISE—Arizona began last season with three consecutive losses but ended up making it to the College World Series. Something to consider when evaluating the first result of the season.\n\nThe Wildcats dropped their 2026 opener on Friday night, losing 10-7 to Stanford at Surprise Stadium. It snapped a 6-game win streak against their former Pac-12 rivals.\n\nArizona pitchers combined to issue seven walks, something they only did four times all of last season. Three of those were by starter Owen Kramkowski, a career high for the junior right-hander, who didn’t make it out of the 4th inning.\n\nStanford also stole six bases, part of an inauspicious UA debut behind the plate for catcher Roman Meyers, who also was charged with catcher’s interference that led to the Cardinal’s first run.\n\n“Those are things we’ve got to take care of,” said UA coach Chip Hale, who laid equal blame on UA pitchers not being quick enough to the plate. “We’ve got to be more accountable. Teams last year I think were a little leery to run on us with (Adonys Guzman) behind the plate, he had a good reputation. And Roman throws as well as anybody in the country, we just have to give him a chance.”\n\nArizona had 11 hits, its most in a season opener since 2019, but also struck out 15 times. The Wildcats had won 28 consecutive games when scoring at least seven runs including 24-0 in 2025.\n\nKramkowski, who is a projected high draft pick, allowed five runs (four earned) in 3.1 innings. He gave up six hits but three were not well hit.\n\n“He threw way too many pitches in the first couple innings,” Hale said. “I think there was probably what, four balls that literally were squibbers, bloopers. It just adds up on his pitch count, and the first time out, we’re not gonna let him go past the 80-pitch mark. He was not at all as effective as he was last year.”\n\nBut Kramkowski was off the hook after Arizona scored three in the bottom of the 4th to tie it at 5. Oregon State transfer Carson McEntire had an RBI single and Milwaukee transfer Tyler Bickers followed with a 2-run single.\n\nStanford broke it open with a 5-run 6th against a pair of transfer relievers. Nolan Straniero walked three and allowed a 2-run triple, leaving down 8-5, then lefty Patrick Morris gave up a 2-run homer.\n\nThe UA got two back in the bottom of the 6th on back-to-back homers by Meyers and McEntire, though Meyers’ shot was almost erased. Stanford appealed to second base saying Meyers missed the bag, with the 2B umpire calling him out, but Hale challenged and the call was overturned.\n\nThe UA couldn’t do anything else at the plate after that, despite three scoreless innings of relief from senior Matthew Martinez with seven strikeouts. The Wildcats got the leadoff man on in the 7th and 9th, doing so in all but two innings, but also struck out seven times in the last three frames.\n\n“I think we battled, we gave ourselves a chance,” Hale said. “They threw a couple freshmen that we didn’t have any info on, and they did terrific. They outplayed us tonight.”\n\nBickers, McEntire, Meyers and Andrew Cain each had two hits, with Bickers and McEntire driving in two runs each. McEntire, a Peoria native, was playing on the same field where he made his collegiate debut last season with Oregon State.\n\n“I thought it was a good game overall,” McEntire said. “There’s some stuff that we work on as a team, and me personally, that I will go down and talk to some coaches about and see what we can do better tomorrow.”\n\nMcEntire and his new team will be facing his old team on Saturday, as the Wildcats get the Beavers at 2 p.m. MT. OSU, which lost 5-3 to Michigan on Friday, regularly begins its season at Surprise Stadium and the vast majority of the 5,683 in attendance for the day were wearing orange.\n\n“The Beavs come out and show this place out every year,” McEntire said. “This is a thing for them, and it’s awesome to see their fans.”\n\nSophomore righty Smith Bailey will start for Arizona against OSU lefty Ethan Kleinschmit.",

    "fullText": "Fabio Wardley will make the first defence of his world heavyweight title against Daniel Dubois in all-British affair on Saturday, 9 May in Manchester.\n\nThe 31-year-old was crowned WBO champion in November when Oleksandr Usyk relinquished the belt instead of making a mandatory defence against the Ipswich fighter.\n\nDubois has previously held the IBF title and his meeting with Wardley at the Co-Op Live Arena pits two rivals who are known for their devastating punching power.\n\nWardley, who has won 20 of his 21 professional fights, including 19 by way of knockout, said: \"I've never been in this game to play around. I'm committed to big fights only.\n\n\"I'm the champion, this is a voluntary defence, and I chose this.

    "description": "Matt Weston cements his status as the best skeleton racer in the world, making history by winning Olympic gold in emphatic fashion in Cortina and securing Team GB’s first medal of the 2026 Winter Games.",
    "fullText": "Standing at the top of the winding Cortina sliding track with Olympic gold in his sights, Matt Weston knew what he had to do.\n\nHaving laid the foundations for skeleton gold on Thursday - tidying up errors from his first run to produce a statement second, each time setting the track record - the Briton merely needed more of the same on Friday.\n\nWhat he produced was not only a masterclass in sliding but also a remarkable display of composure and focus to clinch gold - Team GB's first medal of the Games - and cement his place at the top of the sport.\n\n\"It means everything. It means a hell of a lot to me personally, I've worked so hard for this,\" Weston told BBC Sport.\n\n\"But everyone back home - my fiancee, my family, my friends, everyone who has sacrificed everything for this. I've missed funerals, birthdays, everything for this moment. It feels amazing. Hopefully I made you proud.\"\n\nWeston set a track record on all four of his runs and could have eased off in his final attempt having already built a significant margin of 0.39 seconds, but ramped things up on what was ultimately a victory lap lasting 55.61secs, finishing with a sensational overall time of 3:43.33.\n\nIt left an almost impossible task for the chasing pack and Germany's Axel Jungk finished 0.88secs behind to take silver, while compatriot and defending Olympic champion Christopher Grotheer secured bronze, 1.07secs behind Weston.\n\nThe pressure to deliver was there. The 28-year-old from Redhill was the heavy favourite to top the podium in Italy having dominated the sport in the past four-year cycle, but no British man had won an Olympic skeleton gold medal before.\n\nHe also carried the weight of Team GB teetering on the edge of overall disappointment at the Games, having been tipped for a record medal haul at Milan-Cortina but watching those ambitions begin to slip away.\n\nWeston blocked out the noise of 'helmet-gate', of seeing his peer Vladyslav Heraskevych disqualified from the competition just moments before the first heat, and of the disaster that was Beijing 2022, where GB failed to win a skeleton medal for the first time since 2002.\n\nHe put it all aside to add the Olympic crown to his two World Championship titles and three Crystal Globes - the overall World Cup trophies.\n\nFour years ago, it was a different story.\n\nHis overwhelming disappointment at missing out on the Olympic podium almost led to him quitting the sport and he told BBC Sport earlier this year he has had to teach himself to \"love the pressure and expectation\".\n\nFrom speaking to friends and family to knowing when to rest and eating lots of pasta, Weston has figured out the secret to his own success, and now he's reaping the rewards.\n\nThe new champion knows what it feels like to walk away from an Olympics empty-handed, having finished 15th at his maiden Games in Beijing.\n\nKnowing he did not want to feel that again, he has worked on switching his mentality and says that has paved the way for his success.\n\nIn 2023 he became Britain's first men's world champion in 15 years, taking silver the following year but reclaiming his title in 2025.\n\nHis first World Cup title came in 2024 and he has been unrivalled since, earlier this year becoming the first man to defend the trophy twice - winning five of the seven races this season and finishing second in the other two.\n\nArriving at this Games as reigning world, European and World Cup champion, the pressure was on to deliver.\n\n\"I have taught myself to love the pressure and love the expectation I have on my shoulders,\" Weston told BBC Sport after run two on Thursday.\n\n\"I didn't like it when I first had success, but now I have turned it into fire that I can go out and give my best.\"\n\nHe represented England at taekwondo as a teenager, winning various medals at national level, but a back injury brought that particular sporting career to an end.\n\nHe was also a gifted rugby player but, like many skeleton racers, it was through a talent identification programme that Weston discovered his love and aptitude for the winter sport nine years ago.\n\nQuickly rising up the sport came with its own issues and, following that disappointing result four years ago, Weston had to learn to embrace the pressure and, once winning became the norm, carry the weight of being the favourite.\n\nThat attitude has served him well in Italy as he has been able to block out the noise, pointing to enjoyment as the key to his success.\n\nIt has not just been on the track where Weston has blocked out the noise.\n\nThe build-up to the Olympic event was dominated by discussion around the British team's desire to a wear a new helmet design in Italy.\n\nThey ultimately lost an appeal with the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas), banning them from wearing their new helmet.\n\nWeston and team-mate Marcus Wyatt, who was also tipped for success but finished ninth, were confident it would not make a difference, pointing to the triumphs they have enjoyed all season.\n\nThat came before Weston saw Ukrainian Heraskevych disqualified moments before the men's competition started on Thursday.\n\nAnd after a week of no medals for the British team in Italy, pressure on Weston gradually increased.\n\nBut he knew what he needed to do to win gold, stating he would settle for nothing less in Cortina.\n\nThat doesn't always mean being the first to arrive at the track and the last to leave.\n\nHe sat out Wednesday's final training runs in favour of a rest, opting for some light stretching and mental respite by speaking to his fiance about anything other than sliding.\n\nPlus, eating a lot of pasta, abiding by his motto \"pasta makes you faster\".\n\nUltimately, skeleton training is tricky, particularly for a British athlete.\n\nWith no ice tracks in Britain - only a push-start track at the University of Bath - a lot of time is spent in the gym working on speed and explosiveness to improve that all-important start.\n\nWith one run down the icy track taking less than a minute, it means the British sliders spend around two and a half hours per year actually completing runs and a lot of time visualising the track, understanding the twists and turns to make for a seamless run.\n\nBut Weston has got his rituals down to a tee and not only is he the first British man to win winter gold since Christopher Dean topped the ice dancing podium alongside Jayne Torvill in 1984, but also the first British man to win skeleton gold.\n\nHis success may not end there, as he partners Amelia Coltman in the mixed team event, newly introduced for Milan-Cortina, on Sunday.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "fullText": "Ukrainian Vladyslav Heraskevych remain banned from 2026 Winter Olympics skeleton competition after his appeal was rejected by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) on Friday.\n\nThe slider was banned by ruling body IBSF based on International Olympic Committee (IOC) rules over a dispute concerning a helmet he wanted to wear in the event to honour athletes killed in the war with Russia.\n\nThe court said in a statement following an emergency ruling that the sole arbitrator appointed for this matter \"whilst fully sympathetic to Mr Heraskevyc's commemoration, is bound by rules in the IOC Athlete Expression Guidelines.\"\n\nThe arbitrator considers that these guidelines \"provide a reasonable balance between athletes' interests to express their views, and athletes' interests to receive undivided attention for their sporting performance on the field of play.\"\n\nHeraskevych had argued that \"the exclusion is disproportionate, unsupported by any technical or safety violation and causes irreparable sporting harm to him.\"\n\nThe CAS arbitrator said that she was sympathetic with Heraskevych's attempt to \"raise awareness for the grief and devastation suffered by the Ukrainian people.\"\n\nBut she added that the limitations imposed by the IOC to express views during competitions on the field of play are \"reasonable and proportionate, considering the other opportunities for athletes to raise awareness (in mixed zones, in press conferences, on social networks, or in Mr Heraskevych’s case, wearing the helmet during four training runs).\"\n\nHeraskevych had already ruled out racing\n\nEarlier, Heraskevych appeared to have ruled out racing at the Olympics even if he won his appeal against the exclusion.\n\n\"It looks like this train has left,\" the 27-year-old, draped in the Ukrainan flag, told reporters after emerging from a two-and-a-half-hour hearing. \"I cannot do another race so it is done.\"\n\nHis CAS hearing began at a hotel in Milan on Friday and he said he was \"positive\" that his appeal would be upheld.\n\nThe court has set up an ad hoc division to deal with Olympic appeals quickly.\n\nThe first two runs of the Olympic skeleton competition in Cortina took place without Heraskevych, despite him finishing among the top six in all five training runs. The medal runs are scheduled for later on Friday.\n\nA reinstatement would be complicated and the athlete said racing in a symbolic one run was unlikely given the sport is dangerous.\n\n\"From a competitive perspective this makes no sense,\" he said, as he slammed the IOC's \"mockery\" for removing his Games accreditation and then giving it him back despite his racing ban.\n\nHeraskevych had refused repeated warnings from the IOC to give up wearing his helmet.\n\nThe IOC does not allow any kind of political statements in competition. He says this is different as it is a commemoration and not political, something he believes other athletes have been allowed to do.\n\nBut IOC president Kirsty Coventry told a news conference: \"The rules are the rules and I believe in the rules.\n\n\"We have to allow for athletes to express themselves but also to keep athletes safe.\"\n\nShe said political messaging is permitted away from actual competition, in press conferences for example, but that athletes themselves had agreed that the actual events should be neutral.\n\n\"I think he in some ways understood (the rules), but was very committed to his beliefs, but sadly it doesn't change the rules,\" Coventry said.\n\nHeraskevych was excluded shortly before the start of the first run in Cortina d'Ampezzo on Thursday.\n\nIn his appeal, he requested the annulment of the decision and \"that CAS reinstates him in the 2026 [Olympic Winter Games] with immediate effect, or in the alternative, that the athlete performs a CAS supervised official run pending the final decision.\"\n\nAround 40 members of the European Parliament have backed the slider and have written to the IOC, calling the ban wrong.\n\nPress reaction in Europe has also been largely against the IOC, while some Russian media in contrast have said the body has been too soft in giving his accreditation back.\n\nRussia as a nation is not allowed at the Games because of the war, but some individual Russian athletes are competing as neutrals after proving they have not actively supported the conflict.",

    "title": "Putin Didn't Know How Good He Had It",
    "description": "The Russian leader has gotten the world he wished for—and it’s threatening to crush him.",
    "fullText": "For decades, Russian President Vladimir Putin railed against the world that the United States built after the Cold War. In his account, an international order run by a single power would hinder Russia and produce needless conflict, especially when that power was as self-serving and duplicitous as America.\n\nNow Donald Trump is dismantling the order that Putin had so long abhorred, and a new multipolar world is emerging in its place. Putin had thought he could rise to the top of such a system, in which raw economic and military might outweigh diplomacy and alliances. But he was mistaken: The norms and institutions of the postwar order actually masked Russia’s vulnerabilities. Putin has gotten the world he wished for—and it’s threatening to crush him.\n\nMoscow had assumed that its immense nuclear arsenal, unparalleled natural resources, and extensive territory in the heart of Eurasia would keep Russia competitive with China and the United States. But these assets have been unable to slow its rapid decline. Russia’s economy is at best one-quarter the size of China’s and America’s, and the gap is growing. Meanwhile, it risks becoming an afterthought in the race for technological supremacy in artificial intelligence, biotechnology, and quantum computing. The country’s economy and technology base are even slowly losing ground to India’s.\n\nTo make the case that his power is still secure, Putin has touted a wide-ranging strategic partnership with China, which Russia has tried to strengthen particularly since 2022. But the relationship has fallen short of his expectations. Bilateral trade increased at first, but it now appears to have plateaued. China has invested little in Russia’s economy, and nowhere near the amount that the West withdrew after Putin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Because Russia has few other major trading partners, China seems empowered to drive hard bargains: Negotiations on energy deals—one, called Power of Siberia 2, would bring Russian natural gas to China—have stalled because Moscow hasn’t been able to get Beijing to cover enough of the costs.\n\nRead: Putin and Xi are holding the West together\n\nThe war in Ukraine has only deepened Russia’s disadvantages. Before February 2022, some observers thought Russia was one of the world’s premier military powers—an assessment that Ukraine quickly upended. The conflict has now dragged on longer than the Soviet Union’s campaign against Nazi Germany, and it has resulted in more than 1 million Russian casualties, exacerbating the country’s chronic demographic crisis. Even if Putin is able to seize additional territory, most of it will be shelled-out cities and deserted land. Reconstructing it would require billions of dollars that Russia does not have and is unlikely to receive from others.\n\nAs Putin continues to pour resources into the war, he is hemorrhaging international support and influence. Russia’s long-standing partners in Syria and Venezuela have been swept out of power. Meanwhile, former Soviet states have reoriented away from Moscow and toward Western countries. Armenia and Azerbaijan turned to Trump to resolve a simmering dispute over a transportation corridor. Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan are strengthening their ties with Washington. Moldova has accelerated its political shift toward Europe. Putin believed that the end of the U.S.-led order would help him consolidate power in the former Soviet space. But Russia has been too weak and ineffective to take advantage.\n\nPutin also assumed that a multipolar world would free him from American interference. And indeed, Trump has accommodated Moscow in some ways. His conciliation does not, however, extend to Russia’s energy sector, the foundation of its economy: Last fall, Trump levied wide-ranging sanctions against Rosneft and Lukoil, the country’s two largest oil producers. The U.S. has also ramped up enforcement against shadow tankers, threatening a primary channel that Russia has used to sidestep sanctions on its oil sales. Trump’s plans to revive Venezuela’s petroleum sector might likewise hurt Russia. Executing those plans may prove more complicated than Trump anticipates, but they could drive Russia’s oil prices below what its federal budget can sustain.\n\nRead: A high-seas gambit humiliates Putin\n\nMoscow is at the mercy of an American president who circumvents traditional channels of power and obliterates the constraints that once regulated their use. For example, Trump could attempt to use his recently constituted Board of Peace to bypass the United Nations Security Council—and Russia’s veto—and muscle through his preferred policy in the Middle East, eroding Moscow’s influence in the region. Thanks to decisions by both Trump and Putin, moreover, the two powers no longer have any functional arms-control agreements. Without these, Trump could choose to accelerate his “Golden Dome” missile-defense program, which Russia fears could undermine its own nuclear deterrence.\n\nTrump’s disdain for international alliances and norms has also begun to reshape Europe in a way that may exacerbate Russia’s weakness. As U.S. security assurances wane, European countries are developing their hard-power capabilities. Germany has committed 100 billion euros to modernize its military, and Poland is building up its armed forces with a goal of amassing 300,000 troops. Putin has long wanted to split the U.S. and Europe. But he might soon find that the continent—which collectively dwarfs Russia in population and wealth—poses a significant challenge even if it doesn’t belong to a U.S.-dominated alliance.\n\nShortly before becoming president in 2000, Putin issued a manifesto explaining how Russia could keep from falling into the second or third rank of world powers. He insisted that America’s global leadership was holding Moscow back. In reality, he didn’t know how good he had it.",

    "description": "NBC Sports' exclusive stylist Amy Acton explains what it takes to dress more than 200 on-air personalities for Olympic coverage around the world.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Amy Acton, the founder and CEO of Acton Styling Group. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI'm the exclusive stylist for NBC Sports, which means I style NBC talent for the Olympics and other shows like Sunday Night Football, the Kentucky Derby, and more.\n\nI've always been interested in fashion. When I was younger, I went to college for all of two weeks because I ran out of outfits — I thought there was no point. It just wasn't for me. After working at health clubs, I became a personal shopper for an upscale clothing boutique, and then moved into television styling.\n\nI began my styling career on television for \"The Montel Williams Show\" in the 90s. I was styling mostly men then. At a photo shoot, a woman asked me to style NBC anchor Hannah Storm. I did closet edits for her and then her wardrobe for the 2000 Sydney Olympics. Then I became a stylist for the Sydney Games. Sports changed my life.\n\nI style over 200 people for NBC during its Olympics coverage. It's not just on-air talent, although we style 20 to 25 on-air talent, like Mike Tirico and Rebecca Lowe. We also create the \"venue talent wardrobe package,\" which is what all the reporters and commentators who call the games on-site wear.\n\nWe start two years before the broadcast. As soon as one Olympics ends, we begin preparing for the next one. We have to make sure we are doing everything — from choosing the right colors to selecting clothing that will protect everyone from the environment — Milan's temperature is very different from the 2018 Winter Olympics site, PyeongChang, for example.\n\nA post shared by Trenni (Kusnierek) Casey (@trenninbcs)\n\nTo prepare, we bring all the talent to New York to do a fitting with the looks I pre-pull. Ralph Lauren, the exclusive brand NBC talent wears, has a team on hand to assist the in-studio team with alterations. The venue talent also comes to the studio; we have to make sure they look good and cohesive, and we don't want everyone wearing the same sweater at the same time. We alter the clothes, and then we ship everything where it needs to go. We shipped the clothes to Milan about a month prior to the games.\n\nMy company, Acton Group, doesn't have anything to do with what Team USA athletes wear.\n\nI'm always working in two different time zones. We have studios in the US plus talent in the host country. In the US, the talent is at the NBC Sports Group headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut, and sometimes at 30 Rock in New York City. The day never really ends. My phone is always on. For example, I went straight from dressing Super Bowl commentators Jason Garrett, Devin McCourty, and Maria Taylor to Milan for the Olympics.\n\nA post shared by Rebecca Lowe (@rebeccalowetv)\n\nIt's highly hands-on and fast-paced — I'm managing fittings, daily dressing, wardrobe organization, and last-minute changes. For studio talent alone, it's 420 looks over two weeks. There are 10 people in Milan, and 10 people in the US on my team. We are a machine, a 24-hour operation in both countries. Between Stamford and Milan, Acton Style Group manages the movement of more than 7,500 Ralph Lauren pieces across all venues.\n\nAs much as I love fashion, it's about making people feel good about themselves. We want talent — who are in front of the biggest audiences in the world — to feel good about themselves.\n\nYou can't put a price tag on that, and you can't always do it for yourself. You need someone else to pump you up and tell you that it looks good.",

    "description": "A practical comparison of Spegel and Harbor for Kubernetes image caching. Learn how to evaluate these solutions based on operational complexity, architecture, and real-world deployment experience.",
    "fullText": "If you’re running Kubernetes clusters and hitting DockerHub rate limits, you need a pull-through image cache, a solution where images pulled by one node are automatically shared with other nodes in the cluster instead of each node pulling them individually from the internet. But which one? In this post, I’ll walk through my decision process comparing Harbor and Spegel for multi-node bare-metal clusters, share real deployment experiences with both solutions, and help you choose the right tool based on your operational constraints.\n\nThis post is for: DevOps engineers and platform teams evaluating pull-through cache solutions for Kubernetes clusters with 10+ nodes, particularly those who manage multiple clusters with limited operational capacity.\n\nProblem solved: Eliminated DockerHub rate limit failures during cluster provisioning for two 10-15 node bare-metal Kubernetes clusters behind NAT.\n\nSolution chosen: Spegel (distributed P2P cache) over Harbor (centralized registry platform).\n\nWhy Spegel won: Zero operational overhead after initial setup, inherently distributed architecture matching our existing cluster design, and minimal infrastructure dependencies. It reuses containerd’s existing storage without requiring databases, certificates, or persistent volumes.\n\n🔗 Spegel on GitHub | Harbor on GitHub\n\nI’ve been running two bare-metal Kubernetes clusters for a university project (one for development, one for production) each spanning 10-15 nodes for a while now. I’ve automated the cluster setup with Ansible, and the infrastructure works well, but we have a recurring pain point: DockerHub rate limits.\n\nThe problem became acute when provisioning new nodes or spinning up fresh clusters. DockerHub’s anonymous rate limit with 200 pulls per 6 hours per IP sounds reasonable but was not sufficient because:\n\nI could authenticate with a DockerHub API key to increase the limit, but that felt like a band-aid: managing credentials across clusters, and still being subject to limits when growing the cluster sizes. So instead, I looked for a different solution.\n\nThe specific issues driving this decision:\n\nAfter some research, I narrowed the field to two fundamentally different solutions.\n\nHarbor is a feature-rich container registry platform that happens to support pull-through caching. It’s a CNCF graduated project with features including vulnerability scanning, image signing, replication, RBAC, multi-tenancy, and proxy caching for upstream registries.\n\nMy first impression: feature-rich and comprehensive. Harbor packs a lot of capabilities, which raises an immediate question: do I run this inside my clusters or as a shared service outside them? For multiple teams or applications, you might run Harbor as centralized infrastructure. For my use case (two isolated clusters) I could run one per cluster.\n\nSpegel is purpose-built for one thing: distributed image mirroring within a Kubernetes cluster. It runs as a DaemonSet, so one pod per node, turning each node into both a consumer and provider of container images. The architecture is stateless and peer-to-peer.\n\nMy first impression: lightweight and focused. Spegel does exactly what I needed, nothing more. The deployment model is obvious: it lives in-cluster, period. No architectural decisions to make about topology or multi-cluster sharing.\n\nFirst impression summary: Harbor is a Swiss Army knife; Spegel is a scalpel.\n\nEvery project differs, and so should the tools that are used.\nIn my project, I followed the following decision criteria:\n\nI’m already running Kubernetes with all its operational complexity: three-node control-plane HA setup, monitoring with Prometheus, logging aggregation, and so on. Adding a solution that integrates naturally with this existing infrastructure means I don’t have to context-switch to a separate system.\n\nKubernetes-native also means using the primitives I already understand: DaemonSets, Services, ConfigMaps. I can reuse my existing monitoring and alerting setup rather than learning a new system’s operational model.\n\nI’m a solo operator on this project, so keep it simple is the philosophy. Every additional system I run is something else that can break, need upgrading, require monitoring, or demand my attention.\n\nThe ideal solution would have low operational complexity: simple to understand, few moving parts, and graceful degradation if something breaks. The caching layer should be optional infrastructure that makes things better, not critical path that can cause outages.\n\nWe’ve invested effort into an automated Kubernetes setup with three control-plane nodes with self-healing capabilities. Caching container images is prone to become a single-point of failure if not done right, so the solution should be fault tolerant. If I’m going to run distributed infrastructure, the caching layer should be distributed too. The architecture should align: distributed container orchestration deserves distributed image distribution.\n\nHarbor comes with many features that, while useful in other contexts, were overkill for my needs:\n\nI needed a pull-through cache, not a full container registry platform.\n\nI installed Harbor on our dev cluster via helm to see what running it actually involves.\n\nHarbor deploys multiple components:\n\nHow pull-through caching works:\n\nThis architecture made sense to me, but configuration was tedious.\n\nDeploying Harbor via Helm was straightforward: the chart is mature and well-documented. Within minutes, I had Harbor running with its database, Redis, and core services (though not in high-availability setup).\n\nConfiguration (the tedious part):\n\nCreating proxy projects requires using the Harbor UI or API. I wanted this automated for reproducibility, so I wrote a post-install Helm hook script using harbor-cli to create the proxy project automatically. Even though it worked in the end, it felt weird that such a fundamental configuration, I had to write the following:\n\nThis felt complex for such a basic use case. I looked into the Harbor Operator project, which seemed promising, but it’s abandoned now. The lack of a maintained declarative config option made Harbor feel less Kubernetes-friendly than I expected.\n\nHere’s where Harbor’s architecture clashed with my requirements. Containerd doesn’t allow pulling from HTTP registries, it requires HTTPS (unless configured otherwise, opening up potential attack vectors). That means Harbor needs TLS certificates.\n\nBut I wanted to keep Harbor cluster-internal to reduce the attack surface. Why expose a caching layer to the internet? This meant\n\nThe complexity kept growing. For a caching layer that’s supposed to make things easier, this was too much complexity.\n\nHigh availability implications:\n\nRunning Harbor properly would need:\n\nWhile doable (we already run cnpg Postgres clusters and Longhorn for replicated volumes), each component adds operational burden. I’d be running a distributed database cluster, a Redis cluster, and coordinating stateful services just to cache some images. It felt overkill.\n\nHarbor runs on Kubernetes but doesn’t feel native to it. It’s a traditional stateful app ported to K8s. You manage databases, configure external services, and work around mismatches between Harbor’s design and Kubernetes patterns (like having to script proxy project creation).\n\nThere’s a Harbor operator, but it’s abandoned. I hope that’ll change in the future and a successor will make the adoption in kubernetes easier.\n\nFor me, this felt overkill for what I needed.\n\nHarbor is centralized by design. All nodes pull through a single Harbor instance (or load-balanced cluster). If Harbor goes down, image pulls fail. Making Harbor HA means running multiple complex stateful services in HA mode, which takes significant effort.\n\nThe architectural question also nagged at me: should I run one Harbor per cluster, or one shared Harbor for both dev and prod? One per cluster duplicates operational overhead. One shared instance couples my environments and requires external networking.\n\nIf you need Harbor’s features, they’re well-executed:\n\nFor teams with dedicated ops capacity, Harbor’s capabilities justify the overhead. For a solo operator who just needs caching, it’s too much.\n\nAfter Harbor’s complexity, Spegel felt like a breath of fresh air.\n\nSpegel takes a radically different approach: each Kubernetes node is both a consumer and provider of container images. There’s no central registry, instead nodes share images peer-to-peer.\n\nDiscovery: Each Spegel instance advertises which image layers (by digest) it has locally to the DHT, refreshing every 9 minutes and updating reactively when containerd creates, updates, or deletes images. When a node needs a layer, it queries the DHT to find which peers have it.\n\nServing: When containerd on Node A requests an image, it’s configured to check Spegel first (via containerd’s registry mirror config). Spegel on Node A queries the DHT, finds that Node B has the layer, fetches it via HTTP from Node B’s Spegel instance (retrying with alternative peers if Node B fails), and returns it to containerd.\n\nFallback: If no peer has the layer (or peers are unreachable), Spegel returns HTTP 404. Containerd then falls back to pulling from the upstream registry (DockerHub, etc.) as normal.\n\nSpegel doesn’t try to be a registry, it’s a distributed mirror of what’s already on your nodes. By reusing containerd’s storage and implementing a peer-to-peer layer on top, Spegel avoids the complexity of traditional registries. Images are served directly from containerd’s existing content store, which eliminates the operational burden of managing separate state, coordinating cross-node consistency, or implementing backup strategies for cached content.\n\nMake sure those sections are configured in the /etc/containerd/config.toml file on every node and restart containerd after:\n\nDeploying Spegel via Helm is trivial:\n\nDefault configuration worked fine for my experimentation, including the DaemonSet deployment.\n\nGetting Spegel working took about 3 hours, not because of Spegel itself, but because of containerd configuration complexity.\n\nSpegel requires containerd to be configured to use it as a registry mirror. This means modifying /etc/containerd/certs.d/ (or equivalent) on each node. Since I use Ansible for cluster provisioning, I needed to automate this. On the one hand, dealing with toml files was surprisingly annoying with Ansible, but the real issue was containerd.\n\nThe containerd config nightmare:\n\nIn my case , containerd has conflicting registry configuration sections due to plugin architecture evolution:\n\nLegacy CRI v1 section (deprecated):\n\nModern gRPC CRI section (correct):\n\nI had both sections in my config file. The empty config_path in the legacy section was silently overriding the correct modern section, so containerd never picked up Spegel’s mirror configuration.\n\nSince containerd 2.0, there’s no way to query containerd for its loaded configuration to validate what’s actually active. I had to debug by trial and error: restarting containerd, checking logs, manually testing image pulls. Compounding the issue, images were already present on nodes from prior pulls, so my initial verification steps falsely succeeded (containerd just used the locally cached image, never trying to go through Spegel).\n\nThe solution: Configure both sections, the outdated and the current one, accordingly. Once this was sorted, Spegel worked flawlessly.\n\nSince deployment, Spegel has required zero maintenance interventions. The absence of external dependencies (databases, certificate infrastructure, persistent volumes) means there are no routine operational tasks beyond standard Kubernetes workload monitoring.\n\nThe failure consequences are minimal since Spegel is designed as purely an optimization layer. If it fails, the cluster continues working normally, just pulling from upstream registries.\n\nMonitoring with Prometheus and Grafana:\n\nSpegel comes with built-in Prometheus metrics and can automatically provision a Grafana dashboard. Here’s the configuration I used in my Helm values:\n\nThis automatically creates a ServiceMonitor for Prometheus to scrape Spegel metrics, and provisions a Grafana dashboard that shows key operational metrics like the container images and image layers that are advertised.\n\nSpegel is genuinely Kubernetes-native:\n\nAfter initial containerd configuration, Spegel requires minimal ongoing operations:\n\nSpegel is architecturally distributed. Every node is both client and server. If three nodes have an image layer and one goes down, the other two continue serving it. There’s no central registry to fail.\n\nThe DHT provides peer discovery with minimal coordination overhead. While leader election occurs for some operations, the short 10-second lease times ensure rapid failover when nodes become unavailable.\n\nSpegel is deliberately focused on distributed image mirroring. Features outside this scope include:\n\nFor my use case (pure pull-through caching) these omissions don’t matter.\n\nAgainst my three criteria (Kubernetes-native integration, minimal operational complexity, and no single point of failure) Spegel was the clear winner.\n\nHarbor’s feature set is impressive, but my use case didn’t need vulnerability scanning, multi-tenancy, image signing, or a full registry platform. What I needed was simple: stop hitting DockerHub rate limits when provisioning nodes.\n\nSpegel solves exactly that problem with minimal complexity: a DaemonSet that reuses containerd’s storage, peer-to-peer image distribution, and graceful fallback to upstream registries. The architecture eliminates the need for databases, certificate infrastructure, and architectural decisions about in-cluster vs. shared infrastructure placement.\n\nFor projects with limited operational capacity, the reduction in operational complexity outweighs the value of unused features.\n\nYour context is different from mine. Here’s how to decide:\n\n1. Kubernetes-Native means more than “runs on Kubernetes”\n\nHarbor deploys on K8s but feels like traditional infrastructure ported over: databases, certificates, centralized state. Particularly, the configuration-as-code functionality is missing. Spegel embraces Kubernetes primitives: DaemonSets, Services, containerd integration. For operational complexity, this distinction matters.\n\n2. Unused features incur operational costs\n\nEvery feature in a system has operational costs: infrastructure to maintain, failure modes to understand, upgrade paths to test. When evaluating tools, consider not just what they can do, but what maintaining those capabilities will cost your team in ongoing operational overhead.\n\n3. Evaluate by deploying, not just reading\n\nDocumentation made Harbor seem reasonable. Deployment revealed friction: certificate management, proxy project configuration, HA complexity. The containerd config issues with Spegel similarly only surfaced hands-on. Test in practice before committing.\n\nThe choice isn’t about “which is better” but which better fits your constraints.\n\nFor my project (two bare-metal clusters, solo operator, DockerHub rate limits) Spegel’s simplicity won. Harbor’s features would have been overhead without corresponding value.\n\nChoose the simplest solution that solves your problem. Upgrade only when complexity is justified by real necessity.\n\nThe lack of required maintenance interventions since deployment validates the choice. Infrastructure requiring minimal operational attention is infrastructure designed appropriately for its context.\n\nThis article documents a real infrastructure decision made while building a Kubernetes-based platform, analyzing the architectural and operational trade-offs between centralized and distributed approaches to container image distribution.",

    "description": "EY's global engineering chief, Steve Newman, says a \"handful of agents\" do the heavy lifting at the consulting firm.",
    "fullText": "McKinsey CEO Bob Sternfels said last month that the firm added 25,000 AI agents to its staff in less than two years.\n\n\"I don't think the number of agents translates directly to value,\" EY's global engineering chief, Steve Newman, told Business Insider. \"In fact, some of the best value that we have is returned by just a handful of agents that are doing the heavy lifting.\"\n\nNewman said EY is more focused on measuring efficiency. He said EY tracks agent value through key performance indicators for productivity, quality, and cost.\n\n\"We chart those month to month, quarter to quarter, and that's what my lens is as to the effectiveness of AI,\" he said.\n\nPwC's chief AI officer, Dan Priest, also recently told Business Insider that he's unmoved by McKinsey's army of AI agents.\n\n\"I think that's probably the wrong measure,\" he said. The value of AI deployment is better measured by the quality — not the quantity — of agents, he said.\n\nSternfels first talked about his firm's onboarding of tens of thousands of agents in January at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. He mentioned it again on an episode of Harvard Business Review's IdeaCast. A McKinsey spokesperson later confirmed to Business Insider that the number was accurate.\n\nSternfels said the firm plans to add more, too. In the next year and a half, every one of its 40,000 human employees will be \"enabled by at least one or more agents,\" he said.\n\nAI has rapidly reshaped the consulting industry in recent years. McKinsey, EY, PwC, and other consulting firms are all racing to both adopt AI internally and position themselves as the go-to for other companies seeking advice on how to do the same.\n\nEY said during an October earnings call that it invests more than $1 billion each year to develop AI-first platforms and products, including building 1,000 AI agents and deploying more than 100 internal AI applications.",

    "title": "I'm an American who studied abroad at Zhejiang University in China. It was unlike anything I experienced back in the US.",
    "description": "When I studied abroad in college, I attended the school that just unseated Harvard as one of the best in the world: Zhejiang University in China",
    "fullText": "In the spring of 2013, I was a sophomore at Tufts University in Massachusetts, soon to declare a dual major in international relations and Mandarin Chinese.\n\nDespite my lofty aspirations to travel the world as a diplomat, my academic career so far had taken me a whopping 25 miles north of my hometown. That's why my university's study abroad program in China appealed to me.\n\nOnce I heard the tales of adventure from the 2012 program's freshly minted graduates, I eagerly applied. That summer, with an acceptance letter in hand, I set off to enroll at Zhejiang University.\n\nUpon landing in Shanghai, my American classmates and I were piled into a minibus for the two-hour drive south to the garden city of Hangzhou — capital of Zhejiang Province and home to Zhejiang University (affectionately referred to by locals as ZheDa).\n\nAfter settling into the dorm, which was a single room with a private bathroom, we were welcomed by our professors with a banquet at the college's canteen — an establishment which was far better than the standardized cafeteria fare that I'd come to know back in New England.\n\nIn our dormitory building, for the equivalent of $2 at the time, one could acquire a filling meal any time of the day — from rice porridge and steamed buns in the morning to stir-fried vegetables and sweet and sour pork tenderloin in the evening, all cooked fresh to order.\n\nZhejiang University was massive and spread across multiple campuses throughout the city. Fortunately for us newcomers, our group at the University's International College was tucked into a leafy hillside on the historic Yuquan campus, offering a slice of Chinese university life at an approachable scale.\n\nAs the sweltering days of summer transitioned into an osmanthus flower-scented autumn, I settled into a new school year. Each morning consisted of four hours of intensive language instruction, followed by at least a few more hours of homework and self-study in the afternoon.\n\nIn addition, each week we'd attend one three-hour lecture on Chinese Peasant History with our advisor, who drew heavily from his own experiences as an academic sent to the countryside during Mao's Cultural Revolution.\n\nI also had a three-hour lecture on the Chinese Legal System with a professor who'd argued many cases within China's rapidly evolving court system.\n\nWhile my application to enroll in Zhejiang University was relatively quick and painless, the road to admission for most of ZheDa's domestic student population was comparatively long and grueling.\n\nFrom an early age, they'd studied for hours at school, followed by hours at buxiban (cram schools), preparing to ace China's notoriously difficult standardized exams, such as the Gaokao. Of the millions who sit for the Gaokao each year, only the highest scorers earn spots in China's most prestigious schools, such as Peking, Tsinghua, and Zhejiang universities.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the academic work ethic that carried students to Zhejiang University did not fall off after admission. While most of my international classmates would study long hours during the week, we would take Friday nights and weekends off to travel within China. But many local students, however, rarely engaged in such frivolous pursuits and were more likely to be studying in the library on a Friday or Saturday evening.\n\nAs exams marked the end of my semester at ZheDa in December 2013, I personally experienced the exacting academic standards that my Chinese classmates were intimately familiar with. While I did pass all of my classes, a minor error in pronunciation or a stroke askew in a written character, mistakes that my Chinese professors back at Tufts may have overlooked, were marked down harshly by my professors at Zhejiang University.\n\nWhen scrolling Instagram in January 2025, I saw a familiar sight in a post from The New York Times — a statue of Mao Zedong standing before Laohe Hill and a familiar library, waving to the students on a verdant Yuquan Campus. Reading on, I was proud to learn that my study abroad alma mater had been named the most productive research university in the world by Leiden Rankings, outpacing even my hometown juggernaut, Harvard.\n\nI cannot say that I am shocked by this development. My semester at ZheDa showed me a culture of academic rigor on a scale few American universities can match, drawing from an academic talent pool far larger than in the US.\n\nMy time at ZheDa forced me out of my comfort zone and exposed me to an academic world significantly different from that in which I'd been educated, and I believe I am a more open-minded learner for it.",

My Twitter is nothing other than football and even my TikTok.\n\n\"My girlfriend absolutely hates it.\"\n\nLeask & Munsey star as Scotland beat debutants Italy\n\nScotland beaten by West Indies in T20 World Cup opener\n\nThe Office, Willy Wonka & Denmark at Euro 92 - Scotland's chaotic WC prep\n\nCurrie, 27, was once ranked 30th in the world in a game now played by almost 13 million people.\n\nPlaying a World Cup in India comes with one obvious problem - the five-and-a-half-hour time difference to the UK.\n\nThis week's Premier League matches kicked off in the early hours and the deadlines to make transfers were late at night.\n\n\"I can't figure out a way to get the games on and I am even struggling to see highlights.\n\n\"It has been absolute torture, but thankfully it is the FA Cup this weekend.\"\n\nThough the secret has started to come out, the professional cricket world was initially unaware of Currie's alter ego.\n\nThese days he gets messages from team-mates and opponents asking for advice.\n\n\"[Sussex bowler] Sean Hunt is one,\" Currie says.\n\n\"He messaged me a screenshot before our West Indies game and said: 'I know you have bigger things at play, but what do you think of my team?'\n\n\"The other day he said: 'What do you think of my team? Oh and well bowled.'\"\n\nSo what about a tip for the rest of the FPL season?\n\n\"Chip strategy,\" Currie replies quickly. \"Dead-end into Gameweek 31. Wildcard in 32. Bench boost 33.\n\n\"Triple captain whenever you want.\"\n\nCurrie is the brother of Scott - the Scotland bowler who was called up by England last year.\n\nThey both qualify for Scotland via their Scottish dad, having grown up on England's south coast. Left-armer Brad studied sports psychology at Bournemouth University.\n\nA lifelong fan, Brad was at the Cherries' 3-2 win over Liverpool at the Vitality Stadium - when Amine Adli scored a 95th-minute winner against the Premier League champions - the day he got the call from coach Owen Dawkins to tell him he had made Scotland's World Cup squad.\n\n\"I said to my mate: 'I know exactly what this is, but I can't pick this up because I won't get any signal,\" Currie says.\n\n\"I got to the phone later and Dawks said: 'That was a good result, wasn't it?'\n\n\"I said: 'Yeah, and I hope you're not going to ruin my mood now.'\"\n\nHaving been pipped at qualifying by the Netherlands and Italy, Scotland got a place at this World Cup when Bangladesh opted to boycott the tournament.\n\nThe preceding weeks were uncertain, filled with claims and counterclaims about whether the Tigers would take part and what it would mean for Scotland if they did not. Even the players were not immune.\n\n\"I was at Sussex training in the indoor school and was asking all of the powers that be and the coaching staff,\" Currie says.\n\n\"It was crazy to have people saying we were going. I just thought, 'you know more than me and I am one of the players in the official Scotland group chat'.\"\n\nAs a county pro at Sussex, Currie was fortunate he had been training through the winter.\n\nBowlers' workloads are notoriously important to manage, however, and Scotland's focus switched from the Cricket World Cup League 2 at the end of March to a T20 World Cup in India at the start of February.\n\n\"I don't know what date it officially got announced but the two days after were the weekend and I just did nothing,\" he says.\n\n\"My girlfriend's family were like: 'Should you not be training? Should you not be doing something?'\n\n\"You can't cram in. You just will get injured. It is not like a school test where you can cram in revision.\"\n\nUncertainty also surrounded the availability of the younger Currie brother.\n\nDespite being picked by England for the tour of Ireland last year, he did not make his debut, leaving some to wonder if he could switch back to the Scots.\n\nAs it turned out, one spell as a substitute fielder made him ineligible.\n\n\"I had to text him and ask,\" Brad says.\n\n\"My heart sank because there are loads of brothers out here playing.\n\n\"We have just played the Manentis and the Moscas [against Italy]. There's the Sheikh brothers [Nepal] as well.\n\n\"It probably would have forced Mum and Dad to remortgage the house and get some flights out but there's only one son out here so it's not needed.\n\n\"He is going to try and please Mum and play for England, but I am going to keep Dad sweet and stick to my Scottish genes.\"\n\nEngland's defeat by West Indies effectively means Saturday's encounter is a must-win for both sides.\n\nThey last met at the 2024 T20 World Cup when an impressive Scotland batting performance meant England were faced with a tricky 110 in 10 overs before rain prevented what could have been an intriguing situation.\n\n\"It is something we will never have the answer to,\" Currie says.\n\n\"I have learned to fear no one and go into games expecting to win.\n\n\"I have a fair background in sports psychology and that is the best way to approach these games.\n\n\"They have Adil Rashid [batting] at 11 with 10 first-class hundreds and I haven't got a first-class double-digit score. I am not naive.\n\n\"[But] They have got to play and travel. We have played two games at Eden Gardens.\n\n\"I am just looking forward to it.\"\n\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",
