    "description": "The Mercedes driver, in a year of new regulations, is the early favourite for the world championship",
    "fullText": "George Russell insists he is desperate to go “head-to-head” with arch rival Max Verstappen ahead of the 2026 F1 season.\n\nMercedes driver Russell is the pre-season favourite for the world championship this year, with the Silver Arrows thought to be the early frontrunners amid a massive regulation shake-up this year.\n\nRed Bull’s Verstappen, meanwhile, fell just two points short of a fifth consecutive title last year as McLaren’s Lando Norris won his first championship. Yet Russell, who had a massive feud with Verstappen at the end of the 2024 season, is adamant he is ready to fight for a world championship, while playing down Mercedes’ tag as favourites.\n\n“I want to go head-to-head with Max,” Russell said, speaking at Mercedes’ 2026 car launch on Monday. “I think the fans are probably expecting for this year to be Mercedes vs McLaren, there’s a lot of anticipation.\n\n“But it seems that the other power units have done a good job, Red Bull have always had an amazing car and we know how good Max is.\n\n“I think he’s very much going to be in the fight this year. You obviously wish you have an easier time, but it should never be easy. If you’re going to win, you want to have fought for it on track.\n\n“I’ve been surprised by our rivals. Red Bull on the power unit side has been very impressive, kudos to them. We’ve had a very reliable test [last week], but we’ll have to wait and see if the car lives up to expectations.”\n\nBritish racer Russell, heading into his fifth season with Mercedes, insisted he doesn’t feel any extra pressure given the early ‘favourite’ tag, but did lavish praise on Aston Martin after last week’s pre-season test in Barcelona.\n\nRussell added: “We’ve only driven the car for three days [in Barcelona last week], quoting Toto, it doesn’t look like a turd!\n\n“Is it a car that can produce a world championship? It’s still too early to see. [Favourite tag] doesn’t make me feel anything. I feel ready to fight for a world championship, but we want to reel in expectations.\n\n“The best case scenario is a number of different drivers and teams all battling it out. Mercedes, Red Bull, McLaren and Ferrari - four teams are all quite close, but you can’t discount what you’ve seen from Aston Martin, what Adrian [Newey] has done looks quite spectacular.\n\n“Honda have had a very good engine with Red Bull, we know what they’re capable of. It would be awesome to see a big fight.”\n\nRussell will be leading the team alongside teenager Kimi Antonelli for the second consecutive year, after Lewis Hamilton left the team in 2024.\n\nThe next pre-season test is in Bahrain on 11-13 February, with the new season starting with the Australian Grand Prix on 8 March.",

    "title": "11 Performance Cars From the 1970s That Were Misunderstood at the Time",
    "description": "The 1970s strangled horsepower with emissions rules, fuel shocks, and insurance pressure—yet a handful of clever performance cars slipped through. Here are 11 machines once dismissed as weird or weak, now praised for lightness, handling, turbo tech, and real-world charm.",
    "fullText": "The 1970s weren't kind to performance cars. Between stricter emissions regulations, the oil crisis, and insurance companies declaring war on horsepower, the decade seemed intent on killing off the muscle car era entirely. But while enthusiasts mourned the loss of their big-block monsters, they missed something important: several manufacturers were quietly figuring out how to make fast cars work in this new reality.\n\nThese 11 performance machines were dismissed, ridiculed, or simply ignored when they were new, but history has been far more generous in its assessment.\n\nAMC's oddball compact looked like it was designed by someone who gave up halfway through, but a Gremlin ordered with the available 304 cubic inch V8 was genuinely punchy for the era. The 304 was rated around 150 horsepower (SAE net) when it arrived for 1972. In a small car, performance could be lively, but published 0 to 60 times varied by test and spec.\n\nPeople laughed at the styling, but AMC understood that lighter cars with smaller V8s were the future of affordable performance.\n\nEnthusiasts accused the 914 of not being a \"real Porsche\" because it had a Volkswagen engine and a reasonable price tag. Its unique looks stand out from Porsche's familiar shape, and the mid-engine layout gave it handling that embarrassed more expensive sports cars, and the 914/6 version with the Porsche flat-six was legitimately fast.\n\nToday, clean examples sell for serious money as collectors finally appreciate what they dismissed as a parts-bin special.\n\nAmerican car magazines initially treated Nissan's sports car like a curiosity rather than a legitimate performance machine. The 240Z delivered 150 horsepower, a 125 mph top speed, and handling that could run with Porsches for about half the price.\n\nIt took a few years for people to realize that Datsun had essentially built a better E-Type Jaguar without the electrical gremlins.\n\nYes, the Vega had exaggerated reliability issues that would make a British Leyland engineer blush, but the GT version with the optional handling package was surprisingly fun to drive. The aluminum four-cylinder’s output depended heavily on year and rating method. Early gross ratings could be quoted as high as 110 hp for certain versions, but early 1970s net ratings were typically lower. The suspension tuning could still be genuinely competent, even if the power numbers were not always as impressive as the brochure era suggests.\n\nIf GM had solved the Vega’s early durability issues, the Vega GT might be remembered as an American sporty coupe instead of a punchline.\n\nIt made 139 horsepower, which sounds pathetic until you remember that a 1980 Corvette’s base engine was rated at 190 horsepower, while the optional higher-output version was rated higher depending on specification.\n\nThe handling was surprisingly good thanks to the compact dimensions, and today's collectors are starting to appreciate these as the last affordable classic Mustangs.\n\nEveryone remembers the Trans Am, but the Formula could be a close cousin depending on the year and options. Both shared the same basic platform, and many performance parts were available across the range, but engines and suspension packages varied by model year and configuration, and some high-performance pieces were not universal.\n\nPontiac sold and produced far fewer Formulas because people wanted the Trans Am's image, but smart buyers got the same experience without paying for the billboard.\n\nBMW built Europe's first turbocharged production car in 1973, and the automotive press responded with confusion and concern about turbo lag. The 2002 Turbo made 170 horsepower and could hit 130 mph, making it one of the fastest sedans available.\n\nOnly 1,672 were built before the oil crisis killed it, and those that survive are worth a small fortune today.\n\nThe Stratos was too weird, too impractical, and too purpose-built for rallying to make sense as a road car. With a Ferrari Dino V6 mounted behind the seats and a wheelbase shorter than a modern Mini Cooper, it drove like a go-kart designed by someone on espresso.\n\nLancia built about 492 Stratos road cars for homologation purposes, and now they're six-figure collectibles that dominated top-level rally results in the mid-1970s.\n\nMopar fans obsessed over Cudas and Challengers while the humble Duster delivered similar performance for thousands less. The 340 cubic inch V8 made 275 horsepower in 1970 and could run mid-14-second quarter miles right off the showroom floor. It was essentially a cheap body on Plymouth's excellent\n\nAn A-body platform, but people dismissed it as a secretary's car with a bigger engine.\n\nRotary engines seemed like a gimmick to most Americans, and the RX-3's tinny build quality didn't help its case. Mazda RX-3 power and engine details varied by market and year. Some early RX-3 road tests cite about 110 bhp from the smaller 10A rotary, while later versions used larger rotary engines, and US emissions-era net ratings could be lower. Weight also varied by body style and equipment, but the car was generally light for its class.\n\nThe RX-3 was very successful in SCCA competition in the mid-1970s, even while some buyers and readers remained skeptical of rotary engines and fuel economy.\n\nWhen the Esprit debuted in late 1975 and entered production in 1976, critics complained it was underpowered with about 160 horsepower in European trim from its 2.0-liter four-cylinder, with lower ratings in some US versions. What they missed was that Lotus had built a mid-engine exotic that weighed about 2,116 pounds and handled like it was on rails.\n\nThe wedge styling looked like it came from a science fiction movie, and while early cars had quality issues, the Esprit established Lotus as a legitimate supercar manufacturer for the next three decades.\n\nThe 1970s forced the automotive industry to rethink everything it knew about performance, and these twelve cars represent different approaches to the same problem. Some went lighter, some went turbo, and some just ignored convention entirely. What they share is that contemporary audiences didn't quite know what to make of them, whether due to unfamiliar technology, unconventional packaging, or simply showing up at the wrong moment in history.\n\nToday, these misunderstood machines are finally getting the recognition they deserved all along, proving that sometimes the automotive press and buying public need a few decades of perspective to separate the genuinely interesting cars from the merely loud ones.",

    "description": "\"During World War II, the British dressed a dead body in a Royal Marines uniform and planted letters saying the Allies were going to invade Greece, and that Sicily was just a decoy. It was called Operation Mincemeat.\"",
    "fullText": "Context: The body used in Operation Mincemeat was that of Glyndwr Michael, a Welsh man who died after ingesting rat poison. He was dressed as \"Captain (Acting Major) William Martin\" of the Royal Marines and planted with fake letters, supposedly written by General Archibald Nye to General Harold Alexander. The letters claimed that Greece and Sardinia were the real invasion targets, with Sicily presented as a decoy.\n\nOn April 30, 1943, the submarine HMS Seraph released the body off the coast of Huelva, Spain, a country closely aligned with Germany. Intercepted German communications later confirmed that the deception worked. In response, Hitler transferred the 1st Panzer Division to Greece, doubled the Sardinian garrison to 10,000 troops, and moved seven infantry divisions away from Italy. The Allied invasion of Sicily, known as Operation Husky, began on July 9, 1943, and succeeded in part because German defenses had been deliberately thinned as a result of the ruse.\n\nContext: In April 1942, soldiers of the Polish 2nd Transport Company (later 22nd Artillery Supply Company) encountered an Iranian boy near Hamadan with an orphaned Syrian brown bear cub. They traded items — reportedly a Swiss Army knife, coins, and rations — for the cub. To circumvent British regulations forbidding mascots on military transport ships, Wojtek was officially enlisted as a private, receiving a serial number and paybook. He was later promoted to corporal. At the Battle of Monte Cassino (May 1944), eyewitnesses reported seeing Wojtek help move crates of artillery ammunition, though debate exists about whether these were live shells or empties. After the war, Wojtek lived at Edinburgh Zoo from 1947 until his death in December 1963.\n\nContext: According to the US Census Bureau's 2007 analysis, Washington ranked #138 among American surnames, with 89.9% of bearers being Non-Hispanic Black (146,520 of 163,036 total). A 2016 Census update showed the percentage remained above 87%. Genealogist Tony Burroughs is widely cited for the 82–94% figure for earlier censuses (1880–1930). However, historians caution that the reasons freedpeople chose this surname varied — some chose it to honor George Washington, while others took the surnames of their former enslavers (white families named Washington). As Burroughs noted: \"It's an assumption that the surname is tied to George... As far as I'm concerned, it's a coincidence.\"\n\nContext: Melbourne was never officially named \"Batmania\" by any government authority. However, the earliest documented use of \"Batmania\" appears in a satirical letter to the Launceston Cornwall Chronicle (June 13, 1835), explicitly mocking John Batman's contested land claims with Aboriginal peoples. The term also appeared on some private maps of the Port Phillip Association, but Police Magistrate George Stewart's 1836 official report called the settlement \"Bearbrass.\" Governor Richard Bourke voided Batman's private treaty (August 1835) and officially named the town \"Melbourne\" on April 10, 1837, after William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne, the British Prime Minister at the time.\n\nContext: During major events, Versailles could accommodate up to 10,000 people, with inadequate sanitation infrastructure for such crowds. Primary sources confirm the problem. Princess Elizabeth Charlotte (Liselotte), Duchess of Orléans, wrote in 1702: \"The people stationed in the galleries in front of our room piss in all the corners. It is impossible to leave one's apartments without seeing somebody pissing.\" However, historian Tony Spawforth notes that Versailles was not entirely devoid of facilities — it had public latrines, private cabinets d'aisance in noble apartments, and received its first flush toilet in 1738. The palace's sanitation problems were real but sometimes exaggerated in popular accounts.\n\nContext: When Israel's first president, Chaim Weizmann, died on November 9, 1952, Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion instructed Ambassador Abba Eban to offer the presidency to Einstein. The formal letter arrived on November 17, 1952. Einstein's written response read: \"I am deeply moved by the offer from our State of Israel, and at once saddened and ashamed that I cannot accept it. All my life I have dealt with objective matters, hence I lack both the natural aptitude and the experience to deal properly with people.\" Ben-Gurion reportedly told an aide: \"Tell me what to do if he says yes! I've had to offer the post because it's impossible not to. But if he accepts, we are in for trouble.\"\n\nContext: The Soviet anti-tank dog program operated from approximately 1930 to 1946. Dogs carried 10–12 kg explosive mines with a wooden lever trigger that would detonate when the dog crawled beneath a tank. Training involved placing food beneath stationary vehicles to condition the dogs. However, training occurred on Soviet diesel-engine tanks, while German tanks used gasoline engines with distinctly different sounds and exhaust smells. During the disastrous first combat deployment in summer 1941, dogs frequently ran toward familiar-smelling Soviet tanks or retreated to trenches — forcing handlers to shoot their own returning animals. The program claimed 300 German tank kills, though historians consider approximately 50 more realistic. Combat use largely ended by 1943, with training schools shifting focus to mine-detection work.\n\nContext: Eight German saboteurs landed by U-boat on US shores in June 1942 — four on Long Island, four in Florida. Two of them, George Dasch and Ernst Burger, had no intention of completing the mission: Dasch considered America his adopted country, and Burger had spent 17 months in a Nazi concentration camp. Shortly after landing, Dasch contacted the FBI, though they were skeptical until he dumped $84,000 in mission funds on an agent's desk. His information led to the capture of all eight within two weeks.\n\nA military tribunal convicted them all. Six were executed by electric chair at the District of Columbia jail on August 8, 1942: Richard Quirin, Heinrich Heinck, Edward Kerling, Werner Thiel, Herbert Haupt, and Hermann Neubauer. Dasch and Burger received prison sentences instead — 30 years and life, respectively — for their cooperation.\n\nThis was the largest federal execution by electric chair, but not the US record overall. Kentucky executed seven men on July 13, 1928, and New York executed seven at Sing Sing on August 12, 1912.\n\nSources: Naval History and Heritage Command, The Times\n\nContext: The scientific evidence for ancient polychromy (painted sculpture) is now overwhelming. Using ultraviolet light, X-ray fluorescence, and Raman spectroscopy, researchers have identified traces of Egyptian blue, cinnabar red, ochre yellow, and malachite green on ancient sculptures. Vinzenz Brinkmann at the Liebieghaus Skulpturensammlung in Frankfurt has been studying this since the 1980s, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art's \"Chroma: Ancient Sculpture in Color\" exhibition (2022–2023) displayed vivid scientific reconstructions. As the Met's chief scientist Marco Leona put it: \"A completely white statue, to a Greek observer, would have looked like some shoddy effort.\"\n\nContext: The Confederate submarine H.L. Hunley sank the USS Housatonic on February 17, 1864, about four miles offshore from Charleston Harbor — the first successful submarine attack in naval history. The hand-cranked, 40-foot vessel used a spar torpedo: a copper cylinder packed with gunpowder mounted on a 22-foot pole. The Housatonic sank in about five minutes, killing five Union sailors. But the Hunley never signaled its return, and all eight crew members perished with it.\n\nWhen the wreck was raised in 2000, it was remarkably intact — no major hull damage, hatches still closed, bilge pumps unused. The crew's skeletons were found still seated at their stations, with no broken bones or signs they'd tried to escape. The mystery lingered for years until Duke researcher Rachel Lance (2017) concluded that the shockwave from their own torpedo — detonated just 16 feet from the bow — transmitted through the hull and caused fatal lung trauma, killing them instantly.\n\nContext: Three major earthquakes struck the New Madrid Seismic Zone between 1811 and 1812: December 16, 1811 (M7.5), January 23, 1812 (M7.3), and February 7, 1812 (M7.5). These destroyed the town of New Madrid, Missouri, toppled chimneys as far as Cincinnati, St. Louis, and Kentucky, and were felt over approximately 1 million square miles. Eyewitness Eliza Bryan wrote of \"the screams of the affrighted inhabitants... the roaring of the Mississippi.\" The February 1812 quake even created Reelfoot Lake in Tennessee when the ground sank by as much as 6 meters.\n\nAs for the 1990 panic, self-proclaimed climatologist Iben Browning predicted a 50% probability of a major earthquake for December 2–3, 1990. Schools across four states closed, businesses shuttered, and the St. Louis Red Cross distributed 230,000 earthquake preparedness kits. Nothing happened. Northwestern geologist Seth Stein called it \"the greatest non-event since 'The War of the Worlds.'\"\n\nContext: The Haitian Revolution was crucial to Napoleon's decision to sell Louisiana. Napoleon sent over 20,000 troops under General Charles Leclerc to reconquer Saint-Domingue, with reinforcements eventually bringing the total to more than 30,000. The vast majority perished — primarily from yellow fever — with fewer than 8,000 surviving. Saint-Domingue had been France's most valuable colony, generating approximately 300 million livres annually. Louisiana was intended as a supply base for Caribbean sugar operations. So without Saint-Domingue, it became strategically worthless. War with Britain was also imminent (it resumed in May 1803), meaning France couldn't defend Louisiana anyway. The $15 million sale (roughly $380 million today) was a strategic reallocation of an indefensible asset, not simple bankruptcy.\n\nContext: The 369th Infantry Regiment was composed of African American soldiers, segregated from the US Army and assigned to the French 16th Division (4th French Army). They spent 191 days under fire — the longest of any American unit — and their record states they \"never lost a foot of ground.\"\n\nThe soldier referenced is Private Henry Johnson. On May 15, 1918, Johnson and fellow soldier Needham Roberts were manning an observation post when a German raiding party of at least 12 attacked. Despite sustaining 21 wounds, Johnson fought them off, primarily with his bolo knife, killing four and wounding others. He was awarded the French Croix de Guerre, but wouldn't receive the US Medal of Honor until 2015, posthumously.\n\nThe regiment suffered approximately 1,500 casualties during the war. After the armistice on November 11, 1918, they became the first Allied unit to reach the Rhine River, arriving on November 20 as occupation forces.\n\nContext: Truman learned about the Manhattan Project shortly after becoming president upon Roosevelt's sudden death in April 1945. He was briefed by Secretary of War Henry Stimson and received detailed information about the bomb's development and potential.\n\nThe more nuanced historical argument, advanced by nuclear historian Alex Wellerstein, is that Truman may have misunderstood Hiroshima's nature — believing it was primarily a military installation rather than a city with a military base. In his July 25, 1945, diary entry, Truman wrote he had ordered the bomb used \"so that military objectives and soldiers and sailors are the target and not women and children.\" On August 9, he stated publicly that \"the first atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, a military base.\"\n\nWellerstein subsequently argues that Truman likely learned the full extent of civilian casualties only on August 8, the day before Nagasaki. On August 10, 1945, Truman ordered that no further atomic bombs be dropped without his express authorization, asserting presidential control over nuclear weapons for the first time. The Atomic Energy Act of 1946 (McMahon Act), signed August 1, 1946, transferred nuclear weapons from military to civilian control and established the Atomic Energy Commission, institutionalizing civilian/presidential authority over nuclear weapons.\n\nContext: Much of what we know comes from two key sources. On the Mediterranean side, The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea (mid-first century CE) was written by a Greek-speaking Egyptian merchant living under Roman rule. While the author himself traveled only as far as India, the text refers to lands farther east, including a place called \"Thinae,\" generally understood to mean China, based on reports circulating through Indian Ocean trade networks.\n\nOn the Chinese side, the Hou Hanshu (Book of the Later Han) records that in 166 CE, envoys claiming to represent \"Andun, king of Daqin\" — likely the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius Antoninus — arrived at the court of Emperor Huan. They came by sea via Rinan (in modern-day Vietnam), bearing luxury goods such as ivory, rhinoceros horn, and tortoise shell. Most historians believe these were not official diplomats but Greco-Roman merchants operating out of Roman Egypt or Syria, traveling through Southeast Asian maritime routes.\n\nAlso in Nifty: These 14 DIY Fails Are Just So, Sooooo Bad (And I'm Laughing So, Sooooo Hard)\n\nAlso in Nifty: People Are Sharing Things You See In Someone Else's Home That Immediately Signal They're Middle Class",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nIllinois Fighting Illini men's basketball coach Brad Underwood saw his team overcome road adversity once again, as it snagged a critical road win Sunday afternoon to extend its winning streak to 11 by overcoming a talented No.5-ranked Nebraska Cornhuskers team, 78-69.\n\nIt wasn't just any win. It's a microcosm of a season marked by raw, elite talent finally gelling together as the season's critical stretch run really gets going. Sunday at Pinnacle Bank Arena in Lincoln was no different, as for the second consecutive weekend, the No.9-ranked Illini took down an AP Top 5 road opponent after doing the same against the Purdue Boilermakers in West Lafayette last Saturday.\n\nIt's the first time the Illini have done so in program history, but it came with a bit of extra motivation that has since begun to circulate in the hours after the revenge win.\n\nMore specifically, the team's whiteboard. There weren't X's and O's, nor was there a diagram explaining the ways Illinois can continue to remain atop a crowded Big Ten title race with a little over a month left in the season.\n\nInstead, it was four simple words: \"Rob the [expletive] bank.\"\n\nWhether it was a jab at the arena's name or otherwise, it certainly seemed to fire up Illinois as it now holds a win against every conference opponent it's played so far.\n\nUnderwood said his players were relaxed and composed in the second half after overcoming a 39-33 halftime deficit. The Illini outscored the Cornhuskers 45-30 in the final 20 minutes, as freshman guard Keaton Wagler finished with 28 points.\n\n“Chemistry and connectivity,\" Underwood told reporters. \"Just the communication… We’ve made huge strides there and we’re competing on every play,” Underwood said.\n\nMORE: Dusty May set the tone before tipoff and Michigan followed\n\nThe Illini are going to attempt to keep their winning streak alive Wednesday night from State Farm Center in Champaign, hosting the Northwestern Wildcats.

    "description": "Top 10: The Second World War Fighters Souped-Up for Extreme Air Racing",
    "fullText": "Reno Air Racing, described as ‘the world’s fastest motorsport’, is a blistering blend of aviation heritage, extreme engineering and thrilling speed.\n\nHeld in the Nevada desert, it pits legendary warbirds against one another in low-level, high-G duels around a pylon course. These aircraft, once icons of combat, are now stripped, clipped and polished to extremes.\n\nEngines are souped-up, wings shortened, cooling systems re-engineered — all in the relentless pursuit of speed. Prop tips blur, exhausts roar, and pilots skim the desert floor, often at over 450 mph. It’s not just racing; it’s the ultimate fusion of history, danger, and adrenaline.\n\nThe Curtiss P-40E Warhawk, famed for its shark-mouthed nose art and rugged wartime service, found a second life roaring over Reno’s desert skies. Once a symbol of wartime grit, it became a rare but thrilling sight among the sleek Mustangs and Bearcats dominating the Unlimited Class air races.\n\nUnlike the supercharged, high-altitude racers built later in the war, the P-40E was a tough, low-to-mid-altitude fighter, never the fastest — but its broad wings, throaty Allison engine, and unmistakable silhouette made it unforgettable. Racers who chose the Warhawk prized its stability and character, favouring heritage over outright performance.\n\nTo compete, mechanics stripped out armour, guns, and unnecessary weight, tuned the Allison V-1710 for maximum output, and polished every inch of its metal to minimise drag. Some even fitted larger props and fuel tweaks, wringing every last knot from its classic frame. The transformation kept the Warhawk’s soul but pushed its limits.\n\nP‑40s have occasionally raced at Reno, often in the Bronze or Unlimited classes. Airframes like Texas Warhawk (2017) reached qualifying speeds near 292 mph, with race speeds around 270 mph.\n\nThe F8F Bearcat was the ultimate example of Grumman’s pantheon of piston-engined naval fighters. The company’s earlier Hellcat had been instrumental in defeating Japan, and the Bearcat was even more potent. Compact, with immaculate handling, the F8F was utterly brilliant.\n\nLong before the Bearcat had entered the realm of racing, it snatched the absolute climb rate record for piston-engined aircraft, whizzing up to 10,000 feet in 94 seconds in 1946. Fast and with a strong structure that lent itself to modification, the Bearcat was a ripe candidate for the Reno races.\n\nRare Bear is a heavily modified Grumman F8F Bearcat, rebuilt by pilot Lyle Shelton from a crashed airframe in 1969 for air racing. Fitted with a powerful Wright R-3350 radial engine producing over 4000 horsepower, it became one of the fastest piston-engine aircraft ever built.\n\nIn 1989, Rare Bear set a 3 km (1.86 mile) world speed record of 528.33 mph (850.26 km/h). With shortened wings, aerodynamic refinements, and distinctive “bear” artwork, it dominated the Unlimited Class at the Reno Air Races.\n\nThere is much debate over what the ultimate piston-engined fighter was; some offer the P-51H, P-47N, or other types for this prestigious, subjective ranking, but the two most common candidates are the American Grumman Bearcat and the British Hawker Sea Fury. This sense of rivalry between these two brilliant radial-engined naval fighters carries on over eighty years after their first flights. Though the Sea Fury did not serve in the war, we will include it as it took its first flight in 1945.\n\nThe Hawker Sea Fury T.Mk 20 Dreadnought began life as a two-seat Royal Navy trainer, designed to familiarise pilots with the high-powered radial engine and handling characteristics of the single-seat fighter variants. When converted for air racing, Dreadnought underwent extensive modifications.\n\nThe rear seat was removed, structural reinforcements were added, and a Pratt & Whitney R‑4360 radial engine, producing around 3,800 hp, replaced the standard powerplant. These changes enabled the aircraft to safely handle extreme speeds and high g-forces on the pylon course while maintaining control over its large airframe.\n\nDreadnought reached qualifying speeds of 452.7 mph (according to unofficial sources) in 1986 and, piloted by Joel Swager in 2018, achieved a Gold Unlimited victory at Reno with a race speed of 417.735 mph. Over its career, it accumulated multiple wins and several second-place finishes, demonstrating remarkable consistency and reliability despite its size. The September Fury is another Hawker Sea Fury turned Reno Unlimited racer.\n\nThe Vought F4U Corsair, (and the Goodyear F2G Super Corsair) is a legendary Second World War naval fighter, famed for its distinctive inverted gull wings and powerful Pratt & Whitney radial engine. It served with the United States Navy and Marines in the Pacific, excelling in both air‑to‑air combat and ground‑attack roles, reaching speeds of around 446 mph in standard military form (we’ve used a wartime Corsair image here).\n\nIts combination of agility, firepower, and durability made it a favourite among pilots and a feared adversary in the skies, cementing its place in aviation history. The Corsair at Reno is a rare and captivating sight, one of the few warbirds of its kind to race in the Unlimited Class. Its presence is significant because very few Corsairs were ever modified or maintained for competitive racing, making it a true gem for air-race enthusiasts.\n\nAt the Reno Air Races, modified Corsairs proved remarkable in the Unlimited Class. The F4U‑derived Super Corsair N31518, piloted by Steve Hinton, won the Unlimited Gold in 1985, averaging 438.186 mph over the eight‑lap course. Goodyear F2G N5588N, known as Race 57, was restored and entered competition in 1999, achieving impressive results.\n\nTheir participation was rare, as few Corsairs were ever adapted for racing, and each airframe brought both historical significance and thrilling performance to the event. The aircraft’s gull wings give it instant charisma. Despite a relative scarcity of usable photographs, the Corsair’s speed rand rarity prestige make it an essential inclusion on our list.\n\n‘Steadfast’ began life as one of a batch of 10 modern Yak-3Us built in the early 2000s in Romania by Avioane Craiova. The original Yak-3U was an experimental Yak-3 development fitted with a radial ASh-82 engine in place of the usual V-12 Klimov which did not enter production but several replicas have been built.\n\nMost replicas destined for owners in the west received R-1830 engines but when Will Whiteside acquired this Yak as an unfinished, engineless, potential racer project, he decided to install a rather more potent Pratt & Whitney R-2000, as fitted to the DC-4, but tuned to deliver 1750hp.\n\nCompared to most Reno racers, 1750hp doesn’t sound that much but the Yak airframe is light, small and streamlined. Steadfast (a name derived from Reno’s Stead airport and the intention to go fast) raced at Reno for six years and attained first place in the Unlimited Silver in 2012.\n\nThe aircraft benefited from significant aerodynamic work to remove drag, it utilises an oversized spinner (from an A-26) and an afterspinner to smooth airflow through the cowling Steadfast ultimately set nine speed and climb records, including the speed record for its class at 416mph. Since 2017 Steadfast has been based in New Zealand.\n\nThe P‑51 Mustang became a common choice for air racers in America due to the large number of surplus airframes available after World War II. Its robust design, high-speed potential, and adaptability made it ideal for conversion into Unlimited Class racers, and “Strega” emerged as one of the most successful and recognisable examples.\n\nStrega, a highly modified P‑51D, dominated the Reno Air Races for decades. Powered by a tuned Packard Merlin engine producing over 3000 hp, it could reach qualifying speeds exceeding 500 mph.\n\nIts aerodynamic refinements, including clipped wings, polished surfaces, and custom cooling systems, allowed it to maintain exceptional control through tight pylon turns at extreme velocities, a key factor in its repeated victories.\n\nOver its racing career, Strega won the Unlimited Gold Class multiple times, often competing head-to-head with other top Mustangs like Dago Red and Precious Metal. Its consistent podium finishes and record-setting laps made it a benchmark in air racing, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining World War 2-era airframes with modern engineering and tuning.\n\nBeyond speed, Strega’s legacy lies in its influence on piston-engine racing. Its dominance highlighted the advantages of the P‑51 platform, inspiring other racers to optimise weight, aerodynamics, and power to compete at the highest levels of the Reno Air Races.\n\nDago Red is a North American P‑51 Mustang (44‑74996) restored as a competitive air racer by Frank Taylor in 1981. Taylor piloted Dago Red to numerous world records and championship victories during the 1980s. In 1983 at Mojave, California, the aircraft set a 15 km world speed record of 517.323 mph, highlighting its extreme performance and engineering.\n\nOver its racing career, Dago Red achieved repeated success at the Reno Air Races, including winning the Gold Unlimited class in 1982. It secured the Thompson Trophy in 2003 with a fastest lap of 512.164 mph and fastest race speed of 507.105 mph.\n\nIn 2001, it recorded the fastest qualifying speed at Reno at 497.797 mph. Across two decades, Dago Red won the National Championship Air Races six times (1982, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2002, and 2003), cementing its reputation as one of the premier piston-engine racers in the world.\n\nThe aircraft is powered by a race-tuned Rolls-Royce Merlin V12, estimated at 3500–3800 hp, driving a four-bladed Hamilton Standard paddle propeller. Its lightweight 7200 lb empty weight and 32 ft wingspan allow it to handle tightly around pylons at extreme speeds. With a maximum speed exceeding 520 mph and a rate of climb of 8,000 ft/min, Dago Red remains a benchmark in air racing, demonstrating the pinnacle of Mustang performance and Taylor’s piloting skill.\n\nThe P‑51XR, known as Precious Metal, was built in 1988 for high-speed air racing and should not be confused with the original P‑51D or the replica Precious Metal II. It is one of the most radical and exciting modified Mustangs ever created, combining a classic airframe with extreme engineering.\n\nIt retained the P‑51 fuselage but incorporated a Rolls‑Royce Griffon 57A engine producing dramatically more horsepower than the original Merlin. To handle the immense torque, it used contra-rotating propellers from an Avro Shackleton (the same Griffon/contra arrangement was tested on the cancelled MB5 fighter), significantly improving stability and allowing pilots to exploit full power without losing control during tight pylon turns at Reno.\n\nThis mighty propulsion system combined with structural reinforcements to cope with the Griffon’s power, made Precious Metal one of the most capable and aggressive piston-engine racers ever built, pushing a WWII-era fighter far beyond its original limits.\n\nIts debut at the 1988 Reno Air Races immediately marked it as a contender, though early mechanical issues limited performance. Over time, it earned multiple podium finishes in the Unlimited Class, including a sixth-place finish in the Gold race. As an intriguing aside, the wartime Martin-Baker MB5 also adopted a Griffon/contra arrangement, a spectacular fighter prototype that did not enter production.\n\nThe Red Baron, a heavily modified P‑51D Mustang (NX7715C / 44‑84961), became one of the most iconic competitors in the Reno Air Races. Originally entered under various names, including Race #5 “Miss RJ” and “Roto‑Finish,” it was later reborn as Red Baron, with extensive modifications to maximise speed and performance.\n\nFrom its earliest appearances in 1966, the aircraft demonstrated competitive potential, qualifying 10th at 283.770 mph and finishing 5th in the consolation race at 304.990 mph. By 1968, Red Baron had established itself as a serious contender, qualifying 1st at 379.650 mph and finishing 2nd in the championship race at 386.852 mph. Subsequent years saw further improvements, and by 1971 it qualified 1st at 419.501 mph, finishing 4th in the championship at 412.101 mph.\n\nThe aircraft’s performance improvements came from detailed engineering modifications: the airframe was lightened by removing non-essential equipment, the Rolls-Royce Merlin engine was race-tuned to over 3,500 hp, and aerodynamic refinements—including a custom four-blade Hamilton Standard propeller, polished surfaces, and modified control surfaces—reduced drag while increasing stability through tight pylon turns.\n\nThough we have focused on the hardware, the pilot skills demonstrated by the Reno pilots is masterly. Competitors needed precise throttle management and exacting handling to safely maintain speeds exceeding 400 mph near the ground. Red Baron’s consistent podium finishes and record-setting laps cemented its place as one of the most formidable Unlimited Class racers in Reno history.\n\nThe North American P‑51D Mustang Voodoo, piloted by Steve Hinton Jr., is widely recognised as the fastest piston‑engine propeller aircraft in the world. Its record-breaking performance at the Reno Air Races showcased the incredible potential of carefully modified warbirds. Every detail, from aerodynamics to engine tuning, was optimised for sheer speed.\n\nOn 2 September 2017, Voodoo achieved an astonishing average speed of 531.64 mph (855.59 km/h) over the three‑kilometre course. This feat required not only a meticulously prepared aircraft but a pilot of extraordinary skill and courage.\n\nThe Mustang’s balance of power, control, and agility made it perfect for the tight, high-speed turns of Reno’s Unlimited Class racing. Voodoo's crowning moment came in 1972, when it won the championship race at 416.160 mph.\n\nLater modifications, including a Rolls‑Royce Griffon engine and contra‑rotating propellers, pushed the aircraft to new extremes, achieving 1st-place qualifying at 427 mph and winning the championship at 415 mph in 1978.\n\nFollow Joe Coles on Substack, Twitter X  or Blue Sky.

    "description": "BBC Sport Wales looks at key moments in the history of the world third oldest football association, formed in Wrexham on 2 February, 1876.",
    "fullText": "It is perhaps little wonder that Wrexham can feel like the centre of Welsh football given it was the birthplace of the Football Association of Wales (FAW).\n\nOn 2 February, 1876 only the third football association in the world was formed following a meeting at the town's Wynnstay Arms Hotel.\n\nLlewelyn Kendrick, a solicitor, was appointed chairman with Hawley Edwards taking the role of treasurer.\n\nA century and a half later the FAW is unrecognisable from the association established in the three story Georgian red-brick hotel that still stands in the centre of Wrexham today.\n\nBBC Sport Wales looks back at the most significant moments in the association's history.\n\n'Welsh wizard' Wilson targets Europe and World Cup\n\nA warrior touched by tragedy - Terry Yorath obituary\n\nFAW chief executive Mooney extends contract to 2030\n\nFounded three years after the Scottish Football Association (SFA) and 13 after the FA in England, the FAW is the third oldest football association in the world.\n\nSome seven weeks later - on 25 March, 1876 - the Wales men's team played their first international match, losing 4-0 away to Scotland at Partick.\n\nA year later, Scotland travelled to Wrexham and beat Wales 2-0 in their first home international at the Racecourse Ground - now named Stok Cae Ras - which remains the oldest international football stadium still in use.\n\nWales had to wait four years until 1881 for their first victory when John Vaughan scored the only goal to clinch a 1-0 win over England in Blackburn.\n\nThe 1950s marked a golden era for the Wales men's team, featuring iconic players such as John and Mel Charles, Ivor Allchurch, Cliff Jones, Trevor Ford and Terry Medwin.\n\nWorld Cup qualification was achieved for the first time in 1958 following a defeat of Israel in a play-off.\n\nThe tournament was held in Sweden and Wales faced the hosts, Mexico and Hungary in the group stages.\n\nAll three Wales group games ended level, but Jimmy Murphy's side booked a place in the quarter-finals with a play-off win against Hungary.\n\nGoals from Allchurch and Medwin set up a tie against Brazil, but Wales would be without their talisman John Charles who was injured in the game after some ferocious treatment from the Hungarians.\n\nA 17-year-old Pele scored the only goal as Brazil won the quarter-final 1-0 but almost 70 years on Welsh football fans still wonder what might have been had Charles lined up to face Brazil.\n\nIt took more than a century for the FAW to formally recognise a women's national team.\n\nInitially established in 1973, the team received no support from the FAW as players were forced to arrange their own training sessions and matches as well as funding it themselves.\n\nA crowd of around 3,500 witnessed their first fixture against the Republic of Ireland in Llanelli, and saw Wales play in kits borrowed from Swansea City's men's team.\n\nWearing shirts several sizes too big for them, Gaynor Blackwell and Gloria O'Connell scored the side's first goals in a 3-2 defeat.\n\nTwo decades passed before the FAW would take official control of the women's side.\n\nIn 1993 players Laura McAllister, Michele Adams and Karen Jones successfully persuaded association secretary Alun Evans to finally take responsibility for the Wales women's team.\n\nConcerns over Wales' status as an independent football nation grew in the 1980s which many felt threatened the very existence of the FAW.\n\nLeading Welsh clubs competed in the English pyramid system, and the absence of a national domestic league was a source of indignation to many FIFA members.\n\nIn response, the League of Wales was formed in 1992.\n\nSome clubs, including Newport County, Merthyr Town and Colwyn Bay rejected an invitation to join and were forced to play their non-league league matches in the English system outside Wales.\n\nTwenty teams took part in the inaugural season of the new League of Wales and Cwmbran were crowned the first champions.\n\nSince 1992 the league has undergone several changes and is now known as the Cymru Premier, featuring 12 teams.\n\nThe New Saints are the competition's most successful club and have won the title on 17 occasions.\n\nThe summer of 2016 is immortalised in Welsh football folklore.\n\nWales had not qualified for a major international tournament since the World Cup of 1958 in Sweden.\n\nEuro 2016 in France gave a squad dubbed the 'golden generation' an opportunity to shine on the international stage.\n\nStars such as Gareth Bale, Aaron Ramsey, Joe Allen and captain Ashley Williams led a squad of players to the summer of their lives.\n\nWales topped a group containing Slovakia, England and Russia, before beating Northern Ireland in Paris in the last 16.\n\nIn the quarter-finals they faced one of the tournament favourites, Belgium, in Lille.\n\nHal Robson-Kanu scored one of the most iconic goals in Wales' history in a 3-1 win that ranks as one of the best results in the 150 year history of Welsh international football.\n\nWithout the suspended Ramsey and Ben Davies, Wales were beaten by eventual Euro 2016 winners Portugal.\n\nCristiano Ronaldo scored twice in the semi-final in Lyon, but Euro 2016 remains a defining chapter for the national side.\n\nQualification for Euro 2025 marked a landmark moment for women's football in Wales.\n\nHead coach Rhian Wilkinson and her players secured their place in Welsh footballing history by reaching a major international tournament finals for the first time.\n\nThe tournament was held in Switzerland and Wales faced world class opponents in the group stage.\n\nHeavy defeats to the Netherlands, France and England on the pitch were countered by some unforgettable moments including the singing of the national anthem before the opening match against the Netherlands, Jess Fishlock's goal against France and the passionate support of the Red Wall.\n\nThe hope now is that Euro 2025 will inspire more girls and women to take up the sport in Wales.\n\nEarly signs are encouraging, with more than 20,000 girls and women now registered to play football.\n\nThe next target is qualification for the 2027 Women's World Cup, as Wales look to add another memorable chapter to the story of the national team.\n\n'World Cup could earn millions for Welsh grassroots'\n\n'We have so much to thank Terry for' -

    "fullText": "HONG KONG (AP) — China has been flooding Latin American markets with low-priced exports, especially autos and e-commerce goods, as its exporters adjust to U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs and geopolitical moves.\n\nThe world’s second-largest economy has become a major trading partner for many Latin American nations, seeking access to their abundant natural resources and growing markets while expanding its influence in a region Trump views as America’s Backyard.\n\nChinese businesses face slow demand at home. They need new markets for their products as the country ramps up production in many industries. Exports to Latin America, a market of more than 600 million people, and other regions have climbed while exports to the U.S. fell by 20% last year.\n\n“Latin America has a solid middle class, relatively high purchasing power and real demand,” said Margaret Myers, director of the Asia and Latin America program at the Inter-American Dialogue think tank in Washington. “Those conditions make it one of the easiest places for China to offload its excess industrial production.”\n\nThe influx of made-in-China cars, clothing, electronics and home furnishings has rankled countries trying to build their own globally competitive industries. Some, such as Mexico, Chile and Brazil, have raised tariffs or taken other measures to protect their local industries.\n\nCheap e-commerce goods gain market share\n\nCheap goods from China are welcome news for many Latin American consumers, but they’re a headache for local businesses.\n\nChinese e-commerce platforms, led by Temu and Shein, have accelerated that trend.\n\n“I use Temu all the time, whether to buy clothes or household items. The same things I would find in brand-name stores or shopping malls, I find on Temu at a much lower price,” said Chilean restaurant manager Lady Mogollon.\n\nTemu averaged 114 million monthly active users in Latin America in the first half of 2025, a 165% increase year-on-year from 2024, market intelligence company Sensor Tower estimates. Shein’s monthly active users in the region grew 18%.\n\nT-shirts, jackets, pants, toys, watches and furniture and more products made in China fill the stalls of street vendors in downtown Mexico City.\n\nÁngel Ramírez, manager of a downtown lamp shop, is struggling to compete.\n\n“The Chinese have invaded us in terms of merchandise,” said Ramírez, sitting behind the counter of his completely deserted store.\n\nOver the past few years the number of shops selling Chinese-made goods in Mexico City ’s downtown has more than tripled, Ramírez said, in some cases putting long-established Mexican stores out of business.",

The Sri Lankan spinners keep it nice and straight so you've got to hit it.\"\n\nHis chance here came courtesy of Ben Duckett nursing a finger injury and England will now have a decision to make for the World Cup.\n\nAnother decent outing in the final T20 on Tuesday and it could be Banton's place in the middle to lose.\n\n\"I think most of my career I've been opening. I've got a new role with England which is exciting,\" Banton added.\n\n\"I just want to try and play all formats and hopefully take my chance when I get it.\"\n\nEncouragingly for England on the eve of a subcontinental T20 World Cup, their spin department is holding up well.\n\nA combined 12 overs yielded three wickets for 81 runs at an economy rate of 6.75, a return that underlined their growing control and reliability.\n\nRashid remains the ace in the pack, capable of stifling momentum and producing breakthroughs at key moments.\n\nThe experienced leg-spinner's googly may have been well studied by opposition batters, but it remains a potent weapon, as Sri Lanka captain Dasun Shanaka discovered when he was trapped lbw slogging to leg.\n\nDawson's left-arm spin provided much-needed control through the middle overs, slowing down his speeds to left vs right handers, while Jacks continues to mature as a bowling option, and used his angles well.\n\nBrook has plenty of options to turn to even when the pitch does not spin big.\n\nA slight concern for England, with just under a week to go before a major tournament, was that their seam bowling did not quite hit the mark.\n\nThat caveat comes with the acknowledgement that the surface at the Pallekele International Cricket Stadium was a used one, offering little margin for error.\n\nNevertheless Jamie Overton struggled with his length, while Curran, fresh from an expensive hat-trick in the opening T20, surprisingly lacked conviction after conceding 14 from his first over.\n\nArcher fared slightly better, picking up two wickets despite being targeted early on, with Nissanka launching him out of the ground in his opening over.\n\nArcher, however, recovered well to bowl effectively at the death as Sri Lanka pushed for a total in excess of 200.\n\nEngland captain Harry Brook: \"I thought we played outstanding there, especially with the bat. To win the series is awesome.\n\n\"I think the more time we get out in the middle puts us into good shape for the World Cup. The way Banton played there was great. There's plenty of batters in there. We just go out there and chase.\n\n\"The spinners have been awesome, that's why we decided to pick two frontline spinners, to help restrict those runs in the middle.\"\n\nSri Lanka skipper Dasun Shanaka: \"We did a lot of things right. It's not the rain, but the fact that Eshan Malinga got injured played a part. Normally he's a very good death bowler but we lost him so there's a reason [for the loss].\n\n\"Every batter got starts so happy about the way they played and accelerated. There were a few overs where we couldn't capitalise but Adil Rashid bowled well.\n\n\"We know that because we've played on spin tracks the past two years. It's the home advantage so no doubt about it we need to use that.\"\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "description": "“All [camels] know in the desert [is] if it's not sand, it's food.\"",
    "fullText": "Plastic pollution is an enormous global problem, and a lot of focus has been rightly placed on the devastating effects that plastic is having on our oceans and marine life. But plastic pollution on land is a big problem, too, as experts have recently been reminded when they started discovering giant blobs of the stuff inside the stomachs of dead camels.\n\nCalifornia-based environmental scientist Marcus Eriksen and United Arab Emirates (UAE)-based veterinary microbiologist Ulrich Wernery co-authored an article titled \"The plight of camels eating plastic waste.\"\n\nEriksen described one autopsy as \"the most surreal thing in the world,\" and their findings showed that plastic clumps called polybezoars, which Eriksen said \"range from the size of a basketball to roughly a large suitcase,\" are responsible for 1% of the camel deaths in the UAE\n\n\"All [camels] know in the desert [is] if it's not sand, it's food,\" Eriksen said. \"If they see a plastic bag stuck in a tree … or stuck against a fence, they might think, 'Oh, that's a novel piece of food,' and they'll consume it.\"\n\nThe effects of eating plastic are devastating for the camels, causing intestinal blockages, creating lacerations inside their stomachs, and creating a toxic environment for bacteria to grow amid the folds of the plastic.\n\n\"It's a slow death,\" Eriksen said. \"Imagine if you had five plastic bags crushed up in your body, and maybe a dozen bottle caps and a few straws, and it stayed there for years. I mean, you would suffer until you'd ultimately perish from that ingested trash. And that's what the camels are experiencing.\"\n\nCamels are not the only land animals facing this challenge, either. A sick bear in Colorado was recently euthanized and found to have plastic waste blocking its digestive system. Plastic waste consumption also killed two elephants in Sri Lanka.\n\nAs plastic waste causes more and more animal deaths, there is some hope that public pressure will cause governments to regulate it more heavily. Canada banned single-use plastics in 2021, and other places, such as Massachusetts, have taken similar steps.\n\nAs far as steps we can take to reduce our plastic consumption in our regular lives, we can make sure we understand how to recycle as effectively as possible and shun single-use plastics by using things like reusable water bottles.\n\nJoin our free newsletter for weekly updates on the coolest innovations improving our lives and saving our planet.",

    "fullText": "HONG KONG/BEIJING, Jan 30 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Keir Starmer's visit to China is the latest win Beijing can tout in its rivalry with Washington, but the deals he brings back to London also show the limits of the balancing act that middle powers may try to play.\n\nHe follows Canadian counterpart Mark ​Carney, who struck a trade deal on a similar visit weeks ago, before heading to Davos to herald a new global trade order as U.S. President Donald Trump disrupts long-standing ties with ‌allies.\n\nEuropean leaders have also visited, as have India's Narendra Modi and others since Trump began his second term a year ago, but it is less clear what tangible long-term economic and security benefits such visits yield for Western powers.\n\n\"Traditional U.S. allies feel hard done ‌by and are now hedging their bets, but they are far from being able or willing to substitute China for the United States,\" said John Quelch, an expert in global strategy at Duke Kunshan University.\n\nFrom the perspective of London, Ottawa and other Western capitals, the visits demonstrate to Trump that alternatives exist if he keeps up pressure on issues from Greenland to renegotiating the USMCA trade deal among the United States, Canada and Mexico.\n\nBut these are \"superficial gestures amid stalled global growth,\" said Alicia Garcia-Herrero, chief Asia-Pacific economist at Natixis.\n\n\"These visits highlight the severe limits of any 'pivot' to China,\" she said. \"They expose middle powers' vulnerability, chasing scraps while China's export flood overwhelms their industries.\"\n\nAnd they ⁠benefit Beijing, by supporting the narrative of a broad pivot to China ‌as the world's \"reliable partner\", in contrast with Trump's chaotic tariff policies and his growing list of threats and demands towards partners and rivals alike.\n\n\"President Trump’s efforts to decouple the United States from China are also decoupling the United States from the world,\" Quelch added.\n\nSTARMER SCORES WINS ON VISAS, WHISKY\n\nThe deals clinched by Western powers on such ‍visits come in return for deeper integration with a country that ran a trade surplus the size of the Dutch economy last year but where consumption is too weak for even its own producers to prosper at home.\n\nOn his trip to the world's second largest economy, Starmer secured 30-day visa-free access for Britons travelling to China and lower tariffs on whisky, while British drugmaker AstraZeneca unveiled a $15 billion investment in China.\n\nHe got nothing beyond \"frank dialogue\" on tension arising from China's ​increasingly assertive stance on Taiwan, its stronger ties with Russia after the Ukraine invasion and a rights crackdown on Britain's former colony of Hong Kong.\n\nBritish and U.S. politicians who criticised Starmer's trip also aired accusations ‌of espionage and human rights abuse, which Beijing denies.\n\nSimilarly, Carney left China with expectations that Beijing will cut or drop tariffs on canola, lobsters, crabs and peas, but that triggered threats of 100% tariffs from Trump, who warned Ottawa about allowing Chinese EVs into North America.\n\nAnd even before Starmer has wrapped up his China visit, Trump warned Britain it was dangerous to get into business with Beijing, after the prime minister extolled the economic benefits of resetting relations with China.\n\nCHINA'S EXPORT-DRIVEN GROWTH POSES RISKS FOR WEST\n\nChina's imports last year were flat at $2.6 trillion, but they were largely driven by energy and commodities from emerging markets, rather than the West.\n\nIts trade surplus, however, jumped a fifth, to a record $1.2 trillion, as its manufacturers responded to Trump's tariff measures by muscling into virtually every other market in the world, at the expense of domestic producers.\n\nSuch a ⁠pace of growth puts China's trade surplus on track to roughly reach the size of the $3-trillion French economy by 2030 and ​the $5-trillion German economy by 2033.\n\nIts exports to the European Union last year jumped 8.4%, while imports dipped 0.4%. China shipped 7.8% ​more to Britain, while buying 4.7% less. With Canada, sales grew 3.2% while purchases plunged 10.4%.\n\n\"This makes it an especially risky proposition for countries trying to protect or grow their own manufacturing industries to substantially increase trade integration with China,\" said Eswar Prasad, a former China director at the International Monetary Fund.\n\n\"China hardly provides a safe harbour for ‍countries trying to cope with the adverse economic effects ⁠of U.S. tariffs,\" added Prasad, who now teaches trade policy at Cornell University.\n\nStill, say some analysts, significant trade wins with China may not be as important - or even realistic - for countries such as Britain or Canada right now.\n\nResetting ties may be the best they can get, but that could still be valuable, as previous deterioration in relations exposed critical supply chain dependencies on China.\n\nThe Asian ⁠giant's trade countermeasures helped to widen two-way trade imbalances, rather than narrow them, analysts said.\n\nThe visits by Starmer and Carney are \"a propaganda coup for Beijing,\" said Noah Barkin, Europe-China expert at the German Marshall Fund and Rhodium Group, while warning, \"This is not a ‌pivot to China. It is about reducing tension with Beijing.\"\n\nHe added, \"No country wants to be in open conflict with the two superpowers at the same time.\"\n\n(Additional reporting by Liangping Gao ‌and Kevin Yao in Beijing and David Kirton in Shenzhen; Writing by Marius Zaharia; Editing by Clarence Fernandez)",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe NBA All-Star game is changing once again.\n\nThe league has tinkered with different formats throughout the past few years, trying to inject excitement into a game that has lost its luster. Their latest change is the most dramatic. This year's game will feature a theme of America versus the World. The hope is that it adding an element of national pride will lead to more competitive play.\n\nNOH: My projected All-Star reserves for 2026\n\nThis year's game will feature a round robin tournament between two American teams and one World team. Each team will consist of at least eight players. Participants from both the Eastern and Western conference will be mixed among all three teams.\n\nIn the event that the 24 All-Stars are not divided evenly between 16 Americans and eight international players, commissioner Adam Silver will select players to the game until each team can field at least eight players. That may result in some teams that have more players than others.\n\nThere will be four games in total played, with each game lasting 12 minutes. In the round-robin tournament, Team A will play Team B in Game 1.  The winning team from Game 1 will take on Team C in Game 2, followed by the losing team of Game 1 meeting Team C in Game 3.\n\nAfter Game 3, the top two teams by record will advance to face each other in the championship game (Game 4).  If all three teams have a 1-1 record after Game 3, the tiebreaker would be point differential in each team’s two round-robin games.\n\nMORE: The 11 worst contracts in the NBA, based on my salary tool\n\nThe reserves will be announced on Sunday, Feb. 1.\n\nThe starters, who will be divided up among the three teams (two American, one World), have been announced and are as follows:\n\nAll-Star Weekend will take place from Friday, Feb. 13 to Sunday, Feb. 15. The event will be hosted at Intuit Dome in Inglewood, California, home of the Clippers. The schedule is as follows:\n\nNBA All-Star Celebrity Game, 7 p.m. ET (ESPN)\n\nNBA Rising Stars Game, 9 p.m. ET (Peacock)\n\nNBA HBCU Classic (Hampton University vs. North Carolina A&T State University), 11 p.m. ET (Peacock)\n\nNBA All-Star Saturday Night, 5 p.m. ET (NBC & Peacock)\n\nNBA All-Star Game, 5 p.m. ET (NBC & Peacock)",

    "description": "As US-Canada relations grow rocky, Canada is rethinking its economy, its alliances, and its place on the world stage under Mark Carney.",
    "fullText": "It's a best-of-times, worst-of-times scenario for Canada on the global stage.\n\nTo get the bad out of the way, its most important ally — the United States — has grown increasingly antagonistic, with renewed tariff threats and talk of annexation coming from the White House. On the upside, Canada is signaling it can stand more firmly on its own. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has identified a \"rupture\" in North American integration and is moving his country in a more self-sufficient direction — both economically and politically. There's a recognition that Canada and the US will always be deeply intertwined — Americans aren't suddenly going to stop watching \"Heated Rivalry\" or \"Schitt's Creek,\" and the Toronto Maple Leafs aren't going to stop traveling south of the border — but some level of unwinding may now be unavoidable.\n\n\"Every country has to take care of itself,\" says Tony Stillo, director of Canada Economics at Oxford Economics, \"and Canada's putting Canada first.\"\n\nIn a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos in January, Carney struck a determined, defiant tone toward the US and a decades-old rules-based international order that, in his view, is now falling apart. \"Canadians know that our old comfortable assumptions that our geography and alliance memberships automatically conferred prosperity and security — that assumption is no longer valid,\" he said. In turn, he's made the choice to take on \"the world as it is, not wait around for a world we wish it to be.\"\n\nCarney is walking a fine line. He is right that the US is no longer as reliable a partner as it once was in the economy, security, and trade. And as much as President Donald Trump has turned the divide into a chasm, the fracture has been forming for years, as both Democratic and Republican administrations in the US have taken a more protectionist stance.\n\nAt the same time, Canada can't just walk away. Exports account for a third of Canada's GDP, and more than 75% of its exports go to the US. By comparison, exports are about one-tenth of the US's GDP, and around 16% of its exports go to Canada. Many of the two countries' biggest industrial sectors, including automotives and energy, are almost irreversibly interwoven. The uncertainty emanating from the US has a big impact on Canada's economy — as the saying goes, when the US catches a cold, Canada gets the flu.\n\nThere is also a short-term impetus to keep relations amicable. The US-Mexico-Canada trade deal (formerly known as NAFTA) is up for review mid-year, and the US, thanks to its sheer size, has more leverage.\n\n\"The prime minister's in an impossible situation. It is incredibly challenging for any Canadian on the international side right now to both vigorously defend our economy and to do that without escalating an already volatile relationship,\" says Dan Kelly, the president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business. \"The pope himself, I think, would struggle to find the patience to deal with the US administration right now.\"\n\nCanada is trying to reduce its reliance on the US through a series of policies aimed at growing and integrating its domestic economy. The federal government removed internal trade barriers that prevented goods and even workers from flowing between provinces. The IMF estimates that fully eliminating them would boost real Canadian GDP by 7%. Many Canadian consumers are opting to buy Canadian products where possible. Under Carney, the country established the Major Projects Office as part of a push to advance nation-building ventures and streamline regulatory approvals for ambitious programs in mining, energy, ports, and rail.\n\n\"The government isn't trying to just invest, they're trying to catalyze and incentivize private money to come in,\" Stillo says.\n\nThese are steps in the right direction, but the major projects will take years to build. This is a long-term undertaking.\n\n\"We have high-talent workers. We're the most educated in the OECD. We have real innovation in areas like AI and quantum computing, and we have natural resources — critical minerals, LNG, oil and gas — most countries would absolutely love to have,\" says Matthew Holmes, the chief of public policy at the Canadian Chamber of Commerce. \"We have all the preconditions to be an energy superpower and a major player economically, but we need to get our domestic economy fundamentals.\"\n\nKelly tells me about a third of CFIB's members, which are small- and medium-sized businesses, have started to do more business internationally in countries beyond the US, and a third are doing more internal trade. A recent business survey from the Bank of Canada found that sentiment remains \"subdued,\" though firms' overall outlook has improved slightly.\n\nPart of the problem Canada faces is that any move it makes to cultivate ties elsewhere may elicit an outsize reaction from its neighbors to the south. Just look at its recent trade negotiations with China. Carney visited China in January and subsequently announced that Canada would allow 49,000 Chinese electric vehicles into the Canadian market at a 6.1% tariff rate, while China agreed to lower tariffs on Canadian canola seed. When Trump caught wind of it, he threatened to put 100% tariffs on Canadian goods coming into the US. Canada has tried to calm the situation, emphasizing that it's not entering a free trade agreement with China, it's just settling some preexisting disputes. The tit-for-tat also comes as Canadian oil sales in China surge, as it pushes into Asia.\n\n\"We're not running into the arms of China,\" says Julian Karaguesian, a course lecturer in McGill University's economics department. \"We're just looking to take a couple of eggs out of this basket and spread them around the world. And China's the largest economy in the world after the United States.\"\n\nCanada has trade opportunities outside the US and has set a goal to double non-US exports over the next decade. It already has a robust set of free trade agreements and is the only G7 nation to have them with all other G7 members. It's also likely looking toward India and MERCOSUR, a trade bloc in South America.\n\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has downplayed the ongoing spat, calling it \"political noise\" coming out of the prime minister. He said Canada has the \"second-best deal in the world\" with the US, behind Mexico. Lutnick also indicated that getting too close to China could hurt Canada amid the USMCA talks set for the summer and create a \"road map\" for overhauling the entire deal. Given the constantly changing nature of the US and Canada's relationship as of late — and Trump's ever-shifting focus on a variety of issues — the possible scenarios for USMCA negotiations run the gamut, from minor adjustments to a total breakdown in talks.\n\n\"With USMCA, the gloves are going to be off,\" Karaguesian says.\n\nNone of this is to say that Canada is in sterling shape. Its economy is growing at a lackluster pace, and its labor market is doing OK, but not great. Productivity has been lagging for years. It would surely prefer the US were not so adversarial. At the same time, the country and its leaders are clear-eyed about what's happened and are laying out a plan for what's next, internationally and domestically. Holmes, from the Chamber of Commerce, says Canada has had a sort of \"it's the economy, stupid\" moment under Carney.\n\nPeter Morrow, an economist at the University of Toronto, says that Canada is doing better than was feared a year ago. \"There were a lot of concerns about dramatic levels of protectionism in the United States and all but complete collapses of manufacturing in Canada,\" he says. \"The realized tariffs have not been as dramatic as they might have been otherwise,\" he says. The effective tariff rate on Canadian goods coming into the US is still under 10%. Carney has a \"very good relationship with reality,\" Morrow says, and as much as economic nightmare scenarios haven't come to pass, the geopolitical outlook is worse than expected, given the instability of the NATO alliance and the deterioration of the global rules-based system that's been in place since World War II.\n\nMost of the economists and business people I spoke to for this story agreed that Canada coming into its own was a long time in the making. From Bush's \"you're with us or against us\" mentality post-9/11 to Obama's \"Buy America\" push to Biden's industrial policy, America has been acting like a less friendly friend for a while. Trump has taken it to an extreme, often failing to differentiate between international friend and foe. If it nudges Canada further out of America's shadow, the thinking goes, so be it. Carney's declaration that the global economy's middle powers need to band together and his suggestion that the US cannot be trusted is a sentiment he's not alone in — he's just saying it out loud.\n\n\"Carney is saying things that obviously encapsulate well how many, many countries, companies, and leaders are feeling, including many parts in many parts of the United States,\" Kelly says, adding that Carney's economic background and focus are also a plus. \"For a decade, anything economic was kind of issue number 500 on the Trudeau government's list of priorities. And now it seems very much like ensuring our economy is in high gear is the top job for the prime minister.\"\n\nOne of the main pieces of certainty Canada can have, at least in the immediate future, is that there's going to be a lot of uncertainty coming from the US. In many ways, America has become a threat actor and cause of decline. This has fostered a novel level of pro-Canadian sentiment within the country's borders and also boosted Carney's profile on the international and domestic stage — his approval rating jumped to 60% in a recent poll.\n\nThis is also landing at what's culturally a bright moment for Canada. Canada's men's hockey team is favored to win gold at the coming Winter Olympics, following up its victory in 2025's Four Nations tournament. Its women's team will likely be in contention for a medal as well. The gay hockey romance \"Heated Rivalry,\" out of Ontario, is everywhere. Tourists are turning up in Hamilton, Ontario, where the show is partially filmed, to check out some of the spots featured. The town is inviting them in.\n\n\"All these kinds of things to brand Canada's reputation as a welcoming place to everyone is not unhelpful,\" Kelly says. Especially as the US is moving in a different and much more unwelcoming direction.\n\nEmily Stewart is a senior correspondent at Business Insider, writing about business and the economy.",

    "description": "Courtney Kinnare's art career has taken off since moving from LA to NYC. But in one of the most expensive cities in the world, it comes at a cost.",
    "fullText": "A couple of years out of college and in the midst of a pandemic, Courtney Kinnare took several big risks. The Californian quit her job in sustainable packaging design in Los Angeles, became a full-time artist, and moved to New York City.\n\n\"I just took the leap,\" said Kinnare, now 29. \"I was just like, if I go for it, I have no choice but to make it work out.\"\n\nShe wasn't totally prepared for what it would cost her. When Kinnare moved across the country in 2021, New York City rents began to rise as many others returned after the pandemic. Like many artists, she pays double rent — for her apartment and her studio — and her income swings dramatically, making it hard to budget.\n\nAt the same time, living in New York has turbocharged Kinnare's career. She's constantly meeting gallery owners, seeing new art, and getting exposure to new customers. But while her income has more than doubled in a few years, she often works seven days a week — and the money she makes doesn't go very far.\n\nKinnare is among a growing share of New Yorkers struggling to afford life in one of the most expensive cities in the world, as the costs of necessities like housing, groceries, and childcare soar. For decades, the city has failed to build enough new homes, creating a severe shortage that has driven up rents and home prices.\n\nNew York City's new mayor, Zohran Mamdani, got elected on a pledge to bring these costs down, including for artists. In January, he promised to \"make New York affordable to make the arts,\" and said his administration would also make arts and culture more accessible for working-class people. He's facing a dismal trend. After years of growth in the creative industries, the city has lost a significant number of artists since the pandemic.\n\n\"I've always been able to figure it out,\" Kinnare said, but, \"every month I'm like, 'Okay, how am I making money this month?'\"\n\nWhen she first arrived in the city, Kinnare spent $2,000 on rent for a two-bedroom apartment in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn that she also used as her art studio. Eventually, she moved in with two roommates and rented a separate studio, where she had more room to grow her craft.\n\nLast year, she moved in with her partner, and spends about $1,000 a month for her share of the $2,600 rent for their Bed-Stuy loft, and another $1,700 on her studio space in Dumbo.\n\nOver the last few years, she's steadily grown her art sales and income, which started around $50,000 a year when she first moved to the city, and last year exceeded $100,000. That's in part because one of her products — a $45 purse hook — took off late last year. She quickly sold out of her first 1,500 hooks, made of metal, glass, abalone shell, and mother-of-pearl, and designed to hang a bag from a restaurant table or bar. She recently dropped 2,000 more and hopes to make them a permanent part of her collection.\n\nDespite her recent windfall, budgeting is tricky with an income that varies dramatically month to month. \"I don't have family money to fall back on, or anyone to ask to borrow money from,\" she says.\n\nIt's taken a toll on Kinnare's social life, especially with friends who work corporate jobs and like to go out. She says she skips dinners out and has made a concerted effort to surround herself with other artists who understand the reality of having an unreliable income and the lifestyle that comes with it.\n\n\"Sometimes you blink your eyes and spend $100, and you're like, what just happened?\" she says. \"That's taken a lot of self-control to be able to find activities and things to do that don't require spending money.\"\n\nWhen factoring in the cost of living, New York creative workers like Kinnare earn about 23% less than the national average, a recent report by the nonprofit Center for an Urban Future found. A decade ago, they earned 15% less than the average. Much of that has to do with pricier real estate. With tighter living quarters in the city, many artists rent a separate studio space to work on their craft.\n\nFinding a studio space with enough room and natural light was even harder than finding an apartment, Kinnare says. When she was forced to move out of one studio on short notice, she struggled to find anything affordable on the market that had a window. So she resorted to messaging artists she didn't know on Instagram, asking for their landlords' contact information. \"It's a really, really fast game, and you have to be on top of it,\" she said.\n\nKinnare sees the high cost of living in New York City as an investment in her career that, so far, is paying off. She thinks it's easier to break into the art world than it was in LA, where she felt more professionally isolated.\n\n\"The art scene here is a lot more diverse and approachable,\" she said. \"I'm frequenting galleries a lot more, going to openings, going to shows, being in places where I want to be, networking and seeing and having the chance to talk to some of these people.\"\n\n\"The exposure here has been tenfold compared to what I've been used to,\" she added.\n\nLast year, she signed with a gallery after meeting their owners at a design fair and has since shown her work at multiple fairs with them.\n\nStill, the costs of breaking into the most dynamic creative scene in the country are high — and a growing number of creatives aren't making it. Many artists who left New York when COVID hit haven't returned. The number of New Yorkers working in the creative economy, including self-employed people, has dropped by about 6% since 2019, the Center for an Urban Future found. The city has lost nearly one-fifth of its dancers and film and video editors. More than a quarter of its fashion designers have disappeared.\n\nKinnare feels like one of the lucky ones. Her sales and social media following are growing, and she finally has some savings. One of her goals for 2026 is to give herself one day a week when she doesn't open her laptop or step inside the studio.\n\n\"I feel like I'm finally, after four years, at a place where I can breathe a little bit, but the grind never stops,\" she says. \"You can never get too comfortable.\"",

    "fullText": "A famed crypto influencer has predicted Bitcoin’s price could fall to $30,000.\n\nThe comments come after a global market crash.\n\nTechnical signals have reinforced the bearish outlook.\n\nAnalysts and prominent market commentators have warned of deeper losses for Bitcoin following a violent sell-off across global financial markets that wiped out trillions of dollars in value.\n\nOn Thursday, well-known crypto influencer Crypto Bitlord warned that Bitcoin could fall significantly further, identifying $30,000 as the next major support level.\n\n“The next major support for bitcoin is $30k,” the X account wrote.\n\nBenjamin Cowen, founder of crypto analytics platform Into The Cryptoverse, echoed the bearish outlook, saying Bitcoin’s weakness aligns with historical trends and macroeconomic tightening.\n\n“Today, we’re going to talk about Bitcoin and discuss why the price is dropping and why I think it will likely continue to drop,” Cowen said in a recent YouTube video.\n\nCowen said he believes Bitcoin has already transitioned into a bear market after peaking in October 2025.\n\n“I do think Bitcoin is, in fact, in a bear market,” he said.\n\nBitcoin’s slide comes amid a broader global market rout that saw roughly $3 trillion in market value erased in less than an hour on Thursday.\n\nPrecious metals, despite recent historic rallies, were not spared.\n\nGold lost around $1.5 trillion in market value, with prices falling nearly 10% from recent highs, while silver fell about 12%.\n\nLongtime Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff took his chance to weigh in on BTC’s falling, arguing that the asset has significantly underperformed gold over the long term despite growing institutional support.\n\n“Bitcoin is now worth just 15.5 ounces of gold, down 57% from its 2021 high and just 10% above its 2017 high,” Schiff wrote.\n\n“Despite all the hype and support from Wall Street and the Trump administration, most people who now own Bitcoin would have been better off buying gold or silver instead,” he added.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, analysts say Bitcoin’s chart structure has deteriorated further.\n\nVictor Olanrewaju, an analyst at CCN, said Bitcoin confirmed a bearish reversal pattern on the daily chart after breaking key support levels.\n\n“From a technical perspective, Bitcoin’s price extended its sell-off, breaking below the $86,400 neckline and confirming a head-and-shoulders breakdown on the daily chart,” Olanrewaju said.",

I'll just concentrate on the snooker.\n\n\"It would be wonderful to take the Brandon Parker Trophy home. It would mean so much and possibly more to me than any other player on the tour.\"\n\nMurphy opened his semi-final with a 122 break and, after being pegged back in the next frame, hit two further centuries - 129 and 125 - on his way to a comfortable victory.\n\n\"For a lot of that match I was close to my best,\" he added.\n\nMurphy's dominant form carried over from earlier rounds, which saw him dispatch Kyren Wilson and Mark Allen with ease.\n\nIt will be a second German Masters final for Murphy, who lost to Mark Selby in 2015.\n\nIn Saturday's evening session at the Tempodrom Berlin, three-time German Masters winner Trump reached the final after beating Ali Carter 6-2.\n\nTrump took the first four frames before Carter fought back to make it 4-2.\n\nHowever, Trump was able to see out the match and move a step nearer a first trophy since the 2024 UK Championship.",

    "description": "Indiana leaps from the depths of the have nots into the world of the haves with a national title. What comes next?",
    "fullText": "Indiana spent the entirety of its existence right around the bottom of the ladder in college football as a whole, let alone the Big Ten.\n\nNo programs lost quite like the Hoosiers, who did so more than any other teams in the conference before being passed by Northwestern this past season. Gridiron grief was a given in Bloomington for decades with most eyes drawn to IU’s men’s basketball program. Any short bursts of success just icing on the cake that was hoops.\n\nIndiana is the sport’s national champion after a 12-0 run in the regular season, a win over Ohio State in the Big Ten Championship and ensuing victories over Alabama in the Rose Bowl, Oregon in the Peach Bowl and Miami in the National Championship Game. It’s the first 16-0 finish in college football in over a century. In doing so, Indiana leapt into the ranks of the haves after spending decades in the dregs of the have nots.\n\nSeven of the Big Ten’s 18 current teams have won a national championship as a member of the conference. Only three have won one since 1968: Michigan, Ohio State and Indiana.\n\nThe Wolverines and Buckeyes have sat firmly atop the Big Ten’s football hierarchy for decades, being supplanted at the top by no teams save for one another during that span. Now Indiana’s come along and thrown itself atop the conference.\n\nNow, before you get incensed, this is not to say Indiana’s title equals Michigan and Ohio State’s several. It is to say both of those programs entered the 2025 season with all the tools and resources to win both the Big Ten and national championships and came up with neither, falling short of Indiana in the standings or, for the Buckeyes, on the field. Ohio State could’ve avenged that conference championship loss but fell to the same Miami team Indiana beat to win it all.\n\nOther teams have won the conference under Michigan and Ohio State’s watch, blips before a return to the status quo. There’s immortality to that, those trophies last forever, but they lack the lasting luster of a national title, which none of Michigan State, Iowa, Illinois, Wisconsin, Northwestern, Purdue or Penn State captured after winning the Big Ten.\n\nIs Indiana at the level of Michigan or Ohio State, its two immediate predecessors as national champions? Practically, no. Should it be considered ahead of the rest of the conference? Yes. Again, only those three programs have a title as a member since 1968.\n\nAfter those three? It’s a weird mix with a note given to the prior qualifier of “as a member.”\n\nBig Ten programs with titles since 1968 that were won as members of another conference (or independent) include USC, Penn State, Nebraska, Washington. Out of those four only Penn State has won the conference, doing so in 2005, 2008 and 2016. Both USC and Washington have yet to win ten or more games as a member and Nebraska has been notoriously inept.\n\nThen there’s the curious case of Oregon, a program without a title. The Ducks are no doubt near the top of the hierarchy, arguably just below the trio of Michigan, Ohio State and Indiana, given their conference championship in 2024. Unlike the Hoosiers, they followed that up with a trouncing in the Rose Bowl at the hands of the Buckeyes no less.\n\nThere’s plenty of great football programs in the Big Ten. All of USC, Oregon, Penn State, Washington and probably Nebraska can win a title. The resources are there, they just need proper usage. They all just need to prove they’re actually capable.\n\nMichigan and Ohio State didn’t. Now neither does Indiana.\n\nThis almost certainly won’t last forever, contenders have risen and fallen throughout history, just look at a few of the programs listed above. But for now, Indiana’s right around the top.",

    "title": "What Was History's Deadliest Era?",
    "description": "A recent history of guns and empire argues that early modern Europe marked the origins of a uniquely murderous era. But the world it describes is not so different from our own and making sense of its horrors requires judgment, not just arithmetic.",
    "fullText": "One of the first Europeans to try out slave trading failed dismally at it. In 1510, the Portuguese freebooter Dom Francisco de Almeida landed at the Cape of Good Hope and tried to capture some of the Khoekhoe people. He was wrong to put faith in his firepower. The arquebuses lugged around by his men were so cumbersome that they required a prop to aim, and cooperative victims who posed to be shot at. Heavy rain extinguished the smoldering wicks required to fire them. When Khoekhoe fighters bombarded De Almeida’s forces with poisoned arrows, they beat a swift retreat.\n\nThe historian Clifton Crais tells this story early on in The Killing Age, his vast, saturnine epic of how modernity was made, precisely because it was atypical of the centuries that followed. De Almeida’s folly was a curtain raiser to the “Mortecene”: a very long nineteenth century (1750–1900) in which the West’s industrial manufacture of arms revolutionized the ease with which humans could kill one another and so restructured the globe in its interests. Power and riches flowed not from ingenuity or values but from the barrel of a gun.\n\nWe are currently spoiled for leftish but pessimistic histories of modernity. These flip the teleology once sketched by H. G. Wells and his successors among pop historians. If world history has an endpoint in these accounts, it is not peace, prosperity, and international federation but heating oceans and the spasmodic lunges of narcissistic hegemons. Academic historians have once again come to understand capitalism as a subset of imperialism: not so much an economic doctrine as a “military-commercial revolution” violently imposed on others at home and abroad. Armies and slaving ships now feature as prominently in its story as factories or laboratories, forced work as much as laborsaving gadgets. The adoption by historians of the concept of the Anthropocene has strengthened their disposition to present the ascendancy of Western civilization as a road to ruin, one that required the ever-accelerating burning of fossil fuels and is now destabilizing the climate on which human life depends.\n\nThe Killing Age does not simply add another lament to these grand narratives. Rather, it proposes a new and macabre way of joining them together. It argues that rapid and decisive shifts in the propensity and capacity to kill powered capitalism, imperialism, and climate change. This dynamic first gathered force in Western Europe, above all in Britain, but soon spread across the globe. Crais denies that modern carnage has a hidden logic, still less a justification. His preferred viewpoint is that of Walter Benjamin’s angel, staring backward at the “accumulated wreckage” of past centuries. Yet he does suggest it passed through several bloody stages and that its work was more or less done by the turn of the twentieth century.\n\nIn the beginning was the musket. By investing in gun making, monopolizing the manufacture of quality gunpowder, and arming themselves to the teeth with flintlock muskets that were more dependable than De Almeida’s arquebuses, the Dutch — and then the British — kitted themselves out for early forms of primitive accumulation. Flintlocks that still worked in rainy conditions were much more reliable than unlike matchlock weapons that preceded them, and helped raiders to seize tropical spices and organize the violent enslavement of huge numbers of Africans. In many places colonized by Europeans, chaotic predation of this kind slowly gave way to production: the organized but no less violent domination of domestic and imported workers to produce cash crops or tropical goods for export. Jamaica, which had been a docking station for pirates, became a plantation economy in which enslaved Africans toiled to produce the sugar on which Europeans were hooked.\n\nGuns were not just tools for extracting goods and people from other places. Crais suggests that they were a vital commodity in thickening networks of trade. He vividly evokes the desire of non-Europeans for muskets, which conferred an edge — as much psychological as it was material — in conflicts with local rivals. He estimates that Western manufacturers and traders exported about half a billion guns from the mid-eighteenth to the turn of the twentieth century, along with enough gunpowder to kill every person then alive. One spike in this trade was the perverse expression of a peace dividend: after defeating Napoléon Bonaparte at Waterloo, European states ran down their stockpiles and flogged off weapons to Latin America and Africa.\n\nWherever guns went, societies upended themselves to obtain them and wreaked havoc with them. Heavily armed Indonesian pirates swapped prisoners for forest products with remote tribes in Borneo, who wanted them for human sacrifice. In North America, gunrunning led to “ecocide”: the relentless extermination of fur-bearing animals, beginning on the eastern seaboard and advancing westward, as First Nations used guns from British traders to kill the beavers whose pelts could be swapped for still more guns. The torrent of guns allowed peoples such as the Iroquois or Sioux to turn themselves into slaver states who forced their captives to work on preparing furs for market.\n\nAlthough Crais’s analysis ranges widely, he gives an especially gripping account of how guns debauched Africa, where militarized capitalism was never just something inflicted by Europeans on passive indigenes. Along the west coast, Europeans joined forces with warlords who used guns to tighten their control of coastlines and river mouths, monopolizing the flow of goods and people from the interior. He gives a macabre portrait of predator states such as the Oyo Empire and the Kingdom of Dahomey, whose rulers amassed European trinkets while enslaving their neighbors. Elsewhere, Crais maps slaving economies that were as appalling as they are relatively unfamiliar: “viciously racist Egyptians” turned Sudan into a vast slave market, while caravans of heavily armed traders from the Arab Gulf trekked out from Zanzibar in pursuit of ivory and human beings.\n\nThe relationships on which these “immoral economies” depended were hardly stable or equal. Crais provocatively describes Europeans abroad as “warlords,” a term meant to convey that freebooters, rather than conventional armies, spearheaded the violent advance of capitalism. Yet the chartered companies that operated everywhere from Canada’s Hudson Bay to the river Niger arguably relied on legal and financial legerdemain more than brute force. They borrowed state authority and often deployed more capital than they amassed. The British East India Company, which bore a “sword in one hand, and a ledger in the other” as it conquered vast swathes of the Indian subcontinent, typified this approach.\n\nEuropeans were often remarkably casual in handing over guns that were supposed to give them a decisive advantage because they had mastered a more insidious technology of domination: debt. The strongmen with whom they traded struggled to pay for guns once fur-bearing animals vanished from their territories or when the peoples they raided armed themselves in turn. Europeans then pounced on their debtors. In North America, they demanded the surrender of land; in India, the control of tax revenues in payment. Instead of stuff, they took sovereignty.\n\nKilling for capital did not in Crais’s view give way to fossil-fuel industrialism but rather made it possible in the first place. Practices that now look archaic, such as the mass slaughter of animals or the violent capture of people, actually greased the wheels of industrial modernity. A century-long war on African elephants supported the development of manufacturing towns like Ivoryton, Connecticut, which turned out piano keys for American parlors. New Bedford, Massachusetts, was the base for America’s whaling fleet before it became a manufacturing hub. Boilers gave way to spindles, and blubber to cotton, but violence was a constant: New Bedford’s cotton came from the South, a slaving empire within the republic whose leaders hoped to push its borders to the Pacific. The American Civil War thwarted those dreams. When it came to a close, Americans turned their guns on the buffalo of the Great Plains, reducing their numbers from some seventy million to a few hundred within decades. Their tough hides, which had not been much use in leather making, turned out to make excellent belts for machines, helping to maximize the output of steam engines.\n\nConnections like these encourage Crais to present the gun as the starting pistol for anthropogenic global warming. He concedes that scientists disagree on when human-induced climate change first became palpable and damaging. Dust thrown up into the atmosphere by volcanic eruptions seems to have cooled the mid-nineteenth century globe, masking the impact of factory emissions. Some researchers nevertheless believe that anthropogenic climate change worsened the severe droughts that struck much of later-nineteenth-century North America and disrupted Asian monsoon systems. Following Mike Davis, Crais argues that the mismanagement of dogmatic British officials turned the failure of Indian harvests into famines. He adds the thirty to sixty million people who “needlessly perished” of hunger in late-nineteenth-century India and China to his butcher’s bill.\n\nNot all of Crais’s links between capitalism and excess deaths from hunger and disease are so speculative. Predation, and the exploitative regimes of production that followed it, often had immediate and grave effects on local ecologies. The extermination of North American buffalo brought about the starvation of the plains Indians who relied upon them. This was by design, but other disasters were inadvertent. Wherever African elephants were hunted, trees and bushes grew back. These harbored the tsetse fly, the carrier of a deadly sleeping sickness that killed millions of people, horses, and farm animals across Africa. The network of irrigation canals dug by the khedive of Egypt as part of his plan to force the peasantry into growing cotton for export proved to be the ideal habitat for mosquitos and snails: millions succumbed to the malaria and bilharzia they carried.\n\nThis gun-toting capitalism is so deadly that it is hard to see why Crais abruptly calls time on the Mortecene around 1900. His answer, paradoxically, lies in the formal expansion of European empires. This process continued to unleash great violence, not least because it was often driven by pirates with new and better weapons. Cecil Rhodes carved out his fiefdom in South Africa with Martini–Henri rifles and Maxim machine guns, which decimated the Ndebele regiments his troops faced. Yet the new imperialism of the later nineteenth century increasingly preferred stability to profitable chaos and tried to establish a monopoly of violence.\n\nThe export ban on guns agreed at the 1890 Brussels Conference of the imperial powers dampened internecine warfare in Africa; the political boundaries hashed out by the colonial powers largely endured through independence to the present. Europeans likewise repented of their profitable decision to arm the Taiping rebels against the Qing regime in China. Despite having themselves bullied the Qing and looted their capital of Beijing, they now assisted them in liquidating the rebels.\n\nThere was nothing philanthropic about the demilitarization of the world. In the United States, a ban on selling weapons to indigenous peoples strengthened the hand of gun-toting settlers, while whites in the American South used the Second Amendment to keep the guns denied to their freed slaves. Still, Crais concludes that the age of killing was drawing to a close. This claim sits uneasily with the eruption of World War I. Concerned as he is mainly in the skirmishing of warlords within, or at the ragged margins of empires, Crais has little to say about what he views as a conventional showdown between dynastic alliance systems. The conflict matters to him chiefly because it was followed by a renewed injection of surplus weaponry into the extra-European world. He treats World War II in much the same way, noting it primarily to emphasize the decades of arms dealing that followed its close.\n\nA “Mortecene” that includes the hunting of elephants or the “pelagic genocide” of whales but excludes the Somme, Stalingrad, or Dachau is perilously artificial. In judging The Killing Age, we need to distinguish the range and energy with which it maps excess deaths from its arguments about periodization, causation, and thus responsibility. Crais never seems sure whether the urge to kill is basic to humans or a historically novel urge that hijacked the West and then engulfed the world.\n\nAt times, Crais offers an Augustinian definition of humans, as creatures driven to seize what others have — a premise capacious enough to explain nearly all political and social forms in history. But he also wants to date our Fall rather precisely: early modern Europeans, he claims, chose violence, before either victimizing or suborning the rest of the planet.\n\nIf The Killing Age were more consistent in its pessimistic anthropology, then much of what it describes should be seen as an intensification of natural processes rather than a criminal frenzy of “stark planetary destruction.” Whalers who killed sperm whales for the oil that became indispensable to lighting homes and factories were little different from Australian aboriginals who had hunted their continent’s megafauna to extinction. Should we “collectively grieve for what we have done” if such destruction is part and parcel of being human? Perhaps the question is less whether we should grieve than whether, in doing so, we are responding to historical evidence or instead giving expression to our politics or spirituality.\n\nPerhaps scale is what distinguishes the planetary crimes of the Mortecene from the routine horribleness of human experience. “Engines of history that had begun centuries earlier suddenly sped up and swayed out of control,” writes Crais, whipping up a “storm.” He deploys a staggering array of statistics to back up these turbid metaphors. Again and again, he seeks to appall and persuade his reader with the quantity of arms that circulated throughout the Mortecene. The volume matters, he submits, precisely because these weapons did not represent a qualitative change in lethality. Most were flintlock muskets — the “Toyota Corolla” of firearms, or, more appositely, the “AK-47” — capable of inflicting ugly wounds, but neither rapid to fire nor easy to aim. Many of their indigenous buyers chose to decorate them rather than to use them. Still, must not the half billion guns exported to the rest of the world have had huge effects on their makers and their buyers?\n\nWe need to consider relative rather than absolute magnitude in answering that question. In 1790, guns only made up 0.15 percent of British exports to the rest of the world. The case for the indispensability of gun-making to industrialization rests on harvesting suggestive examples, such as the Lloyds banking dynasty, who got their start in guns before moving into commerce and finance. The implication — that gun manufacture was an innovative part of the economy, rather than significant in absolute terms — resembles arguments now common in the scholarship on the transatlantic slave trade. For all its horrors, Crais concedes that slavery can at best be said to have had “sizeable aggregate effects” on Britain’s industrial revolution. Efficiency gains on West Indian plantations ran parallel to, but did not anticipate, those in domestic manufacturing; slave-grown sugar nourished urban factory hands but does not explain the productivity gains of the industries in which they toiled. The gun is less the “epicenter” of mercantile imperialism than its most evocative symbol.\n\nIndeed, tucked away in Crais’s statistics is a telling qualification: the vast majority of arms made by Europeans never left Europe. Across the eighteenth century, only 15 percent of Britain’s production was exported; the rest going into the stockpiles of its armed forces. Were guns really so instrumental in the transformation of the world if most of them vanished into domestic armories or were deployed primarily on European battlefields rather than wielded by warlords on African and Asian killing fields?\n\nThe awful, sometimes incomprehensibly huge body counts assembled by Crais make these criticisms seem quibbling. They undoubtedly convince readers to reject as Eurocentric a view of the long nineteenth century as a stable interval between the two great bloodlettings of the Napoleonic Wars and World War I. Before the Tianjin Rebellion was finally defeated, between twenty and thirty million Chinese had been killed, a toll that outstrips all the dead of World War I. But magnitude is not synonymous with significance, and not all enormities need be enormous. Crais constantly maximizes the number of people killed in wars, as if the Mortecene were the sum total of a spreadsheet column. He despairs of calculating how many Africans died in wars initiated by outsiders before suggesting that “perhaps hundreds of millions” may have perished. The hand-waving here is unconvincing. Cecil Rhodes’s British South African Company waged wars of invasion and counterinsurgency whose viciousness recalls the worst crimes of the present day, including dynamiting women and children as they sheltered in caves. Yet the historian William Beinart has calculated that these campaigns killed only about twelve thousand people.\n\nIt sounds grotesque to write “only” in such a context, but the wobbliness of the huge numbers thrown around by Crais leaves readers unsure how to calibrate their emotional response. In an appendix, he tells us that perhaps 228 million people died unnecessarily in Africa, Asia, and the Americas during the Mortecene. On more conservative estimates though, it was perhaps only one hundred million. But then Crais perks up and wonders if we could not bump that number up to three hundred million by including other parts of the world. If we suppose that the average person weighs about ninety pounds, then a human biomass of as much as twenty-seven billion pounds disappeared from the world during the Mortecene. I am ashamed to say that this figure stirred no emotions in me whatsoever. But why should it? There is no moral gravity in physical weight.\n\nThe Killing Age quotes Edward Gibbon’s line that the vocation of the historian is the “melancholy calculation of human calamities.” It makes good on that promise, but lacks Gibbon’s bluff Georgian clarity about tracing individual or collective responsibility for the disasters it describes. Most of its “unnecessary” deaths were not acts of killing, but the consequence of famines or diseases that followed wars, wrenching economic change, or simply bad weather.\n\nIt is odd to invoke the Anthropocene to inflate the death toll of the Mortecene, when almost no one had an inkling that the consumption of fossil fuels was deranging the weather. Crais points to the scientists who in the last decades of the nineteenth century had posited a link between carbonic gas levels and rising temperatures. Yet this is hardly enough to establish culpable “denial” about the causes or impact of global heating.\n\nIn any case, it is difficult to dismiss the Anthropocene as a crime — or even a mistake — when everyone reading these words owes their standard of living to it. It is easy to regret turning elephants into piano keys, buffalo into “robes” for posh New Yorkers, or sea cucumbers into aphrodisiacs, but much harder to see how we might have dispensed with kerosene gas lighting.\n\nThere is a moral, or perhaps a psychological, gap at the core of The Killing Age. We are never given a convincing account of why so many people felt they could kill in this period, or what it felt like to do so. Like many trade publications in history, The Killing Age has a dutifully picaresque rather than a forensic structure: each chapter introduces a new clutch of rogues before tracing out the details of their careers. Most of these perpetrators are doers rather than thinkers, instinctual and thuggish chancers like Rhodes — or his African, Asian, and Latin American counterparts — who rampaged into the world, head down and gun arm outstretched.\n\nIt is salutary to recall that people do not always have elaborate rationales for the harm that they do. Crais’s Boschian panorama of ruthless self-seeking and primal greed is a corrective to many academic accounts of European imperialism and settler colonialism, which see it as generated by fundamental shifts in how societies thought, with the churches, the Enlightenment, or the sciences variously indicted for generating new motives and rationales for the plunder and domination of other peoples. For Crais, Europeans did not need ideas to justify their ruthless appetites. The sea change came in the tools they had to pursue their coarse dreams of self-aggrandizement. His bracing materialism is in line with other recent works that understand imperialism as an outgrowth of an older will to profit.\n\nAll the same, the actions of his gunmen did have a moral and intellectual context that is too thinly stretched here. Their crimes cannot be understood without considering the thick web of religious reflection, legal thought, and statute that justified the use of violence by Europeans against others and, at times, restrained its excesses. Crais wonders rather naively why more people did not protest against a modern world that was going so “profoundly wrong.” The answer may be that many of them considered themselves more or less right.\n\nWhen he mused on what makes a state, St Augustine quoted the pirate captured by Alexander the Great: “I do my fighting on a tiny ship, and they call me a pirate; you do yours with a large fleet, and they call you Commander.” Many states could be regarded as bands of robbers; many robbers, when they amassed power to seize whole regions and subdue their populations, could claim to have made kingdoms. The Killing Age chillingly evokes how distinctions between warlords and statesmen, empires and bands of robbers, slip and blur when we consider organized robbery and mass murder. It is a world hardly remote from our own, which is one reason why the “Mortecene” will not stick as the label for a distinct historical period. Augustine believed that a true state must be founded on “justice,” a principle he did not derive from but applied to his contemplation of the past. We need some such principle to make sense of the bewildering and gruesome facts with which The Killing Age presents us.",

    "fullText": "BEIJING (AP) — U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer arrived in the Chinese financial center of Shanghai on Friday in his bid to boost business opportunities for British firms in the world's second-largest economy, just hours after U.S. President Donald Trump signaled a possible opposition to any deal between Beijing and London.\n\nWhy are foreign leaders increasing visits to Beijing?\n\nWhat agreement was reached on British lawmakers sanctions?\n\nWhat business opportunities is Starmer seeking in China?\n\nHow did Trump respond to UK-China negotiations?\n\nStarmer, the center-left Labour leader, has brought more than 50 business leaders on his trip to China, the first by a U.K. prime minister in eight years.\n\nStarmer suggested Trump’s criticism was aimed more at Canada than Britain. He added that Washington was aware in advance of his trip and its objectives and pointed out that Trump has said he plans to visit China this spring.\n\n“I don’t think it’s wise for the United Kingdom to stick its head in the sand,” Starmer told Sky News. “China is the second biggest economy in the world. Along with Hong Kong, it’s our third-biggest trading partner. And through this visit, we’ve opened up lots of opportunities for jobs and wealth creation.”\n\nStarmer started his trip in Beijing on Thursday, where he met with Chinese leaders including Xi Jinping. The two pledged to pursue a long-term and stable strategic partnership in what was seen as a sign of improving ties after several years of friction between the two countries.\n\nIn Washington, Trump suggested that he may oppose any deal between Beijing and London, and then pivoted to Canada, with which he has had a series of sharp exchanges since Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney visited China earlier this month.\n\n“Well, it’s very dangerous for them to do that,” he said, when asked about Starmer’s visit and any U.K. trade talks with Beijing. “And it’s even more dangerous, I think, for Canada to get into business with China. Canada is not doing well. They’re doing very poorly.”\n\n“You can’t look at China as the answer,” he said.\n\nStarmer and Carney are among a series of foreign leaders to visit Beijing as their nations seek to improve ties with China. Many have seen their countries’ economies buffeted by Trump’s tariffs and are looking to expand other export markets.\n\nThe British prime minister said Xi agreed to remove a travel ban that had been imposed on several British lawmakers after the U.K.'s former center-right Conservative government joined the European Union, Canada and the U.S. in imposing sanctions on four Chinese officials over evidence of rights abuses against the Uyghur Muslim people in the far western Xinjiang region.\n\n“This has been a cause of concern in Parliament and for parliamentarians for some time and that is why I raised it on this visit,\" Starmer told ITV News. “The response from the Chinese is that the restrictions no longer apply and President Xi has told me that that means that all parliamentarians are welcome to visit.”",

    "fullText": "NEW YORK, Jan 30 (Reuters) - SpaceX (SPAX.PVT) revised its Starlink privacy policy to allow the use of customer data for AI training, a shift that ​could bolster Elon Musk's AI ambitions.\n\nAhead of a blockbuster IPO planned for later this year, ‌SpaceX is in talks to merge with Musk’s AI company, xAI (XAAI.PVT), a deal first reported by Reuters on Thursday. SpaceX, already the ‌world’s most valuable private company, could reach a value of more than $1 trillion after the IPO.\n\nWhat are privacy experts' concerns about Starlink's policy changes?\n\nWhat changes did SpaceX make to Starlink's privacy policy?\n\nHow could the SpaceX-xAI merger impact AI development?\n\nWhat data does Starlink collect from its users?\n\nStarlink updated its Global Privacy Policy on January 15, according to the Starlink website. The policy includes new details stating that unless a user opts out, Starlink data may be used “to train our machine learning or artificial intelligence ⁠models” and could be shared with ‌the company’s service providers and “third-party collaborators,” without providing further details.\n\nA previous version of the privacy policy, an archived version from November and reviewed by Reuters, did not ‍contain language about AI training on Starlink data.\n\nSpaceX did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nStarlink collects vast amounts of user data, spanning location information, credit card information, contact information and user IP ​addresses. It also collects so-called communication data, which includes audio and visual information, data in shared ‌files, and “inferences we may make from other personal information we collect,” according to its global privacy policy.\n\nThe policy did not make clear exactly what data would be used to train AI. The move has raised concerns among privacy advocates and consumer rights groups, which argue that using personal data to train AI risks expanding surveillance and creates new avenues for misuse.\n\n“It certainly raises my eyebrow and would make ⁠me concerned if I was a Starlink user,” said Anupam ​Chander, a technology law professor at Georgetown University. “Often there's perfectly ​legitimate uses of your data, but it doesn’t have a clear limit to what kind of uses it will be put to.”\n\nMusk's xAI, most recently valued at $230 billion ‍after a recent funding round, ⁠is currently developing its Grok LLM chatbot and also owns X, the social media platform.\n\nThe potential merger with xAI would turbocharge the space company’s deployment of AI-powered services, while giving xAI ⁠vast new data sets to train its models on, including communication data. Starlink, a network of more than 9,000 satellites, ‌currently provides internet connection to more than 9 million users.",

    "description": "Global Entry and Precheck revoked three days after incident, court filing says.",
    "fullText": "Minnesota resident Nicole Cleland had her Global Entry and TSA Precheck privileges revoked three days after an incident in which she observed activity by immigration agents, the woman said in a court declaration. An agent told Cleland that he used facial recognition technology to identify her, she wrote in a declaration filed in US District Court for the District of Minnesota.\n\nCleland, a 56-year-old resident of Richfield and a director at Target Corporation, volunteers with a group that tracks potential Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) vehicles in her neighborhood, according to her declaration. On the morning of January 10, she “observed a white Dodge Ram being driven by what I believed to be federal enforcement agents” and “maneuvered behind the vehicle with the intent of observing the agents’ actions.”\n\nCleland said that she and another observer in a different car followed the Dodge Ram because of “concern about a local apartment building being raided.” She followed the car for a short time and from a safe distance until “the Dodge Ram stopped in front of the other commuter’s vehicle,” she wrote. Cleland said two other vehicles apparently driven by federal agents stopped in front of the Dodge Ram, and her path forward was blocked.\n\n“An agent exited the vehicle and approached my vehicle,” Cleland wrote. “I remained in my vehicle. The agent addressed me by my name and informed me that they had ‘facial recognition’ and that his body cam was recording. The agent stated that he worked for border patrol. He wore full camouflage fatigues. The agent stated that I was impeding their work. He indicated he was giving me a verbal warning and if I was found to be impeding again, I would be arrested.”\n\nCleland acknowledged that she heard what the agent said, and they drove off in opposite directions, according to her declaration. Cleland submitted the declaration on January 21 in a lawsuit filed by Minnesota residents against US government officials with the Department of Homeland Security and ICE. Cleland’s court filing was mentioned yesterday in a Boston Globe column about tactics used by ICE agents to intimidate protesters.\n\nCleland said she could “discern no reason why the agents stopped me other than the fact that I was following them.” But on January 13, she received an email notification that her Global Entry and TSA Precheck privileges for passing through airport security were revoked, she said. Cleland said the revocation appears to be a form of intimidation and retaliation:\n\nI logged onto the Global Entry site and the notification letter indicated that indeed my status had been revoked and that they can’t always disclose the reason. The notification did provide some reasons that my status may have changed and the only one that makes sense was “The applicant has been found in violation of any customs, immigration, or agriculture regulations, procedures, or laws in any country.” I was not detained, I was not arrested so [it is] difficult to understand how I was “found in violation.”\n\nI had been a member of the Global Entry program since 2014 without incident. I am not particularly concerned with the revocation of my privileges in isolation. However, given that only three days had passed from the time that I was stopped, I am concerned that the revocation was the result of me following and observing the agents. This is intimidation and retaliation. I was following Legal Observer laws. I [was] within my rights to be doing what I was doing.\n\nCleland said she and her husband travel frequently, and she is worried that they may encounter problems going forward.\n\n“I am concerned that border patrol and other federal enforcement agencies now have my license plate and personal information, and that I may be detained or arrested again in the future,” she wrote. “I am concerned about further actions that could be taken against me or my family. I have instructed my family to be cautious and return inside if they see unfamiliar vehicles outside of our home.”\n\nCleland said she hasn’t performed any observation of federal agents since January 10, but has “continued to engage in peaceful protests” and is “assessing when I will return to active observations.”\n\nWe contacted the Department of Homeland Security about Cleland’s declaration and will update this article if we get a response.\n\nFederal agents have made extensive use of facial recognition during President Trump’s immigration crackdown with technology from Clearview AI and a face-scanning app called Mobile Fortify. They use facial recognition technology both to verify citizenship and identify protesters.\n\n“Ms. Cleland was one of at least seven American citizens told by ICE agents this month that they were being recorded with facial recognition technology in and around Minneapolis, according to local activists and videos posted to social media,” The New York Times reported today, adding that none of the people had given consent to be recorded.\n\nICE also uses a variety of other technologies, including cell-site simulators (or Stingrays) to track phone locations, and Palantir software to help identify potential deportation targets.\n\nAlthough Cleland vowed to continue protesting and eventually get back to observing ICE and CBP agents, her declaration said she felt intimidated after the recent incident.\n\n“The interaction with the agents on January 10th made me feel angry and intimidated,” she wrote. “I have been through Legal Observer Training and know my rights. I believe that I did not do anything that warranted being stopped in the way that I was on January 10th.”",

    "fullText": "The New York Yankees reportedly “checked in” on Dodgers free agent Michael Kopech this offseason, per the New York Post’s Jon Heyman.\n\nKopech entered free agency after spending a majority of 2025 on the injured list with the Dodgers. The reliever began the regular season on the injured list with a shoulder injury and transferred to the 60-day injured list at the beginning of May 2025.\n\nHe returned to the team the following month, but returned to the injured shortly after with a right knee injury. Kopech returned once again at the beginning of September, but re-aggravated his knee injury at the end of the season and missed the postseason.\n\nMore news: Dodgers Sign Brother of Current LA Starter to Minor League Deal\n\nThe right-hander joined the Dodgers at the trade deadline in 2024, switching to the National League from the Chicago White Sox.\n\nThe 29-year-old made an instant impact after arriving with the Dodgers, and became one of their most important weapons out of the bullpen. He had a 1.13 ERA with L.A. in 2024, and maintained a 3.00 ERA during their World Series charge in the playoffs.\n\nEven though he struggled with injury last season, the right-hander still performed will in 2025. He had a 2.45 ERA through 14 appearances with the Dodgers last season.\n\nThe Dodgers have already reinforced their bullpen this offseason so re-signing Kopech is unlikely, but whichever team grabs him will get a high-quality reliever for the upcoming season.\n\nThe post Dodgers World Series Champion Linked to Yankees appeared first on LA Sports Report.",

    "title": "Want to Support the Fight Against Fascism? Boycott Trump’s World Cup",
    "description": "Elie...",
    "fullText": "In this week’s Elie v. U.S., The Nation’s Justice correspondent urges soccer lovers to stay away, takes on the attacks on Alex Pretti, and warns of a dangerous anti-voting bill.\n\nPeople are finally beginning to call for other countries to boycott Donald Trump’s upcoming World Cup—and not just usual suspects like me and The Nation’s Dave Zirin. Oke Göttlich, a powerful German soccer administrator, said that, in the wake of the execution of Alex Pretti in Minnesota, the time has come to talk seriously about boycotting the tournament. Sepp Blatter, the former head of FIFA (the international governing committee of global soccer) suggested that fans shouldn’t travel to the tournament because of rising safety concerns in the United States.\n\nThis is going to sound weird to non–sports fans, but boycotting the World Cup is one of the most significant sanctions members of the international community can take against the United States right now. The World Cup is the most watched sporting event in the world. The US has been begging to host a tournament for decades. This World Cup, which runs from early June through mid-July, is a perfect opportunity for the world to stand against this country’s fascist regime.\n\nIndeed, the fates have aligned to make this World Cup the perfect one to make a statement—for two reasons. The first is that more countries are involved: The tournament has expanded to 48 teams this year, up from 32 in previous years, which means that more people than ever will be involved in the proceedings—and possible protests. The second reason is that those 48 countries wouldn’t actually have to boycott the entire World Cup, because this year’s tournament is also being hosted by two other countries—Canada and Mexico. Teams could refuse to play in the US while happily playing in Canada or Mexico. It would be a powerful statement.\n\nThat statement won’t come from FIFA, however. FIFA is one of the most corrupt organizations in the entire world, and its current president, Gianni Infantino, was last seen licking Trump’s boots and handing him a “peace prize.” Nor is it likely to come from the powerful soccer-playing countries in Western Europe. If France, Germany, and Great Britain were to pull out of the US portions of the tournament, many other countries would follow—but, sadly, the leaders of those nations appear eager to play Neville Chamberlain to Trump’s Hitler.\n\nTeams from Africa, the Middle East, and Asia could take a moral stand, but there are complications. Some of the teams involved are also run by repressive authoritarians. Others are financially dependent on FIFA and the World Cup to fund their soccer federations, while still others have entire economies beholden to the United States. On the other hand, a lot of those countries damn well know that if they did what the US is doing, they’d be boycotted and sanctioned and probably invaded by white people promising to restore “freedom” in exchange for all their oil and minerals. So it’s at least possible that some of them could take a moral stand. South Africa is in the tournament, and South Africa knows how to handle white people like Elon Musk.\n\nA boycott by all or some of the South American teams would make the whole tournament a joke. We know that the defending World Cup champion, Argentina, with its fascist-curious Trump-puppet president will show up (as will Ecuador, whose president is also friendly with our reigning despot), but some of the other nations that made the field—Brazil, Colombia, and Uruguay—could be a different story. Their fans arguably face a real risk if they attend the matches. Could an American fan of, say, Colombia even go to a game without fear of being detained and deported by ICE, regardless of their actual citizenship status? Would a fan of Brazil feel safe traveling to the United States? The US is a clear and present danger to those people. If these soccer federations think about their fans, and the fact that their fans could be targeted by racist DHS agents, they might be convinced to do the right thing and boycott the US portions of the tournament.\n\nThe United States is an international pariah. It should be treated like one. Boycotting the World Cup is the obvious place to start.\n\nFeature\n\n /\n\n Ho Chi Minh\n\nThe New York Times released a video that purports to show an altercation between ICE and Alex Pretti a week before his murder. The video shows Pretti smashing the taillight of an ICE vehicle before the agents beat him up.\n\nThe Times (and right-wing cultists) seems to think this video proves that Pretti was a violent man who deserved to be executed without trial. Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs, who wrote the story for the Times, played the role of ICE water-carrier when he wrote, “The footage adds to what is known about the 37-year-old nurse.”\n\nNo, you fascist-sympathizing fuck, the footage adds to what we know about ICE. In a court of law, that footage could be evidence of the motive behind ICE’s murder of that man. It could be evidence of premeditation. It potentially shows that Pretti was targeted by ICE for retribution and death. If federal agents had a preexisting “beef” with Pretti, if Pretti were known to people in the field and then they killed him, that’s compelling evidence that the killing was intentional.\n\nIt is common in our media to prosecute the victim. That’s what the Times (and Fox and the whole right-wing media echosphere) is trying to do now. But the people who should be on trial here are ICE. You show me a video where violent individuals had a prior altercation with a man, and then days later that man ends up getting shot in the back of the head, and I’m going to tell you that video is evidence of premeditated murder in the first degree.\n\nPerhaps I should tell The New York Times “thank you.” In their effort to smear Pretti, they may have just aggravated the charges against his murderers.\n\nI wrote about how Trump flinched in Minnesota, and that shows that the people are more powerful than the law or the opposition party ever will be.\n\nIn News Unrelated to the Current Chaos\n\nLet me be clear, I do not want another social media platform. I can’t handle it. You young people have no idea how hard it is to keep switching up platforms. I’m old, so very old. I can barely frost the thermoplastic polyurethane on my screen protector.\n\nThat said, I will probably UpScrolled is the new competitor to TikTok that has been surging in popularity since TikTok’s US operations were formally taken over by Trump-adjacent business interests this week. It was created by Issam Hijazi, whom Al Jazeera describes as a “Palestinian-Jordanian-Australian entrepreneur.” That’s a pretty big demographic contrast to Larry Ellison, the Benjamin Netanyahu buddy (and, you know, founder of Oracle and one of the three richest people alive) who acquired a large stake in TikTok once it was forced into US hands.\n\nTikTok users are (rightly) worried about censorship on the new TikTok, and a silencing of any views that don’t support fascism and genocide. It’s a valid concern, considering what Elon Musk has done to Twitter. UpScrolled is to TikTok as BlueSky is to Twitter, or so the story goes.\n\nSo I’ll probably join. But I really don’t want to. I don’t want to join anything else. Goddamnit, I miss my Tumblr account.\n\nIf you enjoyed this installment of Elie v. U.S.,",

Some of the building’s doors were damaged. No weapons were discovered in Sohail’s car.\n\nSohail's father told the New York Daily News Thursday that his son had been considering converting to Judaism and that he had struggled with “mental problems.” The Forward, a media outlet centered on Jewish issues, interviewed a rabbi in New Jersey who said Sohail attended a Purim service at Chabad last year and visited two other times, looking for spiritual guidance.\n\n“I was able to talk to him for a few minutes and see that he’s not exactly stable,” Rabbi Levi Azimov told the Forward. Another rabbi at a Jewish school in Carteret, New Jersey, where Sohail lived, told the Forward he had dropped by for afternoon prayers on Tuesday but began yelling about feeling let down by Chabad after the service.\n\nThe crash occurred on the 75th anniversary of Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson becoming the leader of the Lubavitch movement and prompted immediate concern in the city. Mayor Zohran Mamdani and the city's police commissioner, Jessica Tisch, rushed to the scene to brief the media, with officials announcing increased security around houses of worship across the city.\n\n“This is deeply alarming, especially given the deep meaning and the history of the institution to so many in New York and around the world,\" Mamdani said. “And on today of all days.”\n\nThe Chabad Lubavitch headquarters and synagogue in Brooklyn draws thousands of visitors each year. There is a near constant police presence around the complex.",

    "fullText": "MUMBAI, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Some of the world's biggest reinsurers, including Lloyd's of London, are seeking Indian regulatory approval to operate in a low-tax city set up in the prime minister's home state ​to try to rival other international financial hubs, two sources said.\n\nThe global companies, which also include South Korea’s Samsung Re, ‌Kenya Re and Spain’s Mapfre Re, will join more than a dozen global reinsurers from Europe, the Middle East and Asia that are turning to the new city to ‌gain access to India's $129.78 billion insurance market, estimated by the industry to be the tenth largest in the world.\n\nThe two sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to speak to the press, said the companies were expected to seek approval this year.\n\nEmail queries sent to Mapfre Re, Samsung Re and Kenya Re were not answered. A Lloyd’s of London spokesperson declined to comment. The companies' plans to ⁠set up operations in the Gujarat International Finance ‌Tec‑City, or GIFT City, have not been previously reported.\n\nThe city offers businesses favourable tax treatment, such as a 10-year tax holiday and exemption from capital gains.\n\nThe government has said it hopes it will rival Singapore and ‍Dubai as an international financial centre.\n\nIndia's reinsurance market is currently dominated by Swiss Re and Munich Re, as well as private firms and the government-owned GIC Re that is widely expected to grow after the government introduced reforms to deepen India's insurance penetration.\n\nSAUDI RE AND OTHERS HAVE RECEIVED APPROVAL\n\nA few large ​reinsurers have received approvals over the last year to begin operating in GIFT City. These include Saudi Re, Korean Re, Peak Re, ‌Kuwait Re, Abu Dhabi National Insurance and Kazakh‑based Eurasia Insurance Company JSC, according to regulatory officials and company statements.\n\nSaudi Re earlier this week opened its GIFT City branch, its second in Asia after Malaysia.\n\nKorean Re has said its expansion reflected its commitment to India’s high growth insurance sector, while Hong Kong‑based Peak Re, which received a licence in March 2025, said it plans to offer life and non-life insurance.\n\nAbout 14 global reinsurers operate from GIFT City, managing an annualised $700–800 million in premiums, public disclosures show.\n\nThe number of reinsurers is expected to increase ⁠to at least 20 by the end of March 2026, two regulatory officials ​said, declining to be identified as final approvals are pending.\n\nThey said the international reinsurers ​sought to offer products that are relatively underdeveloped in India, including surety bonds, parametric insurance, marine and shipping cover, cyber risk and health reinsurance.",

We have something to cherish being here. We've got life. It's not about trying to be a thug in the streets.\"\n\nDuring the face-off, Stevenson continued chatting to Lopez, who kept a straight face and simply stared at him, before Stevenson delivered a light shoulder barge and walked off stage.",

And as per El Crack Deportivo, United have zeroed in on his compatriot as the perfect backup.\n\nRiver Plate’s Lautaro Rivero has emerged as an option for the 20-time English league champions, and they intend to sign him in the summer.\n\nThe Argentine giants are aware of United’s interest in the 22-year-old, and have therefore slapped a €100 million release clause into his contract.\n\nRiver do not want to lose the Argentina international on the cheap, amid interest from Strasbourg, Tottenham, City Football Group, Juventus, and Atletico Madrid.\n\n“Manchester United intend to secure the services of Lautaro Rivero, a key player in Gallardo’s squad.\n\n“River Plate made Rivero sign a €100 million release clause, so if they want to sign him, they must pay a figure close to that amount.”\n\nRivero is already an Argentina international, and could be on the plane to the US for the World Cup if he continues performing as he has.\n\nHe has made 18 appearances for the River Plate first team and can play both in central defence and as a left-back.\n\nDescribed as an “elite” ball-playing defender, it will be interesting to see if United can get a deal for another South American talent over the line.\n\nHowever, it is likely to be for a fee much lesser than what is being quoted in the report.\n\nFeature image Hernan Cortez via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "description": "Apple CEO Tim Cook says a global memory chip shortage is beginning to bite, with rising costs expected to pressure margins ahead.",
    "fullText": "The global memory chip shortage is catching up with Apple, Tim Cook says.\n\nThe Apple CEO said on the company's first-quarter earnings call that Apple is beginning to feel the effects of the memory shortage crisis, with rising prices expected to put pressure on margins ahead.\n\nThe warning comes amid blockbuster demand for Apple's newest products. Customer response to the latest iPhone lineup \"exceeded our expectations,\" with iPhone revenue jumping 23%, Cook said on the call Thursday.\n\nApple reported revenue of $143.76 billion and earnings per share of $2.84, beating analyst estimates.\n\nThe staggering iPhone demand left Apple exiting the December quarter with \"very lean\" inventory, pushing the company into what Cook described as \"supply chase mode.\"\n\nCook said the biggest constraint is the limited access to advanced chipmaking nodes used to produce Apple's system-on-a-chip processors. Higher demand has also reduced flexibility across Apple's supply chain, he said.\n\nMemory shortages played a minimal role in Apple's December-quarter margins, but their impact is expected to grow, Cook added.\n\nThe company expects memory costs to weigh more heavily on margins in the second quarter, contributing to its forecast gross margin range of 48% to 49%. Apple posted a gross margin of about 48% in the December quarter.\n\n\"We do continue to see market pricing for memory increasing significantly,\" Cook said. \"As always, we'll look at a range of options to deal with that.\"\n\nApple's stock price rose about 2% after hours following the results on Thursday.\n\nCook's comments come as the tech industry grapples with a worsening global shortage of memory chips.\n\nAI companies, smartphone makers, and PC manufacturers are competing for the same pool of memory components, which are critical not just for consumer electronics but also for powering large language models and other AI systems. That surge in demand has sent prices climbing.\n\nAt CES 2026 last month, Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, described the memory storage market as \"completely unserved.\"\n\n\"This market will likely be the largest storage market in the world, basically holding the working memory of the world's AIs,\" he said at CES with analysts.\n\n\"The amount of context memory, the amount of token memory that we process, KB cache we process, is now just way too high,\" he added, referring to AI storage needs.\n\nThe Korea Economic Daily reported in January that Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix are seeking server DRAM price hikes of 60% to 70% in the first quarter compared with the previous quarter. Market analysis firm Counterpoint also said last month that memory prices could climb as much as 40% through the second quarter of 2026.\n\n\"The memory market is at an unprecedented inflexion point, with demand materially outpacing supply,\" an analyst from global market intelligence firm International Data Corporation wrote in a December note.\n\nThe rapid buildout of AI infrastructure marks a break from the industry's traditional \"boom-and-bust cycles.\"\n\n\"For consumers and enterprises alike, this signals the end of an era of cheap, abundant memory and storage, at least in the medium term,\" the analyst added.",

    "fullText": "UNITED NATIONS (AP) — President Donald Trump’s latest attempt to sidestep the United Nations through his new Board of Peace appears to have inadvertently backfired after major world powers rejected U.S. aspirations for it to have a larger international mandate beyond the Gaza ceasefire and recommitted their support for the over 80-year-old global institution.\n\nThe board to be chaired by Trump was originally envisioned as a small group of world leaders overseeing his plan for Gaza's future. But the Republican president’s ambitions have expanded to envisioning the board as a mediator of worldwide conflicts, a not very subtle attempt to eclipse the Security Council, which is charged with ensuring international peace and security.\n\nThe board's charter also caused some dismay by stating Trump will lead it until he resigns, with veto power over its actions and membership.\n\nHis secretary of state, Marco Rubio, tried to ease concerns by saying the board's focus right now is only on the next phases of the Gaza ceasefire plan.\n\n“This is not a replacement for the U.N., but the U.N. has served very little purpose in the case of Gaza other than the food assistance,” Rubio said at a congressional hearing Wednesday.\n\nBut Trump's promotion of a broadened mandate and his floating of an idea that the Board of Peace “might” replace the U.N. have put off major players and been dismissed by U.N. officials.\n\n“In my opinion, the basic responsibility for international peace and security lies with U.N., lies with the Security Council,” Secretary General Antonio Guterres said Thursday. “Only the Security Council can adopt decisions binding on all, and no other body or other coalition can legally be required to have all member states to comply with decisions on peace and security.”\n\nIn Security Council statements, public speeches and behind closed doors, U.S. allies and adversaries have dismissed Trump’s latest plan to overturn the post-World War II international order with what he describes as a “bold new approach to resolving global conflict.”\n\n“The U.S. rollout of the much broader Board of Peace charter turned the whole exercise into a liability,” according to the International Crisis Group’s Richard Gowan, a U.N. watcher and program director. “Countries that wanted to sign on to help Gaza saw the board turning into a Trump fan club. That was not appealing.”\n\n“If Trump had kept the focus of the board solely on Gaza, more states, including some more Europeans, would have signed up,” he said.\n\nKey Security Council members haven't signed on\n\nThe four other veto-wielding members of the Security Council — China, France, Russia and the United Kingdom — have refused or have not indicated whether they would join Trump's board, as have economic powers such as Japan and Germany.\n\nLetters sent this month inviting various world leaders to be “founding members” of the Board of Peace coincided with Trump’s vow to take over Greenland, a semiautonomous territory of NATO ally Denmark, and punish some European countries that resisted. That was met with stark rebuttal from Canada, Denmark and others, who said Trump’s demand threatened to upend an alliance that has been among the West's most unshakeable.\n\nShortly after, Trump pulled a dramatic reversal on Greenland, saying he had agreed with the NATO secretary-general on a “framework of a future deal” on Arctic security.\n\nAmid the diplomatic chaos, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who at the time had not responded to Trump’s Board of Peace invitation, met with Guterres in London and reiterated “the UK’s enduring support for the UN and the international rules-based system,” according to a statement.\n\nStarmer emphasized the U.N.’s “pivotal role in tackling global problems which shape lives in the UK and all over the world.” The United Kingdom later declined to join the board.\n\nFrance, Spain and Slovenia declined Trump’s offer by mentioning its overlapping and potentially conflicting agenda with the U.N.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said last week that the board goes beyond “the framework of Gaza and raises serious questions, in particular with respect to the principles and structure of the United Nations, which cannot be called into question.”\n\nSpain would not join because the board excluded the Palestinian Authority and because the body was “outside the framework of the United Nations,” Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said.\n\nSome countries are urging a stronger UN\n\nAmerica’s adversaries also have shunned the board.\n\n“No single country should dictate terms based on its power, and a winner-takes-all approach is unacceptable,” China’s U.N. ambassador, Fu Cong, said at a Security Council meeting Monday.\n\nHe called for the United Nations to be strengthened, not weakened, and said the Security Council’s status and role “are irreplaceable.”\n\nIn a clear reference to the Board of Peace, Fu said, “We shall not cherry-pick our commitments to the organization, nor shall we bypass the U.N. and create alternative mechanisms.”\n\nSo far, about 26 of some 60 invited countries have joined the board, and about nine European countries have declined. India did not attend Trump’s signing ceremony at the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland, last week but is reportedly still deciding what to do. Trump revoked Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney’s invitation.\n\n“It’s hardly surprising that very few governments want to join Trump’s wannabe-U.N., which so far looks more like a pay-to-play club of human rights abusers and war crimes suspects than a serious international organization,” said Louis Charbonneau, U.N. director for Human Rights Watch. “Instead of handing Trump $1 billion checks to join his Board of Peace, governments should work on strengthening the U.N.”\n\nEight Muslim nations that agreed to join the board issued a joint statement that supported its mission in Gaza and advancement of Palestinian statehood. Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, Indonesia, Pakistan, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates made no mention of Trump’s global peacemaking plan.\n\nThe Crisis Group’s Gowan said their focus could be a way to “get a foothold in discussions of Gaza” at the start, as Trump’s ceasefire plan has already faced several setbacks.\n\n“I remain unconvinced that this is a real long-term threat to the U.N.,” Gowan said.",

    "fullText": "Jannik Sinner has weighed in on Coco Gauff’s Australian Open racket smash, a moment that has sparked plenty of debate across the tennis world.\n\nIt has become one of the main storylines over the past few days, even with several high-profile matches taking place.\n\nPart of that may be down to what has felt like a lack of drama throughout the tournament, which has pushed more attention towards incidents happening off the court.\n\nThe situation unfolded after Gauff lost to Elina Svitolina, with her decision to smash her racket coming away from the cameras. Even so, it was picked up and shared widely.\n\nGauff kept her emotions in check throughout what was a tough defeat and waited until she was off the court before letting her frustration show.\n\nDespite that, footage of the incident still found its way into public view, adding unnecessary attention to an already disappointing day for her.\n\nSpeaking about the moment, Sinner said he understood where she was coming from.\n\n“It can happen, no? We’re athletes, we invest our whole life to be the best version of ourselves. But sometimes losses hurt. I understand the frustration as a player.”\n\nHe added: “She gives everything on court, she never says a word out of place, she’s a good girl.”\n\nSinner has bigger things to focus on at this point in the tournament with his upcoming semi-final clash against Novak Djokovic taking priority over any off-court topics.\n\nSinner came into this tournament as the clear favourite, aiming for a third straight title.\n\nBut Carlos Alcaraz has put together an impressive run of his own. The young Spaniard has already made it further in this tournament than ever before, and is quickly joining Sinner at the top of pre-match discussions.\n\nMeanwhile, Djokovic’s path to the last four has not been smooth, but he has benefited from a couple of key breaks along the way.\n\nFirst, there was Jakub Mensik’s withdrawal before their fourth-round match. Then in his quarter-final, Lorenzo Musetti was forced to retire with an injury despite being two sets up on the scoreboard.\n\nRemarkably, Djokovic has reached the semi-finals of this Grand Slam despite having played only 11 sets of tennis.\n\nThis year luck does appear to be favouring him more than usual, giving him some much-needed time to recover before facing Sinner.\n\nThis is likely his best opportunity to secure a 25th Grand Slam title.",

    "title": "The Coming of Age of Arda Güler",
    "description": "Debunking false narratives about one of the most creatives players in world football",
    "fullText": "Coveted by many top European teams before signing with Real Madrid in the summer of 2023 at the age of 18, Arda Güler arrived in Madrid with lofty expectations.  Madrid paid Fenerbahçe approximately €26 million to secure the services of the Turkish phenom at a time when various Barcelona journalists reported he was close to signing with the Catalan club.  Today Transfermarkt values Güler at €90 million, up from €45 million at the start of 2025, an indication of his progression over the last year.\n\nInjuries derailed Güler first season at Madrid, but once healthy he quickly demonstrated his scoring prowess with six goals in La Liga in only 373 minutes, an outrageous goal every 62 minutes on the pitch.  Two years later, Güler is firmly establishing himself as one of the top creative midfielders in Europe.\n\nStarting as a 10 under Xabi Alonso at the Club World Cup before transitioning to a deep-lying playmaker role, Güler has been playing in a more advanced position since the arrival of coach Álvaro Arbeloa.  It was said at times this season that Madrid was expecting too much from Güler – to initiate play from the back, while also producing goals.  That is, be a combination of Toni Kroos and Kevin De Bruyne.  A difficult task for anyone, but especially a player that is still only 20 years of age.\n\nWith little fanfare, the Real Madrid midfielder this past weekend became the leader in La Liga with 52 chances created (key passes, including assists).  That is a title that Xavi Hernández, Mesut Özil, Ángel Di María, Neymar and Lionel Messi, amongst others, have held over the last two decades.  None did so at such a precocious age.\n\nGüler’s superlative passing ability has him currently seoncd in La Liga with seven assists and third in big chances created with nine.  With his assist against Benfica, he also led Champions League midfielders with four assists, tied with Liverpool’s Dominik Szoboszlai.  The Real Madrid midfielder has provided a total of 14 assists since the start of the Club World Cup.  It has largely gone under the radar that among players from the top five European leagues since July in official club competitions, Güler’s 14 assists with Madrid are surpassed only by Michael Olise’s 18 assists with Bayern Munich.\n\nWhat is particularly impressive is that the amount of shot opportunities the Real Madrid midfielder is providing for teammates.  Güler is averaging an exceptional 3.64 chances created per 90 minutes in league play, the highest average for a leader in chances created in La Liga since his compatriot and former teammate Mesut Özil distributed 4.17 key passes/assists per 90 in the 2010/2011 season (see graph below). Also noteworthy is that nearly 35% of the Turkish midfielder’s chances have come through long passes (as defined by Opta).  Güler could become the first Real Madrid player to lead La Liga in chances created since Ángel Di María’s last season at the club over a decade ago. With sufficient playing time in a more advanced role and with Mbappé, Vinicius and Gonzalo all off to a strong 2026, Arda has an outside chance to become the first La Liga player in the last 4 seasons to distribute 100+ key passes in a season.\n\nGüler performances in Champions League play has been no less stellar where he finished the group phase 2nd in chances created with 24, averaging 3.9 per 90.  This season saw him earn his first Player of the Match award in Champions League play vs. Juventus, in what was only his fourth start on Europe’s biggest club competition stage, after distributing six key passes and collecting 10 ball recoveries.  Keep in mind that Pedri earned his first such award last season in his fifth season (25th start in Champions) at Barcelona.\n\nGüler’s partnership with Kylian Mbappé has been especially lethal.  The two have combined to produce 10 goals since the Club World Cup, nine of which were passes from the Turkish phenom to the Frenchman.  That includes six goals in league play, the most goals where two teammates combined to score in the top five European leagues this season.  In limited playing time together, Güler also seems to have developed a strong understanding with Gonzalo García, providing three assists on the Spaniard centre-forward’s goals.\n\nSkeptics point to Güler as being primarily a set-piece specialist who is weak defensively.  There are various data points that negate these false narratives.\n\n36 of 52 of Güler’s key passes in La Liga, over 69%, have come with the ball in play.  That is fifth most in La Liga, trailing only Mbappé (51), Yamal (40), Vinicius (39) and Pedri (38).\n\nDespite his slender build, Güler is a much better defender than what is commonly perceived.\n\nAccording to Statsbomb data, the Turkish midfielder leads Real Madrid in total pressures in La Liga this season with 406 and in counterpressures (pressure immediately after losing possession) with 96.\n\nEarlier this season Statsbomb data indicated that through the first nine weeks of the season, Güler was leading all La Liga players in pressure regains per 90 minutes, indicating his pressures are well-timed.\n\nMany will be surprised to learn Güler is averaging 1.20 successful tackles per 90 minutes in league play, more than Tchouaméni (1.16 per 90) and Valverde (1.09 per 90).\n\nGüler continues to improve as a ball winner. He has had 10 ball recoveries in two (Juventus, Monaco) of the six Champions League matches he started this season, an exceptional amount for anyone, but especially an attacking midfielder. His interception last week on Monaco’s half of the pitch initiated the play that led to his assist for Vinicius’s goal.\n\nPerhaps Arda needs that one special match in a Champions League elimination tie to consecrate himself as the best attacking midfielder in Europe and receive the accolades he deserves.  Don’t be surprised if that occurs this spring.",

    "description": "I started traveling full-time in 2019 and loved seeing the world. But over time, I saw the lifestyle's challenges and decided I wanted a home base.",
    "fullText": "I thrive in unfamiliar environments and get a kick out of last-minute plans and spontaneous adventures. So, it's hardly surprising I became an almost-accidental \"digital nomad\" — a term I've always found incredibly cringe-inducing, for the record.\n\nSo, I decided to pursue a life that would allow me to hop from place to place, working remotely as a freelance journalist and copywriter. And in 2019, I hit the road full-time.\n\nLike others tagging #todaysoffice on social media, I spent the following years surfing badly in Sri Lanka, climbing volcanoes in Guatemala, skiing in Colorado, and so much more.\n\nBut after almost seven years of traveling full-time, I decided I was ready for something different.\n\nAside from an extended stint in the UK during the COVID-19 pandemic, I didn't have a stable base for more than three months at a time.\n\nMy travels brought once-in-a-lifetime experiences, and I met incredible people along the way. However, over time, the cracks in the lifestyle began to show.\n\nOf course, it's hard not to sound ungrateful when talking about the downsides of traveling, but it would be dishonest to ignore them — especially in an age known for glamorizing everything.\n\nFor starters, maintaining relationships can be challenging when you're always on the move. I learned that loneliness can linger even when you're staying in five-star hotels or lounging on tropical beaches.\n\nPlus, packing and repacking every few days becomes tedious. As does the endless search for short-term accommodations, trawling the internet for somewhere with decent WiFi and a table I can work from. (Finding the motivation to work in such beautiful locations is another challenge in its own right.)\n\nAnd sadly, after a while, even the most objectively stunning sunsets become ordinary. I'm not sure when it happened, but at some point, I stopped feeling the rush I used to get from stepping off a plane in a new place (I know, play the world's smallest violin).\n\nA few years ago, in the Grenadines, I asked a captain who'd been traveling for nearly 50 years how he chose where to settle. \"You can search and search all your life,\" he told me as we sat on the bow of his catamaran, surrounded by a pale blue sky and shimmering sea. \"But sometimes you need to know when you've arrived.\"\n\nI didn't fully understand it at the time, but I do now: There's no \"perfect place\" to live.\n\nSo, after almost seven years abroad, I finally decided it was time to find a home base.\n\nChoosing where to establish my home base was harder than I expected. For a long time, nothing felt right.\n\nI wasn't looking for a traditional 9-to-5 or a forever home, just a place from which to explore, with friends and a community I wouldn't have to say goodbye to every few months. Somewhere I could do the things I love consistently, like pottery, writing, yoga, and swimming in the sea, and return to familiar surroundings.\n\nLike many decisions I made on the road, I stopped forcing it and followed what unfolded naturally.\n\nSurprisingly, this led me to a place much closer to \"home.\" I decided to settle on the northeast coast of England near Newcastle, just an hour away from where I grew up. A windswept stretch battered by rain, with concrete skies and a brutally cold sea.\n\nIt's not the tropical island I once envisioned, but it feels grounding, like I've actually arrived.\n\nI have no desire to travel yet (it's only been a few months), though I'm sure that'll come. When it does, though, it's unlikely I'll disappear as often or for as long as I used to.\n\nI'm not saying I've found long-lasting contentment just because I'm anchored to a place, but it's given me the chance to be creative, slow down, and establish routines.\n\nIt's also helped me appreciate the smaller things in my life that I'd missed, like catching up with friends, playing golf regularly with my old man, and working on projects that felt impossible to tackle while hopping between hotels.\n\nAnd it feels good to know I don't have to check out anytime soon.",

Based on a survey of 1,006 global executives in December 2025, AI is behind at least some layoffs, but that these are almost completely in anticipation of AI’s impact. In other words, the job losses and slowed hiring are real, even though companies are still waiting for generative AI to deliver on its promises.

While overall employment in the U.S. is still relatively low, there is considerable speculation that the adoption of generative AI was a cause of recent layoffs and slowed hiring, particularly in the tech industry, for entry-level workers, and in customer service and programming jobs.

    "fullText": "MELBOURNE, Australia — Elena Rybakina fended off a late Australian Open surge from Jessica Pegula in a 6-3, 7-6(7) semifinal win Thursday night, to set up a heavyweight final against the world No. 1, Aryna Sabalenka.\n\nRybakina is not the world No. 2, but the No. 5 seed is the opponent Sabalenka would least like to face. She won their last meeting in straight sets, including a tiebreak to love against a player who has won their last 20 at Grand-Slam level. That was the WTA Tour Finals championship match in November, one of Rybakina’s 20 wins in her past 21 matches. In that time, she has picked up two titles and posted a 9-0 record against top-10 opponents.\n\nWith her huge serve, easy power, clean ball-striking and underrated ability to generate huge speed even when extended, Rybakina is one of the very few players who can take the racket out of Sabalenka’s hands, as Madison Keys did to win last year’s final.\n\nShe is also the world No. 1’s temperamental opposite. Where Sabalenka wears her emotions on court and lives through them, Rybakina is near-totally zen and unreadable, even though Pegula’s late surge in the second set brought some mild anguish across Rybakina’s face. When she won the Wimbledon title in 2022, her reaction was more akin to someone being told they could finish work early than someone who had just won their first Grand Slam.\n\nSabalenka may not appreciate how relaxed Rybakina will seem when she, by contrast, will be outwardly battling the stress of trying to avoid losing a third Grand Slam final out of four.\n\nSabalenka was busy performing media duties after hammering Elina Svitolina in her own semifinal, but when she sits down to watch Rybakina’s defeat of Pegula Thursday night, she will see a rival playing with complete conviction, bar a late wobble down the stretch. Things otherwise look so uncomplicated for Rybakina when her game is song, built around arguably the best serve on the WTA Tour.\n\nShe won the first six points of the match against Pegula, breaking early to go 3-0 up after 10 minutes. That break was all Rybakina needed to roll through the first set, winning 77 per cent of first-serve points and 79 percent on the second. She didn’t face a break point.\n\nAs against Iga Świątek in the quarters, Rybakina’s serving fluency meant she could tee off once the rallies got started, rocking Pegula back on her heels so much that she frequently gestured to her box about the experience.\n\nPegula, who hadn’t dropped a set all tournament until Thursday night, had found a way to diffuse and redirect Keys and Amanda Anisimova’s power back on them in the previous two rounds, but this was another level. And when she had 30-30 on her opponent’s serve early in the second set, Rybakina slammed the door shut with a huge ace down the T. She then broke in the next game for 2-1, with a devastating inside-out forehand return winner.\n\nThe pair then exchanged breaks, before a pair of aces helped Rybakina hold for 4-2. Pegula, a U.S. Open finalist two years ago and in the best form of her career, was fighting hard, but it felt like she was always swimming against the tide. When a fourth ace flew by her to move Rybakina to 5-3, Pegula let out a resigned “yeah” — summing up the powerlessness she must have been feeling. A game later it looked set to be all over, as Rybakina attempted to ease her opponent into submission one last time.\n\nA forehand return that flew onto the line for a winner to bring up a third match point drew another look of disbelief from Pegula, before a rare Rybakina forehand miss earned an even rarer show of annoyance.\n\nBut Rybakina could not convert any of them, and the very next game Pegula hit two return winners to go up 0-30. Rybakina drew even with the strength of her serve, but one tight forehand in the net and another long gave Pegula a break. The tension was clear, as Rybakina immediately broke back before again being broken, tightening up as the finish line approached and what had looked like a routine win instead headed for a tiebreak.\n\nOnce there, Pegula had two set points to take the match the distance, but Rybakina staved them off on the back of her serve. setting up a forehand onto the baseline with one huge one before an ace down the T took her to a fourth match point. This time there was no mistake, as one last clean-as-a-whistle backhand flew past Pegula for a return winner.\n\nAfter their straight-set semifinal wins, even with the late tension in the latter, Sabalenka and Rybakina will now meet with neither having dropped a set on their way to the final. They are undeniably the two best players in the world right now, and their meeting will be a repeat of the final here in 2023, which Sabalenka won in three thrilling sets. That was Sabalenka’s first major title, while Rybakina has not been to a major final since.\n\nEverything is set up for another barnburner Saturday, when the sequence of one-sided and straight-sets matches will be tested to the max by two such well-matched players. So while this is the final Sabalenka probably wanted to avoid, it is also one that fans desperate for a sustained competitive encounter will be relishing.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Athletic.\n\n2026 The Athletic Media Company",

    "fullText": "The Ukrainian superstar Elina Svitolina has a shot at glory today, as she takes on world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka in the Australian Open semifinals. It’s been a surreal run so far for the Olympic bronze medalist in Melbourne. With one more win, the No. 12 seed has a chance to become the first Ukrainian woman ever to reach a Grand Slam final. In hindsight, this journey wouldn’t be possible without the steadfast support from her family.\n\nMikhaylo Svitolin is the man behind the scenes of Elina Svitolina’s tennis success. Before he was a tennis dad, he was a competitive wrestler in Ukraine. Professionally, he made his living as a real estate agent in Odesa, but his real passion was always been sports. Interestingly, Elina has mentioned that she only started playing tennis at the age of 5 because she wanted her dad’s attention, as he was busy traveling for tournaments with her older brother, Yulian.\n\nAs Elina got better and better, Mikhaylo stepped up as her early coach and mentor. The biggest sacrifice came when she was just 12. As per advice from the businessman Yuriy Sapronov, the millionaire who caught Elina’s talents while she was playing in a local tournament, the family made a decision to move from Odesa to Kharkiv so she could train at a professional academy to have better shots of making the pro, some 350 miles from her hometown.\n\nLooking back, it was one big gamble, but safe to say, the investment is paying in dividends now, helping her eventually reach the world No. 3 ranking.\n\nOlena Svitolina is a powerhouse in her own right. She was a competitive rower before moving on to professional bowling by the time Elina began focusing on tennis.\n\nShe was known for being a strict but incredibly supportive parent. She often told Elina that coming from Ukraine meant she had to work twice as hard as anyone else to get noticed on the world stage. Elina openly admitted she wouldn’t be the player she is today without her mom.\n\n“My mom always supported me. This is very important, especially in tennis, given how much time you spend on the road, at tournaments, away from friends and family… the sport of tennis is such that almost every week you have losses happen, it’s hard… my mother gives and continues to give me strength and faith in the fact that I can be a better tennis player.”\n\nYou can take a hint from her dedication. Olena’s love for the game and her professional career were so impeccable that when the family decided to move from Odesa to Kharkiv for Elina’s elite training, Olena stayed behind for two months to finish her bowling commitments before joining them.\n\nEven now, in 2026, Olena is still Elina’s biggest cheerleader. These days, she wears more of a spectator and grandma first.\n\nElina Svitolina was born in Ukraine to Ukrainian parents, Mikhaylo and Olena. Her dad has Jewish roots through her grandmother, Tamara. However, during her tennis career, she received several offers from other countries to change her nationality and play for them, often with a lot of money involved. However, she always chose to represent Ukraine.\n\nThe parents got involved very early in her career, with Mikhaylo serving as her former coach and Olena deliberately pushing her and making her work twice as hard to make it to the big leagues. Her parents followed her to every match and expecting constant victory. Around 2015, they collectively decided it was best for them to step back from traveling with her, allowing her to gain independence and take ownership of her career. Today, her parents remain her primary motivators and a constant source of strength.\n\nBut these days their role has changed quite a bit. It revolves less around Elina, more around Skai, their granddaughter, so Elina and her husband Gaël Monfils can focus on their matches. Safe to say, parents have traded their “coach” hats for “grandparent” hats.\n\nThe post Who Are Elina Svitolina Parents?

    "fullText": "Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Limited (CATL), world’s battery manufacturing giant, officially unveiled its Tianxing II light commercial vehicle battery series on January 22, 2026. The highlight of the launch is the low-temperature version, which represents the industry’s first mass-produced sodium-ion battery.\n\nThe 45 kWh sodium-ion battery boasts an energy density of 175Wh/kg and a cycle life exceeding 10,000 cycles. It is the world’s first battery to receive certification under the new GB 38031-2025 national standard and is designed to power small and micro vans and light trucks.\n\nCompared to lithium batteries, this battery has exceptional cold-weather performance. In extreme temperatures as low as -40°C, the battery maintains 90% of its usable capacity. Moreover, it allows for immediate charging even when completely frozen at -30°C, eliminating the winter operation challenges faced by commercial vehicles in cold regions.\n\nSodium is over 1,000 times more abundant in the earth’s crust than lithium, with extraction costs at merely 1/20 of lithium. This cost advantage is expected to reduce battery costs and improve the economic feasibility of light commercial electric vehicles in the long term.\n\nBeyond the low-temperature sodium-ion version, the Tianxing II series includes three additional variants (lithium-ion type):\n\nThe Fast-Charging Version features high-rate charging technology that powers the battery from 20% to 80% in 18 minutes. For standard 100 kWh electric vehicles, a single fast charge can add approximately 150 kilometers of range.\n\nThe Long-Range Version sets a new record for light commercial vehicles with a single-pack capacity of 253 kWh, achieving a maximum range of 800km. This variant is designed primarily for long-distance logistics between cities. When paired with CATL’s Taishan pack architecture, it reduces vehicle weight by approximately 260kg compared to batteries with equivalent capacity, increasing effective payload while reducing energy consumption.\n\nThe High-Temperature Fast-Charging Version targets last-mile delivery and self-owned vehicle operations, particularly in southern high-temperature regions. Equipped with a customized liquid cooling thermal management system, it maintains stable fast-charging performance and battery life in high-temperature environments. This version balances high reliability with low operating costs, making it suitable for short-distance, high-frequency light commercial scenarios such as supermarket deliveries and community distribution.\n\nTianxing is a battery brand for commercial vehicles, launched by CATL in July 2024.",

    "fullText": "The International Monetary Fund projects another year of solid global economic growth — but it's also warning not to take the continued upward trajectory for granted.\n\nThe IMF predicts that the global economy will grow 3.3% in 2026, mirroring that 3.3% growth seen in 2025, with 2027 expected to see similar gains.\n\n\"The world economy is resilient but you should not take this resilience for granted,\" Kristalina Georgieva, managing director of IMF said at an event on Monday.\n\nAccording to Georgieva, there are four things that are driving up growth, and at least one is being overlooked by observers.\n\nHere's what the IMF sees pushing the world economy higher.\n\nGovernments around the world have let the private sector take the reins. With \"governments put out from running the economy where they don't belong,\" private sector strength supports growth, Georgieva said.\n\nThe economist said in remarks at Davos that governments taking a back seat allows the private sector to be \"more adaptable, more agile, and we see the benefits of it\".\n\nThe global economy's recent growth has been less tied to trade, mitigating the impacts many had feared from Donald Trump's aggressive tariff policy.\n\nThe fact that effective tariff rates are below liberation day levels has meant the impact has been significantly less than initially feared.\n\nDespite trade tensions spurred by tariffs, \"we continue to trade for now,\" Georgieva says, adding, \"don't take this for granted.\"\n\nGlobal AI spending reached 1.76 trillion in 2025 and is projected to grow to $3.34 trillion in 2026, according to Gartner.\n\nThe \"massive investment in AI\" has served to boost optimism in the global economy, Georgieva said.\n\nThe IMF economist says one factor that is often forgotten when assessing global economic growth is \"the role of good policies and strong institutions.\"\n\nGeorgieva flagged the role of independent central banks, specifically, in the resilient global economy. She said tht these things are often given little attention but, and as a result, that could \"erode\" that source of strength.\n\nCentral bank independence is a key concern in the US as President Trump's administration pressures Fed chair Jerome Powell. The latest tensions have arisen from a criminal investigation by the DOJ into Powell's testimony about the Fed building renovation.\n\nTrump has been vocal in his criticism of the Fed chair, rattling markets with his threats to fire Powell over the last year.",

    "fullText": "Gold and silver prices have soared in the midst of global geopolitical uncertainty, concerns about the global role of the dollar, long-simmering inflation and general economic uncertainty.\n\nRegular readers of my column know that I have always advised keeping a portion of your assets in gold and gold mining shares or mutual funds. (Search my columns at TerrySavage.com using the key word “gold” and going back more than a decade.) But with today’s huge rise in gold prices, those investments have significantly increased in value, almost demanding that you evaluate your long-term positions.\n\nSome economic background is in order. CME Group Chief Economist Erik Norland has written a definitive guide to the economic forces moving the precious metals markets. He notes: “Gold ... is up 80% as of January 21. Palladium is up 105%, platinum up 175% and silver prices have tripled, rising 212%.” (That appreciation figure has since changed. You can read the entire report, including graphics, at the CME Group website.)\n\nIn an interview I asked about the dramatic rise in the price of gold. Norland explained there are five main drivers of demand:\n\nIt’s not just the United States that is running a budget deficit — currently 6% of GDP, without accounting for proposed increases in military spending. Norland notes that European nations are currently increasing their defense spending allocations, as is Canada. The Japanese have always had a huge public debt as a percentage of GDP, and now even China’s public debt is running at 8.5% of GDP. The implication is that all that spending will generate a new round of “money printing” — i.e., inflation.\n\nThe key ingredient of Norland’s outlook is the fact that inflation is just barely under control around the world, running above targets set by all central banks. In the United States, for example, the latest report of the Fed’s preferred inflation indicator (PCE) came in at 2.8% — well above the Fed’s 2% target.\n\nNorland notes that despite the underlying inflationary pressures, almost every central bank is in the process of lowering interest rates. That’s the opposite of what central banks usually do to fight inflation. The exceptions are Japan, which already has such very low rates, and Brazil.\n\n—Perceived erosion of central bank independence\n\nFor nearly 80 years, central banks have “managed” currencies through interest rates and currency purchases or interventions. Their role has been to manage the balance of currencies needed for stability and world trade. But it’s not just the U.S. Federal Reserve bank that is feeling pressure to bend to political will. It’s happening around the world.",

    "fullText": "The UK is the country with no bloc.\n\nAt Davos, Britain refused to join Trump's Board of Peace, citing commitment to international law and rejection of the \"pay-to-play\" model. France, Germany, Sweden, Norway made the same choice. The difference is that those countries have somewhere else to go. Britain doesn't.\n\nThe SAFE instrument, the EU's €150 billion fund for joint defense procurement, is designed explicitly for strategic autonomy. Strict \"Buy European\" provisions limit non-EU subcontractors to 15-35% of contract value, phased out within two years. Canada, remarkably, negotiated access and now has preferential treatment on par with EU firms. The UK remains excluded.\n\nTalks broke down in late 2025. The EU's requirements for third-country participation, London viewed as an infringement on sovereignty. The same sovereignty concerns that drove Brexit now lock Britain out of the emerging European defense architecture. The \"mid-Atlantic bridge\" was always a metaphor. Britain positioned itself as the hinge between American power and European integration, useful to both, dependent on neither. That positioning assumed both poles wanted a bridge. Now the US treats allies as protection rackets and the EU is building walls around its defense industrial base. The bridge has nowhere to land.\n\nWhat does the Starmer government do? The choices were supposed to be theoretical. Align with Washington and accept the transactional terms of the Donroe Doctrine. Align with Brussels and accept the sovereignty constraints of SAFE participation. Or go it alone, with a defense budget that can't sustain independent capability against peer competitors.\n\nThe IISS analysis of SAFE's implications for non-EU suppliers is blunt: firms outside the bloc face structural disadvantages that compound over time. Procurement cycles last decades. If British defense firms are locked out of European contracts now, the gap widens with each passing year. The industrial base erodes.\n\n\"Global Britain\" was the slogan after Brexit, a vision of nimble bilateral relationships unconstrained by Brussels bureaucracy. The reality is that global influence requires either hard power or bloc membership. Britain has neither the military budget for the former nor the political will for the latter.\n\nCanada's pivot is instructive. Facing similar pressure from Washington, Carney diversified, joining SAFE, negotiating with Beijing, building horizontal coalitions with other middle powers. Britain has done none of this. It refused the Board of Peace on principle but hasn't found an alternative structure to join on pragmatism.\n\nPrinciples without alternatives is just isolation. The UK is learning what it means to be a middle power without a coalition, morally opposed to the new American order but structurally excluded from the European one.",

While the chain is making good on its promise to get customers their orders within four minutes during its busiest times, he said, its stores don't consistently meet that goal during slower times of the day.\n\nThe four-minute goal was one of the early changes Niccol outlined after becoming Starbucks' CEO in 2024.\n\n\"There still is opportunity, frankly, to get the entire business — every transaction — to be under four minutes,\" Niccol said.",

This would be around the same time as Jupiter and Venus appear in close proximity to each other and shortly before Musk turns 55 on 28 June.\n\nThe FT also reported that SpaceX is seeking to raise $50bn – valuing it at $1.5tn – compared with previous reports that it was looking for $25bn at an $800bn valuation. Last week, it was reported that the rocket company was considering Bank of America, JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley for leading roles in the share sale.\n\nMusk, whose $680bn fortune would be turbo-boosted by a SpaceX flotation, said last year the company’s annual revenue would be $15.5bn, with $1.1bn of that coming from contracts with Nasa. The billionaire owns about 42% of SpaceX, as well as nearly 17% of the electric carmaker Tesla, where he is chief executive. He also owns more than three-quarters of the social media platform X.\n\nSpaceX generates revenues from deploying reusable rockets for missions such as launching satellites and restocking the International Space Station. It also operates the Starlink satellite high-speed internet service.\n\nIf the flotation goes ahead it would involve a bigger initial fundraising than the IPO of the oil company Saudi Aramco, which raised $29bn in 2019, although for a larger total valuation of $1.7tn.\n\nThe chief financial officer of SpaceX, Bret Johnsen, has held talks and video conference calls with existing private investors since December to explore a mid-2026 IPO, the FT added.\n\nMusk has reportedly been swayed by the idea of a SpaceX float because of its growing valuation and the success of Starlink.\n\nGlobal financial markets are anticipating a year of significant US listings, with the artificial intelligence companies Anthropic and OpenAI also laying early groundwork for potential IPOs.\n\nA rebound in the US equity capital market activity began in 2025 after three years of limited activity, partly as the result of volatility and geopolitical tensions. Space technology is a tightly held sector but is sought after by investors keen for exposure in light of rapid development prospects, analysts have said.\n\nNeil Wilson, an analyst at Saxo Capital Markets, said the mooted $1.5tn price tag was a “monster premium”.\n\nHe added: “A valuation that big reflects not just a tech and AI premium but Elon Musk’s stardust and a frothy market, plus a heck of a lot of media narrative around this. It is to some degree a kind of bet on the future space economy.”\n\nSpaceX has been approached for comment.",

    "fullText": "Beijing’s AI policy is focused on real-life applications but Chinese companies are beginning to articulate their own grand visions\n\nStanding on stage in the eastern China tech hub of Hangzhou, Alibaba’s normally media-shy CEO made an attention-grabbing announcement. “The world today is witnessing the dawn of an AI-driven intelligent revolution,” Eddie Wu told a developer conference in September. “Artificial general intelligence (AGI) will not only amplify human intelligence but also unlock human potential, paving the way for the arrival of artificial superintelligence (ASI).”\n\nASI, Wu said, “could produce a generation of ‘super scientists’ and ‘full-stack super engineers’”, who would “tackle unsolved scientific and engineering problems at unimaginable speeds”.\n\nWu also announced plans to invest 380bn yuan (£40bn) in AI infrastructure over the next three years, news that sent Alibaba stocks soaring to their highest in nearly four years.\n\nWu’s foray into the existential, techno-frontier rhetoric normally deployed by western tech CEOs such as OpenAI’s Sam Altman and DeepMind’s Demis Hassabis caught the attention of observers. “Wu’s ASI speech represents a breakthrough,” the tech writer Afra Wang wrote in her China AI newsletter, Concurrent. “Major Chinese companies are beginning to articulate their own grand visions that carry the flavour of future prophecy.”\n\nAGI, a theoretical state of AI where a highly autonomous system is able to do a human’s job, has become the preoccupation of American tech companies such as OpenAI and DeepMind. Many see it as the next frontier of civilisation, and are in competition with each other, and China, to get there. In May, the president of Microsoft, Brad Smith, told a US Senate committee on AI that the “race between the United States and China for international influence likely will be won by the fastest first mover”.\n\nMany in Washington have internalised these fears. The US-China economic and scurity review commission has recommended that Congress “establish and fund a Manhattan Project-like program dedicated to racing to and acquiring an artificial general intelligence (AGI) capability”. The Manhattan Project was a second world war-era research operation to produce nuclear weapons.\n\nIn China, many saw Wu’s speech as articulating the vision of a bold, singular tech company, but not one that represented China’s overall AI industry.\n\n“China certainly has research groups working towards AGI. But most AI companies are working towards better applications,” said Ya-Qin Zhang, the dean of Tsinghua University’s Institute for AI Industry Research and former president of the tech company Baidu.\n\nA combination of limited computing power, a pragmatic approach to technology and a keen awareness of the present day potential of AI has steered China’s national AI policy towards real-life applications rather than frontier research.\n\nIn August, the Chinese government published its highly anticipated “AI+ strategy”. The policy document outlined how AI could turbocharge China’s development goals, such as by using AI to improve medical diagnoses and make supply chains more efficient. But it made no mention of AGI.\n\n“The Chinese government is intently focused on reaping the benefits of AI in the here and now and in the near future through diffusion and application of AI across the economy, society, defence, and other areas,” said Julian Gewirtz, a former senior director for China and Taiwan at the White House national security council. “Despite its goal to ‘catch up and surpass’ the United States, we shouldn’t assume that the Chinese Communist party has bought into the idea that AGI is imminent.”\n\n“If you’re just looking at what has been officially published … there is no clear acknowledgment of AGI at all,” said Selina Xu, a China tech analyst. Xu noted that Xi Jinping, China’s leader, had a history of preferring the physical economy to more intangible forces.\n\n“It’s a very different narrative from the AGI race as a lot of people in DC see it,” Xu said.\n\nOne of the biggest factors guiding this strategy is the fact that US sanctions have prevented Chinese companies from acquiring the world’s most sophisticated semiconductors, which are needed for advanced AI research.\n\nWashington has banned the sale of hi-tech microchips to China in an effort to rein in the country’s AI development. Nvidia, the world’s leading chipmaker, then developed more basic semiconductors specifically for the Chinese market. In December, Washington approved the Nvidia’s second-most advanced chips, the H200s, for sale in China. But Beijing has reportedly told custom agents that the chips cannot be imported into China, as the government seeks to break the country’s reliance on overseas technology.\n\nChina insists that “necessity is the mother of invention” and points to the success of companies such as DeepSeek as proof that the US restrictions will merely spur innovation. DeepSeek’s founder, Liang Wenfeng, is one of the few Chinese tech leaders who, like Alibaba’s Wu, has openly expressed an interest in AGI.\n\nBut until China is able to produce its own advanced semiconductors at scale, most tech companies feel it is more profitable to use the hardware they already have to focus on AI applications rather than AGI.\n\nAnother factor guiding the US-China tech competition is the availability of datacentres and the energy to power them. In November, Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, said China would “win the AI race” in part because of its energy subsidies for datacentres.\n\nThe subsidies were reportedly introduced after Chinese tech companies complained of higher electricity bills caused by the domestic semiconductors they are obliged to use, which are less efficient than Nvidia’s. In a sign of how determined China is to break its reliance on imported technology, Reuters reported that any datacentres in receipt of state funds could only use domestic chips.\n\nSuch measures would reduce Nvidia’s competitive advantage in China and boost domestic chip producers, such as Huawei.\n\nSince 2021, China has reportedly poured $100bn into support for AI datacentres.\n\nBut there are signs that the boom may have been overzealous. A recent report from the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology said that nationwide, the utilisation rate for AI datacentres was 32%.\n\nIn a recent op-ed in China Economic Weekly, Rao Shaoyang, the director at the China Telecom Research Institute, wrote that in some regions of China, the computing power industry was operating in a similar fashion to China’s beleaguered property sector: build first, find buyers later. He cautioned against “blindly building intelligent computing centres” and said local computing power demand should be considered before building new datacentres.\n\nDespite the surplus in more general computing power, many experts believe China still does not have chips that are sophisticated enough to explore frontier research in AGI. But analysts note that the mood could change quickly.\n\n“The current status quo is highly fluid, and Xi Jinping has explicitly declared an ambition to lead the world in AI,” said Gewirtz. “So the fact that China construes that goal one way at this snapshot moment in time does not give me any comfort that in a year they’re going to construe it the same way.”\n\nAdditional research by Lillian Yang",

    "fullText": "Founder of the world wide web says commercialisation means the net has been ‘optimised for nastiness’, but collaboration and compassion can prevail\n\nGet our breaking news email, free app or daily news podcast\n\nWhen Sir Tim Berners-Lee invented the world wide web in 1989, his vision was clear: it would used by everyone, filled with everything and, crucially, it would be free.\n\nToday, the British computer scientist’s creation is regularly used by 5.5 billion people – and bears little resemblance to the democratic force for humanity he intended.\n\nIn Australia to promote his book, This is for Everyone, Berners-Lee is reflecting on what his invention has become – and how he and a community of collaborators can put the power of the web back into the hands of its users.\n\nBerners-Lee describes his excitement in the earliest years of the web as “uncontainable”. Approaching 40 years on, a rebellion is brewing among himself and a community of like-minded activists and developers.\n\n“We can fix the internet … It’s not too late,” he writes, describing his mission as a “battle for the soul of the web”.\n\nBerners-Lee traces the first corruption of the web to the commercialisation of the domain name system, which he believes would have served web users better had it been managed by a nonprofit in the public interest. Instead, he says, in the 1990s the .com space was pounced on by “charlatans”.\n\n“The Americans were very keen about commercialising the internet … crossing the boundary from being an academic thing to being a commercial thing,” he tells Guardian Australia from Brisbane.\n\nThe pursuit of profit soon became a driving force in how the internet was designed. But it wasn’t until 2016 – the same year he won the Turing award – that the US elections showed Berners-Lee just how toxic the web could be. Two years later, he told Vanity Fair that he was “devastated” by the abuses of the web.\n\nFor 35 years, Berners-Lee has written what he considers to be the world’s first blog. One post, published in June 2024, is dominated by a crowded map of “everything on the internet”. It is a reminder of the web’s overall beneficence – from email and Zoom to health, podcasts, collaboration, creativity and digital sovereignty, the diagram shows the web is, for the most part, good.\n\nBut to the left of the diagram is a cluster of red, including X, Snapchat, YouTube, “feed manipulation for engagement”, addiction, polarisation, disinformation and mental illness. This corner of the web, its creator says, has been “optimised for nastiness”. It is extractive and surveillance-heavy.\n\n“It’s only a small part of the whole internet … but the problem is that people spend a lot of time on [social media websites] because they’re addictive,” he says.\n\nSign up: AU Breaking News email\n\nGiven it was always supposed to be human-like in its sprawling connectivity, perhaps its darker sides were inevitable.\n\n“Yes and no,” Berners-Lee says. “There used to be a sort of mantra that technology was neutral and people are good and bad. But actually, that’s not true of things on the web.\n\n“The way you design a website, like Reddit or Pinterest or Snapchat, can be explicitly good.” Or, designed with engagement as a priority, its algorithm can be explicitly bad.\n\nCompounding the problem is monopolisation. Facebook and Google’s dominance is bad for innovation and bad for the web, he says, because monopolies get in the way of building systems that are truly pro-human. How many companies, after all, hold your (identical) data in non-transparent and incompatible systems?\n\nSince Berners-Lee’s disappointment a decade ago, he’s thrown everything at a project that completely shifts the way data is held on the web, known as the Solid (social linked data) protocol. It’s activism that is rooted in people power – not unlike the first years of the web.\n\nThis version of the internet would turbocharge personal sovereignty and give control back to users.\n\n“When people are excited, they get a twinkle in their eye and they start coding just because of what they can imagine,” he says of developers who “get” the concept.\n\nHe likens Solid “pods” to backpacks of data that are securely held by each individual, allowing them to choose what to share with certain people, businesses and organisations. Department of Education data could be shared with an AI tutor; medical data with a cousin, doctor and nutritionist. The Flanders government in Belgium treats data as a national utility and is already using Solid pods for its citizens.\n\nThe Facebooks and Xs of the world need not join in – the new systems will be so empowering, collaborative and compassionate, he believes, that parts of today’s web will become obsolescent.\n\n“The existing systems will fade to a certain extent, because people will get more excited in new systems,” he says.\n\n“Being able to collaborate across the world with friends and family and colleagues will be something that they end up getting addicted to – a much better form of addiction.”\n\nHe’s not the only person wanting to fix these problems. Australia’s world-first social media ban – which blocks under-16s from using a host of sites including Snapchat, X, Facebook and YouTube – is one attempt at a solution. Although Berners-Lee is not convinced.\n\n“I’m interested to see how it goes down in Australia, because there are people in the UK who are proposing it in a similar way, and others may follow on,” he says.\n\n“The first question is whether kids should be using those particular social media sites. I think you have to recognise that things like messaging services are useful.”\n\nInstead, he’s in favour of smartphones that are especially designed for children, blocking access to harmful sites. He points to the Other phone, designed in collaboration with Mumsnet users, as an alternative to devices that allow unfettered access to social media.\n\nIt’s on the subject of artificial intelligence that his optimism plummets.\n\nBerners-Lee has long seen AI – which exists only because of the web and its data – as having the potential to transform society far beyond the boundaries of self-interested companies. But now is the time, he says, to put guardrails in place so that AI remains a force for good – and he’s afraid the chance may pass humankind by.\n\n“The horse is bolting,” he says of reining in AI’s unchecked development and growing intelligence.\n\nBerners-Lee created the web, HTML and HTTP at Cern, the home of the Large Hadron Collider, on the outskirts of Geneva. Cern’s scientific, non-commercial approach was key to the way the technology was shared.\n\n“I would like to see a Cern for AI, where all the top scientists come together and see whether they can make a super intelligence. And, if they can, they contain it into a system where it can’t just go out and persuade people to let it run the world.”\n\nRight now, though, given the division sown in part by that red corner of the web, we are “very, very far from a Cern for AI”, he says.\n\n“We have got AI being done in these huge companies, but also in these huge silos. They’re not looking over each other’s shoulder. They’re just sitting there, inside their own company, looking at their own system, trying to make it smarter.\n\n“I don’t see a way that we can get to a point where the scientific community gets to look at the AI and to decide whether it is safe or not.”\n\nSir Tim Berners-Lee will be speaking at the Brisbane Powerhouse on Thursday 29 January and the Sydney Opera House on Friday 30 January",
