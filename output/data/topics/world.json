    "description": "CEO JT Batson says the tournament is forcing brands to see the value of the sport’s fans.",
    "fullText": "The 2026 FIFA World Cup — jointly hosted by the US, Canada, and Mexico— represents a coming of age for the sport that most of the world calls football in the country that calls it soccer. JT Batson, CEO of US Soccer, hopes the kickoff to the tournament this June will also be a vindication of four years of work to modernize the group behind the US men’s and women’s national teams, and a moment for more brands to understand the spending power of their fans.\n\n“Having the World Cup here has been a bit of a forcing function to crisply articulate your soccer strategy as a brand,” he says. US Soccer counts two dozen commercial partners, from American Airlines and AT&T to Visa and Volkswagen, who Batson says have been drawn by the demographics of the sport’s large US fanbase. “It’s growing, it’s young, it’s diverse, and it’s tech savvy; those are all things you care about as a brand.”\n\nSurveys suggest the sport has the momentum to build that fan base further. A Harris Poll last year found the number of US soccer followers increased 17% between 2020 and 2025. Almost three-quarters of Americans now say they are interested in soccer, of whom 20% describe themselves as “obsessed.”\n\nUS Soccer’s own growth has exceeded that pace: Its revenues are up more than 300% since 2023, as it changed its commercial model to bring sponsorship, media, and marketing rights in-house. Batson has pulled in record philanthropic donations, including $50 million from Home Depot co-founder Arthur Blank for a new national training center in Atlanta, and $30 million from Washington Spirit owner Michele Kang for women’s and girls’ programs.\n\nAnother factor has helped the corporate interest, Batson adds: the fact that many large companies are run by executives who grew up watching the sport. “Generations ago, that was not the case.”\n\nBatson, an early employee of Mozilla who had played for Augusta Arsenal in Georgia before becoming a referee, came to his job after a chance encounter with US Soccer’s board chair on an Amtrak train. “I learned it was a nonprofit that didn’t do fundraising, so I went home and made a fundraising strategy,” he recalls. He joined as a volunteer before being made CEO in 2022. Here’s how he describes his game plan for the World Cup and the sport he now oversees.\n\nAndrew Edgecliffe-Johnson: US Soccer’s revenues have increased by more than 300% since 2023. What has it taken to do that?\n\nJT Batson: The biggest thing for us is embracing that we are a soccer nation. We’ve grown a tremendous amount since the 1994 women’s World Cup, and we set out a strategy last year of being “in service to soccer.” We asked ourselves, “If we stepped out of our role and were back to being a fan, what would we hope US Soccer would be doing?” There were three things we needed at the same time to unlock our potential: trust, the right strategy, and the right communication. If you’re missing any one of those three, this doesn’t work.\n\nWhat has driven the growth in corporate partnerships?\n\nFirst, the US soccer market is large, with well over 100 million fans. Second, the US men’s and women’s national teams are among the most popular teams in the country. And third, so many people in positions of responsibility in corporations are soccer people through and through. In a previous generation, maybe they’d have been football people or baseball people or basketball people. This generation deeply understands the sport and cares about it as a growth driver. A number of big brands have told us their No. 1 growth priority is soccer.\n\nWhat’s your strategy for using the World Cup to elevate soccer in the US?\n\nFirst, we’ve got to make sure that our team is in the best position to win. We’ve hired the best possible coaches for our team, and we’ve got a great player pool. We’re also very focused on making sure everyone in America can participate. So we’re making it super accessible to go into a Walmart or a CVS and buy US Soccer gear, and we’re supporting watch parties in hundreds of communities.\n\nWhat we want to hold ourselves accountable to is being in a position where soccer is the most-played sport in every community. We’ve announced initiatives around soccer in schools, aimed at ensuring anyone who wants to play soccer can play. We also focus on making sure kids are having fun. Very often there’s a professionalization of kids’ sports at too young an age. Of course we want to produce players who can win World Cups, but at its core, you want to train hard when you’re having fun.\n\nCritics including New York Mayor Zohran Mamdani are concerned that World Cup tickets will be unaffordable. Is the sport pricing fans out?\n\nAll sports are having to confront the fact there are way more people who want to be in the stands than there are seats. We’re very mindful of that, [so] for all our games, we’ll have a reserved set of tickets that are very affordable for our core fans. We’re looking at how we leverage technology to ensure our diehard fans are closest to the field.\n\nWith 27 national teams, you’re surrounded by coaches. What have you learned about leadership from them?\n\nI’ve asked them about the dynamics of managing a team and they ask me as many questions around managing a business. What we find is that there’s a lot in common. Probing an analogous space leads you to learn and stretch.\n\nWhat leads to success in soccer is very similar to what leads to success in business. A key thing is to remember that every market is unique. If you enter a new market and you do not become a student of that market and learn everything about it, the rules, it’s going to eat you up and spit you out. You can have the greatest [product], but if you can’t solve for the consumers in that market, you can waste a whole lot of time and money.\n\nWill soccer in the US one day have the global status that the Premier League, the Bundesliga, or Serie A do now?\n\nOur market is very big. It is growing, we now have infrastructure, and we have talent. You’ve also got a generation of Americans who’ve grown up when they’ve only known Major League Soccer to exist and it’s a core part of their media diet. Talent is a leading indicator of success in an organization, and the talent that’s choosing to go to MLS is getting better and better. Then you apply the great commercialization of sport in the US, and you’re onto something. The [team] owners in the US are the best in the world. Think about their resources and their sports business acumen. The Bundesliga or Serie A don’t have that. The ownership depth and breadth is a huge strategic advantage.\n\nUS Soccer held a summit in Washington, DC, in December that drew more than 400 partners and donors, highlighting the organization’s “financial glow-up” under Batson, Sports Business Journal reported.",

    "description": "Formula 1 has a turbulent history with drivers from the US, with some struggling to score a point while others claimed world titles. Here are the five American drivers who managed to win in F1",
    "fullText": "America’s domestic motorsport scene is one of the strongest in the world, which perhaps explains why so few drivers from the United States have made a big impact in Formula 1. It pays to stay at home.\n\nWith increasing American interest in grand prix racing, that could change in the years to come but – as of 2026 – just five American drivers have won a world championship F1 race.\n\nWe’re excluding the fine winners of the Indianapolis 500, which counted for the world championship between 1950-60 but had almost no crossover (and largely different machinery) with the rest of the F1 calendar.\n\nSo, here are the famous five that did crack F1 at least once…\n\nWins: 1\nStarts: 52\nBest championship position: 3rd (1963)\n\nA fine test driver with good mechanical sympathy, Richie Ginther helped Ferrari and BRM win constructors’ titles in the early 1960s.\n\nFollowing success in American sportscar racing, Ginther was encouraged to head to Europe by friend Phil Hill. Ginther scored a podium in just his second world championship start, finishing runner-up to Stirling Moss in the 1961 Monaco GP after a performance Ginther would later select as the race of his life.\n\nAlthough rarely a match for team-mates Hill and Wolfgang Von Trips, Ginther added another couple of podiums as Ferrari dominated the season. He then joined BRM for 1962 and supported Graham Hill’s title challenge, playing his part in a 1-2 at Monza.\n\nGiven the unreliability of the time, Ginther’s 1963 campaign was remarkable and he scored points in all but two rounds. That was enough for third in the points, behind only runaway champion Jim Clark and Graham Hill, and ahead of race winner and Ferrari team leader John Surtees.\n\nPersonal issues hampered Ginther’s 1964 season, but he still scored two podiums and finished fifth in the table before joining the fledgling Honda operation. Once again, Ginther’s experience and hard work bore fruit and this time he got to reap the rewards, taking his one and only world championship victory in the 1965 Mexican finale.\n\nThere were only sporadic outings thereafter as Ginther focused on other things, including team management, but his tally of 14 podiums has only been surpassed by three other Americans.\n\nWins: 2\nStarts: 30\nBest championship position: 5th (1972, 1973)\n\nPeter Revson’s initial foray into F1 as a 25-year-old in 1964 was unsuccessful, but things were different the second time around. Having built his experience and standing in America, Revson won the 1971 Can-Am title and qualified on pole for that year’s Indy 500, both with McLaren.\n\nHe joined the team’s F1 squad for 1972, alongside Denny Hulme. Revson took pole for the Canadian GP in the M19C and scored four podiums on his way to fifth in the points, two spots behind 1967 world champion Hulme.\n\nBeaten only by one of Jackie Stewart’s greatest drives in the 1973 South African GP, Revson then got to drive Gordon Coppuck’s brilliant M23. It was in this car that Revson would take his two world championship successes.\n\nRevson, who had qualified on the front row with the same time as team-mate Hulme, avoided the mayhem caused by Jody Scheckter at the British GP. Revson battled the Lotuses of Emerson Fittipaldi and Ronnie Peterson after the restart and took the lead on lap 39 of 67 before going on to win by 2.8 seconds, with Hulme on Peterson’s tail in third.\n\nRevson again qualified on the front row in Canada (ahead of fellow M23 driver Scheckter). He initially fell back in a wet race but held his nerve amid a chaotic event, which included F1’s first use of a pace/safety car, to take victory – once there’d been an investigation to confirm Fittipaldi hadn’t won!\n\nRevson again finished the year fifth in the standings, but this time he was ahead of Hulme. He was coming of age as an F1 driver.\n\nRevson joined Shadow for 1974 and showed flashes of pace in the DN3 before a front-suspension failure in testing pitched him off at Kyalami. Revson, who had started just 30 world championship F1 races, was killed and America lost one of its most promising drivers.\n\nWins: 3\nStarts: 49\nTitles: 1 (1961)\n\nHill was the first American to taste success in the world championship. After a one-off outing for Maserati, Hill joined Ferrari and immediately helped team-mate Mike Hawthorn win the drivers’ title by stepping aside at the Moroccan GP finale.\n\nHaving played second fiddle to Tony Brooks in 1959, Hill became the first American to win a world championship GP at the 1960 Italian race, albeit on a day the leading British teams boycotted due to the use of the notorious Monza banking.\n\nBetter things were to come in 1961. Armed with Ferrari’s 156 ‘Sharknose’ that set the pace at the start of the 1500cc era, Hill battled team-mate von Trips for the crown. Having taken five podiums from six races, including heading a Ferrari 1-2-3-4 at Spa, Hill went to the penultimate round at Monza four points behind two-time winner von Trips.\n\nWhen von Trips was killed in a crash that also took the lives of 15 spectators and Hill won, the 34-year-old became America’s first world champion in tragic circumstances. And with both titles wrapped up, Ferrari missed the season finale at Watkins Glen, so the newly crowned champion didn’t get to compete in front of his home crowd.\n\nAlready a sportscar star, Hill had also won the Le Mans 24 Hours in 1961 and added a third success in the French classic the following year. But in F1 terms, things went downhill quickly.\n\nFerrari was rapidly caught and overcome by Lotus and BRM, though Hill managed three podiums at the start of 1962. He then joined the Ferrari walkout to drive for the disastrous ATS operation and a season with Cooper in 1964 yielded just a single point.\n\nHill’s time in F1 was therefore brief, but he took his one chance to scoop the biggest prize.\n\nWins: 4\nStarts: 86\nBest championship position: 4th (1961, 1965)\n\nSurely good enough to be a world champion, Dan Gurney was never quite in the right place at the right time, but he did win F1 races for three different teams.\n\nAnother to impress in sportscars before breaking into F1, Gurney took two podiums in his first three world championship outings with Ferrari in 1959. His 1960 campaign with BRM was disastrously unreliable, but consistency with Porsche in 1961 helped Gurney net fourth in the points. He also nearly won the French GP, being outpowered by Giancarlo Baghetti’s Ferrari on the run to the line at Reims.\n\nGurney finally got his breakthrough win at the 1962 French GP, which was also Porsche’s first world championship success, and added a third place in the epic German GP at the Nurburgring following a race-long battle with Graham Hill and Surtees.\n\nGurney joined Brabham for 1963 and quickly demonstrated he was quicker than team boss Jack Brabham, before giving the squad its first world championship win in the 1964 French GP. Gurney should have been a title contender in the BT7 but poor luck – such as running out of fuel while dominating at Spa – limited him to two victories and sixth in the standings.\n\nGurney scored five podiums on his way to fourth in 1965 and could have got his hands on the Brabham-Repco that would win two title doubles across 1966-67 had he not left to set up his own operation.\n\nAnglo American Racers certainly made an impact with its distinctive Eagles. Reliability was suspect but Gurney famously won the 1967 Belgian GP at Spa, just a week after taking victory (and spraying champagne) at Le Mans with AJ Foyt and Ford.\n\nThe AAR F1 project came to an end in 1968 and Gurney only made a handful of starts before retiring in 1970, but his impact continued as a team boss and major player in motorsport for decades.\n\nWins: 12\nStarts: 128\nTitles: 1 (1978)\n\nOne of the greatest racing drivers ever, Italian-born Mario Andretti is by far the most successful American in F1 history so far.\n\nThe USAC IndyCar star took pole for his first world championship GP at Watkin Glen in 1968 and secured victory on his Ferrari debut at the 1971 South African GP. But it was when he joined forces with Lotus boss Colin Chapman for a full-scale F1 assault that Andretti really made his mark.\n\nAndretti had been part of the Parnelli outfit, which had abruptly pulled out of F1 early in 1976 due to a lack of funding. At the same time, Lotus was in the doldrums and Chapman’s squad was looking for a boost.\n\nAndretti toiled away with the Lotus 77, winning the 1976 Japanese GP finale, while the team developed ground effect. Andretti and the Lotus 78 was the fastest combination of 1977 but unreliability – usually with the development Cosworth DFV engines – restricted Andretti to ‘only’ four wins and third in the standings.\n\nThere was no stopping Andretti and Lotus in 1978, though. He won the Argentinian GP opener and took second at Long Beach with the 78 before getting his hands on the sublime 79 from round six in Belgium.\n\nAt Zolder, Andretti took pole by 0.79s and led every lap, while team-mate Peterson finished second in the ‘old’ 78.\n\nThereafter, Andretti and Peterson, now also driving the 79, tended to set the pace wherever they went. Andretti won every race he finished, aside from at Monza (when he won on the road but got a penalty for a jump-start) and Montreal (early clash). His sixth spot in the Italian GP was enough to secure the title with two rounds to go, but his joy was lost when Peterson died unexpectedly after being involved in a multi-car start crash.\n\nLotus quickly lost its advantage and Andretti never won another GP, but there was still one more F1 highlight. Called up to drive for Ferrari, which was still reeling from the death of Gilles Villeneuve and serious crash for Didier Pironi, Andretti qualified on pole for the Italian GP.\n\nA sticking throttle limited him to third – his 19th F1 podium – but Andretti had already done easily enough to be regarded as an all-time legend.\n\nTop five American F1 teams ranked: Haas, Penske and more\n\nThe best American drivers on the road to F1, from GP2 to F2\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

    "fullText": "Liam Rosenior has a unique opportunity to put an old grudge to bed as Chelsea gear up for their Champions League Round of 16 clash against Paris Saint-Germain.\n\nIt’s a familiar matchup for Chelsea, who will face Paris Saint-Germain over two legs in the Champions League, just like they did in the FIFA Club World Cup final.\n\nThe fixtures are expected to fall on the 11th and 17th of March, with Stamford Bridge set to host the second leg on the 17th.\n\nChelsea fans will recall fondly their summer FIFA Club World Cup victory over PSG, when Enzo Maresca’s team cruised to a 3-0 win.\n\nBut recent Champions League meetings between these sides haven’t gone in Chelsea’s favour. The last encounter ended in defeat for the Blues at Stamford Bridge, while the two group stage matches before that both finished level.\n\nChelsea fans will remember well the 2014/15 Champions League campaign under Jose Mourinho, which ended in frustration against Paris Saint-Germain. After a 1-1 draw at the Parc des Princes, Chelsea looked to be in control when Zlatan Ibrahimovic was sent off just over half an hour into the second leg.\n\nInstead of pushing forward, though, Mourinho’s side dropped deep and allowed PSG to take control. Despite goals from Gary Cahill and an Eden Hazard penalty, Chelsea were twice pulled back by headers from corners – first by former Blue David Luiz and then a late one from Thiago Silva.\n\nThe tie ended 3-3 on aggregate with PSG progressing on away goals. After the match, Ibrahimovic famously called Chelsea’s players ‘eleven babies,’ while Mourinho admitted his team struggled to handle the mental side of the game.\n\nLiam Rosenior’s next Champions League match against Paris Saint-Germain is more than just another fixture—it’s an opportunity to address the lingering memories of 2015 that still linger for many Chelsea supporters.\n\nRosenior, though, has already shown this season that he can get results against Luis Enrique’s PSG, having steered Strasbourg to a 3-3 draw earlier in the campaign. Instead of mirroring Mourinho’s cautious style from years past, Rosenior brings a more aggressive approach. It’s a shift that could help this young Chelsea side avoid falling into the same psychological traps that cost them in previous meetings.\n\nThe key will be to maintain the high-energy play that helped Chelsea dismantle PSG 3-0 in last summer’s Club World Cup final, rather than slip back into defensive habits.\n\nWhile Rosenior brings fresh ideas, some recent performances have looked worryingly familiar. Games like Burnley and Leeds United saw Chelsea let leads slip away—reminiscent of how Mourinho’s teams sometimes retreated under pressure instead of pushing forward.\n\nHow Richard Hughes is assessing Arne Slot’s situation as Liverpool head coach\n\nWho is Roland Sallai?

    "description": "Spending a year on a solo backpacking trip changed me in ways I didn't expect. It was lonely but satisfying, and I came home with a new perspective.",
    "fullText": "At 25, I was ready for a change.\n\nI'd reevaluated my relationship with alcohol, a shift that meant I was no longer interested in bars and binge drinking. I soon realized I didn't know how to be social without booze, so I withdrew from my friendships.\n\nI began therapy, yoga, and meditation — all of which helped me understand the unresolved trauma that had driven me to drink in the first place.\n\nI felt overwhelmed by the desire to change, yet stuck by daily circumstances. The monotony of everyday life felt too small to hold the person I wanted to grow into.\n\nThen, I asked myself, \"What would I do right now, if I could do anything?\" The answer was simple: Travel the world.\n\nWith a little solitude in new surroundings, I thought, all my problems would be solved. I bought a one-way plane ticket to Paris, secured a part-time freelance writing job, and stuffed a large backpack with clothes.\n\nI didn't know how long I wanted to travel for, but I believed that when it was time to come home, I would feel it.\n\nThree months into my trip, I found myself hiking a long route in the Austrian Alps that led across lush pastures and through misty forests.\n\nTired and sweaty after hours of walking uphill, I finally reached the summit. Green meadows and mist-covered peaks stretched out before me, the landscape dotted with mountain huts. Yet in all that space, there wasn't a person in sight.\n\nThen it hit me: I was really alone, in a way I'd never been before. I couldn't stop the tears from falling.\n\nThat feeling followed me everywhere I went. I'd be at a destination I'd always dreamed of visiting, like the Colosseum, and my amazement would suddenly be replaced by a confusing sense of remorse.\n\nI missed my family and friends, who'd inevitably grown more distant with each time zone I put between us. On social media, I saw their photos of ordinary American life and longed for the birthday parties and game nights I'd been so ready to leave behind.\n\nHad I been too eager to escape my circumstances? Was a simple life full of love better than an adventurous one spent alone?\n\nI tried my best to ignore these questions and focus on the present, but they always seemed to find me.\n\nTo meet other travelers and immerse myself in local cultures, I volunteered through Workaway, a platform that allows travelers to trade a few hours of weekly work for room and board.\n\nMy first gig was at a hostel in a small Croatian village. There, I met Sophie, a fellow solo traveler and adventurous, easygoing Kiwi I could talk to for hours on end, whether we were on shift together or walking around the nearby lake at sunset.\n\nWe both understood the downsides of long-term backpacking: wearing the same outfits on repeat, adjusting to lumpy beds and low-pressure showers, and missing our loved ones who were carrying on without us.\n\nWe talked about the hard times without the need to sugarcoat them — finally, I didn't feel so alone.\n\nMonths later, her trip had ended, and I visited her family's dairy farm in New Zealand for two weeks. We pet her sweet cows, swam in clear blue waters, and camped in rainy forests. We even hiked the Tongariro Alpine Crossing, an epic 12-mile volcano trek.\n\nShe told me childhood stories, showed me her culture, and exposed me to conversations I never would've had if I'd been there alone.\n\nAnother lesson came at a campground outside Venice, Italy. I'd signed up to share a camping trailer with a stranger because it was more affordable.\n\nHowever, I promptly locked myself — and all my belongings — out of the accommodation.\n\nA few minutes later, a smiling man around my age introduced himself as Liam, my roommate for the next two nights. He promptly began laughing at my sad disposition. Fair enough — the situation was silly.\n\nLiam put me at ease instantly, reminding me not to take myself so seriously. There was always a solution to be had, especially with someone else to help.\n\nThat theme stayed with us throughout the night, skipping through Venice on a search for tiramisu so lengthy and gluttonous that we got lost and almost missed the last bus back to our campsite.\n\nAlone, this situation would've made me sick with anxiety. With Liam by my side, I knew we'd figure it out together.\n\nInevitably, I'd find myself alone again, exploring an empty beach on O'ahu or savoring seafood in Dubrovnik, and that hollow sensation of loneliness would return.\n\nThere was a new sweetness accompanying that feeling, too: the reminder that I was never really alone.\n\nI finally understood I'd been wrong to think that solitude would lead to personal growth. The friends I'd met played a more important role in my self-development journey by challenging and expanding what I thought I knew about traveling, companionship, and life itself.\n\nWhen I returned to the United States one year after my trip began, I reunited with my loved ones at home, carrying a fresh point of view. I wanted to be a better listener at group gatherings and more open to opinions that differed from my own.\n\nMy sister and I still disagreed sometimes, but I saw it as an opportunity to truly see each other more; to deepen our connection. If friends discussed their interpersonal challenges, I tried to see both perspectives in the conflict, rather than choosing a side.\n\nMost of all, I valued the presence of my loved ones in my life because I knew what it was like to move through the world without them.\n\nSolo travel was indeed transformative, but it wasn't the places I went that changed me for the better — it was the people I met along the journey.\n\nI could never become who I was meant to be without them.",

    "fullText": "\"It's a question for him, but would we love to have him? Yes.\"\n\nHe may have only had a handful of training sessions with Northern Ireland, but interim boss Kris Lindsay has already left a big impression on his players according to long-serving midfielder Nadene Caldwell.\n\nLindsay will lead NI in their opening two 2027 World Cup qualifiers away to Switzerland on Tuesday, 3 March and at home to Turkey on Saturday, 7 March.\n\nWhat happens beyond that for Lindsay, who also manages the Northern Ireland men's under-16 team, remains to be seen, but early indications from Caldwell suggest the players are fully behind Tanya Oxtoby's short-term replacement.\n\n\"Kris has come in for these two games and has been a breath of fresh air,\" she told BBC Sport NI's Nicola McCarthy.\n\n\"He's had home-based sessions for the players and you can see his enthusiasm already and hopefully that will come across on the pitch. He wants every individual player to be 1% better and that's all we can ask.\n\n\"Kris has been very open, honest and transparent with the players, he's fully in. He's laid out what he wants and the players what they want, so we're on the same page.\n\n\"I'm sure he would like to go on and take the job, it's something he's involved in and he'll like to stay involved in.\"\n\n2027 Fifa Women's World Cup qualifiers\n\nGlentoran's Caldwell appreciates that \"from the outside it seems transitional\" with Northern Ireland still yet to find a permanent successor to Oxtoby, who left to join Newcastle in November.\n\nThe squad is also oscillating between an experienced core and an influx of younger players, but Caldwell insists they are merely focused on the task at hand and not the public perception of the squad.\n\n\"It is going to happen in football [transitions], but we're professional players and we'll take a professional approach on the pitch when we have a job to do,\" she explained.\n\nThe 35-year-old, who has won 91 caps for her country, believes the permanent appointment of Lindsay would only serve to aid NI's ability to navigate a transitional period given his previous role of working with young players.\n\n\"He's a great person, manger and coach and these three things can only bring us success.\n\n\"With the transition of players coming though, he would be an amazing asset.\n\n\"He has a wealth of experience and he knows that it's like to be from Northern Ireland and that would get the green and white army on side to support.\"\n\nRafferty returns for NI's World Cup qualifiers\n\nWhat awaits interim boss Lindsay in NI job?\n\n'Whirlwind' - Lindsay excited to manage NI",

    "fullText": "Carrie Jones says Wales' players are grateful to have Jess Fishlock in the dressing room – if not on the pitch – as they head into a new Women's World Cup qualifying campaign.\n\nWales start their bid to reach the 2027 tournament in Brazil when they face the Czech Republic in Uherske Hradiste on Tuesday.\n\nRhian Wilkinson's team will have to cope without Wales' most-capped footballer and all-time leading goalscorer after Fishlock retired from international football last October.\n\nBut Fishlock is part of Wales' preparations as a technical assistant to head coach Wilkinson – and midfielder Jones believes she has a \"hugely important\" role to play.\n\n\"Jess staying on as a coach gives huge experience for us as a team - the player that she is and the experiences that she holds,\" Jones said.\n\nFishlock to join Wales staff for opening qualifier\n\n'Really ugly' abuse affects players - Wales' Cain\n\nWales to tour country in World Cup qualifying\n\n\"Even as a player, she was always coaching and I was always trying to learn off her and she's even more that way as a coach - always coaching, always trying to give those extra details.\n\n\"I think it says a lot about her that she's wanting to stay involved and I think we're all really grateful as a team that she is involved.\"\n\nFishlock has been working with her now former team-mates this week and will travel for what is a testing opening fixture in Group B1.\n\nThe Czech Republic have never qualified for a women's major tournament, but are ranked 31st in the world by Fifa, one place higher than Wales.\n\nFishlock will leave the Wales squad after Tuesday's game in order to rejoin Seattle Reign's preparations for the new National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) season.\n\nWilkinson's players, meanwhile, will return home for a second qualifier against Montenegro in Llanelli on Saturday, 7 March.\n\nWatch live on BBC Two Wales and iPlayer from 17:15 GMT; radio commentary on BBC Sounds via BBC Radio Wales, BBC Radio Cymru; text commentary and match highlights on BBC Sport website and app.\n\nHaving reached Euro 2025, the first major women's tournament in the nation's history, Wales' next target is to reach a first World Cup.\n\nHowever, the path to qualification is not simple, with no automatic route available to Wales because they are not in League A.\n\nAssuming they do not finish bottom of a group which also features Albania, Wales will face play-offs late in 2026.\n\nShould Wales finish top of the group, their first-round play-off would be against a side who finish second or third in a League B pool.\n\nBut if Wilkinson's team finish second or third, they would face a side who finish in fourth place in League A or a Group B winner.\n\nThe second round of the play-offs is seeded and should Wales get that far, they would be likely to face League A opposition.\n\nEven a win at that stage may not mean Wales' job is done, because the lowest-ranked of the eight European sides who get through the play-offs will go into inter-confederation play-offs in February 2027. Wales could conceivably be that side.\n\nFor the moment, Jones says, Wales' focus is on making a good start in the group – and they begin with confidence having beaten Switzerland in their most recent international to end a 12-game winless run.\n\n\"As a footballer in general to not win for such a long time, I think you take responsibility for that and it can hurt,\" said Jones, who plays her club football for Swedish side IFK Norrkoping.\n\n\"We always had faith and we knew last year was a challenging year with the opposition we faced. But I think the win against Switzerland definitely gave us some confidence going into this campaign.\"",

This win was not perfect but it was undoubtedly their best of the tournament so far.\n\nJacks is in the middle of the best form of his career – a run that gives England serious threat.\n\nHis runs, in addition to his 2-23, were match-winning and won him the player-of-the-match award for the fourth time in this competition.\n\nBut Jacks may not have been able to pull off the heist without 21-year-old Ahmed, whose six from the second ball he faced brought the chase to life in his first World Cup match.\n\nHis second, hit off the vastly experienced Santner, effectively sealed the deal.\n\nAhmed, who also took a wicket with his first ball, was picked for the conditions here. Can England really leave him out next week?\n\nThe big issue that remains is the form of Jos Buttler. He was out for a two-ball duck – his fifth single-figure score in a row.\n\nPhil Salt also nicked off in the first over while Brook made 21, Jacob Bethell 21, Tom Banton 33 and Sam Curran 24 – all contributions but not match-defining scores.\n\nJacks and Ahmed ensured that will not be the focus, however. England may face India in Mumbai next week. What an occasion that would be.\n\nThough Mumbai has offered decent turn, England are unlikely to face such spin-friendly conditions in the remainder of the tournament.\n\nStill, their versatility was impressive. There was no pace bowled after Jofra Archer bowled three overs and Curran one in the powerplay.\n\nArcher, who began by beating the bat four times in a maiden, was unlucky not to take a wicket early, which allowed Tim Seifert and Finn Allen to build a partnership of 64.\n\nRashid had Seifert stumped before Brook twirled through his tweakers - Ahmed having Rachin Ravindra caught mid-wicket in the 12th over.\n\nJacks bowled accurately but also took the crucial wickets of Allen, caught at deep mid-wicket for 29, and the dangerous Phillips for 39.\n\nPhillips was bowled by one that turned sharply to hit the all-rounder's stumps and afterwards Ahmed took the final over for the first time in his international career.\n\nThis campaign stuttered through matches against Nepal, West Indies, Scotland and Italy but now there is a feeling of real belief emanating from this squad.\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "fullText": "Muslims around the world are currently observing the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, including players in the Premier League.\n\nSaturday's game between Leeds United and Manchester City at Elland Road might be paused in the first half to allow players observing Ramadan to break their fast.\n\nWith the match kicking off at 17:30 GMT and the sun setting in West Yorkshire at 17:41, a stoppage in play may see the likes of Omar Marmoush, Rayan Ait-Nouri, Rayan Cherki or Abdukodir Khusanov come to the side of the pitch to take on food and fluids.\n\nSources say a firm decision on a short break is likely to be made on Saturday morning, while it is understood Leeds would happily accommodate any such request from City.\n\nAsked by BBC Sport if the club have to alter their schedules to help its Muslim players, manager Pep Guardiola said: \"They follow this religious tradition. We have good nutritionists and they adapt to what the team needs.\n\n\"We cannot adapt the schedule for the Premier League [kick-off] times and I think they are used to it - they are not young and have been playing [for] many years during this period.\n\n\"For the players I think it is not new. Both Rayans, Omar and Khusa, it is not the first time for [observing] Ramadan and they know perfectly how to handle it.\"\n\nThis season, the quartet have all started together once in each of the cup competitions but are yet to feature from kick-off in the Premier League.\n\nCity have a memorable history with a number of Muslim players.\n\nGerman midfielder Ilkay Gundogan captained the side to the Treble in 2023, while Algeria winger Riyad Mahrez was also part of that squad and won the PFA player of the year award with Leicester City in 2016.\n\nIvorian Yaya Toure scored the winning goal in the 2011 FA Cup final against Stoke City to end the club's 35-year wait for a major trophy - a year later he refused a bottle of champagne for man of the match on live television, stating his Islamic beliefs, with the Premier League subsequently changing the prize to a trophy.\n\nThough City's training kit is sponsored by Japanese beer company Asahi, its Super Dry 0.0% brand is printed on it, meaning Muslim players are advertising a non-alcoholic product.\n\nIt is subjects like these that City players and staff are being educated about by the Muslim Chaplains in Sport (MCS) organisation, which has been working closely with the club since 2016-17 from the under-8s all the way up to the first team.\n\nMCS founder Imam Ismail Bhamji explains to BBC Sport: \"We visit clubs and often lead prayers and we sit down and learn about a particular subject afterwards. I am then available for club staff and players.\n\n\"I walk around club training facilities and buildings, meeting people and help sort out any issues that they may have and discuss in confidentiality.\"\n\nThis month Guardiola spoke at a news conference about the \"hurt\" he feels for victims of global conflict, including the thousands killed in Palestine.\n\nImam Ismail says it is a subject that has struck a chord within some clubs, adding: \"If help is needed, people do reach out to me for guidance on family matters and personal issues.\n\n\"One example is being asked about how to navigate the war in Gaza - in controlling their emotions and not be at risk of losing their jobs by posting something on social media.\"\n\nEarlier this week, Manchester United held an Iftar (breaking of the Ramadan fast) at Old Trafford for supporters, with the Adhan (call to prayer) taking place inside the stadium.\n\nClubs up and down the country, including Manchester City, have held similar initiatives during Ramadan in recent years.\n\nImam Ismail delivers workshops on Islamic awareness and Halal food guidance, while the ongoing month of Ramadan is a particularly busy period.\n\n\"We explain what Ramadan is and why Muslims find it important and why we must observe it,\" he says. \"It is mentioned in the Quran and one of the five pillars of Islam.\n\n\"We explain the importance of fasting for those who qualify and we also explain the impact of fasting on professional athletes and how they could navigate and work around that to ensure they can fulfil their religious obligations and the sporting side too so that they can continue to play.\n\n\"Ultimately, we leave it to clubs to decide what do to - we can't tell them what to do.\"\n\nPlayers that work with MCS are understood to be pleased that they do not have to miss prayers and an Imam can come in to help them perform their duties as Muslims.\n\n\"I bumped into Pep Guardiola last week and he held my hand and wished me Ramadan Kareem,\" said a beaming Imam Ismail. \"That was nice of him.\"\n\nThe end of Ramadan is marked by the day of Eid, which will take place on Friday, 20 or Saturday, 21 March - depending on the sighting of the new moon - when celebrations take place with families and friends and gifts are exchanged.\n\nCity face Arsenal in a tantalising Carabao Cup final on the Sunday - lifting the trophy at Wembley will provide the perfect Eid present for players and supporters alike.",

    "description": "Cadillac and Audi enter F1 with the ultimate goal of becoming world champions. Both know they have some way to go before achieving that aim.",
    "fullText": "There are two new Formula 1 teams in 2026, representing two of the world's biggest car companies. They have the same ambition, but they are two very different projects.\n\nAudi has taken over the Sauber team to form the basis for its works assault on F1, marking parent company the Volkswagen Group's first foray into the highest level of the sport.\n\nUS giant General Motors (GM) is also trying out F1 for the first time. It has joined forces with US sports conglomerate TWG to form a new team named after its luxury Cadillac brand.\n\nBoth were tempted in by the engine rules introduced this year, believing the increased effect of the hybrid part of the engine was an important marketing point for their road-car portfolios.\n\nBoth want to become world champions. Both realise they have some way to go before achieving that aim.\n\nAudi has set themselves a target of being in a position to compete for that in five years' time. Cadillac have been less precise, but team principal Graeme Lowdon has made it clear they have \"limitless ambitions\".\n\nLet's take a look at where the two projects are at.\n\nAudi team principal Jonathan Wheatley, who joined from his former position of sporting director at Red Bull last March, said at the team's launch this year: \"We're not here to mess around. It's an ambitious project. We're humble. We know where we're starting from and we know where we want to go.\n\n\"We want to make Audi the most successful F1 team in history. There are milestones on that journey and we are starting it today.\"\n\nAudi won the Le Mans 24 Hours 13 times in 18 years from 1999 to 2016. And in rallying they were famous for introducing four-wheel drive with the iconic Quattro in the early 1980s.\n\nThey might not have taken part in F1 before, but they did compete in its forerunner, the European grand prix championship, in the 1930s.\n\nIn a battle with arch-rivals Mercedes, Auto Union won the title with the great Bernd Rosemeyer in 1936, won five races against Mercedes' seven in 1937, while the legendary Tazio Nuvolari won races for them in 1938 and 1939 before the Second World War brought racing to a halt.\n\nAudi's entry this year rekindles that old rivalry with Mercedes, and battle lines have already been drawn in a pre-season row over the rules governing the engines' compression ratio. Audi are said to have been prime among those pushing for a rule change because of a fear Mercedes had found a way of exploiting a loophole to their advantage.\n\nRivals on track with Mercedes, though, Audi are unlikely to be for a while.\n\nWhile Mercedes start the season as championship favourites, Audi have a lot of work to do to transform Sauber into a winning proposition.\n\nFollowing the announcement of Audi's entry in August 2022, the first steps of the programme did not augur well. Audi did not invest anywhere near enough money anywhere near soon enough.\n\nSauber made no progress through 2023 and into the following year. With the clock ticking on its entry in 2026, Audi axed chief executive officer Andreas Seidl, who had left his previous role as team principal of McLaren to join them, in mid-2024.\n\nHe was replaced with a dual management team of former Ferrari team principal Mattia Binotto, who was tasked with running the factories - Hinwil in Switzerland for Sauber, and Neuberg in Germany for the engine programme - and Wheatley, in charge at the track.\n\nEven then, the management changes were not finished. Binotto had initially joined as chief operating and technical officer. Less than a year later, he was made head of the Audi F1 project, and chief executive officer Adam Baker left the company.\n\nThe appointment of Binotto and Wheatley had a relatively quick impact, as Sauber finally began to move forward in 2025.\n\nHaving been marooned at the back, Sauber became more respectable performers, and their veteran German driver Nico Hulkenberg even finally scored a podium after 16 years of trying in last year's British Grand Prix.\n\nThis year, the driver line-up of Hulkenberg and Brazilian Gabriel Bortoleto, who is heading into his second season, continues, and the new Audi engine makes its debut.\n\nSo far the team have made a promising start.\n\nThey ran their car early in January, the first team to do so built to this year's new rules, and put a first aerodynamic upgrade on it in the final pre-season test in Bahrain last week.\n\nPace-wise, the belief is that Audi are in the midfield mix with Haas, Alpine and Racing Bulls, and ahead of Williams. A solid effort so far, although Hulkenberg is not getting carried away.\n\n\"It's just speculation right now still,\" the German said last week. \"We really don't know until Melbourne and even a few races in, because I feel at the moment it can be quite track dependent on how your package feels on different circuits.\n\n\"So we'll have to wait and see until everybody really pulls their pants down in qualifying and we'll find out. Early days. I hope we're competitive somewhere in the midfield right now.\n\n\"But, yeah, the team's been working hard over the winter, pushing all the areas, doing the power-unit side for the first time. It's been busy and a challenge, and I think we're OK. But there's still a lot of work and a lot of room for improvement on that side and a lot to come.\"\n\nIf Audi was faced with a huge task in taking over a team that had suffered years of underinvestment and trying to make it competitive, while also setting up an F1 engine division, Cadillac's task was just as hard, but in a different way.\n\nThey had to set up a team from scratch, while battling political headwinds for at least three years.\n\nTheir journey started with the US-based Andretti team, which competes in a number of series, including IndyCar and Formula E, pondering an entry in the early years of this decade. But things got messy.\n\nMichael Andretti, who ran the team, rubbed a lot of people in F1 up the wrong way with what was perceived as his abrasiveness and presumption, and there were questions marks within F1 as to how serious GM's involvement was. Initially, the team had a deal to use Renault engines, and it appeared Cadillac was little more than a sponsorship deal.\n\nAndretti put forward its case for an entry through an official FIA process, but despite being accepted by the governing body in October 2023, they were rejected by F1 in January 2024, on the basis that they did not bring extra value to the sport.\n\nBut Andretti parent group TWG refused to accept defeat. They reconfigured their bid. Michael Andretti was removed from the project, although father Mario, the 1978 F1 world champion, remains as an ambassador, and Cadillac's involvement was made more prominent, including taking on the name of the team.\n\nGM pledged to build its own engine - currently scheduled to appear in 2029 - and as it became clearer that Renault might pull out of F1, as it now has, a Ferrari customer deal was inked.\n\nA US department of justice investigation into F1's rejection of Andretti further greased the wheels, and the entry was finally confirmed in March last year.\n\nWhile all this was going on, Lowdon, formerly a senior figure at the Virgin/Manor/Marussia team that raced from 2009-16, was charged with setting up a new company from scratch. They had to commit to that long before the entry was confirmed, or they would simply have run out of time.\n\nChief technical officer Nick Chester, technical director of Renault F1 from 2013-20 and subsequently the title-winning Mercedes Formula E team, was the second person to sign after Lowdon. He started in March 2023, and set to work on building up a 600-strong team at the same time as beginning to design a car.\n\nNow, Cadillac are occupying six buildings on the business park opposite the main entrance of Silverstone, and have two other bases, the GM technical centre in Warren, Michigan, and the GM Motorsport headquarters in Charlotte, North Carolina, where drivers Valtteri Bottas and Sergio Pérez have been working on the simulator.\n\nA new TWG headquarters in Fishers, Indiana, is due to be finished late this year, and will eventually become the F1 team's manufacturing centre, but the UK base at Silverstone will remain, albeit slimmed down to fewer buildings.\n\n\"You do need really good communications,\" says Lowdon, \"and we've got a massive necessity for peer-to-peer interaction. So we need engineers talking to engineers. We need an engineer here (at Silverstone) talking to an engineer in Charlotte and another one in Warren, Michigan, or eventually in Fishers.\n\n\"So we've looked to have a very, very flat management structure. It's highly modelled on the Apollo project. It's very similar. OK, we're not putting a man on the moon, but it feels like it sometimes.\"\n\nLowdon and Cadillac F1 chief executive officer Dan Towriss, who has the same position at TWG, have been keen to emphasise the size of the task at hand, and their own sense of realism.\n\n\"We started with big dreams,\" Towriss says. \"We ran into a lot of obstacles and it was just a cacophony of voices that were telling us no. Not just no, but never.\n\n\"We've come at this incredibly complex, competitive time and we're jumping in from a standing start.\n\n\"We didn't buy an existing team. We didn't import a bunch of stuff. We started with nothing. So that's a pretty daunting challenge from that standpoint, which is why you heard a lot of people say it's going to be really hard.\n\n\"We know it's going to be really hard, but that's where that grit, that fight, that persistence comes.\"\n\nCadillac have made no bones about the fact that they expect to finish last this year.\n\n\"Can you imagine if you've owned a Formula 1 team for 10 years and then another team rocks up and beats you?\" Lowdon says. \"You would be apoplectic. You would be so annoyed. And so you have to assume that any new team coming in is going to be last, you know, otherwise, you know, what's gone wrong somewhere else?\"\n\nThey do indeed appear to be at the back. But Lowdon's words have been prescient. Aston Martin are in such dire straits that there is a significant question mark about which of the two will be slowest in Melbourne.\n\nThe difference is, if it's Aston Martin, that is a desperate blow. If it's Cadillac, well, it's kind of part of the plan.\n\n\"We're up against teams who have been doing this for a very, very long time,\" Lowdon says. \"We're working through the programme. We've had no major issues, just small issues that I think every team in the paddock will have had before.\n\n\"We've got a lot of experienced people in the team. But the experience of working together as kind of like a Formula 1 team is less than 12 months.\n\n\"But I would say, to sum it up, extremely happy with the team. Very, very happy with the platform that we're building. And we can't wait for Melbourne.\"\n\nThe 'rare combination' behind Britain's youngest F1 driver\n\nWhy has it gone so wrong for Aston Martin?\n\nWill drivers still make a difference in F1 in 2026?\n\nAndrew Benson Q&A: Send us your questions",

    "fullText": "Five U.S. World Cup candidates playing across Europe’s top five leagues will fall well short of winning a domestic championship this season.\n\nBut as those campaigns hit the homestretch, culminating in May before attention turns to this summer’s World Cup, the group remains in the chase for continental trophies.\n\nOnly one current USMNT player has appeared in — let alone won — a Champions League final. Christian Pulisic was a sub in Chelsea’s 2021 triumph over Manchester City. His AC Milan team didn’t qualify for European competition this season.\n\nWith the knockout playoffs complete this week, highlighted by an extraordinary night in northwest Italy involving Weston McKennie and his ousted Juventus side, Friday’s draws will determine the Round-of-16 pairings in the UEFA Champions League, second-tier Europa League and third-level Conference League.\n\nAtalanta midfielder Yunus Musah\n\nBayer Leverkusen midfielder Malik Tillman\n\nAtlético Madrid midfielder Johnny Cardoso\n\nOlympique Lyonnais midfielder Tanner Tessmann\n\nCrystal Palace defender Chris Richards\n\nRegardless of how the Champions League draw plays out, Atalanta and Bayer Leverkusen will face a massive challenge: One will play Barcelona, the other Bayern Munich. Atlético Madrid will await Tottenham Hotspur or Liverpool.\n\nIn addition to the national team regulars, Diego Kochen, a U.S. under-21 national team goalkeeper, is a backup for Barcelona, which will take on Paris Saint-Germain or Newcastle.

    "description": "Quinn Hughes’ stock has done nothing but rise this year. Here’s what makes him so special.",
    "fullText": "Until recently, the general consensus was that Cale Makar is the best defenseman in the world, with Quinn Hughes as the clear No. 2.\n\nNow, the perception seems to be changing.\n\nSince the Vancouver Canucks traded Hughes to the Minnesota Wild in December, dozens of writers, podcasters and broadcasters have noted their shock at how good Hughes actually is — and his Olympic performance with Team USA only increased his stock.\n\nBut he’s the same player he always was. The difference is that more people are paying attention to him, being two time zones closer to the Eastern Conference and all.\n\nUtah Mammoth defenseman Nate Schmidt played a season with Hughes and the Canucks. It was only Hughes’ third year in the NHL, but Schmidt could already see that he was special.\n\n“You could tell it was all in there if he could just gather even more confidence when he has the puck,” Schmidt said. “He’s such a game changer. I think the gap between him and Makar has shrunk, and it’s always been pretty close.”\n\nQUINN HUGHES! USA WINS! 🦅 pic.twitter.com/WxbCRKxPiO\n\n— NBC Olympics & Paralympics (@NBCOlympics) February 18, 2026\n\nPart of what makes Hughes so good is his ability to get through the neutral zone with the puck. Rather than skating forward, he turns his back to oncoming forecheckers.\n\nThat opens up passing options behind him and to both wings, in addition to the ability to pivot around the forechecker and advance the puck.\n\nThe more time you can spend in the offensive zone, the more likely you are to both score and prevent the opponent from scoring — and that’s a major factor in the 57 points Hughes has scored through 52 games this season.\n\n“His skating separates him,” said Mammoth defenseman Sean Durzi, who grew up around the Hughes boys when they lived in Toronto while their father was working for the Maple Leafs.\n\n“His conditioning, how efficient he is. He plays 30 minutes (a game) and it looks like it’s pretty easy for him, so that’s a credit to how well he’s done.”\n\nDurzi noted the game the Mammoth played against Hughes in Vancouver just before the trade, and Hughes had a hand in every one of the Canucks’ scoring chances in the first period.\n\n“He’s got that calmness to him that allows him to step up big in these pressured situations, but, like, he’s got that passion, too. I think the whole family’s got that love for the game and they want to be out there in those moments and I think he’s done a good job of that.”\n\nWith two parents who work in high-level hockey, it perhaps shouldn’t come as a surprise that all three of their boys became NHL stars. Durzi credits his three brothers for his success, and he noted that the same must be true of the Hughes brothers.\n\nThe Mammoth host Hughes and the Wild on Friday. Despite being in the same division as Minnesota, Utah has yet to lose to the Wild in regulation, and they’re a perfect 3-0-0 against Hughes as a Canuck.\n\nUtah head coach André Tourigny gave his thoughts about Hughes after the Mammoth’s practice on Thursday.\n\n“We know how good he is. He’s one of the best players in the world — all positions,\" Tourigny said. “I think there’s a debate to be made on a few, maybe five, six guys in the world, and he’s probably at that level.”\n\nAdded Schmidt with a laugh: “Makes me feel a lot better about myself, because if he can go out there and dominate and game-change in the Olympics, it makes me feel a lot better when he does it against me in the regular season.”",

At. The. Airport. In the middle of the day.\"\n\nThis isn't the first time the airport has waded into the air-travel comfort wars.\n\nLast September, TPA jokingly announced it was renewing a ban on Crocs — the lightweight, clog-style shoes that have long divided the internet — for 10 years.\n\nWhen an X-user asked what would happen if they were caught wearing Crocs in the security line, the airport responded, \"You don't wanna know.\"\n\nSee ya (maybe) in 2035, @Crocs 😘😘😘 pic.twitter.com/met5Flsyva\n\nThe pajama post comes amid Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy's push for travelers to step up their travel attire.\n\nIn November, the Transportation Department launched a campaign titled The Golden Age of Travel Starts with You, encouraging passengers to be more mindful about their behavior — and their wardrobes.\n\n\"Bringing civility back, I think, enhances the travel experience for everybody,\" Mr. Duffy said during a November spot on Fox Business. \"Let's maybe go back to an era where we didn't wear our pajamas to the airport.\"\n\nTampa International Airport, however, made clear in a statement that its latest fashion decree against pajamas is not an actual dress code.\n\n\"Tampa International Airport regularly shares lighthearted, satirical social media content as part of our ongoing effort to engage with our followers,\" the airport told Business Insider. \"Today's post about 'banning' pajamas was another playful nod to day-of-travel fashion debates.\n\n\"We encourage our passengers to travel comfortably and appreciate our loyal followers who enjoy the online humor.\"",

    "fullText": "MEXICO CITY (AP) — The Diving World Cup scheduled in Mexico next week was canceled due to safety concerns on Thursday.\n\nThe meet was to take place from March 5-8 in Zapopan, near Guadalajara in the state of Jalisco, where there has been a surge in violence since Sunday following the capture and death of the leader of the Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generación (CJNG), Nemesio Oseguera.\n\n“A thorough risk assessment of the situation included consideration of travel restrictions and advice given by a number of international governments regarding travel to Mexico at the current time,” World Aquatics said in a statement. “The safety and participation of all athletes remain a fundamental priority for World Aquatics.”\n\nMexican sports officials were yet to comment on the cancellation.\n\nCartel members have burned cars and blocked roads in nearly a dozen Mexican states and authorities report that at least 70 people have died. The CJNG is considered the most powerful and violent cartel in Mexico and it is centered in Jalisco state.\n\nEven though Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has said things are getting back to normal, in Guadalajara there was still fear among its citizens.\n\nFour high-level soccer matches were postponed last Sunday, including one in the central city of Queretaro, where Mexico defeated Iceland 4-0 on Wednesday in a friendly. Top-tier team Atlas held workouts through Zoom.\n\nOn Wednesday, four softballers from the Guadalajara-based Jalisco Charros of the Women's Professional League asked to be released from the team for “personal reasons.” They were American Nicola Simpson, Canadians Natalie Wildman and Janet Lung and Dutch player Eva Voortman.\n\nAP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports",

    "fullText": "The Premier League will launch its first direct-to-customer streaming platform in Singapore next season, and is looking to see how it could be “replicated all around the world” if successful.\n\nThe English football league’s chief executive Richard Masters announced the project on Thursday, making long-standing rumours of a ‘Premflix’-style service a reality, at least in one territory.\n\nMasters said the service would be branded as Premier League Plus and that the league would be closely monitoring its success to determine whether to expand further.\n\nIt is the Premier League’s first move to broadcast its own content, having always previously sold its rights to independent broadcasters such as Sky Sports in England and NBC in the United States.\n\nIt will coincide with the opening of a new Premier League Studios production hub in Olympia in London.\n\nMasters officially announced the news at the Financial Times Business of Football Summit in London on Thursday.\n\n“We’re going (direct) to consumer in Singapore. It’s a very long, considered process, carefully chosen,” he said.\n\n“So from next season, Premier League Plus, rather than Premflix – we’ve rebranded it finally – is going to happen.\n\n“For the first time the Premier League is going to have its own customers. It’s going to have to deal with promotion, pricing, churn, distribution, all of those things, we’re looking to build a business.\n\n“We’re also looking to learn, to see how that might be replicated all around the world.\n\n“What we do with Premier League Plus in Singapore is really about learning as well as building the business. If it goes well, it may be replicated. You don’t want to predict further than that I think at this stage.”\n\nThe Premier League’s move follows other major sports leagues, including the NFL, NBA and Major League Baseball in North America, in going direct to consumer.",

The Dodgers non-tendered him following the first of their last two World Series victories.\n\nHoneywell will look to re-establish his value with the Giants and return to MLB for the first time since pitching in the World Series against the New York Yankees.\n\nHoneywell joined the Dodgers midway through their championship campaign in 2024, as they claimed him off waivers from the Pittsburgh Pirates in July of that year.\n\nHe stayed on the roster for the remainder of the regular season despite battling injury, posting a 2.62 ERA through 18 appearances and 34.1 innings pitched.\n\nHoneywell also made three appearances in the postseason for the Dodgers — the only ones of his career so far — posting a 9.35 ERA through 8.2 innings pitched. He threw a scoreless three innings in his first appearance against the New York Mets, but struggled to keep runs off the board in his following contests.\n\nHe allowed four runs in 4.2 innings in his second appearance against the Mets and five runs in one inning during the World Series against the Yankees.\n\nPrior to his time with the Dodgers and Pirates, Honeywell spent time with the Tampa Bay Ryas, Oakland Athletics, San Diego Padres and Chicago White Sox. Formerly a Top 100 prospect with the Rays, Honeywell struggled to stay healthy during his rise to the majors, missing several seasons due to various injuries in his elbow. Through 63 career MLB appearances, Honeywell has a 4.10 ERA and has struck out 69 batters in 94.1 inning pitched.\n\nHe had a 2.63 ERA in his last MLB season, so if he can remain healthy in the Giants’ organization, he could find a spot for himself in MLB once again.\n\nAre you surprised it took Brent Honeywell Jr. this long to find a new MLB team?",

South Africa have also joined them.\n\nHere's what the remaining teams still in contention need to progress to the next stage.\n\nA total of eight teams progressed to the Super 8 stage, with each being placed in to two groups - Group 1 and Group 2.\n\nGroup 1: West Indies, South Africa, India Zimbabwe\n\nGroup 2: England, New Zealand, Pakistan, Sri Lanka\n\nEach team plays three matches in the Super 8 phase, facing each of the other teams in their respective group once.\n\nAfter those fixtures, the top two teams in each group will advance to the semi-finals, with the winner of each Super 8 group facing the runner-up from the other.\n\nSouth Africa are through after two impressive victories out of two.\n\nIndia and West Indies are effectively playing for a spot in the semi-finals when they meet on 1 March.\n\nZimbabwe were eliminated after losing against India on 26 February.\n\nEngland are through to the semi-finals after wins over Sri Lanka and Pakistan.\n\nNew Zealand will progress if they beat England or if Pakistan fail to beat Sri Lanka.\n\nIf the Black Caps lose to England, Pakistan could qualify by beating Sri Lanka but it would come down to net run-rate (NRR).\n\nSri Lanka are eliminated following their defeat by New Zealand on 25 February.\n\nNet run-rate is the common method for differentiating teams level on points in a limited-overs cricket tournament.\n\nIt is a formula that measures a team's average margin of victory, or defeat - a side with several big wins will have a positive net run-rate, while those who have suffered sizeable losses will have a negative one.\n\nTo understand net run-rate, you have to first get your head around run-rate.\n\nThat's the average number of runs scored per over by a team in the innings of one match - so, for example, a score of 140 off 20 overs for Team A equals seven runs per over.\n\nNet run-rate is then calculated by subtracting the opposition's run-rate from the other team's run-rate.\n\nSo if Team B scored 130 off 20 overs, their run-rate would be 6.5 runs per over.\n\nTherefore Team A would emerge from the encounter with a positive net-run rate of 0.500 (7 - 6.5), while Team B would take away one of -0.500 (6.5 - 7).\n\nOnce a side has played more than one match in a competition, these figures are calculated cumulatively.\n\nLet's say Team A scored 160 runs from 20 overs in their next match, then they would have a tournament total of 300 runs, divided by 40 overs - a run-rate of 7.5.\n\nIf their second opponents scored 180 runs from 20 overs, we first add that to Team B's score, making 310 divided by 40 overs - that makes 7.75.\n\nTake 7.75 from 7.5 and Team A end up with a run-rate of -0.25.\n\nAre we done with the calculations now? Well, not quite...\n\nIf a team loses and is bowled out early, then we wouldn't want to divide their score by the overs they played, as that would potentially deliver them a higher run-rate than their opponent.\n\nTherefore if a team is bowled out inside their allotted overs, their run-rate is calculated by dividing their runs by the maximum overs they could have batted.\n\nWhat is net run-rate in cricket?\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "description": "Cuban says AI tools like ChatGPT let curious kids teach themselves and turn one idea into a potentially life-changing product.",
    "fullText": "Mark Cuban believes artificial intelligence has fundamentally changed who gets to innovate.\n\nThe billionaire entrepreneur and former \"Shark Tank\" investor said we've entered a moment where \"some kid in a basement\" can build something that transforms an industry because AI has put the world's knowledge within reach.\n\n\"All it takes is one good idea,\" Cuban told Eric Bricker, former cofounder and chief medical officer of Compass Professional Health Services, in an interview released on Wednesday.\n\n\"Why not you? Why can't a 12-year-old, 14-year-old, 20-year-old, 25-year-old, whatever it may be, come up with something that changes the world?\" he asked.\n\nCuban pointed to AI tools like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini as a turning point. Just a few years ago, a curious student without access to strong teachers or resources might have struggled to go deep on a topic. Now, he said, they can create their own curriculum.\n\n\"If you're curious about something, you can set up your own curriculum,\" Cuban said, describing how a young person could ask an AI tool to teach them what it takes to become a surgeon or understand robotic surgery.\n\n\"There is nothing you are unable to learn if you put in the time,\" he added.\n\nHe acknowledged that AI systems can hallucinate but said that access to instant explanations, iteration, and feedback dramatically lowers the barrier to entry for ambitious builders.\n\nCuban framed the shift as especially powerful in healthcare, an industry he has tried to disrupt through ventures like Cost Plus Drugs.\n\n\"All it takes is one good idea from some kid everybody thought was crazy,\" he said.\n\nCuban also said AI makes it easier to act on ideas. Someone who wants to develop a concept or even file a patent can ask an AI tool to \"help me write this patent — boom boom boom,\" he said, adding that builders now have instant access to knowledge that once required expensive experts or years in a library.\n\nFor Cuban, the opportunity is less about hype and more about access. The combination of AI tools and global communication platforms means that once someone builds something meaningful, they can scale it quickly.\n\n\"There's nothing that can stop you anymore,\" he said. \"And that is just so powerful.\"",

This interview with Martin Reeves, author and managing director and senior partner at Boston Consulting Group, examines how leaders who embed pragmatic political thinking into their strategy will be better positioned to safeguard long-term value.",

Every corporate decision is now scrutinized under a public lens, as customers, the government, and the general public debate and dissect the political leanings of a leader or firm. The result? Businesses blacklisted and boycotted. Revenue reduced and brand reputation damaged. Employees and CEOs fired. The risks of mixing business with politics seem insurmountable, and yet, remain inevitable.",

Ryan Rickelton chipped in with a quickfire 45 not out off 28 at number three.\n\nMarkram sealed South Africa's fifth win of the tournament in Ahmedabad with his 11th boundary.\n\nThe victory puts the Proteas on the verge of the semi-finals without making them mathematically sure.

West Indies play India in their final match of the group knowing a defeat will likely eliminate them.\n\nSouth Africa, finalists in 2024, should have been chasing a significantly lower total after taking four wickets in the powerplay and later reducing West Indies to 83-7.\n\nHowever, the two-time champions fought back through Romario Shepherd and Jason Holder, who put on 89 (57) for the eighth wicket to drag West Indies beyond 170.\n\nAfter smacking spinner Keshav Maharaj's opening over for 17, West Indies, who piled on 254-6 against Zimbabwe in their Super 8 opener on Monday, lost four wickets in 11 balls to slump from 29-0 to 43-4 inside four overs, with Kagiso Rabada and Lungi Ngidi collecting two wickets apiece.\n\nSherfane Rutherford, who couldn't capitalise on being dropped on three, Rovman Powell, and Matthew Forde joined the procession back to the dressing room before Shepherd and Holder came together in the 11th over.\n\nAfter rebuilding steadily, the pair burst into life from the 15-over mark, Shepherd accelerating from 21 (17) to finish unbeaten on 52 (37) and Holder reaching 49 (31) before being run-out off the penultimate ball of the innings.\n\nThey added 58 runs off the final five overs, including Holder taking the 18th, bowled by Marco Jansen, for 23.\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

That doesn't mean seamers can't still have an impact - like [New Zealand seamer] Matt Henry last night.\"\n\nAhmed, 21, has been a regular around England squads but has not played a T20 since the tour of Ireland last September, nor has he featured at a World Cup.\n\nHe played in the three one-day internationals against Sri Lanka last month, also held on this ground, and twice filled in as an opener.\n\nThe leg-spinner would likely replace a pace bowler if he is selected - possibly Jamie Overton.\n\nNew Zealand picked only two pace bowlers in their win over Sri Lanka, in which 30 of the 40 overs were bowled by spinners.\n\nEngland would still have Jofra Archer and Sam Curran as pace bowlers, plus Adil Rashid, Liam Dawson and Will Jacks.\n\nJacob Bethell is yet to bowl in the tournament because of a cut on his finger. His availability to bowl would also impact England's thinking.\n\nWhat should England do about Jos Buttler?\n\n'The day Brook showed he is an England leader'\n\nStunning Brook century leads England into semis\n\nSouthee backed out-of-form opener Jos Buttler, who is on a run of four single-figure scores in succession.\n\n\"Jos has played enough cricket to know he would have been through various tough times throughout his career and I'm sure he'll bounce back at any stage,\" Southee said.\n\nThe Black Caps could be pipped to a semi-final place by Pakistan if they lose but England confirmed their progression with victory over Pakistan on Tuesday.\n\nThe run to the last four comes after the dismal Ashes defeat, which brought the future of coach Brendon McCullum into question.\n\nSouthee said McCullum, who he played alongside 170 times for New Zealand, has not changed amid the scrutiny.\n\n\"One thing with Brendon is he is the most consistent guy I have ever come across,\" Southee told BBC Sport.\n\n\"Nothing really changes from him. He believes in what he believes in. And we've seen in this tournament, we've won in different ways.\n\n\"Baz is just Baz. He just wants guys to do well, wants the team to do well and that hasn't changed when he was a player and as a coach as well.\"\n\nSouthee also spoke of his disappointment at not to be able to remain as bowling coach during the Ashes.\n\nHe was with the squad in the build-up and the first Test in Perth but then left to fulfil a playing contract in the ILT20.\n\n\"I had a two-year existing deal with the IlT20 which I had to fill, obviously the dates got moved from January to December which clashed with the Ashes,\" Southee said.\n\n\"It was disappointing.

I get a 100% employer-paid pension when I retire.\" —Anonymous, 37, male, Nevada 2. \"I make about $20,000 a year as an Army Reservist and use their insurance and pay about $280 a month.

No formal education. I have 227 clients who each pay me $1,000 per month for a gross annual income of $2,724,000. No fluctuation over the past three years. I can’t scale to more clients without the quality of service suffering. I live in Condado, Puerto Rico, utilizing Act 60, so my effective tax rate is under 5%, and I am exempt from Federal taxes. I am responsible for all my expenses, insurance, and related costs. To maintain my tax status, I conduct all my coaching from PR to clients outside of PR, and don’t get to leave the island often. I have to spend at least 183 days on the island just to qualify as my tax home, but I rarely leave, so all my work qualifies as an export.

    "fullText": "Winemakers are pulling the cork on California.\n\nAnother giant in the world-famous wine growing region is shutting down and slashing staff, making it the fourth since the start of 2026.\n\nJackson Family Wines has stopped production at its Carneros Hill facility in Sonoma’s Carneros region, laying off more than a dozen employees, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notice filed with California authorities on Feb. 12.\n\nCommunications director Sean Carrol told the San Francisco Chronicle that Carneros Hill — previously owned by Buena Vista Winery — “served as overflow production capacity and was not tied to any specific brand.”\n\nHe added that the site had “become underutilized,” allowing the company to consolidate.\n\nJackson Family Wines is known as one of the top US wine producers, the sixth-largest wine company in the country.\n\nIt owns the Kendall-Jackson label and about 40 other brands, producing around 6 million cases a year, according to an industry review. More than 25 of those wineries are in the Golden State.\n\nLast week, major winemaker Gallo announced the closure of a large production facility and the elimination of nearly 100 jobs across the wine growing region of Napa and Sonoma counties.\n\nConsidered the world’s largest winemaker by volume, Gallo filed a “warning” notice with the California Employment Development Department on Feb. 12, confirming it will permanently pull the cork on the Ranch Winery in St. Helena.\n\nGallo is also slashing staff at some of its other labels, including the Louis M. Martini Winery and the Orin Swift Tasting Room in St. Helena, as well as J Vineyards and Frei Ranch in Healdsburg.\n\n“Gallo is aligning parts of our operations with our long‑term business strategy to ensure we remain well‑positioned for future success,” a spokesperson for the company told The Post.\n\n“As part of this process, we made the difficult decision to reduce certain Wine Country operations. These changes are driven by market dynamics, evolving consumer demand, and available capacity across our wineries.”\n\nEarlier this month, Foley Family Wines & Spirits shut down its production facility for the historic Central Coast winery Chalone.\n\nIn January, Constellation Brands notified more than 200 people at the Mission Bell Winery in Madera that they would be out of work. And Jean-Charles Boisset Collection closed two Napa Valley tasting rooms.\n\nAccording to a recent report from Wine Business Monthly, there were 4,727 wineries in California in 2025. As of February 2026, there are 4,646.\n\nThe number of American adults who say they consume alcohol has fallen to 54%, according to an August 2025 Gallup poll.",

    "fullText": "The president and CEO of the World Economic Forum, Børge Brende, has announced he will step down in the wake of an investigation into his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein.\n\n\"I believe now is the right moment for the Forum to continue its important work without distractions,\" said Brende.\n\nHe spent more than eight years leading the organisation behind the annual conference in Davos, Switzerland. Davos is one of the set-piece events of the business calendar, bringing together political and business leaders for discussions on worldwide trends.\n\nFigures like JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon are regular attendees, and at this year's event, speakers included President Donald Trump and Elon Musk.\n\nThe WEF co-chairs, André Hoffman and Larry Fink, said the independent review, which was made public earlier in February, found \"there were no additional concerns beyond what has been previously disclosed.\"\n\nBrende, a former Norwegian foreign minister, told Reuters earlier this month that he had dinner with Epstein three times in 2018 and 2019.\n\nHe added that he was \"completely unaware of Epstein's past and criminal activities.\"\n\nBrende had, as recently as November 2025, denied knowing Epstein.\n\nEpstein was first convicted in 2008 of procuring a minor for prostitution. He died in jail in August 2019 while awaiting trial on charges including sex trafficking.\n\nThe pair arranged a dinner at Epstein's New York home in September 2018, on Brende's 53rd birthday, according to emails released by the Department of Justice.\n\nIn email exchanges leading up to the event, the pair discussed the WEF's power.\n\n\"Davos can really replace the UN,\" Epstein wrote, and suggested making it a \"permanent place for discussion.\"\n\nHoffman and Fink said Alois Zwinggi will serve as the WEF's interim president and CEO.",

    "fullText": "Wales international Hannah Cain says the mental health of female players can be affected by \"really ugly\" social media abuse.\n\nLeicester City forward Cain is with the Wales squad preparing for next Tuesday's opening Women's World Cup qualifying game against the Czech Republic.\n\nEarlier this season, the 27-year-old posted on social media that \"enough is enough\" following abuse from people \"hiding behind a keyboard\".\n\nCain has now explained that \"abusive messages after pretty much every game\" for her club prompted her to speak out.\n\n\"I think over the years as the women's game has grown, it's opened up more of a platform for people to have their opinion and share their voices,\" Cain said.\n\n\"I think unfortunately social media has become a place where people can say whatever they want whether it's good, bad, ugly and sometimes the ugly is really ugly.\"\n\nFormer Everton player Cain has been at Leicester since 2020.\n\nThe Foxes are in the midst of a difficult season, with Rick Passmoor's team currently bottom of the Women's Super League (WSL).\n\nCain posted about the abuse in November, when Leicester suffered heavy defeats against Brighton and Arsenal.\n\nRacism, rape and death threats: One weekend of social media abuse in football\n\n'The abuse never stops' - Lionesses to avoid social media\n\n\"During that time I think that we weren't playing badly at a club and I wasn't playing badly but certain people decided to just send abusive messages after pretty much every game and it got to a point where I thought this is not OK,\" Cain added.\n\n\"It didn't matter what I did on the pitch and it does affect you at some point.\n\n\"You see so much of it you start thinking, are they right? Obviously you know that they're not but I think it was becoming so much that sometimes you have to speak out.\"\n\nCain believes people can forget that footballers \"are actual humans\", with abuse affecting players' lives away from the pitch as well as family members.\n\nTherefore, Cain says, she will use her platform to try to prevent further abuse.\n\n\"I think when you do say something, people start deleting all the negative comments they've made and they think that's OK,\" she added.\n\n\"But if I can have a tiny, tiny effect on people maybe thinking before they write something, then I'll absolutely do that.\"\n\n\"You have to take the good with the bad sometimes and I understand people can get carried away and let their emotions get away from them, but I think [it is good to have] a reminder that it can have a serious effect on people's mental health.\"\n\nCain is back on Wales duty having helped Rhian Wilkinson's team end a 12-game winless streak in their most recent game, the 3-2 friendly triumph over Euro 2025 quarter-finalists Switzerland in December.\n\nCain scored a fine goal in that friendly success and is likely to be a key attacking player for Wilkinson as Wales' women attempt to reach a World Cup for the first time.\n\nThe Czech Republic game marks the start of a new era given that Jess Fishlock, Wales' greatest player, will be in the dugout rather than on the pitch having retired from international football last October.\n\nThough Fishlock is still playing at club level for Seattle Reign, the 39-year-old is with Wales as a technical assistant to Wilkinson.\n\nCain says Fishlock earned \"a little round of applause\" earlier this week after taking charge of a passing session on the training ground.\n\n\"It's just weird seeing her in a different-coloured kit, to be honest,\" Cain added.\n\n\"But playing with Jess, she kind of coaches you on the pitch as well, so it's not too different.\"\n\nPele, borrowed kits and Euro glory: The FAW at 150\n\nWales to tour country in World Cup qualifying\n\nWales, who host Montenegro in Llanelli in their second qualifier on Saturday, 7 March, can expect a stern test against a Czech Republic side who are ranked 31st in the world, one place above Wilkinson's team.\n\nBut Wales start Group B1 with top spot as their target, given that finishing first would give them a more favourable route through the play-offs for the 2027 World Cup.\n\nHaving been part of the Wales squad at Euro 2025, Cain says qualification for next year's tournament in Brazil would be \"absolutely incredible\".\n\n\"Obviously our first major tournament last year was absolutely immense and you never think it's going to get any better,\" she said.\n\n\"Then once that's done you're like OK, what's next? And then you're like, amazing, World Cup in Brazil – absolutely, why not?\"",

    "fullText": "Some say the technology is devaluing their work, while others reckon it is not yet – and might never be – good enough to replace them entirely\n\nWorkers grappling with the rapid growth of artificial intelligence have said they feel “devalued” by the technology and warned of a downward trajectory in the quality of work.\n\nRecent analysis by the International Monetary Fund found AI would affect about 40% of jobs around the world. Its head, Kristalina Georgieva, has said: “This is like a tsunami hitting the labour market.”\n\nWorkers who have trained AI models to replace some or all of their roles tell the Guardian about their experiences.\n\n‘I now earn less while working longer correcting the mistakes of AI editors’\n\nChristie* edits papers for academics for whom English is a second language. She was asked to take part in a project to train new “assistant editors”, unaware that it was an AI programme that would lead to her being paid less.\n\n“There was a huge shortage of qualified editors, so I assumed they were training up more [people] to take some of the load,” says Christie, 55, who lives in the UK. “Then they got me to correct the mistakes of these assistant editors. But the new editors were making strange mistakes, like inserting unnecessary full stops or changing the names of countries to nonsense.”\n\nChristie says she “meticulously and respectfully pointed out these errors”.\n\nHowever, the errors kept happening and “sometimes they got worse”. Then, a few months later, she found out who “the editors” were.\n\n“In a newsletter, the company admitted that these assistant editors were actually an AI,” says Christie. “Going forward, all jobs would be pre-edited by it, and our fee would be reduced, so I now earn less money for correcting the mistakes of an AI, which takes me longer than editing from scratch.\n\n“There is this groupthink in the company that they must implement AI.”\n\nChristie says she feels “devalued, betrayed, and furious at this company”.\n\n“I prioritise work from any other sources, but I am trapped in this toxic cycle, as they have the highest volume of work, and I still need to eat and pay rent. But a lot of people have quit,” she adds.\n\n‘AI struggled with patients’ pronunciation’\n\nMark Taubert, a palliative care consultant and professor, said he was excited to work on a pilot chatbot project to explore how technology could help patients navigate the complexities of metastatic cancer and palliative care.\n\nTaubert, 51, who works at Velindre University NHS trust in Cardiff, was recorded over “several hours” for the chatbot and fed the computer with guidelines that would typically inform how he talks to patients.\n\n“We asked patients to write down all their questions, and added patient information leaflets that we had previously written and agreed on,” he says. “We also considered questions I might get from my palliative care community of outpatients and inpatients, such as, ‘Can I drink alcohol when I am taking morphine?’”\n\nThe chatbot was mostly aimed at home patients who might have a question, for example about their medication, out of hours.\n\nTaubert says the chatbot got about “50% spot on, in a way similar to how I might have responded”, but it struggled with the vagaries of human pronunciation and human error.\n\n“Patients don’t always use perfect English and sometimes use incorrect names for medications, for instance, they may say ‘morphium’, instead of morphine,” he says. “People also structured their questions quite differently. We saw a need for the technology to learn about human misspellings, dialects, jargon, variations and accents.\n\n“Subsequent adaptations made the system safer, but we also had to consider how the machine would respond if a patient typed in a more troubling question, for instance, how to end their own life.”\n\nThe chatbot, called Rita, was used for a time “with a lot of caveats and warnings around it” before funding ended, says Taubert.\n\n“We would say: ‘Give this a try if you want to,’ but we also put in links to the hospital information leaflets on each area,” he adds.\n\nWhile Taubert is open to “embracing new technologies”, he does not feel his role is threatened by AI.\n\n“A lot of what we do relies on nuances of language, body language and facial expression and being in the room,” he says. “In the coming months or years, perhaps my working week can be enhanced by such systems by taking away the very administrative duties and letting me actually speak to the patient more.”\n\n‘The overall effect is a decline in quality’\n\nPhilip*, 45, was required to train AI-based translation engines that his supervisors “want to replace us with because they’ll cost less”, but says that even after four years they are still unreliable.\n\n“At first, the results were inevitably laughable,” he says. “But they have improved as we have corrected the programs. However, even after years of this, besides tending to produce formulaic results, they are still unreliable and inadequately accurate, so we still need to review each AI-generated translation word by word and correct as necessary.”\n\nPhilip, who lives in New Jersey, says in his experience, “it doesn’t save time over directly translating the material myself. I think the overall effect is a decline in quality.“If you need a translation that is just a rough idea of what is being said, then generally AI is OK. But it is not always reliable, and that’s the problem, because part of the time you will still run into things that are just completely wrong.”\n\nHe says the moment when he will no longer be needed in his current role “has been looming over our heads for years now, but we’re not there yet”.\n\n‘Training your robot replacement feels like digging your own digital grave’\n\nJoe*, 50, an award-winning marketing writer and content manager, says the company where he worked began exploring AI as a productivity tool at the start of 2024, but he was assured his job was safe.\n\n“I should have seen the writing on the wall when they had me spend the first six months of 2025 building our extensive ‘AI process workflows’ and ‘best practices documentation’. In my naivety, I thought that I would be administering this system and would be asked to oversee these processes.”\n\nHowever, in August 2025, two weeks after he handed in his best practices documentation, Joe was laid off.\n\n“At my exit interview, I was told it had absolutely nothing to do with my work or performance; they blamed ‘market conditions’, and some of that was no doubt true, but the timing of it was certainly suspicious,” says Joe, who lives in Milwaukee. “Working for this company and being asked to do this – training your robot replacement – feels like digging your own digital grave.”\n\nJoe has been told that much of his former workload has been delegated to junior employees.\n\n“They are following my AI documentation to just enter prompts into AI clients in order to produce the work I used to do,” he says.\n\nJoe is now considering a career pivot into sales, but says it has not been easy.\n\n“I wouldn’t necessarily say that AI 100% forced me out of my career path, but at 50 and with the threat of AI looming constantly, I am thinking to myself, I could line up another writing job, but then am I looking at another layoff at 55?”\n\n‘Work will look completely different in 10 years’ time, perhaps even less’\n\nFilippo, 44, an associate professor in mathematics, has been collaborating with two startups on AI projects.\n\nThey are developing models to reason about mathematics and prove theorems with very little human input, and to verify the input using the proof assistant software Lean.\n\n“It’s been three months, and while the results are still somewhat limited, it is clear that these tools are getting stronger and more efficient by the day,” says Filippo, who lives and works in France. “With most of my colleagues experimenting with this AI technology, we are convinced that a mathematician’s work will look completely different in 10 years’ time, or perhaps even less.\n\n“AI will be able to replace us in mundane tasks that occupy a large amount of our time, like proving small ancillary results needed for our larger goals. Whether mathematicians will still be needed to prove these larger ones is debatable.”\n\nFilippo, who works for a university, says he does not feel his role will become obsolete in the immediate future.\n\n“Given that I work for a public institution, that I spend a significant amount of my time teaching and that these AI tools aren’t yet at a professional research level, I do not feel any pressure or concern for my job,” he says. “But I would have a completely different view if I were 25 and had just completed my PhD.”",

    "fullText": "Chipmaker’s quarterly earnings surpassed Wall Street’s expectations every quarter for multiple years now\n\nNvidia released its quarterly earnings on Wednesday, with the chipmaker revealing higher than expected revenues and extending its yearslong streak of surpassing Wall Street’s sky-high expectations.\n\nThe company receives the vast majority of its revenue from its data center business, which has been buoyed by the tech industry’s immense investment into AI infrastructure. On Wednesday, Nvidia reported 75% year-over-year growth of this vertical to $62.3bn. The world’s most valuable publicly traded company, Nvidia has dominated the chip market as its processing units have become the backbone of the artificial intelligence boom. The company also posted an enormous total profit for the fiscal year: $120bn.\n\n“Our customers are racing to invest in AI compute – the factories powering the AI industrial revolution and their future growth,” CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement accompanying the earnings report.\n\nInvestors have been more skeptical in recent months regarding the massive amount of spending that big tech companies have poured into advancing their AI products, with share prices for most of the so-called Magnificent Seven tech firms starting the year off in decline. Nvidia’s growth, meanwhile, has acted as a reassurance to the market, with a stock rally on Wednesday ahead of the company’s earnings report. Throughout the 2024 and 2025 fiscal years, Nvidia beat Wall Street’s expectations every quarter.\n\nThe chipmaker reported earnings of $1.62 per share, beating the $1.53 per share that Wall Street analysts estimated. Its overall revenue for the quarter was $68.13bn, more than analysts’ prediction of $66.2bn in revenue.\n\nShares in the company rose by around 3% in after-hours trading immediately following the earnings report, although those gains dropped to less than 1% as the day went on.\n\nDespite Nvidia’s huge profits, there has been increased scrutiny of the company’s various multibillion dollar deals with AI firms like OpenAI. The circular nature of these deals, where Nvidia invests in a company only for that company to turn around and purchase chips from Nvidia, has led some analysts to worry that the AI industry is on riskier footing than its backers would admit.\n\nOne of Nvidia’s marquee deals, a proposed $100bn investment into OpenAI, also fell through earlier this month. Instead, Nvidia will reportedly invest $30bn into OpenAI as the ChatGPT creator seeks to go public later this year at a valuation of around $730bn.\n\n“We continue to work with OpenAI towards a partnership agreement, and believe we are close,” Huang said on Wednesday’s earnings call.\n\nHuang has repeatedly downplayed concerns around how AI will disrupt or replace workers across numerous industries. Last month, Huang spoke out against fears of AI replacing software technologies during a global rush to sell off software stocks. At the World Economic Forum in Davos earlier this year, he also framed AI as a job creator that would unlock productivity gains and become a core part of international infrastructure.\n\n“In this new world of AI, compute equals revenues,” Huang said on the call.\n\nAfter years of markets swooning over advances in generative AI, however, some investors have grown more skittish and wary of volatility or potential negative effects that AI may have on the economy. This week, a piece of speculative fiction from a research firm caused a market downturn and panic on Wall Street after it outlined an imagined future where AI had caused surging unemployment.",

    "description": "Olympic freeskier Alex Hall doesn't pay for an international phone plan when he travels abroad, so he doesn't get distracted — he says he likes it that way.",
    "fullText": "This is an as-told-to essay based on a conversation with Alex Hall, an American freestyle skier and two-time Olympic medalist. He spoke with Business Insider as part of his partnership with Rao's Homemade. This story has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI was born in Alaska, but grew up in Zurich. I started skiing when I was 3, and began freeskiiing by 10.\n\nWhen I was 15, I moved to Utah after being accepted to Park City Winter Sports School, and I've been based in Salt Lake City ever since.\n\nThese days, I'm rarely in one place for long, since I spend most of the year traveling around the world for training camps and competitions.\n\nHere's what a typical training day looks like.\n\nI'm definitely an alarm guy, but I don't hit snooze. I stop my alarm and get my day going.\n\nIt's funny, even on days when I can sleep in, I still have to set an alarm. I'm not someone who can sleep that much anyway, but I don't like the idea of sleeping through the day. If I don't set one, I feel weird going to bed.\n\nI try not to stay on my phone for too long in bed and waste time. I'm pretty good about not spending a crazy amount of time on social media, so I'll quickly reply to some texts right when I get up, and maybe watch one or two videos. After that, I get my day going.\n\nThere are eight guys on my freeski team, and two of us make food for everyone each morning. If it's your turn to make breakfast, you're up about half an hour earlier than the rest of the group.\n\nThe pairing is mostly random, but there's a little strategy involved. We try to match someone who's good at cooking with someone who's not. We avoid putting two bad cooks together because then we know the meal won't be great.\n\nUsually, we'll make a big scramble with veggies, eggs, and bacon. I typically have a bowl of cereal on top of that, and then some orange juice.\n\nI'm not a huge breakfast person, so I kind of have to force it down. I'm pretty tired in the morning.\n\nAfter warming up, we'll ski pretty much all day from about 10 a.m. until 3 or 4 p.m.\n\nI'm the guy who doesn't pay to get service when I'm traveling outside the US. I don't have an international plan, so my phone only works when I have WiFi. That means once I leave the house in the morning, I'm basically offline for the rest of the day until the evening.\n\nIt can be a little annoying for someone back home who's trying to reach me, but for the most part, it's pretty nice.\n\nSome people ski with their phones in their pockets to listen to music or check messages between their runs. I just leave mine in my backpack so I don't get distracted.\n\nIf I'm training really hard and then sit down for half an hour to eat a full meal, I find it hard to get motivated again in the afternoon. I'd rather keep the momentum going.\n\nUsually, I'll just take a five-minute break, drink a bunch of water, and have two granola bars. Sometimes I'll pack a sandwich and eat it fast, then get right back out there. I'd rather finish a little earlier than take a long lunch and struggle to warm up again after having a big meal.\n\nWhen we're done skiing, we head back down for a video review. We watch clips of our tricks and take notes on where we can improve.\n\nAfter that, we do a short recovery session with stretching, some time on the spin bike, and a bit of core work. It's usually no more than an hour.\n\nDepending on where we are, we'll play a game, kick a soccer ball, or throw a football around in the evening.\n\nAfter that, it's dinner time. Just like breakfast, two people are in charge of cooking, and we rotate through. I try not to eat too much of it, but I do love dessert, especially chocolate or ice cream.\n\nWe'll take some time in the evening to relax, like watch TV or just hang out before bed.\n\nI also use this time to complete my coursework. I major in environmental and sustainability studies at the University of Utah, and my classes are online since I travel so much.\n\nI only take one or two classes at a time, so it's not every evening — usually it's every other evening. I'll do a half hour or an hour, depending on what I have to get done.\n\nThere've been times when I've stayed up an extra hour or two the night before a competition to finish an assignment. But that's on me for procrastinating.\n\nI like sleeping with the window open because I hate being too warm.\n\nI get about seven to eight hours of sleep every night, and a bad night's sleep can really affect my day.\n\nI don't drink coffee or caffeine, so if I don't sleep much, I definitely feel it in the morning, though I usually shake it off after a couple of hours. If it's been a long week of training, bad sleep can sometimes make me feel less motivated.\n\nI usually fall asleep easily. It's more like I wake up in the middle of the night sometimes. Lately, I've been traveling with my own pillow more often, based on a suggestion from some of my teammates.\n\nIf there's space in my suitcase, I'll smash a pillow in there — and it usually helps.\n\nI'm pretty lucky that I love what I do. If I'm having doubts or a down day, I think about the fact that I get to do this surrounded by great people, and that so many others would be happy to be in my position. Staying thankful, even on bad days, usually helps.",

    "title": "RAG on a Budget: How I Replaced a $360/Month OpenSearch Cluster for $1.12/Month",
    "description": "A technical deep-dive into migrating from OpenAI + OpenSearch to a cost-optimized RAG pipeline on AWS. Covers Amazon Bedrock, S3-based vector storage, in-memory cosine similarity search, DynamoDB rate limiting, tiered model routing, and the real-world tradeoffs that shaped every decision.",
    "fullText": "There's a version of this post where I start with the cost savings and you click away satisfied. But the more interesting story is the series of architectural decisions — some deliberate, some forced — that got me from \"let's build this properly\" to a production RAG system running for about $1 a month.\n\nIn January 2026 I did a full rebuild of my professional presence — new Next.js 16 + React 19 portfolio, redesigned from scratch, plus a separate site for my artwork (previously both lived in one codebase). Once those were live, the missing piece was obvious: the AI agent I'd shelved in March 2025 needed to come back, this time production-ready and cost-viable. The rebuilt sites gave it a home worth shipping into.\n\nWhen I decided to add an AI knowledge agent to my personal site, I didn't want a toy. I wanted to understand how production RAG systems actually work — the kind you'd build at a company with real scale requirements. That meant:\n\nA proper vector database (OpenSearch)\n\nExternal embedding and generation via OpenAI\n\nClean separation between ingestion, retrieval, and generation\n\nThe architecture was sound. The problem was the bill.\n\nOpenSearch's minimum viable cluster runs $360–720/month. For a personal project with a few hundred queries a day, that's unjustifiable. After less than a week of watching that cost accumulate, the question shifted from how do I build this to how do I keep this running without OpenSearch?\n\nBefore getting into the migration, here's what I built and why it's worth the effort.\n\nThe agent lives on my website and answers questions about my work, experience, and technical background — things a resume can't do. Instead of serving static pages, visitors can ask things like \"What's your experience with system design at scale?\" or \"Have you worked with event-driven architectures?\" and get grounded, specific answers drawn from my actual content.\n\nThe key word is grounded. This isn't a general LLM answering from training data. Every response is anchored to a curated knowledge base I built and maintain myself — covering 25+ years of engineering experience, employment history, certifications, FAQs, and consulting background.\n\nThe API response contract is intentionally simple and observable:\n\ninterface ChatResponse {\n success: boolean\n message: string\n error?: string\n rateLimited?: boolean\n tokensUsed?: number\n modelUsed?: string\n}\n\nmodelUsed is there for a reason — knowing which tier handled a query matters for debugging and understanding cost tradeoffs in production.\n\nThe core flow hasn't changed between architecture versions:\n\nUser query\n → Embed the query (vector representation)\n → Cosine similarity search against pre-computed knowledge embeddings\n → Inject top-k results as context\n → Generate response from LLM with that context\n → Return answer + source metadata\n\nWhat changed is every infrastructure component underneath it.\n\nThe first version was architecturally clean but expensive.\n\nEmbeddings: OpenAI text-embedding-ada-002\n Vector storage: AWS OpenSearch 2.17\n Generation: OpenAI GPT-4\n Auth: Secrets Manager for API keys\n Orchestration: AWS Lambda via AppSync\n\nFor embeddings I used OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002 — the standard choice at the time, producing 1536-dimension vectors. It worked well. The issue wasn't quality; it was that every embedding generation call left AWS, added latency, and accumulated cost alongside the OpenSearch bill. When you're already paying $360/month for the vector database, adding per-token embedding costs and an external network dependency starts to feel like the wrong architecture for the wrong scale.\n\nI built the OpenSearch cluster lean and deliberately minimal — a single t3.small.search node, 1-AZ without standby, 10 GiB EBS gp2 storage, VPC-only access, fine-grained access control, node-to-node encryption, and hourly snapshots. No dedicated master nodes, no UltraWarm, no redundancy I didn't need. This was the smallest viable production configuration.\n\nIt still wasn't cheap enough. OpenSearch 2.17 on even a single t3.small.search runs around $360/month just to exist. The cluster was healthy — green status, no issues — but after less than a week of running it I shut it down. The architecture was right. The cost profile wasn't.\n\nThat was March 2025. The project sat on the back burner until January 2026, when I came back to it with a different question: what if I didn't need a vector database at all?\n\nThe migration had one hard constraint: I couldn't just swap the LLM provider. I had to eliminate the vector database entirely or find something that costs effectively nothing at my scale.\n\nThe insight was simple: I have fewer than 200 document chunks. That fits comfortably in Lambda's memory. If I precompute all the embeddings, serialize them to S3, and load them at Lambda startup — I don't need a vector database at all.\n\nEverything runs in us-east-1. That's a deliberate choice — the widest model selection and best Amazon Bedrock pricing are there, and keeping Lambda, S3, DynamoDB, and API Gateway in the same region avoids cross-region latency and data transfer costs.\n\nEvery document chunk gets embedded using Amazon Bedrock's Titan Text Embeddings V2. The results are serialized to a single JSON file and written to S3.\n\nThe actual bucket is stephanie-knowledgebase-embeddings, created February 1, 2026. It holds three objects: embeddings.json (2.3 MB, prod), embeddings-dev.json (2.3 MB, dev), and a lambda/ folder. Both embedding files were last regenerated February 19, 2026 after a knowledge base update. Total storage cost: ~$0.01/month.\n\nOn Lambda cold start, the handler fetches the embeddings file from S3 and loads it into memory. It also writes it to /tmp so subsequent warm invocations skip the S3 fetch entirely.\n\nEmbed the query text with Titan V2\n\nCompute cosine similarity against every stored embedding in memory\n\nReturn the top-k results as context\n\nThe implementation lives in embeddingStore.ts. For each stored document embedding b and query embedding a, it computes:\n\ndot product: Σ(a_i * b_i)\nmagnitude of each: sqrt(Σ(a_i²)), sqrt(Σ(b_i²))\ncosine similarity: dot / (|a| * |b|)\n\nsimilaritySearch() runs this against every document, sorts descending, and returns the top-k chunks — which become the context injected into the LLM prompt. Higher cosine score = more semantically similar chunk = more relevant RAG context.\n\nThere's no index. No vector database. Just a dot product loop over a few hundred float arrays. At this scale, it's faster than a network call to an external database would be.\n\nCold start: 3–5 seconds (S3 fetch + embedding load)\nWarm invocations: < 500ms total\n\nThis is the core architectural bet: the scale doesn't justify the infrastructure. At 200 chunks, in-memory search is not a compromise — it's the right tool.\n\nThe design called for three Amazon Bedrock models at three cost tiers:\n\nIn practice, Anthropic models on Amazon Bedrock have been consistently unreliable for me. AWS Marketplace agreements for Anthropic models keep expiring immediately after acceptance — I'd get the \"offer accepted\" email followed minutes later by \"agreement expired.\" I've filled out the required use-case forms, but something in the approval flow keeps breaking. I can call the Anthropic API directly with my own keys without any issues, but I specifically wanted to keep the model abstracted behind Amazon Bedrock so the provider wasn't baked into the application layer.\n\nThe result: in production, the system always routes to Llama 3.3 70B, which turns out to work just fine. The tiered routing logic is fully in place — ready to use Claude the moment Amazon Bedrock access resolves — but for now Llama handles all queries, and the quality is solid.\n\nThis is the part of production systems that doesn't show up in architecture diagrams: sometimes a dependency you designed around simply doesn't work, and you ship with what does.\n\nThe rate limiter tracks usage at three granularities:\n\n: 5 queries max (prevents abuse)\n\nThe bedrock-rate-limits table uses userId (String) as the partition key and timestamp (Number) as the sort key, on-demand capacity mode. As of today it holds 49 items at 6.1 KB total — real usage, not a test table. Records expire automatically with a 90-day TTL. Cost: $0 (DynamoDB free tier).\n\nTwo Lambda functions — KnowledgeableAgent (prod) and KnowledgeableAgentDev — both Node.js 20.x, deployed as Zip packages, triggered by their respective API Gateway REST APIs. The prod API was created February 2, 2026; dev came online February 20 after I formalized the environment separation. Both are regional, TLS 1.0, API key authenticated, and status Available.\n\nNext.js 16 frontend\n → POST /chat (API Gateway)\n → x-api-key header validation\n → Lambda handler (Node.js 20.x)\n → Rate limit check (DynamoDB bedrock-rate-limits)\n → Query embedding (Amazon Bedrock Titan V2)\n → Similarity search (in-memory, embeddings.json from S3)\n → Context injection\n → LLM generation (Llama 3.3 70B via Amazon Bedrock)\n → ChatResponse with answer + sources + modelUsed + tokensUsed\n\nA note on the API key auth: yes, an API key is a lightweight security mechanism — not OAuth, not JWT, not Cognito. That's a deliberate tradeoff, not an oversight. Two things make it appropriate here. First, ALLOWED_ORIGINS is configured to restrict requests to my own domains, so even if someone had the key, cross-origin calls from arbitrary clients get rejected. Second, the calls are made server-side from the Next.js backend — the key is never exposed to the browser. Combined with rate limiting already enforced at the DynamoDB layer, this is a reasonable security posture for a personal site. If this were handling sensitive user data or financial transactions, the answer would be different.\n\nThe starting point was everything I already had: website pages, blog posts, resume, Contra and Upwork profiles. The raw material existed — it just lived in too many places with too much overlap. The about page, homepage summary, and resume introduction all said essentially the same things in slightly different words. The case studies section of the site duplicated content that already lived in blog posts.\n\nAI-assisted summarization — I worked with various AI editors to distill each source into well-structured chunks. This got the content into roughly the right shape quickly.\n\nManual proofread for accuracy — Every chunk was read and verified against the source. AI summaries compress things; sometimes they compress the wrong things.\n\nDeduplication with Claude Code — Ran Claude Code across the knowledge base to identify redundancies. Overlapping content from the about page, homepage, and resume was consolidated into about-page.json as the single source of truth. The case studies section was excluded entirely — that content is already in the blog posts, and indexing it twice would pollute retrieval with duplicates.\n\nStructural decisions — Each JSON file maps to a domain: employment history, certifications, FAQs, consulting services, about. Each content_chunk has its own id, title, and chunk text, with an empty embedding array that gets populated at generation time.\n\nHere's what a real chunk from certifications.json looks like:\n\n{\n \"id\": \"cert-001\",\n \"title\": \"Education: UC Berkeley\",\n \"chunk\": \"Education: Bachelor of Science in Physics & Astronomy, UC Berkeley, December 1999.\",\n \"embedding\": []\n}\n\nAnd from techstyle.json — a chunk that captures a specific, measurable outcome:\n\n{\n \"id\": \"techstyle-001-2\",\n \"title\": \"Variant Price Testing Project\",\n \"chunk\": \"Designed and implemented an A/B testing strategy for dynamic price testing, leading to a $250,000 increase in revenue within the first three days. Architected and developed two high-performance TypeScript API microservices deployed in Mesosphere DC/OS.\",\n \"embedding\": []\n}\n\nThe chunk granularity matters. Too broad and cosine similarity can't differentiate relevance. Too narrow and you lose context. The employment history files use a challenge/solution/result pattern for each project — that structure makes retrieval more precise for questions about specific work.\n\nThe tradeoff is real: manual curation doesn't scale. When the Contentful ingestion pipeline is validated and the chunking strategy is proven, I'll switch to automated ingestion. Until then, I know exactly what the agent knows and how it says it.\n\nSeparate environments from day one.\n\nDEPLOY_ENV=dev ./deploy-lambda.sh\n\nDev uses embeddings-dev.json and a separate API key via KnowledgeableAgentAPIDev. I can push knowledge base changes, test retrieval quality in the actual chat UI, and validate rate-limit behavior without touching the production assistant. Only after validating in dev does anything get promoted to prod.\n\nFor a solo project, this discipline pays off quickly — a bad embeddings file or a broken prompt template is annoying in dev and embarrassing in prod.\n\nThe 99.7% reduction isn't primarily about being clever with LLM costs. It's about eliminating the always-on vector database that was charging rent regardless of traffic.\n\nDoesn't scale past ~10K chunks. In-memory cosine similarity works at this scale. Above 10K chunks, you need a proper index — Pinecone's free tier or OpenSearch Serverless are the right next step.\n\nCold starts are real. The first query after a period of inactivity takes 3–5 seconds while Lambda fetches embeddings from S3. Acceptable for a personal site; not acceptable for a latency-sensitive product.\n\nNo real-time knowledge updates. Adding content requires regenerating embeddings and redeploying. For a knowledge base that changes infrequently, this is fine.\n\nExternal provider dependencies bite. The Anthropic/Amazon Bedrock access issue is a live example. Even with fallback logic designed in, a dependency that's supposed to work might not.\n\nThe first real test was a Postman request — \"Tell me about your experience with team management\" — hammered repeatedly until the retrieval and response quality felt right. That particular query is a good stress test because team management context is distributed across multiple files: employment history chunks, the about page leadership section, FAQ entries. Getting a coherent, grounded answer required the similarity search to pull the right combination of chunks and the LLM to synthesize them cleanly. When it started coming back with specific, accurate answers instead of generic ones, that was the signal.\n\nMore interesting than the questions it answers well are the edges. I deliberately tested queries the agent shouldn't be able to answer — things outside the knowledge base entirely — and it correctly declined rather than hallucinating. But the most revealing test was asking \"Are you kind?\"\n\nThere's no chunk in the knowledge base that answers that directly. Instead, the agent pulled from the core values section of the about page and cross-referenced tone from blog writing to construct a thoughtful response. It wasn't a stored answer — it was synthesis. Seeing it work on a soft, subjective question was more convincing than any technical benchmark.\n\nThe immediate roadmap is intentionally minimal. The Contentful ingestion pipeline exists but isn't production-ready — it will get validated when there's enough new content to justify switching from manual curation. Resolving the Anthropic/Amazon Bedrock access issue remains open. And this blog post itself is the next piece of content going into the knowledge base once it's published — which feels like an appropriate closing of the loop.\n\nBeyond the cost numbers, this project is an exercise in matching infrastructure to actual scale requirements — a thing that's easy to get wrong when you're learning a new domain and want to do it \"properly.\"\n\nOpenSearch is the right tool for a team running millions of vector queries against a corpus of millions of documents. It's the wrong tool for a personal site with 200 chunks and a few dozen queries per day. Recognizing that distinction, and being willing to trade architectural prestige for operational reality, is its own kind of engineering judgment.\n\nThe tiered model routing, DynamoDB-based rate governance, API key authentication, dev/prod separation, and deliberate knowledge base curation aren't over-engineered additions — they're the parts that make this viable as a real, running system rather than a demo that works once and gets shut down.\n\nFrontend: Next.js 16 + React 19 + TypeScript\n\nAPI: AWS API Gateway (REST, regional, API Key auth, TLS 1.0)\n\nCompute: AWS Lambda (Node.js 20.x, Zip deployment)\n\nEmbeddings: Amazon Bedrock Titan Text Embeddings V2\n\nVector storage: S3 stephanie-knowledgebase-embeddings (2.3 MB JSON) + in-memory cosine similarity\n\nGeneration: Llama 3.3 70B via Amazon Bedrock (Claude 3.5 Sonnet/Haiku in routing logic, pending Amazon Bedrock access resolution)\n\nRate limiting: DynamoDB bedrock-rate-limits (on-demand, userId + timestamp keys, 90-day TTL)\n\nInfrastructure: IAM, CloudWatch, TypeScript build pipeline\n\nKnowledge base: Handcrafted JSON with AI-assisted summarization, manually proofread and deduplicated via Claude Code\n\nThe full migration guide and deployment scripts are in the repo if you want to adapt this for your own use case.",

    "fullText": "The Tartan Army have been given the green light to wear sporrans with their kilts at World Cup matches this summer, the Scottish Football Association has confirmed.\n\nThousands of supporters are expected to travel to the US to cheer on Steve Clarke's side after the men's national team qualified for the first time since 1998.\n\nThe World Cup stadium code of conduct states ticket holders are only permitted to bring certain types of bags into stadiums.\n\nSporrans initially failed to meet the strict security criteria but, following talks between world football's governing body Fifa and the SFA, it has now been agreed fans will be able to wear them.\n\nScotland are set to face Haiti and Morocco in Boston and Brazil in Miami after qualifying for the finals with a thrilling 4-2 Hampden victory over Denmark in November.\n\nThe 2026 edition will feature 48 teams and be played from 11 June to 19 July in 16 cities across the US, Canada and Mexico.\n\nUnder current rules at the stadiums in Boston and Miami, the only large bags allowed into the grounds must be made from clear plastic and not exceed 12in x 12in x 6in (30cm x 30cm x 15cm).\n\nAny small bags that are not see-through must measure no more than 4.5in x 6.5in (11cm x 16.5cm) – almost half the size of many sporrans.\n\nWithout the agreement Scotland fans would have had to leave their sporrans in lockers outside or discard them altogether.\n\n\"The Tartan Army are well-known and the sporran is part of our uniform,\" Tartan Army veteran Hamish Husband told BBC Radio Scotland's Lunchtime Live.\n\n\"Our sporrans will contain our match tickets and hope - that's all we want to smuggle into the stadiums.\n\n\"When we arrive anywhere in the world, the kilt and the sporran are a sign of friendship.\"\n\nHe said he never had any doubts that Scotland fans would be allowed to wear their sporrans in the stadiums for the matches.\n\nA SFA spokesperson said: \"FIFA have confirmed that sporrans will be permitted into the stadiums following the standard search and inspection procedures and will continue to work together with the Scottish FA to educate their matchday staff as they prepare to welcome fans to Boston and Miami.\n\n\"The ticketing and membership team at the Scottish FA are in continued dialogue with the tournament hosts to ensure that the Scotland fans will be welcomed to venues in the way they have been across the world.\"\n\nThe agreement comes after it was revealed that the Scotland squad will be kitted out in tailored suits for their World Cup return.\n\nIn 1998 the team, managed by the late Craig Brown, wore kilts ahead of the opening match of tournament against Brazil in Paris.\n\nBut last month the SFA confirmed a Glasgow-based tailor will make \"sharp, made-to-measure suits\" for the players and backroom staff.",

    "description": "In the age of AI, Big Four firms need the skills that junior consultants have, Errol Gardner, EY's global consulting lead, told Business Insider.",
    "fullText": "AI anxiety is hitting entry-level workers hardest. For those aiming for a consulting career, where junior staff historically built slide decks and crunched data, AI agents seem like an intimidating new competitor.\n\nBut two of EY's top consulting leaders say junior employees are a valuable asset for professional services firms in the AI age.\n\nLack of experience is what makes the youngest professionals at EY valuable, Dan Diasio, EY's global consulting AI leader, told Business Insider.\n\nThey arrive without a decade or more of assumptions about how work should be done — more of a blank sheet of paper. That allows them to challenge the status quo and rethink processes from first principles.\n\nHis advice for junior consultants at EY is to use that to their advantage: be bold, ask questions about the way things are done, and lean into the use of technology.\n\n\"If anything, as a young graduate, they've got more opportunity to change our organization,\" Errol Gardner, global head of consulting at the Big Four firm EY, told Business Insider. Junior consultants have the native digital skills and the creativity necessary for the AI era, he said.\n\nAcross the industry, consulting firms are racing to embed generative AI into their own workflows while advising clients on how to implement the technology. That shift is prompting a reassessment of hiring, with a new focus on engineering talent.\n\nIt's also raised questions about the traditional consulting pyramid model, which has long relied on teams of junior staff to perform research and prepare materials. If AI agents can complete much of that \"assembly\" work in seconds, what happens to entry-level roles?\n\nFellow Big Four firm PwC has reduced graduate hiring goals in the US, in part because of \"the impact of AI,\" according to an internal presentation obtained by Business Insider last August.\n\nAt EY, Gardner said there has been \"no material change\" in graduate recruitment due to AI. The firm continues to hire to support growth in its consulting business, he said.\n\nIn its latest annual report, EY said it invests more than $1 billion annually in developing AI-first platforms and products, and AI-related revenue was up 30% in the firm's 2025 financial year.\n\nDiasio, who is responsible for AI across EY's consulting business, added that knowledge-workers broadly, not just the young ones, are getting a bad rap amid the current AI narrative.\n\nThere is an idea that they're going to be replaced by AI, said Diasio, but AI without context, knowledge, and expertise, puts you down a path of \"statistical sameness\" and produces, as he put it, \"polished slop.\"\n\nHe said we're in the early stages of an evolution of consultants' roles: \"Our people are going to move more to being creators, creators of new business models, creators of new opportunities for our clients, creators of maybe new products.\"\n\n\"It's people and their creativity that lift the ceiling,\" he added.\n\nWhile the tools consultants use are evolving rapidly, Gardner said the core objective of their job remains the same: delivering value to clients, developing clients' teams, working collaboratively to implement change, and pursuing learning and development.\n\nThat won't shift by 2030 — or even 2040, he argued. \"As long as human beings are buying from human beings, there will continue to be difficulty in executing change and implementing technology,\" he said.\n\nWhat will change is how the work gets done. Consultants will spend less time on what Gardner described as \"assembly\" work — pulling together presentations, drafting proposals, or synthesizing information — and more time interpreting insights and shaping outcomes.\n\nHave a tip?

He thinks on a planetary scale – as suggested by the title of his celebrated Whole Earth Catalog – and on the longest of timeframes, as with his Long Now Foundation, which looks forward to the next 10,000 years of human civilisation. He has had a lifelong fascination with the future, and anything that could get us there faster, from space travel to psychedelic drugs to computing. In fact, he was arguably the bridge between the San Francisco counterculture of the 60s and present-day Silicon Valley: in his commencement speech at Stanford University in 2005, Steve Jobs eulogised the Whole Earth Catalog and Brand’s philosophy, and echoed its farewell mantra: “Stay hungry. Stay foolish.”\n\nYou could say that Brand has also lived big and long. He is now 87 years old, in the final chapters of an eventful and adventurous life that has crossed paths with some of the most consequential events and figures of his era. He has been a writer, an editor, a publisher, a soldier, a photojournalist, an LSD evangelist, an events organiser, a future-planning consultant, even a government adviser (to the California governor Jerry Brown in the late 70s). “There was a time when people asked me, ‘What do you do?’ I said, ‘I find things and I found things,’” says Brand, as in he is a founder. He is speaking from a library where he likes to work in Petaluma, California, not far from his houseboat in Sausalito. “I’m always searching for good stuff to recommend, and good people.”\n\nIn light of his epic life, Brand’s latest project hinges on what sounds like the most mundane topic imaginable: maintenance. It is “not automatically an exciting concept,” Brand readily admits, but once he started thinking about it, he realised you could view just about everything in terms of it, and a lot could be revealed by doing so: “Maintenance is what keeps everything going. It’s what keeps life going.”\n\nHis new book is titled Maintenance: Of Everything, Part One. It is the first of a planned 13 instalments, Brand explains, and it deals with the most literal, material forms of maintenance. Subsequent instalments will investigate everything from buildings to communities, institutions to the human body, plus planetary and environmental maintenance. So perhaps not such a departure after all in terms of long, big thinking. “I fell into it realising it was a tremendously ambitious thing, because I was going to be writing about a range of things I know nothing about,” he jokes.\n\nIn this first instalment, Brand’s magpie curiosity roves freely across industrial history, from round-the-world yacht racing to vehicle manufacturing to encyclopedias to the refurbishment of the Statue of Liberty. The military comes up a lot, “because the military is so maintenance-dependent and maintenance-aware”, he says, pointing out that he served in the US army himself for two years in the early 60s.\n\nWars have been won and lost on the strength of maintenance, Brand notes. In the Vietnam war, for example, the US army’s M16 rifle was lighter, more accurate and more precisely machined; the Viet-Cong’s AK-47s were more crudely made but therefore easier to fix and less likely to go wrong. Many American GIs lost their lives as a result of jammed M16s. Similarly, Russia’s attempted full-scale invasion of Ukraine faltered in its first days in part due to poorly maintained tyres on its long-mothballed trucks, which reflected a broader Russian doctrine of “treating equipment and soldiers as expendable”, as opposed to Ukraine’s flexible, Nato-influenced maintenance culture.\n\nSurprisingly, perhaps, Brand expresses approval for Elon Musk. “What I find so admirable about Musk is that he keeps pushing the envelope of the possible in manufacturing,” he says. Just as Henry Ford revolutionised car manufacturing in the early 20th century with his Model T (which broke down a lot but was relatively easy to fix), so Musk’s Tesla has been a quantum leap, Brand argues. It catalysed the electric vehicle revolution, which has had an invaluable environmental impact. But Tesla also devised an ingenious way to make the entire underbody of its Model Y cars out of just two pieces of cast aluminium, whereas conventional cars used hundreds of parts that had to be welded, bonded, riveted together. Electric motors also have far fewer parts than internal combustion engines. Fewer parts means less to go wrong, which means less maintenance. This is how technology gets better, he says.\n\nThe flipside is, we now expect things to work all the time. “Most consumer products pretty much don’t require maintenance. You get an electric clock and plug it into the wall or change the batteries from time to time, and it’ll tell perfectly good time. You don’t have to do anything else. So there’s a getting out of the habit of expecting to do maintenance, and then when the thing has a problem, we’re offended: ‘Well, it’s not supposed to do that.’” For this reason Brand is also a huge fan of YouTube, where you can find lessons and instructions on how to fix just about anything. “We have higher expectations of not needing to maintain things, and lots of good ways to find out how to maintain them when we encounter a problem. So that’s basically progress, as far as I’m concerned.”\n\nBrand is now thinking about institutions in terms of maintenance, he says, and he has plenty of material. We’re speaking shortly after the Davos economic forum, where Donald Trump’s attempts to “acquire” Greenland came to a head, and the Canadian prime minister, Mark Carney, declared that there was a “rupture” in the “rules-based international order”. Rather than progress, we seem to be going in reverse here.\n\nLike the electronic clock, perhaps we’ve become so accustomed to the global order working (at least for powerful western nations), when it starts breaking we don’t know how to fix it. Brand is relatively relaxed, though. Some institutions might falter, others might prevail, or come back in a different form, he says. Davos is a good example of both: “Carney could say: ‘We’re having a rupture. And here’s a way to rethink ordering for the middle-level nations.’ So that was a great case of acknowledging an institution that’s in trouble – at an institution that was not in trouble: Davos.”\n\nBrand has been trying to foster a similar vein of long-term thinking with the Long Now Foundation. He co-founded it 30 years ago “to get people comfortable with thinking about not just the next 10,000 years, but more importantly, the last 10,000 years: we’ve come a long way, baby. How did that happen?” The idea began with an email conversation with the computer scientist and inventor Danny Hillis in 1994. They were discussing the year 2000, which had long been considered “the future”, but was then just six years away. The plan became to create an artwork “that would help pop through this membrane of the year 2000 for people, and let them take on various degrees and sizes of future, and not just the next decade”. Hillis conceived the Clock of the Long Now – a mechanical timepiece that would chronicle the next 10,000 years (the name came from Brian Eno, another collaborator). He had approached a lot of people with the idea, but, typically, it was Brand who responded and said: “OK. Let’s build the clock.”\n\nImprobable as it sounds, the clock is almost finished, buried a few hundred feet into a mountaintop in Texas. The land and the money were donated by the Amazon founder, Jeff Bezos. It’s really a giant work of land art, Brand explains. “There’s a statue of liberty in New York, and this is kind of a statue of responsibility. It’s beautifully engineered and beautifully constructed and designed as an experience … it’s going to be a day in your life you’ll never forget.” And maybe it will inspire visitors to think as big and long as Brand does. “It would be nice to have an institution of thinkers and explainers that can last as long as the clock does.” The foundation’s other initiatives have included a series of seminars on long-term thinking (hosted by Brand), a library of “books you would want to restart civilisation from scratch”, and a project to preserve all the world’s languages.\n\nThis benign global scope has always been a hallmark of Brand’s brand, combined, paradoxically, with a sense of entrepreneurship and individualism. The opening words of the first Whole Earth Catalog, for example, were: “We are as gods and might as well get good at it.” Born in Illinois, in relative privilege, he came of age in a postwar America that felt it had largely figured out the “operating manual for spaceship Earth”, as the forward-looking designer Richard Buckminster Fuller put it at the time. Atom bombs, computers, vaccines, space travel – anything seemed possible.\n\nBrand combined these grand ambitions with a human-scaled ethos of empowerment. The strapline of the Whole Earth Catalog was “access to tools”, and it was meant in the broadest sense. The huge, thick directory, first published in 1968, listed all kinds of literal tools for the budding commune-dweller – from seed drills to footwear, kayaks to macrame kits – but it also championed books on all manner of hippy-era interests: esoteric religions, sociology, architecture, philosophy, science, the occult, how to talk to dolphins, you name it. Ideas are tools too, Brand points out. As such, the Whole Earth Catalog offered access to a multitude of alternative lifestyles. “It opened doors for people in a way that invited them to consider, ‘maybe I could just build a guitar, or live off the grid.’ And so it had the impact of conferring agency,” he says.\n\nThe Whole Earth Catalog became a huge bestseller in the late 60s and 70s, which made Brand a lot of money – too much for his liking, in fact. In the early 70s he wound the publication down and founded the Point Foundation, which gave grants to worthy causes, though he continued to publish books and periodicals in a Whole Earth spirit until the early 2000s.\n\nOne of the key schisms of the counterculture was a tension between the technologists and the environmentalists. The former embraced space exploration and computing; the latter condemned industrial civilisation and consumer society as inherently destructive. Brand straddled both camps. He saw how they could complement each other. That Nasa image of the whole Earth, for example, he points out, galvanised conservation movements such as Earth Day and Greenpeace, but it “was a direct result of something that environmentalists hated, which was the space programme”.\n\nPredictably, Brand was in on the ground floor when it came to computers. In 1968 he was a camera operator at what is now known as “the mother of all demos” – a seismic event put on by the Stanford Research Institute showcasing what we would recognise today as the foundations of personal computing: windows, hypertext links, video conferencing, even navigation using a then-unheard-of “mouse”. In a 1972 article for Rolling Stone, Brand declared personal computing to be “good news, maybe the best since psychedelics”. “Actually quite a lot better,” he says today. “Because one of the things that soon became apparent was that psychedelics kind of levelled off”, whereas computers have been “an exponential takeoff”: Moore’s law (the doubling of processing power every two years), the internet, and now artificial intelligence – we’re still on that path.\n\nHaving lived through the rapid rise and fall of the commune movement, Brand saw the potential of online community early on. In 1984 he organised the Hackers Conference (these were the days when “hacking” simply meant “doing cool stuff with computing”), at which he coined the now-familiar maxim “information wants to be free”. A year later he co-founded the Whole Earth ’Lectronic Link (Well) as a sort of proto social media platform, with discussion forums on various topics. Meanwhile, many of Brand’s Whole Earth crew went on to found Wired magazine in 1993 (Brand features in the first issue, interviewing Camille Paglia).\n\nTo his critics, Brand paved the way for the neoliberal, libertarian mindset of today’s Silicon Valley. But he was also a community-focused idealist and a lifelong environmentalist. That technology v nature tension persists – hence his apparent affinity with tech figures such as Bezos and Musk. He’s still ambivalent: “Finding anything that is an absolutely unmitigated benefit is pretty rare,” he says. But “I would say the benefits of personal computers and smartphones and the internet vastly reached beyond, in good terms, what we imagined at the time.”\n\nIn terms of physical maintenance, Brand has always been a healthy, active, outdoorsy person – he was a keen sailor, he was hiking up mountains with rocks in his backpack in his 60s, and he started going to CrossFit when he was 75 – “that built a pretty strong constitution”. Now, though, he has a respiratory illness, he says, “which is progressive, incurable and fatal”. He’s in a stable condition, and still exercises, but uses supplementary oxygen as well. “I’d be very surprised by making it into my 90s,” he says, seemingly without regret: “Imagine the luck, to get to be 87 – it’s just fantastic!”\n\nBrand has always been an optimist, he says, and taking the long view, he still is. “I find optimism in terms of being able to find a way to not only continue but keep getting better.” It might be hard to see a positive way forward right now, but that’s always been the way, he says. Brand brings up yet another of his incarnations, the Global Business Network, a consultancy he was part of in the 90s that mapped out future scenarios to help clients plan ahead. “It’s harder to imagine how something might go well than go badly,” he says. But we do not need to passively accept our fate as if we have no control over it. “If you like some scenarios better than others, you can be aware of the ones you don’t like and look for signs of them, and also look at signs of the ones you want to have come to pass, and lean differentially toward them. That’s how you negotiate your way into a future you were glad of. It’s done incrementally by, among other things, lots of individuals and some institutions, and that’s how we grapple our way, muddle our way forward.”",

    "description": "After a long time in the wilderness, Zimbabwe are again contending on the biggest stage at the 2026 T20 World Cup - this is the story of their resurgence.",
    "fullText": "For those of a certain generation, the idea of the Zimbabwe cricket team succeeding on a global stage is entirely plausible.\n\nReaching the second stage of a World Cup, as they have in this T20 tournament, once seemed a possible and even expected achievement.\n\nThe late 1990s saw Test series wins against India and Pakistan.\n\nAt the 1999 World Cup, a side clad in a loud red uniform finished an admirable fifth in the Super Six stage, narrowly missing out on the semi-finals.\n\nWith stars like future England coach Andy Flower, and bowlers Heath Streak and Henry Olonga, they proved a relatively small country could provide some of the world's finest players.\n\nThe future looked bright. But then - wilderness.\n\nThis is how Zimbabwe battled back to impress again on the biggest stage.\n\nAt the 2003 World Cup - hosted by South Africa, Zimbabwe and Kenya - Flower and Olonga wore black armbands in response to the 'death of democracy' under the country's leader Robert Mugabe. Both men subsequently fled the country.\n\nA year later, 14 senior players resigned in protest at political interference and selection quotas. By 2006, massive defeats and off-field struggles led to Zimbabwe voluntarily suspending its own Test status.\n\nFor 15 years, the side languished with only occasional moments to remind dejected supporters of previous successes. A return to Test cricket in 2011 saw a win over Bangladesh, but national governing body Zimbabwe Cricket (ZC) accumulated debts reportedly as high as $27m (£20m at current conversion rate).\n\nSpeaking to the BBC in 2023, former all-rounder Sean Williams reflected on the darker days.\n\n\"There were more office members employed than players,\" he said. \"It was a nightmare.\n\n\"People knew how much money Zimbabwe Cricket was getting paid but nothing was happening. It looked like it was dying at that time - if not dead.\"\n\nThe nadir arguably came in 2019, when the International Cricket Council (ICC) suspended ZC and barred them from qualifying for the 2021 T20 World Cup.\n\nZimbabwe's black armband protest remembered\n\n'For 20 years I felt like Zimbabwe's most hated man'\n\nHowever, under the stewardship of chairman Tavengwa Mukuhlani, finances were tackled to become almost debt-free, the board operating on a shoestring budget to right a ship that had not so much been listing as sitting at the bottom of Lake Kariba.\n\nHuge sacrifices were made by staff, careful planning required to give a once-proud side the chance of recovery.\n\nFormer captain Tatenda Taibu told BBC Sport hope was never lost.\n\nHe said: \"Even when things seem to be going southward, there is a certain statement that's often said in Zimbabwe: 'I will make a plan'.\n\n\"There have been a lot of ups and downs from the 2000s, but anyone who knows Zimbabweans, you know Zimbabwe will bounce back.\"\n\nAs well as the work behind the scenes, the cricket approach became unusually old-school, with a focus on developing players in the red-ball game.\n\n\"When the new board took over, they made a conscious decision to say, 'Let's go back and play Tests - this is the only way our team's going to improve,'\" ZC managing director Givemore Makoni told the BBC last year.\n\n\"And since we started, we've seen some huge progress in terms of how the team is performing.\"\n\nThe appointment of Justin Sammons as head coach in 2024 was pivotal to a regular shift towards on-field success.\n\nSammons focused on fitness and embraced a culture of ensuring opportunities for young players, like opener Brian Bennett and fast bowler Blessing Muzarabani.\n\nBoth have starred in this T20 World Cup, helping the Chevrons finish top of Group B thanks to stunning wins over former champions Australia and Sri Lanka.\n\n\"The players must get the credit as they take to the field and execute all the various plans formulated,\" said former fast bowler and commentator Pommie Mbangwa.\n\n\"Management and coaching too should be recognised for their consistency, but there is never any doubt with regard to how hard all involved need to work in order to give themselves a chance of doing well.\"\n\nPerhaps the most significant on-field figure has been all-rounder and T20 captain Sikandar Raza.\n\nAfter moving from Pakistan to join his family in Zimbabwe in 2002, Raza put aside the disappointment of an eye condition ruining his hopes of becoming a fighter pilot and sought a career as a cricketer.\n\nThree player-of-the-match performances at the 2022 T20 World Cup, smashing 133 off 43 deliveries as his side hit a T20 international world record 344-4 against Gambia in 2024 and smacking a 54-ball hundred - Zimbabwe's fastest one-day international century - against the Netherlands in 2023 are just a few examples of his exploits.\n\n\"This is probably the first time in a long time where the fans have travelled to support,\" said Raza.\n\n\"That is because of the way we have played cricket over the last year. We have given them hope that this team is onto something and we can achieve something if we all are together.\n\n\"And that's just not the cricketers, or the changing room, or the technical staff. It is our fans. It is our media. It is the citizens of our country.\"\n\nNow approaching his 40th birthday, Raza continues to lead from the front.\n\nWhen sub-par performances meant a qualifying tournament in Kenya was required to reach this T20 World Cup, Raza's message was clear.\n\n\"I sat down with the squad and said either we feel sorry for ourselves and be ashamed or actually understand the reality,\" he said. \"It's because of us we are in this mess and it's only us who can get out of it.\"\n\nAnd he knows how proud those at home will be.\n\n\"Let's just be together and actually enjoy this because it's a huge achievement for the country,\" he added.\n\nFor those that saw the dark days, like Taibu, a moment like reaching the Super 8 stage must be treasured.\n\n\"In World Cups, Zimbabwe will always be an underdog. I'm very proud,\" he said.\n\nMbangwa added: \"It is wonderful to see the team do well on the world stage. It breeds positivity and gives so many people joy.\"\n\nAnd the future is bright, with a core of talented players, strong leadership and the prospect of an ICC event on home soil.\n\nThe men's 50-over World Cup in 2027 will be co-hosted by Zimbabwe, South Africa and Namibia, with matches played at a new, 10,000-seat stadium near Victoria Falls.\n\nAs to that vision of success in years to come, Mbangwa wants the country to cherish the now.\n\n\"What's important is to enjoy the present and keep doing what they're doing,\" he said.\n\nAfter coming through Group B unbeaten - a win over Oman and a washout against Ireland alongside those remarkables victories against Australia and Sri Lanka - Zimbabwe suffered a crushing 107-run defeat by West Indies in their Super 8 Group 1 opener.\n\nThey next face defending champions and co-hosts India - smarting from defeat by South Africa and in need of victory - in Chennai on Thursday.\n\nBut while the Chevrons are not favourites to progress to the semi-finals, nothing can be ruled out.\n\nAs Taibu says: \"Possibilities? They are always there where Zimbabwe is concerned.\"",

    "description": "What are the options facing England amid Jos Buttler's struggles at the T20 World Cup. Could they really drop their former captain?",
    "fullText": "It feels wrong to be even asking the question.\n\nJos Buttler is one of England's all-time white-ball greats – a two-time World Cup winner.\n\nBut the 35-year-old has looked horribly out of touch over the past few weeks and his two against Pakistan was his fourth single-figure score in a row.\n\nHe has put in extra net sessions and faced local spinners, padded up against England's options as well as coaches with the dog stick, yet nothing has lifted him from his slump as yet.\n\nCould England really make a change for Friday's final Super 8s match against New Zealand or next week's semi-final?\n\nHere are the options facing England and the issues at play…\n\nThis remains the most likely scenario – overwhelmingly so.\n\nCaptain Harry Brook strongly backed his predecessor after Tuesday's win over Pakistan, saying a return to form is \"just a matter of time\".\n\n\"People have got to cut him a little bit of slack,\" Brook said.\n\n\"He's been phenomenal. He's arguably our best player, he's [just] not hitting them out of the middle at the minute.\"\n\nButtler is the fourth highest run-scorer in T20 international history. He scored 83 from 35 balls against South Africa last September.\n\nBut the right-hander has not scored a fifty in any of his 16 international innings this winter and this is now the longest run of single-figure scores in his T20 international career.\n\nThough he has come through lean patches previously, the upturn has not always been immediate.\n\nAs England's 50-over World Cup spiralled in 2023, he did not score a fifty and made scores of nine, 15, eight, 10, one, five and 27 as his side exited the tournament.\n\nThis would be somewhat of a halfway house.\n\nWith Buttler struggling at the top, why not move him down the order where the pressure to score quickly is not as great? He does play the finisher role in 50-over cricket after all.\n\nButtler has batted at five and six 45 times in T20s for England, though not consistently since 2018.\n\nThis change would obviously require someone else to step up to open.\n\nEngland have various options, given both Tom Banton and Will Jacks are openers by trade.\n\nBut Banton was recalled specifically to play a role in the middle order because of his prowess attacking against spin. Jacks has also been England's player of the tournament so far with 159 runs from 90 balls as a finisher.\n\nBrook and Jacob Bethell have both opened in the Indian Premier League but Brook has just scored a stunning century at number three and Bethell is not the quickest starter.\n\nYou could simply swap Brook and Buttler, leaving Buttler to come in at first drop as he was up to the start of last summer for England. He also had a successful IPL at number three last year.\n\nThe way Buttler and Phil Salt complement each other in their opening partnership was viewed England's big strengths before the tournament, however.\n\nNone of these options are entirely straightforward.\n\nThe most drastic option also appears the least likely.\n\nButtler, who signed a new two-year central contract last year, has been a mainstay of England's white-ball teams for more than a decade. Could they really leave him out entirely for a World Cup semi-final?\n\nThat encounter may be at Mumbai's Wankhede Stadium, where Buttler has made scores of 94 not out, 89 and 116 in the IPL.\n\nBen Duckett is the spare batter in England's squad - another man struggling for form.\n\nDuckett is averaging 18.88 across 12 matches this winter across all formats and was out for a first-ball duck in his most recent innings at the start of the month.\n\nLeg-spinning all-rounder Rehan Ahmed would be a left-field replacement. That would be a massive call.\n\nPerhaps Friday's match against New Zealand, effectively a dead rubber for England given they are already through, is the perfect, pressure-free opportunity for Buttler to help make the hierarchy's decision an easy one.\n\n\"Who is writing Jos Buttler off?,\" said former England spinner Alex Hartley.\n\n\"If you are, get a grip. He is one of those players where it takes one shot crunched through the covers and he will be back.\n\n\"It would be a worry if England were not winning games. I have no doubt when push comes to shove Jos Buttler will be OK.\"\n\n'The day Brook showed he is an England leader'\n\nStunning Brook century leads England into semis\n\nIs Buttler's form a worry?

New Zealand can seal their place in the semi-finals with victory over England on Friday, while Sri Lanka face Pakistan in Pallekele on Saturday.\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "fullText": "Rich Beem has given some insight into what viewers at home might not pick up on about how Scottie Scheffler acts on the course, as the world number one looks to get back on track after an odd start to the year.\n\nScottie Scheffler may have already picked up a win this season, but his slow starts in recent events have caught more attention than his victory at The American Express.\n\nHe’s failed to shoot under par in the opening rounds of his last three tournaments: the WM Phoenix Open, the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am, and now the Genesis Invitational.\n\nOn Thursday at Riviera, he was five over through 10 holes when play was suspended, marking the worst opening round of his PGA Tour career.\n\nWhat’s made things stranger is how he has responded each time. Despite the slow starts, Scheffler hasn’t finished lower than 12th this year and was just one shot away from making the playoff at TPC Scottsdale.\n\nSpeaking on the Sky Sports Golf Podcast, Rich Beem said he is confused by what is happening with Scheffler right now. He also pointed out that the 29-year-old might not be as calm as people think.\n\n“I can’t explain it. Somebody has asked me what’s going on with Scottie Scheffler? Well, he’s human, first of all, we know that. It doesn’t make sense, especially from the standpoint of Phoenix, he still went out and made five or six birdies in the opening round and still shot over par,” he said.\n\n“I can understand maybe Riviera, opening day, very tough. I can even understand maybe a little bit where you get off to a bland start at Pebble Beach. It’s not going to get any easier going forward. I’m assuming his next start is going to be Bay Hill where he’s won. Then he’s going to go to The Players Championship, one of the hardest golf courses on tour.\n\n“It’s a trend that could continue just because of the venues, not that I fully expect it to, but it’s just not happening for him. And we all know that he gets a little hot under the collar at times. Maybe some people don’t quite see it as much as we do in the media when we follow him every day.”\n\nThere’s an argument that Scheffler handles pressure better than anyone else in the field. Few players look as relaxed when they’re out in front.\n\nBut heading into 2026, it’s been a while since we’ve seen him truly at his best. Even when results dipped early last season, he was coming off a hand injury – and most understood the slow return.\n\nHe’s had his moments of frustration too. The one that stands out is his reaction during the BMW Championship in 2024, which drew plenty of criticism at the time.\n\nEven so, you have to give Scheffler credit for how he’s managed to fight back recently. In each of his last three starts, he turned things around when it could have gone wrong.\n\nIf he hadn’t found a way to channel that frustration, there’s every chance he’d have missed two cuts already this season – and not by narrow margins either.\n\nWyndham Clark says if women’s golfers should be allowed to play on TGL\n\nRory McIlroy’s recent comments suggest a new caddie is needed to take his game to the next level\n\n90-year-old Gary Player shares key golf swing advice with eye-catching workout video",

    "fullText": "The World Baseball Classic is not just a tournament; it is a high-stakes, emotion-fueled battleground where national pride is on the line with every pitch. Since its inception in 2006, the WBC has delivered some of the most electric, unforgettable moments in the sport’s history, transforming spring training tune-ups into global spectacles. The tournament brings together the absolute best players on the planet, allowing them to drape their country’s flag over their shoulders and compete for ultimate bragging rights.\n\nOver the course of five iterations, with the next chapter set to unfold in 2026, certain nations have separated themselves from the pack. They have built dynasties, broken hearts, and consistently found ways to survive the chaotic, sudden-death nature of international tournament play. Some of these countries rely on deep pipelines of MLB superstars, while others lean on established domestic leagues and unmatched team chemistry to topple the heavyweights.\n\nBut when the dust settles, the truest measure of a baseball powerhouse is simple: who wins when the lights are brightest? Taking a look at the all-time victory leaderboard heading into the 2026 tournament reveals a fascinating hierarchy of global baseball talent. It highlights the expected juggernauts alongside a few nations that consistently punch above their weight on the international stage.​\n\nFrom the passionate fanbases of the Caribbean to the meticulously crafted rosters of Asia and the deep talent pools of North America, here is how the most successful countries in World Baseball Classic history stack up.\n\nMexico has steadily evolved into a legitimate force on the WBC stage, proving it can hang with anyone in the world. Their unforgettable run to the semifinals in 2023, highlighted by a massive upset over Team USA, proved that their blend of MLB talent and fearless pitching is a recipe for deep tournament runs. They always bring the heat and a passionately loud fan base to the ballpark.​\n\nDo not let the European flag fool you; the Netherlands is an absolute baseball powerhouse fueled by elite talent from Curaçao and Aruba. They have a reputation as the tournament’s ultimate giant-slayer, most notably breaking Dominican hearts with a pair of stunning walk-off wins in 2009. With a consistently slick-fielding infield and timely hitting, they are a perennial threat to reach the championship rounds.​\n\nVenezuela’s rosters always read like an MLB All-Star ballot, loaded with franchise cornerstones and elite sluggers. While they have occasionally struggled to translate that immense on-paper talent into championship hardware, their explosive offense makes them a nightmare matchup. When their pitching staff aligns with their heavy hitters, they are practically unstoppable.\n\nSouth Korea approaches the WBC with a level of tactical precision and national pride that makes them an incredibly tough out. Their dramatic run to the 2009 final against Japan cemented their status as an elite baseball nation. Armed with contact-heavy lineups and fundamentally flawless defense, they know exactly how to execute in high-pressure situations.\n\nLong considered the boogeymen of international amateur baseball, Cuba’s rich history in the sport translates beautifully to the WBC. They stormed to the finals in the inaugural 2006 tournament and have consistently remained a threat ever since. Even as the global talent pool has deepened, their aggressive style of play and raw athleticism demand total respect.​\n\nThe Dominican Republic brings a level of swagger and star power to the WBC that is simply unmatched. Their dominant, undefeated run to the 2013 championship remains one of the most impressive feats in tournament history. When this island nation gets rolling, it transforms the stadium into a massive party, fueled by elite pitching and light-tower power.\n\nDespite inventing the game, Team USA took a while to fully figure out the unique rhythm of the World Baseball Classic. They finally broke through to claim the crown in 2017 and followed it up with a thrilling run to the 2023 final. When the American superstars fully buy in, their sheer depth of talent is an overwhelming force of nature.\n\n​\n\nNo team plays with more visible joy, passion, and chemistry than Puerto Rico. They have suffered consecutive heartbreaking defeats in the 2013 and 2017 championship games, but their consistency is undeniably impressive. Famous for their blond hair dye and relentless energy, they are the heartbeat of the tournament and an absolute joy to watch.\n\nSamurai Japan is the undisputed king of the World Baseball Classic, boasting three tournament titles and an unmatched aura of dominance. From Daisuke Matsuzaka’s heroics in 2006 to Shohei Ohtani’s epic 2023 strikeout, their WBC history is the stuff of legend. Their incredible fundamental execution and elite pitching depth make them the ultimate gold standard of international baseball.\n\nMORE: Top 10 Winter Olympians of Team USA since 2000\n\nThe beauty of the World Baseball Classic lies in its unpredictability, where a single pitch can alter the course of a nation’s sporting history. While Japan currently sits comfortably on the throne, the gap between the traditional powerhouses and the rest of the world is rapidly closing. As we look ahead to 2026, the stage is set for new rivalries, fresh upsets, and another thrilling chapter in the greatest international baseball showcase on earth.\n\nOLYMPICS: Final 2026 Winter Olympics medal count, standings\n\nNFL: 4 blockbuster NFL trades we want to see before the 2026 draft\n\nNFL DRAFT: 2026 NFL Scouting Combine day-to-day TV schedule, how to watch\n\nMLB: MLB Power Rankings as 2026 Spring Training begins\n\nNBA: Updated NBA Power Rankings as a new week begins\n\nVIRAL: Watch Johnny Gaudreau’s children join Team USA hockey gold medal celebration\n\nThe post Most wins in World Baseball Classic’ appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "title": "Lasses Spotlight: Sunderland Women On The International Stage",
    "description": "There’s an international break coming up for Sunderland Women - how will this affect Mel Reay’s squad?",
    "fullText": "International breaks can sometimes feel like an interruption to the rhythm of a club season, but for Sunderland Women, this one serves as a powerful reminder of who they are becoming. Seven players have been called up across four nations, spanning senior World Cup qualifiers and youth international fixtures. Not one of these selections is unexpected. Every player involved is already a recognised figure within their national programme, and their call-ups reflect continuity, trust and the calibre of footballer Sunderland now attract and develop.\n\nFor a club that has rebuilt itself with patience and purpose, this international window is not merely a point of pride. It is a statement about Sunderland’s trajectory. The squad is no longer a collection of promising Championship players quietly working under the radar. It is a group whose influence stretches across continents, whose talent is acknowledged at the highest levels, and whose presence on the international stage feels entirely natural.\n\nKatie Kitching’s involvement with New Zealand is a perfect example. Her selection for the Football Ferns’ World Cup qualifiers is not a surprise, nor is it a sudden breakthrough. Kitching has been part of New Zealand’s plans for some time, and her performances for Sunderland have only reinforced her standing. She has been one of the club’s most consistent and influential players since she arrived, combining technical quality with intelligence and a relentless work ethic. Her ability to link midfield and attack, to carry the ball with purpose, and to dictate tempo has made her indispensable on Wearside.\n\nFor New Zealand, she offers versatility and composure in high-pressure fixtures. For Sunderland, her international involvement is another layer in her development, exposing her to different tactical demands and the intensity of knockout-style football. Her call-up is not a reward for a purple patch; it is a continuation of her established role within a national team preparing for a crucial qualifying campaign.\n\nThe Republic of Ireland contingent reflects a group of players who are already firmly embedded in their national setup, each at different stages of their international journey. Jamie Finn, Grace Moloney and Marissa Sheva are all familiar figures within the Irish squad, and their call-ups for World Cup qualifiers are entirely consistent with their standing.\n\nFinn, with more than twenty caps to her name, has long been a trusted figure for Ireland. Her versatility, tactical intelligence and composure have made her a reliable presence in green, just as they have in red and white. At Sunderland she has been a model of consistency, adapting seamlessly to different roles and offering a level of maturity that anchors the team around her. Her selection is not news; it is simply the continuation of a career that has already earned significant international respect.\n\nMoloney’s inclusion reflects her growing importance within the Irish goalkeeping group. With nine caps, she is still in the earlier stages of her international career, but she has quickly established herself as a dependable option. Her performances for Sunderland have shown her authority and shot-stopping qualities that translate naturally to the international stage. Her call-up is a recognition of her upward trajectory and the trust she has earned in recent windows.\n\nSheva, meanwhile, brings twenty caps’ worth of experience to the Irish forward line. Her energy, directness and relentless work rate have made her a valuable asset for Ireland, just as they have for Sunderland. She is a player who stretches defences, presses intelligently and offers versatility across the front line. Her involvement in the qualifiers is entirely expected, reflecting her established role within the squad and the consistency of her contributions.\n\nWales have also turned to Sunderland for their World Cup qualifiers, selecting Rhiannon Roberts and Mared Griffiths. Roberts is one of the most experienced internationals in the squad, a player whose leadership and defensive intelligence have been central to Wales’ progress in recent years. Her presence at Sunderland has already proven invaluable, offering guidance to younger players and stability in key moments. Her call-up is a continuation of a distinguished international career, and her performances in the WSL2 have shown that she remains a player of significant quality.\n\nGriffiths’ selection comes at a very different moment in her club journey. Having only just joined Sunderland on loan from Manchester United in January 2026, she has not yet made her debut for the club. Her call-up, therefore, is not a reflection of her time on Wearside but of her established standing within the Welsh national setup. A talented and composed midfielder, Griffiths has been steadily building her international profile, and her involvement in Wales’ qualifiers is a natural continuation of that trajectory. For Sunderland, her arrival and immediate international involvement underline the calibre of player the club is now able to attract.\n\nNew loan signing, Caragh Hamilton has also been called up for Northern Ireland. Interestingly enough on their announcement graphic as a ‘forward’ which surprise a few fans myself included. Although she is listed as a defender at club level, Northern Ireland have frequently used her higher up the pitch as a midfielder and winger, where her energy, ball carrying and pressing suit the demands of international football.\n\nHamilton’s inclusion in the Northern Ireland squad for the FIFA Women’s World Cup 2027 qualifiers against Switzerland and Turkiye is a deserved recognition of her consistency and experience at international level. Hamilton has been a senior Northern Ireland international since 2012 and has accumulated 53 caps and 7 goals for her country, making her one of the squad’s most seasoned players. Her versatility, experience and tactical intelligence make her an important asset as Northern Ireland look to build momentum in their World Cup qualifying campaign.\n\nMared Griffiths’ call up to the Wales senior squad for their upcoming fixtures is another important step in the rise of one of the most exciting young midfielders in British football. Still only eighteen, Griffiths has already made four senior appearances for Wales and scored once, building on an impressive youth international record that includes fifteen caps and three goals for the under seventeen side and six caps and one goal for the under nineteen team.\n\nShe plays primarily as a midfielder for Wales, operating with intelligence, energy and a natural ability to carry the ball through tight spaces. Her recent performances at club level, including her sensational long range goal on her Sunderland debut, have only strengthened her reputation as a player with enormous potential. Wales have used her in central and advanced midfield roles, trusting her creativity and composure in possession. Her ongoing development at Sunderland, combined with her growing international experience, makes her an increasingly important figure for Wales as they build towards future qualification campaigns.\n\nCompleting the list is Ella West, called up to Scotland’s Under-19 squad for a series of friendlies. While youth international fixtures may not carry the same weight as senior qualifiers, they are crucial in shaping the careers of young players. West has been on Scotland’s radar for some time, and her selection is a continuation of her involvement at youth level. For her, this is an opportunity to test herself against high-quality opposition, to experience the demands of international football, and to continue her development in an environment designed to challenge and elevate young talent.\n\nHer call-up also reflects Sunderland’s long-standing commitment to youth development. The club has a proud history of producing players who go on to represent their countries, and West’s inclusion continues that tradition. She is a player with significant potential, and her international involvement will only enrich her understanding of the game.\n\nTaken together, these call-ups paint a picture of a squad that is both diverse and deeply talented. Sunderland Women are no longer a team quietly rebuilding in the Championship; they are a club whose players are shaping international campaigns, influencing World Cup qualifiers, and representing their nations with pride. The breadth of call-ups, spanning New Zealand, Ireland, Wales and Scotland, speaks to the global reach of the squad and the quality that runs through it.\n\nFor the club, this international break is a moment to reflect on the progress made in recent years. Sunderland have built a squad that blends experience with youth, international pedigree with domestic promise. The players called up are not fringe figures or occasional squad members; they are central to their national teams’ plans. That level of recognition is not accidental. It is the result of careful recruitment, strong coaching and a culture that encourages players to grow, compete and aspire.\n\nThere is also a practical benefit. Players who compete internationally return with sharpened instincts, heightened confidence and a deeper understanding of the game. They bring back lessons learned from facing different styles, different systems and different pressures. That experience filters into the squad, raising standards and enriching the team’s tactical awareness.\n\nOf course, international duty also brings challenges. Travel, fatigue and the risk of injury are always considerations. But for Sunderland, the positives far outweigh the concerns. Having so many players involved in international football enhances the club’s reputation, attracts new talent and reinforces the message that Sunderland is a place where careers can flourish.\n\nAs the league resumes, the returning internationals will bring with them the momentum of representing their countries. They will return to a squad that has grown in confidence and cohesion, ready to push forward in the WSL2. And they will carry with them the pride of having worn their national colours, knowing that they are part of a club that supports and celebrates their ambitions.\n\nThis international break is not a pause for Sunderland Women. It is a milestone, a marker of how far the club has come and a glimpse of where it is heading. With players competing on the world stage, the future looks bright, ambitious and full of possibility. And when they return to Wearside, they will do so not just as Sunderland players, but as representatives of nations, carrying experience that will only strengthen the team’s journey ahead.",

    "description": "A video of influencer RJ Princy Parikh with David Miller went viral after India’s loss, but she claimed she received rape threats and body-shaming abuse, prompting her to delete it from Facebook and plan a police complaint. On the field, South Africa beat India by 76 runs, bowling them out for 111. David Miller starred with 63, while Jansen and Maharaj led the bowling.",
    "fullText": "In the clip, Parikh was seen circling Miller, with the caption “David Miller! What a player” and the on-screen line “I thought we were friends, David.”\n\nSoon after, Parikh claimed she started receiving serious online abuse, including rape threats and body-shaming comments. Because of this, she deleted the video from Facebook but kept it on Instagram, and said she plans to file a police complaint over the threats.\n\nSouth Africa crushed India by 76 runs in their first Super Eight match of the T20 World Cup 2026 at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad, leaving India in a must-win situation for their remaining two games to reach the semifinals. \n\nChasing 188, India were bowled out for just 111 in 18.5 overs, ending their 12-match T20 World Cup winning streak.\n\nIndia’s chase collapsed early, with Ishan Kishan and Tilak Varma falling cheaply. Suryakumar Yadav and Abhishek Sharma tried to rebuild, but Sharma was dismissed in the fifth over. \n\nWashington Sundar and Yadav also failed to build partnerships, and although Hardik Pandya and Shivam Dube added 35 runs, regular wickets kept India under pressure. Dube’s dismissal for 42 sealed India’s fate.\n\nSouth Africa’s bowlers dominated, with Marco Jansen taking 4/22, Keshav Maharaj 3/24, and Lungi Ngidi conceding just 15 runs in four overs. \n\nEarlier, David Miller anchored South Africa’s innings with a match-winning 63 off 35 balls after they were 20/3, sharing a 97-run stand with Dewald Brevis (45 off 29). Tristan Stubbs added a quick 44* to help South Africa post 187/7. Jasprit Bumrah took 3/15.",

    "fullText": "Morocco are weighing up a sensational move to hire Xavi Hernandez as doubts intensify over the future of head coach Walid Regragui just months before the 2026 World Cup, per The Athletic.\n\nThe Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF) has publicly denied that Regragui has left his post, but senior figures have sounded out potential replacements.\n\nFormer Barcelona midfielder and head coach Xavi is among the names being discussed.\n\nNo agreement has been reached, and sources close to the Spanish tactician suggest he would prefer to take on a new role after this summer’s tournament rather than immediately.\n\nRegragui made history by guiding Morocco to the semi-finals of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, the furthest any African nation has progressed in the competition.\n\nThat remarkable run increased expectations at home, fuelled by significant investment in facilities and infrastructure over the past decade.\n\nHowever, subsequent tournaments have failed to match that high.\n\nMorocco exited at the last-16 stage of the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations and then fell agonisingly short in last month’s 2025 final, losing in extra time to Senegal on home soil.\n\nCriticism of Regragui’s pragmatic style has grown louder, with pressure mounting despite his previous achievements.\n\nMorocco have been drawn alongside Brazil, Scotland and Haiti at the expanded 2026 finals in the United States, Canada and Mexico, and the FRMF could make a coaching change before the tournament begins.\n\nXavi would be a bold appointment. The 46-year-old impressed during his stint as Barcelona head coach, winning the league and Spanish Super Cup while blooding many young players.\n\nA World Cup winner with Spain in 2010, he enjoyed a glittering career at Barcelona, lifting four Champions League titles and eight La Liga crowns.\n\nHe moved into coaching with Al-Sadd and later returned to manage Barcelona between 2021 and 2024.",

    "fullText": "Liverpool could hit two birds with one stone if they are to sign the latest name being linked with the club.\n\nAccording to the father of Roland Sallai, Szoboszlai's international teammate, Liverpool have already made contact to sign the Galatasaray winger.\n\n\"Liverpool could be such a destination, and I admit, I wouldn't be surprised if this club change happened now, in the winter,\" Tibor Sallai told Blikk.\n\n\"I know that contact has already been made through a management office. I don't want to and I don't want to shout anything, but my son will really have a good chance in the summer, if there is an offer that is also beneficial for Galatasaray, to change country and level. It wouldn't be just any moment if Liverpool were to run out onto the Anfield Road turf with three Hungarians in the starting lineup.\"\n\nSallai's father is referencing the fact that Liverpool already have Milos Kerkez and Szoboszlai playing for them.\n\nHere's why this could be a really good move for Liverpool. While Sallai is a little bit on the more experienced side he is an extremely versatile player.\n\nPredominantly, he is a winger. He has been playing that position ever since he started his career in senior football.\n\nBut this season Sallai has also become a right-back at Galatasaray. He's played really well in that position, impressing against Juventus and Manchester City in the Champions League, while coming up against some really tricky wingers.\n\nSo, there should be no surprise that he would be on Liverpool's radar. Sallai is the type of player Liverpools' recruitment team have loved over the last few years.\n\nHe can solve a problem at right-back, he can provide depth on the wings, and on top of that he's even played through the middle for Hungary's national team, so he could potentially be used as a false nine, too.",

    "fullText": "Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JP Morgan Chase, has warned that some lenders are doing “dumb things” and he is starting to see parallels to the era before the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nDimon, 69, who steered America’s biggest bank through the global financial crisis, told investors: “Unfortunately, we did see this in ’05, ’06 and ’07, almost the same thing — the rising tide was lifting all boats, everyone was making a lot of money, people were leveraging to the hilt.\n\n“My own view is people getting a little comfortable that this is real, these high asset prices and high volumes, and we won’t have any kind of problem, whatsoever.”\n\n• How a doomsday AI blog post wiped out billions\n\nReferring to unspecified competitors, he added: “I see a couple people doing some dumb things. They’re just doing dumb things to create [net interest income], or say they’re winning in the mortgage business.”\n\nHe also said he expects the credit cycle will eventually deteriorate again, potentially as a result of AI related disruption to software companies.\n\n“There’s always a surprise in a credit cycle … And this time around, it might be software, because of AI … There’s moving tectonic plates underneath it, it causes the industry to be challenged.”\n\nDimon warned in October about weakness in the credit market after the collapses of auto lender Tricolor Holdings and car-parts supplier First Brands Group. He told investors at the time: “When you see one cockroach, there are probably more, and so everyone should be forewarned of this one.”\n\nDimon’s latest warning came as a Bank of America client survey found that, for the first time, an “AI bubble” is the biggest concern of credit investors, who noted the high levels of borrowing of cloud service providers, known as “hyperscalers”, including Microsoft, Amazon, Meta Platforms and Google.\n\nInvestors expect hyperscaler debt issuance of $285 billion this year, up from the $210 billion expected in December’s survey. Some 23 per cent of respondents saw the threat of an AI bubble as their top concern, up from 9 per cent in Bank of America’s previous survey in December.\n\nFears of a potentially unsustainable surge in investment and valuations of AI companies overtook “bubbles in credit” as the top concern, according to the survey.\n\nMeanwhile, “few worry about geopolitics or a central bank policy error”, the bank’s analysts wrote.\n\nHowever, investors were less worried about the ultimate tech disruption ahead, with only 10 per cent saying that AI-driven corporate obsolescence is their big worry.",

    "fullText": "The Citrini Research report titled “The 2028 Global Intelligence Crisis” became a major viral sensation this week across social media platforms. The conversation has been dominated by a significant lean toward the findings as 77% of influencers align with the warnings while 23% express disagreement. The report gained massive traction because it presents a detailed scenario in which the success of artificial intelligence (AI) leads to a systemic financial collapse. It specifically targets the stability of the global economy and has influenced market prices for several major technology and payment companies as people evaluate the implications of abundant machine intelligence, says GlobalData, a leading intelligence and productivity platform.\n\nShreyasee Majumder, Social Media Analyst at GlobalData, comments: “The overall sentiment among influencers reflects a deep and growing anxiety about the unmodeled risks associated with rapid technological advancement. Most observers view the report as a vital stress test for existing economic assumptions about labor and consumption. Influencers see the current environment as a high stakes game where labs and corporations are forced to automate even if doing so eventually damages the consumer base that supports their revenue.”\n\nBased on an analysis of the tweets, the reaction to Citrini Research’s report is polarized, viral, and highly engaged.

    "fullText": "Japan’s OHISAMA demonstration satellite is scheduled to be launched in fiscal 2026 on a mission that could revolutionize clean energy.\n\nAlthough earlier experiments have detected signals transmitted from orbit, the OHISAMA project aims to be the first in the world to deliver solar power to a receiving site on Earth and convert it into usable electricity.\n\nThe satellite will be carried aboard Space One Co.’s Kairos 5 small rocket.\n\nSpace-based solar power (SBSP) refers to the concept of placing large solar collectors in orbit that can convert sunlight into electricity onboard. That energy is transmitted wirelessly, typically by microwave or in some concepts by laser, to a receiving station on Earth.\n\nThe received energy is then converted back into electricity for distribution through the grid.\n\nSBSP remains an experimental technology and is positioned as a long-term research and development target under the Japanese government’s Basic Energy Plan.\n\nUnlike ground-based solar and wind power, SBSP is largely insulated from weather-related variables and the day-night cycle.\n\nIn addition, the ability to modulate transmission output and redirect power to different locations could make SBSP a flexible option during disasters and periods of fluctuating demand.\n\nA model proposed by Japan Space Systems (J-spacesystems), a nonprofit R&D foundation commissioned by the Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry to develop the system, envisions an architecture featuring 2.5-kilometer-square solar arrays deployed in geostationary orbit about 36,000 kilometers above Earth.\n\nElectricity generated in orbit would be transmitted by microwave to a ground-based receiving antenna roughly 4 kilometers in diameter and then fed into the power grid.\n\nUnder this model, a single SBSP unit would generate about 1 gigawatt, an output described as sufficient to cover more than 10 percent of Tokyo’s annual electricity consumption.\n\nMICROWAVES BEAMED FROM 450 KM ABOVE\n\nAccording to J-spacesystems, the experiment will test whether power transmitted from space as microwaves can be efficiently converted back into electricity on the ground.\n\nThe OHISAMA satellite, weighing about 180 kg, carries an integrated power-generation and transmission panel measuring 70 cm by 2 meters.\n\nIts generating capacity is a modest 720 watts, but the mission aims to use energy received by a 64-meter parabolic antenna at the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency’s (JAXA) Usuda Deep Space Center in Nagano Prefecture to light an LED.\n\nThe Usuda facility is used to track and communicate with deep-space spacecraft.\n\nFollowing a successful wireless power transmission test from an aircraft at an altitude of 7 km in 2024, the satellite mission will beam power from a 450-km orbit to assess how transmission distance, the ionosphere and the atmosphere affect efficiency.\n\nA central challenge in SBSP wireless power delivery is limiting diffraction-driven beam spreading, which typically requires very large transmitting apertures and precise phase control.\n\nMany SBSP concepts rely on retrodirective beam control: the ground-based rectenna sends a pilot signal that the satellite uses to steer the microwave beam back toward the receiver.\n\nJapan has extensive R&D experience in microwave power transmission and retrodirective beam pointing.\n\nAccording to J-spacesystems, SBSP development is accelerating in the United States, China and Europe, and the U.S. military is also widely believed to be pursuing its own experimental satellites.\n\nFirst proposed in the United States in the 1960s, the SBSP concept holds that space-based systems could deliver as much as 10 times more energy per year than terrestrial solar because cloud cover and the day-night cycle constrain generation on Earth.\n\nIn Japan, SBSP research and development has been under way since the 1980s. Through ground-based trials and other tests, Japan has advanced the demonstration and validation of key component technologies, including high-precision beam control, integrated generation-and-transmission panels, and more efficient conversion of electrical power into microwaves.\n\n“Technologically, Japan is leading the world in this field,” said Hiroki Yanagawa, a senior executive in J-spacesystems’ Satellite System and Earth Observation Division.\n\nSBSP COULD POWER LUNAR EXPLORATION\n\nIn 2023, the California Institute of Technology launched an SBSP demonstrator and succeeded in short‑distance power transmission in space as well as in detecting faint microwave signals on the ground. But it did not deliver usable electricity at meaningful levels.\n\nIf electricity beamed from OHISAMA can be received, converted and used on the ground, it would represent a world first.\n\nSuch a success would likely be followed by additional in-orbit trials, with an eye toward commercialization in the 2040s. Potential longer-term applications include supplying power from orbit to support lunar exploration missions.\n\nThe launch schedule, however, remains contingent on the performance of Space One’s Kairos rocket.\n\nAfter failures of the first two launches, attention has shifted to the flight of Kairos 3 on Feb. 25.\n\n“While overseas rockets were an option, we selected Kairos in line with national policy to support Japan’s private-sector launch capabilities,” said Yanagawa of J-spacesystems.",

    "fullText": "As the Northeast U.S. begins to dig out from a powerful blizzard, more than two dozen flights in and out of Southwest Florida International Airport (RSW) in Fort Myers were canceled on Tuesday, Feb. 24, according to FlightAware.\n\nThe blizzard caused over 2,000 U.S. flights to be canceled Tuesday, with the bulk of disruptions in and around New York, Boston and Philadelphia.\n\nAcross Florida airports, 114 flights were delayed and around 385 canceled, with most at Orlando, Fort Lauderdale, Miami and Tampa.\n\nOn Monday, Feb. 23, the winter storm caused at least 90 cancellations and 15 delays at RSW.\n\nAirlines, including American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, JetBlue, Southwest and United Airlines, are waiving change fees and fare differences for those who planned to travel to the hardest-hit areas and now need to change plans.\n\nAccording to FlightAware.com, which provides real-time flight information, as of 7:30 a.m., the following delays and cancellations of flights have been reported within, into or out of the United States today, Feb. 24:\n\nFlight cancellations and delays at RSW as of 10 a.m., Feb. 23, according to FlightAware:\n\nHere's the breakdown by airport as of around 7:30 a.m. Feb. 24. Click the airport names for detailed flight info and updated numbers throughout the day.\n\nDon't wait until you're already at the airport to check your flight. Monitor your flight early and often, starting now, as cancellations will increase as the weather conditions worsen.\n\nDownload your airline’s mobile app and turn on push and text notifications for alerts about your flight. Some apps have a “Where’s My Plane?” feature that lets you see whether the aircraft scheduled to operate your flight has arrived, is delayed en route, or hasn’t departed yet from its previous airport. That can be an early signal of trouble.\n\nIf your flight is canceled, use the airline's mobile app to rebook as soon as possible, according to Scott Keyes, founder of Going. If you need to talk to someone, Keyes suggests calling one of the carrier’s international lines.\n\n\"The best thing travelers can do is to be as proactive as possible switching to a new flight,” Keyes told USA TODAY. “When a flight gets canceled, all of a sudden hundreds of passengers need new itineraries. There may only be a handful of seats left on the best flights, and it's a first-come, first-(served) endeavor.”\n\nIf your flight is canceled for any reason, you’re entitled to a full refund if you choose not to fly on alternative itineraries offered by your airline. The same goes for “significant” delays or changes.\n\nYou can get all of Florida’s best content directly in your inbox each weekday day by signing up for the free newsletter, Florida TODAY.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Fort Myers News-Press: RSW airport flight cancellations today after Northeast blizzard",

    "description": "The UK-based autonomous vehicle software startup said on Tuesday it had raised $1.5 billion from a host of Big Tech giants and global automakers.",
    "fullText": "Wayve is revving up its global robotaxi ambitions with fresh funding as it prepares to take on Waymo in London.\n\nThe UK-based autonomous vehicle software startup announced early Tuesday in the UK that it had raised $1.5 billion from a host of Big Tech giants and major automakers.\n\nThe funding round, which values the startup at $8.6 billion, includes $1.2 billion from investors including Microsoft, Nvidia, and Uber, as well as Mercedes-Benz, Nissan, and Stellantis.\n\nIt also includes additional capital from Uber, which is tied to deployments of Wayve-powered robotaxis across the globe. The two companies have a deal to launch self-driving vehicles on Uber's app in over 10 markets worldwide, starting with London this year.\n\n\"We've been learning to drive on British roads for the last eight years, and so this is our home turf,\" Alex Kendall, CEO of Wayve, told Business Insider in an interview.\n\nThe CEO said the latest funding round is key to pursuing the company's ambition to license its software to major automakers and robotaxi fleet platforms like Uber.\n\nUnlike Tesla or Waymo, Wayve is solely focused on developing software for other companies looking to deploy self-driving cars. It is not building its own fleet of robotaxis.\n\nKendall said owning a fleet is expensive, and Tesla's approach to building its own car can be a constraint since it limits the company to one vehicle platform.\n\n\"Everyone wants autonomy, but not everyone wants to buy a Tesla,\" he said.\n\nKendall added that Wayve's AI driver is designed to be generalizable — the same way a human can quickly learn to drive different cars and in new cities.\n\nThat allows Wayve's technology to quickly adapt to new driving environments and learn new road rules, from switching to the opposite side of the road to right turns at a red light, without relying on high-definition mapping and sensors, the approach taken by rivals like Waymo. It also allows the AI driver to be adapted by different automakers, which may have different sensor configurations on their cars, such as lidar or cameras.\n\n\"Because that's what we've built, it enables us to take this business model that enables high-margin software revenues,\" Kendall said.\n\nWayve says that over the past year, its fleet of Ford Mach-Es outfitted with its AI driver has driven in more than 500 cities across Europe, North America, and Japan without being trained on city-specific data.\n\nThe company is also planning to license its technology to carmakers as an advanced driver-assistance system like Tesla's Full Self-Driving, which handles most driving tasks with human supervision. Wayve has a deal with Nissan that will see its AI tech power the Japanese carmaker's ProPilot driver assistance system from 2027.\n\nThe UK-based startup has been testing its tech in London since 2017, and its public debut comes as the city's robotaxi scene gets increasingly crowded.\n\nWaymo is aiming to begin operating its autonomous vehicles in London, its first international location, this year, while Wayve vehicles will be joined on the Uber app by robotaxis from Chinese tech giant Baidu, which is also partnering with Lyft.",

    "title": "Now Discord Is Saying It's Delaying Global Age Verification",
    "description": "Discord is taking its age verification rollout back to the drawing board.",
    "fullText": "Since it was announced a little over a week ago, Discord's global age verification rollout has been a bit of a mess. First, the chatroom and voice chat company had to clarify that it won't require all adults to upload an ID or facial scan to prove how old they are, as the initial post left many users with that impression. Second, the announcement came shortly after one if its existing customer service partners was breached, which lead to hackers getting a hold of user information, including government IDs provided for age verification. Third, users discovered that Discord had partnered with Peter Thiel-backed company Persona for an experiment in the UK, which raised flags about surveillance and security, and saw some personal identifying information being uploaded to the cloud when users thought it would be processed on-device. Now, Discord is admitting that it messed up, and is trying to make amends.\n\nIn a post on its website, titled \"Getting Global Age Assurance Right: What We Got Wrong and What's Changing,\" Discord admitted that its new \"teen-by-default\" age settings haven't had the warmest reception. The company said that it \"knew this rollout was going to be controversial,\" but added that \"we failed at our most basic job: clearly explaining what we're doing and why.\" It then reiterated that \"over 90% of users will never need to verify their age to continue using Discord exactly as they do today,\" while still doubling down on providing \"real safeguards\" for teenage users. That said, corporate damage control aside, the company also said it's going to delay the global age verification rollout, and is going to make concrete changes to attempt to address user concerns.\n\nTo that end, Discord is making the following changes to its controversial global age verification rollout:\n\nGlobal age verification will now be delayed from March to the \"second half of 2026.\" Until that point, age verification will only remain active in areas where it is legally required, like the UK and Australia.\n\nOn launch, Discord will provide a list of every age verification vendor it works with and their practices.\n\nAll age verification partners will only offer facial scanning on-device.\n\nBefore global age verification launches, Discord will develop alternative age verification methods beyond scanning your face or providing an ID, like providing credit card information instead. However, such methods might not be legally allowed in certain area, like Australia, the UK, and Brazil.\n\nDiscord will add spoiler channels as an option for communities, so they don't need to use age-restricted channels to hide age appropriate, but still sensitive, content anymore. This will allow accounts that aren't able to age verify to access these channels.\n\nThe company will publish a technical blog once age verification launches going into detail on how its systems work, and will add age verification metrics, including how many users were asked to verify or which age verification methods they used, to ongoing transparency reports.\n\nEssentially, the idea is that if you're an adult Discord user (and you live in a region that allows it, which Discord says may not be everywhere), Discord will likely be able to use factors like your signup email, your account age, and your activity to guess your age. If so, you'll be automatically filtered into the correct age group and will be able to keep using the app as usual. Otherwise, you'll be labeled a teen, and will need to verify by either scanning your face, providing a government ID, or using one of Discord's new alternative methods. Or, you could keep using the app unverified, but you'll lose access to age-restricted channels and any content Discord thinks is inappropriate enough to block for you.\n\nTo that end, not much has changed about Discord's end goals, and the company did acknowledge that \"we know many of you believe the right answer is not to do this at all.\" However, Discord also said that its hand is being forced in regions including the UK, Australia, and Brazil, with \"Europe and multiple US states close behind.\" In scaling age verification globally, Discord says it wants to \"show regulators that it's possible to verify age without collecting identity,\" also stating that \"we don't want to know who you are. We just need to know whether you're an adult.\"\n\nTo be fair, that still seems to involve knowing who users are to some extent, as you'll still need to hand over some type of personal identifying information to verify, or rely on Discord's age prediction to collect information to estimate your age in the background. But as a show of good faith, Discord acknowledged its \"experiment\" with Persona, and that Persona's use of off-device facial scanning did not meet its bar for privacy.\n\nWhat happens next is unclear. Discord's made a lot of promises, but now it has to follow through on them. The company also didn't provide a strict deadline for its age verification rollout, so its possible it could continue to get pushed back in regions that don't legally require it. However, Discord is also up for for an IPO sometime this spring. Certainty and a happy consumer base will likely make investors happy, but that probably also means keeping regulators and concerned parents appeased. Continue to expect compromises, especially when Discord has already come under fire for exposing teens to sensitive material and adult conversations before.",

    "fullText": "T20 World Cup, Super 8 Group 2, Pallekele\n\nPakistan 164-9 (20 overs): Farhan 63 (45); Dawson 3-24\n\nEngland 166-8 (19.1 overs): Brook 100 (51); Shaheen 4-30\n\nHarry Brook's sensational century under pressure led England into the T20 World Cup semi-finals with a two-wicket victory over Pakistan in Pallekele.\n\nThe England captain promoted himself to number three after Phil Salt was dismissed first ball and made exactly 100 in a chase of 165.\n\nIt was the first time Brook had batted first drop in his T20 international career but he played the situation perfectly, going up and down the gears as wickets fell around him.\n\nJos Buttler failed again - out for three in the third over - while Jacob Bethell fell for eight and Tom Banton two as England slipped to 58-4.\n\nBut Brook hit 10 fours and four sixes - once again delivering on his undeniable talents.\n\nHe was bowled by Shaheen Afridi a ball after reaching his hundred - the first of his T20 international career - in 50 balls but by then only 10 runs were needed from the last three overs.\n\nBrook's team-mates still threatened to throw all of his good work away as the wickets of Will Jacks and Jamie Overton followed, leaving it to Jofra Archer to swing away the winning runs with five balls to spare.\n\nIt means Brook's side return to India for a semi-final on either Wednesday or Thursday next week, with their opponents and the venue still to be confirmed by the remainder of the Super 8 stage.\n\nThey are there without ever really convincing - here they were sloppy in the field when restricting Pakistan to 164-9 - but are the first team to secure their spot in the last four.\n\nPakistan must hope other results go their way and win the final Group 2 game against Sri Lanka at this venue on Saturday.\n\nBrook century blasts England into semi-finals\n\n'Clocked' by a bouncer in Wellington, as culpable as anyone in the dismal Ashes defeat in Australia, pictured drinking in Noosa and found to have lied when apologising in Sydney.\n\nBrook has had quite the winter.\n\nThis, though, was everything good about England's white-ball captain. He batted at his destructive best.\n\nSurprise greeted the sight of Brook walking down the steps rather than Bethell after Salt nicked off to Shaheen but the thinking was smart.\n\nIt kept the right-hander away from Pakistan's five spinners on a turning pitch at the start of his innings and allowed him to take advantage of the powerplay fielding restrictions.\n\nBrook faced three dots in his first five balls but then took left-armer Salman Mirza for a four and six in the second over.\n\nHe muscled a brutal straight six over long-on off while hitting spinner Mohammad Nawaz for 17 in the sixth, before nudging singles after Banton nicked off to Usman Tariq. The mystery spinner was Pakistan's major threat.\n\nAt halfway, Brook kicked on again, crashing leg-spinner Shadab Khan for a perfect straight six. He scored all around the ground but those straight hits and his drives through the covers were particularly eye-catching.\n\nHe reached three figures with two more hits over mid-off - one for six and another a one-bounce four.\n\nIt made him the third man to score centuries in all three formats for England, after Jos Buttler and Dawid Malan, but more importantly it keeps them on course for a third T20 title.\n\nThe win means England qualify before their final Super 8 game against New Zealand on Friday. They can use that match to try and fine tune.\n\nButtler's form remains a major worry. One of England's all-time greats, who has scored 15 runs in his last five innings and got a bottom edge on a cut here, is struggling.\n\nBefore that, England's fielding, which had remained strong through the tight wins against Nepal, Scotland and Italy in the group stage and Sri Lanka on Sunday, faltered.\n\nBethell let two regulation stops through his hands on the boundary and Brook dropped Shadab on four before he made an important 23. There was also the careless moment of a no-ball for one too many fielders outside the 30-yard circle.\n\nSahibzada Farhan was Pakistan's highest scorer with 65 but he and Babar Azam batted too slowly in a partnership of 46 in 44 balls.\n\nLiam Dawson and Jamie Overton did well to restrict Pakistan in the second half of the innings. Left-arm spinner Dawson took three wickets and a fine high catch while Overton bowled Babar and had Farhan lbw, also taking an excellent diving catch of his own.\n\nThey ensured Pakistan did not kick on from their platform and, along with Brook, were the other major plusses for England.\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "fullText": "Every year, the football world shifts its attention to one of the most important checkpoints in the pre-draft calendar — the NFL Scouting Combine. Hosted in Indianapolis at Lucas Oil Stadium, the event marks the true beginning of draft season for front offices across the National Football League. It’s where film study meets measurable reality — where speed, explosiveness, strength, and movement skills are tested under a microscope. For prospects, it’s not just an evaluation; it’s a high-stakes job interview played out in front of coaches, executives, and scouts from every team.\n\nThis year’s spotlight centers on the players ranked at the top of Daniel Jeremiah’s latest top prospect board, a group loaded with elite athletic traits and immediate NFL potential. The list reflects the modern direction of the league — explosive edge defenders, versatile defensive backs, dynamic skill players, and quarterbacks capable of handling complex offensive systems. While game tape built their reputations, the combine will test how those traits translate in standardized drills and competitive environments. For some, it’s a chance to confirm elite status. For others, it’s an opportunity to rise dramatically with one standout performance.\n\nAs the drills begin and the testing numbers roll in, these top prospects enter the most revealing phase of their pre-draft journey. The combine won’t finalize their draft positions — but it will shape the conversation around them in a big way.\n\nMendoza carries himself like a true franchise quarterback, showing poise and command in high-pressure situations. His arm talent allows him to make layered throws with timing and precision, while his size helps him absorb contact and stay composed. He processes defenses quickly and rarely looks rushed mentally. Teams see a quarterback who can operate structure but still create when plays break down.\n\nLove is one of the most explosive offensive weapons in the class, capable of scoring from anywhere on the field. His acceleration through the hole and long-speed in open space make him a constant big-play threat. He runs with patience and vision, then flips a switch once he sees daylight. If his testing matches the tape, he’ll solidify elite playmaker status.\n\nBailey is a disruptive edge rusher with the power and burst to stress offensive tackles snap after snap. He plays with physical urgency, attacking the pocket and forcing quarterbacks off their spots. His length helps him control contact and win leverage battles at the line. Evaluators are especially intrigued by how much more upside he still has as his pass-rush toolbox develops.\n\nReese is an explosive athlete off the edge with range that shows up against both the run and pass. He closes space quickly and flashes the ability to wreck plays in the backfield. His pursuit motor stands out — he doesn’t quit on plays and consistently chases down ball carriers. With refinement, he has the traits of a high-impact defensive playmaker.\n\nStyles brings size, speed, and versatility that allow him to impact the game in multiple defensive roles. He moves fluidly in coverage but also plays with downhill force against the run. His physical profile makes him a matchup eraser against modern hybrid offenses. Coaches value defenders who can stay on the field in any situation — Styles fits that mold.\n\nBain is a relentless pass rusher who plays with power, urgency, and technical discipline. He consistently generates pressure by converting speed to strength and attacking leverage points. His intensity shows in how hard he plays every snap, especially in pursuit. He profiles as the type of defender offenses must account for in protection schemes.\n\nTate is a refined route runner who wins with timing, precision, and body control. He tracks the ball naturally and consistently positions himself to make difficult catches look routine. His game is built on reliability — quarterbacks can trust him to be exactly where he’s supposed to be. He projects as a dependable high-volume receiving target.\n\nDelane is a long, athletic corner with strong coverage instincts and physical press ability. He competes aggressively at the catch point and shows confidence challenging receivers downfield. His movement skills allow him to stay attached through routes and recover when needed. He has the traits teams look for in a boundary corner who can handle top matchups.\n\nDowns is a true playmaking safety with range, awareness, and sharp diagnostic skills. He reads offensive concepts quickly and arrives at the ball with decisive speed. Whether in coverage or run support, he consistently impacts plays with sound positioning. His instincts and football IQ make him one of the most complete defensive backs in the class.\n\nLemon is an electric playmaker whose acceleration and agility stand out immediately. He thrives after the catch, turning short receptions into explosive gains with quick cuts and burst. His ability to stretch the field vertically adds another dimension to his game. Offenses will value his versatility and big-play potential from multiple alignments.\n\nUltimately, this group represents the talent expected to define the early portion of the 2026 NFL Draft. The combine serves as both validation and opportunity — confirming what evaluators believe while opening the door for new storylines. From measurable dominance to unexpected breakout performances, this week helps transform top prospects into future professionals.\n\nOLYMPICS: Final 2026 Winter Olympics medal count, standings\n\nNFL: 4 blockbuster NFL trades we want to see before the 2026 draft\n\nNFL DRAFT: 2026 NFL Scouting Combine day-to-day TV schedule, how to watch\n\nMLB: MLB Power Rankings as 2026 Spring Training begins\n\nNBA: Updated NBA Power Rankings as a new week begins\n\nVIRAL: Watch Johnny Gaudreau’s children join Team USA hockey gold medal celebration\n\nThe post Top draft prospects ahead of the 2026 NFL scouting combine appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "description": "Package managers are legion. Every programming language and operating system has its own solution, each with subtly different semantics for dependency resolution. This fragmentation prevents multilingual projects from expressing precise dependencies across language ecosystems; it leaves external system and hardware dependencies implicit and unversioned; it obscures security vulnerabilities that lie in the full dependency graph. We present the \\textit{Package Calculus}, a formalism for dependency resolution that unifies the core semantics of diverse package managers. Through a series of formal reductions, we show how this core is expressive enough to model the diversity that real-world package managers employ in their dependency expression languages.",

    "fullText": "We explore the strange food-obsessed world of a new game whose tech was once called ‘an insult to life itself’ by Hayao Miyazaki, the film-maker behind Spirited Away\n\nA strange piece of software has recently landed on the PC gaming store Steam. And “software” feels like the cleanest way to describe it. Existing somewhere between a full-blown life sim, a science project and a kind of haunted fish tank, Anlife: Motion-learning Life Evolution probably would have disappeared without making much impact if it wasn’t for one unusual factor. Several years ago some of its creators were absolutely roasted on camera by one of the genuine legends of Japanese animation.\n\nBack in 2016, Hayao Miyazaki, the director of movies such as Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away, was shown new technology that used AI in order to animate models. Faced with a zombie that utilised its head to move by knocking its skull against the ground and wriggling its body like a fish, Miyazaki declared what he had seen was “an insult to life itself”. It’s hard not to watch the clip without feeling slightly seared – but now, a decade later, the ashen-faced developers from that room have sufficiently recovered to make their work widely available.\n\nJudging by the chatter surrounding the launch, at least some of the people downloading Anlife are doing so in the hope that it might provide some kind of indication of the current state video games’ relationship with AI. Putting aside the often broad use of that term, this is certainly a thing that’s worth trying to understand, whether it’s because of the job losses caused by AI or blamed on AI, or the sheer number of games made with the assistance of AI models now landing on storefronts such as Steam.\n\nThere’s a problem here, though. And it’s that Anlife itself is such a cheerfully inconsequential thing that it’s hard to read too much of anything into it.\n\nAnlife promises players an evolution simulator where “AI-driven block creatures move in unexpected ways.” What this comes down to for the most part involves placing a range of different creatures into a small environment and then watching as they learn to get around.\n\nVisually Anlife is pure Frutiger Aero, offering landscapes of green valleys and sparkling water that could be the kind of soothing images MRI technicians sometimes encourage you to look at during a lengthy scan. Sonically it’s equally inoffensive: with a range of bloops, bleeps and popping sounds, we’re pitched right into the soundtrack of a million 00s day spas.\n\nThis desire to soothe permeates to the level of mechanics, too. Over the course of an idle morning with Anlife you can place a range of simple creatures in the environment and then give them food that will encourage them to breed or mutate. You can expand your territory and then lure creatures towards water or up into the air in order to create more variations. There are plenty of things to unlock (including a shadow tech tree that has you covered if you want to annihilate your digital sea monkeys rather than watching them flourish) but the ecosystem is kept simple. It’s a game about watching how things decide to crawl towards food.\n\nThe thrill of all of this presumably comes down to the “how” in that last sentence. This is where the game’s slightly mysterious use of AI is probably involved. And it’s true that, after a few hours of play, you’ll have Anlife’s funny little blob creatures exploring new kinds of joints and body arrangements as they swim and fly and generally roll around eating.\n\n(AI has a history of being used to make creatures walk around, incidentally, often using small neural networks and computer evolution. In 2009, the UK-based games technology company NaturalMotion developed a project in which a bipedal model learned to walk using evolved neural networks. The company was subsequently bought by Zynga in 2014.\n\nThere are two problems, however, the first being that the focus on unlocking the skill tree gives the opening hours of Anlife the feel of a rather mindless clicker game that it struggles to shake off. The second comes down to something that I gather people studying procedural generation sometimes refer to as “the oatmeal problem”.\n\nThe oatmeal problem, which was first formulated by writer, developer and academic Kate Compton, hinges on the fact that every single bowl of oatmeal in the universe is unique. Just not in a very interesting way. Similarly, when Anlife’s creatures discover a new way of rolling or bouncing or flapping their bodies towards food, they’re still just moving towards food. It makes for a game that’s either about really, really paying attention to tiny variations in detailing, or about completely zoning out and just enjoying the floaty aesthetic. Over the course of my time with Anlife, I’ve generally started with the first approach and then discovered, after 10 minutes, that I’ve slid into the second.\n\nThe more I played Anlife, the more I ended up thinking about something I heard from one of the first AI researchers I ever spoke to, all the way back in 2013. The real value of AI, they explained – and I am paraphrasing here – is that it could one day become a completely alien form of intelligence. Which means that us humans would have the lens of a different kind of mind through which to see ourselves and our quirks and cognitive fallacies – things that can be hard to spot when you’re talking to people who think in a very similar way to you.\n\nSince then the apparent focus for a lot of companies such as OpenAI seems to be completely the opposite: creating mimetic plagiarism machines that sometimes seem to exist only to tell people what they already want to hear.\n\nIt feels as if Anlife is filling a very small and specific niche. It isn’t trying to disguise its AI use, as far as I am aware. It’s actually trying to draw attention to the way it uses AI to allow its little creatures to move around. It’s not just a game born of AI, in other words. It’s a game that in some small way is actually about AI. It wants to be slightly alien. It doesn’t want to hide itself or ingratiate; it wants to examine AI’s innate capacity for otherness.",

    "description": "A former legal counsel for TikTok quit her job in 2023 to travel the world on a motorbike, seeking adventure and personal growth with her partner.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on an interview with Nerine Mak, a 33-year-old former senior commercial counsel for TikTok who's traveling the world on a motorbike. It has been edited for length and clarity\n\nI'm the eldest of five children. Our house was full of sibling squabbles, lots of negotiation, and mediation, which is probably why I joined the school debating team. A legal degree was a natural progression.\n\nI moved to Australia for college, then returned to Singapore, where I began working as a legal counsel at Ernst & Young in April 2017.\n\nEighteen months later, I became the regional legal counsel for Sephora. I'd only been there for nine months when, in July 2019, a TikTok recruiter approached me.\n\nI stayed at TikTok until I turned 30, when I quit to travel the world on a motorbike.\n\nI decided to go and meet them for interview practice. I knew TikTok was a social media app, but that was about it. When I found out that ByteDance was a major tech company with educational and B2B products, as well as TikTok, I was seriously impressed.\n\nI interviewed for a legal counsel role that'd support the revenue-generating business in Southeast Asia and Oceania. Within 48 hours, the recruiter called me to say I'd passed the first interview, and my second interview would be the next day.\n\nI started taking the process very seriously.\n\nMy first interview was with the hiring manager, then I was interviewed by three people from different business units, and finally, my last interview was with an HR member.\n\nI was still learning a lot at Sephora and wasn't ready to leave, but the opportunity at TikTok was just so appealing.\n\nWhen I told my parents I was going to work for TikTok, my dad didn't really have that much confidence in the company. Initially, I was nervous about the idea of joining, too, because when I asked about my specific job scope, it was still rather unknown.\n\nI received a welcome pack with backpacks, laptop bags, stickers, and stationery.\n\nAt the time, we were working in a coworking space. In my previous roles at Sephora and EY, we collaborated, but at TikTok, the collabs were more dynamic, frequent, and face-to-face.\n\nMy day-to-day involved more meetings, whereas in my earlier roles, independent work carried greater weight.\n\nEach day, I'd have meetings from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., then I'd still have up to three hours of work left before I finished for the day.\n\nThe most challenging year I had was 2021. One of my projects was to launch the TikTok Shop in Indonesia. It was the first to launch globally, so countries like the UK and the US saw my project as the blueprint.\n\nI burned out at least three times that year. Of course, it was very rewarding once launched and turned out to be very successful. My team grew to 10 lawyers, and we'd have weekly catch-ups on ByteDance's all-in-one platform, Lark.\n\nAt 23, I told myself I'd leave my job by 30 to pursue my own growth and discovery. I knew that traveling the world would give me the kind of life lessons my job couldn't give.\n\nAfter 18 months, I started playing around with the idea of van life. In March 2021, a friend referred me to a mechanic, Haren, whom he knew and who could share some car maintenance tips.\n\nHaren and I started dating and decided to travel together. Within three months, I decided to swap the van for a motorbike, and we agreed to leave our jobs and ride off-road bikes from Singapore to Europe.\n\nI left in November 2023. At first, they tried to talk me out of leaving, but I was transparent about my dream of exploring the world. We made sure we had a solid budget, so we didn't have to worry while traveling.\n\nTwo months before we were about to leave, my father said, \"I've bought a bike and Mummy and I are coming too.\" They decided to ride from Singapore to Germany and meet us on the way.\n\nHaren and I set off on January 20, 2024, at 5:30 a.m. I couldn't sleep the night before. When I woke up, my family prepared a farewell party, and our friends arrived on bikes to ride with us to the border.\n\nMy parents joined us on May 5, 2024, on the border of Laos and China. We traveled through China together and then met up again in Poland to travel through the Baltics before we rode to Norway. They're now back in Singapore.\n\nWe've now ridden off-road from Singapore through China and across Afghanistan.\n\nMy day involves leaving the guest house by 11 a.m., riding for two hours, and going sightseeing during our lunch hour. We usually stop riding just before sunset.\n\nWe try not to be rigid with our plans because a lot of the joy and surprises we get come from interacting with locals. They'll invite us into their homes for dinner or to their farms to ride on their horses.\n\nIt was a very promising role, but I knew I had to do this for myself. One of the biggest lessons I've learned is to be optimistic. Your closest people might have doubts about your plans, but you have to follow your heart.\n\nI've been taking on ad hoc legal work for friends who have small businesses. We plan to travel through February, then park our bikes for the next eight months due to family commitments. I'm also thinking of taking this opportunity to get either full-time or part-time legal work.\n\nI would still like to grow my legal skills. That would be a way to bring in income to fund future journeys as well. The freedom I get on two wheels is my passion and will stick with me for the rest of my life.",

    "fullText": "There is no GPS at the Red Planet, but a new technology called Mars Global Localization lets Perseverance determine precisely where it is — without human help.\n\nImagine you’re all alone, driving along in a rocky, unforgiving desert with no roads, no map, no GPS, and no more than one phone call a day for someone to inform you exactly where you are. That’s what NASA’s Perseverance rover has been experiencing since landing on Mars five years ago. Though it carries time-tested tools for determining its general location, the rover has needed operators on Earth to tell it precisely where it is — until now.\n\nA new technology developed at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California enables Perseverance to figure out its whereabouts without calling humans for help. Dubbed Mars Global Localization, the technology features an algorithm that rapidly compares panoramic images from the rover’s navigation cameras with onboard orbital terrain maps. Running on a powerful processor that Perseverance originally used to communicate with the Ingenuity Mars Helicopter, the algorithm takes about two minutes to pinpoint the rover’s location within some 10 inches (25 centimeters). Mars Global Localization was first used successfully in regular mission operations on Feb. 2, then again Feb. 16.\n\n“This is kind of like giving the rover GPS. Now it can determine its own location on Mars,” said JPL’s Vandi Verma, chief engineer of robotics operations for the mission. “It means the rover will be able to drive for much longer distances autonomously, so we’ll explore more of the planet and get more science. And it could be used by almost any other rover traveling fast and far.”\n\nThe upgrade is especially valuable given how well Perseverance’s auto-navigation self-driving system has been working. Enabling the rover to re-plan its path around obstacles en route to a preestablished destination, AutoNav has proved so capable that the distance Perseverance can drive without instructions from Earth is largely limited by the rover’s uncertainty about its whereabouts. Now that it can stop and determine its exact location, Perseverance can be commanded to drive to potentially unlimited distances without calling home.  Implementation of Mars Global Localization comes on the heels of another innovation from the Perseverance team: the first use of generative artificial intelligence to help plan a drive route by selecting waypoints for the rover, which are normally chosen by human rover operators. Both technologies enable Perseverance to travel farther and faster while minimizing team workload.\n\nUnlike on Earth, there is no network of GPS satellites in deep space to locate spacecraft on planetary surfaces. So missions — whether robotic or crewed — must come up with other ways to determine their location.\n\nAs with NASA’s previous Mars rovers, Perseverance tracks its position using what’s called visual odometry, analyzing geologic features in camera images taken every few feet while accounting for wheel slippage. But as tiny errors in the process add up over the course of each drive, the rover becomes increasingly unsure about its exact location. On long drives, the rover’s sense of its position can be off by more than 100 feet (up to 35 meters). Believing it may be too close to hazardous terrain, Perseverance may prematurely end its drive and wait for instructions from Earth.\n\n“Humans have to tell it, ‘You’re not lost, you’re safe. Keep going,’” Verma said. “We knew if we addressed this problem, the rover could travel much farther every day.”\n\nAfter each drive comes to a halt, the rover sends a 360-degree panorama to Earth, where mapping experts match the imagery with shots from NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO). The team then sends the rover its location and instructions for its next drive. That process can take a day or more, but with Mars Global Localization, the rover is able to compare the images itself, determine its location, and roll ahead on its preplanned route.\n\n“We’ve given the rover a new ability,” said Jeremy Nash, a JPL robotics engineer who led the team working on the project under Verma. “This has been an open problem in robotics research for decades, and it’s been super exciting to deploy this solution in space for the first time.”\n\nThe small team began working in 2023, testing the accuracy of the algorithm they’d developed using data from 264 previous rover stops. The algorithm compared rover panoramic photos to MRO imagery and correctly pinpointed the rover’s location for every single stop.\n\nKey to Mars Global Localization is the rover’s Helicopter Base Station (HBS), which Perseverance used to communicate with the now-retired Ingenuity Mars Helicopter. Equipped with a commercial processor that powered many consumer smartphones in the mid-2010s, the HBS runs more than 100 times faster than the rover’s two main computers, which, built to survive the radiation-heavy Martian environment, are based on hardware introduced in 1997.\n\nAs a technology demonstration designed to test capabilities, the Ingenuity mission was able to risk employing more powerful commercial chips in the HBS and the helicopter even though they hadn’t been proven in space. It paid off: Expected to fly no more than five times, the rotorcraft completed 72 flights.\n\nThe power of the HBS processor inspired Verma to look for ways the Perseverance mission might harness it. “It’s almost like a gift. Ingenuity blazed the trail, proving we could use commercial processors on Mars,” Verma said.\n\nTapping into the HBS computer has had its challenges. To address reliability, the team developed a “sanity check”: The algorithm runs on the HBS multiple times before one of the rover’s main computers checks to ensure the results match. During testing, the team repeatedly found the rover’s position was off by 1 millimeter. They discovered damage to about 25 bits — a minuscule fraction of the processor’s 1 gigabyte of memory — and developed a solution to isolate those bits while the algorithm runs.\n\nAlongside the broader Mars Global Localization process, the team’s sanity check and memory solutions are expected to find new uses as faster commercial processors are employed in future missions. In the meantime, the team has already turned their sights to the Moon, where difficult lighting conditions and long, cold lunar nights make knowing exactly where spacecraft are located all the more critical.\n\nNASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which is managed for the agency by Caltech, built and manages operations of the Perseverance rover on behalf of NASA’s Science Mission Directorate in Washington, as part of NASA’s Mars Exploration Program portfolio.\n\nTo learn more about Perseverance:\n\nhttps://science.nasa.gov/mission/mars-2020-perseverance\n\nMelissa Pamer / DC Agle \nJet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.\n626-314-4928 / 818-393-9011\nmelissa.pamer@jpl.nasa.gov / agle@jpl.nasa.gov\n\nKaren Fox / Molly Wasser\nNASA Headquarters, Washington\n202-358-1600\nkaren.c.fox@nasa.gov / molly.l.wasser@nasa.gov",
