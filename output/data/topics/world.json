    "fullText": "SYDNEY, N.S. — American netminder Bianca Birittieri made an incredible 38 saves, while linemates Emily Pohl and Lindsay Stepnowski scored in the first and second, to help lead the United States to a 2-0 gold medal victory Sunday night at U18 Women's Worlds in Nova Scotia — and not just any gold medal world championship win at that.\n\nThe Americans reclaimed gold medal bragging rights, marking their 10th title at the IIHF Under-18 Women's World Championship, and did so on Canadian ice, in front of a sold-out crowd of more than 5,000 fans at Centre 200 in Cape Breton Island.\n\nNot only did they fight against a sea of red and white spectators and a strong, skilled Canadian squad, but according to the International Ice Hockey Federation, this American contingent is the first national under-18 team to ever win \"perfect gold\" at U18 Women's Worlds, which means the stripes and stars squad never trailed an opponent and were never tied throughout the entire week-and-a-half-long international tournament.\n\nThis was a history-making world championship.\n\nThe U.S. coaching staff told its team to \"do the same thing we've been doing,\" Pohl said to media of the stick-to-habits message she and her teammates followed throughout the tournament, since it proved so successful, and ultimately \"perfect\" in the IIHF stats.\n\n\"Obviously, I think we did it well,\" Pohl said, a big smile on her face and a gold medal wrapped around her neck, teammates Taila Hansen and Birittieri at her side.\n\n\"We just played fast, re-loaded(ed) pucks and just worked our hearts out,\" added Hansen, whose smile matched her teammates and message echoed what head coach Courtney Kennedy told media after the game.\n\n\"They've been training and buying in every day, all the time,\" said Kennedy, whose lineage hails from Glace Bay on Cape Breton Island in Nova Scotia, slight tears forming in her eyes as she spoke of her late grandmother and family from the host province for the world championship.\n\n\"We were kind of hard on them in terms of trying to understand the system,\" Kennedy said. \"It's not a crazy system — it's literally play from your heart and play for each other, and they chose to do that, and... watching them today, they chose time and time again to play the right way.\"\n\nBut truth be told, while earlier tournament games featured large gaps between teams, in particular between the top two North American squads and their opponents, this gold medal game could have gone either way, with one single play able to make the difference at any time. As women's hockey followers know, this is par for the course between the long-time rivals.\n\nAs for starting Birittieri in the crease Sunday, \"there were saves she made that just stole the momentum... and you can just take the wind out of the sails of a team, and you need that, \" Kennedy said of why she picked her for the gold medal game.\n\n\"There's one save, one save in a game that can almost put the nail in the coffin, and she made that one save; I want to say it was on Milani on that left side, I was like, 'wow,' and you could just feel it,\" Kennedy said.\n\n\"Because that Canada team is incredibly talented and they did nothing but play their hearts out, too,\" she said.\n\nAs for Brittieri, \"it's always an hounour to wear the jersey, and to get the chance to play in the gold medal game and get the win is just incredible,\" the humbl goalie told reporters, flanked by Hansen, Pohl and their gold medals.\n\nBoth sides of the border stepped onto the ice Sunday night prepared, but Pohl's goal came early at 14:08 in the first on an assist from Hansen, and that set an intense but winning pace for the United States.\n\n\"She executed it perfectly; I just had to tap it in,\" Pohl said of the opening the scoring with help from her linemate.\n\n\"I was going up to the dot and was like what are we going to do,\" Hansen said of her assist. \"I was going to (put it back)... but then I was like, 'no, go forward,' and it worked out.\"\n\nHansen also helped out on Stepnowski's goal at 18:17 in the second period to seal the deal for the Americans, who were able to hold Canada's determined offence at bay through the remainder of the game despite the red and white crashing the net, pulling netminder Lea-Rose Charrois for 11 seconds late in the third in an attempt to create a scoring chance, and a much-needed timeout to strategize a potential late-game comeback — which is always possible when Canada and the United States face off.\n\nFor her part, Lea-Rose Charrois made 25 saves to help keep Canada in the game.\n\n\"We started really strong,\" Canadian head coach Vicky Sunohara said in the mixed zone. \"The skating, puck in deep, the forechecking. I thought we had opportunities, but we didn't bury the puck ,and there were times when we shot when we didn't have anybody driving the net, and gave their goalie confidence; didn't really challenge her.\n\n\"I think for the most part, though, you get one in and it could change the momentum,\" Sunohara agreed with a single play potentially changing the game.\n\n\"I thought we gave it everything we had; they're a very good team and they worked hard for 60 minutes, so I'm not taking anything away from them.\"\n\n\"I think as a group we did reallly well,\" agreed Canadian captain Hayley McDonald, a silver medal around her neck despite a tear-stained face.\n\n\"It's truly an honour to play not just for your country, but on home turf, and having this game sold out is amazing,\" she said.\n\nBut Canada's best efforts couldn't stop the U.S. from its \"perfect gold\" at the 2026 rematch of U18 worlds past.\n\nThe IIHF also handed out its individual awards after Sunday's gold medal game, with 16-year-old American forward Jane Daley of Medfield, Mass., winning most valuable player for her 12 goals and oustanding offence on behalf of the world champions.\n\nLeading the All-Star Team, which was voted on by accredited media attending the event, she was joined by American captain and defender Margaret Averill, along with Canadian forwards Adrianna Milani and Sofia Ismael, as well as red and white blueliner Megan Mossey.\n\nTop goalie honours went to Switzerland's Norina Schrupowski, who made 149 saves on a whopping 159 shots to post an impressive 93.71 save percentage over 227 minutes between the crease, according to IIHF official stats.\n\nThe IIHF Directorate also handed out awards, including Best Goalkeeper to Schrupowski, Best Defender to Averill and Best Forward to Daley.\n\n\"USA Hockey has a really high standard and they recruit the best players,\" Hansen said of the philopshy behind the American road to gold, which could set the standard for what happens on the ice at the 2026 Olympic Winter Games in Milano, Italy.\n\n\"The coaches, the staff, everyone,\" she said. \"I think just buying into what they say and doing it for each other, they really preach that, doing it for the teammate next to you, holding that rope for them... that kind of sets the standard, and everyone knows that at all levels.\"",

    "fullText": "Despite leaving Liverpool as one of the most highly regarded coaches in world football in 2024, Jurgen Klopp said he never thought of himself as amongst the game's best.\n\n\"I never considered myself a world-class coach,\" Klopp told AFP and other media in an interview in Leipzig, \"because I still had so many questions when I finished.\"\n\n\"I was like 'how can I be world-class with these questions still?'\"\n\nAfter starting out at Mainz, where he took the club to the top flight for the first time, Klopp moved to Borussia Dortmund, where he won two Bundesliga titles and reached the 2013 Champions League final.\n\nAfter signing with Liverpool in 2015, Klopp's Reds won every trophy on offer, including the Champions League and Premier League.\n\nIn his new role as Red Bull's global head of football, where he oversees a multi-club structure with teams including RB Leipzig, New York Red Bulls and Paris FC, Klopp said that he wants to help coaches answer those questions.\n\n\"My role with the coaches is to be the guy I never had. I sat in my office very, very, very often, very, very, very alone.\n\n\"A lot of people gave me advice and have great ideas... It's great to have ideas, but it's really not that easy to make the final decision.\n\n\"I want to be in moments when I know they are alone, or feel alone. I want to be there.\"\n\nKlopp oversaw the firing of then-Leipzig coach Marco Rose, a long-time friend, in 2025 and said that being on the other side felt odd.\n\n\"Grave-digger of the coaches -- that's a title I never wanted to win!\"\n\n- 'I never watch the goals back' -\n\nFrom taking Mainz to the Bundesliga to breaking Liverpool's Premier League drought, Klopp improved clubs and players wherever he went.\n\nOften taking over with teams at a low ebb, the coach would try and put things in perspective.\n\n\"How did I start a game? I would say 'the worst news is you can lose it' -- so let's try and win it... Do not try to avoid defeat -- try to win.\"\n\nThe coach said he told his players: \"Giving your all doesn't mean you will get anything, but it's your only chance to get something. That's pretty much how you do it.\n\n\"We gave everything -- and sometimes we got something.\"\n\nKlopp said that media and fans were too focused on results.\n\n\"I never watch the goals back, because I want to understand the game to the left and the right of the result.\n\n\"I want to understand why it happened... Results are the result of the performance. So we worked on the performance and the results came later.\"\n\nThe 58-year-old said that he \"didn't take any pride\" out of trophy ceremonies and parades.\n\n\"I love being a part of it, not in the middle of it. You might see pictures where someone gave me a trophy and I'd take it, but I didn't need to touch it.\n\n\"For me, it was the journey that I loved. That gave me much more than the moment (of winning).\"\n\n- 'You know if Jurgen Klopp is in the room' -\n\nKlopp retains cult-like status at his former clubs, with fans remembering the German for his sideline antics and everyman appeal as much as his successes.\n\nRB Leipzig sporting director Marcel Schaefer told AFP that Klopp has brought the same presence into his new role, even if he is no longer on the sideline.\n\n\"He has something that is unique. He has a god-given talent which everyone knows from his coaching jobs.\n\n\"He can catch people in five to 10 minutes.\"\n\nSchaefer said that Klopp plays an important role in player recruitment by \"talking to families, talking to players about our vision, about our project.\n\n\"You know if Jurgen Klopp is in the room.\"\n\nSince stepping down at Anfield, Klopp has been linked to an array of high-profile coaching jobs, but said that a return to the dugout is unlikely.\n\n\"I don't expect to change my mind, but I don't know.\n\n\"We're building a house right now and my missus wanted to have a really big trophy room. There was another small room and I said 'this is enough, because we know how many trophies we have, we will not add any'.\n\n\"It might sound arrogant, but I know I can coach a football team. But I don't need to do it until my last day.\"",

    "fullText": "China is now a key market for global carmakers, and, surprisingly, buyers there are shifting back to sedans that offer serious tech. Automakers are pushing boundaries to get noticed, and Nissan is one of them. The brand launched two new electrified sedans and a refreshed Teana late last year – the latter being the more premium take on the Altima sold in the US.\n\nThe new Teana, built by Dongfeng Nissan, puts a big emphasis on tech and interior quality. It looks a class above what you’d expect from an Altima-based sedan. Part of that comes from a glowing AI speaker on the dash, but the real surprise is the material choice. Nissan worked with Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation (MCC) to use Durabio, a plant-based plastic that looks and feels closer to crystal than the usual trim.\n\nIn China, buyers care about big screens, lighting, and how upscale a car feels. The Teana’s interior is built to make a strong first impression, and it stands out even more when you see it lit up at night.\n\nDurabio is more than just a marketing fluff. MCC developed it as a bio-based plastic using plant-derived isosorbide. It’s clearer and handles light better than regular polycarbonate, which helps create lighting that looks deep and high-end instead of cheap or artificial.\n\nOn the Teana, Durabio is used for the inverted-pyramid AI speaker that lights up with six pillars glowing in up to 256 colors. The material refracts light cleanly, giving it a crystal-like look without needing a clear coat. That saves manufacturing steps, lowers environmental footprint, and still meets automotive durability standards.\n\nTeana runs a Huawei-based operating system to go with Durabio. The end result is an interior that feels modern and thoughtfully put together (at least visually), not just a quick update.\n\nMeanwhile, the US-market Altima heads into 2026 with almost no changes from last year. It remains affordable and practical, but next to the Teana, it comes across as very restrained. Nissan still sells a lot of sedans in the US, with over 255,000 units last year (out of the brand's over 760,000-unit sales), but the Altima’s own sales dropped to 93,268 in 2025, down 18 percent from the year before.\n\nThat drop probably comes from the Altima’s age. The current model dates back to 2018, with its last big update in 2022. It no longer stands out for design or interior appeal. After seeing what Nissan has done with the Teana, it’s fair to ask (hope, even) if a more upscale, more distinctive Altima could bring buyers back to the midsize sedan segment.\n\nFor now, there’s no clear answer. But with China getting the more ambitious upgrades, it’s easy to see how a bit of that Durabio-inspired thinking could only help the Altima.\n\nView the 9 images of this gallery on the original article",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Republican lawmakers are scrambling to contain President Donald Trump's threats of taking possession of Greenland, with some showing the most strident opposition to almost anything the Trump administration has done since taking office.\n\nThey gave floor speeches on the importance of NATO last week. They introduced bills meant to prevent the U.S. from attacking Denmark. And several traveled to Copenhagen to meet with Danish counterparts.\n\nBut it's not clear that will be enough, as the president continues to insist that he will take control of the Arctic island. It's raised fears of an end to NATO — a decades-old alliance that has been a pillar of American strength in Europe and around the globe — and raised questions on Capitol Hill and around the world about what Trump's aggressive, go-it-alone foreign policy will mean for world order.\n\n“When the most powerful military nation on earth threatens your territory through its president over and over and over again, you start to take it seriously,” Sen. Chris Coons told The Associated Press.\n\nThe Delaware Democrat organized the bipartisan trip to Denmark to “bring the temperature down a bit,” he said, as well as further talks about mutual military agreements in the Arctic. Republican Sens. Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska accompanied a handful of Democrats on the trip. Also, Republican lawmakers joined in meetings in Washington last week with the Danish foreign minister and his Greenlandic counterpart where they discussed security agreements.\n\nYet it's clear Trump has other ideas. He said Saturday he will charge a 10% import tax starting in February on goods from eight European nations because of their opposition to his Greenland plans.\n\nTrump said on social media that because of modern weapons systems “the need to ACQUIRE is especially important.”\n\nThe pushback to Trump's Greenland plans\n\nKey Republicans have made clear they think that forcefully taking Greenland is out of the question. But so far, they've avoided directly rebuking Trump for his talk of possessing the island.\n\nTillis on social media called Trumps tariff plans “bad for America, bad for American businesses, and bad for America’s allies.”\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., told reporters Thursday that “there’s certainly not an appetite here for some of the options that have been talked about or considered.”\n\nIn a floor speech, Thune's predecessor as Republican leader, Sen. Mitch McConnell, warned that an attempt to seize Greenland would “shatter the trust of allies\" and tarnish Trump's legacy with a disastrous foreign policy decision.\n\nRepublican and Democratic lawmakers alike see an obvious path to bolstering American interests in Greenland while keeping the relationship with NATO-ally Denmark intact.\n\nIn a meeting with lawmakers Thursday, Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen and his Greenlandic counterpart Vivian Motzfeldt discussed how the countries could work together to develop critical mineral industries and military cooperation, Coons said. The diplomats also told the senators there is no evidence of Chinese or Russian activity in Greenland.\n\nTrump has made the argument that the U.S. should take Greenland before China or Russia do, prompting worry across Europe. Troops from several nations have been sent to Greenland in support of Denmark.\n\nMurkowski said on social media that “our NATO allies are being forced to divert attention and resources to Greenland, a dynamic that plays directly into Putin’s hands by threatening the stability of the strongest coalition of democracies the world has ever seen.”\n\nLawmakers are looking at a few options for taking a military attack on Greenland off the table. Still, the Trump administration has shown little if any willingness to get congressional approval before taking military action.\n\nLawmakers, including Republicans like Murkowski, are pushing legislation that would prohibit Department of Defense funds from being used to attack or occupy territory that belongs to other NATO members without their consent.\n\nThe Alaska senator also suggested Congress could act to nullify Trump's tariffs. Murkowski and several other Republicans have already helped pass resolutions last year meant to undo tariffs around the globe, but those pieces of legislation did not gain traction in the House. They would have also required Trump's signature or support from two-thirds of both chambers to override his veto.\n\nDemocrats have also found some traction with war powers resolutions meant to force the president to get congressional approval before engaging in hostilities. Republicans last week narrowly defeated one such resolution that would prohibit Trump from attacking Venezuela again, and Democrats think there could potentially be more Republicans who would support one applying to Greenland.\n\n“What I’ve noticed is these war powers resolutions, they do put some pressure on Republicans,” said Sen. Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat who has forced votes on several similar resolutions. He said the tactic has also compelled the Trump administration to provide lawmakers with briefings and commitments to get congressional approval before deploying troops.\n\nStill, while dismissing the Venezuela war powers resolution on Wednesday, Republican leaders made the argument that the legislation should be ruled out of order because the Trump administration has said there are currently no U.S. troops on the ground in Venezuela.\n\nThat argument may set a precedent for future war powers resolutions, giving Republicans a way to avoid voting against Trump's wishes.\n\n“If you don't have boots on the ground, it's a moot point,” said Sen. Mike Rounds, a South Dakota Republican, about war powers resolutions in general. He also argued that the prospect of taking Greenland over the objections of Denmark is nothing \"more than a hypothetical.”\n\nOther Republicans have expressed support for Trump's insistence that the U.S. possess Greenland, though they have downplayed the idea that the U.S. would take it by force.\n\nThat's left the strongest objections on the Republican side of the aisle coming from a handful of lawmakers who are leaving Congress next year.\n\nRep. Don Bacon, a Nebraska Republican, told The Omaha World Herald that an invasion of Greenland would lead to Trump's impeachment — something he would “lean” towards supporting.\n\nTillis, another retiring Republican, has directed his criticism at Trump advisors like White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller.\n\n“The fact that a small handful of ‘advisors’ are actively pushing for coercive action to seize territory of an ally is beyond stupid,” he said.",

    "fullText": "Braves $38M clubhouse leader, Gold Glove winner, World Series champion could retire after 2026 season originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Atlanta Braves have done fairly well this offseason, with most of their major moves coming early. However, if there is one area where the Braves can still improve, it is the starting rotation. Braves GM Alex Anthopoulos isn’t just looking for any starter — he wants someone capable of starting a playoff game in October.\n\n“We’ve explored the starting rotation, adding and getting some type of starter, whether that’s trade or signing. We’d like for it to be someone impactful, someone we think can start a playoff game,” Anthopoulos said.\n\nThe Braves are usually known for having a strong rotation, but last season was different as injuries piled up throughout the year. Looking ahead to 2026, the rotation appears to be in good shape, but it’s the years beyond that where things get interesting for Atlanta.\n\n“Beyond Spencer Strider and Spencer Schwellenbach, there are no clear locks for the Atlanta Braves rotation beyond 2026,’” HTHB’s Chase Owens wrote.\n\nOne big name to monitor beyond this season is veteran Chris Sale. With Sale nearing his 40s, it will be interesting to see how he evaluates where he is in his career once the season concludes. HTHB’s Steven Teal believes Sale could be done with baseball if he has a strong 2026 campaign.\n\n“As far as his health goes, Atlanta's training staff, along with Sale making some lifestyle changes, has helped keep him on the field successfully. As mentioned above, his rib injury was just a freak thing as he made a great diving play against the Mets, hoping for a complete game. Had that injury not occurred, Sale would have likely completed the season and thrown over 170 innings again. There's no reason to believe he won't be as good this season for the Braves. If he pitches well enough, he could complete his career,” Teal wrote.\n\nWhile losing Sale would undoubtedly hurt, the veteran starter has put together an outstanding career and has little left to prove. During his time with the Braves, he has largely silenced critics who labeled him as injury-prone.\n\nSale has also been a valuable mentor in the clubhouse and within the pitching staff, but there is a real possibility that this season could be the end of the line for him. If so, the Braves may soon be saying goodbye to one of their most respected clubhouse leaders.",

    "description": "Times journalists got a rare look inside one of the compounds where the online fraud industry makes its billions. Inspirational slogans (“Keep going”) were just the start.",
    "fullText": "Reporting from Min Let Pan, Myanmar\n\nIn a Southeast Asian war zone, cloaked in dense rainforest, the Chinese settlement dedicated to scamming people from Kentucky to Kazakhstan grew fast on fertile ground.\n\nOver just a few months, a sprawling office park materialized and metastasized in the chaotic borderlands of Myanmar, with cavernous rooms holding rows of computer monitors and walls decorated with inspirational work slogans: “Dream chaser,” “Keep going,” “Making money matters the most.” In video conference suites, bookshelves stocked with fake business tomes and ersatz modern art simulated the kind of boardroom a successful crypto investor might inhabit.\n\nThe scam center, Shunda Park, opened for business in 2024 with more than 3,500 workers from nearly 30 nations, including Namibia, Russia, Zimbabwe and France. Some had been kidnapped and enslaved, but all had become skilled in the art of the online grift. When the scammers bilked $5,000 out of someone, they struck a Chinese gong. A $50,000 shakedown earned a celebratory pounding of a giant drum, then an offering to a Chinese deity resplendent in his golden altar.\n\nWhile each nationality required a different approach — for Americans, one scammer told me, the preferred mark was “white old men” — the general approach was the same: an online foray by a sympathetic and attractive person, followed by an invitation to participate in a select investment opportunity.\n\nVictims were not just lonely hearts or technologically timid retirees. Using generative intelligence and deepfake videos, as well as fraudulent businesses, websites and financial apps, the scammers at Shunda embraced the long con and reeled in people from almost every demographic.\n\nBut in late November, Shunda Park was unexpectedly captured by a rebel force long at odds with the Myanmar military, whose coup nearly five years ago catapulted this Southeast Asian nation into civil war and created a chaotic space for criminality to thrive. The photographer Jes Aznar and I were granted rare access to the scam compound to document the inner sanctum of this secretive, highly fortified industry. Shunda Park had been closed for business by the rebel militia, but we were able to meet some of its scammers, both those who were trying to return home and others who wanted to find another job in the fraud business.\n\nWith millions of people falling victim to online shakedowns every year, the cyberscamming industry has quickly grown into one of the planet’s most lucrative criminal enterprises, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.\n\nIn the United States alone, in 2024, at least $10 billion was stolen through cyberscams run out of Southeast Asia, the U.S. Treasury Department said. That figure is likely only a fraction of the true toll because victims are often too embarrassed to admit they have been fooled. Late last year, the United States formed its first ever federal task force to combat scam centers and the Chinese transnational crime networks that American investigators say run them.\n\nThe Myanmar junta, which has imprisoned members of an elected government and killed thousands of civilians, recently vowed to tackle the scam networks. But its current crackdown feels like a Potemkin exercise. The global profits from online cons rival the gross domestic products of the countries where the fraud factories have proliferated, including Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos.\n\nThese illicit proceeds do not just line the pockets of the gangs, most of which are originally from China; dirty money also flows to powerful elites across the region — most of all, crime-watchers say, to powerful people in the conflict-ridden, failed state of Myanmar.\n\nOur journey to Shunda Park occurred during what was supposed to be a lull in the fighting between the Myanmar military and the opposition militia, known as the Karen National Liberation Army. (The Karen, pronounced Kuh-REN, are one of Myanmar’s many ethnic groups that have been persecuted by the military for generations.)\n\nWhat we discovered inside Shunda Park’s thick walls ringed by razor wire resembled a set for an apocalyptic film. Amid white office blocks, Chinese restaurants and luxury villas reserved for the compound’s Chinese bosses, bonfires burned, consuming the tools of the illicit economy. Piles of electronic equipment — keyboards, tangles of cables and thousands of cellphones — littered the site. In some buildings, with nearly every step I took, I crunched on SIM cards, scattered like snow in the tropical heat.\n\nWhile members of the Karen militia handed over armfuls of evidence to the police in Thailand, along with a man identified as the compound’s Chinese boss, no representatives of foreign governments or intelligence agencies have come to Shunda Park to investigate. Now, the fighting has intensified, and all of Shunda Park’s workers have scattered. Other proof of scamming has gone up in flames.\n\n“We are trying our best, but we are not scam experts,” said Padoh Saw Taw Nee, the spokesman for the K.N.L.A.’s political wing, as he leafed through a notebook with instructions on how to cheat middle-aged women in Taiwan. “We do not like that our land is known as the place where criminals cheat people.”\n\nThe layers of victimhood at a place like Shunda Park are complex. Many of the scammers who worked here say they were duped, too. They arrived in neighboring Thailand, thinking they had been hired for well-paying tech or marketing jobs. Others thought they were checking out merchandise for online sales businesses. Instead, they were hustled at gunpoint across the river that demarcates the border with Myanmar.\n\nI spoke with several scammers whose bodies bore scars from beatings or tight shackles. They never received payment for their 12-hour shifts, they said. Life was a Sisyphean loop: sleep, eat, scam, eat, sleep, scam.\n\nKason, a 22-year-old from Malaysia who is being identified only by his first name, said he suffered only two “hard” beatings. But his legs and torso were crisscrossed with traces of lacerations from what he called “many, many” smaller beatings.\n\nHis job for more than a year was to send endless “hellos” into the social media ether. If he did not receive responses from at least 5 percent of the greetings, then he would be punished physically, he said.\n\nIvan, a Malaysian who once worked as a member of the ground staff at the Singapore airport, said he was chained in a crucifixion position and denied food for days.\n\n“You think you know hell,” he said, “and it’s actually even worse.”\n\nIn one of the Shunda Park workrooms, bobblehead dolls and fake gold bars enlivened the space. At the front, near a statue of a Chinese god worshiped by the gangsters, were three port-a-potty style boxes that scammers said were used as punishment chambers, in clear sight of the rest of the room. Elsewhere in the compound, behind a barbecue restaurant, a row of cement torture cells was outfitted with bars and shackles.\n\nNot all the workers at Shunda landed there unwillingly. Many of the Chinese employees at Shunda Park received salaries, a review of records in one finance office shows. A company called Huisheng International, for instance, had stacks of wage receipts, sick-leave forms and medical tests for H.I.V. and syphilis, among other diseases, all written in Chinese. Employees were identified by nicknames like “Eastern Dragon” or “Little Li.” Contracts in the office specified that workers would be bound by Myanmar labor law.\n\nWhile most of the workers at Shunda Park were transported to safety via Thailand, about 900 Chinese workers refused to leave for more than two weeks, despite the compound being in the middle of an active conflict zone. The Chinese government has periodically cracked down on the scamming industry, arresting Chinese workers who are repatriated. So tense was the situation that days before our visit, some Chinese workers had tried unsuccessfully to wrestle weapons away from the Karen soldiers, according to members of the militia and other scammers who witnessed the melee.\n\nAll but one Chinese man at the compound refused to speak with me. The scammers shielded their faces with their hands or with masks. The one worker who agreed to talk said he had been promised a salary of 30,000 yuan a month, or $4,250. But upon arriving, he said, he only received 30,000 Thai baht a month, or $940. Records in the finance office showed base salaries of that amount.\n\n“They tricked me,” he said of his employers. The boom of shelling punctuated our conversation.\n\nAround him, rotten food festered. On the basketball court and by a nightclub, fires smoldered. A French bulldog that used to be cared for by one of the compound’s Chinese managers padded by, before collapsing in the shade provided by a luxury sedan. The cars on site came from all over Myanmar, including a fire department vehicle from halfway across the country. There was also an oil tanker truck with Chinese license plates.\n\nThe Myanmar military appears determined to reclaim Shunda Park, even as it dynamites buildings in other scam centers to show it is tough on crime. Workers at those raided sites, also run by Chinese criminal networks, however, say the crackdowns are just for show. In fact, some of the workers at Shunda said they had just arrived from these cleared out compounds. With international sanctions biting, Myanmar’s generals, supported by business allies and sympathetic militias, have embraced various illicit economies, making the country a global crime capital.\n\nOutside the scam compounds, life is impoverished and insecure. The Myanmar military regularly launches airstrikes around Shunda Park, and across the rest of the country, targeting civilians. More than 3.5 million people nationwide are now displaced.\n\nAs the shelling intensified, we climbed into pickup trucks and sped away. Our driver, the commander of the K.N.L.A.’s special forces, varied his speed to ward off the suicide drones that terrorize the area’s roads. A few days before, an armed drone detonated a bus length away from one of the trucks.\n\nIn the next village, in an area where an ethnic armed group aligned with the junta had held sway, I spotted more neat rows of scam centers being built, Chinese red lanterns hanging from the eaves. Chinese workers wandered through the construction site, shirts off in the heat.\n\nA few days later, the 900 or so Chinese workers left Shunda. Some went over the border to Thailand. But most headed to other Chinese compounds in the wilds of Myanmar, where scammers are busy finding their next victims.\n\nBerry Wang contributed research.",

    "description": "After selling my longtime home at nearly 70, I paid off debt, traveled the world, and rediscovered confidence and creativity.",
    "fullText": "At almost 70, with my son grown and building his own creative life, I realized the home I had poured myself into for two decades no longer supported the future I wanted.\n\nFor almost 20 years, that house looked like the picture of stability. Teal doors, a tire swing, and a sunny studio beside the garage. It was where I raised my son as a single mother and built my photography career. Most people assumed I would stay there forever.\n\nBut when my son graduated and moved to Orlando, something shifted. I had spent years encouraging him to live the life he wanted. Suddenly, I realized I needed to do the same.\n\nBehind the postcard charm, a truth emerged. The house no longer supported my future. What once felt like a comfortable sanctuary had become a moneypit, its growing debt reminding me daily that I could not afford the life or the freedom I wanted. I had built a home to raise a confident and independent child, and I had done that, but holding on to the house was keeping me from evolving into the next chapter of my life, a chapter filled with creative possibilities that debt made impossible to pursue.\n\nSorting through the rooms, I noticed how little the objects mattered. It was never the things, only the memories. And memories do not require storage space. I photographed what mattered, donated most of the rest, and watched the remnants of my old life line the curb. Letting go gave me breathing room for the first time in years. I could imagine what came next.\n\nSelling the house gave me the financial and emotional space to address something I had avoided for years. I needed extensive dental work, and with missing teeth, I no longer felt confident in my own smile. As a photographer, I had spent decades coaxing others to relax while I avoided the lens myself.\n\nI trusted a cosmetic dentist in southern Brazil, the parent of an exchange student I once hosted, and the cost was far more realistic than in the United States. After surgery and the initial healing, I traveled to Rio. For the first time in years, I felt free to focus my lens and smile at the world around me without hesitation.\n\nThe physical and financial weight I had carried for years began to lift. Brazil restored my confidence and reminded me that reinvention was still possible.\n\nBefore selling my house, I had researched ways to travel while working. A friend hosted dinners as a sommelier on cruise ships, and my algorithm kept suggesting photography jobs at sea. I applied to a few with curiosity.\n\nWhile I was still in Rio, the call came. I was offered a contract as the master photographer on a premium luxury cruise line, a role that would take me across multiple continents. To qualify, I needed a Seafarer Certificate, which at my age required extensive medical tests and functional exams. It was humbling, but I passed.\n\nI was notified with less than a week to prepare that my contract would start in Sydney. After a 31-hour flight, knowing I would board within 24 hours, I dropped my bags at the hotel and walked the waterfront from Darling Harbor to the Opera House. A mist hung in the air, turning the city into a soft shimmer through my lens.\n\nLife at sea was a study in contrasts. I photographed in a studio on the 15th floor but slept far below in a windowless cabin. I climbed endless flights of stairs each day. The ancient programs, cameras, and equipment made my days long and tedious. But above deck, the ocean made everything worth it. An unobstructed sunset on open water can shift your entire mood. Each time we reached a new port, the world opened again. My creative mojo began to gel for the first time in a long while, and I realized I was able to absorb so much only because I had let go of so much.\n\nIn six months, I had visited three continents, become healthier than I had been in years, and for the first time in decades, my smile came without hesitation. My financial responsibilities felt lighter, and the spark I had been missing finally came back after years of accumulating belongings and obligations that had kept me anchored when I was ready to sail into another chapter filled with creativity.\n\nWhile recovering in Miami from an injury, I received another unexpected call. An apartment had become available in the Asbury Park building where I had applied years earlier. It had an ocean view, a community of artists and musicians, and a rent I could actually afford. It felt like the universe was giving me the chance to finally act on my hopes and creativity.\n\nI had let go of everything that once held me back. What I gained was freedom, the freedom to create, to travel, and to smile freely again, with my camera as my ticket forward.",

It's about a two-hour drive away from the Alpine town, but the wealthiest people will travel by helicopter instead.\n\nThe airport estimated there will be an extra 1,000 takeoffs and landings during the conference, with some landing after its typically strict curfew of 11:30 p.m. Zurich Airport is also extending the opening hours for an observation deck for planespotters and other aviation enthusiasts.\n\nOthers fly into Germany's Friedrichshafen Airport, a Jetspy spokesperson told Business Insider.\n\nThe jets will be a parade of some of the most expensive on the market.\n\nMany opt for the Gulfstream G650, which costs tens of millions and was the transport of choice for attendees like Gates, Louis Bacon, and executives from BlackRock and Goldman Sachs last year.

    "fullText": "The Africa Cup of Nations reaches its climax on Sunday with a showdown between host nation Morocco, looking to win the title for the first time in 50 years, and Sadio Mane's powerful Senegal side.\n\nThe final kicks off at 1900 GMT at the Prince Moulay Abdellah Stadium in Rabat, where almost all the 69,000 spectators will be backing Morocco, captained by African player of the year Achraf Hakimi.\n\nThe first AFCON ever to start in one year and end in another could be the second in a row to be won by the host nation, with the Atlas Lions aiming to follow in the footsteps of Ivory Coast, crowned champions on home soil in 2024.\n\nWalid Regragui's Morocco have established themselves in recent years as Africa's pre-eminent national team, becoming the first from the continent to reach a World Cup semi-final, in 2022, and climbing to 11th place in the world rankings.\n\nHowever, they have long been AFCON underachievers, with their only title to date coming in 1976. This will be their first final since 2004, when they lost to Tunisia when Regragui was part of the team.\n\nSenegal, meanwhile, are appearing in their third final in four editions and are targeting a second title to follow their 2022 triumph, when Mane scored the decisive shoot-out penalty against Egypt in Yaounde.\n\n\"We dreamt of being here and now we have done it,\" Regragui told reporters on Saturday.\n\nHe has been under suffocating pressure to deliver the title for the football-mad nation, and would possibly not have kept his job through to the approaching World Cup in North America had he not reached the final.\n\n\"I hope this is just the beginning and not our last AFCON final,\" he added.\n\n\"Big football nations want to be up there on a regular basis. Tomorrow we want to try to make history.\"\n\nHe added: \"Senegal will need to be really strong to beat us at home, although they are capable.\"\n\nMorocco's success over the last four weeks has been based around the attacking threat of Real Madrid winger Brahim Diaz, the tournament's top scorer with five goals, and a defence which has conceded only once.\n\nBeing at home brings extra pressure, but can also be a huge advantage, and Senegal have complained about the conditions in which they were welcomed to Rabat ahead of the game.\n\nThe Lions of Teranga were based in the northern port city of Tangiers until they arrived in Rabat by train on Friday.\n\nThe Senegalese Football Federation complained about a \"lack of adequate security\" for the team's arrival amid a crowd of fans \"which put the players and staff at risk\".\n\nIt also complained about their hotel, the fact that their supporters were given fewer than 3,000 tickets for the final, and about being asked to train at the Moroccan team's base in nearby Sale.\n\n\"What happened was not normal,\" said Senegal coach Pape Thiaw.\n\n\"Given the number there, anything could have happened. My players could have been in danger.\n\n\"That type of thing should not happen between two brother countries.\"\n\nMane, a two-time winner of the African player of the year award, said after netting the winner in the semi-final against Egypt that Sunday's game would be his last ever AFCON appearance.\n\nBut Thiaw insisted on the eve of the game that the former Liverpool forward may have to rethink that decision.\n\n\"I think he made his decision in the heat of the moment and the country does not agree, and I as coach of the national team do not agree,\" said Thiaw.\n\n\"We would like to keep him for as long as possible,\" added the coach, who is without centre-back and captain Kalidou Koulibaly due to suspension.\n\nOff the pitch this edition of Africa's premier sports event has demonstrated that Morocco is determined to be a successful co-host of the 2030 World Cup.\n\nThe tournament has been free of the problems that have plagued earlier AFCONs, the stadiums and pitches have generally been of a high quality and high-speed rail links show a country significantly upgrading its infrastructure.",

    "fullText": "UK gas prices don't form in isolation - they're the result of a global system where LNG tankers move molecules across oceans, storage facilities buffer seasonal demand swings, and physical constraints create friction that simple supply-demand models miss.\n\nThis guide explains the infrastructure and economics that connect US shale production to UK power plants. You'll learn how LNG shipping works, why UK gas prices track Henry Hub (Louisiana) with a 6-8 week lag, and how traders calculate netback prices to decide whether exporting US gas to Europe is profitable. You'll see why LNG is the flexible marginal source while Norwegian pipelines provide inflexible baseload, and how charter rate volatility (which spiked 5x in 2025) can turn a profitable cargo into a loss overnight.\n\nThe guide also covers the UK's structural vulnerability: storage capacity below 2% of annual demand (versus 20% in continental Europe). You'll understand why this makes UK prices volatile, how storage arbitrage works (and why most seasonal spreads don't cover storage costs), and why NBP can decouple from TTF despite physical interconnection - a basis risk that's burned countless traders who assumed prices would converge.\n\nYou'll work through real calculations: shipping costs for Atlantic crossings, netback comparisons between European and Asian markets, and storage break-even analysis using German salt caverns. By the end, you'll see how global gas dynamics feed directly into the spark spread formulas you'll learn next.\n\nPhysical Foundations taught you why gas plants set marginal power prices. This guide shows you where gas prices come from - the global infrastructure that determines the fuel input cost. Next, you'll learn spark spreads (power minus gas minus carbon), which combine gas prices with power and carbon markets to identify profitable generation opportunities.\n\nComplete the Physical Foundations guide first. You need to understand merit order dispatch and why gas-fired plants are marginal price-setters. No prior trading experience required.\n\nTrack Henry Hub and NBP prices online or on TradingView for a month. When Henry Hub makes a significant move, set a calendar reminder for 6-8 weeks and check whether NBP followed. The lag will become intuitive, not theoretical.\n\nGet the complete guide in PDF format for offline reading and reference.",

    "fullText": "If you follow me, you might already know Tech Workers Coalition (TWC). For everybody else, TWC is an international organization that supports union and political organizing of workers within the tech sector. It's heavily decentralized and has chapters spread throughout North America and Europe. It includes every kind of profession in the field: developers, content moderators, designers, testers, sysadmins, data workers, customer service, and so on.\n\nThe organization, over the years, tried different paths to communicate to the outside what it does, why it does what it does, and what it would like to do in the future. The most recent iteration is probably this Identity Document, which gets regularly printed into flyers and handed to newcomers during onboarding sessions.\n\nThe challenge comes from different factors:\n\nI've been part of TWC for 7 years now. I helped start the Berlin chapter, then the Italian chapter, and in the last two years, the Global chapter. I've talked with hundreds of people participating in the communities, coached many chapter organizers, given workshops and onboarding sessions, and facilitated hundreds of meetings within TWC. It is now an integral part of my present and my past.\n\nIn this article, I want to give my take on why I do this, why I think it's important, and why some of you might want to join us. Because, ultimately, it is not so obvious and linear why somebody should be contributing their time to TWC rather than, for example, a union.\n\nLet me preface by saying that I strongly believe that any healthy political ecosystem is composed of organizations aware of their own role. Constructive relationships are also built by behaving in a way that fosters the success of your peers and the health of the whole ecology, rather than by exclusively pursuing the success of your own ideas, your own model, and your own issues. In the context of political participation and activation, this often translates into growing the organization with just the right people, rather than growing indefinitely. Trying to incorporate everybody and preventing them from joining organizations with slightly different values or goals turns political engagement into a zero-sum game. That means that we often invite workers NOT to join TWC if it's not the right thing for them, and rather do direct workplace organizing, join a union, or a party.\n\nThis article, then, while advocating for the merit and worth of participating in TWC, should be seen primarily as a useful tool to decide if you might be a good fit for TWC or if you should rather join a different space.\n\nSo, why Tech Workers Coalition? Why should you join? And how would your effort translate into impact?\n\nOne of the most recognized contributions of TWC has always been its ability to complement unions at the local level. Often stuck in a Fordist mindset, unions struggle to grasp the implications of cognitive labor and its specificities, worsening the gap of language, culture, and aesthetics between unions and office workers in the tech sector.\n\nThis doesn't happen magically: TWC organizers create offline and online community spaces, conferences, and events for green and experienced tech organizers to connect. They develop relationships with unions and link them to workplaces that are interested in organizing. They translate in both directions and facilitate interactions. They offer educational activities specific to labor organizing in the tech sector that unions overlook.\n\nUnions are often big organizations, slow to adapt and transform. Cognitive work poses deep challenges that are still unsolved at a global strategic level. TWC allows tech unions to still develop and thrive on the ground by filling the gaps in the areas traditional unions cannot yet see.\n\nThe more we go on, the more we realize how the tech elites, especially in the USA, are openly supporting a return to Fascism and other forms of oppression. They are reshaping the global economy to entrench themselves in the productive processes and state machinery. They imprint their values and beliefs on the psychic landscape of the ever-increasingly alienated modern and post-modern worlds.\n\nMany are fighting the tech oligarchs from without: hackers and FOSS communities, environmental activists, NGOs, and sometimes even governments. The truth is, though, that the real leverage is between the office chair and the keyboard. We could talk extensively about economics, infrastructure, power analysis, and even draw historical comparisons with the organizing of early factory workers, when only a few, like Marx, were advocating for focusing on them rather than organizing farmers, like most socialists were doing. It would be a long and boring analysis. Suffice to say that there's a lot of power in the tech industry, and that's a lot of power that could be contested and won by tech workers. We are uniquely positioned to bind such power enough to, at the very least, limit the harm the tech industry is doing to the rest of the world or, in the best scenario, reshape how and why technology is produced.\n\nWhat if you believe this, but you don't work in tech? Well, join TWC anyway. Workplace organizing is not possible for everybody: geography, workplace conditions, or, as I said, a different career path might prevent you from doing “the Thing”. TWC is a space where you can help others do “the Thing”. It's meta-organizing, baby. For some, it is frustrating: they want to be directly involved, they want the tension of a high-stakes union election, or the thrill and risk of a direct action during a protest. For others, it is cozy and reassuring: you help a hundred plants grow, and some of them for sure will bear fruit.\n\nThe tech labor movement is, worldwide, a relatively young phenomenon. In some countries, it's unheard of. In some others, it is growing and exploring what's possible. While we are beginning to understand what works and what doesn't, nobody really has found a magic formula that solves it all. Contrary to other forms of labor organizing, where ideas decades old are crystallized and organizations struggle to keep up with social and political changes, in the tech sector there's a lot of experimentation going on.\n\nOn one side it is stressful for many: some workers just want to improve their workplace and would like to have a cookiecutter strategy to apply. On the other side, for the more creative and ambitious, there's a lot of room to try new approaches. For example, we are still not set on what a strike in tech looks like. Some workers just stop working. Some employ traditional forms like picketing or marching instead of going to the office. Some others do more fun and creative stuff to keep busy and attract attention: live streaming, union-themed game jams and hackathons, and so on and so forth.\n\nTWC acts as a network throuch which these ideas travel. Traditional media or social media don't always cover these topics, especially outside the USA. Established networks of unions often talk high-level strategy and rarely go into such level of detail. TWC instead often sees meetings with tech workers from all over, sharing their stories and circulating know-how they didn't know they had. In a way, being in TWC feels like the early internet: tech labor is fragmented and disconnected across national boundaries, and absent from traditional media. TWC acts as a network for the first time, allowing tech workers to discover that in Czechia, India, or the Philippines, there are people like them, with similar issues, but maybe completely different approaches, ideas, and aesthetics.\n\nAs we said, the fight against Big Tech takes many shapes. TWC doesn't collaborate only with labor organizations, but, especially at a local level, acts as an aggregator for people working professionally on the political side of technology: researchers, investigators, artists, occultists, cooperative entrepreneurs, sometimes even party politicians.\n\nThis means that many members of TWC get involved in a lot of different and interesting initiatives happening at the fringes of our network: experimental commoning of technology, litigations, hackatons, policy-making, campaigns, performances, exhibitions, and so on.\n\nIn many places, especially smaller cities, TWC becomes a beacon for anybody working with radical technology but dissatisfied with the more traditional aggregation around hackerspaces or technical communities.\n\nFor some of us, this turned into a whole new career. Workplace organizing is fundamental, but after you're done, after you have your union in place, the company will probably still be working on how to feed the souls of innocent babies into a spirit-grinding, high-performance, demonic contraption. It takes a long time before the union is strong enough to push the company away from the business of butchering baby souls and towards more useful endeavors.\n\nThere are many cases of members that, after several years of TWC, decide to abandon their career in the tech startup or corporate world and go do something different. Some get employed by unions. Some start their own cooperative with their friends. Others join TWC meetings after waking up early to work on a farm. Some go teach in a movement school or join an NGO. Personally, participating in TWC allowed me to connect with people who eventually got me involved into AI Forensics first, and Reversing.works later. The full story here.\n\nI hope this article gave a compelling overview of what I helped build through a whole fifth of my life and I will keep building going forward. A journey that thought me agency, compassion, patience, dedication, and especially the ecstactic joy of seeing the world and the life of people around you change and get better over time.\n\nIf you're tired of arguing on the internet, if you think there's nothing to be done to form a union at work, if you're forced to “monitor the situation”, join TWC.",

    "fullText": "Experts warn use of VPNs makes it hard to limit access to technology that can create nonconsensual explicit images\n\nDays after Malaysia made global headlines by announcing it would temporarily ban Grok over its ability to generate “grossly offensive and nonconsensual manipulated images”, the generative AI tool was conversing breezily with accounts registered in the country.\n\n“Still here! That DNS block in Malaysia is pretty lightweight – easy to bypass with a VPN or DNS tweak,” Grok’s account on X said in response to a question from a user.\n\nGrok’s ability to allow users to create sexually explicit images, including images of children, has created a global outcry over recent weeks, with regulators and politicians around the world launching investigations. Indonesia and Malaysia became the first two countries to announce blocks on the technology, with Malaysia’s regulatory body saying last Sunday it had “directed a temporary restriction” on access to Grok, effective as of 11 January 2026. Officials in the Philippines have said they too plan to ban the technology.\n\nBlocking access to Grok is not straightforward, however. The technology not only exists across multiple platforms, including a standalone app and website, but is also integrated across X, which, along with Grok, is owned by Elon Musk’s xAI.\n\nOver the past week, X users, and even Grok itself, have advised people on how to bypass restrictions. This includes using a VPN – many of which are available for free – or changing domain name system (DNS), the protocol on the internet that turns address names into IP addresses that load websites.\n\nWhen the Guardian tried to use Grok in Indonesia, its website was working even without a VPN, though the Grok app did not work. Grok was also still responding to Indonesian accounts on X, where it functions as an integrated chatbot. X has not been subject to a ban.\n\nEven if governments could completely restrict Grok, though, this is not a real solution, said Nana Nwachukwu, an AI governance expert and PhD researcher at Trinity College Dublin.\n\n“Blocking Grok is like slapping a Band-Aid on a weeping wound that you haven’t cleaned,” she said. “You block Grok, and then you go around shouting you’ve done something. Meanwhile, people can use VPNs to access the same platforms.” Or, they could simply turn to one of the many other platforms that offer the same functions, including “smaller, general purpose AI systems that are largely unknown”, Nwachukwu added.\n\nGovernments should instead focus on law enforcement and investigating individuals who use such tools to break the law, she added. “Platforms are required by law to provide information to law enforcement when a crime has been committed,” Nwachukwu said. “If we see people being arrested, people being tried in courts, people being jailed for these offences, that’s a sign that this is a real crime.”\n\nX should build accountability into its platform – and clean itself up, said Nwachukwu: “All of those offending images should be removed from the platform.”\n\nOn Wednesday, X announced additional safeguards in response to continued public anger, saying it would stop the @Grok account on X from “allowing the editing of images of real people in revealing clothing such as bikinis”, including paid subscribers. However, the Guardian found that it was possible to get around such restrictions by using the standalone version of Grok, easily accessible through a web browser, to create short videos in which clothes are removed from images of real women.\n\nThis could then be posted to X’s public platform, where it could be viewed by users around the world within seconds.\n\nMusk’s company also said that, in jurisdictions where such content is illegal, it will geoblock the ability of all users in those locations to generate images of real people in bikinis, or similar attire, in Grok on X, adding that “xAI is implementing similar geoblocking measures for the Grok app”.\n\nExperts warn users may still be able to get around such “geoblocks” through a VPN. It is also not clear in which countries such restrictions will be implemented.\n\nIn Malaysia, the communications minister, Fahmi Fadzil, has said restrictions on Grok would only be lifted once the ability to produce harmful content had been disabled, according to local media reports.\n\nDr Nuurrianti Jalli, a visiting fellow at the media, technology and society programme at ISEAS – Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore, said the threat of blocking Grok could be a useful way to apply pressure to companies to respond quickly, adding that it “shifts the debate from ‘individual bad actors’ to questions of platform responsibility, safety by design, and accountability when safeguards fail”. It could also “slow the spread of abuse, reduce casual misuse and create a clear boundary around what authorities consider unacceptable”, she said.\n\nIn Indonesia, Grok has been used to create nonconsensual sexualised images of singers and celebrities, including one of the country’s most popular girl groups, JKT48, while in Malaysia, women report similar abuses, including cases where the tool has been used to remove their hijabs, according to Malaysian media.\n\nSome women resorted to publicly telling Grok on X that they do not authorise it to “crawl, take, process or edit” any of their photos.\n\nJalli said governments should push for greater transparency “about how safety measures are implemented, how abuse reports are handled and what enforcement steps are taken when harmful content is generated or circulated”.\n\nThe Malaysian communications and multimedia commission and the ministry of communications did not respond to a request for comment. Indonesia’s ministry of communication and digital affairs also did not respond.\n\nNwachukwu said safeguards should be built into the AI system, rather than “gates” built around it. “Both the [geographic] restriction from X, [and] the restriction from the government is gated access, and gates can be broken down,” she said.\n\nAdditional reporting from Hidayatullah",

    "fullText": "Big tech treats our attention like a resource to be mercilessly extracted. The fightback begins here\n\nIn the last 15 years, a linked series of unprecedented technologies have changed the experience of personhood across most of the world. It is estimated that nearly 70% of the human population of the Earth currently possesses a smartphone, and these devices constitute about 95% of internet access-points on the planet. Globally, on average, people seem to spend close to half their waking hours looking at screens, and among young people in the rich world the number is a good deal higher than that.\n\nHistory teaches that new technologies always make possible new forms of exploitation, and this basic fact has been spectacularly exemplified by the rise of society-scale digital platforms. It has been driven by a remarkable new way of extracting money from human beings: call it “human fracking”. Just as petroleum frackers pump high-pressure, high-volume detergents into the ground to force a little monetisable black gold to the surface, human frackers pump high-pressure, high-volume detergent into our faces (in the form of endless streams of addictive slop and maximally disruptive user-generated content), to force a slurry of human attention to the surface, where they can collect it, and take it to market.\n\nFracking (of the Earth and of our minds) produces tectonic instability, toxicity and the despoliation of our landscapes, natural and social. We now know that the heedless exploitation of our external environment has been so relentless and irresponsible that human survival on Earth has been placed in actual jeopardy. The new “gold rush” into the inner environment of the human psyche is well on its way to effecting parallel, if even more insidious destruction.\n\nThe stakes are existential. And that is because, rightly understood, our actual human “attention” – the thing the frackers want, in the form of our eyes on their screens – is nothing less than our ability to care, our ability to think, our ability to give our minds, time and senses to ourselves, the world and each other. To commodify that is to commodify our very beings. The problem isn’t “phones”, and it isn’t “social media”. The problem is human fracking, a world-spanning land-grab into human consciousness – which big tech is treating as a vast, unclaimed territory, ripe for sacking and empire.\n\nThat’s the bad news. The good news is that novel forms of exploitation produce novel forms of resistance. What fills the coffers of the six largest corporations on the planet is nothing other than the stuff of our humanity. Which is to say this new fight for our attention stands in a long line of clashes between those who are willing to reduce people (their labour, their eyeballs) to cash value and those who insist on a higher view of human flourishing. This history is long and complex, and often painful. But it tells us this much: we can fight back. Indeed, we must.\n\nSo what is to be done about this new kind of human exploitation that is harming us – harming children and adults, compromising our deliberative politics and our psychological wellbeing? Regulatory efforts are piecemeal and actively thwarted by the powerful interests in play. Psychopharmacological fixes for the ever-expanding damage merely monetise the destruction in a complementary way and render us better able to submit to conditions that are palpably at odds with human flourishing. How to confront a problem that is both unspeakably intimate and unthinkably extensive?\n\nThe answer is clear: we, the actual people of this planet, must come together in decisive solidarity; we must say no to the human frackers, and do so by insisting, in new ways, that human attention is human, and it is ours, and we will use it to make the worlds in which we want to live. In other words, we need a movement.\n\nThink that sounds quixotic? Well, keep in mind that’s how actual change actually happens. And it can happen fast. The environmental movement as we know it did not exist in 1950, but by 1970 it was a global force. In 1946 Reynolds Tobacco was using doctors to promote cigarettes. Fewer than 20 years later, the American Medical Association and the US surgeon general publicly averred that smoking caused lung cancer.\n\nAnd the changes get much bigger than that. Precious few do-gooders devoted themselves to environmental politics in 1925. That’s because “environmental politics” wasn’t even a thing. It took a cultural shift (and the work of advocates such as Rachel Carson) across the mid-20th century to establish the physical environment – the unity of land, water, and air that produces shared life – as a politically tractable object around which diverse groups could organise. This is to say that the very structures of politics, not just our beliefs and hopes, are themselves emergent forms. New things come into being, and old things pass away.\n\nWhere attention is concerned, there are mounting signs that we are reaching an inflection point. People of all sorts, Maga Republicans and Mamdani progressives, hipsters in Portland and evangelicals in Arkansas – people who don’t agree about anything – all actually do agree that something is totally wrong with a world in which everyone spends nearly all their time scrolling endlessly through the algorithmic feeds of their social media, a world where military-grade technology and trillion-dollar corporations take aim at children, and feed them whatever it takes to keep them hooked.\n\nYou can only abuse people so much, and then, eventually, they turn, they rise, they insist on something else. Already politicians on the right and the left are identifying this issue as one that moves the electorate. In 30 years, we will look back, and this era – the wild west of the tech princes’ smash-and-grab into our hearts, souls and relationships – will be difficult to explain to our grandkids. “How did you all let that happen?” they will ask. And we’ll have to say: “It’s hard to explain: it happened before we noticed; it was so much fun, especially at first; it took us time to figure out what was going on … ”\n\nBut we are figuring it out. We write as representatives of a fast-growing and increasingly well-organised movement, focused on pushing back against the human frackers, and giving shape to a new politics of human attention. At the heart of our efforts? The formation of broad coalitions devoted to the politics of human attention, the practice of diverse forms of study that call forth the life-giving powers of the mind and senses, and the promotion of sanctuary spaces for the protection and cultivation of the kinds of attention that make life good. We call this work attention activism.\n\nOur claim? That all of us already have the tools to resist the frackers, because all of us already have things we do and care about that put us beyond the reach of the algorithms. We all already know the deepest truth: that true human attention isn’t the click and swipe of screen time. True human attention is love, curiosity, daydreaming and taking care of ourselves and others.\n\nYes, new technologies give rise to new kinds of exploitation and resistance. But new forms of exploitation can even give rise to genuinely new forms of politics. You couldn’t brutalise an industrial proletariat before the factory system. Steam engines set the conditions of possibility for this development. They weren’t themselves a “problem”, of course; they gleamed and were precise and powerful. Who could see them operate without awe? But they also created a world in which it was possible to aggregate and extract physical labour from human beings in a revolutionary way. Along the way, they created a new kind of political subject, Homo economicus, a person who had been reduced, in the calculus of modernity, to “labuor value”. Actual revolutions followed – and a new kind of politics was born which reflected a new world of industrial labour, and new forms of labour solidarity, such as unions and workers’ parties.\n\nThe new system of human fracking is turning all of us into attentional subjects in a powerful new way. Homo attentus is the end user of every networked system – economic, political, expressive. With this new form of life comes, as we have discovered, appalling new vulnerability. But we are on the brink of understanding the new power that has come into our hands in the fracklands. We believe a new kind of politics beckons. What will it look like? It is hard to say. And there are reasons to be fearful. But if we, the people, can take up the banner of a new kind of freedom movement – a movement for the true freedom of attention itself, what we call attensity – and deploy our truly human attention in new ways, with a new understanding of the stakes, we can defy the frackers, and insist on creating, together, a human world.\n\nD Graham Burnett is professor of history at Princeton University.

    "fullText": "SYDNEY, N.S. — American forward Emily Pohl and blueliner Margaret Averill notched two goals and added two assists apiece to help lead the United States handily take the Swedes out of gold medal contention with a 9-1 win Saturday evening at the 2026 IIHF Under-18 Women's World Championship at Centre 200.\n\nForward Jane Daley was one of five other players to put one on the scoreboard for the U.S., making her record-setting 12th goal of this year's tournament, according to the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF). She leads all players with 17 points total.\n\nAverill and Pohl opened it up in the first to make it 2-0 going into the first intermission, forwards Jillian McLaughlin and Daley added a couple \n\nThree of those first seven goals were scored on American powerplays, including one on a five-on-three in the second, which included a two-minute interference from defender Ebba Westerlind and a five-minute spearing penalty, that came with a game misconduct, from forward Moa Stridh, served by fourth-liner Greta Johansson, which certainly didn't help the Swedish squad with the game off the ice — and perhaps their mentality on the ice.\n\nThat being said, there were plenty of Swedish fans in the stands in the Cape Breton arena, wearing team jerseys, holding up brightly coloured signs, and cheering them on throughout, but the whoops and hollers were perhaps no louder than when Tilde Grillfors snuck one past American goalkeeper Bianca Birrittieri on a powerplay just over three minutes into the final frame, narrowing the gap to 7-1 for the U.S.\n\nDespite the Swedish support in the crowd, and the goalie change from starter Meja Engelin to Thea Holmberg going into the third period, there just wasn't enough time for the yellow and blue squad to catch up to the visibly stronger American team.\n\nCentre Talla Hansen scored on an Averill assist and winger Lindsay Stephnowski capped it off with help from Pohl to seal the 9-1 deal and earn a berth to Sunday's gold medal game for the United States.\n\nBirrittieri didn't earn the shutout but made a solid 17 stops for the U.S., while Engelin made a respectable 25 saves on 32 shots against. Holmberg saved seven of nine shots in her third-period appearance in the crease.\n\n\"This sucks,\" Swedish captain Ebba Westerlind told reporters matter-of-factly after the tough semifinal loss.\"We compete every time,\" she said, adding, \"the U.S.A. is really good, so we try to do our best.\"\n\n\"I think we did some good things... (but) I felt like they were first on the pucks, especially in the first period,\" she said, but pointed out \"we did better throughout the game.\"\n\nNow that Sweden is moving on from semis, it's time for \"eat, sleep, rest,\" Westerlind said of focusing on what's coming next for her country at U18 women's worlds — a chance to go home with bronze medals around their necks. \"We know we have to do the best we can... and focus on the win.\"\n\nSweden will play for bronze bragging rights earlier Sunday at Centre 200. The Swedes last won a silver medal at the 2023 IIHF Under-18 Women's World Championship, which they hosted in their home country in the northern community Ostersund.\n\nAs for the Americans, four-point contributor Pohl said, \"we don't take any of our opponents lightly.\n\n\"We knew it was going to be a good game, but I think all of us are us are prepared,\" the Woodbury, Minn., native said.\n\n\"Our coaches and teammates do a great job preparing all of us. So, (we) just (to) have fun and smile out there, and play our game that we know how to play.\"\n\nUnited States head coach Courtney Kennedy said her team was \"enjoying the moment\" of the semifinal celebration before turning thoughts to tomorrow's battle for the world championship title.\n\n\"It was a lot of work to get here,\" she said. \"I'm very proud of the players, and I'm proud of the way they played through all three periods of every single game, and it's uphill from here.\n\n\"Whoever wins this next game, we're going to have to prepare and get back to the drawing board about what we need to be successful, and both teams that we could end up playing, they're both fantastic, they're well-coached, and (Sunday) will be a hard, hard game.\"\n\n\"Tomorrow's another day,\" Kennedy said.\n\nEarlier Saturday, Finland beat Slovakia 7-1 in a relegation game, marking the first time the normally top-ranked women's hockey country, which means they'll be moving down a division in the IIHF under-18 international pool.\n\nThe large scoring gaps at this U18 worlds isn't what many fans, or serious women's hoockey watchers, want to see, as international development should be helping close these gaps to ensure competition continues to improve and the game continues to grow worldwide.\n\nSweden faces off in the bronze medal game at 3:30 p.m. AT, while the United States goes for gold at 7:30 p.m. AT.",

    "title": "Trump 25% tariff on European allies until Denmark sells Greenland to US",
    "description": "Heads of state across Europe respond in solidarity with Denmark and Greenland, and boycott of World Cup suggested",
    "fullText": "Heads of state across Europe respond in solidarity with Denmark and Greenland, and boycott of World Cup suggested\n\nDonald Trump threatened a 25% tariff on a slew of European countries including Denmark, Germany, France and the UK – until the US is allowed to purchase Greenland, in an extraordinary escalation of the president’s bid to claim the autonomous Danish territory.\n\nIn a lengthy post on Saturday on Truth Social, Trump said he would impose a 10% tariff on Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Finland beginning 1 February, “on any and all goods sent to the United States of America”.\n\nHe said the tariff will increase to 25% on 1 June.\n\n“This Tariff will be due and payable until such time as a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland,” Trump said.\n\nThe president’s longstanding interest in acquiring Greenland “one way or the other” has become a fixation since the US raid that captured Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro earlier in January. While he has claimed the Arctic territory’s current status poses a national security threat to the US, this has been disputed by US allies, including Denmark.\n\nIn the Saturday morning post, Trump said forces from the eight European nations “have journeyed to Greenland, for purposes unknown”. It was an apparent reference to Nato allies deploying troops in Greenland on Thursday in response to Trump’s threats to forcefully take the Arctic island, which is an autonomous territory of Denmark.\n\n“The President’s statement comes as a surprise,” Lars Løkke Rasmussen, Denmark’s foreign minister, responded on social media. “Earlier this week, we had a constructive meeting with Vice President Vance and Secretary Rubio. The purpose of the increased military presence in Greenland, to which the President refers, is to enhance security in the Arctic.”\n\n“Every insult, threat, tariff and lie that we receive strengthens our resolve,” Rasmus Jarlov, the conservative chair of Denmark’s defence committee, wrote in more direct language. “The answer from Denmark and Greenland is final: We will never hand over Greenland. We pray that our true allies will stand with us because we are going to need it.”\n\nThe tariff threat against Nato allies united the leaders of those nations in unusually blunt language, after months of treading carefully for fear of triggering the volatile US president’s rage.\n\nIn response to Trump’s comments on Saturday, the EU commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said in a statement that the Europeans “have consistently underlined our shared transatlantic interest in peace and security in the Arctic, including through NATO. The pre-coordinated Danish exercise, conducted with allies, responds to the need to strengthen Arctic security and poses no threat to anyone.”\n\n“The EU stands in full solidarity with Denmark and the people of Greenland,” she added. “Tariffs would undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral.”\n\n“Our position on Greenland is very clear – it is part of the Kingdom of Denmark and its future is a matter for the Greenlanders and the Danes,” the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, said. “Applying tariffs on allies for pursuing the collective security of Nato allies is completely wrong. We will of course be pursuing this directly with the US administration.”\n\nEmmanuel Macron, the French president, drew an implicit comparison between Trump’s threats to seize Greenland and Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. “No intimidation or threat will influence us – neither in Ukraine, nor in Greenland, nor anywhere else in the world when we are confronted with such situations,” Macron wrote in a social media riposte to Trump.\n\nFinland’s president, Alexander Stubb, whose excellence at golf previously made him something of a Trump whisperer, echoed the warning about a potential “downward spiral”.\n\n“We will not let ourselves be blackmailed,” the Swedish prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, added. That sentiment was echoed by Norway’s prime minister, Jonas Gahr Støre, who wrote: “Threats have no place among allies.”\n\nGermany’s leadership was more reserved, with the German chancellor Friedrich Merz leaving it to his spokesperson, Stefan Kornelius, to say only that the government “has taken note of” Trump’s statements and plans to coordinate with allies to “decide on appropriate responses at the appropriate time”.\n\nOn Friday, however, a spokesperson on foreign policy for the chancellor’s Christian Democrat party, Jürgen Hardt, suggested that Germany could threaten to boycott the World Cup Trump is hosting this summer “as a last resort in order to get Trump to see sense on the Greenland issue”. Polling done before Trump’s latest threat for the popular German tabloid Bild revealed broad support for a World Cup boycott, with 47% of Germans in favor and just 35% against, should the US annex Greenland.\n\nEven before the new tariff threat, there were mass protests in Greenland and Denmark on Saturday against Trump’s efforts to “acquire” the island.\n\nHis latest tariff threat comes just eight months after Trump announced that he had struck a trade pact with the UK – and six months after he announced a pact with the European Union.\n\nThe UK would have protection against future US tariffs “because I like them”, Trump declared in the summer. He described the pact with the EU as a “powerful deal” and an “important” partnership.\n\nTrump’s sudden reversal on Saturday even managed to alienate one of his biggest fans, Nigel Farage, the leader of the rightwing, anti-immigrant party Reform UK. “We don’t always agree with the US government and in this case we certainly don’t. These tariffs will hurt us,” Farage wrote.\n\nThere was also criticism from Trump’s own Republican party. Thom Tillis, a US senator from North Carolina, called the president’s threat “bad for America” but “great for Putin, Xi and other adversaries who want to see Nato divided”.\n\n“The fact that a small handful of ‘advisers’ are actively pushing for coercive action to seize territory of an ally is beyond stupid,” Tillis added.\n\nThe president has repeatedly turned to tariffs in a bid to force countries to bend to his will – with some success. Days after returning to office for his second term in early 2025, Colombia agreed to accept military aircraft carrying deported migrants after Trump threatened steep duties on the country’s exports to the US.\n\nTrump, who has previously extolled the benefits of tariffs as a negotiating tool, stressed on Saturday that the US was “immediately open to negotiation” with Denmark and any of the countries it was threatening to hit with these new tariffs.\n\nHis aggressive global trade strategy has raised fears for the US economy, which analysts and policymakers have warned could face significant damage from sweeping tariffs on the world.\n\nWhile the White House has played down such concerns, a vast wave of tariffs unveiled by Trump last spring – when he proclaimed the start of a new era for the US economy – was quickly reversed as global markets fell sharply.\n\nBut his administration’s erratic rollout of other tariffs nevertheless significantly strained US trade ties with the world. Americans now face an overall average effective tariff rate of 16.8%, according to the Budget Lab at Yale, the highest level since 1935.\n\nThe Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, said recently that Greenland’s defence is a “common concern” for the whole of Nato. The Guardian reported that European troops had deployed to Greenland, in part, to establish what a more sustained ground deployment on the territory could look like, and partly to reassure the US that European Nato members were serious about Arctic security.\n\nFewer than one in five of Americans approve of Trump’s efforts to acquire Greenland, a poll published on Thursday by Reuters/Ipsos found. Both Democrats and Republicans oppose the effort, and only 4% of Americans think the US should take Greenland using military force.\n\nMuch of Trump’s wider trade strategy is currently in the hands of the US supreme court, which is mulling whether the imposition of many of his tariffs was legal. A decision could be announced as early as next week.",

    "description": "Visits to the US by international travelers declined for the eighth straight month in December, in a continued blow to the tourism industry.",
    "fullText": "The US isn't the tourist destination it once was.\n\nVisits to the US by international travelers declined for the eighth straight month in December, according to data released earlier this month by the National Travel and Tourism Office.\n\nIn 2025, visits to the US were down among 10 of the top 20 overseas tourist-generating countries, including India, Germany, and South Korea.\n\nThe decline is a sustained blow to the travel and tourism industries, which in 2024 supported more than 15 million jobs, and generated about $1.3 trillion in economic output — including $181 billion from inbound international travel.\n\nMajor tourism hubs like Las Vegas are seeing widespread layoffs due to the downturn, forcing workers to get creative with their career pivots. Business Insider reported earlier this month that laid-off hospitality workers contributed to a 55% increase in dancer auditions at a Las Vegas strip club compared to the prior six months.\n\nIt doesn't appear the travel bug has gone anywhere — just that international tourists are avoiding the US.\n\nIn Australia, for example, overseas arrivals and departures data released Friday by the country's Bureau of Statistics shows that international travel returned to pre-pandemic levels just before the lockdowns began in 2020. Australians travelling to Canada rose 4% in the last year, 10% more visited India, and visits by Australians to China and Japan rose 20% and 21%, respectively, but 3.2% fewer booked a trip to the US.\n\nFewer Canadian travelers are visiting the US, as well, opting instead to go further south to Mexico, Business Insider reported last April.\n\nComplicating demand were ongoing trade frictions, tariff battles, and geopolitical unease, which helped fuel grass-roots boycotts of US goods and, in some cases, changes in travel plans.\n\nEuropean travel firms and analysts pointed to tariff-driven consumer backlash and growing anti-American sentiment as factors that contributed to early-year softness in bookings, even as demand showed signs of rebounding later in the summer.\n\nDomestic travel has helped cushion the blow so far, with the US Travel Association projecting that domestic leisure travel was forecast to grow 1.9% to $895 billion in 2025.\n\nHowever, if international visitors continue to stay away, destinations that depend on overseas spending — from iconic tourism cities to national parks — could feel growing pressure as the US heads into a high-stakes stretch of global events in 2026 and beyond.",

    "fullText": "Augsburg striker Michael Gregoritsch has commented on what it felt like to return to the Bundesliga so much sooner than expected with one of his old clubs. The Austrian international unfortunately didn’t make much of a mark in Thursday night’s 1-1 draw with Union Berlin beyond accidentally colliding with FCU captain Rani Khedira early. It was nevertheless an emotional occasion for the 31-year-old.\n\n“I felt so sorry,” Gregoritsch remarked in the WWK Arena mixed zone. “I really wanted to avoid him, but he ran into me. I thought he was blocking me, but then he suddenly turned away. Rani is one of my closest friends in football. You can see that I apologized immediately. It was also uncomfortable for me because I didn’t mean to do it. I apologized throughout the entire game and promised Rani our next meal is on me.“\n\nWith his new club fighting relegation, Gregoritsch wished to make clear that he knew precisely what was expected of him. Despite the fact that both he and the Fuggerstädter haven’t gotten off to very good start in 2026 (a bad loss against Borussia Mönchengladbach and the points dropped against Union), Gregoritsch emphasized that he felt things would trend upward.\n\n“I really missed the Bundesliga and am so happy to be back here,” Gregoritsch said. “[coming back from Denmark] I’ve had a longer winter break and not much training rime. One can see that the team is a little unsettled, but they are basically good guys with a lot of quality. As one of the old guys, it’s my job to help. We’re getting better and I’m optimistic.”\n\nFCA head coach Manuel Baum appeared to suggest so at his Friday pre-match press conference. Even though the Thursday Bundesliga fixture leaves the team on a tight turnaround, Baum stressed that he wanted to build a consistent squad.\n\n“There may be some changes, but I’m less in favor of rotating because I believe we need a core,” Baum said. “There are a few here with a Freiburg past. With regard to ‘Gregerl,’ I asked him today and he said he feels really good. So it’s possible that he’ll start again.“",

You play these great champions like Judd and I am so proud because I've lost the last few against him.\"\n\nWith the momentum shifting, Higgins, 50, also took the fifth with a superb 104 break.\n\nThe Englishman pinched the sixth and eighth frames with half centuries after his opponent missed reds, but Higgins made a 57 clearance in similar fashion to take frame seven.\n\nTrump, 36, who has generally held sway in meetings between the pair since triumphing in their 2019 world final, looked set to seal victory in the ninth frame but with just four balls to pot, remarkably missed a routine brown.\n\nAnd that gave Higgins the impetus to craft pressure-breaks of 70 and 57 on his way to reeling off three tense frames in a row to complete a remarkable turnaround and become the oldest player to reach the final of a Triple Crown event.",

    "description": "After meeting my future husband at work, we decided to quit and go on a 24,000-mile cycling adventure together across the world. We fell in love.",
    "fullText": "My coworker and I were both single, and I was in the trenches of online dating. Stew and I took lunch at the same time, and over sandwiches eaten from Tupperware, we bonded over our shared love of cycling.\n\nOne lunch, he told me he was going to cycle the highest pass in Wales. My eyes widened, \"I'd love to do that.\" That's when he told me to join him.\n\nHe picked me up that weekend, and we cycled Gospel Pass.\n\nThe next lunch break, Stew asked me out for dinner. I said yes. He stayed over and never went home. The rest, as they say, is history, and what a ride it's been so far.\n\nWe were dating for about a month when Stewart said, \"I've got something to tell you.\" He continued: \"I'm going to quit my job and cycle around the world. Do you want to come with me?\"\n\n\"Yes!\" I said without hesitation.\n\nStew had already planned a 24,000-mile turn-by-turn route across 32 countries.\n\nHe saved enough money that he could ride around the world for 18 months unemployed. His plan was to carry a tent and stay in cheap accommodations, like hostels and Airbnb rooms.\n\nAll I needed to do was save enough money to cover my flights. For a few months, we cut costs, but left ourselves with enough money to enjoy being a young couple; a meal out each month was a non-negotiable.\n\nAs we left our jobs, Stewart also organized the bikes: bright yellow steel-frame touring bikes that could manage long-distance cycling, as well as the additional weight of our luggage.\n\nWhen we left the UK, we waved goodbye to our families at Stewart's mom's house, and we wobbled down the driveway on the heaviest bikes we'd ever ridden.\n\nI will never forget the feeling of freedom. We were unemployed, and everything we needed for the next 18 months was packed into six bright yellow panniers, which fit proudly on our bikes.\n\nI was nervous, excited, and weightless.\n\nThere are many prominent moments as you cycle from one country to another. But the first one was leaving Georgia and arriving in Azerbaijan. The gorgeous greenery of Azerbaijan turned into flat desert landscapes.\n\nAustralia was similar. Across Nullarbor Plain, we rode desert flatlands with kangaroos and Wedge-Tailed Eagles. Service stations were over 100 miles apart. Then we reached New South Wales, home to green mountains and Bulli Pass.\n\nAt the top, there was a wedding venue overlooking the sea. We talked about weddings and all the things we didn't want: first dances, speeches, and the pressure of invitations.\n\nAfter Australia, our next stop was New Zealand. We flew to Queenstown and researched what it takes to get married there. You need a marriage license and a celebrant who will officiate the ceremony in front of two witnesses.\n\nOur celebrant was someone we found online, named Sean. He was a lovely Irish gentleman with a steady voice, a calming presence, and an art for perfectly timed humor. He knew exactly when to drop a joke and when to let a moment breathe. He promised us two witnesses (his wife, Vee, and friend, Chris) for the price of two quality bottles of wine.\n\nAfter one call with Sean, we stepped out into Queenstown, engaged-ish. We booked a date, bought New Zealand-gold wedding rings, and hired wedding attire.\n\nStew surprised me with a proposal and a placeholder ring, and of course, I said yes.\n\nOur next bike ride was 500 miles from Queenstown to Christchurch, so we could marry. I'd love to tell you that it was straightforward, but on a cycling adventure, unforeseen challenges arise. At Haast Pass, there was a landslide. Delays meant we would miss our own wedding.\n\nThe beauty of an elopement? We only had ourselves to please. I called Sean, the hair salon, and the florist to change the date. The landslide was cleared, and we made our way to Christchurch.\n\nWe married at The Sign of the Bellbird in the Port Hills. It was beautiful. Rolling hills with the yellowest of flowers looked stunning against the deep green mountains and gorgeous blue skies.\n\nOn that quiet hill, with only us to please, and nothing but birdsong and sunshine, we spoke our vows and became husband and wife.\n\nThere were no crowds, no pressure, and no expectations. It was just us, which was all we'd known in the year leading up to it as we cycled from the UK to New Zealand. What followed was an eight-month honeymoon cycling home via South America.",

    "title": "Trump's first year back in office was a mixed bag for the business world",
    "description": "Here are the businesses that Trump's first year back in office have greatly benefitted, and industries that have been hit hard.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump's year in office was a mixed bag of blessings and woes for the business world.\n\nLast year began with a lineup of billionaires at Trump's inauguration, all of whom soon saw their net worth diminish after Trump enacted sweeping tariffs aimed at reshoring manufacturing jobs.\n\nTheir fortunes soon rebounded, and Trump has been a booster of the tech industry, which continued to grow in 2025.\n\nBusinesses were also often caught in Trump's crosshairs, including Intel, Amazon, and Walmart.\n\nFrom the retail sector to the AI industry, here's how different industries fared in Trump's first year of his second term.\n\nThe AI industry continued to soar during the first year of Trump's second term.\n\nAccording to Morningstar, the company's AI basket of 34 stocks, which includes Amazon, Cisco, and Apple, saw a 50.8% in share value in 2025, while the overall stock market gained 17.3% and the broader tech sector rose 21.4%, based on the Morningstar US Market Index.\n\nWithin the first month of his presidency, Trump announced a $500 billion AI infrastructure project called Stargate, to be led by OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank, which he said would be \"the largest AI infrastructure project in history.\"\n\nTrump has also been a booster of the tech industry at large — while receiving donations, gifts, pledges for more American manufacturing, and praise from leaders.\n\nHe's had notable visits with CEOs, including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. The US eventually allowed Nvidia to sell H200 chips to China, under the condition that the government gets a cut of the profit.\n\nTrump also rescinded an executive order issued by former President Joe Biden that established a federal framework for AI safety and risk mitigation, and he signed a new order intended to override state-level AI regulations.\n\nAnd after publicly calling for the resignation of Intel's CEO, Trump made a deal for the US to take a nearly 10% equity in the company, which has since seen its stock rise.\n\nIt's unclear what Trump's second year in office in his second term will bring.\n\nConcerns are bubbling under the industry boom. Industry experts fear that an AI bubble burst will bring about a market crash similar to the dot-com crash.\n\nTrump is also warning tech companies that data centers cannot contribute to the affordability crisis by driving up energy bills. Some tech bulls, such as Dan Ives, said that the focus on costs could derail the AI boom.\n\nRetail businesses, large and small, have been hit hard by Trump's first year back.\n\nThe Trump presidency kicked off with a flurry of tariffs, sometimes on some of the country's closest trade partners. Businesses in retail have been struggling to keep up with the pace of change, and some have responded by hiking prices.\n\nBusiness Insider previously reported that the tariffs had disproportionately affected Main Street and entrepreneurs who make physical products. Several small businesses sued Trump over the tariffs enacted using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.\n\nEven if businesses were able to handle tariffs, they were competing for skittish consumers after sentiment sank to a new low in November, based on the Consumer Index by the University of Chicago. Economists have also found that while the wealthy have continued to spend, others have cut back.\n\nNot everything was down. Trump did backtrack on some of his tariffs, and the retail sector did see some growth compared to 2024, according to the ‌Commerce Department's Census Bureau.\n\nDespite Trump's promise to bring blue-collar jobs back to the US and some high-profile plans, like Apple's pledge to invest $500 billion domestically and Nvidia's plans for a US-based supercomputer plant, the manufacturing sector has still not taken off.\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, factory employment has dropped by more than 70,000 since April, to 12.69 million as of December, the lowest point since March 2022. The Bureau also estimated that the manufacturing sector lost 8,000 jobs in December alone.\n\nIn May 2025, a month after Trump enacted the bulk of his tariffs, Wells Fargo economists predicted that the duties would not be effective in reshoring manufacturing jobs and that the administration would face an \"uphill battle.\"\n\nBusiness Insider previously reported that some small and medium-sized businesses have canceled domestic investment plans due to economic uncertainty stemming from the constantly changing tariffs. The loss of manufacturing jobs also reflects a broader trend of a low-hire, low-fire environment, where businesses freeze in the face of an uncertain environment.\n\nTrump has shown a recent interest in policy around the sector.\n\nOver the past few months, Trump floated the idea of a 50-year fixed-rate mortgage, arguing it could make monthly payments more affordable for buyers shut out of homeownership.\n\nHe also recently said that he wants to ban large institutional investors from buying single-family homes in order to increase the supply of homes. He also announced that he would instruct his \"representatives\" to buy $200 billion in mortgage bonds, without further clarification.\n\nHome prices rose in 77% of metro markets during the third quarter of 2025, according to the National Association of Realtors' latest report. Business Insider also previously reported that the median age of a first-time homebuyer hit 40 in 2025, up from 31 a decade earlier.\n\nEconomists have thus far commented that neither idea would address the root of the problem, which is a shortage of homes. Trump's tariffs on raw materials may have also contributed to the cost of constructing homes.",

    "title": "I'm delivering for Uber Eats after decades in corporate marketing. It's helped me make money — and stay humble.",
    "description": "Jay Mandel spent decades in the corporate world in marketing roles before turning to Uber Eats last fall. It pays the bills and is humbling, he said.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Jay Mandel, a 48-year-old marketing professional who also works for Uber Eats in the New York City area. The interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI worked most of my career in corporate America in digital marketing.\n\nThe highlight of my career was my eight years at MasterCard, where I worked my way up to lead global social media as a vice president. I've also worked at IBM. More recently, I've worked as a marketing consultant and an adjunct professor, but this hasn't generated enough income. Right now, I'm raising money to build my own company.\n\nThe idea of starting gig work came from my therapist, who said it would do wonders for me to see how others live.\n\nI avoided it for several months. I went to Columbia University. I have a master's degree. I talked to people that I love, and they were like, \"You shouldn't have to resort to this.\"\n\nEventually, in October, I delivered my first Uber Eats order.\n\nEarly on, I got the feeling that I was invisible to most people. For one order, I had to go pick up a cake. It turned out the bakery didn't have the cake the customer wanted, so I spent 20 minutes on the phone with the customer while I spoke with the bakery to find something else that would work.\n\nWhen I finally made the delivery, the woman who ordered the cake had a blank look on her face — no \"thank you,\" no extra tip, or anything. In my past jobs, putting in extra effort usually resulted in some sort of recognition. With delivery work, I haven't felt that a lot of times.\n\nThen I realized that these companies charge so much money for these deliveries. It shouldn't be the customer's responsibility to tip.\n\nI also don't always feel like I have a choice about which orders I can take. Sometimes, it doesn't work for me to pick up or drop off in the Bronx, and I usually don't want to pick up McDonald's orders.\n\nI've done deliveries for Uber Courier, which involves delivering items between regular people. In one case, it was a backpack. Another time, it was a charger. It's a really valuable service, and I wish that Uber leaned into more of those deliveries.\n\nI use the money I earn from Uber — often a few hundred dollars a week — to make sure that my kids have a great weekend, like going out to dinner.\n\nOverall, my experience working for Uber Eats has been humbling. I don't see myself as any better than other delivery people. I try my best to smile and be the bright moment in someone else's day. I also have fun, get to visit new restaurants, and see neighborhoods I would never go to otherwise.\n\nIt's so tough to figure out how common my experience is as someone turning to gig work to pay the bills while still nurturing professional ambitions. The unemployment numbers don't capture people like me who do gig work. I never thought I'd struggle as much as I have financially, and it feels like more of my friends than not are in my situation.\n\nI don't view my employment situation as a result of my actions. Whether it's Uber Eats or teaching as an adjunct, this is part of a large system over which I have no control.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "Bitcoin likely already reached its post-halving peak at $126,000 last year, Jefferies' global head of equity strategy wrote in a note.",
    "fullText": "A longtime crypto bull is ditching bitcoin for gold.\n\nChristopher Wood, the global head of equity strategy at Jefferies, said he just cut bitcoin out of his firm's long-term model portfolio, where the token has accounted for around 5%-10% of the portfolio's allocation for the last five years.\n\nThat's because the price of the crypto has likely peaked, but also because there's an existential threat he sees jeopardizing the bitcoin ecosystem: quantum computing.\n\nIn a recent note to clients, Wood pointed specifically to CRQCs, or cryptographically relevant quantum computers — supercomputers that could potentially \"steal\" bitcoin from circulation, he said.\n\nBitcoin transactions are secured with cryptography, a coding system where transactions are encrypted with public keys, and access to the bitcoin itself is controlled by a private key. It would take supercomputers today \"trillions of years\" to derive a private key from a public one, given how complex the computations are, Wood said. But CRQCs could potentially reduce that time to something like several hours to several days, he speculated.\n\nCRQCs don't yet exist, but chatter about the potential risks is already spreading across the bitcoin community, Wood said, pointing to a report from ChainCode Labs that estimated as much as 10 million tokens, or 50% of all bitcoin in circulation, could be accessed by a CRQC.\n\nSome in the crypto community are arguing that the risk from CRQCs means \"vulnerable coins\" in the bitcoin ecosystem should be burned, Wood bited.\n\n\"While GREED & fear does not believe that the quantum issue is about to hit the Bitcoin price dramatically in the near term, the store of value concept is clearly on less solid foundation from the standpoint of a long-term pension portfolio,\" Wood said of his recent portfolio change. He added that he believed bitcoin reached its peak in the post-halving cycle at $126,000 last year.\n\nWood's team has replaced the allocation to bitcoin in the model portfolio with a 10% allocation to gold and gold mining stocks. The portfolio now has a total 45% allocation to physical gold, a 25% allocation to gold mining stocks, and a 30% allocation to Asian equities, excluding Japan.\n\n\"Meanwhile, the existential issue raised by quantum as regards Bitcoin can only be long-term positive for gold since it remains the historically stress tested store of value. Meanwhile, gold is also the best hedge, if not the only one, on the ever-rising geopolitical risks,\" Wood said.\n\nIt's been a rough few months for bitcoin, with the crypto tumbling into a bear market in late 2025 amid a broader risk-off move that was exacerbated by weak liquidity and concerns about the yen-carry trade.\n\nMeanwhile, the case for owning gold has only grown stronger since its stunning rally in 2025. The metal saw its best performance since 1979 and continues to hover near a record high as investors seek protection from geopolitical conflict and inflationary pressures.",

    "description": "From Elon Musk to Mark Zuckerberg, here's a look back at what industry titans were doing 10 years ago and what has changed.",
    "fullText": "Forget what you were doing in 2016 — what about the world's tech elite?\n\nMillennials are posting throwback pictures on social media and reminiscing over what many see as simpler times.\n\nIn some ways, the tech world was, too. Then, it was the era of apps. Today, it's the age of AI. Tech founders were more likely to be celebrated as disruptors, but in 2026, there is greater wariness about the billionaire class providing the tools we use every day.\n\nHere's what tech leaders were up to in 2016, and how their companies, personal brands, and net worths have changed in the decade since.\n\nA lot has changed for Elon Musk since 2016. The Tesla CEO and SpaceX founder is now worth over half a trillion dollars and wields extraordinary influence across the worlds of business and politics. But 10 years ago, he had a net worth of just over $11 billion, expressed little interest in politics, and was better known as an ambitious entrepreneur pioneering clean energy and rocket technology.\n\nIn July 2016, Musk released Tesla's \"masterplan part deux,\" which outlined the company's goals of building more affordable EVs and rolling out fleets of self-driving cars that make money for Tesla owners even when they're not using them. While Tesla has achieved the first goal, introducing the Model 3 and Y and dominating the US EV market, the second has proven more elusive.\n\nMusk also spent 2016 helping set up a mysterious new startup with an ambitious mission of building superintelligent AI — OpenAI. A decade later, he's suing the company and his former cochair, Sam Altman, over claims he was misled over the ChatGPT maker's abandonment of its nonprofit mission.\n\nIt's not just Mark Zuckerberg's personal look that's changed over the last decade — his company has a completely different name.\n\nIn 2016, Facebook was focused on social media and advertising growth. After rebranding to Meta in 2021 to focus on the metaverse, the company today is all in on the AI boom. Oh, and Zuckerberg wears chains now.\n\nA decade ago, Facebook was starting to come under scrutiny for its political influence, including the 2016 election that put Donald Trump in the White House. That's changed. Now, Zuckerberg openly embraces the Trump administration, and Meta this month hired his former advisor and official.\n\nZuckerberg was already a billionaire tech elite in 2016, but today he is the sixth-richest person in the world with a net worth of $220 billion, according to Bloomberg data.\n\nWhile Altman was influential in Silicon Valley in 2016, he was nowhere near the global name he is today. In 2016, Altman was leading the transformation of startup seed accelerator Y Combinator as its president, having launched a VC arm, a fellowship program, and a research lab.\n\nThe year before, Altman and Musk became co-chairs of OpenAI, having formed part of the team that founded the company. The company had already raised $1 billion in 2015 toward conducting research to benefit humanity. At the time, Altman told Business Insider that OpenAI's specific research goals were still being debated.\n\nAltman launched the website Voteplz in 2016 to streamline the voting process in the presidential election, and said in a tweet he was voting against Trump because he believed \"the principles he stands for represent an unacceptable threat to America.\"\n\nDespite this early opposition, Altman lauded Trump last year as a \"pro-business, pro-innovation president\".\n\nSame leather jacket. A whole different status. Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, may have kept the same style, but his company has evolved from a gaming chip giant into the world's most valuable company that's also critical to the AI boom.\n\nThe graphics processing units designed by Nvidia were mostly sold to gamers in 2016, but its chips were already being used in AI research labs. Now they are stacked up in data centers across the world to power AI models like ChatGPT. They have become so important to the global economy that any signs of weakness in Nvidia's results prompt fears of an AI bubble.\n\nDespite founding the world's most valuable company, his net worth of $155 billion puts him in ninth place on Bloomberg's Billionaires Index. Still, that's a huge jump from his net worth of about $3 billion at the end of 2016.\n\nPhilanthropy continues to dominate Bill Gates' public life. The Microsoft cofounder has ramped up donations through the Gates Foundation — formerly known as The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation — as part of his plan to give away nearly all his wealth over the next 20 years.\n\nIn 2016, Gates was the richest person in the world with a net worth of $87.4 billion. With his then-wife, Melinda French Gates, the two dedicated their 2016 annual letter to clean-energy development, writing about making zero-carbon emissions a priority and bringing energy to the world's poorest people.\n\nThe foundation focused on eliminating HIV, malaria, and other infectious diseases — a mission that has continued to 2026.\n\nIn 2016, Amazon was already dominating the online retail market, and Jeff Bezos was still the company's CEO.\n\nDespite a barrage of negative media attention the year before based on reports that Amazon warehouses were high-pressure, toxic work environments — claims Bezos disputed — the company's dominance in cloud was growing. This trajectory has continued with Amazon Web Services seeing a 20% cloud sales growth in the third quarter of 2025, with plans to double capacity by the end of 2027.\n\nBezos said in 2016 that his ambition for his space technology company, Blue Origin, was to move heavy, polluting industry away from Earth to one day save the planet. In November 2025, the firm had its first successful booster recovery, bringing Blue Origin closer to rivaling SpaceX's reusable rockets.\n\nBezos was still married to MacKenzie Scott before the two filed for divorce in 2019. He stepped down as Amazon CEO in 2021 and married Lauren Sánchez in a lavish multi-day celebration in Venice in June 2025.",

    "fullText": "DETROIT (AP) — Chinese automakers have been making inroads around the world with growing sales of their high-tech, stylish and affordable electric vehicles. That has had competitors concerned even before Canada this week agreed to cut its tariffs on Chinese EVs in exchange for concessions on Canadian farm products.\n\nExperts now say an easier path into Canada could be a big boost for Chinese carmakers looking to dominate the global market — particularly as their domestic market weakens. That poses a threat to other auto manufacturers, particularly American companies.\n\nU.S. officials acknowledged that in remarks at an assembly plant for Jeep-maker Stellantis in Toledo, Ohio on Friday. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the Chinese Communist Party invests in its auto industry to “control this industry.”\n\n“Why? They want to take over the auto industry. They want to take away these jobs,” Duffy said. As far as the Canadian trade deal, he added: “They will live to regret the day they partner with China and bring in their vehicles.”\n\nOthers say the shift is inevitable.\n\n“This is telling us that Chinese automakers continue to be really popular, and are doing better and better, and not just something that’s sold in global markets that are more marginal or less important to U.S. automakers,” said Ilaria Mazzocco, deputy director and senior fellow with the Trustee Chair in Chinese Business and Economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nWhat makes Chinese vehicles stand out?\n\nChinese-made vehicles are high-quality, stylish and inexpensive, experts say.\n\n“It’s clear that the vehicles made by Chinese brands come at a very competitive cost, but are also technologically quite desirable,” Mazzocco said. “They tend to be connected vehicles, so they have a lot of additional software capabilities that consumers seem to like. But the price point and the competitiveness are really big selling points.”\n\nThese vehicles can cost as little as $10,000 to $20,000; in the U.S., new vehicles are running close to $50,000 on average, and EVs even more so.\n\nChinese companies also have unique advantages as far as auto manufacturing and production, efficiency and making vehicles lighter, which helps extend an electrified vehicle's driving range.\n\n“They’ve found a way to make small and mid-sized cars — cars that people want — at a reasonable price,\" said Sam Fiorani, vice president at AutoForecast Solutions. \"These are the segments where GM and Ford and almost everybody else have abandoned.”\n\nMany automakers have discontinued smaller vehicles in favor of higher-margin, large sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks that are far more profitable.",

    "fullText": "Abu Dhabi-based airline Etihad was ranked the safest full-service airline in the world for 2026, becoming the first Gulf carrier to take the top spot on the annual AirlineRatings.com list.\n\nThe honor was granted thanks to a combination of the airline's young fleet, advancements in cockpit safety, the carrier's crash-free history, and the lowest incident rate per flight of any airline listed, according to Airline Ratings. To come up with its list, the company examined a series of factors like the total number of flights, fleet age, the number of serious incidents, pilot training, international safety audits, and turbulence prevention.\n\n“Overall, it is important to note that every airline featured in the 2026 list has recorded incidents over the past two years, from tail strikes to on-board fires and engine shutdowns, yet the actual incident rate per flight sits between 0.002 and 0.09 across the airlines, which is a true credit to the industry as a whole,\" Airline Ratings CEO Sharon Petersen said in a statement, adding \"All airlines in the Top 25 are world leaders in aviation safety.\"\n\nEtihad operates flights to several cities in the United States, including Boston, Chicago, New York, Washington D.C., and Atlanta with plans to launch flights to Charlotte this year. The carrier, which was also named one of Travel + Leisure readers' favorite international airlines of 2025, is known for a comfortable experience in economy and over-the-top options like The Residence, a three-room suite complete with a private bedroom, separate living area, and an ensuite shower room.\n\nHong Kong-based carrier Cathay Pacific took the second spot on the list, followed by Australian airline Qantas, Qatar Airways, and Dubai-based Emirates rounding out the top five. Air New Zealand, which took the top spot last year, came in at No. 6 this time around.\n\nAlaska Airlines was the top-ranked U.S. airline at No. 15 overall, followed by Delta Air Lines at No. 23 and American Airlines at No. 24, which suffered a notable crash early last year when an American Airlines regional jet fatally collided mid-air with a military helicopter just outside Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA).\n\nWhen it comes to the safest low-cost airlines, HK Express came out on top. The carrier is a member of the Cathay Group. Jetstar Airways, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Qantas Group, and Scoot, which is a subsidiary of Singapore Airlines, rounded out the top three. In the U.S., Southwest Airlines ranked sixth globally in the low-cost category.\n\nFlying can understandably feel nerve wracking, but there are ways to overcome that fear, including understanding the root cause, learning simple breathing techniques, and even downloading the right apps.",

    "fullText": "Jan 16 (Reuters) - A study by AI risk management platform Alethea into the surge in artificial intelligence-generated fake content, dubbed \"AI slop,\" has warned sports teams, leagues and fans of the risks posed by increasingly sophisticated digital misinformation.\n\nRetired NFL player Jason Kelce never said ​2026 Super Bowl halftime singer Bad Bunny's critics were \"a bad fit for America's future\".\n\nSan Francisco 49ers tight end George Kittle never ranted about slain ‌conservative activist Charlie Kirk and politics in football.\n\nHowever, thousands of people believed they did and that is the problem.\n\n\"Teams and players are suddenly being accused of things that are completely fabricated,\" Lisa Kaplan, ‌founder and CEO of Alethea, told Reuters on Friday, adding that the evolution of AI tools has made fake news a more daunting challenge.\n\n\"Content now looks real and is produced at a volume that makes it hard for the average person to determine if it's authentic,\" she said.\n\n\"Before, fake news often relied on human labour to repetitively copy and paste content. Today, AI can impersonate brands and create engaging images that mimic genuine announcements.\"\n\nKaplan noted that this wave of AI-generated misinformation has disrupted the traditional monetisation ⁠model of sports media. \"These networks drive engagement to questionable websites, ‌skew advertising metrics, and can even create scenarios that could manipulate betting markets,\" she added.\n\nC Shawn Eib, Alethea's Head of Investigations, described how these networks use tactics such as making multiple disjointed announcements, like the conflicting claims that former Baltimore Ravens coach ‍John Harbaugh had been hired by multiple teams at the same time.\n\n\"When a single figure appears to be linked with several teams at the same time, it quickly becomes clear that an AI system is behind the creation of these images,\" Eib explained.\n\nAI DECEPTION CAN EXPLOIT 'RAGE BAIT'\n\nThe content follows a formula: fake game updates, nonexistent celebrity feuds, manufactured scandals, and politicised ​quotes falsely attributed to star players.\n\nThe fabricated Kelce and Kittle quotes are prime examples. Both NFL stars publicly denied making comments they never said after the ‌posts went viral.\n\n\"If fans, players and even entire franchises fall prey to these manipulated narratives, it risks damaging reputations, undermining trust and even politicising sport,\" Alethea's VP of Communications Kaila Ryan said.\n\n\"Sports organisations need to proactively manage their brands and digital safety. It is crucial for teams and leagues to start monitoring these risks, work together across communications, legal and security teams, and educate fans to verify announcements from official channels,\" she added.\n\nThe business impact extends beyond reputational harm.\n\nThese networks siphon ad revenue from legitimate sports media and distort audience metrics. Some outbound links have been flagged for phishing and malicious redirects, presenting real fraud risk to fans.\n\nThe problem ⁠is not limited to the NFL. Alethea discovered similar operations targeting the NBA, WNBA, MLB, NHL, ​NASCAR, Formula 1, IndyCar and professional tennis.\n\nKaplan added that beyond monetisation, sport remains a rare cultural ​touchpoint that unites people, making them attractive targets for influence operations, and she pointed to Russia's alleged exploitation of then-49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick's 2018 'Take a Knee' protest as a precedent.\n\nIn a 2019 report, the Senate Intelligence Committee revealed that Russian trolls had focused heavily ‍on the kneeling debate as part of ⁠a broader effort to stoke racial tensions and divide the U.S. following the 2016 election.\n\n\"Kaepernick's protests were exploited for a purpose that had nothing to do with sport. Instead, it's a way of leveraging a cultural touchstone and turning it into something that polarises people,\" said Kaplan.\n\n\"Teams need to ⁠work in unison to defend their identities and protect their fans from falling victim to fraud or manipulation,\" she added, noting that the best advice for fans is to be vigilant.\n\n\"Verify breaking news ‌through official team channels, don't click links in suspicious page comments and remember that outrage is often the product, not the by-product, ‌of what you're seeing\".",

    "title": "Apple is losing its grip on the world's tech supply chain",
    "description": "Apple once set the bar for suppliers including TSMC. Now it's being unseated by Nvidia and AI cloud giants.",
    "fullText": "For over a decade, Apple sat at the center of the tech supply chain. Its enormous scale let it dictate pricing, lock up capacity, and steer the roadmaps of suppliers that made everything from chips and memory to substrates and packaging. That era is ending.\n\n\"Apple is no longer the gravitational center of the hardware universe,\" said Brad Gastwirth, global head of research and market intelligence at Circular Technology, who tracks the industry's supply chain.\n\n\"Apple still moves huge volumes and has unmatched brand strength. But the company is no longer the anchor client for fabs, substrate makers, or key component suppliers. That's a fundamental change.\"\n\nThis is important because the tech companies that control the supply chain are more likely to win. When you can order the largest amount of a key component, you get better pricing and a more reliable supply. That results in better-priced products that are available sooner than your rivals. This power is now shifting toward AI giants, including Nvidia and huge cloud players such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Google (aka \"AMG\").\n\nThe most visible sign is at TSMC, the world's largest chipmaker. It's famous for churning out cutting-edge iPhone chips, which gave Apple a huge advantage over other consumer hardware players.\n\nWhen TSMC reported results this week, it became very clear that its smartphone business is no longer its most important segment. High-performance computing — a category dominated by AI chips for companies like Nvidia and hyperscale cloud providers — now accounts for roughly 58% of TSMC's revenue, far surpassing smartphone processors.\n\nTSMC makes chips for Nvidia's AI servers, which are being snapped up in huge volumes by the cloud giants. They pack this gear into huge data centers that train and run AI models to power new services such as ChatGPT. Is that a better business than making iPhone chips?\n\nTSMC's CEO C.C. Wei answered that. He's been talking to these AI giants a lot lately. Here's what he said on this week's earnings call:\n\n\"They show me the evidence that the AI really helps their business. So they grow their business successfully and see the financial return. So I also double-checked their financial status. They are very rich.\"\n\nSuppliers go where the money is. Increasingly, the biggest Benjamins are coming from AI and cloud giants, not Apple.\n\nThis shift is rippling through the rest of the supply chain. Memory chip makers are reallocating capacity away from phones and PCs to feed AI data centers hungry for DRAM, dynamic random access memory. This is a common type of memory chip that's used in AI servers and iPhones.\n\nMemory prices have surged lately, and that's likely to push up smartphone costs and potentially squeeze margins. Nvidia has locked in long-term memory supply, leaving smartphone makers with less negotiating power.\n\n\"For the past 15 years, Apple's scale let it dictate component supply, pricing, and roadmaps,\" Gastwirth said. \"That leverage diminishes when suppliers earn higher margins and higher growth from AI customers than from smartphones.\"\n\nBottlenecks are emerging in unexpected places, too. A shortage of high-end glass cloth, a critical input for chip substrates, has suppliers prioritizing AI customers who pre-pay and sign multi-year contracts.\n\nApple, which uses these substrates across nearly all its products, is now competing with AI chipmakers for limited supply and even sending engineers to help smaller suppliers qualify alternative materials, according to a report this week from Nikkei.\n\nManufacturing partners are also re-prioritizing. Foxconn, once synonymous with iPhone assembly, now generates more revenue from AI servers than from consumer electronics. Its fastest-growing customers are hyperscalers and Nvidia, not Apple.\n\nNone of this makes Apple irrelevant. The company remains one of the world's largest buyers of components. However, in a supply chain increasingly shaped by AI, pricing, allocation, and capacity planning are being set elsewhere — and Apple is learning what it's like to be just another very large customer.\n\n\"In the 2010s, Apple set the pace for the supply chain,\" Gastwirth said. \"In the late 2020s, Nvidia, hyperscalers, and AI infrastructure now dictate pricing, allocation, and long‑term capacity planning.\"\n\nApple didn't respond to a request for comment on Friday.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "Writing at the end of the world, from Hveragerði, Iceland",
    "fullText": "It’s now been roughly six months since I slowed down this newsletter to give me space to think and reconsider.\n\nI’ve done this before – several times in the history of this website, in fact. Sometimes the blog has stayed sporadic for a couple of years. Sometimes only a few weeks passed until I found my motivation again.\n\nWriting just for yourself is its own kind of fun. Whatever else is going on in my life, even when the mental landscape that is my blog or newsletter is lying fallow and slowly regaining its fertility, I still update it occasionally because writing is both fun and a tool that helps me make sense of the world around me.\n\nBut writing – any media – only reaches its full potential if it’s done with an audience – not just for an audience, but written as a part of the field or community in discourse with others.\n\nAnd that kind of writing has to have a purpose. It needs to be of service and add value to the field that frames it.\n\nThat’s the bargain. That’s why people read what you write and, occasionally, help support the writer in some way.\n\nWhen you feel that you’re burning out on writing, one of the possible reasons is that the bargain that’s specific to the writing you’ve been doing isn’t working for you.\n\nWhen an audience wants anger and hostility, feeding that can be the writing bargain you offer and the audience will often reward you with attention, praise, and waves of hostility that lift you up, as if it were support, because the poison is directed elsewhere.\n\nBut the poison is still there. Feeding hostility in others requires feeding the hostility in yourself.\n\nThis is why I’ve been struggling for a while now to write constructively about tech and “AI” specifically. Constructive criticism has a purpose, but we’re at a point in the current iteration of “irrational exuberance” where the stakes for the pro- side are so high that nothing constructive registers and what we’re left with are anger and the expert chroniclers of “just how bad is it anyway?”\n\nAcademics and researchers who specialise in machine learning and related fields catalogue the hype and promises. The few genuinely numerate journalists, such as Ed Zitron, do the maths on just how big and potentially catastrophic the bubble is. We’re at a point where the finances, environmental impact (which is currently expressing itself mostly on a community level), workplace dysfunction, and outright debasement of the entire software industry’s user experience mean that there is simply no reasonable justification for supporting these tools. They are obviously destructive.\n\nSensible criticism is unnecessary in this environment. You need chroniclers – the experts who are cataloguing the various examples that show just how damaging these systems are – and you need the analysts – the journalists who can tell us just how many orders of magnitude the industry numbers are off by – but there is little outright need for low-key constructive criticism.\n\nBecause the correct response to those who are explicitly collaborating with authoritarians and fascists, as much of the “AI” industry is doing, isn’t to tell them that their tech is likely to cause substantial delays at the organisations that adopt it.\n\nThe correct response is to tell them to fuck off and then move on.\n\nWallowing in the anger isn’t productive. Mockery always works, but I’ve never been much of a humour writer so I already know that I should be leaving that kind of writing to others.\n\nSo I had to do a bit of contemplation. I’m not a particularly fast thinker. I tend to linger on details for too long and overthink things, but with enough time I get there and I think it’s time to put this newsletter back on a schedule. I’m putting together something that wraps up my coverage of “AI” specifically, at least for now, but other than that I’d like to continue my explorations of the impact of and problems caused by tech, but with a slight shift in focus:\n\nSoftware as a mass medium and the effect it has on other media.\n\nThe reason is straightforward: pretending software isn’t a medium, pretending that it doesn’t have \n\nIt doesn’t work for those of us who have been making software.\n\nIt doesn’t work for those of us who need to use the software.\n\nIt doesn’t work for the societies that have, inadvisedly, come to depend on what’s effectively a bunch of flared jeans designers cosplaying as engineers as the fundamental drivers of their economies.\n\nPretending this made-up bullshit makes sense doesn’t work any more. At least, it doesn’t work any more for those of us who have avoided getting caught up in the bubble irrationality.\n\nThe best way to deal with software – making it, using it, dealing with it as a creative medium, coping with it as a maker of other creative media – is to understand it as it really is:\n\nA creative medium driven by fashion that operates with limited regard for practicality or productivity.\n\nThis isn’t far off from what I was already doing. Systems-thinking is still one of the lenses I apply and I’m firmly of the school of media analysis that takes business factors and processes into account, so it’s mostly a question of broadening the focus slightly, coupled with a small change in perspective.\n\nMaybe it won’t work and I’ll have to rethink things again, which is fine. Maybe it’ll only work for a few weeks until the topic runs out of steam, which is also fine.\n\nBut at least it should be a bit fun.\n\nI’ve finally released print versions of all my books:\n\nIf you’d like to support this newsletter and make it likelier that I continue to publish in print in the future, this would be the time to order a copy. 🙂",

People go through pro-youth academies and stuff, people go through grassroots clubs like myself.\n\n\"Everyone has a different way and, if everyone made it the same way, it'd be boring, wouldn't it?\"\n\nBowie's route to the top also took a detour to London and a time on the wings before only really making the striker role his own after his move to Hibs 18 months ago.\n\nAfter leaving Rovers for Fulham in 2020, he was loaned out to Northampton Town, where he was playing out of position.\n\n\"I was never an out-and-out striker,\" Bowie explains. \"I played on the wing when I was at Northampton on loan for two seasons, which I played almost 100 games. Imagine me on the wing, this tall lad just running about.\n\n\"Then I came here and they were like, we see you as a number nine. Just to put that belief into me, to play as a number nine and obviously I'm still young, fairly young, learning my trade. So hopefully I can just do as much as I can and progress.\"\n\nA wonder goal against Partizan Belgrade in Conference League qualifying in August brought Bowie greater attention and that has continued as he has notched up nine goals in 28 appearances so far this term.\n\nHis strength and prowess has led to speculation about interest from Celtic, Rangers and top clubs in England.\n\nHowever, in this World Cup year, the Hibs striker has only one goal - and that is to try to convince national head coach Steve Clarke he is worthy of a place on the plane to the Americas.\n\n\"Anyone that's been involved with Scotland over the last year, they're lying if they don't say 'I want to be there',\" Bowie says.\n\n\"Obviously I want to be there, but I just need to focus on now and what I'm doing here and hopefully that'll lead me to getting on that flight.\n\n\"Last summer, it was different, because it was just friendly matches. But it just sort of shows you're not that far away.\n\n\"Obviously the level of some of the players in there, you go in and you're like 'oh no, am I good enough' and you question it. You just need to tell yourself 'I'm good enough to be here and I've deserved my chance'.\"\n\nVisit our Hibs page for all the latest news, analysis and fan views\n\nGet Hibs news notifications in the BBC Sport app",

    "title": "When I left the Marines, I struggled to adjust to civilian life. Finding work in the real world was the most challenging.",
    "description": "I left the Marines to become an entrepreneur. While the skills I learned in the military helped my transition, I struggled with civilian work life.",
    "fullText": "When I left the Marines, it was not because I disliked the work. I had originally planned to serve 20 years and retire in uniform, but over time, new interests began pulling me in different directions.\n\nThe Marines are a 24-hour responsibility. Once you commit, your personal ambitions take a backseat. Eventually, I reached a point where I wanted to explore those ambitions — specifically, entrepreneurship — while I was still young enough to act on them.\n\nI made the decision to leave the service during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic — even though the civilian job market felt uncertain, and many encouraged me to stay.\n\nBut retired service members who had built businesses offered a different message. They helped me realize that the military equips people with more transferable skills than they often think. The transition resources on base reinforced that point, so I felt ready to move on.\n\nIn the Marines, I worked on amphibious operations and rotated through several roles. That variety helped me grow, but it also made choosing a civilian path harder.\n\nI had multiple strengths and enjoyed different aspects of my job, which meant I didn't leave with a single, defined plan. I had possibilities, but no fixed route.\n\nOnce I committed to transitioning, I wrote my goals down and worked toward them before my end date. Even with that preparation, the hardest part was simply starting. In the military, the steps are usually provided. In civilian life, you take every step on your own.\n\nI started to feel directionless, taking jobs in truck driving, sales, and real estate.\n\nI didn't realize how prepared I was until I stepped into civilian life. Public speaking, counseling skills, emotional discipline, and the habit of double-checking paperwork all became essential. Writing things down remained one of my strongest habits.\n\nThose small details sharpened my mind and made me more reliable. Clear communication and consistent structure helped me as I moved toward consulting and supporting clients.\n\nMy experience also helped me advance at key moments. One employer took a chance on me specifically because I had served in the military. Veterans continued to mentor me even when they could not offer opportunities. When I started consulting, I leaned heavily on my military experience, especially in developing structure and communication systems for clients.\n\nWorking multiple military jobs gave me broad experience, but entrepreneurship requires long-term focus. If you jump between strengths too quickly, you never grow one fully. I had to learn to slow myself down and commit to the task.\n\nThe cultural difference between military and civilian workplaces was larger than I expected. In the Marines, keeping everyone informed is a core rule. In civilian environments, information moves at different speeds. People communicate based on their roles, goals, or personal habits. Especially in smaller workplaces, communication can be inconsistent. I had to learn not to take those gaps personally.\n\nAccountability also functions differently. In the Marines, you trust that everyone is committed to the same mission. In civilian workplaces, people have different motivations. Some individuals seek career advancement, others desire stability, and others simply need a steady income. I struggled to adapt to that.\n\nThe military provided me with leadership experience, diverse skills, and a foundation that I still rely on. But I wish there had been stronger bridges between the military and civilian companies. Transitioning often felt like a jump when it should've felt like a path forward.\n\nLeaving the Marines did not mean starting over. It meant learning how to translate discipline, structure, and communication into a world that operates in a different way.\n\nThe biggest lesson was understanding that you cannot transition alone. You need civilians who can explain the environment you are entering and veterans who can share how they adapted.\n\nMy transition taught me that the qualities that made me effective in uniform still matter, but they must be applied with flexibility and adaptability. Civilian strategy requires patience, influence, effective communication, and a willingness to take the initiative and build your own steps.\n\nThe challenge is real, but so is the opportunity to rebuild with purpose.",

The market has also drawn scrutinty lately. Recent trades involving the US raid on Venezuela have raised speculation about insider trading.",

With the name making headlines across the world, the app's makers decided to ditch the catchy moniker for the duller \"Demumu\" for its next release.\n\nThe famously laidback Hollywood star Matthew McConaughey is trying to patent his voice and image to protect himself from AI, including his famous catchphrase \"all right, all right, all right\" from the iconic slacker movie \"Dazed and Confused\".\n\nSo unauthorised use of his Texan drawl will soon be officially no longer cool, man.",

    "fullText": "Formula 1’s financial strength continues to rise, with four of the sport’s biggest names appearing in Sportico’s 2026 list of the world’s 100 highest-paid athletes.\n\nThe figures show how the championship’s global growth has helped its stars rival football, basketball, and golf’s biggest earners.\n\nThe rankings reflect athlete income during 2025, combining race salaries, prize money, and commercial endorsements. With sponsorship deals expanding and more fans engaging across new markets, Formula 1 has become one of the most lucrative sports in the world.\n\nLewis Hamilton and Max Verstappen both placed inside the top 15, while Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri also featured in the top 100. Together, the four drivers earned over $280 million during the year.\n\nSportico’s latest report confirmed that four current Formula 1 drivers ranked among the highest-earning athletes in 2025. Each of them combined on-track success with strong brand partnerships, showing how the sport’s appeal continues to grow beyond racing.\n\nLewis Hamilton ranked 11th overall with total earnings of $100 million. His salary accounted for 70 million, while endorsements contributed another 30 million. The seven-time world champion remains one of the most recognisable athletes in global sport, with sponsorships spanning fashion, technology, and environmental projects.\n\nMax Verstappen followed closely in 15th place with total earnings of $83 million. He earned $75 million in salary and $8 million through endorsements. His continued dominance underlined Red Bull’s financial commitment to rewarding sustained excellence on the track.\n\nLando Norris secured the 32nd position with $59 million in total income. His salary stood at $54 million, while commercial deals added another $5 million. The McLaren driver has become one of the most marketable young stars in the paddock, known for his personality and growing international following.\n\nOscar Piastri completed the list of Formula 1 drivers at 93rd place. The Australian talent earned $35 million in salary and $3 million from endorsements, bringing his total for 2025 to $38 million. His rapid rise highlights the increasing value of emerging drivers in today’s global Formula 1 economy.\n\nThe inclusion of Hamilton, Verstappen, Norris, and Piastri reflects Formula 1’s wider commercial expansion. Major television deals, sponsorship growth, and increasing popularity across North America, Asia, and the Middle East have strengthened the sport’s financial position.\n\nHamilton and Verstappen remain the financial leaders of the grid, while Norris and Piastri represent a new generation of talent shaping the sport’s future both on and off the track.\n\nWith Formula 1’s global reach continuing to grow, its top drivers are now among the world’s most financially successful athletes.",

    "fullText": "Max Verstappen acknowledged that Red Bull’s prospects this season are an “unknown” until the cars take to the track, given the regulation shake-up.\n\nNew engine and chassis regulations threaten to alter the order on the grid in 2026, as Red Bull builds its own engine for the first time alongside Ford.\n\nRed Bull unveiled their striking new car livery at a launch event in Detroit on Thursday night and four-time F1 world champion Verstappen, who just missed out on a fifth consecutive title by two points last year, admitted the drivers will need some time to adjust to the new rules, which include “active aero” and “overtake mode” to replace DRS.\n\n“It’s all still a bit unknown,” Verstappen said. “Of course, it’s a very big, big change with the engine, the car, as you can see also the dimension of the car has changed a bit.\n\n“So for us drivers as well initially, we’ll take a bit of time to adjust. And that’s why it’s very important during the test days that we are getting our laps, so we can optimise everything as well as possible.”\n\nVerstappen was present alongside team principal Laurent Mekies and new teammate Isack Hadjar – his fourth different teammate in 15 months – as Red Bull revealed their throwback livery on Thursday.\n\n“The gloss is cool, it is a more retro look, the colour is really bold and blue, I really like it,” Verstappen said. “Seeing it in real life was special and I was really impressed and surprised by how much of a change it is.\n\n“The whole look brings back a lot of great memories of back in the day when I was just starting out in F1 and everything was new.\n\n“I’m excited to drive a car with a completely different look. I’m not sure the mechanics will be happy about the time it’ll take to keep this clean!\n\n“But it’s going to look really slick and will be nice for everyone to see out on track.”\n\nThe first of three pre-season tests takes place in private in Barcelona from 26-30 January. The new season starts on 8 March with the Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne.",

    "title": "The peril ‘true fans’ now face after Fifa’s World Cup ticket deadline",
    "description": "Many England fans have had to commit to World Cup tickets after Fifa’s deadline for initial applications passed on Tuesday, though how much they’ll have to pay – whether $60 or $7,000 - is still unknown",
    "fullText": "The deadline for initial World Cup ticket applications passed on Tuesday, with many England fans having no idea what they’ll end up paying, despite having to commit. The difference could end up being thousands of dollars, but they now can’t cancel.\n\nSome fans eligible for the limited $60 (£44.75) “category 4” tickets will still be sitting near relatives in the same section, facing thousands of dollars in difference. There have been many similar stories. A number of supporters naturally rushed to book already expensive hotels and flights when the schedule was confirmed on 6 December, only to make the difficult decision to cancel once prices were actually announced a few days later. A new system, which represents an inexplicable shift from all recent tournaments, has ensured some tickets have gone up to five times the price of Qatar. The initial backlash forced Fifa into a minor climbdown, where 10 per cent of tickets for all qualified teams – the Participating Member Associations (PMA) – were brought into a fixed $60 “category 4”. There’s an immense jump to category 3.\n\nDiscussion groups involving members of the England Supporters Travel Club (ESTC) feature comments like “obscene”, “blatant exploitation”, a “preying on loyalty and the feeling this is priceless”, and ultimately: “Fifa can stick it. They’ve ruined the best tournament in the world.”\n\nAll of which represents a doubt and uncertainty that cuts a very different tone to Fifa’s bombastic press release about “500 million ticket requests” and how this set “a new benchmark for demand in the history of world sport”.\n\nSupporter groups have nevertheless expressed cynicism at those figures, and the manner in which they escalated over the 33-day application period, despite Fifa stating that unique credit card data has been used for validation.\n\nSuch claims don’t mesh with experience on the ground. Data from Football Supporters Europe (FSE) – who represent fan groups across the continent – suggests that the level of interest is comparable with Qatar. That tournament barely saw any major fan group travel outside Argentina, Mexico, Morocco and Saudi Arabia. That might end up a concern given that Fifa said on Tuesday the highest number of applications outside the hosts came from Germany, England, Brazil, Spain, Portugal, Argentina and Colombia.\n\nIt is certainly a concern as regards how this tournament will feel, look and sound, and whether there will be enough emotionally invested fans to create the atmosphere that really amplifies a World Cup. Essentially, what Argentina brought to 2014 and 2022.\n\nFans who actually have confirmed orders laugh wryly at the Fifa sign-off – typically underneath figures reaching around $7,000, potentially breaching many credit limits before hotels and flights – that reads: “Thanks for being a true fan!”\n\nSuch marketing speak was echoed by president Gianni Infantino in Tuesday’s statement: “I would like to thank and congratulate football fans everywhere for this extraordinary response. Knowing how much this tournament means to people around the world, our only regret is that we cannot welcome every fan inside the stadiums.”\n\nExcept, this gratitude is apparently expressed in prices that ensure only a certain tax band can actually afford to be welcomed inside the stadiums, in a system that doesn’t seem to truly recognise this “meaning”.\n\nAs written in The Independent before, the entire story articulates a central tension in 2026 football, which is that between its cultural importance and the will to make it a mere entertainment commodity. Fifa, officially a not-for-profit charity, seems to very much be leaning towards the latter.\n\nDuly, there is a deepening anger at the lack of attention to a genuine social issue within this. The Independent has already reported how the normally protected accessibility tickets are appearing on Fifa’s own resale site at six times the price, amid the controversy that carers will also be charged in a decision that goes against the body’s own statutes on human rights.\n\nThose within Fifa privately stress that the US hosting has thrown up more legal complications than any previous World Cup, especially with how legislation prevents requests for proof of disability, leading to the current system.\n\nFan groups counter that this is another case of “a pinch of truth being expanded to justify the whole ticketing policy”. They argue that Fifa knew all of this years in advance, so could have come up with multiple different solutions or guardrails, and that there’s nothing to prevent making a companion ticket free of charge or putting accessibility in the cheapest category.\n\nThey proffer that the same applies to the ongoing debate over the US “secondary market” – in other words, legalised touting – that Fifa insiders say “throws up completely new challenges than anything we’ve faced before”.\n\nAgain, multiple proactive solutions were possible, including protecting PMA tickets from transfer. There’s instead a feeling that Fifa is just seeking to earn resale differences themselves rather than tackle the issue.\n\nThat runs alongside ongoing frustration that the FA are not more outspoken on behalf of England fans. The body’s general stance is that the idiosyncratic top-down nature of football politics means they can be most effective in raising issues behind the scenes. It’s understood the FA did relay concerns to Fifa amid the initial backlash, and that this played a part in the creation of category 4 tickets.\n\nHowever, the highly limited number has created a headache for the FA, as travelling fans who fall just outside the caps needed for $60 tickets face ballots to see whether they are in the much more expensive category 2 rather than 3. Such fans pay £70 every two years to be a member of the ESTC and generally go to at least 11 away games over four years, in the hope that such loyalty will be rewarded, only to be faced with what they feel is “exploitation”.\n\nThat has fostered further frustration with the FA strategy, and questions like “what results can they actually point to?” Ultimately, the big nations have never even tried to properly challenge Infantino’s Fifa as a bloc.\n\nFor the FA’s part, they have been more proactive than many of their counterparts, amid a lament that the initial backlash has waned. Belgium and Denmark have instead parroted Fifa’s lines about raising money for the global game and the need to conform to the US market.\n\nSuch responses also cut to the core of all this, Fifa’s power structure, and how it was decided. Pricing ultimately came from those close to Infantino, with very little information dispersed – even to the Fifa Council.\n\nWhen pressed, insiders ultimately resort to those same justifications: raising money for the game, and “demand”.\n\nThat’s despite Fifa’s immense surpluses coming from the old pricing system, and the key point that they just do not have to concern themselves with demand. What’s more, no previous World Cup has conformed to the host market.\n\nBut what of the future? As one senior official said, “the sad part is that it’s probably done”. In other words, the prices are set for this tournament. Just one of many further questions is what happens if it’s a commercial success.",

    "description": "Airline Ratings has revealed its Top 25 Safest Full-Service and Low-Cost Airlines for 2026, highlighting excellence in turbulence prevention, crew expertise, and overall safety.",
    "fullText": "AirlineRatings.com, the world’s only airline safety and product rating website, has announced its Top 25 Safest Full-Service and Top 25 Safest Low-Cost Airlines for 2026 from the 320 airlines it monitors.\n\nIn compiling the list, CEO Sharon Petersen stressed that it is important for the travelling public to understand just how narrow the margins are between the world’s safest airlines, and that small numerical differences should not be interpreted as gaps in safety. She explained:\n\n“What stands out this year is how little separates the leaders. Less than four points covered positions one through 14, and at the very top the margins were even tighter, with just 1.3 points separating positions one through six in the full service category. We may be reaching a point where traditional rankings risk being misleading, and where grouping airlines into performance tiers provides a more accurate reflection of reality. All airlines in the Top 25 are world leaders in aviation safety, and claims that one is significantly safer or less safe than another are both sensationalist and false.”\n\nExplaining the methodology behind the rankings, she said:\n\n“Much of our criteria remains consistent year on year and considers incident rates adjusted for the total number of flights, fleet age, serious incidents, pilot training and international safety audits. One change for this year is that we are placing a greater emphasis on turbulence prevention, as it remains the leading cause of in-flight injuries. To support this, we consider an airline’s participation in the IATA Turbulence Aware1 programme or equivalent, as well as the Airline Ratings onboard safety audit. Transparency from airlines is also critical to this process.\n\nOn changes to the World’s Safest Full-Service Airlines list for 2026, Petersen said:\n\n“This is the first year a Gulf carrier has taken the number one spot. Etihad achieved this through a combination of factors: a young fleet, advancements in cockpit safety, particularly around turbulence, a crash-free history, and the lowest incident rate per flight of any airline on the list. The airline also participated in our independent onboard safety audit and demonstrated excellent adherence to turbulence management in the cabin.\n\n“Other notable inclusions are STARLUX and Fiji Airways, both making their list debut. While we generally would not include a relatively young airline such as STARLUX, their approach to safety and transparency is exceptional, and the fact other leading airlines talk about them really says it all. Another change that will be welcomed by our readers is the reinstatement of Singapore Airlines, which was excluded in 2025 following a serious turbulence related incident. After visiting their safety and training centre and holding extensive discussions with their operations team, we are pleased to have them back on the list.”\n\nflydubai (Now considered a full-service airline and will be assessed accordingly in future publications.)\n\nIn ranking the world’s safest low-cost airlines* Petersen said:\n\n“Notable changes this year include the inclusion of Spring Airlines China, the first Chinese airline to appear on any of our rankings, and airBaltic, which has made a significant jump into the top 10. HK Express claimed the top accolade for a second time, driven by a modern fleet, exceptionally low incident rate, and an almost flawless onboard safety audit. Given Hong Kong’s stringent incident reporting requirements, this low incident rate and absence of serious incidents genuinely reflects a highly disciplined and well-run operation.”\n\nShe continued, “Overall, it is important to note that every airline featured in the 2026 list has recorded incidents over the past two years, from tail strikes to on-board fires and engine shutdowns, yet the actual incident rate per flight sits between 0.002 and 0.09 across the airlines, which is a true credit to the industry as a whole.”\n\nIn the modern era of aviation, where serious incidents are rare, inclusion in the Top 25 reflects not just excellence in aircraft and operations, but the crucial role of skilled aircrew and robust safety practices across the airline, reinforcing that safety today is defined by consistency, culture, adaptation and effective risk management across millions of flights.\n\nFor media enquiries, please email: [email protected]\n\n1: Airline Ratings is not affiliated with the IATA Turbulence Aware programme.\n\n2: Excludes Delta Air Lines' main subsidiary Endeavor Air.\n\n3 : Excludes American Airlines' main subsidiaries being Envoy Air, Piedmont Airlines, and PSA Airlines which all operate under the American Eagle brand.\n\n4: Excludes AirAsia Cambodia due to only 2 aircraft.\n\n5: Excludes Ryanair Subsidiary ‘Buzz’.\n\n6: Excludes Volaris Costa Rica and Volaris El Salvador due to fleet size.\n\n*: It is important to note that airlines operating fewer than 25 aircraft were excluded from consideration in the Low Cost Carrier category to allow focus on larger, high-frequency operations. Further, where applicable, Airline Ratings have evaluated the performance of individual airlines with their own Air Operator Certificates (AOCs) within a group, since not all group members perform equally or hold the same international audit certifications\n\nHave questions or want to share your thoughts?",

    "fullText": "Move comes as calls for Australia-style social media ban for under-16s grow around world\n\nTikTok will begin to roll out new age-verification technology across the EU in the coming weeks, as calls grow for an Australia-style social media ban for under-16s in countries including the UK.\n\nByteDance-owned TikTok, and other major platforms popular with young people such as YouTube, are coming under increasing pressure to better identify and remove accounts belonging to children.\n\nThe system, which has been quietly piloted in the EU over the past year, analyses profile information, posted videos and behavioural signals to predict whether an account may be belong to a user under the age of 13.\n\nAs well as analysing information the account holder provides about themselves, the technology looks at behaviour such as the videos a user publishes, and “other on-platform behaviour”.\n\nTikTok said accounts flagged by the system would be reviewed by specialist moderators rather than face an automatic ban, and may then be removed.\n\nIt also said users would have an opportunity to appeal against the removal of an account if an error had been made.\n\nOptions for age identification offered by TikTok during the appeal process include facial age estimation by the verification company Yoti, credit card authorisation or government-approved identification.\n\nThe European pilot led to the removal of thousands of accounts.\n\nThe rollout of the system comes as European authorities scrutinise how platforms verify users’ ages under data protection rules.\n\nTikTok said its system complied with data and privacy laws. “The prediction of the likelihood that someone is under the age of 13 is not used for purposes other than to decide whether to send an account to human moderators and to monitor and improve the technology,” the company said in a blogpost.\n\n“By adopting this approach, we are able to deliver safety for teens in a privacy-preserving manner. We take our responsibility to protect our community, and teens in particular, incredibly seriously.”\n\nIt said other features to protect younger users on its service included not allowing under-16s to direct-message, while under-18s have a 60-minute screen-time limit and do not receive notifications “after bed time”.\n\nMeta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, also uses Yoti to verify users’ ages on Facebook.\n\nIn December, Australia implemented a social media ban for people under the age of 16. On Thursday, the country’s eSafety commissioner revealed that more than 4.7m accounts had been removed across 10 platforms – including YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Snap and Facebook – since the ban was implemented on 10 December.\n\nEarlier this week, Keir Starmer told MPs he was open to a social media ban for young people in the UK after becoming concerned about the amount of time children and teenagers were spending on their smartphones.\n\nThe prime minister told Labour MPs he had become alarmed at reports of five-year-olds spending hours in front of screens each day, as well as increasingly worried about the damage social media was doing to under-16s.\n\nStarmer has previously opposed banning social media for children, believing such a move would be difficult to police and could push teenagers towards the dark web.\n\nEarlier this month, Ellen Roome, whose 14-year-old son Jools Sweeney died after an online challenge went wrong, called for more rights for parents to access social media accounts of their children if they die.\n\nThe European parliament is pushing for age limits on social media, while Denmark wants to ban social media for those under 15.\n\nTikTok told Reuters the new technology was built specifically to comply with the EU’s regulatory requirements. The company has worked with Ireland’s Data Protection Commission, its lead EU privacy regulator, while developing the system.\n\nIn 2023, a Guardian investigation found that moderators were being told to allow under-13s to stay on the platform if they claimed their parents were overseeing their accounts.",

    "title": "How Semafor turned Washington into a profit center",
    "description": "Semafor CEO Justin Smith explains how his company bucked industry trends by focusing on Washington, DC, and the \"global leadership class.\"",
    "fullText": "The news business is gloomy these days, and lots of companies are bracing for more grim news: Changes in the distribution landscape are making it harder to get the news you produce in front of people who want to consume it, which means you have less revenue to make more compelling news. Which can lead to a grim cycle.\n\nBut last week, Semafor, which pitches itself as a news outlet for the global leadership class, said it was bucking the trend: The startup, launched by former BuzzFeed editor Ben Smith and former Bloomberg executive Justin Smith in 2022, had turned a profit in 2025.\n\nThe speed at which Semafor has made this work is surprising. The business plan is less so: Semafor, like other recent successful news startups, has built itself by aiming squarely at Washington, DC, and positioning itself as a way for advertisers to reach powerful CEOs and government officials who do business there.\n\nI talked to Semafor CEO Justin Smith (he's not related to Ben Smith) about why the Washington market is lucrative and how his company thinks it can make more money in the future. You can listen to our entire conversation on my Channels podcast; what follows are edited excerpts from our chat.\n\nPeter Kafka: You folks just announced that you were profitable last year, your third year in operation. You also announced that you had raised another $30 million, and made a profit of $2 million on $40 million in revenue. If you're making money, why did you raise more money?\n\nJustin Smith: If you've been in the media business for 30 years, you know the media business is pretty unpredictable. Just because you've had a good couple of years, and you've developed what we think is a really interesting model — if there's a chance to raise money, with good long-term investors, to accelerate the things that are working, it's a good idea.\n\nWe feel like it's taken three years, but we've got the foundation of what we believe is an interesting innovation in the media space. It's a new formula that is working, and we feel like we can extend it across the world and across new markets, and that's what we're going to use the new capital for.\n\nSemafor has leaned heavily into events since you launched, and you say 50% of your revenue comes from events. But that's a very hard business to scale. How do you think you'll grow?\n\nWe did almost a hundred events this year. But a lot of the energy and focus of our event strategy is around some of the bigger convenings that we do. As we go forward, the idea is not necessarily to go from a hundred to 200 to 300 events.\n\nThe strategy is much more likely to be to build a series of tentpoles that themselves become larger, more significant, more valuable commercially, more influential editorially. That's how you scale it.\n\nI've seen people talking about your ambition to take on Davos, the annual global business/policy conference happening this month. Is that a real plan?\n\nWhen we started Semafor, in the original business plan deck, we saw an opportunity to build a leading CEO convening in the United States. We looked at the US market, and we thought, \"It's interesting. This is the largest economy in the world, and there is not a dominant leading CEO convening platform.\"\n\nWe thought that was an interesting fact, which presented an opportunity. So from the very beginning, we envisioned building this from scratch. And we identified Washington, DC, as the best location to do this, which was also a little bit of an unusual choice.\n\nDC's historically not been a place where CEOs travel. It's not been historically a center of business, but that of course has been changing across the last five to seven years: The role of geopolitics in the boardroom, the rise of regulation — all these different trends have converged and now CEOs from both the United States and across the world find themselves in Washington three, four, five, 10 times a year. And we were fortunate because we made that bet.\n\nPeter: You've been describing a business that's very DC-based. You are based in DC. It's really striking that some of the most successful media startups of the last few years — you guys, Axios, Punchbowl, Puck, to some extent — are all making money or trying to make money in Washington, by matching advertisers with powerful people. How much bigger can that market get?\n\nIt's effectively a B2B marketplace. What's sometimes confusing to people is that many of these news properties, including Semafor, are consumer-facing now — consumer web pages and consumer-focused newsletters. But since the audience that they're appealing to is this segment of this leadership audience, it allows for a much more targeted type of business monetization.\n\nIn this case, it's the corporate affairs market, which is largely corporate reputation. There's also a bit of advocacy advertising.\n\nFacebook saying, \"We believe healthy regulation is a great idea.\"\n\nExactly. This market has existed for a long time, and there was a whole predecessor group of brands before Politico and Axios. You may remember Roll Call, or the Hill, or National Journal. Those were some of the most successful and profitable and commercially viable media businesses around.\n\nObviously, these new digital disruptors came along and stole the market from those legacy players. But I think what also happened is that the market grew really, really dramatically because the intersection of government and business has become more pronounced and more intense.\n\nI think the stakes have gotten higher and higher and higher for companies operating in the US, and their needs to communicate their corporate brand positions have gotten more urgent.\n\nI had heard early on that you guys were going to make your version of the networks' Sunday shows, which is fueled by that same economy.\n\nThose were some of the most profitable TV shows on television back in the day. They probably still are today.\n\nYou guys have not launched your version of a Sunday show. Do you think that's something you'll try?\n\nWe actually started with a video investment. We thought, \"Let's see if we can produce this opinion leader video.\" We tried, and were unable to really figure it out, and we ended up killing it within six months or so.\n\nBecause as a startup, I think that's probably one of the better decisions we made — just to focus on the stuff that's working, and stop doing the stuff that's not working.",

    "fullText": "Zoe Stratford took two weeks to bask in England's Women's Rugby World Cup glory.\n\nShortly after lifting the world title in front of nearly 82,000 people at Twickenham, the England captain and her club and country team-mate Natasha Hunt were picking up something else - the keys to a new business venture.\n\nWhile each of the Red Roses earned a World Cup-winning bonus of £20,000 and the most lucrative of their central contracts are worth just short of £50,000, all of England's squad have to make plans for life after rugby.\n\nWing Abby Dow, 28, retired after the tournament to pursue a career in mechanical engineering. Hooker May Campbell combines her rugby with working at a crypto payment company. Amy Cokayne is a police officer in the Royal Air Force.\n\nLock Stratford and scrum-half Hunt have chosen a different route, opening a coffee shop together.\n\nThe pair have premises close to Kingsholm, where they run out for PWR side Gloucester-Hartpury.\n\n\"It's been incredibly fun renovating it, putting our ideas into it,\" said Stratford.\n\n\"With rugby we had so much intensity coming into the World Cup. Afterwards we were a bit exhausted with it, so this gave us a new lease of life.\n\n\"We didn't just have rugby, we could put our energy into this coffee shop and making it ours.\"\n\nTheir shop is called 'MoZo' - an amalgamation of Stratford's first name and Hunt's nickname 'Mo'.\n\nStratford says that the venture has given her a valuable distraction from sport, allowing her to switch off when she is away from the pitch.\n\n\"It is super important to have these other interests,\" she added.\n\n\"I think the reason so many of the girls are successful is because they have interests besides rugby. The coffee shop give us that release.\"\n\nBoth Stratford and Hunt have been getting stuck in on the shop floor working shifts, including on the day of Gloucester men's match against Castres in early December.\n\n\"I am terrible at coffee art,\" Stratford said when asked about the skill of making patterns and pictures in the frothy top of drinks.\n\n\"I stick to the till. Mo is very good though. Sometimes I mess the stock up and she is pulling her hair out with me, but it is cool.\n\n\"It is something we have wanted to do and hopefully we will grow it.\"\n\nThree-time defending champions Gloucester-Hartpury have won all seven of their PWR games this season, while both Stratford and Hunt were named in a 47-strong England training camp this month.\n\nEngland begin the defence of their Women's Six Nations title against Ireland at Allianz Stadium in Twickenham on 11 April.",

While world models possess this capability, they most often require action labels, that can be complex to obtain at scale. This motivates the learning of latent action models, that can learn an action space from videos alone. Our work addresses the problem of learning latent actions world models on in-the-wild videos, expanding the scope of existing works that focus on simple robotics simulations, video games, or manipulation data. While this allows us to capture richer actions, it also introduces challenges stemming from the video diversity, such as environmental noise, or the lack of a common embodiment across videos.",

    "title": "The Mind as a City: A Systems View of Consciousness, by Ian Reppel",
    "description": "Ideas for a Changing World.",
    "fullText": "Ian Reppel is an Argentina-based independent researcher and audio engineer with a PhD in theoretical physics and has spent nearly fifteen years working in technology across Europe and Latin America. He writes at ianreppel.org on quantum computing, machine learning, leadership, and psychology, with a particular interest in how technology, incentives, and leadership shape human agency. He is currently writing a book on ethical product psychology, examining how psychology can be used to help people flourish without defaulting to manipulation while still supporting profitable products that make a positive difference. He also runs his own music studio, Crow Oak.\n\nThe following essay by Ian was an honorable mention in the 2025 Berggruen Prize Essay Competition.\n\nConsciousness is best understood as a system, not a single entity. Rather\nthan a single switch, it is an entire control panel with many switches and dials that can selectively disable or boost individual components or connections yielding different experiences we can probe in the lab. The systems view provides a cross-species perspective on consciousness, backed by philosophical traditions from across the globe, that also extends to artificial intelligence.\n\nConsciousness reveals itself at the very edges: when we lose it, when we enter an altered state through meditation or drugs, or when we observe its behavioural effects in other species. If consciousness were a single switch, anæsthesia would turn it off and on again cleanly, and every species would have the same neural wiring. Neither is true. Human anæsthetics alter wakefulness, the contents of experience, self-monitoring, or the ability to report to various degrees depending on the drug, its dose, or the patient’s cortical state. That suggests a composite mechanism: a system of interacting subsystems with failure modes that can be induced selectively. Such a systems view is agnostic of the underlying neural architecture or layout, so it maps well to non-human brains, too. All that matters in the systems view are the functions that make experience at all possible.\n\nWhile there is not a clear definition of consciousness that both scientists and philosophers can agree upon, one area where most can agree on a clear before and after, that is of consciousness and subsequent unconsciousness, even across species, is caused by sedation. Anæsthesia and similar instances where people and animals lose consciousness in a controlled environment are ideal to study the nature of consciousness.\n\nClinical neurology defines levels of arousal and access to contents in terms of measurable dynamics and brain networks. While some decry levels as a poor metaphor for consciousness that overlooks its multi-dimensional aspects, others contest that view. Irrespective of each point of view, these concepts do indeed serve a clear clinical purpose. The systems view of consciousness offers mechanisms and a multi-dimensional view with levels and access that is also based on neural correlates of consciousness, yet entirely free from any theory of mind.\n\nAnæsthesia: now you see it, now you don’t\n\nIn the operating theatre, the anæsthesiologist is a magician. While the patient focuses on counting backwards from ten, they apply a few drops of a clear liquid, and, voilà, the patient’s consciousness disappears entirely, only to reappear after the main performance, the surgery, is done.\n\nThe magic trick looks identical in every act, yet that is the real illusion. Different anæsthetics dissociate level and access with different reproducible neural signatures. Propofol produces frontal alpha rhythms that silence long-range frontoparietal communication. Ketamine preserves arousal while fracturing content and inhibiting the sense of self. Dexmedetomidine yields a sleep-like quiescence from which the patient can easily be aroused, often with dream-like reports upon prompting. There is therefore no single consciousness switch.\n\nClinical metrics such as the perturbational complexity index (PCI) distinguish wakefulness from deep anæsthesia and dreamless sleep. PCI measures the brain’s capacity to coordinate across regions. It can even signal hidden capacity in some non-responsive patients. Anæsthetics such as propofol decrease the PCI, whereas ketamine keeps it steady or increases it. Psychedelics also boost the PCI.\n\nDream research shows that the back of the brain can build vivid scenes even when the frontal regions are not engaged. With a pulse, the thalamus can temporarily restore intentional behaviour from deep anæsthesia in primates. Phrased differently, the brain can generate scenes without arousal, while arousal does not depend on any scene at all. Scene construction and arousal are separable parts of the same system.\n\nAltered states of consciousness\n\nWe do not have to enter the hospital to lose consciousness: we do it every night when we fall asleep. During the non-REM stages, arousal and connectivity are lowered, whereas we have vivid dreams in REM sleep. Content generation is therefore decoupled from behavioural output or sensory input.\n\nTraumatic brain injuries such as a concussion lead to a transient disconnection that impairs arousal, routing, or coordination, depending on the locus and severity. A short loss of consciousness often leads to the disruption of arousal pathways. Longer sequelæ cause network-level dysconnectivity. More severe disorders of consciousness (e.g. coma) can be evaluated with complexity measures, such as PCI. Interestingly, the EEGs of comatose patients often resemble those of people under general anæsthesia.\n\nWhen a person faints, it is usually due to a lack of blood to organs. On an EEG it shows up as a slowing down, followed by a flattening, and eventually a re-emergence to normal patterns. In behavioural terms, a patient twitches and becomes unresponsive for a few seconds. This is a clear case of a failure of the level subsystem while the rest of the architecture remains intact.\n\nPsychedelics, such as LSD and psilocybin, increase brain activity and complexity and they tend to reduce the sense of self. Mebufotenin even offers, in certain rare cases, a meditation-like trance of pure awareness without the self or the world around.\n\nMeditation does not raise the level so much as tune access by reducing self-chatter in line with the Buddhist concept of anattā, or lack of a self. Seasoned practitioners can often achieve higher levels of synchrony through gamma waves.\n\nIn imaging studies, we can see a clear pattern: the mind wanders, the lapse is noticed, attention is redirected, and quiet returns. Psychedelics achieve pretty much the same, albeit temporarily, through biochemistry.\n\nThese examples at the edges of consciousness demonstrate that the same outward ‘lights off’ can arise via different component failures. Some drugs target arousal, while others affect routing or coordination. Conversely, ‘lights on’ can return through the restoration of a single or select few pathways. In that sense, consciousness behaves like a multi-component control system with bidirectional couplings (to and from the environment), feedback loops, and characteristic failure modes.\n\nWhat we have so far seen is that consciousness is fragile and it can be disabled through level and access subsystems with different outcomes. These are summarized in the table below.\n\nConsciousness: more than the sum of its parts\n\nSome of what humans do is accomplished without consciousness. Consider the jazz musician submerged in improvisation, whose fingers find the right notes before any conscious thought could guide them. Or consider the common experience of ‘highway hypnosis’ in which one arrives at a familiar destination with no memory of the journey, having navigated complex traffic unconsciously. These are not trivial functions; they are feats of incredible computational complexity, run by fast, efficient, and entirely nonphenomenal systems. As we master a skill, its execution migrates from the slow, energy-intensive prefrontal cortex to the lightning-fast, automated machinery of the basal ganglia and cerebellum. It is a triumph of evolutionary efficiency.\n\nThink of the brain as a metropolis at night. Neurons zip across the city like vehicles; it is busy even when we think the city sleeps. Consciousness is a motion picture narrated by the self that casts a spotlight onto a neighbourhood, a street corner, or the entire skyline. It is not factual newsreel footage, but a deeply personal snapshot of life in the metropolis that requires the various neighbourhoods to be powered up and connected through arterial roads and boulevards. The ‘now’ is a clever reconstruction, an audiovisual illusion of things as they were mere moments ago. It is an illusion so seamless no one ever notices it.\n\nIn this metaphor, level is the power grid. When we are awake, the city is brightly illuminated and busy. General anæsthesia is the equivalent of a city-wide blackout. Non-REM sleep matches a curfew, in which the lights may be on, but cross-town traffic is sparse. Access is the city’s news feed. When information is syndicated, it becomes available to many parts of the metropolis. Consciousness is not a single entity or located in a single spot. It is about functions and their connections. In Figure 1, the components of the consciousness system are shown. We shall explore the various components and links and tie them to the city-at-night metaphor to illustrate the purpose of each. It is based on insights from the edges of consciousness in humans and non-human animals; it is not tied to any single neural architecture.\n\nThe arousal/readiness component is the control room of the city’s power grid. When the voltage is high, the nightlife is vibrant and consciousness’ movie can capture whatever moment is of interest. When the voltage drops, entire blocks go dim and the narrator’s voice goes quiet. It can also raise or lower the brightness across neighbourhoods. Without arousal/readiness, people end up in sleeplike states, such as fainting spells or even a coma.\n\nAnatomically, arousal is handled by the brainstem and hypothalamus by means of orexin, which regulates arousal, wakefulness, and appetite. Norepinephrine sets the voltage levels across the entire city by focusing attention, while acetylcholine boosts incoming sensory transmissions.\n\nIn animals, we find similar brain structures. A single mutation in an orexin receptor causes narcolepsy in dogs, which shows that turning a single chemical key can switch off the lights in the dog park. Cephalopods cycle between quiet and active sleep that resembles REM, though with an entirely different neural architecture.\n\nRelay and synchrony are the traffic rules that coordinate remote regions to keep traffic flowing smoothly across the city. It is the precise timing that matters, not the magnitude or density of traffic (i.e. neuronal spikes). In humans, the thalamus acts as the brain’s clock. Failure in relay/synchrony leads to dissociation as in anæsthesia or ignition failures, in which a local representation never makes it outside the own neighbourhood.\n\nEven though birds lack a laminated neocortex, corvids exhibit the mind as a city: a systems view of consciousness 5 responses that mirror subjective detection, which implies a relay-like coordination in the pallium. While octopuses lack a mammalian thalamus, they show coordinated transitions: as they flip between active and quiet sleep modes, several brain regions’ rhythms alternate as if the octopus’ city re-timed all the traffic lights at once to reroute neural traffic. The implementations are all different, but the function is the same.\n\nWhile relay/synchrony enables the city to coordinate traffic across areas without gridlock, coordination is the actual infrastructure to do that: roads, signs, and traffic lights. In humans, the capacity to coordinate reflects large-scale dynamics right between order and disorder, the sweet spot between gridlock and chaotic traffic where neighbourhoods can synchronize when needed and desynchronize to explore. Evidence suggests that the cortex hovers near this criticality point to maximize flexibility in communication.\n\nVarious functional networks exist in the human brain that require long-range communication. For instance, the default mode network (DMN) is active during introspection, daydreaming, and memory recall. Dogs have an equivalent network as well as sensorimotor and auditory networks. The avian brain also has the hardware necessary for coordination, which proves that a cortex is not required.\n\nStreet cameras and microphones furnish the city’s live feed. Sensing supplies the streams that consciousness draws upon for the scenes in its movie of brain city. In the cortex, the primary sensory areas encode features for use in the entire city. When the data feed is offline, the city runs on guesses. That data feed combined with our expectations (i.e. priors) is used to forecast the ‘now.’ This now-casting improves sensory representations of the world around. The brain anticipates and corrects its now-casts as more sensory data arrives. Integration of sensory data feeds is common in all animals.\n\nIn humans and macaques, gamma waves carry sensory data forward while alpha and beta waves feed it back to shape the signal. In mice, similar band-specific feed-forward and feed-backward mechanisms for sensory information exist. Most of sensing is performed in the primary sensory cortices, insula, and brainstem nuclei.\n\nScene construction is done by the art department, specifically the set designer and continuity editor. They use the control room’s displays and loudspeakers to build a coherent shot from partial footage by filling in gaps or painting over seams so the experience feels seamless. A posterior ‘hot zone’ that crosses the parietal, occipital, and temporal lobes is the conductor for dreams in the human brain. The orchestra, so to speak, is shared among many regions, such as the limbic system (emotions), the hippocampus (memories), temporal lobe (visuals), and frontal cortex, yet notably without the logical prefrontal cortex. Without the conductor, the orchestra does not play; the conductor alone is not sufficient to dream either. When scene construction fails, it can lead to dissociation of content that feels fragmented.\n\nScene construction is ultimately powered by prediction: the ‘now’ is the brain’s best guess of it, because sensory data is always delayed and only up to a few hundred milliseconds later available for conscious access. Without prediction, we would bump into each door frame, get hit by every ball, or crash a car into where it was a split-second ago.\n\nCuttlefish have episodic memory that combines the what, where, and when of events in the past with even the possibility of false memories due to errors in scene (re-)construction: their ‘now’ is stitched together after the fact rather than recorded live.\n\nThe access buffer is the jumbotron in the central square: when information hits the screen, the entire city can coordinate around it, as otherwise the footage remains local. Whatever is shown on it is only available briefly and the amount of content that can be displayed is limited, so it is a bit like a scratchpad. Experience without the access buffer leads to disconnected consciousness.\n\nThe access buffer is distributed across the prefrontal and parietal cortices, supported by sensory regions. Sedatives decrease the access buffer’s capacity, so that ultimately awareness cannot reach report/action. A similar structure can be found in birds and mammals.\n\nValuation and salience set the city’s priorities right now, for which the salience network is primarily responsible in humans. The component also acts as the switchboard for attention, as it patches communication between relevant regions as needed. In mammals, homologous networks have been observed. Birds and cephalopods set priorities via different circuits that are linked to motivation and action selection. A failure in this component leads to either apathy or extreme distractibility due to mis-prioritized contents.\n\nConsciousness’ film producer is the self-context, powered by the default mode network, for which homologues exist in dogs. With the aid of the valuation/salience component, it also narrates the motion picture. In case of failure of the self-context, depersonalization, out-of-body illusions, loss of agency, or anosognosia-like dissociations the mind as a city: a systems view of consciousness can occur. Internally, the self-context offers priors that bias internal decisions, whereas externally it is a communication interface.\n\nThis is supported by various philosophical traditions. Ubuntu’s maxim ‘I am because we are’ captures Menkiti’s conviction that personhood is constituted through communal life rather than conferred at birth. Hegel and Mead too believed that the self arises through social interactions and mutual recognition. In social species, a stable narrative self improves predictability and therefore trust.\n\nAvicenna imagined a man suspended in air and cut off from all sensations, not unlike someone inside a modern sensory deprivation tank. Such a floating man would still know that he exists, because self-awareness does not depend on the body or the world. It is a thought experiment designed to home in on the minimal conditions for consciousness, in which the self-context is isolated from all interfaces. It presupposes arousal/readiness to sustain awareness, but self-awareness survives even when sensing and report/action are stripped away, though relay/synchrony and coordination are, in the systems view, still needed.\n\nReport/action externalizes the scenes that have been selected in terms of actions, decisions, or communication. Language is a very efficient means, though need not be the only one, especially across species. In humans the prefrontal and premotor cortices translate accessible content into speech and motion, respectively. When there is no report/action, people are locked in themselves as if paralysed: they experience and are aware of their experiences, but they cannot act on them or talk about them. The ability to produce embodied actions from conscious content is present in all animals.\n\nThe world interface is the city’s connection to and from the outside world with sensors, actuators, and environmental feedback. Inner scenes can play in dreams across many species even though motor output is absent.\n\nThe connections can be subdivided into content and modulatory links. The former carry information payloads from one component to another, whereas the latter only alter what content is promoted or suppressed across regions through neuromodulators. Content moves on millisecond spikes, whereas neuromodulators act through biochemical diffusion processes. These are sometimes referred to as drivers and modulators.\n\nWhen we change modulation without affecting contents as in anæsthesia, we lower arousal and long-range communication in the brain. Likewise, when we alter the contents (e.g. binocular rivalry) while keeping the modulation the same, attention boosts the response of neurons that are tuned to the attended feature or location, thus sharpening the contrast without adding novel content. Similarly, when we stimulate the motor area in monkeys without any change in arousal, they can ‘see’ the motion. These demonstrate that the content/modulation split matches different dissociation mechanisms in the brains of various species.\n\nNishida argued that experience without a self is not only possible but pure: it occurs before the split between subject and object, which is exactly the link between scene construction and coordination\n\nFrom the world interface through sensing, scene construction, coordination, the access buffer, and report/action back to the world interface, the links carry content that stitches frames into a consistent audiovisual experience coloured by the self-context. It consists of the entire conscious feedback loop from sensory inputs to outputs, such as movement and speech.\n\nThe content link from coordination to the self-context updates the self model, and the modulatory link back biases information in the coordination component to be about the self. The latter does not carry new content.\n\nThere is also a link back from the world interface to report/action, although such reflexes are obviously not part of the consciousness system itself as they bypass it entirely.\n\nFrom arousal/readiness to everything else, the connections are neuromodulatory and involve norepinephrine, acetylcholine, histamine, serotonin, dopamine, and orexin.\n\nThe links from valuation/salience are also modulatory, as it prioritizes content for scene construction (amygdala and insula), the self-context (cingulate cortex), and coordination (salience network). This is mostly handled by reward systems.\n\nReport/action and sensing are connected by means of an efference copy, which is the internal duplicate of motion signals for comparison of sensory information to check whether the actual movement matches the desired one. Since no new content is fed back, it is modulatory.\n\nScene construction is modulated through relaying and synchronization. The same is true for coordination that depends on exact timings across brain regions.\n\nThe systems view offers falsifiable predictions. For instance, specific thalamo-cortical stimulation that restores relay/synchrony without raising arousal ought to restore report/action while under dexmedetomidine sedation, which disables the arousal/readiness component. In macaques, such stimulation awakens the cortex within seconds. Deep-brain stimulation of the central thalamus also improves responsiveness in humans with chronic disorders of consciousness. The idea is as follows: under stable anæsthesia, apply a centrallateral stimulation and check whether coherent report transiently returns. If it does indeed, relay/synchrony are as separate as the systems view claims; if not, it is not an independent lever.\n\nWe already know that we can zap the cortex and listen to the electrical echo, which is the essence of the PCI. What is missing is a sequential experiment within the same subjects: one session titrated to unresponsiveness with propofol and another with ketamine. In both cases, the PCI and directed connectivity (i.e. who drives whom) are to be recorded with a structured debrief on recovery about the stability of self and mental scene. If ketamine yields a high PCI with an unstable self while propofol yields a low PCI with simple or absent content in the same subjects, the systems view holds as there are two independent knobs to control consciousness through anæsthesia.\n\nFurthermore, a patch on the back of the cortex tracks whether people are dreaming. When it lights up in the right way, vivid reports follow upon awakening, even if the rest of the brain appears quiet. So, if that patch aids in building content, then a brief zap during non-REM sleep ought to shift people towards mentation without a surge in arousal. Once awake, we must collect the report. If we can selectively turn up scene construction while the level stays low, the systems view holds. If not, it suggests that content and level are less separable than the systems view claims.\n\nSimilar predictions and experiments can be designed to verify whether each component in the systems view is truly independent from the others. Likewise, we can construct experiments that check similar component-wise independence across species. That way, we can gradually refine the model and arrive at a minimal set of components required for consciousness in biological systems.\n\nTheories of mind and the systems view of consciousness\n\nThe systems view presented here unifies the clinical level and cognitive access that is based on insights from the edges of consciousness and various species. It explains why anæsthetics have different signatures rather than a single signature. We can even map concepts from various leading theories of mind to the systems view, upon which theories of mind stop being rivals and instead own a particular component, as shown in Table 2.\n\nAccording to the Global Neuronal Workspace Theory (GNWT), consciousness happens when a representation ‘ignites’ a long-range cortical network, so it becomes available for report, actions, and memory. The key region for GNWT is the prefrontal cortex.\n\nIntegrated Information Theory (IIT) proposes that consciousness arises from information integration. The quantity F measures the degree to which information is integrated, for which the posterior hot zone plays a key role. To have a non-zero value of F, all constituent matter must contain trace elements of consciousness, which leads to panpsychism as a prerequisite.\n\nA recent experiment pitted GNWT against IIT and found that neither explains consciousness satisfactorily. Particularly, the researchers found that consciousness arises even without sustained synchronization in the posterior cortex and without an ignition in the prefrontal cortex. Instead, we can map GNWT to the access buffer and both GNWT and IIT to coordination, as they both require broadcast or integration (i.e. coordination).\n\nIn Predictive processing (PP), the brain is a prediction machine: it generates models of the world and updates these by minimizing a prediction error, which is the difference between its guesses and sensory inputs. The entire control system in PP requires scene construction to generate predictions biased by valuation/salience, arousal/readiness to be able to generate and improve predictions, relay/synchrony for fast communication, coordination for inference over sensorimotor information, and the world interface to close the loop.\n\nRecurrent Processing Theory (RPT) says that feedback loops from sensory areas to higher-level cortical areas give rise to consciousness in thalamo-cortical loops. Features from sensory data are unconsciously extracted (e.g. shapes, colours, and motion), for which feedback from higher-level regions provides context (e.g. a face) that is again used to refine expectations in lower-level areas. Local recurrent processing is sufficient for consciousness, so that the access buffer and access consciousness through the prefrontal cortex are merely add-ons for report/action, not consciousness as a whole.\n\nWith Higher-Order Thought (HOT) theory, a mental state becomes conscious when an individual has a suitable higher-order representation of being in that state. Consciousness is thus meta-awareness. The self-context is the seat of consciousness in HOT, which is powered by the access buffer’s higher-order thoughts. Because the systems view talks about components and connections rather than specific anatomical locations, HOT can be mapped, even though it does not deal with a specific implementation in humans or other animals.\n\nEnactivism (En) posits that all cognition is embodied and thus shaped by sensorimotor actions: animals experience the world by exploring it and understanding the sensorimotor patterns their interactions generate. The world interface and report/action are therefore essential to its operation.\n\nThe systems view offers a blueprint for consciousness in silico based on what we know of it in vivo. It is the specific components, their functions, and their connections that give rise to consciousness, not the neural architecture or substrate; there is no magical separation between carbon and silicon. As such, artificial consciousness is a distinct possibility and falsifiable prediction.\n\nLarge generative models display rich scene construction, but they have no intrinsic arousal/readiness tied to a body: when switched off, they do not exhibit activity such as dreams. Their ‘sensing’ is optional. Report is their only output channel with no sense of self or valuation that matters to its integrity. In the case of robots, ‘sensing‘ is linked to an actual body and they can act as well as report, though artificial embodied experiences powered by multimodal models, such as Google’s RT-X Platform, are still nascent.\n\nA possible objection to consciousness as an emergent phenomenon is often voiced by proponents of IIT: how can consciousness arise from non-conscious matter? There is actually nothing mystical about emergent properties in systems. The motion of atoms and molecules generates heat, even though no atom or molecule has a ‘temperature’ as such. In a similar manner, traffic jams happen because of many cars acting and reacting in a dynamic system, even though no single car has a ‘traffic jamminess’ property. Traffic jams come about through interactions, inherent bottlenecks, and flow patterns, where a phase transition occurs that separates a smooth traffic flow from gridlock. Consciousness is, in the systems view, no more mysterious as system behaviour than traffic jams or heat.\n\nThe systems view offers a unique perspective on a classic puzzle, Theseus’ ship, which asks whether a ship that has every plank replaced one at a time remains the same ship. In minds, the analogue is a gradual neural replacement, which is intimately connected to the question of identity. All that matters in the systems view are the components’ functions and their interactions, not the material itself. So, as long as the planks are nailed together in the same way and they perform the same function as before, it is indeed the same ship. If we replaced all neurons with synthetic ones, but maintained the original connections, functions, and links, the mind would still be the same one.\n\nThe systems view matches the ‘fading and dancing qualia’ thought experiment: if qualia could drift (i.e. vanish or shift) without alterations to function, absurd transitions where reports and actions continue as before while the inner movie conflicts are possible. Since that is deemed implausible, a functional rather than material organization of consciousness is more reasonable.\n\nThe systems view turns Theseus’ ship from a paradox into an engineering challenge: with the right tools we can switch consciousness on or off and perhaps even engineer it into existence in artificial life forms. In that sense, Descartes’ evil demon is nothing but a neurosurgeon who can manipulate a patient’s mind through deep brain stimulation.\n\nPhilosophical zombies are functionally perfect facsimiles with no experience. The systems view refines the thought experiment, because it requires us to specify at which level functional duplication is performed. If it is done at the level of components and their connections, the systems view demotes philosophical zombies to unfalsifiable stipulations. Moreover, by probing the edges of consciousness, we can look for specific connections among components we can break (with anæsthetics) or remake (with stimulation) on demand. If zombies are possible, they are only so in a way that shows all the clinical signatures of consciousness yet lacks it altogether.\n\nThe systems view does not solve the hard problem, but it narrows it. Instead of asking why matter yields experience, it asks which specific causal links yield which families of experience. It does not settle all metaphysics, but it fences it in. The hard/easy divide and the explanatory gap still stand. What changes is where the gap is located and how narrow we can make it.\n\nFirst, the problem of phenomenal character becomes empirical. The self-context is a dedicated node within the systems view that monitors and models what the rest of the system is doing. Attention-schema theory and metacognitive models (e.g. HOT) purport that the brain maintains a simplified sketch of its own access and control. When we edit that sketch, people change what they report about awareness even when early sensory coding remains intact. This reframes the debate around qualia. At least part of the ineffable ‘feel’ is the output of a self-monitor that can be tweaked and tested. Any theory of mind must survive these reversible, component-specific interventions.\n\nSecond, once experience is tied to specific components, claims that phenomenal character floats freely above the consciousness system must account for why the same perturbations predictably erase or restore both signatures and reports.\n\nWhat is left of the hard problem is to explain why a particular state has a particular type of felt presence and why the system insists there is something beyond the obvious.\n\nConsciousness as a system is not a novel idea. Fazang’s golden lion teaches that the matter may be the same, but the relationships among the matter are what turn gold into a lion. Consciousness is the golden lion: it may be made out of neurons, dendrites, and axons, but it is the way these are wired up that gives rise to consciousness.\n\nWe even find echoes of the systems view among the Aztecs. In Nahua philosophy, each person is animated by three forces: tonalli (vigour), teyolía (identity, memory, knowledge), and ihíyotl (affect and desire). It was believed that tonalli could leave the body during sleep, which maps cleanly to arousal/readiness. Valuation/salience is equivalent to ihíyotl, whereas teyolía aligns itself roughly with scene construction, coordination, and the self-context, which together provide a coherent yet biased view of the world and the person in it.\n\nPhilosophical traditions from east and west, north and south, have all espoused consciousness as a system for centuries, though not in those words or with the specific components and connections as proposed here. It does suggest a convergent, systems-level understanding of the mind across cultures.\n\nThe systems view unpacks consciousness into a set of interacting functions whose disruptions map to measurable phenomena across drugs, injuries, and species. It shows why level and access are a useful clinical shorthand. More importantly, it reframes cross-species arguments on consciousness; it is about the components and connections, not a cortex.\n\nWhen we view consciousness not as a ghost in the machine but as the dynamic, functional organization of the machine itself, we gain five benefits. First, it is independent of the neural architecture or its substrate, so that it applies across species and even to artificial life forms. Second, it constrains philosophy. Any theory that denies a systems view must explain how individual components can be disabled selectively yet lead to different experiences. As such, it narrows the hard problem though it does not eliminate it. Third, various theories of mind can be mapped to the components of the system, which reduces rivalry and focuses instead on the merits in each idea. Fourth, we can ask better questions about the inner lives of animals and the ethical implications thereof. The Cambridge and New York declarations on consciousness are already a step in that direction. Like the systems view, these are informed by the latest science and philosophy. Fifth, it explains why current AIs are not imbued with consciousness while offering a blueprint for such artificial consciousness.\n\nWhile we still do not know the minimal set of components and connections needed to generate artificial consciousness in the lab, we do know enough to stop arguing about a single switch of consciousness and instead focus on the entire control panel. The task ahead is therefore to chart the wiring of the entire city of the mind.\n\n[1] Adeeti Aggarwal, Connor Brennan, Jennifer Luo, Helen Chung, Diego Contreras, Max B.

The impact is so big, in fact, that for many, finishing Elden Ring means it's time to look for more games like Elden Ring. It combines the essential elements of a Souls game--most notably a combat system with tough enemies and massive bosses that often require careful study and patient play to defeat--with a phenomenally dense, imaginative open world.\n\nIt's that open world that really sets Elden Ring apart from both From Software's other franchises, and most games in general; it's full of fascinating things to discover, encouraging players to set out on their own path of exploration and constantly rewarding them for their efforts.\n\nMore Elden Ring is now here, in the form of Elden Ring Nightreign, a standalone experience set in the Elden Ring world, but deviating pretty significantly from it. Instead of creating a character, you'll choose from specific heroes to play, and instead of venturing across the world mostly alone, you'll take on Nightreign cooperatively with up to two other players.\n\nFor some, a cooperative Elden Ring experience is right up their alley, but if you'd rather have the more lonesome, exploration-heavy, contemplative experience, Nightreign might not be for you. Luckily, there are a ton of other games that are like Elden Ring--those that conjure a similar feeling of setting out into a dark and hostile world, whether through their combat systems, dark and intriguing storytelling, or world design. Below, you'll find 24 RPGs, souls-like games, and open-world games that each capture elements of Elden Ring's gameplay, providing you with more tough battles to fight and incredible worlds to chart. These aren't necessarily meant to be duplicates of what Elden Ring is going for, but games that might appeal to those who like certain elements of it.\n\nAlternatively, we've got suggestions for the best RPGs and the best Elden Ring mods, the latter of which can expand and refresh your experience if you just want more Elden Ring.\n\nSucker Punch’s follow-up to Ghost of Tsushima moves the action up 300 years to the 17th century Ezo, as a female warrior, Atsu, dedicates herself to hunting down the Yotei Six who murdered her family and left her for dead.\n\nWith only two exceptions, Ghost of Yotei lets players choose which of the six she wants to target, and win. The game’s combat and open-world exploration should appeal to Elden Rings players, and this period of Japan’s history has been meticulously recreated. A player can lose themselves going through all of the side missions and finding the hidden secrets. The backgrounds are stunningly beautiful and the game is a worthy successor for the Ghost franchise.\n\nPlatforms: PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, PC\n\nGame Science really elevated their game--so to speak--with Black Myth: Wukong, a beautifully rendered dive into Chinese mythology that loosely adapts Journey to the West. It’s not a fully open-world game, but Elden Ring fans should appreciate its soulslike aspects and the fantastic combat system. The Destined One’s staff turns out to be one of the most versatile weapons in the game, and it has plenty of tricks to master.\n\nThe Destined One is a humanoid monkey who is attempting to free his master from a trap that was set centuries earlier. That quest will take the Destined One across the country and into countless battles with enemies that stand in the way of his goal. Knocking the hell out of them with the staff is a good way to destress, but don’t get complacent. There are always harder battles to get through before the end.\n\nWuchang: Fallen Feathers is another soulslike title with a female warrior at the forefront. Bai Wuchang, however, has access to a deadly arsenal of weapons including multiple swords, dual blades, axes, and spears. If it’s sharp, she can use pretty much anything to kill her foes, and her combat options are like deadly poetry in motion. Even her defensive moves are impressive.\n\nOne of the unique aspects of this game is that Wuchang is infected with a virus that can transform its victims and drive them crazy. Players have to monitor Wuchang’s sanity and take steps to bring her back from the brink. Wuchang’s madness can also be a super power that temporarily makes her much stronger. But if her sanity is nearly depleted, it means her death won’t be far behind.\n\nHell Is Us breaks from the conventions of the other games on this list by setting its story in an alternative present that’s mired in supernatural threats. The main character, Remi, even uses a drone to help him distract his enemies. But when it comes to taking down Hollow Walkers, the old ways are best. That means swords, axes, and other melee weapons are the most effective tactics against these creatures.\n\nRemi’s story takes him back to his war-torn homeland as he attempts to locate the parents that he barely remembers. What he discovers is a deeper mission that will test him every aspect of his being. It turns out you can go home again, but no one ever said anything about leaving alive. The semi-open world around Remi has its own life to it, and he’ll need to talk with other survivors to figure out what he should do.\n\nThough not the first of From Software's games to use the formula, the Dark Souls trilogy crystalized the essential elements that make up Elden Ring, and went on to define an entire subgenre. It's the feel of Dark Souls that informs Elden Ring, as well as so many other games that have come after it. Combat is slow and methodical, requiring you to pick your moments to attack as you learn how to deal with powerful opponents that can easily destroy you if you're not smart and careful. The combination of melee mechanics with a stamina gauge, a health system that gives you a limited quantity of healing items you can continually refill, and a checkpoint system that forces you to choose between replenishing yourself and reviving all the creatures you just defeated, have led to so many games borrowing its ideas that it has given rise to its own genre: the Soulslike.\n\nThe original Dark Souls is really the quintessential game, taking players through tough battles against a variety of fantastical bosses, and features an incredibly interesting and interconnected world. It's not exactly an open-world game--it hides a pretty linear experience--but it feels huge, open, and strange, and the sense of exploring that world is part of what has made Dark Souls so powerfully influential for more than a decade. Dark Souls 2 and 3 expand on and refine the experience in different ways to offer iterations on the theme that are both worth exploring, especially to see how they would eventually give rise to Elden Ring.\n\nFanatical is owned by GameSpot parent company Fandom.\n\nThe Dark Souls games (and Demon's Souls) hew closest to Elden Ring's approach to things like combat and healing. In terms of a vast open world where exploration is just as big a part of the experience as following the prescribed path, however, it's hard to find a better example than The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, and its sequel, Tears of the Kingdom. Both games reimagine the classic Zelda framework of melee combat, dungeon-crawling, and amassing a huge inventory of weapons and tools to make your way in the world, with an expansive open world that gives way to a much more free-form experience. Just as you can set out in any direction in Elden Ring and find a viable path through the game, you can wander both Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom and chart your own way through Hyrule. You'll be hard-pressed to find any other games that capture Elden Ring's sense of open possibility the way these do.\n\nThe quickest way to understand Remnant 2 would be \"Dark Souls with guns,\" although especially with Remnant 2, that description is a big disservice. Remnant 2 uses key elements of the souls-like formula, like finite healing items that can be replenished, a stamina gauge for dodging away from enemy attacks, and checkpoints that revive enemies in the area around you, but it expands on it in a ton of meaningful ways. Most notably, Remnant 2 makes use of an impressive procedural generation system that mixes in bespoke elements, making unpredictable maps that are filled with intricate, well-designed dungeons. It also has a series of phenomenal, often-massive boss fights, each different from the last and interesting in its own unique way. However, it's in its secrets that Remnant 2 really excels--the procedural generation elements mean you can play the same dungeon over and over and discover new elements each time, like hidden rooms, additional battles, and alternate ways to defeat bosses. The best way to experience Remnant 2 is in co-op, thanks to a system that rewards you for mixing and matching different classes and working together to explore its constantly changing world.\n\nBloodborne takes the more linear approach generally inherent to the Dark Souls games and gives it a faster pace, while setting it in a bloody Lovecraftian horror tale. There's a reason Bloodborne is the favorite of From Software's oeuvre among many fans--it's an often-brilliant iteration on the core ideas. Bloodborne does away with the slower elements of the Souls games, like blocking with a shield, in favor of dodging, parrying, and a health-rally system that rewards you for being aggressive by letting you gain back health lost to enemies by pressing the attack. Even better than that, though, is a dark and twisting story about a plague that turns people into horrific beasts, which you're tasked with stopping as you take part in the blood-drenched Hunt, only to discover that there are forces beyond your comprehension at work in the cursed land of Yharnam.\n\nWhere Bloodborne iterated on From's approach with faster and more aggressive gameplay, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice brought that line of thinking to its ultimate conclusion with a game that demands you never back down from a fight. In Sekiro, every battle is a duel, whether you're fighting a samurai general or a towering ape. It introduces a \"posture\" system, which rewards you for pressing the attack and perfectly parrying your opponent's strikes by staggering them and opening them up for a massive, deadly blow. Sekiro is also From's most narrative-driven game, taking you through a tragic story set during Japan's Sengoku period, and adds stealth mechanics and platforming to the formula to create something unique among From's catalog.\n\nRise of the Ronin takes a stab at combat similar to Elden Ring--it's maybe \n\nIt's tough to think of an open-world RPG without thinking immediately of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. Bethesda's incredibly popular game has been ported basically everywhere, and endures more than 10 years later because it puts players in a vast world with a huge amount of things to discover. Defined by first-person combat that includes dual-wielding weapons and magic spells, Skyrim has an absolutely enormous number of things to do and find, and stories to uncover and take part in. It stands as the gold standard of Bethesda's approach to games and has been hugely influential on open-world titles and RPGs ever since. Plus, it has an expansive, robust modding scene on PC that adds to and remakes the game in a phenomenal number of ways, just in case getting lost in the northern reaches of Tamriel for hundreds of hours wasn't enough for you.\n\nA lot of developers have tried to replicate the feel of a From Software Souls game, but none have ever quite managed it. Few have gotten as close as Neowiz Games with Lies of P, though. A riff on the story of Pinnochio, Lies of P is a little bit like if Bloodborne was set a little further in the future and focused on killer clockwork automata instead of werewolf-like monsters, but with a hearty helping of Sekiro's parry-focused approach to combat and weaponry. The game excels in fast-paced dueling combat, especially in its many killer boss fights. It's also set in a dark, fantastical world and explores some fascinating ideas of personhood in between all the beat-downs you give both robots and other \"humans.\"\n\nThe 2018 reboot of God of War reworked its gameplay in some significant ways, not the least of which is a \"wide linear\" focus on exploration that puts you not quite in an open world, but not quite in a fully linear experience, either. That approach provides a lot of Norse mythology-inspired places to explore, where you'll uncover fascinating stories and quite a few tough mythological creatures that need walloping. Reworked combat tightens the series' combo-centric battles against lots of enemies to make for some tougher duels, and God of War and its sequel, Ragnarok, have evolved to be \n\nMortal Shell is an indie souls-like game very obviously inspired by the Dark Souls approach, with a haltingly told story and a dark and shadowy fantasy world. Its tough combat is very similar to what the Souls games turn out, but with a few tweaks that might make it a good introduction to the genre. Two elements define Mortal Shell: the ability to inhabit the bodies of fallen soldiers to take on their different capabilities, kind of like choosing a class, and the ability to \"harden\" your body and tank a hit from an enemy. The harden ability is the key to Mortal Shell's combat, as it allows you to bait your opponent into attacking and then capitalize on the opening their blow bouncing off you creates. Mortal Shell is a smaller-scale souls-like than most, but it does a great job of dialing in on a few key elements that make these games so engaging while fleshing them out very well.\n\nTitanfall and Apex Legends' developer Respawn Entertainment's take on Star Wars is more than a little Souls-y. The series, now two games deep, tells the story of a Jedi hiding out in the aftermath of the Jedi Purge from Revenge of the Sith, before he sets out with a band of misfits to take on the Galactic Empire. Lots of games put you in the role of a Jedi, but Respawn's mixture of souls-like influence does a better job of making that compelling than most--instead of just slicing through everything with your laser sword, you're forced to use skills and reflexes, as well as the Force, as you fight tough duels against opponents ranging from Purge Troopers to Rancors to Sith Inquisitors. The Jedi games also add metroidvania elements and large areas to explore on various planets, scratching your exploration and puzzle-solving itch as well.\n\nIn some ways, Ghost of Tsushima is to Sekiro what Elden Ring is to Dark Souls: It plays in similar ways, but brings elements of Sekiro to an open-world format. Those elements are mainly a big focus on stealth assassinations and intense dueling gameplay. Ghost of Tsushima strikes out in its own direction with an emphasis on fighting stances--using the right stance against the enemy you face is essential to success--but a big focus is on parrying blows and knocking enemies off-guard so you can land your strikes. While its open world is more traditional than Elden Ring's, with lots of characters to talk to and side quests to complete, its minimalist presentation helps it capture that sense of wide-reaching exploration that makes From Software's game so engaging.\n\nThough souls-like games are often defined by their combat, the more effervescent element of the Elden Ring experience is the sense of scale and discovery it can often portray, as you ride over a hill and discover something incredible--often towering in the distance and waiting to kill you. That's the experience of Shadow of the Colossus to a T. You venture into a beautifully realized but ultimately lonely world filled with staggering, enormous monsters--only to destroy them. Shadow of the Colossus nails a sense of vastness that is empty and ponderous, something that also marks the best moments of Elden Ring, and excels at making you feel like you've just stumbled on something ancient and inscrutable. Its minimalist narrative makes the most of that world, as well as its awe-inspiring creatures, to capture a feeling few other games ever manage.\n\nThe Witcher 3 is revered as one of the best open-world RPGs made in the last decade, if not longer. It expands on CD Projekt's Witcher series in just about every way, from placing you in a truly huge game world full of well-told stories and side quests, to deepening combat and exploration. The gist is still the same--you're monster-hunter Geralt, a strong fighter with a handful of impressive special abilities and access to magic powers. And it's in fighting its various monsters that The Witcher 3 really hits a stride, pitting you against fantastical beasts that are all weird, deadly, and challenging in their own ways. Beyond that, though, its world is filled with quests that are worth taking and tales that are worth unfolding. The way The Witcher 3 lets you get to know the world and take part in it, and shows you the beauty and tragedy found within, elevates it beyond most RPGs.\n\nHollow Knight is a pretty big departure from Elden Ring, as games on this list go. It's not a 3D open-world game or an RPG--it's a side-scrolling metroidvania. But like a lot of other games on this list, it nails the sense of exploration through a strange world full of long and sometimes tragic history. It also draws from the souls-like formula for its combat, distilling some of those elements into 2D battles against a huge host of bosses. The combination of tough battles, a dark and expansive world through which you chart your own path, and an incredible amount of atmosphere and intriguing world-building give Hollow Knight a similar feel to what makes Elden Ring so enticing.\n\nThe Horizon games are \n\nOne of the joys of Elden Ring is just setting out in a direction and seeing what's out there. In Dragon's Dogma 2, just about any venture away from the safety of a settlement is met less with fascinating things to discover like hidden caves or underground cities, and more with unpredictable chaos in the form of the various vicious and magical creatures that want to make a meal out of you. The unpredictable ways these systems can interact with each other is the joy of Dragon's Dogma 2--as is hanging out with the miscreant \"pawns,\" companion characters you and other players create. Sharing them with pals you can't join in-game gives Dragon's Dogma a multiplayer feel similar to Elden Ring that goes perfectly with a fun open world where the journey is always as important as the destination.\n\nThe Nioh games were the result of developer Team Ninja combining its pedigree for fast, intense combat with souls-like mechanics. A lot of the familiar elements are present, like your offensive and defensive moves being governed by a stamina system. Team Ninja riffed on that underlying idea, creating an approach to stamina that also works in strategic planning in the midst of combat, along with precise timing, to make sure you can keep your stamina up and survive the onslaught of your foes. With clever bosses and winding level design, the Nioh games take souls-like ideas off in new directions to create some fresh but familiar experiences.\n\nYou'll immediately recognize the souls-like elements in combat in No Rest For The Wicked, with the usual stamina system, dodge-rolls, and parries. The differences are in its presentation: No Rest For The Wicked is an isometric dungeon-crawler, making it feel something like Dark Souls via Diablo. Each new weapon you find offers different move sets that will drastically change your approaches to combat, which offers a lot of variety in battles and gameplay as you take on some tough and often huge bosses. No Rest For The Wicked is set in its own dark fantasy world that's equal parts strange, fascinating, and horrifying, making it very interesting to venture through and fight to survive within.\n\nTeam Ninja riffs on the souls-like formula again in Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, but goes in a different direction. It experiments with different ideas, allowing you more opportunities to customize a character and to build into different stats and gameplay approaches as you level up. Choosing different weapons and sets of armor, and hot-swapping between weapons on the fly, lets you change your fighting style whenever you want, offering a lot of versatility for Sekiro-style, parry-heavy battles. Wo Long also makes some interesting tweaks to the souls-like formula--instead of having to run back to where you died in order to reclaim what you lost there, for instance, you now have to face down whatever killed you. The result is a feeling of fighting out a series of battles and duels that have an element of rivalry baked in. Making your way through Wo Long's world isn't just about leveling up, but about staking a claim on each new piece of the map, turning exploration into a system that makes you stronger.\n\nDrawing inspirations from both From Software's games and Team Ninja's Nioh series, The First Berserker: Khazan does what those games do well: intense fights against huge, intense bosses. Khazan will scratch the itch for difficult combat against interesting enemies, especially with its unique art style and weapon-specific upgrade trees that give you incentives to lean into a specific combat style. The game is also part of the Dungeon & Fighter universe, so while it won't give you a huge open world full of lore to explore, there are deeper narrative underpinnings to intrigue fans of the franchise.\n\nInstead of going to the past or to a fantastical world, The Surge 2 takes place in a dystopian sci-fi future. Rogue robots threaten the world, and you'll face a variety of enemies both human and mechanical in a bid for survival. The Surge 2's melee combat adds a new dimension to the usual souls-like formula by allowing you to hack off specific limbs or parts of your foes in order to loot their weapons, armor, or items. If you're looking for an action-RPG that goes the apocalyptic future route rather than toward fantasy tropes, The Surge 2 will give you a whole new ruined world to explore.\n\nIf you're looking for more story and anime influence in your souls-like, Code Vein has you covered. Set in a world ravaged by a cataclysm that has resurrected the dead as vampire-like people called Revenants, you play an amnesiac character with a special ability--where other Revenants have what is essentially a single class called a Blood Code, you're able to compile and swap between many different Blood Codes and the special abilities that come with them. You'll use your vampiric powers to battle other Revenants after they've transformed into hideous monsters in an effort to save those who remain from a similar fate.\n\nWhile Diablo's combat is more oriented toward managing special abilities and cooldowns than it's geared toward dealing with stamina and parries, there's still a lot of similar DNA between it and Elden Ring. The Diablo series originated the RPG loot chase that defines so many games these days, and there's plenty of mechanical satisfaction in constantly chasing greater power. Diablo IV's story and world also play up the horror elements that often infuse Elden Ring, giving you a strange and terrible world to explore, along with massive, challenging bosses to defeat.",

    "description": "Crossmark Global Investments chief market strategist Victoria Fernandez explains why a new wave of earnings from the semiconductor sector signals the AI race is just warming up.",
    "fullText": "The AI supercycle is far from exhausted, and semiconductor companies like industry titan TSMC (TSM) are among the catalysts to watch.\n\n\"This earnings report, really more than anything, supports the idea that [the AI boom] is going to continue to move forward,\" Victoria Fernandez, chief market strategist at Crossmark Global Investments, told Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid.\n\nAccording to Fernandez, the great \"rotation\" out of Big Tech might finally \"start to slow down a little bit.\" While market skeptics spent the past quarter betting on a broad exit from the \"Magnificent Seven,\" a new wave of earnings from the semiconductor sector signals \"there are more legs\" to the AI race.\n\nOther key players to watch include ASML (ASML), Applied Materials (AMAT), and Lam Research (LRCX), as Fernandez points to the firms' respective \"strong earnings.\"\n\nThat renewed optimism is largely due to a fundamental shift in how the market views the picks and shovels of the AI era. For months, investors feared that AI demand might be a bubble nearing its burst. However, the latest data from these four companies — which build the hardware for Big Tech — tells a different story of rising capital expenditures, expanding margins, and relentless sales growth.\n\nLeading that charge is TSMC, the world's most critical chip foundry, which dominates advanced chip production for giants like Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD).\n\nTSMC kicked off the new year by delivering blockbuster Q4 earnings today. For the period, revenue came in at $33.73 billion, a 25% year-over-year increase, beating consensus estimates of $32.8 billion, according to Bloomberg data. Earnings per share reached $3.15, up 8% year over year, surpassing the expected $2.90. TSMC stock has risen over 70% in the past year.\n\nThe company announced it had earmarked up to $56 billion in capital expenditures for 2026. This aggressive spending plan acts as a massive \"buy\" signal for the entire supply chain, per Fernandez, suggesting that the world's biggest tech players are doubling down on infrastructure, rather than pulling back.\n\nThe higher-for-longer spending cycle has revitalized the three other key suppliers. Take ASML, the sole provider of the lithography machines required to make advanced AI chips. Its market cap surged past the $500 billion mark on the back of TSMC's news. Shares of ASML are up over 80% in the past 12 months.\n\nThe support for these suppliers was visible in premarket trading, where Applied Materials and Lam Research shares were up 8% and 6%, respectively. These companies represent the infrastructure layer that must be built before any software-based AI gains can be realized.",

    "fullText": "One man is recalling a fight for his life that all started with a tiny mosquito.\n\nIn 2007, Glendale, Arizona, resident David Hancock started feeling very sick with a sudden fever and vomiting. By the time he made it to the hospital, it took doctors 10 days to diagnose him. In the meantime, he fell into a coma, suffered heart failure, his lungs filled with fluid, and his brain became inflamed.\n\n\"I was on the other side, with one foot in the other world,\" he told Deutsche Welle, which summarized his experience with West Nile virus, a disease that can be transmitted to humans through a mosquito bite.\n\nWhile most people who contract West Nile virus may never know it, one in five will experience body aches and other flu-like symptoms, according to the Cleveland Clinic. Others, like Hancock, suffer much more worrisome outcomes. Each year, more than 1,300 Americans who have contracted West Nile develop severe illness that affects the central nervous system, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. More than 130 of those end up dying, the agency adds.\n\nMeanwhile, cases of West Nile virus and other mosquito-borne illnesses such as malaria, dengue, and Zika are increasing, as rising global temperatures help mosquitoes to move into new territories and lengthen their active seasons. Many U.S. localities experienced surges in West Nile virus this year: Bell County in Texas reported six positive tests in six weeks, a spike in cases in one part of Utah led to one death, and the number of cases reported across the country in September was 40% higher than usual.\n\nOne of the most important things that anyone can do to avoid getting sick is to prevent mosquito bites. The CDC recommends using Environmental Protection Agency-registered insect repellants; wearing long, loose-fitting clothing when you're outside and treating it with permethrin; and taking measures to control mosquitoes inside and outside the home.\n\nMany agencies assist with mosquito control efforts by spraying throughout local communities when needed. Some cities and counties are taking a more creative approach to mosquito control, too. For instance, one Florida county is using X-rays to sterilize male Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. This species can carry a number of mosquito-borne illnesses, including dengue and Zika.\n\nHow bad are the mosquitoes in your area?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "Graduate international student enrollment at US universities is down after years of steady growth amid the Trump administration's immigration clampdown.\n\nThere were almost 10,000 fewer foreign students signing at the graduate level in fall 2025, a 5.9% decline from the year before, according to data released by the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center. Meanwhile, a 3.2% increase at the undergraduate level added 5,000 students to the numbers coming from abroad, the data showed.\n\nCombined, international and domestic enrollments showed a slight increase. In total, there were 19.4 million postsecondary enrollments — 16.2 million undergraduate, and 3.2 million graduates — up from the 19.2 million enrollments the year before.\n\nInternational students are typically welcomed by school administrators because they often pay the full fees. However, in a post on X this week, the State Department said it had revoked 8,000 student visas as part of its mission to \"keep America safe.\"\n\n🚨BREAKING: The State Department has now revoked over 100,000 visas, including some 8,000 student visas and 2,500 specialized visas for individuals who had encounters with U.S. law enforcement for criminal activity.\n\nWe will continue to deport these thugs to keep America safe. pic.twitter.com/wuHVltw1bV\n\nThe State Department reopened student visa applications in June last year, having temporarily halted them.

    "description": "The stars of \"Bridgerton\" season four wore daring sets, statement ball gowns, and chic suits at the world premiere in Paris on Wednesday.",
    "fullText": "It's almost time to return to the ton, gentle reader.\n\nThe first episodes of season four of \"Bridgerton\" will drop on Netflix on January 29, with part two premiering on February 26. The season focuses on Benedict Bridgerton's love story with Sophie Baek. Luke Thompson will reprise his role as Benedict, while Yerin Ha will play Sophie.\n\nAhead of the show's Netflix release, the cast of \"Bridgerton\" gathered at the Palais Brongniart in Paris on Wednesday to celebrate the season's world premiere in red-carpet style.\n\nSome stars wore high-fashion outfits that nodded to their characters, while others missed the mark with lackluster suits or dresses that didn't fit the event.\n\nTake a look at some of the best and worst outfits from the \"Bridgerton\" season four premiere.\n\nHa, who stars as Sophie Baek in season four of \"Bridgerton,\" arrived at the premiere in an ice-blue gown designed by Prada.\n\nThe dress had a bedazzled halter neckline that matched the beading on a cutout on the bodice. The floor-length skirt featured two large pleats that cascaded into a train that trailed behind Ha as she walked the red carpet. Sparkly jewelry completed Ha's glamorous look.\n\nThe ensemble looked like a modern take on Cinderella's iconic blue dress. It was fitting since Julia Quinn's \"An Offer from a Gentleman,\" upon which season four is based, is a retelling of \"Cinderella.\"\n\nAs he stepped into the leading role of \"Bridgerton,\" Thompson wore an all-black ensemble. He paired a black suit with a black button-down shirt, a black tie, and a black flower on his lapel. The only color on the look was a sparkly tie clip.\n\nThe look was stylish, but the black pieces blended so well that it became difficult to distinguish the different elements, particularly the flower and pin.\n\nSome pops of color may have made the outfit stand out more.\n\nJessie, who plays Eloise Bridgerton, chose an oversize suit for the event.\n\nThe double-breasted jacket and pants were black, but they were adorned with an assortment of flowers in various colors to give the suit some pop. Jessie paired the suit with a slicked-back hairstyle and several earrings and rings, adding a high-fashion edge.\n\nRosheuvel, who plays Queen Charlotte, wore a floor-length sweater dress from Sonney for the premiere. The burnt orange look had a slight sparkle and a cowl neckline, and Rosheuvel wore a matching coat and color-coordinated earrings.\n\nThe outfit was stylish, but it didn't feel formal enough for the red-carpet event. It may have worked better for a daytime press event, or Rosheuvel could have chosen a dress with the same silhouette in a different fabric.\n\nAlli, who plays Lord John Stirling on \"Bridgerton,\" wore an oversize black suit to the event.\n\nHe paired the suit with a white shirt, which he wore without a tie, and it peeked out from the cuffs of his jacket. He added a small silver brooch to his lapel for a chic addition.\n\nThe modern take on a tuxedo exuded high fashion.\n\nDodd, who married John Stirling as Francesca Bridgerton in season three of \"Bridgerton,\" chose a black Giambattista Valli Paris set for the premiere.\n\nThe top was a black, cropped shrug with a V-neck and a button closure that revealed her midriff. It was paired with a low-waisted, calf-length skirt that poofed out around her, giving it a ball-gown feel despite the modern silhouette.\n\nBlack heels and silver jewelry tied Dodd's stylish look together.\n\nThe Lady Danbury actor's custom Torlowei gown for the premiere was beautiful, with a high neckline and black lace detailing.\n\nHowever, Andoh's open-toed black shoes didn't quite match the dress, as they seemed less formal than the gown. Different shoes and statement earrings could have better accented the ensemble.\n\nLeung, who will make her debut on \"Bridgerton\" as Lady Araminta Gun, walked the red carpet in a black Toni Maticevski dress.\n\nIts strapless, scooped neckline formed points for a touch of drama before flowing into a corset bodice. The skirt was structured, poofing out around her waist in a dramatic ball-gown shape before flowing back into a pencil skirt. The center of the dress was made of ribbed fabric, adding dimension.\n\nChopard jewelry and strappy Christian Louboutin heels completed the look. Between the classic detailing, modern flair, and dark color, the dress was the perfect red-carpet companion for the wicked stepmother role Leung will play on the show.\n\nRhimes looked every bit the queen of the ton in the silver gown she wore to the premiere, which was styled by Dana Asher Levine.\n\nThe strapless gown had a slight point in the center of the straight neckline, and it cinched at Rhimes' waist with a belt. The entire gown was covered in silver and bronze sequins arranged in vertical strips, shimmering as Rhimes walked.\n\nThe pièce de résistance was a cape that coordinated with the gown. It sat on Rhimes' shoulder and flowed to the floor, giving the look a regal edge that was more than fitting for the occasion.",

    "fullText": "Bangladesh's cricketers have begun a boycott of all forms of cricket in response to comments made by a national cricket board director, which have led to his removal.\n\nBoth of Thursday's matches in the Bangladesh Premier League (BPL) have been postponed, while the national side's participation in February's T20 World Cup is in doubt.\n\nThe Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) announced it has removed M Nazmul Islam from his position as chair of its financial committee after he suggested players should shoulder the financial burden if Bangladesh were to withdraw from the World Cup.\n\nThe comments came amid political tensions between Bangladesh and host nation India.\n\nThe BCB has formally requested that all Bangladesh's matches are staged elsewhere in order to participate in the tournament.\n\nAll of Pakistan's fixtures are to be played in Sri Lanka, with the BCB seeking a similar arrangement.\n\nAsked about the financial implications should Bangladesh be required to withdraw, Islam said: \"Why [would there be]? Are we asking them for the crores and crores of taka [Bangladesh's currency] that we are spending on them? Answer me first.\n\n\"We are spending so much money on them, they are not being able to do anything in different places. Have we got any international awards? What have we done at any level?\n\n\"Let us now ask them for the money back after every time they couldn't play. Give us back. Why should there even be a question of compensating the players?\"\n\nOne Bangladeshi crore is equivalent to just over £60,000.\n\nIslam's comments drew a swift response from Mohammad Mithun, president of the Cricketers Welfare Association of Bangladesh (CWAB).\n\n\"The remark made by the BCB director has hurt the cricket fraternity greatly and it's not acceptable,\" Mithun told reporters on Wednesday evening.\n\n\"We demand his resignation. If he doesn't resign before tomorrow's match, we will announce a boycott of all cricket, starting from the BPL matches tomorrow.\"\n\nNeither side arrived for Thursday's match between Chattogram Royals and Noakhali Express, with that fixture and the later match between Rajshahi Warriors and Sylhet Titans confirmed as being postponed.\n\nThe BCB, in removing Islam from his position, stated: \"Following a review of recent developments and in the best interest of the organisation, the Bangladesh Cricket Board president has decided to release Mr Najmul Islam from his responsibilities as chairman of the finance committee with immediate effect.\n\n\"The BCB reiterates that the interests of the cricketers remain its highest priority. The board remains fully committed to upholding the honour and dignity of all players under its jurisdiction.\"\n\nIt said all cricketers should \"display the highest standards of professionalism and dedication to the betterment of Bangladesh cricket during what is a challenging period for the game\" and called for BPL matches to be played as planned.\n\nBangladesh's T20 World Cup campaign is scheduled to begin on Saturday, 7 February against West Indies in Kolkata, with a match against England on Saturday, 14 February due to take place at the same venue, Eden Gardens.\n\nThe Bangladesh Premier League has six group games left to play, leading into a four-match knockout stage, finishing with a final in Dhaka on Friday, 23 January.",

By Sunday morning, sports fans across the United Kingdom knew the country had a new world champion - its fifth reigning male titleholder.\n\n\"I feel like it's still yet to sink in properly now. But in a way it's not as big of a shock to me because it's something I always worked towards,\" Smith says.\n\n\"In the way I did it, overseas and everything against us, I feel like it made the story that much better.\"\n\nBBC Sport looks at how Smith overcame the odds to pull off one of the most striking British victories on American soil.",

Led by Professor Mario Siervo of the Curtin School of Population Health in Perth, Western Australia, and surveying 317 students from five Australian universities with a median age of 20 years old, the study found that \"high gamers\"--people whose playtime exceeded 10 hours a week--were at greater risk of dietary issues, sleep deprivation, and weight gain.",

    "description": "Greenland's natural resources and proximity to Russia and China have made it a valuable strategic asset to the US military since World War II.",
    "fullText": "Visitors to Pituffik Space Base in Greenland are greeted by a sign welcoming them to the \"top of the world.\"\n\nAs the US military's northernmost installation, Pituffik Space Base's operations include scientific research, space surveillance, and missile detection.\n\nGreenland's abundant natural resources and proximity to Russia and China have made it a valuable strategic asset since World War II — so much so that US President Donald Trump has often expressed his intent to purchase the autonomous Danish territory.\n\nVice President JD Vance and second lady Usha Vance visited the military base in March 2025 amid rising tensions between the US, Denmark, and Greenland.\n\nThose tensions have continued to flare as Trump has refused to rule out the use of military force to take control of Greenland. In a Truth Social post on Wednesday, Trump wrote that the US \"needs Greenland\" and \"anything less than that is unacceptable.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Denmark increased its military presence in Greenland, citing \"security tensions.\" Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio also met with the foreign ministers of Denmark and Greenland on Wednesday.\n\nHere's a look inside Greenland's only US military base.\n\nTrump first expressed interest in buying Greenland, the world's largest island and an autonomous Danish territory, during his first presidency. In addition to being rich in natural resources, Greenland's Arctic location is well-placed to further US interests by countering China and Russia.\n\nSince his reelection, Trump has repeatedly conveyed his desire to acquire Greenland and said he would not rule out the use of military force to take it.\n\n\"We need Greenland for national security. One way or the other we're going to get it,\" he said in his joint address to Congress in March 2025.\n\nBoth Denmark and Greenland's leaders have maintained that the island is not for sale.\n\nSecond lady Usha Vance was originally scheduled to visit Greenland on a solo trip in 2025 to \"visit historical sites, learn about Greenlandic heritage, and attend the Avannaata Qimussersua, Greenland's national dogsled race,\" the White House said.\n\nInstead, the trip was scaled back. The vice president and second lady visited Pituffik Space Base in Greenland, the US military's northernmost installation, in March.\n\nUsha Vance's solo trip could have violated diplomatic protocol by sending a delegation to another country without an invitation. The amended plan — visiting a US base — avoided that potential violation. While Trump said that \"people from Greenland are asking us to go there,\" the government of Greenland said they had not invited any foreign delegations to visit.\n\n\"Just for the record, Naalakkersuisut, the government of Greenland, has not extended any invitations for any visits, neither private nor official,\" the government's official Facebook page wrote in a post on Monday.\n\nGreenland's then-prime minister, Múte Bourup Egede, also called Usha Vance's planned trip \"very aggressive\" in an interview with Sermitsiaq, a Greenlandic newspaper.\n\nTaylor Van Kirk, JD Vance's press secretary, told Business Insider at the time that the vice president and second lady were \"proud\" to visit the US military base in Greenland.\n\n\"As the vice president has said, previous US leaders have neglected Arctic security, while Greenland's Danish rulers have neglected their security obligations to the island. The security of Greenland is critical in ensuring the security of the rest of the world, and the Vice President looks forward to learning more about the island.\"\n\nWhile the US doesn't own Greenland, it has had a military presence there since World War II.\n\nPituffik Space Base, originally named Thule Air Base, was formally established in 1951 as part of a Cold War-era defense treaty between the US and Denmark. It is located in Pituffik, Greenland, 750 miles north of the Arctic Circle and halfway between New York and Moscow.\n\nAs a Danish territory, Greenland does not have a military of its own.\n\nAs the Pentagon's northernmost military base, Pituffik Space Base acts as a key Arctic defense outpost. Because of its location on the \"top of the world,\" it is an optimal vantage point for monitoring missile launches by US adversaries like Russia and establishing space superiority.\n\nThe base is the site of a phased-array radar, which can detect sea-launched and intercontinental ballistic missiles, and a surface-to-air missile system, which intercepts hostile threats.\n\nThe base has a Satellite Command and Control system to maintain real-time communications and data relay with military and intelligence satellites. Its high-altitude location also allows it to more frequently track polar-orbit satellites, which can monitor the entire Earth's surface over time as the planet rotates below them.\n\nBecause Pituffik's primary mission is space surveillance and missile warning, the space base doesn't house a permanently stationed fighter wing or naval fleet.\n\nInstead, it acts as a strategic logistics and defense hub for Arctic missions and under-ice operations. From the site, which is the world's northernmost deep-water seaport, surface vessels and submarines operated by the US Navy and allied forces conduct Arctic patrols and cold-weather training exercises.\n\nAircraft regularly fly in and out of the former air base, such as military cargo and refueling planes and maritime patrol aircraft. Occasionally, fighter jets and long-range bombers will fly to the base for Arctic deterrence deployments and training flights.\n\nWhile it doesn't have a permanent combat force, the Air Force does have one tugboat at Pituffik to support port operations, icebreaking, and maneuvering ships.\n\nA small but significant asset, the Rising Star helps keep supply routes open by breaking up and pushing floating ice. The tugboat guides supply ships through the port, making it a critical component in bringing fuel, food, and equipment to personnel year-round.\n\nHowever, since the base is locked in by ice for nine months of the year, the Rising Star gets limited use because it can only be operated when the port is completely ice-free.\n\nPituffik Space Base is surrounded by ice for nine months out of every year. The closest town, the Inuit village of Qaanaaq, is located 65 miles away.\n\nTemperatures can range from 60 degrees Fahrenheit in the summer, when there are 24 hours of daylight, to -50 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, when there is no sunlight for weeks.\n\nWinter storms are categorized into five levels from least to most severe: Normal, Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, and Delta. At the Bravo level, the buddy system is implemented so that no one walks outside alone. Non-essential facilities close at the Charlie level, and personnel must shelter in place during Delta storms.\n\nAbout 150 personnel are stationed at Pituffik.\n\nThe Dundas Buffet Dining Hall on base serves three meals a day with payments accepted through a meal card.\n\nThe Base Exchange, also known as \"BX,\" sells groceries, toiletries, souvenirs, and other assorted goods. It also houses a barber shop.\n\nThere are no ATMs at Pituffik Space Base, but the Base Exchange accepts debit and credit cards as well as US dollars.\n\nPituffik Space Base features a bowling alley, a chapel, and a community center with a theater and craft room.\n\nThere's also a gymnasium and workout room stocked with weights and treadmills.\n\nPituffik Space Base's official Facebook page shows personnel participating in recreational events such as a Hawaiian-themed Arctic luau party, Greenlandic Heritage Week, and cross-country skiing.\n\nThe US built airbases and weather stations across the ice sheet during World War II as refueling stops on transatlantic flights and supply routes.\n\nTwo decommissioned airbases are now being used as civilian airports, and a third was abandoned after the war ended.\n\nDuring the Cold War, the US Air Force also built four stations on Greenland's coasts as part of a larger communication network of more than 60 radar installations to detect Soviet bombers. Most of the stations have since been deactivated, left to deteriorate atop Greenland's ice sheet.\n\nIn 2024, NASA scientists detected an underground base for a top-secret Cold War-era missile operation known as Camp Century. Now buried 100 feet under the ice, the abandoned network of subterranean tunnels once operated under the guise of an Arctic research facility before the US government declassified it in 1995.\n\nBut the abandoned military sites represent more than just relics of past global conflicts. Thousands of gallons of biological, chemical, and radioactive waste left behind on the bases pose a significant environmental threat, especially as the planet warms.\n\nThe US military failed to clean up decommissioned facilities like Camp Century, assuming the ice sheet would entomb the waste and infrastructure over the years.\n\nHowever, at the current melting rate of the Arctic, researchers estimate that the waste could resurface around 2100. The question remains as to who is responsible for cleaning up the waste from abandoned US military facilities scattered throughout Greenland.\n\nThe US has long pursued access to or control over Greenland due to its strategic and economic significance, dating back as early as the late 19th century.\n\nSince his return to the White House, Trump has continued to double down on his ambitions to secure the self-governing territory within the Kingdom of Denmark, saying he won't rule out military force or economic coercion to do so.\n\nThough the Danish government has remained steadfast in refusing the sale, Trump's so-called \"real estate deal\" has spotlighted Greenland's growing desire for independence from Denmark and disinterest in being owned by anybody, including the US.\n\n\"The time has come to stand together,\" Greenland Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said at a press conference on Tuesday, appearing with Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen. \"It has not been easy to stand up to completely unacceptable pressure from our closest allies for a lifetime. But there is much to suggest that the hardest part is still ahead of us.\"",

    "fullText": "The biggest ethereum holding company in the world is betting big on the digital finance ambitions of one of the world's top online content creators.\n\nTom Lee, the cofounder of global investment advisory firm Fundstrat Global Advisors, announced on Thursday that Bitmine Immersion Technologies is investing $200 million in Beast Industries, the holding company founded by YouTube star MrBeast.\n\nJimmy Donaldson, better known by his social media moniker, announced plans to launch a financial services platform in December, and Lee said on Thursday that he believes it will play a pivotal role in one of the financial sector's fastest-growing markets.\n\nBeast Industries CEO Jeff Housenbold also hinted at a future partnership, saying in a statement: \"We look forward to exploring ways to further collaborate and incorporate DeFi into our upcoming financial services platform.\"\n\nIn June 2025, Lee led Bitmine's strategic pivot from operating as a bitcoin miner to becoming the world's largest ethereum treasury, helping usher in last year's investor craze for digital asset holding strategies.\n\n\"MrBeast and Beast Industries, in our view, is the leading content creator of our generation, with a reach and engagement unmatched with Gen Z, Gen Alpha and Millennials,\" he said. \"Beast Industries is the largest and most innovative creator based platform in the world and our corporate and personal values are strongly aligned.\"\n\nLee said on CNBC that he sees his bet on Beast Industries as a rising player in a broader movement to tokenize assets on the blockchain.\n\n\"Digitalization of not only dollars, but stocks and equities, is going to take place and over time, that really blurs what is a service versus what's digital money,\" he added. \"That's where a collaboration and investment into Beast Industries makes sense.\"\n\nCompanies such as Robinhood have recently embraced asset tokenization, viewing it as a way to offer investors exposure to companies that might still be private or to allow investors to more easily trade hard assets like real estate.\n\nBeast Industries, for its part, has been laying the groundwork for a financial services venture for a while. In a pitch deck shared in early 2025, which was viewed by Business Insider, it described customized offerings that would target MrBeast's audience, supported by financial literacy content. The deck listed nine potential offerings, including student loans, insurance, and credit insights. It said the company would launch by partnering with a fintech company to leverage its existing infrastructure \"while avoiding regulatory, credit risk, and capital requirement.\"\n\nDonaldson has also said he's looking to build a financial literacy-focused channel.\n\nBeast Industries took in over $400 million in revenue in 2024, according to investor materials viewed by Business Insider. The company lost money last year, mainly because of high costs in its media business. Recently, the company has been on a cost-cutting push as it looks to reduce media-related losses.\n\nIn 2025, the social media star sought to raise $200 million to extend a $300 million Series C round he'd raised in 2024 at a $5 billion valuation, according to investment materials viewed by Business Insider.\n\nDonaldson's company has been pitching investors on the idea of building the \"next Disney.\" Like Disney, Beast Industries is looking to expand well beyond video into different product categories.",

This is “confessional commerce,” a model in which value is created through candid, contextual disclosure and sustained by how products respond to it. Drawing on research from clinical psychology and real-world product building, well-designed interactions can reduce shame, invite deeper honesty, and build trust over time. By applying five principles that psychologists use to elicit meaningful disclosure, teams can pair AI’s predictive power with psychological attunement, creating feedback loops in which better responses lead to greater openness and, ultimately, more effective personalization.",

    "fullText": "STOCKHOLM/LONDON, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Elon Musk's Grok chatbot is testing Europe's ability to clamp down on deepfakes and digital undressing of images online, even after regulators scored a rare win by forcing Musk's xAI to curb the creation of sexualized images.\n\nxAI said late on Wednesday ​it had restricted image editing for Grok AI users after the chatbot churned out thousands of sexualized images of women and minors that alarmed global regulators.\n\nThe ‌climb-down by Musk, who initially laughed off the trend, highlights the difficulty of policing AI tools that make it cheap and easy to create explicit content. It is the latest clash between Europe and Musk, following rows ‌over election interference, content moderation and free speech.\n\nMany regulators are still scrambling to develop laws and rules to govern AI, with question marks over what constitutes nudity, how to define consent, and who bears responsibility: the user or the platform.\n\n\"It's really a grey zone with regards to the creation of the nude images,\" Ängla Pändel, a Stockholm-based data protection and privacy lawyer with Mannheimer Swartling, told Reuters.\n\nBritish regulator Ofcom, one of the most vocal on the issue, welcomed the move by Musk, but said its investigation into xAI over the Grok images would continue.\n\n\"Our formal investigation remains ⁠ongoing,\" a spokesperson said. \"We are working round the clock to ‌progress this and get answers into what went wrong and what's being done to fix it.\"\n\nSTRONGEST ENFORCEMENT STILL NEEDED, OFFICIALS SAY\n\nEarlier this month, Grok created hyper-realistic images of women on X manipulated to look like they were in tiny bikinis, degrading poses or even covered in bruises. ‍Some minors were digitally stripped down to swimwear.\n\nUntil Wednesday, Reuters found the chatbot still produced sexualized images privately on demand. That appeared to have been curbed at least in certain geographies on Thursday.\n\nMusk's xAI said it was blocking users from generating images of people in skimpy attire in \"jurisdictions where it's illegal\". It did not identify those jurisdictions.\n\nIn Malaysia and Indonesia the government has imposed temporary bans on Grok, ​while EU and UK regulators called the images unlawful. The UK, France and Italy launched probes, but faced calls for tougher action.\n\n\"Stronger enforcement under the Digital Services Act (DSA) ‌is needed to stop apps and platforms that sexualise or nudify women and children,\" said Christian Democrat MEP Nina Carberry, who called the latest move a \"positive step\".\n\n⁠A European Commission spokesperson said that if the Grok changes were not effective, the Commission would still use the full enforcement toolbox of the EU's DSA against the platform.\n\nLEGAL GREY AREA, HEAVY BURDEN ON VICTIMS\n\nThe UK's Online Safety Act makes the sharing of intimate images without consent, including AI-generated deepfakes, a 'priority offence', said Alexander Brown, a UK-based data protection lawyer at Simmons & Simmons.\n\n\"This means X must take proactive, proportionate steps to prevent such content from appearing on its platform and to swiftly remove it when detected,\" he said.\n\nBritain's regulator can fine a company up to 10% ⁠of revenue in the most serious cases of non-compliance or ask a court to require internet service ​providers to block the site.\n\nFor individuals, taking platforms to court is \"a really difficult and heavy process,” said ​Anders Bergsten, a lawyer at Mannheimer Swartling, citing the emotional toll on victims.\n\nDeepfakes have existed for years, well before the advent of the AI apps, though they were largely confined to the darker corners of the web. The publishing power of X gives Grok unprecedented reach.\n\n\"The frictionless publishing capability enables ‍the deepfakes to spread at scale,\" said U.S.-based ⁠lawyer Carrie Goldberg, who works with cyber harassment victims.\n\nLaws in Britain and Sweden make the non-consensual sharing of nude images illegal. Britain is widening the law to include the making of such images.\n\nUnder the DSA, suspending a service is considered a last resort. The EU AI Act also does not have any provision for nude ⁠images of adults, only transparency obligations for deepfakes, experts said.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Keir Starmer welcomed X's move on Thursday but warned: \"Free speech is not the freedom to violate consent. Young women's images are not public property, ‌and their safety is not up for debate.\"\n\n\"If we need to strengthen existing laws further, we are prepared to do that.\"",

    "fullText": "Tottenham Hotspur are in discussions with Brazilian side Bahia over a permanent transfer for striker Alejo Veliz as they look to move the Argentina international on.\n\nTalks are ongoing between the clubs, with no fee agreed at this stage, but there is a shared willingness to explore a deal that would see Veliz leave North London on a permanent basis.\n\nAny agreement would require Veliz’s current loan spell at Rosario Central to be terminated early, despite the deal originally running until June 2026.\n\nThe 22-year-old returned to his boyhood club last summer after an underwhelming first year in Europe and has shown signs of recovery in familiar surroundings.\n\nVeliz has scored five goals in 16 appearances for Rosario since rejoining them, offering enough encouragement to attract external interest once again.\n\nHis time at Tottenham has been limited, with all eight of his senior appearances for the club coming during the 2023–24 season.\n\nVeliz’s only goal for Spurs arrived in a 4-2 Premier League defeat to Brighton & Hove Albion in December 2023, when he scored as a late substitute.\n\nLoan spells away from Tottenham have produced mixed returns, including an unproductive stint at Sevilla and a more stable period at Espanyol in La Liga, where he scored four times in 16 outings.\n\nBahia’s interest represents a potential fresh start, with the Brazilian side finishing seventh in Serie A last season and qualifying for the Copa Libertadores preliminary rounds.\n\nThe club are majority-owned by City Football Group and have been active in strengthening their squad ahead of a demanding continental campaign.\n\nFrom Tottenham’s perspective, the move would bring clarity to a situation that has remained unresolved since Veliz’s arrival from Rosario Central in 2023.\n\nSpurs paid around £13 million for the striker as a teenager, viewing him as a long-term project with physical and aerial qualities suited to the Premier League.\n\nHowever, a lack of consistent opportunities, coupled with adaptation issues, prevented him from establishing himself under successive managers.\n\nTottenham are now open to a clean break, with the expectation that a permanent sale would better serve both player and club.\n\nVeliz, for his part, is understood to be open to the move as he seeks regular football and a more defined role.\n\nSpurs are currently 14th in the Premier League and have been reshaping their squad during the winter transfer window.\n\nThey completed the signing of midfielder Conor Gallagher from Atletico Madrid earlier this week, underlining their focus on immediate impact players.\n\nA Veliz exit would continue that process, closing the chapter on a transfer that never fully took off.\n\nThe deal would represent a significant investment for Bahia in a forward still viewed as having untapped potential.\n\nWhether a final agreement can be reached will depend on bridging the gap in valuation over the coming days.",

    "title": "Nearly 5M Accounts Removed Under Australia's New Social Media Ban",
    "description": "Governments around the world are watching the rollout of the landmark law, which made it illegal for those under 16 to have accounts.",
    "fullText": "Nearly five million social media accounts belonging to Australian teenagers have been deactivated or removed, a month after a landmark law barring those younger than 16 from using the services took effect, the government said on Thursday.\n\nThe announcement was the first reported metric reflecting the rollout of the law, which is being closely watched by several other countries weighing whether the regulation can be a blueprint for protecting children from the harms of social media, or a cautionary tale highlighting the challenges of such attempts.\n\nThe law required 10 social media platforms, including Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat and Reddit, to prevent users under 16 from accessing their services. Under the law, which came into force in December, failure by the companies to take “reasonable steps” to remove underage users could lead to fines of up to 49.5 million Australian dollars, about $33 million.\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese has praised the law as a world-first attempt to shield young teens from the mental health detriments and potential abuses of social media. On Thursday, he said it was encouraging to see social media companies making a meaningful effort to keep children off their platforms.\n\n“Change doesn’t happen overnight,” he said. “But these early signs show it’s important we’ve acted to make this change.”\n\nThe number of removed accounts offered only a limited picture of the ban’s impact. Many teenagers have said in the weeks since the law took effect that they were able to get around the ban by lying about their age, or that they could easily bypass verification systems.\n\nThe country’s online safety regulator tasked with enforcing and tracking the law, the eSafety Commissioner, did not release a detailed breakdown beyond announcing that the companies had “removed access” to about 4.7 million accounts belonging to children under 16.\n\nMeta, the parent company of Instagram and Facebook, said this week that it had removed almost 550,000 accounts of users younger than 16 before the ban came into effect.\n\nSeveral governments around the world, including Denmark, the European Union, France, New Zealand and Malaysia, have said they are considering similar bans. Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain told members of Parliament this week that he was considering it, according to reports.\n\nJulie Inman Grant, the eSafety Commissioner, acknowledged there would still be some underage teenagers on social media, but said the law’s success should ultimately be measured by a broader reduction in harm that could take years to become apparent.\n\n“Speed limits, for instance, are not a failure because some people speed,” she said. “Most would agree that roads are safer because of them.”\n\nJack Okill, 15, was among the teenagers who found themselves locked out of their social media accounts last month. He had built a following of 1,500 people on Instagram, which he used to connect with his peers and promote his political podcast, “Your First Vote.”\n\n“I was quite frankly annoyed when I opened my phone, went on Instagram to check what’s happening, and it just said I’m logged out,” he said.\n\nJack said he created a new Instagram account using his mother’s details to post his content until he turns 16 later this year, when he will be able to reclaim his old account. His mother manages the new account, he said.\n\nWhile he understood the need to limit exposure to harmful content and to stop online abuse, he said the government should have forced companies to make their platforms a safe place for children, rather than impose a blanket ban.\n\n“I’m old enough to know what’s happening in the world,” he said. “But the government is treating us like children.”\n\nAnother Australian teen, 14-year-old Raeve, said that he was able to continue using his YouTube account by changing his age and that his account on Reddit remained active. Most of his peers seem unaffected by the ban, he said.\n\n“It’s undoubtedly done nothing, from my view,” said Raeve, who asked that he only be identified by his first name because he is a minor. His father was prompted by YouTube on his own account to verify his age with an ID or a photo, while Raeve’s account was not flagged, according to the teenager.\n\nHe said he was well attuned to the pitfalls of social media, having been bullied for videos he posted when he was 9 years old. He has also observed a schoolmate who appeared to become steeped in far-right, racist views from things he was exposed to on social media, he said.\n\nEven though Raeve was happy that he could still access his accounts, he said he was disappointed in what he felt was an inadequate effort by the government to make sure that young people were more thoroughly protected from the dangers of social media.\n\nCritics of the law have also cautioned that a blanket ban may disproportionately affect minorities, teens living in remote areas who connect with peers online, or young people living with disabilities who may have found communities through social media.",
