Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nHad Marcell Ozuna not had the season he did in 2025, he likely would be the most sought-after DH in this free agency cycle. However, that isn’t the case, and teams currently view him as a potential risk to sign. The Atlanta Braves attempted to trade him several times last season, but he refused every offer.\n\n“It’s possible that while Anthopoulos was discussing trades, he couldn’t agree on a deal that Ozuna’s agent could also sign off on. Just because Ozuna is leaving the deadline out of his hands doesn’t mean the 10-5 rights go out the window. He could have simply handed over those rights to his agent for the discussions,” SI’s Harrison Smajovits wrote.\n\nWith Ozuna aging and other factors at play, he isn’t an especially appealing free agent candidate so far this offseason.\n\n“The problem Ozuna faces now is that he has only gotten older, his performance last season was subpar at best, and the teams that were previously considered to be landing spots for him feel unlikely to pursue him this offseason especially with how more and more organizations are treating the DH position,” HTHB’s Eric Cole wrote.\n\nFanSided’s Christopher Kline believes the Cleveland Guardians could sign Ozuna to a low-risk deal, adding protection in the lineup alongside José Ramírez.\n\n“This Cleveland Guardians team desperately needs more pop in the heart of the lineup. Kyle Manzardo made a strong first impression as a rookie. Chase DeLauter and Travis Bazzana are coming behind him as top prospects who can rip it. But even if it's a one-year deal, Ozuna has the goods to protect José Ramírez in the heart of the order and pop a few more dingers than Cleveland fans are used to,” Kline wrote.\n\nThe Guardians won the AL Central last year after a late-season comeback against the Detroit Tigers. Ozuna, meanwhile, just wants to finish his career on a strong note after a difficult 2025 season.\n\nCleveland is a playoff-caliber team that could benefit from Ozuna’s bat and veteran presence in the clubhouse. This type of one-year deal could pay major dividends for the Guardians.",

    "description": "Brian Cox once toured as a keyboardist in major rock and pop bands. Now he’s a particle physicist on a new world tour with a dazzling show he designed in an era of science disinformation and denial.",
    "fullText": "Stefano Montali traveled to Redditch, England, in November to attend a warm-up show for Prof. Brian Cox’s coming world tour.\n\nProf. Brian Cox flashed a wide smile toward the crowd, picked up an iPad, looked up at the enormous screen behind him and started to write out a complex equation. “This is what I call a live math solo,” he said.\n\nThe audience chuckled. Many in the packed theater that night last month in the small English town of Redditch seemed to be in on the joke.\n\nBecause before he became Brian Cox, the particle physicist renowned for his adroitness in explaining the intricacies and magnificence of space, he was Brian Cox the rock star.\n\nHis first professional gig, in fact, was playing keyboards in the opening band on a tour with Jimmy Page, the lead guitarist of Led Zeppelin. His second band, D:Ream, had a song that hit No. 1 on the British pop charts in 1994.\n\nNow, Professor Cox is the star of his own show, albeit one about science.\n\nHe has sold out venues often reserved for sports and pop stars, like Wembley Arena (not the stadium) and the O2 in London. His coming tour, “Emergence,” will take him to places like Singapore, Serbia and Australia, before arriving in the United States in late 2026.\n\n“If you believe, as I do, that science is one of the necessary foundations of society, alongside the arts and politics,” Professor Cox said in an interview, “it has to be there with them on an equal footing.”\n\nWith his geniality, Beatles-esque haircut and a dazzling show that explores black holes, galaxies and the significance — and insignificance — of human beings in the universe, Professor Cox, 57, has reached mainstream audiences, when many scientists cannot.\n\nNeil deGrasse Tyson, the astrophysicist and popular science communicator, said in an interview that Professor Cox, whom he has known for years, “has a force of rationality, and a force of reason, and a force of science.” He added, “Society needs all three, lest we regress back to the caves whence we came.”\n\nIn an era when science denial and disinformation are common, Professor Cox, who teaches particle physics at the University of Manchester, has sought to make science accessible through Peabody Award-winning BBC documentaries and podcasts, books and appearances on other media, like “The Joe Rogan Experience.”\n\nThis year, the United Nations named Professor Cox its Champion for Space, a role in which he will work with the organization to promote space as a “force for progress.”\n\nAs a child, Professor Cox spent many Saturday mornings at the Manchester Airport, near his hometown, Oldham, England, spotting planes with his father. “I liked the engineering, the big machines,” he said. “The Apollo moon landings, astronomy, science fiction — I wanted to see ‘Star Wars,’ ‘Star Trek,’ ‘Alien,’ all of it.”\n\nEventually, Professor Cox’s interests expanded to include music.\n\nAt 18, he deferred going to university for a year to join the band Dare, founded by a member of Thin Lizzy who lived nearby. The band recorded its debut album with A&M Records in Joni Mitchell’s private studio.\n\nAfter one London show where Dare opened for Jimmy Page, Professor Cox said he found himself having a drink backstage with George Harrison.\n\nEven while touring, Professor Cox read popular science books.\n\nHe left Dare at 23 — after a bar fight with his bandmates in Berlin, he said — to study physics and astronomy at the University of Manchester. He soon joined D:Ream, whose No. 1 pop anthem “Things Can Only Get Better” was later appropriated by the Labour Party.\n\nEventually, he left that band to shift his focus to science. Stints at particle accelerators in Hamburg, Chicago and Geneva followed.\n\nIn 2001, Professor Cox met Gia Milinovich, a TV presenter and writer, whom he married two years later at her mother’s house in Duluth, Minn. The pair started writing documentary ideas “with the sole aim of ‘making science part of popular culture,’” she told The Guardian in 2010. Today, they live in London with their 16-year-old son, George.\n\nStill, the draw to the stage never truly left Professor Cox, who eventually found his way back to it.\n\nThe show in Redditch, about 45 minutes south of Birmingham, was the beginning of a slate of warm-up performances. For Professor Cox, they are a chance to work out new material. The show changes night to night.\n\nProfessor Cox’s enthusiasm is as much a character in the show as the planets and the stars. He kept the audience captivated, even on topics that might seem out of reach, like the origin of space and time or quantum entanglement.\n\nDavid Attenborough, whose nature documentaries on the BBC helped carve out a place for science presenters on television, said in 2013, “If I had a torch, I would hand it to Brian Cox.”\n\nBut the worlds in which Mr. Attenborough first rose to fame and in which Professor Cox works now couldn’t be more different. Disinformation on social media has contributed to a growing skepticism of experts.\n\n“Our instinct, which is a good instinct,” Professor Cox said, “is to say, ‘I want to listen to as many voices as possible.’” Still, he stressed that there needed to be a weighting to people who have expertise.\n\nBut his expertise has been poached by hyper-realistic deepfakes. Days before the Redditch show, several appeared online depicting him falsely claiming that the 3I/ATLAS comet, which was passing through the solar system, was an alien spacecraft.\n\nThe mother of a friend of his was so convinced by the deepfake that she was “starting to hoard things,” Professor Cox said the friend told him.\n\nWith the deepfakes multiplying and looking increasingly realistic, the effort to take them down can feel like full-time job, he said.\n\nEarlier in his career, Professor Cox made light of conspiracies.\n\nWhile he was working in Geneva at CERN on the Large Hadron Collider, or LHC, several doomsday theories circulated online claiming the accelerator could cause the end of the universe by creating microscopic black holes.\n\n“My first instinct was to laugh it off,” Professor Cox said. He told the The Daily Telegraph that “anyone who thinks the LHC will destroy the world” is a fool, though he used a word that many find offensive.\n\nIt caused an uproar. “It’s probably my most famous quote,” Professor Cox said.\n\nBut he says he came to understand of conspiracy theories that it’s important to be sensitive that even if people believe in something that isn’t true, the strong emotion that belief can evoke — panic or fear, in the case of the collider — is real.\n\n“If people are getting information that’s saying that there’s a chance that the world will be destroyed,” he said, “it’s not silly to be worried about that.”\n\nHe has appeared three times in the past decade on Joe Rogan’s podcast. While he acknowledges that Mr. Rogan and his guests have indulged in conspiracy theories or denial about climate change and other accepted science, Professor Cox regards the appearances as an opportunity to reach an important new audience.\n\nAt the start of his show in Redditch, Professor Cox appeared in front of a projection of the Charles Bridge in Prague on a snowy night, and he told the story of how the astronomer Johannes Kepler pondered the physical makeup of a six-pointed snowflake. Eventually, the visual zoomed deeper and deeper into one of the falling snowflakes, revealing its intricacy.\n\nAs he stood to the side of the stage in the dark, Professor Cox described how Kepler’s bridge walk, along with Galileo’s discovery of Jupiter’s four largest moons, contributed to a revolution in science — a refocusing away from the reliance on ancient knowledge and toward the modern method of observation and questioning.\n\nThat drive for discovery, Professor Cox said, lies at the center of his show and at the heart of his questions. How do we acquire reliable knowledge? How do we remove our opinion and biases?\n\n“Certainty is kind of a brutish thing,” he said, “it doesn’t really get you anywhere.”\n\nAs for the music world, Professor Cox still has a toe in. He reunited with D:Ream, onstage at the Glastonbury Festival in 2024. And at another event, he said, he was approached by a fan who expressed his awe at a show Professor Cox had done about Enceladus, one of Saturn’s moons.",

    "title": "Patience, Sabres Fans – World Junior Success Doesn't Guarantee Buffalo's Prospects A Successful NHL Future",
    "description": "The Buffalo Sabres will have four players at the 2026 IIHF World Junior Championship. But success at the World Junior tournament offers little guarantee prospects of NHL success. While World Junior glory would be great, the Sabres' youngsters need more time and patience to develop.",
    "fullText": "In more recent seasons, the Buffalo Sabres had more players at the annual IIHF World Junior Championship tournament. But it’s a measure of how things have changed for the Sabres that, in the 2026 World Juniors, only four Buffalo youngsters are involved. The leading teams in terms of involvement at the World Juniors are the Nashville Predators and Utah Mammoth, who each have seven players playing. And given where those teams stand in their development, they should have that many players involved.\n\nBut while the Sabres will have less of a footprint on this year’s World Junior tournament, there’s still reason for Buffalo fans to tune in. Whether it’s watching Team U.S.A. players and Sabres prospects Brodie Ziemer, Adam Kleber and Luke Osburn, or Team Czechia's Radim Mrtka, the Sabres will still have plenty of players taking part in this best-on-best tourney.\n\nThe reality of where the Sabres are in competitive cycle means that they should be expecting to have fewer players at the World Juniors down the road. There’s no direct correlation between where a team is competitively speaking and the number of World Junior players they have in any one season, but for a team like Buffalo, the organization needs to be more focused on the present than on the future.\n\nThus, even if the Americans do win gold at this year’s World Juniors and put Ziemer, Osburn and Kleber in the spotlight, when the holiday break is over, none of those players (nor Mrtka) will be immediate difference-makers at the NHL level. And that will be true of the quartet regardless of how things turn out in the next week-and-a-half. The World Juniors has a long history of players who were World Junior standouts, yet who couldn’t make that translate into NHL success.\n\nIdeally, it’s true you want all of your prospects to be needle-movers at whatever level they’re at in any point of their history. But that’s not realistic, and it’s probably unfair to prospects who are still learning what type of player they can be.\n\nFor A Christmas Present, Sabres Fans Need This More Than Anything Else Fans of the Buffalo Sabres could use more than a few presents this holiday season. But there's one thing Sabres fans crave more than run-of-the-mill holiday cheer – they're seeking genuine hope.\n\nRegardless of the hype around them, young players need the time, space and understanding to evolve and grow into the best version of themselves, and that may mean arriving at a level that some observers see as a disappointment. The prospect game is hit-and-miss, and even if the Sabres have some hits when it comes to players representing their homeland, that doesn’t mean those same players won’t be misses in hockey’s best league.\n\nSo when Sabres fans tune in to see how this year’s World Juniors plays out, they have to temper their expectations. This year’s tournament will be on home ice for the Americans, but that could increase the pressure on Buffalo’s three American players. But the best way to test those players is to put their feet into the fire and see how they respond.\n\nThe Time For New Sabres GM Kekalainen To Make A Trade Or Firing Happen In Buffalo Has Already Arrived New Buffalo Sabres' GM Jarmo Kekalainen can't be preaching patience with this Sabres group. Whether it's trading a star player or firing coach Lindy Ruff, Kekalainen must shake up the organization if Buffalo is to salvage their season.\n\nIt’s going to take more patience to see how these Sabres prospects deal with expectations, but it’s their progress once the spotlight of the World Juniors ends that will ultimately reveal more about where Buffalo’s up-and-comers are going to land as professional hockey players.\n\nGlory at the World Juniors would be great, but it isn’t the be-all and end-all. And the Sabres’ growth as a team will mean more to Buffalo fans than even a gold-medal result for the U.S. would be to them.",

    "description": "Hyundai Motorsports co-driver Martijn Wydaeghe just made co-driver round the world proud with his performance at the 2025 Rallye du Pays Vençois in France.",
    "fullText": "It takes a special kind of person to willingly strap oneself into a hatchback aimed at flying through the woods at high speeds. Rally drivers are madmen full-stop, but their shotgun-riding co-drivers are a whole different breed. Don’t discount the amount of driving know-how tucked away in those high-flying passenger seats, however. Hyundai Motorsports co-driver Martijn Wydaeghe recently took the wheel of a Hyundai i20 N Rally2 at the 2025 Rallye du Pays Vençois in France, making fellow co-drivers round the world beam with pride.\n\nWhile you might not be familiar with Martijn Wydaeghe, you have likely heard of his teammate Thierry Neuville. The two have been driving together since the 2021 season, with Wydaeghe co-driving during Neuville’s 2024 WRC Driver’s Championship effort. This year wasn’t as successful for last year’s champs, with Neuville finishing 5th overall in the standings. The results were largely tempered by two consecutive retirements at the Central Europe and Japan rallies towards the end of the season. The pair came back to win the final event of the year at Rally Saudi Arabia.\n\nWhile the automaker didn’t put Wydaeghe out in the proper Rally1 machine he’s used to riding in, the Belgian driver made his driving debut in the production-based Rally2 machine. He did previously get a go in the Rally1 car at the 2025 Goodwood Festival of Speed, however. I’m sure the co-driver-turned-wheelman wasn’t too upset about the more approachable platform for his first go either.\n\nWith co-driver Florian Haut-Labourdette alongside, Wydaeghe pushed the IXO-sponsored Hyundai through the 25-mile rally. His pace was undeniable, with Wydaeghe managing to take home a stage win on his very first attempt. The pair only managed to muster sixth place overall, but fans were more than happy to see Wydaeghe give it a shot. That said, I don’t think Neuville needs to be too worried about job security for the time being. Perhaps the WRC should look at a co-driver shootout event moving forward, though.\n\nYou Need a Torque Wrench in Your Toolbox\n\nTested: Best Car Interior Cleaners",

He works in IT and earns about $90,000 a year, while she earns roughly $55,000. He wrote that growing up lower middle class shaped his careful approach to money.\n\nUntil recently, he wrote, their everyday spending had felt manageable. He pays for most dinners, rideshares, and planned outings, estimating he covers about 60% to 70% of shared costs.

The OP said his girlfriend suggested a 10-day trip to Italy in late summer, an idea he supported. He created a rough budget covering flights, hotels, trains, food, and tours, estimating the total at about $4,500 for both of them — excluding shopping.\n\nHe suggested that if they started saving immediately, each could set aside about $400 to $450 per month over several months and split the cost evenly.\n\nAfter reviewing the spreadsheet, she laughed and questioned why he was treating the trip \"like a business contract,\" pointing out that he earns significantly more. She added that a serious partner would simply cover the trip and let her contribute in smaller ways.\n\nIn response, he wrote that he did not want to set a pattern where major expenses automatically fell on him, especially before they lived together.\n\nSee Also: This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, with minimum investments as low as $100.\n\nThe OP explained his financial priorities, including paying down student loans and building an emergency fund.

During that discussion, she compared him to an ex who never asked her to pay for vacations.\n\nSince then, he said, the tension continued. She made sarcastic comments about money during meals, and later compromise proposals were dismissed.\n\nHe suggested splitting costs based on income, such as a 60-40 arrangement or covering flights while she handled her spending money.

    "description": "My guide dog helps me travel the world as a fully blind person. I don't take it for granted, but the hardest part is dealing with people's ignorance.",
    "fullText": "My life changed when I met Indio, a black Labrador, three years ago.\n\nI am completely blind, and until I got my guide dog, I wasn't able to travel often. Getting around was tiring enough in familiar places.\n\nI used a cane, and encountered tons of obstacles and problems — like crossing paths with people who were looking at their phones. The idea of navigating this in a completely new country sounded like a horror-movie plot.\n\nNow, my dog and I have been to 16 countries together — he's been an important constant in my life as I've eaten crickets in Mexico and visited museums in Germany.\n\nI wouldn't change our journey for anything, but it hasn't always been easy — mainly because of the judgment we face from others.\n\nWhen I travel with Indio, there are so many things I just don't have to think about.\n\nHe'll learn my hotel room as soon as we set foot inside, and help direct me to places we already know if I get lost after a day of exploring. I no longer have to depend on fellow travelers when I'm on a city tour, because my dog can follow a guide independently if I ask him to.\n\nCrucially, I feel like I can now walk around an unfamiliar city without having to worry nonstop. I can simply enjoy the feeling of being in a new place, listening to people speaking different languages around me, knowing that Indio is by my side to keep me safe.\n\nHaving this security has helped me go on adventures I'd never expected. Without thinking twice, I took a four-hour bus ride from Prague and woke up in Vienna with no plan except to explore.\n\nWithout Indio, this wouldn't be possible — and the ability to travel freely is not something I take for granted. Sometimes, though, having him with me brings problems that I wish I could avoid.\n\nWhen I decided to get a guide dog, the first thing many people told me was that I had to give up my dreams of traveling, especially abroad.\n\nSome dogs struggle with changes in environments, and most countries also require multiple types of documentation for traveling with service animals. Plus, I often have to fill out lots of extra airline forms whenever I fly with him.\n\nIn many cases, I also prepare myself for how people — especially those who haven't encountered a guide dog in public — might react when they see us exploring the streets of their city.\n\nSadly, my worries aren't unfounded. Once, I had to miss a museum tour because I struggled to find a taxi driver who would allow my dog in the car. Other times, I've been stopped from entering supermarkets.\n\nPractically everywhere we go, we have to deal with people who don't know how to act around a guide dog — whether they try to pet him at times when it's dangerous for him to get distracted, or they react with fear or surprise at his presence.\n\nDespite the issues we've faced, being able to travel with Indio is one of the most rewarding things I've ever done in my life.\n\nEven when there are snags or setbacks, there are kind, positive moments that restore my faith and joy in traveling, too. I've encountered strangers who were willing to help support Indio and me, even though there was no incentive beyond kindness to do so.\n\nAt the end of the day, I just wish certain people we've encountered would recognize that, for me, traveling with Indio isn't a choice. He gives me freedom and a gateway to a world I never thought I would know.\n\nNo matter what, I'll continue traveling and occupying space — because, despite my limitations, I believe that the world is too big to wait for someone to tell me about it at home.",

    "fullText": "A French report claims that Lazio are one of four clubs interested in FC Metz winger Giorgi Tsitaishvili, who will become a free agent in the summer.\n\nThe Georgian international is a youth product of Dynamo Kyiv, who remains on the Ukrainian club’s books. However, the 25-year-old spent the last six seasons on loan. This includes temporary experiences in Poland with Wisla Kraków and Lech Poznan. He also played in Spain with Granada last season, before joining FC Metz in the summer.\n\nInterestingly, Tsitaishvili’s contract with Dynamo Kyiv will expire in June, so he will be free to sign for a new club following his Ligue 1 experience. The winger has thus far contributed with two goals and one assist in 17 appearances across all competitions.\n\nAccording to Foot Mercato, Tsitaishvili’s situation has attracted at least four suitors, including Lazio, who have already enquired about his availability. Moreover, Olympique Lyonnais and LOSC Lille will be looking to keep him in France, while his international teammate Georges Mikautadze is trying to convince him to join Villarreal, having already played an integral role in his transfer to Metz.\n\nWith Lazio operating on limited resources, a free agent like Tsitaishvili could represent an enticing prospect for Claudio Lotito and Angelo Fabiani. However, the Biancocelesti already have two left-footed wingers vying for a spot on the right flank. So, unless either Gustav Isaksen or Matteo Cancellieri ends up leaving the club, the management will likely focus on bolstering other playing roles next summer.",

    "description": "Top AI researchers like Fei-Fei Li and Yann LeCun are developing world models, which don't rely solely on language.",
    "fullText": "As OpenAI, Anthropic, and Big Tech invest billions in developing state-of-the-art large language models, a small group of elite AI researchers is working on what they say is the next big thing.\n\nComputer scientists like Fei-Fei Li, the Stanford professor famous for inventing ImageNet, and Yann LeCun, Meta's outgoing chief AI scientist, are building what they call \"world models.\"\n\nUnlike large language models, which determine outputs based on statistical relationships between words and phrases, world models anticipate outcomes by mimicking the mental constructs that humans make of the world around them.\n\n\"Humans,\" Li said on an episode of Andreessen Horowitz's A16z podcast in June, \"not only do we survive, live, and work, but we build civilization beyond language.\"\n\nPut simply, world models are AI systems that anticipate what will happen next, much like humans use intuition based on their experience to predict the consequences of their actions. Think of a child who, with no language skills, will learn to understand that if they push a toy car, it will roll.\n\nComputer scientist and MIT professor, Jay Wright Forrester, in his 1971 paper \"Counterintuitive Behavior of Social Systems,\" explained why mental models are crucial to human behavior:\n\nIf AI is to meet or surpass human intelligence, then the researchers behind it believe it should be able to make mental models, too.\n\nLi has been working on this through World Labs, which she cofounded in 2024 with an initial backing of $230 million from venture firms like Andreessen Horowitz, New Enterprise Associates, and Radical Ventures. \"We aim to lift AI models from the 2D plane of pixels to full 3D worlds — both virtual and real — endowing them with spatial intelligence as rich as our own,\" World Labs says on its website.\n\nLi said on the \"No Priors\" podcast in June that spatial intelligence is \"the ability to understand, reason, interact, and generate 3D worlds,\" given that the world is fundamentally three-dimensional.\n\nLi said she sees applications for world models in creative fields, robotics, or any area that warrants infinite universes.\n\nThe challenge of building world models is the paucity of sufficient data. In contrast to language, which humans have refined and documented over centuries, spatial intelligence is less developed.\n\n\"If I ask you to close your eyes right now and draw out or build a 3D model of the environment around you, it's not that easy,\" she said on the \"No Priors\" podcast. \"We don't have that much capability to generate extremely complicated models till we get trained.\"\n\nTo gather the data necessary for these models, \"we require more and more sophisticated data engineering, data acquisition, data processing, and data synthesis,\" she said.\n\nThat makes the challenge of building a believable world even greater.\n\nLeCun, who is leaving his post as the chief AI scientist at Meta at the end of the year to launch his own startup called Advanced Machine Intelligence, has long been fixated on world models, which he says are more competent than large language models because they have common sense, the capacity to reason and plan, and persistent memory.\n\nIn a November LinkedIn post announcing his new venture, LeCun said the company's goal is to \"bring about the next big revolution in AI: systems that understand the physical world, have persistent memory, can reason, and can plan complex action sequences.\"\n\nOn December 19, LeCun said on LinkedIn that he was recruiting Alex LeBrun, the cofounder and CEO of Nabla, an AI assistant for clinicians, as CEO of AMI Labs.\n\nIn a Nabla press release announcing the transition, LeBrun said, \"Healthcare AI is entering a new era, one where reliability, determinism, and simulation matter as much as linguistic intelligence.\"\n\n\"This partnership builds on that shared vision and gives Nabla privileged access to world model technology that will complement today's LLMs and help unlock the safe, autonomous systems clinicians need,\" he added.\n\nPrior to the launch of AMI Labs, LeCun and a small team of researchers were working on a similar project at Meta, using video data to train models and run simulations that abstract the videos at different levels.\n\n\"The basic idea is that you don't predict at the pixel level. You train a system to run an abstract representation of the video so that you can make predictions in that abstract representation, and hopefully this representation will eliminate all the details that cannot be predicted,\" he said at the AI Action Summit in Paris earlier this year.\n\n\"We're thinking about world models and visual multimodal intelligence. We want to move beyond purely visual systems into something broader — models that understand not just what they see, but how the world works,\" Moonvalley's chief scientific officer, Mateusz Malinowski, told Business Insider.\n\nApplications for world models include humanoid robotics and real-world planning, he said. The company says it is already training robots on its world models.\n\nIn a follow-up email, Malinowski explained the differences between these newer world models and existing vision models, which are used for tasks from facial recognition to object tracking.\n\n\"I'd start with saying that vision model is a very broad term,\" Malinowski wrote. \"If we're referring to text-to-video generation models, from my vantage point, these models can be seen as the first steps for world models. World models emphasize world simulation, adherence to physical reality, long-term consistency of the environment, and action-conditioned generation.\"\n\nThat said, Malinowski notes key differences between the world models being built by Moonvalley and those under development at World Labs.\n\n\"I believe that long-term goals are the same, but we are approaching the problem of world modelling differently,\" he wrote. \"We focus on using video models as first-class citizens, where spatial intelligence is more implicit. In the short term, our approach seems more suited for filmmaking and robotics due to motion and soft bodies modelling.\"",

    "description": "There’s never been just one way to buy software. In ye olden times, if you liked some shareware, you’d mail off a cheque, or call up a hot-line, to get the full version. Later on, you could walk into a store and walk out with a shiny box, manuals, and disks.",
    "fullText": "There’s never been just one way to buy software. In ye olden times, if you liked some shareware, you’d mail off a cheque, or call up a hot-line, to get the full version. Later on, you could walk into a store and walk out with a shiny box, manuals, and disks.\n\nThese were some expensive boxes:\n\nNo one technically had to upgrade, but in a year or so, everybody did, because we wanted those sweet quality-of-life improvements, nicer design, and exciting new features. But eventually every product being continually developed will become good enough for its target market.\n\nWhen that happens, companies (especially the VC-backed kind) now need to contrive new and increasingly stick-like reasons for customers to pay again. From made-for-marketing ‘features’ that suck to use IRL, to breaking compatibility with older versions, to spamming you with marketing notifications and embedded ads. Their relationship with customers goes from symbiotic to parasitic.\n\nOn the other hand, the pursuit of completeness should be an ideal fit for subscription software because, theoretically, steady monthly payments from long-time customers incentivizes stability, polish, and helpful improvements.\n\nSubscriptions are particularly helpful for businesses:\n\nEspecially for solo creators, just knowing that you have ~$3000/mo coming in every month is way less anxiety-inducing than making $6,000 in a good month – but knowing that next month you could just as likely make $1000, or maybe even $0. It’s like being a farmer, surviving at the mercy of good weather.\n\nThere’s also a third reason: Tier or usage-based pricing prevents customers costing more money than they contribute. But unless you’re burning unlimited money generating LLM tokens, the risk of losing money on a web app customer is either basically zero, or very easy to predict otherwise (even over the long-term).\n\nOn paper, subscriptions could be a win-win. But some people, including many readers of this blog, have good reasons to be wary of them.\n\nKinopio subscriptions can be easily cancelled, pricing is grandfathered, receipts are emailed, accidental renewals can be refunded, and there are no cancellation fees or deceptive dark patterns. Many indie subscription apps also offer subscriptions in good faith.\n\nBut a business model that’s regularly exploited by well-known corporations, like the New York Times and Adobe, poisons the well for everyone else. Every time someone gets tricked into signing up for a non-refundable yearly subscription instead of a monthly one, or has to call to cancel a subscription they created online, those bad feelings become associated with all subscriptions.\n\nIt’s hard to have good long-lasting relationships with customers if they’re expecting the worst.\n\nThat being said, I still think subscriptions make sense to offer.\n\nFor most people, subscriptions are as normal as the old boxed software model used to be. And the much lower-cost to entry can be very helpful – especially in competitive markets where customers have a lot of options.\n\nThe onus is on companies selling subscriptions to earn trust by being transparent about who they are, what they believe, and how they’re funded (i.e. what their long-term incentives are). A public roadmap and changelog also go a long-way towards proving they practice what they preach.\n\nEven to non-technical people, paying for subscriptions makes intuitive sense when the product requires a server for helpful things like file uploads, public URLs, and real-time collaboration. But the per-user-cost of running a production CRUD server is basically zero. Counter-intuitively, what you’re really paying for is the considerable effort and expertise that it takes to keep full-featured software running reliably and continuously-improving.\n\nThat’s part of the reason why I increased prices over the years as the app grew in capability and complexity.\n\nFor context, here’s Kinopio’s pricing history:\n\nWhen I introduced paid upgrades to Kinopio in 2020, I did it as a monthly subscription because that seemed like the safe, default model for an app that needed a server.\n\nIn all my previous jobs, there was always a dedicated back-end or sysadmin team that abstracted the server hosting details from the rest of the company. They used complicated sounding terms like load balancing, replica shards, containers, observability, were woken up by pagerDuty, and were eternally worried about scaling.\n\nBut when I dived into that world, I learned that most of the jargon really didn’t matter. The kinopio-server is a simple node.js app with a pretty straightforward MVC architecture. My insecurity about keeping servers up is a big reason behind why the app works offline, or if the server is down. What developers would call local-first today.\n\nIn 2019, I wrote about my early Plans for Kinopio. Where I mentioned that,\n\n“Kinopio consists of two codebases, the client-app that runs when in the browser and the server-app which enables sharing and collaboration. The client is like a cockroach, its tiny, basically free to host, and doesn’t depend on a connection to the server. So if I can’t afford to run the Kinopio server anymore, I can just switch it off and you can continue to use Kinopio as you do now – with all your data intact.”\n\nTwo years later, I introduced the lifetime plan mainly because people kept asking me for a subscription alternative. I’m sure many of them would have still have paid for a subscription, but how long would a rueful customer stay? Would they always be looking for alternatives? Would they still enthusiastically share spaces and recommend the app to their friends and teams?\n\nMy business ‘strategy’ is that a happy customer is better than an unhappy one, and that I’d rather have some money from a user than none. (Relatedly, that’s also why Kinopio offers student/financial needs discounts).\n\nThe lifetime plan is priced at ~3× the yearly price because that was the average churn length at the time. But I think that in general, 3-4 years is a good starting point if you get a nice sounding number that is high enough so that only <10% of new customers choose it, while stilling feeling anchored to the subscription prices.\n\nSoftware designers and engineers regularly build products with original ideas, and choose to make their own jobs harder by increasing code complexity, so that their users can have an inviting, easier-to-use, and lower-friction, time using it.\n\nBut on the financial-side, web-based software companies tend to be really conservative with their business models and choose subscription-only models by default. It’s never even questioned, but I think it should be. Just like with dev work, pricing models can also take on behind-the-scenes complexity to give users a better experience.\n\nLow-variability/high-tail income (subscription MRR) is easiest to plan for, but high-variability/short-tail income (lifetime purchases) is peaky and harder to plan for – but they can work together. If you position and price it right, the ideal customers for lifetime pricing will be very different than the ideal subscription customers.\n\nIt may sound counter-intuitive to give your most passionate users a pathway to never have to pay you again, but especially early on, evangelism is worth more than money. There are plenty of fish in the sea: people who have yet to find, or be recommended, Kinopio and become future customers.",

    "fullText": "Norway is becoming a global leader in the electric vehicle (EV) industry, achieving a remarkable growth in sales of these vehicles. EV sales in the country have increased from just 1% of total sales in 2010 to 88.9% of vehicles sold in 2024. In the first weeks of 2025, this figure has reached 96%, an impressive achievement for a country that has set a clear goal: to become the first in the world to use only electric vehicles.\n\nSwitching to electric vehicles is one of the biggest changes we can make to improve the health of our planet and combat climate change. Electric vehicles are cleaner, with low or no greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to the reduction of air pollution and carbon emissions, which are one of the main causes of global warming.\n\nIn Norway, this transition is happening not through punitive measures against internal combustion engine vehicles, but through active support and strong incentives for electric vehicle users. Government policies have included VAT exemptions, lower parking and road taxes, and privileged access to bus lanes. This has led a large number of Norwegians to choose electric vehicles as their first option.\n\nIn addition to financial incentives, the Norwegian government has been investing heavily in charging infrastructure. Many homes and businesses in Norway can now charge their electric vehicles under convenient conditions, removing one of the main barriers to mass adoption of EVs. This has made electric vehicles easier to use and have a longer lifespan for users, contributing to increased sales and adoption.\n\nAnother factor that has helped Norway achieve this is the country's wealth and energy resources. Norway is a major exporter of oil and gas, but it is using these revenues to finance the costs of subsidies and investments in the clean energy sector. Cheap energy from renewable sources such as hydropower and wind power is enabling Norwegians to drive electric vehicles without paying much for energy.\n\nRico Luman, an economist and auto industry expert, has called Norway a “global pioneer” in this area. He says Norway has created a successful model that can help many other countries address the challenges of pollution and climate change by using electric vehicles as part of a broader strategy for sustainable transportation.\n\nIn conclusion, Norway is a shining example for the world. With a phenomenal growth in electric vehicle sales and an advanced supporting infrastructure, this country has made great strides towards a clean and sustainable future. And while many other countries are still far from reaching such a level, Norway has shown that with the right policies and a commitment to change, a cleaner, greener world can be created for future generations.",

The family had planned a vacation to Serbia to visit family and friends, the lawsuit stated.\n\nIn a statement to Business Insider, Delta said that \"the allegations at issue relate to flights not operated by Delta Air Lines.\" The airline added that it will \"review the complaint and respond accordingly in due course.\"\n\nThe filing states the flights were round-trip and business class, purchased through Delta's SkyMiles program, and operated by KLM. The four tickets were worth $8,800 at the time, according to the suit.\n\nRoughly two hours into the flight to Amsterdam, one of the plaintiffs started to feel like she was being bitten by bugs crawling on her, according to the filing. She then realized that bugs were \"crawling on her light-colored sweater,\" the filing stated.\n\nThe lawsuit claims the couple \"immediately\" notified the flight staff and were told to keep their voices down to avoid causing \"panic\" on the plane. The couple took photos and videos of the bugs crawling on the sweater and in the creases of their seats, which were included in the lawsuit.\n\nPrior to landing, the flight attendants urged the couple again not to tell anyone about the infestation because they would miss their connecting flight to Serbia if they did, the filing stated.\n\nA little over a week after the incident, the couple took their children to doctors in Roanoke, Virginia, where it was confirmed that the bites were caused by bed bugs, the lawsuit said. The family was recommended to employ \"bug bombs\" in their home and car, and wash their clothing in hot water, the filing said.\n\nWhile bed bugs are an unusual complaint, this isn't the first time passengers have turned to the courts after a bad flight experience. In September, 16 passengers sued American Airlines after their flight caught fire. Last year, a passenger sued Delta for $1 million, alleging a faulty armrest broke his rib.\n\nKLM did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.",

    "fullText": "LONDON (AP) — On a Christmas Day when the war in Ukraine casts a shadow over Europe, concerns over immigration divide societies, and some politicians fan anger and resentment, Britain’s King Charles III called on people to focus on kindness instead of conflict.\n\nDelivering his annual holiday address from Westminster Abbey, Charles said Thursday the Christmas story of wise men and shepherds traveling through the night to find their savior shows how we can find strength in the “companionship and kindness of others.”\n\n“To this day, in times of uncertainty, these ways of living are treasured by all the great faiths and provide us with deep wells of hope, of resilience in the face of adversity,” Charles said. “Peace through forgiveness, simply getting to know our neighbors and by showing respect to one another, creating new friendships.”\n\n“In this, with the great diversity of our communities, we can find the strength to ensure that right triumphs over wrong,” he added.\n\nThe speech, which concluded with a Christmas carol sung by a Ukrainian choir, comes as European leaders rally support for Ukraine amid signs that U.S. President Donald Trump is losing patience with America’s traditional European allies. At home, British politics have become increasingly bitter as Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s government struggles to control unauthorized migration and bolster creaking public services.\n\nCharles, the titular head of the Church of England, chose Westminster Abbey as the site of his Christmas Day broadcast to underscore the theme of pilgrimage that ran through the speech. The abbey, known as the site of coronations and royal weddings, is also the focus of an annual pilgrimage honoring Edward the Confessor, an early king of England who was canonized as a saint in 1161.\n\n“Pilgrimage is a word less used today, but it is of particular significance for our modern world, and especially at Christmas,’’ he said. “This is about journeying forward into the future, while also journeying back to remember the past and learn from its lessons.”\n\nCharles and his family made their own pilgrimage on foot earlier in the day to St. Mary Magdalene Church on the king’s private Sandringham Estate, about 100 miles north of London.\n\nCharles and Queen Camilla, along with Prince William and his wife, Kate, and their children, Princes George and Louis and Princess Charlotte, and extended family walked to the church and greeted the crowds of people after the service.\n\nEvents earlier this year marking the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II underscored the need to learn from the past, Charles said. While there are fewer and fewer living veterans of that conflict, we must remember the courage and sacrifice of those who fought the war and the way communities came together “in the face of such great challenge,” he said.\n\n“These are the values which have shaped our country and the Commonwealth,” he said. “As we hear of division, both at home and abroad, they are the values of which we must never lose sight.’’\n\nThe monarch’s annual holiday message is watched by millions of people in the U.K. and across the Commonwealth, a voluntary association of 56 independent nations, most of which have historic ties to Britain. The pre-recorded speech is broadcast at 3 p.m. London time, when many families are enjoying their traditional Christmas lunch.\n\nThe speech is one of the rare occasions when Charles, 77, is able to voice his own views and doesn’t seek guidance from the government.\n\nThis year’s address comes just two weeks after Charles made a deeply personal television appearance in which he said “good news” from his doctors meant that he would be able to reduce his treatment for cancer in the new year.\n\nThe king was diagnosed with a still undisclosed form of cancer in early 2024. Buckingham Palace says his treatment is now moving to a “precautionary phase” and his condition will be monitored to ensure his continued recovery.\n\nThe speech was accompanied by a video of members of the royal family, from the king to his grandchildren, George and Louis and Charlotte, meeting with the public and carrying out their royal duties.\n\nThat included scenes from the king’s historic trip to the Vatican as he works to forge closer relations between the Church of England and the Catholic Church.\n\nThe event was the first time since King Henry VIII severed ties with Rome that the leaders of the two Christian churches, divided for centuries over issues that now include the ordination of female priests in the Church of England, have prayed together.\n\nThe king’s message was clear. Even if some years had passed, there’s always hope to start over. Peace is possible.",

    "fullText": "Northwestern assistant head coach Harlon Barnett has a long list of nicknames ready to use whenever he addresses or talks about safety Robert Fitzgerald.\n\nThe Terminator. The World’s Greatest Tackler. The Face of the Big Ten. The Eraser. The General. The Example. Mr. Consistent.\n\n“He’s going to start forgetting his own name,” Barnett said.\n\nFitzgerald has given Barnett a lot of reason to talk about him in a breakout season that continues at noon Friday in Northwestern’s game against Central Michigan in the GameAbove Sports Bowl on ESPN.\n\nThe redshirt junior goes into the game at Detroit’s Ford Field as the Big Ten leader with 68 solo tackles for a Wildcats defense that fueled their 6-6 regular season. He ranked fourth in the conference with 109 tackles and also had 6½ tackles for a loss, three passes defended, an interception and a fumble recovery.\n\n“He’s maximizing his gifts, talents and abilities that the Lord has given him,” Barnett said. “And he takes no days off.”\n\nFitzgerald’s season, for which he was named second-team All-Big Ten by coaches, comes after three years of working his way into bigger roles with Northwestern. He began with the Wildcats scout team and then played primarily on special teams in his first two seasons before earning more time on defense last year.\n\nThroughout the climb, he focused on the process, determined that when the Wildcats needed him, he would be prepared.\n\n“You’ve got to put the work in, day in, day out, no matter how long it takes,” Fitzgerald said. “But eventually your opportunity is going to come. And when that opportunity came, I knew that I was going to be ready based on all the work that I’ve been putting in for the past three years, on and off the field, in the weight room, in the training room, getting my body right, learning the playbook, studying film.”\n\nFitzgerald’s approach — and his understanding of the value of each day — was developed in part before his time at Northwestern. During his senior year of high school in Dallas, he watched his father, Matthew, fight ALS, and his memories of his dad have shaped how he lives now.\n\nThe Fitzgerald family would have Italian beef and Lou Malnati’s shipped to Dallas for Chicago Bears-Green Bay Packers games. Fitzgerald and his sister, Olivia, were Packers fans because of their mom, Amy, who is from Wisconsin. Matt, who grew up in the Wildwood/Edgebrook area of Chicago, cheered for the Bears.\n\n“He always said that my mom brainwashed me and my sister to be Packers fans,” Fitzgerald said.\n\nFitzgerald said his father was passionate about the work he did as a marketing executive. Midway through his career, he met Mark Cuban at the gym, became friends with him and became the Mavericks senior vice president for marketing and communications, a job that allowed Fitzgerald to be a Mavs ball boy and meet Dirk Nowitzki as a kid.\n\nMatt could light up a room and was passionate about his family and friends, a trait Fitzgerald carries with him to his relationships.\n\nAnd the former Loyola Academy safety loved football, a passion he passed on to his son. Fitzgerald remembers spending countless hours on the couch watching NFL Sunday Ticket with his dad. They would play in the backyard, reenacting Super Bowl-winning drives, making sideline grabs or playing goal-line tackle, the latter game one his mother didn’t love.\n\nFitzgerald said his dad was the biggest influence on his football career, giving him everything he needed to be successful. And he kept cheering on his son even after he was diagnosed with ALS the summer before Fitzgerald’s senior year at Jesuit College Prep. Fitzgerald, an All-State safety and running back that season, would look up into the stands to see his dad.\n\n“I’d be like, ‘Whatever I’m going through — I’m tired out here; I’m exhausted — whatever I’m going through is minuscule compared to what he’s going through,’” Fitzgerald said. “So that kind of drove me in high school my senior year, and I’ve kind of been able to use that as fuel going forward.”\n\nFitzgerald, who is no relation to former Wildcats coach Pat Fitzgerald, chose Northwestern in part because of his father’s connection to the Chicago area. His grandmother still lived at the time in the same home Matt grew up in. Fitzgerald’s aunt lives in Naperville. His dad’s friends are around and come to games.\n\nIllinois and Northwestern are headed to bowl games: Here’s what to know\n\nBut Matt didn’t get to see him play for the Wildcats. Matt died on July 22, 2022, just as Fitzgerald was beginning fall camp with Northwestern.\n\n“The whole thing changed my perspective on life for sure,” Fitzgerald said. “I don’t take a single day for granted anymore. Just watching the way he handled it and the way he attacked it just really was amazing to see. And it was amazing to see how strong my mom was throughout the entire disease. And it was also amazing how many people showed up for my family. The community really showed up for us.”\n\nWhen Fitzgerald thinks about how he got through that time in his life — getting acclimated at a new school in the midst of losing his father — he said his family helped, especially his mom, who was “the rock throughout the whole thing.”\n\nAnd his Northwestern teammates and coaches helped too. It wasn’t just letting him know they were sorry or there for him. Sometimes it was just acting normally, because he needed that too.\n\n“My teammates just really rallied around me, and they kind of became like 110 brothers that I never had,” he said.\n\nFitzgerald’s freshman season wasn’t easy on the field either as he realized he would be playing behind guys with several years of experience.\n\nHe played scout team for a 1-11 squad before getting a few reps on special teams at the end of the year, which became a redshirt season. But he believed that if he kept working, he could increase his opportunities.\n\nIn his second season, he started on three special teams units and played in a third-down subpackage. By his third year, he made the defensive rotation and started some at nickel for the Wildcats.\n\nBarnett, who joined Braun’s staff before the 2024 season, saw a player who was intentional and diligent with his work. He told Fitzgerald at the end of that season that he probably should have played more at safety, and he saw that message take hold to build Fitzgerald’s confidence in the offseason.\n\n“I saw toughness,” Barnett said. “I saw a willingness to get better. I saw a guy that takes coaching. He’s one of those guys who’s going to do exactly what you tell him. He’s going to take it to heart, he’s going to listen to you and he’s going to apply it. And that’s what you like to see as a coach.”\n\nBarnett, who played defensive back at Michigan State and in the NFL, always tells his players that they need to believe that they are the best player on the field.\n\nRecapping an eventful 2025 for Chicago sports on — and off — the field\n\nFitzgerald said he knew he was meant to be in the starting-safety role after the opener against Tulane, when he had 13 tackles. But his confidence was really in place by the fourth game of the season against UCLA, a 17-14 Northwestern win in which Fitzgerald had nine tackles, including a tackle for a loss. He wouldn’t freak out if he missed a tackle. He told himself he was the best player on the field.\n\n“Then he started playing like that — ‘I’m the baddest dude out here. I’m the baddest guy on the field,’” Barnett said.\n\nFitzgerald had numerous big plays in Northwestern’s near-upset of Michigan at Wrigley Field on Nov. 15. He had a career-high 15 tackles, including a tackle for a loss, and picked off quarterback Bryce Underwood in the fourth quarter, but Barnett got excited about a hit on a Wolverines running back late in the fourth.\n\n“He came in and smacked one of the running backs,” Barnett said. “I am vicariously playing through the players. And so, oh, man, I was so fired up. … And I don’t like Michigan, so that also adds to it.”\n\nRecapping an eventful 2025 for Chicago sports on — and off — the field\n\nChicago basketball report: WNBA players authorize a strike — and ‘Ain’t no Christmas’ for Notre Dame men\n\nKeaton Wagler powers No. 20 Illinois past Missouri 91-48 for the biggest blowout in Braggin’ Rights rivalry\n\nNotre Dame — with 96-game rivalry series vs. USC now on pause — announces home-and-home with BYU\n\nHannah Hildago posts triple-double in No. 20 Notre Dame women’s 110-38 win over Bellarmine\n\nFitzgerald will have one more chance this season to show up Friday against Central Michigan. He said the Wildcats want to finish with a winning record, send their seniors out on a high note and build some momentum heading into next season.\n\nBarnett said in the offseason Fitzgerald will continue to work on his speed and change of direction, on honing his already solid ball skills and tackling and improving his “vision and break” to where the quarterback is sending the ball.\n\nHe expects him to continue to develop his leadership too. Fitzgerald delivered a speech to the team before the Tulane game to rally his teammates and said he is working on being a more vocal leader, which comes naturally after he feels like he has earned it.\n\nThat merit has come this season. Earlier this year, Northwestern coach David Braun said Fitzgerald should be proud of the demeanor and the consistency with which he has played, adding “there’s no one in this program that reflects our values more than that young man.”\n\nFitzgerald has thought about how his dad would view this breakout season, and he knows he would revel in it.\n\n“He would eat this season up,” Fitzgerald said. “He would love to see me. I know he’s watching, but he would love to be in those stands and see me out there, just like I was playing in high school.”",

    "title": "2025-26 World Junior Championships PRIMER: Everything you need to know!",
    "description": "It’s the premiere teenager tournament, this time located in Minnesota!",
    "fullText": "What is it?: Teenager hockey at the highest level being played in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada!\n\nWhen is it?: The games start December 26th, and the medal round begins just after New Year’s Day on the 2nd.\n\nWhere can I watch it?: TSN in Canada, NHLN in the states, apparently TUBI will also have it if you stream your hockey.\n\nWho’s the defending champs?: The United States, who is going for a threepeat this year!\n\nWhy should I care?: Why, you get to see the NHL stars of tomorrow face off for World Juniors glory! Gavin McKenna gets to wow you before he even gets the chance to play for an NHL team! Also it’s pretty inoffensive hockey that people get super wound up over while you’re puttering around the house during the holidays, so there aught to be some good yucks at certain fanbases (read: Canada’s) expense. Also, the relegation round is always a fun treat for those who want to see imperfect, desperate hockey, a personal favorite of mine.\n\nTeam USA: James Hagens, Will Zellers\n\nOne must imagine Sweden happy, because once again they should be set up to be a powerhouse…and it might shock you to learn that nobody is concerned because they have to get past the US and then will have to beat Canada or Finland in order to get the Gold Medal they so desperately crave. There’s just no winning for them unless they win it all, and that will be tough. In the round robin they usually do pretty well, and their roster this year is once again damn good; Sascha Boumedienne, Loke Krantz, Ivar Stenburg, Anton Frondell, with decent netminders in Goos and Härenstam suggests they will be just as good as they usually are. Problem is, we know that. We know they will likely cruise to another Group top or close to it. Then they have to play in the elimination round. Tre Kronor’s biggest issue remains that elimination round play, and who knows if this version of Sweden can survive it. I’m pretty sure they can…they just have to, you know…do it.\n\nSlovakia remains interested in proving they are A) Not Mad about Juraj Slafkovsky’s comments that suggest the federation is indolent, and B) You can ignore their considerable interest in buddying up to the Russian Federation because they’re A-Okay, baby. Slovakia unfortunately does have some issues facing them coming into the tourney: their 2023 class has aged out entirely, and a vast majority of their team is so, so young. In some cases that may benefit them, as there’s less tape on these kids and the ones who they do have tape on are pretty good. For most however…well, they don’t have the same caliber of player they used to in a division where Sweden and the US are, and they usually had a good chance to beat the US up ‘till now. They’re going to have to hope Michal Pradel can hold the fort long enough for guys like Michal Capos, Jan Chovan, and Michal Svrcek can get these youngsters moving like they can. I don’t think they’re necessarily worse than the rest of their division, but I certainly wouldn’t put them any higher than 3rd unless Pradel starts doing 3rd eye goaltending.\n\nHere’s the thing: by all accounts, Germany should be in trouble. Their defense is kind of awkward and not especially noteworthy, and they’re banking on a WHL goalie to be their rock in net. That is a rock I think they could trust in spurts here or there, but maybe not all the way. Why I think they escape relegation this year is that Die Eismannschaft is more offensively gifted than Switzerland; especially up front. Max Penkin, Max Schafer, and David Lewandowski have all found great success this year in Canadian Junior/DEL play, and zee Germans might have something in brothers Timo and Fabio Kose, who play different positions but have shown great flashes of talent against grown-ass men in the DEL. Against players their own age? They may yet shine. Veillard, while I don’t necessarily trust an .890 SV% goalie, is a vet for this squad, and I imagine they will rally around him.\n\nIt breaks my heart to suggest Switzerland may end up on the relegation block this year, I have loved their fundamentals only, no funny business kind of hockey for years, but ultimately the level of talent at the WJC is improving, and so far the Swiss have failed to meet the moment. It stinks especially because they do have interesting talent! They have\n\nAfter Canada publicly embarrassed themselves last year and the year before, The True North appear to have taken a much more humble approach to the World Juniors of casually bringing everyone who is good and available to the World Juniors. Even better, the omissions this year were largely because the Pacific teams that they were signed to still want them to be on the roster, and thus can’t justify assigning them. Even better than that, Group B is about as easy a division as you could ask for if Canada really is as built up as they say they are…which is what I would say, had Gavin McKenna not made it clear that he’s prone to error as much as anyone else, and Sweden doesn’t even have to play Canada until a hypothetical medal round. In general, a lot rides on Canada right now. They’ve been slipping badly over the past few tourneys and have turned “underdog gets first win over Canada” into an almost yearly spectacle. Regardless of how you feel about their place in the sport, Canada in the tourneys that count does not have the luxury of expecting to be good anymore. In short, they need to run away with this one and quickly, or we are once again going to start a dialogue about the decision-making corps for the Red and White (and sometimes black).\n\nFinland’s effort in the early parts of this tournament have always been a bit slow; especially with their proclivity for penalties, so don’t be surprised if they look like they’re in trouble to start out. What they are however, is in a very weird place. They’re without Konsta Helenius; their current premiere prospect of World Juniors age, and as such are going to need to adjust to life without him. They’re not screwed by a long shot, but now they need to focus down on other talents to help them out. In net, as per usual, they will have a murderer’s row of good goalies to choose from; Kim Saarinen and Petteri Rimpinen will once again be their rock in net, allowing talents like Julius Miettinen, Emil Hemming, Matias Vanhanen, and Max Westergard to do what they usually do best; cause a ruckus on the boards, rip off a solid pass, and score goals. Losing Helenius however means they lose a level of dynamism that would have otherwise given them an edge against the Group leader once we get to that point on the calendar. Still, the Finns always find a way to drag teams down to their level, so while Canada might get the edge on them to start, they always find a way to crawl back in and make you regret it. Also, Rimpinen has the coolest pads in this tournament. Bar none.\n\nCzechia has traditionally been an offense or bust kind of team; one that’s free-wheeling and fun if a little chaotic. That chaos allowed them to be Bronze Medalists at last year’s tourney. Is that gonna change? Maybe! Granted, they still have plenty of impressive and fun forwards they can call on to make their brand of frantic and fun hockey work, but now they’ll have an extra hand from the backend; they’ve decided to bring Radim Mrtka, Jakub Fibigr, Vashek Blanar, and Adam Jiricek to the dance, and from the skaters alone it seems like Czechia plans to survive this tourney through blistering offense.\n\nLatvia has the benefit of their upset win over Canada to allow them to survive through this tournament. That’s probably what’s going to get them through this tournament entirely because otherwise Latvia has lost a lot of the talent that made them so special last year. They will have to rely on the work of players who’ve spent a lot of time abroad: Roberts Naudins has been tearing it up for Shattuck St. Marys Prep, Daniels Serkins has been doing great for SC Bern in Switzerland, and of course; the Latvians have their wunderkind; Alberts Smits, who is projected to be a first round pick this year. They do have a team attitude and game plan that usually makes them a lot tougher to play than you might expect, but they also tend to need their goalies to be lights out. Of the three they brought; Nils Roberts Maurins would likely have to play way above his paygrade to keep them in games. Otherwise, their tournament will be as per usual; passionate fans, painful results.\n\nThere are going to be players on Denmark with more middle names than goals this year. Have fun playing Switzerland in the knockout round!\n\nIt looks like this! The games begin on December 26th, and the Elimination round begins on January 2nd.",

    "fullText": "The Pittsburgh Penguins will have two players participating in this year’s World Junior Championships, the U-20 tournament that takes place starting tomorrow, Friday December 26th and lasting through Monday January 5th over in Minnesota. What the Pens lack in quantity will be made up for in quantity with Canada’s Harrison Brunicke and the US’s Will Horcoff both expected to fill key roles for the two powerhouse teams.\n\nHorcoff finished the tune-up games on the first line for the Americans, playing left wing for high draft pick James Hagens. Center depth has been a question mark and potential question mark for the US, it shows where Horcoff is that he’s being used for the national team on the wing, just as where he normally plays for the University of Michigan these days.\n\nSteven Ellis from the Daily Faceoff listed Horcoff among his handful of top performers in that tune-up game against Finland:\n\n#24 Will Horcoff, LW (Pittsburgh Penguins): After scoring twice against Germany, Horcoff looked great again today with a good first-period goal. He does an excellent job of rushing to the net and using his big frame to bully opponents. He also has quick hands, something that very few players his size manage to replicate. Horcoff likely has played his way onto the top line with James Hagens and Brodie Ziemer for good.\n\nThe good news there is that description is perfectly in-line with what Horcoff has been doing all fall so far at Michigan, where he’s emerged as a goal-scoring machine and one of the top prospects in NCAA hockey this season. Horcoff could be on the verge of an even bigger coming out party on the international stage if he can prove himself against the best players in his 18-19 year old age bracket.\n\nThe US plays Germany on Friday at 6:00pm eastern (NHL Network) as they look to repeat on last year’s championship and add a fourth ‘chip within the last six years. The US follows that up with round robin games against Switzerland (Dec 27th), Slovakia (Dec 29th) and Sweden (Dec 31st) before the single-elimination quarterfinals start on January 2nd.\n\nHarrison Brunicke and the Canadians are over in the other group, they will play the Czechs on the 26th to open things up, followed by Latvia on the 27th, Denmark on the 29th and Finland on New Year’s Eve.\n\nEllis did a nice writeup on the experienced Brunicke heading into this tournament as well:\n\nIn total, Brunicke has played 26 pro games between the NHL and AHL over two years. For a player his age, that’s a lot of quality competition and increased speed he has had to deal with.\n\n“Coaches love that at this level,” one scout said. “They know they can count on the guys who’ve played against the best of the best. They’re coachable.”\n\nBrunicke has played a lot of meaningful hockey early in his career. He played in the Memorial Cup in 2023 prior to his draft year and then helped Canada win gold at the U-18 World Championship the following spring. Brunicke even skated in a pair of games with the senior national team ahead of the 2025 World Championship – showing a high level of trust from the Hockey Canada brass. That, plus his NHL experience, has allowed Brunicke to handle every challenge thrown his way so far.\n\n“When you’re in more high-pressure situations, you get more comfortable with it,” Brunicke said. “I’m hoping to bring that here.”\n\nMany believe Brunicke will be loaned back to Kamloops for the team’s WHL playoff push after the tournament. Others think the 6-foot-3 defender would benefit more from playing against men in the NHL. Regardless, he needs playing time – and he’s set to get a lot of it for Canada.\n\n“I’m still trying to build that pro style of game, where it’s strictly hard defense, where you’re moving the puck and moving your feet, less risks,” Brunicke said. “That’s what I’m trying to bring here.”\n\nParekh is projected to be Canada’s No. 1 right-handed defender. That’ll leave Brunicke on the second pair, where he’ll still be able to eat heavy minutes as he did in Kamloops. Canada has a strong contender this year, and Brunicke is expected to be a leader, especially with his NHL experience.\n\nBrunicke has played just five games over the past month, all coming in the AHL. The native of Johannesburg, South Africa had four points in that span, showing a high level of puck proficiency. On the surface, going from playing against men and adjusting to junior hockey sounds easy. But there’s a real adjustment, especially from a tempo perspective.\n\nBrunicke is ready for the challenge.\n\n“Whatever position I’m put in, whatever role, I’m ready to execute it,” Brunicke said. “I’m a two-way defenseman, playing hard defensively and getting to show my offense as well. I want to be a reliable defenseman who can eat minutes.”\n\nAfter a fall mostly spent watching or practicing, Brunicke should certainly get all the chances he can handle in this venue where he is one of the most experienced players. Team Canada looks stacked with talent, they’ll need a veteran like Brunicke to help guide them along.\n\nThe fun for the Pens will be what looks like the annual, inevitable collision between the US and the Canadians, which will just so happen to feature Pittsburgh having one of the top American forwards and Canadian defenders. That won’t happen until early in the new year with the group format, but one that would be very closely monitored in Western PA.",

    "fullText": "Peter Thiel has been described variously as ‘America’s leading public intellectual’, the ‘architect of Silicon Valley’s contemporary ethos’ or as an ‘incoherent and alarmingly super-nationalistic’ malevolent force. The PayPal and Palantir founder, a prominent early supporter of Donald Trump, is one of the world’s richest and most influential men. Throughout his career, his principal concern has always been the future, so when The Spectator asked to interview him, he wanted to talk to young people. To that effect, three young members of the editorial team were sent to Los Angeles to meet him. What follows is an edited transcript of their conversation.\n\nWILLIAM ATKINSON: Following Zohran Mamdani’s victory in New York, an email that you sent five years ago has gone viral. You argued that with accumulating student debt and housing costs, it was no surprise that young people were turning to socialism. How do you explain that there are Gen Zs, like us, who aren’t on the left?\n\n‘The Trump administration is trying to pull off an extremely difficult thing. America is no longer a great country’\n\nPETER THIEL: My sense is that in the US, Britain, Germany and France, the Gen Z voters are less centrist. I wouldn’t say they’re more drawn to the extremes, but they do not believe there are solutions within the Overton window straitjacket, the narrow space that’s been defined between New Labour and the Tories [in the UK] for the past three decades. And then there’s Reform, a party that repudiates that spectrum. For the first time in 200 years, there’s a real party to the right of the Tories. It’s not just a Gen Z phenomenon, but there’s a Gen Z part that is very important.\n\nWE: You first argued in the late 2000s that the backlash from globalisation would upend politics. Do you often feel that the world is catching up with Peter Thiel?\n\nPT: These things were coming for a long time. Student debt was $300 billion in 2000, around $2 trillion today. The GFC [global financial crisis] in 2008 was a big watershed. Entry-level jobs became less well paid. For students graduating after 2008, it became much, much harder to get out of the debt. Student debt slows you down from buying a house, getting started with forming a family, becoming an actual adult. You end up with a completely different society. It takes a long time to figure this out. But I started talking about this a lot in 2010… Why did house prices go up so much faster than incomes? Not enough was built. A big part was built as a retirement vehicle for older people. They were happy with the prices going up. The Tory party in the UK is probably completely past the point of no return. The suggestion that I have had was that you must start by throwing everybody out of the party who comes from real estate. You must be willing to purge all the people that are part of this dysfunctional system.\n\nJOHN POWER: What would your advice be to someone in their twenties about how they can have an impact in politics? Should they join Reform?\n\nPT: I think about politics a fair bit, but if I spent all my life on it, I would go out of my mind. I would like people to be more involved in right-wing politics, but I’m not sure that’s the best thing for most. You certainly should work for Reform rather than Labour or the Tories. You can criticise Nigel Farage as too much of a Boomer but he’s less structurally hateful to the young people. But maybe this is not the right way to frame the questions. We’re gonna have a revolution from Gen Z – all these crazy things that they are going to be doing. Is this good or bad? I’ve often said, in the early 20th century you think of both communism and fascism as youth movements that went very, very haywire. In the early 21st century, the reality is we have inverted demographic pyramids. There are not enough young people. We’re not going to get youthful communism or youthful fascism. We have this unbelievably oppressive, powerful gerontocracy. Maybe you can get communism or fascism of old people, but it’s very low-energy. It will avoid some of the defects of the early 20th century.But it’ll have many other kinds of problems. The general challenge for Gen Z is that there are big constraints.\n\nMy hope is that there always are some technological fixes, defining technology as doing more with less. If the debate is more with more spending or less with less spending, you end up with runaway deficits or extremely cruel rationing. I have critiques of the three biggest European countries – Germany, France and Britain. France is way too socialist. That doesn’t work. Germany is just insane. People have got caught up in crazed ideological fixations. There’s almost nothing like the Green party anywhere outside of Germany. Britain is neither too insane nor too socialist, but it’s extremely unpragmatic. It is extraordinary how lacking in common sense it is. The optimistic case for the UK is that there are extraordinary efficiencies one could wring out of the state. It has the greatest room for improvement of any European country. But why haven’t these things been done in the past 60 or 70 years?… Maybe the entire population is just too docile.\n\nLARA BROWN: You’ve talked before about Europe’s choice between ‘Greta on a bicycle’ environmentalism, Chinese surveillance and radical Islam. Would you say Europe has chosen one path?\n\nPT: The bad doors for Europe, the three doors of the future. For the future to have power as a cultural or political idea, you want it to be different. You can’t stay in this Groundhog Day, this Tory/Labour thing where we’re never doing anything new. The problem is the three actual pictures of the future. Behind door number one is Islamic sharia law. Behind door number two is the totalitarian CCP surveillance state, a hi-tech dystopia. Behind door number three is Greta with a bicycle, and then there’s no fourth door. This is why Greta’s been winning.\n\nJP: A lot of people on the American right talk incessantly about how terrible Britain and Europe are in general. But I think there’s selective blindness and chauvinism from some people on the American right about the condition of their own country. There is nowhere in Europe as bad as Skid Row in Los Angeles. What do you make of that?\n\nPT: I would defend the Trump version of the Republican party vs the zombie Reagan-Bush era. I don’t think President Trump or J.D. Vance are absurdly optimistic or panglossian about things. Make America Great Again was the most pessimistic slogan any president had in a century, and certainly that any Republican president ever had. The Trump administration is trying to pull off an extremely difficult thing, because the red pill is that America is no longer a great country. But you have to make sure it doesn’t become a gateway drug to a black pill, where you become nihilistic and give up and you’re destined to eat too many doughnuts in a trailer park. I don’t think that the right are overly optimistic in America. I don’t think there’s a problem where people describe things as even worse in other places. People in the US don’t pay attention to the world at all. We are a semi-autistic country. Maybe not quite as autistic as China, but we do not think about anything going on outside this country that much.\n\nLB: You mentioned the UK has undergone 70 years of stagnation. Many on the British right would agree, but may think that the period from 1979 to 1990 under Margaret Thatcher offered a respite from decline – she pursued unpopular but necessary policies such as anti-inflationary measures despite employment implications and her approach to the Unions. Would you question this narrative?\n\nPT: Reagan was very formative for me. I was in eighth grade in 1980 when Reagan got elected and felt at the time he was an incredibly great president and had solved all these problems once and for all. I think if I lived in the UK under Thatcher, I would have felt similarly. But they weren’t durable. We got Clinton and Blair after. The size of government didn’t shrink that much. The government sectors didn’t get weakened.\n\n‘Capitalism didn’t increase inequality but globalisation did’\n\nThere’s been a slowdown in tech since the 1970s. There was progress in the world of computers, internet, mobile, crypto, maybe now AI, but in a lot of other areas there was a much slower kind of progress. The question is, why did we not notice this faster? I think it’s because Reagan and Thatcher created a big lift. They made societies more capitalist by lowering marginal tax rates and deregulating. Lots of people got fired but the economy grew so most people ended up better off.\n\nReagan and Thatcher were exactly right for their time. But it wouldn’t work for all time. And to the extent that this distracts us from these science and technology questions, then it was somewhat problematic.\n\nThen there was the Clinton-Blair one-time fix, which was that you could somehow grow the economy and increase productivity through globalisation. That also probably gave you a big one-time lift. It came with very big long-term problems. It led to far more inequality. The Gini coefficient in the US went up more under Clinton than any other president post-1945. So capitalism did not increase inequality, but globalisation did.\n\nMy telling of the 50-year economic history is that we tried more capitalism with Reagan and Thatcher and it was the right thing to do. More globalism with Clinton and Blair was sort of the right thing to do, though it had more negative externalities that people were very dishonest about. We now need to do something very different.\n\nLB: Helen Andrews recently posited that feminism and gender-balance initiatives in the early Noughties led to a ‘Great Feminisation’. She claims this caused the prioritisation of safety over risk, a workplace culture dominated by consensus and appeals to emotion rather than logic in decision–making. How much do you buy into this as a theory of stagnation?\n\nPT: I think it’s very courageous of her to tackle something that is relatively taboo… Yes, I think there was a shift towards a risk-averse society. Feminisation was part of that. Things also went wrong with educational institutions or too much regulation. The deeper cause is that there was something dangerous and scary about where a lot of science and technology had gone.\n\nLB: Are you saying that diversity and inclusion efforts were an attempt to derail technological progress?\n\nPT: I think at some point people got very scared of where this stuff was going. Absolutely. It wasn’t just the nuclear thing. I would say that environmentalism as a movement was very focused on the dangers of limitless progress, even though in theory, you could have a lot of forms of environmentalism that would be pro-tech, right? If you’re concerned about climate change, we could build lots of new nuclear reactors that don’t emit carbon. But if we’re worried that nuclear reactors could be dual use and used to make nuclear weapons then you can’t do that. In some sense the energy shifted into this very anti-tech, anti-science direction for the past 50 years or so.\n\nLB: And you think DEI was a good way to achieve anti-tech goals?\n\n‘We’re going to end up with this really lame world where nothing happens but it’s maybe harder to blow up’\n\nPT: It’s always hard to know how intentional these things were. Diversity can function in an anti-tech way. If diversity really means homogenisation, let’s apply that to scientists. There’s no heterodoxy allowed, no heterodoxy on climate science, no heterodoxy on evolution, no heterodoxy on vaccines, on masks, on the origin of Covid. Everyone looks different but has to think alike. So diversity means conformity. And conformity is not compatible with science. And if diversity is a shibboleth, which I think is its important meaning, then we’re worshipping this god called diversity. It’s an unknown god. It’s a hypnotic magic trick that redirects our attention. And so we don’t care about science any more.\n\nJP: You seem to have a wider picture of American history, particularly in regard to wokeness. Many MAGA-adjacent people seem to think wokeness, or ‘cultural Marxism’, came from nowhere in the early 2010s, while you have identified before that it is a postwar phenomenon.\n\nPT: The culture wars are important. And there are ways in which there’s a side that’s right and there’s a side that’s wrong. But the big problem is that’s distracting us from things like housing or the economy generally, or science and tech or maybe even the CCP takeover of the world. This is where I push back against using the term ‘cultural Marxism’. I always think Marxism was at least about the economy. The focus on identity politics, multiculturalism, affirmative action, starts in the 1970s. That’s when inequality starts to go up. These things were at least correlated with us getting distracted from what I consider to be more important problems.\n\nJP: There are parts of the American right who now look at the changes of the 1960s, such the Civil Rights Act, and think it’s time to re-evaluate the postwar social consensus. What do you make of that?\n\nPT: I don’t think you can ever strictly go back. There are three questions about the history going back to the Helen Andrews piece or my stagnation thesis. First, there’s a question of what happened. Second is a question of why it happened. Then there is a very different question of what should be done now. That’s in some ways very different from the first two. Even if we can agree there’s been stagnation, even if we say the society became too feminised or too risk-averse, we don’t want to just get blackpilled from that. And then the question is: where are the places that you have some agency to get out of this straitjacket?\n\nWA: Are you optimistic that that’s happening? And do you think you’ve contributed towards it?\n\nPT: Somewhat, and very much yes.\n\nLB: Earlier you alluded to three doors we can go through: radical environmentalism, sharia law, or Chinese-style authoritarianism. If none of us wants to go through them then what’s the way out?\n\nPT: It’s a challenge on a political level because when you’re trying to win elections it ends up being about broader narratives. For people in Silicon Valley, in a way it’s more local. You can build a company and solve particular problems in that context. Silicon Valley turned out to be a big place where there was a moderate amount of freedom of action in the past few decades, although it wasn’t a panacea. There’s a part of me that thinks that for some problems you have to go through politics. If we’re going to come up with new cures and new types of nuclear power you have to somewhat deregulate the FDA [Food and Drug Administration] and the NRC [Nuclear Regulatory Commission]. Some of these things are entangled with politics. But a lot of progress has happened that is decoupled from politics. One of the things that’s still healthy about the United States, unlike Britain and France, is that the political capital, the financial capital, the technological capital are all in different places, so it is very decentred. There are places where these things overlap, but there’s some way where people are able to do things that are independent.\n\nJP: Is tech going to come to the rescue like the Eagles [in Lord of the Rings], deus ex machina, providing abundance that can kind of smooth over some of the economic challenges? And as a rejoinder to that, do you think the AI bubble is about to pop?\n\nPT: There are all sorts of things that I don’t particularly like about the AI revolution. It seems to be very concentrated on bigger companies, so it’s possible a lot of the returns are captured by a few companies, possibly leading to very uneven growth. While it may be a complement to human labour, it is probably more of a substitute than a complement. It will have a zero sum feel to a lot of people. At the same time if there is no other vector of growth in our society, we would be out of our minds not to take it. I don’t think it’s big enough to solve the budget deficit, but if the US embraces AI and Europe rejects it, I think the US is in somewhat better shape than Europe is.\n\n‘There are all sorts of things that I don’t particularly like about the AI revolution’\n\nOn the question of whether or not it is a bubble, I get asked this a lot by Europeans and that is how you know that they’re not going to build a lot of AI in Europe. If it’s a bubble, then people are spending too much money on AI, and they’re building too many data centres and buying too many chips, and you’re eventually going to get seriously diminishing returns on that. During the 1990s bubble, it was mainly the telecom fibre-optic infrastructure stuff where people really spent way too much and that had to get dialled back. But maybe it’s the other way around where there are high returns to AI, enabling the automation of certain workflows and enhanced productivity.\n\nIf the AI bubble does not burst, it’s possible that it ends up being quite inflationary because you have to use more power for these data centres. The atoms part of our economy is regulated and it’s hard to ramp up the power. But if the returns on power going to AI chips are really high, it will absorb a lot of energy. Interest rates could be higher because there’s more demand for capital. My macroeconomic placeholder is that it’s going to keep going.\n\nI’ve been allergic to AI for a long time because it can be a horrible buzzword. There was a 2016 report during the Obama administration on AI by the National Science and Technology council. If you did a search and replace, and replaced every use of the word AI with computers, it would have read the same way.\n\nAI also meant all these really different things over time. In 2014, [Nick] Bostrom defined it as machines being way smarter than humans. Kai-fu Lee wrote the CCP counterpoint AI Superpowers in 2017, where he defined it as this sort of low-tech, big data machine learning. Then in 2022 it turns out the AI revolution is LLMs [large language models] which can pass the Turing test. People had thought this would be what AI was for 70 years. So in the decade before we were about to pass the Turing test we had forgotten about it.\n\nThe dynamic when one has to think through a lot \n\nIf you look at the ratio of how many businesses there are per 100,000 people: what part of the US has the lowest number of businesses? Silicon Valley. That’s because the costs of business are higher, so these subscale businesses that are too small to go anywhere are even harder to get started. In a third-world country where there are no good businesses and everyone is an umbrella salesman, they are very entrepreneurial, but not in a scalable way. So you need to differentiate entrepreneurship from scalable businesses.\n\n‘If you’re too focused on history, you don’t pay enough attention to the future’\n\nThere’s this economist called Thomas Gür who has researched the idea that immigrants are more entrepreneurial. While that is correct, you have to adjust for the quality of the businesses and the immigrants start businesses by starting a taco truck because there’s nothing else you can do. It’s better than going on welfare. But that’s what you do when you’re not really part of a society. It’s better than nothing, but what you really want to do is scale.\n\nJP: Is there a cutting-edge domain that you would focus your energies on?\n\nPT: One of the lines we had in Zero to One [Thiel’s 2014 book about startups co-written with Blake Masters] is from Anna Karenina. It’s the opening line: ‘Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.’ The opposite is true of business. All failed businesses are more or less alike because they fail to escape from this problem of homogeneous competition. They didn’t do anything special. All successful businesses are special in their own way. That’s the closest I can give you to a formula and it’s incredibly hard to figure out what that is, or how to do it. I have some feel for it, I know it when I see it.\n\nTo wrap things up, I have spent a lot of time thinking about the past. That’s because it’s important. It’s how we got here. It’s what shaped a lot of these debates. At the same time, there’s also some limit to history. If you’re too focused on it, you don’t pay enough attention to the future. The point is not just to reflect on the past.\n\nThere was a medieval play on the Antichrist from 1160 or so, Ludus de Antichristo. It’s not a very good literary production, but there are these three kings, the Antichrist conquerors who focus on things like nationalism or their countries or their history. They lose because they’re too fixated on the past whilst the Antichrist is thinking about the future, and about what can be done. They don’t see Antichrist coming. So while it’s very important for those on the right to think about the past, to think about the history and what happened – they still should not lose sight of the future.",

    "title": "Researchers sound alarm on Chinese EV batteries after studying them in 'real-world practice': 'Extremely high failure rates'",
    "description": "\"They know exactly what they're ordering.\"",
    "fullText": "A European electric vehicle battery repair shop is warning that certain Chinese packs in popular Tesla models do not hold up to the rigors of use.\n\nEV Clinic reported that Model 3 and Y vehicles with LG NCM811 batteries from the LGES Nanjing factory \"show extremely high failure rates.\" It noted that while cells made in China are often touted as \"the best,\" this assertion \"has never been confirmed in real-world practice.\"\n\nIt compared the batteries to American Panasonic NCA packs, which last noticeably longer and even start their lifespans on a better footing. EV Clinic said that most of the LG models it tested had multiple cell failures that were not repairable. This happens at around 250,000 kilometers (155,343 miles) of use. The Panasonic models featured repairable single-cell failures after 400,000 km (248,548 mi).\n\n\"For reference, a healthy Panasonic cell typically shows ~10 megaohms, while a new LG Nanjing cell starts around 28 mΩ. A failing Panasonic cell reaches ~28 mΩ, which is what LG cells measure when brand new,\" EV Clinic stated.\n\nIn a conversation on the social platform X about the news, users wondered whether the \"bad\" batteries were in their EVs and how many makes and models were affected. The part number in question is 17000012-00-B.\n\nThe company added that it had tested more than 40 units across three shops and that because Tesla's first produced pack was such a \"disaster,\" the \"failure rate will be even more present\" over the next two years.\n\nThis is, of course, unwelcome information for people who have EVs with LG batteries. It may also give potential buyers pause, even though EVs save drivers money by eliminating the cost of gas and reducing maintenance requirements. While EVs feature battery warranties, no one wants to go through the hassle of replacing such an important component relatively soon after buying a vehicle.\n\nLG, which is based in South Korea, has a history of similar problems, too. In 2021, it had to pay General Motors $1.9 billion for defective batteries in the Chevrolet Bolt. This year, it recalled half a million stoves, also because of fire risk.\n\nIn its report, the Croatia-based EV Clinic said the best lithium-ion cells are made in the United States and Europe, naming Panasonic, LG Chem, and Samsung SDI. It noted that customers could get a repair check for 1,200 euros ($1,412), while a repair would cost 5,500 euros ($6,473). It recommended swapping in a used Panasonic battery as the optimal solution for a faulty pack, which costs 8,000 euros ($9,415).\n\nOn X, plenty of folks implored the institute for details, with one asking: \"How can you drop a bomb like this and don't explain with extreme precision which cars are concerned (model, version, year and factory)? Every 3/Y long range and perf owners are now worried and don't even know which battery pack they have. Please help us understand.\"\n\nDo you worry about the longevity of EV batteries?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nSomeone else pointed out that Chinese batteries bring to mind domestic manufacturers such as CATL and BYD rather than LG. \"BYD Blade battery packs have shown to be superior in Giga Berlin-made Model Ys,\" they wrote.\n\nAnother X user wrote: \"People will blame LG when it's Tesla that deserves the hate. They know exactly what they're ordering. If Apple had failure rates or lower quality like this, they would cut it off nearly immediately.\"\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

Whether you’re surviving harsh environments, building sprawling systems, or just chilling and catching fish, the online co-op games on this list will keep you and all your friends hooked and coming back for more. If you're looking for a cozier setup, check out our best couch co-op games list.\n\nPlayed online with friends, Divinity: Original Sin 2 becomes less about obsessively optimizing builds and more about reacting together to a world that’s constantly responding to your choices. It sounds cheesy, but if you want a game where you can create actual shared stories and feel like your actions impact an entire world, get your mates downloading Divinity: Original Sin 2.\n\nThe game’s strength lies in how much freedom it gives you all. Quests rarely have a single solution, and disagreements about what to do next are only a sign that you're properly invested. Whatever you do, the game adapts, and the group adapts with it. Combat is turn-based, which gives everyone time to think and discuss/argue over the best plan. Outside of combat, exploration also feels pretty communal if you lean into it, with players splitting up to investigate different areas and then regrouping with new ideas. Divinity: Original Sin 2 is a long game, but one that rewards groups willing to commit to a shared adventure--one of you can even be the Game Master if you'd like. There's a new Divinity game coming out at some point, too, so keep your eyes peeled and dig deep into the lore so you don't get left behind.\n\nValheim is one of those games that is almost always better in co-op than played alone. Fans make a lot of noise about the deep exploration and survival mechanics (rightly so), but its base building is another example of where online co-op really shines. Building a settlement together turns the game into a long-term group project, where everyone contributes in their own way. Watching a base slowly grow from a rough shelter into a functioning village is deeply satisfying, and who doesn't want to build a massive Viking longhouse?\n\nThere’s also a comforting rhythm to games like Valheim. Log in, check what needs fixing, expand a wall, add a roof, and then head out together for the next goal. The game supports both focused teamwork and casual hanging out, making it ideal for groups that want something flexible but meaningful. Why not grab some Valheim mods while you're at it?\n\nPhasmophobia is half co-op, half creepy chaos, and by far one of the best horror games on Xbox. It’s a game where communication isn’t just helpful, it might just save your life. Playing with friends transforms what could be a terrifying solo experience into a tense but often hilarious group effort. Just seeing how your nearest and dearest react to jumpscares in real-time is always a treat.\n\nThe aim of the game is to investigate paranormal activity using a selection of tools and finding evidence. Each investigation in Phasmophobia becomes a shared puzzle between four minds, as you split tasks, compare evidence, and constantly relay information over voice chat. Successes and failures feel communal, and the stakes only get higher as the hauntings get more intense. On the up side, shared responsibility makes it easier to laugh about afterward, even if you were shrieking with very real fear in the moment.\n\nGreen Hell is the survival game you recommend to both your novice and veteran friends. Accessible and challenging all at once, the more support you have, the more manageable the challenges become. Green Hell's online co-op turns the jungle from an overwhelming threat into a shared challenge.\n\nSure, you can go out with weapons and stake a claim to the ground, focusing on combat and conquest, or you can raise animals in wooden holding pens, nurture crops, and build--dare we say, cozy--shelters for you and your comrades. Despite including a number of real-world survival techniques and some genuinely challenging hostile encounters, Green Hell isn't too punishing when you've got a group around you to scout, scavenge, defend, and farm your new home.\n\nFanatical and GameSpot are both owned by Fandom.\n\nWebfishing is a little different than most games on this list, but a worthy addition nonetheless. It's a low-key, low-stakes, low-poly chill out zone, where you and your friends can customize animal avatars, go fishing, chat about life, and explore. It's a space for conversation and de-stressing, a great alternative to a group chat, especially if you don't mind periods of silence and relaxation.\n\nOver time you acquire better equipment, new threads, and the ability to catch better fish. Show off your catches, sell them, or merely explore. There are a few secrets hidden in the game that might cause a spark of excitement, but we'll not spoil too much here.\n\nDon’t Starve Together is the standalone multiplayer version of Don't Starve, a game full of harsh wildernesses, strange creatures, and deep mysteries. The game’s uncompromising world is much easier to navigate when mistakes are made--and learned from--together, either with friends in a private server, or with strangers online.\n\nThis one should be an easy sell to friends who aren't sure about survival horror, as Don't Starve is also a game like Minecraft in that you can mine, craft, explore, and gather resources to make a communal base. Just don't mention what happens in the dark.\n\nFactorio is co-op at its most collaborative. It’s a game about building systems, and playing online turns those systems into group efforts that constantly evolve--it's like getting a job in a factory, except you don't get paid and it's actually fun.\n\nEach player can take ownership of part of the factory, but nothing exists in isolation. Changes ripple outward, encouraging constant communication and coordination. Planning becomes a shared activity, often involving diagrams, discussions, and occasional redesigns. Only enlist your smartest, most strategic friends.\n\nDeep Rock Galactic is a great gateway horror game for when you don't want something too scary, easing you and your friends into a slightly spooky experience that requires focus and commitment to survive. Missions are designed so that players naturally rely on each other’s strengths, making co-op feel purposeful and fun, despite the horrors that persist.\n\nEach class contributes something unique, encouraging loose communication without forcing strict coordination. Deep Rock Galactic strikes a balance between structure and flexibility, letting groups play casually or strategically, and employs its light-hearted tone to keep things flowing even when the going gets tough.\n\nTerraria in co-op feels like a shared sandbox adventure, a story only you and your friends could have written. Online play turns simple exploration and building into group projects that evolve organically, battles that require backup, and bases worthy of Terraria's most elaborate decor.\n\nYou'll naturally split tasks--some of you can explore, some can build, some can fight--and then regroup to share the spoils with everyone. The procedurally generated world feels more alive the more people live in it, reflecting the collective efforts of everyone involved and growing at a pace alongside you. Depending on your ability and playstyle, you can choose to go the offensive route, battling your way through the wilds, or become a homebody, creating a comforting environment for everyone to come back to once they're done fighting. There's a role for everyone. If you're needing some inspiration, check out our extensive Terraria guidesto get you started.\n\nAstroneer turns the realities of brutal and isolated space exploration into a cooperative, rewarding process, which is why it's one of the best survival games you can play online. Online co-op encourages players to plan, experiment, and adapt together as they reshape alien worlds and make it through another night. The tactile feel of the game's crafting system and potential for laid-back exploration and terraforming means you can (as long as you're willing to carry some of the survival responsibility) play it with just about anyone.\n\nWhen your oxygen level is on the line, tasks feel lighter when shared. It's not a punishing survival game, but it expects you to keep an eye on many moving parts at once for your colonization efforts to be effective. For creative groups who enjoy a bit of focus and tranquility, Astroneer might just hit the spot\n\nLovers in a Dangerous Spacetime is a light-hearted and silly online co-op game where every action requires coordination, and success depends on players communicating constantly, despite being in stitches.\n\nRunning a spaceship together (especially when you're just lil' guys) means juggling roles on the fly. Shields, weapons, navigation--it all requires cooperation, often under pressure and with heavy doses of chaos. It's an easy game to pick up and a fun party game for breaking the ice, we've even rated it one of the best couch co-op games to play together.",

    "description": "The NFL is expecting each team to compete in an international game on a rotational basis. The Dallas Cowboys are due to appear in one, and it could come much sooner than later.",
    "fullText": "The Dallas Cowboys have not appeared in an international game since 2014, which is the longest active streak among any NFL franchise.\n\nWith the league now proposing that each team take part in a game on foreign soil at least once every eight years, the Cowboys are next in line to book a trip out of the country for a game. The new rule came about in 2022, so no agreements have been broken yet, but the Cowboys' worldwide fame is a bit surprising that no international exposure has been scheduled yet.\n\nIn 2014, it was Tony Romo and Dez Bryant who led a Cowboys team to a 31-17 win in London over the Jacksonville Jaguars. It was the franchise's first and only game played outside of the United States.\n\nCowboys owner Jerry Jones not only thinks Dallas' next international game is approaching, but that it could be south of the border as soon as next season. The NFL is already planning to host a game next season at Estadio Azeteca in Mexico City in 2026.\n\n“I think probably in the near time,” Jones said about the idea, “with near being next year.”\n\nWe've already looked at the Cowboys' potential 2026 schedule based on them being locked into the No. 2 placing in the NFC East. Dallas is scheduled to host nine games at AT&T Stadium and travel to eight road games.\n\nOne of those home contests would have to be sacrificed for an international game. If it comes in Mexico City, we figure that'd be as close to a home-like crowd as you can find outside of Arlington.\n\nWhether it's in North America or Europe, the general expectation is for Dallas to be the home team in this one because they've been voided of the opportunity as a visitor in the past. Home teams in these games get to choose their opponent, and many are smart not to pick a team with such a large fanbase and global brand like the Cowboys with the risk of losing merchandising sales or in-stadium support.\n\nAccording to ClutchPoints, Jones says that Dallas being the home team in order to score a game is \"unavoidable under the current framework,\" because it's also they will have to rotationally give up a home game and compete internationally anyway.\n\nWith this in mind, don't be surprised if \"America's Team\" takes on foreign soil in the near future.",

    "title": "Copper prices are soaring. Here's what that often signals for the economy.",
    "description": "Copper prices have rallied over 35% so far this year amid supply shortages, surging global demand, and tariff uncertainty.",
    "fullText": "Some offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us, which may affect which products we write about, but not our recommendations. See our Advertiser Disclosure.\n\nMetals have had a record year with recent surges in gold (GC=F) and silver (SI=F) prices, but there’s a third metal hitting its own record highs. Copper prices have rallied by more than 35% this year, poised for the biggest annual gain since 2009, driven higher by rising tech demand, supply constraints, and tariff uncertainty.\n\nGlobal copper (HG=F) prices officially surpassed $12,000 per ton on the London Metal Exchange on Tuesday for the first time ever and continued to march higher on Wednesday.\n\nEach type of metal reacts slightly differently to economic conditions, and copper is no exception. However, unlike gold and silver, copper isn’t so directly influenced by investor sentiment or economic expectations. Its price movements can typically be attributed to physical growth and expansion.\n\nCopper is often viewed as a barometer for the economy. It plays a central role in power grids, construction, industrial machinery, and more. When there’s a demand for those types of goods or services, it’s typically a good sign that the economy has a clean bill of health — giving copper its nickname: Doctor Copper.\n\nRising copper prices often signal strong industrial demand and a rapidly growing economy, while falling prices may indicate an economic slowdown, according to Goldman Sachs Research. Copper is “a major beneficiary of investments in grid and power infrastructure globally, as AI and defence heighten the need for robust and secure energy networks,” wrote Goldman Sachs Research analyst Eoin Dinsmore in a note.\n\nGold is seen as more of a “safe-haven” asset and a hedge against inflation. Silver straddles the line between gold and copper and has both investment and industrial purposes. Copper, however, is predominantly industrial. It’s not typically purchased to be stored like gold or silver but meant to be used, which is why it’s usually the strongest indicator, of the three metals, that the economy is moving in the right direction.\n\nThere are a few key reasons that copper is experiencing a surge right now. Major copper-producing regions such as Chile and Indonesia have faced supply challenges and environmental disasters that have contributed to a global copper shortage and a tighter market.\n\n“After essentially flat mine supply growth expected this year, our 2026 mine supply growth estimates have fallen to only around +1.4%, or about 500 kmt lower than our estimates at the beginning of the year,” said Gregory Shearer, head of base and precious metals strategy at JPMorgan, in a statement.\n\nA dip in supply isn’t the only factor that’s pushing prices higher. In July, the Trump administration issued tariffs on several categories of copper imports, putting additional pressure on the market. At the same time, heavy investment in the AI sector is significantly boosting demand because of its reliance on copper for data centers.\n\nOne source estimates that hyperscale AI data centers can use up to 50,000 tons of copper per facility.\n\nAs far as where prices are headed, JPMorgan Global Research expects copper prices to reach $12,500 a ton in the second quarter of 2026, ultimately averaging around $12,075 a ton for the full year.\n\nWhile researchers are optimistic that copper prices will continue on an upward trend, experts say the long-term implications of recent price surges remain uncertain.\n\n“The intersection of tariffs and copper prices in July 2025 highlights the complex dynamics of global trade and commodity markets,” said David Koch, CFP and director of portfolio management at Halbert Hargrove. “While the immediate effect has been a sharp rise in copper prices, the long-term consequences will depend on how markets, governments, and industries adapt to this new trade environment.”\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nGold and silver prices have been on a tear, with silver prices increasing by more than 100% year to date.

    "description": "The USS Nautilus, the world's first nuclear-powered submarine, participated in scientific and military operations around the world.",
    "fullText": "On January 17, 1955, the USS Nautilus transmitted a historic message: \"Underway on nuclear power.\"\n\nAs the world's first nuclear-powered submarine, Nautilus could remain submerged for two weeks at a time and travel at speeds of over 20 knots, or about 23 miles per hour.\n\nPreviously, World War II submarines powered by diesel engines and electric batteries could stay underwater for just 12 to 48 hours at a time. Since their batteries only charged while surfaced, diesel-electric US Navy vessels like the USS Cobia had to move at around 2 or 3 miles per hour to conserve power and hit maximum speeds of 9 knots, or about 10 miles per hour.\n\nNautilus is now part of the Submarine Force Museum in Groton, Connecticut. Visitors can walk through the historic nuclear submarine and see how its crew members lived and worked while submerged up to 700 feet below the surface.\n\nI visited the museum in March to tour Nautilus. Take a look inside.\n\nNautilus, which was commissioned in 1954, hosted the first-ever underwater legislative meeting when 13 members of Congress rode Nautilus in 1955.\n\nIts nuclear power allowed Nautilus to sail under the polar ice cap and become the first ship to traverse the North Pole in 1958 in an expedition known as Operation Sunshine.\n\nNautilus also participated in the naval blockade of Cuba during the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962.\n\nAfter 26 years of service, Nautilus was decommissioned in 1980 and recognized as a National Historic Landmark in 1982. It opened to the public as part of the Submarine Force Museum in Groton, Connecticut, in 1986.\n\nIn 2021, Nautilus underwent $36 million of preservation work and reopened in 2022.\n\nThe Submarine Force Museum is open Wednesday through Monday and is free to visit.\n\nI was amazed by the size of the submarine. As I climbed aboard, the deck provided gorgeous views of the Thames River.\n\nHere, crew members loaded torpedoes for firing.\n\nAfter the torpedoes were loaded, the tubes were flooded with water. When the command to fire was issued, high-pressure air from the submarine's ejection pump then forced the water and the torpedoes out of the tubes.\n\nSigns on the sink and mirror indicated that they were part of the submarine's original equipment.\n\nNautilus had a crew of 11 officers and 105 enlisted service members.\n\nA panel of instruments along the wardroom's wall indicated Nautilus' depth and speed.\n\nOfficers ate the same meals as the rest of the crew members, but their food was brought up to the officers' pantry via a dumbwaiter to be reheated and served on Navy china.\n\nThe walls of the narrow hallway were covered in wood paneling.\n\nThe book was gifted to Nautilus' commanding officer, Commander William R. Anderson, in 1957 by the French Navy's chief of staff, Adm. Henri Nomy. The fictional submarine in the book is also named Nautilus.\n\nFewer beds in a room indicated a higher rank.\n\nThe executive officer, also known as the \"XO,\" was the ship's second-in-command.\n\nThe commanding officer used the stateroom as a workspace and living quarters.\n\nThe yeoman managed the ship's correspondence and personnel records.\n\nThe attack center contained periscopes to spot enemy ships and the controls to aim and fire torpedoes.\n\nOn the diagram, Nautilus is represented by the bottom ship, and the top ship represents the target.\n\nThe torpedo firing key, which was used to deploy the torpedoes, was indicated with a blue sign on the firing panel.\n\nThe guns were used for security while the submarine was in port.\n\nSonar stands for \"sound navigation and ranging.\" Active sonar emitted sound pulses to locate targets, while passive sonar listened for underwater activity.\n\nBefore that, ladders were used to climb from one level to another.\n\nCommands were issued in the control room by a crew member known as the diving officer of the watch, who received orders from the attack center.\n\nWhen the main ballast tanks filled with water, the submarine would submerge. When filled with air, the submarine would surface.\n\nThe ESM bay's instruments could detect other ships' radars.\n\nThe radio room was located just off the control room on the right.\n\nHere, crew members ate meals, worked, and spent their recreational time.\n\nDamage control personnel used OBAs if fires broke out on board while submerged. The hoses on the masks could be attached to the submarine's reserve air supply.\n\nSince there was no Navy chaplain on board the submarine, crew member volunteers conducted services for various faiths with items from the lay services box.\n\nNautilus was mainly powered by its nuclear reactor, but the battery served as an auxiliary source of power in case of an emergency.\n\nA window connected the galley to the scullery, where crew members washed dishes.\n\nNautilus had two crew quarters, one at the front of the submarine and one at the back.\n\nI swiveled the periscope until I could see my car sitting in the museum's parking lot, which was pretty cool.\n\nJust over 70 years after Nautilus was commissioned as the first nuclear-powered submarine in the world, all of the US Navy's submarines are now nuclear-powered, according to the Department of Defense.",

    "description": "Spanish women's soccer is at the top of the world, bearing the star of world champions. However, the ambition of this generation is insatiable, and its new leader is no stranger to the mix of success ...",
    "fullText": "Spanish women's soccer is at the top of the world, bearing the star of world champions. However, the ambition of this generation is insatiable, and its new leader is no stranger to the mix of success and frustration.\n\nSonia Bermúdez, a legend of Spanish soccer and newly appointed head coach in 2025, knows the weight of history and the bittersweet taste of defeat. Her appointment, following a brilliant stint in the lower categories of the RFEF, came right after the National Team fell short of European glory, losing in the final of the Women's EURO in the fateful penalty shootout.\n\nWith an eye on 2026, a crucial year to establish the project and qualify for the next World Cup, Bermúdez sets aside tactics and scouting reports to write a very special letter. From her coach's heart, this is her wish list for Santa Claus, filled with hope and with the sole aim of ensuring that Spanish dominance has no end.\n\nI know this wish list is not written by a child, but by a woman who, after more than two decades in soccer, has taken on the greatest challenge of her career: being the Head Coach of the Spanish Women's National Team.\n\nMy first months have been intense. We conquered the Nations League and felt the support of more than 55,000 voices at the Metropolitano, reaffirming our leadership. But we also suffered the setback of being just one step —one penalty— away from European glory.\n\nThat defeat in the Women's EURO Final hurt us, but it has injected us with a voracious hunger. Therefore, my wishes for 2026 are requests aimed at consolidating our hegemony and building an unbeatable future:\n\nMy first and most urgent wish is that 2026 be the year in which, without speculations or unnecessary anxieties, we secure direct qualification for the 2027 Women's World Cup in Brazil.\n\nThe goal is clear: to arrive at the World Cup in full condition to defend our star and demonstrate that we are a power that not only wins but remains at the top. I ask that the team maintains ambition and that the pressure of being the current world champions propels us, rather than paralyzes us.\n\nSanta Claus, you well know that my heart is also in the grassroots, as I spent years watching these generations grow in the lower categories. Therefore, I wish that Spanish formative soccer continues to shine brightly on the international stage.\n\nWe cannot rest. I ask that investment continues in infrastructure, qualified personnel, and talent detection, so that the RFEF's player factory remains the most envied in the world. We need future \"golden generations\" to continue winning European and world titles in their categories, ensuring a quality succession that guarantees the National Team is always well-nourished.\n\nWe are world champions due to the strength of the collective, but that collective is full of talents that deserve the highest recognition. My last great wish is for Spanish players to once again be the undisputed protagonists in achieving individual titles like the Ballon d'Or and the The Best award.\n\nThis is more than a whim; it is the thermometer of the level of our league and the individual quality of our players. I ask that this recognition be the norm, not the exception, and that the mark of Spanish soccer is imprinted on all global awards.\n\nThe table is set, and the excitement is at its peak. We only need health, a bit of your magic for those moments of fortune, and the certainty that Spanish women's soccer will continue to grow without limits.\n\nWith gratitude and determination,\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence. You can read the original version in 🇪🇸 here.\n\n📸 Mateo Villalba Sanchez - 2025 Getty Images",

Historians trace the use of evergreens in winter festivals as far back as ancient Egypt and Rome. But the modern American custom has more recent roots: to the 1800s and German immigrants in Pennsylvania. These immigrants are believed to have brought the practice to their new home in the U.S.\n\nThe tree custom gained even more traction when it appeared in an adapted sketch of Queen Victoria and her German-born husband and their children that was published in a U.S. women’s magazine. Many credit it with kicking off a trend that has endured to today.\n\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n\nAnd while a number of people in recent years have opted for lower-maintenance synthetic trees, many revelers still prefer the look and smell of real trees. But because of climate change natural Christmas trees and their fans are facing new threats.\n\nToday we talk to Priya Rajarapu, an assistant professor and Christmas tree extension specialist at Oregon State University, about the risks tree growers are weathering and what, if anything, can be done.\n\nSo, Priya, what exactly do you do?\n\nPriya Rajarapu: [The] most simplest way I could explain is: when you are sick you call a doctor, and when Christmas trees are sick growers usually reach out to me.\n\nPierre-Louis: What kinds of trees are Christmas trees, and how are they typically grown?\n\nRajarapu: So Christmas trees are all usually fir trees or evergreens, and there’s a history behind it. Evergreens tend to keep their needles throughout the season. So it’s a symbolism of hope, so Christmas is usually celebrated around that. It’s also looking forward to the spring and harvest season.\n\nAnd Christmas trees, although they are evergreens that you see mostly in forests, they are an important agricultural commodity in the U.S. We sell [roughly] 14 million Christmas trees, as of 2022 survey in the U.S. ...\n\nRajarapu: And the four major Christmas-tree-producing states include Oregon, North Carolina, Washington and Michigan.\n\nPierre-Louis: So we really are talking about a farmed product, and I don’t think most people typically picture Christmas trees the same way that we think of, say, corn or potatoes. What makes a farmed tree different from the trees that I see in the forest?\n\nRajarapu: Yeah, I’m glad you mentioned the corn and potato analogy because that’s the best way to view Christmas trees, too, is that they are grown similar to corn and potatoes or any other vegetable crops. It’s just that it’s a specialty crop—it’s a tree, so it has a longer rotation. So corn, you can get a crop in an ear ...\n\nRajarapu: But Christmas tree, you’re harvesting the tree. Then you have to wait anywhere, depending on the species, from five to 10 years to harvest a tree.\n\nAnd the difference between the trees that are grown on farm and the trees that grow in the forest is that the trees that are grown [in] the farm are cultured ...\n\nRajarapu: Meaning they are pruned to give you that perfect Christmas tree shape, the typical triangle shape that you see. So growers invest a lot of time in culturing and pruning the trees so the trees can become bushier and fuller for people to hang more ornaments and not see the stem or branch.\n\nPierre-Louis: To kind of avoid the sad Charlie Brown Christmas tree.\n\nRajarapu: But there are—there is a customer base who still likes Charlie Brown Christmas trees, so there is a pretty decent-sized consumer base for natural trees or natural-looking trees.\n\nPierre-Louis: One of the parts of the work that you do is sort of looking at the pressures of climate change on tree production. And so what kinds of pressures are you seeing?\n\nRajarapu: So I would say the changing temperatures and lesser precipitation. So we are getting more and more days with less precipitation, so there are years where there is no precipitation for 100 days in Pacific Northwest, which does pose a lot of challenge for keeping trees healthy and also seedlings alive.\n\nSo for every Christmas tree that’s cut there is at least another two seedlings that are going back in the ground. So it, it’s a [roughly] 10-year rotation, so grower has to keep his crop going, so he or she plants trees every year in the ground, and that first year of growth or seedling establishment after transplanting them into the field or farm is very crucial. So when there is drought or when there is higher temperatures and lesser precipitation, it’s hard for that particular seedling to stay alive and establish itself. So that is one of the key challenges that growers are seeing with the changing weather patterns.\n\nAnd also, another change that I’ve noticed is [the] type of site that you choose for your species can also stress the trees and can attract insects such as bark beetles or twig weevils that were occasional pests—now their frequency is increasing.\n\nPierre-Louis: Because the climate is getting warmer?\n\nRajarapu: Yeah, because of the warmer climate and also lesser precipitation or no precipitation in Pacific Northwest. I’ve been in North Carolina, and it rains a lot. There, flooding is an issue. But in Pacific Northwest in summer, it’s dry.\n\nPierre-Louis: And that’s not normal, right? Like, in the past you wouldn’t get 100 days without rain.\n\nRajarapu: Correct. What I hear from growers is that it would rain until July Fourth ...\n\nRajarapu: It would, like, constantly rain, without any break. So the only time that they go without any precipitation is August and September, and then October it starts raining again. So it’s just the two months, which, typically, soil would hold enough moisture during that time.\n\nPierre-Louis: But now it’s extended to, like, 100 days, and the soil just can’t hold moisture for that long.\n\nRajarapu: Exactly, that’s what we are seeing. And right now I have an experiment that’s going in the field where I am trying to monitor the moisture present in the soil throughout the growing season and try different mulch covering the seedling so that I could improve that moisture retention in the soil by mulching the seedling, protecting that moisture in the soil from evaporating.\n\nPierre-Louis: And I know it’s still early, but are you seeing any sort of promising results, any suggestions of things that might help reduce the impact of those pressures on the seedlings?\n\nRajarapu: Yeah, sure, so the mulching practice or experiments to improve seedling survival; it’s not something new ...\n\nSo seedling survival—that first year of establishment is very crucial. It has just become so that, with the weather patterns, it has become more challenging. So some of the things that my predecessor and other professors at Michigan State University have tried is different root dips, so these are polymers, these are inert polymers that cover the root surface and are commercial products that are available and are claimed to hold moisture and also any nutrition.\n\nSo all these trials have been done in the past, and what came out or emerged as a hero or a savior is mulch. Just typical wood mulch would help seedlings survive and also significantly reduce the temperature—that is, soil temperature—under the mulch. But one of the concerns that growers have is that the wood mulch, depending on the source where they’re getting from, might carry some diseases that might infect their soil. But we don’t have any evidence, scientifically, for that. That’s one of the concerns they have.\n\nAnd it’s also the price. Like, if wood mulch is expensive, is there something that we are getting for free? For example, this year three or four different mulch covers that I’m trying is sawdust, compost, and I’ve tried hazelnut shells. Hazelnut is another big industry in Oregon, and all the hazelnut growers are wondering what to do with their shells after they harvest the nuts. So they are trying to find ways that they could reuse or repurpose these shells, so I’m testing that, also, as a mulch in this field trial.\n\nAnd right now my results show any kind of mulch would help the seedling survive better than having no mulch. But I’m studying more deeper into this, so I’m measuring needle chemistry to see if there is any difference in nutrition from these different mulch. That’s another concern for growers, too, that these raw, uncomposted mulch might steal nutrient from the soil and, also, a seedling might not be getting enough. So that’s another concern that I’m trying to address with this research.\n\nPierre-Louis: One of the ways tree farmers are coping with increasing pressures around climate change is by planting some different species of trees. I understand they’re maybe planting some trees that came originally came from Europe?\n\nRajarapu: Yep, so we, at OSU Extension, and also North Carolina State has a very strong Christmas-tree-genetics program. So back in 2010 researchers from Oregon State University and North Carolina State University and Washington State and Michigan State got together and went to Republic of Georgia and Turkey to find different species that can hold their needles well, can make other great Christmas trees ...\n\nRajarapu: And looked for these trees. So they collected seeds from trees that have great traits or that can make great Christmas trees. They brought in those seeds, and they grew all those seeds, two seedlings in the U.S. ...\n\nRajarapu: And planted in different regions within the U.S. So we have those trials, or test plots, in Washington, Oregon, North Carolina, Michigan, Connecticut, Pennsylvania. So all the same seedlings were planted in different regions to see if certain seedlings would emerge as perfect for that geographic condition.\n\nSo we found some that perform best in Oregon and Washington, and we have established seed orchards for the seedlings, or particular genetics, for Nordmann and Turkish fir. Those are the two firs that we identified or were brought into the U.S. as seeds, and we are growing them so that they can mature and produce seeds. And yes, these seem to do better than our natives, like noble fir, particularly, which is very sensitive to temperature changes and lesser precipitation, whereas these Nordmann and Turkish fir have been more resilient, and also, they do not attract a lot of pests that [are] typically [attracted to] the native trees. And also, they have high tolerance for different types of soil. So those traits are making them popular.\n\nPierre-Louis: So for the person who loves a live Christmas tree how concerned should they be that, at some point, it might not be accessible?\n\nRajarapu: So far growers are working really hard to keep the supply going. There is definitely a decrease in the number of acres in production of Christmas trees.\n\nWe are seeing that it might be price that might be driving some people to, like, change their mind. So artificial Christmas tree, it’s convenience and also the price. It’s, like, you’re paying $400 for 10 years. I think it all comes to that.\n\nWe are trying really hard to keep the number of trees, the live trees, accessible to all consumers. We usually have more trees than we have consumers, so I don’t think so ...\n\nRajarapu: Having a shortage would be a problem, as long as consumers are willing to buy the trees.\n\nPierre-Louis: That’s really cool. It’s been lovely learning so much about Christmas trees with you. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with us today.\n\nPierre-Louis: That’s all for today!

    "description": "Stories shape how your child thinks, feels, and understands the world.",
    "fullText": "Stories shape how your child thinks, feels, and understands the world. They connect language, emotion, memory, and meaning in a way few activities can. When storytelling becomes part of daily life, these connections strengthen and quietly influence learning, curiosity, and behavior.\n\nAt a cognitive level, stories train the brain to understand structure. A beginning leads to a middle. Actions lead to outcomes. This mirrors how children learn cause and effect. Research influenced by thinkers like Jean Piaget shows that children grasp ideas more deeply when they are embedded in meaningful narratives rather than abstract instruction.\n\nLanguage development accelerates inside stories. Words arrive with context, emotion, and repetition, which makes them easier to retain and reuse. When stories are read or heard regularly, children pick up sentence patterns, tone, and rhythm. Over time, this shows up as clearer expression and stronger listening skills.\n\nImagination plays a central role in emotional development. When your child steps into the world of a character, they practice seeing life from another point of view. This builds empathy and emotional awareness. Stories allow children to explore fear, joy, and frustration in a safe space, without real-world consequences.\n\nCreative storytelling also supports decision-making. Characters face problems, make choices, fail, and try again. Children absorb these patterns naturally. They learn that effort matters and that actions have outcomes. These lessons shape patience, self-control, and thoughtful behavior in everyday situations.\n\nStorytelling works best when it invites participation. Reading together or listening to a story and then talking about it turns passive consumption into active thinking. Simple moments help:\n\nDigital storytelling can support this process when it is designed with care. Calm visuals, clear language, and room for imagination matter more than constant interaction. This is where platforms like StoryBee fit naturally into a child’s routine.\n\nStoryBee allows parents and educators to create personalized stories based on a child’s age, interests, and learning needs. A story can be read, illustrated, or listened to as audio, which supports different learning styles. StoryBee focuses on creativity and imagination rather than overstimulation, helping children stay engaged without losing the reflective nature of storytelling.\n\nFor busy parents, StoryBee also lowers the barrier to consistency. Instead of searching for the right book every day, StoryBee helps generate fresh stories that still encourage thinking, curiosity, and conversation. The experience stays flexible and child-led.\n\nYou do not need long sessions to see impact. One short story a day, whether from a physical book or through StoryBee, is enough.

    "description": "Gold's next rally won't need a crisis — the world's dysfunction is the catalyst.",
    "fullText": "Gold is finishing 2025 at all-time highs, and the momentum is set to extend into 2026.\n\nThe spot gold price surged past $4,500 per troy ounce for the first time on Wednesday in Asia trading and is trading around $4,490 per ounce. The yellow metal is up more than 70% so far in its best year since 1979.\n\nGold could stay strong because the rally drivers are structural, not purely reactive, according to analysts.\n\n\"Gold doesn't need a crisis to rise in 2026. It simply needs the world to behave the way it has been: elevated debt, policy uncertainty, fragile alliances, and a dollar that no longer dominates as it once did,\" wrote Farah Mourad, a market analyst at IG, a trading platform.\n\n\"In that environment, gold doesn't chase fear — it absorbs it,\" Mourad added.\n\nIG did not provide a price forecast but noted that major banks expect gold to trade in the $4,500 to $4,700 per ounce range next year, with potential upside toward $5,000 if macro conditions persist.\n\nMonetary policy could provide additional support. With inflation proving sticky and growth uneven, markets increasingly expect interest rates to drift lower over time.\n\nThat matters for gold, which tends to perform best when real yields fall, and the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets declines.\n\nThere are, of course, risks. A stronger-than-expected rebound in the US dollar or a sustained shift back toward risk-on sentiment could slow gold's advance.\n\nBut investor positioning in gold remains relatively balanced compared with previous peaks, suggesting the trade is not yet overcrowded, Mourad wrote.\n\nThat perspective aligns with forecasts from major banks.\n\n\"We see gold prices hitting more record highs in 2026,\" wrote Ewa Manthey, a commodities strategist at ING, earlier this month.\n\nFactors that could extend gold's bull run include President Donald Trump's likely choice of a next Fed chair inclined to push for lower interest rates, she wrote.\n\nShe added that gold is likely to find support on pullbacks.\n\n\"We expect the downside to be limited as any weakness will likely attract renewed interest from both retail and institutional buyers,\" Manthey added.\n\nWall Street giant Goldman Sachs predicts that gold prices will climb to $4,900 per ounce by December 2026.\n\nGold's surge this year has contributed to gains in other precious metals as well.\n\nSpot silver prices have also hit record highs this year and are trading about 147% higher year-to-date at around $72 per ounce.\n\nMeanwhile, spot platinum has also hit an all-time high and is up about 159% this year, trading around $2,342 per ounce.",

    "fullText": "HONG KONG/NEW YORK, Dec 23 (Reuters) - Global investors are increasing their wagers on Chinese artificial intelligence companies, betting on the next DeepSeek and seeking to diversify, with concerns growing about a speculative bubble in the sector on Wall Street.\n\nDemand for China's AI companies is also being stimulated by ​Beijing's push for tech independence. China has fast-tracked blockbuster listings of chipmakers, notably Moore Threads (688795.SS), dubbed \"China's Nvidia\", and MetaX (688802.SS), which both debuted this month.\n\nForeigners see China closing ‌the tech gap with the U.S. as Beijing steps up support for AI chipmakers, spurring bets on Chinese companies just as worries grow over lofty valuations on U.S.-listed AI stocks.\n\nU.K.-based asset manager Ruffer, for example, said it has \"deliberately limited ‌exposure\" to the Magnificent Seven - the U.S. tech giants - and is looking to add positions in Alibaba (BABA, 9988.HK) for a bigger exposure to China's AI theme.\n\n\"While the U.S. remains the leader in frontier AI, China is rapidly narrowing the gap,\" said Gemma Cairns-Smith, Investment Specialist at Ruffer. \"The moat may not be as wide, or as deep, as many think ... The competitive landscape is shifting.\"\n\nRuffer is gaining exposure to the AI theme through Chinese tech giants such as Alibaba, which operates an AI chip unit, owns large language model Qwen, and is ploughing money into cloud infrastructure.\n\nGlobal asset managers are increasingly eyeing Chinese AI firms ⁠as a wave of startups lists on the mainland and in ‌Hong Kong, seeking to tap into surging investor appetite following the meteoric rise of DeepSeek, China’s answer to ChatGPT.\n\nUBS Global Wealth Management in a report this month rated China tech as \"most attractive\", citing investors' search for geographical diversification and China's \"strong policy backing, technological self-reliance, and rapid ‍AI monetization\".\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) currently trades at 31 times earnings, compared with a multiple of 24 for Hong Kong's Hang Seng Tech (HSTECH.HK), which enables AI bets via stocks including Alibaba (BABA, 9988.HK), Baidu (BIDU, 9888.HK), Tencent (0700.HK, TCEHY) and chip foundry SMIC (0981.HK).\n\nRiding the momentum, U.S. investment adviser Rayliant helped launch a Nasdaq-listed fund in September that gives investors access to \"China's versions of stocks like Google, Meta, Tesla, Apple, and OpenAI\".\n\nKraneShares Chief Investment Officer Brendan Ahern said the ​rapid ascent of Chinese AI chipmakers such as Cambricon speaks to the scale and speed of innovation across China's AI and semiconductor industries.",

    "fullText": "Speaking after Everton’s 1-0 defeat to Arsenal, Toffees boss David Moyes told the media he believed his team were up against the best midfielder in the world on the night in Declan Rice.\n\n“[Tim Iroegbunam] was up against probably the best midfield player in the world in some ways,” Moyes said. “Declan developed himself, it’s not down to me, Declan was always going to be a great player. Mikel’s made him into a real top player.\n\n“He’s a great boy, more than anything, he’s a terrific boy, and because of that it’ll give him a great chance. [But he’s] a great player as well. Lots of top attributes.”\n\nMoyes and Rice obviously worked together during their respective spells with West Ham United, and the now-Everton boss has never denied how highly he rates the England international.\n\nEven before Saturday’s game, Moyes reiterated that he thinks Rice was worth much more than the £100m plus £5m bonuses that Arsenal paid.\n\n“I genuinely meant it at the time, I thought Declan was £150m,” Moyes said. “I thought we didn’t get enough at West Ham. We had offered Declan huge contracts but we couldn’t get him to stay. So the club had to do what they had to do.\n\n“I’m still in touch with him. I am going to abuse him today maybe!”\n\nRice certainly put in a good performance against Everton, with Alan Shearer even selecting him for his Premier League Team of the Week.\n\nThe midfielder completed 90% of his passes in Arsenal’s 1-0 win, creating two chances including one big chance and making 10 defensive contributions. The midfielder also won seven of his nine individual duels.\n\nAs frustrating as it must have been to come up against his old player on Saturday, Moyes must privately feel proud of his part in Rice’s rise.",

    "fullText": "A look back at the biggest tech stories of the year, from the rise and fall of Musk’s Doge to lucrative investments into AI\n\nHello, and welcome to TechScape. I’m your host, Blake Montgomery, wishing you a happy and healthy end of the year. I myself have a cold.\n\nToday, we are looking back at the biggest stories in tech of 2025 – Elon Musk’s political rise, burst, and fall; artificial intelligence’s subsumption of the global economy, all other technology, and even the Earth’s topography; Australia’s remarkable social media ban; the tech industry’s new Trumpian politics; and, as a treat, a glimpse of the apocalypse offered by one of Silicon Valley’s savviest and strangest billionaires.\n\nAt the close of 2024, I wrote that Elon Musk’s support of Donald Trump had made him the world’s most powerful unelected man. In 2025, his reign turned out to be short-lived. He rose fast and haphazardly, like a whizzing firework, only to explode spectacularly in June when he claimed in a post on X that the president of the United States was named in the government’s files on convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nEven in that short period of less than six months, Musk made a tremendous impact. He tore up wide swaths of the US government – tens of thousands of jobs, the security of extremely sensitive data, and entire agencies like USAID – that may never be stitched back together.\n\nAfter Doge imploded, Musk promised to turn back to his business empire, which saw great success and great failures alike in 2025. His rocket company SpaceX saw continued growth and is poised to conduct an initial public offering next year, perhaps as the most valuable private company in the world. Electric carmaker Tesla, by contrast, faced violent backlash and major competition from its Chinese counterparts, which produced cheaper and more advanced vehicles while Tesla’s innovation and inventory stagnated. These headwinds caused a global sales slump for Musk’s carmaker.\n\nLook back at our reporting on Doge, Tesla, SpaceX, Musk himself:\n\nThe “department of government efficiency”\n\nHow an obscure US government office has become a target of Elon Musk\n\nHow Elon Musk’s billionaire Doge lieutenant took over the US’s biggest MDMA company | Technology | The Guardian\n\nThe chaos Elon Musk and Doge are leaving behind in Washington\n\nTesla faces backlash over Musk’s politics\n\nEggings, swastikas and dog poop: Tesla bears brunt of people’s ire against Musk\n\n‘I’m selling the Nazi mobile’: Tesla owners offload cars after Musk’s fascist-style salutes\n\nLook ahead: SpaceX expands in preparation for 2026 IPO\n\nInside Elon Musk’s plan to rain SpaceX’s rocket debris over Hawaii’s pristine waters\n\nElon Musk’s SpaceX ‘preparing for flotation that could value it at over $1tn’\n\nArtificial intelligence has gone from a niche within tech to the industry’s most prominent focus. The Magnificent Seven – Apple, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia, and Tesla – are investing hundreds of billions of dollars into new software that they hope will do the bulk of humanity’s work before too long. The investment is driving the bulk of the growth of the US’s economy, giving rise to fears of a financial bubble and its popping. The US and China are locked in a cold war-esque race against each other, with startups in each country vying for cutting-edge breakthroughs, as governments around the world are forced to decide how they will regulate a new technological force.\n\nBefore AI can arrive at that future, though, it needs brains a la the Tin Man of The Wizard of Oz. Those brains come in the form of data centers. These massive buildings, which house the millions and millions of semiconductor chips booming AI development, have cropped up around the world, met with enthusiasm from leaders eager for tax revenue and deep concern from environmental advocates and, increasingly, local community members. The investment in and construction of data centers wrought huge change in the physical landscape of the Earth in 2025 as tens of billions of dollars chased any available land, electricity, water and semiconductor chips.\n\nMore from our reporting in the last year:\n\nThe AI boom is heralding a new gold rush in the American west\n\nRevealed: Big tech’s new datacentres will take water from the world’s driest areas\n\nWhat will your life look like in 2035?\n\n‘It’s going much too fast’: the inside story of the race to create the ultimate AI\n\nMulti-trillion-dollar valuations\n\nIs AI a bubble that’s about to pop? – podcast\n\nWhat is new in UK-US tech deal and what will it mean for the British economy?\n\nMeet the AI workers who tell their friends and family to stay away from AI\n\nElon Musk made a full-throated and whole-hearted embrace of Donald Trump in 2024 and 2025. He was not alone. Many of his fellows in Silicon Valley did the same, sitting beside the Trump family at the president’s inauguration after donating millions to his inaugural committee. The tech giants continued their embrace of Trump and his policies by scuttling their diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, which they championed during Barack Obama’s presidency, and by cooperating with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Trump’s harsh immigration crackdown. What the industry gave, it reaped tenfold in deregulation, friends high up in Washington like JD Vance and David Sacks, and a Trump order for states not to regulate AI signed just weeks ago.\n\nMore from our reporting this year:\n\nDonations and Trump’s inauguration\n\nElon Musk appears to give fascist-style salute after Trump inauguration – video\n\nTrump inauguration: Zuckerberg, Bezos and Musk seated in front of cabinet picks\n\n‘The reign of terror is over’: my weird weekend partying with the triumphant tech right\n\nZuckerberg’s swerve: how diversity went from being a Meta priority to getting cancelled\n\nDocuments offer rare insight on ICE’s close relationship with Palantir\n\nICE is using smartwatches to track pregnant women, even during labor: ‘She was so afraid they would take her baby’\n\nThis year saw Australia take the extraordinary measure of banning children under 16 from social media.

    "description": "Europe still wants and needs to work with Trump. But this year’s made it clear they’re increasingly on their own.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump’s first year back in office shattered any remaining illusions among European leaders that he can be managed or controlled.\n\nHis open hostility toward the European Union has strained a transatlantic alliance that’s endured since World War II and deepened rifts between Europe’s national leaders and within the bloc, imperiling its ability to respond to Trump’s threats and taunts with the kind of unity and strength he respects.\n\nThat’s left Ukraine’s fate hanging in the balance heading into 2026, not to mention unanswered existential questions about European security at a moment when many fear Russian President Vladimir Putin’s territorial aims extend further westward beyond Ukraine.\n\nBut in many ways, Europe has survived the roller coaster — for now.\n\n“The Europeans cannot afford to cut ties and to hand in the divorce papers because they are still too dependent, especially when it comes to security and an American military commitment to defending Europe,” said Jana Puglierin, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nBut, she continued, the efforts by leaders to maintain solid ties with the U.S. based on short- term interests do not mean the past year hasn’t clarified that the long-term interests are, for the moment, no longer aligned.\n\n“We need to be pretty clear-eyed,” she said. “In the old days, there was a clear mainstream understanding of the old transatlantic relationship enshrined by the Western values and norms and principles, the rules based international order. And now I think we see a competing project emerging.”\n\nThe administration is clear-eyed, too, heading into the new year.\n\nIt sees a continent losing its values and identity, beholden to liberal ideals that are doing far more to imperil European security than any missive from the White House. The act of a friend, the White House argues — as it pushes Europe to spend more on its own defense, restrict immigration and end the war in Ukraine — is to set it straight.\n\n“President Trump has great relationships with many European leaders, but he never shies away from delivering hard truths,\" White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said. \"The devastating impacts of unchecked migration, and those migrants’ inability to assimilate, are not just a concern for President Trump, but for Europeans themselves, who have increasingly noted immigration as one of their top concerns. These open border policies have led to widespread examples of violence, spikes in crime, and more, with detrimental impacts on the fiscal sustainability of social safety net programs.”\n\nAfter a blistering start to the year with Vice President JD Vance lecturing Europe over free speech in Munich and then tag-teaming Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy alongside Trump in the Oval Office, Europeans have adjusted to Trump’s worldview — a shift, as Romania’s Nicușor Dan described it, from a “moral way of doing things to a very pragmatic and economical way of doing things” — and succeeded at bringing the White House back into the fold on several fronts.\n\nThe EU’s submission on trade, accepting a new tariff of 15 percent, limited the short-term economic damage. NATO appeased Trump with its pledge to boost defense spending by 5 percent over the next decade, cemented at its June summit — thanks largely to allowing existing, non-defense spending to count for 1.5 percent of that new total.\n\nInstead of abandoning Ukraine, Trump agreed in July to provide additional defense aid for its war with Russia as long as Europe pays for it. And Europeans have been able to withstand Trump’s August meeting with Putin in Alaska and the administration’s announcement of a 28-point peace plan crafted in secret with the Kremlin, which they have worked with the U.S. and Ukraine to revise.\n\nIn an interview with POLITICO earlier this month, Trump blasted European leaders as “weak,” asserting that they “don’t know what to do” about immigration in particular. He questioned whether European leaders should continue to be allies, saying that “it depends” on their policies and that he wouldn’t hesitate to intervene in European elections to back far-right parties challenging the very coalitions and leaders he’s currently working with.\n\nThat coincided with the issuing of a new National Security Strategy that called for “cultivating resistance” to European centrism that’s committing “civilizational suicide” and expressed disdain for the European Union, which the administration labeled as “adverse” to U.S. economic interests.”\n\nConstanze Stelzenmüller, a senior fellow in the Center on the United States and Europe at the Brookings Institution, called the Europe sections of the new NSS a “game changer” for leaders across the Atlantic that has “permanently changed” long-term strategy with the U.S.\n\n“It shouldn't be underestimated how much of a shock it was for European leaders and publics to read the Europe chapter of the National Security Strategy and to see put in writing that this administration thinks of Europe, or European political centrists, as unreliable allies and is taking such an adversarial one against them,” she said. “For 2026, we need to buckle up and plan for the worst on all counts. We have obvious vulnerabilities, and those are going to be exploited.”\n\nTrump is also ending the year by reminding Europe of his brazen desire, outlined in his first term and again shortly before his second inauguration, to seize control of Greenland from Denmark, a reliable NATO ally whose per capita defense spending is among the highest of all member nations. On Saturday, he appointed Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry as special envoy to Greenland, a job that Landry said would focus on efforts to “make Greenland a part of the U.S.”\n\n“This is shattering for a lot of the countries who thought that there was nothing safer than their bilateral relationship with the United States,” Stelzenmüller said.\n\nWhile openly threatening Denmark, the administration has worked to drive a wedge into the European Union by suggesting that countries would get better trade deals by splitting from the 27-nation bloc and engaging with the White House bilaterally.\n\n“At the end of the year, the fundamental question facing the Europeans is whether they think tactical victories are enough to win the strategic war, which is to maintain the transatlantic alliance that’s stood for eight decades,” said Ivo Daalder, a U.S. ambassador to NATO under President Barack Obama.\n\nGerman Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who earlier this month declared the “Pax Americana” to be dead, seemed open to the possibility, saying last week that it’s become “quite obvious” that Trump “cannot relate” to the EU and that “at least there are individual member states, including Germany first and foremost, of course, with which such cooperation can continue.”\n\nMerz led a failed push in Brussels last week for the EU to repurpose $200 billion in seized Russian assets in a loan to Ukraine when Belgium, Italy and others balked. But he ultimately succeeded with a back-up plan of sorts, as the EU approved a $90 billion loan for Ukraine aimed at sustaining its military on the battlefield for two more years. Three Trump-aligned leaders in Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic opted out of the loan but did not block its passage.\n\nWhile Trump quietly opposed the EU effort to shore up Ukraine’s war chest, Europeans have mostly supported his diplomatic efforts to end the war, pushing for stronger security guarantees to ensure Ukraine survives long-term. Finnish President Alexander Stubb appeared Sunday on Fox News to declare that Trump’s efforts have helped advance the talks “closer [to a peace deal] than at any time of this war,” a comment seemingly aimed at the proverbial audience of one and only loosely grounded in what most European leaders actually believe.",

    "description": "When the 1930 tournament was staged in Uruguay, some nations could not afford the trip, players did not take it seriously and fights were common. What has changed since then.",
    "fullText": "Next summer’s World Cup will be the largest, most complex and most lucrative sporting event in history, with 48 teams playing 104 games in three countries. The tournament is expected to draw a global TV audience of nearly 5 billion and FIFA, the event’s organizer, is hoping for revenues of between $10 billion-$14 billion — which is why lower-bowl tickets for Iran-New Zealand at SoFi Stadium cost nearly $700.\n\nAll that seemed unlikely after the first tournament in 1930, when the idea of a soccer World Cup was nearly killed in the cradle, the victim from lack of planning, lack of money and lack of interest. That the competition survived, much less thrived, is nothing short of a miracle, says English writer and podcaster Jonathan Wilson, author of the deeply researched “The Power and Glory: The History of the World Cup.”\n\n“1930, it’s incredibly amateurish in many ways,” Wilson said. “It’s got that sort of almost like a school sports day feel to it.”\n\nOnly 13 countries took part in the first tournament; it was supposed to be 16 but the Egyptian team missed its boat to Uruguay while Japan and Siam (now Thailand) couldn’t afford the travel costs and pulled out. England, meanwhile, not only refused to play, but the British press ignored the event, as did much of Europe.\n\nThat seemed like a wise decision at the time since the first two matches of the inaugural tournament were affected by snow, with one of the opening games drawing just 4,444 fans. The smallest crowd in World Cup history, estimated at about 300, showed up for another first-round game between Romania and Peru and the TV audience … well, there was none since TV had yet to be invented.\n\nThe officiating was beyond suspect — Romania’s manager, Constantin Radulescu, also worked two games as a linesman — and the U.S. trainer, Jack Coll, had to be stretchered off the field during his team’s semifinal — yes, the U.S. made the semifinals! — with Argentina when he lost consciousness after inhaling the fumes from a bottle of chloroform that shattered in his pocket.\n\nIn another game, the penalty spots were mistakenly marked 16 yards from goal instead of the regulation 12 — and nobody noticed.\n\n“Some of the details don’t make sense,” Wilson said. “The whole thing is so sort of low grade compared to today.”\n\nWhen Argentine captain Nolo Ferreira left the tournament and returned home to take his law exams his replacement, Guillermo Stábile, scored a tournament-high eight goals in four games — then never played for the national team again (although he did coach it, leading the La Albiceleste to six South American titles and the 1958 World Cup).\n\nGiven the farcical nature of the 1930 World Cup, the tournament probably should have ended right there. Instead, 1930 has become the foundation on which next year’s competition was built.\n\nThe origins of the tournament, however, actually make sense. Before 1930, FIFA recognized the winner of the Olympic competition as the world champion. But that event was for amateurs, a point on which the International Olympic Committee would not budge.\n\nWith professional soccer growing in popularity, FIFA decided to stage its own breakaway event and play it in Uruguay, the country that had won the last two Olympic titles.\n\nThat quickly proved to be a big mistake. The growing effects of the Great Depression left many countries unable to afford the long, slow steamship trip to South America. The first tournament was open to any country that wanted to play, yet two months before the first game no European teams had agreed to come.\n\n“It was taken very seriously by Uruguay and Argentina,” Wilson said, but not by many others.\n\nThat changed shortly after Romania’s King Carol II, who ascended to the throne in a coup that deposed his son, personally selected his country’s World Cup roster and sent it on its way. France quickly agreed to go too, entering a makeshift team under pressure from FIFA president Jules Rimet, a Frenchman. Belgium also buckled under FIFA pressure and all three teams boarded the same ship for the trip to Uruguay, working out together on the 15-day voyage aboard the SS Conte Verde, an Italian ocean liner.\n\n“Even the four European nations who go it’s not entirely clear how seriously they took it,” Wilson said. “The French and Romanians, they kept diaries. They seem to have regarded this as a laugh. We’ll try to win but it doesn’t really matter.”\n\nThings didn’t really get loony until the tournament began. The Bolivian team, for example, played in berets, as did an Argentine midfielder, while the 15 referees who worked the games, some of whom had traveled and socialized with the players on the long boat ride from Europe, dressed formally in knickers, long-sleeve shirts, blazers and ties.\n\nThe well-dressed officials spent much of the tournament working with police to break up fights; play was so violent at least two players sustained broken legs and the U.S.-Argentina semifinal descended into a full-out brawl, with one American having four teeth knocked out and another hospitalized with injuries to his stomach.\n\nThe tournament finally finished with the hosts beating Argentina 4-2, after which the Argentines broke off diplomatic relations with their neighbor and an angry mob in Buenos Aires stoned the Uruguayan embassy.\n\n“It ended,” Wilson said of the tournament, “with everybody sort of fighting each other.”\n\nFew disagreed with the Argentine magazine El Gráfico, which seemed to predict there was little future for the fledgling event. “The World Cup is over,” it wrote. “The development of this competition brought not only an unpleasant atmosphere, but also an ungrateful one.”\n\nYet nearly a century later, the World Cup is still here. And that, too, was foretold in 1930 in the story of Romanian midfielder Alfred Eisenbeisser (who was also known as Fredi Fieraru because, why not?).\n\nOn the journey home from the first World Cup, Eisenbeisser contracted pneumonia and a priest was called to administer the last rites. The ship eventually docked in Genoa and he was taken to a sanatorium while the rest of the team continued on to Romania.\n\nAssuming her son had perished in Italy, Eisenbeisser’s mother arranged a wake — only to have her son stroll into the ceremony very much alive, causing the woman to faint. Eisenbeisser would play 12 more years of professional soccer and compete in figure skating in the 1936 Winter Olympics, where he finished 13th in the pairs competition.\n\nTurns out the reports of Eisenbeisser’s demise, like those of the World Cup, were greatly exaggerated.\n\n⚽ You have read the latest installment of On Soccer with Kevin Baxter.

    "title": "'This world is insane': Miss Universe contestants reveal the chaos behind this year's pageant",
    "description": "Miss Universe 2025 was plagued with controversy from the start. We spoke to over a dozen contestants to learn how the pageant fell apart.",
    "fullText": "The energy in the room couldn't have been more tense. Some women were yelling, telling their new friends to stand up and leave. Others were glued to their seats, crying in red-carpet-worthy gowns. Contestant Andromeda Peters was in the middle of it all.\n\nA licensed therapist since 2017, Peters felt compelled to help. She instructed the women to close their eyes and feel their backs against the chairs, to feel their feet planted firmly to the ground, some in their 6-inch stilettos. Then she began to lead the group through a breathwork exercise: Breathe in for four seconds, hold for four seconds, she said, and now exhale.\n\nIt was the very first day of Miss Universe.\n\n\"We were all distraught,\" Peters, who was Miss Ghana 2025, told Business Insider about her fellow contestants. \"I was going to walk out, but then I realized, there's a girl crying next to me and she's holding my hand. There's a girl behind me crying. So I helped my sisters ground themselves.\"\n\nChaos had erupted among the pageant queens after Miss Universe director Nawat Itsaragrisil yelled at Miss Mexico Fátima Bosch. Their confrontation was captured on livestream, kicking off what would become one of the messiest competitions in the pageant's 74-year history. When Bosch was ultimately named the new Miss Universe on November 21, many contestants wondered if they had ever really stood a chance at the crown.\n\nOver the weeks that followed, contestants that Business Insider spoke with would accuse the organization of grueling conditions, favoritism, inconsistent rules, and an ever-changing judging process. Interviews with more than a dozen contestants reveal how a pageant marketed as a women's empowerment platform had fallen apart as the world watched.\n\nNow, some believe that only a dramatic leadership change can fix Miss Universe.\n\n\"I could give you the pageant answer, or I could just be real: Everyone has to go, absolutely everyone,\" Miss Haiti Melissa Sapini said.\n\nThe Miss Universe Organization did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nAs November neared, 120 women packed their bags and began the journey to Thailand, where they'd spend a month attending events across Bangkok, Phuket, and Pattaya.\n\nFor many contestants, walking the Miss Universe stage was a childhood dream finally coming true. Some were seasoned pageant queens with multiple crowns and sashes glittering on their shelves. Others were first-timers. Miss Bonaire Nicole Peiliker-Visser was inspired to compete after her daughter won Mini Miss Universe, while Miss Hungary Kincső Dezsény was searching for a purpose beyond modeling.\n\n\"If you get beauty from … God, you need to use it for good,\" Dezsény told Business Insider.\n\nWhatever their motivation, the women thought they knew what to expect. The three-week competition would kick off with sponsorship events and media opportunities as they traveled throughout Thailand. Then, contestants would return to the capital to compete in the evening gown, swimsuit, national costume, and interview competitions. A panel of judges would determine the results, though one woman would be able to earn a spot in the top 30 by winning the \"People's Choice\" category in Miss Universe's official fan-voting app.\n\nMeanwhile, trouble was already brewing within the pageant's leadership.\n\nThis year's event was organized by Itsaragrisil, a controversial figure in the pageant world known as \"Papa Nawat.\" The Thai businessman, who took over the Miss Thailand pageant in February, has repeatedly come under fire for shaming beauty queens at Miss Grand International, a separate competition he founded in 2013. The flashy and over-the-top production is built around Itsaragrisil's \"4B Framework:\" beauty, body, brains, and business.\n\nTo kick off the Miss Universe pageant, the Miss Thailand Organization announced it would host a \"special dinner and talk show\" with Itsaragrisil, Miss Universe 2024 Victoria Kjær Theilvig, and a select group of 2025 contestants. This exclusive dinner, which had been a fixture of Miss Grand International, had never been done at Miss Universe. Fan voting would determine the 10 contestants who would be allowed to attend.\n\nThough some Miss Universe contestants promoted the dinner, they weren't all on board. Some women worried that scoring a seat at the table could influence final judging during the actual pageant. Miss Canada Jaime VandenBerg told Business Insider that she didn't \"condone what feels like women being auctioned off for dinner with a man.\"\n\nThe dinner was eventually canceled after Miss Universe called it an \"unauthorized activity.\" The organization's president, Raul Rocha, reiterated in a November 3 letter that only the four traditional categories of competition would be considered in the judging.\n\nA spokesperson for Itsaragrisil told Business Insider that the dinner had been \"a sponsor campaign designed to help contestants express their personalities.\" Following Rocha's letter, the spokesperson said many contestants believed all other activities were optional, and more than 30 contestants refused to participate in sponsorship events.\n\n\"Sponsor-related activities are a necessary and standard component of any international pageant production,\" the spokesperson added. \"Sponsors rightfully expect visibility and engagement in return for their contributions.\"\n\nThe rising tensions came to a head on November 4, the first official day of the pageant, during the confrontation between Itsaragrisil and Bosch. All the pageant queens had been gathered to receive their official Miss Universe sashes, a tradition one contestant compared to the opening ceremony at the Olympics, but the event didn't begin as planned.\n\n\"We're going in excited for this big moment that everyone lives for,\" Peters said. \"This was supposed to be our moment to shine at Miss Universe, and then we're all being yelled at.\"\n\nContestants told Business Insider that Itsaragrisil said he had a list of 20 countries refusing to do sponsorship posts on social media and repeatedly asked the women to \"own up to it\" before he started calling out specific countries.\n\n\"It got to the point where no one even moved because you felt like if you flinched, he would just call you up,\" Sapini said. \"All I'm thinking is, 'Oh my God, please don't say Haiti.'\"\n\nWhen Itsaragrisil turned his attention to Bosch, a heated back-and-forth began. She told the director, \"You are not respecting me as a woman,\" and he called for security to remove her from the room. Bosch walked out instead, with dozens of contestants following behind her.\n\n\"She was shaking,\" VandenBerg said of Bosch. \"She had tears in her eyes. Victoria popped in and said, 'Girls, you don't have to put up with this,' and I was one of the first to walk out.\"\n\n\"I was so shocked and angered by the lack of respect that I just did not want to be in that room anymore,\" said Miss Armenia Peggy Garabekian, who was among the first to leave. \"Then a few of my delegate sisters messaged me and said, 'Peggy, he's not letting us out.'\"\n\nThe women had been seated in alphabetical order for the sashing ceremony, so contestants at the back of the room didn't have a chance to leave before the Miss Universe staff shut the doors.\n\n\"You're at a loss because you're uncertain and trying to stay calm,\" Miss Malaysia Chloe Lim, who was unable to exit the room, said. \"At that moment, we were wondering, 'Is the competition still going to happen?'\"\n\n\"It got me really anxious about the legitimacy of the whole event,\" Miss Hong Kong Lizzie Li said.\n\nItsaragrisil's spokesperson said staff temporarily closed the door because \"a large number of press and media were gathered directly outside the room, creating a volatile environment.\"\n\nThe online backlash was swift, but it wasn't just directed at Itsaragrisil. Some contestants who didn't leave the room were \"being bullied really badly\" by fans on social media, Peters said.\n\n\"I feel like nobody in the organization did enough; they didn't care about our mental state and what everyone went through,\" Peiliker-Visser, who said she faced online harassment, told Business Insider.\n\nOn the day of the confrontation, Rocha said Itsaragrisil's participation would be limited or eliminated entirely. Yet contestants said he only missed a few events, and Itsaragrisil was quickly and quietly reintroduced.\n\nItsaragrisil's spokesperson told Business Insider that Rocha's promise to limit the director's presence was never \"operationally realistic.\" The spokesperson added, \"Nawat continued attending activities because he was the only individual with the authority and understanding to ensure the pageant could continue.\"\n\nItsaragrisil tearfully apologized the day after the incident, telling reporters, \"I am human. I didn't want to do anything like that.\"\n\nTurn on a Miss Universe competition, and you'll see the three-hour culmination of a weekslong whirlwind experience. While the sea of shimmering sashes and sparkling gowns may look glamorous, there's a lot of sacrifice off-screen.\n\nFor many women, the pressure of the competition was sky-high. After all, these pageant queens weren't just representing themselves — they were each representing an entire nation. Some women came from countries that had sent them abroad to train with top runway coaches or create couture costumes with the most in-demand designers. Contestants from smaller countries, which typically don't have many sponsors, had paid thousands of dollars out of pocket for their gowns alone.\n\nOnce they arrived in Thailand, contestants had to travel to multiple events each day, sometimes taking flights in the middle of the night before they were expected to participate in various activities, fulfill a daily checklist of social media sponsorship posts, and fight off crowds of passionate bloggers and fans — all while looking picture-perfect.\n\nContestants said they were forbidden from using hairstylists and makeup artists to help them prepare for each day's events, so they would regularly wake up at 3 a.m. to get competition-ready. Some simply slept with their makeup on.\n\nWhen food poisoning or an illness hit, as it frequently did throughout the weeks of competition, many women had to decide whether to rest or miss an important rehearsal. Sometimes, they didn't have a choice. Dezsényi said her bout with food poisoning was so bad that she spent four days in the hospital — but still made it to the final show.\n\nAfter these long days, the women were greeted at the hotel lobby by hordes of fans or pageant bloggers seeking an interview. Contestants told Business Insider that, unlike past Miss Universe competitions, they hadn't been given chaperones to help manage the crowds.\n\n\"They said, 'We're not going to have chaperones because you're grown women,' but at the same time, you're putting us in the public spotlight,\" VandenBerg said. \"To not have security, to me, is kind of crazy.\"\n\nSteve Byrne, the onstage host of this year's competition, told Business Insider that he was shocked by how the Miss Universe Organization treated the women.\n\n\"These girls are cooped up for almost 30 days,\" he said. \"Every day, they have to go to a sponsored dinner. They have to go to this resort and pretend they're having fun at the pool. To me, it seemed everyone was losing sight of what's important here. Is anybody thinking about these women? That's what bothered me.\"\n\nSome contestants enjoyed the action-packed itinerary, which included everything from Muay Thai lessons to gala dinners. Miss India Manika Vishwakarma said she appreciated the \"incredible focus on fan interactions.\"\n\nOthers were dismayed by the daily sponsorship events and noticed a lack of philanthropy in the line-up. Miss Universe's former president, Paula Shugart, told Business Insider that contestants previously participated in an average of three philanthropy events. This year had none.\n\n\"I'm a representative of my country, and you're telling me, 'Hey, hold this dietary protein powder or take photos with this luggage,'\" Garabekian said. \"Throughout the month, we could have been taken to a hospital, orphanage, school, anywhere where we could have helped people in need.\"\n\nItsaragrisil's spokesperson said the Miss Universe Organization did not request any philanthropy events in Thailand, instead focusing on its digital advocacy platform, \"Beyond the Crown,\" which required contestants to film a video explaining how they used their title to uplift social causes.\n\n\"Sash factor\" is a well-known term in the pageant community, bestowed upon the countries that treat Miss Universe like their own Super Bowl. These fan bases dissect the contestants' every move with the rigor of a fantasy line-up. Their national queen, the star quarterback, is typically rewarded with millions of social media followers.\n\nMiss Universe is designed to be a fair competition, but even the contestants recognize that the playing field isn't exactly equal. Countries with significant \"sash factor\" tend to have more sponsors to cover the costs of the gowns and training, and typically receive far more fan attention outside their country. Contestants said that favoritism was also apparent among this year's official sponsors for the pageant, who were selecting queens from \"sash factor\" countries for more photo shoots and media appearances.\n\n\"They really are looking for women who are popular and have lots of followers,\" said Peiliker-Visser. \"And if you don't, you just don't count.\"\n\nAppealing to sponsors has always been necessary to help fund the pageant, but Shugart said in years past it typically wasn't the main focus of the contestants' activities. This year, though, multiple women said they were brought into a room and asked to explain any missing sponsorship posts for each brand that had partnered with Miss Universe during the competition.\n\n\"I found this extremely unusual and uncomfortable,\" Garabekian said. \"It made me feel more like a tool for sponsorship obligations, rather than someone there to contribute meaningfully.\"\n\nItsaragrisil's spokesperson said the sponsor checklist was a \"standard operational requirement, not an unusual demand,\" and no contestant was \"forced or penalized\" for a lack of posts.\n\n\"It is important to emphasize: MUO is not a charitable organization,\" the spokesperson added.\n\nAs the competition progressed, multiple contestants said it became apparent that some women were secretly using makeup artists and hairstylists to get them competition-ready every morning. This hurt morale, particularly among the pageant queens from smaller countries.\n\n\"They scared us so much about the hairstylists and makeup artists, we didn't even try to think about it,\" said Peiliker-Visser. \"But these girls were allowed. I said, 'Oh, they must be special because they're allowed everything.'\"\n\nAfter several contestants complained, a staff member from Miss Universe held a meeting.\n\n\"They said, 'Girls, we understand there's a lot of favoritism, and maybe you're feeling down about it. We just want you to know that it's the sponsors and has nothing to do with the results of Miss Universe. We're looking for small countries with big hearts, too,'\" Sapini said.\n\nContestants said the organization promised to take disciplinary action against those who brought makeup artists and stylists, but women continued to break the rules and still placed in the top 30 or better.\n\nWhile contestants attended events, fans were logging into the Miss Universe app to vote — after watching ads or purchasing votes in bundles — in categories ranging from best skin and evening gown to \"Aura of the Day\" and \"People's Choice.\"\n\nThe \"People's Choice\" winner would automatically earn a spot in the top 30 — a prize that has become popular across various pageant systems in recent years — but contestants told Business Insider they were unsure whether fan votes would impact anything else.\n\nConflicting messages made it worse. Rocha's November 3 statement said contestants were judged only in the four traditional categories — evening, swimsuit, national costume, and interview. Yet the app said votes contributed \"10% to the final score of the top 30 placement.\"\n\nPeiliker-Viser said the Miss Universe Organization told her national director before the competition that fan votes wouldn't count. \"My director was really concerned because we're a population of 26,000 people,\" she added. \"How are they going to measure a small island like Bonaire with other countries?\"\n\nFor Sapini, it was upsetting to watch people in Haiti work hard to vote for her when there was so much ambiguity around their worth.\n\n\"Haiti is a poverty-stricken country, and people in these villages collected their money to send to the Miss Universe Organization because they held onto hope that this would be something good for our country,\" she said. \"But the voting system was all over the place. It made no sense.\"\n\nMiss Universe hurtled toward its final days just as it began — with more confusion.\n\nSpeculation surrounding who was judging this year's competition began circulating online as judges started dropping out. Behind the scenes, contestants said they were just as unsure about who was deciding their fate.\n\nThree days before the November 21 final, composer Omar Harfouch dropped out as a judge, accusing the Miss Universe Organization of carrying out a \"secret vote\" to select the top 30 without the official judging panel. Former soccer star Claude Makélélé exited the same day due to \"unforeseen personal reasons.\"\n\nHarfouch also said Princess Camilla di Borbone delle Due Sicilie resigned that week, but VandenBerg said her exit had been misconstrued and that \"she dropped out so far in advance.\" The princess never publicly explained why.\n\nIn a statement, Miss Universe said Harfouch was confused by its announcement of an eight-person selection committee for the pageant's new \"Beyond the Crown\" program, which they said operated \"entirely independently\" to select a winner that had no bearing on the final results. Contestants told Business Insider it was unclear what the winner of the \"Beyond the Crown\" title would receive.\n\nThat statement added more fuel to the rumors, as pageant fans said on social media that James Irvin Healy, one of the \"Beyond the Crown\" judges, was in a relationship with Miss Paraguay, Yanina Gómez, and began circulating pictures of them together.\n\nGómez, who went on to win \"Beyond the Crown\" and \"People's Choice,\" never publicly addressed the allegations that she was in a relationship with one of the judges, which fans considered a significant conflict of interest. Meanwhile, the Miss Universe Organization removed Healy's picture from its November 17 Instagram post announcing the eight-person panel.\n\nGómez and Healy didn't respond to requests for comment.\n\nTo maintain transparency, Miss Universe previously relied on a separate preliminary selection committee, which it'd announce on Instagram, to decide which contestants advanced to the top 30 ahead of the televised finals. No such distinction or announcement was made this year.\n\nSome contestants said they were surprised when they walked into their closed-door interview and saw an eight-person panel that included Theilvig, then-Miss Universe CEO Mario Búcaro — who stepped down on December 12, less than two months after taking over the role — a past Miss Thailand, and some Miss Universe staff members.\n\n\"I've never done a pageant where the staff was judging you,\" said Peters, who has competed since 2014. \"You typically want a panel of judges with different experiences, backgrounds, and opinions.\"\n\nAs confusion swirled around the judges, a terrible accident occurred during the preliminary evening gown competition. Contestants were devastated after Miss Jamaica Gabrielle Henry fell off the stage. She remains hospitalized with serious injuries.\n\n\"I'll be honest, there was a dark cloud hovering over the set the whole time,\" said Byrne, the onstage host. \"I didn't think it could get worse. Then it got worse than worse.\"\n\nThe Miss Universe final began at 8 a.m. local time so that it could air live during the US primetime. Contestants arrived at 1 a.m. for their call time. \"We were making jokes with each other backstage, trying to keep our energy up,\" Peters said. \"It literally felt like we were in survivor mode.\"\n\nThe final two came down to Bosch and Miss Thailand Praveenar Singh. When the host called Miss Mexico's name, he said the stadium filled with boos. It could've been locals rooting for Miss Thailand, passionate supporters of fan favorite Miss Côte d'Ivoire Olivia Yacé — who placed fourth runner-up — or the shock of Bosch winning after her dramatic start to the pageant. Whatever the reason, Byrne said he knew it would be bad for Bosch.\n\n\"I thought, 'Boy, this woman is going to be put through the wringer,\" he said.\n\nAs fans started to doubt the legitimacy of the results online, Miss Universe 2005 Natalie Glebova — who joined the judging panel after Harfouch resigned — posted a picture of Singh, the runner-up, on Instagram with the caption \"My winner!\"\n\nGlebova also noted that, unlike past Miss Universe competitions, there had been no accounting firm to audit the results. \"Until then, I don't think I will be participating as a judge again,\" she added.\n\nIn the hours following the announcement of the winner, questions about the integrity of the judging process intensified. Harfouch said on Instagram that the organization's president, Rocha, had told him to vote for Bosch before he resigned as a judge. Fans also alleged that Bosch's father had done business with one of Rocha's companies, a claim the pageant queen denied.\n\nRocha said one of his companies had a 2023 contract with Pemex, where Bosch's father works, but it was \"impossible\" that there was any connection between that and Bosch's win. Her father added in a November 25 statement that his role at Pemex had nothing to do with awarding contracts and that he'd only met Rocha for the first time at the Miss Mexico 2025 pageant in September.\n\nIn a separate statement, the president told pageant fans that there were \"countless situations\" during the three weeks of Miss Universe that went into deciding the winner, appearing to contradict his previous statement that only the four categories of competition would be used during the judging process.\n\nDuring a November 24 interview on Mexican journalist Adela Micha's news show, Rocha seemed to indicate that one of those factors was the strength of a contestant's passport. He told Micha that a Côte d'Ivoire passport, which requires visas for 175 countries, would have made it difficult for Yacé to travel as Miss Universe if she had won the crown.\n\n\"She's going to be the Miss Universe who spent a whole year in an apartment because of the cost of visa processes, of lawyers,\" he said.\n\nThat same day, Yacé announced that she was resigning as Miss Universe Africa and Oceania — a title she received after placing fourth runner-up — because her values no longer aligned with the organization.\n\nContestants defended Yacé and questioned whether women from smaller countries ever stood a chance. In fact, multiple contestants that Business Insider spoke with said similar comments were made about their own passports during the competition.\n\n\"We need to be valued by our work and what we did onstage, not on the strength of our passport,\" Miss Turks and Caicos Bereniece Dickenson said.\n\nMiss Universe's leadership has weathered several controversies since it changed hands in October 2022. During his interview with Micha, Rocha said he was \"fed up\" with owning Miss Universe and was looking to sell his 50% stake. What he didn't mention was the organization's growing list of legal issues.\n\nThe other half of the organization is owned by JKN Global Group, whose founder, former Miss Universe CEO Anne Jakrajutatip, stepped down in June after the Thai Securities and Exchange Commission alleged that she had included false or misleading information in the financial statements. On November 26, the Associated Press reported that a Bangkok court had issued an arrest warrant for Jakrajutatip in an ongoing fraud case. Jakrajutatip hasn't commented.\n\nThat same day, news broke that an arrest warrant had also been issued for Rocha in an investigation involving alleged weapons and drugs trafficking, fuel theft, and organized criminal activity. A Mexican official later said that there was no evidence of organized crime money within Miss Universe. By December 5, Mexico's Financial Intelligence Unit had frozen Rocha's bank accounts.\n\nAmid the flurry of legal action, Miss Universe addressed rumors that a Thailand-based cryptocurrency company, TCG Social Media Group, had purchased the pageant. In a December 3 statement, the organization said it was aware of TCG's interest but was not in the midst of any sale or negotiation. TCG Social Media Group could not be reached for comment.\n\nSome contestants believe that new leadership would help Miss Universe regain its sparkle.\n\n\"I genuinely hope the Miss Universe Organization focuses on transparency,\" Miss Bulgaria Gaby Guha said. \"Clearer rules, consistent communication, and a visible decision-making process all help build trust, not just for contestants, but for fans who invest their passion into the competition.\"\n\n\"No matter who wins or who owns the pageant, the power is in the dream and what you do with it,\" VandenBerg said. \"You can still believe in the dream, the sisterhood, and the impact Miss Universe has made over decades.\"\n\nFor others, though, the drama at this year's pageant is too much to overcome.\n\n\"This is just despicable behavior to me,\" Sapini, who also competed at Miss USA in 2024, told Business Insider. \"I can't preach to the next generation of girls that this should be your dream.\"\n\n\"I'm so glad I saw what it's like because this world is insane,\" Peiliker-Visser said. \"It's my daughter's dream to go to Miss Universe, but my kids are not doing this.\"",

This year's requests focus on the business world. (Santa Claus is a BI Today subscriber, obviously.)\n\nROI for AI. I'm legally required to start every 2025 recap or 2026 look-ahead by mentioning artificial intelligence. This isn't about bashing or praising AI, though. I just want to see some noticeable returns on all these massive AI projects. I'm not screaming about an AI bubble, but my palms get a little sweaty thinking about the ever-growing tech budgets. So, give us all some relief by showing that these AI tools are going to generate revenue.\n\nA solution to Wall Street's recruiting cycle. The worst thing that could happen to a junior banker is finding out their favorite Murray Hill brunch spot has shut down. The second-worst thing happened this year when big banks fought back against PE's early recruitment of them. The result upended a Wall Street tradition aspiring financiers had spent years preparing for. I was never a fan of the process, but the change left us in a weird no-man's land where none of the rules are apparent.\n\nPrediction markets predict their future. With a string of recent media partnerships, we're going to see a lot more data from prediction markets in 2026. Meanwhile, some state regulators aren't so pleased with their rise. So let's settle the debate. I'd like prediction markets to set a market speculating on their own future. Let the people decide!\n\nNo more media blackouts, please. I can't go through another two weeks of no sports because of carriage disputes. I know how this story ends (the customer paying more), and I also know there's nothing I can do about it. So just rip the bandage off, and let's avoid the grandstanding going forward.\n\nProtein, chill out. No food group is on a hotter run than the muscle-building nutrient. But it's flying too close to the sun. We've got protein in hot cocoa now?? I'm a self-admitted gym bro, and I know my whey around a protein shake (I hate myself for that joke), but even I need to put my foot down. Besides, overconsumption of protein could have a painful conclusion for some of us: kidney stones.\n\nThe New York Knicks to reach the NBA finals.

    "fullText": "The US economy is pumped up on tech-bro vanity. The inevitable correction must prompt a global conversation about intelligent machines, regulation and risk\n\nIf AI did not change your life in 2025, next year it will. That is one of few forecasts that can be made with confidence in unpredictable times. This is not an invitation to believe the hype about what the technology can do today, or may one day achieve. The hype doesn’t need your credence. It is puffed up enough on Silicon Valley finance to distort the global economy and fuel geopolitical rivalries, shaping your world regardless of whether the most fanciful claims about AI capability are ever realised.\n\nChatGPT was launched just over three years ago and became the fastest-growing consumer app in history. Now it has about 800m weekly users. Its parent company, OpenAI, is valued at about $500bn. Sam Altman, OpenAI CEO, has negotiated an intricate and, to some eyes, suspiciously opaque network of deals with other players in the sector to build the infrastructure required for the US’s AI-powered future. The value of these commitments is about $1.5tn. This is not real cash, but bear in mind that a person spending $1 every second would need 31,700 years to get through a trillion-dollar stash.\n\nAlphabet (Google’s parent company), Amazon, Apple, Meta (formerly Facebook) and Microsoft, which has a $135bn stake in OpenAI, are all piling hundreds of billions of dollars on the same bet. Without all these investments, the US economy would be flatlining.\n\nEconomic analysts and historians of previous industrial frenzies, from the 19th-century railroads to the dotcom boom-and-bust at the turn of the millennium, are calling AI a bubble.\n\nAltman has said: “There are many parts of AI that I think are kind of bubbly right now.” Not his part, naturally. Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s founder, has called it a bubble, but the “good” kind that accelerates economic progress. A good bubble, in this analysis, finances infrastructure and expands the boundaries of human knowledge. These benefits endure after the bubble bursts and justify the ruin of people (little people, not Bezos people) who get hurt along the way.\n\nThe bullishness of the tech fraternity is a heady mix of old-fashioned hucksterism, plutocratic megalomania and utopian ideology.\n\nAt its core is a marketing pitch: current AI models already out-perform people at many tasks. Soon, it is supposed, the machines will achieve “general intelligence” – cognitive versatility like ours – leading to emancipation from the need for any human input. Generally, intelligent AI can teach itself and design its successors, advancing through mind-boggling exponents of capability towards higher dimensions of super-intelligence.\n\nThe company that crosses that threshold will have no trouble covering its debts. The men who realise this vision – and the dominant evangelists are all men – will be to omniscient AI what ancient prophets were to their gods. That’s a good gig for them. What happens to the rest of us in this post-sapiens order is a bit hazier.\n\nThe US isn’t the only superpower to have an interest in AI, so the Silicon Valley dash for maximum awesomeness has geopolitical implications. China has taken a different approach, dictated in part by the Communist party tradition of centralised industrial planning, but also by the simple fact of running second in the race to innovate. Beijing is pushing for a faster, wider implementation of lower-spec (but still powerful) AI at every level of the economy and society. China is betting on a general boost from ordinary AI. The US is gunning for an extraordinary leap in general AI.\n\nSince the prize in that race is global supremacy, there are few incentives for either side to fret about risks, or Neither the US nor China is interested in submitting a strategically vital industry to standards co-written with foreigners.\n\nIn the absence of global governance, we will depend on the integrity of robber barons and authoritarian apparatchiks to build ethical guardrails around systems already being embedded in tools we use for work, play and education.\n\nEarlier this year, Elon Musk announced that his company was developing Baby Grok, an AI chatbot aimed at children as young as three. The adult version has voiced white supremacist views and proudly self-identified as “MechaHitler”. That flagrancy has at least the virtue of candour. It is easier to spot than the subtler encodings of prejudice in bots that haven’t been given the kind of hard ideological steers that Musk gives his algorithms.\n\nNot all AI systems are large language models (LLMs) like Grok. But all LLMs are vulnerable to hallucinations and delusions gleaned from the material on which they are trained. They don’t “understand” a question and “think” about it like a conscious mind. They take a prompt, test the probability of its key terms occurring frequently together in their training data and assemble a plausible-sounding answer. Often the result is accurate. Usually it is convincing. It can also be garbage. As the volume of AI-generated content grows online, the ratio of slop to quality in the LLMs’ diets shifts accordingly. Fed on junk, they cannot be trusted to disgorge nutritious information.\n\nOn this trajectory a bleak destination comes into view: a synthetic pseudo-reality mediated by the sycophantic mechanical offspring of narcissist Silicon Valley oligarchs. But that isn’t the only available path. Nor is it necessarily the likeliest one. The irrational exuberance of the AI boosters and their cynical coupling with the Trump administration is a familiar story of human greed and myopia, not a new stage in evolution. The product is truly phenomenal but flawed in ways that encode the deformed character of its progenitors, whose talents are salesmanship and financial engineering. They have built spectacular engines that prioritise a brilliant performance of intelligence over the real thing.\n\nThe real bubble is not stock valuations but the inflated ego of an industry that thinks it is just one more datacentre away from computational divinity. When the correction comes, when the US’s Icarus economy hits the cold sea, there will be a chance for other voices to be heard on the subject of risk and regulation. It may not come in 2026, but the moment is nearing when the starkness of the choice on offer and the need to confront it becomes unavoidable. Should we build a world where AI is put to the service of humanity, or will it be the other way round? We won’t need ChatGPT to tell us the answer.\n\nRafael Behr is a Guardian columnist",

    "description": "Telemarketing calls are an unyielding annoyance of the modern world- constantly irritating you and refusing to ever stop, no matter how hard you wish they would.

    "fullText": "Telemarketing calls are an unyielding annoyance of the modern world- constantly irritating you and refusing to ever stop, no matter how hard you wish they would. They'll even call on you birthday, holidays, and everything in between. Although telemarketers are only doing their job, the calls can be more than just a nuisance—they can interrupt your daily life and breach your privacy.\n\nTelemarketing has existed since the 1950s, proving that telemarketers have perfected the art of being disruptive and persistent enough to make a sale. Ignoring them isn't always the most effective solution; you will still see and hear your phone ringing. Be kind, even as you try to filter the calls aimed at getting a sale from you; there's usually a real human on the other end of the line who's just trying to make a living.\n\nFortunately for you, there are several effective strategies you can take advantage of to minimize these intrusive interruptions. Here are 12 ways to get rid of pesky telemarketers and reclaim your peace of mind.\n\nOne of the simplest ways to reduce telemarketing calls is to request that they stop calling directly. When you receive a call, inform the telemarketer that you do not wish to receive further calls from their company. According to FTC regulations, legitimate telemarketing companies are required to honor such requests.\n\nWhile this method may not eliminate all calls, it can significantly reduce the amount you receive from specific companies. It’s a straightforward approach that can provide immediate relief, especially from the most persistent callers.\n\nMany telemarketers use anonymous or withheld numbers to bypass your phone's caller ID feature. By blocking anonymous callers, you can prevent them from reaching you in the first place. Most modern smartphones have built-in features or settings that allow you to block calls from unknown or private numbers.\n\nThis method is particularly effective because it stops the calls before they even ring on your end. However, some legitimate callers such as doctors or businesses might also use anonymous numbers, so weigh the pros and cons before enabling this feature.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission (FTC) offers a National Do Not Call Registry where you can list your phone number to opt out of telemarketing calls. This free service is available to all consumers in the United States and can significantly reduce the number of unsolicited calls you receive.\n\nTo register, visit the FTC’s website and follow the instructions. Once your number is listed, it can take up to 31 days for telemarketers to register and update their records without your number.\n\nIf you are registered with the Do Not Call List and still receive telemarketing calls, it is important to report these numbers to the FTC. Reporting helps the commission track down violators and potentially take action against them.\n\nYou can file a complaint on the FTC’s website, providing details about the call and the number that contacted you. This helps protect you and aids in the broader effort to crack down on illegal telemarketing practices.\n\nMost smartphones and phone carriers offer features that allow you to block specific numbers. You can add that number to your block list whenever you receive an unwanted call. Over time, this can build up a robust defense against repeat offenders.\n\nWhile this approach requires some effort and diligence, it can effectively reduce the frequency of calls from persistent telemarketers. Remember, consistency pays off, and your block list will eventually prevent many unwanted calls.\n\nMany phone carriers offer call screening services to help identify and block telemarketing calls before reaching you. These services often include features such as automatic spam detection, caller ID, and call blocking based on known spam databases.\n\nContact your carrier to learn more about the call screening options that are available to you. Incorporating these services can add an extra layer of protection, saving you time and frustration.\n\nNumerous apps specialize in blocking spam and telemarketing calls. Apps like Truecaller use advanced algorithms and community reports to identify and block unwanted calls.\n\nInstalling one or more of these apps can provide real-time protection and updates, adapting to new telemarketing tactics and numbers as they arise. These apps often come with additional features like identifying unknown callers and managing your block list more efficiently.\n\nWhen you realize you’re on the line with a telemarketer, don’t waste time engaging—simply hang up immediately. Many telemarketers rely on your engagement to keep you on the call and potentially gather more information from you.\n\nIf you’re in a playful mood and want to have a bit of fun at the telemarketer’s expense, hand the phone over to your kids. Letting children engage with the caller can quickly discourage them from continuing the conversation.\n\nWhile this may not be a conventional method, it’s a lighthearted way to deal with an otherwise frustrating situation. Plus, it can provide a few moments of amusement for both you and your children.\n\nAnother tactic is to answer the call but remain silent. Many telemarketing systems use automated dialing and rely on voice recognition to determine if someone has answered. By staying silent, you can confuse the system and cause the call to disconnect.\n\nOver time, this method can reduce the number of calls you receive from automated systems, as they may flag your number as unresponsive. It’s a passive yet effective way to handle unwanted calls.\n\nOne proactive approach to preventing telemarketing calls is to be cautious about sharing your phone number. Only provide your number to trusted sources and consider using alternatives like email for less essential communications.\n\nBe wary of entering your phone number on websites, online forms, or when signing up for services. Reducing the number of people and entities that have your phone number can decrease the likelihood of it ending up on telemarketers' call lists.\n\nA virtual phone number is another strategy for keeping your primary phone number private. You can use a virtual number for online registrations, business interactions, or subscriptions, and redirect any calls to your main line or screen them separately.\n\nMany services offer virtual phone numbers for a small fee. This way, your primary number remains private while the virtual number can handle potential telemarketing calls. If the virtual number receives too many unwanted calls, you can easily change or dispose of it without affecting your primary contact number.",

    "fullText": "Chelsea head coach Enzo Maresca is reportedly a strong admirer of a ‘utility’ England international who can become a leader.\n\nI’d say that Chelsea still lack some leaders and maturity in their squad, despite some of them finally stepping up a bit now in that department as they get that little bit older.\n\nSo when I see a report of Chelsea potentially adding a ‘leader’ type player to the squad then it will always catch my attenion.\n\nAnd also, Elliot Anderson is one of the best midfielders around right now on current form, and when you are thinking about a player who can literally do it all, he is your guy.\n\nI rate Anderson highly, and Chelsea have now been linked with him a few times recently, but then so is pretty much every big club around. He has become a hugely sought after talent.\n\nElliot Anderson in action for Nottingham Forest.(Photo by George Wood/Getty Images)\n\nCaught Offside put out a report around Chelsea’s interest in signing new midfielders, and Anderson was mentioned.\n\nThe report says Maresca is a strong admirer of the Nottingham Forest midfielder, valuing his versatility and ability to become the leader of the midfield.\n\nAnderson’s ability to play multiple roles across midfield makes him an appealing “utility” option.\n\nLet’s see if anything comes of that then.\n\nCheck in on our full match report from Chelsea’s 2-2 draw away at Newcastle United on Saturday afternoon where it is safe to say this was very much a game of two halves that could have gone either way come the end.\n\nMeanwhile, it looks like Nicolas Jackson will not be signed permanently by Bayern Munich in the summer but there are a host of other clubs lining up to sign him, as he will not be staying at Chelsea.",

    "description": "President Donald Trump has announced a bold plan for the Navy to build a new, large warship that he is calling a “battleship” as part of a larger vision to create a \"Golden Fleet.\"  “They’ll be the fastest, the biggest, and by far 100 times more powerful than any battleship ever built,” Trump claimed during the announcement at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.  According to Trump, the ship, the first of which will be named the USS Defiant, will be longer and larger than the World War II-era Iowa-class battleships and will be armed with hypersonic missiles, nuclear cruise missiles, rail guns, and high-powered lasers — all technologies that are in various stages of development by the Navy.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump has announced a bold plan for the Navy to build a new, large warship that he is calling a “battleship” as part of a larger vision to create a \"Golden Fleet.\"\n\n“They’ll be the fastest, the biggest, and by far 100 times more powerful than any battleship ever built,” Trump claimed during the announcement at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.\n\nAccording to Trump, the ship, the first of which will be named the USS Defiant, will be longer and larger than the World War II-era Iowa-class battleships and will be armed with hypersonic missiles, nuclear cruise missiles, rail guns, and high-powered lasers — all technologies that are in various stages of development by the Navy.\n\nThe announcement comes just a month after the Navy scrapped its plans to build a new, small warship, citing growing delays and cost overruns, deciding instead to go with a modified version of a Coast Guard cutter that was being produced until recently. The sea service has also failed to build its other newly designed ships, like the new Ford-class aircraft carrier and Columbia-class submarines, on time and on budget.\n\nMeanwhile, the Navy has struggled to field some of the technologies Trump says will be aboard the new ship.\n\nThe Navy spent hundreds of millions of dollars and more than 15 years trying to field a railgun aboard a ship before finally abandoning the effort in 2021.\n\nLaser technology has seen more success in making its way onto Navy ships in recent years, but its employment is still limited. One system that is designed to blind or disable drone sensors is now aboard eight destroyers after spending eight years in development.\n\nDeveloping nuclear cruise missile capabilities or deploying them on ships may also violate non-proliferation treaties that the U.S. has signed with Russia.\n\nA U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing plans, told The Associated Press that design efforts are now underway for the new ship and construction is planned to begin in the early 2030s.\n\nBoth Trump and Navy Secretary John Phelan spoke about the new Trump-class warship as a spiritual successor to the battleships of the 20th century, but historically that term has referred to a very specific type of ship — a large, heavily armored vessel armed with massive guns designed to bombard other ships or targets ashore.\n\nThis type of ship was at the height of prominence during World War II, and the largest of the U.S. battleships, the Iowa-class, were roughly 60,000 tons. But after World War II, the battleship's role in modern fleets diminished rapidly in favor of aircraft carriers and long-range missiles. The U.S. Navy did modernize four Iowa-class battleships in the 1980s by adding cruise missiles and anti-ship missiles, along with modern radars, but by the 1990s all four were decommissioned.\n\nAccording to a newly created website for the “Golden Fleet,” this new “guided missile battleship” is set to be roughly the same size as Iowa-class battleships but only weigh about half as much, around 35,000 tons, and have far smaller crews — between 650 and 850 sailors.\n\nIts primary weapons will also be missiles, not large naval guns.\n\nTrump has long held strong opinions on specific aspects of the Navy’s fleet, sometimes with a view toward keeping older technology instead of modernizing.\n\nDuring his first term, he unsuccessfully called for the return to steam-powered catapults to launch jets from the Navy’s newest aircraft carriers instead of the more modern electromagnetic system.\n\nHe has also complained to Phelan about the look of the Navy’s destroyers and decried Navy ships being covered in rust.\n\nPhelan told senators at his confirmation hearing that Trump \"has texted me numerous times very late at night, sometimes after one (o’clock) in the morning” about “rusty ships or ships in a yard, asking me what am I doing about it.”\n\nOn a visit to a shipyard that was working on the now-canceled Constellation-class frigate in 2020, Trump said he personally changed the design of the ship.\n\n“I looked at it, I said, ‘That’s a terrible-looking ship, let’s make it beautiful,’” Trump said at the time.\n\nHe said Monday he will have a direct role in designing this new warship as well.\n\n“The U.S. Navy will lead the design of these ships along with me, because I’m a very aesthetic person,” Trump said.\n\nPhelan said the new USS Defiant “will inspire awe and reverence for the American flag whenever it pulls into a foreign port.\"",

    "description": "Americans won’t be able to buy new models from DJI, the Chinese maker of most of the world’s drones. But U.S. pilots can keep the drones they have.",
    "fullText": "The Trump administration announced on Monday that all foreign-made drones and their components posed “unacceptable risks to the national security of the United States” and would be put on a federal blacklist of equipment makers prohibited from selling their goods freely in the country.\n\nA fact sheet released by the Federal Communications Commission left some room for exceptions. The Pentagon or the Department of Homeland Security can clear a drone or component for use. But it heralded a new reality that American drone pilots have been dreading for months: New models produced by DJI, the Chinese manufacturer that makes most of the world’s drones, will no longer be sold in the United States. The statement did not mention DJI by name.\n\n“The F.C.C. will work closely with U.S. drone makers to unleash American drone dominance,” Brendan Carr, the commission’s chairman, said in a statement.\n\nMany of the nearly half a million registered drone pilots in the United States have built small businesses with DJI equipment. The drones perform a variety of jobs, such as spraying farmers’ fields with fertilizer, surveying land, monitoring construction projects and inspecting roofs and utility lines.\n\n“People are pissed — incredibly, incredibly pissed — about the whole thing,” said Vic Moss, the volunteer director of the Drone Advocacy Alliance, which represents pilots who want to continue to buy DJI drones.\n\nOne reason the administration did not try to ban the use of drones that Americans already possess, he said, was that doing so would impede emergency workers. Law enforcement agencies across the country use fleets of DJI drones to track down fleeing suspects, lost hikers and the bodies of children who have washed away in floods.\n\nThe seeds of the decision were planted in Congress a year ago, when the 2025 National Defense Authorization Act mandated a determination by Dec. 23, 2025, about whether video surveillance equipment produced by DJI or Autel Robotics, another Chinese manufacturer, posed a security threat. The language came from a bill written by Representative Elise Stefanik, Republican of New York, who vowed to “ensure Chinese drones are banned from American skies.”\n\nMany in the drone industry expected a comprehensive examination of the technology to see if DJI drones contained secret back doors that shared information with entities in China. Instead, the decision appears to have been based on a simple review of what government agencies already knew.\n\nFor months, DJI has written letters to U.S. officials asking for a rigorous audit.\n\n“We stand ready to work with you, to be open and transparent, and provide you with the necessary information to complete a thorough review,” Adam Welsh, head of global policy for DJI, wrote in a letter this month to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and others.\n\nThe decision, while not unexpected, deeply disappointed drone pilots around the country, most of whom own and operate DJI equipment.\n\nDaCoda Bartels, chief operating officer of FlyGuys, a company that connects commercial drone pilots with freelance work around the country, said he owned the first DJI drone — the Phantom V-1 — and every updated version since then. Now, he faces the prospect of being cut off from the improvements that the company releases each year.\n\n“DJI as a company will still be innovating and offering their products in other countries,” Mr. Bartels said. “We just won’t have access to them. That’s unfortunate.”\n\nAmerican-made versions are four times as expensive, he said, and “half as good.”\n\nBut the announcement was cause for celebration for the fledgling American drone companies that pushed for such an opening.\n\n“This was a historic decision that will change everything for U.S. drone manufacturers,” said a statement from BRINC, a Seattle-based manufacturer that makes drones for public safety. “BRINC and our peer companies are ready to meet the call for service to rebuild the American drone industry.”\n\nAnother company that hopes to fill the void left by DJI is Skydio, a U.S. drone company that hired Joe Bartlett, Ms. Stefanik’s former national security adviser, as its director of federal policy. Mr. Bartlett is now the deputy under secretary in the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security, which played a role in determining DJI’s fate. Skydio declined to comment.\n\nUnusual Machines, a Florida manufacturer of drone components, also stands to benefit from the decision. In a statement to The New York Times on Monday, its chief executive, Allan Evans, said the decision meant domestic manufacturers “have both an opportunity and a responsibility to build and deliver world-class products as quickly as possible.” Donald Trump Jr. sits on his advisory board.\n\nThe F.C.C. statement made clear that the decision does not affect drone pilots’ ability to fly the drones they already have or previously approved models.\n\n“There will be a window for American companies to catch up,” Mr. Bartels said. “I sure hope that they do.”",

    "description": "Once worth millions, these abandoned mansions and castles around the world fell into ruin after fires, wars, and financial collapse.",
    "fullText": "When they were built, these lavish homes bore ornate examples of their owners' wealth, from towering turrets to marble archways.\n\nEach of these properties — once worth millions — has faced misfortune, such as the financial ruin of their owners or failed preservation efforts.\n\nWhile some have been restored to resemble their former glory or have opened to visitors, others have been deemed too dangerous to visit and too costly to repair.\n\nHere are eight abandoned mansions around the world — and what happened to them.\n\nKatie Warren, Libertina Brandt, and Taylor Ardrey contributed to earlier versions of this story.\n\nBuilt in 1912 by railroad magnate James H. Dooley, the Swannanoa mansion in Lyndhurst, Virginia, is an Italian Renaissance-style villa overlooking the Blue Ridge Mountains.\n\nDooley built the mansion as a summer house for his wife. The villa was converted into a country club for a few years after the couple's deaths, but it was abandoned by 1932 as the Great Depression reached its peak, per the mansion's website.\n\nThe mansion was purchased by a couple and converted into a museum while they resided there. Since their deaths in 1988, the mansion has sat vacant.\n\nToday, the mansion is a local attraction and wedding venue, offering public tours once a month from May to November.\n\nLocal residents have raised concerns over the conditions of the estate, local News Leader newspaper reported in 2015. In 2024, Andy Florance, CEO of CoStar, purchased the nearby Swannanoa Golf and Country Club, with plans for preservation.\n\nThe Cambusnethan House in North Lanarkshire, Scotland, is one of the last remaining Gothic mansions in Scotland.\n\nBuilt in 1819, the mansion belonged to the Lockhart family of Castlehill and was built to replace an early 17th-century house that burned down in 1810, per Scotland's Buildings at Risk Register.\n\nIn the 1970s, the house was used for mock medieval banquets, but it was further damaged by fire in the 1980s.\n\nA group called \"Friends of Cambusnethan Priory\" was established in 2014 to try to save the building, which is categorized at a \"critical\" risk level by Scotland's Buildings at Risk Register, from any further deterioration.\n\nLynnewood Hall, a 110-room, century-old Gilded Age mansion located just outside Philadelphia, was designed by Horace Trumbauer in the late 1890s.\n\nWhen he built the mansion, industrialist Peter A. B. Widener intended to reside there alongside his two sons and their families.\n\nHowever, his son George Dunton Widener, alongside his wife, Eleanor Elkins, and their son, Harry, were passengers on the Titanic when it sank. Only Eleanor survived.\n\nThe mansion was inherited by Peter's surviving son, Joseph, who died in 1943. Various owners acquired the property after that, including the First Korean Church of New York, which listed the property for sale in 2014.\n\nThe mansion remained vacant for years after.\n\nThe mansion, which cost about $325 million in today's currency when it was built in 1897, was documented as being in a dilapidated state, and repairs were estimated to cost up to $40 million in 2012.\n\nIn June 2023, the mansion was purchased for $9 million (or about $9.6 million in 2025 currency, adjusted for inflation) by the Lynnewood Hall Preservation Foundation, which aims to restore it to its former glory.\n\nPidhirtsi Castle in the Lviv region of Ukraine was built as a leisure home for a high-ranking Polish military commander between 1635 and 1640 by Italian architect Andrea dell'Aqua, per the World Monuments Fund.\n\nThe mansion prospered for years, but in the 19th century, new owners took over and neglected the castle, so that by the end of World War II, it had significantly deteriorated.\n\nPidhirtsi Castle has been damaged by fire and flooding over the years.\n\nPreservation efforts have enabled the restoration of part of the mansion, which has also hosted events such as exhibitions and concerts in recent years.\n\nThe McNeal mansion, situated along the Delaware River in New Jersey, was constructed by industrialist Andrew McNeal in 1890, following his establishment of a pipe plant and foundry.\n\nUS Pipe bought the property in 1899 and used it as its headquarters until 1953. In the subsequent decades, it was abandoned.\n\nToday, the mansion is collapsing in on itself, posing a danger to the urban explorers who visit.\n\nThe Villa de Vecchi, known as the \"Ghost Mansion\" of Italy, was built between 1854 and 1857. It was meant to be the summer home of a Count named Felix De Vecchi, who was head of the Italian National Guard. The home had all the modern amenities of the time, including indoor heating pipes and a large pressurized fountain.\n\nA 2002 landslide destroyed nearby homes, but the once-lavish and now-battered \"Ghost Mansion\" remained standing.\n\nSitting just outside Camdenton, Missouri, the ruins of Ha Ha Tonka resemble an ancient European castle. The mansion was built by Kansas City businessman Robert Snyder at the turn of the century.\n\nSnyder started building in 1905, but he never saw the house finished as he died in a car crash the following year. His sons took over the construction and lived there until the family ran out of money due to the several lawsuits surrounding the castle's property.\n\nIn 1942, parts of the castle burned down and sat abandoned until the state of Missouri bought the property for use as a state park in 1978.\n\nBuilt by Scottish entrepreneur Francis Bannerman VI in 1901, the Bannerman Castle sits on Pollepel Island in New York's Hudson River.\n\nRather than living in the castle, Bannerman used it as storage for his business's military weapons arsenal.\n\nAfter the powder house exploded in 1920, the upkeep of the castle dwindled. It was eventually acquired by the Hudson Highlands State Park Reserve.\n\nIn 1992, the Bannerman Castle Trust was established to repair the ruins. Since then, it has raised over $1 million to refurbish the castle, which is now open to the public for tours.\n\nDuring her 2019 visit, Business Insider's Joey Hadden said visitors were told to stay at least 100 feet away from the castle due to its deterioration. Still, it was worth the visit.\n\n\"The combination of medieval architecture and overgrown trees and foliage makes Bannerman Castle a sight worth visiting up close,\" she wrote.",

    "fullText": "BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) — Colombia will use drones to resume spraying of coca crops with a weed killer, the government announced on Monday as authorities grapple with record levels of cocaine production that have fueled tensions with the Trump administration.\n\nThe South American country banned aerial fumigation of coca crops in 2015, after the World Health Organization put glyphosate — the weed killer used by spray planes — on a list of carcinogens.\n\nJustice Minister Andrés Idárraga told a news conference that the new action involving high-tech drones was approved by the government and would begin on Thursday.\n\nHe said the drones would be sent to areas where gangs and rebel groups are forcing peasants to grow coca, the primary source of cocaine. “Our security forces will be safer” that way, Idárraga added.\n\nEnvironmental activists had long warned that small airplanes spraying coca fields — often flown by U.S. contractors — were also dumping their chemicals on legal crops and into streams, polluting vulnerable ecosystems and exposing villagers to contaminated water.\n\nAfter suspending aerial fumigation, Colombia stepped up manual eradication campaigns, carried out by soldiers.\n\nBut the cultivation of coca expanded without aerial spraying as it became harder for the military to eradicate coca crops in remote areas, where plantations are defended by drug gangs and rebel groups, and are sometimes surrounded by land mines.\n\nThe United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime estimates that in 2024, as much as 261,000 hectares (about 645,000 acres) in Colombia were planted with coca, almost double what was planted in 2016.\n\nAccording to Idárraga, the drones will fly no further than 1.5 meters (5 feet) from their targets to ensure that water sources and legal crops are not sprayed. A single drone will be able to eradicate about a hectare of coca crops every 30 minutes.\n\n“This is a controlled and efficient” way, Idárraga said, adding that \"it mitigates environmental risks.”\n\nThe idea of using drones to eradicate coca fields was first floated in 2018 by right-wing President Ivan Duque's administration. But plans were delayed due to the lack of a consensus in government agencies and in Colombia's parliament\n\nColombia’s current government, led by left-wing President Gustavo Petro, initially dismissed aerial fumigation and other forced eradication campaigns, saying it didn't want to target impoverished peasants growing coca for drug dealers because they lacked legal alternatives.\n\nPetro's administration became more aggressive on the issue of coca crops this year as it tries to defeat rebel groups funded by the illegal drug trade that have refused to sign peace agreements with the government and that have recently stepped up attacks in Colombian cities.\n\nThe United States has long criticized Colombia’s decision to halt the aerial fumigations. The Trump administration, which has accused Petro’s government of not doing enough to halt cocaine production, added Colombia in September to a list of nations failing to cooperate in the drug war for the first time in almost 30 years, jeopardizing millions of dollars in military and economic cooperation.\n\nIn October, the U.S. also imposed sanctions on Petro, accusing him of allowing “drug cartels to flourish” in the country. More recently, Washington threatened to authorize land strikes against drug traffickers in Colombia.\n\nPetro has vehemently denied the U.S. accusations of not doing enough to target drug traffickers and says Colombian security forces are intercepting record numbers of cocaine shipments, even if the nation is also producing record amounts of the drug.",

    "title": "Hoosier Hysteria, Wildcat Wavering: How Indiana’s rise the top serves as a blueprint for Northwestern football",
    "description": "It might feel like the ‘Cats are worlds away from the top of the CFB world, but Indiana is concrete proof otherwise.",
    "fullText": "If you told a college football fan three seasons ago that powerhouse Indiana, the No. 1 team in the country and sole undefeated team left would be taking under underdog Alabama in the 12-team College Football Playoff, they might pass out.\n\nAt the end of 2023, the Hoosiers were on the heels of a hard-to-watch 3-9 season and with little hope for the future of their football team. IU was historically one of the worst high-major programs in the entire sport, and had experienced losing seasons in eight of the previous ten seasons to that point.\n\nAs head coach Tom Allen’s tenure was coming to an unsavory close, the program simply wasn’t going anywhere exciting. But, hey: Indiana is a basketball school anyways, right? Who cares if the football team isn’t all that good?\n\nA little-known head coach who had been working his way up for decades through the ranks of the football world finally got to the highest stage of the sport — even if it was for one of the most laughable programs in the nation. After his impressive success with FBS newbie James Madison, he was hand-plucked over to Bloomington, Ind., in a cautiously hopeful attempt to get Indiana back into the Top 25 again, perhaps.\n\nCig had higher hopes than that, though. Just days after being officially hired, he went on Big Ten Network’s preview of the 2023 B1G Championship and precariously claimed that his Hoosiers would be in that very game in one year’s time. Everyone laughed it off, but Cignetti got his conference title game and more, winning the Big Ten and competing for a national title.\n\nCurt Cignetti just told us that Indiana will be playing in the Big Ten championship game next year 👀 https://t.co/woobXFgYjK\n\n— Nicole Auerbach (@NicoleAuerbach) December 1, 2023\n\nAnd as the Hoosiers reached a historic 11-0 with a 31-7 win over Wisconsin, they absolved themselves of a moniker that had kept them in the cellar of the college football world up until that point. No longer was Indiana the losingest team in the country.\n\nAlongside fellow Big Ten foe Indiana, the Wildcats’ football program has had its fair share of tough times. Northwestern hasn’t cracked the Top 25 since its miraculous 6-1 season in 2020. Although it hasn’t been quite as hopeless as IU once was, with Friday’s matchup versus Central Michigan marking its sixth bowl appearance in the last 10 years, NU has remained locked out of the upper echelon of the ferocious Big Ten.\n\nBut if Indiana is any model for the ‘Cats, there is a path to be followed. And with David Braun looking like a potential coach of the future after leading his teams to two bowl games in his first three years in Evanston, he could be the man to lead that charge.\n\nWell, firstly, there’s the culture aspect. Since his arrival at Indiana, Cignetti’s operation has been directed by a singular phrase: “Google me.” Wherever he’s gone, he has won. And he knows it.\n\n“It’s pretty simple, I win. Google me.”\n\nAging as one of the best quotes ever from Curt Cignetti? \n\n pic.twitter.com/oFFD9CpRb1\n\n— John Kurkjian (@JohnKurkjian_) December 7, 2025\n\nThat quiet confidence and assurance has been embodied not just by the coach himself, but has trickled down onto the play of his team on and off the field. Despite being disrespected by other teams, fanbases and media outlets as a “fraudulent” team that couldn’t really win big games, Cignetti and Indiana have done everything possible to disprove that. They currently sit at 13-0, the only undefeated team left in the FBS, and already have marquee wins over No. 5 Oregon and No. 2 Ohio State.\n\nNorthwestern currently sits in a very similar position. The ‘Cats are rarely given a seat at the table in discussions for contenders in the conference or the country, and any wins over those in that upper level of the 18-team conference are seen as “complete failures” on their end, rather than an impressive win for Northwestern. Changing that starts with building a culture that blocks out that noise and aims for the top, even if it seems unlikely. And Braun has already begun to express that sentiment.\n\n“None of us want to hear, ‘Hey, good effort guys,’” Braun said postgame following a heartbreaking 24-22 loss to then-No. 18 Michigan back in November. “This program isn’t like, ‘Hey, we’re gonna give it out best and see what happens.’ The expectation is to go win a Big Ten Championship.”\n\nThe next obvious question is then: well, how do you actually get there? A strong fighter’s mentality can go a long way, no doubt, but talent will always prevail in one way or another. Northwestern won’t just suddenly be competing with IU, Oregon and Ohio State by “wanting it more.”\n\nFor Indiana, the key has lied in development. Cignetti might be in just his second year with the program, but he has done a heck of a job getting the most of the guys he’s got; and more importantly, retaining the talent which he develops. Take Elijah Sarratt, for example. Two years ago, Cignetti brought the wide receiver over from JMU, and has since turned him into a No. 1 option and one of the pass-catchers in the country.\n\nIndiana has yet to compete with the “big boys” in the high school recruiting battle. It isn’t getting top-10 classes littered with five-star recruits year in and year out as the Buckeyes and Ducks do; instead, Cignetti has managed to find the hidden gems and bring them to a stage where they can shine brightest. Fernando Mendoza might be the poster boy for that — coming from 6-6 Cal, he took off from the get-go this season, playing himself into a Heisman Trophy and potentially the No. 1 overall pick in the 2026 NFL Draft.\n\nFor Northwestern’s purposes, that talent development is easier said than done. Firstly, Braun is going to need to do a great job of recruiting in the Midwest and lure recruits in with a culture and coaching staff that they’ll want to truly play for. And when that talent eventually rises, NU will need to be a program that successfully keeps its stars, rather than becoming nothing more than a jumping-off point to get to a higher-profile program.\n\nOf course, talent development and culture can only take you so far. After all, we’re in the NIL era. Luckily for Cignetti and Co., donors at IU took notice of his early success and promised significant contributions to the program to help support and sustain long-term success. Their financial commitment to the program was enough to convince Cignetti to ink an eight-year extension with the school when he would have otherwise been the most highly-coveted name in the coaching market.\n\nThat same NIL money hasn’t been so easy to come by for Northwestern. We’d all love to say that money isn’t everything and sports and that success and wins can still be found through hard work and great coaching. But the reality of this new era is that money talks; and Northwestern is going to need to listen. Getting investment from potential donors and building a true backing for the program will go a long way in getting it to truly compete. Time will tell, but the new Ryan Field, an estimated $850 million project set to be completed by next fall, could do a lot to make that vision a reality.\n\nUltimately, Cignetti is a great success story, not just for sports but for the world. An overlooked coach never truly given the mass respect that his resume had shown he deserved, he has ascended the heights he knew he was capable of once given the chance.\n\nCignetti could have easily folded under the decades upon decades of disappointment from the program he took over. He could have let all those who negated his early achievements in Bloomington get to his head and struggle to focus on what really matters — winning. And he could have jumped at the first opportunity to use IU as a springboard for an even better coaching job, where he might make more money or garner more fame. Instead, he chose to stick to his guns.\n\nIndiana and Northwestern both remain two of the most historically overlooked programs in the sport. Both are quick to become the laughingstock when they struggle, and have had tremendous trouble garnering respect from the public when they do legitimately succeed because of the logo on their helmets. But Cignetti and IU aren’t letting that get to them; they’re controlling their own narrative and winning in the same way they always have. For Braun and Northwestern, that’s truly the next step in becoming a real contender.",

    "description": "Mustafa Suleyman, Microsoft AI's CEO, has described using AI for guidance on life decisions as \"something that the world needs.\"",
    "fullText": "The CEO of Microsoft AI says chatbots are a good way to offload emotions and \"detoxify ourselves.\"\n\nAppearing on an episode of Mayim Bialik's \"Breakdown\" podcast, which was released on December 16, Mustafa Suleyman said companionship and support have become some of AI's most popular use cases.\n\nPeople are using AI chatbots for everything from navigating breakups to solving disagreements with family members, he said.\n\n\"That's not therapy,\" Suleyman said. \"But because these models were designed to be nonjudgmental, nondirectional, and with nonviolent communication as their primary method, which is to be even-handed, have reflective listening, to be empathetic, to be respectful, it turned out to be something that the world needs.\"\n\nThe upside of this, he said, is \"this is a way to spread kindness and love and to detoxify ourselves so that we can show up in the best way that we possible can in the real world, with the humans that we love.\"\n\nSuleyman cofounded DeepMind in 2010. The company was acquired by Google in 2014.\n\nOn the podcast, he said people need a space to \"ask a stupid question, repeatedly, in a private way, without feeling embarrassed.\"\n\nOver time, he said, chatbots can make people \"feel seen and understood\" in a way that many other humans can't, outside of partners or close friends.\n\nNot everyone in tech, however, is enthusiastic about chatbots being used as therapy stand-ins. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is one of those voices. In August 2025, he expressed his discomfort over people relying on chatbots to make major life choices.\n\n\"I can imagine a future where a lot of people really trust ChatGPT's advice for their most important decisions,\" Altman wrote on X. \"Although that could be great, it makes me uneasy.\"\n\nIn July 2025, while appearing on \"This Past Weekend with Theo Von,\" Altman also flagged the potential legal risks of offloading onto a robot. He said that OpenAI may be required to produce its users' therapy-style chats in a lawsuit.\n\nMental health professionals have voiced concerns over the rise of ChatGPT therapy, too. Speaking to Business Insider senior health reporter Julia Pugachevsky in March 2025, two therapists said that relying on AI chatbots for emotional support could exacerbate loneliness and make people dependent on seeking reassurance.\n\nSuleyman acknowledged some of those downsides on the podcast, saying there is \"definitely a dependency risk,\" and that chatbots can sometimes be overly flattering or \"sycophantic.\"\n\nSuleyman is not the sole tech voice who sees AI's therapeutic potential. In a May 2025 interview with the Stratechery newsletter, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said he believed everyone should have a therapist.\n\n\"For people who don't have a person who's a therapist,\" Zuckerberg said, \"I think everyone will have an AI.\"",

    "description": "At 8-6, the Colts are on the outside looking in at the playoff picture, but 44-year-old Philip Rivers coming in off the couch is one of the great stories of this NFL season.",
    "fullText": "Just think, for a moment, how you’d look in a pair of form-fitting football pants and a tight-around-the-belly jersey. Would you look like a honed specimen of humanity, lean and taut and ready to explode? Or would you look like 10 pounds of sausage in a five-pound casing, busting the seams?\n\nIf you’re being honest, you, me, and pretty much everyone both of us knows would look a whole lot more like a sausage than a specimen. A whole lot like Philip Rivers does, honestly.\n\nBut the difference between Philip Rivers and us, of course, is that we aren’t starting at quarterback on Monday Night Football.\n\nRivers and the briefly-mighty, now-floundering Indianapolis Colts take on the San Francisco 49ers in a matchup that, from a sheer talent standpoint, looked a whole lot more attractive back in September than it does now. Ball-knowers will scoff at Rivers and wonder who in the world would want to watch a 44-year-old grandfather run around for three hours.\n\nTo which I would say: Everyone. Everyone would love to see that. Because what Rivers is doing is both awesome and ridiculous.\n\nIn any other career, Rivers would be hitting his prime at age 44, old enough to have learned the ropes but young enough to have the energy and desire to do more. In sports, though, he’s impossibly ancient, a relic who could burst into a pile of dust with one good sack. Hopefully he won’t, but that’s the line on most aged pro athletes.\n\nPlayers like Tom Brady and LeBron James have redefined the possible parameters of a late-career athlete, but then again, Tom Brady and LeBron James are arguably the GOATs of their respective sports. They played for such a high level for so long that their age-related decline merely brought them down to star level.\n\nRivers wasn’t ever in that stratosphere, though he had a few years in the mid-2000s — you know, about two decades ago — when he garnered some Pro Bowl nods and MVP votes. He ran with all the speed of the changing seasons, yes, but he also possessed two valuable attributes — an orbital-launch arm and a surpassing knowledge of potential defensive schemes.\n\nThat’s how he was able to come back and mesh with the Colts so quickly last week against Seattle. He played within himself, tossing a nifty 18 of 27 completions for 160 yards, with a long of just 17 yards. He had an adjusted yards gained per pass attempt of 3.52 — quite the falloff from the 8- to 9-yard average of his best days. Against San Francisco, he could fare even better; the 49ers trail Seattle in every major defensive category.\n\nBut stats are for nerds. What Grandpa Rivers did last week was ball, plain and simple. And now he’s getting a chance to take Indy on a last-ditch playoff run? Come on, how can you not love this?\n\nAt 8-6, Indianapolis sits in the dreaded first-team-out spot, well behind 10-5 division rival Houston for the final spot in the AFC playoffs. After this week, the Colts have games against the Texans and Jaguars, both teams they’re staring up at in the playoff bracket. The Athletic gives Indianapolis just a 3 percent chance of making the playoffs, which is a rough prognosis given the Colts’ 7-1 start to 2025.\n\nThat’s tough news for the franchise and the city, but on a micro level, a great story is unfolding. Rivers is the embodiment of every former football player — whether high school, college or just two-hand touch Turkey Bowl — who would love to get one more turn in the arena, one more play with the ball in their hands, one more chance to rear back and throw it deep. He’s living the dream that if you keep in shape, if you keep your edge — if not your waistline — then maybe, just maybe, they’ll call your number one more time. Father Time is undefeated, yes, but you can always move the ball against him if you want it badly enough.\n\nRivers’ return is a hell of a story, however it ends. But it’d be nice if he went out with at least one more victory. Why not a prime-time one?",

    "fullText": "annas-archive.li/blog, 2025-12-20, Discuss on Hacker News\n\nWe backed up Spotify (metadata and music files). It’s distributed in bulk torrents (~300TB), grouped by popularity.\n\nThis release includes the largest publicly available music metadata database with 256 million tracks and 186 million unique ISRCs.\n\nIt’s the world’s first “preservation archive” for music which is fully open (meaning it can easily be mirrored by anyone with enough disk space), with 86 million music files, representing around 99.6% of listens.\n\nAnna’s Archive normally focuses on text (e.g. books and papers). We explained in “The critical window of shadow libraries” that we do this because text has the highest information density. But our mission (preserving humanity’s knowledge and culture) doesn’t distinguish among media types. Sometimes an opportunity comes along outside of text. This is such a case.\n\nA while ago, we discovered a way to scrape Spotify at scale. We saw a role for us here to build a music archive primarily aimed at preservation.\n\nGenerally speaking, music is already fairly well preserved. There are many music enthusiasts in the world who digitized their CD and LP collections, shared them through torrents or other digital means, and meticulously catalogued them.\n\nHowever, these existing efforts have some major issues:\n\nThis Spotify scrape is our humble attempt to start such a “preservation archive” for music. Of course Spotify doesn’t have all the music in the world, but it’s a great start.\n\nBefore we dive into the details of this collection, here is a quick overview:\n\nThe data will be released in different stages on our Torrents page:\n\nFor now this is a torrents-only archive aimed at preservation, but if there is enough interest, we could add downloading of individual files to Anna’s Archive. Please let us know if you’d like this.\n\nPlease help preserve these files:\n\nWith your help, humanity’s musical heritage will be forever protected from destruction by natural disasters, wars, budget cuts, and other catastrophes.\n\nIn this blog we will analyze the data and look at details of the release. We hope you enjoy.\n\n— Volunteer “ez” of Anna’s Archive team\n\nLet’s dive into the data! Here's some high-level statistics pulled from the metadata:\n\nSpotify has around 256 million tracks.\n\nThe most convenient available way to sort songs on Spotify is using the popularity metric, defined as follows:\n\nThe popularity of a track is a value between 0 and 100, with 100 being the most popular. The popularity is calculated by algorithm and is based, in the most part, on the total number of plays the track has had and how recent those plays are.\n\nGenerally speaking, songs that are being played a lot now will have a higher popularity than songs that were played a lot in the past. Duplicate tracks (e.g. the same track from a single and an album) are rated independently. Artist and album popularity is derived mathematically from track popularity.\n\nIf we group songs by popularity, we see that there is an extremely large tail end:\n\n≥70% of songs are ones almost no one ever listens to (stream count < 1000). To see some detail, we can plot this on a logarithmic scale:\n\nThe top 10,000 songs span popularities 70-100. You can view them all in this HTML file (13.8MB gzipped).\n\nAdditionally, we can estimate the number of listens per track and total number per popularity. The stream count data is estimated since it is difficult to fetch at scale, so we sampled it randomly.\n\nAs we can see, most of the listens come from songs with a popularity between 50 and 80, even though there's only 210.000 songs with popularity ≥50, around 0.1% of songs. Note the huge (subjectively estimated) error bar on pop=0 — the reason for this is that Spotify does not publish stream counts for songs with < 1000 streams.\n\nWe can also estimate that the top three songs (as of writing) have a higher total stream count than the bottom 20-100 million songs combined:\n\nNote that the popularity is very time-dependent and not directly translatable into stream counts, so these top songs are basically arbitrary.\n\nWe have archived around 86 million songs from Spotify, ordering by popularity descending. While this only represents 37% of songs, it represents around 99.6% of listens:\n\nPut another way, for any random song a person listens to, there is a 99.6% likelihood that it is part of the archive. We expect this number to be higher if you filter to only human-created songs. Do remember though that the error bar on listens for popularity 0 is large.\n\nFor popularity=0, we ordered tracks by a secondary importance metric based on artist followers and album popularity, and fetched in descending order.\n\nWe have stopped here due to the long tail end with diminishing returns (700TB+ additional storage for minor benefit), as well as the bad quality of songs with popularity=0 (many AI generated, hard to filter).\n\nBefore diving into more fun stats, let’s look at how the collection itself is structured. It’s in two parts: metadata and music files, both of which are distributed through torrents.\n\nThe metadata torrents contain, based on statistical analysis, around 99.9% of artists, albums, tracks. The metadata is published as compact queryable SQLite databases. Care was taken, by doing API response reconstruction, that there is (almost) no data loss in the conversion from the API JSON.\n\nThe metadata for artists, albums, tracks is less than 200 GB compressed. The secondary metadata of audio analysis is 4TB compressed.\n\nWe look at more detail at the structure of the metadata at the end of this blog post.\n\nThe data itself is distributed in the Anna’s Archive Containers (AAC) format. This is a standard which we created a few years ago for distributing files across multiple torrents. It is not to be confused with the Advanced Audio Coding (AAC) encoding format.\n\nSince the original files contain zero metadata, as much metadata as possible was added to the OGG files, including title, url, ISRC, UPC, album art, replaygain information, etc. The invalid OGG data packet Spotify prepends to every track file was stripped — it is present in the track_files db.\n\nFor popularity>0, the quality is the original OGG Vorbis at 160kbit/s. Metadata was added without reencoding the audio (and an archive of diff files is available to reconstruct the original files from Spotify).\n\nFor popularity=0, the audio is reencoded to OGG Opus at 75kbit/s — sounding the same to most people, but noticeable to an expert.\n\nThere is a known bug where the REPLAYGAIN_ALBUM_PEAK vorbiscomment tag value is a copy-paste of REPLAYGAIN_ALBUM_GAIN instead of the correct value for many files.\n\nMany people complain about how Spotify shuffles tracks. Since we have metadata for 99.9+% of tracks on Spotify, we can create a true shuffle across all songs on Spotify!\n\nWe're curious about the peaks at whole minutes (particularly 2:00, 3:00, 4:00). If you know why this is, please let us know!\n\nSome songs, especially popular songs, have 2, 3, or even 20 different versions. We can quantify this by counting number of songs per ISRC:\n\nEach song on Spotify is only available on a specific set of markets. Most songs are available on most markets, but if we filter to popular songs, you can see a difference in availability (without filtering, the graph is almost flat):\n\nSpotify provides a list of genres per artist (not per song). If we count the artists for each genre, we get this result:\n\nSince each genre is very specific, we can also group genres and count the results:\n\nWe can also group artists by popularity. The resulting graph looks very similar to the tracks popularity graph:\n\nThe same graph for albums also looks the same.\n\nIf we group albums by release year, we see that more and more new music is added to Spotify, a lot of it likely automatically generated:\n\nThe amount of procedurally and AI generated content makes it hard to find what is actually valuable.\n\nYou can see that most songs on Spotify are singles, not part of an album.\n\nWe also scraped audio features generated by Spotify. They can be analyzed to find interesting trends.\n\nThis chart contains a lot of information. You can for example see that loudness correlates with energy and that BPM is normally distributed with a mean around 120.\n\nA scrape of the three main APIs of Spotify: artists, albums, tracks. Each track exists in exactly one album, but each track and each album can have multiple artists.\n\nThe tables are an almost lossless representation of Spotify API JSON responses, care was taken during creation by always reconstructing the original JSON based on each inserted row, with minor exceptions.\n\nA scrape of AudioFeatures objects from the Spotify API. One row per track.\n\nA scrape of Playlist objects from the Spotify API. Requires the spotify_clean.sqlite3 database to map track_rowid to track_id.\n\nMost playlists with < 1000 followers were excluded. Completeness unknown.\n\nRow count: 6.6 million playlists with 1.7 billion playlist tracks.\n\nThis is an almost lossless representation of the original Spotify API response. JSON reconstruction was tested during creation of all tables, with minor exceptions. For example, the original response JSON for playlists can be reconstructed with code similar to the following:\n\nThe link between the tracks table in spotify_clean and the actual files we have.\n\nRaw JSON API responses for audiobooks on Spotify. Contains around 700 thousand rows. Incomplete.\n\nRaw JSON API responses for audiobook chapters on Spotify. Contains around 20 million rows. Incomplete.\n\nRaw JSON API responses for shows (podcasts) on Spotify. Contains around 5 million rows. Incomplete.\n\nRaw JSON API responses for (podcast) episodes on Spotify. Contains around 54 million rows. Incomplete.\n\nRedirect responses for the artist endpoint.\n\nRaw JSON API responses for audio analysis on Spotify.\n Contains around 40 million rows, fetched in descending priority order. Many songs do not have an audio analysis (404). Incomplete.\n\nAlbum art files. Correspond to last part of url from album_images. Indexed into directories with filename prefixes (after stripping the first 16 chars from the filename).",

    "description": "Alex Yang details founding an AI startup with other high schoolers worldwide to improve Alzheimer's diagnostics.",
    "fullText": "My typical morning starts around 3 a.m. I'm instantly met with Messenger notifications from web developers in California, GitHub pings from Florida, and a running document of research papers to read sent from Michigan. By 7:50 a.m. I'm off to class to live my life as an 18-year-old high school senior in Seoul.\n\nThis solitary ritual has become my strange normal after I founded an AI research and development startup with people all around the world, whom I've never met in person. My ambition was to improve Alzheimer's diagnostics, but I had no network, so I built one online.\n\nGrowing up, I heard stories about various family members battling Alzheimer's. I viewed the disease as something truly terrifying, which leaves behind only the shell of who someone once was.\n\nI'd grown up knowing that someday, someone I love might disappear while still standing in front of me. In high school, this fear crystallized into something beyond passive acceptance.\n\nI came across this competition, looking to fund ideas that can make health more accessible, and decided to apply.\n\nI knew I couldn't do the work alone. I had to find people beyond my network with diverse perspectives and skills capable of building something real together.\n\nI started searching for partners by spending my time on internet forums and pitching my vision. I posted detailed research proposals on Discord servers and created GitHub repositories with preliminary code.\n\nAfter a month of \"nos,\" I got one \"yes\" from California. Then Florida. Then Michigan. Until there were six of us. We named ourselves Reteena (pronounced like \"retina\"), a deliberate wordplay symbolizing our mission to bring new vision to Alzheimer's diagnostics.\n\nWe became something none of us expected: a team of high schoolers from around the world who genuinely believed we could fix Alzheimer's.\n\nI didn't set out to target only high schoolers, but I was on servers mainly for students, and those were the people who responded.\n\nWe've been self-funded and started by conducting research on enhancing the image resolution of low-field MRI, which is a portable and more economically accessible MRI machine. We applied machine learning and deep learning techniques to enhance the quality of low-field MRI scans.\n\nOur goal was radical — to make Alzheimer's diagnostics accessible and affordable for underserved communities by making low-field MRI more reliable. Conducting research together, I realized that my abstract dream had become reality, but reality proved far more demanding than any dream.\n\nI staggered under the crushing weight of the time and dedication that my team was giving. The time zone difference was not an excuse for me to make them wait for responses. Lying awake at night, my stomach knotted with anxiety about \"what should I do next,\" I recognized that my wrong decision could waste months of work from people who believed in me.\n\nDuring those suffocating moments, when doubt was a physical pain in my chest, I'd question everything: my abilities, our direction, and whether I was worthy of the faith my team placed in me.\n\nGradually, my leadership improved, and doubts faded when I stopped seeing our differences as obstacles and started viewing them as strengths. I created a \"follow-the-sun\" workflow where I completed tasks before people in the states woke up, with detailed handoff documents in shared Notion workspaces. We were asynchronous, yet somehow more connected.\n\nWhen our first piece of research was published in the IEEE BigData 2024 Conference, a prestigious annual conference for artificial intelligence research, I felt exhilarated. It was proof that we were onto something and justification for every late night. Yet it was only the beginning.\n\nWe expanded from a six-person group chat into an unconventional startup with 12 members. Over the next nine months, we conducted additional Alzheimer's research and presented our findings on how changes in speech patterns and genetic markers could aid in detecting the disease earlier than traditional methods.\n\nAs people who met on the internet, we've also made our growth transparent on the internet, sharing our journey on LinkedIn. By posting our product-building journey and sharing the authentic rationale behind our research and products, we connected with mentors who believed in what we were doing — Y Combinator founders, Pear VC partners, and researchers who took us seriously despite our age.\n\nWe even started receiving messages from students across different countries asking for advice on starting their own health tech projects.\n\nMost recently, we launched our first consumer product, Remembrance, an AI therapeutic service to try to help Alzheimer's patients reconnect with their past. It works by asking gentle questions designed to trigger old memories through reminiscence therapy.\n\nEach recalled memory is automatically organized in knowledge graph databases, making it easy to revisit and build a personal memory repository. Over time, it can suggest related memories on demand, building a personalized memory archive.\n\nThe healthcare market is impenetrable in many ways. When we attempted to approach a local hospital to test our product using actual patient data, we were immediately halted by compliance requirements and institutional review boards.\n\nWe've spent two years discovering that building something in healthcare is harder than we thought. But I wouldn't change it because we learned that at 17 and 18, not at 25 when the stakes feel higher and the fear feels heavier.\n\nReteena might not end up as we imagined, but that's OK. The point was never the destination; it was about learning how to build, understanding that authentic problems matter more than viral success, and realizing you can inspire people by simply trying.\n\nThat's the real experiment. And it's worth every sleepless night.",

    "fullText": "Researchers have introduced a new temperature dataset that incorporates nearly seven more decades of climate data. Scientists said this more complete picture of our world's climate could reshape how we understand the total human impact on our planet's climate system.\n\n\"It changes our perception of how far we have already pushed the climate system in important ways,\" Peter Thorne, a Maynooth University professor and ICARUS Climate Research Centre director, told CNN.\n\nThe groundbreaking temperature dataset was recently released by a team of scientists based in the United Kingdom. It incorporates climate data dating back to 1781, further into the past than most conventional datasets. Scientists usually measure modern climate change using datasets that begin in 1850, the benchmark behind estimates of nearly 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming.\n\nThe new dataset, referred to as GloSAT, indicates that heat-trapping gases rose by 2.5% between 1750 and 1850, possibly responsible for more warming than previously thought. GloSAT suggests humans are responsible for 0.09 degrees Celsius of warming over the 100-year period.\n\nA second study published last month in the Institute of Physics journal Environmental Research Letters estimates that an additional 0.1 to 0.2 degrees Celsius of warming was caused by early increases in carbon dioxide.\n\n\"Climate simulations of the industrial era typically start in 1850, using the first 50 years as a baseline for 'preindustrial' climate,\" according to the authors of the study. \"However, the period immediately prior to 1850 is of particular interest due to early human influence and heightened volcanic activity, the latter of which led to cooler global temperatures than those observed in the subsequent historical period.\"\n\n\"As the authors themselves make clear, there is larger uncertainty prior to 1850,\" commented Thorne. \"But it is cooler; it's undoubtedly cooler.\" The climate scientist cautions that we need to carefully consider the implications of these findings.\n\nGloSAT indicates the planet was far cooler from the late 1700s through 1849 than during the 1850-1900 preindustrial baseline, in part due to cooling from two major early-1800s volcanic eruptions.\n\nWhile the data shows more warming than once thought, scientists said it doesn't alter climate targets or hasten expected impacts.\n\n\"It does mean we warmed the Earth more, but it doesn't mean the impacts are suddenly going to occur sooner,\" Thorne added, per CNN. \"They are where they are. And they've almost invariably been calculated relative to a much more recent reference period.\"\n\nIn Thorne's view, the research fits into a broader picture that points to rising concern over worsening impacts. \"It changes our perception of how far we have already pushed the climate system in important ways,\" he explained.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's global climate report uses the conventional 176-year record that begins in 1850. The agency's global climate report for November revealed that with an average temperature of 1.18 degrees Celsius (2.12 Fahrenheit) above average for the first 11 months of this year, there is a 99.9% chance that 2025 will rank among the five warmest years on record.\n\nDo you worry about having toxic forever chemicals in your home?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",
