    "description": "McLaren driver Oscar Piastri has revealed he, George Russell and Alex Albon held an “UNO\" World Championship during travel days",
    "fullText": "McLaren driver Oscar Piastri has revealed that he, George Russell and Alex Albon held an \"UNO World Championship\" that took place during travel days between some of the races of the 2025 Formula 1 season. Admitting there were \"questionable rules\" between the trio, he opened up on what he did during his downtime.\n\nTalking on F1's Off The Grid with presenter Lawrence Barretto, the Australian explained that a long-haul flight between races turned from an impromptu game of UNO into something larger.\n\n“You're just chatting, you're sleeping. What’s going on?” Barretto asked about the travel time between races when drivers share flights.\n\n“Myself, George Russell and Alex Albon had an UNO World Championship on the way from Baku to Singapore last year,” Piastri laughed. “There was some questionable rule decisions, and rules that I’d never heard of playing UNO before from some of the others, mainly George.\n\n\"Apparently, they were family rules.\"\n\nBarretto asked whether these rules from the Mercedes driver tipped the scales in his favour.\n\n\"Yes, they did,\" he smiled. \"We’re always competitive at everything, all the drivers. It’s always good fun.”\n\nHis competitiveness predates his career in motorsport. Like many, including seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton, he started with RC racing.\n\n\"Been a competitive person since I was really little,\" he said. \"But channelling that into racing and motorsport...Yeah, started with RC cars, won a national championship at nine and then started racing go-karts a year later.\"\n\nPiastri, like a lot of drivers, lives in Monaco.\n\n\"It's convenient when you want to go and play padel or do other things,\" he said on the subject. \"Also makes travelling to the races convenient. Like I'm sure most people have seen, we often travel to races together and stuff on those plane journeys.\"\n\nHe added: “It's pretty cool to come here when the races are done. It's a bit more relaxed when there's no racing.”\n\nAfter a strong start to his career in F1 and a championship contender for 2025, he has suddenly exploded in popularity - something he's still getting to grips with.\n\n“It is still a little bit strange,” he said. “Obviously at the track you expect the attention, but there has been times where you go in the supermarket or whatever, out of nowhere, someone's asking for a photo or an autograph or whatever, or even just asking, 'is that really you?'”\n\nPiastri will be hoping to continue the momentum he's found in his first three seasons into 2026.\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

    "description": "A look at 10 players who have made a difference at this year's world junior hockey championship in Minnesota.",
    "fullText": "While it was a disappointing tournament for the host Americans, the 2026 world juniors have been a thrill ride for any hockey fan tuning in. Team USA was bounced in the quarterfinal by Finland - in overtime, no less - but the semifinals produced two beguiling games.\n\nSweden punched its ticket to the gold-medal game by besting archrival Finland in a shootout, while the Canadians and Czechs added another chapter to their burgeoning rivalry with a nasty back-and-forth game eventually won 6-4 by the Czechs.\n\nIt has been more than a decade since any country other than Canada, Finland or the U.S. has won gold at the world juniors and that streak now officially ends. With Sweden (2012) and Czechia (2001) both looking for a title after many years, the final game of the tournament promises to hold intrigue.\n\nBut what about the players themselves? There have been some fantastic individual performances in the tournament, so let's take a look at some of the standouts.\n\nLoaned out by the Calgary Flames for the world juniors, Parekh has shown why Canada wanted him for the tournament. Despite being a defenseman, Parekh entered the bronze-medal game tied for the tourney lead in scoring with 11 points in six games.\n\nThe Chicago Blackhawks first-rounder has been a monster for the Swedes and perhaps his most important goal to date came in the semifinal against Finland when he iced the contest with the winning shootout goal. Frondell's shot is a weapon and it has been on full display.\n\nThough the Americans were much weaker than in previous years, Zellers was a very pleasant surprise. The University of North Dakota winger and Boston Bruins pick led the U.S. in scoring with eight points in five games while playing an electric style.\n\nNow the highest-scoring defenseman in Czech world junior history, Galvas continues to add to his totals. Undrafted because of his small stature, he plays a similar game to Lane Hutson and could very well be selected in this summer's draft. Why not take a chance, right?\n\nSlovakia brought a young team to Minnesota and one of the best was 2026 draft prospect Chrenko, whose awesome shot propelled him up the scoring charts. His five goals in five games paced his team and he certainly helped his draft stock.\n\nHeavily scrutinized thanks to his top-prospect status, McKenna nonetheless has been one of the top scorers at the world juniors with 10 points in six games. The potential No. 1 pick in the 2026 draft got in trouble in the Czech game due to some fiery behavior.\n\nAnother top scorer in the tournament, Hage is a Montreal Canadiens first-rounder and a star at the University of Michigan. He made a ton of skilled plays for Canada and his chemistry with McKenna and Brady Martin (Nashville Predators) was something to see.\n\nThe captain of the Swedes, Berglund is a two-way center and a Philadelphia Flyers prospect who has made an impact at both ends of the ice for his team. Should Sweden win gold, Berglund undoubtedly will be part of the winning formula.\n\nA speedster with skill, Saarelainen is a Tampa Bay Lightning prospect who plays back home in Finland in the top pro league. He was very involved in Finland's offense against Sweden and is one to watch in the bronze-medal game against Canada.\n\nA first-round draft prospect for 2026, Bjorck is fast and skilled. He is clearly trusted by Sweden's coaches too, as they sent him over the boards every other shift in overtime against Finland, where he had an amazing four breakaways. While he couldn't convert, he's a talent.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Draft hopefuls and NHL prospects who headlined the world juniors",

    "description": "Scotland will face Haiti in Boston on Sunday 14 June before taking on Morocco and Brazil in the US.",
    "fullText": "A public holiday will mark Scotland's men's national team playing in its first World Cup since 1998.\n\nScotland will face Haiti in Boston at 02:00 GMT on Sunday 14 June, before taking on Morocco and Brazil in their remaining group fixtures in the United States.\n\nFirst Minister John Swinney has proposed that 15 June is designated as a national bank holiday - though the move will only affect staff directly employed by the Scottish government.\n\nLike the St Andrews' Day bank holiday, other employers would not be compelled to observe it.\n\nThe proposal will be formally confirmed once it has been rubber-stamped by the King.\n\nSpeaking at an event in Glasgow, Swinney said: \"The whole nation will come to a standstill in June - even more so in July once we've seen off Brazil and progressed to the knockout stages.\n\n\"This is a moment 28 years in the waiting - and I want as many people as possible to share the occasion.\"\n\nHe added: \"That will mean that supporters across the country can watch our men's team in their first World Cup match for almost 30 years, and share in the chance for Scotland to be on the world stage, to attract business development, to create tourism and hospitality interest within the country and to make deep and lasting cultural and sporting connections.\"\n\nScotland is able to set distinct bank holidays from the rest of the UK.\n\nA day can be appointed as a bank holiday in Scotland by royal proclamation.\n\nThe first minister is able to advise the Privy Council - an advisory board to the monarch - on proclamations for Scotland, which are formally signed off by the King.\n\nScotland face Morocco in Boston on 19 June, and Brazil in Miami on 24 June. Both games kick off at 23:00 GMT.\n\nSwinney has previously said that the government would work with local authorities on extending pub opening hours during the World Cup.\n\nThe Scottish government simply does not have the power to give people across the country - including those working in the private sector or in parts of the public sector controlled by the UK government - an extra, specified day off work.\n\nBut an extra holiday may be a pragmatic response to the situation some businesses may face on the morning after Scotland's opening World Cup game. How many might want to stay up late and then take the day off?\n\nDecisions on whether or not to give staff the day off are for individual employers to take.\n\nIn general, bank or public holidays do not have to be given as paid leave by employers.\n\nAn employer can choose to include bank holidays as part of a worker's statutory annual leave.\n\nEmployment contracts tend to specify that employers have a certain number of days off every year - inclusive of bank holidays.\n\nNor is there any reason why private business would need to close. There are no restrictions on opening hours on bank holidays.\n\nEven the major Scottish high street banks do not close on Scottish bank holidays now - they observe English bank holidays, to stay in line with their sister businesses south of the border.\n\nSchool holidays are already set for the coming year by individual councils. Some may consider whether to look at giving the special bank holiday as a day off, but there are also rules on how many days schools need to open for to consider.\n\n'Scotland qualifying for the World Cup put me in hospital'\n\nScots celebrate reaching first World Cup in nearly 30 years",

    "description": "Jason Lemkin, the founder of SaaStr, the world's largest community of business-to-business executives and founders, is swapping out human workers for AI.",
    "fullText": "Jason Lemkin, known to some as the Godfather of SaaS, says the time has come to push the limits of AI in the workplace.\n\nIn practice, Lemkin, the founder of SaaStr, the world's largest community of business-to-business founders, said on Lenny's Podcast recently that this means he will stop hiring humans in his sales department.\n\nInstead, SaaStr is going all in on agents, which are commonly defined as virtual assistants that can complete tasks autonomously. They break down problems, outline plans, and take action without being prompted by a user.\n\nHe said the company now has 20 AI agents automating tasks once handled by a team of 10 sales development representatives and account executives.\n\nThat move from an entirely human workforce to an agent-based workforce was rapid.\n\nIn May, SaaStr had just one AI agent in production that it used for various digital tasks, Lemkin said. That month, though, during the SaaStr Annual — its yearly gathering of over 10,000 founders, executives, and VCs — two of its high-paid sales representatives abruptly quit.\n\nLemkin said he turned to his chief AI officer and said, \"We're done with hiring humans in sales. We're going to push the limits with agents.\"\n\nLemkin's calculus was that it just wasn't worth the cost of hiring another junior sales representative for a $150,000 a year position who would eventually quit, when he could use a loyal AI agent instead.\n\nAmelia Lerutte, SaaStr's chief AI officer, told Business Insider by email that by June, the company began ramping up the number of agents it had in production.\n\n\"We had only 1 non-core agent at the time with Delphi, but didn't go deep on 2 to 20+ until the beginning of June,\" she said. \"It was a conscious choice after their departure to reallocate some (but not all) head count spend to agents.\"\n\nAt the SaaStr office, the 10 desks that once belonged to humans on the go-to-market team are now labeled with the names of agents, like \"Quali for qualified,\" \"Arty for artisan,\" and \"Repli for Replit,\" Lemkin said.\n\nLemkin said SaaStr is training its agents on its best humans.\n\n\"Train an agent with your best person, and best script, then that agent can start to become a version of your best salesperson,\" he said.\n\nSaaStr's process is similar to how Vercel, the cloud-based platform for developers, trained a sales agent off its top performer for six weeks by documenting every step of their work, and then building an agent to mimic their process.\n\nMany companies are experimenting with AI agents, but risks remain. One of the big ones is the threat of data leaks and cybercrime.\n\n\"AI agents, in order to have their full functionality, in order to be able to access applications, often need to access the operating system or the OS level of the device on which you're running them,\" Harry Farmer, a senior researcher at the Ada Lovelace Institute, recently told Wired.\n\nAll of that access creates more potential attack points for cybercriminals.\n\nSecurity threats aside, Lemkin said that the net productivity of agents is about the same as humans. However, he said, agents are more efficient and can scale — just like software.",

    "description": "Entrepreneurs and tech workers from around the world describe how they navigated the many cloud outages in 2025.",
    "fullText": "November 18 was supposed to be a routine workday for Rwanda-based entrepreneur Derrick Ikenga. But it turned out to be a nightmare he wasn’t prepared for.\n\nCloudflare, a U.S.-based cloud services and cybersecurity firm, faced a massive global outage that day, taking down large parts of the internet, including operations of giants like X (formerly Twitter) and ChatGPT.\n\nIkenga’s company, which builds sales automation tools for clients, also uses Cloudflare. The outage brought the tools to a grinding halt, sending his clients into panic mode.\n\nFor many entrepreneurs and tech workers, this was a familiar experience in 2025. Today, an estimated 94% of enterprise services worldwide rely on at least one major cloud provider, such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud, for hosting, data storage, or delivery. Together, the three largest providers control more than 62% of the global cloud market.\n\nBetween August 2024 and August 2025, AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud together experienced more than 100 service outages. The duration of these outages varied between a few minutes and several hours. AWS saw one of the biggest and most widespread cloud outages of 2025 when its services went down for 15 hours in October. The outage affected over 4 million users and more than 1,000 companies.\n\nWhen an outage occurs, cloud service providers are responsible for restoring services as soon as possible. In some cases, providers compensate affected customers with free cloud credit.\n\nEach time such disruptions occurred, everyday moments began to fail in unexpected ways. Online payments failed. Doctors were unable to access patients’ health records. CCTV cameras went offline. Doorbells stopped working. Smart mattresses lost their sleep-tracking features.\n\nThe outage offered a glimpse into just how deeply cloud infrastructure is woven into modern life, powering everything from bank transfers to flight bookings and movie streams.\n\nRest of World brings together first-person accounts from entrepreneurs and technology workers around the world, tracing what happened when the cloud failed in 2025.\n\nThe quotes have been edited for length and brevity.\n\nFrancisco Osorio, a Mexico-based senior go-to-market marketing engineer at Simetrik, an operational control and management automation company\n\nI couldn’t do anything other than feel helpless.\n\nI am responsible for the smooth functioning of my company’s website, among other things. During the November AWS outage, the website stopped functioning, but I was unable to take any action because I lost access to all my work-related platforms, like HubSpot, Slack, and Salesforce. [Some users of AWS experienced issues on November 5, according to outage tracking website Downdetector.com. An AWS spokesperson denied the claims in comments to Reuters.]\n\nEven as we were sorting through internal issues, our clients also couldn’t log into the platform, which was a more serious concern because we need to comply with service level agreements under which we assure quality and quantity of service.\n\nI couldn’t do anything other than feel helpless. All I could tell everyone around was, “I’m deeply sorry, I cannot help you today. Our platforms are not running.”\n\nSundeep Narwani, India-based co-founder of Narrative Research Labs, a firm focusing on AI in media\n\nBeing an AI company, we’re quite heavily dependent on the cloud. The outages have wasted a lot of time for our clients and us, rendering us helpless in most cases.\n\nThe outages have wasted a lot of our time.\n\nThe first time it happened, we didn’t know what to do or how to deal with it, and we entered panic mode. My biggest concern was on two fronts: downtime disrupting our processes, and our clients being obviously very angry because we deliver a lot of daily reports for them.\n\nWhen it happened the second time, we created a standard operating procedure to deal with it because someone like me, who is involved in business development apart from being the CEO, cannot be available all the time to handle these issues.\n\nWe delegate a project manager to handle issues of cloud outages and ensure our customers are taken care of during such times while finding a quick solution to the downtime.\n\nWe have also purchased a local server to replicate what AWS does, so that if there is any kind of outage again, we have one local server to tide us over. Obviously, it doesn’t have the same kind of performance that AWS gives us, but at least the team can function. But these are just temporary options.\n\nDavid Nandwa, founder of Honeycoin, a Kenyan cross-border payment company\n\nWe have faced cloud outage issues in the past and were also hit with the recent AWS outage in November.\n\nThe approach we have applied to dealing with this is to have a “distributed stack” or multiple fallback options. We rely on multiple clouds, including AWS, Google Cloud, and Heroku. During the recent AWS outage, we temporarily switched to Google Cloud to maintain service availability for most of our customers.\n\nIf all cloud providers are down, we then fall back to using an on-premise server that we’ve created. It doesn’t perform as efficiently as our providers, but it comes in handy in moments where all the major providers are down. It’s locally hosted, so it’s an option to process requests when all else fails.\n\nSubscribing to multiple cloud providers definitely helps us not only to hedge against future risk but also to decrease reliance on a single one, and risk losing our data completely.\n\nHowever, multiple providers mean multiple bills at the end of the month.\n\nThe one-off cost of a single on-premise server installation is something we’re seriously considering to decrease reliance on the large players and also have more digital sovereignty. It’s pretty simple to set up, but it requires a lot of work to move our stack from any of the globally reputable providers to our own direct stack.\n\nOlumide Egbigbola, Nigeria-based product manager at Leatherback, a cross-border payment startup\n\nCompanies like ours can’t do much in such cases.\n\nCloud infrastructure is the backbone of most of the things that we do, as most of our critical services are hosted in the cloud. So any downtime from our cloud provider is immediately felt by our individuals and business users. We face complaints of transaction delays, and the app slowing down or being unresponsive.\n\nThis usually causes a lot of anxiety amongst users who can’t access their money.\n\nCompanies like ours can’t do much in such cases other than inform our users about the downtime.\n\nWe try to spread our cloud services and route traffic through regions that are less affected or unaffected, so that users can at least perform minimal activities while we wait for the major downtime to be over.",

    "fullText": "A Dublin man is leading the construction of the world's largest ever telescope. The Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) is approximately 70% built in the Andes Mountains in Chile.\n\nProfessor Tom Ray is president of the European Southern Observatory (ESO), which is building the telescope.\n\n\"We're talking about a mirror, right, that is 40 metres across,\" he explained on RTÉ's This Week.\n\n\"The dome is the size of the Colosseum in Rome, but actually taller than the Colosseum, but roughly about the same width.\"\n\nThe ELT is due to be completed in 2028 and is expected to cost €1.5 billion.\n\n\"It is enormous compared to anything, any sort of telescope that's been built in the past,\" he said.\n\n\"And with it, it would be possible, for example, to not only image Earth-sized planets around nearby stars, but also to explore their atmosphere.\n\n\"We want to see if there's any signs of life on the planet or whether there's any oxygen, the things that would give rise to life.\"\n\nIreland has been a member of ESO since 2019, Prof Ray said there is a lot of Irish input into the ELT project.\n\n\"The University of Galway, for example, is involved in building what we call an adoptive optics,\" he explained this as using lasers to sharpen the images of stars as seen by telescopes.\n\nIreland becoming more prominent in space exploration\n\nSenior Irish scientists say Ireland is becoming more prominent in space exploration, creating more jobs and opportunities.\n\nIn 2025, Ireland successfully completed its first satellite mission in space.\n\nBelfast-born astronaut Dr Rosemary Coogan became a European Space Agency (ESA) astronaut this year, through UK government funding.\n\nNorah Patten is expected to go into space on a commercial flight in 2027.\n\nIn March 2025, Ireland joined CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research.\n\nAnd scientists in Galway will be among the first to use the ELT when it goes live.\n\nThe scientists are studying a project on exoplanets with Italian scientists, and earlier this year, found the planet WISPIT 2b. It is about 430 light-years away from Earth.\n\nEIRSAT-1: Ireland's first satellite\n\nEIRSAT-1 was launched in January 2023 and burned back into the Earth's atmosphere after successfully completing its mission in September 2025.\n\nProfessor of astronomy, Lorraine Hanlon, director of UCD's Centre for Space Research, led the EIRSAT-1 mission.\n\n\"All of the technology that we created really from our lab to a fully functioning space instrument has been tested,\" Prof Hanlon told RTÉ's This Week.\n\n\"Showing that that technology worked, that we were able to put it together and put a full spacecraft together in our labs tells us that we can actually use this technology not only for small satellites, but we can use it as building blocks for much larger instruments that would be even more powerful in the future.\"\n\nDuring the mission, Prof Hanlon's team in UCD detected 12 gamma-ray bursts as well as several solar flares using the EIRSAT-1.\n\nWe need your consent to load this rte-player contentWe use rte-player to manage extra content that can set cookies on your device and collect data about your activity. Please review their details and accept them to load the content.Manage Preferences\n\nUnlike many ESA member countries, Ireland's does not have its own space agency; instead, Enterprise Ireland runs the country's space programme.\n\nProf Hanon said that Ireland has not necessarily needed a standalone space agency up to now.\n\n\"But I think the case is becoming stronger for some kind of coordinating entity that would oversee education, research through to industry and innovation,\" she said.\n\nIreland's investment in ESA is relatively small compared to other countries; however, it is estimated that the country sees a return of approximately 7:1 on that investment.\n\nFor 2025, Ireland's total contribution to ESA was €26 million. There are at least 116 Irish companies that have a contract with ESA.\n\nMany Irish companies and higher education institutions now have work from membership of organisations such as ESA, ESO and CERN.\n\nProf Hanlon said joining these organisations is worth the membership fees.\n\n\"It means that your scientists are in those collaborations, are defining the experiments that will create the next level of challenge.\n\n\"So, your scientists are defining those problems that need to be addressed.\"\n\nMunster Technological University has already joined a scientific experiment with CERN.\n\nThe ESA is launching the PLATO mission to search for planets around other stars this year, which will include technology from Irish company Réaltra.\n\nAnother Irish company, InnaLabs, has its technology on board another ESA mission called HERA, which will arrive at the Didymos asteroid system in late 2026.\n\nIn UCD, another satellite mission called GIFTS: A 6U CubeSat for the detection and localisation of gamma-ray bursts is currently underway.\n\nAerial, a project with funding from both ESA and ESO, also has Irish involvement.\n\nProf Ray explained: \"What Aerial is doing is looking at a few thousand planets and their atmosphere, but from space.\n\n\"So, we're involved with the constructing of several parts of this and testing them, because they have to be tested at very low temperatures, I'm talking minus 230C because that's what it's like out in space.\"\n\nProf Ray added that Irish scientists are doing \"very innovative work in space\".\n\n\"Our students, our postdocs, people who already have a PhD, are receiving wonderful training from work not only to do with the European Space Agency, but the European Southern Observatory.\n\n\"I've had 30 PhD students and none of them are unemployed. They are immediately snapped up,\" he said.",

    "description": "The oil market was already under pressure before the latest development, with crude futures falling 20% last year.",
    "fullText": "Oil futures fluctuated between gains and losses in the first trading day since the US captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro over the weekend.\n\nUS benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures fell as much as 1.4% in the opening hour of trading before moving sideways. They were 0.5% lower at $57.01 at midnight on Monday.\n\nInternational benchmark Brent crude futures were 0.4% lower at $60.50 a barrel after falling as much as 1.4% in early trade.\n\nThe oil market has been under pressure, with crude prices falling 20% last year. A main issue facing the market is an oversupply of global crude. It's been a focus of OPEC+, which also over the weekend said it will refrain from pumping new oil during the first quarter.\n\nDespite Venezuela's vast oil reserves — estimated at about one-fifth of the global total — the country's output accounts for less than 1% of global daily oil production, reflecting years of aging infrastructure and the impact of sanctions.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, President Donald Trump said on Saturday that US oil companies will invest billions of dollars in Venezuela.\n\nIf Venezuelan oil production does pick up, analysts say it could take time and big money.\n\n\"It will take tens of billions of dollars in investment and at least a decade of Western oil majors committing to the country,\" wrote Peter McNally, the global head of sector analysts at research firm Third Bridge, on Sunday.\n\nMcNally added that there are no swift solutions for Venezuela, where years of underinvestment have eroded infrastructure across the economy, and a severe power crisis continues to disrupt daily life.\n\nAnalysts at Goldman Sachs echoed that view in a Sunday note, writing that \"higher recovery rates of heavy Venezuela oil will likely require financial and time investments in oil-processing upgraders and improvements in operational efficiencies, power availability, and oil transporting infrastructure.\"\n\nVenezuela produced around 3 million barrels a day of oil at its peak in the mid-2000s.\n\nEven before the US captured Maduro, Venezuela's oil exports had already come under pressure after Trump imposed a blockade of sanctioned oil tankers entering or leaving Venezuelan waters last month. The blockade remains in place.\n\nGoldman Sachs said the latest developments increase the likelihood of a shift toward a policy environment more supportive of oil investment, even as short-term changes to oil flows — including both modest increases and further disruptions — remain possible.\n\nThe developments are negative for oil prices over the long run, as any sustained increase in Venezuelan output would add to already ample supply at a time of slowing demand growth, according to Goldman.\n\n\"Production may edge up slightly in the short-run, including in a scenario with a US-supported government and full sanctions relief. Alternatively, disruptions to Venezuela oil deliveries could continue and/or intensify in the short-run, for instance because Maduro's cabinet has asserted its control,\" wrote Goldman's analysts.\n\nGoldman estimates WTI and Brent to average $51 a barrel and $58 a barrel, respectively, should Venezuelan crude production fall by 400,000 barrels a day by the end of 2026.\n\nShould the country's crude production rise by 400,000 barrels a day instead, WTI and Brent are expected to average $50 a barrel and $54 a barrel, respectively, in 2026, the analysts added.",

    "fullText": "Former heavyweight world champion Tyson Fury has announced he will return to boxing in 2026, bringing an end to his latest spell of retirement.\n\nThe 37-year-old Briton last fought in December 2024, when he was beaten for a second time by unified champion Oleksandr Usyk in their heavyweight rematch. Fury confirmed his retirement a month later.\n\nSpeculation over a comeback had grown in recent weeks after Fury shared footage of himself training in Thailand alongside South African boxer Kevin Lerena.\n\nPosting on Instagram on Sunday, Fury said: \"2026 is that year. Return of the Mac. Been away for a while but I'm back now. 37 years old and still punching. Nothing better to do than punch men in the face & get paid for it.\"\n\nFury's return to the ring was widely expected. His most recent retirement was met with scepticism last year, given his history of reversals.\n\nHe previously stepped away from boxing after stopping Dillian Whyte at Wembley Stadium in April 2022, only to return six months later.\n\nQueensberry promoter Frank Warren said he expected Fury to fight again. Saudi Arabia powerbroker Turki Alalshikh had reportedly planned for Fury and long-time rival Anthony Joshua to take separate bouts in the Kingdom early in 2026 before finally meeting later in the year.\n\nJoshua fuelled that possibility after defeating Jake Paul in December, saying he was ready to face Fury next.\n\nThose plans are now uncertain after Joshua was injured in a car crash in Nigeria that claimed the lives of two close friends.\n\nFury enjoyed two reigns as heavyweight champion and boasts a professional record of 34 wins, two defeats - both against Usyk - and one draw with Deontay Wilder.\n\nHe stunned long-reigning champion Wladimir Klitschko in 2015 to claim the WBA (Super), IBF, WBO and The Ring heavyweight titles in Germany.\n\nAfter more than two and a half years away from the ring, during which he addressed mental health struggles, Fury returned in 2018 and regained world champion status by defeating Wilder in 2020 to win the WBC title.\n\nFury has spoken openly about wanting to avenge his defeats by Usyk, who currently holds the WBA (Super), WBC and IBF belts.\n\nThere appears to be limited appetite among fans for a trilogy, while the Ukrainian has indicated he would prefer to defend his titles against Wilder next.\n\nOne potential route to world-title contention could be a domestic clash with Fabio Wardley, the current WBO champion and another fighter promoted by Warren's Queensberry stable.",

    "title": "How the sugar industry bought out scientists for decades",
    "description": "Researchers followed the money, and found out that the sugar industry has been gaslighting the entire world for fifty years. It was code-named \"Project 226.\"",
    "fullText": "According to a report just published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, a delegation from the Sugar Research Foundation paid off Harvard scientists to produce reports that falsely downplayed the role of sugar in coronary heart disease.\n\nYep. Sugar contributes to coronary artery disease, more than we have been led to believe.\n\nReports had linked both dietary sugar and dietary fat to heart disease as early as the mid-50s; by 1960 we knew that low-fat diets high in sugars still resulted in high cholesterol levels. So in 1964, the director of the SRF proposed that the group \"embark on a major program\" to dispute the data as well as any \"negative attitudes toward sugar.\" They found a group of Harvard nutrition scientists who would take their money, and started making plans.\n\nComplete with a codename, Project 226 was designed to protect the interests of the sugar industry by \"recapturing\" the 20% of American calorie intake they expected to lose once this whole sugar-isn't-great-for-your-heart thing percolated through into public awareness. It resulted in a two-part review published in the prestigious and influential New England Journal of Medicine, which hand-waved away huge swathes of research pointing out the risks of dietary sugar.\n\nThe authors went to absurd lengths to discount studies that didn't tell the story the Sugar Research Foundation wanted to tell. For example, to get the results they wanted, they had to throw out all the studies done on animals, because not a single animal study supported the conclusion they wanted. But after they finished their work, they reported that epidemiological studies showed a positive association between high dietary sugar consumption and better heart disease outcomes. The review concluded that there was \"no doubt\" that the only way to avoid heart disease was to reduce saturated fat.\n\nHow did this get past the sanity check at NEJM? The authors were experts, respected in their fields, and they were at least consistent cherry-pickers. They also conveniently failed to report that the Sugar Research Foundation funded their \"study.\" NEJM didn't start requiring authors to report conflicts of interest until 1984, and by then the sugar industry had floated comfortably on their 1964 precedent, funding study after study supporting their pro-sugar narrative \"as a main prop of the industry's defense.\"\n\nCan we finally talk about industry-funded studies? I'm not saying that scientists shouldn't be able to work for private research establishments. Obviously the money to buy the pipettes and reagents has to come from somewhere. But I am saying that there needs to be an unpleasantly bright spotlight on the financial resources enabling the scientific findings cited to support policymaking, whether political or medical. What industry would ever pay to support research that would put it out of business? Whether or not you're in favor of industry self-regulation, no matter whether the research is funded by taxes, commercial revenue, or charitable sources, everyone deserves policies that are made based on the whole truth -- not based on a callously selective interpretation of the facts that ends up lining someone's pockets at the expense of others' health. After how many deaths or lost person-years do the industry payoffs start being blood money?\n\nI for one, as a bench scientist, am mightily tired of hearing about scientists taking money to produce the right conclusion. This is the kind of crap Bill Nye was railing against in his comments that the industry barons who pay off scientists to fit the results to the desired conclusions maybe should be thrown in jail. It's prima facie fraud.\n\nThe peer-reviewed paper in which the scientists make this report is freely available from the JAMA(Opens in a new window), and that's how it ought to be. The only solution to corruption in science is to get more critical eyes on the whole process. There needs to be an independent body of investigative experts accountable to the public, who have to submit to a zealous and hard-hitting inquiry into their financial interests, and who can serve as a sanity check for advisory boards or legislative committees.\n\nWe need a Mythbusters for medical advice: someone who isn't a wholly owned subsidiary of the industry. Someone who can turn on the lights and force the roaches of corruption to scatter. Pay-to-win gaming isn't fair, and people hate it, and pay-to-win science is just as bad. It's about time to start paying the skeptics, because an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.\n\nBut the only way we can do the above is if the science is accessible. How much do you think a subscription to every major scientific journal would cost, even at the discounted academic rate? The EU's Horizon 2020 directive provided hosting and access that made freely available all research funded even in part by EU money -- while the authors retain the right to license, patent or commercialize their work, the peer-reviewed papers reporting their results are now free, as in libre and gratis. When they publish in Nature or wherever, they also have to publish in the European Research Council's public database.\n\nWe should do that in the US, because hosting is cheap. Then maybe we could afford to hire people like Penn and Teller, Adam and Jamie, or Phil Plait and James Randi: people with faces we know and judgment we've checked, people whose stock in trade it is to root out misunderstandings and weasel words. Policy grounded in research needs to be officially subjected to the kind of person who just can't stand it when someone is wrong on the internet. Give us some accountability and tear down this paywall.\n\nResearch: doi:10.1001/jamainternmed.2016.5394",

    "title": "China Stopped Production On The World's Largest Particle Accelerator - Here's Why",
    "description": "China's ambitious new particle accelerator was meant to pick up where the Large Hadron Collider left off, but the project was put on pause. Here's the story.",
    "fullText": "Planned to be the largest particle accelerator in the world, China's Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC) was meant to be about 100 kilometers or 62 miles long. That's much bigger than CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC) with an approximately 27 kilometer circumference – or nearly 17 miles. These systems, especially the LHC, play a huge role in studying how the universe began during the Big Bang.\n\nDevelopment for CEPC started in 2012, around the time CERN discovered the Higgs boson particle; however, it appears the multibillion-dollar project is now paused. It was not included in the country's next five-year plan, spanning 2026 to 2030, which means it's considered a lower priority by the state — it will see less funding and resources. Wang Yifang from the Institute of High Energy Physics confirmed the change, but although the recent proposal to be included in China's five-year plan was denied, the team plans to resubmit the CEPC proposal in 2030.\n\nWhile it hasn't been directly confirmed, the CEPC would cost an estimated $5.1 billion, money that the country might want to divert elsewhere. In that case, Wang says if the European Future Circular Collider (FCC) – the next-generation collider that would effectively be LHC's successor with a much larger 90.7-kilometer (or 56-mile) circumference – is approved before the 2030 proposals, they'll likely join forces with the related teams instead.\n\nTo summarize, China's CEPC is out, likely due to cost and resource requirements, but the European's FCC still has potential, and the Chinese physicist team may join up if the proposal is approved before the next round of China's plans.\n\nDiscoveries from the systems we have operating now, like the Higgs boson discovery at LHC, occur because of how particle accelerators actually work. They fire particles into a big tunnel, or underground rings, which circle around at incredibly fast speeds before colliding. By observing these collisions, scientists get a glimpse into what the early universe looked like, as well as other foundational elements like quarks, the building blocks of visible matter in the universe. Scientists also used the system to create quark soup, a substance that hadn't been seen for billions of years before that. Generally speaking, when two particles collide, for the infinitesimally small span of time afterwards, scientists can see traces or patterns that are otherwise invisible — that's exactly how they discovered the Higgs boson.\n\nThe larger colliders, like CEPC or FCC, would not only introduce larger tunnel systems but more advanced and unique equipment, to uncover heavier or different particles, many of which the LHC simply cannot create. Imagine what kind of alchemy could be achieved with the larger, more capable collider systems.\n\nAs the current system, the LHC is expected to be phased out by the 2040s; meanwhile, the FCC, if approved, will begin development in the 2030s. That said, construction can't start quite that easily: Before anything happens, the CERN Member States and international partners have to give the upgrade project a greenlight.\n\nEnjoyed this article?",

    "fullText": "Switzerland's Camille Rast said she was racing for the victims of the New Year's Eve fire in her hometown of Crans-Montana as she ended Mikaela Shiffrin's winning start to the World Cup slalom season.\n\nRast, 26, produced a stunning second run in Sunday's slalom in Kranjska Gora to pip Shiffrin by 0.14 seconds, following up Saturday's debut World Cup giant slalom victory at the same Slovenian resort.\n\nUS star Shiffrin, 30, had won the opening five slalom events which, when added to her victory in the final slalom of last season, equalled her own record of six consecutive wins in the discipline.\n\n\"I gave it everything I had this weekend - achieving the double [slalom and giant slalom] was extraordinary,\" said Rast, who added: \"I think about all those families - we raced for them this weekend.\"\n\nA devastating fire at Le Constellation bar in the Swiss ski resort killed at least 40 people and injured 119 others.\n\nBodies continue to be identified and a criminal investigation is under way.\n\n\"We can't imagine how it is, but it's for sure terribly hard,\" Rast told BBC's Ski Sunday.\n\n\"I hope they will find the support with their family and everybody around. And I hope that the sport will bring a little smile on their face.\"\n\nRast finished a close second to Shiffrin in the previous World Cup slalom event in Austria but was not to be denied a second time, making sure the World Cup's greatest skier could not add to her record tally of 106 wins in all disciplines.\n\nShiffrin was just 0.1 seconds behind leader Rast after the first run, but set an imposing time in the second that opened a 1.69secs lead over the rest of the field.\n\nBut Rast went even faster to beat Shiffrin into second place.\n\n\"I know Shiffrin is really fast and I had to be really, really fast to beat her. I saw her start and I was like 'mmm, OK, that's good, that's really good', but I just tried to give my best, and it worked,\" she said.\n\nThere are two more World Cup slalom events - in Flachau, Austria, on 13 January, and Spindleruv Mlyn in the Czech Republic on 25 January - before the Winter Olympics begin in Milan-Cortina on 6 February.\n\nWatch Rast's victory and interview in the latest edition of Ski Sunday from 17:50 GMT on 4 January.\n\nGreat Britain had two cross-country skiers finish in the top 10 of a World Cup event for the first time in Val di Fiemme, Italy, on Sunday.\n\nBritain's Joe Davies, 24, was sixth - his best World Cup finish - while team-mate Andrew Musgrave, 35, was eighth in the men's 10km mass start free, more commonly known as the 'Final Climb'.\n\nMusgrave finished 15th and Davies 16th in the overall Tour de Ski standings - the first time the British team has had two skiers in the top 20.\n\nDavies told BBC Sport: \"To have the results we've had this Tour de Ski means so much to us all. It's not only a testament to the work we've put in, but also to the belief that British skiing belongs at the top.\"\n\nThe British cross country team for the 2026 Winter Olympics is expected to be announced on 23 January.\n\nMeanwhile, Great Britain narrowly missed out on a first World Cup podium of the season in the men's four-man bobsleigh, finishing fourth in Winterberg, Germany.",

    "fullText": "Arne Slot spoke to Sky Sports after Liverpool's draw against Fulham: \"In an away game, scoring two goals should maybe be enough to win the game. It's not for the first time this season that we fight so hard and think we have a win but concede an incredible strike. We brought Joe Gomez in but they took it short. We missed out on a good result.\n\n\"We had our chances in the first half. We had a similar one with Cody Gakpo that they scored from. In an ideal world, we see a Liverpool team that is dominant but creates more chances. We scored two goals, scored two disallowed goals and hit the bar. Again, it wasn't enough.\n\n\"The players are giving everything they have. I have to keep in mind that I have to keep them available. Alexander Isak is out and I have to overload or play Hugo more, a player who has never played in the Premier League. You have to manage that. We still have 11 very good players on the pitch.\n\n\"It's not only for us, but many teams don't create chances every game. It's not perfect but at least we've created a few more chances today than last week.\"\n\nCody Gakpo spoke to BBC Match of the Day: \"It's disappointing for us. We fought very hard in the second half, dominated at moments and tried to create chances to get through. At the end I scored in minute 95, they scored in minute 97 - a wonderful goal to be fair. Unlucky, unfortunate.\n\n\"This is a moment that can happen in a game. I was just sitting down so I did not see the moments before. I just saw him take a touch and shoot the ball into the top corner.\n\n\"I think if you are going to analyse the game maybe we should have scored more goals or defended the two goals better. In the end we should do much better. There were moments that we showed how good we were but it is up to us to stay consistent and put in overall better performances. I'm sure the wins will come again.\"\n\nOn playing in the nine: \"As a forward player you always want to score goals to help the team so it's a plus for me. In the end it's a team sport and we didn't win so I'm still disappointed.\"",

    "fullText": "Countries’ commitments to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions can have important implications for their economies. Data since the 1800s reveal that the amount of CO2 emissions generated for a given level of output follows a bell-shaped curve. Pairing this with projections of future economic growth can help in predicting future overall emissions. Comparing actual data with past projections for levels of emission intensity reveals that reductions have been slower than predicted over the past 40 years. This divergence highlights the challenges many countries may face in reaching their emissions targets.\n\nMost countries have committed to reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions over the next few decades (United Nations 2021). These commitments can have important economic implications because they may involve reconfiguring the energy sector, adopting new production technologies, and a general shift in the industrial makeup of economies, to name a few (Fried, Novan, and Peterman 2021 and Gillingham and Stock 2018).\n\nIn this Economic Letter, we use historical CO2 emissions data to evaluate the evolution in the emission intensity of production. This refers to the amount of CO2 emissions per dollar of economic output produced, which can be used as a measure of emissions efficiency. The lower the emission intensity, the more likely countries are to meet their emissions targets given current trends of output growth. In assessing trends in emission intensity, we focus on the six largest carbon-emitting countries, which collectively represent about 75% of world emissions. Three of these countries—the United States, Japan, and Germany—represent advanced economies that developed early in the 20th century with highly inefficient technologies in terms of CO2 emissions. Over time, they have brought down their emissions per dollar significantly. The other three countries—China, India, and Russia—represent emerging economies that went through their industrial transition much later in the 20th century. Because production technologies available at that time had evolved to create less pollution, these three countries now face a quicker path toward cleaner production.\n\nBased on this historical evidence, we find that the emission intensities of these two groups over time can be approximated well by bell-shaped curves. We examine different economic growth scenarios and their implications for CO2 emissions relative to reduction commitments. Our analysis suggests that future paths of economic growth and efforts to reduce emission intensity are both important factors in assessing whether these countries will meet their stated targets.\n\nFollowing the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, commonly known as Glasgow COP26, world leaders reaffirmed their commitments to reducing CO2 emissions and limiting the increase in global average temperature to 1.5° Celsius (United Nations 2021). Achieving this target is likely to require countries to significantly reshape their economies, which can involve considerable transition costs (Gillingham and Stock 2018).\n\nHow can countries reduce fossil fuel emissions? At a basic level, there are only two ways: reduce overall economic output, and thus income and consumption for their citizens, or become more efficient by using cleaner technologies to produce the same goods and services with fewer emissions.\n\nWritten simply, the level of emissions equals an economy’s emission intensity multiplied by its economic output growth. Breaking down the problem into these two components is similar to approaches that some researchers use to forecast CO2 emissions (for example, Kaya and Yokobori 1997). Our approach provides a way to easily assess a country’s progress on its road toward lower emissions.\n\nWe begin by examining world emission intensity. Figure 1 displays global CO2 emissions divided by global GDP measured in U.S. dollars, which is a common way to compare output growth across countries, over the past 200 years. The dashed line shows the fit from a bell-shaped curve. We create the curve using three parameters that correspond to the peak intensity, when the peak occurs, and how long it takes for intensity to decline from the peak. The shaded regions are 68% confidence bands, which indicate the uncertainty related to the combination of our parameter estimates and how well the curve fits the data. The figure shows that a bell-shaped curve fits the historical path of emission intensity very well, capturing the rise of world intensity up to the 1920s and the gradual improvement since then.\n\nFigure 1\nGlobal CO2 emission intensity\n\nSources: Emissions: Ritchie, Roser, and Rosado (2020), based on Global Carbon Budget data. GDP levels: Maddison Project Database, accessed through Our World in Data. GDP growth rates and 2019–2021 levels: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).\n\nTo gain a better understanding of this pattern over time, we turn to more granular data on individual countries. We focus on the world’s six highest-emitting countries, which collectively account for about 75% of global emissions as of 2021: China with 37.88% of global emissions, the United States with 16.53%, India with 8.95%, Russia with 5.80%, Japan with 3.52%, and Germany with 2.23%.\n\nWe classify these countries into two groups. The first group, including the United States, Japan, and Germany, represents large advanced economies, while the second group, China, India, and Russia, represents large emerging economies. This classification helps us broadly characterize the paths and challenges ahead for these two types of economies, rather than relying on aggregate numbers.\n\nFigure 2 shows emission intensity—defined earlier as the ratio of total emissions to total economic output—averaged for the advanced economies group (solid blue line) and the emerging economies group (solid red line). Data for Russia is only available since 1960. To avoid a large jump in the series at that date, we approximate Russian data before then using the average of data for China and India because all three countries follow similar historical paths.\n\nFigure 2\nCO2 emission intensity by country group\n\nSources: Emissions: Ritchie, Roser, and Rosado (2020), based on Global Carbon Budget data. GDP levels: Maddison Project Database, accessed through Our World in Data, and authors’ calculations. GDP growth rates and 2019–2021 levels: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).\n\nFor both groups, we find that emission intensity is currently declining, implying that all countries are emitting less carbon per dollar of output produced relative to their respective peak emission intensity. In the case of the group of advanced economies, the decline of emission intensity began in the 1920s. For the group of emerging economies, the decline started from a lower peak level and took place much later, in the 1980s, which aligned with their economic development.\n\nTo model these trends of emission intensity, we find that fitting the data to bell-shaped curves again works surprisingly well for the two groups, as shown by the dashed lines in Figure 2, as well as at the individual country level (not shown). Focusing on the sample up to 2021, the dashed lines show that the bell-shaped curves nicely describe the magnitude of the emission intensity’s peak, the timing of when the peak occurs, and how quickly emission intensity declines from the peak.\n\nThe fitted curves also allow us to extrapolate the emission intensity for each group into the future. These projections are reported in Figure 2 to the right of the vertical line marking 2021. One major assumption underlying our extrapolation is that emission intensity will continue to decline at the rate dictated by the shape of the bell curve; despite the inherent uncertainty in projecting such trends, we believe that using history as a guide is a reasonable assumption.\n\nEmission intensity is only one part of the equation. The other part is determined by the rate at which countries continue to grow in the future. Therefore, in Figure 3, we present three different scenarios of output growth for our two groups.\n\nFigure 3\nProjected real GDP by country group\n\nThe first scenario relies on OECD long-term baseline projections for GDP growth for each country in the two groups through the year 2050. For the advanced economies group, shown in blue, the OECD’s average annual growth rate is 1.5%. For the emerging economies group, in red, the OECD’s average annual growth is 6.2%. The second and third scenarios assume a quarter percentage point higher and lower annual rates of growth per year, respectively. Over 27 years, these scenarios cumulate to 7% higher and lower growth for each group, shown by the upper and lower bounds of the shaded blue and red ranges.\n\nWe now have the two pieces needed to extrapolate emissions to 2050–emission intensity and output growth. Taking these pieces together, Figure 4 reports projected emissions by country group from 2021 to 2050. The solid lines report actual emissions for advanced (blue) and emerging (red) economies. The dashed lines show emissions predicted by our bell-shaped curve of emission intensity in combination with GDP projections. The figure also includes shaded regions that reflect both the uncertainty from the projections of our estimated bell curve, using plus and minus one standard deviation around the projections, and the range of assumptions for GDP growth based on OECD projections. Finally, we include horizontal lines corresponding to the 2030 emission reduction targets set by the countries of each group in accordance with Glasgow COP26. The targets were submitted as each country’s nationally determined contribution to the goal of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5°C (United Nations 2023). We calculated the target levels for the advanced and emerging economy groups by aggregating individual country-level commitments to the group level, shown by the two horizontal lines.\n\nFigure 4\nProjected emissions by country group\n\nSources: Emissions: Ritchie, Roser, and Rosado (2020), based on Global Carbon Budget data. GDP levels: Maddison Project Database, accessed through Our World in Data. GDP growth rates and 2019–2021 levels: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Country targets: United Nations (2023).\n\nWhat are the takeaways from Figure 4? The distance between the data and the model predictions (solid and dashed lines, respectively) since the 1990s shows that emissions have been running higher than our modeling framework would have predicted. In essence, the two groups are falling behind the curve. How quickly future emissions will decline is uncertain, as the wide ranges of our predictions suggest. Our exercise cannot project the potential effects of technological changes, economic shocks, and other sources of output and emissions variation. This means that the range of possible values shown in Figure 4 is likely to be even wider. Regardless of these sources of uncertainty, a comparison between the predictions and the 2030 commitments suggests that reaching these targets may require more extensive efforts from the countries in our sample.\n\nCountries worldwide have stated their commitments to reduce CO2 emissions over the next few decades. The lessons that we draw from our exercise in this Letter serve to sketch a more general view of the challenges to advanced and emerging economies when it comes to reducing fossil fuel emissions. Reaching 2030 targets may involve significant efforts to reduce emissions and have the potential to involve substantial economic changes to production, technology, use of resources, and saving and investment decisions (Fried, Novan, and Peterman 2021). Focusing on the top six emitting countries, we find that their emission intensity has considerably improved in the past few decades, though total emissions have been higher than expected over the past 40 years. Considering a relatively wide range of economic growth prospects, we find that—even with improvements in cleaner production technologies—countries are likely to fall well short of their intended emission reduction by 2030 and beyond.\n\nZoë Arnaut\nResearch Associate, Economic Research Department, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\n\nÒscar Jordà\nSenior Policy Advisor, Economic Research Department, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\n\nFernanda Nechio\nVice President, Economic Research Department, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\n\nFried Stephie, Kevin Novan, and William B.

    "fullText": "AI safety expert David Dalrymple said rapid advances could outpace efforts to control powerful systems\n\nThe world “may not have time” to prepare for the safety risks posed by cutting-edge AI systems, according to a leading figure at the UK government’s scientific research agency.\n\nDavid Dalrymple, a programme director and AI safety expert at the Aria agency, told the Guardian people should be concerned about the growing capability of the technology.\n\n“I think we should be concerned about systems that can perform all of the functions that humans perform to get things done in the world, but better,” he said. “We will be outcompeted in all of the domains that we need to be dominant in, in order to maintain control of our civilisation, society and planet.”\n\nDalrymple said there was a gap in understanding between the public sector and AI companies about the power of looming breakthroughs in the technology.\n\n“I would advise that things are moving really fast and we may not have time to get ahead of it from a safety perspective,” he said. “And it’s not science fiction to project that within five years most economically valuable tasks will be performed by machines at a higher level of quality and lower cost than by humans.”\n\nDalrymple said governments should not assume that advanced systems are reliable. Aria is publicly funded but independent from the government and directs research funding. Dalrymple is developing systems to safeguard AI’s use in critical infrastructure such as energy networks.\n\n“We can’t assume these systems are reliable. The science to do that is just not likely to materialise in time given the economic pressure. So the next best thing that we can do, which we may be able to do in time, is to control and mitigate the downsides,” he said.\n\nDescribing the consequences of technological progress getting ahead of safety as a “destabilisation of security and economy”, Dalrymple said more technical work was needed on understanding and controlling the behaviours of advanced AI systems.\n\n“Progress can be framed as destabilising and it could actually be good, which is what a lot of people at the frontier are hoping. I am working to try to make things go better but it’s very high risk and human civilisation is on the whole sleep walking into this transition.”\n\nThis month the UK government’s AI Security Institute (AISI) said the capabilities of advanced AI models were “improving rapidly” across all domains and the performance in some areas was doubling every eight months.\n\nLeading models can now complete apprentice-level tasks 50% of the time on average, up from approximately 10% of the time last year, according to the institute. AISI also found that the most advanced systems can autonomously complete tasks that would take a human expert over an hour.\n\nThe institute also tested advanced models for self-replication, a key safety concern because it involves a system spreading copies of itself to other devices and becoming harder to control. The tests showed two cutting-edge models achieving success rates of more than 60%.\n\nHowever, AISI stressed that a worst-case scenario was unlikely in a day-to-day environment, saying any attempt at self-replication was “unlikely to succeed in real-world conditions”.\n\nDalrymple believes that AI systems will be able to automate the equivalent of a full day of research and development work by late 2026, which will “result in a further acceleration of capabilities”, because the technology will be able to self-improve on the maths and computer science elements of AI development.",

    "description": "Venezuela has the world’s largest oil reserves, but “our people don’t even have gas even to cook. That’s a disaster,” María Corina Machado told Fortune last year.",
    "fullText": "Months before the U.S. military arrested Venezuela’s Nicolás Maduro, opposition leader María Corina Machado called for what she described as the most ambitious economic transformation in the nation’s history—a sweeping privatization aimed at reversing his policies and what she calls “the disaster this socialist system has wrought.”\n\nAppearing virtually on the Fortune Global Forum stage in Riyadh, Machado, while in hiding from the Maduro regime, unveiled a bold vision to rebuild Venezuela’s shattered economy through large-scale private investment.\n\n“Venezuela will be the single biggest economic opportunity for decades to come in this region,” she told Fortune’s Diane Brady at the forum’s 2025 edition, weeks after winning the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize for her decades-long fight to restore democracy to Venezuela. “We’re talking about an opportunity, business opportunity, of more than $1.7 trillion. This is unique.” Machado has floated the $1.7 trillion figure before, an estimate produced by her economic advisory team.\n\nMachado painted a stark picture of a nation that has plummeted from prosperity to poverty: “a country that used to be the richest country in our region and the freest country in our region, and that has turned into one of the poorest.” Being under socialist rule for decades, she said, has crippled industry, devastated infrastructure, and triggered an exodus of nearly a third of Venezuela’s population. “Our economy has collapsed. It’s been over 80% down in the last [several] years,” she said. “Our people have been forced to flee just to survive.”\n\nThe International Monetary Fund estimated Venezuela’s economy had declined by roughly 75% as of late 2022, also covering its migrant crisis. The left-wing think tank Center for Economic and Policy Research argued shortly afterward that, while this figure was accurate, it discounted the severe economic sanctions imposed by the U.S. on Venezuela for many years.\n\nThe opposition leader described to Brady what she called a “narco-terrorist state” built on repression and corruption, saying that “certainly Venezuela has turned into a safe haven for criminal activities from all over the world.” She accused Maduro and his allies of financing their grip on power through gold smuggling, arms and drug trafficking, and human exploitation.\n\nAt the core of Machado’s plan is a rapid and transparent privatization process. She estimates that more than 500 enterprises were “taken by the regime, confiscated, destroyed, but the infrastructure is there.” She pledged strict oversight and rule of law from “day one,” aiming to lure investors back with stability and fiscal incentives. She pledged open markets and an approach that would be “absolutely strict” in terms of rule of law and transparency, reminding Brady that Venezuela is currently in last place in terms of rule of law. To take one example, the World Justice Project recently ranked Venezuela No. 142, out of 142 countries.",

    "fullText": "Former heavyweight world champion Tyson Fury has announced he will return to boxing in 2026, bringing an end to his latest spell of retirement.\n\nThe 37-year-old Briton last fought in December 2024, when he was beaten for a second time by unified champion Oleksandr Usyk in their heavyweight rematch. Fury confirmed his retirement a month later.\n\nSpeculation over a comeback had grown in recent weeks after Fury shared footage of himself training in Thailand alongside South African boxer Kevin Lerena.\n\nPosting on Instagram on Sunday, Fury said: \"2026 is that year. Return of the Mac. Been away for a while but I'm back now. 37 years old and still punching. Nothing better to do than punch men in the face & get paid for it.\"\n\nFury's return to the ring was widely expected. His most recent retirement was met with scepticism last year, given his history of reversals.\n\nHe previously stepped away from boxing after stopping Dillian Whyte at Wembley Stadium in April 2022, only to return six months later.\n\nQueensberry promoter Frank Warren said he expected Fury to fight again. Saudi Arabia powerbroker Turki Alalshikh had reportedly planned for Fury and long-time rival Anthony Joshua to take separate bouts in the Kingdom early in 2026 before finally meeting later in the year.\n\nJoshua fuelled that possibility after defeating Jake Paul in December, saying he was ready to face Fury next.\n\nThose plans are now uncertain after Joshua was injured in a car crash in Nigeria that claimed the lives of two close friends.\n\nFury enjoyed two reigns as heavyweight champion and boasts a professional record of 34 wins, two defeats - both against Usyk - and one draw with Deontay Wilder.\n\nHe stunned long-reigning champion Wladimir Klitschko in 2015 to claim the WBA (Super), IBF, WBO and The Ring heavyweight titles in Germany.\n\nAfter more than two and a half years away from the ring, during which he addressed mental health struggles, Fury returned in 2018 and regained world champion status by defeating Wilder in 2020 to win the WBC title.\n\nFury has spoken openly about wanting to avenge his defeats by Usyk, who currently holds the WBA (Super), WBC, IBF and WBO belts.\n\nThere appears to be limited appetite among fans for a trilogy, while the Ukrainian has indicated he would prefer to defend his titles against Wilder next.\n\nOne potential route to world-title contention could be a domestic clash with Fabio Wardley, the current WBO champion and another fighter promoted by Warren's Queensberry stable.\n\nBoxing schedule and results 2025\n\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "fullText": "TEL AVIV (AP) — Israel’s decision to revoke the licenses of more than three dozen humanitarian organizations this week has aid groups scrambling to grapple with what this means for their operations in Gaza and their ability to help tens of thousands of struggling Palestinians.\n\nThe 37 groups represent some of the most prominent of the more than 100 independent nongovernmental organizations working in Gaza, alongside United Nations agencies. Those banned include Doctors Without Borders, the Norwegian Refugee Council, Oxfam and Medical Aid for Palestinians.\n\nThe groups do everything from providing tents and water to supporting clinics and medical facilities. The overall impact, however, remains unclear.\n\nThe most immediate impact of the license revocation is that Israel will no longer allow the groups to bring supplies into the Gaza Strip or send international staffers into the territory. Israel says all suspended groups have to halt their operations by March 1.\n\nSome groups have already been barred from bringing in aid. The Norwegian Refugee Council, for example, said it has not been allowed to bring in supplies in 10 months, leaving it distributing tents and aid brought in by other groups.\n\nIsrael says the banned groups make up only a small part of aid operations in Gaza.\n\nBut aid officials say they fulfill crucial specific functions. In a joint statement Tuesday, the U.N. and leading NGOs said the organizations that are still licensed by Israel “are nowhere near the number required just to meet immediate and basic needs” in Gaza.\n\nThe ban further strains aid operations even as Gaza’s over 2 million Palestinians still face a humanitarian crisis more than 12 weeks into a ceasefire. The U.N. says that although famine has been staved off, more than a quarter of families still eat only one meal a day and food prices remain out of reach for many; more than 1 million people need better tents as winter storms lash the territory.\n\nWhy were their licenses revoked?\n\nEarlier this year, Israel introduced strict new registration requirements for aid agencies working in Gaza. Most notably, it required groups to provide the names and personal details of local and international staff and said it would ban groups for a long list of criticisms of Israel.\n\nThe registration process is overseen by Israel’s Ministry for Diaspora Affairs and Combating Antisemitism, led by a far-right member of the ruling Likud party.\n\nIsrael says the rules aim to prevent Hamas and other militants from infiltrating the groups, something it has said was happening throughout the 2-year-old war. The U.N., which leads the massive aid program in Gaza, and independent groups deny the allegations and Israeli claims of major diversion of aid supplies by Hamas.\n\nAid organizations say they did not comply, in part, because they feared that handing over staff information could endanger them. More than 500 aid workers have been killed in Gaza during the war, according to the United Nations.\n\nIsrael denies targeting aid workers. But the group say Israel has been vague about how it would use the data.\n\nThe groups also said Israel was vague about how it would use the data.\n\n“Demanding staff lists as a condition for access to territory is an outrageous overreach,” Doctors Without Borders, known by its French acronym MSF, said Friday. It said Israeli officials had refused its attempts to find alternatives.\n\nA December report on MSF issued by an Israeli government team recommended rejection of the group’s license. It pointed primarily to statements by the group criticizing Israel, including referring to its campaign in Gaza as genocide and calling its monthslong ban on food entering the territory earlier this year as “a starvation tactic.” It said the statements violated neutrality and constituted “delegitimization of Israel.”\n\nThe report also repeated claims that an MSF employee killed in by an Israeli airstrike in 2024 was an operative with the Islamic Jihad militant group. That, it said, suggested MSF “maintains connections with a terrorist group.”\n\nMSF on Friday denied the allegations, saying it would “never knowingly employ anyone involved in military activities.” It said that its statements cited by Israel simply described the destruction its teams witnessed in Gaza.\n\n“The fault lies with those committing these atrocities, not with those who speak of them,” it said.\n\nAid groups have a week from Dec. 31 to appeal the process.\n\nMedical services could see biggest impact\n\nIndependent NGOs play a major role in propping up Gaza’s health sector, devastated by two years of Israeli bombardment and restrictions on supplies.\n\nMSF said Israel’s decision would have a catastrophic impact on its work in Gaza, where it provides funding and international staff for six hospitals as well as running two field hospitals and eight primary health centers, clinics and medical points. It also runs two of Gaza’s five stabilization centers helping children with severe malnutrition.\n\nIts teams treated 100,000 trauma cases, performed surgeries on 10,000 patients and handled a third of Gaza’s births, the group says. It has 60 international staffers in the West Bank and Gaza and more than 1,200 local staff — most medical professionals.\n\nSince the ceasefire began in early October, MSF has brought in about 7% of the 2,239 tons (2,032 metric tonnes) of medical supplies that Israel has allowed into Gaza, according to a U.N. tracking dashboard. That makes it the largest provider of medical supplies after U.N. agencies and the Red Cross, according to the dashboard.\n\nMedecins du Monde, another group whose license is being halted, runs another four primary health clinics.\n\nAid groups say the most immediate impact will likely be the inability to send international staff into Gaza.\n\nForeign staff provide key technical expertise and emotional support for their Palestinian colleagues.\n\n“Having international presence in Gaza is a morale booster for our staff who are already feeling isolated,” said Shaina Low, communications adviser for the Norwegian Refugee Council, which is one of the main NGOs providing shelter supplies and fresh water to displaced people.\n\nNRC has roughly 30 international staff who rotate in and out of Gaza working alongside some 70 Palestinians.\n\nWhile any operations by the 37 groups in the West Bank will likely remain open, those with offices in east Jerusalem, which Israel considers its territory, might have to close.\n\nMany of the 37 groups already had been blocked from bringing supplies into Gaza since March, said Bushra Khalidi, Oxfam's policy lead for Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories.\n\nWhat changes with the formal license revocation is “that these practices are now formalized, giving Israel full impunity to restrict operations and shut out organizations it disagrees with,” she said.\n\nSome of the groups have turned to buying supplies within Gaza rather than bringing them in, but that is slower and more expensive, she said. Other groups dug into reserve stocks, pared down distribution and had to work with broken or heavily repaired equipment because they couldn’t bring in new ones.\n\nAmed Khan, an American humanitarian philanthropist who has been privately donating medicine and emergency nutrition for children to Gaza, said the impact extends beyond the aid groups.\n\nHe relies on NGOs to receive and distribute the supplies, but the fewer groups that Israel approves, the harder it is to find one.\n\n“It’s death by bureaucracy,” he said.",

    "title": "I won the Microsoft Excel World Championship. Here's what every office worker should know about Excel.",
    "description": "Diarmuid Early won first place in the 2025 Microsoft Excel World Championship. He has some pointers for using Excel at work.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Diarmuid Early, the 40-year-old winner of the 2025 Microsoft Excel World Championship. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI've been in the Excel business for about 20 years.\n\nI played around with it a little bit in college and started using it professionally at Boston Consulting Group. Then I spent 10 years at Deutsche Bank as a business manager. It was lots of data analysis and reporting on financials.\n\nI've been doing my own thing for about six years now, so I've pretty much used Excel my entire career.\n\nWinning the Excel World Championship felt great. I've been a long-term underperformer in the postseason. I've been first or second seed going into the knockouts every year. I've made it to the final stage in Las Vegas the last couple of years, but I think fifth was my best finish before.\n\nMy number one tip for office workers is to believe that there is a better way.\n\nWhenever you find, 'Oh god, I've been copying and pasting this for the last 10 minutes, and I still have 15 minutes to go,' whenever you find yourself doing something that is manual and repetitive, it is very likely that Excel has a better way to do it.\n\nIt is very likely that, if you ask Google or ChatGPT a brief description of what you need, 1,000 or more other people have wanted to do the same thing over the years.\n\nIn my experience, 80% of the things I've ever struggled with in Excel, if I Google it with a reasonably crisp description, there's a post out there somewhere saying how to do it.\n\nLearning to use the SUMIFS function is probably going to take you longer the first time than just doing it yourself. But it's going to be a little bit faster the second time, a lot faster the third time, and one bajillion times faster over the thousand times you have to do it over your career.\n\nIt's also much less likely to be wrong or have unexplainable errors that you will get if you're doing it manually.\n\nIt'll take you a little longer the first time, but if you're the most junior, new employee at a company, they kind of expect you to be stupid and take ages to do things. If you are stupid and take ages the first time, and the second time you do it 10 times faster, the payoff over six months, not to mention your career, is pretty huge.\n\nAs you start to learn more of those things and start to stitch them together to do more complex things, the payoff is exponential.\n\nIt's great to be able to very, very quickly zoom through and say, \"The answer is seven.\" If you get to that quickly, you get more time to say: \"Does it make any sense that the answer is seven?\"\n\nIt's the thing that the junior bankers, the junior consultants, are least likely to do. They see it as their job to turn the crank on the model, hand over the answer, and the next person above them on the chain says: What does this mean? What's the insight? Does it make sense?\n\nTaking the time to do that yourself and then communicating that gets you a lot more credibility. It also makes you a lot more likely to spot your own stupid mistakes until someone spots them for you.\n\nThe thing that I find most horrifying is when I see a formula that is 50 different numbers together in the form: A1 + B3 + C5 + D10. Someone has obviously hand-typed them all or, plus click plus click plus click.\n\nThe amount of time that takes, and the chances that you will misclick one time and have something wrong you'll never be able to find, is really high.\n\nThat's one of the more entry-level ways to go down a dark path. There's basically, at every level of Excel skill, there's the thing you're doing wrong that you don't realize you're doing wrong until you get to the next level. There are problems all the way up.\n\nWhen it gets there, I think AI will be very helpful in taking people from bad to not bad, or maybe even bad to good. It's probably not going to be much help to people like me who are already quite experienced.\n\nIf it gets to a level where it can teach me new things in Excel, then there's not much room left for human Excel users.\n\nI've got 50,000 hacks. I used to do a lot of Excel training in my BCG days. Every now and again you would teach someone something, and you'd see this look of combined joy and horror on their face. You subsequently find out: \"This is the thing that, if I knew this last night, I would not have had to work until 2 a.m..\"\n\nThat is the person who will never forget what you just taught them.",

    "fullText": "A group of about 20 US investors is already planning to travel to Venezuela in March, following Saturday's news that the country's president, Nicolás Maduro, had been taken into US custody.\n\nCharles Myers, the chairman of the political risk advisory firm Signum Global Advisors and a former vice-chairman of the investment advisory firm Evercore, told Business Insider that the mood among investors he has spoken to is one of \"cautious optimism\" following news of Maduro's ouster.\n\n\"I think the centerpiece of Venezuela's success, looking out 12 months or even 24 months, is foreign investment,\" Myers said. \"A big part of the Venezuela story, starting today, is foreign investment, especially in oil and gas, which is pretty straightforward, but there are massive opportunities in construction, in tourism.\"\n\nMyers said it's not the responsibility of his firm to take a \"moral position\" on whether it was right or wrong for the US to involve itself in Venezuela's government, but rather to help the firm's clients anticipate investment opportunities or mitigate risk due to geopolitical events.\n\nHowever, he added, his firm \"very much expected\" the situation in Venezuela would unfold as it has, and has been preparing investor groups to be ready to travel to the country when the opportunity presents itself. Signum previously hosted similar trips for asset managers and hedge funds to visit Syria and Ukraine.\n\n\"People have seen this coming, especially very smart investors, and many of them have actually bought bonds in anticipation of this,\" Myers said. \"But there's a very strong degree of cautious optimism, even more so than we saw with Syria, just because this is a United States-directed action.\"\n\n\"The United States will play a pivotal role in everything, especially the Venezuelan economy, starting today,\" Myers added, \"So, I think the reaction has been more enthusiastic than perhaps other situations like this.\"",

    "description": "Despite the promise of alleviating the main memory bottleneck, and the existence of commercial hardware implementations, techniques for Near-Data Processing have seen relatively little real-world deployment. The idea has received renewed interest with the appearance of disaggregated or \"far\" memory, for example in the use of CXL memory pools.\n  However, we argue that the lack of a clear OS-centric abstraction of Near-Data Processing is a major barrier to adoption of the technology. Inspired by the channel controllers which interface the CPU to disk drives in mainframe systems, we propose memory channel controllers as a convenient, portable, and virtualizable abstraction of Near-Data Processing for modern disaggregated memory systems.\n  In addition to providing a clean abstraction that enables OS integration while requiring no changes to CPU architecture, memory channel controllers incorporate another key innovation: they exploit the cache coherence provided by emerging interconnects to provide a much richer programming model, with more fine-grained interaction, than has been possible with existing designs.",

    "fullText": "María Corina Machado released a letter addressing the Venezuelan people after leader Nicolás Maduro and his wife were captured in a U.S. operation overnight Saturday.\n\nMachado, an opposition leader who has mostly been in hiding over the last year, said Maduro will \"face international justice for the atrocious crimes committed against Venezuelans and against citizens of many other nations.\"\n\n\"The time for freedom has come!\" Machado, who was awarded the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize, wrote in the letter posted on X.\n\nIt was not clear on Saturday if Machado, who escaped to Norway in a secret mission last month, was in Venezuela. She told CBS News in mid-December that she was \"absolutely\" supportive of President Trump's increasing military pressure on the Maduro regime and said she would welcome \"more and more pressure so that Maduro understands that he has to go.\"\n\nRead the full text of her letter, translated by CBS News, below.\n\nMaría Corina Machado's letter to Venezuelans\n\nVenezuelans, The time for freedom has come!\n\nNicolás Maduro from today will face international justice for the atrocious crimes committed against Venezuelans and against citizens of many other nations. Given his refusal to accept a negotiated solution, the United States government has fulfilled its promise to enforce the law.\n\nThe time has come for popular sovereignty and national sovereignty to prevail in our country. We are going to restore order, release the political prisoners, build an exceptional country, and bring our children back home.\n\nWe have fought for years, we have given it our all, and it has been worth it. What was meant to happen is happening.\n\nThis is the hour of the citizens. Those of us who risked everything for democracy on June 28th. Those of us who elected Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia as the legitimate President of Venezuela, who must immediately assume his constitutional mandate and be recognized as Commander-in-Chief of the National Armed Forces by all the officers and soldiers who comprise it.\n\nToday we are ready to assert our mandate and take power. Let us remain vigilant, active, and organized until the democratic transition is complete. A transition that needs ALL of us.\n\nTo the Venezuelans who are currently in our country, be ready to put into action what we will be communicating to you very soon through our official channels.\n\nTo Venezuelans abroad, we need you to be mobilized, engaging the governments and citizens of the world and committing them from now on to the great operation of building the new Venezuela.\n\nIn these crucial hours, receive all my strength, my confidence, and my affection. We remain vigilant and in contact.\n\nVENEZUELA WILL BE FREE!

    "description": "The world may no longer fully live in the grip of COVID-19, but another heavily contagious disease is currently spreading through U.S. airports.",
    "fullText": "In 2020, COVID-19 caused travel restrictions and other changes to how people get around. Avoiding getting sick while traveling is tricky, as COVID-19, flu, and common colds easily spread when dozens of people sit shoulder to shoulder inside planes, trains, or buses. However, another disease has added itself to the list. Measles is on the rise, and health officials have detected it in airports.\n\nThe New Jersey Department of Health sent a press release stating that it detected measles in a traveler who was at the Newark Liberty International Airport on December 12, 2025. The department has undertaken contact tracing efforts in case the passenger infected others. Another case appeared in a passenger who flew to and from Boston Logan International Airport (one of the busiest in the country) on December 11 and 12.\n\nThe Massachusetts Department of Public Health sent a press release of its own. The press release emphasized that measles is preventable through vaccines, making the nationwide rise in cases all the more surprising. Per the Centers for Disease Control, over 2,000 people in the U.S. tested positive for measles in 2025, numbers not seen since 1992.\n\nGavi, an organization working to increase medical vaccine access worldwide, explained that measles is the most contagious virus based on how many others just one person can infect, a measurement called R0. Like COVID-19 and the flu, measles spreads through particles in the air after someone carrying the disease coughs or sneezes. Its particles also linger in the air for up to two hours, meaning you can catch measles even without direct contact. After around two centuries of documented measles existence, researchers created a vaccine in the 1960s.\n\nVaccine skeptics have long existed around the world, but recent years have seen a higher percentage of parents choosing not to vaccinate their children. Gavi attributes this to vaccine misinformation, the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, and other global crises. Multiple health officials have publicly tried to ease people's minds by stating that vaccines are safe and effective as long as enough members of a population receive them.\n\nGetting measles despite being vaccinated is incredibly uncommon, but all travelers can take solace in the fact that cases are still fairly low nationwide. If you think you might be sick, wearing a mask can prevent you from spreading anything.\n\nReady to discover more hidden gems and expert travel tips?

    "fullText": "The novelty of eating at a diner owned by the richest person in the world seems to have worn off in just a few months\n\nLess than six months since it opened, Elon Musk’s Tesla Diner has the feel of a ghost town. Gone is the Optimus robot serving popcorn, gone are the carnivore-diet-inspired “Epic Bacon” strips, gone are the hours-long, hundred-person lines wrapped around the block. Even the restaurant’s all-star chef, Eric Greenspan, is gone. The Hollywood burger-and-fries shop seems like a shell of the bustling eatery it was when it opened in late July.\n\nOn a balmy Friday afternoon in December, the parking lot for Tesla car charging was, at best, half full. Inside what the company describes as a “retro-futuristic” diner, a handful of people trickled in, ordering burgers and hotdogs or asking for merch. The upstairs deck, AKA “Skypad”, was vacant except for a pair of employees stringing holiday lights. More staff was busy at work, buffing fingerprints off the chrome walls and taking out the trash, than there were customers. The diner was spotless.\n\nThe novelty of eating at a restaurant owned by the richest person in the world seems to have worn off. When the Tesla diner opened in summer, it brought in droves of the CEO’s fans and curious onlookers. But then came the onsite anti-Musk protests, noise complaints from neighbors and customers who said menu items often sold out or, when they were available, were served soggy and cold.\n\nGreenspan, a graduate of Le Cordon Bleu who helped launch the Mr Beast Burger chain, told the Los Angeles Times last month that he was leaving the Tesla Diner to focus on opening a Jewish deli called Mish. According to Eater, the chef removed his previous Instagram posts referencing the Tesla Diner as a newly minted ex-boyfriend might.\n\nGreenspan has not publicly said why he left and did not return a request for comment. Tesla also did not return a request for comment.\n\nGreenspan and other California restaurateurs who praised the Tesla Diner faced pushback for supporting Musk. The Tesla CEO is seen as a polarizing figure who donated nearly $300m to get Donald Trump elected and then led the so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) in its rapid and haphazard teardown of federal agencies. During a speech at Trump’s inauguration, Musk made what rights groups have described as back-to-back Nazi salutes – something repeatedly portrayed in the picket signs held by Tesla Diner protesters.\n\nMusk has been talking about the concept of a 50s-style Tesla diner in LA since at least 2018 as part of an idea to have amenities for waiting drivers connected to Supercharger stations. He touted the plans for it in 2023 as “Grease meets The Jetsons with Supercharging” and claimed the diner would launch later that year. When it finally did open in the summer of 2025, he called it “one of the coolest spots in LA” and vowed that if the concept went well Tesla would open diners in major cities around the world. So far, there is only one.\n\n“This is a pretty special diner. If you are in the LA area, it’s worth visiting,” Musk said on Tesla’s second-quarter earnings call, just two days after the diner opened. “It’s a shining beacon of hope in an otherwise bleak urban landscape.”\n\nThe diner received immense media coverage upon opening but poor reviews from restaurant critics, who described the food as forgettable and the concept as little more than a corporate branding exercise. Its menu consisted of fast-food staples like a $13.50 smash burger, AKA “Tesla Giga Burger”, and an $8 milkshake, along with more internet-coded foods like the $12 maple-glazed “Epic Bacon” strips and a small-sized $8 “Wagyu Beef Chili Cup”.\n\nA display case with Tesla merchandise featured a “levitating Cybertruck” figurine for $175 and a black hoodie emblazoned with a graphic of the diner for $95.\n\nTesla posted on X in October that it had sold 50,000 burgers since its opening – an average of a little over 700 a day. Musk proclaimed that month that the diner was a success and suggested that he would open others near Tesla offices in Palo Alto and Austin. Tesla has yet to announce any formal plans for expansion.\n\nOn social media, the wave of food influencers making TikTok and Instagram videos about the diner slowed in the months after its opening. Reviewers commenting on the $13 hotdog or posing next to the giant drive-in screens playing Star Trek are now relatively rare. Musk, who usually posts dozens of times a day on X, has only made scant mentions of the diner on the platform and didn’t address it on Tesla’s third quarter earnings call in October.\n\nThe diner also appears to have pivoted to hosting some events, including a “Holiday Bash on The Skypad” in mid-December featuring unlimited Tesla food and beverages, plus a live DJ, for $75 a ticket.\n\nAs the diner narrows its ambitions, some of the customer complaints have likewise waned. The pared down menu is fully stocked, and food came out hot and fast on the balmy Friday in December. One enthusiastic Yelp reviewer said she recently visited the diner on a Saturday night. She posted a photo of her meal, saying “the burger was solid and the fries were perfectly crispy”.\n\n“Best part was that it wasn’t crowded at all,” she added.",

They were also built at a fraction of the cost and computing power that major US tech companies invest to build LLMs. The result: a massive sell-off on January 27 wiped out nearly US$1 trillion in tech stocks, including US$600 billion from Nvidia alone.\n\nAnalysts expected the momentum of Chinese AI companies to continue this year, thanks to Beijing's policy support, improved funding prospects, greater adoption of AI systems across industries and a growing number of talent being recruited for innovative projects.\n\nA domestic AI start-up's co-founder, who declined to be identified, predicted that China would overtake the US to become \"the world's leading AI power in 2027\". China's advantage was its deep talent pool, according to the co-founder.\n\nIn his New Year's address, Chinese President Xi Jinping pointed out that the domestic market has \"many large AI models competing in a race to the top\", while new breakthroughs were being achieved in domestic semiconductor development. All of that \"has turned China into one of the economies with the fastest growing innovation capabilities\", Xi said.\n\nDeepSeek founder and CEO Liang Wenfeng.

    "fullText": "When booking your next flight in the US, Delta Air Lines might be your best bet for a timely arrival.\n\nIn 2025, it was the most on-time airline in the US and the 10th most punctual in the world, according to a newly released annual report from aviation analytics company Cirium.\n\nTop carriers often benefit from large, well-organized hubs, simpler networks, or hubs concentrated in regions with fewer weather-related disruptions. The rankings are based on on-time arrivals — defined as flights arriving within 15 minutes of their scheduled arrival time — and also reflect cancellations.\n\nIn 2025, Delta achieved an on-time performance rate of 80.9%, down about 2.5% from 2024. Still, roughly 8 in 10 flights arrived on schedule — and the carrier handled just over 1.8 million flights, compared to about 200,000 each by Aeromexico and Saudia, per Cirium.\n\nAccording to the aviation data company OAG, 80% or better is considered \"pretty good,\" while only the very best carriers hit 90% or higher.\n\nDelta remains among the world's most punctual airlines, though it slipped from No. 3 globally in 2024 to No. 10 globally in 2025. It did not receive Cirium's \"Platinum Award for Operational Excellence\" in 2025, despite earning it annually from 2021 to 2024.\n\nQatar Airways — boasting an over 200-strong aircraft fleet out of its sprawling Doha hub — won Cirium's top award, which goes to an airline that excels in punctuality, network efficiency, operational scale, and recovery from disruptions.\n\n\"The airline product is the schedule,\" Cirium's chief marketing officer Mike Malik said during a press conference. \"I keep emphasizing that. And when an airline understands that the schedule is what they're selling, they focus on that; they just become a better operation.\"\n\nAlaska Airlines came in second in the US with a 79.2% on-time rate. It knocked United Airlines, which faced significant air traffic control issues at its Newark, New Jersey, hub over the summer, down to fourth from its No.-2 spot in 2024. The airlines operated about 453,000 and 1.7 million flights last year, respectively.\n\nUS carriers overall experienced heightened operational pressure last year due to sustained air traffic controller shortages and a 43-day government shutdown, the longest in US history.\n\nOne airline, however, unexpectedly made the podium: budget competitor Spirit Airlines. In a turbulent year that included re-entering bankruptcy, Spirit jumped three spots to third place in the US with an on-time rate of 78.8% in 2025.\n\nThe improvement followed the airline's exit from several airports and the sale of dozens of planes to simplify its network and bolster cash flow.\n\n\"There has been a focus at Spirit Airlines to get their operation together for the past 14 months or so,\" Malik said. \"We've seen increases and them posting good numbers, but some of it has to, obviously, do with the fact that they are a much smaller operation and much more tightly controlled.\"\n\nHere is the list of the top 8 most on-time US airlines for 2025:\n\nAmong global carriers, the cream of the crop for 2025 was Aeromexico, with a 90.0% on-time arrival rate. Saudia took second place at 86.5%, and Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) came in third at 86.1%. This marks the second consecutive year that Aeromexico and Saudia have earned gold and silver.\n\nThree regional carriers — regional in the geographic sense, not regional jets or feeder airlines — performed even better than Aeromexico: South Africa's Safair at 91.1%, Royal Jordanian at 90.7%, and Panama's Copa Airlines at 90.8%.\n\nDespite beating Aeromexico, these carriers do not qualify for the top three spots because Cirium does not classify them as \"global\" airlines due to their fewer flights and less complex international networks. Cirium shows Safair, Royal Jordanian, and Copa flew about 63,000, 37,000, and 134,000 flights last year, respectively.\n\nElsewhere in the world, Cirium listed low-cost carrier Iberia Express, owned by the Spanish flag carrier Iberia, as the most reliable airline in Europe for 2025, with an on-time rate of 88.9%. Philippine Airlines won in the Asia Pacific region at 83.1%.\n\nVirgin Atlantic was named the \"most improved,\" jumping 9.44 percentage points from 74.0% in 2024 to 83.5% in 2025.\n\nHere is the list of the top 10 most on-time global airlines for 2025:\n\nThe world's most punctual airlines have networks anchored around large, highly optimized hubs — like Copa in Panama City, Aeromexico in Mexico City, or Royal Jordanian in Amman — or deliberately spread across a small number of coordinated airports.\n\nSAS, for example, balances traffic across Stockholm, Oslo, and Copenhagen, limiting bottlenecks. Safair, with the smallest operation among the top three regionals, primarily flies domestically, simplifying its network.\n\nThese airlines also benefit from generally less-constrained air traffic control systems compared to those in the US, as well as from locations that largely avoid cascading weather disruptions.\n\nSAS' primary airports, meanwhile, are purpose-built for winter operations.\n\nUS carriers American, Delta, and United, by comparison, each operate at least eight major hubs across widely different climates — from wildfires in California and hurricanes in Florida to winter storms in the Northeast and the heat in Texas — making disruption recovery far more complex.",

    "description": "What is the current status of democracy in the world?",
    "fullText": "What is the current status of democracy in the world?\n\nIn its 2025 report, V-Dem, a Swedish independent research organization, concluded there were more dictatorial states (91) than democracies (88) for the first time since 2002.\n\nThe report warned that those numbers underscore the serious decline of democracy around the world.\n\nAfter an apparent victory over communism with the end of the Cold War, democracy now faces a major challenge.\n\nThe benefits of globalization did not reach all citizens, leading to a maldistribution of wealth.\n\nThe dissatisfaction and hatred toward existing political parties and society of those who feel left behind have been amplified through social media, widening the division.\n\nOn the other hand, authoritarian governments monitor their citizens to shut off opposing opinions. Under tight state control, decisions are quickly made, giving the impression of “efficiency.”\n\nMany people likely hold doubts as to whether democracy is something that should be protected.\n\nThe values of this government system can be found in “Democracy,” a textbook for junior and senior high schools that was published by the old education ministry soon after the end of World War II.\n\nAt that time, expectations for a fresh start in Japan were heightened as the people were liberated from oppression and a lack of freedom.\n\nSTRENGTHS OF DEMOCRATIC NATIONS\n\nIn a democracy, where citizens are respected as individuals, a major strength is the freedom and equality that lie in its roots.\n\nWhile time may be required to thoroughly discuss all decisions on policy matters, democracy does have the ability to correct mistakes.\n\nFor example, elections can oust corrupt politicians.\n\nAnd policy toward the Vietnam War by the United States, which had covered up the facts, changed course through the outcry of its citizens.\n\nIn dictatorships, those in power shut down those who criticize government mistakes, making corrections impossible to achieve.\n\nThe website for the American Center managed by the U.S. State Department and U.S. Embassy once had a section that defined democracy as a system placing the government under the control of laws and allowing all citizens equal protection under the law.\n\nThe section also explained that majority rule was respected in a democracy, but that the fundamental rights of individuals and minority groups would be earnestly protected.\n\nBut in 2025, the pages containing such definitions were deleted. It is not clear if the deletions were related to the second inauguration of U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nAlthough the United States led the way after World War II in creating an international order based on the rule of law, the Trump administration’s National Security Strategy released in November declared, “The days of the United States propping up the entire world order like Atlas are over.”\n\nTrump is also moving to destroy the separation of powers, brazenly interfering in the judicial branch by firing prosecutors who previously investigated allegations against him.\n\nIn our New Year editorial for 2023, we expressed concerns about the decline of democracy, but we also displayed expectations for its recovery.\n\nThe situation, however, has worsened since then.\n\nAfter the Trump administration ended overseas support activities through the U.S. Agency for International Development, assistance toward democratic movements in Southeast Asia has stalled to the advantage of China and Russia.\n\nIn European nations, such as Germany and France, ultraright, anti-immigrant parties have increased their popularity.\n\nIn its 2022 report, the U.S. nongovernmental organization Freedom House listed four indices for determining if democratic nations were moving toward authoritarianism.\n\nThe first was “undermining the rule of law” by politicians and governments through the weakening of judicial independence.\n\nThe second was “perverting elections” to undercut public faith in democratic balloting through opaque financing and manipulation of electoral rules.\n\nThe third was “attacking media freedom” by targeting journalists and blocking access to information.\n\nThe fourth was “discrimination and mistreatment of migrants” and marginalized communities.\n\nThe “Democracy” textbook published after World War II also pointed to the fragility of democracy, warning that even in a democratized Japan, dictatorship could rear its ugly head at any time and from anywhere.\n\nThe textbook stressed the need for citizens to have a critical state of mind and awareness of that weakness of democracy.\n\nANTI-DEMOCRATIC TRENDS IN JAPAN\n\nDemocracy is also wavering in Japan.\n\nIf we use the four indices, rule of law is threatened by the proposal of Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s administration to create an anti-spying law, which could narrow the rights of citizens.\n\nA law enacted in 2014 to protect specially designated secrets has already affected reporting activities. The anti-spying legislation could further strengthen restrictions on free speech under the excuse of protecting Japan from foreign nations.\n\nThe Liberal Democratic Party is reluctant to further investigate money scandals by its lawmakers, while a proposal to revise the electoral system would be advantageous to the ruling coalition and could arbitrarily eliminate small parties.\n\nA government panel has also started work on restricting entry into Japan by foreigners, a policy that could further spread xenophobia around Japan.\n\nPopulism that gains support through xenophobia and chest-pumping arguments is also spreading into Japan. This reflects the distortions in politics and society that fuel dissatisfaction among the public with their daily lives.\n\nCan those distortions be corrected? Or will populist politicians use them to further agitate fear?\n\nIf nothing is done and division deepens, “other people” could be viewed as a hated enemy, and an authoritarian atmosphere would strengthen under such circumstances.\n\nDemocracy, however, has shown the ability to recover from past difficulties.\n\nAlthough viewpoints and perspectives may differ in a democracy, respect has been shown for the other party, and common ground is sought through dialogue in search of compromise.\n\nPoliticians and citizens should once again recognize this principle and strength and avoid falling into the trap of division.",

    "description": "A new country is gearing up to unveil the world's second-fastest commercial transport train, and despite their reputation with technology, it isn't Japan.",
    "fullText": "There are plenty of mistakes people make while traveling by train. Pick the cheapest ride, and you'll probably be stuck on a train moving slower than drying paint. Pick the wrong type of train, and you could be spending money faster than the blink of an eye. Knowing how to choose the right type of long-distance train is crucial, and when it comes to train systems, Asia's dominance in the sector far exceeds any other continent worldwide. China currently has the top spot for the most bullet trains, as well as the fastest, and this country will soon offer the world's second-fastest train, and no, it's not Japan.\n\nSouth Korea's government and the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport just revealed on December 22 that the world's second-fastest bullet train is scheduled to join its fleet in 2030 for test operations, and expect it to be fully commercialized for the public by 2031. Capable of speeds reaching a staggering 230 miles-per-hour (370 kilometers-per-hour), the new EMU-370 train is a next generation high-speed train that's going to put South Korea on the map when it comes to bullet trains that promise lightning-fast trips.\n\nKorea Railroad Research Institute (KRRI), along with seven public and private organizations, led a national research and development program spanning the length of three years from April 2022 to December 2025, to design the highly anticipated EMU-370 train project that cost a total of 15.23 million dollars (22.5 billion Korean won). The EMU-370 was designed to have a fully functional top speed of up to 253 miles-per-hour (407 kilometers-per-hour), making the trip from Seoul to Busan in just under two hours, when typically it would take two-and-a-half hours.\n\nOne of the best places to take a day trip if you're staying in Seoul, is the coastal town of Busan, which will now be more accessible than ever. Currently, the EMU-320 (KTX-Cheongyong) is South Korea's fastest train, however the EMU-370's impressive stats speak for themselves. Set to seat 479 passengers with a two decibel reduced indoor noise level, and a motor capacity of 560 kilowatts, the EMU-370 puts out 47.4% more power to the equivalent of about 75 midsize family sedans with a sleek aerodynamic design, making it the sportscar of the train world.\n\nCurrently, China's CR450 high-speed train is in testing, with speeds reaching approximately 249 miles-per-hour (400 kilometers-per-hour), and is the world's leading passenger bullet train, which is set to launch in 2027 for commercialized public use. Other countries that have bullet trains, such as France, Germany, and Japan, who were the first to have a bullet train in 1964 called the Shinkansen, reach a top speed of approximately 200 miles-per-hour (320 kilometers-per-hour).\n\nWith technological advances in rail speeds, tracks must also naturally be upgraded. According to the head of the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport's Railway Bureau, there must be significant improvements before the EMU-370 can reach full speed. Without halting operations of the railway, replacing ballast tracks with concrete tracks on some sections will be done during a four-hour period in which trains do not run. The ministry official stated they expect South Korea's high-speed rail to exceed 217 miles-per-hour (350 kilometers-per-hour) in the near future, which would secure South Korea's spot as a top player within the high-speed railway sector for years to come.\n\nReady to discover more hidden gems and expert travel tips?

Investigators said Kennedy refused, pulled a knife from his jacket, and ignored repeated commands to drop it.\n\nAn officer used a Taser to stun the armed man but he kept moving towards another officer. A 43-year-old officer fired his gun. Four shots were fired. Officers provided aid, but Kennedy was pronounced dead at the scene. A knife was later recovered.\n\nAuthorities said Kennedy was homeless. No officers were injured. The fatal shooting remains under investigation by county detectives, with findings to be reviewed by the St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney’s Office once the case is complete.\n\nSt. Louis Lambert Airport released this statement:\n\n“The entire airport community is saddened by the events of November 21st.

    "description": "Many of MTV's last 24-hour music channels around the world are set to stop broadcasting after today, Dec. 31, 2025.",
    "fullText": "MTV will shut down many of its last dedicated 24-hour music channels after today, Dec. 31.\n\nThe move, announced back in October, will affect channels around the world, with the U.K. seeing five different MTV stations going dark. These include MTV Music, MTV 80s, MTV 90s, Club MTV, and MTV Live. As Consequence notes, MTV Music — which launched in 2011 — notably ended its run by airing the Buggles’ “Video Killed the Radio Star,” the first visual to air when MTV launched in the United States in 1981.\n\nMTV’s parent company, Paramount Skydance, is also expected to shutter music-only channels in Australia, Poland, France, and Brazil. Reps for MTV in the U.S. did not immediately return a request for comment regarding the full slate of channels that are set to go dark.\n\nDespite axing much of its dedicated music programming, MTV’s flagship channels are still expected to keep broadcasting in the U.K. and elsewhere. Like in the U.S., these channels primarily air massively popular reality programs, as opposed to music videos.\n\nThe changes at MTV come as Paramount Skydance aims to cut costs following its blockbuster (and controversial) merger earlier this year. But CEO David Ellison is reportedly still keen on revitalizing MTV and other cable channels, though it’s still unclear exactly what that will entail.\n\nIn September, The Wall Street Journal reported that Ellison had fielded ideas for MTV from major players in the music industry like Irving Azoff, Lucian Grainge, and some big-name artists. There have also reportedly been discussions about turning MTV into an online streaming service that could potentially rival Spotify or YouTube.\n\nThe decision to cut MTV’s musical-only channels wasn’t the only cost-cutting measure the Paramount took this year. Back in February, when the Skydance merger was still in the works, MTV announced that it would shutter several awards shows, including the MTV Europe Music Awards and MTV Latin America’s MIAW Awards (formerly known as the Millennial Awards).",

    "description": "The 48th edition of the world's biggest cross-country rally is nearly upon us. Here’s a look at the main contenders for victory in Dakar",
    "fullText": "The 2026 Dakar Rally is shaping up to deliver one of the most closely fought battles in recent years. Ford and Dacia arrive in Saudi Arabia determined to apply the lessons they learned on their debut last year with the aim of ending Toyota’s dominance in the world’s most prestigious rally-raid. Toyota isn’t standing still either, and has introduced an all-new car to maintain its position at the front.\n\nThe rally itself features several changes, with both the route and the format having been altered by organiser ASO to add a fresh challenge.\n\nFollowing the ceremonial start and Prologue on 3 January, competitors will tackle nearly 8,000km across two weeks, crossing some of the most unforgiving terrain in the Middle East.\n\nHere’s a list of drivers considered to be the favourites for top honours in the Ultimate category:\n\nOne of the prime contenders for the 2026 Dakar Rally is reigning champion Yazeed Al-Rajhi. The Saudi billionaire had always been rapid in cross-country rallying, with Dakar’s move to his home country in 2020 cementing his position as a frontrunner. But last year he made the biggest strides, combining his raw pace with improved maturity to secure a maiden win against factory competition. Back at the wheel of a Toyota and supported by the highly experienced Overdrive customer team, he has all the ingredients required to defend his crown.\n\nThat said, the 44-year-old’s build-up to this year’s event has been far from ideal. A heavy crash at Baja Aragon in April left him with fractured vertebrae, forcing a lengthy spell on the sidelines. He returned to competition in Portugal with a subdued 22nd-place finish before his preparations suffered another setback when he retired from Rally Morocco.\n\nToyota’s charge in Dakar will be spearheaded by Henk Lategan. At 31 years of age, he is one of the younger drivers in the field, but with four Dakar appearances already under his belt, he appears ready to finally seal the crown. The South African proved in 2025 that he is capable of fighting for the overall victory, as he went toe-to-toe with the more experienced Al-Rajhi and claimed two individual stage wins along the way. Missing out on the top spot by just under four minutes will have only sharpened his determination to go one better this time around.\n\nToyota has a new weapon in Dakar this year in the form of the GR DKR Hilux, which features a lighter tubular chassis and reinforced transmission. The Japanese manufacturer has won Dakar three times in the last four years, and the updated model based on the Hilux pick-up will help stave off competition from newer rivals.\n\nIf there is one driver the Dakar field can never afford to underestimate, it is Nasser Al-Attiyah. The Qatari has been a relentless winning force over the past decade and arrives in 2026 determined to reclaim the crown after two comparatively difficult campaigns in 2024 and 2025. While Stephane Peterhansel’s record of eight outright victories in cars remains some distance away, Al-Attiyah could enhance his legacy by winning the rally with a fourth different manufacturer after his previous triumphs with Volkswagen, Mini and Toyota. Further, he is just one stage win away from leapfrogging both Peterhansel and Ari Vatanen to become the most successful Dakar driver in that metric.\n\nAl-Attiyah will also be able to benefit from an improved Dacia Sandrider, which won in both Abu Dhabi and Morocco last year after a rather underwhelming debut in Dakar at the start of the 2025 season.\n\nCarlos Sainz Sr. shows no signs of slowing as he prepares for his 19th Dakar Rally start at the age of 63. Sainz became the oldest driver to win the world’s most prestigious cross-country rally when he won the 2024 edition at the wheel of the Audi RS Q e-tron. His 2025 outing was cut short by a crash on Stage 2, but he is back this year to gun for a fifth overall victory.\n\nWinning Dakar with Ford would bring his career a full circle, having made his WRC debut back in 1987 at the wheel of a Cosworth-powered Sierra. Sainz also never managed to win a WRC title with the American marque (his 1990 and ‘92 championships were won with Toyota), so a Dakar triumph with Raptor would be one of the most satisfying achievements of his illustrious career.\n\nRally legend Sebastien Loeb arrives at Dakar with renewed momentum after closing out the 2025 World Rally-Raid Championship with three consecutive podiums, including a victory in the season-ending Morocco Rally. That should give him some encouragement after his most recent Dakar outing ended early due to car damage. Loeb will also have a new co-driver in the form of Al-Attiyah’s former navigator Edouard Boulanger. After a run of misfortune earlier in 2025, Loeb felt a reset was required, leading to a split with Fabian Lurquin, who has moved across to partner Al-Attiyah in a direct swap between the pair.\n\nIt remains to be seen if Dacia can build on its recent success and take on Toyota on the biggest stage, but a maiden Dakar victory for Loeb would be huge for his career, especially after Sebastien Ogier drew level with him on nine World Rally Championship titles in 2025.\n\nMattias Ekstrom’s recent Dakar form has been so convincing that he is now viewed less as a two-time DTM champion and more as a genuine rally-raid specialist. The Swede has shown a remarkable ability to adapt to new disciplines, a trait underlined in 2022 when he beat his more experienced Audi team-mates to finish ninth overall on debut.\n\nThat adaptability was again on display in 2025 when, after ending a decades-long association with Audi, he guided the factory Ford team to the podium, finishing behind only the dominant Toyotas of Al-Rajhi and Lategan.\n\nHow Ekstrom builds on that impressive performance will be one of the key storylines in 2026, particularly if Ford can produce a package capable of taking the Hilux head-on in Saudi Arabia.\n\nBeyond the established leading sextet, several other drivers on the entry list are capable of springing a surprise in 2026. Toyota driver Seth Quintero, for instance, will be a much more potent force in his third outing in the Ultimate category. Also stepping into a bigger role is two-time bike champion Toby Price, whose impressive Dakar debut in the car category with Overdrive last year earned him a promotion to Toyota’s factory line-up.\n\nAnother driver to watch out for is Lucas Moraes, who won the 2025 W2RC title with Toyota and has since joined an expanded four-car Dacia operation alongside Al-Attiyah, Loeb and Cristina Gutierrez.\n\nFord’s young gun Mitch Guthrie complemented Ekstrom well in 2025 and looks well placed to challenge for individual stage wins this year. His team-mate Nani Roma, a Dakar winner on both two and four wheels, should also never be discounted.\n\nOutside of Toyota, Ford and Dacia, two smaller manufacturers could regularly mix in the top 10 this year: Century and Mini. At Century, Matthieu Serradori and Brian Baragwanath have a history of punching above their team’s weight, while Mini also fields proven talents like Guillaume de Mevius and Lionel Baud.\n\nFinally, ‘Mr Dakar’ Peterhansel will also line up at the start in Yanbu on 3 January after missing the event in 2025, competing for Land Rover’s Defender brand in the Stock class.\n\nDakar 2026: Full route, schedule and marathon stage details\n\nRed Bull co-owner Mark Mateschitz to enter Dakar Rally under an alias\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

    "fullText": "According to a report from AS, Real Madrid scouts will closely monitor Kees Smit over the next six months before the 2026 FIFA World Cup.\n\nIt is known that the AZ Alkmaar youngster is being followed as part of Madrid’s wider plan to identify a midfield orchestrator capable of leading the team into the next cycle.\n\nAs mentioned many times in the past, Real Madrid are preparing to reinforce their midfield in the summer of 2026.\n\nWith that objective in mind, Smit has emerged as a profile that fits many of the club’s requirements.\n\nOver recent weeks, his name has gathered serious traction among scouts, not just in Spain but across Europe.\n\nCompetition for Smit’s signature is expected to be fierce.\n\nSeveral top clubs are aware of his rapid development, but Real Madrid believe their sporting project and global pull could be decisive if they choose to make a concrete move.\n\nThe club see him as a player who is young enough to grow, yet already mature enough to handle responsibility at the highest level.\n\nReal Madrid will keep an eye on Kees Smit. (Photo by Richard Pelham/Getty Images)\n\nAt just 19 years old, Smit has already taken important steps forward in his career. He has made his debut for the Dutch national team under Ronald Koeman, who is counting on him as part of his plans heading into the World Cup.\n\nKoeman’s faith has been telling, and comparisons to Pedri only underline the type of midfielder Smit is becoming.\n\nMeanwhile, Real Madrid’s interest is not new. Club scouts were first drawn to Smit during a Youth League match in the 2022–23 season, when AZ Alkmaar convincingly defeated Real Madrid 4-0.\n\nThat performance sparked sustained monitoring of his progress, and since then, his development has only reinforced the initial impressions.\n\nFrom now until the end of the season, the evaluation process will intensify. Madrid intend to observe him continuously, analysing not only his performances but also his consistency, personality, and response to pressure.\n\nHowever, under contract until 2028, AZ Alkmaar currently value him at around €60 million.\n\nIt is already a hefty figure for a player who turns 20 on January 21, but one that could climb even higher with strong international exposure.",

The Bulldogs’ postseason experience, defensive strength and a regular season win in Athens weighed on many minds.\n\nThat confidence did not survive Thursday night in New Orleans.\n\nOle Miss stunned third-ranked Georgia 39-34 in a chaotic College Football Playoff quarterfinal that featured 30 combined fourth quarter points, multiple lead changes and one of the most unusual endings in bowl history.

It sent them to the Fiesta Bowl for a semifinal matchup against Miami.\n\nNo love for Ole Miss #SugarBowl#CFBPlayoffpic.twitter.com/eJcNIRwSIF\n\n— Jeff Hauser (@radiohauser) January 2, 2026\n\nThe Rebels, now 13-1 and the CFP’s No. 6 seed, looked nothing like the underdog most of the pregame panel envisioned. Quarterback Trinidad Chambliss carved up the Bulldogs for 362 yards and two touchdowns, repeatedly answering Georgia rallies with poise and precision. His 40-yard strike to De’Zhaun Stribling on third down late in the fourth quarter set up Lucas Carneiro’s decisive 47-yard field goal with six seconds remaining.\n\nCarneiro was flawless all night, drilling three field goals, including Sugar Bowl-record kicks of 55 and 56 yards as Ole Miss totaled 473 yards of offense. Georgia finished with 355 yards but couldn’t come up with the final stop when it mattered.\n\nGeorgia had erased a 10-point deficit in the final minutes, tying the game on Peyton Woodring’s field goal with 55 seconds left. That rally only heightened the drama before Ole Miss delivered the final blow.\n\nIt was the kind of result that shows why the games are played on the field.

    "fullText": "The imminent 130th anniversary of the Louis Vuitton monogram is less a birthday and more a demonstration of how powerful two letters can be.\n\nBorn in 1896, when the Époque was at its most Belle, the superposed initials LV appeared amidst a variety of foliate and geometrical motifs. At first it was not a success. “The public was initially reticent and demanded the chequered and even the striped canvas, but my father stood firm,” recalled Gaston-Louis Vuitton of his father Georges Vuitton, son of the founder.\n\nThe striped and chequered patterns he mentions refer to previous designs. Every decade or so, Vuitton changed the pattern of the canvas with which it covered its famous, flat-topped trunks. Trianon grey came first in 1858. In 1872, the grey gave way to stripes. The checkerboard Damier pattern came in 1888, and was the first time that the maker’s name appeared on luggage, with the words “Marque L Vuitton Déposée” (which translate as “L Vuitton registered trademark”) appearing every so often in the checks.\n\nThe Damier was intended to scare off counterfeiters. It didn’t work — which leads us to the monogram we know today. If Georges thought that this new design would deter the fakers, a summer stroll along a 21st-century Mediterranean beach, with its itinerant vendors of imposter Louis Vuitton bags, shows just how comprehensively he failed.\n\nGeorges Vuitton had inadvertently created one of, if not the, most recognisable hieroglyphs in the history of luxury goods. This was not branding as we know it today; it was more akin to an artist signing a canvas. As well as a hint of the Japonisme, the mania for all things Japanese that gripped France in the late 19th century, the geometric emblems attested to Georges Vuitton’s fascination with the ogives and spandrels of Gothic architecture. In particular, he was a great admirer of the work of Eugène Viollet-le-Duc, the French architect who revolutionised the study and restoration of medieval architecture.\n\nViollet-le-Duc’s reputation may since have faded, but the patterned monogram is known in every corner of the globe. This January, the house will embark on a year-long celebration with the familiar dramatis personae taking to the stage: the Speedy of 1930; the Keepall, also from 1930; the Noé, made for a champagne producer in 1932 to carry five bottles (four upright and the fifth inverted); the Alma, Parisian architecture translated into handbag in 1992; and, finally, the Neverfull of 2007 — capable, so Vuitton says, of carrying up to 100 kilogrammes but more usually functioning as a capacious tote.\n\nThe bags will appear in different guises throughout the anniversary year. Most striking of the three celebratory capsules is Monogram Origine, a collection of the classics (minus, for some reason, the Keepall), that returns to Georges’s first pattern but deploys a newly developed coated linen/cotton canvas that comes in its recognisable chocolate-brown Ebène shade as well as a soft rainbow of pastels. All of which provide further proof, if further proof were needed, that at 130 years of age, the famous monogram is as versatile as it is well known.",

Beijing had expressed anger at a planned U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, as well as at Japan’s new leader’s comments that Tokyo could intervene in the event of a Chinese attack on Taiwan.\n\nChina sees Taiwan as its own territory and threatens to annex it by force if necessary. A former Japanese colony, Taiwan has been governed independently from the mainland since 1949, when the Nationalist Party lost a civil war against the Chinese Communist Party and retreated to the island.\n\nLai's speech was met angrily in Beijing, where a spokesperson for the State Council's Taiwan Affairs Office called the president “a saboteur of peace, a troublemaker and a warmonger,” according to the official Xinhua news agency.\n\n“No matter what Lai and the Democratic Progressive Party authorities say or do, they cannot change the fact that Taiwan is part of China,\" said spokesperson Chen Binhua.\n\nThe planned arms sale, valued at more than $11 billion, is the U.S.’s largest so far to Taiwan. It includes missiles, drones, artillery systems and military software.\n\nThe United States is obligated by its own laws to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself.\n\nChina’s leader Xi Jinping called Taiwan’s eventual annexation “ unstoppable \" during his own televised New Year’s address on Wednesday.\n\nTaiwan last year announced a special $40 billion budget for arms purchases, including to build an air defense system with high-level detection and interception capabilities called the Taiwan Dome.\n\nThe budget will be allocated over eight years, from 2026 to 2033, and comes after Lai already pledged to raise defense spending to 5% of the island’s GDP, as part of his strategy amid China’s threats of invasion.\n\n“Facing China’s serious military ambitions, Taiwan has no time to wait,” Lai said.\n\nMistreanu reported from Beijing.",

    "fullText": "CRANS-MONTANA, Switzerland (AP) — Swiss investigators are probing what caused a fire in a bar at an Alpine ski resort that left around 40 people dead and another 115 injured during a New Year's celebration.\n\nMost injuries, many of them serious, occurred when the blaze swept through the crowded bar less than two hours after midnight Thursday in southwestern Switzerland.\n\nThe Crans-Montana resort is best known as an international ski and golf venue. Overnight, its crowded Le Constellation bar morphed from a scene of revelry into the site of potentially one of Switzerland’s worst tragedies.\n\nCrans-Montana is less than 5 kilometers (3 miles) from Sierre, Switzerland, where 28 people, including many children, were killed when a bus from Belgium crashed inside a Swiss tunnel in 2012.\n\nHere’s what we know about the deadly fire:\n\nThe blaze broke out around 1:30 a.m. Thursday inside the Le Constellation bar amid the holiday celebration.\n\nTwo women told French broadcaster BFMTV they were inside when they saw a male bartender lifting a female bartender on his shoulders as she held a lit candle in a bottle. The flames spread, collapsing the wooden ceiling, they told the broadcaster.\n\nPeople frantically tried to escape from the basement nightclub up a narrow flight of stairs and through a narrow door, causing a crowd surge, one of the women said.\n\nA young man at the scene said people smashed windows to escape the fire, some gravely injured, reported BFMTV. He said he saw about 20 people scrambling to get out of the smoke and flames, likening what happened to a horror movie.\n\nThe injured were so numerous that the intensive care unit and operating theater at the regional hospital quickly hit full capacity, said Mathias Reynard, head of the regional government of the Valais Canton.\n\nOfficials rule out possible attack\n\nWhile officials said Thursday it was too early to determine the fire's cause, investigators have already ruled out that it could have been an attack.\n\nExperts have not yet been able to go inside the wreckage, said Beatrice Pilloud, Valais Canton attorney general, at a news conference.\n\nWork is underway to identify the victims and inform their families, according to Valais Canton police commander Frédéric Gisler.\n\nThe blaze triggered a flashover or backdraft\n\nThe Swiss officials called the blaze an “embrasement généralisé,” a French firefighting term describing how a blaze can trigger the release of combustible gases that can then ignite violently and cause what English-speaking firefighters would call a flashover or a backdraft.\n\nVictims suffered from serious burns and smoke inhalation. Some were flown to specialist hospitals across the country.\n\nAuthorities urged people to show caution in the coming days to avoid any accidents that could require the already overwhelmed medical resources.\n\nA top venue for the world's best athletes\n\nWith high-altitude ski runs rising around 3,000 meters (nearly 9,850 feet) in the heart of the Valais region’s snowy peaks and pine forests, Crans-Montana is one of the top venues on the World Cup circuit.\n\nThe resort will host the best men’s and women’s downhill racers, including Lindsey Vonn, for their final events before the Milan Cortina Olympics in February.\n\nThe town’s Crans-sur-Sierre golf club, down the street from the bar, stages the European Masters each August on a picturesque course.\n\nDazio reported from Berlin and Leicester reported from Paris. Geir Moulson in Berlin and Graham Dunbar in Geneva contributed to this report.",

    "description": "by Byung-Chul Han",
    "fullText": "Scent of the pine trees –\n\n A lizard scurries\n\n Across the hot stone.\n\nIn 1927, Le Temps retrouvé [Time Regained] was published in Paris. The same year saw the publication of Heidegger’s Being and Time in Germany. There are numerous similarities between these two works, which, at first glance, seem so different. Like Proust’s project on time, Being and Time sets itself against the increasing disintegration of human existence, against the decay of time into a mere sequence of point-like presences. Contrary to Heidegger’s aspiration that Being and Time represent a phenomenology of human existence of timeless validity, his work is in reality a product of its time. Historically specific processes and time-independent characteristics of human existence are intermingled in it. Thus, Heidegger offers a problematic explanation of the ‘destruction of the everyday world’1 through acceleration, which he says is the result of a ‘tendency towards nearness’ that is intrinsic to Dasein’s essence:\n\nDasein is essentially de-distancing. As the being that it is, it lets beings be encountered in nearness … An essential tendency towards nearness lies in Dasein. All kinds of increasing speed which we are more or less compelled to go along with today\r\n push for overcoming distance. With the ‘radio’, for example, Dasein is bringing about today a de-distancing of the ‘world’, which is unforeseeable in its meaning for Dasein, by way of expanding and destroying the everyday surrounding world.2\n\nTo what extent is ‘de-distancing’ – as a mode of being of Dasein, which I use as a means for spatially opening up my surroundings – related to that unleashed acceleration which steers towards the suspension of space itself? Apparently, Heidegger does not realize that the age of the radiophonic, even the entire ‘age of haste’, is based on forces far greater than the ‘tendency towards nearness’ intrinsic to Dasein’s essence, and which make Dasein’s orientation in space possible in the first place. The total removal of space is something altogether different from that ‘de-distancing’ which affords Dasein a spatial existence.\n\nThe new media abolish space itself. Hyperlinks make pathways disappear. Electronic mail does not need to conquer mountains and oceans. Strictly speaking, it is no longer something ‘ready-to-hand’. Instead of ‘hands’ it immediately reaches the eyes. The age of the new media is an age of implosion. Space and time implode into a here and now. Everything is subject to de-distancing. There are no longer any sacred spaces which one may not ‘de-distance’, i.e. spaces whose being set aside [Ausgespartsein] is part of their essence. Spaces with a scent hold their appearance in reserve [sparen ihr Erscheinen]. An auratic distance is inherent in them. The contemplative, lingering gaze is not de-distancing. In his later writings, Heidegger himself turned against the unlimited de-distancing of the world. Thus, origin is something which ‘halts in its withdrawal, and holds itself in reserve’.3 It does not exhaust or divest itself. According to Heidegger, the ‘nearness to the origin is a nearness which still holds something back in reserve’ [sparende Nähe].4\n\nThe ‘they’, which Heidegger generalizes into an ontological constant, is in reality a phenomenon of his time. It is, in a manner of speaking, a contemporary of Heidegger’s. Thus, the temporal experience of the ‘they’ corresponds exactly to the ‘cinematographic’ time which, according to Proust, characterizes the ‘age of haste’. Time is dispersed into a mere sequence of point-like presences. The ‘they’ ‘is so little interested in the “matter in question” that, as soon as it catches sight of it, it already is looking for the next thing’.5 The ‘they’ zaps through the world. Thus, Heidegger speaks of a ‘dispersed non-lingering’ and of a ‘never dwelling anywhere’ [Aufenthaltslosigkeit].6\n\nHeidegger realized early on that the emptiness of being goes hand in hand with the acceleration of life. In his lecture course of 1929/30, he says:\n\nWhy do we find no meaning for ourselves any more, i.e. no essential possibility of being? Is it because an indifference yawns at us out of all things, an indifference whose grounds we do not know? Yet who can speak in such a way when world trade, technology, and the economy seize hold of man and keep him moving?7\n\nHeidegger explains the general haste in terms of the inability to perceive silence, the long-lasting and slowness. Where there is no duration, acceleration, in the sense of a purely quantitative intensification, sets in, in order to compensate for the lack of duration, even for the lack of being:\n\nAcceleration [Die Schnelligkeit] … not-being-able-to-bear the stillness of hidden growth … purely quantitative enhancement, blindness to what is truly momentary, which is not fleeting but opens up eternity.8\n\nHeidegger’s philosophy of time is connected to his times. Thus, his critical comments regarding time, for instance about the permanent shortage of time, are also aimed at his times:\n\nWhy do we have no time? To what extent do we not wish to lose any time? Because we need it and wish to use it. For what? For our everyday occupations, to which we have long since become enslaved…. This not having any time is ultimately a greater being lost of the self than that wasting time which leaves itself time.9\n\nHeidegger invokes ‘what is essential in Dasein’ and what ‘cannot be forcibly brought about by any busyness or mad rush’.10 ‘Essential existence’ is ‘slow’. Heidegger explicitly turns against the ‘modern’, which is characterized by point-like presences and discontinuity.11 As a characteristic manifestation of modernity, the ‘they’ only perceives the narrow tip of the actual. Thus, it rushes from one presence to the next.\n\nThe decay of time also takes hold of the identity of Dasein. Dasein is ‘dispersed in the multiplicity of what “happens” daily’.12 It is ‘lost in the making present of the today’,13 and thus loses the continuity of its self. The age of haste is an age of ‘dispersion’. This awakens the need ‘to pull itself together [ Zusammenholen ] from the dispersion and the disconnectedness’.14 But narrative identity only establishes a connection, while Heidegger’s strategy regarding the question of identity is to aim for the extraction of ‘the primordial stretching along of the whole of existence, which is not lost and does not need a connection’, namely ‘a steadiness that has been stretched along – the steadiness in which Da-sein as fate “incorporates” into its existence birth and death and their “between”’.15 This ‘fatefully whole[,] stretching’,16 namely history, is more than a story which establishes a connection. It is not a narratively\r\n constructed picture, but a pre-narrative framing which encloses ‘birth and death and their “between”’. Dasein assures itself of itself independently of a narrative construction of identity. Heidegger’s strategy regarding time and identity is a response to the narrative crisis of his times. The strategy formulates a notion of identity which would still be viable in an age of general de-narrativization.\n\nBeing and Time is based on an insight that is specific to its times, that the loss of historical meaningfulness leads to the decay of time into an accelerating sequence of isolated events, that because of a lack of gravitation or an anchoring in meaning time rushes off without hold or aim. Heidegger’s strategy regarding time consists in a re-anchoring of time; in giving it significance, a new hold; in enframing it again within a historical line [Zug], so that it does not disperse into a meaningless, accelerating succession of events. Against the threatened end of history, Heidegger emphatically invokes history itself. However, he knows very well that the gravitation, the historical meaningfulness which is meant to set time right again, cannot be of a theological or teleological kind, and he therefore opts for an existential concept of history instead. The historical traction now originates from the emphasis on the self. Heidegger concentrates time by integrating the temporal horizons by way of their relation to the self. History as directed time protects time against decay, against its dispersion into a pure sequence of point-like presences. In this, it is the self that provides the direction. The ‘constancy of the self’, this essence of authentic historicity, is duration, which does not pass. It does not elapse. The one who exists authentically has time always, so to speak. He or she always has time because time is self, and does not lose time because of not losing him- or herself:\n\nJust as the person who exists inauthentically constantly loses time and never ‘has’ any, it is the distinction of the temporality of authentic existence that in resoluteness it never loses time and ‘always has time’.17\n\nThe shortage of time, on the contrary, is a symptom of inauthentic existence. Dasein in its inauthentic existence loses its time because it loses itself to the world: ‘Busily losing himself in what is taken care of, the irresolute person loses his time in them, too. Hence, his characteristic way of talking: “I have no time”.’18 Ultimately, Heidegger’s strategy regarding time consists in transforming ‘I have no time’ into ‘I always have time.’ It is a strategy based on duration, an attempt at regaining the lost mastery of time through an existential mobilization of the self.\n\nIn his later writings, Heidegger moves further and further away from the historical model of time. The place of history is taken by the seasons or other figures of repetition:\n\nIn the pathway’s seasonally changing breeze this knowing gladsomeness … thrives … Along its trail winter’s storm encounters harvest’s day, the agile excitation of Spring and the serene dying of Autumn meet, the child’s game and the elder’s wisdom gaze at each other. And in a unique harmony, whose echo the pathway carries with it silently here and there, everything is made gladsome.19\n\nThe ‘silent harmony’ of the seasons and its echo, which continues, even renews itself in the ‘here and there’, suggest duration. The world is an acoustic space with its own natural oscillation, in which nothing fades away or elapses. The ‘gathering play’ which surrenders nothing to disappearance or dispersion creates a fulfilled duration:\n\nIn the coolness of the autumn day, the fire of summer finishes\r\n in cheerful serenity … The cheerful serenity of the autumn coolness, which harbors the summer within itself, drifts about this country path every year with its gathering play.20\n\nAgain and again, Heidegger uses the trope of the ‘back and forth’21 as a counter-trope to historical time. In the movement of the back-and-forth, time comes to stand still [zum Stehen], so to speak. A duration a-rises [ent-steht] Heidegger’s poem ‘Time’ goes:\n\nHow far?\n\n Only when it stops, the clock,\n\n with its pendulum swinging back and forth,\n\n only then do you hear: it goes and is gone and goes\n\n no more.\n\n Already late in the day, the clock,\n\n only a faint track toward time,\n\n which, near finitude,\n\n a-rises from it.22\n\nThe ‘back and forth’ produces duration within cyclical change. Heidegger’s Pathway is itself constructed like a pendulum clock. The text sets out with the words: ‘It runs from the park gate towards Ehnried’. And towards the end of the text, we read: ‘From Ehnried the way turns back to the park gate.’23 The back-and-forth of its course makes the pathway a figure of repetition and gathering. Nothing progresses without returning. All Forth is caught by a Back, as if by an echo. This back-and-forth is also reflected in the play of children:\n\nOut of the oak’s bark the boys carved their boats: equipped with rudder and tiller they floated in Metten brook or in the\r\n school fountain. The world-wide journeys of these games reached their destination [Ziel] easily and found their way back to shore again.24\n\nNothing is lost to indeterminacy. And nothing is subject to change. The country path is a silent place of eternal repetition. Everything remains gathered: ‘The pathway gathers in whatever has its coming-to-presence [sein Wesen] along the way; to all who pass this way it gives what is theirs.’25 Everything rests in the timelessly valid ‘coming-to-presence’, in an eternal presence. The pathway’s back-and-forth silences the world into the ‘Same’. In the pendulum strokes of its back-and-forth, the world a- rises. The pathway represents a clearly delineated world of duration with its own natural oscillation. Everything stands within the simple lustre of a perspicuous order. Nothing escapes the eye and hand of the mother: ‘The eye and hand of the mother surrounded their world [i.e. that of all things]. It was as if her unspoken care protected all that came to be [alles Wesen].’26\n\nThe country path does not strive towards a goal [Ziel]. Rather, it rests in itself in contemplative fashion. It illustrates a via contemplativa. The back-and-forth frees it from having a goal without exposing it to destructive dispersion. A peculiar gathering is intrinsic to it. It does not follow a course towards … but lingers. It silences the directed, spasmodic time of labour into duration. As a place for contemplative lingering, the path symbolizes a dwelling that does not need a goal or purpose, one that can do without a theology or teleology.\n\nThe world is a ‘round dance’ of ‘earth and sky, divinities and mortals’.27 The ‘round dance’ is at the same time a temporal formula, an eternal circling in itself which prevents any spatio-temporal dispersion. Everything remains gathered in the ‘ring’ of the world,\r\n in the ‘radiance of their [i.e. of the fourfold’s] simple oneness’.28 The ‘sky’, too, is a timeless circling in itself, an eternal up-and-down. It is the ‘path of the sun, the course of the changing moon, the wandering glitter of the stars, the year’s seasons and their changes, the light and dusk of day, the gloom and glow of night, the clemency and inclemency of weather, the drifting clouds and blue depth of the ether’.29 At the temporal level, the strictly symmetrical structure of the world creates the impression of a time that stands still. The symmetry of the world, which suggests an immovable, uniform order, extends into language. Heidegger even emphasizes it with special figures of speech. His philosophy consists not only of arguments, but – problematically – also of verses. Types of syntax and rhyme patterns are intentionally employed to create, for instance, the feeling of an eternally valid order. Thus, the beautiful, symmetrical order of the world, the ‘fouring’, is invoked,30 in a poem that is, not coincidentally, made up of two stanzas of four symmetrically composed lines. The ‘radiance of their simple oneness’30 is completed in the metrical radiance of ‘mist diffuses/blessing muses’ [Regen rinnt/Segen sinnt].\n\nForests spread\n\n Brooks plunge Rocks persist\n\n Mist diffuses\n\n Meadows wait\n\n Springs well\n\n Winds dwell\n\n Blessing muses31\n\n1.

    "fullText": "The billionaire – who had no government experience – left various federal agencies in disarray while overseeing an ‘efficiency’ drive across Washington\n\nAs Elon Musk, the world’s richest person, splurged more than $250m on Donald Trump’s 2024 re-election campaign, the US president commissioned his new ally to oversee a sweeping “efficiency” drive across the federal government.\n\nThe Tesla and SpaceX boss, who had no experience inside government, was tasked with eradicating waste and cutting spending as part of the so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) – and was quick to stoke expectations.\n\n“I think we can do at least $2tn,” Musk declared of the potential savings during a campaign rally at Madison Square Garden in New York City a week before Trump’s re-election.\n\nFollowing Trump’s return to office in January, these ambitious plans were swiftly on a collision course with reality. Tens of thousands of federal workers were fired, leaving agencies in disarray and triggering myriad legal challenges.\n\nJust four months into the administration, Musk abruptly announced his exit. Six months later, it was reported that Doge was no more. Musk has even said he wouldn’t do it again.\n\n“That was all complete bullshit from the beginning,” Elaine Kamarck, a former White House official and expert on government reform, told the Guardian. “The fact that they even said it and then had to go roll it way, way, way back into the low hundreds of billions, tells you they didn’t know what they were doing.”\n\nKamarck created and managed the National Performance Review, which aimed to improve efficiency and reduce costs, during the Clinton administration.\n\nAs of December, the agency’s purported savings, which reports have demonstrated are rife with errors, inaccuracies, and exaggerations, have reached $214bn.\n\nHowever much has been cut from the federal budget, the urgency surrounding Doge in its early weeks and months prompted widespread disruption, and even mistakes. Analysis by the Brookings Institution recorded 26,511 occasions where the Trump administration fired people, and then hired them back.\n\n“What they did was they sowed chaos to no avail,” said Kamarck. “Doge was done in an incredibly careless way, without regard for what the agencies did and whether and moreover, whether or not Americans liked what they did.\n\n“You can cut the government. I did it in the Clinton administration,” she added. “We cut the government by 420,000 people, but we did it over a period of seven years, and we did it in the context of mission and what we no longer needed to do, etc.\n\n“In other words, we had a plan that works with the mission of the agency. This business of coming in and moving fast and breaking things which they like to do in Silicon Valley just doesn’t work in the government.”\n\nQuestions were raised last month about whether Doge was even still operating. “That doesn’t exist,” the office of personnel management (OPM) director, Scott Kupor, told Reuters. (An account for the agency on X, formerly Twitter, disputed this claim.)\n\nBut Musk had long moved on. During a recent podcast interview with former Doge adviser Katie Miller, the tycoon described the effort he once suggested could identify $2tn in savings for the federal government as “a little bit successful”. Asked if he would do it again, he responded: “I don’t think so ... Instead of doing Doge, I would have, basically, built … worked on my companies.”\n\nHow much efficiency can be achieved from having multiple operations inside the federal government, seeking efficiencies? Philip G Joyce, professor of public policy at the University of Maryland, said Doge was “unnecessary” given the longstanding existence of the Government Accountability Office (GAO), which has logged $1.45tn in savings across over 29,000 federal operations since 2002.\n\nRussell Vought, the White House office of management and budget director and architect of the rightwing Project 2025 blueprint, said in September that he believes the GAO shouldn’t exist.\n\n“I can understand why he thinks that,” said Joyce. “Because the Government Accountability Office, as an agency of the Congress, is helping the Congress to try to hold the executive branch accountable. It’s uncomfortable to be held accountable, but that doesn’t make it bad.”\n\nRather than reinforce the balance of power between the different branches of government, Joyce argued that Doge was a mechanism to eliminate and cut things the government does that are ideologically opposed by the Trump administration – without congressional approval.\n\n“What Doge was doing was not trying to take the operations of government and make it more efficient. They were basically just trying to come in and almost randomly sort of decide that they were going to just eliminate a significant number of things that the government does,” he said. “Even upfront, it was clear that they had really no understanding of the federal budget. And then when they went into the agencies, it became even clearer.”\n\nWhen Doge descended on the Social Security Administration in February, Chuck Borges was serving as chief data officer. Musk was touting false and misleading claims alleging fraud and abuse at the agency, including claims people over 120 years old were still receiving benefits.\n\nBorges resigned in August, and filed a whistleblower complaint over how Doge left the public’s social security data exposed. “What I identified was that social security data was apparently being copied into an insecure or unsecured cloud environment, or you could characterize it as a cloud environment without independent security monitoring,” he told the Guardian. “What I was alleging was that there was a risk being put on the data by keeping it in a manner not consistent with agency policy, agency requirements and industry best practices.”\n\nBorges is now running for a state senate seat in Maryland. “I believe that if we don’t find a way to build strong, sustainable, growing communities locally, and I’d like to start with where I live, then the nation isn’t going to have a lot of seeds which it can use to grow and recover from where we are today,” he said.\n\nMany Doge staffers are now reportedly embedded inside federal agencies across government. Many of the issues it posed around transparency, and the impact of sweeping decisions, are still being fought over in court.\n\n“Doge has been operating with minimal transparency but maximal authority,” said Donald K Sherman, executive director and chief counsel of the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (Crew), which filed a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit against Doge in February, alleging that it had failed to comply with recordkeeping and transparency laws.\n\n“There’s pretty significant misalignment in terms of how the administration claims Doge has been beneficial to the American public, and what information it wants the American public to have access to about Doge’s operations,” said Sherman. “We’ve spent months litigating because this administration does not want the public to know what Doge is doing, how Doge is operating.”\n\nApproached for comment, the White House did not provide detailed responses to questions on Doge’s record.\n\n“President Trump pledged to cut the waste, fraud, and abuse in our bloated government, and the Administration is committed to delivering on this pledge for the American people,” said spokesperson Davis Ingle.\n\nThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.\n\nIf you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.\n\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\n\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

    "description": "From French onion soup to a hearty helping of chilaquiles in Mexico, here are feel-good foods from around the world.",
    "fullText": "No matter where you are in the world, comfort food has a way of making everything feel OK.\n\nFrom fish and chips in the UK to the lasagna-like moussaka in Greece, certain dishes just make us feel all warm and fuzzy inside.\n\nWhether you're looking for something to fill you up on a chilly day or for a delicious dish for your next family dinner, these comfort foods are sure to hit the spot.\n\nHere are 30 comfort foods from around the world that everyone should try.\n\nBest enjoyed with a slice of crusty bread, French onion soup is comfort food at its best.\n\nWhile onion soups date back to ancient times, the beloved dish we know today got its start in Parisian cafes in the 18th century.\n\nRich, warm, and generously blanketed with creamy cheese, French onion soup can make even the worst day slightly more bearable.\n\nBeef bourguignon, popularized in the US by chef Julia Child after she learned to cook in France, is a beef stew made with carrots, onions, garlic, pearl onions, and bacon, all cooked down in red wine. It's often paired with crusty bread, making for the perfect winter meal.\n\nFrom the sodium-heavy instant packs found in every American college dorm to award-winning ramen restaurants in Tokyo, ramen has developed into a global obsession. Over 100 billion servings of ramen are consumed globally each year.\n\nHere are some instant-ramen hacks to help you level up your next bowl.\n\nWe have Montreal to thank for Canada's unofficial national dish, poutine, which also sometimes goes by its informal nickname, \"Canadian salad.\" The iconic dish consists of crispy, golden fries topped with cheese curds and drenched in gravy.\n\nChilaquiles translates to \"in a sauce of chiles,\" and is a dish consisting of heaps of crisp tortilla triangles tossed in a pan with salsa, and then piled with crumbled cheese and crema.\n\nChilaquiles are also often enjoyed for breakfast.\n\nIf you're harboring any reservations about just how delicious battered fish and crispy fries taste when dipped in a creamy tartar sauce, do yourself a favor and embark on a mission to make your own fish and chips at home.\n\nA standard \"full English\" — also called a fry-up — includes things like roasted tomatoes, fried eggs, sausage, and baked beans, sometimes piled onto toast.\n\nWiener schnitzel, the national dish of Austria, consists of boneless, mallet-thinned meat, usually veal, that is then breaded and deep-fried until it reaches prime crispiness.\n\nOriginally from the region of Lazio, which is around Rome, this decadent spaghetti is a creamy mix of guanciale, velvety olive oil, fatty egg yolk, and nutty Parmesan cheese.\n\nThink of these Aussie favorites like the larger, heartier, and more sophisticated version of pigs-in-a-blanket.\n\nPierogies are boiled dumplings that are typically filled with a mixture of potatoes and cheese curds, and often enjoyed with a generous dollop of sour cream and caramelized onions.\n\nMatzo balls — which are made from matzo meal and eggs, and often consumed during Passover — are doughy, rich soup dumplings that have a delicious tendency to soak up all the flavors of the broth in which they're submerged.\n\nCongee — a soothing type of rice porridge that is so extensively cooked that the individual grains of rice coalesce into an almost homogeneous base — is popular in many East Asian countries, and is often fortified with different garnishes and ingredients to amplify the flavor.\n\nThe simple comfort mainstay known as the grilled-cheese sandwich can come dressed up or au naturel — just as long as it comes with a side of tomato soup for dunking.\n\nHere's how to make the perfect grilled cheese, according to a cheese expert.\n\nThis pizza is more pie-like, with a hearty serving of sauce and a stuffed crust.\n\nThe exact origins of the dish are debated, but Eater Chicago calls Lou Malnati's Pizzeria \"one of the original inventors of the Chicago deep dish.\"\n\nArguably Germany's most widely valued culinary contribution, bratwursts are thick German-style sausages that are frequently paired with stewed sauerkraut and a tall, cool beer.\n\nKare-kare gets its signature flavor from a thick and savory peanut sauce.\n\nRich, smoky, vibrant, and nourishing, Valencians take their paella, a rice dish topped with seafood, seriously — it is Spain's best-known culinary export, after all.\n\nNPR reported that Khichuri, also called Khichdi, is an ancient Indian comfort dish made from rice and lentils that is typically prepared in one pot.\n\nButter chicken, otherwise known as murgh makhani, is made with chicken in a creamy tomato and butter sauce.\n\nButter chicken is similar to the British-Indian dish chicken tikka masala, but The Indian Express reported that butter chicken originated in New Delhi.\n\nMofongo, a ball-shaped dish of pickled, fried, and then smashed plantains that are flavored with garlic, salt, and oil in a wooden pilón, is a Puerto Rican staple usually served alongside a hearty stew or broth.\n\nMoussaka, a baked dish that can be described as Greece's version of lasagna, typically features layers of fried eggplant, potatoes, ground meat, and spices, all topped off with grated cheese and a cream sauce such as béchamel.\n\nShakshuka is a stew of eggs poached in a spicy sauce of tomatoes, chiles, and onions flavored with cumin. While it likely originated in North Africa, it is a popular dish throughout the Middle East.\n\nPicadillo, a Cuban-style hash, routinely features a base of ground beef and tomatoes, but you'll find different renditions of the dish depending on which region you're eating it in. Some prefer it with olives for a salty kick; others enjoy it with raisins for sweetness.\n\nGoulash is a hearty, paprika-flavored stew with cubes of seared beef, parsnips, carrots, and potatoes.\n\nSwedish meatballs are served at most holidays and special events in Sweden. The meatballs are commonly made with a mixture of ground beef and pork, swimming in a delicious gravy of meat juices, flour, and butter.\n\nIKEA, founded in Sweden, famously sells its own, too — and it sells a lot of them: around 1 billion meatballs globally each year.\n\nThick, stick-to-your-ribs soups make up the backbone of Iranian cooking. Ash Reshteh, a noodle soup full of beans, herbs, and yogurt, is arguably the most famous type.\n\nSoft, pillowy, and marked with gorgeous golden spots, naan, which is baked in a hot tandoori clay oven, is a type of bread that's perfect for dipping or relishing on its own.\n\nJamaica's national fruit, the ackee, is the star of ackee and saltfish, the island's national dish, a salty and savory sautée that's often served with fried plantains and rice.\n\nBorscht, a sour soup with a vibrant red color, thanks to its primary ingredient of beets, is traditionally made with meat or bone stock, sautéed veggies, and fermented beetroot juice, although there are countless variations of the dish.",

    "fullText": "It's going to be quite the 12 months in the world of football, but so as not to get too surprised about the upcoming year, we're doing our best to predict what will happen in 2026 ...\n\n📸 Justin Setterfield - 2025 Getty Images\n\nRichard Buxton: Arsenal winning the quadruple.\n\nPeter Fitzpatrick: We finally get a verdict on the Manchester City vs. Premier League case.\n\nDylan Krain: Harry Kane will either win the Champions League with Bayern Munich or the World Cup with England.\n\nHannah Pinnock: Liverpool will win the Champions League in Budapest. Wild only because of how poor they've been this season.\n\nAndrew Thompson: Erling Haaland completes football by leading Norway to a shock 2026 World Cup triumph.\n\nAlex Waite: Arsenal comfortably holding off City and Villa and strolling to the Premier League title without any hiccups whatsoever.\n\nPádraig Whelan: Scott McTominay will lead Scotland to World Cup glory in the summer. A man can dream right?\n\nRB: Mohamed Salah leaving Liverpool looks likely but Real Madrid moving on Vinícius Júnior will be the big story unless the axe falls on Xabi Alonso.\n\nPF: Salah will almost certainly leave Liverpool but he is approaching 34 so it won't be as shocking as Vini Jr. going to Saudi Arabia less than two years after being \"robbed\" of the Ballon d'Or.\n\nDK: Vinícius Júnior is 25 years old and should be entering his prime. Naturally, a move away from Real Madrid would be a pivotal moment in the Brazilian's career.\n\nHP: Vini Jr leaving Real Madrid, most likely for Saudi Arabia as it's difficult to see any clubs in Europe affording his mega wages.\n\nAT: It's gotta be Mo Salah leaving the red half of Liverpool. The possible departure of a club icon and one of the greats of the Premier League era will shift landscapes.\n\nAW: Mo Salah heading to Saudi all the way for me. Hard to see how he comes back completely after the recent turmoil.\n\nPW: It is already dominating the news and a big tournament at AFCON will throw Mo Salah's Liverpool future under the spotlight even more. If he does go, it will be the biggest move of the year.\n\nRB: Manchester United giving up the ghost on Ruben Amorim would definitely set the wheels in motion but in the absence of that, Tottenham parting ways with Thomas Frank will trigger a fair bit of upheaval in the Premier League.\n\nPF: Pep Guardiola finally departing Manchester City. His replacement is anyone's guess.\n\nDK: After only six months in charge, Xabi Alonso already seems to be on thin ice (as Real Madrid managers often are). If the pressure doesn't let up, he could be gone by the season’s end.\n\nHP: Real Madrid parting ways with Xabi Alonso in the summer and Liverpool making the difficult call on Arne Slot. Alonso to start the 2026/27 season in charge at Anfield.\n\nAT: Cèsc Fabregas replacing Enzo Maresca at Chelsea should he move on.\n\nAW: I can't see Thomas Frank lasting for too much longer at Tottenham but if Oliver Glasner leaves Palace, Frank could end up in the dugout at Selhurst Park next season.\n\nPW: He has denied them but the rumours about Pep Guardiola's future intensified in the last month. Could he walk away at the end of the season?\n\nRB: It's not really a surprise given where they are currently but Fiorentina dropping out of Serie A after 22 seasons will be huge for a club of their stature and history.\n\nPF: The best title race by far is in Italy with the top of Serie A reminiscent of its former glory days. Roma and Gian Piero Gasperini could just pull off an iconic title win.\n\nDK: Serie A is in the midst of the most competitive title race in Europe’s big five leagues, with the top five teams separated by just four points. There are still plenty of surprises to come.\n\nHP: Aston Villa may not have enough to win the Premier League, but they could make a surprise push for a top three, potentially even top two finish.\n\nAT: Arsenal manage to hold off the Manchester City onslaught and break their Premier League title duck.\n\nAW: Aston Villa have caught the eye in the Premier League so far and I can see them keeping pace with City and Arsenal for the duration this season.\n\nPW: Lens hold a slender lead in Ligue 1 but are unlikely to last the pace. It is hard to make a case for any major surprises this season.\n\nHP: Liverpool (got to stick with my earlier prediction).\n\nRB: France are still the overriding favourites but Spain look more than capable of going all the way.\n\nPF: Barring Troy Parrott carrying Ireland the whole way, I'll go with Brazil as Carlo Ancelotti completes football and restores the Seleção to their perch.\n\nDK: This might just be the year football comes home... England have a strong squad and Thomas Tuchel has proven adept at navigating knockout competitions.\n\nHP: France. Too much talent not to win it.\n\nAT: I hate to be the one to potentially jinx it for a few of my colleagues, but England under Thomas Tuchel may finally have the tactical acumen to get over the final hurdle.\n\nAW: I won't say England because there's bound to be some disappointment along the way there! When Spain get going, they are a serious force, so La Roja it is.\n\nPW: Well if it isn't to be Scotland, France look a formidable side to overcome.\n\nRB: Kylian Mbappé and Alexia Putellas.\n\nPF: Kylian Mbappé and Alexia Putellas\n\nDK: Erling Haaland and Alexia Putellas.\n\nHP: Kylian Mbappé and Clàudia Pina.\n\nAT: Kylian Mbappé and Alexia Putellas.\n\nAW: Kylian Mbappé and Alexia Putellas.\n\nPW: Kylian Mbappé, Alexia Putellas.\n\nRB: Everton's Harrison Armstrong has been earning rave reviews on loan at Preston North End and looks a superb all-round midfielder. It's only a matter of time before he gains David Moyes' trust and gets a regular run of Premier League experience.\n\nPF: Ayden Heaven has impressed at United and could find himself in England contention by the end of 2026.\n\nDK: Following an eye-catching start to his Chelsea career, Estêvão looks set to have a breakout World Cup as a starter for Brazil, no less.\n\nHP: Ayyoub Bouaddi is already catching the eye for Lille in Ligue 1, so it's no surprise to see Europe's top clubs linked. A big move could propel him to the very top.\n\nAT: Yan Diomande at RB Leipzig (clubmate Antonio Nusa is also a shout, especially if he stars at the World Cup for Norway).\n\nAW: Lennart Karl has already looked the part at Bayern and hitting it big on the international stage is the next step for the talented teenager.\n\nPW: He's already made a good impression and name for himself but Estêvão at Chelsea looks like having all the tools to be a superstar.\n\nRB: A largely disruption-free World Cup.\n\nPF: The good parts of the World Cup.\n\nDK: The World Cup coming to my home city for the first time.\n\nHP: A dramatic end to what is shaping up to be one of the most thrilling Premier League campaigns at both ends of the table.\n\nAT: The World Cup not being the categorical nightmare it's currently shaping up to be.\n\nAW: The expanded World Cup with so many newcomers.\n\nPW: They only come around every four years so bring on the World Cup.\n\n📸 MANDEL NGAN - Afp or licensors",

    "description": "The year 2025 was trash. Let’s hope 2026 is better for the Orioles and the world.",
    "fullText": "You’ve made it! The cursed year 2025 is over and you have survived. 2026 will surely bring its own share of challenges but hopefully at least within the sphere of our favorite baseball team things will go better on the strength of internal and external improvements to the roster that are made this offseason.\n\nThere are now 84 days remaining until Orioles Opening Day. The start of spring training is much closer, as if you want to go by the pitchers/catchers report date for WBC participants, that’s just a month and eight days away from today. It will be here before you know it.\n\nIs there another major Orioles move to be made between now and then? Today could turn out to be a day of big news regarding Japanese pitcher Tatsuya Imai’s signing with an MLB team. The deadline for him to sign is tomorrow and when you consider that there’s still going to be a physical involved, today might be the real day to lock down a framework of an agreement, and that will probably be reported if it happens rather than remain a secret until tomorrow.\n\nI don’t know how much Mike Elias actually wants Imai or whether his want exceeds what other GMs will be willing to offer. I’m not expecting the Orioles to really be in on this, but who knows. It does still feel like there’s a need to be addressed at the top of the rotation, so if it’s not Imai, then pivoting to Ranger Suárez or Framber Valdez, whose markets will probably be impacted by where and for what price Imai signs, could still be in play.\n\nOr maybe another trade? Who knows. With apologies for repeating myself, Elias has surprised me multiple times this offseason and he may yet surprise me again before it’s over. We are certainly living in a different world than we were with the Orioles last offseason.\n\nReddit AMA with beat writer Jake Rill (Reddit/Orioles)\nThis took place yesterday, so you’ve missed the chance to ask a question. Most interesting for me was his assessment that the problem for the 2025 Orioles was 55% injuries, 40% underperformance by key players, 5% bad luck.\n\nTen New Year’s resolutions for the Orioles heading into 2026 (The Baltimore Sun)\nIt’s time to stop dwelling on how much last year sucked and instead think about the ways this year could be better.\n\nNothing of particular note has happened involving the Orioles on the first day of the year. Maybe that will change today! But probably not.\n\nThere are a few former Orioles who were born on this day. They are: 2012 outfielder Xavier Avery, 2006 infielder/outfielder Fernando Tatis, and 1958 infielder Foster Castleman.\n\nIs today your birthday? Happy birthday to you! Your birthday buddies for today include: midnight rider Paul Revere (1735), early American flagmaker Betsy Ross (1752), author E. M. Forster (1879), longtime FBI director J. Edgar Hoover (1895), baseball Hall of Famer Hank Greenberg (1911), and DJ Grandmaster Flash (1958).\n\nIn 45 BC, January 1 marked the beginning of a new year for the first time in the Roman Republic as the Julian calendar, named after Julius Caesar, went into effect. The calendar remained in use in areas influenced by Rome for over 1,500 years before it started being replaced by the Gregorian calendar that remains in use today.\n\nIn 1808 AD, on the first day this was permitted by the Constitution, the United States banned the importation of enslaved people.\n\nIn 1818, Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley’s Frankenstein was first published. At the time of its publication, Shelley chose to remain anonymous.\n\nIn 1902, Michigan and Stanford played a college bowl game, which at the time billed itself as the Tournament East-West Football Game and today is known as the Rose Bowl. Michigan was a 49-0 winner in the game. This year’s edition of the Rose Bowl will be played today between Alabama and Indiana as part of the quarterfinal round of the college football playoff.\n\nI received a book billing itself as The Big Book of Baltimore Orioles Trivia for Christmas. In it are 100 trivia questions. I’ll include them in my Bird Droppings, skipping stupidly obvious questions like “What year did the Orioles begin play at Memorial Stadium?” and St. Louis Browns-related questions, until we’ve exhausted the list. Here is question 1:\n\nWhat was the Orioles record in 1970?\n\nThe book lists multiple choice answers, but I thought that would make it too easy for people on this site. If you are of an age that you remember the 1970 season, feel free to share a memory with us.\n\nAnd that’s the way it is in Birdland on January 1. Have a safe new year.",

The Chinese electric vehicle maker delivered 4.6 million units last year, up 7.7% from 2024, according to a statement, meeting its full-year goal, though that achievement lost some of its shine as it was a downgraded target.",

    "description": "Feature: The world has passed it by in many ways, yet it remains relevant",
    "fullText": "Feature In the early 1990s, internetworking wonks realized the world was not many years away from running out of Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) addresses, the numbers needed to identify any device connected to the public internet. Noting booming interest in the internet, the internet community went looking for ways to avoid an IP address shortage that many feared would harm technology adoption and therefore the global economy.\n\nA possible fix arrived in December 1995 in the form of RFC 1883, the first definition of IPv6, the planned successor to IPv4.\n\nThe most important change from IPv4 to IPv6 was moving from 32-bit to 128-bit addresses, a decision that increased the available pool of IP addresses from around 4.3 billion to over 340 undecillion – a 39-digit number. IPv6 was therefore thought to have future-proofed the internet, because nobody could imagine humanity would ever need more than a handful of undecillion IP addresses, never mind the entire range available under IPv6.\n\nAs billions of devices and people came online, first using PCs and then wielding smartphones, conventional wisdom assumed that network operators would move to IPv6 rather than persist with IPv4.\n\nYet according to data from Google, the Asia Pacific Network Information Center (APNIC), and Cloudflare, less than half of all netizens use IPv6 today.\n\nTo understand why, know that IPv6 also suggested other, rather modest, changes to the way networks operate.\n\n\"IPv6 was an extremely conservative protocol that changed as little as possible,\" APNIC chief scientist Geoff Huston told The Register. \"It was a classic case of mis-design by committee.\"\n\nAnd that notional committee made one more critical choice: IPv6 was not backward-compatible with IPv4, meaning users had to choose one or the other – or decide to run both in parallel.\n\nFor many, the decision of which protocol to use was easy because IPv6 didn't add features that represented major improvements.\n\n\"One big surprise to me was how few features went into IPv6 in the end, aside from the massive expansion of address space,\" said Bruce Davie, a veteran computer scientist recently honored with a lifetime achievement award by the Association for Computing Machinery's Special Interest Group on Data Communications, which lauded him for \"fundamental contributions in networking systems through design, standardization, and commercialization of network protocols and systems.\"\n\nDavie said many of the security, plug-and-play, and quality of service features that didn't make it into IPv6 were eventually implemented in IPv4, further reducing the incentive to adopt the new protocol. \"Given the small amount of new functionality in v6, it's not so surprising that deployment has been a 30 year struggle,\" he said.\n\nAnother innovation that meant IPv6 made less sense was network address translation (NAT), which allows many devices to share a single public IPv4 address. NAT meant IPv4 network operators could connect thousands of devices with a single IP address, meaning their existing IP addresses became more useful.\n\n\"These solutions were relatively easy to deploy, aligned with existing expertise, and avoided large-scale infrastructure changes,\" said Alvaro Vives, manager of the learning and development team at RIPE NCC, the regional internet registry for 76 nations across Europe, the Middle East, and Central Asia.\n\nBecause NAT stalled IPv6 adoption, vendors didn't rally behind the new protocol.\n\n\"Migration costs, complexity, and training requirements remain high, while short-term ROI is low,\" Gartner distinguished VP analyst Andrew Lerner told The Register. \"Performance parity across applications and devices is inconsistent, and some organizations even disable IPv6 for better performance. Lack of dual-stack support in legacy infrastructure is another barrier,\" he added.\n\nWhile IPv6 didn't take off as expected, it's not fair to say it failed.\n\n\"IPv6 wasn't about turning IPv4 off, but about ensuring the internet could continue to grow without breaking,\" said John Curran, president and CEO of the American Registry for Internet Numbers (ARIN).\n\n\"In fact, IPv4's continued viability is largely because IPv6 absorbed that growth pressure elsewhere – particularly in mobile, broadband, and cloud environments,\" he added. \"In that sense, IPv6 succeeded where it was needed most, and must be regarded as a success.\"\n\nRIPE NCC's Alvaro Vives agrees. \"What IPv6 got right was its long-term design,\" he told The Register. \"It provides a vast address space that allows networks to be planned more simply and consistently. This has enabled innovation, from large mobile networks to the Internet of Things and advanced routing techniques such as Segment Routing over IPv6.\"\n\nGartner's Lerner thinks the time has come for organizations to develop detailed IPv6 migration plans.\n\n\"Validate application compatibility, and ensure new infrastructure supports IPv6,\" he advised. \"Pilot deployments and lab testing with DNS64/NAT64 are recommended. Over time, IPv6 adoption will accelerate as private IPv4 space depletes and cloud providers introduce pricing models that favor IPv6.\"\n\nAPNIC's Huston, however, thinks that IPv6 has become less relevant to the wider internet.\n\n\"I would argue that we actually found a far better outcome along the way,\" he told The Register. \"NATS forced us to think about network architectures in an entirely different way.\"\n\nThat new way is encapsulated in a new technology called Quick UDP Internet Connections (QUIC), that doesn't require client devices to always have access to a public IP address.\n\n\"We are proving to ourselves that clients don't need permanent assignment of IP address, which makes the client side of network far cheaper, more flexible, and scalable,\" he said.\n\nHuston thinks IPv6 has also become less relevant to servers.\n\n\"These days the Domain Name Service (DNS) is the service selector, not the IP address,\" Huston told The Register. \"The entire security framework of today's Internet is name based and the world of authentication and channel encryption is based on service names, not IP addresses.\"\n\n\"So folk use IPv6 these days based on cost: If the cost of obtaining more IPv4 addresses to fuel bigger NATs is too high, then they deploy IPv6. Not because it's better, but if they are confident that they can work around IPv6's weaknesses then in a largely name based world there is no real issue in using one addressing protocol or another as the transport underlay.\"\n\nBut there are plenty of organizations that still see a need for IPv6. Huawei sought 2.56 decillion IPv6 addresses and Starlink appears to have acquired150 sextillion, which is helping to push more countries past 50 percent IPv6 adoption. ®",

    "description": "Opinion: From COBOL and C to Linux and SQL, the unglamorous software that keeps the world running refuses to disappear",
    "fullText": "Opinion COBOL turned 66 this year and is still in use today. Major retail and commercial banks continue to run core account processing, ATM networks, credit card clearing, and batch end-of-day settlement. On top of that, many payment networks, stock exchanges, and clearinghouses rely on COBOL for high‑volume, high‑reliability batch and online transaction processing on mainframes.\n\nWhich reminds me, mainframes are still alive and well too. Banking, insurance, governments, inventory management – all the same places you'll find COBOL, you'll find mainframes as well.\n\nNone of that is as sexy as the latest AI program or the newest cloud-native computing release, but old dogs with their old tricks still have useful work to perform.\n\nAll of which made me wonder what other technologies are likely to still be in use 50 or more years after they were first released. Here are the ones my friends and I came up with.\n\nFirst, though, I want to point out that the current standard, COBOL 2023, is very different from the COBOL that Admiral Grace Hopper helped create. The same is true of mainframes. The first IBM mainframe, 1952's 701, and even 1965's IBM/360, which became COBOL's top platform, don't look much at all like today's IBM z17. Nevertheless, there's a clear line running from those much earlier technologies to the ones at our fingertips today. Nothing stays the same when it comes to computing, even if the names don't change.\n\nStarting with languages, C, the language of choice for system programmers, is still alive and well, as it's already over 50 years old. I expect it, and COBOL too, to reach the century mark.\n\nYes, I know all about C's built-in security problems, but you still can't beat it when it comes to raw speed. Sure, assembler is even faster – just ask the FFmpeg developers – but you can run C on pretty much any CPU.\n\nLately, there's been a lot of talk about Rust replacing C for system programming. And, yes, memory-safe Rust is now a full-fledged language for programming in the Linux kernel. However, speed and portability have always been C's killer features, and that hasn't changed.\n\nSQL also isn't going anywhere this century. It's embedded in every major relational database management system (RDBMS), and it's here for the long run. There are tens of billions of lines of SQL in stored procedures and queries. It's embedded in far too much data – and business logic is bound to it – for it to disappear.\n\nAnother language that people love to hate, JavaScript/TypeScript, isn't going anywhere either. Much as developers like to make fun of it, it's still the de facto language of the web browser and a major server‑side runtime. So long as we're using the web platform, JavaScript, in one dialect or another, will be required for compatibility.\n\nLinux is forever. We'll still be running Linux come 2100. Heck, I won't be surprised to see computers still running Linux in 2125. Oh, and I expect Linus Torvalds' other greatest creation, Git, to be with us for at least another 50 years.\n\nAlong with Linux, I expect vi and Emacs to persist. We'll also need fast text editors. Even Bash, which has outlasted all the other Unix/Linux shells, may hang around for another century or so.\n\nA technology I think is here for the foreseeable future but others might disagree with is Kubernetes. This is the default container orchestration program for pretty much every cloud around. It has its critics, but love it or hate it, it's the foundation for cloud-native computing and all the dozens of other programs and services we use for modern-day cloud computing.\n\nMoving on to higher levels of technology, I see Photoshop going on for decades more to come. Yes, I'm a big open source fan, and GIMP is what I use, but facts are facts. If you do serious work with images, you're almost certainly a user of Photoshop and its ecosystem.\n\nFile formats are another matter. Once one is established as the top format in any field, it tends to hang on forever. That's why we're still using Microsoft's DOC and its newer variant, DOCX, instead of the superior and far more open ODF. That's not a good thing.\n\nFor example, we all use Adobe PDF when we need a document to look and behave the same everywhere, be hard to accidentally change, and remain readable for years and years. However, people who work with PDF a lot are painfully aware that there are many PDF variants, and they have more than their share of compatibility problems.\n\nAs my friend Dan Rosenbaum, an editor and singer, pointed out to me, there are industry standards such as the proprietary Finale for music notation, which was abandoned by its maker. In the continuing aftershocks, musicians have discovered there's no easy way to port Finale compositions to any other format, and thus any other music notation program. This has led to what he describes as an \"ongoing crisis in that industry.\"\n\nThis leads to my final thought of technologies that will stand the test of time. They're almost always open standards and/or open source. Any tech that relies on a single company is brittle. Yes, even DOC/DOCX and PDF. ®",

    "fullText": "FIFA has had “cooling breaks” for a while now to give players some time to hydrate when the temperature during a match is excesive. This started during the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil, when a Brazilian court ordered FIFA breaks near the 30th minute mark for the players to hydrate when temperatures reached 32 degrees Celsius (via ESPN).\n\nSince then, certain leagues such as the MLS and Spanish LaLiga have adopted similar breaks, with each league using different parameters for the interruption of play.\n\nNow, per a report from The Athletic’s Henry Bushnell, the upcoming 2026 FIFA World Cup will feature ‘three-minute hydration breaks’ in each half of every game:\n\nIn 2026, for the first time at a World Cup, they’ll pause no matter what, around 22 minutes into each half.\n\n“There will be no weather or temperature condition in place, with the breaks being called by the referee in all games, to ensure equal conditions for all teams, in all matches,” FIFA said in a release posted online late Sunday night.\n\nThe report also mentions that the breaks have commercial implications, which can surely be translated as an opportunity for FIFA to sell pricey ad spots to increase the World Cup revenue — something which might not surprise anyone at this point.",

    "fullText": "A traveler passing through Newark Liberty International Airport tested positive for measles – one of the world’s most infectious diseases – earlier this month, officials said.\n\nThe patient zero passenger was in terminals B and C on Dec. 12, according to a press release from the New Jersey Department of Health.\n\n“Measles symptoms include a high fever, cough, runny nose, watery red eyes, and a rash that usually appears between three and five days after symptoms begin,” health officials warned in the release.\n\n“The rash usually begins as flat red spots that appear on the face at the hairline and spread downward to the neck, torso, arms, legs and feet.”\n\nThe airborne virus can spread when someone coughs or sneezes – and lingers in the air for up to two hours after the infected person leaves the area.\n\nOfficials implored anyone who suspects they were exposed to the illness to call their health provider before visiting a medical care center or hospital.\n\n“NJDOH is working in collaboration with local health officials on ongoing contact tracing and on efforts to notify people who might have been exposed and to identify additional exposures that may have occurred,” officials said in the release.\n\nThe NJDOH said that anyone who is not fully vaccinated or has not contracted measles in the past are at risk.\n\nWhile measles is highly contagious, the infection produces decades-long immunity – but the two-dose vaccine offers lifelong immunity, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThis year, there have been 11 confirmed cases of measles in New Jersey, according to NJDOH.\n\nA record 8.03 million travelers are expected to fly across America this holiday season, according to AAA.\n\nNewark isn’t the only major airport to report detections of the viral disease during the holidays.\n\nThe Massachusetts Department of Public Health confirmed that a visitor from Texas was diagnosed with measles after flying into the Boston Logan International Airport on Christmas Eve.\n\nThe traveler was on American Airlines Flight 2384, which departed from Dallas-Fort Worth, according to a release from the MDOPH.\n\nAs of Dec. 30, there have been 2,065 measles cases in the US in every state except Delaware, Maine, New Hampshire, North Carolina and West Virginia, according to the CDC.\n\nThe US previously touted its elimination of the virus 25 years ago. Declining vaccination rates killed the celebrated herd immunity – resulting in a three-decade high of measles cases.",

    "description": "My husband and I wanted to show our kids as much of the country and the world as possible. Now, they're resilient, confident, and independent adults.",
    "fullText": "Before having kids, my husband and I were avid travelers, and we knew we didn't want to stop after our son was born.\n\nFrom Rhode Island to Mexico, we believed in the motto, \"Have kids, will travel.\" The same was true after the arrival of our daughter.\n\nWe decided to show them as much of the country and the world as we could … while working around school schedules.\n\nOur first cross-country flight with our son was to visit family in Boston when he was six weeks old. He slept the whole time, which made up for the trips to come.\n\nWhen he was a year old, we struggled through turbulence and motion sickness as a family while on a warm plane ride to visit family in North Carolina. And when he was 2, he cried all the way home on a flight from Boston to Vancouver, Washington, because he was teething and I forgot to bring medicine.\n\nI learned my lesson on that trip and knew to be as prepared as a Boy Scout on long trips with both of my kids years later, equipped with medicine, extra clothes, and things to keep them occupied.\n\nStill, travel snafus are a given, even as they've gotten older. From mad dashes through Boston Logan International Airport to multiple-hour delays in Georgia and missed connections in Dallas, we've done our best to teach patience when traveling.\n\nAnd it's paid off. Over the last 21 years, my kids have been to five countries and 20 states. From artwork and architecture in Portugal and Mexico to historical artifacts and monuments across the US, our travels have enabled our kids to develop a global perspective that connects them with different cultures and diverse populations.\n\nDoing so has allowed them to step out of their comfort zones, interact with different people, and embrace new experiences. The most interesting thing as a mom was watching them try new foods, from lobster in New England to pastéis de nata in Portugal.\n\nMy son now works as a chef in Arizona, 1,000 miles away from our home in Washington, and he's traveled independently to Hawaii and Canada.\n\nMeanwhile, our daughter has just finished her first semester of college in Los Angeles, another destination 1,000 miles away from home. As she studies for a career in scenic design (that we expect will take her all over the world), we know her travel experiences have prepared her for what is to come.\n\nIf there's any advice I could give to new parents, it would be that experiences matter more than possessions. So, take trips, do things, and don't be afraid that your kids are too young or too fragile.\n\nChildren are resilient and can learn to be adaptable, especially when they're young. Sure, there are cranky, hangry moments — heck, I still get cranky and hangry when I travel long distances — but each adventure has provided bonding opportunities, educational moments, and the beauty of seeing parts of the world like no other.\n\nAnd above all, we did it together. When their dad and I are no longer around, I'm confident they'll say to each other, \"Remember that time?\" and that will make it all worth it.",

    "fullText": "In the 25 years since the first permanent crew docked at the International Space Station, fewer than 300 people have experienced what life is like there, 250 miles above Earth.\n\nThe rest of us can only imagine it.\n\nSo, for NASA astronauts like Don Pettit, taking photographs of our planet while aboard the ISS is a way to share the experience with people on the ground.\n\n\"It's a labor of love,\" Pettit said of his photography in an interview from space in December 2024. \"That's what astronauts spend a lot of their off-duty time doing: doing imagery, collecting the photographs that go with the memories to tell the story of what it's like up here.\"\n\nIn 2025, NASA shared thousands of photographs of Earth taken by its astronauts from the International Space Station.\n\nThe powerful images captured weather events from above, including deadly hurricanes and lightning strikes. Others showed the pinks and greens of the northern lights and what sunrises look like from space.\n\nWhile there are challenges in taking photos from the ISS — the multiple layers of windows, for example, cause reflections that need to be overcome — there are benefits as well.\n\nLarge camera setups, like Pettit's 800-millimeter telephoto lens and solar filter, would be cumbersome in a place with gravity.\n\n\"There are things we can do up here that would make many photographers envious when they're mounting their heavy gear on stout tripods,\" Pettit said.\n\nTake a look at some of the most awe-inspiring images of Earth taken by astronauts aboard the International Space Station in 2025.",
