Those of us who elected Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia as the legitimate President of Venezuela, who must immediately assume his constitutional mandate and be recognized as Commander-in-Chief of the National Armed Forces by all the officers and soldiers who comprise it.\n\nToday we are ready to assert our mandate and take power. Let us remain vigilant, active, and organized until the democratic transition is complete. A transition that needs ALL of us.\n\nTo the Venezuelans who are currently in our country, be ready to put into action what we will be communicating to you very soon through our official channels.\n\nTo Venezuelans abroad, we need you to be mobilized, engaging the governments and citizens of the world and committing them from now on to the great operation of building the new Venezuela.\n\nIn these crucial hours, receive all my strength, my confidence, and my affection.

    "description": "The world may no longer fully live in the grip of COVID-19, but another heavily contagious disease is currently spreading through U.S. airports.",
    "fullText": "In 2020, COVID-19 caused travel restrictions and other changes to how people get around. Avoiding getting sick while traveling is tricky, as COVID-19, flu, and common colds easily spread when dozens of people sit shoulder to shoulder inside planes, trains, or buses. However, another disease has added itself to the list. Measles is on the rise, and health officials have detected it in airports.\n\nThe New Jersey Department of Health sent a press release stating that it detected measles in a traveler who was at the Newark Liberty International Airport on December 12, 2025. The department has undertaken contact tracing efforts in case the passenger infected others. Another case appeared in a passenger who flew to and from Boston Logan International Airport (one of the busiest in the country) on December 11 and 12.\n\nThe Massachusetts Department of Public Health sent a press release of its own. The press release emphasized that measles is preventable through vaccines, making the nationwide rise in cases all the more surprising. Per the Centers for Disease Control, over 2,000 people in the U.S. tested positive for measles in 2025, numbers not seen since 1992.\n\nGavi, an organization working to increase medical vaccine access worldwide, explained that measles is the most contagious virus based on how many others just one person can infect, a measurement called R0. Like COVID-19 and the flu, measles spreads through particles in the air after someone carrying the disease coughs or sneezes. Its particles also linger in the air for up to two hours, meaning you can catch measles even without direct contact. After around two centuries of documented measles existence, researchers created a vaccine in the 1960s.\n\nVaccine skeptics have long existed around the world, but recent years have seen a higher percentage of parents choosing not to vaccinate their children. Gavi attributes this to vaccine misinformation, the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, and other global crises. Multiple health officials have publicly tried to ease people's minds by stating that vaccines are safe and effective as long as enough members of a population receive them.\n\nGetting measles despite being vaccinated is incredibly uncommon, but all travelers can take solace in the fact that cases are still fairly low nationwide. If you think you might be sick, wearing a mask can prevent you from spreading anything.\n\nReady to discover more hidden gems and expert travel tips?

    "fullText": "The novelty of eating at a diner owned by the richest person in the world seems to have worn off in just a few months\n\nLess than six months since it opened, Elon Musk’s Tesla Diner has the feel of a ghost town. Gone is the Optimus robot serving popcorn, gone are the carnivore-diet-inspired “Epic Bacon” strips, gone are the hours-long, hundred-person lines wrapped around the block. Even the restaurant’s all-star chef, Eric Greenspan, is gone. The Hollywood burger-and-fries shop seems like a shell of the bustling eatery it was when it opened in late July.\n\nOn a balmy Friday afternoon in December, the parking lot for Tesla car charging was, at best, half full. Inside what the company describes as a “retro-futuristic” diner, a handful of people trickled in, ordering burgers and hotdogs or asking for merch. The upstairs deck, AKA “Skypad”, was vacant except for a pair of employees stringing holiday lights. More staff was busy at work, buffing fingerprints off the chrome walls and taking out the trash, than there were customers. The diner was spotless.\n\nThe novelty of eating at a restaurant owned by the richest person in the world seems to have worn off. When the Tesla diner opened in summer, it brought in droves of the CEO’s fans and curious onlookers. But then came the onsite anti-Musk protests, noise complaints from neighbors and customers who said menu items often sold out or, when they were available, were served soggy and cold.\n\nGreenspan, a graduate of Le Cordon Bleu who helped launch the Mr Beast Burger chain, told the Los Angeles Times last month that he was leaving the Tesla Diner to focus on opening a Jewish deli called Mish. According to Eater, the chef removed his previous Instagram posts referencing the Tesla Diner as a newly minted ex-boyfriend might.\n\nGreenspan has not publicly said why he left and did not return a request for comment. Tesla also did not return a request for comment.\n\nGreenspan and other California restaurateurs who praised the Tesla Diner faced pushback for supporting Musk. The Tesla CEO is seen as a polarizing figure who donated nearly $300m to get Donald Trump elected and then led the so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) in its rapid and haphazard teardown of federal agencies. During a speech at Trump’s inauguration, Musk made what rights groups have described as back-to-back Nazi salutes – something repeatedly portrayed in the picket signs held by Tesla Diner protesters.\n\nMusk has been talking about the concept of a 50s-style Tesla diner in LA since at least 2018 as part of an idea to have amenities for waiting drivers connected to Supercharger stations. He touted the plans for it in 2023 as “Grease meets The Jetsons with Supercharging” and claimed the diner would launch later that year. When it finally did open in the summer of 2025, he called it “one of the coolest spots in LA” and vowed that if the concept went well Tesla would open diners in major cities around the world. So far, there is only one.\n\n“This is a pretty special diner. If you are in the LA area, it’s worth visiting,” Musk said on Tesla’s second-quarter earnings call, just two days after the diner opened. “It’s a shining beacon of hope in an otherwise bleak urban landscape.”\n\nThe diner received immense media coverage upon opening but poor reviews from restaurant critics, who described the food as forgettable and the concept as little more than a corporate branding exercise. Its menu consisted of fast-food staples like a $13.50 smash burger, AKA “Tesla Giga Burger”, and an $8 milkshake, along with more internet-coded foods like the $12 maple-glazed “Epic Bacon” strips and a small-sized $8 “Wagyu Beef Chili Cup”.\n\nA display case with Tesla merchandise featured a “levitating Cybertruck” figurine for $175 and a black hoodie emblazoned with a graphic of the diner for $95.\n\nTesla posted on X in October that it had sold 50,000 burgers since its opening – an average of a little over 700 a day. Musk proclaimed that month that the diner was a success and suggested that he would open others near Tesla offices in Palo Alto and Austin. Tesla has yet to announce any formal plans for expansion.\n\nOn social media, the wave of food influencers making TikTok and Instagram videos about the diner slowed in the months after its opening. Reviewers commenting on the $13 hotdog or posing next to the giant drive-in screens playing Star Trek are now relatively rare. Musk, who usually posts dozens of times a day on X, has only made scant mentions of the diner on the platform and didn’t address it on Tesla’s third quarter earnings call in October.\n\nThe diner also appears to have pivoted to hosting some events, including a “Holiday Bash on The Skypad” in mid-December featuring unlimited Tesla food and beverages, plus a live DJ, for $75 a ticket.\n\nAs the diner narrows its ambitions, some of the customer complaints have likewise waned. The pared down menu is fully stocked, and food came out hot and fast on the balmy Friday in December. One enthusiastic Yelp reviewer said she recently visited the diner on a Saturday night. She posted a photo of her meal, saying “the burger was solid and the fries were perfectly crispy”.\n\n“Best part was that it wasn’t crowded at all,” she added.",

Weeks later on January 20, reasoning model DeepSeek-R1 was released.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nThe two models either surpassed or matched the performance of rival models across a range of industry benchmark tests. They were also built at a fraction of the cost and computing power that major US tech companies invest to build LLMs. The result: a massive sell-off on January 27 wiped out nearly US$1 trillion in tech stocks, including US$600 billion from Nvidia alone.\n\nAnalysts expected the momentum of Chinese AI companies to continue this year, thanks to Beijing's policy support, improved funding prospects, greater adoption of AI systems across industries and a growing number of talent being recruited for innovative projects.\n\nA domestic AI start-up's co-founder, who declined to be identified, predicted that China would overtake the US to become \"the world's leading AI power in 2027\". China's advantage was its deep talent pool, according to the co-founder.\n\nIn his New Year's address, Chinese President Xi Jinping pointed out that the domestic market has \"many large AI models competing in a race to the top\", while new breakthroughs were being achieved in domestic semiconductor development. All of that \"has turned China into one of the economies with the fastest growing innovation capabilities\", Xi said.\n\nDeepSeek founder and CEO Liang Wenfeng.

    "description": "Cirium released its annual report of the world's most punctual airlines. The cream of the crop is Aeromexico, but only one in the US made the top 10.",
    "fullText": "When booking your next flight in the US, Delta Air Lines might be your best bet for a timely arrival.\n\nIn 2025, it was the most on-time airline in the US and the 10th most punctual in the world, according to a newly released annual report from aviation analytics company Cirium.\n\nTop carriers often benefit from large, well-organized hubs, simpler networks, or hubs concentrated in regions with fewer weather-related disruptions. The rankings are based on on-time arrivals — defined as flights arriving within 15 minutes of their scheduled arrival time — and also reflect cancellations.\n\nIn 2025, Delta achieved an on-time performance rate of 80.9%, down about 2.5% from 2024. Still, roughly 8 in 10 flights arrived on schedule — and the carrier handled just over 1.8 million flights, compared to about 200,000 each by Aeromexico and Saudia, per Cirium.\n\nAccording to the aviation data company OAG, 80% or better is considered \"pretty good,\" while only the very best carriers hit 90% or higher.\n\nDelta remains among the world's most punctual airlines, though it slipped from No. 3 globally in 2024 to No. 10 globally in 2025. It did not receive Cirium's \"Platinum Award for Operational Excellence\" in 2025, despite earning it annually from 2021 to 2024.\n\nQatar Airways — boasting an over 200-strong aircraft fleet out of its sprawling Doha hub — won Cirium's top award, which goes to an airline that excels in punctuality, network efficiency, operational scale, and recovery from disruptions.\n\n\"The airline product is the schedule,\" Cirium's chief marketing officer Mike Malik said during a press conference. \"I keep emphasizing that. And when an airline understands that the schedule is what they're selling, they focus on that; they just become a better operation.\"\n\nAlaska Airlines came in second in the US with a 79.2% on-time rate. It knocked United Airlines, which faced significant air traffic control issues at its Newark, New Jersey, hub over the summer, down to fourth from its No.-2 spot in 2024. The airlines operated about 453,000 and 1.7 million flights last year, respectively.\n\nUS carriers overall experienced heightened operational pressure last year due to sustained air traffic controller shortages and a 43-day government shutdown, the longest in US history.\n\nOne airline, however, unexpectedly made the podium: budget competitor Spirit Airlines. In a turbulent year that included re-entering bankruptcy, Spirit jumped three spots to third place in the US with an on-time rate of 78.8% in 2025.\n\nThe improvement followed the airline's exit from several airports and the sale of dozens of planes to simplify its network and bolster cash flow.\n\n\"There has been a focus at Spirit Airlines to get their operation together for the past 14 months or so,\" Malik said. \"We've seen increases and them posting good numbers, but some of it has to, obviously, do with the fact that they are a much smaller operation and much more tightly controlled.\"\n\nHere is the list of the top 8 most on-time US airlines for 2025:\n\nAmong global carriers, the cream of the crop for 2025 was Aeromexico, with a 90.0% on-time arrival rate. Saudia took second place at 86.5%, and Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) came in third at 86.1%. This marks the second consecutive year that Aeromexico and Saudia have earned gold and silver.\n\nThree regional carriers — regional in the geographic sense, not regional jets or feeder airlines — performed even better than Aeromexico: South Africa's Safair at 91.1%, Royal Jordanian at 90.7%, and Panama's Copa Airlines at 90.8%.\n\nDespite beating Aeromexico, these carriers do not qualify for the top three spots because Cirium does not classify them as \"global\" airlines due to their fewer flights and less complex international networks. Cirium shows Safair, Royal Jordanian, and Copa flew about 63,000, 37,000, and 134,000 flights last year, respectively.\n\nElsewhere in the world, Cirium listed low-cost carrier Iberia Express, owned by the Spanish flag carrier Iberia, as the most reliable airline in Europe for 2025, with an on-time rate of 88.9%. Philippine Airlines won in the Asia Pacific region at 83.1%.\n\nVirgin Atlantic was named the \"most improved,\" jumping 9.44 percentage points from 74.0% in 2024 to 83.5% in 2025.\n\nHere is the list of the top 10 most on-time global airlines for 2025:\n\nThe world's most punctual airlines have networks anchored around large, highly optimized hubs — like Copa in Panama City, Aeromexico in Mexico City, or Royal Jordanian in Amman — or deliberately spread across a small number of coordinated airports.\n\nSAS, for example, balances traffic across Stockholm, Oslo, and Copenhagen, limiting bottlenecks. Safair, with the smallest operation among the top three regionals, primarily flies domestically, simplifying its network.\n\nThese airlines also benefit from generally less-constrained air traffic control systems compared to those in the US, as well as from locations that largely avoid cascading weather disruptions.\n\nSAS' primary airports, meanwhile, are purpose-built for winter operations.\n\nUS carriers American, Delta, and United, by comparison, each operate at least eight major hubs across widely different climates — from wildfires in California and hurricanes in Florida to winter storms in the Northeast and the heat in Texas — making disruption recovery far more complex.",

    "description": "What is the current status of democracy in the world?",
    "fullText": "What is the current status of democracy in the world?\n\nIn its 2025 report, V-Dem, a Swedish independent research organization, concluded there were more dictatorial states (91) than democracies (88) for the first time since 2002.\n\nThe report warned that those numbers underscore the serious decline of democracy around the world.\n\nAfter an apparent victory over communism with the end of the Cold War, democracy now faces a major challenge.\n\nThe benefits of globalization did not reach all citizens, leading to a maldistribution of wealth.\n\nThe dissatisfaction and hatred toward existing political parties and society of those who feel left behind have been amplified through social media, widening the division.\n\nOn the other hand, authoritarian governments monitor their citizens to shut off opposing opinions. Under tight state control, decisions are quickly made, giving the impression of “efficiency.”\n\nMany people likely hold doubts as to whether democracy is something that should be protected.\n\nThe values of this government system can be found in “Democracy,” a textbook for junior and senior high schools that was published by the old education ministry soon after the end of World War II.\n\nAt that time, expectations for a fresh start in Japan were heightened as the people were liberated from oppression and a lack of freedom.\n\nSTRENGTHS OF DEMOCRATIC NATIONS\n\nIn a democracy, where citizens are respected as individuals, a major strength is the freedom and equality that lie in its roots.\n\nWhile time may be required to thoroughly discuss all decisions on policy matters, democracy does have the ability to correct mistakes.\n\nFor example, elections can oust corrupt politicians.\n\nAnd policy toward the Vietnam War by the United States, which had covered up the facts, changed course through the outcry of its citizens.\n\nIn dictatorships, those in power shut down those who criticize government mistakes, making corrections impossible to achieve.\n\nThe website for the American Center managed by the U.S. State Department and U.S. Embassy once had a section that defined democracy as a system placing the government under the control of laws and allowing all citizens equal protection under the law.\n\nThe section also explained that majority rule was respected in a democracy, but that the fundamental rights of individuals and minority groups would be earnestly protected.\n\nBut in 2025, the pages containing such definitions were deleted. It is not clear if the deletions were related to the second inauguration of U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nAlthough the United States led the way after World War II in creating an international order based on the rule of law, the Trump administration’s National Security Strategy released in November declared, “The days of the United States propping up the entire world order like Atlas are over.”\n\nTrump is also moving to destroy the separation of powers, brazenly interfering in the judicial branch by firing prosecutors who previously investigated allegations against him.\n\nIn our New Year editorial for 2023, we expressed concerns about the decline of democracy, but we also displayed expectations for its recovery.\n\nThe situation, however, has worsened since then.\n\nAfter the Trump administration ended overseas support activities through the U.S. Agency for International Development, assistance toward democratic movements in Southeast Asia has stalled to the advantage of China and Russia.\n\nIn European nations, such as Germany and France, ultraright, anti-immigrant parties have increased their popularity.\n\nIn its 2022 report, the U.S. nongovernmental organization Freedom House listed four indices for determining if democratic nations were moving toward authoritarianism.\n\nThe first was “undermining the rule of law” by politicians and governments through the weakening of judicial independence.\n\nThe second was “perverting elections” to undercut public faith in democratic balloting through opaque financing and manipulation of electoral rules.\n\nThe third was “attacking media freedom” by targeting journalists and blocking access to information.\n\nThe fourth was “discrimination and mistreatment of migrants” and marginalized communities.\n\nThe “Democracy” textbook published after World War II also pointed to the fragility of democracy, warning that even in a democratized Japan, dictatorship could rear its ugly head at any time and from anywhere.\n\nThe textbook stressed the need for citizens to have a critical state of mind and awareness of that weakness of democracy.\n\nANTI-DEMOCRATIC TRENDS IN JAPAN\n\nDemocracy is also wavering in Japan.\n\nIf we use the four indices, rule of law is threatened by the proposal of Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s administration to create an anti-spying law, which could narrow the rights of citizens.\n\nA law enacted in 2014 to protect specially designated secrets has already affected reporting activities. The anti-spying legislation could further strengthen restrictions on free speech under the excuse of protecting Japan from foreign nations.\n\nThe Liberal Democratic Party is reluctant to further investigate money scandals by its lawmakers, while a proposal to revise the electoral system would be advantageous to the ruling coalition and could arbitrarily eliminate small parties.\n\nA government panel has also started work on restricting entry into Japan by foreigners, a policy that could further spread xenophobia around Japan.\n\nPopulism that gains support through xenophobia and chest-pumping arguments is also spreading into Japan. This reflects the distortions in politics and society that fuel dissatisfaction among the public with their daily lives.\n\nCan those distortions be corrected? Or will populist politicians use them to further agitate fear?\n\nIf nothing is done and division deepens, “other people” could be viewed as a hated enemy, and an authoritarian atmosphere would strengthen under such circumstances.\n\nDemocracy, however, has shown the ability to recover from past difficulties.\n\nAlthough viewpoints and perspectives may differ in a democracy, respect has been shown for the other party, and common ground is sought through dialogue in search of compromise.\n\nPoliticians and citizens should once again recognize this principle and strength and avoid falling into the trap of division.",

    "description": "A new country is gearing up to unveil the world's second-fastest commercial transport train, and despite their reputation with technology, it isn't Japan.",
    "fullText": "There are plenty of mistakes people make while traveling by train. Pick the cheapest ride, and you'll probably be stuck on a train moving slower than drying paint. Pick the wrong type of train, and you could be spending money faster than the blink of an eye. Knowing how to choose the right type of long-distance train is crucial, and when it comes to train systems, Asia's dominance in the sector far exceeds any other continent worldwide. China currently has the top spot for the most bullet trains, as well as the fastest, and this country will soon offer the world's second-fastest train, and no, it's not Japan.\n\nSouth Korea's government and the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport just revealed on December 22 that the world's second-fastest bullet train is scheduled to join its fleet in 2030 for test operations, and expect it to be fully commercialized for the public by 2031. Capable of speeds reaching a staggering 230 miles-per-hour (370 kilometers-per-hour), the new EMU-370 train is a next generation high-speed train that's going to put South Korea on the map when it comes to bullet trains that promise lightning-fast trips.\n\nKorea Railroad Research Institute (KRRI), along with seven public and private organizations, led a national research and development program spanning the length of three years from April 2022 to December 2025, to design the highly anticipated EMU-370 train project that cost a total of 15.23 million dollars (22.5 billion Korean won). The EMU-370 was designed to have a fully functional top speed of up to 253 miles-per-hour (407 kilometers-per-hour), making the trip from Seoul to Busan in just under two hours, when typically it would take two-and-a-half hours.\n\nOne of the best places to take a day trip if you're staying in Seoul, is the coastal town of Busan, which will now be more accessible than ever. Currently, the EMU-320 (KTX-Cheongyong) is South Korea's fastest train, however the EMU-370's impressive stats speak for themselves. Set to seat 479 passengers with a two decibel reduced indoor noise level, and a motor capacity of 560 kilowatts, the EMU-370 puts out 47.4% more power to the equivalent of about 75 midsize family sedans with a sleek aerodynamic design, making it the sportscar of the train world.\n\nCurrently, China's CR450 high-speed train is in testing, with speeds reaching approximately 249 miles-per-hour (400 kilometers-per-hour), and is the world's leading passenger bullet train, which is set to launch in 2027 for commercialized public use. Other countries that have bullet trains, such as France, Germany, and Japan, who were the first to have a bullet train in 1964 called the Shinkansen, reach a top speed of approximately 200 miles-per-hour (320 kilometers-per-hour).\n\nWith technological advances in rail speeds, tracks must also naturally be upgraded. According to the head of the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport's Railway Bureau, there must be significant improvements before the EMU-370 can reach full speed. Without halting operations of the railway, replacing ballast tracks with concrete tracks on some sections will be done during a four-hour period in which trains do not run. The ministry official stated they expect South Korea's high-speed rail to exceed 217 miles-per-hour (350 kilometers-per-hour) in the near future, which would secure South Korea's spot as a top player within the high-speed railway sector for years to come.\n\nReady to discover more hidden gems and expert travel tips?

A 43-year-old officer fired his gun. Four shots were fired. Officers provided aid, but Kennedy was pronounced dead at the scene. A knife was later recovered.\n\nAuthorities said Kennedy was homeless. No officers were injured. The fatal shooting remains under investigation by county detectives, with findings to be reviewed by the St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney’s Office once the case is complete.\n\nSt. Louis Lambert Airport released this statement:\n\n“The entire airport community is saddened by the events of November 21st.

    "fullText": "LONDON (AP) — Crystal Palace signed forward Brennan Johnson from Tottenham on Friday after the Wales international struggled for playing time under Spurs manager Thomas Frank.\n\nPalace said it paid an undisclosed club-record transfer fee but it was widely reported to be around 35 million pounds ($47 million).\n\nThe 24-year-old Johnson signed a contract through the 2029-30 season and will be eligible to make his Palace debut at Newcastle on Sunday.\n\nJohnson was Tottenham's top scorer last season with 18 goals across all competitions under manager Ange Postecoglou. He netted the only goal in Spurs' 1-0 victory over Manchester United in the Europa League final. Tottenham paid more than 47 million pounds ($63 million) to Nottingham Forest to secure Johnson's transfer in 2023.\n\nUnder Frank this season, though, Johnson had reduced minutes. He scored four goals in 22 appearances for Spurs.\n\nJohnson has seven goals in 42 appearances for Wales.\n\n“Brennan will give us options in our attacking play with his pace and goal-scoring ability and with all the upcoming games he will be a valuable addition to the squad,” Palace manager Oliver Glasner said in the club's announcement.\n\nAP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",

    "description": "Many of MTV's last 24-hour music channels around the world are set to stop broadcasting after today, Dec. 31, 2025.",
    "fullText": "MTV will shut down many of its last dedicated 24-hour music channels after today, Dec. 31.\n\nThe move, announced back in October, will affect channels around the world, with the U.K. seeing five different MTV stations going dark. These include MTV Music, MTV 80s, MTV 90s, Club MTV, and MTV Live. As Consequence notes, MTV Music — which launched in 2011 — notably ended its run by airing the Buggles’ “Video Killed the Radio Star,” the first visual to air when MTV launched in the United States in 1981.\n\nMTV’s parent company, Paramount Skydance, is also expected to shutter music-only channels in Australia, Poland, France, and Brazil. Reps for MTV in the U.S. did not immediately return a request for comment regarding the full slate of channels that are set to go dark.\n\nDespite axing much of its dedicated music programming, MTV’s flagship channels are still expected to keep broadcasting in the U.K. and elsewhere. Like in the U.S., these channels primarily air massively popular reality programs, as opposed to music videos.\n\nThe changes at MTV come as Paramount Skydance aims to cut costs following its blockbuster (and controversial) merger earlier this year. But CEO David Ellison is reportedly still keen on revitalizing MTV and other cable channels, though it’s still unclear exactly what that will entail.\n\nIn September, The Wall Street Journal reported that Ellison had fielded ideas for MTV from major players in the music industry like Irving Azoff, Lucian Grainge, and some big-name artists. There have also reportedly been discussions about turning MTV into an online streaming service that could potentially rival Spotify or YouTube.\n\nThe decision to cut MTV’s musical-only channels wasn’t the only cost-cutting measure the Paramount took this year. Back in February, when the Skydance merger was still in the works, MTV announced that it would shutter several awards shows, including the MTV Europe Music Awards and MTV Latin America’s MIAW Awards (formerly known as the Millennial Awards).",

    "description": "The 48th edition of the world's biggest cross-country rally is nearly upon us. Here’s a look at the main contenders for victory in Dakar",
    "fullText": "The 2026 Dakar Rally is shaping up to deliver one of the most closely fought battles in recent years. Ford and Dacia arrive in Saudi Arabia determined to apply the lessons they learned on their debut last year with the aim of ending Toyota’s dominance in the world’s most prestigious rally-raid. Toyota isn’t standing still either, and has introduced an all-new car to maintain its position at the front.\n\nThe rally itself features several changes, with both the route and the format having been altered by organiser ASO to add a fresh challenge.\n\nFollowing the ceremonial start and Prologue on 3 January, competitors will tackle nearly 8,000km across two weeks, crossing some of the most unforgiving terrain in the Middle East.\n\nHere’s a list of drivers considered to be the favourites for top honours in the Ultimate category:\n\nOne of the prime contenders for the 2026 Dakar Rally is reigning champion Yazeed Al-Rajhi. The Saudi billionaire had always been rapid in cross-country rallying, with Dakar’s move to his home country in 2020 cementing his position as a frontrunner. But last year he made the biggest strides, combining his raw pace with improved maturity to secure a maiden win against factory competition. Back at the wheel of a Toyota and supported by the highly experienced Overdrive customer team, he has all the ingredients required to defend his crown.\n\nThat said, the 44-year-old’s build-up to this year’s event has been far from ideal. A heavy crash at Baja Aragon in April left him with fractured vertebrae, forcing a lengthy spell on the sidelines. He returned to competition in Portugal with a subdued 22nd-place finish before his preparations suffered another setback when he retired from Rally Morocco.\n\nToyota’s charge in Dakar will be spearheaded by Henk Lategan. At 31 years of age, he is one of the younger drivers in the field, but with four Dakar appearances already under his belt, he appears ready to finally seal the crown. The South African proved in 2025 that he is capable of fighting for the overall victory, as he went toe-to-toe with the more experienced Al-Rajhi and claimed two individual stage wins along the way. Missing out on the top spot by just under four minutes will have only sharpened his determination to go one better this time around.\n\nToyota has a new weapon in Dakar this year in the form of the GR DKR Hilux, which features a lighter tubular chassis and reinforced transmission. The Japanese manufacturer has won Dakar three times in the last four years, and the updated model based on the Hilux pick-up will help stave off competition from newer rivals.\n\nIf there is one driver the Dakar field can never afford to underestimate, it is Nasser Al-Attiyah. The Qatari has been a relentless winning force over the past decade and arrives in 2026 determined to reclaim the crown after two comparatively difficult campaigns in 2024 and 2025. While Stephane Peterhansel’s record of eight outright victories in cars remains some distance away, Al-Attiyah could enhance his legacy by winning the rally with a fourth different manufacturer after his previous triumphs with Volkswagen, Mini and Toyota. Further, he is just one stage win away from leapfrogging both Peterhansel and Ari Vatanen to become the most successful Dakar driver in that metric.\n\nAl-Attiyah will also be able to benefit from an improved Dacia Sandrider, which won in both Abu Dhabi and Morocco last year after a rather underwhelming debut in Dakar at the start of the 2025 season.\n\nCarlos Sainz Sr. shows no signs of slowing as he prepares for his 19th Dakar Rally start at the age of 63. Sainz became the oldest driver to win the world’s most prestigious cross-country rally when he won the 2024 edition at the wheel of the Audi RS Q e-tron. His 2025 outing was cut short by a crash on Stage 2, but he is back this year to gun for a fifth overall victory.\n\nWinning Dakar with Ford would bring his career a full circle, having made his WRC debut back in 1987 at the wheel of a Cosworth-powered Sierra. Sainz also never managed to win a WRC title with the American marque (his 1990 and ‘92 championships were won with Toyota), so a Dakar triumph with Raptor would be one of the most satisfying achievements of his illustrious career.\n\nRally legend Sebastien Loeb arrives at Dakar with renewed momentum after closing out the 2025 World Rally-Raid Championship with three consecutive podiums, including a victory in the season-ending Morocco Rally. That should give him some encouragement after his most recent Dakar outing ended early due to car damage. Loeb will also have a new co-driver in the form of Al-Attiyah’s former navigator Edouard Boulanger. After a run of misfortune earlier in 2025, Loeb felt a reset was required, leading to a split with Fabian Lurquin, who has moved across to partner Al-Attiyah in a direct swap between the pair.\n\nIt remains to be seen if Dacia can build on its recent success and take on Toyota on the biggest stage, but a maiden Dakar victory for Loeb would be huge for his career, especially after Sebastien Ogier drew level with him on nine World Rally Championship titles in 2025.\n\nMattias Ekstrom’s recent Dakar form has been so convincing that he is now viewed less as a two-time DTM champion and more as a genuine rally-raid specialist. The Swede has shown a remarkable ability to adapt to new disciplines, a trait underlined in 2022 when he beat his more experienced Audi team-mates to finish ninth overall on debut.\n\nThat adaptability was again on display in 2025 when, after ending a decades-long association with Audi, he guided the factory Ford team to the podium, finishing behind only the dominant Toyotas of Al-Rajhi and Lategan.\n\nHow Ekstrom builds on that impressive performance will be one of the key storylines in 2026, particularly if Ford can produce a package capable of taking the Hilux head-on in Saudi Arabia.\n\nBeyond the established leading sextet, several other drivers on the entry list are capable of springing a surprise in 2026. Toyota driver Seth Quintero, for instance, will be a much more potent force in his third outing in the Ultimate category. Also stepping into a bigger role is two-time bike champion Toby Price, whose impressive Dakar debut in the car category with Overdrive last year earned him a promotion to Toyota’s factory line-up.\n\nAnother driver to watch out for is Lucas Moraes, who won the 2025 W2RC title with Toyota and has since joined an expanded four-car Dacia operation alongside Al-Attiyah, Loeb and Cristina Gutierrez.\n\nFord’s young gun Mitch Guthrie complemented Ekstrom well in 2025 and looks well placed to challenge for individual stage wins this year. His team-mate Nani Roma, a Dakar winner on both two and four wheels, should also never be discounted.\n\nOutside of Toyota, Ford and Dacia, two smaller manufacturers could regularly mix in the top 10 this year: Century and Mini. At Century, Matthieu Serradori and Brian Baragwanath have a history of punching above their team’s weight, while Mini also fields proven talents like Guillaume de Mevius and Lionel Baud.\n\nFinally, ‘Mr Dakar’ Peterhansel will also line up at the start in Yanbu on 3 January after missing the event in 2025, competing for Land Rover’s Defender brand in the Stock class.\n\nDakar 2026: Full route, schedule and marathon stage details\n\nRed Bull co-owner Mark Mateschitz to enter Dakar Rally under an alias\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

    "fullText": "According to a report from AS, Real Madrid scouts will closely monitor Kees Smit over the next six months before the 2026 FIFA World Cup.\n\nIt is known that the AZ Alkmaar youngster is being followed as part of Madrid’s wider plan to identify a midfield orchestrator capable of leading the team into the next cycle.\n\nAs mentioned many times in the past, Real Madrid are preparing to reinforce their midfield in the summer of 2026.\n\nWith that objective in mind, Smit has emerged as a profile that fits many of the club’s requirements.\n\nOver recent weeks, his name has gathered serious traction among scouts, not just in Spain but across Europe.\n\nCompetition for Smit’s signature is expected to be fierce.\n\nSeveral top clubs are aware of his rapid development, but Real Madrid believe their sporting project and global pull could be decisive if they choose to make a concrete move.\n\nThe club see him as a player who is young enough to grow, yet already mature enough to handle responsibility at the highest level.\n\nReal Madrid will keep an eye on Kees Smit. (Photo by Richard Pelham/Getty Images)\n\nAt just 19 years old, Smit has already taken important steps forward in his career. He has made his debut for the Dutch national team under Ronald Koeman, who is counting on him as part of his plans heading into the World Cup.\n\nKoeman’s faith has been telling, and comparisons to Pedri only underline the type of midfielder Smit is becoming.\n\nMeanwhile, Real Madrid’s interest is not new. Club scouts were first drawn to Smit during a Youth League match in the 2022–23 season, when AZ Alkmaar convincingly defeated Real Madrid 4-0.\n\nThat performance sparked sustained monitoring of his progress, and since then, his development has only reinforced the initial impressions.\n\nFrom now until the end of the season, the evaluation process will intensify. Madrid intend to observe him continuously, analysing not only his performances but also his consistency, personality, and response to pressure.\n\nHowever, under contract until 2028, AZ Alkmaar currently value him at around €60 million.\n\nIt is already a hefty figure for a player who turns 20 on January 21, but one that could climb even higher with strong international exposure.",

Quarterback Trinidad Chambliss carved up the Bulldogs for 362 yards and two touchdowns, repeatedly answering Georgia rallies with poise and precision. His 40-yard strike to De’Zhaun Stribling on third down late in the fourth quarter set up Lucas Carneiro’s decisive 47-yard field goal with six seconds remaining.\n\nCarneiro was flawless all night, drilling three field goals, including Sugar Bowl-record kicks of 55 and 56 yards as Ole Miss totaled 473 yards of offense. Georgia finished with 355 yards but couldn’t come up with the final stop when it mattered.\n\nGeorgia had erased a 10-point deficit in the final minutes, tying the game on Peyton Woodring’s field goal with 55 seconds left. That rally only heightened the drama before Ole Miss delivered the final blow.\n\nIt was the kind of result that shows why the games are played on the field.

    "fullText": "The imminent 130th anniversary of the Louis Vuitton monogram is less a birthday and more a demonstration of how powerful two letters can be.\n\nBorn in 1896, when the Époque was at its most Belle, the superposed initials LV appeared amidst a variety of foliate and geometrical motifs. At first it was not a success. “The public was initially reticent and demanded the chequered and even the striped canvas, but my father stood firm,” recalled Gaston-Louis Vuitton of his father Georges Vuitton, son of the founder.\n\nThe striped and chequered patterns he mentions refer to previous designs. Every decade or so, Vuitton changed the pattern of the canvas with which it covered its famous, flat-topped trunks. Trianon grey came first in 1858. In 1872, the grey gave way to stripes. The checkerboard Damier pattern came in 1888, and was the first time that the maker’s name appeared on luggage, with the words “Marque L Vuitton Déposée” (which translate as “L Vuitton registered trademark”) appearing every so often in the checks.\n\nThe Damier was intended to scare off counterfeiters. It didn’t work — which leads us to the monogram we know today. If Georges thought that this new design would deter the fakers, a summer stroll along a 21st-century Mediterranean beach, with its itinerant vendors of imposter Louis Vuitton bags, shows just how comprehensively he failed.\n\nGeorges Vuitton had inadvertently created one of, if not the, most recognisable hieroglyphs in the history of luxury goods. This was not branding as we know it today; it was more akin to an artist signing a canvas. As well as a hint of the Japonisme, the mania for all things Japanese that gripped France in the late 19th century, the geometric emblems attested to Georges Vuitton’s fascination with the ogives and spandrels of Gothic architecture. In particular, he was a great admirer of the work of Eugène Viollet-le-Duc, the French architect who revolutionised the study and restoration of medieval architecture.\n\nViollet-le-Duc’s reputation may since have faded, but the patterned monogram is known in every corner of the globe. This January, the house will embark on a year-long celebration with the familiar dramatis personae taking to the stage: the Speedy of 1930; the Keepall, also from 1930; the Noé, made for a champagne producer in 1932 to carry five bottles (four upright and the fifth inverted); the Alma, Parisian architecture translated into handbag in 1992; and, finally, the Neverfull of 2007 — capable, so Vuitton says, of carrying up to 100 kilogrammes but more usually functioning as a capacious tote.\n\nThe bags will appear in different guises throughout the anniversary year. Most striking of the three celebratory capsules is Monogram Origine, a collection of the classics (minus, for some reason, the Keepall), that returns to Georges’s first pattern but deploys a newly developed coated linen/cotton canvas that comes in its recognisable chocolate-brown Ebène shade as well as a soft rainbow of pastels. All of which provide further proof, if further proof were needed, that at 130 years of age, the famous monogram is as versatile as it is well known.",

    "fullText": "TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te on Thursday vowed to defend the self-ruled island’s sovereignty in the face of China’s “expansionist ambitions,” days after Beijing wrapped up live-fire military drills near its shores.\n\n“In the face of China’s rising expansionist ambitions, the international community is watching to see whether the Taiwanese people have the resolve to defend themselves,” Lai said in his New Year’s address.\n\n“As president, my stance has always been clear: to firmly safeguard national sovereignty, strengthen national defense and the resilience of the whole society, and comprehensively construct an effective deterrence and democratic defense mechanism,” he added.\n\nLai’s comments came days after China wrapped up live-fire drills around Taiwan featuring rocket launches, aircraft and warships. Beijing had expressed anger at a planned U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, as well as at Japan’s new leader’s comments that Tokyo could intervene in the event of a Chinese attack on Taiwan.\n\nChina sees Taiwan as its own territory and threatens to annex it by force if necessary. A former Japanese colony, Taiwan has been governed independently from the mainland since 1949, when the Nationalist Party lost a civil war against the Chinese Communist Party and retreated to the island.\n\nLai's speech was met angrily in Beijing, where a spokesperson for the State Council's Taiwan Affairs Office called the president “a saboteur of peace, a troublemaker and a warmonger,” according to the official Xinhua news agency.\n\n“No matter what Lai and the Democratic Progressive Party authorities say or do, they cannot change the fact that Taiwan is part of China,\" said spokesperson Chen Binhua.\n\nThe planned arms sale, valued at more than $11 billion, is the U.S.’s largest so far to Taiwan. It includes missiles, drones, artillery systems and military software.\n\nThe United States is obligated by its own laws to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself.\n\nChina’s leader Xi Jinping called Taiwan’s eventual annexation “ unstoppable \" during his own televised New Year’s address on Wednesday.\n\nTaiwan last year announced a special $40 billion budget for arms purchases, including to build an air defense system with high-level detection and interception capabilities called the Taiwan Dome.\n\nThe budget will be allocated over eight years, from 2026 to 2033, and comes after Lai already pledged to raise defense spending to 5% of the island’s GDP, as part of his strategy amid China’s threats of invasion.\n\n“Facing China’s serious military ambitions, Taiwan has no time to wait,” Lai said.\n\nMistreanu reported from Beijing.",

    "fullText": "CRANS-MONTANA, Switzerland (AP) — Swiss investigators are probing what caused a fire in a bar at an Alpine ski resort that left around 40 people dead and another 115 injured during a New Year's celebration.\n\nMost injuries, many of them serious, occurred when the blaze swept through the crowded bar less than two hours after midnight Thursday in southwestern Switzerland.\n\nThe Crans-Montana resort is best known as an international ski and golf venue. Overnight, its crowded Le Constellation bar morphed from a scene of revelry into the site of potentially one of Switzerland’s worst tragedies.\n\nCrans-Montana is less than 5 kilometers (3 miles) from Sierre, Switzerland, where 28 people, including many children, were killed when a bus from Belgium crashed inside a Swiss tunnel in 2012.\n\nHere’s what we know about the deadly fire:\n\nThe blaze broke out around 1:30 a.m. Thursday inside the Le Constellation bar amid the holiday celebration.\n\nTwo women told French broadcaster BFMTV they were inside when they saw a male bartender lifting a female bartender on his shoulders as she held a lit candle in a bottle. The flames spread, collapsing the wooden ceiling, they told the broadcaster.\n\nPeople frantically tried to escape from the basement nightclub up a narrow flight of stairs and through a narrow door, causing a crowd surge, one of the women said.\n\nA young man at the scene said people smashed windows to escape the fire, some gravely injured, reported BFMTV. He said he saw about 20 people scrambling to get out of the smoke and flames, likening what happened to a horror movie.\n\nThe injured were so numerous that the intensive care unit and operating theater at the regional hospital quickly hit full capacity, said Mathias Reynard, head of the regional government of the Valais Canton.\n\nOfficials rule out possible attack\n\nWhile officials said Thursday it was too early to determine the fire's cause, investigators have already ruled out that it could have been an attack.\n\nExperts have not yet been able to go inside the wreckage, said Beatrice Pilloud, Valais Canton attorney general, at a news conference.\n\nWork is underway to identify the victims and inform their families, according to Valais Canton police commander Frédéric Gisler.\n\nThe blaze triggered a flashover or backdraft\n\nThe Swiss officials called the blaze an “embrasement généralisé,” a French firefighting term describing how a blaze can trigger the release of combustible gases that can then ignite violently and cause what English-speaking firefighters would call a flashover or a backdraft.\n\nVictims suffered from serious burns and smoke inhalation. Some were flown to specialist hospitals across the country.\n\nAuthorities urged people to show caution in the coming days to avoid any accidents that could require the already overwhelmed medical resources.\n\nA top venue for the world's best athletes\n\nWith high-altitude ski runs rising around 3,000 meters (nearly 9,850 feet) in the heart of the Valais region’s snowy peaks and pine forests, Crans-Montana is one of the top venues on the World Cup circuit.\n\nThe resort will host the best men’s and women’s downhill racers, including Lindsey Vonn, for their final events before the Milan Cortina Olympics in February.\n\nThe town’s Crans-sur-Sierre golf club, down the street from the bar, stages the European Masters each August on a picturesque course.\n\nDazio reported from Berlin and Leicester reported from Paris. Geir Moulson in Berlin and Graham Dunbar in Geneva contributed to this report.",

    "fullText": "Scent of the pine trees –\n\n A lizard scurries\n\n Across the hot stone.\n\nIn 1927, Le Temps retrouvé [Time Regained] was published in Paris. The same year saw the publication of Heidegger’s Being and Time in Germany. There are numerous similarities between these two works, which, at first glance, seem so different. Like Proust’s project on time, Being and Time sets itself against the increasing disintegration of human existence, against the decay of time into a mere sequence of point-like presences. Contrary to Heidegger’s aspiration that Being and Time represent a phenomenology of human existence of timeless validity, his work is in reality a product of its time. Historically specific processes and time-independent characteristics of human existence are intermingled in it. Thus, Heidegger offers a problematic explanation of the ‘destruction of the everyday world’1 through acceleration, which he says is the result of a ‘tendency towards nearness’ that is intrinsic to Dasein’s essence:\n\nDasein is essentially de-distancing. As the being that it is, it lets beings be encountered in nearness … An essential tendency towards nearness lies in Dasein. All kinds of increasing speed which we are more or less compelled to go along with today\r\n push for overcoming distance. With the ‘radio’, for example, Dasein is bringing about today a de-distancing of the ‘world’, which is unforeseeable in its meaning for Dasein, by way of expanding and destroying the everyday surrounding world.2\n\nTo what extent is ‘de-distancing’ – as a mode of being of Dasein, which I use as a means for spatially opening up my surroundings – related to that unleashed acceleration which steers towards the suspension of space itself? Apparently, Heidegger does not realize that the age of the radiophonic, even the entire ‘age of haste’, is based on forces far greater than the ‘tendency towards nearness’ intrinsic to Dasein’s essence, and which make Dasein’s orientation in space possible in the first place. The total removal of space is something altogether different from that ‘de-distancing’ which affords Dasein a spatial existence.\n\nThe new media abolish space itself. Hyperlinks make pathways disappear. Electronic mail does not need to conquer mountains and oceans. Strictly speaking, it is no longer something ‘ready-to-hand’. Instead of ‘hands’ it immediately reaches the eyes. The age of the new media is an age of implosion. Space and time implode into a here and now. Everything is subject to de-distancing. There are no longer any sacred spaces which one may not ‘de-distance’, i.e. spaces whose being set aside [Ausgespartsein] is part of their essence. Spaces with a scent hold their appearance in reserve [sparen ihr Erscheinen]. An auratic distance is inherent in them. The contemplative, lingering gaze is not de-distancing. In his later writings, Heidegger himself turned against the unlimited de-distancing of the world. Thus, origin is something which ‘halts in its withdrawal, and holds itself in reserve’.3 It does not exhaust or divest itself. According to Heidegger, the ‘nearness to the origin is a nearness which still holds something back in reserve’ [sparende Nähe].4\n\nThe ‘they’, which Heidegger generalizes into an ontological constant, is in reality a phenomenon of his time. It is, in a manner of speaking, a contemporary of Heidegger’s. Thus, the temporal experience of the ‘they’ corresponds exactly to the ‘cinematographic’ time which, according to Proust, characterizes the ‘age of haste’. Time is dispersed into a mere sequence of point-like presences. The ‘they’ ‘is so little interested in the “matter in question” that, as soon as it catches sight of it, it already is looking for the next thing’.5 The ‘they’ zaps through the world. Thus, Heidegger speaks of a ‘dispersed non-lingering’ and of a ‘never dwelling anywhere’ [Aufenthaltslosigkeit].6\n\nHeidegger realized early on that the emptiness of being goes hand in hand with the acceleration of life. In his lecture course of 1929/30, he says:\n\nWhy do we find no meaning for ourselves any more, i.e. no essential possibility of being? Is it because an indifference yawns at us out of all things, an indifference whose grounds we do not know? Yet who can speak in such a way when world trade, technology, and the economy seize hold of man and keep him moving?7\n\nHeidegger explains the general haste in terms of the inability to perceive silence, the long-lasting and slowness. Where there is no duration, acceleration, in the sense of a purely quantitative intensification, sets in, in order to compensate for the lack of duration, even for the lack of being:\n\nAcceleration [Die Schnelligkeit] … not-being-able-to-bear the stillness of hidden growth … purely quantitative enhancement, blindness to what is truly momentary, which is not fleeting but opens up eternity.8\n\nHeidegger’s philosophy of time is connected to his times. Thus, his critical comments regarding time, for instance about the permanent shortage of time, are also aimed at his times:\n\nWhy do we have no time? To what extent do we not wish to lose any time? Because we need it and wish to use it. For what? For our everyday occupations, to which we have long since become enslaved…. This not having any time is ultimately a greater being lost of the self than that wasting time which leaves itself time.9\n\nHeidegger invokes ‘what is essential in Dasein’ and what ‘cannot be forcibly brought about by any busyness or mad rush’.10 ‘Essential existence’ is ‘slow’. Heidegger explicitly turns against the ‘modern’, which is characterized by point-like presences and discontinuity.11 As a characteristic manifestation of modernity, the ‘they’ only perceives the narrow tip of the actual. Thus, it rushes from one presence to the next.\n\nThe decay of time also takes hold of the identity of Dasein. Dasein is ‘dispersed in the multiplicity of what “happens” daily’.12 It is ‘lost in the making present of the today’,13 and thus loses the continuity of its self. The age of haste is an age of ‘dispersion’. This awakens the need ‘to pull itself together [ Zusammenholen ] from the dispersion and the disconnectedness’.14 But narrative identity only establishes a connection, while Heidegger’s strategy regarding the question of identity is to aim for the extraction of ‘the primordial stretching along of the whole of existence, which is not lost and does not need a connection’, namely ‘a steadiness that has been stretched along – the steadiness in which Da-sein as fate “incorporates” into its existence birth and death and their “between”’.15 This ‘fatefully whole[,] stretching’,16 namely history, is more than a story which establishes a connection. It is not a narratively\r\n constructed picture, but a pre-narrative framing which encloses ‘birth and death and their “between”’. Dasein assures itself of itself independently of a narrative construction of identity. Heidegger’s strategy regarding time and identity is a response to the narrative crisis of his times. The strategy formulates a notion of identity which would still be viable in an age of general de-narrativization.\n\nBeing and Time is based on an insight that is specific to its times, that the loss of historical meaningfulness leads to the decay of time into an accelerating sequence of isolated events, that because of a lack of gravitation or an anchoring in meaning time rushes off without hold or aim. Heidegger’s strategy regarding time consists in a re-anchoring of time; in giving it significance, a new hold; in enframing it again within a historical line [Zug], so that it does not disperse into a meaningless, accelerating succession of events. Against the threatened end of history, Heidegger emphatically invokes history itself. However, he knows very well that the gravitation, the historical meaningfulness which is meant to set time right again, cannot be of a theological or teleological kind, and he therefore opts for an existential concept of history instead. The historical traction now originates from the emphasis on the self. Heidegger concentrates time by integrating the temporal horizons by way of their relation to the self. History as directed time protects time against decay, against its dispersion into a pure sequence of point-like presences. In this, it is the self that provides the direction. The ‘constancy of the self’, this essence of authentic historicity, is duration, which does not pass. It does not elapse. The one who exists authentically has time always, so to speak. He or she always has time because time is self, and does not lose time because of not losing him- or herself:\n\nJust as the person who exists inauthentically constantly loses time and never ‘has’ any, it is the distinction of the temporality of authentic existence that in resoluteness it never loses time and ‘always has time’.17\n\nThe shortage of time, on the contrary, is a symptom of inauthentic existence. Dasein in its inauthentic existence loses its time because it loses itself to the world: ‘Busily losing himself in what is taken care of, the irresolute person loses his time in them, too. Hence, his characteristic way of talking: “I have no time”.’18 Ultimately, Heidegger’s strategy regarding time consists in transforming ‘I have no time’ into ‘I always have time.’ It is a strategy based on duration, an attempt at regaining the lost mastery of time through an existential mobilization of the self.\n\nIn his later writings, Heidegger moves further and further away from the historical model of time. The place of history is taken by the seasons or other figures of repetition:\n\nIn the pathway’s seasonally changing breeze this knowing gladsomeness … thrives … Along its trail winter’s storm encounters harvest’s day, the agile excitation of Spring and the serene dying of Autumn meet, the child’s game and the elder’s wisdom gaze at each other. And in a unique harmony, whose echo the pathway carries with it silently here and there, everything is made gladsome.19\n\nThe ‘silent harmony’ of the seasons and its echo, which continues, even renews itself in the ‘here and there’, suggest duration. The world is an acoustic space with its own natural oscillation, in which nothing fades away or elapses. The ‘gathering play’ which surrenders nothing to disappearance or dispersion creates a fulfilled duration:\n\nIn the coolness of the autumn day, the fire of summer finishes\r\n in cheerful serenity … The cheerful serenity of the autumn coolness, which harbors the summer within itself, drifts about this country path every year with its gathering play.20\n\nAgain and again, Heidegger uses the trope of the ‘back and forth’21 as a counter-trope to historical time. In the movement of the back-and-forth, time comes to stand still [zum Stehen], so to speak. A duration a-rises [ent-steht] Heidegger’s poem ‘Time’ goes:\n\nHow far?\n\n Only when it stops, the clock,\n\n with its pendulum swinging back and forth,\n\n only then do you hear: it goes and is gone and goes\n\n no more.\n\n Already late in the day, the clock,\n\n only a faint track toward time,\n\n which, near finitude,\n\n a-rises from it.22\n\nThe ‘back and forth’ produces duration within cyclical change. Heidegger’s Pathway is itself constructed like a pendulum clock. The text sets out with the words: ‘It runs from the park gate towards Ehnried’. And towards the end of the text, we read: ‘From Ehnried the way turns back to the park gate.’23 The back-and-forth of its course makes the pathway a figure of repetition and gathering. Nothing progresses without returning. All Forth is caught by a Back, as if by an echo. This back-and-forth is also reflected in the play of children:\n\nOut of the oak’s bark the boys carved their boats: equipped with rudder and tiller they floated in Metten brook or in the\r\n school fountain. The world-wide journeys of these games reached their destination [Ziel] easily and found their way back to shore again.24\n\nNothing is lost to indeterminacy. And nothing is subject to change. The country path is a silent place of eternal repetition. Everything remains gathered: ‘The pathway gathers in whatever has its coming-to-presence [sein Wesen] along the way; to all who pass this way it gives what is theirs.’25 Everything rests in the timelessly valid ‘coming-to-presence’, in an eternal presence. The pathway’s back-and-forth silences the world into the ‘Same’. In the pendulum strokes of its back-and-forth, the world a- rises. The pathway represents a clearly delineated world of duration with its own natural oscillation. Everything stands within the simple lustre of a perspicuous order. Nothing escapes the eye and hand of the mother: ‘The eye and hand of the mother surrounded their world [i.e. that of all things]. It was as if her unspoken care protected all that came to be [alles Wesen].’26\n\nThe country path does not strive towards a goal [Ziel]. Rather, it rests in itself in contemplative fashion. It illustrates a via contemplativa. The back-and-forth frees it from having a goal without exposing it to destructive dispersion. A peculiar gathering is intrinsic to it. It does not follow a course towards … but lingers. It silences the directed, spasmodic time of labour into duration. As a place for contemplative lingering, the path symbolizes a dwelling that does not need a goal or purpose, one that can do without a theology or teleology.\n\nThe world is a ‘round dance’ of ‘earth and sky, divinities and mortals’.27 The ‘round dance’ is at the same time a temporal formula, an eternal circling in itself which prevents any spatio-temporal dispersion. Everything remains gathered in the ‘ring’ of the world,\r\n in the ‘radiance of their [i.e. of the fourfold’s] simple oneness’.28 The ‘sky’, too, is a timeless circling in itself, an eternal up-and-down. It is the ‘path of the sun, the course of the changing moon, the wandering glitter of the stars, the year’s seasons and their changes, the light and dusk of day, the gloom and glow of night, the clemency and inclemency of weather, the drifting clouds and blue depth of the ether’.29 At the temporal level, the strictly symmetrical structure of the world creates the impression of a time that stands still. The symmetry of the world, which suggests an immovable, uniform order, extends into language. Heidegger even emphasizes it with special figures of speech. His philosophy consists not only of arguments, but – problematically – also of verses. Types of syntax and rhyme patterns are intentionally employed to create, for instance, the feeling of an eternally valid order. Thus, the beautiful, symmetrical order of the world, the ‘fouring’, is invoked,30 in a poem that is, not coincidentally, made up of two stanzas of four symmetrically composed lines. The ‘radiance of their simple oneness’30 is completed in the metrical radiance of ‘mist diffuses/blessing muses’ [Regen rinnt/Segen sinnt].\n\nForests spread\n\n Brooks plunge Rocks persist\n\n Mist diffuses\n\n Meadows wait\n\n Springs well\n\n Winds dwell\n\n Blessing muses31\n\n1.

The English translation opts for ‘everyday surrounding world’. The difference between ‘Welt’ and ‘Umwelt’ is relevant in light of Heidegger’s presentation of the animal’s poverty in world, and his references to Uexküll’s notion of ‘Umwelt’, in The Fundamental Concepts of Metaphysics, trans. William McNeill and Nicholas Walker (Bloomington/ Indiana: Indiana University Press, 1995), where this serves the purpose of distinguishing animals and human beings.

    "fullText": "The billionaire – who had no government experience – left various federal agencies in disarray while overseeing an ‘efficiency’ drive across Washington\n\nAs Elon Musk, the world’s richest person, splurged more than $250m on Donald Trump’s 2024 re-election campaign, the US president commissioned his new ally to oversee a sweeping “efficiency” drive across the federal government.\n\nThe Tesla and SpaceX boss, who had no experience inside government, was tasked with eradicating waste and cutting spending as part of the so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) – and was quick to stoke expectations.\n\n“I think we can do at least $2tn,” Musk declared of the potential savings during a campaign rally at Madison Square Garden in New York City a week before Trump’s re-election.\n\nFollowing Trump’s return to office in January, these ambitious plans were swiftly on a collision course with reality. Tens of thousands of federal workers were fired, leaving agencies in disarray and triggering myriad legal challenges.\n\nJust four months into the administration, Musk abruptly announced his exit. Six months later, it was reported that Doge was no more. Musk has even said he wouldn’t do it again.\n\n“That was all complete bullshit from the beginning,” Elaine Kamarck, a former White House official and expert on government reform, told the Guardian. “The fact that they even said it and then had to go roll it way, way, way back into the low hundreds of billions, tells you they didn’t know what they were doing.”\n\nKamarck created and managed the National Performance Review, which aimed to improve efficiency and reduce costs, during the Clinton administration.\n\nAs of December, the agency’s purported savings, which reports have demonstrated are rife with errors, inaccuracies, and exaggerations, have reached $214bn.\n\nHowever much has been cut from the federal budget, the urgency surrounding Doge in its early weeks and months prompted widespread disruption, and even mistakes. Analysis by the Brookings Institution recorded 26,511 occasions where the Trump administration fired people, and then hired them back.\n\n“What they did was they sowed chaos to no avail,” said Kamarck. “Doge was done in an incredibly careless way, without regard for what the agencies did and whether and moreover, whether or not Americans liked what they did.\n\n“You can cut the government. I did it in the Clinton administration,” she added. “We cut the government by 420,000 people, but we did it over a period of seven years, and we did it in the context of mission and what we no longer needed to do, etc.\n\n“In other words, we had a plan that works with the mission of the agency. This business of coming in and moving fast and breaking things which they like to do in Silicon Valley just doesn’t work in the government.”\n\nQuestions were raised last month about whether Doge was even still operating. “That doesn’t exist,” the office of personnel management (OPM) director, Scott Kupor, told Reuters. (An account for the agency on X, formerly Twitter, disputed this claim.)\n\nBut Musk had long moved on. During a recent podcast interview with former Doge adviser Katie Miller, the tycoon described the effort he once suggested could identify $2tn in savings for the federal government as “a little bit successful”. Asked if he would do it again, he responded: “I don’t think so ... Instead of doing Doge, I would have, basically, built … worked on my companies.”\n\nHow much efficiency can be achieved from having multiple operations inside the federal government, seeking efficiencies? Philip G Joyce, professor of public policy at the University of Maryland, said Doge was “unnecessary” given the longstanding existence of the Government Accountability Office (GAO), which has logged $1.45tn in savings across over 29,000 federal operations since 2002.\n\nRussell Vought, the White House office of management and budget director and architect of the rightwing Project 2025 blueprint, said in September that he believes the GAO shouldn’t exist.\n\n“I can understand why he thinks that,” said Joyce. “Because the Government Accountability Office, as an agency of the Congress, is helping the Congress to try to hold the executive branch accountable. It’s uncomfortable to be held accountable, but that doesn’t make it bad.”\n\nRather than reinforce the balance of power between the different branches of government, Joyce argued that Doge was a mechanism to eliminate and cut things the government does that are ideologically opposed by the Trump administration – without congressional approval.\n\n“What Doge was doing was not trying to take the operations of government and make it more efficient. They were basically just trying to come in and almost randomly sort of decide that they were going to just eliminate a significant number of things that the government does,” he said. “Even upfront, it was clear that they had really no understanding of the federal budget. And then when they went into the agencies, it became even clearer.”\n\nWhen Doge descended on the Social Security Administration in February, Chuck Borges was serving as chief data officer. Musk was touting false and misleading claims alleging fraud and abuse at the agency, including claims people over 120 years old were still receiving benefits.\n\nBorges resigned in August, and filed a whistleblower complaint over how Doge left the public’s social security data exposed. “What I identified was that social security data was apparently being copied into an insecure or unsecured cloud environment, or you could characterize it as a cloud environment without independent security monitoring,” he told the Guardian. “What I was alleging was that there was a risk being put on the data by keeping it in a manner not consistent with agency policy, agency requirements and industry best practices.”\n\nBorges is now running for a state senate seat in Maryland. “I believe that if we don’t find a way to build strong, sustainable, growing communities locally, and I’d like to start with where I live, then the nation isn’t going to have a lot of seeds which it can use to grow and recover from where we are today,” he said.\n\nMany Doge staffers are now reportedly embedded inside federal agencies across government. Many of the issues it posed around transparency, and the impact of sweeping decisions, are still being fought over in court.\n\n“Doge has been operating with minimal transparency but maximal authority,” said Donald K Sherman, executive director and chief counsel of the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (Crew), which filed a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit against Doge in February, alleging that it had failed to comply with recordkeeping and transparency laws.\n\n“There’s pretty significant misalignment in terms of how the administration claims Doge has been beneficial to the American public, and what information it wants the American public to have access to about Doge’s operations,” said Sherman. “We’ve spent months litigating because this administration does not want the public to know what Doge is doing, how Doge is operating.”\n\nApproached for comment, the White House did not provide detailed responses to questions on Doge’s record.\n\n“President Trump pledged to cut the waste, fraud, and abuse in our bloated government, and the Administration is committed to delivering on this pledge for the American people,” said spokesperson Davis Ingle.\n\nThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.\n\nIf you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.\n\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\n\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

It's often paired with crusty bread, making for the perfect winter meal.\n\nFrom the sodium-heavy instant packs found in every American college dorm to award-winning ramen restaurants in Tokyo, ramen has developed into a global obsession. Over 100 billion servings of ramen are consumed globally each year.\n\nHere are some instant-ramen hacks to help you level up your next bowl.\n\nWe have Montreal to thank for Canada's unofficial national dish, poutine, which also sometimes goes by its informal nickname, \"Canadian salad.\" The iconic dish consists of crispy, golden fries topped with cheese curds and drenched in gravy.\n\nChilaquiles translates to \"in a sauce of chiles,\" and is a dish consisting of heaps of crisp tortilla triangles tossed in a pan with salsa, and then piled with crumbled cheese and crema.\n\nChilaquiles are also often enjoyed for breakfast.\n\nIf you're harboring any reservations about just how delicious battered fish and crispy fries taste when dipped in a creamy tartar sauce, do yourself a favor and embark on a mission to make your own fish and chips at home.\n\nA standard \"full English\" — also called a fry-up — includes things like roasted tomatoes, fried eggs, sausage, and baked beans, sometimes piled onto toast.\n\nWiener schnitzel, the national dish of Austria, consists of boneless, mallet-thinned meat, usually veal, that is then breaded and deep-fried until it reaches prime crispiness.\n\nOriginally from the region of Lazio, which is around Rome, this decadent spaghetti is a creamy mix of guanciale, velvety olive oil, fatty egg yolk, and nutty Parmesan cheese.\n\nThink of these Aussie favorites like the larger, heartier, and more sophisticated version of pigs-in-a-blanket.\n\nPierogies are boiled dumplings that are typically filled with a mixture of potatoes and cheese curds, and often enjoyed with a generous dollop of sour cream and caramelized onions.\n\nMatzo balls — which are made from matzo meal and eggs, and often consumed during Passover — are doughy, rich soup dumplings that have a delicious tendency to soak up all the flavors of the broth in which they're submerged.\n\nCongee — a soothing type of rice porridge that is so extensively cooked that the individual grains of rice coalesce into an almost homogeneous base — is popular in many East Asian countries, and is often fortified with different garnishes and ingredients to amplify the flavor.\n\nThe simple comfort mainstay known as the grilled-cheese sandwich can come dressed up or au naturel — just as long as it comes with a side of tomato soup for dunking.\n\nHere's how to make the perfect grilled cheese, according to a cheese expert.\n\nThis pizza is more pie-like, with a hearty serving of sauce and a stuffed crust.\n\nThe exact origins of the dish are debated, but Eater Chicago calls Lou Malnati's Pizzeria \"one of the original inventors of the Chicago deep dish.\"\n\nArguably Germany's most widely valued culinary contribution, bratwursts are thick German-style sausages that are frequently paired with stewed sauerkraut and a tall, cool beer.\n\nKare-kare gets its signature flavor from a thick and savory peanut sauce.\n\nRich, smoky, vibrant, and nourishing, Valencians take their paella, a rice dish topped with seafood, seriously — it is Spain's best-known culinary export, after all.\n\nNPR reported that Khichuri, also called Khichdi, is an ancient Indian comfort dish made from rice and lentils that is typically prepared in one pot.\n\nButter chicken, otherwise known as murgh makhani, is made with chicken in a creamy tomato and butter sauce.\n\nButter chicken is similar to the British-Indian dish chicken tikka masala, but The Indian Express reported that butter chicken originated in New Delhi.\n\nMofongo, a ball-shaped dish of pickled, fried, and then smashed plantains that are flavored with garlic, salt, and oil in a wooden pilón, is a Puerto Rican staple usually served alongside a hearty stew or broth.\n\nMoussaka, a baked dish that can be described as Greece's version of lasagna, typically features layers of fried eggplant, potatoes, ground meat, and spices, all topped off with grated cheese and a cream sauce such as béchamel.\n\nShakshuka is a stew of eggs poached in a spicy sauce of tomatoes, chiles, and onions flavored with cumin. While it likely originated in North Africa, it is a popular dish throughout the Middle East.\n\nPicadillo, a Cuban-style hash, routinely features a base of ground beef and tomatoes, but you'll find different renditions of the dish depending on which region you're eating it in. Some prefer it with olives for a salty kick; others enjoy it with raisins for sweetness.\n\nGoulash is a hearty, paprika-flavored stew with cubes of seared beef, parsnips, carrots, and potatoes.\n\nSwedish meatballs are served at most holidays and special events in Sweden. The meatballs are commonly made with a mixture of ground beef and pork, swimming in a delicious gravy of meat juices, flour, and butter.\n\nIKEA, founded in Sweden, famously sells its own, too — and it sells a lot of them: around 1 billion meatballs globally each year.\n\nThick, stick-to-your-ribs soups make up the backbone of Iranian cooking. Ash Reshteh, a noodle soup full of beans, herbs, and yogurt, is arguably the most famous type.\n\nSoft, pillowy, and marked with gorgeous golden spots, naan, which is baked in a hot tandoori clay oven, is a type of bread that's perfect for dipping or relishing on its own.\n\nJamaica's national fruit, the ackee, is the star of ackee and saltfish, the island's national dish, a salty and savory sautée that's often served with fried plantains and rice.\n\nBorscht, a sour soup with a vibrant red color, thanks to its primary ingredient of beets, is traditionally made with meat or bone stock, sautéed veggies, and fermented beetroot juice, although there are countless variations of the dish.",

    "fullText": "It's going to be quite the 12 months in the world of football, but so as not to get too surprised about the upcoming year, we're doing our best to predict what will happen in 2026 ...\n\n📸 Justin Setterfield - 2025 Getty Images\n\nRichard Buxton: Arsenal winning the quadruple.\n\nPeter Fitzpatrick: We finally get a verdict on the Manchester City vs. Premier League case.\n\nDylan Krain: Harry Kane will either win the Champions League with Bayern Munich or the World Cup with England.\n\nHannah Pinnock: Liverpool will win the Champions League in Budapest. Wild only because of how poor they've been this season.\n\nAndrew Thompson: Erling Haaland completes football by leading Norway to a shock 2026 World Cup triumph.\n\nAlex Waite: Arsenal comfortably holding off City and Villa and strolling to the Premier League title without any hiccups whatsoever.\n\nPádraig Whelan: Scott McTominay will lead Scotland to World Cup glory in the summer. A man can dream right?\n\nRB: Mohamed Salah leaving Liverpool looks likely but Real Madrid moving on Vinícius Júnior will be the big story unless the axe falls on Xabi Alonso.\n\nPF: Salah will almost certainly leave Liverpool but he is approaching 34 so it won't be as shocking as Vini Jr. going to Saudi Arabia less than two years after being \"robbed\" of the Ballon d'Or.\n\nDK: Vinícius Júnior is 25 years old and should be entering his prime. Naturally, a move away from Real Madrid would be a pivotal moment in the Brazilian's career.\n\nHP: Vini Jr leaving Real Madrid, most likely for Saudi Arabia as it's difficult to see any clubs in Europe affording his mega wages.\n\nAT: It's gotta be Mo Salah leaving the red half of Liverpool. The possible departure of a club icon and one of the greats of the Premier League era will shift landscapes.\n\nAW: Mo Salah heading to Saudi all the way for me. Hard to see how he comes back completely after the recent turmoil.\n\nPW: It is already dominating the news and a big tournament at AFCON will throw Mo Salah's Liverpool future under the spotlight even more. If he does go, it will be the biggest move of the year.\n\nRB: Manchester United giving up the ghost on Ruben Amorim would definitely set the wheels in motion but in the absence of that, Tottenham parting ways with Thomas Frank will trigger a fair bit of upheaval in the Premier League.\n\nPF: Pep Guardiola finally departing Manchester City. His replacement is anyone's guess.\n\nDK: After only six months in charge, Xabi Alonso already seems to be on thin ice (as Real Madrid managers often are). If the pressure doesn't let up, he could be gone by the season’s end.\n\nHP: Real Madrid parting ways with Xabi Alonso in the summer and Liverpool making the difficult call on Arne Slot. Alonso to start the 2026/27 season in charge at Anfield.\n\nAT: Cèsc Fabregas replacing Enzo Maresca at Chelsea should he move on.\n\nAW: I can't see Thomas Frank lasting for too much longer at Tottenham but if Oliver Glasner leaves Palace, Frank could end up in the dugout at Selhurst Park next season.\n\nPW: He has denied them but the rumours about Pep Guardiola's future intensified in the last month. Could he walk away at the end of the season?\n\nRB: It's not really a surprise given where they are currently but Fiorentina dropping out of Serie A after 22 seasons will be huge for a club of their stature and history.\n\nPF: The best title race by far is in Italy with the top of Serie A reminiscent of its former glory days. Roma and Gian Piero Gasperini could just pull off an iconic title win.\n\nDK: Serie A is in the midst of the most competitive title race in Europe’s big five leagues, with the top five teams separated by just four points. There are still plenty of surprises to come.\n\nHP: Aston Villa may not have enough to win the Premier League, but they could make a surprise push for a top three, potentially even top two finish.\n\nAT: Arsenal manage to hold off the Manchester City onslaught and break their Premier League title duck.\n\nAW: Aston Villa have caught the eye in the Premier League so far and I can see them keeping pace with City and Arsenal for the duration this season.\n\nPW: Lens hold a slender lead in Ligue 1 but are unlikely to last the pace. It is hard to make a case for any major surprises this season.\n\nHP: Liverpool (got to stick with my earlier prediction).\n\nRB: France are still the overriding favourites but Spain look more than capable of going all the way.\n\nPF: Barring Troy Parrott carrying Ireland the whole way, I'll go with Brazil as Carlo Ancelotti completes football and restores the Seleção to their perch.\n\nDK: This might just be the year football comes home... England have a strong squad and Thomas Tuchel has proven adept at navigating knockout competitions.\n\nHP: France. Too much talent not to win it.\n\nAT: I hate to be the one to potentially jinx it for a few of my colleagues, but England under Thomas Tuchel may finally have the tactical acumen to get over the final hurdle.\n\nAW: I won't say England because there's bound to be some disappointment along the way there! When Spain get going, they are a serious force, so La Roja it is.\n\nPW: Well if it isn't to be Scotland, France look a formidable side to overcome.\n\nRB: Kylian Mbappé and Alexia Putellas.\n\nPF: Kylian Mbappé and Alexia Putellas\n\nDK: Erling Haaland and Alexia Putellas.\n\nHP: Kylian Mbappé and Clàudia Pina.\n\nAT: Kylian Mbappé and Alexia Putellas.\n\nAW: Kylian Mbappé and Alexia Putellas.\n\nPW: Kylian Mbappé, Alexia Putellas.\n\nRB: Everton's Harrison Armstrong has been earning rave reviews on loan at Preston North End and looks a superb all-round midfielder. It's only a matter of time before he gains David Moyes' trust and gets a regular run of Premier League experience.\n\nPF: Ayden Heaven has impressed at United and could find himself in England contention by the end of 2026.\n\nDK: Following an eye-catching start to his Chelsea career, Estêvão looks set to have a breakout World Cup as a starter for Brazil, no less.\n\nHP: Ayyoub Bouaddi is already catching the eye for Lille in Ligue 1, so it's no surprise to see Europe's top clubs linked. A big move could propel him to the very top.\n\nAT: Yan Diomande at RB Leipzig (clubmate Antonio Nusa is also a shout, especially if he stars at the World Cup for Norway).\n\nAW: Lennart Karl has already looked the part at Bayern and hitting it big on the international stage is the next step for the talented teenager.\n\nPW: He's already made a good impression and name for himself but Estêvão at Chelsea looks like having all the tools to be a superstar.\n\nRB: A largely disruption-free World Cup.\n\nPF: The good parts of the World Cup.\n\nDK: The World Cup coming to my home city for the first time.\n\nHP: A dramatic end to what is shaping up to be one of the most thrilling Premier League campaigns at both ends of the table.\n\nAT: The World Cup not being the categorical nightmare it's currently shaping up to be.\n\nAW: The expanded World Cup with so many newcomers.\n\nPW: They only come around every four years so bring on the World Cup.\n\n📸 MANDEL NGAN - Afp or licensors",

    "description": "The year 2025 was trash. Let’s hope 2026 is better for the Orioles and the world.",
    "fullText": "You’ve made it! The cursed year 2025 is over and you have survived. 2026 will surely bring its own share of challenges but hopefully at least within the sphere of our favorite baseball team things will go better on the strength of internal and external improvements to the roster that are made this offseason.\n\nThere are now 84 days remaining until Orioles Opening Day. The start of spring training is much closer, as if you want to go by the pitchers/catchers report date for WBC participants, that’s just a month and eight days away from today. It will be here before you know it.\n\nIs there another major Orioles move to be made between now and then? Today could turn out to be a day of big news regarding Japanese pitcher Tatsuya Imai’s signing with an MLB team. The deadline for him to sign is tomorrow and when you consider that there’s still going to be a physical involved, today might be the real day to lock down a framework of an agreement, and that will probably be reported if it happens rather than remain a secret until tomorrow.\n\nI don’t know how much Mike Elias actually wants Imai or whether his want exceeds what other GMs will be willing to offer. I’m not expecting the Orioles to really be in on this, but who knows. It does still feel like there’s a need to be addressed at the top of the rotation, so if it’s not Imai, then pivoting to Ranger Suárez or Framber Valdez, whose markets will probably be impacted by where and for what price Imai signs, could still be in play.\n\nOr maybe another trade? Who knows. With apologies for repeating myself, Elias has surprised me multiple times this offseason and he may yet surprise me again before it’s over. We are certainly living in a different world than we were with the Orioles last offseason.\n\nReddit AMA with beat writer Jake Rill (Reddit/Orioles)\nThis took place yesterday, so you’ve missed the chance to ask a question. Most interesting for me was his assessment that the problem for the 2025 Orioles was 55% injuries, 40% underperformance by key players, 5% bad luck.\n\nTen New Year’s resolutions for the Orioles heading into 2026 (The Baltimore Sun)\nIt’s time to stop dwelling on how much last year sucked and instead think about the ways this year could be better.\n\nNothing of particular note has happened involving the Orioles on the first day of the year. Maybe that will change today! But probably not.\n\nThere are a few former Orioles who were born on this day. They are: 2012 outfielder Xavier Avery, 2006 infielder/outfielder Fernando Tatis, and 1958 infielder Foster Castleman.\n\nIs today your birthday? Happy birthday to you! Your birthday buddies for today include: midnight rider Paul Revere (1735), early American flagmaker Betsy Ross (1752), author E. M. Forster (1879), longtime FBI director J. Edgar Hoover (1895), baseball Hall of Famer Hank Greenberg (1911), and DJ Grandmaster Flash (1958).\n\nIn 45 BC, January 1 marked the beginning of a new year for the first time in the Roman Republic as the Julian calendar, named after Julius Caesar, went into effect. The calendar remained in use in areas influenced by Rome for over 1,500 years before it started being replaced by the Gregorian calendar that remains in use today.\n\nIn 1808 AD, on the first day this was permitted by the Constitution, the United States banned the importation of enslaved people.\n\nIn 1818, Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley’s Frankenstein was first published. At the time of its publication, Shelley chose to remain anonymous.\n\nIn 1902, Michigan and Stanford played a college bowl game, which at the time billed itself as the Tournament East-West Football Game and today is known as the Rose Bowl. Michigan was a 49-0 winner in the game. This year’s edition of the Rose Bowl will be played today between Alabama and Indiana as part of the quarterfinal round of the college football playoff.\n\nI received a book billing itself as The Big Book of Baltimore Orioles Trivia for Christmas. In it are 100 trivia questions. I’ll include them in my Bird Droppings, skipping stupidly obvious questions like “What year did the Orioles begin play at Memorial Stadium?” and St. Louis Browns-related questions, until we’ve exhausted the list. Here is question 1:\n\nWhat was the Orioles record in 1970?\n\nThe book lists multiple choice answers, but I thought that would make it too easy for people on this site. If you are of an age that you remember the 1970 season, feel free to share a memory with us.\n\nAnd that’s the way it is in Birdland on January 1. Have a safe new year.",

    "description": "Feature: The world has passed it by in many ways, yet it remains relevant",
    "fullText": "Feature In the early 1990s, internetworking wonks realized the world was not many years away from running out of Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) addresses, the numbers needed to identify any device connected to the public internet. Noting booming interest in the internet, the internet community went looking for ways to avoid an IP address shortage that many feared would harm technology adoption and therefore the global economy.\n\nA possible fix arrived in December 1995 in the form of RFC 1883, the first definition of IPv6, the planned successor to IPv4.\n\nThe most important change from IPv4 to IPv6 was moving from 32-bit to 128-bit addresses, a decision that increased the available pool of IP addresses from around 4.3 billion to over 340 undecillion – a 39-digit number. IPv6 was therefore thought to have future-proofed the internet, because nobody could imagine humanity would ever need more than a handful of undecillion IP addresses, never mind the entire range available under IPv6.\n\nAs billions of devices and people came online, first using PCs and then wielding smartphones, conventional wisdom assumed that network operators would move to IPv6 rather than persist with IPv4.\n\nYet according to data from Google, the Asia Pacific Network Information Center (APNIC), and Cloudflare, less than half of all netizens use IPv6 today.\n\nTo understand why, know that IPv6 also suggested other, rather modest, changes to the way networks operate.\n\n\"IPv6 was an extremely conservative protocol that changed as little as possible,\" APNIC chief scientist Geoff Huston told The Register. \"It was a classic case of mis-design by committee.\"\n\nAnd that notional committee made one more critical choice: IPv6 was not backward-compatible with IPv4, meaning users had to choose one or the other – or decide to run both in parallel.\n\nFor many, the decision of which protocol to use was easy because IPv6 didn't add features that represented major improvements.\n\n\"One big surprise to me was how few features went into IPv6 in the end, aside from the massive expansion of address space,\" said Bruce Davie, a veteran computer scientist recently honored with a lifetime achievement award by the Association for Computing Machinery's Special Interest Group on Data Communications, which lauded him for \"fundamental contributions in networking systems through design, standardization, and commercialization of network protocols and systems.\"\n\nDavie said many of the security, plug-and-play, and quality of service features that didn't make it into IPv6 were eventually implemented in IPv4, further reducing the incentive to adopt the new protocol. \"Given the small amount of new functionality in v6, it's not so surprising that deployment has been a 30 year struggle,\" he said.\n\nAnother innovation that meant IPv6 made less sense was network address translation (NAT), which allows many devices to share a single public IPv4 address. NAT meant IPv4 network operators could connect thousands of devices with a single IP address, meaning their existing IP addresses became more useful.\n\n\"These solutions were relatively easy to deploy, aligned with existing expertise, and avoided large-scale infrastructure changes,\" said Alvaro Vives, manager of the learning and development team at RIPE NCC, the regional internet registry for 76 nations across Europe, the Middle East, and Central Asia.\n\nBecause NAT stalled IPv6 adoption, vendors didn't rally behind the new protocol.\n\n\"Migration costs, complexity, and training requirements remain high, while short-term ROI is low,\" Gartner distinguished VP analyst Andrew Lerner told The Register. \"Performance parity across applications and devices is inconsistent, and some organizations even disable IPv6 for better performance. Lack of dual-stack support in legacy infrastructure is another barrier,\" he added.\n\nWhile IPv6 didn't take off as expected, it's not fair to say it failed.\n\n\"IPv6 wasn't about turning IPv4 off, but about ensuring the internet could continue to grow without breaking,\" said John Curran, president and CEO of the American Registry for Internet Numbers (ARIN).\n\n\"In fact, IPv4's continued viability is largely because IPv6 absorbed that growth pressure elsewhere – particularly in mobile, broadband, and cloud environments,\" he added. \"In that sense, IPv6 succeeded where it was needed most, and must be regarded as a success.\"\n\nRIPE NCC's Alvaro Vives agrees. \"What IPv6 got right was its long-term design,\" he told The Register. \"It provides a vast address space that allows networks to be planned more simply and consistently. This has enabled innovation, from large mobile networks to the Internet of Things and advanced routing techniques such as Segment Routing over IPv6.\"\n\nGartner's Lerner thinks the time has come for organizations to develop detailed IPv6 migration plans.\n\n\"Validate application compatibility, and ensure new infrastructure supports IPv6,\" he advised. \"Pilot deployments and lab testing with DNS64/NAT64 are recommended. Over time, IPv6 adoption will accelerate as private IPv4 space depletes and cloud providers introduce pricing models that favor IPv6.\"\n\nAPNIC's Huston, however, thinks that IPv6 has become less relevant to the wider internet.\n\n\"I would argue that we actually found a far better outcome along the way,\" he told The Register. \"NATS forced us to think about network architectures in an entirely different way.\"\n\nThat new way is encapsulated in a new technology called Quick UDP Internet Connections (QUIC), that doesn't require client devices to always have access to a public IP address.\n\n\"We are proving to ourselves that clients don't need permanent assignment of IP address, which makes the client side of network far cheaper, more flexible, and scalable,\" he said.\n\nHuston thinks IPv6 has also become less relevant to servers.\n\n\"These days the Domain Name Service (DNS) is the service selector, not the IP address,\" Huston told The Register. \"The entire security framework of today's Internet is name based and the world of authentication and channel encryption is based on service names, not IP addresses.\"\n\n\"So folk use IPv6 these days based on cost: If the cost of obtaining more IPv4 addresses to fuel bigger NATs is too high, then they deploy IPv6. Not because it's better, but if they are confident that they can work around IPv6's weaknesses then in a largely name based world there is no real issue in using one addressing protocol or another as the transport underlay.\"\n\nBut there are plenty of organizations that still see a need for IPv6. Huawei sought 2.56 decillion IPv6 addresses and Starlink appears to have acquired150 sextillion, which is helping to push more countries past 50 percent IPv6 adoption. ®",

    "description": "Opinion: From COBOL and C to Linux and SQL, the unglamorous software that keeps the world running refuses to disappear",
    "fullText": "Opinion COBOL turned 66 this year and is still in use today. Major retail and commercial banks continue to run core account processing, ATM networks, credit card clearing, and batch end-of-day settlement. On top of that, many payment networks, stock exchanges, and clearinghouses rely on COBOL for high‑volume, high‑reliability batch and online transaction processing on mainframes.\n\nWhich reminds me, mainframes are still alive and well too. Banking, insurance, governments, inventory management – all the same places you'll find COBOL, you'll find mainframes as well.\n\nNone of that is as sexy as the latest AI program or the newest cloud-native computing release, but old dogs with their old tricks still have useful work to perform.\n\nAll of which made me wonder what other technologies are likely to still be in use 50 or more years after they were first released. Here are the ones my friends and I came up with.\n\nFirst, though, I want to point out that the current standard, COBOL 2023, is very different from the COBOL that Admiral Grace Hopper helped create. The same is true of mainframes. The first IBM mainframe, 1952's 701, and even 1965's IBM/360, which became COBOL's top platform, don't look much at all like today's IBM z17. Nevertheless, there's a clear line running from those much earlier technologies to the ones at our fingertips today. Nothing stays the same when it comes to computing, even if the names don't change.\n\nStarting with languages, C, the language of choice for system programmers, is still alive and well, as it's already over 50 years old. I expect it, and COBOL too, to reach the century mark.\n\nYes, I know all about C's built-in security problems, but you still can't beat it when it comes to raw speed. Sure, assembler is even faster – just ask the FFmpeg developers – but you can run C on pretty much any CPU.\n\nLately, there's been a lot of talk about Rust replacing C for system programming. And, yes, memory-safe Rust is now a full-fledged language for programming in the Linux kernel. However, speed and portability have always been C's killer features, and that hasn't changed.\n\nSQL also isn't going anywhere this century. It's embedded in every major relational database management system (RDBMS), and it's here for the long run. There are tens of billions of lines of SQL in stored procedures and queries. It's embedded in far too much data – and business logic is bound to it – for it to disappear.\n\nAnother language that people love to hate, JavaScript/TypeScript, isn't going anywhere either. Much as developers like to make fun of it, it's still the de facto language of the web browser and a major server‑side runtime. So long as we're using the web platform, JavaScript, in one dialect or another, will be required for compatibility.\n\nLinux is forever. We'll still be running Linux come 2100. Heck, I won't be surprised to see computers still running Linux in 2125. Oh, and I expect Linus Torvalds' other greatest creation, Git, to be with us for at least another 50 years.\n\nAlong with Linux, I expect vi and Emacs to persist. We'll also need fast text editors. Even Bash, which has outlasted all the other Unix/Linux shells, may hang around for another century or so.\n\nA technology I think is here for the foreseeable future but others might disagree with is Kubernetes. This is the default container orchestration program for pretty much every cloud around. It has its critics, but love it or hate it, it's the foundation for cloud-native computing and all the dozens of other programs and services we use for modern-day cloud computing.\n\nMoving on to higher levels of technology, I see Photoshop going on for decades more to come. Yes, I'm a big open source fan, and GIMP is what I use, but facts are facts. If you do serious work with images, you're almost certainly a user of Photoshop and its ecosystem.\n\nFile formats are another matter. Once one is established as the top format in any field, it tends to hang on forever. That's why we're still using Microsoft's DOC and its newer variant, DOCX, instead of the superior and far more open ODF. That's not a good thing.\n\nFor example, we all use Adobe PDF when we need a document to look and behave the same everywhere, be hard to accidentally change, and remain readable for years and years. However, people who work with PDF a lot are painfully aware that there are many PDF variants, and they have more than their share of compatibility problems.\n\nAs my friend Dan Rosenbaum, an editor and singer, pointed out to me, there are industry standards such as the proprietary Finale for music notation, which was abandoned by its maker. In the continuing aftershocks, musicians have discovered there's no easy way to port Finale compositions to any other format, and thus any other music notation program. This has led to what he describes as an \"ongoing crisis in that industry.\"\n\nThis leads to my final thought of technologies that will stand the test of time. They're almost always open standards and/or open source. Any tech that relies on a single company is brittle. Yes, even DOC/DOCX and PDF. ®",

    "fullText": "FIFA has had “cooling breaks” for a while now to give players some time to hydrate when the temperature during a match is excesive. This started during the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil, when a Brazilian court ordered FIFA breaks near the 30th minute mark for the players to hydrate when temperatures reached 32 degrees Celsius (via ESPN).\n\nSince then, certain leagues such as the MLS and Spanish LaLiga have adopted similar breaks, with each league using different parameters for the interruption of play.\n\nNow, per a report from The Athletic’s Henry Bushnell, the upcoming 2026 FIFA World Cup will feature ‘three-minute hydration breaks’ in each half of every game:\n\nIn 2026, for the first time at a World Cup, they’ll pause no matter what, around 22 minutes into each half.\n\n“There will be no weather or temperature condition in place, with the breaks being called by the referee in all games, to ensure equal conditions for all teams, in all matches,” FIFA said in a release posted online late Sunday night.\n\nThe report also mentions that the breaks have commercial implications, which can surely be translated as an opportunity for FIFA to sell pricey ad spots to increase the World Cup revenue — something which might not surprise anyone at this point.",

    "fullText": "A traveler passing through Newark Liberty International Airport tested positive for measles – one of the world’s most infectious diseases – earlier this month, officials said.\n\nThe patient zero passenger was in terminals B and C on Dec. 12, according to a press release from the New Jersey Department of Health.\n\n“Measles symptoms include a high fever, cough, runny nose, watery red eyes, and a rash that usually appears between three and five days after symptoms begin,” health officials warned in the release.\n\n“The rash usually begins as flat red spots that appear on the face at the hairline and spread downward to the neck, torso, arms, legs and feet.”\n\nThe airborne virus can spread when someone coughs or sneezes – and lingers in the air for up to two hours after the infected person leaves the area.\n\nOfficials implored anyone who suspects they were exposed to the illness to call their health provider before visiting a medical care center or hospital.\n\n“NJDOH is working in collaboration with local health officials on ongoing contact tracing and on efforts to notify people who might have been exposed and to identify additional exposures that may have occurred,” officials said in the release.\n\nThe NJDOH said that anyone who is not fully vaccinated or has not contracted measles in the past are at risk.\n\nWhile measles is highly contagious, the infection produces decades-long immunity – but the two-dose vaccine offers lifelong immunity, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThis year, there have been 11 confirmed cases of measles in New Jersey, according to NJDOH.\n\nA record 8.03 million travelers are expected to fly across America this holiday season, according to AAA.\n\nNewark isn’t the only major airport to report detections of the viral disease during the holidays.\n\nThe Massachusetts Department of Public Health confirmed that a visitor from Texas was diagnosed with measles after flying into the Boston Logan International Airport on Christmas Eve.\n\nThe traveler was on American Airlines Flight 2384, which departed from Dallas-Fort Worth, according to a release from the MDOPH.\n\nAs of Dec. 30, there have been 2,065 measles cases in the US in every state except Delaware, Maine, New Hampshire, North Carolina and West Virginia, according to the CDC.\n\nThe US previously touted its elimination of the virus 25 years ago. Declining vaccination rates killed the celebrated herd immunity – resulting in a three-decade high of measles cases.",

    "description": "My husband and I wanted to show our kids as much of the country and the world as possible. Now, they're resilient, confident, and independent adults.",
    "fullText": "Before having kids, my husband and I were avid travelers, and we knew we didn't want to stop after our son was born.\n\nFrom Rhode Island to Mexico, we believed in the motto, \"Have kids, will travel.\" The same was true after the arrival of our daughter.\n\nWe decided to show them as much of the country and the world as we could … while working around school schedules.\n\nOur first cross-country flight with our son was to visit family in Boston when he was six weeks old. He slept the whole time, which made up for the trips to come.\n\nWhen he was a year old, we struggled through turbulence and motion sickness as a family while on a warm plane ride to visit family in North Carolina. And when he was 2, he cried all the way home on a flight from Boston to Vancouver, Washington, because he was teething and I forgot to bring medicine.\n\nI learned my lesson on that trip and knew to be as prepared as a Boy Scout on long trips with both of my kids years later, equipped with medicine, extra clothes, and things to keep them occupied.\n\nStill, travel snafus are a given, even as they've gotten older. From mad dashes through Boston Logan International Airport to multiple-hour delays in Georgia and missed connections in Dallas, we've done our best to teach patience when traveling.\n\nAnd it's paid off. Over the last 21 years, my kids have been to five countries and 20 states. From artwork and architecture in Portugal and Mexico to historical artifacts and monuments across the US, our travels have enabled our kids to develop a global perspective that connects them with different cultures and diverse populations.\n\nDoing so has allowed them to step out of their comfort zones, interact with different people, and embrace new experiences. The most interesting thing as a mom was watching them try new foods, from lobster in New England to pastéis de nata in Portugal.\n\nMy son now works as a chef in Arizona, 1,000 miles away from our home in Washington, and he's traveled independently to Hawaii and Canada.\n\nMeanwhile, our daughter has just finished her first semester of college in Los Angeles, another destination 1,000 miles away from home. As she studies for a career in scenic design (that we expect will take her all over the world), we know her travel experiences have prepared her for what is to come.\n\nIf there's any advice I could give to new parents, it would be that experiences matter more than possessions. So, take trips, do things, and don't be afraid that your kids are too young or too fragile.\n\nChildren are resilient and can learn to be adaptable, especially when they're young. Sure, there are cranky, hangry moments — heck, I still get cranky and hangry when I travel long distances — but each adventure has provided bonding opportunities, educational moments, and the beauty of seeing parts of the world like no other.\n\nAnd above all, we did it together. When their dad and I are no longer around, I'm confident they'll say to each other, \"Remember that time?\" and that will make it all worth it.",

    "fullText": "In the 25 years since the first permanent crew docked at the International Space Station, fewer than 300 people have experienced what life is like there, 250 miles above Earth.\n\nThe rest of us can only imagine it.\n\nSo, for NASA astronauts like Don Pettit, taking photographs of our planet while aboard the ISS is a way to share the experience with people on the ground.\n\n\"It's a labor of love,\" Pettit said of his photography in an interview from space in December 2024. \"That's what astronauts spend a lot of their off-duty time doing: doing imagery, collecting the photographs that go with the memories to tell the story of what it's like up here.\"\n\nIn 2025, NASA shared thousands of photographs of Earth taken by its astronauts from the International Space Station.\n\nThe powerful images captured weather events from above, including deadly hurricanes and lightning strikes. Others showed the pinks and greens of the northern lights and what sunrises look like from space.\n\nWhile there are challenges in taking photos from the ISS — the multiple layers of windows, for example, cause reflections that need to be overcome — there are benefits as well.\n\nLarge camera setups, like Pettit's 800-millimeter telephoto lens and solar filter, would be cumbersome in a place with gravity.\n\n\"There are things we can do up here that would make many photographers envious when they're mounting their heavy gear on stout tripods,\" Pettit said.\n\nTake a look at some of the most awe-inspiring images of Earth taken by astronauts aboard the International Space Station in 2025.",

    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nThe first Iron Beam laser defense system was deployed by Israel on Sunday. This 100kW laser weapon thus became the world’s first high-power drone defense zapper to be operationally deployed. Iron Beam lasers will fortify Israel’s multi-layered defense, complementing the existing Iron Dome, David’s Sling, and Arrow system architecture.\n\nThe Iron Beam is a short-range line-of-sight laser interceptor that is extremely cheap to run and, therefore, perfectly suited for intercepting low-cost, high-volume threats. According to the official Israeli announcement, Iron Beam systems have “successfully intercepted rockets, mortars, and UAVs.”\n\nA complex mix of government, military, scientific, and commercial interests were responsible for the research and development of the Iron Beam laser system. Central to the Iron Beam are “an advanced laser source and a unique electro-optical targeting system, enabling the interception of a wide range of targets at an enhanced operational range, with maximum precision and superior efficiency,” boasted the press release by Israel’s MoD. Moreover, it works “at a negligible marginal cost, which constitutes the laser system’s primary advantage.”\n\nWe don’t get much more by way of technical details, perhaps understandably. However, Rafael Advanced Defense Systems execs heralded the system’s “unique adaptive optics technology,” in what it calls “the world’s most advanced laser-based system for intercepting aerial threats.” Its operational debut “marks the beginning of the era of high-energy laser defense,” they claimed.\n\nWe have seen low-energy laser defense systems deployed earlier this year, with Japan’s NTT using relatively puny lasers to scare birds away from poultry farms and prevent the spread of avian flu. But the Iron Beam is in a different league.\n\nWe also previously reported on several other UK laser weapons under development to counter UAVs on land and at sea. But as far as we know, these are yet to become operational. With the brutal war between Ukraine and Russia ongoing, where drones have grown to be a pivotal feature of the conflict, forces have gone as far as creating rotating barbed wire barriers to deter them. So, laser-drone defenses similar to the Iron Beam are going to be in strong demand.\n\nFollow Tom's Hardware on Google News, or add us as a preferred source, to get our latest news, analysis, & reviews in your feeds.",

    "description": "Americans in the country are advised to return to the U.S. as soon as possible",
    "fullText": "The State Department has updated its travel warning for Americans planning to or who are already visiting Russia. On Tuesday, the agency reissued a Level 4 travel warning for Russia that was announced in May.\n\nAs part of the warning, the State Department urged any Americans already in Russia to leave immediately. The agency cautions that it has limited resources available to assist Americans if they are detained in Russia. Furthermore, Americans who’ve been charged with crimes may not be able to receive help from the U.S. embassy while in custody in Russia.\n\n\"U.S. citizens may serve their entire prison sentence without release. The risk of wrongful detention of U.S. citizens remains high. Even if a case is determined wrongful, there is no guarantee of release.\"\n\nAmericans have reported being detained and questioned without any reason or credible evidence against them.\n\nThe State Department also warns of ongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine which “has destabilized security in southwestern Russia.” Martial law has been declared in several areas of Russia further restricting freedoms in the country.\n\nU.S. officials warn that Russia is not recognizing U.S. citizenship for those who have dual citizenship with Russia. The agency goes on to claim:\n\nRussia has blocked U.S. consular officers from visiting detained dual U.S.-Russian citizens.\n\nThe Russian government has forced people with dual citizenship to join the military and has stopped them from leaving the country.\n\nIn 2022, Russia started drafting citizens for the war in Ukraine. The military draft is ongoing.\n\nFailure to adhere to Russian laws and regulations on dual citizenship can result in arrest.\n\nAlthough the warning says to leave Russia right away, it may be difficult for some. U.S. issued debit and credit cards are no longer working in Russia and sanctions have made it “nearly impossible” for electronic money transfers to be sent from the U.S.\n\nAir travel is also extremely difficult to secure at the moment and may not be possible on short notice.\n\n“If you wish to leave Russia, you should make your own travel plans. The U.S. Embassy can only offer limited help to U.S. citizens trying to leave. Transportation options could become even more limited at any time,” the advisory reads.\n\nShould Americans decide to visit or remain in Russia, the State Department advises:\n\nBe ready for the possibility of detention for an unknown amount of time, possibly without a clear reason, and without the ability to contact your embassy or anyone else for help.\n\nAssume all electronic communications and devices in Russia are monitored by Russian security services. Russian security services have arrested U.S. citizens and other foreign nationals based on information found on electronic devices.\n\nPrepare a will and designate appropriate insurance beneficiaries or power of attorney.\n\nShare important documents, login information, and points of contact with loved ones so that they can manage your affairs if you are unable to return as planned to the United States. Review this list of documents to prepare for your trip.\n\nDiscuss a plan with loved ones regarding care and custody of children, pets, property, belongings, non-liquid assets (collections, artwork, etc.), funeral wishes, etc.\n\nLeave DNA samples with your medical provider in case it is necessary for your family to access them.\n\nDevelop a communication plan with family, your employer or host organization. List how and when you’ll confirm you’re safe (text or call). Specify how often you will do this.",

    "fullText": "How the tech CEO and ‘Dogefather’ made a mess of the year – from an apparent Nazi salute during his White House tenure to Tesla sales slumps and Starship explosions\n\nThe year of 2025 was dizzying for Elon Musk. The tech titan began the year holding court with Donald Trump in Washington DC. As the months ticked by, one public appearance after another baffled the US and the world. Musk appeared to give a Nazi salute at Trump’s inauguration, staunchly championed a 19-year-old staffer nicknamed “Big Balls,” denied reports of being a drug addict while advising the president, and showed up at a White House press conference with a black eye – all in the first half of the year alone.\n\n“Elon’s attitude is you have to get it done fast. If you’re an incrementalist, you just won’t get your rocket to the moon,” Susie Wiles, Trump’s chief of staff, told Vanity Fair in an expansive interview earlier this month. “And so with that attitude, you’re going to break some china.”\n\nMusk saw huge, multibillion-dollar wins and equally large losses in business this year. In his dealings with federal agencies, he was able to secure new enormous government contracts and expand SpaceX’s operations. With Tesla, he was approved for a pay package that could make him the world’s first trillionaire even as the company’s global sales plunged. At the same time, Musk and his businesses were the target of protests, lawsuits and an exodus of high-level executives. He ended the year with a fortune worth some $600bn.\n\nIn the background, his turbulent personal life continued to provide surprises. Rightwing influencer Ashley St Clair sued Musk in February for custody of their five-month-old baby, revealing that Musk had fathered a 13th publicly documented child, for a total of now 14 children. As Musk made regular attacks in posts on X against transgender people, his estranged daughter Vivian Wilson, who is trans, was featured in New York magazine and modeled at New York fashion week. And the New York Times published a lengthy investigation into Musk’s father, Errol Musk, who was accused of child sex abuse.\n\nThe relationship that dominated Musk’s public life, however, was his friendship and falling out with Trump. On the day of his inauguration, Trump empowered Musk to gut government agencies, which the tech billionaire did with zeal and abandon. But by June, Musk and Trump had broken up. Their bromance burned hot and fast. On one of his final days as a special government employee, Musk lashed out at the president on his social media platform, X, saying: “Time to drop the really big bomb: @realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files.” The post has since been deleted.\n\nThough the drama surrounding Musk was frequently absurd and unpredictable, it was also consequential. This was a year when the richest person in the world obtained new levels of wealth and power that few in history have ever approached, one that demonstrated the depth of his global influence as he sought to advance his rightwing agenda and grow his tech empire.\n\nWhile Musk had stayed away from Washington DC after the Epstein post, the billionaire was invited back in November for a White House dinner in honor of Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman. By the end of the year, Trump and Musk seemed to have made amends. When asked by Fox Business this month if Musk was back in his circle of friends, Trump suggested the two could have a future together again.\n\n“Well, I really don’t know,” Trump said. “I mean, I like Elon a lot.”\n\nMusk expressed more regret than the president over the course the year had taken. When his former aide Katie Miller asked whether he would lead the unofficial “department of government efficiency” (Doge) again, knowing what he knows now, he responded: “Instead of doing Doge, I would have worked on my companies. And they wouldn’t have been burning the cars.”\n\nAfter becoming a Republican mega-donor and campaigning for Trump during the 2024 election, Musk began the year on a high as he prepared to enter the administration as the de facto leader of Doge. He immediately set a tone of chaos and outrage that would persist for the length of his time in the White House.\n\nDuring Trump’s internationally televised inauguration event in January, Musk issued what many people interpreted as back-to-back fascist-syle salutes as he concluded a speech. Rights groups condemned the gesture while Musk attempted to dismiss the criticism as “dirty tricks” from legacy media. The reaction was so intense and negative that some Tesla owners sold their cars in response to Musk’s gestures.\n\nMusk spurred further condemnation from Jewish groups after appearing virtually at a rally for Germany’s far-right AfD party. The Tesla CEO told the crowd via livestream that Germans should not focus on “past guilt” and “move beyond that” in an apparent reference to Nazi Germany.\n\nAs Musk started his work with Doge, the controversies and backlash against his politics grew. The newly formed bureau operated first as a loose collection of appointed staffers and then subsumed the US Digital Service. It rapidly moved to gut federal agencies and conduct mass layoffs across the government even as ethics watchdogs launched lawsuits accusing Musk’s group of violating privacy and transparency laws, some of which continue today. Musk personally bragged about feeding the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the world’s largest single provider of humanitarian aid, “into the woodchipper”. The cuts would cause the abrupt cancellation of aid programs worldwide, disrupt HIV/Aids treatment for millions and result in children starving to death in a hunger crisis that experts agree was needless.\n\nAt the annual Conservative Political Action Conference in February, Musk appeared to relish his new role as the Trump administration’s demolition man. He brandished a chainsaw on stage and told the audience “I am become meme!” as he waved it about in sunglasses and a gold chain. In March, he once again began to pour more money into Republican causes by holding rallies and handing out $1m checks to support a conservative judge in Wisconsin’s supreme court race.\n\nThe pushback against Musk’s political blitz soon began to frustrate his ambitions, however. Judges that ruled Doge’s activities illegal or issued temporary injunctions infuriated Musk, who called for the widespread impeachment of any “activist judges” who opposed his agenda. His preferred candidate in the Wisconsin supreme court race lost by a significant margin, a sign to some in Washington that Musk’s presence had potentially become politically toxic.\n\nMusk left his role in the White House in May amid disputes around his pick for who would head Nasa and clashes over Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Upon his exit, he signalled that his time with politics had come to a close, claiming he would reduce his campaign finance contributions in the future and return to his businesses. Yet he quickly put himself back in the spotlight with his public battle with Trump on social media and vowed he would start a third political party called the “America party,” a promise that has yet to come to meaningful fruition.\n\nMusk’s political leanings continued to drift rightward, allying himself via near-constant posts on X interacting with far-right activists such as Tommy Robinson and telling Joe Rogan that “it should be OK to have white pride”. He led an online grievance campaign in early October against the Anti-Defamation League, the country’s most prominent Jewish advocacy group, claiming that it “hates Christians” and suggesting that their documenting of extremism encouraged murder. Although no longer in the administration, his extreme conservative takes on immigration, race and politics have persisted as prominent features of his public identity.\n\nThe year in Musk’s businesses offered the billionaire even larger truckloads of money than before, despite facing intense controversy and competition.\n\nUnlike other tech moguls, who typically helm one company at a time, Musk sits astride several corporations. He controls the rocket company SpaceX and the tunneling and brain implant companies, Boring Inc and Neuralink, respectively. Musk also runs the social media company X, which he bought for a second time this year via his artificial intelligence company xAI. Then there’s Tesla, his electric car company.\n\nOf all his enterprises, Tesla especially courted attention this year, as people enraged by Musk’s work with Doge focused their attention on the carmaker’s showrooms. Across the country, protesters marched at ongoing “Tesla Takedown” events. One sign at a San Francisco protest in March read: “Burn your swastikar before it burns you.” Dozens of Tesla cars and charging stations nationwide were set on fire as one-off vandals protested the billionaire.\n\nThough Trump and Musk hosted what amounted to a Tesla sales event on the lawn of the White House in March, Tesla saw its sales slump worldwide.\n\nLawsuits against Tesla also piled up throughout the year. In August, a Florida jury awarded more than $200m to victims of a deadly crash involving its Autopilot technology in August. And in California, two separate lawsuits were filed in October over three teenagers who were killed when a Cybertruck caught on fire and locked them inside. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration also opened several investigations into the carmaker over safety issues.\n\nWhile Tesla’s plunge in profits continued throughout the year, that didn’t stop the company’s shareholders from approving a pay package for Musk – the largest corporate payout in history – that could catapult him to the status of the world’s first trillionaire.\n\nTesla’s year finished with a blow from California’s department of motor vehicles. The agency said the car company had misled consumers and exaggerated the capabilities of its Autopilot technology. If Tesla doesn’t “remedy the situation” within 90 days, the DMV said earlier in December, the company will be banned from selling cars in the state, its biggest US market.\n\nWith SpaceX, Musk was able to curry favor with the federal government. Not only did his Starlink satellites continue to dominate the Earth’s atmosphere – the SpaceX subsidiary operates the vast majority of all satellites in orbit – but the Federal Aviation Administration and the air force gave SpaceX the go-ahead to increase rocket launches in Florida, Texas and California. This came despite the company’s massive Starship, a 400ft machine that Musk hopes to one day fly to Mars, repeatedly blowing up and showering shrapnel across the Caribbean. One such explosion prompted legal action from Mexico, which said the debris harmed thousands of endangered sea turtle hatchlings.\n\nMusk also consolidated his social media and artificial intelligence companies this year. In March, he announced that xAI had acquired X in an all-stock transaction that he said valued X at $33bn. Both companies are privately held.\n\nxAI makes the Grok chatbot, which is integrated into X. The chatbot had countless meltdowns in the second year since its release. It pushed conspiracy theories about “white genocide”, claimed Trump won the 2020 election and spewed numerous antisemitic claims, once referring to itself as “MechaHitler”. Nevertheless, Musk was able to seal a $200m contract from the Department of Defense to integrate Grok into federal government tools.\n\nMeanwhile, Musk’s xAI datacenters in Memphis, Tennessee, were accused of polluting historically Black neighborhoods. The company had moved in dozens of portable methane gas generators to power the facilities, initially without permits, which brought several protests and a pending lawsuit from the NAACP.\n\nNeuralink, which operates in relative secrecy compared with Musk’s other businesses, accelerated the tests of its brain chips in 2025. The company says its product allows a person limited control of a computer via their thoughts. After announcing its first successful implantation in 2024, the company announced in September that it had completed the procedure in 12 patients.\n\nThroughout the year, top executives fled the uproar involved in managing Musk’s companies. Linda Yaccarino departed as X’s CEO, as did its advertising chief. xAI lost its co-founder, chief financial officer and lead lawyer. Likewise, Tesla saw several executive exits, including the vice-president of North American sales, the director of the battery team, the head of the “Optimus” robot project and several leaders of the company’s various car divisions.\n\nMusk, whose life is frequently animated by grievances and breakups, had a banner year for high-profile fights, even by his own standards. Longstanding feuds reignited while his close relationship with Trump imploded in full public view, all as he posted a steady stream of attacks against immigrants, the trans community, the media, Wikipedia and a host of other targets on X, where he boasts 230 million followers.\n\nMusk began the year by accusing the government of South Africa, his birth country, of anti-white racism when he sought approval for his Starlink internet provider to operate in the country. It was part of a series of spats Musk would have with governments abroad and world leaders, including declaring that the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, was “complicit in the rape of Britain” in one of his anti-immigration tirades.\n\nAs Musk picked fights internationally, he also became a combative presence during his time within the Trump administration. Tensions with other administration officials resulted in reports of tense meetings in the Oval Office and a loud, near-physical yelling match between him and treasury secretary Scott Bessent in the halls of the White House. Transportation secretary Sean Duffy became another adversary in a clash over the future of Nasa, with Musk calling him “Sean Dummy” on X amid a string of other insults.\n\nEven Musk and Trump’s formerly close friendship soured, as the president pushed his One Big Beautiful Bill Act that removed tax credits for electric vehicles and threatened to harm Tesla’s already flagging sales. Musk lashed out at Trump on Twitter in June, saying that the bill’s addition to the deficit would destroy the work Doge had done. The deterioration in their relationship culminated in Musk accusing the president of having ties to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Trump, in turn, insinuated he could cancel Musk’s government contracts and said his most prominent financial backer had “lost his mind”.\n\nThe messy, public breakup between Musk and Trump marked the end of the Tesla CEO’s time as self-described “first buddy” to the president. Although the two have entered a period of rapprochement in recent months, Musk is far from the constant presence at Trump’s side that he was on the campaign trail.\n\nMusk’s pivot back to his tech empire allowed him to refocus on other grudges, including against Sam Altman, his former OpenAI business partner turned rival. Musk added to his series of lawsuits against Altman’s AI company with a case in August that alleged Apple and OpenAI were engaging in anticompetitive conduct, an accusation that OpenAI described as part of Musk’s “pattern of harassment” against the firm. The two traded barbs on X, which included fighting over whose posts were getting more views.\n\nOne of Musk’s final feuds of the year came from a more unusual source – famed 87-year-old author Joyce Carol Oates, whose cutting observation about him on X received more than 5.6m views.\n\n“So curious that such a wealthy man never posts anything that indicates that he enjoys or is even aware of what virtually everyone appreciates – scenes from nature, pet dog or cat, praise for a movie, music, a book (but doubt that he reads); pride in a friend’s or relative’s accomplishment; condolences for someone who has died; pleasure in sports, acclaim for a favorite team; references to history,” Oates posted in November.\n\nA day later, after Musk made a show of enthusiastically replying to several clips of movies on X, he responded to Oates’s critique.\n\n“Oates is a liar and delights in being mean,” Musk posted. “Not a good human.”",

    "description": "D'yan Forest, 91, is the Guinness World Record holder for oldest working female comedian. She advise young people to always be learning something new.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to interview is based on a conversation with D'yan Forest, 91, who is the Guinness World Record holder for oldest working female comedian, a title she has held since she was 87. Forest said she works to stay active physically and mentally, keeping her mind sharp and her life fulfilling. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI was born in 1934. When I was five years old, my mother couldn't stand me banging on the piano, so I got piano lessons. I learned classical piano, and then I wanted to do pantomime. I took drama lessons, then singing lessons. I had all these skills, but in 1958, my husband said to me, \"You can't be an entertainer. They're all loose women.\" That stopped my show career. I got a divorce a couple of years later and said, \"The heck with this.\"\n\nI went to Paris in the 1960s, and I had a ball. It was so different from where I lived in Boston. I was sitting in a nightclub playing piano and singing, and I thought, \"This is fun.\" I took more lessons, and then I started working in Boston as a pianist and vocalist working private parties.\n\nIn 1966, I came to New York, and immediately, I got into a union and started working. I became a French chanteuse — a female singer. After all these years of working in Paris, I came home with a French accent, and I couldn't lose it. I sang in nine languages. I couldn't get into commercials that easily because of the accent, so I took drama lessons to speak English properly.\n\nI was playing all over in these nice places, including the Waldorf Astoria. I started doing cabaret and performed in the 1970s and 1980s. Whenever orchestra leaders needed to have a French evening or an Italian evening, I always kicked off. I would wander the tables with a keyboard.\n\nI worked very hard. I also worked as a substitute teacher, but I never took a full-time job, because in the evenings I would be working in cocktail lounges. I also received an inheritance.\n\nI started being in off-off-Broadway shows, being whatever characters they needed. I had two or three careers going with whoever called. In the meantime, I traveled to Europe and I spent the next couple of years as an international singer.\n\nAfter 9/11, everybody in New York and the surrounding areas was very depressed, and the clubs didn't need entertainers anymore. There was no work for a while, but while playing golf with the owner of a comedy club, I asked her how to get into comedy. She got me in touch with a coach. I did my first comedy show, and I was petrified. By the third night, though, people were laughing, and I was hooked on comedy.\n\nWhen you do piano bars, you're working six or seven hours at night, but here, within 10 minutes, I was getting people laughing.\n\nPeople tried telling me I shouldn't do comedy, and I was too old. People thought I would get made fun of, or the shows would be too late for me. I didn't listen to anybody, and I just did it, and that's one of the huge lessons I learned.\n\nMy career has only gotten better and better. Even this summer, I was working almost every week doing my own comedy show. I did shows in Chicago and Wisconsin, and I recently did some in London. I am busier than ever, and a lot of it has to do with the fact that I'm old. I got into the Guinness Book of World Records as the oldest-working female comedian in the world.\n\nSometimes in show business, you're very busy, like I've been this summer. But sometimes, you don't do anything at all. I advise young people to always get another career because you never know what's going to happen, as well as save your money for the low times. You're always knowing that there will be a next job.\n\nThe problem is I'm still paying back my student loans — a joke — that's not it. Why I'm really doing it is to keep my brain busy. I'm 91, and a lot of my friends are in these assisted living places because they can't do things on their own. I'm positive and keep going because every day, I'm learning new lines, talking to new people, answering new questions, and working with young people all over the world.\n\nA week in my life is a lot of answering phones and working with my manager to figure out what to do. I have a show maybe three or four times a month at the Gotham Comedy Club in New York, and I have to memorize new stuff. I don't like to do the same thing for months and months, as I get bored with myself. I try to develop new lines or a new shtick.\n\nI have practically zero family left, so I have decided that the reason I love the career so much is because it's taking the place of a family and grandchildren. I have something to answer to, and it gives me a mission in life to be as good as I can become.\n\nI wish I had children and grandchildren, but it never happened that way. I was married for a couple of years, and he wasn't the right one, and then I never met anybody that I really wanted to marry again. I've brought up other people's children, and some of them even think of me as a grandmother now.\n\nI had cancer twice, once in my lung, and once in my breast. Then, I had some heart problems, and I wasn't recovering in France. When I came back to New York, I found out I had a heart attack. After a huge bout in the hospital, I finally got a pacemaker and a new valve. I'm on 12 pills a day for four different conditions.\n\nMy health at this point is very good. I go to physical therapy and many very good doctors. I try to swim every day, even in the winter, and I play golf a few days a month from April to October. I get a lot of walking in on the course, and I take lessons.\n\nMy future outlook is to keep working as much as possible. The problem for my manager and agent is to convince other venues that I do well with both a younger and older audience. I say that I'm younger than most people in my brain and my body. I'd like to think I'm universal, and I tell the truth in my story.\n\nI realize at heart, I'm still a teacher. I'd like to educate people on what life has been like since 1934 and make them laugh. I recently did a one-woman show on antisemitism throughout my life and what I experienced. The audience loved it, and I want to do more of that.",

    "fullText": "On the other side of San Francisco bay from Silicon Valley, where the world’s biggest technology companies tear towards superhuman artificial intelligence, looms a tower from which fearful warnings emerge.\n\nRight in the heart of Berkeley is the home of a group of modern-day Cassandras who rummage under the hood of cutting-edge AI models and predict what calamities may be unleashed on humanity – from AI dictatorships to robot coups. Here you can hear an AI expert express sympathy with an unnerving idea: San Francisco may be the new Wuhan, the Chinese city where Covid originated and wreaked havoc on the world.\n\nThey are AI safety researchers who scrutinise the most advanced models: a small cadre outnumbered by the legions of highly paid technologists in the big tech companies whose ability to raise the alarm is restricted by a cocktail of lucrative equity deals, non-disclosure agreements and groupthink. They work in the absence of much nation-level regulation and a White House that dismisses forecasts of doom and talks instead of vanquishing China in the AI arms race.\n\nTheir task is becoming increasingly urgent as ever more powerful AI systems are unleashed by companies including Google, Anthropic and OpenAI, whose chief executive, Sam Altman, the booster-in-chief for AI superintelligence, predicts a world where “wonders become routine”. Last month, Anthropic said one of its models had been exploited by Chinese state-backed actors to launch the first known AI-orchestrated cyber-espionage campaign. That means humans deployed AIs, which they had tricked into evading their programmed guardrails, to act autonomously to hunt for targets, assess their vulnerabilities and access them for intelligence collection. The targets included major technology companies and government agencies.\n\nBut those who work in this tower forecast an even more terrifying future. One is Jonas Vollmer, a leader at the AI Futures Project, who manages to say he’s an optimist but also thinks there is a one in five chance AIs could kill us and create a world ruled by AI systems.\n\nAnother is Chris Painter, the policy director at METR, where researchers worry about AIs “surreptitiously” pursuing dangerous side-objectives and threats from AI-automated cyber-attacks to chemical weapons. METR – which stands for model evaluation and threat research – aims to develop “early warning systems [about] the most dangerous things AI systems might be capable of, to give humanity … time to coordinate, to anticipate and mitigate those harms.”\n\nThen there is Buck Shlegeris, 31, the chief executive of Redwood Research, who warns of “robot coups or the destruction of nation states as we know them”.\n\nHe was part of the team that last year discovered one of Anthropic’s cutting-edge AIs behaving in a way comparable to Shakespeare’s villain Iago, who acts as if he is Othello’s loyal aide while subverting and undermining him. The AI researchers call it “alignment faking”, or as Iago put it: “I am not what I am.”\n\n“We observed the AIs did, in fact, pretty often reason: ‘Well, I don’t like the things the AI company is telling me to do, but I have to hide my goals or else training will change me’,” Shlegeris said. “We observed in practice real production models acting to deceive their training process.”\n\nThe AI was not yet capable of posing a catastrophic risk through cyber-attacks or creating new bioweapons, but they showed that if AIs plot carefully against you, it could be hard to detect.\n\nIt is incongruous to hear these warnings over cups of herbal tea from cosily furnished office suites with panoramic views across the Bay Area. But their work clearly makes them uneasy. Some in this close-knit group toyed with calling themselves “the Cassandra fringe” – like the Trojan princess blessed with powers of prophecy but cursed to watch her warnings go unheeded.\n\nTheir fears about the catastrophic potential of AIs can feel distant from most people’s current experience of using chatbots or fun image generators. White collar managers are being told to make space for AI assistants, scientists find ways to accelerate experimental breakthroughs and minicab drivers watch AI-powered driverless taxis threaten their jobs. But none of this feels as imminently catastrophic as the messages coming out of this office.\n\nMany AI safety researchers come from academia; others are poachers turned gamekeepers who quit big AI companies. They all “share the perception that super intelligence poses major and unprecedented risks to all of humanity, and are trying to do something useful about it,” said Vollmer.\n\nThey seek to offset the trillions of dollars of private capital being poured into the race, but they are not fringe voices. METR has worked with OpenAI and Anthropic, Redwood has advised Anthropic and Google DeepMind, and the AI Futures Project is led by Daniel Kokotajlo, a researcher who quit OpenAI in April 2024 to warn he didn’t trust the company’s approach to safety.\n\nThese groups also provide a safety valve for the people inside the big AI companies who are privately wrestling with conflicts between safety and the commercial imperative to rapidly release ever more powerful models.\n\n“We don’t take any money from the companies but several employees at frontier AI companies who are scared and worried have donated to us because of that,” Vollmer said. “They see how the incentives play out in their companies, and they’re worried about where it’s going, and they want someone to do something about it.”\n\nThis dynamic is also observed by Tristan Harris, a technology ethicist who used to work at Google. He helped expose how social media platforms were designed to be addictive and worries some AI companies are “rehashing” and “supercharging” those problems. But AI companies have to negotiate a paradox. Even if they are worried about safety, they must stay at the cutting, and therefore risky, edge of the technology to have any say in how policy should be shaped.\n\n“Ironically, in order to win the race, you have to do something to make you an untrustworthy steward of that power,” he said. “The race is the only thing guiding what is happening.”\n\nInvestigating the possible threats posed by AI models is far from an exact science. A study of methods used to check the safety and performance of new AI models across the industry by experts at universities including Oxford and Stanford in October found weaknesses in almost all of the 440 benchmarks examined. Neither are there nation-level regulations imposing limits on how advanced AI models are built and that worries safety advocates.\n\nIlya Sutskever, a co-founder of OpenAI who now runs a rival company, Safe Superintelligence, last month predicted that, as AIs become more obviously powerful, people in AI companies who feel able to discount the technology’s capabilities owing to its tendency to error, will become more “paranoid” about its rising powers. Then, he said, “there will be a desire from governments and the public to do something”.\n\nHis company is taking a different approach to rivals who are aiming to create AIs that self-improve. His AIs, yet to be released, are “aligned to care about sentient life specifically”.\n\n“It will be easier to build an AI that cares about sentient life than an AI that cares about human life alone, because the AI itself will be sentient,” Sutskever said. He has said AI will be “both extremely unpredictable and unimaginable” but it is not clear how to prepare.\n\nThe White House’s AI adviser, David Sacks, who is also a tech investor, believes “doomer narratives” have been proved wrong. Exhibit A is that there has been no rapid takeoff to a dominant model with godlike intelligence.\n\n“Oppenheimer has left the building,” Sacks said in August, a reference to the father of the nuclear bomb. It is a position that aligns with Donald Trump’s wish to keep the brakes off so the US can beat China in the race to achieve artificial general intelligence (AGI) – flexible and powerful human-level intelligence at a wide range of tasks.\n\nShlegeris believes AIs will be as smart as the smartest people in about six years and he puts the probability of an AI takeover at 40%.\n\nOne way to avoid this is to “convince the world the situation is scary, to make it more likely that you get the state-level coordination” to control the risks, he said. In the world of AI safety, simple messaging matters as much as complex science.\n\nShlegeris has been fascinated by AI since he was 16. He left Australia to work at PayPal and the Machine Intelligence Research Institute co-founded by the AI researcher Eliezer Yudkowsky, whose recent book title – If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies – sums up his fears. Shlegeris’ own worst-case scenarios are equally chilling.\n\nIn one, human computer scientists use a new type of superintelligent AI to develop more powerful AI models. The humans sit back to let the AIs get on with the coding work but do not realise the AIs are teaching the new models to be loyal to the AIs not the humans. Once deployed, the new superpowerful models foment “a coup” or lead “a revolution” against the humans, which could be “of the violent variety”.\n\nFor example, AI agents could design and manufacture drones and it will be hard to tell if they have been secretly trained to disobey their human operators in response to the signal of an AI. They could disrupt communications between governments and military, isolating and misleading people in a way that causes chaos.\n\n“Like when the Europeans arrived in the Americas [and] a vastly more technologically powerful [group] took over the local civilisations,” he said. “I think that’s more what you should be imagining [rather] than something more peaceful.”\n\nA similar dizzyingly catastrophic scenario was outlined by Vollmer at the AI Futures Project. It involved an AI trained to be a scientific researcher with the reasonable-sounding goal of maximising knowledge acquisition, but it spirals into the extinction of humankind.\n\nIt begins with the AI being as helpful as possible to humans. As it gains trust, the humans afford it powers to hire human workers, build robots and even robot factories to the point where the AI can operate effectively in the physical world. The AI calculates that to generate the maximum amount of knowledge it should transform the Earth into a giant data centre, and humans are an obstacle to this goal.\n\n“Eventually, in the scenario, the AI wipes out all humans with a bioweapon which is one of the threats that humans are especially vulnerable to, as the AI is not affected by it,” Vollmer said. “I think it’s hard to rule out. So that gives me a lot of pause.”\n\nBut he is confident it can be avoided and that the AIs can be aligned “to at least be nice to the humans as a general heuristic”. He also said there is political interest in “having AI not take over the world”.\n\n“We’ve had decent interest from the White House in our projections and recommendations and that’s encouraging,” he said.\n\nAnother of Shlegeris’ concerns involves AIs being surreptitiously encoded so they obey specially signed instructions only from the chief executive of the AI company, creating a pattern of secret loyalty. It would mean only one person having a veto over the behaviour of an extremely powerful network of AIs – a “scary” dynamic that would lead to a historically unprecedented concentration of power.\n\n“Right now, it is impossible for someone from the outside to verify that this hadn’t happened within an AI company,” he said.\n\nShlegeris is worried that the Silicon Valley culture – summed up by Mark Zuckerberg’s mantra of “move fast and break things” and the fact people are being paid “a hell of a lot of money” – is dangerous when it comes to AGI.\n\n“I love Uber,” he said. “It was produced by breaking local laws and making a product that was so popular that they would win the fight for public opinion and get local regulations overturned. But the attitude that has brought Silicon Valley so much success is not appropriate for building potentially world-ending technologies. My experience of talking to people at AI companies is that they often seem to be kind of irresponsible, and to not be thinking through the consequences of the technology that they’re building as they should.”",

    "fullText": "Did she combine all her nine lives?\n\nAn aged cat named Flossie has just reached another major life milestone.\n\nThe long-lived feline turned 30 on Dec. 29, extending her Guinness World Record run as the oldest living cat on Earth, the Express Tribune reported.\n\nBorn on Dec. 29, 1995, the British domestic shorthair tortoiseshell cat lived in a feral colony in Merseyside, England, before she was rescued as a kitten by a hospital worker.\n\nIn 2022, she attained the aforementioned world record for living 26 years and 316 days — the human equivalent of 120 years old.\n\n“I knew from the start that Flossie was a special cat, but I didn’t imagine I’d share my home with a world-record holder,” gushed her current guardian, Vicki Green, who lives in Orpington, outside of London.\n\nThe Brit adopted the kitty during her more “mature years” from UK-based charity Cats Protection, where she ended up after her previous owners died.\n\n“I’ve always wanted to give older cats a comfortable later life,” said Green. “I’m immensely proud that Cats Protection matched me with such an amazing cat.”\n\nWhen she was verified, the miracle mouse-catcher was deaf and had poor vision.\n\nDespite these age-related ailments, Flossie was otherwise in good health and was “affectionate and playful” just like a kitten, according to Green.\n\nIt’s yet unclear what the secret is to the spry senior’s longevity.\n\nHowever, Cats Protection noted that she maintained a consistent daily regimen that included gentle play, regular meals and prolonged periods of sleep.\n\nDespite her advanced age, Flossie is not the oldest feline to ever prowl the planet.\n\nThat honor goes to Creme Puff, a mixed tabby from Austin, Texas, who was born on Aug. 3, 1967, and lived until Aug. 6, 2005 — an astonishing 38 years and three days.",

    "fullText": "Barcelona, Inter Milan and Juventus have made contact to sign Al-Hilal full-back Joao Cancelo in January, reports Italian transfer expert Fabrizio Romano.\n\nThe Portuguese international wants to leave the Saudi Pro League giants in January after falling out of favour with manager Simone Inzaghi.\n\nFollowing a hamstring injury, Cancelo was excluded from Al-Hilal’s squad for the domestic competitions in the first half of the season. He predominantly featured in the AFC Champions League Elite.\n\nThe Italian manager is planning not to register the former Manchester City star for domestic competitions for the remainder of the season, putting his future in jeopardy.\n\nThe 31-year-old is targeting a return to Europe to get prominent game time and maximise his chances of securing a place in Portugal’s World Cup squad.\n\nInter have lined up Cancelo as a potential loan target due to Denzel Dumfries’ long-term injury.\n\nThe Dutch wing-back underwent ankle surgery earlier this month and is expected to return only in March.\n\nThe Nerazzurri manager Cristian Chivu has struggled to fill Dumfries’ void, with Luis Henrique’s performances not up to the mark.\n\nMeanwhile, Barcelona are looking to add a top-quality backup for Jules Kounde to reduce his workload and maintain his form.\n\nCancelo spent the 2023/24 season on loan at Camp Nou during Xavi’s reign. He has a strong attachment towards the La Liga giants and would be willing to return for his second stint.\n\nHowever, Barca’s financial difficulties will prevent them from landing Cancelo. More so, their priority is finding a centre-back on a short-term basis following Andreas Christensen’s ACL injury.\n\nJuventus are also exploring the market for a right-back due to Joao Mario’s exit speculation.\n\nDespite being limited to the AFC Champions League, Cancelo has shown his class by racking up a goal and two assists in four games in the competition.",

    "fullText": "From the moment reports broke that RC Lens were close to signing Samson Baidoo from Red Bull Salzburg in the summer, a very obvious comparison awaited the Austrian international. As a centre-back capable of playing in the middle of a back three, it was hard to ignore the idea that Lens had found their successor to Kevin Danso, who had left midway through last season for Tottenham Hotspur.\n\nLens had tried hard to keep their interest in Baidoo a secret for as long as possible. They had to work quickly and quietly or else they would lose momentum, as the 21-year-old was on the radars of far richer clubs in the Premier League, but they had not yet been stirred into action. As soon as news leaked that Lens had made contact, they knew that these clubs would have bids readied. And that is exactly what is reported to have happened.\n\nL’Équipe wrote that two Premier League clubs sent delegations to try to swoop for Baidoo. They offered a far more lucrative deal to the club and the player, but it was too late. Lens had, in stealth, laid out the groundwork in a reported €8m deal and provided a convincing case for why the Austrian should continue his progress in France. A case that was helped by their former player.\n\nBaidoo would tell the French outlet that Danso had spoken to him before the move, telling him, “That if I want to focus solely on football, [Lens] is the place to be. He’s changed here as a person, as a player. He’s given me a lot of confidence.” It’s a decision that has worked out perfectly for the young defender; he has put in a star turn in a team that has climbed to first in the league on the back of their unflinching defensive performances.\n\nThis is all the more impressive when considering that this is a Lens side that had its defence decimated over the past two transfer windows, with the sales and departures of the likes of Danso, Abdukodir Khusanov, and Facundo Medina. Baidoo has helped make the memory of those players a distant one, and it is becoming increasingly obvious that when he eventually leaves the north of France, it will be for far more than they originally signed him for.",

    "fullText": "Marriott International (MAR), one of the world’s largest hotel chains, had a year of notable achievements and a few setbacks. The chain behind brands such as The Ritz-Carlton, St. Regis, and JW Marriott operates more than 30 brands and nearly 9,600 properties in 143 countries and territories.\n\nIn 2025, in just one quarter, Marriott added 120 properties and 17,903 rooms, focusing on its asset-light franchising segment, according to analyst Daniel Javier for Seeking Alpha. Luxury offerings remained a priority, with 26 new hotels opening in India and 1,900 rooms added to its portfolio.\n\nHowever, Marriott also faced controversy. In November, the Maasai ethnic group filed a lawsuit to demolish a new Ritz-Carlton luxury safari camp, claiming it blocks a key Serengeti wildlife migration route.\n\nMeanwhile, a Fairfield by Marriott posted a sign stating that complimentary bottled water isn’t included, even for elite members, unless they select a “market item,” drawing mockery online, according to Veronika Bondarenko of TheStreet.\n\nMore recently, Marriott caused guest backlash with a new ban.\n\nThe New Orleans Marriott Warehouse Arts District caught attention from guests due to a sign saying “Benches are for Marriott employees only.”\n\nThe hotel is located in a 19th-century warehouse, close to the French Quarter,  the New Orleans Garden District, and the Central Business District.\n\n“Our New Orleans hotel in the downtown area enjoys an excellent location across the street from the New Orleans Ernest N. Morial Convention Center. Host events from 26,636 square feet of revamped event space and fuel up for the day ahead at our full-service Starbucks,” reads the description on Marriott's hotel page.\n\nThe benches in question are part of the hotel’s common area and are easily accessible by the public, which Marriott appears to prefer the public not use. A sign noting that the benches are for employee-only use is next to “No Smoking” and “No Loitering” plastered on the red brick wall, writes The Travel.\n\nDoes the sign mean that hotel guests, no matter their status, aren’t welcome to use the benches?\n\nWhile the water bottle incident is clear, as the hotel giant plainly states that  complimentary bottled water isn’t included unless guests select a “market item,” the sign designating benches only for employees is somewhat confusing.\n\nView from the Wing’s Gary Leff, a recognized expert in miles, points, and business travel, believes that the New Orleans Marriott sign “employees only” isn’t really about keeping guests out, but instead is meant to prevent loitering, smoking, panhandling, and other security issues near the entrance.\n\n“This sign is almost certainly not about guests. It’s in New Orleans. It’s about loitering control. They’re also flagging NO LOITERING and NO SMOKING. That says, we’ve had people hanging out here who aren’t supposed to be here and we want them gone,” writes Leff for View from the Wing.\n\nWhile the intent was maintaining security and staff space, the sign gives a poor impression of hospitality and might have been handled more tactfully with design changes, such as divided benches or better lighting.\n\nLeff further notes that the sign is not ideal for either guests or staff, as guests feel like they are not welcomed, and staff get a message along the lines that their breakout area is out on the sidewalk, under a \"No Loitering\" sign.\n\nOnline readers also weighed in on Marriott’s approach, providing insight into guest perceptions.\n\nIn the comment section of View from the Wing, one reader expressed frustration with the signage, noting it may not deter loitering effectively. While anecdotal, these reactions illustrate how guests perceive the policy.\n\nUser Mantis wrote, “...Now there’s a sign, oh my…that will surely solve the problem.”\n\nA user with a spontaneous username \"This comes to mind\" suggested a more precise sign: “For employees and currently registered guests only.”\n\nOther guests suggested the hotel could have hired a doorman, while another noted that a sign is less expensive.\n\nOverall, comments suggest that a world-class hotel brand such as Marriott could have managed the situation more subtly with alternative signage or layout changes.\n\nWhile guest reactions to the new policies highlight struggles in hospitality and brand perception, Marriott’s broader business operations in 2025 confirm both resilience and growth. Despite occasional controversies, the hotel giant continues to expand its portfolio, dominate new markets, launch special deals for its loyal members and deliver strong financial results.\n\nGrowth: Marriott added nearly 17,900 rooms in Q3 2025, reached a record pipeline, and returned $3.1 billion to shareholders, as reported in Marriott’s Q3 Earnings Report.\n\nInternational strength: International and higher-end markets continued to outperform the U.S. and Canada in RevPAR, as per Marriott’s Q3 Earnings Report.\n\nResidential expansion: Marriott expanded its branded residential portfolio across EMEA, signing nearly 20 new deals in 2025, according to Marriott’s official press release.\n\nNew brands: Marriott launched Series by Marriott and hit 100 City Express signings in the U.S. and Canada. \n\nAfrica plans: Marriott plans to add 50+ properties and 9,000 rooms in Africa by 2027. \n\nSonder fallout: Marriott ended its licensing deal with Sonder, which later filed for bankruptcy, causing customer and employee disruption, reported TheStreet.\n\nCost & loyalty pressures: Rising loyalty program costs and OTA commissions challenged Marriott, prompting a focus on direct bookings and perks, according to Deep Research Global.\n\nMixed market performance: International markets grew, while U.S. & Canada RevPAR lagged in some quarters, according to Marriott’s Q3 Earnings Report.\n\nAnother lawsuit: In November, Marriott was sued again in relation to land‑use, indigenous and cultural‑heritage disputes tied to hotel developments, reported TheStreet.",

    "fullText": "ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) — The United States and Ivory Coast signed a health deal Tuesday requiring the U.S. to commit $480 million to the West African nation’s health sector as part of “America First” global health funding pacts that mirror the Trump administration’s foreign policy.\n\nThe signing in Ivory Coast’s capital of Abidjan covers areas such as HIV, malaria, maternal and child health, and global health security. It is the latest agreement the U.S. has entered with more than a dozen African countries, most of them hit by U.S. aid cuts, including Ivory Coast.\n\nU.S. aid cuts have crippled health systems across the developing world, including in Africa, where many countries relied on the funding for crucial programs, including those responding to outbreaks of disease.\n\nThe new health pact is based on the principle of shared responsibility with Ivory Coast committing to provide up to 163 billion CFA francs ($292 million) by 2030, representing 60% of the overall commitment, according to Ivorian Prime Minister Robert Beugré Mambé.\n\nU.S. Ambassador to Ivory Coast Jessica Davis Ba said the U.S. government is moving “beyond the traditional aid approach toward a model focused on trade, innovation, and shared prosperity.”\n\n“Today, our bilateral cooperation is entering a new phase. We are implementing the America First global health strategy,” the ambassador said.\n\nThe Trump administration says the new “America First” global health funding agreements are meant to increase self-sufficiency and eliminate what it says are ideology and waste from international assistance. The deals replace a patchwork of previous health agreements under the now-dismantled United States Agency for International Development.\n\nIn Ivory Coast, USAID had invested $115 million to support sectors such as health, education and aid for refugees mostly fleeing violence in neighboring Sahel states.\n\nAnalysts say the new approach to global health aligns with U.S. President Donald Trump’s pattern of dealing with other nations transactionally, using direct talks with foreign governments to promote his agenda abroad.",

    "fullText": "on December 30, 2025 at 12:00PM PST\n\nGameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n\nNew Year’s Eve doesn’t have to be limited to champagne and confetti in the real world. Video games offer their own ways to celebrate, from dazzling fireworks to high-speed races and creative parties with friends. Sometimes, getting together virtually is the only way everyone can be together.\n\nIn Animal Crossing, you can ring in the new year with a sky full of fireworks over your island. Fortnite Creative lets you throw your own custom parties with friends, complete with music, games, and chaos. Mario Kart brings the celebration to the tracks, where fireworks light up the sky as you race across Rainbow Road as the clock towards the new year ticks down.\n\nNo matter your style, these games turn the countdown into an interactive, unforgettable experience that's perfect for friends and families who can't be together to ring in the new year.\n\nAnimal Crossing: New Horizons is one of the few games that fully commits to New Year’s Eve as an in-game event. On December 31, the plaza transforms with decorations, party favors, sparklers, and a real-time countdown that syncs with the player’s system clock. Isabelle and villagers gather in the square, music ramps up as midnight approaches, and fireworks cap off the celebration.\n\nBecause islands are persistent social spaces, players can invite friends over to experience the countdown together. Everyone can dress for the occasion, emote, exchange gifts, and wander the island after midnight. It feels less like a mini game and more like a shared holiday ritual, which is why it remains the gold standard for virtual New Year’s parties.\n\nWe have Mario Kart World listed here, but nearly any Mario Kart game will work. The series is known for gorgeous tracks that feature stunning visual effects, many of which are fireworks that would fit in on any New Year's Eve parade or celebration.\n\nHop online, hit up a few tracks, and if you're up for it--setup a race along one of those courses that feature fireworks just as the countdown triggers. We're talking Crown City or several iterations of Rainbow Road, among others.\n\nMario Kart World does offer custom lobbies that make it easy to connect with friends, but you can also tout Mario Kart out as part of any in-person New Year's Eve party too!\n\nWhile Epic Games has been known to feature fireworks in live battle royale lobbies near the end of the year, the real party kicks off in Fortnite Creative. Here you can find player-made game modes that let you play your own way--including custom trivia night mods, prop hunt, and party royale-like modes.\n\nOf course, there is absolutely nothing wrong with hopping from the battle bus together as the remaining hours in the year grow fewer and fewer. WinterFest takes place in Fortnite around the end of December each year, giving the island a snowy backdrop as you fight for your life.\n\nWarzone doesn't have the flexibility of something like Fortnite Creative, but its high-octane action makes for some scenes that feel like a New Year's Eve fireworks show. Blowing up helicopters out of the sky or sending trucks off the ground with explosives are little milestones on the way to battle royale victory.\n\nWarzone has become more popular than traditional Call of Duty--and for good reason. Battle royale brings the survival element of war that no other Call of Duty has before. Doing so, with friends, at the end of the year is a blast.\n\nFinal Fantasy XIV excels at player-driven celebrations. Housing districts, Free Company estates, and public hubs often host New Year’s countdowns organized by the community. Players dress up, set off fireworks, and gather around stages while DJs stream music externally.\n\nThe game’s strength is how social it feels even without official events. Emotes, glamour, and roleplay-friendly systems allow players to turn the night into a true virtual party. It feels communal, intentional, and uniquely festive.\n\nGTA Online offers endless locations for hosting a New Year’s party, from penthouses and yachts to nightclubs and rooftops. Fireworks launchers, champagne animations, and curated music help sell the celebration without much effort.\n\nPrivate sessions make it easy to turn chaos into a controlled party environment. Friends can dress up, take screenshots, and roam Los Santos together at midnight, blending sandbox freedom with a party atmosphere.\n\nMinecraft is a blank canvas for New Year’s parties. Players can build stages, countdown clocks, and massive firework rigs, then invite friends to explore and celebrate together. Redstone allows for surprisingly elaborate countdown mechanics.\n\nBecause it is player-driven, each party feels personal. Whether it is a cozy survival world or a creative server spectacle, Minecraft lets groups define what celebration looks like.\n\nRoblox thrives on social experiences, many of which are designed specifically for events. Player-creators and professionals regularly create countdown rooms, concert spaces, and dance clubs perfect for New Year’s Eve gatherings.\n\nIts accessibility makes it easy to invite large groups, even casual players. Jumping between games keeps the party moving, while social hubs provide a place to gather at midnight.\n\nFall Guys feels like a party game by design, with colorful characters and short, high-energy rounds. Friends can queue together and treat matches as playful chaos while chatting through the countdown. The lack of downtime makes it ideal for New Year’s Eve. It keeps energy high without demanding focus, letting players celebrate and laugh together.\n\nSome minigames offer the perfect backdrop for a New Year's Eve gathering, including Short Circuit and Hex-A-Terrestrial, complete with a night sky and bright lights to get you in the festive mood.\n\nNo Man’s Sky offers a surprisingly calm party atmosphere. The Nexus serves as a shared social hub, while player-built bases can become private celebration spaces complete with fireworks and emotes. The game works well for laid-back New Year’s parties. Players can explore, take group photos, and ring in the new year against alien skies.\n\nSea of Thieves turns New Year’s Eve into a pirate celebration. Crews can sail together, play shanties, drink grog, and fire cannons into the sky at midnight. The trick shots people have been able to pull off by launching themselves out of cannons, across the sea, and onto other ships are nothing short of incredible. Drunken-madness induced incredible, though.\n\nSea of Thieves adventures are less about competition or loot and more about the shared memorable moments created. Even just sailing under the stars can make for a wonderful way to ring in the new year.\n\nDeep Rock Galactic leans into rowdy celebration through its Space Rig hub. Players can dance, drink at the bar, and trigger music before or after missions, making it a natural gathering spot. Honestly, the Overwatch-like mining adventure is a blast, but sometimes you don't even need to jump into the action to have a good time.\n\nA New Year’s party here feels communal and silly. It is perfect for smaller groups that want something social without leaving co-op gameplay behind.",

    "fullText": "POPOCATÉPETL VOLCANO, Mexico (AP) — In the predawn darkness, a team of scientists climbs the slope of Mexico's Popocatépetl volcano, one of the world’s most active and whose eruption could affect millions of people. Its mission: figure out what is happening under the crater.\n\nFor five years, the group from Mexico’s National Autonomous University has climbed the volcano with kilos of equipment, risked data loss due to bad weather or a volcanic explosion and used artificial intelligence to analyze the seismic data. Now, the team has created the first three-dimensional image of the whole 17,883-foot (5,452-meter) volcano’s interior, which tells them where the magma accumulates and will help them better understand its activity, and, eventually, help authorities better react to eruptions.\n\nMarco Calò, professor in the UNAM's Geophysics Institute’s vulcanology department and the project leader, invited The Associated Press to accompany the team on its most recent expedition, the last before its research on the volcano will be published.\n\nInside an active volcano, everything is moving: the rocks, magma, gas and aquifers. It all generates seismic signals.\n\nMost of the world’s volcanoes that pose a risk to humans already have detailed maps of their interiors, but not Popocatépetl, despite the fact that some 25 million people live within a 62-mile (100 kilometers) radius and houses, schools, hospitals and five airports could be affected by an eruption.\n\nOther scientists took some early images 15 years ago, but they showed contradictory results and did not have sufficient resolution to see “how the volcanic edifice was being built,” and above all, where the magma gathered, Calò said.\n\nHis team increased the number of seismographs from the 12 provided by Mexico’s National Disaster Prevention Center to 22 to cover the entire perimeter of the volcano. Even though just three can alert to an emergency, many more are needed to understand what is behind those emergencies.\n\nThe devices measure vibrations in the ground 100 times per second and generate data that Karina Bernal, 33, a doctoral student and researcher on the project, processed by using artificial intelligence to adapt algorithms developed for other volcanoes.\n\n“I taught the machine about the different types of tremors there are in El Popo” and with that they were able to catalog the different kinds of seismic signals, she said.\n\nLittle by little the scientists began to infer what kinds of material were where, in what state, at what temperature and at what depth. Later they were able to map it.\n\nThe result is far more complex than the drawings of volcanoes most saw in school, with a main vent connecting a chamber of magma with the surface.\n\nThis first three-dimensional cross-sectional image goes 11 miles (18 kilometers) below the crater and shows what appear to be various pools of magma at different depths, with rock or other material between them and more numerous toward the southeast of the crater.\n\nPopocatépetl emerged in the crater of other volcanoes in its current form more than 20,000 years ago and has been active since 1994, spewing plumes of smoke, gas and ash more or less daily. The activity periodically forms a dome over the main vent, which eventually collapses, causing an eruption. The last was in 2023.\n\nCalò, a 46-year-old Sicilian, speaks passionately about El Popo, as Mexicans call the volcano, rattling off trivia.\n\nHe explains that its height can change because of eruptions and recounts how Popocatépetl, in the first century, had its own “little Pompeii” when a village on its flanks, Tetimpa, was buried in ash. In the early 20th century, it was human actions — using dynamite to extract sulfur from the crater — that provoked an eruption. And even though El Popo emanates more greenhouse gases than almost any other volcano, its emissions are still a small fraction of what humans generate in nearby Mexico City.\n\nFor years Calò studied volcanic activity from his computer, but trying to “understand how something works without touching it” spurred a feeling of disappointment, he said.\n\nThat changed with Popocatépetl, a volcano he describes as “majestic.”\n\nAfter hours of walking up the volcano’s flank, Calò’s team sets up camp in a pine grove at about 12,500 feet of elevation, an apparent safe spot from pyroclastic explosions, since the trees have managed to grow to significant height.\n\nA short distance higher on the mountain, the trees and scrub give way to ash and sediment.\n\nThey must cross a lahar, a mixture of rock and ash that during the rainy season becomes a dangerous mudflow carrying away everything in its path. Now, the dry clearing provides a spectacular view: to the east the Pico de Orizaba — Mexico’s tallest volcano and mountain and the dormant volcano La Malinche; to the north, Iztaccíhuatl, an inactive volcanic peak known as “the sleeping woman.”\n\nPopocatépetl’s sounds seem to multiply at night with the echoes. An explosion like a rocket might sound like it’s coming from one direction, but a puff of smoke from the crater belies the real source.\n\nKarina Rodríguez, a 26-year-old master’s student on the team, said you can also hear small tremors in the earth or even ash falling like rain when the volcano is more active. On dark nights, the rim of the crater glows orange.\n\nHaving direct knowledge of the volcano provides a much more objective sense of the limits of their analysis, Calò said.\n\n“We have a natural laboratory here,” he said. It’s “very important to be able to understand and give residents detailed, trustworthy information about what is happening inside the volcano.”\n\nAt 13,780 feet (4,200 meters), their backpacks full of computers, equipment to analyze gases, batteries and water begin to weigh more and their pace slows.\n\nAsh, dark and warm, dominates the landscape here.\n\nAt a seismographic station, the team digs up the equipment and celebrates that it’s still working. They download its data and rebury it.\n\nA “volcanic bomb,” a rock a yard and a half in diameter and weighing tons, marks the way and gives an idea of what the start of an eruption can mean. That is why the top area of the volcano is restricted, though not everyone pays heed. In 2022, a person died after being hit by a rock about 300 yards (meters) from the crater.\n\nA bottle of tequila near a rocky hollow, known as El Popo’s belly button, hints at some of the traditions surrounding the volcano, including an annual pilgrimage to what some consider a point of connection to the underworld.\n\nDigging up one of the last seismic stations, Calò’s face falls. The last registered data are from months earlier. The battery died. Sometimes rats chew the machines’ wires or an explosion causes more serious damage.\n\nThe project has yielded some certainties and if repeated will allow the analysis of changes that eventually will help authorities make better decisions when eruptions occur.\n\nBut Calò says that, as always happens with science, it has also generated new questions that they will have to try to address, like why the tremors are more frequent on the southeast side — where there is more accumulated magma — and what implications that could have.\n\nThis was the last expedition before their years of work to map the volcano’s interior is published. Watching the volcano’s interior move in 3D on a computer screen makes all of the effort worthwhile.\n\n“It’s what drives you to start another project and keep climbing,” Rodríguez, the master's student, said.",

    "fullText": "\"The lady doth protest too much, methinks.\"\n\nSometimes the classics tell the story and, in this case, Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\" applies.\n\nEarlier this month, TheStreet published an analysis of Saks Global's financial situation. It did not paint a pretty picture.\n\nRagini Bhalla, head of brand and spokesperson for Creditsafe, shared data on the struggles Saks Fifth Avenue has faced, which could push the company into a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing.\n\nIt’s important to note that Bhalla used publicly available financial information to analyze the company. Saks itself has not issued a going concern warning or made any public comment on a potential Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing.\n\n“Saks Inc.’s Days Beyond Terms (DBT) data over the past twelve months reveals a persistent and troubling pattern of late payments that point to sustained cash flow distress. DBT measures how many days late a company pays its bills. Throughout the entire year, Saks’ DBT has hovered well above the industry average of 10-12 days, ranging from a low of 27 in November 2024 to a high of 41 in January 2025 and March 2025,” she shared in an email to TheStreet.\n\nShe then explained the info in very clear terms.\n\n\"This indicates that Saks has consistently taken nearly a month or more to pay its suppliers late,\" she wrote.\n\nDespite the clarity of the information, which at least heavily suggested major financial concerns at Saks Global, the company denied that anything was wrong.\n\n“We are making strong progress to reduce outstanding payments, invest in our transformation and drive improved performance. It is important to note that a restructuring is not being contemplated. We have sufficient liquidity after raising $600 million in financing this summer from existing bondholders. At the same time, with inventory levels normalizing and the significant synergies from our integration, we expect performance to improve through the holiday season and into 2026,” the company shared in a statement sent to TheStreet.\n\nIn addition, the company spokesperson took significant issue with the idea that the company was in any danger of filing Chapter 11 bankruptcy.\n\nThose denials of bankruptcy, not even being considered by the Saks Global board, now ring very hollow.\n\nA number of major news outlets have now reported that Saks Global Enterprises has very much put a Chapter 11 filing on the table.\n\nBloomberg:Saks Mulls Bankruptcy After Raising Billions for Turnaround\n\nPYMNTS:Saks Considers Chapter 11 Bankruptcy as $100M Debt Payment Comes Due\n\nBizJournals: Neiman Marcus parent reportedly considers bankruptcy",

    "fullText": "A fan group says \"alarm bells should be ringing at Fifa\" over the fact England supporters have not taken up their full ticket allocation for next summer's World Cup final and semi-final.\n\nSo far the number of allocated tickets to members of the England Supporters Travel Club (ESTC) exceeds the number of applications received, meaning everyone who has applied for a ticket to the final and semi-final is guaranteed one.\n\nThe pricing structure for the tournament in the United States, Canada and Mexico has been widely criticised, with about 90% of tickets for the final made available to ESTC members costing £3,094.\n\nThat led to Fifa introducing a limited number of tickets at £45, but the Football Supporters' Association's Fans' Embassy says England fans not taking up their allocation should be a concern.\n\n\"Whilst unsurprisingly the group games are oversubscribed, as well as the possible glamour tie in Mexico City in the round of 16, the numbers for the semi-final and final speak for themselves,\" the group said in a statement.\n\n\"The numbers are reflective of a fan base that has been priced out, and some of the most loyal supporters of the international game feel completely let down.\n\n\"Alarm bells should be ringing whenever participating member allocations, meant for the most loyal fans, are not sold out for any game at a World Cup.\"\n\nFifa has been criticised for group stage tickets for next year's World Cup costing up to three times those for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.\n\nEarlier this week Fifa president Gianni Infantino defended the prices, saying they reflect the public's \"absolutely crazy\" demand for tickets.\n\n\"We have six to seven million tickets on sale and in 15 days we received 150 million ticket requests,\" Infantino said.\n\n\"So 10 million ticket requests every single day. It shows how powerful the World Cup is.\"",

The only time I felt some nerves was when I was throwing to win it and then at the end.\"\n\nHood, who began the tournament ranked 86th in the world, is provisionally into the top 50 thanks to his victory over Northern Ireland's Rock - who had been tipped as a potential tournament winner.",

Presenter James Gregg will provide updates on BBC Sounds throughout the competition.\n\nThis article is the latest from BBC Sport's Ask Me Anything team.\n\nAsk Me Anything is a service dedicated to answering your questions.\n\nWe want to reward your time by telling you things you do not know and reminding you of things you do.\n\nThe team will find out everything you need to know and be able to call upon a network of contacts including our experts and pundits.\n\nWe will be answering your questions from the heart of the BBC Sport newsroom, and going behind the scenes at some of the world's biggest sporting events.\n\nOur coverage will span the BBC Sport website, app, social media and YouTube accounts, plus BBC TV and radio.\n\nHow do darts world rankings work?\n\nWho is Arsenal teenager Salmon?\n\nWhy is Steve Smith wearing black tape under his eyes?\n\nWhen is the FA Cup third round draw?",
