    "fullText": "Eredivisie giants Ajax are considering a winter loan move for Manchester United midfielder Manuel Ugarte, according to Voetbal International.​\n\nUgarte joined United from Paris Saint-Germain for around €50 million in the summer of 2024, but struggled for a consistent starting role in England.\n\nHe has started only six of United’s twenty Premier League matches this season, a limited role that has pushed him to seek more regular minutes.\n\nWhile Ugarte is open to moving to Amsterdam on a temporary basis, his salary remains a stumbling block given Ajax’s current wage structure.\n\nAny loan deal would therefore have to be with Manchester United continuing to cover a significant portion of his wages, and this will require tough negotiations between the clubs.\n\nUgarte is contracted to United until 2029 and is also attracting interest from other clubs, including Turkish giants Galatasaray, which means Ajax will face competition if talks progress.​\n\nAjax are in the market for a defensive midfielder, and while Ugarte is considered a serious short-term option, the Eredivisie giants are also keeping an eye on long-term solutions.\n\nMeanwhile, alongside Ugarte, Daley Blind is also viewed as another potential addition.\n\nWith Blind’s Girona contract expiring in the summer, any January transfer will be expected to come at a modest fee.\n\nAjax see the Dutch veteran as a cost-effective option who could contribute on the pitch and later transition into a mentoring or off-field role in Amsterdam.​\n\nAfter a horrid spell between September 30 and November 25, when Ajax won just one of 10 matches across all competitions, De Godenzonen have won six and drawn one of their subsequent seven games.\n\nHowever, they remain a whopping 16 points shy of PSV Eindhoven in the title race.",

    "fullText": "After a series of speculations, Barcelona have finally made a breakthrough in the deal to sign Joao Cancelo.\n\nThe Portuguese international is set to join Barcelona on a short-term loan deal worth €5 million, as confirmed by Fabrizio Romano.\n\nThe Catalans are planning to announce the Cancelo deal later this week, having reached an agreement with Al Hilal.\n\nFurther confirmation of Cancelo’s move to Barcelona came from Al Hilal coach Simone Inzaghi today.\n\nSpeaking ahead of the team’s upcoming game against Al Hazm, the Italian coach confirmed Cancelo is not in his plans anymore and that the club are working on resolving his future.\n\n“Cancelo is not in our plans and the club is working on it,” said Inzaghi (h/t Mundo Deportivo).\n\nThis is yet another indicator that the former Juventus star is indeed rejoining Barcelona, and the deal could be finalised soon.\n\nCancelo will soon be on his way to Barcelona. (Photo by Octavio Passos/Getty Images)\n\nInterestingly, Inzaghi’s former team, Inter Milan, were interested in the services of Cancelo as well and had even reached an agreement with Al Hilal. But the player had his heart set on a return to Barcelona.\n\nCancelo, in fact, has big plans upon his impending return to Barcelona, as he wants to stay at Camp Nou beyond the end of the season.\n\nSuch a move would depend on Barcelona’s relationship with Al Hilal, who have shown interest in signing Raphinha and have already tabled a bid worth €100 million.\n\nA potential Al Hilal move for Raphinha would certainly pave the way for the Saudi giants to release Cancelo.\n\nHowever, such a deal would depend entirely on the Brazilian international, who will be allowed to move on due to a gentleman’s agreement between him and Deco.",

    "description": "Recent advances show that large language models (LLMs) can act as autonomous agents capable of generating GPU kernels, but integrating these AI-generated kernels into real-world inference systems remains challenging. FlashInfer-Bench addresses this gap by establishing a standardized, closed-loop framework that connects kernel generation, benchmarking, and deployment. At its core, FlashInfer Trace provides a unified schema describing kernel definitions, workloads, implementations, and evaluations, enabling consistent communication between agents and systems. Built on real serving traces, FlashInfer-Bench includes a curated dataset, a robust correctness- and performance-aware benchmarking framework, a public leaderboard to track LLM agents' GPU programming capabilities, and a dynamic substitution mechanism (apply()) that seamlessly injects the best-performing kernels into production LLM engines such as SGLang and vLLM. Using FlashInfer-Bench, we further evaluate the performance and limitations of LLM agents, compare the trade-offs among different GPU programming languages, and provide insights for future agent design.",

    "title": "The college-to-office path is dead: CEO of the world’s biggest recruiter says Gen Z grads need to consider trade and hospitality jobs that don’t even require degrees",
    "description": "Struggling Gen Z and millennial grads should consider turning their back on their degrees and retraining to become hospitality and trade workers, Randstad’s CEO warns.",
    "fullText": "Millions of Gen Zers are facing unemployment as entry-level office roles get absorbed by AI, and millennials are regretting taking out thousands in student loans for careers that now have significantly diminished prospects. Now, the CEO of the world’s biggest talent company, Randstad, has confirmed what many young grads are already fearing: The traditional college-to-office pipeline is dead.\n\n“People need to reflect on—taking a student loan, going to college and being trained or educated for a profession that is rapidly changing—whether that’s still the right path,” Sander van ’t Noordende, the global CEO of Randstad, told Fortune.\n\n“We all grew up, with our parents saying, ‘go do something in college or university and then do something in an office,’ that path that used to work for a long time is starting to break,” he added.\n\n“You already see that with the graduates finding it harder to find a job. You see that in professions like marketing, communications, design… just look at how good AI already is at some of that.”\n\nUnder his helm, the staffing company places around half a million workers in jobs every week—and he has bad news for those who have already forked out thousands for their degree in the hopes of nabbing a cushy office role: You may have more luck landing bartending, barista, or building jobs.\n\nTech leaders have consistently warned that AI is already as good as entry-level workers and that it could halve white-collar jobs by 2030. In fact, a “first-of-its-kind” Stanford University study has warned that the new technology is already having “significant and disproportionate impact” on Gen Z. Bartenders and baristas are even seeing bigger pay raises than desk workers, right now.\n\n“Jobs will change—and are changing—but also new jobs will emerge,” van ’t Noordende echoed. “There is a massive demand in skilled trades, mechanical engineers, machine operators, maintenance engineers, forklift drivers, truck drivers—you name it.”\n\nWith the white-collar job market seemingly frozen, van ’t Noordende said it’s no longer “good advice” to tell young people to follow their passions.\n\n“No, learn a craft or a trade or a skill or a profession, where you can make a good living and provide for you and your family, is much better advice than follow your passion.”\n\nFurther making his case: The U.K. government has just announced it’ll be splurging $965 million into apprenticeships to help place tens of thousands of unemployed young people into the jobs that they think are the future—and they’re all in hospitality, retail, and AI.\n\nBut for those hell-bent on going to college, van ’t Noordende stressed that STEM subjects—which are studied in China at twice the rate of the U.S. and parts of Europe—will likely remain in demand.\n\nAnd his advice to those who’ve already wasted time and money on a degree that’s dwindling in relevance? “Retrain. Learning new skills always good.”\n\n“Look around you, and where you see the opportunities that match with your skills and your background and go there,” van ’t Noordende added. But he warned that at some point, you may just “have to bite the bullet and say, ‘Okay, this is not working.’”\n\nThe CEO stressed that you’re not alone; many people are currently doing exactly that. And that ultimately, going from a desk job to becoming a plumber, teacher, or nurse, van ’t Noordende says, requires a mindset shift. It’s not a failure if you end up doing work outside your field of study—it’s just adjusting to what actually works. “You have to come off your chair and build skills,” he added.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

    "fullText": "In this week’s newsletter: Stranger Things’ climactic showdown is the latest pop culture spectacle to feel like its been ported straight from a console. The industries’ reciprocally influential relationship can be to everyone’s gain\n\nDon’t get Pushing Buttons delivered to your inbox? \nIt had begun to feel like an endurance test by the end, but nonetheless, like the sucker I am, I watched the Stranger Things finale last week. And spoiler warning: I’m going to talk about it in general terms in this newsletter. Because approximately 80% of the final season comprised twentysomething “teenagers” explaining things to each other while using random 1980s objects to illustrate convoluted plans and plot points, my expectations were not high. After an interminable hour, finally, something fun happens, as the not-kids arm themselves with machine guns and molotovs and face off against a monstrously gigantic demon-crab. Aha, I thought – the final boss battle!\n\nThe fight was like something out of Monster Hunter, all scale and spectacle with a touch of desperation. For a very long time, video games sought to imitate cinema. Now cinema (and TV) often feels like a video game. The structure of Stranger Things’ final season reminded me a lot of Resident Evil: long periods of walking slowly through corridors, with characters exchanging plot information aloud on their way to the action, and occasional explosions of gunfire, screeching monsters or car chases. Those long periods of relative inaction are much more tolerable when you’ve got a controller in your hands. I am all for TV and film embracing the excitement, spectacle and dynamism of video games, but do they have to embrace the unnecessary side-quests and open-world bloat, too?\n\nThe reciprocally influential relationship between games, TV and film has developed a lot in the last few years. A generation of gen X and elder-millennial gamers have recently aged into creative and commissioning power in these industries. That’s why we’re getting people such as Jonathan Nolan heading up an excellent Fallout TV show, and indeed why all video-game-to-screen adaptations have become dramatically less terrible in the past five years or so. It also inevitably means that the boundaries between interactive and non-interactive entertainment are becoming more porous: where previously game-makers were heavily influenced by film (primarily but not exclusively Alien/s and Star Wars), now that relationship works both ways. Most Marvel movies look and feel like a video game to me, and not just because they’re all full of computer-generated graphics. It’s the mood and pace of them.\n\nEdge of Tomorrow remains the most video-game-ish movie I’ve ever seen: its premise revolves around dying and respawning, trying out different things on each run. It’s a sci-fi roguelike of a film. I wanted to play Mad Max: Fury Road the entire time I was watching it, and John Wick 4 was literally a fighting-game boss rush. When film critics say that a film feels like a video game, they often mean it disparagingly; a lot of cinephiles still see games as the lower form. When I say a movie feels like a video game, it’s a compliment – unless it feels like a boring video game.\n\nThis was the problem, for me, with Stranger Things: every episode felt like loading up an open-world game that I hadn’t played for a few months. More and more characters kept appearing, and I didn’t remember or care who most of them were. Between the Upside Down, Vecna’s mindscape, real-world Hawkins and an entirely new dimension introduced in the last couple of episodes, there were too many locations to keep track of. Every episode brought on the mild despair I feel when I think I’m near the end of an overlong game, only to discover yet another entirely new area to explore. The painfully long epilogue, meanwhile, was rivalled only by Red Dead Redemption 2’s interminable post-game hours. Please, just let it end already!\n\nOf course, in modern pop culture, nothing is ever allowed to end properly, not if it’s still making money. I’m surprised there’s been no word of an official Stranger Things video game tie-in (outside of a retro-style smartphone beat-em-up from 2019). Come to think of it, we don’t see many of these kinds of licensed games any more: back in the 00s and 2010s, most major movies and TV shows launched with an interactive accompaniment. Presumably this is because of the spiralling cost of game development – you can’t knock out a mediocre PlayStation 2 game in nine months any more – but also, when TV shows feel so much like games, do we really need an adaptation anyway?\n\nThe first game I’ve finished in 2026 is Indika, a surreal and mildly horrible game about a young nun questioning her faith and having conversations with the devil as she goes on an extremely strange journey through bleak, snow-covered villages and abandoned factories with an escaped convict. There are much-needed flashes of humour in here, but also stuff about religion, control and sexuality that I haven’t seen in a video game before. It’s also part of a small wave of games (see Baby Steps) that mocks gamer mentality: there are points, but they are pointless; explore off the beaten path and you will find something useless and inconsequential rather than a secret or something fun. And that’s if you find anything at all.\n\nAvailable on: PC, PS5, Xbox, Nintendo Switch\n\n Estimated playtime: five hours\n\nDavid Rosen, the co-founder of Sega and an influential figure in the history of arcade video games, died on Christmas Day at 95. Keith Stuart writes about his very interesting life.\n\nHollow Knight: Silksong has picked up a game-of-the-year trophy in PC games storefront Steam’s publicly voted awards. The Sit Back and Relax award was won by something I’ve never heard of: RV There Yet. I have bought it out of curiosity.\n\nMy book about Nintendo is out next month! It’s called Super Nintendo and it’s a lively cultural history of the most beloved company in games, based on 20 years of interviews (and 30 years as a player). You can support the Guardian by ordering it through the Guardian Bookshop, and I’ll also be doing launch events around the UK throughout February.\n\nThe 15 best PS5 games to play in 2026\n\n‘I wanted that Raiders of the Lost Ark excitement – you could die any minute’\n\nFrom K-pop and The Traitors to Grand Theft Auto VI: your A-Z of the biggest culture of 2026\n\nIn a recent Pushing Buttons, Keza mentioned that games have consolidated into five established mega-franchises and I was trying to work out which franchises these are? I guessed GTA, Fortnite, Call of Duty, Minecraft and EA FC, but don’t have huge confidence in that!\n\nYou’re not far off. According to data from Circana, the top five most played games on PlayStation 5 this year were exactly the same as last year: Fortnite, Call of Duty, Grand Theft Auto 5 (including Online), Roblox and Minecraft. All of these games are five to 10-plus years old. This stagnation at the top is why every big publisher has spent millions in the last decade trying to create live-service games, and why most of them have flopped. Last year on Steam, meanwhile, only 14% of all playtime was spent on new games released in 2025. Any developer releasing something new, be they blockbuster or indie, is competing for a sliver of a sliver of players’ time and money. These stats explain a lot about why the games industry is where it is right now, and why there’s such a bleak mood among many developers.",

Another vintage piece — maybe from the '70s instead of the '50s — might have worked better.\n\nDolce & Gabbana designed the three-piece set he wore. It included loose-fitting velvet pants, a matching blazer with a satin lining, and a soft vest worn underneath.\n\nThe suit was complemented by black velvet loafers, aviator sunglasses, a satin undershirt, and an assortment of fine jewelry from David Yurman.\n\nColman's outfit was chic, on trend, and the epitome of quiet luxury.\n\nThe \"Happy Gilmore\" star posed on the red carpet wearing a jewel-toned suit with a matching purple tie. Though the outfit was eye-catching, it was also arguably too flashy.\n\nHis wife, Jackie Sandler, had a stronger fashion moment in a strapless, gold gown with a black lace overlay. Still, her outfit would have been stronger if she'd worn a darker slip beneath the top layer.\n\nHer dark ensemble was designed by Haider Ackermann for Tom Ford.\n\nIt featured pleated trousers that were tailored perfectly to the musician, a satin blazer with sharp shoulder pads, and a polka-dot blouse with a plunging neckline that reached her stomach.\n\nHe wore a classic suit for the film festival, pairing a black blazer and trousers with a white undershirt and tie.\n\nThough he undoubtedly looked dapper at the event's red carpet, his outfit was too understated. It's unlikely to be remembered alongside brighter, more artistic fashion choices.\n\nShe wore a sparkling Georges Chakra gown. The semi-sheer piece had a sleeveless, backless bodice with a deep V-shaped neckline, a floor-length skirt, and a wrap belt that draped across the floor.\n\nThe dress proved that red is Hudson's color.\n\nThe actor attended the festival in a strapless, leather midi dress. It had a high-low skirt with delicate pleats and a form-fitting bodice.\n\nUnfortunately, the dress was styled too simply. It would have been more impactful if worn with an updo hairstyle and statement jewelry.",

    "title": "Vintage photos show Venezuela before its economic collapse, when oil wealth made it one of the world's richest nations",
    "description": "Once one of the world's richest nations, Venezuela has faced a decadeslong collapse that triggered one of the largest migrations in history.",
    "fullText": "Half a century ago, Venezuela was one of the world's richest nations. Today, decades of economic collapse have driven nearly a quarter of its population to flee the country.\n\nOn January 3, the US launched a military operation in Venezuela that resulted in the capture of President Nicolás Maduro. He pleaded not guilty to narco-terrorism and weapons-related charges in New York on Monday.\n\nThe seizure of the country's leader, which Venezuelan officials have called a \"kidnapping,\" has raised questions about sovereignty and legality, as well as Venezuela's political and economic future.\n\nThe country, which has the largest proven oil reserves in the world, estimated at about a fifth of the world's total, produces less than 1% of the global oil production today, due to what President Donald Trump has called \"badly broken infrastructure.\"\n\nUS officials have said they will seek to influence Venezuela's transitional government and attract investment from American energy companies to help revive its collapsed oil sector.\n\nDuring the 1950s and more dramatically in the 1970s, Venezuela experienced periods of vast oil-fueled economic growth — nicknamed by historians as \"Saudi Venezuela\" — where luxury, foreign travel, and modernization defined a growing middle class.\n\nAt the same time, the dramatic wealth of the era left some behind, highlighting the visible inequalities that contributed to a shift in domestic politics by the end of the century.\n\nThese vintage photos capture what life in Venezuela was like during its decades of oil-fueled economic prosperity and how the country evolved as its economy boomed.\n\nThe first oil discovery in Venezuela was made near Lake Maracaibo in 1914. The national oil industry experienced exponential growth throughout the 1920s and 1930s, as foreign investments began to pour into the country.\n\nThe oil industry's boom transformed the country's economy, which had previously primarily been a coffee exporter.\n\nThe growing oil industry concentrated jobs and investment in the country's capital, drawing migrants from rural areas and smaller cities in search of work and opportunity.\n\n\"There was a growing, expansive, and increasingly influential middle class that established itself in the oil industry,\" said Miguel Tinker Salas, a Pomona College history professor focusing on Venezuelan oil culture and society.\n\nBefore the discovery and expansion of the oil industry in the country, Venezuela was a poor and rural nation, and its economy was defined by agricultural exports, such as coffee and cacao, as reported by Mongabay. Wealth in Venezuela was predominantly held by large landowners, who formed a dominant elite.\n\nThe rapid growth of the oil industry provided the country's middle class, which was relatively small and concentrated in cities like Caracas, with an opportunity for professional expansion.\n\n\"They benefited tremendously from oil wealth and held managerial and professional positions,\" Tinker Salas told Business Insider. \"But they remained a small percentage of the population.\"\n\nHe estimates that less than 20% of the population was part of the middle class that emerged from oil growth.\n\n\"The hardware of modernity — the buildings, the architecture, the glitzy lights, and the planned development of cities — was made possible by oil,\" said Alejandro Velasco, an associate professor of Latin American history at New York University.\n\nAs oil wealth flowed into the country, urban consumer culture in Caracas and other major cities was heavily influenced by the United States. Among members of the middle and upper classes, shopping, fashion, and leisure increasingly reflected American tastes and lifestyles.\n\n\"For a particular segment of the population, they wanted to see themselves as an appendage of Miami-Dade County,\" Tinker Salas said. \"For another segment of the population, that dream was never possible.\"\n\n\"Those who had money,\" Tinker Salas said, \"could get on a plane in Caracas on a Friday afternoon, be in Miami in three hours, shop at Miami department stores, and come back on Sunday afternoon.\"\n\nCaracas also became an international hub for fashion and culture, attracting designers, models, and luxury brands from around the world.\n\nFrom 1976 to 1982, Air France operated a weekly Concorde flight between Caracas and Paris, a symbol of how closely Venezuela's elites aligned themselves with Europe during the oil boom.\n\nEconomic prosperity made luxury brands and high-end shopping popular in parts of Caracas, particularly for the country's wealthiest residents. But that consumer culture existed alongside stark economic inequality.\n\n\"You had fancy department stores and consumer culture existing side by side with deep inequality,\" Tinker Salas said.\n\nWhile the capital city remained the center of political and economic power, oil revenues also fueled development in other cities, shaping urban life across much of the country and giving more people access to \"electricity, medical services, and infrastructure that was often lacking in rural areas,\" Tinker Salas said.\n\nThroughout the century, as the agricultural industry lost its dominance of the domestic economy, the country saw increased internal migration to urban centers.\n\nThe city surrounding Lake Maracaibo, where oil was first discovered in the country, grew into Venezuela's second-largest city as oil production expanded.\n\nIts economy, identity, and growth were closely tied to oil, making the city a counterpart to Caracas during Venezuela's decades of rapid expansion.\n\nAs international companies grew their operations, Maracaibo welcomed many foreign oil workers.\n\nAs the oil industry expanded, Venezuela attracted foreign oil workers and immigrants, including Europeans during and after World War II. These arrivals helped shape the culture of the country's major cities.\n\n\"Oil exploration brought cultural influence, but Venezuela also became a destination for immigrants from Europe and across Latin America,\" Velasco said.\n\nNot every part of Venezuela was reshaped evenly during the expansion of the oil industry. As cities expanded, many rural areas continued to rely on agriculture, fishing, and local trade throughout the mid-century.\n\n\"On the surface, the country had a veneer of progress,\" Tinker Salas said. \"Venezuela had the highest standard of living in Latin America, but it also had the highest cost of living.\"\n\nWhile modern high-rises emerged in Caracas and other major cities, slums and informal settlements — or barrios — surrounding urban centers often told a different story from the luxurious, store-lined streets.\n\n\"The city was expanding and growing dramatically,\" Tinker Salas said, \"but alongside and in the shadow of those high-rise buildings were poor shacks where people lived in poverty.\"\n\nIn many neighborhoods, access to reliable water, sanitation, and other basic services remained limited even as other parts of the city modernized. Rapid urban growth during the oil era often outpaced infrastructure and long-term planning, leaving families to manage everyday shortages on their own.\n\nThe growth of informal neighborhoods surrounding major cities was a marker of internal migration patterns, where families from rural areas came to the city.\n\n\"Before the 1950s, barrios served as a kind of transitional space — people were in the city, but not fully of the city,\" Velasco said. \"There was a sense of gradual upward mobility: moving from the countryside into a barrio, then into a rented room, then eventually into a house or apartment.\"\n\n\"Even at the height of the so-called golden era, there was tremendous social, cultural, and economic disparity,\" Tinker Salas said.\n\nBetween the late 1940s and the 1950s, the dictator Marcos Pérez Jiménez ruled Venezuela after rising to power during a period of political instability.\n\nHis military government utilized growing oil revenues to fund major infrastructure and modernization projects, even as political and civil freedoms were tightly restricted, reflecting a long-standing pattern of strongman rule that has shaped Venezuelan politics during the country's push toward democracy.\n\nUnder Pérez Jiménez, large public housing projects — or superblocks — were constructed in an effort to modernize the capital and reshape its working-class population. During this effort, informal settlements and barrios were razed, and their residents were forcibly relocated into high-rise complexes designed to reshape their way of life.\n\n\"People were suddenly expected to become modern residents in new spaces, and that transition was difficult,\" Velasco said.\n\nDaily life in the complexes was regulated by strict rules of conduct and state oversight. The model relied on the control of an authoritarian state, Velasco said, which ended as Venezuela moved toward democracy.\n\n\"The failure of that project produced a paradox where you have superblocks and barrios right next to each other,\" Velasco said.\n\nLinking the capital to the mountaintop Hotel Humbold, the Caracas Aerial Tramway symbolized how the state used large-scale public works to project progress, visibility, and national pride in an era that emphasized monumental infrastructure as proof of modernization.\n\nOpened in 1953 as part of a government effort to increase tourism, the Hotel Tamanaco was a key component of a broader initiative to present Venezuela as a modern, international destination.\n\nThe military dictatorship ended in early 1958, but the transition to democracy was marked by unrest, strikes, and internal divisions within the armed forces. In the months that followed, a new civilian-led government struggled to stabilize the country and respond to popular demands amid lingering uncertainty.\n\n\"The 1960s, when democracy began in Venezuela, are not a period of abundance,\" Velasco said. \"They're a period of crisis.\"\n\nDuring the early days of its democracy, Venezuela was widely perceived abroad — and promoted at home — as a stable democracy at a time when military rule was common in Latin America.\n\nHigh-profile diplomatic engagements, like the visit of US President John F. Kennedy, promoted the myth of Venezuela as an \"exceptional democracy,\" as Tinker Salas described it, even during a time when democratic regimes struggled internally.\n\n\"The myth of Venezuela as the exceptional democracy persisted because Venezuela provided the contrary example to what was happening in Cuba,\" Tinker Salas said.\n\nConstruction of the Guri Dam began in the early 1960s and continued in phases through the 1980s, reflecting a long-term effort to channel oil revenues into large-scale development projects.\n\nThe hydroelectric complex was part of a broader effort to diversify Venezuela's economy and modernize the country through investments in industry, energy, and infrastructure, extending beyond oil itself.\n\nIntroduced through US oil companies and foreign workers, baseball spread first through oil camps and industrial towns before taking root across the country.\n\nOver time, the sport moved beyond its foreign origins and became a shared cultural language, eventually emerging as one of Venezuela's most powerful symbols of national identity.\n\nAs television spread across Venezuela, variety shows and music programs introduced salsa, Caribbean rhythms, and popular performers into living rooms nationwide.\n\nLaunched in the early 1950s, the Miss Venezuela pageant grew alongside the spread of television and mass media, turning beauty competitions into nationally shared events.\n\nOver time, the pageant evolved into a symbol of national pride, representing how Venezuelans presented themselves to one another and to the world.\n\nDecades of rapid growth reshaped daily life in Venezuela, affecting everyone from rural migrants who moved into expanding cities to foreign immigrants who arrived as the country experienced unprecedented prosperity.\n\nFor those who remained in Venezuela — and for the millions who have since left — the past paints a complex picture of ambition, luxury, and inequality.",

    "fullText": "It's CES week, when the tech world gathers in Las Vegas to check out the latest gadgets, prototypes, and innovations that will shape the future. Lifehacker's tech team is on the ground at the convention, tracking down big stories and cool gear.\n\nBilling itself as \"The Most Powerful Tech Event in the World,\" CES (short for \"Consumer Electronics Show\") is the Consumer Technology Association's trade convention. It began in 1967 as a small showcase for televisions and radios, but over the decades CES has become a gathering of the tribes for tech culture. Everyone is there, from huge companies like Samsung and Sony, to scores of journalists, to scrappy startups with big dreams. From innovative AI tools to electric vehicles, laptops, e-readers, and robotic dogs, CES is where tech companies show off their wares, journalists dig up the next big story, and tech insiders network and sneak a look into the future.\n\nCES is held in Las Vegas from Jan. 6-9. The Las Vegas Convention Center hosts the main show floor, but there are CES-related events at the Fontainebleau Las Vegas, Mandalay Bay, The Sphere, and other locations across Las Vegas.\n\nMost major electronics and technology companies are attending CES 2026 in some form. Here are some of the most vital exhibitors:\n\nSamsung Electronics: Samsung's theme this year is \"Your Companion to AI Living,\" and the focus is how artificial intelligence can enhance people's day-to-day lives.\n\nLG Electronics: Describing it as \"innovation in tune with you\" and \"affectionate intelligence,\" LG is showing off its take on AI designed to power robots, appliances, vehicles and TVs.\n\nSony: Sony's main focus this year is mobility. It's unveiling the Sony Honda Mobility (SHM) and showcasing the AFEELA electric vehicle Prototype.\n\nTCL: It's not CES without new TVs, and TCL is showing off a gigantic set with a SQD-Mini LED display.\n\nPanasonic: Under the banner \"The future we make,\" Panasonic promises it is \"leveraging the power of AI to amplify the impact of our human-centric technologies, services and solutions.\"\n\nNVIDIA: The chip-maker is showcasing its new Vera Rubin AI supercomputer platform, the Alpamayo reasoning model for self-driving vehicles, and more.\n\nAMD: AMD is unveiling the Ryzen AI processors for PCs and the Ryzen 7 9850X3D for gaming.\n\nIntel: Intel launched its new Intel Core Ultra Series 3 processors, codenamed \"Panther Lake.\"\n\nUber: Transportation firm Uber wants you to know about its new robotaxi.\n\nThe LEGO Group: Lovable toy makers LEGO announced \"Smart Bricks,\" packed with a tiny processor that \"brings play to life.\"\n\nIkea: Making its first appearance at CES, Swedish furniture retailer Ikea unveiled 21 new smart home products.\n\nIn fact, so many brands exhibit at CES, it's more notable which ones aren't there. This year's list of no-shows includes Apple (which never really does CES), iRobot, and Tesla. Big brands with a more limited presence include Microsoft and Amazon.\n\nAlong with the expected innovations in televisions and laptops, CES 2026 is crammed with artificial intelligence, robots, and mobility devices, and health-focused wearables. Here are some of the biggest announcements at CES 2026 so far.\n\nAt its keynote, NVIDIA unveiled Alpamayo, \"the world's first thinking, reasoning autonomous vehicle AI.\" This could be serious competition for Tesla.\n\nHP showed off a new mini desktop computer, The Eliteboard G1a. You just plug the keyboard into any monitor and go to town. Only time will tell if this is a gimmick or a new form factor.\n\nHyundai and Boston Dynamics showed off humanoid robot Atlas. But Hyundai didn't show off any new electric vehicles, suggesting a cautious outlook for the near future.\n\nBroadcom showed off Wi-Fi 8 routers and chips, providing a practical look into the future.\n\nBelow is a guide to some of the major events at CES 2026.\n\nSunday, January 4: Media Day 1 at Mandalay Bay\n\nMonday, January 5: Media Day 2 at Mandalay Bay.

    "description": "Brazil surpassed the U.S. as the world's top beef producer last year, according to market estimates, after the South American country",
    "fullText": "BARRETOS, Brazil, Jan 7 (Reuters) - Brazil surpassed the U.S. as the world's top beef producer last year, according to market estimates, after the South American country beat output forecasts by hundreds of thousands of tons, easing a global supply squeeze and helping limit a surge in meat prices.\n\nBrazil was already the biggest beef exporter, shipping meat worth almost $17 ​billion in 2025, according to government trade data released on Tuesday. Beef production numbers are not due until February, but analysts have recently raised their estimates. Farmers have been sending more animals to ‌slaughter, cashing in on high export demand from countries including China and the U.S., where low supply has pushed beef prices to record levels.\n\nElevated slaughter typically leads to a period of low output as producers hold back animals to breed and rebuild herds. But productivity gains in Brazil ‌may limit or even prevent a downturn, people in the industry say. They noted that farms have been inseminating cattle quicker, fattening them faster and slaughtering them younger.\n\n\"Ten years ago, the average age of cattle slaughtered in Brazil was five years,\" said Vinicius Barbosa, a commercial manager responsible for tens of thousands of cattle at the CMA feedlot in Barretos, about 260 miles (420 km) north of Sao Paulo. \"Now it is 36 months and going rapidly to 24,\" he said.\n\nMauricio Nogueira, head of livestock consultancy Athenagro, said Brazilian beef production far surpassed his forecast in 2025. Output grew 4% for the year, where he had predicted a 2.7% drop. The increase of around 800,000 tons was about equal to total annual exports of ⁠Argentina, the world's No. 5 beef shipper.\n\nRabobank, which had expected Brazil's beef production ‌to decline in 2025, now sees 0.5% growth to 12.5 million tons carcass weight equivalent. The U.S. Department of Agriculture in December raised its estimate for Brazilian beef output by 450,000 tons to 12.35 million tons.\n\nIf the official numbers confirm market estimates, 2025 will be the first year that Brazil's output will have surpassed U.S. production, which fell 3.9% ‍to 11.8 million tons in 2025, according to USDA estimates, following years of drought.\n\nFEEDLOTS, RISING CARCASS WEIGHT DRIVE OUTPUT\n\nU.S. beef production will fall a further 0.9% to 11.7 million tons in 2026, the USDA said. In Brazil, the USDA and Rabobank project a decline in output, but Nogueira said rising productivity could actually boost Brazil's production by around 300,000 tons.",

    "fullText": "The Fallout show arrives in New Vegas in a shocking episode.\n\n on January 7, 2026 at 12:00AM PST\n\nSpoilers for this week's episode of Fallout to follow.\n\nLast week's episode of Fallout gave longtime fans and new viewers an update on the factions running around in the Mojave Wasteland. From Caesar’s Legion and the divide they had, to the NCR’s loosened grip on the area, to Maximus’ (Aaron Moten) big mistake, there was no shortage of shakeups. As a result, the episode felt as if it sidelined its leads in favor of world building. That’s not the case with this week’s entry, however, as we finally see Lucy (Ella Purnell) and Cooper (Walton Goggins) arrive in the long anticipated New Vegas. Let’s dive into what went on in the Mojave Wasteland this week.\n\nThe episode opens with one of the most exciting pre-war flashbacks to be depicted in the series, showing Cooper Howard on the Alaskan front during the liberation of Anchorage from occupying Chinese forces. Him and a squadmate are on a combat patrol sporting West-Tek’s T-45 Power Armor for the first time in combat and things aren’t going as expected. His squadmate’s armor keeps malfunctioning, locking his arm into place. Frustrated, Cooper opts to disobey orders from his commanding officer and sends the soldier back to base to continue his combat patrol alone. This plan backfires, as he’s soon ambushed by a platoon of Chinese soldiers who cause his armor to malfunction and send him straight to the floor. Just as all hope seems lost and they prepare to kill him for his armor, a terrifying roar is let out. Shortly after, a Deathclaw appears and massacres the platoon in gory fashion. The deathclaw examines Cooper and leaves him thinking he’s dead; meanwhile on the radio, his commanding officer lets him know that the liberation of Anchorage was successful.\n\nJumping to the present, we join Maximus in the immediate aftermath of Paladin Xander’s death. Maximus learns that the Brotherhood of Steel has tracked them to Thaddeus’ (Johnny Pemberton) bottling plant. Realizing that the Brotherhood will kill all of the ghoul children if they go inside--and not wanting them to know he killed Xander--Maximus pleads with Thaddeus to get inside Xander’s power armor and pose as him. Realizing that they have no choice and wanting to save the kids, he reluctantly agrees and begins to stumble around in the power armor to start the ruse.\n\nLucy wakes up after being hung on a cross by the Legion and being saved by Cooper. Unaware where she is, she learns that she’s in the NCR remnant camp. As they prepare to head back to their destroyed home of Shady Sands, the NCR informs her that Cooper saved her and asks her about her quest to find her dad and what she will do when she finds him. When she says she plans to bring him to justice,, they tell her about the NCR’s mission of bringing justice back to the wasteland and if she ever needs allies to find them. Realizing they have too much luggage to haul back, they offer her a duffel bag of weapons for her journey. She and Cooper set out for The Strip.\n\nWe get a brief look at the happenings of Vault 33 and their dead waterchip. Crops are dying and water is being desperately rationed. But the “Products of Inbreeding” club have plenty for their social gathering because of a promise made by Overseer Betty (Leslie Uggams), a promise she quickly regrets.\n\nAs they arrive on the outskirts of New Vegas, Lucy begins exhibiting strange symptoms such as heavy breathing and itching. Unaware of what’s happening to her, Cooper informs her that she spent the last two days with Buffout--an in-game steroid known for its addictive properties--hooked into her veins. That’s right, she’s become addicted to drugs. With no idea what to do and no time to sit out a five day withdrawal cycle, Cooper offers her the only thing that will help: more drugs.\n\nMaximus and Thaddeus return to Area 51 with the other members none the wiser. Dane (Xelia Mendes-Jones) confronts Maximus about his actions and how he took off unauthorized with Paladin Xander. This is when Maximus drops the truth nuke and informs Dane that he killed Xander. Shocked, Dane brings up how his actions will start a war with The Commonwealth Brotherhood of Steel. Maximus assures him it won’t come to that point as he plans to kill Elder Cleric Quintus (Michael Cristofer)\n\nElsewhere in the Los Angeles Wasteland, Norm (Moisés Arias) is out exploring with the rest of the inhabitants of Vault 31. One of them reminisces on what she was doing before she entered cryosleep and how she interviewed with Vault-Tec right before. To her, 200 years has only been a week. As he plots their next move Norm is confronted by Ronnie, Bud Askins’ personal assistant, who challenges his leadership. Being so close to Bud, Ronnie reveals that Phase II of the experiment of Vaults 32 and 33 are important but ominously keeps details vague.\n\nVault 32 Overseer Steph (Annabel O’Hagan) meets with Vault 31 Overseer Betty in the inter-vault chambers that connect the two. Betty informs her that without a waterchip, Vault 31 doesn’t have much time left. She pleads with Steph to use their waterchip but is refused unless she can provide Steph with Hank Maclean’s keepsake box. Betty inquires what’s inside but Steph refuses to tell her. Unbeknownst to the both of them, their entire meeting is being spied on by Woody (Zach Cherry).\n\nCooper and Lucy arrive at the entrance of The Strip but something seems off. It’s entirely abandoned, with destroyed securitrons littering the streets. Cooper scouts the area and discovers it is infested by the Kings gang, who have mutated into vicious ghouls. With few options before them, Cooper suggests entering The Strip through Freeside to avoid any conflict. Lucy, high on drugs, grows impatient and shoots a ghoul in the legs alerting the rest of them and a bloody massacre ensues. As she shoots down every last ghoul, she starts to realize she enjoys the violence. Meanwhile, Cooper realizes New Vegas may have fallen, and Lucy notices one of her fingers begins to look discolored.\n\nBack at Area 51, Thaddeus struggles to blend in as Xander due to how little experience he has with power armor. Despite heading to the mess hall to get away from everything, he’s confronted by the leader of the Yosemite chapter who offers to kill Elder Cleric Quintus in exchange for support from The Commonwealth. The leader of the Coronado chapter arrives and offers the same deal, saying his soldiers are at the ready. Unaware of how to handle the situation, Thaddeus begins to have a panic attack inside of his power armor.\n\nElsewhere, Maximus confronts the Elder Cleric and informs him that he killed Xander and pulls a gun on him. When questioned why he would commit such an act, Maximus informs him that he killed Xander because he was going to kill a group of ghoul children. Angered, the Elder Cleric begins ranting about how that goes against the Brotherhood’s code and how their mission is to restore America and the Wasteland to its former glory. He pulls out a pistol and gets into a firefight with Maximus.\n\nDane steals the Cold Fusion relic to prevent it from falling into the wrong hands and chaos ensues when other members of the Brotherhood realize it's gone. The Yosemite leader kills Coronado’s leader and the various chapters of the BoS enter full blown conflict. In the ensuing chaos, Maximus manages to lock the Elder Cleric in the room and meet up with Dane, who gives him the Cold Fusion relic and tells him to get far away from there, Thaddeus joins him and together in the mayhem they manage to flee Area 51\n\nWoody calls out Steph for violating vault safety by meeting with Betty in the inter-vault chambers, pointing out that they should only be used for authorized use. Steph thanks him and says it should be reported to the Overseer, which is herself, so his concerns are immediately tossed aside. While they’re talking, Chet (Dave Register) uncovers a hidden drawer of Steph’s that houses a Canadian ID card that belongs to her, revealing that she is not American.\n\nAs Lucy and Cooper travel further downThe Strip, they notice that the surrounding area is completely abandoned. Lucy wonders where all the people are and Cooper once again suggests they should go to Freeside to learn what happened to New Vegas. The silence is broken as Lucy’s Pip-Boy starts detecting radiation and a vicious roar cuts through the air like a knife. Frozen in their tracks, Lucy and Cooper are mortified at the sight of a massive Deathclaw who has its sights set on them.\n\nAfter last week’s update episode, this week’s Fallout was a remarkable improvement. We finally saw Lucy and Cooper arrive in New Vegas, Brotherhood of Steel reach its breaking point, and a deep look into the happenings of Vaults 32 and 33. Many elements from the games were introduced into the show such as the liberation of Anchorage, Deathclaws, and addiction. There’s no doubt in my mind that the following episodes will have even \n\nGot a news tip or want to contact us directly? Email news@gamespot.com",

    "description": "Market experts say geopolitical conflict is becoming a permanent force impacting commodities pricing, rather than a temporary blip on traders' radars.",
    "fullText": "It might be hard to tell by looking at the stock market, but investors are living in a new era of geopolitical risk.\n\nWhile equity markets have largely shrugged off the latest geopolitical shocks, the last few years of hot and cold wars have rewired commodities. From Ukraine to Venezuela, ongoing and emerging conflicts have impacted everything from oil to gold to copper.\n\n\"Geopolitical risk has always influenced commodity prices, but it is increasingly acting as a persistent pricing factor rather than a transitory shock,\" a team of commodities researchers at Oxford Economics wrote. \"While acute events can still trigger sharp price moves, markets now tend to embed a standing risk premium reflecting ongoing supply-chain fragility, trade fragmentation, and resource nationalism.\"\n\nUltimately, conflict is becoming a permanent pricing mechanism rather than a temporary blip on traders' radars.\n\n\"As a result, geopolitical considerations are more systematically incorporated into pricing, investment decisions, and procurement strategies across many commodity markets, rather than being quickly priced out once an event fades from headlines,\" they added.\n\nMany traders and experts say the start of this new era for commodity markets began in 2022 with Russia's invasion of Ukraine. In nearly four years since then, the world has seen fresh fighting across the Middle East, rising tensions between China and Taiwan, and, most recently, the surprise US raid on Venezuela.\n\nThese episodes have been potent drivers of gold's rapid rally. Investors have flocked to the safe-haven metal as forecasters see the potential for further conflicts through the rest of this decade.\n\nFlare-ups across the Middle East between Israel and Iran and a two-year war between Israel and Hamas have only heightened gold's status as a hedge, while also boosting silver.\n\n\"We're going to have a lot of geopolitical uncertainty,\" said Desmond Lachman, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, an economic policy think tank. \"When you get that, you get movement into precious metals as one of the safe havens. But added to that is the United States reliability as a partner to question is called into question.\"\n\nOil is an outlier in the new era, with prices steadily sliding even as geopolitical forces send investors flocking to other commodities. Crude fell 20% in 2025, with the summer's Israel-Iran conflict only causing a brief jump in the price of Brent.\n\nStill, energy investors are once again being forced to digest the potential for new conflicts to impact the market, mulling the potential for the US takeover of Venezuela to increase supply down the road.\n\nJeff Le, a managing principal at consulting firm 100 Mile Strategies, agrees that a new era has arrived for commodities.\n\nSpeaking with Business Insider, he highlighted how quickly the landscape appears to be shifting, pointing to rising prices not just of precious metals but of industrials as well.\n\n\"The surge of industrial metals over the last year, including gold to over $4,000 represents gains not seen in over four decades,\" he told Business Insider. \"This rush could be representative of a new chapter of the commodities market.\"\n\nBoth Le and Lachman noted the possibility of the US' action in Venezuela setting a new precedent for geopolitical action, highlighting its importance as a driving force for commodities.\n\n\"The Trump administration and growing global tensions appear to be more of a feature than a bug,\" Le noted. \"With three more years to follow, it's possible that geopolitical risk is not only a permanent consideration in the commodities market but a more important weight to investors.\"",

    "description": "EY's innovation executive says adaptability is key for job security. He says continuing to learn and apply your new skills is key.",
    "fullText": "While you may not be able to outrun AI, you can move with it.\n\nWith AI transforming so many jobs, EY's Joe Depa says adaptability will be the \"new job security\" in 2026.\n\n\"The ability to adapt and change is going to be the most important component,\" said Depa, who oversees innovation at the Big Four consulting firm.\n\nThe executive, who leads EY's AI, data, and innovation strategies, told Business Insider that training and upskilling will be the factors that differentiate talent and organizations in the workforce.\n\nHe shared three ways he stays current amid rapid changes:\n\nWhether by pursuing a formal education or independent studies, Depa said that ongoing learning is key to staying up-to-date.\n\nDepa said he went back to school to get his Master's in Analytics from Georgia Tech just a few years ago to learn more about software development, programming, and data science. He said he knew he would be managing data scientists and programmers, and wanted to better understand their perspective. However, since earning his degree in 2020, software development has \"completely changed.\"\n\n\"You've got to always be learning and challenging yourself to learn every single day,\" Depa said.\n\nTo stay current on topics like AI, he said he listens to podcasts and reads articles about the latest news.\n\nDepa isn't the only leader who carves out regular time for learning new things. Visa's Oliver Jenkyn recently told Business Insider that he blocks off four hours a week to study a topic he wants to understand, like the technology of stablecoins or the history of the semiconductor industry.\n\nDepa said that, in addition to allocating time for individual learning, it's \"critical\" to lean on personal mentors.\n\n\"All of us should have our own personal advisors — mentors around us that we can call,\" Depa said.\n\nThe executive pointed to EY's global AI advisory council, which includes 20 top AI leaders who assist the firm in navigating the AI landscape. The council meets and provides feedback on different plans, Depa said.\n\n\"It's a really nice forum for me to test what's coming next,\" Depa said.\n\nThe global chief innovation officer said that having a council of opinions helps him challenge his thinking, but soliciting input from others doesn't have to be so formal. Having relationships with people with who you can check in with to get different perspectives is \"increasingly important,\" he said.\n\nDepa said that while education and learning from others are important, it's necessary to actually implement those teachings. That could mean vibe coding or creating an application.\n\n\"That whole learning experience is going to really help create new brain dynamics for you to learn the next thing and the next thing,\" Depa said.\n\nDepa said failure is a natural part of experimenting with tools and putting new ideas to practice. Getting comfortable with that discomfort, he added, helps build a mindset focused on challenging yourself and learning more.\n\n\"If you do it enough times, your brain will start to appreciate that process of formal learning, having a team of advisors, and then applying it and learning and growing,\" Depa said.\n\nBlackstone CTO John Stecher also emphasized the importance of being hands-on with technology in a recent interview with Business Insider. Stecher said he doesn't always create something \"spectacular,\" but he reserves an hour or two each weekend to experiment, whether that's using Claude to write code that automates his home, or creating a new tool to parse through documents.\n\n\"It's tactile and tangible,\" Stecher said.",

    "fullText": "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang seems like he's not losing sleep over California's proposed wealth tax.\n\nWhen Bloomberg TV's Ed Ludlow asked Huang about California's proposed 5% billionaire wealth tax in an interview that aired on Tuesday, Huang said that the potential levy hasn't crossed his mind once and that he is \"trying to build the future of AI.\"\n\n\"I've got to tell you, I have not even thought about it once,\" Huang told Ludlow. \"We chose to live in Silicon Valley, and whatever taxes they would like to apply, so be it. I'm perfectly fine with it.\"\n\n\"We work in Silicon Valley because that's where the talent pool is,\" Huang added.\n\nHuang is the eighth-wealthiest person in the world according to Forbes, which estimated his net worth at approximately $162.6 billion as of January 6. Most of Huang's wealth comes from his around 3% stake in Nvidia, which just showed off its new Vera Rubin chips at the Consumer Electronics Show.\n\nBased on his net worth as reported by Forbes, a 5% tax on his total wealth would amount to more than $8 billion, to be paid over five years, according to the proposed plan.\n\nThe California wealth tax was proposed by the SEIU-United Healthcare Workers West in order to offset anticipated budget cuts to healthcare, education, and food assistance.\n\nA wealth tax is different from an income tax and is a levy on an individual's entire net worth instead of annual income. The union estimates that the one-time tax will bring in $100 billion over five years for the state and apply to the around 200 billionaires who are residents of California.\n\nThe proposal is still very far from reality and would need 870,000 signatures to even make it to the ballot in November 2026, where it would then be voted on or rejected by California voters.\n\nBillionaires from Palmer Luckey to David Sacks have already voiced their full-throated disapproval.\n\nAccording to filings viewed by Business Insider, Larry Page, the Google cofounder, converted many of his assets from California to Delaware in December to derisk them from the potential wealth tax. His departure meets an end-of-2025 deadline, since the tax, if passed, would only apply to billionaires who are still residents of California on January 1, 2026.\n\nCelebrity attorney Alex Spiro wrote a letter to Gov. Gavin Newsom on behalf of his wealthy clients and warned that they would \"permanently relocate\" if the California billionaire tax comes to pass.\n\nNvidia did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

    "fullText": "Elon Musk says China is on track to outpace every other country in the computing power needed to run AI.\n\nThe Tesla and SpaceX CEO said in an episode of the \"Moonshots with Peter Diamandis\" podcast published Tuesday that \"China's going to have more power than anyone else and probably will have more chips.\"\n\n\"Based on current trends, China will far exceed the rest of the world in AI compute,\" he added.\n\nMusk said China's decisive advantage in the AI race lies in its ability to scale electricity generation. He estimated that China could reach about three times the electricity output of the US by 2026, giving it the capacity to support energy-hungry AI data centers.\n\nElectricity generation is the limiting factor to scaling AI systems, Musk said.\n\n\"People are underestimating the difficulty of bringing electricity online,\" he added.\n\nWhile the US has focused on restricting China's access to advanced semiconductors, Musk suggested those constraints may matter less over time. China will \"figure out the chips,\" he said.\n\nMusk added that diminishing returns at the cutting edge of chip performance might make it easier for China to catch up, even without access to the most advanced designs.\n\nMusk has previously pointed to China as a model in areas beyond AI infrastructure.\n\nIn an episode of the \"People by WTF\" podcast published in November, Musk said he wants to turn his social media platform X into \"WeChat++,\" referencing China's dominant super app.\n\n\"I also like the idea of sort of having a unified app or website or whatever, where you can do anything you want there,\" he said. \"China has this with WeChat.\"\n\nMusk's comments come as energy supply and data infrastructure emerge as key constraints in scaling AI, rather than chips or algorithms.\n\nCompanies worldwide have rushed to build AI data centers, many of which require as much electrical power as small cities.\n\nA report from Goldman Sachs in November said that an electricity shortage could slow US progress in the AI race.\n\n\"As AI demands massive power, a reliable and ample power supply is likely to be a key factor shaping this race, especially because power infrastructure bottlenecks can be slow to solve,\" wrote Goldman's analysts.\n\nThe report added that while pressure on the US power grid is increasing, China has been steadily expanding its energy capacity.\n\n\"We expect China's spare capacity to remain sufficient to accommodate data center power demand growth while supporting demand in other industries,\" the analysts wrote.\n\nIn his annual New Year's address last week, Chinese leader Xi Jinping praised his country's progress in AI in 2025, saying China had \"integrated science and technology deeply with industries, and made a stream of new innovations.\"\n\n\"Many large AI models have been competing in a race to the top, and breakthroughs have been achieved in the research and development of our own chips,\" he said in his speech in Beijing.\n\n\"All this has turned China into one of the economies with the fastest-growing innovation capabilities,\" he added.",

    "fullText": "The Consumer Electronics Show (CES) is often referred to as \"the most powerful tech event in the world,\" bringing together tech companies from around the globe to unveil their latest innovations. The massive event is held across various locations, including the Las Vegas Convention Center, The Venetian, Mandalay Bay, and The Sphere, and is a staple event for both companies vying for recognition and media outlets that cover them. One day into \"Unveiled,\" the media-only prelude to the trade show, I landed on what might be my mantra for my CES 2026 experience.\n\n\"Cool, if true,\" Associate Tech Editor Michelle Ehrhardt had said about a new product booth, summarizing how I felt about the conference as a whole. Since arriving in Las Vegas on Saturday as a skeptical first-time attendee, I have seen cancer-detecting scanners, smart irrigation systems, and more assistive robots than I can count. I have also rolled my eyes at tech-enabled shoe insoles, smart-companion teddy bears, and AI-powered dog leashes. But I have also seen more grounded tech that lives just at the edge of where science fiction and practicality meet: walk-assisting exoskeletons, smart helmets with fall detection and one-touch SOS commands, and assistive mobility tech that can convert any standard wheelchair into an electric one. In short, CES is both chock-full of BS and a glimpse into the future of clever, helpful, and groundbreaking tech.\n\nTech Editor Jake Peterson, Senior Health Editor Beth Skwarecki, Associate Tech Editor Michelle Ehrhardt, and I will be on the ground at CES throughout the week, covering the biggest, coolest, and weirdest tech we can find. We'll also join CNET, PCMag, and others in awarding the Best of CES 2026 awards for a second year in a row. Follow us here and on social media to see what it's like to be at the world's biggest technology trade show, and share with us your thoughts, questions, and what you'd like to see. There's a lot more cool tech to come. If true, of course.\n\n-Jordan Calhoun, Editor in Chief",

For Harry Potter fans, Hogwarts Legacy is one of the best RPGs on the market, and it's largely based on lore from the Wizarding World. So, while it's difficult to get that same exact experience if you're looking to be in the world of Harry Potter, you can find similar gameplay elements and deep lore-rich stories in other games.\nBelow, we'll be listing 17 games that feature some sort of similarity to Hogwarts Legacy. That similarity could come in the form of one specific gameplay feature or an all-encompassing experience that gives you the same thrills as you had when walking the halls of Hogwarts.",

For Harry Potter fans, Hogwarts Legacy is one of the best RPGs on the market, and it's largely based on lore from the Wizarding World. So, while it's difficult to get that same exact experience if you're looking to be in the world of Harry Potter, you can find similar gameplay elements and deep lore-rich stories in other games.\n\nBelow, we'll be listing 17 games that feature some sort of similarity to Hogwarts Legacy. That similarity could come in the form of one specific gameplay feature or an all-encompassing experience that gives you the same thrills as you had when walking the halls of Hogwarts. If you haven't had a chance to pick up Hogwarts Legacy yet, it is available on Nintendo Switch 2.\n\nHogwarts Legacy was embroiled in controversy due to transphobic remarks from Harry Potter author JK Rowling. Although she was not personally involved with its development, she stands to profit from its success. For more, read our in-depth article on how Rowling's comments have impacted the trans community.\n\nThe Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion was one of the more important RPGs ever made due to its revolutionary open world map and quest design, two core pillars of Hogwarts Legacy. While you can still play the original, Oblivion Remastered is a better product in almost every single way. The 2006 masterpiece has been completely remastered, featuring overhauled graphics, character models, dialogue, and mechanics. The core game is still intact, though, as you start your adventure on an epic quest to uncover the mystery of why your emperor was murdered.\n\nAlong the way, you'll encounter five distinct guilds, each with its own questlines, several sprawling cities teeming with life, and an open world that features dozens of unique locations. Also, if you're a fan of the magical combat in Hogwarts Legacy, Oblivion Remastered lets you become a full-blown mage who can use a variety of different magic attacks. It doesn't officially support them, but a collection of Oblivion Remastered mods have also begun to pop up that can further improve the experience.\n\nFanatical and GameSpot are both owned by Fandom.\n\nImmortals Fenyx Rising is an action-adventure game in the mold of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild that places a large emphasis on combat, but still has many qualities that appeal to Hogwarts Legacy fans. You'll get to explore the world right from the start of the game, and when you're not fighting enemies, you can solve a number of challenging puzzles that lead to rewards or other areas within the world. As for combat, you'll get to challenge mythological beasts such as Medusa as well as a plethora of other smaller enemies. The combat in Immortals Fenyx Rising is quite faster than in Hogwarts Legacy, but it's easy to pick up once you understand the controls.\n\nIf the lore and story were your favorite parts about Hogwarts Legacy, then why not hop over to another beloved pop culture franchise? Star Wars Jedi: Survivor is an original story in the Star Wars universe that takes place between the events of the prequel trilogy and the new trilogy movies. It's a sequel to Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, but you don't need to play that game to understand what's happening in Survivor.\n\nThe game continues to follow protagonist Cal Kestis as he attempts to lead a rebellion against the Empire with a band of outlaws. Survivor sees you visit several planets that are somewhat open world and all have different enemies to face, puzzles to solve, and collectibles to find. As you progress, you'll unlock more attack types, including additional Force abilities and lightsaber forms. The combat in Survivor can be fairly difficult, especially against the late-game bosses, but you have plenty of tools at your disposal to take down enemies. For newer video game players, you can simply set the difficulty level to its lowest setting and take in one of the best Star Wars tales told in recent memory.\n\nLA Noire might not be the first game you think of when you think of Hogwarts Legacy. However, the two games have \n\nIf you enjoyed the outskirt areas of Hogwarts Legacy that extended beyond the castle grounds, then Ghost of Tsushima might be right up your alley. This open-world RPG is set in 13th-century Japan during the Mongol invasion and features extremely detailed and beautiful landscapes outside of the war-torn towns and fields. Ghost of Tsushima sees you play as a samurai who's trying to navigate the invasion and protect their island from the Mongols. When you're not actively doing story missions, you can explore a huge world filled with real-life locations that are still standing in Japan today. You'll come across your fair share of enemies while exploring, but the combat in Ghosts of Tsushima is beginner-friendly while still being difficult to master as you unlock more weapons and skills. A sequel, Ghost of Yotei, is on the way in 2025.\n\nThe Horizon series features perhaps the closest games to Hogwarts Legacy. The first game in the series is Horizon Zero Dawn, but you can also play its sequel, Horizon Forbidden West, for an equally thrilling adventure. We recommend playing Zero Dawn first, though, as there's so much lore you need to understand before you can fully appreciate Forbidden West.\n\nIn Horizon Zero Dawn, you play as Aloy, an orphan born in the midst of a post-apocalyptic period in an alternate version of the United States in the 31st century. In this version of the US, man-made machines have taken over the planet, and tribes of hunter-gatherers and warriors try to survive without antagonizing them. Throughout Zero Dawn, you'll uncover the origins of Aloy's story, which is deeply entangled with how this future came to be and what happened to the humans before the machines took over. It's an epic adventure with a huge open world, combat centered around a bow and arrow, and plenty of secrets to discover.\n\nThe Dragon Age franchise is one that Hogwarts Legacy fans should find enjoyable. They're RPGs with an emphasis on narrative elements and exploration through a large, open world. There's also plenty of magic at play, both in combat and with basic mechanics. In The Veilguard, you play as Rook, who's tasked with stopping a pair of corrupt gods who have escaped their imprisonment. At the beginning of the game, you'll be by yourself, but over time, you can recruit a number of companions to join your party and fight alongside you for the duration of the adventure. Magic, an open world, and a mysterious story all make Dragon Age: The Veilguard an enticing option for any Hogwarts fan. You also don't have to play any of the original Dragon Age games to understand the story, so feel free to hop right in regardless of your experience.\n\nSpeaking of a franchise with some deep lore, the Marvel universe is a natural stepping stone for any Hogwarts Legacy player to dive into. While some fantastic Marvel games have been released in the past several years, Spider-Man was the game that marked Marvel's revival in the video game industry. This is an original story for the webbed hero that follows Peter Parker trying to navigate a day job while also being a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. The story starts off relatively slow, but develops into a thriller with all sorts of twists and turns.\n\nThe setting for Marvel's Spider-Man is an open-world New York City, and swinging through its skyscrapers or Central Park is one of the best feelings you can experience in a video game. The swinging mechanics along with the Arkham-style combat are thoroughly crisp, leading you to feel like you really are Spider-Man.\n\nIf puzzles were one of your favorite parts of Hogwarts Legacy, but you still want some exploration, then look no further than The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Breath of the Wild is one of the most celebrated video games of all time, combining a staggeringly massive open world with fantastic puzzles that actually require you to use different parts of your console to solve. Some puzzles can simply be solved using the joysticks on your Switch, while others use the console's gyro controls and both Joy-Cons. The puzzles can be surprisingly difficult to get through, but they might not even be the hardest part of the game.\n\nInstead, the combat and gear degradation systems in Breath of the Wild will likely have you more challenged than the puzzles. Combat can be difficult if you run into a boss or enemy that outlevels you, but even easy fights have the potential to turn difficult if your favorite sword breaks from too much use. While all of this sounds overly challenging, Breath of the Wild allows you to play at your own pace, and players of all skill levels can pick it up and immediately enjoy what it has to offer. An enhanced Switch 2 Edition of Breath of the Wild and its excellent sequel, Tears of the Kingdom, are out now and boast some very nice upgrades.\n\nNow, your first thought when you see a game like Baldur's Gate 3 might be that you're not a fan of turn-based combat. After all, if you liked Hogwarts Legacy, going from fast-paced wand fights to slow, turn-based moves in every encounter could be jarring. However, if you can get past the shift to turn-based combat and really sink your teeth into Baldur's Gate 3, you'll discover why it's considered one of the best RPGs ever made.\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 is an epic tale of your character, who can either be a preset character or completely your design, trying to stop an alien force from taking over an entire continent's minds. The game isn't necessarily open world, as it features distinct zones that are a part of the different story acts, but the zones themselves are very large. Within these zones, you'll be able to pick up new party members, who you can completely control, go on winding side quests that feel like their own mini-story, and explore the beautiful and dangerous landscapes that make up each one of the maps. Baldur's Gate 3 also features cross-play and is fully co-op, so you can partake in the adventure with a friend or two.\n\nThe Assassin's Creed franchise is somewhat divisive, as many fans seem to either love or hate the different styles of games in the series. If you were to pick one to play to scratch your Hogwarts Legacy itch, though, make it Assassin's Creed Odyssey. Set in 400 BC Greece, Odyssey sees you take control of either a male or female protagonist who comes from humble beginnings. However, over the course of the game, you'll take part in a war between Athens and Sparta, command a ship across high seas, and explore perhaps the biggest open-world map on this list. The story in Odyssey has a few different branches that all clash by the end of the 50-hour-plus campaign, and it's one of the most memorable in the Assassin's Creed franchise. Hogwarts Legacy fans should find the combat easy to pick up, and exploration on a much larger scale than they find in the Wizarding World.\n\nFable III is one of the few games on this list that's somewhat difficult to play in 2025. However, if you're subscribed to Game Pass, then you shouldn't have any trouble on Xbox or PC. Fable III is the most recent game in the Fable series, but the next entry, currently known simply as Fable, is coming sometime in 2026. The Fable series is widely beloved in the gaming community thanks to the charm of its characters and gameplay. Fable III specifically sees you embark on a quest to take down an unruly leader and manage the kingdom for the people of your country.\n\nWhile the story in Fable III isn't especially long, it does offer you a plethora of choices to make that drastically impact how the narrative plays out. During your adventure in the main story, you'll come across a slew of combat engagements, which play out in real time and feature melee, ranged, and magic attacks. The combat can be a little clunky in Fable III, but the world and characters will keep you enthralled throughout the entire game.\n\nIf we're recommending games like Hogwarts Legacy, let's go with one of the only other Wizarding World titles on the market that's easily playable in 2025. Lego Harry Potter: Years 1-4 allows you to play through the first four years of the Harry Potter series as Harry himself. You'll get to explore a slimmed-down version of Hogwarts Castle and meet the cast of characters that you know and love. The game doesn't play out exactly like the movies or books, so there will be some different events that take place. Of course, you'll still get to partake in the classic Harry Potter events, such as playing Quidditch, sneaking around after dark, and even battling the Basilisk. Given the Lego nature of these games, they're meant to appeal to a more casual gaming audience, but any Harry Potter fan should find something to enjoy in Years 1-4.\n\nLife is Strange is strictly a game for Hogwarts Legacy players who value the story above anything else. Life is Strange doesn't feature any sort of combat or an open-world map to explore. Instead, the game takes place over a series of episodes that follow Max Caulfield, a high school senior who discovers that she can rewind time. Using this ability, Max tries to save her best friend, but altering the past can come with severe consequences. Your job is to find a way to navigate the pitfalls of time travel to try and get as happy an ending as possible. The story is gripping throughout every episode of Life is Strange, and there is some puzzle-solving along the way.\n\nThe Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is one of the most well-reviewed games ever and easily a top 10 RPG of all time. If the lore and world of Hogwarts Legacy are something that appeals to you, there's arguably no better game to turn to than The Witcher 3. Don't be intimidated by the \"3\" in the title, as it helps to know the lore of the first two games, but it's not imperative whatsoever.\n\nThe Witcher 3 sees you take control of Geralt of Rivia, a monster hunter who possesses unnatural abilities and strengths. Geralt begins the game on the hunt for his adopted daughter, Ciri, as he's having dreams of an undead army called \"The Wild Hunt\" coming for him and Ciri. While this is the premise of the game, The Witcher 3 is so much more than its initial plotline. The game takes you across an incredibly detailed and large open world where quests and new locations are waiting around every corner. The Witcher 3 even features its own card-based minigame, Gwent, which is now a full-fledged game in its own right.\n\nThe Tomb Raider reboot in 2013 kicked off one of the best gaming trilogies of the modern era. Consisting of Tomb Raider, Rise of the Tomb Raider, and Shadow of the Tomb Raider, these games are extremely well-done and provide you with a very similar experience to that of Hogwarts Legacy. You play as Lara Croft, a world explorer who comes from a wealthy family but finds herself constantly embroiled in some controversies with rival explorers. The Tomb Raider games offer fast-paced and stealthy combat, where you can use a variety of weapons, but you'll also be tasked with solving puzzles, or \"tombs,\" as you progress through the story. With a solid mix of combat, storytelling, and puzzles, you should find yourself right at home as a Hogwarts Legacy fan.\n\nIf you want to step into another established franchise with a cast of iconic characters and villains, then look no further than the Batman Arkham trilogy. Consisting of Batman Arkham Asylum, Arkham City, and Arkham Knight, these games revolutionized an entire generation of action-adventure and RPG titles with their \"Arkham-style\" combat. Naturally, you play as Batman in these games, and each title offers a new story for the Caped Crusader. The stories often revolve around the villains of the game, and the second and third titles allow you to explore an open-world Gotham City. While there's crime around every corner in Gotham, there are also puzzles you can solve that are doled out by none other than The Riddler. There's a slice of gameplay for all Hogwarts Legacy fans, but the Arkham games lean more on the side of combat than puzzles.",

    "description": "Fallout 4 continues to be a well-regarded and popular RPG in 2026, but there are plenty of games like it that offer a similar experience or combine some of its best elements. At its core, Fallout 4 is an RPG with that classic Bethesda feel to it. However, it's also a game with several layers that have been separated and expanded upon in other titles.\nSo whether it's the RPG systems, world design, gunplay, or base-building of Fallout 4 that you enjoy, there's a game out there for you to play after you roll credits. Below you'll find the best games that are most like Fallout 4 in one way or the other.",
    "fullText": "on January 6, 2026 at 11:50AM PST\n\nGameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n\nFallout 4 continues to be a well-regarded and popular RPG in 2026, but there are plenty of games like it that offer a similar experience or combine some of its best elements. At its core, Fallout 4 is an RPG with that classic Bethesda feel to it. However, it's also a game with several layers that have been separated and expanded upon in other titles.\n\nSo whether it's the RPG systems, world design, gunplay, or base-building of Fallout 4 that you enjoy, there's a game out there for you to play after you roll credits. Below you'll find the best games that are most like Fallout 4 in one way or the other. If you're more interested in RPGs as a whole, you can check out our list of the best RPGs to play in 2025, or refresh your Fallout experience with the best Fallout 4 mods.\n\nIf you're looking for a game similar to Fallout 4, why not play the RPG by the same developer that preceded it by three years? Skyrim is one of the best-selling RPGs of all time and features plenty of the same gameplay elements and mechanics as the Fallout franchise does. You're given a massive map to explore right from the start, there are several factions to join and complete quests for, and the story can take several twists and turns depending on your choices. Skyrim might be a fantasy game without any guns or grenades, but it still has that classic Bethesda RPG feel to it that's so prevalent in Fallout 4.\n\nFanatical and GameSpot are both owned by Fandom.\n\nWhile Fallout 4 isn't necessarily considered a scary game, there are some parts that can make you jump in your seat a smidge. If you're looking for more of that feeling, then Metro Exodus is the next post-apocalyptic world you want to dive into. Metro Exodus is a first-person shooter that's set in 2023's Russia after a series of devastating nuclear attacks all across the planet. You play as Artyom, a survivor who's trying to establish contact with other survivors, while also trying not to get killed by the newly formed creatures and harsh environment of the Russian wilderness. Metro Exodus features large, open zones, a story that spans one year through different events, and superb, realistic gunplay. The game can be seen as more of a survival/horror experience, but it still has the FPS and open-world elements that all Fallout fans know and love.\n\nAtomfall is a game that takes clear inspiration from the Fallout franchise. It's a first-person shooter set in a post-apocalyptic world where certain technologies have advanced far beyond what we have today. While the start of the game feels like Fallout, as you continue to play through Atomfall, it becomes clear that it has put several different spins on the experience.\n\nFor starters, Atomfall is a survival game that forces you to manage your hunger, thirst, stamina, and health at all times across a map with several large, open zones. Where Atomfall really shines is in its quest design and storytelling. The game offers you several different quest lines to reach the end credits, and you need to decide which quests to complete to achieve the ending that you think is the best.\n\nWe have another Bethesda RPG, and this time it's the game that Bethesda director Todd Howard referred to as \"Fallout in space.\" Starfield captures that Bethesda Fallout feeling across nearly all facets of the game. There's smooth gunplay, booming and interactive cities, several factions that offer complete questlines, and a story that forces you to explore all across a galaxy of planets.\n\nStarfield also offers you the ability to build a base on any planet you want, which is one of the best parts about Fallout 4. In addition to the base building, Starfield also lets you customize your own spaceship. You can deck out your craft with all sorts of different parts that offer pros and cons for exploration, combat, and aesthetics.\n\nIf Starfield is referred to as \"Skyrim, but in space,\" then The Outer Worlds franchise could be referred to as \"Fallout 4, but in space.\" The Outer Worlds isn't developed by Bethesda, but it is developed by Obsidian Entertainment, the studio behind Fallout: New Vegas. In late 2025, we got The Outer Worlds 2, a sequel to the original game that built a terrific world in a faraway and futuristic galaxy. The Outer Worlds 2 builds on its predecessor while keeping the charm of its characters, rewarding loot system, and fantastic map design. The game allows you to take command of a spaceship, recruit a cast of misfits, and make choices that impact the story and world around you as you solve a conspiracy that will have ramifications on the entire galaxy.\n\nMad Max is arguably one of the most underrated games of the last decade. It features an original story set in the post-apocalyptic world of the film franchise, and, as you might expect, places a large emphasis on vehicles and trying to survive the arid climate of the wasteland. You play as Max, who starts the game barely coming out alive after a conflict with the primary antagonist, Scabrous Scrotus. Scrotus takes Max's prized vehicle, the Magnum Opus, and you spend the entire game trying to retrieve the car from his clutches.\n\nMad Max features a huge open world that you'll traverse with different vehicles you acquire throughout your adventure. You can take down enemy camps, run dangerous quests for different characters, and participate in Death Run races to earn special rewards.\n\nDying Light 2 Stay Human is a game that can be seen as one of the closest experiences to Fallout 4 on this list. Of course, that's if Fallout 4 had parkour, slick movement abilities, and zombies instead of ghouls. The main gameplay element that Dying Light 2 focuses on is its parkour, which affects map traversal in almost every single way. You have access to a huge, post-apocalyptic city, and the entire map is set up for parkour moves and abilities. You also need these parkour elements to escape the hundreds of ravenous zombies that only come out during Dying Light 2's frightening nights.\n\nFallout 4 is set in a post-apocalyptic version of Boston, where nuclear war has ravaged the landscape. While Cyberpunk 2077 doesn't feature a post-apocalyptic world, it does feature an alternate version of San Diego that's set 50 years in the future.\n\nWhile the setting of Cyberpunk 2077 is certainly fascinating, it's the backdrop to one of the best RPG experiences on the market. Cyberpunk 2077 offers a highly interactive and content-filled open world that's dazzling to look at, regardless of where you are. The game offers you multiple ways to engage in combat, and you can enhance your preferred playstyle with unlockable skills and craft technological mods to upgrade your character.\n\nThe Last of Us only shares one or two aspects with Fallout 4, but it's still a game that's absolutely worth playing. It begins with a zombie-style outbreak and fast-forwards several years to a post-apocalyptic future. While The Last of Us uses a third-person perspective and features linear gameplay, it also tells one of the most gripping tales in video game history, which has since been turned into a major TV series on HBO. It might not be an open-world RPG like Fallout 4, but the world and story are all the reasons you need to pick it up.\n\nHorizon Zero Dawn takes the post-apocalypse theme and turns it upside down, as the game takes place more than 1,000 years into the future. During this 1,000-year period, man-made machines have taken over the planet after their AI went rogue during humanity's peak in the 21st century. Horizon Zero Dawn offers a huge open world to explore, hours and hours of lore to listen to and read, and engaging combat that mixes in archery, traps, and melee weapons. If you enjoyed Fallout 4 for the design of the Commonwealth or the mystery behind the story, Horizon Zero Dawn is a perfect game to play next.\n\nThe Division 2 is an online tactical shooter that takes place in the war-torn downtown district of Washington, D.C. after a viral outbreak has brought the nation to its knees. Your objective in The Division 2 is to fend off enemy factions trying to take control of the city. To do that, you and a group of real players need to work together to scavenge loot and supplies across an open map that's split up into zones. You can encounter both AI enemies and other players, but some areas are solely designated for PvP fights. The Division 2 features some elements of an RPG, but it's a multiplayer game at its core that requires you to improve your skills and gear, unless you want an enemy team to bulldoze through you.\n\nBioShock might be one of the older titles on this list, but few games can match the overall immersion that it brings to the table. It's set in the underwater city of Rapture, which was created by a man named Andrew Ryan to escape the ever-changing world above the surface. Through the course of the game, you'll explore every inch of the now-ruined city. Along your way, you can attain new powers and abilities, discover secrets about Rapture and its downfall, and fight off some of the most iconic enemies in video game history. BioShock might not have the freedom of Fallout 4, but it has the exact kind of vibe that you want as a fan of the game.\n\nWe're back with another RPG from Obsidian Entertainment. This time it's the studio's most recent entry, Avowed, which is set in a fictional fantasy land that's engulfed in conflict and intrigue. Avowed features four different large open zones that are almost big enough to be their own open world maps. These zones hold dozens of quests to complete, collectibles to find, and hidden locations that could alter how the story plays out if you find them early enough. Perhaps the best part of Avowed is its combat system and skills menu, which allow you to fight enemies using smooth gunplay, crisp melee weapons, or long-range magic spells or guns. It's a fantastic game from top to bottom that feels like a blend of both Fallout and Skyrim.\n\nWhile you might not initially think Borderlands is a lot like Fallout, the franchise has come a long way in the RPG genre. Borderlands 4, the most recent installment, features a large open world that you can explore as you progress the story. Unlike previous games, there are no loading zones between separate maps, so the entire thing is seamless. You also get to interact with a variety of characters, some of whom act as companions, and take on a plethora of side quests and other objectives throughout the world. The looting aspect of Borderlands 4 is different from Fallout, and the gameplay is much faster-paced, but both are terrific RPGs with large worlds to uncover.\n\nProject Zomboid is a survival sandbox game that's unlike many of the single-player experiences included on this list. What might make Project Zomboid enjoyable for a Fallout 4 fan is the open-world exploration and expansive base building elements. The game forces you to deal with swarms of zombies all across the open map, and to fend them off, you need to scrounge for resources that you can use to craft weapons, gear, and other items at your base. While the base-building in Project Zomboid is quite different from Fallout 4, you can make immensely large bases that allow you to sustain yourself in the post-apocalypse.\n\nIf the exploration and story are your favorite parts of Fallout 4, then Mutant Year Zero: Road to Eden is a great addition to your game library. The game is set in a post-human version of Earth where different creatures have risen up to dominate the planet. You control a party of these creatures and can explore a slew of unique environments that all present different challenges. At the heart of Mutant Year Zero is turn-based combat, which is akin to something like XCOM. The combat might throw off FPS fans at first, but after you get used to it, you'll be engaged and start strategizing various ways to win fights by controlling your entire party of mutants.\n\nThe Warhammer 40000 franchise is known for its narrative-driven gameplay and engaging RPGs. Rogue Trader is another RPG that centers around turn-based combat and assembling a party of different characters for you to control. You can recruit a plethora of characters to join you, and each of them have various attacking styles, weapons, and abilities. When you're not in combat, you can explore a large world where the story plays a major role in everything you do. The choices you make throughout the story affect what happens later in the game and your eventual ending. It's an excellent RPG that blends the exploration and narrative parts of Fallout 4 with strategic, turn-based combat.\n\nWe've already mentioned The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, but pound for pound, its predecessor, Oblivion, might be the better overall RPG. While you can still go back and play the original, Bethesda released a fully remastered version of Oblivion at the start of 2025. The remaster is done wonderfully, as bugs have been fixed, graphics have been improved, and quality-of-life updates are live, including the ability to sprint. At its core, though, Oblivion Remastered is the same premier RPG that showcases Bethesda at its best in terms of gameplay design and world-building.",

For a few years after its release, it seemed like every major video game publisher wanted to copy Blizzard's formula (and monthly subscription-based revenue), and MMORPGs became a hot new genre.\n\nUnfortunately, few of the games that chased WoW's success found much of their own. Publishers soured on the genre before too long, resulting in a draught of new MMORPGs over the last decade when compared to other popular game genres (even if many of them, like some of the best survival games or multiplayer shooters, now borrow heavily from MMORPGs). As a result, many of the most popular games MMORPGs today are the same titles that were popular in the early-mid 2000s. Some have existed for decades and require subscriptions to play, even as others have more recently shifted to a free-to-play model.\n\nThere's never been a better time to get lost in a living, breathing online world, something only the best MMORPGs can provide. Below you'll find a list, in no particular order, of some of the top MMORPGs to play in 2026, ranging from tried-and-true classics of the genre to hybrids that combine the best of traditional fantasy-themed MMOs with elements of shooters, space exploration, and more. Some of the games below also happen to be some of the best free-to-play games available.\n\nBlizzard might not have invented the MMORPG, but it certainly popularized it, as it took a genre known for having a steep learning curve and made it more approachable than ever before with streamlined mechanics, punchy combat, instanced dungeons and raids, and its signature level of polish. As a result, WoW is still going strong today and remains one of the best PC MMORPGs to play, having received nine expansions to date (with a 10th on the way). In WoW, players choose a faction--the Alliance or the Horde--as well as a race and class, and from there embark on an adventure to defend the fantasy world of Azeroth from all manner of threats. Each of the game's 13 classes feels distinct, with multiple sub-classes to choose from, and there's an ever-expanding list of fantasy races to play as and customize.\n\nWoW celebrated its 20th anniversary in 2024, as Blizzard kicked-off a three-expansion storyline called The Worldsoul Saga with the release of the game's excellent and approachable The War Within expansion. Blizzard celebrated WoW's big anniversary by dropping some big news as well--after two decades, WoW will finally receive player housing as part of its next expansion, and in a recent preview made clear that unlike in some MMOs, housing in WoW will be available for everyone.\n\nWhile the main version of WoW has continued to evolve over the last 20 years, a large and vocal contingent of fans yearned for the early days of the MMO, before more-recent expansions forever transformed the game's world and Blizzard updated much of its visuals, gameplay, and classes. Blizzard finally listened in 2019 with the release of WoW Classic, a return to the game's earliest, pre-expansion days.\n\nWoW Classic's release proved to be a huge success, and Blizzard now offers multiple different flavors of old-school WoW all under one subscription price, one that also grants access to the modern version of WoW. Players can still check out the 2004-era version of Azeroth (which received new servers to start fresh on in November 2024 for the game's 20th anniversary), or move forward in time and play one of the game's older expansions, like 2010's Cataclysm (soon to be 2012's Mists of Pandaria). There are even seasonal servers, like the still ongoing Season of Discovery, which adds new items, raid content, and class changes to the original version of Blizzard's genre-defining title.\n\nSince the genre's inception, many MMORPGs have featured familiar sword-and-sorcery trappings. It only makes sense then that the granddaddy of the modern fantasy genre, The Lord of the Rings, was a prime candidate to get the MMO treatment following the massive success of WoW. Enter The Lord of the Rings Online, a game that couldn't have come from a more veteran MMORPG team, with developer Turbine having been responsible for MMO classics like 1999's Asheron's Call and its sequel. The Lord of the Rings Online has since changed developers, but its current developer, Standing Stone Games, is composed of many former Turbine developers. Better yet, it still receives new content updates and expansions, with its most recent, Legacy of Morgoth, having arrived in November 2024.\n\nThough very much following in the footsteps of WoW, it fittingly places a much larger emphasis on story than Blizzard's MMO and delivers a painstakingly detailed version of JRR Tolkien's Middle-earth for players to explore and immerse themselves in.\n\nFinal Fantasy is one of the biggest RPG franchises of all time, and as such has not one, but two MMORPGs to its name. Though 2002's Final Fantasy XI is still playable, it's Square Enix's more-recent MMO, Final Fantasy XIV, that has blossomed into one of the best MMORPGs of all time. When it was first released, it was a critical and commercial failure. But several years and many updates later, the game was re-released as Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn, completely reworking many of the original game's systems, story, and structure. Now, Final Fantasy XIV is one of the top MMORPG games today and one of the best PS5 and Xbox MMORPGs available, having long been playable on PlayStation and more recently launching on Xbox Series X|S.\n\nIts flexible job system means players don't need to create a new character every time they want to try a new role, and despite being a MMORPG with a massive shared world to explore, its main story, over-the-top boss battles, and excellent music all deliver on what RPG fans expect from a game sharing the Final Fantasy name. Its latest expansion, Dawntrail, released in July 2024.\n\nFuncom is no stranger to MMORPGs, having previously made titles like Anarchy Online and Age of Conan. The studio's latest foray into the genre is its most ambitious yet, adapting author Frank Herbert's sci-fi Dune saga into a massive survival MMORPG where players battle to survive on the harsh desert world of Arakkis. Dune: Awakening is definitely a survival game first and foremost, with players needing to gather resources, manage their water levels, build shelter, and advance their gear to progress.\n\nHowever, MMO staples like faction reputation, class-skill trees, open-world dungeons, and a massive, ever-changing endgame PvP zone that brings together hundreds of players also firmly make Dune: Awakening a MMORPG. Its unique mix of third-person shooting, melee, and vehicular combat helps to further distinguish it from the many fantasy-themed MMOs on the market, making for an enticing combination of genres, gameplay, and aesthetics. Just keep in mind that getting killed by one of the desert's massive sandworms means losing everything on your character at that moment--the desert claims the weak.\n\nOne of the first big new MMORPGs in years, Amazon's New World made quite a splash when it released in 2021, breaking concurrent player records on Steam. The hype has since died down quite a bit, but New World is still an extremely solid MMORPG that received a major overhaul on PC and launched on consoles in the form of New World: Aeternum in October 2024. In New World: Aeternum, players wash up the mysterious island from which the game takes its name, one that has trapped various civilizations and explorers from throughout human history. From there they join one of three different factions, each with their own idea of what to do with the mystical land they now call home. Instead of classes, players instead can equip two different weapon types, which define what skills can be used and what stats a player may want to strive for when gearing their character.\n\nThe New World: Aeternum update bundled in the game's sole expansion, and in the process significantly reworked much of the game's story and its early-game questing, two of its biggest weaknesses prior to the update. Amazon also recently debuted seasonal servers that change up New World: Aeternum's normal gameplay in major ways, ranging from servers that put a heavy focus on open-world PvP to \"hardcore\" servers with faster progression where the goal is to never die even once.\n\nThe developer behind the Halo series took many of the ideas popularized in MMORPGs like WoW--dungeons, raids, classes, special abilities, color-coated loot--and applied it to a smaller-scale, sci-fi FPS. The result was Destiny and its sequel, Destiny 2. Bungie has proven it's still king when it comes to making a great-feeling shooter, and it never gets old blasting ancient aliens or genocidal robots with all manner of Destiny's 2 powerful Exotic weapons. When combined with the social elements of MMOs like shared worlds to explore, larger-scale public events, and multiplayer dungeons and raids filled with complex puzzles and mechanics, Destiny 2 forms an impressive genre cocktail that can be hard to put down.\n\nEverything Bungie has been building towards for over a decade may have culminated in 2024's The Final Shape expansion, but Destiny 2 is still receiving new updates and expansions, with the new Edge of Fate expansion releasing July 15. Destiny 2 is also widely available, making it both one of the best cross-platform games to play with friends and one of the best PS5 and Xbox MMORPG games out there.\n\nGuild Wars 2 was a breath of fresh air when it released in 2012, and for good reason. It put a new spin on many of the tried-and-true tropes and systems seen in popular MMORPGs like WoW, with an emphasis on open-world content. Combined with its flashy movement, impressive visuals compared to many other MMOs, and engaging combat that combines class skills with unique weapon abilities, Guild Wars 2 still stands out from the competition as one of the top MMORPG games available on PC.\n\nIn 2025, Guild Wars 2 is still regularly receiving new updates and expansions, in part thanks to a recent restructuring of how developer ArenaNet develops new content. Its latest expansion, Janthir Wilds, introduced several new big features, including player housing and the spear weapon-type. Unlike many of the biggest MMORPGs, Guild Wars 2 doesn't require a subscription to play, making it an appealing choice for aspiring MMO players on a budget.\n\nOne of the more popular Korean MMORPGs, Lost Ark came to the West with the help of Amazon Games and quickly set itself apart thanks to its isometric perspective and lack of a box price or mandatory subscription fee. In Lost Ark, players choose a class and then embark on a quest to discover the titular lost Arks scattered throughout the fantasy world of Arkesia. It's a journey that takes players to both huge, story-heavy new continents and to small, one-off islands that are home to some truly fun minigame events, all which players sail to on their own personal boat.\n\nSprinkle in some truly fantastic endgame raids and impressive Monster Hunter-like boss battles, and Lost Ark is well worth playing for those looking for a MMORPG that plays closer to some of the best Diablo-like games than it does WoW, albeit minus the fountains of loot. Three years later, the game is still receiving frequent updates, with a new class, the shapeshifting Wildsoul, debuting in February 2025.\n\nFallout 76 didn't exactly have a smooth start in 2018, with players criticizing it for a laundry list of bugs, performance issues, lack of NPC characters, and more. But Bethesda never gave up on its multiplayer Fallout experiment, and in 2025, Fallout 76 is a great way to experience one of gaming's best RPG universes alongside dozens of other players.\n\nLike traditional Fallout games, players scrounge their way through an apocalyptic wasteland on the hunt for supplies and gear. Unlike single-player entries in the franchise, however, dozens of players in Fallout 76 can team up to fend off waves of Super Mutants, battle massive monsters as part of the game's numerous public events, or even drop nukes on one another. Bethesda added Expeditions to the list of things to do in Fallout 76 back in 2022. These allow players to team up and venture outside the game's Appalachian Wasteland to other scenic locales, like Fallout 3's The Pitt, for dungeon-like missions, further giving the FPS RPG a distinct MMO flavor.\n\nFallout 76 has seen a resurgence in interest thanks to the launch of the TV show adaptation, making this a great time to jump in. Its most recent content update, Gone Fission, added fishing as a new activity, with players able to complete various fishing-themed quests and upgrade their fishing pole to tackle new challenges. For more on the franchise, check out our look at the best Fallout games.\n\nStar Wars: The Old Republic will feel familiar to anyone who has played WoW but is no less worthy a time investment for those looking to dive deeper into the Star Wars universe. Originally developed by BioWare, a studio known for its RPG storytelling, Star Wars: The Old Republic unsurprisingly puts its story front and center, with dialogue wheels, fully voiced characters, and impactful narrative choices that feel right at home in a single-player RPG. It also features unique storylines for each of the game's eight classes, meaning there is plenty of replay value for players who can't make up their mind on which class to play. As much as it emulates WoW in its gameplay, Star Wars: The Old Republic does include features that have yet to come to Blizzard's MMO, including player housing and NPC companions.\n\nThough the game recently changed developers (with some former members of BioWare joining Broadsword, which also oversees classic MMORPGs owned by EA like Ultima Online and Dark Age of Camelot), it still receives new story content and events, making it the top MMORPG game for Star Wars fans and one of the best Star Wars games of all time.\n\nWhile it may still be quite some time until The Elder Scrolls 6, those longing for a return to Tamriel will find plenty to enjoy in The Elder Scrolls Online, which celebrated its 10th anniversary last year. The MMORPG spin on Bethesda's popular RPG series will feel familiar to those who have played single-player entries in the franchise, with the ability to play in first or third-person, NPC companions, various guilds to join, options to steal from NPCs, and more. Players choose an assortment of skills both from their chosen weapon and armor type but also their class in order to make unique builds that can be used to conquer dungeons and raids with other players. Compared to other, more-traditional MMORPGs playable on consoles, its smaller number of skills and easy-to-read user interface make ESO one of the top Xbox and PS5 MMORPG games, even if it sadly doesn't support cross-play or cross-progression across platforms.\n\nIn 2025, developer ZeniMax Online is making some big changes to ESO's content schedule. It's forgoing the yearly expansion model used for almost a decade and instead focusing on smaller, more frequent seasonal updates that will help to deliver on efforts to improve the game across the board. Those efforts include major experiments like Cyrodiil Champions meant to improve the MMO's open-world PvP and a renewed focus on the new and returning player experience. Its current season, Seasons of the Worm Cult, continues the base game's main storyline, while a free update for all players in June added the ability to subclass, allowing for the mixing and matching of abilities from different classes in order to create entirely new playstyles.\n\nIt may not look like much, but Runescape, which is now in its 23rd year and comes in both its slightly-more-modern Runescape 3 form as well as Old School Runescape, is still one of the best MMORPG games of all time. It may be simple by modern standards, but there is a certain joy to be found in its point-and-click gameplay and its monotonous, yet satisfying, crafting skill grind.\n\nLike all great sandbox MMORPGs, Runescape largely leaves players to decide for themselves what interests to pursue, whether it's completing quests, mastering their crafting skills, or player-killing out in the Wilderness. It's one of the few great mobile MMORPG games available, complete with cross-play and cross-progression across platforms. Those who want to get the full Runescape experience will likely want to Jagex recently announced the first new skill in Old School Runescape history, sailing, will be added later in 2025.\n\nFor those who want a little more Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (with a large dose of anime) in their MMORPG, Tower of Fantasy is exactly what the doctor ordered. It shares plenty of DNA with the more-popular (but also largely single-player) Genshin Impact, but distinguishes itself with its shared open world, public events, co-op dungeons and a more sci-fi aesthetic. There's always something to explore, and it's easy to climb any mountain or glide to any distant spot that sparks interest. Similar to Genshin, its character-swapping action combat combined with each character's various elemental affinities keeps Tower of Fantasy's moment-to-moment gameplay interesting, especially as players earn new characters, form teams, and create new combos.\n\nThough players are more than capable of playing through its main story and many of its challenges with the game's various free characters, be warned that this is a gacha game, and many of its best characters will be inaccessible without spending large sums of money on the premium currency used to make luck-of-the-draw pulls.\n\nLike Destiny 2, Warframe isn't what many players would think of when it comes to a traditional MMORPG, but it has so many elements of the genre--shared spaces with large numbers of players, instanced dungeons and raids, high levels of customizability, crafting, guilds, etc.--that it's an MMO in all but name. Warframe has been around for over a decade, and in that time has continued to deliver best-in-class third-person-shooter gameplay alongside game-changing updates that have introduced spaceship combat, large-scale open worlds, and new story content to its sci-fi, cyber-ninja-filled universe.\n\nWith a \"Very Positive\" average user review score after over half a million reviews and counting on Steam, Warframe continues to impress, and features cross-play and cross-progression across PC, iOS, and consoles. It's also available on Nintendo Switch, making it one of the best Switch MMORPG games. A fantasy-themed successor, Soulframe, is slated to receive an open pre-alpha playtest this year.\n\nA top-down fantasy MMORPG that will look and feel familiar to Runescape fans, Albion Online takes its sandbox gameplay even further, with an almost entirely player-run economy, classless combat, and a focus on full-loot PvP with large-scale guild battles over territory. With PvP being such a large part of the endgame, and the high stakes of losing one's items when dying in PvP, Albion Online won't be for everyone.\n\nThere is PvE as well, with dungeons to explore and bosses to slay. For more farming or crafting-minded players, there is also the ability to build a home or even buy a private island and transform it into a farm, too. Few MMORPGs in the modern age truly commit to a sandbox approach like Albion Online, making it more than worth checking out, but those who have no interest in PvP or are easily frustrated by setbacks may want to look elsewhere.\n\nFor those who want to live out a superhero (or villain) fantasy instead of the sword-and-sorcery kind, there's DC Universe Online. Players can create their character, choose from a number of different powers, customize their costume, and then fight alongside iconic DC characters while exploring locations like Gotham City, Metropolis, and Arkham Asylum. DC Universe Online has been going steady for 14 years now and still receives multiple new episodic story updates for free each year. The latest episode, the Lantern Corp-focused Fearful Day, released in May\n\nAll of DCUO's new story content is free, though those with an optional subscription will be able to enjoy more rewards, character slots, and powers to choose from. DCUO isn't the only superhero MMORPG on the block, but its wide availability on both consoles and PC (and cross-play between PlayStation and PC players) does make it an easy choice for this list.\n\nThrone and Liberty's gameplay will instantly feel familiar to anyone who has played an MMORPG in the last two decades, with tab-targeting combat that heavily evokes WoW's gameplay. Where Throne and Liberty differs is in its impressive graphical fidelity, focus on open-world PvP, skills defined by weapon type instead of classes, and the use of players' animal-shapeshifting forms in order to sprint, glide, and swim around its world of Solisium instead of traditional mounts. Though much of its endgame focus is on large guild vs. guild castle sieges, there is still plenty of PvE content as well, including world events and dungeons.\n\nGiven its free-to-play nature, its endgame can become a bit grindy, but those looking for a satisfying MMORPG without a subscription could do much worse than Throne and Liberty. It's also one of the few MMORPGs on consoles, and, unlike other console MMOs like ESO, supports cross-play between platforms. Its first free expansion, Wilds of Talandre, releases in March 2025 and will introduce a new zone to explore, solo dungeons for players to conquer, and a revamp of its weapon mastery system.\n\nKnown for its massive spaceship battles with thousands of players, EVE Online is still one of the best MMORPGs available after two decades on the market. A true sandbox MMO where players are largely left to pursue their own interests--whether that's engaging in PvP battles or starting a trade empire--the entirety of its player base plays on a single server, and the actions its players take leave a lasting impact both on its in-game universe and its bustling player-driven economy.\n\nEven if its actual gameplay isn't quite as exciting as it might sound on paper (get used to looking at lots of menus and going AFK while your ship completes assigned actions), it's the stakes behind each action that give everything in EVE Online's world meaning. EVE Online can certainly be confusing for new players, but for those who stick with it and get involved with its various player-run communities, it's easy to see why the game is still being played 20 years later.\n\nThe original superhero MMO, 2004's City of Heroes, has found new life after having been taken offline by NCSoft in 2012. A fan server called City of Heroes: Homecoming received an official license to operate the game in 2024, and now City of Heroes is once again playable completely for free, with a volunteer team keeping the game running and updated thanks to player donations.\n\nCity of Heroes stands out thanks to its detailed character creator, where players get to choose not only their powers, but their origin story, costume, and even backstory. From there it's up to players to protect Paragon City as a hero or join the forces of villainy on The Rogues Isle, battling foes and joining Supergroups of other players along the way. Though City of Heroes is somewhat dated by today's standards, there is a reason many players have fond memories of their time with the MMO, as it offers a unique experience that can't be found in other games within the genre, even as games like DC Universe Online and Cryptic's spiritual successor, Champions Online, have since looked to follow in City of Heroes' footsteps.\n\nBlack Desert is a highly in-depth MMORPG that places a major emphasis on combat systems and customization. You might have heard that Black Desert has one of the steepest learning curves of any MMO, and that statement wouldn't be inaccurate. There are over a dozen classes to pick from in Black Desert, and each one offers a totally different way of approaching combat. You'll mostly engage in combat with real players and AI enemies, both of which require the utmost precision and lightning-fast reflexes to defeat. However, Black Desert also offers siege combat, allowing you to participate in large-scale wars in PvE or PvP.\n\nIf combat isn't your main interest, Black Desert features a massively open world with a slew of content to explore. You can complete quests, level up a slew of skills, and hunt for new gear. You'll also be able to customize your character in truly staggering ways, as the game has hundreds of clothing and appearance options.\n\nOnce Human isn't your traditional World of Warcraft-type MMORPG, but it's still a massive role-playing game nonetheless. The game starts by you joining a server and going through a tutorial for how its various mechanics work. Then, you'll be on your own in a huge map that features differently-scaled areas. Each area is available for you to venture into from the start, but the enemies in an area will all be at a specific level. To successfully navigate the areas, you need to level up your character by completing main story quests, which mainly involve the same gameplay loop, and jobs for various NPCs at the hub center of each area.\n\nCombat in Once Human involves guns as well as melee and long-range weapons, and all of the weapons in the game can be crafted at your base. Base-building plays a major role in Once Human, as it's how you unlock a majority of the game's usable content and helps to level up your character. When you venture outside your base, though, you'll have to keep your character healthy, as Once Human is also a survival game that has a hunger, thirst, and stamina bar, all of which need to be constantly maintained. It's a unique MMO experience that relies less on multiplayer elements, but other real players are still packed into a server with you.\n\nThe First Descendant is a game that falls somewhere in between a few different genres. However, by definition, it's a massively multiplayer online game that features role-playing elements. At its core, however, The First Descendant is a looter shooter that allows you to team up with other players to complete PvE objectives and defeat bosses. There is no PvP combat, but there's certainly enough content to keep you invested. The looting, which comes from defeating enemies and quests, is mostly RNG, so you'll often have to grind for hours to unlock a piece of content for your character or weapons. The gameplay is extremely enjoyable, though, so you'll often have no quarrel with grinding out gear.\n\nPalia is one of the very few MMORPGs that doesn't feature any sort of combat. Instead, you're placed in a world where you're tasked with building your dream home. Set in a fantasy world, Palia also falls into the life-simulator genre, allowing you to build and create anything your imagination can cook up. Of course, not everything is handed to you, as you'll have to venture out into the world to explore the various towns and other environments. Everywhere in Palia is teeming with life, and you'll even meet other players in the various hub areas, or you can visit them at the home they've built. Palia also offers plenty of lore that you learn as you explore, making it feel like you're a part of a real community.",

    "fullText": "Slovenian Domen Prevc matched his brother's feat 10 years ago by clinching his first Four Hills title after finishing second in the final leg of the prestigious ski-jumping competition on Tuesday.\n\nThe World Cup leader jumped last in the first round on the Bischofshofen large hill but showed no signs of nerves to top the halfway rankings with 138 metres.\n\nA second jump of 138.5m for a combined 299.8 points meant he was nudged into second by last year's Four Hills winner and defending World Cup champion Daniel Tschofenig, who managed 137m and 140.5m for 303.9 in front of cheering home fans in Austria.\n\nThree-times Four Hills champion Ryoyu Kobayashi was third on the night.\n\nPrevc still triumphed over the four events, having won the German legs in Oberstdorf and Garmisch-Partenkirchen as part of seven victories in eight World Cup meets.\n\n\"You feel super blessed, you feel super amazing, super overwhelming,\" he told ARD.\n\n\"I'm super proud of my work, finally things came together at the right moment, at the right time. Winning the Golden Eagle is a childhood dream, a childhood dream that came true. I was dreaming about this moment.\"\n\nHe narrowly lost out to Ren Nikaido in Innsbruck at the weekend to end his hopes of a rare Four Hills clean sweep. Overall Prevc scored 1,195.6 in the Four Hills ahead of Austrian duo Jan Hörl and Stephan Embacher.\n\nThe 26-year-old world champion looks the favourite for Winter Olympic glory in Milan/Cortina next month and is part of the first sibling duo to win ski jumping's famed prize.\n\nDomen's older brother Peter Prevc won the Four Hills in 2016 and there is a further reason for a big party in the Prevc household.\n\nIn the women's World Cup, Domen's sister Nika Prevc wrapped up back-to-back wins in Austria's Villach as she extended her lead in the overall standings - having recently also won the women's Two Nights Tour.\n\nThe 2024 and 2025 World Cup champion edged Austrian Lisa Eder by 0.6 points, with Germany's Agnes Reisch picking up her first podium of the season on the normal hill.\n\nThe next World Cup ski-jumping action for the men is a super team event on the Zakopane large hill in Poland on Saturday, when the women take to the normal hill in Slovenia's Ljubno.",

    "title": "What People Are Getting Wrong This Week: Is the World Ending in 2026?",
    "description": "Let's ring in the New Year with a doomsday prediction!",
    "fullText": "Many people think the world is going to end in 2026. Man people think the world is going to end every year—maybe because the Bible said so, or The Simpsons said so—but this 2026-doomsday prediction seems to have a scientific basis. In a 1960 issue of Science magazine, Austrian scientist and polymath Heinz von Foerster detailed what he called the “Doomsday Equation,” a model he used to calculate the last day of civilization on earth. According to von Foerster (and probably Homer Simpson), The End is coming on Friday, November 13, 2026.\n\nFoerster was not a crank. A pioneer in computer science, artificial intelligence, physics, biophysics, and other academic disciplines, von Foerster worked with the Pentagon, and was named a Guggenheim fellow twice—so he was a respected academic, and kind of a big deal. His Doomsday paper is very real. Here’s a link to it in the November 1960 issue of Science and a screenshot:\n\nThe Doomsday Equation looked at 2,000 years of historical data about how fast the earth’s population grew–-there were 2.7 billion people in 1960—and extrapolated a continually accelerating rate of growth. According to von Foerster, Humanity’s ability to overcome natural checks on population would result in hyperbolic growth—faster-than-exponential—an accelerating curve of population growth which would reach “infinite” on November 13 of this year, at which point there would be no space left on the planet for any more people to be. “Our great-great-grandchildren will not starve to death,” Von Forester said. “They will be squeezed to death.”\n\nSo should we pack it in and prepare for the End Times and death by suffocation? Actually the opposite. Von Foerster’s Doomsday Equation was meant to illustrate the problem of overpopulation, but he wasn’t being entirely serious with the specifics of his prediction; the math works out, but the conclusion is tongue-in-cheek.\n\nSo yes, he was joking—November 13, 2026 will fall on Friday (scary), and it also happens to be Heinz von Foerster's 115th birthday—but he was joking to make a point. In the early 1960s, the population was growing at an alarming rate. The annual growth rate had climbed from roughly 1.7% to 1.9% throughout the 1950s, and by 1963, it had grown to  2.3%. So what happened?\n\nIt turned out Von Foerster had a lot in common with fellow scientist Disco Stu of the Can’t Stop the Learnin’ Disco Academies:\n\nIronically, 1960–1963 was the peak of global growth rates. Von Foerster’s (perhaps sardonic) solution was a control mechanism for population—a “peoplo-stat” where governments would carefully monitor and control the rate of people being born. But thankfully, we didn’t need eugenics-lite to solve the problem—like the best problems, it solved itself.\n\nThe rate of world population growth began slowing, as you can see from this chart from macrotrends.net. and the much feared “population bomb” of the 1960s fizzled out. Increased urbanization meant that people had one child to send to an exclusive nursery school instead of having 10 children to work as farmhands. Better medical care means more children live, so there’s no need to make “spares.” The end result: Population growth slowed through the decades to around 1% in the 2010s. At present, according to the UN, more than half of all countries have negative population growth rates. If these trends continue, the world population will peak in the mid-2080s at around 10.3 billion people and then begin a slow decline.\n\nNovember 13, 2026, will come and go, and chances are very good that you will not starve to death, get hit by an asteroid, or suddenly be crushed under the weight of all these damn people (unless you’re on a subway at rush hour).\n\nAs for overpopulation: The problem isn't that there are too many of us, but too few. We don’t really know what it will mean for the worldwide rate of reproduction to go negative, but it’s likely to mean a lot of 90-year-olds hobbling around and everyone younger trying to figure out how to care for them.  But, like the best problems, it’s far enough in the future that someone else will have to deal with it.",

    "fullText": "PDC Q-School 2026: Storied names survive the early skirmishes originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nFormer World Champion and all round darts legend Steve Beaton has safely navigated the opening minefield at the PDC's Q-School 2026, booking his passage to the final stage after storming into the last 16 on day one. The Bronzed Adonis, still chiselled, still unflustered, still very much alive in the fight, can now exhale. What lies ahead from Thursday onward will be infinitely more punishing – but for now, the popular veteran, who reversed a decision to step off the main tour in 2024, has earned a brief ceasefire.\n\nKeeping him company in the hotel lounge is former World Cup winner John Henderson. The experienced Scot has done exactly what was required, nothing more, nothing less. Job done. Feet up. A couple of days’ rest secured, safe in the knowledge that when the real party starts, it’s always more fun when Hendo is invited.\n\nTHE PDC Q-SCHOOL: How to win a Pro Tour golden ticket\n\nFourteen other hopefuls have joined them in this early sanctuary, all punching their tickets to the final phase with days to spare – a priceless luxury in a week where energy, nerve and sanity are finite resources. They are:\n\nLloyd Walker (ENG), James Howard Jones (ENG), Jamie Kelling (ENG), Damien Grimes (IRE), James Evans-Bradford (ENG), Daniel Ayres (ENG), Killian McCormack (IRE), Jake Eichen (ENG), Joe Croft (ENG), Joseph Heywood (ENG), Paul Lewis (ENG), Charlie Large (ENG), Keelan Kay (ENG) and Jamie Tiley (SCO).\n\nMeanwhile, across the Channel in Germany, the same pattern is emerging. Among the early qualifiers in Kalkar is Brian Raman, the 2022 WDF World Championship quarter-finalist and former PDC Tour Card holder, who will be eyeing a swift return to the professional circuit after falling away at the end of 2024.\n\nStanding alongside him is a name that once sent shockwaves through the elite – Jeffrey de Zwaan. The Black Cobra. Two-time Players Championship winner. Former World Matchplay semi-finalist. Those achievements may sit almost a decade in the rear-view mirror, but at just 29, time has not yet closed its fist. There is still venom left.\n\nCompleting the European batch who earned passage to the final stage on day one: Sietse Lap (NED), Jeffrey Keen (NED), Dennis Van Bergen (NED), Jarno Bottenberg (NED), Jose Justicia (ESP), Gilbert van der Meijden (NED), Michael Hurtz (GER), Michael Van De Ven (NED), Michael De Mayer (BEL), Tomislav Rosandic (CRO), Mitja Gustorf (GER), Kris Mievis (BEL), Jiri Brejcha (CZE) and Luitsen Elzinga (NED).\n\nFor the full stories and \n\nDarts World subscriptions options include Print, Digital and All Access packages, as well as exclusive products and competitions",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump hasn't minced words about the larger message he's trying to send the world with the U.S. military raid to capture Nicolás Maduro and spirit the deposed Venezuelan leader and his wife to the United States to face federal drug trafficking charges.\n\n“American dominance in the Western Hemisphere,\" Trump declared following Maduro's capture, “will never be questioned again.”\n\nIn the days since the audacious raid, Trump and his team have doubled down on the notion that the new focus on American preeminence in the hemisphere is here to stay. He also held up Maduro's capture to make the case to neighbors to get in line or potentially face consequences.\n\nTrump’s rhetoric harkens back to the muscular talk of the late 19th and early 20th centuries when American presidents deployed the military for territorial and resource conquests, including to Cuba, Puerto Rico, Hawaii, Honduras, Panama, Nicaragua, Mexico, Haiti and the Dominican Republic.\n\n“There’s been periods, Vietnam and Iraq, which have evoked questions about a return to American imperialism, but the U.S. leaders’ messages in those periods were cloaked in talk of democracy. The way Trump is talking about it is something we haven’t seen in a very long time.” said Edward Frantz, a historian at the University of Indianapolis.\n\nIn the aftermath of the operation, Trump's tough talk has been been directed at titular allies in Greenland — where he renewed calls for the U.S. to take over the Danish territory for national security reasons — and Mexico. Trump says America's southern neighbor needs to “get their act together” fighting drug cartels.\n\nTrump has also warned that longtime adversary Cuba is “going down” now that Maduro, who has provided deeply discounted oil to the economically isolated government in Havana, has been deposed. And the president has heightened anxiety with Venezuela's neighbor, telling reporters that a military operation in Colombia — the epicenter of global cocaine production — \"sounds good to me.\"\n\nThe Republican president has also said his administration will “run” Venezuela policy and threatened the country's new leader, interim President Delcy Rodríguez, with an outcome worse than Maduro's if she does not “do what’s right.” He's made plain that he expects Caracas to open its vast oil reserves to U.S. energy companies, further igniting speculation about American overreach.\n\n“We’re going to have our very large United States oil companies, the biggest anywhere in the world, go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure — the oil infrastructure — and start making money for the country,” Trump said over the weekend.\n\nThe Venezuela incursion has split Latin America, with Trump‑aligned leaders mostly from the right applauding the ouster, and non‑aligned leaders condemning it on sovereignty grounds. It's sharpened concerns that Trump might actually be serious about his desire to annex Greenland as well.\n\nLeaning on Monroe Doctrine, Trump puts neighbors on edge\n\nDanish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen warned Monday that Trump would mark the undoing of the transatlantic military alliance, NATO, if he attempts to follow through on his assertion that the U.S. “absolutely” needs to take over Greenland for national security reasons. The alliance, which includes the U.S. and Denmark, has been a linchpin of post-World War II security.\n\n“If the United States chooses to attack another NATO country militarily, then everything stops,” Frederiksen told Danish broadcaster TV2.\n\nIn the early part of the 20th century, American leaders repeatedly turned to the Monroe Doctrine, a foundational U.S. foreign policy document authored by the nation's fifth president, which had been aimed at opposing European meddling in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nNow, Trump too is leaning on the doctrine to justify U.S. intervention in Venezuela and threaten action around the hemisphere in the name of protecting the safety and welfare of Americans.\n\n“Trump's rhetoric conjures up images of Teddy Roosevelt and gunboat diplomacy. The rhetoric is a return to a pre-Great War era,” Frantz said, referring to the 26th president's intercessions in unstable Caribbean and Central American economies as well as his backing of Panama's secession from Colombia in the name of the U.S. national interest.\n\nJust weeks before the ouster of Maduro, Trump rolled out a long-awaited National Security Strategy that had some disparate elements that seemed to be at odds with each other.\n\nOn one hand, Trump, who has long eschewed America's role in foreign wars, asserted that the administration would have a “predisposition to non-interventionism.” But the strategy document also made clear that the administration would push “to restore American preeminence in the Western Hemisphere.”\n\nWith the ouster of Maduro, the administration has clearly doubled down on the latter.\n\n“This is the Western Hemisphere,\" Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in an appearance on NBC's “Meet the Press” on Sunday. \"This is where we live — and we’re not going to allow the Western Hemisphere to be a base of operation for adversaries, competitors and rivals of the United States.”\n\nThe capture of Maduro and Trump's rhetoric could certainly be a level-setting moment for global leaders as they consider what may lay ahead in the final three years of Trump's second term.\n\nAt an emergency U.N. Security Council meeting Monday, Colombian Ambassador Leonor Zalabata Torres said the raid in Venezuela was reminiscent of “the worst interference in our area in the past.”\n\n“Democracy cannot be defended or promoted through violence and coercion, and it cannot be superseded, either, by economic interests,” said Zalabata Torres, whose country requested the meeting.\n\nAt the same time, Democrats are questioning whether Trump's actions have created a permission structure for Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has designs of capturing further territory from neighboring Ukraine, and Chinese President Xi Jinping, who has vowed to annex the self-ruled island of Taiwan.\n\n“What the president's done in this case has essentially given Putin and Xi Jinping a hall pass,\" said Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, in an appearance on CNN.\n\nThe Russians, for their part, have condemned Trump's action in Venezuela. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia, the country's U.N. envoy, said the world body “cannot allow the United States to proclaim itself as some kind of a supreme judge” to the world.\n\nAP writers Jennifer Peltz and Farnoush Amiri at the United Nations contributed to this report.",

    "fullText": "Former OpenAI employee Daniel Kokotajlo says progress to AGI is ‘somewhat slower’ than first predicted\n\nA leading artificial intelligence expert has rolled back his timeline for AI doom, saying it will take longer than he initially predicted for AI systems to be able to code autonomously and thus speed their own development toward superintelligence.\n\nDaniel Kokotajlo, a former employee of OpenAI, sparked an energetic debate in April by releasing AI 2027, a scenario that envisions unchecked AI development leading to the creation of a superintelligence, which – after outfoxing world leaders – destroys humanity.\n\nThe scenario rapidly won admirers and detractors. The US vice-president, JD Vance, appeared to reference AI 2027 in an interview last May when discussing the US’s artificial intelligence arms race with China. Gary Marcus, an emeritus professor of neuroscience at New York University, called the piece a “work of fiction” and various of its conclusions “pure science fiction mumbo jumbo”.\n\nTimelines for transformative artificial intelligence – sometimes called AGI (artificial general intelligence), or AI capable of replacing humans at most cognitive tasks – have become a fixture in communities devoted to AI safety. The release of ChatGPT in 2022 vastly accelerated these timelines, with officials and experts predicting the arrival of AGI within decades or years.\n\nKokotajlo and his team named 2027 as the year AI would achieve “fully autonomous coding” although they said that this was a “most likely” guess and some among them had longer timelines. Now, some doubts appear to be surfacing about the imminence of AGI, and whether the term is meaningful in the first place.\n\n“A lot of other people have been pushing their timelines further out in the past year, as they realise how jagged AI performance is,” said Malcolm Murray, an AI risk management expert and one of the authors of the International AI Safety Report.\n\n“For a scenario like AI 2027 to happen, [AI] would need a lot of more practical skills that are useful in real-world complexities. I think people are starting to realise the enormous inertia in the real world that will delay complete societal change.”\n\n“The term AGI made sense from far away, when AI systems were very narrow – playing chess, and playing Go,” said Henry Papadatos, the executive director of the French AI nonprofit SaferAI. “Now we have systems that are quite general already and the term does not mean as much.”\n\nKokotajlo’s AI 2027 relies on the idea that AI agents will fully automate coding and AI R&D by 2027, leading to an “intelligence explosion” in which AI agents create smarter and smarter versions of themselves, and then – in one possible ending – kill all humans by mid-2030 in order to make room for more solar panels and datacentres.\n\nHowever, in their update, Kokotajlo and his co-authors revise their expectations for when AI might be able to code autonomously, putting this as likely to happen in the early 2030s, as opposed to 2027. The new forecast sets 2034 as the new horizon for “superintelligence” and does not contain a guess for when AI may destroy humanity.\n\n“Things seem to be going somewhat slower than the AI 2027 scenario. Our timelines were longer than 2027 when we published and now they are a bit longer still,” wrote Kokotajlo in a post on X.\n\nCreating AIs that can do AI research is still firmly an aim of leading AI companies. The OpenAI CEO, Sam Altman, said in October that having an automated AI researcher by March 2028 was an “internal goal” of his company, but added: “We may totally fail at this goal.”\n\nAndrea Castagna, a Brussels-based AI policy researcher, said there were a number of complexities that dramatic AGI timelines do not address. “The fact that you have a superintelligent computer focused on military activity doesn’t mean you can integrate it into the strategic documents we have compiled for the last 20 years.\n\n“The more we develop AI, the more we see that the world is not science fiction. The world is a lot more complicated than that.”",

    "fullText": "Jensen Huang also announces at CES new, more powerful Vera Rubin chips that will arrive later this year\n\nThe billionaire boss of the chipmaker Nvidia, Jensen Huang, has unveiled new AI technology that he says will help self-driving cars think like humans to navigate more complex situations.\n\nThe world’s most valuable company is to roll out the new technology, Alpamayo, which is designed to help self-driving cars handle tricky situations such as sudden roadworks or unusual driver behaviour on the road, rather than just reacting to previous patterns.\n\nNvidia claims Alpamayo will bring chain-of-thought reasoning to self-driving vehicles, combining what the car sees with language-like reasoning.\n\nIn a speech at the annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, the Nvidia founder and chief executive said: “The ChatGPT moment for physical AI is here, when machines begin to understand, reason and act in the real world. Robotaxis are among the first to benefit.\n\n“Alpamayo brings reasoning to autonomous vehicles, allowing them to think through rare scenarios, drive safely in complex environments and explain their driving decision. It’s the foundation for safe, scalable autonomy.”\n\nNvidia has started producing a driverless car powered by its technology, the Mercedes-Benz CLA, in partnership with the German carmaker. It will be launched in the US in the coming months, followed by Europe and Asia. Huang showed a video of the car driving through San Francisco with a passenger sitting behind the steering wheel, their hands in their lap.\n\n“It drives so naturally because it learned directly from human demonstrators,” Huang said, “but in every single scenario … it tells you what it’s going to do, and it reasons about what it’s about to do.”\n\nHuang also said the company’s next generation of chips was in full production, and they could deliver five times the computing power of the company’s previous products when serving up chatbots and other AI apps.\n\nHe revealed new details about the chips, which will arrive later this year as Nvidia faces increasing competition from rivals as well as its own customers.\n\nThe Vera Rubin platform, made up of six separate Nvidia chips, is expected to debut later this year. The flagship server will contain 72 of the company’s graphics units and 36 of its new central processors.\n\nHuang showed how they could be strung together into “pods” with more than 1,000 Rubin chips and said they could improve the efficiency of generating what are known as “tokens” – the fundamental unit of AI systems – by 10 times.\n\nTo get the new performance results, Huang said the Rubin chips used a proprietary kind of data that the company hopes the wider industry will adopt.\n\nWhile Nvidia still dominates the market for training AI models, it faces far more competition – from traditional rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices as well as customers such as Alphabet’s Google – in delivering the fruits of those products to hundreds of millions of users of chatbots and other technologies.",

    "fullText": "The race to build artificial general intelligence has become one of Silicon Valley's defining obsessions.\n\nHowever, Daniela Amodei, the president and cofounder of Anthropic, suggested that the term itself — a shorthand to describe when machines might reach human-level intelligence — may no longer be a useful way to think about where AI is headed.\n\n\"AGI is such a funny term,\" Amodei told CNBC in a recent interview. \"Many years ago, it was kind of a useful concept to say, 'When will artificial intelligence be as capable as a human?'\"\n\nToday, she said, that framing is breaking down.\n\n\"By some definitions of that, we've already surpassed that,\" Amodei said, pointing to areas like software development, where Anthropic's Claude model can now write code at a level comparable to many professional engineers, including some inside the company.\n\n\"That's crazy,\" she said, noting how quickly those capabilities have advanced.\n\nAt the same time, Amodei said AI systems still fall short in many areas that humans handle with ease, making it hard to declare that machines have reached any clear, universal benchmark for intelligence.\n\n\"Claude still can't do a lot of things that humans can do,\" she said.\n\nThat contradiction is why Amodei believes the concept of AGI itself may be losing relevance.\n\n\"I think maybe the construct itself is now wrong — or maybe not wrong, but just outdated,\" she said.\n\nAmodei's comments come as Anthropic and its rivals pour tens of billions of dollars into increasingly powerful models and data centers, the infrastructure required to run them.\n\nWhile some critics have said that large language models won't lead to true general intelligence without major breakthroughs, Amodei said progress hasn't shown signs of slowing.\n\n\"We don't know,\" she said of what breakthroughs may still be needed. \"Nothing slows down until it does.\"\n\nRather than fixating on a single end-state like AGI, Amodei said the more pressing question is how increasingly capable AI systems are integrated into real organizations — and how fast humans and institutions can adapt.\n\nEven if models continue to improve at a steady pace, she said, adoption can lag due to practical constraints such as change management, procurement, and determining where AI actually adds value.\n\nIn Amodei's view, the future of AI won't hinge on whether it meets a textbook definition of AGI — but on what these systems can do, where they fall short, and how society chooses to deploy them.",

    "description": "AMD CEO Lisa Su says AI will soon need \"10 yottaflops\" of compute — a scale of computing power the world has never built before.",
    "fullText": "AI needs so much computing power that AMD CEO Lisa Su put it in terms of a unit most people have never heard of: the yottaflop.\n\nSu said in her keynote at CES 2026 on Tuesday that the world would need more than \"10 yottaflops\" of compute — a measure of how fast a computer is — over the next five years to keep up with AI's growth.\n\n\"How many of you know what a yottaflop is?\" Su asked the audience. \"Raise your hand, please,\" she added, before quickly explaining the term herself when no one appeared to raise their hand.\n\n\"A yottaflop is a one followed by 24 zeros. So 10 yottaflop flops is 10,000 times more compute than we had in 2022,\" she said.\n\nIn computing, a flop is a single basic math calculation. A computer doing 1 billion calculations per second is equal to a gigaflop. A yottaflop is equivalent to a computer performing one septillion calculations per second.\n\nIn theory, scientists say 10 yottaflops would be enough computing power to run complex, atom-level simulations for entire planets.\n\nIn 2022, global AI compute stood at about one zettaflop — a one followed by 21 zeros. By 2025, Su said, that figure had already surged to more than 100 zettaflops.\n\n\"There's just never, ever been anything like this in the history of computing,\" she said at the Las Vegas conference.\n\nSu's 10 yottaflop prediction is about 5.6 million times faster than the most powerful supercomputer today — the US Department of Energy's El Capitan.\n\nHowever, powering today's AI compute is already putting a strain on the US power grid. The build-out of energy infrastructure would be a big bottleneck in scaling up AI compute power.\n\nDuring the keynote, Su also used the stage to unveil AMD's next generation of AI chips, including its MI455 GPU, as the company pushes deeper into supplying data-center hardware for customers such as OpenAI.",

    "fullText": "Sweden captured its first World Juniors gold in 14 years, and just the third in program history. Two of the key figures were goaltender Love Härenstam and captain Jack Berglund, who once again led the way for his team. When the final horn sounded, the celebration was unrestrained.\n\n“What a group! I’m so impressed with how we come out today. Wow. There’s so much character in this team, I don’t even know what to say. I’m so proud of the guys, and I’m so happy, I’m so happy,” said Jack Berglund to the Swedish TV channel SVT after the game.\n\nBerglund recorded the primary assist on Sweden’s first two goals of the game. In postgame interviews, he was quick to emphasize the team effort and how much the moment meant to him personally.\n\n“You can hardly win anything bigger than this. You grow up with this tournament. To have the honor of wearing the C is huge, and it doesn’t get any better than this. I’m so happy,” he said.\n\nHe continued: “We’ve been talking about this since the summer, and I felt that something good was coming. Everyone has just grown throughout the tournament,” said Jack Berglund to SVT after the final buzzer.\n\nWhen asked what he will remember most, Berglund did not hesitate with his answer.\n\n“It’s the brotherhood. In this group, we’re everything to each other. From the players and coaches to the staff, everyone around us and everyone who has supported us. But above all, it’s this small group. Wow. I have no words,” said Jack Berglund to SVT.\n\nAnother strong performer in the final was goaltender Love Härenstam. Czechia scored two late goals to cut into the lead, but before that Härenstam turned aside several high-danger chances. When the final horn sounded, he was visibly overcome with emotion.\n\n“The best feeling in the world. I’ve never been this happy. So much fun,” said Härenstam to SVT.\n\n“We play really well, and they do a good job six-on-five at the end. Then it’s an incredible feeling when Ivar Stenberg manages to poke the puck in and you can finally let the emotions out. It’s magical!”\n\n“We Deserved That”: Goaltender Love Härenstam After Statement Win Love Härenstam reflected on an emotional New Year’s Eve win as Sweden defeated the United States at the World Juniors.",

    "description": "Chicago Blackhawks Prospect Anton Frondell wins the gold Medal with Team Sweden.",
    "fullText": "The Chicago Blackhawks were excited as an organization when they selected Anton Frondell with the third overall pick in the 2025 NHL Draft. He has since been great as a teenager in the SHL, and now he is complete with the 2025-26 World Junior Championships.\n\nFrondell and Team Sweden won the Gold Medal on Monday night. This is their first Gold Medal at the World Junior Championships since 2012. Every player on the team, including Frondell, played incredibly and deserves this win.\n\nSweden defeated Czechia 4-2 to take the tournament. To get to the final game, they defeated their biggest rival in Team Finland, in a shootout (Frondell scored the winning goal). Along the way, they were great at defending, scoring, and performing on special teams.\n\nThe final three minutes of the 2026 world juniors featured enough chaos for an entire tournament, but in the end, Sweden took gold for the first time since 2012 and just the third time in tourney history. \n\n✍️: @THNRyanKennedy https://t.co/r0Bc0Sxffa\n\n— The Hockey News (@TheHockeyNews) January 6, 2026\n\nOn the Silver Medal-winning Czechia team was Blackhawks draft pick Vaclav Nestrasil. The 2025 25th overall pick had a wonderful tournament as well, including an assist in the Gold Medal Game. Once again, Czechia had a solid showing at this tournament, and Nestrasil was a big part of this one. He finished the tournament with two goals and six assists for eight points in 7 games.\n\nOn the Gold Medal-winning Sweden Team, Frondell was one of their top players. After advancing to the championship, he was named one of the \"3 Best Players on Team Sweden\". Once they won Gold, he was named to the Tournament All-Star Team, along with being called the Top Forward.\n\nFrondell scored a remarkable five goals in the tournament. He also added 3 assists for 8 points in 7 games played. Those stats, his individual awards, and the Gold Medal speak to how successful he was for his country. It won't be long before he is in Chicago's lineup, making an impact.\n\n\"Incredible,\" Frondell said when asked how it felt to win. \"I'm just so happy right now. It's crazy. I love it.\"\n\nThe young players on this team seemed to enjoy each other. Their chemistry and friendship were strong off the ice, which led to success on the ice.\n\n\"This group, it's fantastic how tight we are. We're like a big family.\" Frondell continued. \"It's important if you want to win.\"\n\nChicago did have a third player participating in the tournament. AJ Spellacy and Team USA went out during the quarterfinals. They were defeated in overtime by Team Finland, ending their quest to three-peat at the tournament. Spellacy finished with one goal and three assists for four points in five games.\n\nAhead of the Gold Medal Game, Canada defeated Finland to claim the Bronze Medal. There were no Blackhawks prospects involved in that game, but there was a lot of scouting that took place.\n\nGiven the nature of the up-and-down season that the Chicago Blackhawks are having at the NHL level, it is hard to predict where they will be drafting. However, there were a lot of great young players who showed their stuff throughout the tournament:\n\nGavin McKenna Silences Critics With Four Points In Bronze Medal Win For Canada At The World Junior Championship TSN's director of scouting said it was a \"mixed\" tournament for the top draft prospect, who tied for second among Canadians with 14 points in seven games\n\nWorld Juniors 2026: NHL Draft Eligibles Stenberg, McKenna Highlight Standouts From Medal Day Sweden did it. They're golden at the World Junior Championship for the first time since 2012, with Czechia and Canada completing the podium.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nNick Kyrgios' hopes of playing in the Australian Open are under threat after a first-round defeat at the Brisbane International.\n\nThe 30-year-old was frequently seen wincing and grasping at his elbow during the straight sets defeat to American journeyman Aleksandar Kovacevic 6-3 6-4 on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nIn the early stages of the match, Kyrgios was smiling as he matched the world no.60 but when the American got on top, the mood turned sour with the Aussie looking pained with his right elbow.\n\nKovacevic snared the first set after converting the only break point he created, while Kyrgios didn't get any opportunities on his opponent's serve and only struck four winners to American's 14.\n\nMORE:Novak Djokovic makes shock decision ahead of the Australian Open\n\nIt was relatively even second set also, but Kyrgios gave up a break in the ninth game, before Kovacevic easily served the match out.\n\nKyrgios is relying on getting a wildcard off Tennis Australia to participate at the major, with it clear both parties are waiting to see if he will be fit enough to compete at Melbourne Park.\n\nThe Wimbledon finalist himself admitted he wouldn't accept a wildcard for the Australian Open unless he could compete at a high level.\n\n\"[John] Milliman gave his wildcard up for me when he was injured at the French Open,\" he said prior to the Brisbane International.\n\n\"He wasn't feeling 100 per cent, and that is where everything kicked off for me in my career. After that moment, I became a different player. I learned so much.\n\n\"If I am feeling great and I can get through this week and perform at the Australian Open ... people are paying good money to be there. If I can't give them the Kyrgios experience I would genuinely rather give it to someone that earned the wildcard and is in tip-top shape to start off something special in their career.\"\n\nIt wasn't a good sign for Kyrgios being beaten fairly easily by Kovacevic, who is a 27-year-old journeyman.\n\nIf it was just rust and lack of match fitness, Kyrgios still has time to get his game ready for the Australian Open with an appearance scheduled at the Kooyong Classic.\n\nBut after playing only six professional matches since being struck down with wrist and knee injuries in 2022, it's hard to believe we will ever see Kyrgios at his best again.\n\nThe best of Kyrgios - that we are likely to see again - is on the doubles court with Thanasi Kokkinakis or in the commentary box.",

    "description": "Raich Carter led the Lads to a famous FA Cup final victory in 1937. But Sunderland had another captain — every bit as much a hero as the man whose mural proudly looks down from the Blue House pub in his home town of Hendon.",
    "fullText": "The name Raich Carter is firmly embedded within the lore of Sunderland AFC and the hearts and minds of its followers.\n\nA son of Hendon, he was the local lad come good – a one-goal-every-two-games inside-forward who would lead the club to league and cup glory in the late 1930s and who is still, to this day, one of the youngest-ever captains to lead a side to top-flight English success. Having led the club to the English First Division in 1936 – that is the Premier League in old money for the millennial masses – he was then presented with the prospect of leading the side out at Wembley the following year in the FA Cup Final.\n\nMillwall had been successfully overcome in the semi-final three weeks earlier, with Sunderland showing the resilience to come from behind. The final whistle at Leeds Road, Huddersfield, brought the typical emotions – the elation that comes with success in such settings and, of course, the anticipation of the weeks ahead and the looming date with destiny as Sunderland aspired to return to Wearside laden with silverware.\n\nThe fortitude shown to come from behind would again be evident during English football’s end-of-season showpiece on 1st May as Preston, ahead at half-time, succumbed to the Wearside warriors in the second half, with Raich Carter amongst the goalscorers.\n\nBut Sunderland had another captain in 1937 — every bit as much a hero as the man whose mural proudly looks down from the Blue House pub in his home town of Hendon. Arguably more so.\n\nCaptain Frederick Robinson would have celebrated each FA Cup tie being won as much as anyone, but by the time Sunderland headed to Yorkshire in the hope Wembley was soon to follow, the focus of Captain Robinson, bred in the Barnes area, was on an upcoming journey that had more than memories and medals at stake.\n\nIn an increasingly polarised continent, Europe was coming to terms with the political phenomenon of fascism. Whilst some of its ingredients were hardly novel, the idea of absolutism and othering communities had been adequately packaged and presented with its symbology a nod to Roman history.\n\nThe adherence to such ideology had found allure, with Germany, Italy, and Spain the notable victims as an antithesis to the democratic will of the people became evident. In the latter, Spain, the 1936 election won by the Popular Front was both disputed and dismissed by Franco and his sycophants.\n\nA fascist disputing the electoral endorsement of the people. Wouldn’t happen now, eh…\n\nThe ensuing civil discord, carefully crafted by Franco, brought about the Spanish Civil War and, for the Spanish people, the demise of parliamentary democracy for four decades.\n\nBut some would not stand idly by. Not merely the Spanish people but ordinary decent people beyond Iberian borders.\n\nOne such individual was our very own Frederick Robinson. And by the time Sunderland and Preston were engaged in battle at Wembley he, with others from Sunderland, the wider North-East, and beyond, was the captain of the SS Knitsley as it made its way to Spain to bring aid to the beleaguered Basque people. Despite the trepidation of what lay ahead, on 1st May 1937 the crew of the ship had, temporarily, other matters to focus on.\n\nSunderland, their home-town club, were at Wembley, and for several hours these local heroes, part of what we know now as the International Brigade, were able to use the ship’s radio to keep abreast of how events were unfolding in London.\n\nThey celebrated. Briefly. Before long emotions were balanced and the precarious nature of their mission realised.\n\nSome made it to Spain. Some did not. Some took down aid whilst others took up arms. All to fight on behalf of the poor and disenfranchised. Their humanity and heroism is not diluted by the outcome of the conflict; it lies in their willingness to confront evil and the preparedness to make the final sacrifice if needed.\n\nThey are memorialised across modern Spain, from street name to statue, from plaque to plaza.\n\nThere is, however, no fitting memory or memorial to Captain Robinson and others from Sunderland within Wearside.\n\nIncredibly, if you want to see the inscribed names of those from Sunderland who fought Franco and fascism you have to go to the garden and grounds of Newcastle Civic Centre.\n\nThat, however, is about to change. With the assistance of the community that reared such heroes.\n\nSolidarity Sunderland are in the process of trying to ensure that those who, as the oft-espoused football chant says, were “one of our own” can have their voices heard and story told through a public memorial that accurately reflects their demonstrable opposition to the social disharmony and destruction of political poison.\n\nIf every second Saturday you go to the Stadium of Light to support a footballing International Brigade – all colours, creeds, and nationalities – then surely we can honour the local volunteers who were part of one that had so much more to lose than a football match.\n\nGet involved – your time and input can prove as invaluable as any financial contribution.\n\nFind out more at https://solidaritypark.com/solidarity-sunderland/\n\nPlease contact – solidaritysunderland@gmail.com",

    "description": "Here are the highlights from the world's largest technology trade show happening in Las Vegas, including a new Nvidia chip architecture.",
    "fullText": "The tech scene is starting the year off strong.\n\nOn January 6, the Consumer Electronics Show, the largest and most influential technology trade show, is set to kick off in Las Vegas.\n\nA CES keynote presentation of a new chip from Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang already got the show started.\n\nBased on early announcements, the audience can expect novelties this year like the Sweekar AI pet that physically grows, robots that can bend backwards, and a wallpaper TV that is only 0.35 inches thick. Business Insider's Lloyd Lee is also on the scene to report on the latest autonomous vehicle technologies.\n\nFollow this post over the rest of the week to keep up with the most groundbreaking tech at the 2026 CES.\n\nOn Monday, ahead of the Consumer Electronics Show, Huang officially introduced the Vera Rubin architecture, which is now in production and expected to ramp up in volume in the second half of the year. This move follows a blockbuster year for its Blackwell chip, as demand for AI infrastructure continued to surge.\n\nIn a press briefing ahead of Huang's keynote, Dion Harris, Nvidia's senior director of HPC and AI infrastructure solutions, described Vera Rubin as \"six chips that make one AI supercomputer.\"\n\n\"Vera Rubin is designed to address this fundamental challenge that we have: The amount of computation necessary for AI is skyrocketing,\" Huang told the audience during a presentation at the CES.\n\nHuang added that compared to the Blackwell model, Rubin marks a leap in performance, with more than triple the speed, could run inference five times faster, and can deliver significantly more inference compute per watt of energy.\n\nRubin was first announced in 2024 and has been slated to replace Blackwell ever since. The early debut comes months ahead of the late-2026 timeline Nvidia had previously projected.\n\nNamed after astronomer Vera Rubin, who discovered the existence of dark matter, Nvidia said in a press release that the architecture is designed to support more complex, agent-style AI workloads, as well as more networking and data movement.\n\nThe Rubin systems are already lined up for deployment across much of the cloud industry. Nvidia said partners, including Amazon Web Services, OpenAI, Anthropic, alongside the upcoming Doudna system at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, all plan to use the new platform.\n\nThe accelerated launch comes shortly after Nvidia reported record data center revenue, up 66% from a year earlier, driven largely by demand for Blackwell and Blackwell Ultra GPUs. Those chips have become a benchmark for the current AI boom are widely seen as a test of whether spending on AI infrastructure is sustainable.\n\nHuang has previously estimated that between $3 trillion and $4 trillion could be spent globally on AI infrastructure over the next five years. Nvidia said products and services built on the Rubin platform will begin rolling out from partners in the second half of 2026.\n\nNvidia's Huang also used his presentation to unveil Alpamayo, a new open AI model and toolset designed to bring reasoning to autonomous vehicles.\n\nHuang said that Mercedes-Benz cars powered by the system are already expected to hit the road in the first quarter of 2026.\n\n\"Our vision is that someday, every single car, every single truck, will be autonomous,\" said Huang.\n\nAlpamayo is Nvidia's first full-stack push into self-driving technology, with the goal of using vision-language-action models to handle rare and unfamiliar driving scenarios.\n\nMercedes-Benz CEO Ola Källenius said during the presentation that he recently tested the Nvidia-powered system on public roads and drove for more than an hour through heavy traffic.\n\n\"It feels that the car is on rails. You're just driving, and it does everything,\" Källenius said. \"If you're moving an object that weighs 4,000 pounds at 50 miles an hour, sorry is not going to cut it.\"\n\nBoston Dynamics is teaming up with Google DeepMind to integrate the Gemini AI into its humanoid robot, Atlas, and its robot dog called Spot. Unveiled with Boston Dynamics's parent company, Hyundai Motor Group, at CES on Monday, the partnership aims to let Atlas understand natural-language commands, adapt on the fly, and interact more naturally with people, with the goal of pushing the machine from lab demos into real-world work.\n\nExecutives of Boston Dynamics said in a press release that by embedding a foundation model, Atlas could move beyond preprogrammed actions to navigating unfamiliar environments and identifying and manipulating objects, all of which are core skills for manual labor.\n\n\"Atlas is going to revolutionize the way industry works,\" said CEO Robert Playter in the press release, \"And it marks the first step toward a long-term goal we have dreamed about since we were children—useful robots that can walk into our homes and help make our lives safer, more productive, and more fulfilling.\"",

    "title": "CES 2026: AMD Just Showed Off 'Helios,' the Hardware That Will Power the AI Content in Your Feeds",
    "description": "\"The world's best AI rack.\"",
    "fullText": "When you come across an AI video on Instagram, or watch ChatGPT respond to your query, do you ever think about how that content was generated? Beyond the actual programs and prompts, generative AI takes an enormous amount of compute to support, especially as it skyrockets in popularity. As such, AI companies are looking for more power than ever, which means, of course, turning to those that make the hardware.\n\nDuring a Monday evening keynote, AMD's CEO Dr. Lisa Su showed off the hardware that will soon power everything from ChatGPT to the AI videos overwhelming your feeds. Su introduced \"Helios\" against a backdrop of dramatic music, the company's upcoming AI rack, that packs a staggering amount of computing power into a rack that weighs nearly 7,000 pounds.\n\nEach \"cross-section\" of these racks, if you will, is powered by four key AMD pieces of hardware: The company's new AMD Instinct MI455X GPU, the new AMD EPYC \"Veince\" CPU, the AMD Pensando \"Vulcano\" 800 AI NIC, and the AMD Pensando \"Salina\" 400 DPU. There are some staggering stats here: Helios is capable of 2.9 exaflops of AI compute, and comes with 31 TB of HBM4 memory. It offers 43 TB per second scale out Bandwidth, and is developed with 2nm and 3nm architecture. The rack has 4,600 \"Zen 6\" CPU cores, and 18,000 GPU compute units. In other words, this isn't your average piece of hardware.\n\nSu's pitch is that the AI industry is in need of this additional compute power. She notes how the world used one ZettaFlop of computing power in 2022 on AI technology, compared to 100 ZettaFlops in 2025. (For the curious, one ZettaFlop has a value of 10 to the power of 21.) It's no surprise: AI is everywhere, and many of us are using it—whether we know it or not. Some of us are using it overtly, generating AI videos or running chatbots daily. But others are using AI quietly embedded in functions, like live translation.\n\nSu welcomed reps from OpenAI, maker of ChatGPT, and Luma AI, which creates generative AI video content, to talk about how additional compute helps their programs. But during Luma AI's demonstration of its hyperrealistic video generations, all I could think about was how this type of content is already tricking people into thinking its real, when it's entirely fabricated—not to mention the impact on human artists. AMD is optimistic about AI, and the data centers powering it, but critics have been pushing back, citing concerns with the impacts on the communities companies are building these data centers in.\n\nHelios will likely be a major success for AMD, but it comes at an interesting time for tech, and AI in general. AI is more popular than ever, but it's also more controversial than ever. I see hardware like Helios only fueling the fire in both directions.\n\nIn addition to Helios, Su announced the AMD Ryzen AI 400 series. These newest chips comes with either 12 \"Zen 5\" CPU cores and 24 threads, 16 RDNA 3.5 GPU cores, a 60 TOPS XDNA 2 NPU, and memory speeds of 8,533 MT/s. AMD says the Ryzen AI 400 series is 1.7 times faster at content creation and 1.3 times faster at multitasking whe compared to Intel Core Ultra 9 288V.\n\nThese new chips will ship soon in a number of major PC brands, including Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo, Beelink, Colorful, Gigabyte, LG, Mechrevo, MSI, and NEC.",

    "fullText": "After a heartbreaking loss to Czechia last night, Vancouver Canucks prospect Braeden Cootes and Team Canada have won Bronze at the 2026 IIHF World Junior Championship, taking Finland down by a score of 6–3. This is Canada’s sixth bronze medal at the World Juniors and their 36th overall.\n\nThe past few World Junior Championships have been rough for Canada, as they have been eliminated from gold medal contention by Czechia for the past three straight years. Their last gold medal came in 2023, during which they took down none-other than Czechia to achieve the feat. Prior to this year, this was Canada’s last medal placement. The last time Canada placed third at the World Juniors was in 2012.\n\nThe 2026 World Junior Championship was an interesting one for Cootes, who played predominantly on Canada’s fourth line despite a decent showing at his team’s training camp. In today’s game, Cootes scored his second goal of the tournament and played in a total of 6:21 minutes. He finishes the tournament with two goals, seven shots on goal, and an average of 8:48 minutes played per game.\n\nWith Canada and Finland’s bronze-medal game now wrapped up, fans’ attention will turn to Canucks prospect Wilson Björck and Team Sweden as they take on Czechia for gold. Sweden’s last gold medal game appearance came in 2024, during which they lost 6–2 to Team USA. Canucks players Jonathan Lekkerimäki, Elias Pettersson (D), Tom Willander, Liam Öhgren, and Zeev Buium took part in this game.

    "description": "UN body’s recommendations driven by AI advances and proliferation of consumer-oriented neurotech devices",
    "fullText": "UN body’s recommendations driven by AI advances and proliferation of consumer-oriented neurotech devices\n\nIt is the latest move in a growing international effort to put guardrails around a burgeoning frontier – technologies that harness data from the brain and nervous system.\n\nUnesco has adopted a set of global standards on the ethics of neurotechnology, a field that has been described as “a bit of a wild west”.\n\n“There is no control,” said Unesco’s chief of bioethics, Dafna Feinholz. “We have to inform the people about the risks, the potential benefits, the alternatives, so that people have the possibility to say ‘I accept, or I don’t accept’.”\n\nShe said the new standards were driven by two recent developments in neurotechnology: artificial intelligence (AI), which offers vast possibilities in decoding brain data, and the proliferation of consumer-grade neurotech devices such as earbuds that claim to read brain activity and glasses that track eye movements.\n\nThe standards define a new category of data, “neural data”, and suggest guidelines governing its protection. A list of more than 100 recommendations ranges from rights-based concerns to addressing scenarios that are – at least for now – science fiction, such as companies using neurotechnology to subliminally market to people during their dreams.\n\n“Neurotechnology has the potential to define the next frontier of human progress, but it is not without risks,” said Unesco’s director general, Audrey Azoulay. The new standards would “enshrine the inviolability of the human mind”, she said.\n\nBillions of dollars have poured into neurotech ventures in the past few years, from Sam Altman’s August investment in Merge Labs, a competitor to Elon Musk’s Neuralink, to Meta’s recent unveiling of a wristband that allows users to control their phone or AI Ray-Bans by reading muscle movements in their wrist.\n\nThe wave of investment has brought with it a growing push for regulation. The World Economic Forum released a paper last month calling for a privacy oriented framework, and the US senator Chuck Schumer introduced the Mind Act in September – following the lead of four states that have introduced laws to protect “neural data” since 2024.\n\nAdvocates for neurotech regulation emphasise the importance of safeguarding personal data. Unesco’s standards highlight the need for “mental privacy” and “freedom of thought”.\n\nSceptics, however, say legislative efforts are often driven by dystopian anxieties and risk hampering vital medical advances.\n\n“What’s happening with all this legislation is fear. People are afraid of what this technology is capable of. The idea of neurotech reading people’s minds is scary,” said Kristen Mathews, a lawyer who works on mental privacy issues at the US law firm Cooley.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, neurotechnology has been around for more than 100 years. The electroencephalogram (EEG) was invented in 1924, and the first brain-computer interfaces were developed in the 1970s. The latest wave of investment, however, is driven by advances in AI that make it possible to decode large amounts of data – including, possibly, brainwaves.\n\n“The thing that has enabled this technology to present perceived privacy issues is the introduction of AI,” said Mathews.\n\nSome AI-enabled neurotech advances could be medically transformative, helping treat conditions from Parkinson’s disease to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).\n\nA paper published in Nature this summer described an AI-powered brain-computer interface decoding the speech of a paralysis patient. Other work suggests AI may one day be able to “read” your thoughts – or at least, reconstruct an image if you concentrate on it hard.\n\nThe hype around some of these advances has generated fears that Mathews said were often far removed from the real dangers. The Mind Act, for example, says AI and the “vertical corporate integration” of neurotechnology could lead to “cognitive manipulation” and “erosion of personal autonomy”.\n\n“I’m not aware of any company that’s doing any of this stuff. It’s not going to happen. Maybe two decades from now,” she said.\n\nThe current frontier of neurotechnology lies in improving brain-computer interfaces, which despite recent breakthroughs are in their infancy – and in the proliferation of consumer-oriented devices, which Mathews said could raise privacy concerns, a bugbear of the Unesco standards. She argues, however, that creating the concept of “neural data” is too broad an approach to this issue.\n\n“That’s the type of thing that we would want to address. Monetising, behavioural advertising, using neural data. But the laws that are out there, they’re not getting at the stuff we’re worried about. They’re more amorphous.”",

    "fullText": "U.S. multinational corporations will be exempted from paying more corporate taxes overseas in a deal finalized by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.\n\nThe OECD announced Monday that nearly 150 countries have agreed on the plan, initially crafted in 2021, to stop large global companies from shifting profits to low-tax countries, no matter where they operate in the world.\n\nThe amended version excludes large U.S.-based multinational corporations from the 15% global minimum tax after negotiations between President Donald Trump’s administration and other members of the Group of Seven wealthy nations.\n\nOECD Secretary-General Mathias Cormann said in a statement that the agreement is a “landmark decision in international tax co-operation” and “enhances tax certainty, reduces complexity, and protects tax bases.”\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent called the agreement “a historic victory in preserving U.S. sovereignty and protecting American workers and businesses from extraterritorial overreach.”\n\nThe most recent version of the deal waters down a landmark 2021 agreement that set a minimum global corporate tax of 15%. The idea was to stop multinational corporations, including Apple and Nike, from using accounting and legal maneuvers to shift earnings to low- or no-tax havens.\n\nThose havens are typically places like Bermuda and the Cayman Islands, where the companies actually do little or no business.\n\nFormer Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen was a key driver of the 2021 OECD global tax deal and made the corporate minimum tax one of her top priorities. The plan was widely panned by congressional Republicans who said it would make the U.S. less competitive in a global economy.\n\nThe Trump administration in June re-negotiated the deal when congressional Republicans rolled back a so-called revenge tax provision from Trump’s big tax and spending bill that would have allowed the federal government to impose taxes on companies with foreign owners, as well as on investors from countries judged as charging “unfair foreign taxes” on U.S. companies.\n\nTax transparency groups have criticized the amended OECD plan.\n\n“This deal risks nearly a decade of global progress on corporate taxation only to allow the largest, most profitable American companies to keep parking profits in tax havens,” said Zorka Milin, policy director at the FACT Coalition, a tax transparency nonprofit.\n\nTax watchdogs argue the minimum tax is supposed to halt an international race to the bottom for corporate taxation that has led multinational businesses to book their profits in countries with low tax rates.",

The massive event is held across various locations, including the Las Vegas Convention Center, The Venetian, Mandalay Bay, and The Sphere, and is a staple event for both companies vying for recognition and media outlets that cover them. One day into \"Unveiled,\" the media-only prelude to the trade show, I landed on what might be my mantra for my CES 2026 experience.\n\n\"Cool, if true,\" Associate Tech Editor Michelle Ehrhardt had said about a new product booth, summarizing how I felt about the conference as a whole. Since arriving in Las Vegas on Saturday as a skeptical first-time attendee, I have seen cancer-detecting scanners, smart irrigation systems, and more assistive robots than I can count. I have also rolled my eyes at tech-enabled shoe insoles, smart-companion teddy bears, and AI-powered dog leashes. But I have also seen more grounded tech that lives just at the edge of where science fiction and practicality meet: walk-assisting exoskeletons, smart helmets with fall detection and one-touch SOS commands, and assistive mobility tech that can convert any standard wheelchair into an electric one. In short, CES is both chock-full of BS and a glimpse into the future of clever, helpful, and groundbreaking tech.\n\nTech Editor Jake Peterson, Senior Health Editor Beth Skwarecki, Associate Tech Editor Michelle Ehrhardt, and I will be on the ground at CES throughout the week, covering the biggest, coolest, and weirdest tech we can find. We'll also join CNET, PCMag, and others in awarding the Best of CES 2026 awards for a second year in a row. Follow us here and on social media to see what it's like to be at the world's biggest technology trade show, and share with us your thoughts, questions, and what you'd like to see. There's a lot more cool tech to come. If true, of course.\n\n-Jordan Calhoun, Editor in Chief",

    "description": "McLaren driver Oscar Piastri has revealed he, George Russell and Alex Albon held an “UNO\" World Championship during travel days",
    "fullText": "McLaren driver Oscar Piastri has revealed that he, George Russell and Alex Albon held an \"UNO World Championship\" that took place during travel days between some of the races of the 2025 Formula 1 season. Admitting there were \"questionable rules\" between the trio, he opened up on what he did during his downtime.\n\nTalking on F1's Off The Grid with presenter Lawrence Barretto, the Australian explained that a long-haul flight between races turned from an impromptu game of UNO into something larger.\n\n“You're just chatting, you're sleeping. What’s going on?” Barretto asked about the travel time between races when drivers share flights.\n\n“Myself, George Russell and Alex Albon had an UNO World Championship on the way from Baku to Singapore last year,” Piastri laughed. “There was some questionable rule decisions, and rules that I’d never heard of playing UNO before from some of the others, mainly George.\n\n\"Apparently, they were family rules.\"\n\nBarretto asked whether these rules from the Mercedes driver tipped the scales in his favour.\n\n\"Yes, they did,\" he smiled. \"We’re always competitive at everything, all the drivers. It’s always good fun.”\n\nHis competitiveness predates his career in motorsport. Like many, including seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton, he started with RC racing.\n\n\"Been a competitive person since I was really little,\" he said. \"But channelling that into racing and motorsport...Yeah, started with RC cars, won a national championship at nine and then started racing go-karts a year later.\"\n\nPiastri, like a lot of drivers, lives in Monaco.\n\n\"It's convenient when you want to go and play padel or do other things,\" he said on the subject. \"Also makes travelling to the races convenient. Like I'm sure most people have seen, we often travel to races together and stuff on those plane journeys.\"\n\nHe added: “It's pretty cool to come here when the races are done. It's a bit more relaxed when there's no racing.”\n\nAfter a strong start to his career in F1 and a championship contender for 2025, he has suddenly exploded in popularity - something he's still getting to grips with.\n\n“It is still a little bit strange,” he said. “Obviously at the track you expect the attention, but there has been times where you go in the supermarket or whatever, out of nowhere, someone's asking for a photo or an autograph or whatever, or even just asking, 'is that really you?'”\n\nPiastri will be hoping to continue the momentum he's found in his first three seasons into 2026.\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

    "description": "A look at 10 players who have made a difference at this year's world junior hockey championship in Minnesota.",
    "fullText": "While it was a disappointing tournament for the host Americans, the 2026 world juniors have been a thrill ride for any hockey fan tuning in. Team USA was bounced in the quarterfinal by Finland - in overtime, no less - but the semifinals produced two beguiling games.\n\nSweden punched its ticket to the gold-medal game by besting archrival Finland in a shootout, while the Canadians and Czechs added another chapter to their burgeoning rivalry with a nasty back-and-forth game eventually won 6-4 by the Czechs.\n\nIt has been more than a decade since any country other than Canada, Finland or the U.S. has won gold at the world juniors and that streak now officially ends. With Sweden (2012) and Czechia (2001) both looking for a title after many years, the final game of the tournament promises to hold intrigue.\n\nBut what about the players themselves? There have been some fantastic individual performances in the tournament, so let's take a look at some of the standouts.\n\nLoaned out by the Calgary Flames for the world juniors, Parekh has shown why Canada wanted him for the tournament. Despite being a defenseman, Parekh entered the bronze-medal game tied for the tourney lead in scoring with 11 points in six games.\n\nThe Chicago Blackhawks first-rounder has been a monster for the Swedes and perhaps his most important goal to date came in the semifinal against Finland when he iced the contest with the winning shootout goal. Frondell's shot is a weapon and it has been on full display.\n\nThough the Americans were much weaker than in previous years, Zellers was a very pleasant surprise. The University of North Dakota winger and Boston Bruins pick led the U.S. in scoring with eight points in five games while playing an electric style.\n\nNow the highest-scoring defenseman in Czech world junior history, Galvas continues to add to his totals. Undrafted because of his small stature, he plays a similar game to Lane Hutson and could very well be selected in this summer's draft. Why not take a chance, right?\n\nSlovakia brought a young team to Minnesota and one of the best was 2026 draft prospect Chrenko, whose awesome shot propelled him up the scoring charts. His five goals in five games paced his team and he certainly helped his draft stock.\n\nHeavily scrutinized thanks to his top-prospect status, McKenna nonetheless has been one of the top scorers at the world juniors with 10 points in six games. The potential No. 1 pick in the 2026 draft got in trouble in the Czech game due to some fiery behavior.\n\nAnother top scorer in the tournament, Hage is a Montreal Canadiens first-rounder and a star at the University of Michigan. He made a ton of skilled plays for Canada and his chemistry with McKenna and Brady Martin (Nashville Predators) was something to see.\n\nThe captain of the Swedes, Berglund is a two-way center and a Philadelphia Flyers prospect who has made an impact at both ends of the ice for his team. Should Sweden win gold, Berglund undoubtedly will be part of the winning formula.\n\nA speedster with skill, Saarelainen is a Tampa Bay Lightning prospect who plays back home in Finland in the top pro league. He was very involved in Finland's offense against Sweden and is one to watch in the bronze-medal game against Canada.\n\nA first-round draft prospect for 2026, Bjorck is fast and skilled. He is clearly trusted by Sweden's coaches too, as they sent him over the boards every other shift in overtime against Finland, where he had an amazing four breakaways. While he couldn't convert, he's a talent.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Draft hopefuls and NHL prospects who headlined the world juniors",

    "description": "Scotland will face Haiti in Boston on Sunday 14 June before taking on Morocco and Brazil in the US.",
    "fullText": "A public holiday will mark Scotland's men's national team playing in its first World Cup since 1998.\n\nScotland will face Haiti in Boston at 02:00 GMT on Sunday 14 June, before taking on Morocco and Brazil in their remaining group fixtures in the United States.\n\nFirst Minister John Swinney has proposed that 15 June is designated as a national bank holiday - though the move will only affect staff directly employed by the Scottish government.\n\nLike the St Andrews' Day bank holiday, other employers would not be compelled to observe it.\n\nThe proposal will be formally confirmed once it has been rubber-stamped by the King.\n\nSpeaking at an event in Glasgow, Swinney said: \"The whole nation will come to a standstill in June - even more so in July once we've seen off Brazil and progressed to the knockout stages.\n\n\"This is a moment 28 years in the waiting - and I want as many people as possible to share the occasion.\"\n\nHe added: \"That will mean that supporters across the country can watch our men's team in their first World Cup match for almost 30 years, and share in the chance for Scotland to be on the world stage, to attract business development, to create tourism and hospitality interest within the country and to make deep and lasting cultural and sporting connections.\"\n\nScotland is able to set distinct bank holidays from the rest of the UK.\n\nA day can be appointed as a bank holiday in Scotland by royal proclamation.\n\nThe first minister is able to advise the Privy Council - an advisory board to the monarch - on proclamations for Scotland, which are formally signed off by the King.\n\nScotland face Morocco in Boston on 19 June, and Brazil in Miami on 24 June. Both games kick off at 23:00 GMT.\n\nSwinney has previously said that the government would work with local authorities on extending pub opening hours during the World Cup.\n\nThe Scottish government simply does not have the power to give people across the country - including those working in the private sector or in parts of the public sector controlled by the UK government - an extra, specified day off work.\n\nBut an extra holiday may be a pragmatic response to the situation some businesses may face on the morning after Scotland's opening World Cup game. How many might want to stay up late and then take the day off?\n\nDecisions on whether or not to give staff the day off are for individual employers to take.\n\nIn general, bank or public holidays do not have to be given as paid leave by employers.\n\nAn employer can choose to include bank holidays as part of a worker's statutory annual leave.\n\nEmployment contracts tend to specify that employers have a certain number of days off every year - inclusive of bank holidays.\n\nNor is there any reason why private business would need to close. There are no restrictions on opening hours on bank holidays.\n\nEven the major Scottish high street banks do not close on Scottish bank holidays now - they observe English bank holidays, to stay in line with their sister businesses south of the border.\n\nSchool holidays are already set for the coming year by individual councils. Some may consider whether to look at giving the special bank holiday as a day off, but there are also rules on how many days schools need to open for to consider.\n\n'Scotland qualifying for the World Cup put me in hospital'\n\nScots celebrate reaching first World Cup in nearly 30 years",

    "description": "Jason Lemkin, the founder of SaaStr, the world's largest community of business-to-business executives and founders, is swapping out human workers for AI.",
    "fullText": "Jason Lemkin, known to some as the Godfather of SaaS, says the time has come to push the limits of AI in the workplace.\n\nIn practice, Lemkin, the founder of SaaStr, the world's largest community of business-to-business founders, said on Lenny's Podcast recently that this means he will stop hiring humans in his sales department.\n\nInstead, SaaStr is going all in on agents, which are commonly defined as virtual assistants that can complete tasks autonomously. They break down problems, outline plans, and take action without being prompted by a user.\n\nHe said the company now has 20 AI agents automating tasks once handled by a team of 10 sales development representatives and account executives.\n\nThat move from an entirely human workforce to an agent-based workforce was rapid.\n\nIn May, SaaStr had just one AI agent in production that it used for various digital tasks, Lemkin said. That month, though, during the SaaStr Annual — its yearly gathering of over 10,000 founders, executives, and VCs — two of its high-paid sales representatives abruptly quit.\n\nLemkin said he turned to his chief AI officer and said, \"We're done with hiring humans in sales. We're going to push the limits with agents.\"\n\nLemkin's calculus was that it just wasn't worth the cost of hiring another junior sales representative for a $150,000 a year position who would eventually quit, when he could use a loyal AI agent instead.\n\nAmelia Lerutte, SaaStr's chief AI officer, told Business Insider by email that by June, the company began ramping up the number of agents it had in production.\n\n\"We had only 1 non-core agent at the time with Delphi, but didn't go deep on 2 to 20+ until the beginning of June,\" she said. \"It was a conscious choice after their departure to reallocate some (but not all) head count spend to agents.\"\n\nAt the SaaStr office, the 10 desks that once belonged to humans on the go-to-market team are now labeled with the names of agents, like \"Quali for qualified,\" \"Arty for artisan,\" and \"Repli for Replit,\" Lemkin said.\n\nLemkin said SaaStr is training its agents on its best humans.\n\n\"Train an agent with your best person, and best script, then that agent can start to become a version of your best salesperson,\" he said.\n\nSaaStr's process is similar to how Vercel, the cloud-based platform for developers, trained a sales agent off its top performer for six weeks by documenting every step of their work, and then building an agent to mimic their process.\n\nMany companies are experimenting with AI agents, but risks remain. One of the big ones is the threat of data leaks and cybercrime.\n\n\"AI agents, in order to have their full functionality, in order to be able to access applications, often need to access the operating system or the OS level of the device on which you're running them,\" Harry Farmer, a senior researcher at the Ada Lovelace Institute, recently told Wired.\n\nAll of that access creates more potential attack points for cybercriminals.\n\nSecurity threats aside, Lemkin said that the net productivity of agents is about the same as humans. However, he said, agents are more efficient and can scale — just like software.",

    "description": "Entrepreneurs and tech workers from around the world describe how they navigated the many cloud outages in 2025.",
    "fullText": "November 18 was supposed to be a routine workday for Rwanda-based entrepreneur Derrick Ikenga. But it turned out to be a nightmare he wasn’t prepared for.\n\nCloudflare, a U.S.-based cloud services and cybersecurity firm, faced a massive global outage that day, taking down large parts of the internet, including operations of giants like X (formerly Twitter) and ChatGPT.\n\nIkenga’s company, which builds sales automation tools for clients, also uses Cloudflare. The outage brought the tools to a grinding halt, sending his clients into panic mode.\n\nFor many entrepreneurs and tech workers, this was a familiar experience in 2025. Today, an estimated 94% of enterprise services worldwide rely on at least one major cloud provider, such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud, for hosting, data storage, or delivery. Together, the three largest providers control more than 62% of the global cloud market.\n\nBetween August 2024 and August 2025, AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud together experienced more than 100 service outages. The duration of these outages varied between a few minutes and several hours. AWS saw one of the biggest and most widespread cloud outages of 2025 when its services went down for 15 hours in October. The outage affected over 4 million users and more than 1,000 companies.\n\nWhen an outage occurs, cloud service providers are responsible for restoring services as soon as possible. In some cases, providers compensate affected customers with free cloud credit.\n\nEach time such disruptions occurred, everyday moments began to fail in unexpected ways. Online payments failed. Doctors were unable to access patients’ health records. CCTV cameras went offline. Doorbells stopped working. Smart mattresses lost their sleep-tracking features.\n\nThe outage offered a glimpse into just how deeply cloud infrastructure is woven into modern life, powering everything from bank transfers to flight bookings and movie streams.\n\nRest of World brings together first-person accounts from entrepreneurs and technology workers around the world, tracing what happened when the cloud failed in 2025.\n\nThe quotes have been edited for length and brevity.\n\nFrancisco Osorio, a Mexico-based senior go-to-market marketing engineer at Simetrik, an operational control and management automation company\n\nI couldn’t do anything other than feel helpless.\n\nI am responsible for the smooth functioning of my company’s website, among other things. During the November AWS outage, the website stopped functioning, but I was unable to take any action because I lost access to all my work-related platforms, like HubSpot, Slack, and Salesforce. [Some users of AWS experienced issues on November 5, according to outage tracking website Downdetector.com. An AWS spokesperson denied the claims in comments to Reuters.]\n\nEven as we were sorting through internal issues, our clients also couldn’t log into the platform, which was a more serious concern because we need to comply with service level agreements under which we assure quality and quantity of service.\n\nI couldn’t do anything other than feel helpless. All I could tell everyone around was, “I’m deeply sorry, I cannot help you today. Our platforms are not running.”\n\nSundeep Narwani, India-based co-founder of Narrative Research Labs, a firm focusing on AI in media\n\nBeing an AI company, we’re quite heavily dependent on the cloud. The outages have wasted a lot of time for our clients and us, rendering us helpless in most cases.\n\nThe outages have wasted a lot of our time.\n\nThe first time it happened, we didn’t know what to do or how to deal with it, and we entered panic mode. My biggest concern was on two fronts: downtime disrupting our processes, and our clients being obviously very angry because we deliver a lot of daily reports for them.\n\nWhen it happened the second time, we created a standard operating procedure to deal with it because someone like me, who is involved in business development apart from being the CEO, cannot be available all the time to handle these issues.\n\nWe delegate a project manager to handle issues of cloud outages and ensure our customers are taken care of during such times while finding a quick solution to the downtime.\n\nWe have also purchased a local server to replicate what AWS does, so that if there is any kind of outage again, we have one local server to tide us over. Obviously, it doesn’t have the same kind of performance that AWS gives us, but at least the team can function. But these are just temporary options.\n\nDavid Nandwa, founder of Honeycoin, a Kenyan cross-border payment company\n\nWe have faced cloud outage issues in the past and were also hit with the recent AWS outage in November.\n\nThe approach we have applied to dealing with this is to have a “distributed stack” or multiple fallback options. We rely on multiple clouds, including AWS, Google Cloud, and Heroku. During the recent AWS outage, we temporarily switched to Google Cloud to maintain service availability for most of our customers.\n\nIf all cloud providers are down, we then fall back to using an on-premise server that we’ve created. It doesn’t perform as efficiently as our providers, but it comes in handy in moments where all the major providers are down. It’s locally hosted, so it’s an option to process requests when all else fails.\n\nSubscribing to multiple cloud providers definitely helps us not only to hedge against future risk but also to decrease reliance on a single one, and risk losing our data completely.\n\nHowever, multiple providers mean multiple bills at the end of the month.\n\nThe one-off cost of a single on-premise server installation is something we’re seriously considering to decrease reliance on the large players and also have more digital sovereignty. It’s pretty simple to set up, but it requires a lot of work to move our stack from any of the globally reputable providers to our own direct stack.\n\nOlumide Egbigbola, Nigeria-based product manager at Leatherback, a cross-border payment startup\n\nCompanies like ours can’t do much in such cases.\n\nCloud infrastructure is the backbone of most of the things that we do, as most of our critical services are hosted in the cloud. So any downtime from our cloud provider is immediately felt by our individuals and business users. We face complaints of transaction delays, and the app slowing down or being unresponsive.\n\nThis usually causes a lot of anxiety amongst users who can’t access their money.\n\nCompanies like ours can’t do much in such cases other than inform our users about the downtime.\n\nWe try to spread our cloud services and route traffic through regions that are less affected or unaffected, so that users can at least perform minimal activities while we wait for the major downtime to be over.",

    "fullText": "A Dublin man is leading the construction of the world's largest ever telescope. The Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) is approximately 70% built in the Andes Mountains in Chile.\n\nProfessor Tom Ray is president of the European Southern Observatory (ESO), which is building the telescope.\n\n\"We're talking about a mirror, right, that is 40 metres across,\" he explained on RTÉ's This Week.\n\n\"The dome is the size of the Colosseum in Rome, but actually taller than the Colosseum, but roughly about the same width.\"\n\nThe ELT is due to be completed in 2028 and is expected to cost €1.5 billion.\n\n\"It is enormous compared to anything, any sort of telescope that's been built in the past,\" he said.\n\n\"And with it, it would be possible, for example, to not only image Earth-sized planets around nearby stars, but also to explore their atmosphere.\n\n\"We want to see if there's any signs of life on the planet or whether there's any oxygen, the things that would give rise to life.\"\n\nIreland has been a member of ESO since 2019, Prof Ray said there is a lot of Irish input into the ELT project.\n\n\"The University of Galway, for example, is involved in building what we call an adoptive optics,\" he explained this as using lasers to sharpen the images of stars as seen by telescopes.\n\nIreland becoming more prominent in space exploration\n\nSenior Irish scientists say Ireland is becoming more prominent in space exploration, creating more jobs and opportunities.\n\nIn 2025, Ireland successfully completed its first satellite mission in space.\n\nBelfast-born astronaut Dr Rosemary Coogan became a European Space Agency (ESA) astronaut this year, through UK government funding.\n\nNorah Patten is expected to go into space on a commercial flight in 2027.\n\nIn March 2025, Ireland joined CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research.\n\nAnd scientists in Galway will be among the first to use the ELT when it goes live.\n\nThe scientists are studying a project on exoplanets with Italian scientists, and earlier this year, found the planet WISPIT 2b. It is about 430 light-years away from Earth.\n\nEIRSAT-1: Ireland's first satellite\n\nEIRSAT-1 was launched in January 2023 and burned back into the Earth's atmosphere after successfully completing its mission in September 2025.\n\nProfessor of astronomy, Lorraine Hanlon, director of UCD's Centre for Space Research, led the EIRSAT-1 mission.\n\n\"All of the technology that we created really from our lab to a fully functioning space instrument has been tested,\" Prof Hanlon told RTÉ's This Week.\n\n\"Showing that that technology worked, that we were able to put it together and put a full spacecraft together in our labs tells us that we can actually use this technology not only for small satellites, but we can use it as building blocks for much larger instruments that would be even more powerful in the future.\"\n\nDuring the mission, Prof Hanlon's team in UCD detected 12 gamma-ray bursts as well as several solar flares using the EIRSAT-1.\n\nWe need your consent to load this rte-player contentWe use rte-player to manage extra content that can set cookies on your device and collect data about your activity. Please review their details and accept them to load the content.Manage Preferences\n\nUnlike many ESA member countries, Ireland's does not have its own space agency; instead, Enterprise Ireland runs the country's space programme.\n\nProf Hanon said that Ireland has not necessarily needed a standalone space agency up to now.\n\n\"But I think the case is becoming stronger for some kind of coordinating entity that would oversee education, research through to industry and innovation,\" she said.\n\nIreland's investment in ESA is relatively small compared to other countries; however, it is estimated that the country sees a return of approximately 7:1 on that investment.\n\nFor 2025, Ireland's total contribution to ESA was €26 million. There are at least 116 Irish companies that have a contract with ESA.\n\nMany Irish companies and higher education institutions now have work from membership of organisations such as ESA, ESO and CERN.\n\nProf Hanlon said joining these organisations is worth the membership fees.\n\n\"It means that your scientists are in those collaborations, are defining the experiments that will create the next level of challenge.\n\n\"So, your scientists are defining those problems that need to be addressed.\"\n\nMunster Technological University has already joined a scientific experiment with CERN.\n\nThe ESA is launching the PLATO mission to search for planets around other stars this year, which will include technology from Irish company Réaltra.\n\nAnother Irish company, InnaLabs, has its technology on board another ESA mission called HERA, which will arrive at the Didymos asteroid system in late 2026.\n\nIn UCD, another satellite mission called GIFTS: A 6U CubeSat for the detection and localisation of gamma-ray bursts is currently underway.\n\nAerial, a project with funding from both ESA and ESO, also has Irish involvement.\n\nProf Ray explained: \"What Aerial is doing is looking at a few thousand planets and their atmosphere, but from space.\n\n\"So, we're involved with the constructing of several parts of this and testing them, because they have to be tested at very low temperatures, I'm talking minus 230C because that's what it's like out in space.\"\n\nProf Ray added that Irish scientists are doing \"very innovative work in space\".\n\n\"Our students, our postdocs, people who already have a PhD, are receiving wonderful training from work not only to do with the European Space Agency, but the European Southern Observatory.\n\n\"I've had 30 PhD students and none of them are unemployed. They are immediately snapped up,\" he said.",

    "description": "The oil market was already under pressure before the latest development, with crude futures falling 20% last year.",
    "fullText": "Oil futures fluctuated between gains and losses in the first trading day since the US captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro over the weekend.\n\nUS benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures fell as much as 1.4% in the opening hour of trading before moving sideways. They were 0.5% lower at $57.01 at midnight on Monday.\n\nInternational benchmark Brent crude futures were 0.4% lower at $60.50 a barrel after falling as much as 1.4% in early trade.\n\nThe oil market has been under pressure, with crude prices falling 20% last year. A main issue facing the market is an oversupply of global crude. It's been a focus of OPEC+, which also over the weekend said it will refrain from pumping new oil during the first quarter.\n\nDespite Venezuela's vast oil reserves — estimated at about one-fifth of the global total — the country's output accounts for less than 1% of global daily oil production, reflecting years of aging infrastructure and the impact of sanctions.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, President Donald Trump said on Saturday that US oil companies will invest billions of dollars in Venezuela.\n\nIf Venezuelan oil production does pick up, analysts say it could take time and big money.\n\n\"It will take tens of billions of dollars in investment and at least a decade of Western oil majors committing to the country,\" wrote Peter McNally, the global head of sector analysts at research firm Third Bridge, on Sunday.\n\nMcNally added that there are no swift solutions for Venezuela, where years of underinvestment have eroded infrastructure across the economy, and a severe power crisis continues to disrupt daily life.\n\nAnalysts at Goldman Sachs echoed that view in a Sunday note, writing that \"higher recovery rates of heavy Venezuela oil will likely require financial and time investments in oil-processing upgraders and improvements in operational efficiencies, power availability, and oil transporting infrastructure.\"\n\nVenezuela produced around 3 million barrels a day of oil at its peak in the mid-2000s.\n\nEven before the US captured Maduro, Venezuela's oil exports had already come under pressure after Trump imposed a blockade of sanctioned oil tankers entering or leaving Venezuelan waters last month. The blockade remains in place.\n\nGoldman Sachs said the latest developments increase the likelihood of a shift toward a policy environment more supportive of oil investment, even as short-term changes to oil flows — including both modest increases and further disruptions — remain possible.\n\nThe developments are negative for oil prices over the long run, as any sustained increase in Venezuelan output would add to already ample supply at a time of slowing demand growth, according to Goldman.\n\n\"Production may edge up slightly in the short-run, including in a scenario with a US-supported government and full sanctions relief. Alternatively, disruptions to Venezuela oil deliveries could continue and/or intensify in the short-run, for instance because Maduro's cabinet has asserted its control,\" wrote Goldman's analysts.\n\nGoldman estimates WTI and Brent to average $51 a barrel and $58 a barrel, respectively, should Venezuelan crude production fall by 400,000 barrels a day by the end of 2026.\n\nShould the country's crude production rise by 400,000 barrels a day instead, WTI and Brent are expected to average $50 a barrel and $54 a barrel, respectively, in 2026, the analysts added.",

    "fullText": "Former heavyweight world champion Tyson Fury has announced he will return to boxing in 2026, bringing an end to his latest spell of retirement.\n\nThe 37-year-old Briton last fought in December 2024, when he was beaten for a second time by unified champion Oleksandr Usyk in their heavyweight rematch. Fury confirmed his retirement a month later.\n\nSpeculation over a comeback had grown in recent weeks after Fury shared footage of himself training in Thailand alongside South African boxer Kevin Lerena.\n\nPosting on Instagram on Sunday, Fury said: \"2026 is that year. Return of the Mac. Been away for a while but I'm back now. 37 years old and still punching. Nothing better to do than punch men in the face & get paid for it.\"\n\nFury's return to the ring was widely expected. His most recent retirement was met with scepticism last year, given his history of reversals.\n\nHe previously stepped away from boxing after stopping Dillian Whyte at Wembley Stadium in April 2022, only to return six months later.\n\nQueensberry promoter Frank Warren said he expected Fury to fight again. Saudi Arabia powerbroker Turki Alalshikh had reportedly planned for Fury and long-time rival Anthony Joshua to take separate bouts in the Kingdom early in 2026 before finally meeting later in the year.\n\nJoshua fuelled that possibility after defeating Jake Paul in December, saying he was ready to face Fury next.\n\nThose plans are now uncertain after Joshua was injured in a car crash in Nigeria that claimed the lives of two close friends.\n\nFury enjoyed two reigns as heavyweight champion and boasts a professional record of 34 wins, two defeats - both against Usyk - and one draw with Deontay Wilder.\n\nHe stunned long-reigning champion Wladimir Klitschko in 2015 to claim the WBA (Super), IBF, WBO and The Ring heavyweight titles in Germany.\n\nAfter more than two and a half years away from the ring, during which he addressed mental health struggles, Fury returned in 2018 and regained world champion status by defeating Wilder in 2020 to win the WBC title.\n\nFury has spoken openly about wanting to avenge his defeats by Usyk, who currently holds the WBA (Super), WBC and IBF belts.\n\nThere appears to be limited appetite among fans for a trilogy, while the Ukrainian has indicated he would prefer to defend his titles against Wilder next.\n\nOne potential route to world-title contention could be a domestic clash with Fabio Wardley, the current WBO champion and another fighter promoted by Warren's Queensberry stable.",

    "title": "How the sugar industry bought out scientists for decades",
    "description": "Researchers followed the money, and found out that the sugar industry has been gaslighting the entire world for fifty years. It was code-named \"Project 226.\"",
    "fullText": "According to a report just published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, a delegation from the Sugar Research Foundation paid off Harvard scientists to produce reports that falsely downplayed the role of sugar in coronary heart disease.\n\nYep. Sugar contributes to coronary artery disease, more than we have been led to believe.\n\nReports had linked both dietary sugar and dietary fat to heart disease as early as the mid-50s; by 1960 we knew that low-fat diets high in sugars still resulted in high cholesterol levels. So in 1964, the director of the SRF proposed that the group \"embark on a major program\" to dispute the data as well as any \"negative attitudes toward sugar.\" They found a group of Harvard nutrition scientists who would take their money, and started making plans.\n\nComplete with a codename, Project 226 was designed to protect the interests of the sugar industry by \"recapturing\" the 20% of American calorie intake they expected to lose once this whole sugar-isn't-great-for-your-heart thing percolated through into public awareness. It resulted in a two-part review published in the prestigious and influential New England Journal of Medicine, which hand-waved away huge swathes of research pointing out the risks of dietary sugar.\n\nThe authors went to absurd lengths to discount studies that didn't tell the story the Sugar Research Foundation wanted to tell. For example, to get the results they wanted, they had to throw out all the studies done on animals, because not a single animal study supported the conclusion they wanted. But after they finished their work, they reported that epidemiological studies showed a positive association between high dietary sugar consumption and better heart disease outcomes. The review concluded that there was \"no doubt\" that the only way to avoid heart disease was to reduce saturated fat.\n\nHow did this get past the sanity check at NEJM? The authors were experts, respected in their fields, and they were at least consistent cherry-pickers. They also conveniently failed to report that the Sugar Research Foundation funded their \"study.\" NEJM didn't start requiring authors to report conflicts of interest until 1984, and by then the sugar industry had floated comfortably on their 1964 precedent, funding study after study supporting their pro-sugar narrative \"as a main prop of the industry's defense.\"\n\nCan we finally talk about industry-funded studies? I'm not saying that scientists shouldn't be able to work for private research establishments. Obviously the money to buy the pipettes and reagents has to come from somewhere. But I am saying that there needs to be an unpleasantly bright spotlight on the financial resources enabling the scientific findings cited to support policymaking, whether political or medical. What industry would ever pay to support research that would put it out of business? Whether or not you're in favor of industry self-regulation, no matter whether the research is funded by taxes, commercial revenue, or charitable sources, everyone deserves policies that are made based on the whole truth -- not based on a callously selective interpretation of the facts that ends up lining someone's pockets at the expense of others' health. After how many deaths or lost person-years do the industry payoffs start being blood money?\n\nI for one, as a bench scientist, am mightily tired of hearing about scientists taking money to produce the right conclusion. This is the kind of crap Bill Nye was railing against in his comments that the industry barons who pay off scientists to fit the results to the desired conclusions maybe should be thrown in jail. It's prima facie fraud.\n\nThe peer-reviewed paper in which the scientists make this report is freely available from the JAMA(Opens in a new window), and that's how it ought to be. The only solution to corruption in science is to get more critical eyes on the whole process. There needs to be an independent body of investigative experts accountable to the public, who have to submit to a zealous and hard-hitting inquiry into their financial interests, and who can serve as a sanity check for advisory boards or legislative committees.\n\nWe need a Mythbusters for medical advice: someone who isn't a wholly owned subsidiary of the industry. Someone who can turn on the lights and force the roaches of corruption to scatter. Pay-to-win gaming isn't fair, and people hate it, and pay-to-win science is just as bad. It's about time to start paying the skeptics, because an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.\n\nBut the only way we can do the above is if the science is accessible. How much do you think a subscription to every major scientific journal would cost, even at the discounted academic rate? The EU's Horizon 2020 directive provided hosting and access that made freely available all research funded even in part by EU money -- while the authors retain the right to license, patent or commercialize their work, the peer-reviewed papers reporting their results are now free, as in libre and gratis. When they publish in Nature or wherever, they also have to publish in the European Research Council's public database.\n\nWe should do that in the US, because hosting is cheap. Then maybe we could afford to hire people like Penn and Teller, Adam and Jamie, or Phil Plait and James Randi: people with faces we know and judgment we've checked, people whose stock in trade it is to root out misunderstandings and weasel words. Policy grounded in research needs to be officially subjected to the kind of person who just can't stand it when someone is wrong on the internet. Give us some accountability and tear down this paywall.\n\nResearch: doi:10.1001/jamainternmed.2016.5394",

    "title": "China Stopped Production On The World's Largest Particle Accelerator - Here's Why",
    "description": "China's ambitious new particle accelerator was meant to pick up where the Large Hadron Collider left off, but the project was put on pause. Here's the story.",
    "fullText": "Planned to be the largest particle accelerator in the world, China's Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC) was meant to be about 100 kilometers or 62 miles long. That's much bigger than CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC) with an approximately 27 kilometer circumference – or nearly 17 miles. These systems, especially the LHC, play a huge role in studying how the universe began during the Big Bang.\n\nDevelopment for CEPC started in 2012, around the time CERN discovered the Higgs boson particle; however, it appears the multibillion-dollar project is now paused. It was not included in the country's next five-year plan, spanning 2026 to 2030, which means it's considered a lower priority by the state — it will see less funding and resources. Wang Yifang from the Institute of High Energy Physics confirmed the change, but although the recent proposal to be included in China's five-year plan was denied, the team plans to resubmit the CEPC proposal in 2030.\n\nWhile it hasn't been directly confirmed, the CEPC would cost an estimated $5.1 billion, money that the country might want to divert elsewhere. In that case, Wang says if the European Future Circular Collider (FCC) – the next-generation collider that would effectively be LHC's successor with a much larger 90.7-kilometer (or 56-mile) circumference – is approved before the 2030 proposals, they'll likely join forces with the related teams instead.\n\nTo summarize, China's CEPC is out, likely due to cost and resource requirements, but the European's FCC still has potential, and the Chinese physicist team may join up if the proposal is approved before the next round of China's plans.\n\nDiscoveries from the systems we have operating now, like the Higgs boson discovery at LHC, occur because of how particle accelerators actually work. They fire particles into a big tunnel, or underground rings, which circle around at incredibly fast speeds before colliding. By observing these collisions, scientists get a glimpse into what the early universe looked like, as well as other foundational elements like quarks, the building blocks of visible matter in the universe. Scientists also used the system to create quark soup, a substance that hadn't been seen for billions of years before that. Generally speaking, when two particles collide, for the infinitesimally small span of time afterwards, scientists can see traces or patterns that are otherwise invisible — that's exactly how they discovered the Higgs boson.\n\nThe larger colliders, like CEPC or FCC, would not only introduce larger tunnel systems but more advanced and unique equipment, to uncover heavier or different particles, many of which the LHC simply cannot create. Imagine what kind of alchemy could be achieved with the larger, more capable collider systems.\n\nAs the current system, the LHC is expected to be phased out by the 2040s; meanwhile, the FCC, if approved, will begin development in the 2030s. That said, construction can't start quite that easily: Before anything happens, the CERN Member States and international partners have to give the upgrade project a greenlight.\n\nEnjoyed this article?",

    "fullText": "Switzerland's Camille Rast said she was racing for the victims of the New Year's Eve fire in her hometown of Crans-Montana as she ended Mikaela Shiffrin's winning start to the World Cup slalom season.\n\nRast, 26, produced a stunning second run in Sunday's slalom in Kranjska Gora to pip Shiffrin by 0.14 seconds, following up Saturday's debut World Cup giant slalom victory at the same Slovenian resort.\n\nUS star Shiffrin, 30, had won the opening five slalom events which, when added to her victory in the final slalom of last season, equalled her own record of six consecutive wins in the discipline.\n\n\"I gave it everything I had this weekend - achieving the double [slalom and giant slalom] was extraordinary,\" said Rast, who added: \"I think about all those families - we raced for them this weekend.\"\n\nA devastating fire at Le Constellation bar in the Swiss ski resort killed at least 40 people and injured 119 others.\n\nBodies continue to be identified and a criminal investigation is under way.\n\n\"We can't imagine how it is, but it's for sure terribly hard,\" Rast told BBC's Ski Sunday.\n\n\"I hope they will find the support with their family and everybody around. And I hope that the sport will bring a little smile on their face.\"\n\nRast finished a close second to Shiffrin in the previous World Cup slalom event in Austria but was not to be denied a second time, making sure the World Cup's greatest skier could not add to her record tally of 106 wins in all disciplines.\n\nShiffrin was just 0.1 seconds behind leader Rast after the first run, but set an imposing time in the second that opened a 1.69secs lead over the rest of the field.\n\nBut Rast went even faster to beat Shiffrin into second place.\n\n\"I know Shiffrin is really fast and I had to be really, really fast to beat her. I saw her start and I was like 'mmm, OK, that's good, that's really good', but I just tried to give my best, and it worked,\" she said.\n\nThere are two more World Cup slalom events - in Flachau, Austria, on 13 January, and Spindleruv Mlyn in the Czech Republic on 25 January - before the Winter Olympics begin in Milan-Cortina on 6 February.\n\nWatch Rast's victory and interview in the latest edition of Ski Sunday from 17:50 GMT on 4 January.\n\nGreat Britain had two cross-country skiers finish in the top 10 of a World Cup event for the first time in Val di Fiemme, Italy, on Sunday.\n\nBritain's Joe Davies, 24, was sixth - his best World Cup finish - while team-mate Andrew Musgrave, 35, was eighth in the men's 10km mass start free, more commonly known as the 'Final Climb'.\n\nMusgrave finished 15th and Davies 16th in the overall Tour de Ski standings - the first time the British team has had two skiers in the top 20.\n\nDavies told BBC Sport: \"To have the results we've had this Tour de Ski means so much to us all. It's not only a testament to the work we've put in, but also to the belief that British skiing belongs at the top.\"\n\nThe British cross country team for the 2026 Winter Olympics is expected to be announced on 23 January.\n\nMeanwhile, Great Britain narrowly missed out on a first World Cup podium of the season in the men's four-man bobsleigh, finishing fourth in Winterberg, Germany.",

    "fullText": "Arne Slot spoke to Sky Sports after Liverpool's draw against Fulham: \"In an away game, scoring two goals should maybe be enough to win the game. It's not for the first time this season that we fight so hard and think we have a win but concede an incredible strike. We brought Joe Gomez in but they took it short. We missed out on a good result.\n\n\"We had our chances in the first half. We had a similar one with Cody Gakpo that they scored from. In an ideal world, we see a Liverpool team that is dominant but creates more chances. We scored two goals, scored two disallowed goals and hit the bar. Again, it wasn't enough.\n\n\"The players are giving everything they have. I have to keep in mind that I have to keep them available. Alexander Isak is out and I have to overload or play Hugo more, a player who has never played in the Premier League. You have to manage that. We still have 11 very good players on the pitch.\n\n\"It's not only for us, but many teams don't create chances every game. It's not perfect but at least we've created a few more chances today than last week.\"\n\nCody Gakpo spoke to BBC Match of the Day: \"It's disappointing for us. We fought very hard in the second half, dominated at moments and tried to create chances to get through. At the end I scored in minute 95, they scored in minute 97 - a wonderful goal to be fair. Unlucky, unfortunate.\n\n\"This is a moment that can happen in a game. I was just sitting down so I did not see the moments before. I just saw him take a touch and shoot the ball into the top corner.\n\n\"I think if you are going to analyse the game maybe we should have scored more goals or defended the two goals better. In the end we should do much better. There were moments that we showed how good we were but it is up to us to stay consistent and put in overall better performances. I'm sure the wins will come again.\"\n\nOn playing in the nine: \"As a forward player you always want to score goals to help the team so it's a plus for me. In the end it's a team sport and we didn't win so I'm still disappointed.\"",

    "fullText": "Countries’ commitments to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions can have important implications for their economies. Data since the 1800s reveal that the amount of CO2 emissions generated for a given level of output follows a bell-shaped curve. Pairing this with projections of future economic growth can help in predicting future overall emissions. Comparing actual data with past projections for levels of emission intensity reveals that reductions have been slower than predicted over the past 40 years. This divergence highlights the challenges many countries may face in reaching their emissions targets.\n\nMost countries have committed to reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions over the next few decades (United Nations 2021). These commitments can have important economic implications because they may involve reconfiguring the energy sector, adopting new production technologies, and a general shift in the industrial makeup of economies, to name a few (Fried, Novan, and Peterman 2021 and Gillingham and Stock 2018).\n\nIn this Economic Letter, we use historical CO2 emissions data to evaluate the evolution in the emission intensity of production. This refers to the amount of CO2 emissions per dollar of economic output produced, which can be used as a measure of emissions efficiency. The lower the emission intensity, the more likely countries are to meet their emissions targets given current trends of output growth. In assessing trends in emission intensity, we focus on the six largest carbon-emitting countries, which collectively represent about 75% of world emissions. Three of these countries—the United States, Japan, and Germany—represent advanced economies that developed early in the 20th century with highly inefficient technologies in terms of CO2 emissions. Over time, they have brought down their emissions per dollar significantly. The other three countries—China, India, and Russia—represent emerging economies that went through their industrial transition much later in the 20th century. Because production technologies available at that time had evolved to create less pollution, these three countries now face a quicker path toward cleaner production.\n\nBased on this historical evidence, we find that the emission intensities of these two groups over time can be approximated well by bell-shaped curves. We examine different economic growth scenarios and their implications for CO2 emissions relative to reduction commitments. Our analysis suggests that future paths of economic growth and efforts to reduce emission intensity are both important factors in assessing whether these countries will meet their stated targets.\n\nFollowing the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, commonly known as Glasgow COP26, world leaders reaffirmed their commitments to reducing CO2 emissions and limiting the increase in global average temperature to 1.5° Celsius (United Nations 2021). Achieving this target is likely to require countries to significantly reshape their economies, which can involve considerable transition costs (Gillingham and Stock 2018).\n\nHow can countries reduce fossil fuel emissions? At a basic level, there are only two ways: reduce overall economic output, and thus income and consumption for their citizens, or become more efficient by using cleaner technologies to produce the same goods and services with fewer emissions.\n\nWritten simply, the level of emissions equals an economy’s emission intensity multiplied by its economic output growth. Breaking down the problem into these two components is similar to approaches that some researchers use to forecast CO2 emissions (for example, Kaya and Yokobori 1997). Our approach provides a way to easily assess a country’s progress on its road toward lower emissions.\n\nWe begin by examining world emission intensity. Figure 1 displays global CO2 emissions divided by global GDP measured in U.S. dollars, which is a common way to compare output growth across countries, over the past 200 years. The dashed line shows the fit from a bell-shaped curve. We create the curve using three parameters that correspond to the peak intensity, when the peak occurs, and how long it takes for intensity to decline from the peak. The shaded regions are 68% confidence bands, which indicate the uncertainty related to the combination of our parameter estimates and how well the curve fits the data. The figure shows that a bell-shaped curve fits the historical path of emission intensity very well, capturing the rise of world intensity up to the 1920s and the gradual improvement since then.\n\nFigure 1\nGlobal CO2 emission intensity\n\nSources: Emissions: Ritchie, Roser, and Rosado (2020), based on Global Carbon Budget data. GDP levels: Maddison Project Database, accessed through Our World in Data. GDP growth rates and 2019–2021 levels: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).\n\nTo gain a better understanding of this pattern over time, we turn to more granular data on individual countries. We focus on the world’s six highest-emitting countries, which collectively account for about 75% of global emissions as of 2021: China with 37.88% of global emissions, the United States with 16.53%, India with 8.95%, Russia with 5.80%, Japan with 3.52%, and Germany with 2.23%.\n\nWe classify these countries into two groups. The first group, including the United States, Japan, and Germany, represents large advanced economies, while the second group, China, India, and Russia, represents large emerging economies. This classification helps us broadly characterize the paths and challenges ahead for these two types of economies, rather than relying on aggregate numbers.\n\nFigure 2 shows emission intensity—defined earlier as the ratio of total emissions to total economic output—averaged for the advanced economies group (solid blue line) and the emerging economies group (solid red line). Data for Russia is only available since 1960. To avoid a large jump in the series at that date, we approximate Russian data before then using the average of data for China and India because all three countries follow similar historical paths.\n\nFigure 2\nCO2 emission intensity by country group\n\nSources: Emissions: Ritchie, Roser, and Rosado (2020), based on Global Carbon Budget data. GDP levels: Maddison Project Database, accessed through Our World in Data, and authors’ calculations. GDP growth rates and 2019–2021 levels: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).\n\nFor both groups, we find that emission intensity is currently declining, implying that all countries are emitting less carbon per dollar of output produced relative to their respective peak emission intensity. In the case of the group of advanced economies, the decline of emission intensity began in the 1920s. For the group of emerging economies, the decline started from a lower peak level and took place much later, in the 1980s, which aligned with their economic development.\n\nTo model these trends of emission intensity, we find that fitting the data to bell-shaped curves again works surprisingly well for the two groups, as shown by the dashed lines in Figure 2, as well as at the individual country level (not shown). Focusing on the sample up to 2021, the dashed lines show that the bell-shaped curves nicely describe the magnitude of the emission intensity’s peak, the timing of when the peak occurs, and how quickly emission intensity declines from the peak.\n\nThe fitted curves also allow us to extrapolate the emission intensity for each group into the future. These projections are reported in Figure 2 to the right of the vertical line marking 2021. One major assumption underlying our extrapolation is that emission intensity will continue to decline at the rate dictated by the shape of the bell curve; despite the inherent uncertainty in projecting such trends, we believe that using history as a guide is a reasonable assumption.\n\nEmission intensity is only one part of the equation. The other part is determined by the rate at which countries continue to grow in the future. Therefore, in Figure 3, we present three different scenarios of output growth for our two groups.\n\nFigure 3\nProjected real GDP by country group\n\nThe first scenario relies on OECD long-term baseline projections for GDP growth for each country in the two groups through the year 2050. For the advanced economies group, shown in blue, the OECD’s average annual growth rate is 1.5%. For the emerging economies group, in red, the OECD’s average annual growth is 6.2%. The second and third scenarios assume a quarter percentage point higher and lower annual rates of growth per year, respectively. Over 27 years, these scenarios cumulate to 7% higher and lower growth for each group, shown by the upper and lower bounds of the shaded blue and red ranges.\n\nWe now have the two pieces needed to extrapolate emissions to 2050–emission intensity and output growth. Taking these pieces together, Figure 4 reports projected emissions by country group from 2021 to 2050. The solid lines report actual emissions for advanced (blue) and emerging (red) economies. The dashed lines show emissions predicted by our bell-shaped curve of emission intensity in combination with GDP projections. The figure also includes shaded regions that reflect both the uncertainty from the projections of our estimated bell curve, using plus and minus one standard deviation around the projections, and the range of assumptions for GDP growth based on OECD projections. Finally, we include horizontal lines corresponding to the 2030 emission reduction targets set by the countries of each group in accordance with Glasgow COP26. The targets were submitted as each country’s nationally determined contribution to the goal of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5°C (United Nations 2023). We calculated the target levels for the advanced and emerging economy groups by aggregating individual country-level commitments to the group level, shown by the two horizontal lines.\n\nFigure 4\nProjected emissions by country group\n\nSources: Emissions: Ritchie, Roser, and Rosado (2020), based on Global Carbon Budget data. GDP levels: Maddison Project Database, accessed through Our World in Data. GDP growth rates and 2019–2021 levels: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Country targets: United Nations (2023).\n\nWhat are the takeaways from Figure 4? The distance between the data and the model predictions (solid and dashed lines, respectively) since the 1990s shows that emissions have been running higher than our modeling framework would have predicted. In essence, the two groups are falling behind the curve. How quickly future emissions will decline is uncertain, as the wide ranges of our predictions suggest. Our exercise cannot project the potential effects of technological changes, economic shocks, and other sources of output and emissions variation. This means that the range of possible values shown in Figure 4 is likely to be even wider. Regardless of these sources of uncertainty, a comparison between the predictions and the 2030 commitments suggests that reaching these targets may require more extensive efforts from the countries in our sample.\n\nCountries worldwide have stated their commitments to reduce CO2 emissions over the next few decades. The lessons that we draw from our exercise in this Letter serve to sketch a more general view of the challenges to advanced and emerging economies when it comes to reducing fossil fuel emissions. Reaching 2030 targets may involve significant efforts to reduce emissions and have the potential to involve substantial economic changes to production, technology, use of resources, and saving and investment decisions (Fried, Novan, and Peterman 2021). Focusing on the top six emitting countries, we find that their emission intensity has considerably improved in the past few decades, though total emissions have been higher than expected over the past 40 years. Considering a relatively wide range of economic growth prospects, we find that—even with improvements in cleaner production technologies—countries are likely to fall well short of their intended emission reduction by 2030 and beyond.\n\nZoë Arnaut\nResearch Associate, Economic Research Department, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\n\nÒscar Jordà\nSenior Policy Advisor, Economic Research Department, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\n\nFernanda Nechio\nVice President, Economic Research Department, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\n\nFried Stephie, Kevin Novan, and William B.

    "fullText": "AI safety expert David Dalrymple said rapid advances could outpace efforts to control powerful systems\n\nThe world “may not have time” to prepare for the safety risks posed by cutting-edge AI systems, according to a leading figure at the UK government’s scientific research agency.\n\nDavid Dalrymple, a programme director and AI safety expert at the Aria agency, told the Guardian people should be concerned about the growing capability of the technology.\n\n“I think we should be concerned about systems that can perform all of the functions that humans perform to get things done in the world, but better,” he said. “We will be outcompeted in all of the domains that we need to be dominant in, in order to maintain control of our civilisation, society and planet.”\n\nDalrymple said there was a gap in understanding between the public sector and AI companies about the power of looming breakthroughs in the technology.\n\n“I would advise that things are moving really fast and we may not have time to get ahead of it from a safety perspective,” he said. “And it’s not science fiction to project that within five years most economically valuable tasks will be performed by machines at a higher level of quality and lower cost than by humans.”\n\nDalrymple said governments should not assume that advanced systems are reliable. Aria is publicly funded but independent from the government and directs research funding. Dalrymple is developing systems to safeguard AI’s use in critical infrastructure such as energy networks.\n\n“We can’t assume these systems are reliable. The science to do that is just not likely to materialise in time given the economic pressure. So the next best thing that we can do, which we may be able to do in time, is to control and mitigate the downsides,” he said.\n\nDescribing the consequences of technological progress getting ahead of safety as a “destabilisation of security and economy”, Dalrymple said more technical work was needed on understanding and controlling the behaviours of advanced AI systems.\n\n“Progress can be framed as destabilising and it could actually be good, which is what a lot of people at the frontier are hoping. I am working to try to make things go better but it’s very high risk and human civilisation is on the whole sleep walking into this transition.”\n\nThis month the UK government’s AI Security Institute (AISI) said the capabilities of advanced AI models were “improving rapidly” across all domains and the performance in some areas was doubling every eight months.\n\nLeading models can now complete apprentice-level tasks 50% of the time on average, up from approximately 10% of the time last year, according to the institute. AISI also found that the most advanced systems can autonomously complete tasks that would take a human expert over an hour.\n\nThe institute also tested advanced models for self-replication, a key safety concern because it involves a system spreading copies of itself to other devices and becoming harder to control. The tests showed two cutting-edge models achieving success rates of more than 60%.\n\nHowever, AISI stressed that a worst-case scenario was unlikely in a day-to-day environment, saying any attempt at self-replication was “unlikely to succeed in real-world conditions”.\n\nDalrymple believes that AI systems will be able to automate the equivalent of a full day of research and development work by late 2026, which will “result in a further acceleration of capabilities”, because the technology will be able to self-improve on the maths and computer science elements of AI development.",

    "title": "Before Maduro arrest, Nobel Prize winner said Venezuela has a $1.7 trillion opportunity to privatize over 500 companies and undo socialist ‘disaster’",
    "description": "Venezuela has the world’s largest oil reserves, but “our people don’t even have gas even to cook. That’s a disaster,” María Corina Machado told Fortune last year.",
    "fullText": "Months before the U.S. military arrested Venezuela’s Nicolás Maduro, opposition leader María Corina Machado called for what she described as the most ambitious economic transformation in the nation’s history—a sweeping privatization aimed at reversing his policies and what she calls “the disaster this socialist system has wrought.”\n\nAppearing virtually on the Fortune Global Forum stage in Riyadh, Machado, while in hiding from the Maduro regime, unveiled a bold vision to rebuild Venezuela’s shattered economy through large-scale private investment.\n\n“Venezuela will be the single biggest economic opportunity for decades to come in this region,” she told Fortune’s Diane Brady at the forum’s 2025 edition, weeks after winning the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize for her decades-long fight to restore democracy to Venezuela. “We’re talking about an opportunity, business opportunity, of more than $1.7 trillion. This is unique.” Machado has floated the $1.7 trillion figure before, an estimate produced by her economic advisory team.\n\nMachado painted a stark picture of a nation that has plummeted from prosperity to poverty: “a country that used to be the richest country in our region and the freest country in our region, and that has turned into one of the poorest.” Being under socialist rule for decades, she said, has crippled industry, devastated infrastructure, and triggered an exodus of nearly a third of Venezuela’s population. “Our economy has collapsed. It’s been over 80% down in the last [several] years,” she said. “Our people have been forced to flee just to survive.”\n\nThe International Monetary Fund estimated Venezuela’s economy had declined by roughly 75% as of late 2022, also covering its migrant crisis. The left-wing think tank Center for Economic and Policy Research argued shortly afterward that, while this figure was accurate, it discounted the severe economic sanctions imposed by the U.S. on Venezuela for many years.\n\nThe opposition leader described to Brady what she called a “narco-terrorist state” built on repression and corruption, saying that “certainly Venezuela has turned into a safe haven for criminal activities from all over the world.” She accused Maduro and his allies of financing their grip on power through gold smuggling, arms and drug trafficking, and human exploitation.\n\nAt the core of Machado’s plan is a rapid and transparent privatization process. She estimates that more than 500 enterprises were “taken by the regime, confiscated, destroyed, but the infrastructure is there.” She pledged strict oversight and rule of law from “day one,” aiming to lure investors back with stability and fiscal incentives. She pledged open markets and an approach that would be “absolutely strict” in terms of rule of law and transparency, reminding Brady that Venezuela is currently in last place in terms of rule of law. To take one example, the World Justice Project recently ranked Venezuela No. 142, out of 142 countries.",
