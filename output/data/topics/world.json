    "fullText": "Graduate international student enrollment at US universities is down after years of steady growth amid the Trump administration's immigration clampdown.\n\nThere were almost 10,000 fewer foreign students signing at the graduate level in fall 2025, a 5.9% decline from the year before, according to data released by the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center. Meanwhile, a 3.2% increase at the undergraduate level added 5,000 students to the numbers coming from abroad, the data showed.\n\nCombined, international and domestic enrollments showed a slight increase. In total, there were 19.4 million postsecondary enrollments — 16.2 million undergraduate, and 3.2 million graduates — up from the 19.2 million enrollments the year before.\n\nInternational students are typically welcomed by school administrators because they often pay the full fees. However, in a post on X this week, the State Department said it had revoked 8,000 student visas as part of its mission to \"keep America safe.\"\n\n🚨BREAKING: The State Department has now revoked over 100,000 visas, including some 8,000 student visas and 2,500 specialized visas for individuals who had encounters with U.S. law enforcement for criminal activity.\n\nWe will continue to deport these thugs to keep America safe. pic.twitter.com/wuHVltw1bV\n\nThe State Department reopened student visa applications in June last year, having temporarily halted them. It said applicants would have to set their social media accounts to public — a requirement extended to others applying for visas just before Christmas.\n\nThe National Student Clearinghouse Research Center did not immediately respond to a Business Insider request for comment.",

    "description": "The stars of \"Bridgerton\" season four wore daring sets, statement ball gowns, and chic suits at the world premiere in Paris on Wednesday.",
    "fullText": "It's almost time to return to the ton, gentle reader.\n\nThe first episodes of season four of \"Bridgerton\" will drop on Netflix on January 29, with part two premiering on February 26. The season focuses on Benedict Bridgerton's love story with Sophie Baek. Luke Thompson will reprise his role as Benedict, while Yerin Ha will play Sophie.\n\nAhead of the show's Netflix release, the cast of \"Bridgerton\" gathered at the Palais Brongniart in Paris on Wednesday to celebrate the season's world premiere in red-carpet style.\n\nSome stars wore high-fashion outfits that nodded to their characters, while others missed the mark with lackluster suits or dresses that didn't fit the event.\n\nTake a look at some of the best and worst outfits from the \"Bridgerton\" season four premiere.\n\nHa, who stars as Sophie Baek in season four of \"Bridgerton,\" arrived at the premiere in an ice-blue gown designed by Prada.\n\nThe dress had a bedazzled halter neckline that matched the beading on a cutout on the bodice. The floor-length skirt featured two large pleats that cascaded into a train that trailed behind Ha as she walked the red carpet. Sparkly jewelry completed Ha's glamorous look.\n\nThe ensemble looked like a modern take on Cinderella's iconic blue dress. It was fitting since Julia Quinn's \"An Offer from a Gentleman,\" upon which season four is based, is a retelling of \"Cinderella.\"\n\nAs he stepped into the leading role of \"Bridgerton,\" Thompson wore an all-black ensemble. He paired a black suit with a black button-down shirt, a black tie, and a black flower on his lapel. The only color on the look was a sparkly tie clip.\n\nThe look was stylish, but the black pieces blended so well that it became difficult to distinguish the different elements, particularly the flower and pin.\n\nSome pops of color may have made the outfit stand out more.\n\nJessie, who plays Eloise Bridgerton, chose an oversize suit for the event.\n\nThe double-breasted jacket and pants were black, but they were adorned with an assortment of flowers in various colors to give the suit some pop. Jessie paired the suit with a slicked-back hairstyle and several earrings and rings, adding a high-fashion edge.\n\nRosheuvel, who plays Queen Charlotte, wore a floor-length sweater dress from Sonney for the premiere. The burnt orange look had a slight sparkle and a cowl neckline, and Rosheuvel wore a matching coat and color-coordinated earrings.\n\nThe outfit was stylish, but it didn't feel formal enough for the red-carpet event. It may have worked better for a daytime press event, or Rosheuvel could have chosen a dress with the same silhouette in a different fabric.\n\nAlli, who plays Lord John Stirling on \"Bridgerton,\" wore an oversize black suit to the event.\n\nHe paired the suit with a white shirt, which he wore without a tie, and it peeked out from the cuffs of his jacket. He added a small silver brooch to his lapel for a chic addition.\n\nThe modern take on a tuxedo exuded high fashion.\n\nDodd, who married John Stirling as Francesca Bridgerton in season three of \"Bridgerton,\" chose a black Giambattista Valli Paris set for the premiere.\n\nThe top was a black, cropped shrug with a V-neck and a button closure that revealed her midriff. It was paired with a low-waisted, calf-length skirt that poofed out around her, giving it a ball-gown feel despite the modern silhouette.\n\nBlack heels and silver jewelry tied Dodd's stylish look together.\n\nThe Lady Danbury actor's custom Torlowei gown for the premiere was beautiful, with a high neckline and black lace detailing.\n\nHowever, Andoh's open-toed black shoes didn't quite match the dress, as they seemed less formal than the gown. Different shoes and statement earrings could have better accented the ensemble.\n\nLeung, who will make her debut on \"Bridgerton\" as Lady Araminta Gun, walked the red carpet in a black Toni Maticevski dress.\n\nIts strapless, scooped neckline formed points for a touch of drama before flowing into a corset bodice. The skirt was structured, poofing out around her waist in a dramatic ball-gown shape before flowing back into a pencil skirt. The center of the dress was made of ribbed fabric, adding dimension.\n\nChopard jewelry and strappy Christian Louboutin heels completed the look. Between the classic detailing, modern flair, and dark color, the dress was the perfect red-carpet companion for the wicked stepmother role Leung will play on the show.\n\nRhimes looked every bit the queen of the ton in the silver gown she wore to the premiere, which was styled by Dana Asher Levine.\n\nThe strapless gown had a slight point in the center of the straight neckline, and it cinched at Rhimes' waist with a belt. The entire gown was covered in silver and bronze sequins arranged in vertical strips, shimmering as Rhimes walked.\n\nThe pièce de résistance was a cape that coordinated with the gown. It sat on Rhimes' shoulder and flowed to the floor, giving the look a regal edge that was more than fitting for the occasion.",

    "fullText": "Bangladesh's cricketers have begun a boycott of all forms of cricket in response to comments made by a national cricket board director, which have led to his removal.\n\nBoth of Thursday's matches in the Bangladesh Premier League (BPL) have been postponed, while the national side's participation in February's T20 World Cup is in doubt.\n\nThe Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) announced it has removed M Nazmul Islam from his position as chair of its financial committee after he suggested players should shoulder the financial burden if Bangladesh were to withdraw from the World Cup.\n\nThe comments came amid political tensions between Bangladesh and host nation India.\n\nThe BCB has formally requested that all Bangladesh's matches are staged elsewhere in order to participate in the tournament.\n\nAll of Pakistan's fixtures are to be played in Sri Lanka, with the BCB seeking a similar arrangement.\n\nAsked about the financial implications should Bangladesh be required to withdraw, Islam said: \"Why [would there be]? Are we asking them for the crores and crores of taka [Bangladesh's currency] that we are spending on them? Answer me first.\n\n\"We are spending so much money on them, they are not being able to do anything in different places. Have we got any international awards? What have we done at any level?\n\n\"Let us now ask them for the money back after every time they couldn't play. Give us back. Why should there even be a question of compensating the players?\"\n\nOne Bangladeshi crore is equivalent to just over £60,000.\n\nIslam's comments drew a swift response from Mohammad Mithun, president of the Cricketers Welfare Association of Bangladesh (CWAB).\n\n\"The remark made by the BCB director has hurt the cricket fraternity greatly and it's not acceptable,\" Mithun told reporters on Wednesday evening.\n\n\"We demand his resignation. If he doesn't resign before tomorrow's match, we will announce a boycott of all cricket, starting from the BPL matches tomorrow.\"\n\nNeither side arrived for Thursday's match between Chattogram Royals and Noakhali Express, with that fixture and the later match between Rajshahi Warriors and Sylhet Titans confirmed as being postponed.\n\nThe BCB, in removing Islam from his position, stated: \"Following a review of recent developments and in the best interest of the organisation, the Bangladesh Cricket Board president has decided to release Mr Najmul Islam from his responsibilities as chairman of the finance committee with immediate effect.\n\n\"The BCB reiterates that the interests of the cricketers remain its highest priority. The board remains fully committed to upholding the honour and dignity of all players under its jurisdiction.\"\n\nIt said all cricketers should \"display the highest standards of professionalism and dedication to the betterment of Bangladesh cricket during what is a challenging period for the game\" and called for BPL matches to be played as planned.\n\nBangladesh's T20 World Cup campaign is scheduled to begin on Saturday, 7 February against West Indies in Kolkata, with a match against England on Saturday, 14 February due to take place at the same venue, Eden Gardens.\n\nThe Bangladesh Premier League has six group games left to play, leading into a four-match knockout stage, finishing with a final in Dhaka on Friday, 23 January.",

By Sunday morning, sports fans across the United Kingdom knew the country had a new world champion - its fifth reigning male titleholder.\n\n\"I feel like it's still yet to sink in properly now. But in a way it's not as big of a shock to me because it's something I always worked towards,\" Smith says.\n\n\"In the way I did it, overseas and everything against us, I feel like it made the story that much better.\"\n\nBBC Sport looks at how Smith overcame the odds to pull off one of the most striking British victories on American soil.",

    "description": "Even after 35 years, Super Mario World players are unearthing weird new possibilities in the SNES game. The latest is an unsettling ending in which Yoshi can actually eat Princess Peach, leading to Mario and his green companion just staring at each other until the end of time.\nSupper Mario Broth showcased the grim finale for Super Mario World on X, noting glitches are needed to achieve this conclusion. For instance, Super Mario World players might know that bringing Yoshi into the last battle with Bowser shouldn't be possible. Well, it's not without a glitch putting the green dinosaur in the reserve item box--which houses power-ups like the Cape Feather or mushroom.",

    "title": "Trump wants to control Greenland. See inside its sole US military base.",
    "description": "Greenland's natural resources and proximity to Russia and China have made it a valuable strategic asset to the US military since World War II.",
    "fullText": "Visitors to Pituffik Space Base in Greenland are greeted by a sign welcoming them to the \"top of the world.\"\n\nAs the US military's northernmost installation, Pituffik Space Base's operations include scientific research, space surveillance, and missile detection.\n\nGreenland's abundant natural resources and proximity to Russia and China have made it a valuable strategic asset since World War II — so much so that US President Donald Trump has often expressed his intent to purchase the autonomous Danish territory.\n\nVice President JD Vance and second lady Usha Vance visited the military base in March 2025 amid rising tensions between the US, Denmark, and Greenland.\n\nThose tensions have continued to flare as Trump has refused to rule out the use of military force to take control of Greenland. In a Truth Social post on Wednesday, Trump wrote that the US \"needs Greenland\" and \"anything less than that is unacceptable.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Denmark increased its military presence in Greenland, citing \"security tensions.\" Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio also met with the foreign ministers of Denmark and Greenland on Wednesday.\n\nHere's a look inside Greenland's only US military base.\n\nTrump first expressed interest in buying Greenland, the world's largest island and an autonomous Danish territory, during his first presidency. In addition to being rich in natural resources, Greenland's Arctic location is well-placed to further US interests by countering China and Russia.\n\nSince his reelection, Trump has repeatedly conveyed his desire to acquire Greenland and said he would not rule out the use of military force to take it.\n\n\"We need Greenland for national security. One way or the other we're going to get it,\" he said in his joint address to Congress in March 2025.\n\nBoth Denmark and Greenland's leaders have maintained that the island is not for sale.\n\nSecond lady Usha Vance was originally scheduled to visit Greenland on a solo trip in 2025 to \"visit historical sites, learn about Greenlandic heritage, and attend the Avannaata Qimussersua, Greenland's national dogsled race,\" the White House said.\n\nInstead, the trip was scaled back. The vice president and second lady visited Pituffik Space Base in Greenland, the US military's northernmost installation, in March.\n\nUsha Vance's solo trip could have violated diplomatic protocol by sending a delegation to another country without an invitation. The amended plan — visiting a US base — avoided that potential violation. While Trump said that \"people from Greenland are asking us to go there,\" the government of Greenland said they had not invited any foreign delegations to visit.\n\n\"Just for the record, Naalakkersuisut, the government of Greenland, has not extended any invitations for any visits, neither private nor official,\" the government's official Facebook page wrote in a post on Monday.\n\nGreenland's then-prime minister, Múte Bourup Egede, also called Usha Vance's planned trip \"very aggressive\" in an interview with Sermitsiaq, a Greenlandic newspaper.\n\nTaylor Van Kirk, JD Vance's press secretary, told Business Insider at the time that the vice president and second lady were \"proud\" to visit the US military base in Greenland.\n\n\"As the vice president has said, previous US leaders have neglected Arctic security, while Greenland's Danish rulers have neglected their security obligations to the island. The security of Greenland is critical in ensuring the security of the rest of the world, and the Vice President looks forward to learning more about the island.\"\n\nWhile the US doesn't own Greenland, it has had a military presence there since World War II.\n\nPituffik Space Base, originally named Thule Air Base, was formally established in 1951 as part of a Cold War-era defense treaty between the US and Denmark. It is located in Pituffik, Greenland, 750 miles north of the Arctic Circle and halfway between New York and Moscow.\n\nAs a Danish territory, Greenland does not have a military of its own.\n\nAs the Pentagon's northernmost military base, Pituffik Space Base acts as a key Arctic defense outpost. Because of its location on the \"top of the world,\" it is an optimal vantage point for monitoring missile launches by US adversaries like Russia and establishing space superiority.\n\nThe base is the site of a phased-array radar, which can detect sea-launched and intercontinental ballistic missiles, and a surface-to-air missile system, which intercepts hostile threats.\n\nThe base has a Satellite Command and Control system to maintain real-time communications and data relay with military and intelligence satellites. Its high-altitude location also allows it to more frequently track polar-orbit satellites, which can monitor the entire Earth's surface over time as the planet rotates below them.\n\nBecause Pituffik's primary mission is space surveillance and missile warning, the space base doesn't house a permanently stationed fighter wing or naval fleet.\n\nInstead, it acts as a strategic logistics and defense hub for Arctic missions and under-ice operations. From the site, which is the world's northernmost deep-water seaport, surface vessels and submarines operated by the US Navy and allied forces conduct Arctic patrols and cold-weather training exercises.\n\nAircraft regularly fly in and out of the former air base, such as military cargo and refueling planes and maritime patrol aircraft. Occasionally, fighter jets and long-range bombers will fly to the base for Arctic deterrence deployments and training flights.\n\nWhile it doesn't have a permanent combat force, the Air Force does have one tugboat at Pituffik to support port operations, icebreaking, and maneuvering ships.\n\nA small but significant asset, the Rising Star helps keep supply routes open by breaking up and pushing floating ice. The tugboat guides supply ships through the port, making it a critical component in bringing fuel, food, and equipment to personnel year-round.\n\nHowever, since the base is locked in by ice for nine months of the year, the Rising Star gets limited use because it can only be operated when the port is completely ice-free.\n\nPituffik Space Base is surrounded by ice for nine months out of every year. The closest town, the Inuit village of Qaanaaq, is located 65 miles away.\n\nTemperatures can range from 60 degrees Fahrenheit in the summer, when there are 24 hours of daylight, to -50 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, when there is no sunlight for weeks.\n\nWinter storms are categorized into five levels from least to most severe: Normal, Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, and Delta. At the Bravo level, the buddy system is implemented so that no one walks outside alone. Non-essential facilities close at the Charlie level, and personnel must shelter in place during Delta storms.\n\nAbout 150 personnel are stationed at Pituffik.\n\nThe Dundas Buffet Dining Hall on base serves three meals a day with payments accepted through a meal card.\n\nThe Base Exchange, also known as \"BX,\" sells groceries, toiletries, souvenirs, and other assorted goods. It also houses a barber shop.\n\nThere are no ATMs at Pituffik Space Base, but the Base Exchange accepts debit and credit cards as well as US dollars.\n\nPituffik Space Base features a bowling alley, a chapel, and a community center with a theater and craft room.\n\nThere's also a gymnasium and workout room stocked with weights and treadmills.\n\nPituffik Space Base's official Facebook page shows personnel participating in recreational events such as a Hawaiian-themed Arctic luau party, Greenlandic Heritage Week, and cross-country skiing.\n\nThe US built airbases and weather stations across the ice sheet during World War II as refueling stops on transatlantic flights and supply routes.\n\nTwo decommissioned airbases are now being used as civilian airports, and a third was abandoned after the war ended.\n\nDuring the Cold War, the US Air Force also built four stations on Greenland's coasts as part of a larger communication network of more than 60 radar installations to detect Soviet bombers. Most of the stations have since been deactivated, left to deteriorate atop Greenland's ice sheet.\n\nIn 2024, NASA scientists detected an underground base for a top-secret Cold War-era missile operation known as Camp Century. Now buried 100 feet under the ice, the abandoned network of subterranean tunnels once operated under the guise of an Arctic research facility before the US government declassified it in 1995.\n\nBut the abandoned military sites represent more than just relics of past global conflicts. Thousands of gallons of biological, chemical, and radioactive waste left behind on the bases pose a significant environmental threat, especially as the planet warms.\n\nThe US military failed to clean up decommissioned facilities like Camp Century, assuming the ice sheet would entomb the waste and infrastructure over the years.\n\nHowever, at the current melting rate of the Arctic, researchers estimate that the waste could resurface around 2100. The question remains as to who is responsible for cleaning up the waste from abandoned US military facilities scattered throughout Greenland.\n\nThe US has long pursued access to or control over Greenland due to its strategic and economic significance, dating back as early as the late 19th century.\n\nSince his return to the White House, Trump has continued to double down on his ambitions to secure the self-governing territory within the Kingdom of Denmark, saying he won't rule out military force or economic coercion to do so.\n\nThough the Danish government has remained steadfast in refusing the sale, Trump's so-called \"real estate deal\" has spotlighted Greenland's growing desire for independence from Denmark and disinterest in being owned by anybody, including the US.\n\n\"The time has come to stand together,\" Greenland Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said at a press conference on Tuesday, appearing with Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen. \"It has not been easy to stand up to completely unacceptable pressure from our closest allies for a lifetime. But there is much to suggest that the hardest part is still ahead of us.\"",

    "description": "Ethereum treasury Bitmine Immersion is making a big investment in MrBeast's company, which said last year it would launch a financial services platform.",
    "fullText": "The biggest ethereum holding company in the world is betting big on the digital finance ambitions of one of the world's top online content creators.\n\nTom Lee, the cofounder of global investment advisory firm Fundstrat Global Advisors, announced on Thursday that Bitmine Immersion Technologies is investing $200 million in Beast Industries, the holding company founded by YouTube star MrBeast.\n\nJimmy Donaldson, better known by his social media moniker, announced plans to launch a financial services platform in December, and Lee said on Thursday that he believes it will play a pivotal role in one of the financial sector's fastest-growing markets.\n\nBeast Industries CEO Jeff Housenbold also hinted at a future partnership, saying in a statement: \"We look forward to exploring ways to further collaborate and incorporate DeFi into our upcoming financial services platform.\"\n\nIn June 2025, Lee led Bitmine's strategic pivot from operating as a bitcoin miner to becoming the world's largest ethereum treasury, helping usher in last year's investor craze for digital asset holding strategies.\n\n\"MrBeast and Beast Industries, in our view, is the leading content creator of our generation, with a reach and engagement unmatched with Gen Z, Gen Alpha and Millennials,\" he said. \"Beast Industries is the largest and most innovative creator based platform in the world and our corporate and personal values are strongly aligned.\"\n\nLee said on CNBC that he sees his bet on Beast Industries as a rising player in a broader movement to tokenize assets on the blockchain.\n\n\"Digitalization of not only dollars, but stocks and equities, is going to take place and over time, that really blurs what is a service versus what's digital money,\" he added. \"That's where a collaboration and investment into Beast Industries makes sense.\"\n\nCompanies such as Robinhood have recently embraced asset tokenization, viewing it as a way to offer investors exposure to companies that might still be private or to allow investors to more easily trade hard assets like real estate.\n\nBeast Industries, for its part, has been laying the groundwork for a financial services venture for a while. In a pitch deck shared in early 2025, which was viewed by Business Insider, it described customized offerings that would target MrBeast's audience, supported by financial literacy content. The deck listed nine potential offerings, including student loans, insurance, and credit insights. It said the company would launch by partnering with a fintech company to leverage its existing infrastructure \"while avoiding regulatory, credit risk, and capital requirement.\"\n\nDonaldson has also said he's looking to build a financial literacy-focused channel.\n\nBeast Industries took in over $400 million in revenue in 2024, according to investor materials viewed by Business Insider. The company lost money last year, mainly because of high costs in its media business. Recently, the company has been on a cost-cutting push as it looks to reduce media-related losses.\n\nIn 2025, the social media star sought to raise $200 million to extend a $300 million Series C round he'd raised in 2024 at a $5 billion valuation, according to investment materials viewed by Business Insider.\n\nDonaldson's company has been pitching investors on the idea of building the \"next Disney.\" Like Disney, Beast Industries is looking to expand well beyond video into different product categories.",

    "description": "As personalization becomes table stakes, a new class of products is emerging that depends not just on data inferred from patterns and history but on deeply personal information that customers are willing to reveal about themselves in the moment. This is “confessional commerce,” a model in which value is created through candid, contextual disclosure and sustained by how products respond to it. Drawing on research from clinical psychology and real-world product building, well-designed interactions can reduce shame, invite deeper honesty, and build trust over time. By applying five principles that psychologists use to elicit meaningful disclosure, teams can pair AI’s predictive power with psychological attunement, creating feedback loops in which better responses lead to greater openness and, ultimately, more effective personalization.",

So far, we've seen the manufacturers be able to absorb most of the tariffs without passing them on to the consumer.

But also, frankly, it's a very complicated situation.\" // \"Affordability has become a major issue in the industry, so we're going to see the manufacturers offering lower-priced vehicles when they can. // Right now, the average price for new vehicles is approaching right around $50,000, and that's a lot for some households.

    "fullText": "STOCKHOLM/LONDON, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Elon Musk's Grok chatbot is testing Europe's ability to clamp down on deepfakes and digital undressing of images online, even after regulators scored a rare win by forcing Musk's xAI to curb the creation of sexualized images.\n\nxAI said late on Wednesday ​it had restricted image editing for Grok AI users after the chatbot churned out thousands of sexualized images of women and minors that alarmed global regulators.\n\nThe ‌climb-down by Musk, who initially laughed off the trend, highlights the difficulty of policing AI tools that make it cheap and easy to create explicit content. It is the latest clash between Europe and Musk, following rows ‌over election interference, content moderation and free speech.\n\nMany regulators are still scrambling to develop laws and rules to govern AI, with question marks over what constitutes nudity, how to define consent, and who bears responsibility: the user or the platform.\n\n\"It's really a grey zone with regards to the creation of the nude images,\" Ängla Pändel, a Stockholm-based data protection and privacy lawyer with Mannheimer Swartling, told Reuters.\n\nBritish regulator Ofcom, one of the most vocal on the issue, welcomed the move by Musk, but said its investigation into xAI over the Grok images would continue.\n\n\"Our formal investigation remains ⁠ongoing,\" a spokesperson said. \"We are working round the clock to ‌progress this and get answers into what went wrong and what's being done to fix it.\"\n\nSTRONGEST ENFORCEMENT STILL NEEDED, OFFICIALS SAY\n\nEarlier this month, Grok created hyper-realistic images of women on X manipulated to look like they were in tiny bikinis, degrading poses or even covered in bruises. ‍Some minors were digitally stripped down to swimwear.\n\nUntil Wednesday, Reuters found the chatbot still produced sexualized images privately on demand. That appeared to have been curbed at least in certain geographies on Thursday.\n\nMusk's xAI said it was blocking users from generating images of people in skimpy attire in \"jurisdictions where it's illegal\". It did not identify those jurisdictions.\n\nIn Malaysia and Indonesia the government has imposed temporary bans on Grok, ​while EU and UK regulators called the images unlawful. The UK, France and Italy launched probes, but faced calls for tougher action.\n\n\"Stronger enforcement under the Digital Services Act (DSA) ‌is needed to stop apps and platforms that sexualise or nudify women and children,\" said Christian Democrat MEP Nina Carberry, who called the latest move a \"positive step\".\n\n⁠A European Commission spokesperson said that if the Grok changes were not effective, the Commission would still use the full enforcement toolbox of the EU's DSA against the platform.\n\nLEGAL GREY AREA, HEAVY BURDEN ON VICTIMS\n\nThe UK's Online Safety Act makes the sharing of intimate images without consent, including AI-generated deepfakes, a 'priority offence', said Alexander Brown, a UK-based data protection lawyer at Simmons & Simmons.\n\n\"This means X must take proactive, proportionate steps to prevent such content from appearing on its platform and to swiftly remove it when detected,\" he said.\n\nBritain's regulator can fine a company up to 10% ⁠of revenue in the most serious cases of non-compliance or ask a court to require internet service ​providers to block the site.\n\nFor individuals, taking platforms to court is \"a really difficult and heavy process,” said ​Anders Bergsten, a lawyer at Mannheimer Swartling, citing the emotional toll on victims.\n\nDeepfakes have existed for years, well before the advent of the AI apps, though they were largely confined to the darker corners of the web. The publishing power of X gives Grok unprecedented reach.\n\n\"The frictionless publishing capability enables ‍the deepfakes to spread at scale,\" said U.S.-based ⁠lawyer Carrie Goldberg, who works with cyber harassment victims.\n\nLaws in Britain and Sweden make the non-consensual sharing of nude images illegal. Britain is widening the law to include the making of such images.\n\nUnder the DSA, suspending a service is considered a last resort. The EU AI Act also does not have any provision for nude ⁠images of adults, only transparency obligations for deepfakes, experts said.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Keir Starmer welcomed X's move on Thursday but warned: \"Free speech is not the freedom to violate consent. Young women's images are not public property, ‌and their safety is not up for debate.\"\n\n\"If we need to strengthen existing laws further, we are prepared to do that.\"",

    "fullText": "Tottenham Hotspur are in discussions with Brazilian side Bahia over a permanent transfer for striker Alejo Veliz as they look to move the Argentina international on.\n\nTalks are ongoing between the clubs, with no fee agreed at this stage, but there is a shared willingness to explore a deal that would see Veliz leave North London on a permanent basis.\n\nAny agreement would require Veliz’s current loan spell at Rosario Central to be terminated early, despite the deal originally running until June 2026.\n\nThe 22-year-old returned to his boyhood club last summer after an underwhelming first year in Europe and has shown signs of recovery in familiar surroundings.\n\nVeliz has scored five goals in 16 appearances for Rosario since rejoining them, offering enough encouragement to attract external interest once again.\n\nHis time at Tottenham has been limited, with all eight of his senior appearances for the club coming during the 2023–24 season.\n\nVeliz’s only goal for Spurs arrived in a 4-2 Premier League defeat to Brighton & Hove Albion in December 2023, when he scored as a late substitute.\n\nLoan spells away from Tottenham have produced mixed returns, including an unproductive stint at Sevilla and a more stable period at Espanyol in La Liga, where he scored four times in 16 outings.\n\nBahia’s interest represents a potential fresh start, with the Brazilian side finishing seventh in Serie A last season and qualifying for the Copa Libertadores preliminary rounds.\n\nThe club are majority-owned by City Football Group and have been active in strengthening their squad ahead of a demanding continental campaign.\n\nFrom Tottenham’s perspective, the move would bring clarity to a situation that has remained unresolved since Veliz’s arrival from Rosario Central in 2023.\n\nSpurs paid around £13 million for the striker as a teenager, viewing him as a long-term project with physical and aerial qualities suited to the Premier League.\n\nHowever, a lack of consistent opportunities, coupled with adaptation issues, prevented him from establishing himself under successive managers.\n\nTottenham are now open to a clean break, with the expectation that a permanent sale would better serve both player and club.\n\nVeliz, for his part, is understood to be open to the move as he seeks regular football and a more defined role.\n\nSpurs are currently 14th in the Premier League and have been reshaping their squad during the winter transfer window.\n\nThey completed the signing of midfielder Conor Gallagher from Atletico Madrid earlier this week, underlining their focus on immediate impact players.\n\nA Veliz exit would continue that process, closing the chapter on a transfer that never fully took off.\n\nThe deal would represent a significant investment for Bahia in a forward still viewed as having untapped potential.\n\nWhether a final agreement can be reached will depend on bridging the gap in valuation over the coming days.",

    "title": "Nearly 5M Accounts Removed Under Australia's New Social Media Ban",
    "description": "Governments around the world are watching the rollout of the landmark law, which made it illegal for those under 16 to have accounts.",
    "fullText": "Nearly five million social media accounts belonging to Australian teenagers have been deactivated or removed, a month after a landmark law barring those younger than 16 from using the services took effect, the government said on Thursday.\n\nThe announcement was the first reported metric reflecting the rollout of the law, which is being closely watched by several other countries weighing whether the regulation can be a blueprint for protecting children from the harms of social media, or a cautionary tale highlighting the challenges of such attempts.\n\nThe law required 10 social media platforms, including Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat and Reddit, to prevent users under 16 from accessing their services. Under the law, which came into force in December, failure by the companies to take “reasonable steps” to remove underage users could lead to fines of up to 49.5 million Australian dollars, about $33 million.\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese has praised the law as a world-first attempt to shield young teens from the mental health detriments and potential abuses of social media. On Thursday, he said it was encouraging to see social media companies making a meaningful effort to keep children off their platforms.\n\n“Change doesn’t happen overnight,” he said. “But these early signs show it’s important we’ve acted to make this change.”\n\nThe number of removed accounts offered only a limited picture of the ban’s impact. Many teenagers have said in the weeks since the law took effect that they were able to get around the ban by lying about their age, or that they could easily bypass verification systems.\n\nThe country’s online safety regulator tasked with enforcing and tracking the law, the eSafety Commissioner, did not release a detailed breakdown beyond announcing that the companies had “removed access” to about 4.7 million accounts belonging to children under 16.\n\nMeta, the parent company of Instagram and Facebook, said this week that it had removed almost 550,000 accounts of users younger than 16 before the ban came into effect.\n\nSeveral governments around the world, including Denmark, the European Union, France, New Zealand and Malaysia, have said they are considering similar bans. Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain told members of Parliament this week that he was considering it, according to reports.\n\nJulie Inman Grant, the eSafety Commissioner, acknowledged there would still be some underage teenagers on social media, but said the law’s success should ultimately be measured by a broader reduction in harm that could take years to become apparent.\n\n“Speed limits, for instance, are not a failure because some people speed,” she said. “Most would agree that roads are safer because of them.”\n\nJack Okill, 15, was among the teenagers who found themselves locked out of their social media accounts last month. He had built a following of 1,500 people on Instagram, which he used to connect with his peers and promote his political podcast, “Your First Vote.”\n\n“I was quite frankly annoyed when I opened my phone, went on Instagram to check what’s happening, and it just said I’m logged out,” he said.\n\nJack said he created a new Instagram account using his mother’s details to post his content until he turns 16 later this year, when he will be able to reclaim his old account. His mother manages the new account, he said.\n\nWhile he understood the need to limit exposure to harmful content and to stop online abuse, he said the government should have forced companies to make their platforms a safe place for children, rather than impose a blanket ban.\n\n“I’m old enough to know what’s happening in the world,” he said. “But the government is treating us like children.”\n\nAnother Australian teen, 14-year-old Raeve, said that he was able to continue using his YouTube account by changing his age and that his account on Reddit remained active. Most of his peers seem unaffected by the ban, he said.\n\n“It’s undoubtedly done nothing, from my view,” said Raeve, who asked that he only be identified by his first name because he is a minor. His father was prompted by YouTube on his own account to verify his age with an ID or a photo, while Raeve’s account was not flagged, according to the teenager.\n\nHe said he was well attuned to the pitfalls of social media, having been bullied for videos he posted when he was 9 years old. He has also observed a schoolmate who appeared to become steeped in far-right, racist views from things he was exposed to on social media, he said.\n\nEven though Raeve was happy that he could still access his accounts, he said he was disappointed in what he felt was an inadequate effort by the government to make sure that young people were more thoroughly protected from the dangers of social media.\n\nCritics of the law have also cautioned that a blanket ban may disproportionately affect minorities, teens living in remote areas who connect with peers online, or young people living with disabilities who may have found communities through social media.",

    "fullText": "MOSCOW, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Wednesday that the United States was fragmenting the very international system ​which Washington helped to create by undertaking what he said ‌was an illegal operation to topple Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro and by threatening Iran with attack.\n\n\"We ‌are talking about a gross violation of international law,\" Lavrov said of the U.S. operation to capture Maduro.

But these early signs show it’s important we’ve acted to make this change.”\n\nThe communications minister, Anika Wells, said eSafety would examine the data to see what it shows about the compliance of individual platforms.\n\n“We’ve said from the beginning that we weren’t expecting perfection straight away – but early figures are showing this law is making a real, meaningful difference.”\n\nThe federal opposition, which campaigned for the policy before it was adopted by the government, last week said the ban implementation had “fallen flat”.\n\n“Many under-16 accounts have not been deactivated, while others that were initially removed have since become active again,” the shadow communications minister, Melissa McIntosh, said.\n\n“New accounts are being created and the age-verification tools that the government assured Australians would be effective, have proven laughably easy to bypass with some makeup and good lighting.”\n\nMcIntosh said children who lost access had migrated to other platforms such as Yope and Lemon8, arguing they were not included in the ban.\n\nThe ban requires all platforms to self-assess as to whether the ban should apply to them, and the government indicated it would approach other platforms to seek compliance should teens migrate to those platforms.\n\nSome platforms such as X alternative Bluesky implemented age-assurance despite not being initially named in the list released by the government.\n\nWhile the UK and other countries are considering following Australia’s lead, a new study on Wednesday tracking 11 to 14-year-olds in the UK found no evidence for boys or girls that heavier social media use or more frequent gaming increased teenagers’ symptoms of anxiety or depression.\n\nIt found social media use from year 8 to year 9 and from year 9 to year 10 had no detrimental impact on their mental health the following year.",

    "fullText": "An ambitious effort to create a neurophysiological paradigm to explain near-death experiences has failed to capture many fascinating and often perplexing aspects of people’s brushes with death, top University of Virginia experts argue in a new paper.\n\nUVA near-death researchers Bruce Greyson, MD, and Marieta Pehlivanova, PhD, laud the international team of scientists who developed the model, called Neurophysiological Evolutionary Psychological Theory Understanding Near-Death Experience, or NEPTUNE. The NEPTUNE team aimed to bring scientific rigor to understanding near-death experiences (NDEs) – a goal shared by Greyson and Pehlivanova. But the UVA experts say the model, for all its sophistication, leaves far too many unanswered questions to be considered a satisfactory solution to the mysteries of NDEs.\n\n“The NEPTUNE model was a pioneering attempt to explain NDEs, but it selectively ignored scientific evidence that contradicts the model and failed to address some of the most important and defining parts of NDEs,” said Greyson, part of the Division of Perceptual Studies at UVA’s School of Medicine.\n\nIn their new paper, Greyson and Pehlivanova outline many facets of NDEs that the NEPTUNE model – and neurophysiology more broadly – still cannot explain. For example, the NEPTUNE researchers argue that near-death “hallucinations” could be caused by changes in blood brain gases, endorphins or other chemical or electrical activity in the brain.\n\nBut Pehlivanova and Greyson note that neurological hallucinations typically only involve a single sense, such as hearing or sight. Those types of single-sense hallucinations do not align, the UVA researchers say, with the robust and often life-changing encounters near-death experiencers report having with loved ones or even with people they have never met. Experiencers can often recall what they saw, heard, smelled and touched while dead, and the encounters are often burned into their brains for decades – unlike hallucinations, which are quickly forgotten.\n\nThe NEPTUNE group also advanced a potential explanation for the out-of-body experiences near-death experiencers sometimes report. In these instances, experiencers feel disconnected from their physical forms and sometimes recall looking down on their own bodies. The NEPTUNE scientists pointed to two studies suggesting that this may be the result of the activation of a particular region in the brain, the temporoparietal junction (TPJ). But Greyson and Pehlivanova counter that the experiences reported in those two studies are “quite unlike” the out-of-body experiences described in NDEs. During TPJ activation, there is a sense of disembodiment, but visual perception remains normal – experiencers don’t see their own forms or feel like they can move about independent of their bodies as near-death experiencers do.\n\nFurther, the UVA researchers note that electrical stimulation studies have already tested the TPJ theory. Stimulating the brain region produced visual hallucinations, but study participants did not believe they had left their bodies, Greyson and Pehlivanova write: “There is no evidence that electrical brain stimulation has ever produced accurate perception of anything not visible to the physical eyes, or that persists when eyes are closed, or that is from an out-of-body perspective – all features observed in spontaneous OBEs.”\n\nWhile Pehlivanova and Greyson raise several additional concerns about the NEPTUNE model, they were eager to applaud its developers for their efforts. “Martial et al have done a monumental job summarizing the major arguments in this field, relying on both theoretical and empirical contributions from the NDE literature and broader major research,” they write. But they say a lack of empirical data and other flaws in the NEPTUNE model raise concerns that “temper our enthusiasm for the model and our confidence that it can provide a comprehensive explanation for NDEs.”\n\nIn other words, neurophysiology still can’t explain near-death experiences, Pehlivanova and Greyson say. But they are eager for the conversation to continue.\n\n“NDEs are typically triggered by physiological events, so it makes sense to explore those connections and look for cause-and-effect. But this effort is just at the beginning stage, and it is important to keep being open-minded as we continue the search,” Greyson said. “Understanding NDEs can unlock the door to larger questions about consciousness and the brain. We hope the quest to appreciate all aspects of NDEs will lead us not just to mapping the triggers of NDEs but also to their meaning and to a better understanding of the boundary between life and death.”\n\nGreyson and Pehlivanova have published their response in the scientific journal Psychology of Consciousness: Theory, Research and Practice. The article is open access, meaning it is free to read.\n\nEstablished in 1967 under the leadership of UVA psychiatrist Ian Stevenson, MD, DOPS stands as the most productive university-based research group in the world dedicated to exploring phenomena that challenge conventional scientific paradigms concerning human consciousness. At the core of DOPS’ research mission lies the commitment to rigorous evaluation of empirical evidence surrounding exceptional human experiences and capacities, including utilization of a state-of-the-art neuroimaging lab. DOPS extends its focus beyond fundamental empirical research and explores the profound implications of such research for scientific theory and society at large. By actively sharing insights and findings, DOPS strives to contribute meaningfully to the understanding of consciousness, bridging the gap between scientific inquiry and public awareness.\n\nArticle written by Josh Barney, Deputy Public Information Officer, UVA Health.",

Bonta said that there had been a flood of reports in the last few weeks that Grok users were taking pictures of women and minors they found online and using the AI model to undress them in images.\n\nIndonesia and Malaysia suspended Grok because of the images, the first countries in the world to ban the AI tool. Lawmakers in the UK publicly considered a suspension.\n\nIn Wednesday's blog post, the social media company reiterated that image creation and the ability to edit images via Grok on the X platform will now only be available to paid users as an additional safety measure.\n\nThe company restricted non-paying users last week after complaints from officials globally, but it was slammed for being insufficient.\n\nA spokesperson for British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said it \"simply turns an AI feature that allows the creation of unlawful images into a premium service.\"\n\nElon Musk, who owns xAI, the maker of Grok, said that the UK government wanted \"any excuse for censorship\" in response to a post questioning why AI tools like Gemini and ChatGPT were not being looked into.\n\nOn Wednesday, a few hours before X's official account posted about the ban on creating sexualized images, Musk asked users to try to get around the AI model's image restrictions.\n\nBonta's office and Starmer's office did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.",

I hope to win it (the final) and bring (the trophy) back to Dakar,\" the 33-year-old said.\n\nSenegal, champions in 2022, dominated possession against cautious Egypt as the Cup of Nations title continues to elude Liverpool superstar Salah.\n\nThis was Salah's fifth AFCON and the closest he has come to a winners' medal is finishing a runner-up twice.\n\nIt will be Senegal's fourth Cup of Nations final appearance overall and their third in the last four editions.\n\n\"I think we managed the game well from start to finish and, overall, we deserved to win. We'll try to be ready for the final, above all to give our best,\" said Mane.\n\n\"The most important thing for me is that Senegal wins every time... I am a soldier of the nation. I try to give my all every day, whether in training or in matches.\n\n\"The Africa Cup of Nations is the most difficult competition in the world. All the teams are evenly matched.\"\n\nReferring to his former Liverpool teammate Salah, Mane said the Egyptian is \"one of the best players in the world\".\n\nThe goal that decided the game came with 12 minutes remaining, as Mane's low shot flew past the goalkeeper and into the net.",

    "fullText": "Aryna Sabalenka has made a strong start to her 2026 tennis campaign, picking up her first title of the year before January is even over.\n\nAryna Sabalenka has opened the 2026 season in commanding fashion, capturing the Brisbane International title on Sunday with a straight-sets victory over Marta Kostyuk, 6-4, 6-3. The result extends her outstanding recent form, with the Belarusian now claiming five tournament titles across her last eight events.\n\nWith that momentum behind her, the four-time Grand Slam champion is already being tipped as a leading contender for the Australian Open later this month. While her raw power and aggressive style have long been admired, her emotional volatility in high-pressure moments — most notably during her 2025 French Open final defeat to Coco Gauff — has previously raised questions about her consistency on the biggest stages.\n\nSpeaking on First and Red, former world No. 3 Elena Dementieva, winner of 16 WTA singles titles and the 2008 Olympic gold medal, highlighted what she sees as a crucial shift in Sabalenka’s mentality. Dementieva said the Belarusian has become significantly calmer in recent seasons, learning to regain focus even after emotional lapses during matches.\n\nShe explained that while Sabalenka remains naturally fiery and expressive on court, she now possesses the ability to regulate those emotions rather than be overwhelmed by them. According to Dementieva, that emotional edge remains one of Sabalenka’s greatest strengths and a key reason behind her success, rather than a flaw.\n\nDementieva also addressed Sabalenka’s prospects in Melbourne, stating that based on her recent performances — including her early-season preparation events — there is a strong probability that Sabalenka could claim another Australian Open crown.\n\nSabalenka is no stranger to success in Melbourne, having lifted the Australian Open trophy in both 2023 and 2024 before falling just short of a third consecutive title when she lost the 2025 final to Madison Keys.\n\nThe backing of Dementieva carries particular significance given her own decorated career. Widely regarded as one of the greatest players never to win a Grand Slam, the Russian reached major finals at both the 2004 French Open and US Open, peaked at world No. 3, and achieved Olympic glory in Beijing in 2008. She also enjoyed notable success in doubles, including WTA Finals victory in 2002 and multiple US Open finals appearances.\n\nDementieva retired in 2010 after her final WTA Finals appearance and received emotional tributes from peers and fans alike, including praise from fellow Russian Vera Zvonareva, who credited her with being a lasting inspiration and role model for an entire generation of young players.",

    "fullText": "FC Barcelona won the first trophy of the 2025/26 season last Sunday as they beat Real Madrid 3-2 to win the Spanish Super Cup for the second year in a row.\n\nHaving won all three domestic trophies last season, fans believe this could be the moment for the club to secure the long-awaited sixth UEFA Champions League title, 11 years after lifting the trophy for the last time.\n\nHowever, former Real Madrid midfielder and German legend Toni Kroos seems to think otherwise.\n\nSpeaking on the podcast Einfach mal Luppen (h/t SPORT), which he co-hosts with his brother Felix Kroos, the former Madrid midfielder explained that he holds the same opinion as last season regarding Barcelona’s prospects in Europe.\n\nHis brother said that “They are still very happy with the Spanish Super Cup, but now the Champions League is coming up for Barcelona, where they will be playing against top-level opponents.”\n\nBarcelona won the Super Cup, but Kroos believes they might come short in Europe. (Photo by Yasser Bakhsh/Getty Images)\n\nAt this point, the former Real Madrid midfielder interrupted to state his view, saying: “They are not going to win any international titles, at least that’s what I think.”\n\nAs he himself pointed out, this is not the first time Kroos has expressed a similar view.\n\nEarlier this season, after PSG’s win over Barcelona, he commented that the Catalans “had to be smarter,” because in his view “if you are tired and do not change your style of play, it becomes very obvious how exposed you are”.\n\nEven so, this stance does not mean Kroos fails to acknowledge Barcelona’s level. In October, he told El Chiringuito that Flick’s team play “one of the most attractive styles of football in Europe… the most attractive in Europe”.\n\nThat said, he later insisted that “I also think that at Barcelona they take so many risks… On a bad day for Pedri, Lamine Yamal or Raphinha, any team can hurt them and eliminate them from the Champions League.”",

    "fullText": "If you’ve ever refused to knock down a game’s difficulty level, or chased a purposefully pointless achievement, you might have this pernicious but pleasurable affliction\n\nDon’t get Pushing Buttons delivered to your inbox? \nStudies on gaming’s effect on the brain usually focus on aggression or the cognitive benefits of playing games. The former topic has fallen out of fashion now, after more than a decade’s worth of scientific research failed to prove any causative link between video games and real-world violence. But studies on the positive effects of games have shown that performing complex tasks with your brain and hands is actually quite good for you, and that games can be beneficial for your emotional wellbeing and stress management.\n\nThat’s all well and good, but I’m obsessed with the concept of “gamer brain” – that part of us that is drawn to objectively pointless achievements. Mastering a game or finishing a story are normal sources of motivation, but gamer brain is inexplicable. When you retry the same pointless mini-game over and over because you want to get a better high score? When you walk around the invisible boundaries of a level, clicking the mouse just in case something happens? When you stay with a game longer than you should because you feel compelled to unlock that trophy or achievement? When you refuse to knock the difficulty down a level on a particularly evil boss, because that would be letting the game win? That’s gamer brain.\n\nI am not sure whether games cause this very particular flavour of obstinacy, or whether people with obstinate tendencies are drawn to video games. But almost everyone I know who plays a lot of video games is susceptible to it. It’s the part of you that simply will not give in, the part of you that’s determined to bend a game’s rules to your will. The extreme version of it is learning to play impossible DragonForce songs from Guitar Hero at 2X speed, just because you can. Or everything that happens at Awesome Games Done Quick (AGDQ), marathons of joyful gaming pointlessness in which people take on increasingly esoteric challenges, such as playing The Legend of Zelda: Majora’s Mask blindfolded, or speeding through a cursed, modded version of Halo that’s full of random items from other games.\n\nIt was this year’s AGDQ, in fact, that got me thinking again about gamer brain, and why we love this stuff. But I also thought about it a lot while playing Baby Steps last year. It’s a game that embraces yet gently mocks the concept of gamer brain – not least through its main character, the useless Nate, who embodies a bunch of stereotypical gamer characteristics, including being totally unwilling to ask for help.\n\nTwo of its creators, Gabe Cuzillo and Bennett Foddy, told me a lot about this when we spoke in November. Baby Steps is full of moments that tease you, the player, into attempting ridiculous feats. At several points you’ll find big holes in the ground that you can purposefully fall into, just to see what happens (spoiler: nothing is ever down there). One character warns you away from a tower, telling you there’s no reason to climb it because there’s nothing at the top; of course, I immediately tried to climb the tower. Once, I spent 10 minutes inching my way up a river to a waterfall to see what was behind it; on the rocks behind the water was nothing but a crudely drawn penis.\n\n“There is a normal dirt path by a cliff that you can walk up perfectly safely, and then along the cliff is a series of wooden pegs that you could walk up instead, if you wanted to risk losing 20 minutes of progress,” says Foddy. “That’s a joke that you’re making with the player, because for them to find that funny, they have to know that they’re tempted to walk on the pegs. If the player didn’t feel anything about that other than, ‘Oh, that’s not the correct way to go, I won’t walk on those pegs’, then there’s no joke. But the player gets it because they do want to do the difficult thing.”\n\nThe most exquisite joke in all of Baby Steps, for me, comes when you find a pair of glasses that make invisible steps visible. If you decide to try to walk all the way across a bunch of rocky pillars to find these glasses, risking a fall at any moment that would waste perhaps an hour of your time, you will see a path of invisible steps that eventually lead to an invisible trophy. Nate will practically weep with joy in front of this trophy that nobody else can see, calling over a fellow hiker to admire it, who of course can only see Nate dancing around triumphantly in front of absolutely nothing.\n\n“The joke that we keep coming back to is when the player puts themselves in a particular psychological or emotional state and then Nate gets to reflect that in some way,” Foddy says. “You’re seeing yourself reflected in this loser. That’s the deep joke: this guy, this couch potato, he’s actually you in this moment.”\n\nCuzillo, who also voices Nate, has a chronic case of gamer brain. “Over time, we came around to this idea that a lot of the level design is an opportunity for introspection about why you’re playing the game at all, what kinds of rewards you’re attuned to and why you play games in general,” he says. “You’re asked as a player: What do you care about? Who are you as a person? If you don’t jump into the hole, you’re [left] wondering for the rest of the game about whether you should have jumped in the hole.”\n\nGamer brain is thought of as a masculine concept, though I can attest that you don’t have to be a man to suffer from it. “I think this is a gendered type of play, toxic masculine play, or at least it’s constructed as such,” Foddy says. “That stuff is riddled through gaming culture. It’s riddled through the kinds of characters that players are asked to embody. Nathan Drake in Uncharted is determined and full of grit, but is that the same thing as being obstinate and dogged and pursuing something stupid?”\n\nBaby Steps is one of those games that you can only truly appreciate if you have a bit of gamer brain in you. Trying to explain why it’s funny is close to impossible – you have to have some understanding of the compulsion and strange transcendence of pursuing pointless objectives. But here’s the key thing about gamer brain, and perhaps about games in general: these things aren’t pointless if they actually mean something to you.\n\nWhen I started Sword of the Sea last night and found myself surfing over dunes of tastefully rendered animated sand, I immediately thought of Journey. A lot of this game brings Journey to mind, from the art style and animation to the minimal demands that it makes of you as a player. But you know what? It’s been almost 15 years since that landmark PlayStation 3 game, and it’s been lovely to play something that channels its best moments. You swoosh around the desert, occasionally jumping, occasionally pressing square to make something happen, finding places where your magical sword can bring water back to your arid surroundings. After you’ve flooded the former desert, you surf around on the water instead, ocean creatures flitting around you. It is beautiful, mindful and soothing, if admittedly a little insubstantial; I have found it a comforting, achievable January play.\n\nAvailable on: PS5, PC\n\n Estimated playtime: 2-3 hours\n\nThis week I wrote about playing Hollow Knight: Silksong while living with a chronic pain condition; this beautiful, punishing game has become emblematic of a time when I was thinking a lot about the nature of suffering.\n\nLego’s take on Pokémon has finally been revealed, featuring a £579.99 Kanto evolutions set and a rather unfortunate-looking Pikachu. The Venusaur, Charizard and Blastoise set does look extremely cool, but I do wonder who has the money for incredibly expensive nerd nostalgia toys in this economy.\n\nRockstar Games employees who were dismissed last year in an alleged act of union busting have been fighting the company in court, supported by the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain. After a preliminary hearing in Glasgow last week, a judge has denied the workers’ request for interim relief, meaning that they will not be paid while the legal case is ongoing.\n\nThe 15 best Xbox Series S/X games to play in 2026\n\nThe 15 best Nintendo Switch 2 games to play in 2026\n\nFinal Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles – remastered 1997 classic is even more politically resonant now | ★★★★★\n\nPunchdrunk’s new mission: inside ‘live action video game’ Lander 23 – in pictures\n\nGames correspondent Keith Stuart answers this question, which came in from reader David on email:\n\nMy new year resolution is to cut down on Baldur’s Gate 3 and Battlefield and play a few more experimental indie games. But what’s the best way to find them?\n\n First of all, congratulations on deciding to expand your gaming intake. There’s nothing wrong with blockbuster games, but it’s really lovely to discover brand new – and sometimes incredibly weird – experiences. Aside from the Guardian’s regular indie recs, of course, the front page of digital video game store Itch.io is a good starting point – a lot of smaller developers put their new projects on there and it’s quite well curated. Steam also runs regular indie promotions, including an annual indie festival, and it’s worth watching the annual Indie Game awards, IndieCade and Games for Change for interesting titles. There are lots of review sites specialising in indie titles, too – for example, Indie Game Reviewer and John Walker’s Buried Treasure. Elsewhere, Bluesky is great for following indie developers – there are lots of lists and starter packs to join, which will give you instant access to indie communities. You can search Bluesky’s directory for suggestions. The good thing is, the more indie games you play, the more you get to know the developers and community, and the more new ones you discover.\n\nIf you’ve got a question for Question Block – or anything else to say about the newsletter – hit reply or email us on pushingbuttons@theguardian.com.",

    "fullText": "Finn Russell expects his Scotland teammates to come in with late hits and other nefarious tactics to “wind him up” when Bath host Edinburgh in their decisive Investec Champions Cup pool clash this weekend.\n\nBath welcome Edinburgh to the Rec on Friday evening in what is essentially a straight shootout for top spot in Pool 2, which would guarantee home games in the knockout rounds all the way until the semi-final.\n\nRussell, who began his career at Edinburgh’s bitter rivals Glasgow Warriors before moving to French side Racing 92 in 2018 and then to Bath five years later, will likely be pulling the strings at No 10 for the English side.\n\nMeanwhile, the Edinburgh squad is full of players he will be lining up alongside in three weeks’ time when Scotland travel to Rome to face Italy in their Six Nations opener, which the 33-year-old admits adds an extra layer of bragging rights to Friday’s contest.\n\n“I got a little bit off the Edinburgh players when we played them last season,” explained Russell. “It’s all good fun and all part of the game.\n\n“I played against Edinburgh a lot of times when I was at Glasgow and I’ve played with a lot of their players with Scotland. I know these boys from camp so well.\n\n“It’s always good fun playing against boys you know because there’s always bragging rights before the Six Nations. If they win or we win, we wind each other up. Hopefully we’ll get the win on Friday night. If not it’ll be quite a rough [Six Nations] camp.\n\n“I imagine there will be a couple of late shots, getting held on the ground - that kind of stuff, which is always the case against players you know.”\n\nRussell said he had already messaged star Edinburgh winger Duhan van der Merwe, warning him to expect a tough night, but knows that the Scottish side will prove a real challenge for high-flying Bath.\n\n“I’m not sure what the weather will be like but if it’s like it is now there’ll be a lot of balls going up in the air,” added Russell. “I’ve already texted Duhan to tell him to be ready.\n\n“Edinburgh will be coming down with everything to play for. They have had a great campaign in the Champions Cup so far. It’s going to be a big challenge for us and we know what’s coming. Hopefully we’ll do the job on Friday night and we’ve got bit of a plan for them.\n\n“This game could help us get a home play-off, so it’s not a knockout game but it’s one we want to win so we can put our best foot forward in the next round of the competition.”\n\nRussell led Bath to their first Prem title for almost 30 years last term, as well as the European Challenge Cup crown, but he’s eager for them to make waves in the top-tier European competition this time around.\n\nThe Blue, Black and Whites are going well domestically once more, sitting second in the Prem, although the fly half admits their has been a transition in switching from the highly-regarded Lee Blackett – who left to join the England coaching set-up – to Martin Gleeson as attack coach.\n\n“Since the November Tests we’ve spoken more about playing more expansively like we used to do last year and the year before,” Russell explained. “Lee and Glees have different views about how we can run an attack shape so we’ve been figuring out how we can adjust and what works best for people.\n\n“In the last few games we’ve gone slightly wider off 10. We have probably had more joy with that, focusing a little bit more on multi-phase and trying to take teams apart like that.”\n\n“With the forwards we’ve got why wouldn’t you use pick and go’s though. They’re so good at that. It’s definitely a strength of ours but as backs we’re looking to try and be more expansive as well. It’s about getting the balance right.”",

    "description": "The all-electric Toyota Hilux debuts in Europe with more specs to share as the world's first mass-produced midsize pickup truck.",
    "fullText": "The all-electric Hilux debuts in Europe with more specs to share.\n\nIn November of 2025, Toyota revealed the all-new ninth-gen Hilux and along with it, an all-electric version. Now, the automaker just unveiled the Euro-spec version and simultaneously, more detailed specifications.\n\nWhile the introduction of a new generation of the world’s most iconic and popular midsize pickup truck is big news, the bigger news is with the BEV (battery-electric vehicle) variant.\n\nIn addition to being the world’s first mass-produced midsize pickup EV, it’s also proof that Toyota’s not giving up on the controversial powertrain tech.\n\nWhen Toyota revealed the Hilux BEV, key highlights included a dual-electric motor setup with a 59.2 kilowatt-hour battery pack. Engineers said the system could churn out around 350 lb-ft of torque, though they didn’t go much further into detail.\n\nWith the new Euro version out, Toyota confirms the Hilux BEV’s motors produce 151 lb-ft at the front motor and 198 lb-ft at the rear, for a total of around 349 lb-ft of torque.\n\nThe result is a driving range of up to 159 miles on the WLTP rating in off-road conditions. But the distance can increase to up to 236 miles in urban conditions.\n\nIt can still tow and haul. But its payload and towing capacities are less than the diesel-powered version, which is due to the heavy weight of the electric powertrain gear.\n\nWith the more conventional turbo-diesel engine, the Hilux is capable of hauling up to 2,205 pounds and towing up to 7,720 pounds.\n\nBut with BEV, it can only haul up to 1,580 pounds and tow up to 3,350 pounds.\n\nElectric vehicles have recently dropped in both demand and desirability as their time on the market revealed many of their drawbacks. The hype around them dissipated so greatly that many automakers with aggressive electrification strategies pumped the brakes on their strategies.\n\nHowever, some, like Toyota, are still looking to keep electric power around for those who still want it. And the Hilux BEV marks a major stepping stone for the segment. Even if it is very much a small niche.\n\nWhile the specs are solid, they’re not shocking. For instance, many buyers, especially those who need to travel long distances, will find the Hilux BEV’s driving range underwhelming.\n\nBut according to Toyota, the Hilux BEV isn’t really aimed at private consumers who do a lot of driving. Rather, it’s meant for commercial and fleet uses with fixed travel routes.\n\nIn which case, the Hilux BEV may make a lot of sense.\n\nWant to stay up to date on the latest product news and releases? Add Gear Patrol as a preferred source to ensure our independent journalism makes it to the top of your Google search results.",

    "fullText": "Elon Musk's Starlink has gained yet another airline customer as the ultra-high-speed WiFi service continues to gain popularity.\n\nThe Lufthansa Group announced in January that it's installing Starlink and expects to start offering it in the second half of this year.\n\nThe company is named for the German flag carrier, but it also owns several more airlines across Europe, including national carriers for Austria, Belgium, Italy, and Switzerland.\n\nLufthansa has a fleet of around 850 aircraft across all its airlines, and its announcement means more than 30 airlines are now set to have Starlink.\n\nBusiness Insider previously tested Starlink on Qatar Airways' first flight with it last October. The connection speed peaked at 215 megabits per second, more than enough for a lag-free video call, and faster than many cable-based internet services.\n\nStarlink functions thanks to a constellation of over 7,000 satellites, which allows internet connections in remote locations, such as flying over an ocean. The satellites are in low-earth orbit, which means faster internet speeds — but also disrupts astronomers.\n\nStarlink isn't the only game in town, however.\n\nJetBlue has signed up for Amazon Leo, which functions similarly, but has only launched 150 satellites so far.\n\nAnother in-flight WiFi rival is Viasat, which is used by Delta Air Lines and American Airlines. It only has a handful of satellites in a geostationary orbit, which have a longer time delay.\n\nWhile it has rivals, Starlink wants to cement its dominance.

    "fullText": "\"Do you think there is a heaven?\" my 99-year-old grandma, who was a devout Catholic, asked me one of the last times I saw her alive. It was June of 2019, and my mom and I had driven south to Dyersburg, TN, to visit her in the long-term care facility she had only recently been admitted to. This was a woman who had driven until she was 88 and lived independently since my grandfather died 10 years earlier at 91.\n\nGrandma was part of the Greatest Generation, prayed the rosary, and watched the Catholic channel daily on her 20-inch television. Every time we spoke on the phone, she would ask, \"Did you go to church today?\" She lived her faith by example.\n\nShe loved to play competitive card games and have an occasional sip of blackberry brandy as a nightcap. The fire and spunk I saw in her eyes when she sheepishly challenged me about an afterlife was a new side of her I began to see years earlier as we both grew older. I was in awe that she was both willing and able to question her faith in her tenth decade of life.\n\n\"There's no shame in being afraid,\" she once said to me. It was spring 2002, and her words caught me off guard. Relief was the initial feeling. I thought, \"Oh, now you tell me.\" I had spent my life running from my anxious nature, and her words were freeing. She was my maternal grandmother and would be called GGMa by my nieces and nephew, yet to be born.\n\nThe daughter of Lithuanian immigrants, she had grown up on a farm in central Illinois, and her life had been shaped by hardship, resilience, and a little mystery. She had always been a stoic taskmaster when she came to stay with my younger sister, brother, and me — and harder to get close to when we were kids. With these words, she conveyed a soothing wisdom I had never heard from her before.\n\nDespite GGMa's disciplined nature, she also had a wry sense of humor. Both she and my grandfather — who was quicker with a gentle smile and a joke— instilled a sense of joy and laughter in their three girls, which they passed on to my cousins, siblings, and me. Because I had missed the later years of my paternal grandmother's life due to college and travel, I was making an effort to spend time with my maternal grandparents. That they would live into their nineties was a gift.\n\nBack in Dyersburg, TN, I replied, \"I'd like to think there is a heaven, Grandma.\" I appreciated and even admired her blind faith and the respect she had for her small-town priest, who visited her regularly in long-term care. My reply was honest and my own, someone deeply spiritual but skeptical about how the Catholic rulebook she followed played out.\n\nWanting to get GGMa out of bed during our visit, I instigated an outing into the summer sunshine for a change of scenery. I had fun wheeling her through the rehab center while she directed me toward a door to escape the stale air, despite the staff's dedication to cleanliness. In the last picture I took of her, she wears my Maui Jim sunglasses, the midday sun on her face, and looks as much like herself as ever.\n\nWhen I arrived to visit her for the last time, she was sitting up on her knees in bed like a teenager, singing a hymn, smiling, and waving in rhythm toward the ceiling. She looked 30 years younger and was in a trance-like state, clearly communicating with someone. It was beautiful to watch, and I believe she received her answer about heaven.\n\nThinking about our last days together, I wonder if Grandma asked me about heaven less to question her own faith and instead, to encourage me to explore my own. If heaven truly does exist, she is definitely in it. What is certain is that I benefited deeply from the time we spent together as adults, and I'm grateful I made time to get to know her as the woman she was: faithful, fun, stubborn, anxious, and strong.",

    "fullText": "Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship and Bare Knuckle Fight League are making their official entry into India, marking a significant expansion into one of the world’s largest combat sports markets.\n\nThe move is being spearheaded by World League of Fighters, BKFC’s license holder, which is co-founded by Rajesh Banga, Sunil Mathew and Siraj Gill. The organization has brought in prominent film producer Parag Sanghvi and Bollywood star and martial artist Tiger Shroff to join the board alongside BKFC founder and president David Feldman and former two-division UFC champion Conor McGregor, who became a part-owner of BFKC in 2024.\n\nMiss Universe Harnaaz Sandhu Joins Tiger Shroff, Sanjay Dutt in 'Baaghi 4' - Global Bulletin\n\nNetflix, Amazon Prime, ZEE5, SonyLIV Vie for India's IFFI Streaming Honor - Global Bulletin\n\nFox Orders Lifeguard Drama Series 'Rescue: Hi-Surf' from Producer John Wells (TV News Roundup)\n\nWLF previously delivered a sold-out BKFC event in Dubai last year, which the organization describes as the biggest bare-knuckle fighting event held in the Middle East.\n\nThe India expansion will introduce a team-based bare-knuckle league format – marking the first time such a structure has been implemented in the history of the sport. The format will feature six inaugural teams: Crushers, Punishers, Warriors, Phantoms, Gladiators and Infernos, transforming individual fights into a franchise-based competition.\n\nRahul Saxena has been appointed CEO to lead the platform. He brings experience in scaling global brands to the role.\n\n“India is not just a market – it is the future of global combat sports,” Banga, Mathew and Gill said in a joint statement. “Together with BKFC, BKFL and WLF, we are building an ecosystem that will develop Indian fighters, create global stars and deliver world-class fight entertainment to millions of fans.”\n\nSanghvi positioned the venture as an opportunity to build a sports intellectual property from India with global reach. “This is where world-class storytelling meets raw, uncompromising sport,” he said. “With WLF, BKFC and Conor McGregor, we are not just launching a league – we are architecting a global sports IP from India that will command attention, talent and fandom worldwide.”\n\nFeldman emphasized India’s longstanding position in the organization’s expansion strategy. “India has been on our roadmap for a long time,” he said. “The scale, the energy, the culture — there is no place like it. With the leadership team we have assembled and our partnership with WLF, we are bringing the purest form of combat sports to a nation ready for it.”\n\nMcGregor, who serves as a global partner for BKFC, framed the expansion as transformative. “India has warriors in its DNA,” he said. “What we’re building with BKFC and BKFL in India will be something the world has never seen before. This is not just expansion – this is a revolution.”\n\nShroff, joining McGregor as a board member, highlighted the cultural significance of the venture. “Honored to stand alongside Conor McGregor as we create something truly historic for Indian sport,” he said. “This is more than a fight – it’s a global movement, and history is being written. Just like cinema, sport is a celebration of talent and skill, and Parag [Sanghvi] and I are committed to turning this into a landmark moment for India.”\n\nThe first official BKFC and BKFL team-based events are scheduled for 2026, with venue and fight card details to be announced.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\n\nOscar Predictions: Original Screenplay — With Few Signals, 'Sinners' Takes an Early Lead\n\nOscar Predictions: ‘Sinners’ Could Shatter the All-Time Nomination Record as International Films Hope for Recognition\n\nNew Movies Out Now in Theaters: What to See This Week",

    "description": "With \"Avatar: Fire & Ash,\" Zoe Saldaña has passed Scarlett Johansson as the highest-grossing actor of all time at the global box office.",
    "fullText": "Since going Hollywood in the early 2000s after a sensational pro wrestling career at the WWE, Johnson has gradually built up his box office tally. But the ticket sales got as big as his biceps when he joined the \"Fast and Furious\" franchise with 2011's \"Fast Five.\"\n\nAlong with helping \"Fast\" entries like 2015's \"Furious 7\" and 2017's \"The Fate of the Furious\" each earn over $1 billion at the worldwide box office, he's also scored other big hits like the \"Moana\" and \"Jumanji\" franchises.\n\nAs Captain America, Evans is attached to some of the biggest box office earners of all time, including 2019's \"Avengers: Endgame,\" which is the second-highest-grossing movie of all time at the worldwide box office with over $2.7 billion.\n\nSince then, he's shown up in box office hits like \"Free Guy\" (just a quick cameo, but it still counts) and 2024's \"Deadpool & Wolverine.\"\n\nExpect him to rise up this list with him reprising his role as Captain America in \"Avengers: Doomsday\" coming out at the end of the year.\n\nAs the star in all 10 movies in the \"Fast\" franchise, Vin Diesel is a major part of its over $7 billion take.\n\nDiesel has also scored big as the voice of Groot in the \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" franchise.\n\nAs the face of the Thor franchise, Hemsworth has helped it earn close to $3 billion at the worldwide box office. As a member of \"The Avengers\" franchise, he's also been a part of the close to $8 billion those movies have grossed.\n\nMost recently, he starred in the hit \"Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga.\" He will also be \"Avengers: Doomsday.\"\n\nRegarded as one of the last true movie stars, Cruise was topping box office charts long before most on this list had their first screen credit.\n\nNow in his 60s, Cruise is proving he's still got it as the latest (and perhaps final) \"Mission: Impossible\" movie, \"The Final Reckoning,\" is going strong in theaters, earning half a billion dollars worldwide. That adds to its already impressive tally of close to $5 billion for the eight-movie franchise.\n\nThere's also talk of a third \"Top Gun\" movie after the franchise was revived in 2020 with \"Top Gun: Maverick,\" which brought in $1.4 billion.\n\nWho knew the jokester from \"Parks and Recreation\" would become such a huge box office draw?\n\nFrom playing Star-Lord in the \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" movies (and several other Marvel releases), a lovable Lego figure in the \"The Lego Movie\" franchise, the hero in the \"Jurassic World\" movies, and the voice of Mario in \"The Super Mario Bros. Movie,\" Pratt's hard work has paid off.\n\nBelieve it or not, there was a time when Hollywood wanted nothing to do with Robert Downey Jr.\n\nIn the early 2000s, Downey Jr.'s years of drug use and brushes with the law caught up with him. After spending a year at a court-ordered drug-treatment facility, he was broke and virtually unhireable.\n\nThen he got the offer that led to his comeback: the titular role in 2008's \"Iron Man.\"\n\nWith that, Downey Jr. became the face of the lucrative Marvel Cinematic Universe, which has grossed over $31 billion worldwide to date.\n\nAfter ending his run as Iron Man with 2019's \"Avengers: Endgame,\" the second-highest-grossing movie of all time, he's returning to the MCU as the villain Doctor Doom in \"Avengers: Doomsday.\"\n\nIf there has ever been a blueprint for success in the modern-day movie business, it would be Sam Jackson's filmography.\n\nFrom \"Star Wars\" to the MCU to Pixar's hit \"The Incredibles,\" the actor has been a staple of box-office sensations for decades — and let's not forget all the memorable roles he's played in movies from Spike Lee and Quentin Tarantino.\n\nThis is why he was No. 1 on this list for so many years.\n\nSince showing up as Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow in 2010's \"Iron Man 2,\" Johansson has upped her box office game.\n\nAlong with being a fixture in the MCU as a member of The Avengers, she also found big box office dollars starring in movies like \"The Jungle Book\" and \"Sing.\"\n\nAs the face of the latest hit movie in the \"Jurassic Park\" franchise, \"Jurassic World Rebirth,\" which took in close to $870 million at the worldwide box office, Johansson was tops on this list.\n\nThis recent Oscar winner has been on a box office hot streak for years.\n\nBetween playing Uhura in the \"Star Trek\" franchise, Gamora in the \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" movies, and Neytiri in the epic \"Avatar\" films, Saldaña's role choices have been impeccable.\n\nReturning as Neytiri in James Cameron's 2025 hit \"Avatar: Fire & Ash,\" which has scored over $1 billion at the global box office, has placed her as the current highest-grossing actor.",

    "title": "Despite his $2.6 billion net worth, MrBeast says he’s having to borrow cash and doesn’t even have enough money in his bank account to buy McDonald’s",
    "description": "Jimmy Donaldson, the world’s most popular YouTuber and founder of $5 billion business Beast Industries, claims he doesn’t “technically” have enough money to buy McDonald’s in the morning.",
    "fullText": "Some successful entrepreneurs sitting atop billion-dollar businesses say they may look rich on paper, but take a peek into their bank accounts, and they’re actually cash poor. Social media mogul Jimmy Donaldson, known to his 460 million YouTube followers as MrBeast, claims he’s just as broke as everyone else despite running a $5 billion entertainment empire.\n\n“I’m borrowing money. That’s how little money I have,” Donaldson told the Wall Street Journal earlier this month. “Technically, everyone watching this video has more money than me in their bank account if you subtract the equity value of my company, which doesn’t buy me McDonald’s in the morning.”\n\nThe 27-year-old entrepreneur has said that he keeps less than $1 million for himself, despite being a billionaire and owning more than half of his $5 billion company Beast Industries. Aside from his nine-figure Amazon deal and popular YouTube channel with 107 billion lifetime views, Donaldson hit the ultra-rich club—at least on paper—from a slew of successful businesses. He’s launched ventures including multimillion-dollar chocolate brand Feastables; Lunchly, a Lunchables-esque packaged food product; MrBeast Burger, a virtual restaurant that only allows for pickup and drop-off; and production company MrBeast LLC, which helps manufacture his viral videos.\n\nThrough his assets, Donaldson is projected to be worth at least $2.6 billion—although he emphasized it’s not a fat wad of cash burning a hole in his pocket. Forbes has also estimated that his annual earnings reached $85 million between April 2024 and April 2025, a far cry from the typical American salary of $62,088 a year. However, that doesn’t mean he’s splurging on luxuries and only flying private. Donaldson claimed he’s actually in the red.\n\n“It’s funny talking about my personal finances, because no one ever believes anything I say,” Donaldson explained. “They’re like, ‘You’re a billionaire!’ I’m like, ‘That’s net worth.’ I have negative money right now.”\n\n“I wake up, I just work…I’m just so busy working I don’t really think about my personal bank account,” Donaldson continued. “I’m just laser-focused on making the greatest videos as possible, and building the business as big as possible.”\n\nDonaldson rakes in eight-figure earnings and runs a $5 billion business, yet still claims to be broke. So where is all of his money going? Right back into his business ventures, the YouTube star says.\n\n“I personally have very little money because I reinvest everything (I think this year we’ll spend around a quarter of a billion on content). Ironically I’m actually borrowing $ from my mom to pay for my upcoming wedding,” Donaldson wrote on X in response to a post heralding him as the only billionaire under 30 who didn’t inherit their wealth.",

    "fullText": "Joao Pedro’s window at Chelsea is closing, and the next few games will tell us a lot about his short term future.\n\nHe came in with a big impact at the Club World Cup, and gave everyone the hope that Chelsea’s striker troubles were over. But as time has passed, it’s become clear that he prefers to play as a number ten.\n\nThat’s all well and good. The problem is that Chelsea already have plenty of number tens. There’s an argument they have too many, even without the Brazil star. Meanwhile, they’re pretty short up front.\n\nLiam Delap has missed most of the season injured, and has only just scored his first Premier League goal a week ago. Yet as far as we can see, he’s ahead of JP in the pecking order for Liam Rosenior. Delap may not score, but he puts himself about. That’s more than you can say for Joao Pedro at the moment.\n\nJoao Pedro protests a decision against Arsenal. (Photo by Ryan Pierse/Getty Images)\n\nWith Enzo Fernandez, Andrey Santos, Cole Palmer and even Estevao Willian pushing for minutes at 10, and Delap a better option up top, JP is looking a little lost right now. Rotation and injuries will always mean he’s in line for fairly regular action, especially off the bench where he provides a good option.\n\nBut right now, it’s hard to imagine him being considered first choice. He’s got 18 Premier League starts and 3 sub appearances, so he’s featured in every game so far this season. We doubt that record is going to continue.\n\nWest Ham are circling around the drain of the Premier League, and are getting desperate for solutions. They’re now sniffing around a player who Chelsea don’t even use.\n\nCole Palmer had his annus mirabilis under Mauricio Pochettino rather than Enzo Maresca and the stats show it clearly – but how much of that was actually down to the coaches?",

The 27-year-old Belgian international centre-back has joined the club on loan from Leicester City Football Club until the end of the season, with an option to buy.\n\nAfter spells in the Belgian and English leagues, notably in the Premier League, Belgian international Wout Faes, with 28 caps, is set to make his return to Ligue 1 with AS Monaco, a championship he knows well, having previously played there with Stade de Reims from 2020 to 2022.\n\nBorn in Mol, Belgium, on 3 April 1998, Wout Faes completed his youth development in his home country. He began at KVV Rauw Sport Mol (2003–2006), before continuing at Lierse SK (2006–2012), and then at RSC Anderlecht, where he signed his first professional contract in 2016.\n\nThe following year, he made his professional debut with SC Heerenveen in the Netherlands, before joining Excelsior Rotterdam for the 2017–2018 season, during which he made 20 appearances. He then moved to KV Ostende (Belgian First Division), where he played 64 matches and scored two goals between 2018 and 2020.\n\nIn the summer of 2020, Wout Faes joined France and Stade de Reims. Wearing the “Rémois” shirt, he established himself as a key figure in defence, making 77 appearances in all competitions and scoring five goals. Since the summer of 2022, Wout Faes has been playing for Leicester City. With the “Foxes”, the 1.87 m centre-back discovered the Premier League (65 matches, 2 goals, 2 assists) and the Championship (58 matches, 3 goals, 1 assist).\n\nHis performances earned him a place in the Belgian national team. Having represented his country at all youth levels, he now has 28 caps for “les Diables Rouges” and took part in the 2022 World Cup as well as UEFA Euro 2024.\n\nWout Faes will now be playing under the colours of AS Monaco with the number 25.",

    "description": "When my partner and I broke up right before our international trip we'd planned together, I'm glad I decided to go anyway and make it a solo trip.",
    "fullText": "My boyfriend of two and a half years broke the long silence with the question we were both wondering: \"Are we still going?\"\n\nWe were supposed to be driving to the airport to leave for our five-day trip to Lisbon. Instead, we'd had an argument over the phone that morning that left me questioning how we'd even make it through a flight, let alone an international trip.\n\nOur relationship had been rocky for quite some time, but our travel plans were fast approaching, and I didn't want to give them up. The good news is we were flying standby, so our tickets were 100% refundable.\n\n\"You don't want to go?\" I asked. \"I can cancel your ticket right now.\"\n\nTurns out, he didn't think it was a good idea to still travel together — but, hey, I love a solo trip. We split. I kept my plane ticket.\n\nMy adrenaline was high and my heart was racing, but I ultimately felt relieved as I drove to the Boston airport alone, and boarded my flight.\n\nI cried a few times during the flight, but I couldn't stop smiling when I heard the pilot say, \"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Lisbon.\"\n\nI was so proud of myself for making it there alone — and, from there, the trip was surprisingly smooth.\n\nSince I'd used my credit-card points to book our hotel room, it was already in my name. I'd planned our whole itinerary myself anyway, so I just followed it on my own.\n\nThough I shed a few more tears while coping with our breakup, I found exploring a new country was a wonderful way to clear my mind.\n\nOver the next few days, I wandered around Lisbon's many viewpoints, ate amazing food, drank great wine, and even made some friends.\n\nWhile at a café, two girls noticed I was by myself and asked me to join their table. We spent over an hour divulging our life stories to each other.\n\nThe next day, I went on a guided excursion to Sintra, a beautiful town about 30 minutes away from Lisbon. At the beginning of the tour, a woman and her niece started chatting with me, and asked if I was alone.\n\nWhen I told them about the breakup, they decided to \"adopt\" me. We spent the day together hiking to Pena Palace (the town's colorful castle on a hill) and exploring the local shops.\n\nThroughout the trip, I couldn't stop thinking about how much happier I was than if I had come with my boyfriend. I got to enjoy the city at my own pace, without worrying about keeping the peace in my unstable relationship.\n\nFortunately, solo travel was not a new concept for me.\n\nNo matter my relationship status, I've always made time to travel on my own and, as a flight attendant, it comes naturally. It's nice to not have to worry about anyone else's budget or availability — I can just go where I want, when I want.\n\nTraveling solo was so in-character for me that when I posted about it on my Instagram, the only people who realized anything was wrong (or that I was fresh out of a relationship) were the ones I'd told.\n\nLater on, my friends told me they were proud of me for choosing to go on the trip alone. However, not going was never an option to me.\n\nIf I hadn't already been comfortable with traveling solo, I probably wouldn't have had the guts to go to Portugal by myself, and I would've missed out on what became an amazing, healing trip.\n\nHonestly, I'd encourage everyone to try solo travel, regardless of their relationship status. Navigating a new place on your own is a huge confidence boost and the best way to get to know yourself.",

    "fullText": "LONDON, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Global oil trading houses have emerged as early winners in the race to control Venezuelan crude flows, getting ahead of U.S. energy majors wary of credit and legal risks and securing a potentially lucrative business opportunity in the country with the world's largest crude reserves.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump said U.S. majors would invest billions of dollars in Venezuela to quickly rebuild its dilapidated oil sector following the U.S. ​capture of President Nicolas Maduro earlier in January. Trump met top oil executives at the White House on Friday as his administration outlines a long-term plan to raise $100 billion to boost Venezuelan oil output.\n\nThe first companies to secure any business in the wake ‌of the U.S. military action in Caracas, however, were Dutch-based trader Vitol and Singapore-headquartered peer Trafigura, rather than U.S. majors.\n\nThe U.S. government tapped the giant merchant houses because they were better suited to quickly get Venezuelan oil exports flowing again, four industry sources familiar with the negotiations said. That is the first order of business for Washington before reconstruction ‌can begin, so that revenue from exports under U.S. supervision can fund the government of interim President Delcy Rodriguez in Caracas.\n\n\"Securing and marketing the initial barrels of Venezuelan crude oil was done at record speed to benefit both the American and Venezuelan people,\" a White House official told Reuters.\n\nVenezuela relies on oil exports for revenue, and has been starved of those proceeds for about a month under a blockade Trump imposed as he raised pressure on Maduro.\n\nWashington and Caracas are finalizing a $2 billion deal to sell up to 50 million barrels of crude to U.S. refiners and other buyers - oil that had been stuck on ships in Venezuelan waters and in storage tanks because of the blockade.\n\nFacilitating the initial oil sales was critical to ensure funds could flow back into Venezuela for everyday services and a process is in place to maintain the steady flow of production, sales, and refining of Venezuelan crude oil, the ⁠White House official said.\n\nTrafigura and Vitol have secured preliminary special licenses to negotiate and export the ‌Venezuelan crude, and Trafigura is set to load its first cargo this week, Chief Executive Richard Holtum said at the White House meeting with Trump.\n\nGLOBAL NETWORK ADDED TO TRADERS' APPEAL\n\nThe trading houses competed with Chevron to secure the supply deals. Chevron is the only U.S. oil major that operates in Venezuela, as a minority partner in joint ventures with Venezuelan state oil firm PDVSA. Chevron has a license from U.S. authorities, which exempts it from ‍the sanctions the United States had imposed to choke off oil revenues to Maduro.",

    "fullText": "The world’s first tuned Chevrolet C8 Corvette ZR1 has officially hit the dyno, and the results are already eye-opening. In a development video published by Burger Motorsports, the company behind the JB4PRO and JB4 tuning modules, the twin-turbo Corvette delivered over 1,000 wheel horsepower in completely stock form on 93-octane pump gas. Baseline runs showed approximately 1,010 wheel horsepower and 815 lb-ft of torque, confirming just how aggressive the factory calibration is on Chevrolet’s most powerful production Corvette to date.\n\nThe testing also highlighted how carefully the ZR1 has been engineered by General Motors. Peak boost reached roughly 20 psi at low rpm before tapering to about 17 psi up top, with stable air-fuel ratios and turbo shaft speeds hovering around 120,000 rpm.\n\nEven before tuning, the data suggested there was limited, but usable, headroom for additional power if approached with detailed sensor monitoring and conservative boost control. Suddenly, the Ford Mustang GTD because even more insecure.\n\nBurger Motorsports used its JB4PRO system for development, selected for its ability to intercept and analyze up to 40 sensor inputs, including digital MAF signals, turbo shaft speed, and both high- and low-pressure fuel data. Installation proved challenging due to the Corvette’s mid-engine layout, but once wired, the system provided the level of data access needed to safely adjust boost and fueling on the seemingly underestimated LT7 twin-turbo engine.\n\nWith JB4PRO Map 1 on 93-octane pump gas, output increased to 1,048 wheel horsepower and 896 lb-ft of torque, nearly a 50-horsepower gain with no hardware changes. Switching to an E30 blend and Map 2 pushed output past 1,060 wheel horsepower and 943 lb-ft, while mid-range gains exceeded 150 wheel horsepower. Burger Motorsports emphasized that these gains came from controlled adjustments, not aggressive peak-boost spikes.\n\nView the 3 images of this gallery on the original article\n\nThe highest numbers came with JB4PRO Map 3 running on 100-octane race fuel. Under those conditions, the C8 ZR1 produced approximately 1,170 wheel horsepower and 980 lb-ft of torque. While peak output increased by about 100 wheel horsepower over stock, the most significant improvement occurred in the mid-range, where the tuned setup showed more than 220 additional wheel horsepower at 6,000 rpm.\n\nAccording to Burger Motorsports, multiple JB4PRO maps will be offered to support different fuel types, ranging from conservative 91-octane setups to race-gas configurations. Early testing confirms that the C8 ZR1 is not only historically powerful out of the box, but also capable of safely delivering supercar-level gains with minimal tuning, setting the stage for far more extreme builds to follow.\n\nView the 3 images of this gallery on the original article",

    "description": "As the man behind the 1984 L.A. Olympics soccer tournament and the 1994 World Cup, Alan Rothenberg arguably had more to do with writing the story of modern U.S. Soccer than anyone.",
    "fullText": "Alan Rothenberg has a story he wants to tell you. A lot of stories actually; enough to fill a book.\n\nBut that’s not the first memorable work he’s authored. As the man behind the 1984 L.A. Olympics soccer tournament and the 1994 World Cup, still the most successful in history, Rothenberg has arguably had more to do with writing the story of U.S. Soccer in the modern era than anyone.\n\nAnd you can draw a straight line from that chapter to the one that will be written this summer when the World Cup returns to the U.S.\n\n“The turning point really was the Olympics,” he said last month over brunch in a crowded Sherman Oaks diner. “That soccer was so successful in the Olympics, that’s when FIFA thought maybe we could bring our crown jewel to the United States and not be embarrassed.\n\n“So ‘84 Olympics. That’s a crucial part of the story. I doubt that we would be where we are now but for that.”\n\nThat story’s in “The Big Bounce: The Surge That Shaped the Future of U.S. Soccer,” which is available Feb. 10. In fact, the book starts there.\n\nBut Rothenberg’s career did not. Before changing the face of U.S. Soccer, he first altered the landscape of sports in his adopted hometown, playing instrumental roles in bringing the Clippers to Los Angeles, in negotiating the trade that made Kareem Abdul-Jabbar a Laker and in settling the Kings at the Forum.\n\nAs a lawyer who started his career as the in-house counsel for Jack Kent Cooke when Cooke owned the Lakers, the Kings, the then-Washington Redskins and was launching the Wolves of the nascent NASL, Rothenberg was involved in some of the most consequential events in four sports during a career that’s nearing the end of its sixth decade. Yet he knew little about soccer when Peter Ueberroth, chair of the L.A. Olympic Organizing Committee, put him in charge of the sport for the 1984 Games.\n\n“Peter assumed with that background I must know a lot about soccer,” Rothenberg writes. “That was wrong.”\n\nWhat he lacked in soccer knowledge he more than made up for in creativity and organization skills, however, and the Olympic tournament proved to be one of the most successful in history, with the final at the Rose Bowl drawing a crowd of 104,098, a U.S. record for a soccer game that stood for 30 years.\n\nBut his name will forever be synonymous with the World Cup.\n\nThe 1994 tournament was the first to be played in a country without a first-division league and there were widespread fears it would be a disaster. Instead, it drew an average of 69,174 fans to each of the 52 games, an attendance record that still stands. It also generated a surplus of more than $50 million — also a record — money that went to the U.S. Soccer Foundation to promote the growth of the sport in the U.S.\n\nTwo years later, Major League Soccer kicked off; 30 years later it’s the sixth-most-valuable soccer league in the world.\n\n“Everything flowed from ‘94,” Rothenberg said. “If ‘94 had not been successful, including if our [U.S.] team hadn’t been credible, I’m not sure how quickly things would have developed. Certainly we wouldn’t have been able to start Major League Soccer at that time if the World Cup wasn’t successful.”\n\nAnother rarely discussed — but hugely important — legacy of that tournament is the foundation it created in terms of experience and expertise. The U.S. had never staged a major standalone soccer competition before 1994 and the learning curve was steep. Among those who worked under Rothenberg and went on to great success in the sport were Sunil Gulati, a three-term president of U.S. Soccer; Nelson Rodriguez, now MLS executive vice-president; Marla Messing, who headed the organizing committee for the 1999 Women’s World Cup and was later interim commissioner of the NWSL; Tom King, U.S. Soccer’s longtime managing director of administration; Kathy Carter, the former executive vice-president of Soccer United Marketing and chief executive officer of U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Properties; and Charlie Stillitano, a former MLS general manager who pioneered the idea of inviting major European clubs to play summer friendlies in the U.S.\n\n“It's not just that the event [came] off. Look what came out of it,” said Scott LeTellier, who as managing director and chief operating officer had responsibility for day-to-day operations of the World Cup organizing committee for 1994. “All the people who worked on our committee, who had some role that now are general managers of MLS teams. The league itself that came out of it. The number of soccer facilities. We didn't have a single soccer specific-stadium in the country.\n\n“You can argue that the ‘94 World Cup was really the linchpin to that entire explosion in the sport.”\n\nThat tournament was ahead of its time in other ways too. It was the first to stage fan fests in host cities, the first to include musical performers at the final and the first to offer hospitality packages with the price of a ticket. It also featured a lavish opening ceremony, one that featured Diana Ross, Oprah Winfrey and President Clinton, turning what was just a soccer tournament into a global spectacle.\n\nThe World Cup hasn’t been the same since, with FIFA’s revenue growing to a projected $13 billion for the 2026 cycle. There are more than 40 countries that don’t have an economy that large.\n\nAs Rothenberg notes in his book, FIFA originally pushed back on many of the innovations he proposed, including a halftime show at the final, only to eventually adopt the ideas as their own. Rothenberg also wanted to charge $1,000 a ticket for the final in 1994, arguing that fans would pay that on the secondary market, so why let the scalpers make the profit?\n\n“They were horrified,” he said. “You realize what a dramatic statement it would make if you had a $100-million gate?”\n\nThey do now; the cheapest regular tickets for the final of this summer’s tournament start at $2,000.\n\nRothenberg said he’s still thinking of other ways to improve the tournament, such as expanding the field to 64 teams and doing away with the group stage, making the World Cup like the NCAA basketball tournament.\n\n“I know I’m off the charts on this one,” he said. “Single elimination. It’s exciting start to finish.”\n\nAt 86, Rothenberg is still active, making regular trips to his office at 1st Century Bank, the community bank he founded in 2004 at an age when most people were entering retirement. And he promises to be a presence at this summer’s World Cup.\n\nAs for whether he gets the credit he deserves for making that tournament possible, Rothenberg demurs.\n\n“I didn’t do it for credit,” he says, speaking about both the World Cup and the book that explains how it happened. “All I can say is I’m proud of what I did.”\n\n⚽ You have read the latest installment of On Soccer with Kevin Baxter.

    "description": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth says Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence chatbot Grok will join Google’s AI engine inside the Pentagon network.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Monday that Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence chatbot Grok will join Google’s generative AI engine in operating inside the Pentagon network, as part of a broader push to feed as much of the military’s data as possible into the developing technology.\n\n“Very soon we will have the world’s leading AI models on every unclassified and classified network throughout our department,” Hegseth said in a speech at Musk’s space flight company, SpaceX, in South Texas.\n\nThe announcement comes just days after Grok — which is embedded into X, the social media network owned by Musk — drew global outcry and scrutiny for generating highly sexualized deepfake images of people without their consent.\n\nMalaysia and Indonesia have blocked Grok, while the U.K.’s independent online safety watchdog announced an investigation Monday. Grok has limited image generation and editing to paying users.\n\nHegseth said Grok will go live inside the Defense Department later this month and announced that he would “make all appropriate data” from the military’s IT systems available for “AI exploitation.” He also said data from intelligence databases would be fed into AI systems.\n\nHegseth’s aggressive push to embrace the still-developing technology stands in contrast to the Biden administration, which, while pushing federal agencies to come up with policies and uses for AI, was also wary of misuse. Officials said rules were needed to ensure that the technology, which could be harnessed for mass surveillance, cyberattacks or even lethal autonomous devices, was being used responsibly.\n\nThe Biden administration enacted a framework in late 2024 that directed national security agencies to expand their use of the most advanced AI systems but prohibited certain uses, such as applications that would violate constitutionally protected civil rights or any system that would automate the deployment of nuclear weapons. It is unclear if those prohibitions are still in place under the Trump administration.\n\nDuring his speech, Hegseth spoke of the need to streamline and speed up technological innovations within the military, saying, “We need innovation to come from anywhere and evolve with speed and purpose.”\n\nHe noted that the Pentagon possesses “combat-proven operational data from two decades of military and intelligence operations.”\n\n“AI is only as good as the data that it receives, and we’re going to make sure that it’s there,” Hegseth said.\n\nThe defense secretary said he wants AI systems within the Pentagon to be responsible, though he went on to say he was shrugging off any AI models “that won’t allow you to fight wars.”\n\nHegseth said his vision for military AI systems means that they operate “without ideological constraints that limit lawful military applications,” before adding that the Pentagon’s “AI will not be woke.”\n\nMusk developed and pitched Grok as an alternative to what he called “woke AI” interactions from rival chatbots like Google’s Gemini or OpenAI’s ChatGPT. In July, Grok also caused controversy after it appeared to make antisemitic comments that praised Adolf Hitler and shared several antisemitic posts.\n\nThe Pentagon did not immediately respond to questions about the issues with Grok.",

    "fullText": "Despite internet blackout, a small number of Iranians are risking their lives to share messages as protests continue\n\nFor most of Iran, the internet was shut off on Thursday afternoon – the most severe blackout the country has seen in years of internet shutdowns, coming after days of escalating anti-government protests.\n\nFor a very small sliver of the country, it is still possible to get photos and videos to the outside world, and even to make calls. The Telegram channel Vahid Online on Monday posted photos of dead bodies lying next to a street in Kahrizak, on the southern outskirts of Tehran; on Sunday, it shared a video of Iranians chanting “death to Khamenei” at a funeral.\n\nSome of these videos and messages are transmitted through an ecosystem of online tools designed to bypass censorship – among them Telegram proxies, a decentralised messaging service called Delta Chat, and a browser called Ceno, said Amir Rashidi, an Iranian digital rights expert.\n\nThere are about 50,000 Starlink terminals now in Iran, said Rashidi; other reports put this number at up to 100,000. The users of the service – which is part of Elon Musk’s SpaceX – are a tiny fraction of Iran’s overall population of more than 90 million people.\n\nWhile multiple people – even a whole apartment block – might be able to connect to the internet via a single Starlink terminal, the number of total users in the entire country is at most in the hundreds of thousands, said Doug Madory, the director of internet analysis at Kentik, a network observability and intelligence platform.\n\nThey hold Iran’s last tenuous link to the outside world. Very little information, at least electronically, appears to be leaving the country, except for minimal traffic from businesses and individuals whitelisted by the regime.\n\nAcross Iran, authorities are hunting for Starlink terminals – jamming whole neighbourhoods using tools developed for electronic warfare, and flying drones over rooftops to search for telltale satellite dishes, say sources. Under a law passed in 2025, possessing a Starlink terminal in Iran can be interpreted as espionage for Israel and is punishable by up to 10 years in prison.\n\n“They have basically criminalised Starlink to the extent that they’re saying in the law [that] if you use Starlink it’s the equivalent of conducting espionage operations for Israel and the American CIA,” said Rashidi.\n\nIt is unclear how many terminals are still operating, and how many have been confiscated, he added.\n\nThe tools Iran appears to be using to jam the terminals are military-grade, similar to those used to jam drones on the frontlines of Ukraine, said Rashidi. They are expensive and energy-intensive, capable of knocking out a certain radio frequency within a given area, but can only be used locally and cannot blanket the country.\n\n“It’s not cheap. It’s something you’d find in a military arsenal, and there’s only a few types of suppliers,” said Madory.\n\nFor now, the few who have smuggled Starlink terminals can connect online, although in neighbourhoods with heavy jamming it is nearly impossible to do more than send messages. The tech-savvy among them are using VPNs to disguise their presence; others are simply hauling their terminals from place to place to avoid detection.\n\nWhile Starlink users can communicate for now, Iran could choose – though it would be difficult – to track them down.\n\n“Depending on how much effort the Iranian government wanted to put into it, they could trace the signals that use the particular frequency those terminals have to use,” said Madory. “You’re kind of announcing yourself.”\n\nFor those without a terminal, an announcement on a state-linked Telegram channel has given a preview to the potential future of the internet in Iran. The IRIB news agency yesterday published a list of all internet sites that would now be available in Iran.\n\nThese included domestic search engines, domestic maps and navigation services, domestic messaging apps, and even a domestic streaming service – an Iranian version of Netflix, said Rashidi, with only government-approved videos.\n\nAll of these sites are part of Iran’s effort to create a national internet, said Rashidi: a skeleton version of the web that is significantly more restricted than even China’s, managed by the government and virtually unconnected to the outside world. That effort has been under way since the Rouhani administration, and now appears to be working, he said.\n\nWhat this could mean, said Madory and Rashidi, is that Iran’s internet as it was may not come back.\n\n“There are rumours,” said Rashidi. “Some people are saying that if things go back normal, there won’t be the internet. There will be only the national internet.”\n\n“They’re gearing up for the long run, for this to be the way things are for an extended period of time,” said Madory.",

    "fullText": "After Apple chose Gemini to power Siri, Alphabet surpassed Apple to become second-most valuable company in world\n\nGoogle’s parent company hit a major financial milestone on Monday, reaching a $4tn valuation for the first time and surpassing Apple to become the second-most valuable company in the world.\n\nAlphabet is the fourth company to hit the $4tn milestone after Nvidia, which later hit $5tn, Microsoft and Apple.\n\nThe spike in share price comes after Apple announced it had chosen Google’s Gemini AI model to power a major overhaul of the iPhone maker’s digital assistant Siri, which comes installed in every iPhone. Neither company disclosed how much the deal was worth.\n\n“After careful evaluation, we determined that Google’s technology provides the most capable foundation for Apple Foundation Models,” Apple said in a statement to CNBC.\n\nAs tech stocks continue a years-long meteoric rise, fears of a bubble in the stock market persist; however, Wall Street’s excitement for new avenues of investment in AI does as well. Alphabet’s milestones signal a remarkable change in investor sentiment for Alphabet, with its stock surging about 65% in 2025, outperforming its peers on Wall Street’s elite group of stocks, the so-called “Magnificent Seven”.\n\nThe tech giant has allayed investors’ doubts about its artificial intelligence strategy in recent months with a series of high-profile product launches, including the latest version of its flagship AI model, Gemini, and the popular Nano Banana image generator and editor. OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT and Google’s insurgent rival, left investors and consumers underwhelmed with the release of its latest model, GPT-5, which allowed Alphabet to surge ahead.\n\nGoogle, best known for making the world’s most popular search engine and browser, has also turned its once-overlooked cloud unit into a major growth engine, which drew a rare tech investment from Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway. Google Cloud’s revenue jumped 34% in the third quarter, with a backlog of non-recognized sales contracts rising to $155bn. Renting out Google’s self-developed AI chips that were reserved for internal use to outside customers has also enabled the unit’s breakneck pace of growth.\n\nMeanwhile, the company’s dominant revenue generator – the advertising business, driven by Google Search and YouTube – has largely held steady in the face of economic uncertainty and intense competition.\n\nThe company has faced two landmark US antitrust suits as it has navigated its place in the AI boom. After Google lost the first case, a judge ruled in September against breaking up the company, allowing it to retain control of its Chrome browser and Android mobile operating system.\n\nIn the second case, a judge ruled Google had illegally monopolized the online ad market last April. A trial over how to remedy the monopoly began in September, which could see the judge forcing Google to divest parts of its lucrative ads business to foster competition.",

    "fullText": "The world's most senior central bankers are rallying around Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell after he said the US government was attempting to pressure the central bank on monetary policy.\n\nOn Tuesday, a letter cosigned by the heads of 10 global central banking institutions defended Powell's integrity, calling him a \"respected colleague held in the highest regard by all who have worked with him.\"\n\n\"We stand in full solidarity with the Federal Reserve System and its Chair Jerome H. Powell,\" the letter read.\n\n\"The independence of central banks is a cornerstone of price, financial and economic stability in the interest of the citizens that we serve. It is therefore critical to preserve that independence, with full respect for the rule of law and democratic accountability. Chair Powell has served with integrity, focused on his mandate and an unwavering commitment to the public interest,\" the letter read.\n\nThe statement was signed by Christine Lagarde, head of the European Central Bank, and Andrew Bailey, the Bank of England chief, as well as central bank bosses from Sweden, Denmark, Switzerland, Australia, Canada, South Korea, and Brazil, alongside the chair and general managers of the Bank for International Settlements.\n\nThe letter comes after Powell revealed on Sunday that the Federal Reserve had been served grand jury subpoenas by the Department of Justice, which was widely viewed as the latest escalation in an ongoing dispute between the central bank and the Trump administration over the path of interest rates.\n\n\"No one — certainly not the chair of the Federal Reserve — is above the law,\" Powell said in a video statement on Sunday. \"But this unprecedented action should be seen in the broader context of the administration's threats and ongoing pressure.\"\n\nOn Monday, a group of senior figures in US economics and monetary policy, including all three living former heads of the Fed, and five former Treasury secretaries, rallied behind Powell.\n\nThat statement called the investigation \"an unprecedented attempt to use prosecutorial attacks to undermine\" the independence of the Fed.\n\n\"It has no place in the United States whose greatest strength is the rule of law, which is at the foundation of our economic success,\" the statement added.",

    "fullText": "Liverpool are in the fight for Yan Diomande - but they have an alternative. And he's a true world-class talent, too.\n\nYan Diomande is one of the most in-demand talents in world football right now. The Ivorian has exploded onto the scene over the last year, first with Leganes and then at RB Leipzig this season.\n\nIt's widely expected that he'll move again in 2026, probably for a truly massive fee. Liverpool will likely try to be the team that pays that, according to several outlets.\n\nOne of those claiming it is Christian Falk, with the Bayern Munich insider suggesting the Reds are in the race along with most European giants. But there's the problem - the fight to win this race is intense and only one team can win.\n\nThus it's important that Liverpool have themselves at least one alternative on the wing. They do need to invest in the position, after all, and Diomande can't be their only option.\n\nIt seems they do have that alternative, though. And he's a truly world-class talent.\n\nThat report by Falk drops an interesting line: Liverpool have Said El Mala on their shortlist, too. Again, they’re not alone in that but it seems the Koln winger is the consolation prize here.\n\nAnd what a prize he is. El Mala is still only 19 but has six Bundesliga goals and two assists in a little over 600 minutes this season. It’s an incredible record, especially as Koln aren’t playing well.\n\nThey’ve won two of their last 14 Bundesliga games. Despite that, El Mala looks like one of the most exciting talents in the league - and one who could compete with Diomande.\n\nLiverpool showed in the summer that they rate Bundesliga talents very highly, spending massively on both Florian Wirtz and Hugo Ekitike. It now seems that they’ll move for another one, be it Diomande or El Mala.\n\nThe latter certainly ticks the boxes Liverpool want. He’s averaging 2.76 successful take-ons per 90 minutes in the Bundesliga this season and the only player in the league averaging more with at least as many minutes is Diomande.\n\nHe’s winning tackles, too, and proving to be a threat in the air. All in all, El Mala is a world-class young talent and one who surely moves up a level in a better team.",

    "description": "Musk said a \"supersonic tsunami\" of AI and robotics will bring about a world of zero scarcity.",
    "fullText": "Saving for retirement is pointless thanks to the impending “supersonic tsunami” of AI and robotics, which will bring about a world of zero scarcity, according to Elon Musk.\n\nWhile the Tesla and SpaceX CEO admitted he’s “more optimistic” than most, he insisted people shouldn’t stress over building a nest egg for the distant future, contrary to the staid advice of nearly all other financial professionals.\n\n“Don’t worry about squirreling money away for retirement in 10 or 20 years,” said the world’s richest man on the Moonshots with Peter Diamandis podcast last week. “It won’t matter.”\n\nPart of Musk’s controversial take lies in his vision of a world transformed by rapidly improving AI, robotics, and energy technology.\n\n“Anything short of shaping atoms, AI can do probably half or more of those jobs right now,” he said.\n\nThe advances could lead to such big productivity increases, he said, that they will surpass “what people possibly could think of as abundance.”\n\nRather than a universal income, everyone will enjoy a “universal ‘you can have whatever you want’ income” in the future, he claimed. In this world, the link between individual wages, savings, and living standards no longer makes sense.\n\nEven without savings, AI will help people obtain better medical care than currently available within five years, as well as remove any limit on the availability of goods, services, or educational opportunities.\n\n​Musk’s comments build on his earlier claims that AI and humanoid robots will make work “optional” within 10 to 20 years and render money itself irrelevant. Musk previously compared the future of work to leisure activities like playing sports or video games rather than a survival necessity.\n\n“If you want to work, [it’s] the same way you can go to the store and just buy some vegetables, or you can grow vegetables in your backyard. It’s much harder to grow vegetables in your backyard, and some people still do it because they like growing vegetables,” Musk said during the U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum in November.\n\n​To be sure, Musk’s predictions about the future come at a time where many Americans are struggling to save. In part due to persistent inflation and weak wage growth, only 55% of American adults said they had a “rainy day” fund of three months expenses saved up for an emergency, down from a high of 59% in 2021, according to a survey by the Federal Reserve. Fewer than half of those surveyed said they could cover an expense of $2,000 or more with their savings.",

    "description": "Gold and silver surge to historic highs as the dollar weakens. A structural shift in safe-haven demand & global monetary confidence?",
    "fullText": "As geopolitical tensions rise, the US dollar (USD), long considered the market’s default safe haven, is failing to respond in the way it has historically.\n\nMeanwhile, gold (XAU) and silver (XAG) are flashing signals that extend far beyond a typical commodities rally.\n\nInstead, capital is flowing decisively into hard assets, pushing gold toward the $5,000 mark and silver above $80, levels that are forcing investors to reassess old macro assumptions.\n\nGold stock analyst Garrett Goggin highlighted the anomaly, noting that during previous US military escalations, the dollar almost always strengthened as investors rushed toward perceived safety. This time, the opposite occurred.\n\n“The USD used to spike higher when the bombs dropped. Not anymore,” Goggin said, pointing to a sharp dollar pullback even as gold and silver surged.\n\nIndeed, while gold and silver prices recorded God Candles on Monday, the US dollar index nosedived, dipping to 98.53 as of this writing. The divergence suggests growing skepticism toward the dollar’s role as a geopolitical hedge.\n\nThe price action itself is historic. Economist and long-time precious metals advocate Peter Schiff noted that gold has cleared $4,560 for the first time ever, placing it closer to $5,000 than $4,000.\n\nSilver, meanwhile, has jumped above $84, posting one of its strongest relative performances in decades. The simultaneous breakout across both metals is unusual and typically associated with periods of deep monetary or systemic stress.\n\nAnalysts argue that silver’s move is not being driven solely by speculative frenzy. Synnax co-founder and COO Dario pointed to silver entering contango—a condition where futures prices trade above spot prices—as a potential signal that large corporate and industrial buyers are entering the market.\n\nAccording to Dario, this behavior suggests companies are hedging against future supply shortages and rising costs. It indicates real-economy demand rather than short-term trading excess.\n\nThe rally has also revived long-standing debates around price suppression in precious metals markets. Kip Herriage argues that gold and silver were artificially restrained for years, citing JPMorgan’s 2020 manipulation fine as a key inflection point.",

From now on.”\n\nA “super cycle” refers to an extended period of strong upward momentum that significantly outpaces normal market growth, often driven by macroeconomic trends.\n\nThe notion of a crypto “super cycle” has gained traction among prominent market figures in recent months.\n\nThis term has been mentioned by Fundstrat and Bitmine’s co-founder Tom Lee, Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood, and most recently Binance founder Changpeng Zhao.\n\nIn response to the SEC removing crypto from 2026 priority risk list, CZ wrote: “I could be wrong, but Super Cycle incoming.”\n\nTom Lee said in November that he believed Ethereum was embarking on the same super cycle as Bitcoin from 2017.\n\n“The path higher is not a straight line,” he wrote on X.\n\nKim has been increasingly vocal about XRP’s potential.\n\nEarlier this month, he wrote that the cryptocurrency may outperform precious metals in 2026, noting, “My prediction: XRP may outperform gold and silver in 2026.”\n\nHe added that while gold and silver were currently “pumping,” XRP would be “next.”\n\nThe comments mark a shift from Kim’s prior focus on Bitcoin, with whom he had previously engaged in frequent comparisons.\n\nHe has also suggested that XRP could approach $1,000 over the next decade under certain macroeconomic scenarios, citing a potential decline in the U.S. dollar and sustained inflation.\n\nThe predictions come as Ripple announced a significant regulatory milestone, obtaining approval for its Electronic Money Institution (EMI) licence and crypto asset registration from the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).\n\nThe new approvals allow Ripple to extend its licenced cross-border payments platform to U.K. institutions, enabling them to send international payments using digital assets efficiently.",

    "fullText": "A new year is often meant to symbolize fresh starts, but for one of America's most recognizable casual dining brands, 2024 delivered the opposite. Instead of renewal, the year was marked by financial troubles, bankruptcy, and a significant loss of its domestic and international footprints.\n\nFounded in 1965 in New York City, this restaurant chain became a household name by serving classic American bar food and offering popular happy hour drink deals intended to make every day feel like a Friday. For decades, the brand portrayed itself as a lively escape where guests could relax, enjoy indulgent food, and unwind.\n\nBut behind that image, the chain had been quietly struggling with years of declining sales and rising costs. Those pressures ultimately reached a tipping point, leaving the company unable to sustain its financial obligations.\n\nIn early 2024, TGI Fridays began closing dozens of underperforming restaurants nationwide, describing the move as a strategic effort to streamline operations and position the brand for long-term growth. However, the closures continued throughout the year, reaching around 50 locations before the company made the announcement it had long feared would come.\n\nIn November of that same year, TGI Fridays filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, citing $37 million in debt. In the court filings, the company attributed much of its financial collapse to the COVID-19 pandemic, which forced it to temporarily close restaurants and suffer the aftermath of consumers' cautious spending.\n\nThe bankruptcy filing applied only to company-owned restaurants, not franchise locations. TGI Fridays secured debtor-in-possession financing, allowing restaurants to remain open and continue normal operations during the restructuring process.\n\nAt the time of the filing, the brand operated fewer than 40 company-owned restaurants in the U.S., alongside 120 domestic franchise locations, and 316 international units.\n\nTGI Fridays' struggles expanded beyond the U.S. In September 2024, Hostmore PLC, the brand's UK franchisee, filed for administration, the UK equivalent of bankruptcy, putting 87 restaurants at risk of closure.\n\nA month later, investment firms Breal Capital and Calveton acquired the UK business, preventing the brand from disappearing from the region entirely. The deal saved 51 locations and thousands of jobs, though 35 restaurants ultimately closed and more than 1,000 employees were laid off.\n\n53-year-old restaurant chain is quietly closing locations nationwide\n\nDunkin’ copies trendy Starbucks menu move\n\nChick-fil-A made a major change to its chicken, fans are noticing",

    "fullText": "On Sunday evening, Milos Raonic announced his retirement from professional tennis.\n\nThe former world number three made the announcement on his social media accounts, calling tennis his ‘love and obsession.’\n\nRaonic is one of the greatest players in Canadian tennis history; a player who possessed an almost unreturnable serve and a steely demeanour on court.\n\nThe 35-year-old reached his one Grand Slam final at the 2016 Wimbledon Championships, where he lost to Andy Murray in straight sets.\n\nFollowing his announcement, various high-profile tennis figures have sent Raonic messages celebrating the Canadian star’s career.\n\nIn a post on X [formerly Twitter], three-time Wimbledon champion Boris Becker sent a congratulatory message to the 35-year-old Canadian superstar.\n\nBecker [pictured below] said: “Congratulations Milos on a fabulous tennis career! Good luck on your next chapter!”\n\nRaonic won 23 ATP Tour titles during his career; however, he was never able to win one of the major titles.’\n\nAlong with his one Grand Slam final loss, Raonic also lost all four of his Masters 1000 final appearances.\n\nTo be fair to the Canadian star, all of his Masters 1000 final losses came against either Novak Djokovic or Rafael Nadal – two of the greatest players in tennis history.\n\nIvan Ljubicic, the former coach of Roger Federer, has also sent a message to Raonic via Instagram.\n\nHe said: “Congrats on your impressive career! Everyone knows your future will be even more successful. Happy retirement, Milos!”\n\nLjubicic and Raonic worked together for two-and-a-half years before parting ways in November 2015.\n\nAfter they split, Raonic thanked the experienced coach for his help.\n\nAs per Tennis.com, Raonic said: “I’d like to thank Ivan Ljubicic for the tremendous amount of support, knowledge and understanding he has given me.\n\n“The decision has been made that we will not continue our professional relationship in the coming year.”",

The balls are hugging the rail. The top slates need levelling up. The table fitters need to go out and check the level of the top slate.\n\n\"If those balls are hugging that top rail, then it's going to make the game incredibly easy to make big breaks. It's also wrong that a ball should go in that easily. This looks like it's not level.\"\n\nIn response, the organisers of the invitation-only Masters, which typically features only the top-16 ranked players in the world, said: \"The table is checked before, during and after every match, as is standard at any event.\n\n\"We strive to provide the best possible playing conditions and our team of expert table fitters do a fantastic job.\"",

    "description": "Lower Chinese LNG demand could pressure global markets, especially as new U.S. and Qatari capacity comes online and Russian pipeline and LNG exports to China increase.",
    "fullText": "China is boosting domestic natural gas production, and it is doing it fast. A major LNG consumer—and importer—the country has been key in LNG demand forecasts. Now, these forecasts will need to be revised.\n\nLess than ten years ago, China was struggling to get its domestic gas production off the ground, especially in shale formations. China’s shale geology is different from the U.S. basins, and energy companies were finding it difficult to get commercial production going. Now, China’s state oil and gas majors are pumping more gas than ever and announcing new discoveries in the shale patch.\n\nIn November last year, China produced 22.1 billion cu m, which was a 7.1% increase on the year, Kpler reported this month citing official production data. The increase was driven by “faster-than-expected shale gas ramp-ups in the Sichuan Basin.” Based on that data, the energy analytics firm expects China’s total for 2025 to reach 263 billion cu m, rising to 278.5 billion cu m this year, again thanks to growing shale gas production in the Sichuan and Shanxi basins.\n\nAs with oil, rising domestic production would inevitably affect imports, even as China leans more heavily on natural gas for emission-reduction purposes. Last year, for instance, China booked higher domestic gas production and a rather substantial decline in LNG imports. In fact, imports of liquefied gas last year fell to the lowest in six years after a string of 12 monthly declines in a row. Imports only rebounded at the end of the year but not enough to reverse the decline. Kpler has predicted that Chinese demand for liquefied natural gas is going to decline this year as well, with shale gas production removing some 600,000 tons of LNG demand, reducing the total to 73.9 million tons.\n\nNow, 600,000 tons is not a whole lot in the context of a market where the United States alone exported over 100 million tons last year. But it does serve as yet another evidence of a trend in China to reduce dependence on energy imports, which has implications for global energy commodity markets that have gotten used to relying on China as the ultimate driver of demand.\n\nThe projected decline in China’s demand for gas—and by extension LNG—may interfere with new LNG capacity addition plans and prices, shrinking producers’ profits. It is these plans for a wave of new LNG supply, set to come online by the end of the decade, mostly from the top exporters, the United States and Qatar, that have prompted many analysts to expect an oversupplied LNG market by 2030 that would weigh on prices.",

    "title": "A value-conscious shift in customer behavior is rocking the restaurant world. Brands are grappling with these 8 questions.",
    "description": "The restaurant industry is grappling with big questions about consumer behavior, efficiency, and labor this year, analysts told Business Insider.",
    "fullText": "The restaurant industry is grappling with big questions this year.\n\nDiners these days are more value-conscious, more selective, and more willing to stay home; and costs, along with competition, continue to rise for operators.\n\nAs big chains and local independents try to protect sales or regain their footing, analysts who spoke to Business Insider said the year ahead will come down to whether restaurants can do more with less, without losing what made people want to dine out in the first place.\n\nThese are the biggest questions shaping the restaurant industry's next chapter.\n\n\"Consumers are looking for value, but they're also cutting back on frequency — restaurants across the spectrum have to improve quality and the dining experience while controlling costs to maintain all-important same-store sales metrics,\" Asit Sharma, analyst for The Motley Fool, said. \"That's a difficult challenge against a backdrop of food and wage inflation.\"\n\nOperators are trying to understand their customers' restaurant and dining behaviors better in order to determine what they value most, and adjust their strategy accordingly, Michael Della Penna, the chief strategy officer at the digital advertising research firm InMarket, said.\n\n\"Restaurants think their biggest competition is the restaurant down the street,\" Della Penna said. \"In reality, competition today is far broader and more fragmented. Consumers aren't just choosing between restaurants anymore — they're deciding whether to eat out at all.\"\n\nMany brands are using limited-time offers or collectible promotions to drive repeat visits, app downloads, and loyalty program sign-ups, in attempts to connect more deeply with their customers, Evert Gruyaert, the restaurants and food service leader at Deloitte US, told Business Insider.\n\nStarbucks' viral collectible Bearista cup and Chipotle's protein snack cup launch are prime examples.\n\nHowever, Gruyaert said, the question is bigger than a simple limited-time offer. Restaurant operators are trying to identify why their brand resonates with consumers, which means aligning with a broader mission.\n\n\"Something that remains always relevant is: how do we do the right thing around, for instance, sustainability? How do we source more of our ingredients locally?\" he said. \"Because that has a cost efficiency, but it also plays into some expectations from our consumers.\"\n\n\"Restaurants are very hesitant to increase menu prices much more than they feel is reasonable,\" Moutray said. \"However, they still have to make the math work, right?\"\n\nSo, whether restaurants are adopting more technology — be it AI or other automation — or seeking alternative solutions to reduce costs, Moutray said efficiency is an \"ongoing battle\" for the industry.\n\nAI has become a buzzword in the restaurant space, but it remains an integral part of the conversation, Moutray said.\n\n\"You're seeing a lot of new technologies that are helping to speed up service, and make life a little bit more efficient, and hopefully improve the bottom line well,\" Moutray said.\n\nVoice AI integration is being continuously implemented at drive-thrus, and back-end systems are being overhauled for inventory and staffing purposes. New consumer-facing tech stacks are being rolled out, but it's not yet clear what the gold standards across the industry will be.\n\n\"Five years from today, whether it's a Michelin-starred restaurant with a single location, or a burgeoning brand capitalizing on the latest food trend, the average restaurant will be much more analytics-driven versus today,\" Sharma said.\n\n\"Labor, labor, labor,\" is top of mind for restaurants because of the industry's high turnover, Gruyaert said.\n\nExpectations from talent are also changing, Gruyaert said. The minimum wage continues to increase, and workers are seeking more flexibility in their jobs, which creates more competition among restaurants.\n\n\"So, the question is: how do you keep funneling that pipeline of talent and keep people close to you as a brand?\" Gruyaert said.\n\nMoutray said the industry will likely continue to see more consolidation this year as companies look to cut costs.\n\nSharma said smaller steakhouse chains with high fixed costs and operational inefficiencies are most at risk for closures and consolidations due to relentless beef inflation, coupled with their lack of purchasing power with suppliers, which he said \"creates a profit real headwind, and these models will get sorely tested in 2026.\"\n\nIt's not all doom and gloom. Some brands, such as Jollibee, are looking to go public — and more may be on the horizon.\n\n\"You still have a lot of focus on closures, but the reality is that we still have a lot of folks who are opening, as well,\" Moutray said.\n\nWith high labor, food, and packaging costs, many restaurant brands are closely monitoring their bottom lines while investing in upgrades.\n\n\"Slimmer profit margins are translating into lower free cash flow, but whether it's upgraded point of sales systems with rich data analytics for independent restaurants, or kitchen automation for chains, it's clear that technology investments will be critical for improving restaurant-level and overhead margins in the coming years,\" Sharma said.\n\nSharma said fast casual chains that can monitor inventory levels at restaurants in real time, and react quickly and efficiently through centralized ingredient kitchens, like Cava, have \"a real edge in this cost environment.\"\n\nSimilarly, quick-service restaurants with consistent, simple menus like Chick-fil-A, along with comfort food concepts that have low overhead and tech stacks purpose-built to accommodate digital orders, like Wingstop, are likely to see financial gains this year, Sharma said.\n\nUltimately, the questions facing the industry boil down to one key issue: growth.\n\nEach of the analysts who spoke to Business Insider said that's the core issue facing restaurants this year, as consumer tastes change, food and labor prices increase, and technology continues to advance.\n\n\"The No. 1 thing it's all about is how do you drive growth in this environment?\" Gruyaert said. \"That's the big question.\"",
