    "fullText": "South Korea’s women added to the trophy cabinet twice in 2025, but underwhelming results in several international friendlies leave Shin Sangwoo and his squad with a point to prove at next year’s AFC Women’s Asian Cup.\n\nThe year started on a high note for the South Korean women’s national team with victory in February’s Pink Ladies Cup. Korea won all three of their matches and did so with a better goal difference than Russia to claim the title. Sure, it wasn’t the most glorious win, given the calibre of the teams involved and the status (or lack thereof) of the tournament itself, but it was a win nonetheless, and the squad returned from the UAE with a nice shiny platter to put in the KFA trophy cabinet.\n\nIn May, Shin Sangwoo’s warriors were off to Australia for a pair of friendlies against the hosts of next year’s AFC Women’s Asian Cup. Buoyed by large and enthusiastic home crowds, the Matildas proved tough opponents. The results — a 1-0 loss and a 2-0 loss — weren’t terrible, but did lay bare a weakness in Korea’s goalscoring department, the team’s inability to get across the line (or at least, to do so in the right goal) damaging their confidence.\n\nThere were two more friendlies in late spring, this time on home soil as Korea played host to Colombia. The first match in Incheon ended as a 1-0 loss; Korea did well to hold their own fast and physical opponents. Despite the frustrating lack of goals, the home fans were treated to a moment of elation as Kim Minjeong made a cracking save to deny Usme’s penalty. There was further joy a few days later in Yongin as Jung Minyoung finally put an end to the goal drought just two minutes into her international debut. An unfortunate own goal from Kim Jinhui brought the sides level before the final whistle, but on some level, the friendlies were a success. Manager Shin experimented with formations, and everyone in the squad got minutes on the pitch, with the exception of third goalkeeper Woo Seobin.\n\nIn July, South Korea hosted the EAFF E-1 Football Championship (East Asian Cup), with both men’s and women’s competitions happening in venues around Gyeonggi-do in what must have been a busy week for those guys who shake the giant Taegukgi. The tournament saw Korea’s women take on some of their toughest competitors in the region. Against China, the final score was 2-2; Ji Soyun’s dramatic injury-time equaliser earned her a nomination for the KFA’s goal of the year. Another late equaliser, this time from Jeong Dabin, made it 1-1 against fierce rivals Japan. As Japan and China faced each other on the final matchday, a win for either team would secure them the title, but yet another stalemate in that match opened the door for Korea to swoop in and claim the victory, which they did with an assured 2-0 victory over Chinese Taipei (Taiwan).\n\nThus, Korea’s women lifted the East Asian Cup for the first time in 20 years, proving in the process that they can still compete with the regional football powerhouses despite a relative lack of investment and development in the women’s game. More accuracy in front of goal could have helped deliver a more decisive victory, but a trophy is a trophy, not to mention a huge confidence booster.\n\nThere were no A matches in the October international window due to the National Sports Festival, the KFA electing to avoid clashes so that the squads of the eight WK League clubs wouldn’t be left depleted. The national team still made headlines in the autumn as it emerged that several players had demanded equal treatment with the men’s team, allegedly threatening to boycott A matches unless their conditions, including business class flights for international fixtures, were met. The news divided more reasonable fans and provided ammunition for keyboard warriors who seem to think that national pride would be better served by defunding and disbanding the women’s team than supporting the Taeguk Warriors in women’s competitions.\n\nIt remains unclear in which section of the plane the squad travelled for their latest excursion, a trip to Europe for friendlies against Wales and the Netherlands. Shin should have fancied his team’s chances in Malaga as they lined up against a Welsh team on an 11-match winless run (spoiler alert: now 12), but it was his side that conceded first; Kim Minji scored her international debut in the second half to bring things level. After appearing the weaker side for much of the match, Korea seemed to gain some momentum after the goal, but it was too late.\n\nThe Netherlands were always going to be difficult opponents for Korea. In fact, Korea could learn a thing or two from the Dutch model of rapidly developing the domestic women’s football environment with the explicit core aim of improving the national team. WSL all-time top goalscorer Vivianne Miedema completed a hat-trick within 35 minutes; her teammates made it 5-0 by half time. The second half was goalless, but the damage was already done. The scoreline in this match, and England’s 8-0 thumping of China in front of 74,611 fans at Wembley a few days earlier, serve as a stark reminder that the top teams in Asia still have catching up to do when it comes to the women’s game.\n\nConceding five goals in 45 minutes and scraping a draw against a lower-ranking team on bad form: these are not results that inspire confidence, but the proof of the pudding is in the eating, and this pudding — next year's Asian Cup — is still in the oven, raw in the middle.\n\nUnder Shin Sangwoo the women's national team is making progress. He has used this year's A matches to play around with the squad, trying out several formations and starting lineups. Goalkeeper Kim Minjeong has solidified her place in the first eleven. A much-discussed \"new generation\" of players has been welcomed into the fold, with 12 players receiving their first senior call-up and 17 making their international debut this year. More of Korea's squad than ever before are playing regularly for fully professional clubs in the top leagues of Europe and North America.\n\n(Photo by Darrian Traynor/Getty Images)\n\nLooking ahead to the Asian Cup, there is still work to do (isn't there always?). South Korea's women need to be more effective in front of goal. Goals, especially early goals, will boost the squad's confidence as they progress through the tournament and face tougher opposition. Players need to avoid becoming downcast when chasing a result, and trust themselves and their footballing ability rather than resorting to messy tackles and avoidable fouls.\n\nMental toughness will be key in the group stage as Korea are set to face hosts Australia. The Matildas have beaten them twice in 2025, and the home crowd will only be more animated for this major tournament. They are also joined in Group A by Iran and the Philippines. The former didn't make it past the group stage in their Asian Cup debut in 2022, while the latter became the underdog story of that tournament, securing their first-ever qualification for the FIFA Women's World Cup by reaching the semi-finals; they were beaten to the final by South Korea.\n\nNext year's Asian Cup has been a clear driving force behind the women's national team activities in 2025. It's a natural focal point when reflecting on this year, and South Korea's performance at the tournament may well alter the 2025 narrative when looking back in a few months' time. With drastic changes coming to the WK League in 2026 and the national team undergoing a generational shift, women's football in Korea is at a crossroads — let's hope this year's trophies are a sign of things to come.",

    "fullText": "For more than a decade, the International Rescue Committee’s (IRC) annual Emergency Watchlist has accurately predicted 85-95 percent of the countries most likely to face a worsening humanitarian crisis in the coming year. The 2026 report highlights 20 countries and ranks the 10 at greatest risk, as a shifting world order leaves them to confront surging crises amid shrinking international support.\n\nThese countries are home to just 12 percent of the global population, yet account for 89 percent of global humanitarian need. In 2026, tens of millions of people are set to face deepening hunger, displacement and violence as international funding and political attention continue to decline.\n\nRead on to learn more about the 10 countries most likely to face a worsening humanitarian crisis in 2026 and find out how the IRC is responding.\n\nThe threat of renewed conflict between Israel and the Lebanese nonstate armed group Hezbollah is growing, even as approximately 80 percent of Lebanon’s population lives in poverty. Fighting between the two sides in 2024 displaced 1.4 million people in Lebanon and 96,000 Israelis. A return to large-scale conflict in 2026 would overwhelm Lebanon’s fragile public services and sharply escalate humanitarian needs.\n\nThe IRC has been working in Lebanon since 2012, delivering emergency and long-term support to Lebanese citizens and refugees. We offer legal services, protection, education and economic support, as well as mental, sexual and reproductive health services to people affected by and recovering from crises.\n\nLearn more about the IRC’s response in Lebanon.\n\nArmed groups linked to Islamic State and al-Qaeda have engaged in an escalating campaign of kidnappings, forced recruitment and attacks on civilians in Burkina Faso for the past eight years. They have blockaded towns, cutting off more than a million people from food, water and health care. Recurring floods and droughts have also driven displacement and compounded the crisis. Pervasive insecurity has curbed the ability of humanitarians to reach the communities in greatest need.\n\nSince 2019, the IRC has been operating in Burkina Faso to address the humanitarian needs of populations affected by conflict and food insecurity. Its interventions span several sectors: water and sanitation, health, nutrition, economic recovery, protection, women's empowerment and governance. In close collaboration with authorities and local and international partners, the IRC works in accordance with humanitarian principles across seven regions to help communities survive, recover and rebuild their futures.\n\nLearn more about the IRC’s response in Burkina Faso.\n\nMali is facing escalating instability following changes in government, the withdrawal of French forces and the growing presence of the Russian Africa Corps. Armed groups—particularly Jama'at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM)—have expanded across central and southern Mali, attacking key trade routes and blocking the flow of fuel and goods into the capital, Bamako.\n\nThe IRC has been providing humanitarian assistance to crisis-affected populations in Mali since 2012, focusing on children, women and internally displaced persons. Our holistic approach integrates programming focused on health and nutrition, economic support, protection against violence and displacement, education, food security and equitable access to essential services.\n\nLearn more about the IRC’s response in Mali.\n\nConflict in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is growing despite a 2025 peace deal with Rwanda. Clashes involving the Rwandan-backed M23 armed group are escalating, as the group continues to expand its territorial control in eastern DRC and to exploit valuable rare earth and gold mining sites. Violence involving a number of local armed groups as well as forces from Uganda, Burundi and Rwanda is driving displacement, worsening food insecurity and increasing the risk of disease outbreaks.\n\nThe IRC has been operating in the DRC since 1996 to improve the well-being of crisis-affected communities, with a particular focus on women and children. In 2024, the IRC supported more than 305,000 people through its health, nutrition, WASH and education programs, while also strengthening child protection, advancing women’s empowerment and promoting community governance.\n\nLearn more about the IRC’s DRC response.\n\nFive years after the military took power in 2021, the violent conflict in Myanmar between armed groups and the central military continues with no end in sight. Meanwhile, Myanmar’s humanitarian response remains severely underfunded, even after a major earthquake in 2025 escalated the crisis in the country, leaving a total of 16.2 million people in need of humanitarian assistance.\n\nThe IRC initiated an emergency response in Myanmar following Cyclone Nargis in 2008. The IRC has worked with local partners to expand its activities since then, serving people affected by the escalating conflict since February 2021, as well as marginalized and stateless communities. The IRC currently works across multiple sectors in six states, including providing emergency response to communities affected by the earthquake in March 2025.\n\nLearn more about the IRC’s Myanmar response.\n\nHaiti has experienced political chaos since President Jovenel Moïse was assassinated in 2021, leaving the country without effective government or security. Armed gangs now control nearly all of Haiti’s capital, Port-au-Prince. Internationally supported attempts to restore order have failed and the mandate of the Transitional Presidential Council, which currently rules Haiti, is set to expire in February 2026. Gangs could exploit this power vacuum, worsening the situation for civilians who are facing increasing violence, hunger and displacement.\n\nThe IRC has a history of providing humanitarian support in Haiti since 2010, working with a strong network of civil society organizations and local groups to respond to the needs of communities affected by internal displacement and longstanding gang violence. Since December 2022, our services have focused on cholera prevention for internally displaced people and support for survivors of violence, including gender-based violence.\n\nInterconnected domestic and regional dynamics are driving instability across northern Ethiopia that could tilt into widescale conflict. In addition, fighting perpetuated by armed groups continues to displace civilians. Climate shocks like droughts and floods worsen the humanitarian situation. With significant aid cuts, including a $387 million reduction from USAID in 2025, humanitarian agencies are ill-equipped to handle these overlapping crises.\n\nThe IRC began its operations in Ethiopia in 2000, providing support to refugees from neighboring countries as well as Ethiopians living in crisis-affected and underserved communities. The country continues to face recurring challenges, including conflict, natural hazards and climatic shocks, all of which disproportionately affect vulnerable populations. We respond through multisectoral programming in health and nutrition, child protection, education, women’s protection and empowerment, economic recovery and development and environmental health.\n\nLearn more about the IRC’s work in Ethiopia.\n\nSouth Sudan is at risk of sliding back into civil war, as the 2018 peace agreement collapses and the current government breaks down. Meanwhile, the civil war in neighboring Sudan has led to an influx of refugees, added to domestic tensions and disrupted vital oil exports, triggering economic turmoil and growing unrest among unpaid security forces. Relentless annual flooding is devastating food production and has trapped millions in a deepening humanitarian crisis.\n\nFor over three decades, the IRC has stood as a lifeline for communities across the region, responding to the urgent needs of those affected by conflict, displacement and disaster. As one of South Sudan’s largest humanitarian actors, we reach over a million people with health, protection, education and economic empowerment services. In an unstable nation, the IRC’s work is not only lifesaving, it is life-restoring, helping individuals and families rebuild with dignity and hope.\n\nLearn more about the IRC’s South Sudan response.\n\nMore than two years of conflict have devastated Gaza and killed over 70,000 people, according to the Gaza Ministry of Health. In October 2023, Hamas and other armed Palestinian groups attacked southern Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking 200 hostages. The resulting military conflict between Israel and Hamas has systematically destroyed infrastructure, markets and essential food, water, shelter and health services across Gaza. Almost 80% of buildings have been damaged or destroyed and around 90% of the population have been displaced, often multiple times.\n\nA U.S.-led and regionally backed \"peace plan,\" including a ceasefire in October 2025, offers limited hope that external pressure may help reduce the intensity of conflict in 2026. However, there have been repeated violations of the October ceasefire in the weeks after it came into effect, and catastrophic levels of humanitarian need remain a certainty. Meanwhile, in the West Bank, escalating settler violence, financial restrictions and territorial fragmentation are eroding Palestinian security and daily life.\n\nThe IRC and our partners work to provide lifesaving services in the occupied Palestinian territory. In Gaza, that includes clean water, malnutrition treatment, protection and empowerment for women and children, early childhood development, psychosocial interventions, emergency reproductive health and other critical humanitarian needs. In the West Bank, the IRC and our partners continue to provide psychosocial interventions and early childhood development services, as well as build the capacity of community first aid workers.\n\nLearn more about the IRC’s oPt response.\n\nFor the third year in a row, the IRC ranks Sudan atop the Watchlist as the country most likely to experience a deteriorating humanitarian crisis. Sudan’s catastrophic civil war, waged between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and Rapid Support Forces (RSF), has killed over 150,000 people since April 2023 and is preventing lifesaving aid from reaching communities in need. The conflict has also triggered a devastating food crisis, forcing regions of Sudan into famine and causing deaths every single day.\n\nWhen the conflict began in 2023, the IRC adapted its programs and scaled up our response to address increased humanitarian needs. Despite operational challenges, the IRC continues to provide support in Blue Nile, Gedaref, Khartoum, River Nile, South Kordofan and White Nile states and is working on re-establishing its presence in Jazera state. We have an office in Port Sudan and are expanding our presence into other states, including Darfur.\n\nLearn more about the IRC’s Sudan response.\n\nThe IRC’s Emergency Watchlist identifies the countries most likely to experience a deteriorating humanitarian crisis in 2026—but it also presents solutions. The IRC is on the ground in every single country on this list, delivering lifesaving aid to the communities most impacted.\n\nThe International Rescue Committee has over 90 years of experience helping people affected by crisis in more than 40 countries to survive, recover and rebuild their lives. We also help refugees and displaced people resettle and integrate into new communities in the U.S. and across Europe.\n\nOur ratings: We consistently earn top marks from charity watchdog groups for our efficient use of donor contributions and the effectiveness of our work.\n\nGet connected: Follow the IRC on Instagram, LinkedIn, Facebook, Bluesky and X.\n\nStay informed: Learn more about the world’s worst crises—and how you can help—in the full 2026 Emergency Watchlist.",

    "fullText": "Stephanie Vaquer is still Women's World Champion, but she won her \"WWE Raw\" match against Judgment Day's Raquel Rodriguez by interference when WWE Hall of Famer Nikki Bella came through the crowd and caused a disqualification. Rodriguez had established herself as number one contender to Vaquer's title last week, when she took out Bella as she was attempting to demand her rematch after her loss to Vaquer at Survivor Series.\n\nRodriguez tried to overpower Vaquer to start off their match, and she got a lot of offense in throughout the bout. Vaquer went to the top rope to hit a flying cross body, but her challenger caught her and slammed her to the canvas. The champion tried to get Rodriguez in an armbar around the ropes, but before the referee could even begin a five count, Rodriguez had Vaquer up and hit a power bomb.\n\nVaquer hit the Devil's Kiss in the middle of the ring, causing Rodriguez to retreat to the corner where Vaquer hit her with a meteora. She tried to get Rodriguez up for the SVB, but couldn't. On the outside of the ring, Rodriguez caught a second Vaquer cross body and looked to throw her into the ring post, but Vaquer countered and sent Rodriguez face-first into the post.\n\nIt was then that Bella came out of the crowd to attack Vaquer. She connected with the Rack Attack 2.0 in the ring and later in a backstage segment, Bella said she demanded respect as a legend in the business from the other women.\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

    "fullText": "Although Diablo 4: Lord of Hatred takes players to the never-before-seen region of Skovos, it also marks the return of many beloved characters.\n\n on December 15, 2025 at 12:42PM PST\n\nAfter two and a half years, eleven seasons, and one massive, game-changing expansion, Diablo 4's Age of Hatred is finally coming to a close. Announced as part of 2025's The Game Awards, Diablo 4's next expansion, Lord of Hatred, marks the end of the game's ongoing saga--one which has seen Lilith, Inarius, Mephisto, and the humans of Sanctuary engage in an epic struggle to gain control of the world and its future. But while the upcoming expansion promises a \"satisfying\" conclusion and an \"epic, final showdown\" with the game's big bad, Mephisto, it also promises a number of other exciting features, too.\n\nPrior to the expansion's announcement, GameSpot, IGN, and PC Gamer were invited to attend an exclusive interview with two key members of Lord of Hatred's narrative team: lead narrative designer Matt Burns and narrative designer Eleni Rivera. The pair were eager to answer our questions about Lord of Hatred, even those that were, admittedly, both thirsty and bizarre. We left the Q&A session with a better understanding of Mephisto's plans, the lore behind the revamped Paladin class, and the Skovos Isles, as well as a great deal of anticipation--anticipation for more personality-filled dialogue options, plenty of \"Jedi mind tricks,\" and the return of Amazons, Lilith, and Ralph Ineson's velvety voice.\n\nIGN: Vessel of Hatred felt like you guys were holding your breath. Was that a Band-Aid or a part of the story that you always wanted to tell? I'm sure you guys heard a little bit of the feedback that Vessel of Hatred was good and also felt like it was teasing out of the showdown that we were all really waiting for. I'm wondering how much of that was planned versus you guys just taking longer to produce this big showdown.\n\nBurns: It's always been our intention. This is an \"Age of Hatred\" or Mephisto-Lilith-themed saga. Even before the base game came out--once we had finished our work on it, but before the actual release date--we were already planning out the next chapters of the story and it was always going to be about the story about Mephisto, his plans for Sanctuary, and ultimately all culminating to a final confrontation with him.\n\nRivera: When it comes to story, there's always things that change and it's trying to figure out what can we keep, what gets lost, and what is the streamline--especially when it comes to telling this really fun, big story. With Vessel of Hatred, we wanted to really dig into Mephisto and his motivation and keep that with Neyrelle. Now we get a chance to end it. I think it's sticking to our themes about family; that's a really big theme that we have with Mephisto and Lilith, and her children and Inarius. I think that it's finally all coming together. And that was always the plan--to have this big story that feels well-thought-out, and characters that you love and you want to fight for and want to fight against.\n\nIGN: And is this the final showdown?\n\nBurns: Yeah, this is a final showdown. We're going to see Mephisto in his full prime evil demonic glory. It's like what Eleni was talking about a little earlier: When you look at the bigger picture, you're seeing these phases of Mephisto, right? In the base game, he's very on the edges. He's not reborn yet and he's taking on the wolf form. In Vessel, he's a little more powerful because now he's in this Soulstone and he's able to do more. And so in Lord of Hatred, it's like there are no more chains on him. And although he's assuming--at first, at least--this form of Akarat, this prophet figure, he likes to manipulate people and do those sorts of things. He's using a new tool now to do that, but ultimately, the story culminates in us facing him, taking off his mask, and really just having this big epic showdown with him.\n\nRivera: It'll be very satisfying, I think, for the players with a lot of the story. There will be satisfaction along with horrors, and I think that's the best thing for Diablo. You've got some crazy, horrific things, and then you get this nice finale.\n\nGameSpot: Could you tell us a bit more about the Paladin and how they differ from previous games?\n\nBurns: There've been Paladins in Diablo before as well as the Crusader, who's similar to a Paladin in many ways because they're using the light as their source of magic. The Diablo 4 Paladin is a little bit different in terms of the lore and story. Rather than coming from the Zakarum church or being part of this big religion or institution, they're of a smaller order who are independent. And they're just out in the world trying to do good. They've learned from the past that being part of these big institutions inevitably leads to corruption, so they've purposefully, intentionally gone out and said, \"We're not going to get involved in that kind of stuff. We're just going to find the light within us and use that to do good out in the world.\" And so they have these oaths that they live by so that they don't follow the corruption and that sort of thing.\n\nEleni Rivera: The fun part is that we get to reinvent the Paladin. While they recognize the past, they know about the Zakarum, they know about other Paladins that have existed… They get to redefine who they are, what they are, and what The Order is. That's who they are. They even choose a new name when they join The Order, and their name is directly connected to what they find the most important within it. It's so cool. You get a chance to see this new form of who they are.\n\nBurns: And what's interesting about them too is they--due to their close connection with the light--are also aware of angels and the heavens. They know that angels are beings of light. And so they don't worship angels or anything like that, but they see them as these embodiments of light and embodiments of values that are associated with the light, like valor.\n\nGameSpot: Could you tell us a bit more about the region that's coming with the expansion? Are there any real-life locations that inspired it, or parts of history?\n\nBurns: Skovos is really cool, really unique, and interesting to Sanctuary. We mentioned earlier that Skovos is where Lilith, Inarius, and these other rebel angels and demons created Sanctuary, and then they hung out in Skovos. It wasn't necessarily called Skovos back then, but they lived there at the dawn of the world. This is where they created humans, or rather where they created the first humans: the Firstborn. When you think about this saga as a story of family, as Eleni said, or maybe as one about what humanity's fate is, it makes sense to bring this culmination with Mephisto to where humanity itself began. There's tons of Firstborn ruins and, sometimes, not even ruins--it's the modern-day people, the Askari. They've maintained this architecture, they live within it, and they see the Firstborn as part of their heritage in a way, even though it's distant.\n\nThere's a lot of different environments throughout these different islands. Each one of them has a unique theme and flavor. We explore a lot of the culture of this place, so you have the Amazons and you have this oracle order, this Order of Seers. We get to see how they work together and how they rule over this island nation to help it function and survive all this terrible stuff that's happening in other parts of Sanctuary.\n\nBut the big interesting point of conflict is that now the bad stuff that was happening in Sanctuary--the stuff that we saw in base game and Vessel of Hatred--now it's coming to Skovos. Mephisto, in the body of Akarat, has gathered a bunch of followers, he's brought them all to Skovos, and he's disrupting the order and the piece of this place. Anything you want to add to that, Eleni?\n\nRivera: I feel like you covered a lot of it, but it's really beautiful. It's stunning and it's a place that you haven't seen before, so I think that's really exciting. And there's just a lot to look at. There's water that you get to look at, and I know that's very small, but it's just… the environment team did a really good job. And in general, there's a lot of deep lore that we got a chance to explore there. I think that'll be really exciting for players who really love lore and players who are also just diving into Diablo for the first time.\n\nGameSpot: And compared to Vessel, how large is Lord of Hatred? How many hours of story can we expect?\n\nRivera: I would say it's comparable to Vessel of Hatred. The map is pretty big. Like Matt said, there's a lot of lore stuff you get to explore in Skovos, so it's got quite a bit of content that the players get to dive into.\n\nPC Gamer: How do you approach creating a villain like Mephisto in a way that feels like a threat to the player, given that our player characters have just killed tons of demons that were already very powerful?\n\nRivera: It's narrative. It's understanding what a player's weakness is, right? And it's building that up and connecting the player to people like Neyrelle and Lorath. You have these stakes that get bigger and bigger because you care about them more. So when it comes to someone who's so powerful, or someone who can defeat all these demons, what really is the thing that will get them to crack? It's the people that they love, the people that they want to fight for, and Sanctuary. And when it comes to creating a really big villain, it's building off that.\n\nBurns: When we first introduced [Mephisto] in the base game, part of the reason we introduced him that way is because he's not the antagonist in the story yet. We're hunting Lilith and he's helping us, and so it's creating this feeling of, \"Yeah, I don't know if I should trust him or I shouldn't trust him, but he's sort of useful to me, so at what point will the usefulness wear out or will he turn the tables on me?\" Because it's going to happen eventually, right? I think we wanted to introduce him that way just so that it would feel a little different than suddenly there's a prime evil sitting in front of you and you just want to fight him.\n\nI mean Eleni said it perfectly: It's how his effect on the characters we care about--and on the world at large--raises the stakes. And again, we're continuing this thread of him always being a bit of a devil on our shoulder. We're not always working with the best characters--sometimes our allies are a little shifty, too. He exploits that reality. He makes us doubt, maybe sometimes our actions, and the people around us.\n\nIGN: How do you make side quests feel like an organic part of the story when there's literally Satan running around?\n\nBurns: One thing that we've done is there are a number of side quests where it's a continuation of a character story that you meet in the main campaign. There are quests that follow an important character that you're around for some amount of time, and now you get to see what has happened to them after all these big events have unfolded. Yeah, Mephisto is running around and the stakes are so high, but what's going on with these other characters? It's about showing the aftermath of those big events, or showing the repercussions of the devil running loose.\n\nRivera: Yeah. I mean, the main story is so specific to our main characters, but the side quests are what breathe life into Sanctuary. They show us what everybody else is doing while the world is crumbling, and seeing intimate stories--seeing what other characters who maybe we know but they're not in the main quest--I think that gives us a chance as writers to dive deeper, and gives players get the chance to understand what these people are doing while there is this chaos. Life keeps on life-ing even when you've got Mephisto running amok. And I think that's the cool part about writing side quests.\n\nGameSpot: It seems like this idea of generational trauma is really at the core of this saga. Is that something that was intentional to this story? Are there some other ideas and themes that you were really hoping to get across and explore?\n\nBurns: Yes. One of the themes that's present throughout is this idea of the passing of the torch, or like you said, it's sort of a generational… Maybe trauma is part of it, but also how you pass on legacy, and whether you can even pass it on at all. And in passing on a legacy, what kind of burden are you putting on the new people?\n\nFor Lilith wanting to protect Sanctuary, or for the Horadrim wanting to do their thing, these are not easy jobs, right? They require a lot of sacrifice. Sometimes the goal is noble, but passing it on can be hard because you know that you're dooming these people to a tough life. That's definitely a theme that we played with in base game and Vessel, and also we explore in Lord of Hatred as well.\n\nThere's also this prophecy in the base game, and I think it shows up in Vessel of Hatred too, that Rathma had. He had these visions and saw the Great Serpent, and this is still a part of the story. As Eleni said, fate is a big theme and so is this prophecy, how it's unfolding, what it actually means, and whether it must happen or can be avoided. This thing will unfold and be fulfilled, but maybe not in the way the characters necessarily suspect. There will be a lot of sacrifices and choices made by characters that there are no coming back from. [Lord of Hatred] is going to be a big, exciting culmination of everything that started in the base game.\n\nPC Gamer: Could you talk a little bit more about Lilith coming back to the story and what her role is? I know there are quite a few players that really, really enjoyed her in the first game.\n\nRivera: We all love Lilith, right? She's cool, she's hot, she's our mom. I think it's really exciting we get a chance to see her in a new way. There's a lot of intimacy that we get to have with Lilith, and I think that we've always wanted to--or at least I've always wanted to--partner up with her. But Lilith will always be a demon at the end of the day. She has her own motivations and she's always going to have her own idea of what she wants in the world. So she has to decide whether or not she wants to ally with us for this bigger problem.\n\nBurns: The only thing I'd add is, again, it's about bringing these different threads to a close. In the base game, we were fed Lilith's blood petals--fed her blood. She's been a part of us this whole time. And though we defeated her in Hell, something of her has lived on in us. There's a presence inside of us that is slumbering basically. And now that we're going after Mephisto and the stakes are high and the fate of the world hangs in the balance, her presence within us really becomes a key to figuring out how to stop Mephisto. Like she said in the base game, \"There would be no victory without me.\" That sort of idea, it's true--we will need her to fix this and to save Sanctuary from Mephisto.\n\nGameSpot: What inspired the decision to bring back Lilith so soon? Were you a bit worried about bringing her back or was it just something that seemed like, \"Oh no, we have to do this?\"\n\nBurns: Like when I mentioned earlier, before the base game actually released and we were planning out future stories, we always did want to bring her back. Then it became a question of when. It was about finding the right opportunity to do it and make it feel the most impactful to the story.\n\nDuring [Vessel of Hatred's] development, we were toying around with the idea. We actually made some of these scenes where you heard her speaking. There was a scene where you saw her reflection or something like that too, but we cut those things out of Vessel because we were just trying to figure out, \"Okay, where's the place where we should highlight that so that it feels like something really juicy and impactful and not just a little thing that happens and then there's no payoff for it yet?\" You know what I mean?\n\nRivera: I feel like one of the biggest things is deciding how much payoff we want. We talk a lot about how this expansion is going to be super satisfying and everything will feel like it's tied together. Vessel of Hatred was the story of Neyrelle, it was a story of Mephisto, and it was about seeing what he could do without the power of being in Sanctuary. Now that he's out, it's seeing what he's going to do with this free will back in Sanctuary but masked as this major religious figure.\n\nBurns: One fun thing we're doing in Lord of Hatred that we didn't really do before is, with Lilith, you have different dialogue options for how you want to respond to her about certain things. We know that people have different feelings for her--whether she was right, whether she was wrong or whether they would've wanted to join her or not--and so we wanted to explore that through some of the dialogue you can have with her. Now, you get to see different ways she'll respond to you as well based on your decisions.\n\nRivera: I feel like Lilith is so nuanced and so complex. You get a mix of seduction and horror all at the same time and it's so cool and fun. And now we get a chance to really see her in a different way. When we last saw her we were fighting against her, but now there's a bigger issue. There's more at stake here, so it's her deciding what's important to her.\n\nGameSpot: You brought up that you now have options for how you want to interact with Lilith, and I thought that was really interesting because, right now, choice-driven, branching CRPGs are becoming more of the standard in the industry. Is that something that you've ever thought about exploring with Diablo? Having more choice throughout the story, exploring maybe different endings, different stories, and branching paths? Is that even possible in the structure of the game?\n\nBurns: I think it's cool and I enjoy that kind of stuff too. For Lord of Hatred, it's \n\nRivera: That's why we do it sometimes in side quests. It's not like you have two different paths, but I do think we get to explore a little bit of that. There was a side quest from, I think in Vessel of Hatred, that you get to have an alternate ending based on what you choose.\n\nIGN: Romance options? That's all I got.\n\nBlizzard PR representative: Are you asking, \"Can we hook up with Lilith?\"\n\nGameSpot: It's what everybody's thinking.\n\nRivera: In terms of romance, we get to see a little bit of Lorath's past, which is something that we haven't really gotten a chance to see with other characters. He has interactions with Queen Adriana that we get to see. We also get to see a lot more of Lorath, how he was painted in the past, and who he was versus who he's become now.\n\nPC Gamer: Is Lorath back? Are we going to hear more Ralph Ineson?\n\nBurns: Yeah, Lorath is one of the main characters in the expansion. He's going to be with you almost all the time throughout the campaign, except the times you split up and you're off doing different things, right? But yeah, he's there, he's continuing his story. There's a lot about Lorath and the Horadrim in Lord of Hatred. And again, it goes back to the themes of legacy and the fate of the Horadrim.\n\nWe've been in VO sessions with Ralph recording all of his lines, and it's always great to hear his voice again. The moment you hear it, you're like, \"Oh yeah, it's Lorath.\" That's been really fun and I'm super excited about Lorath's story in Lord of Hatred. I think it has a lot of great moments. He's a lot of fun to write as a character and, again, Ralph's voice is just amazing.\n\nAnother thing is Lorath has a history in Skovos, and that's something we'll explore in the campaign but, years and years ago, he came to Skovos with some other Horadrim and went on an adventure there. He met this Amazon named Adriana and they formed a bond, so he has some history with her. And now Adriana is the Amazon queen of Skovos. So with him coming back, there's a connection he has to this place that we're going to explore.\n\nIGN: I'm curious about how you guys are going to make players care about Akarat. The importance of the final cut scene of Vessel of Hatred might have been lost on people unless they're in deep on Diablo, but he's obviously a different type of puppet than a wolf. I'm curious about how you think about bringing Akarat as a character into the fold--and all the baggage that comes with him--and trying to explain why that matters while also showing this new version of the Lord of Hatred who is now walking around as a deity.\n\nRivera: When it comes to Akarat, he's just going to appear as a normal man. I think what is going to really cut deep is the amount of people who are now rushing to get to Skovos; seeing the influence that he has because he's such a big figure in the world and he's been doing miracles in Sanctuary. The idea of all these people worshiping this person that you know as a player is Mephisto, I think that is where that terror starts to come.\n\nHe also has his Jedi mind tricks, right? Mephisto is very good at getting in your head. You think you see one thing, but really he's showing you something else and that's the power. We get a chance to show how Mephisto really plays with your emotions and I think that's the best part about him.\n\nBurns: Just to add to that, a couple interesting things about Mephisto in this form--and ways to create interest for folks playing through it--is at first he's defying expectations, right? Yeah, he's a prime evil in this body, but he's not doing anything bad, which is interesting because that's how Mephisto was in the base game as well. Oftentimes, he's just telling you the truth. Maybe he's trying to get his own way by saying it, but he isn't always lying about things. Right now, he's just out there helping people and doing miracles. So it becomes this question, or this mystery, of what is he doing it all for? Why is he putting on this act? What's his end game for it all?\n\nThe other thing--and this ties into our themes--is that I think that Mephisto believes that humans don't really have any control over their fate. They're just cattle that more advanced entities or intelligent entities like him can lead around. What he's doing here is almost to prove a point to us, The Wanderer, and also to Lilith; you can create these things, these humans, and you can hope that they have some kind of free will or agency, but ultimately I'm going to show you that they don't. That's something else we play with, again, to just deepen his character a bit and make it more interesting.\n\nIGN: You have described Diablo IV as The Hatred Saga, and with this being the final confrontation with the Lord of Hatred, one would assume that that means that's the end of the aforementioned saga. I'm wondering how you guys are thinking about Diablo IV's future. I'm assuming that there's going to be more Diablo IV after this.\n\nBurns: You're right in terms of us just looking at it as The Hatred Saga, and really that's been our focus--just bringing this story to a close in a really big and impactful way. But there are other stories to tell on Sanctuary, of course, though I can't really go into detail about any other stuff.\n\nRivera: I think the best part is Diablo's live service. It gives us the opportunity to dive into whatever we want. Like Season 11, right? We get a chance to bring Hadriel back and we're getting a chance to talk to this angel that we only met briefly in Diablo II. We get to expand Hadriel's lore, which is really cool. We get a chance to always, possibly, tell new stories. But right now, we're just focusing on getting this expansion out and seeing what happens.\n\nThe above interview has been lightly edited for clarity and brevity.\n\nGot a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "title": "New Quantum Antenna Reveals a Hidden Terahertz World",
    "description": "Researchers at the University of Warsaw have unveiled a breakthrough method for detecting and precisely calibrating terahertz frequency combs using a quantum antenna made from Rydberg atoms. By combining atomic electrometry with a powerful terahertz-to-light conversion technique, they achieved the first measurement of a single terahertz comb tooth—something previously impossible due to the limits of electronics and optical tools.",
    "fullText": "A research team from the Faculty of Physics and the Centre for Quantum Optical Technologies at the Centre of New Technologies, University of Warsaw has introduced a new way to measure hard-to-detect terahertz signals using a \"quantum antenna.\" In their work, the scientists applied an innovative radio wave detection setup based on Rydberg atoms that not only senses terahertz radiation, but also accurately calibrates a so-called frequency comb in this part of the spectrum. Until recently, the terahertz range was considered a blank area in the electromagnetic spectrum, and the method reported in the journal Optica opens the door to extremely sensitive spectroscopy and a new class of room-temperature quantum sensors.\n\nTerahertz (THz) radiation, being part of the electromagnetic spectrum, lies at the boundary of electronics and optics, positioned between microwaves (used, for example, in Wi-Fi) and infrared. Although it holds immense potential for applications that include inspecting packages without harmful X-rays, superspeed 6G communication, and spectroscopy and imaging of organic compounds, turning this potential into precise and sensitive measurements has been technically very difficult. In the past few years, scientists have made major strides in both generating and detecting terahertz radiation, yet until now they had not been able to measure a frequency comb in this region with the required precision.\n\nFrequency combs as ultra-precise electromagnetic rulers\n\nWhy is this so important? Frequency combs, which earned a Nobel Prize in 2005, can be imagined as an incredibly accurate ruler made not from a solid material, but from light or radio waves. Instead of millimeter markings, there is a sequence of evenly spaced lines (\"teeth\") at strictly defined frequencies. This \"electromagnetic ruler\" lets physicists determine the frequency of an unknown signal with extraordinary accuracy simply by seeing which \"tooth\" it matches. Because of this, frequency combs act as reference standards that can be used to calibrate and stabilize many types of instruments over a wide range of frequencies. Depending on where in the electromagnetic spectrum this ruler sits, scientists talk about optical, radio, or terahertz frequency combs.\n\nTerahertz frequency combs are particularly attractive because they can support calibration and highly accurate measurements in a band where the oscillation frequencies are higher than typical radio waves but lower than optical waves (light). However, such combs are notoriously difficult to measure with high precision, since their oscillations are too rapid for conventional electronics and cannot be directly captured with standard optical methods. Researchers have been able to determine the spacing between the comb \"teeth\" and to measure the total power spread across the spectrum, but determining how much power belongs to a single tooth has remained a major challenge.\n\nRydberg atoms turned into quantum antennas\n\nThe scientists from the Faculty of Physics and the Centre for Quantum Optical Technologies at the Centre of New Technologies, University of Warsaw have now overcome this obstacle and, for the first time, measured the signal emitted by a single terahertz comb tooth. To achieve this, they employed a gas of rubidium atoms prepared in a Rydberg state. A Rydberg atom is defined as having a single electron excited to a very high orbit by being illuminated with precisely tuned lasers. This \"swollen\" atom acts as a quantum antenna that is extremely sensitive to external electric fields. In addition, by using tunable lasers, the detector can be adjusted to respond to one specific frequency within such a field, across a range that extends up to terahertz waves.\n\nTraditionally, in Rydberg electrometry, the phenomenon of Autler-Townes splitting is used to measure the electric field. Its huge advantage is that the measurement result depends only on fundamental atomic constants, providing an absolutely calibrated readout. Unlike classical antennas, which require laborious calibration in specialized radio laboratories, the atomic-based system is, in a sense, a standard unto itself. Moreover, thanks to the richness of energy states in the atom, such a sensor can be tuned almost continuously over an enormous range, from a direct current (DC) signal up to the aforementioned terahertz.\n\nHybrid terahertz to light conversion for extreme sensitivity\n\nHowever, this method has a limitation: on its own, it is not sensitive enough to record very weak terahertz signals. To remedy this, the research team additionally applied a radio wave-to-light conversion technique invented at the University of Warsaw and adapted it to the needs of terahertz radiation. In this process, the weak terahertz signal is converted into optical photons, which can then be detected with immense sensitivity using single-photon counters. This hybrid approach is the key to success: it combines the extreme sensitivity of photon detection with the ability to \"recover\" the calibration capabilities of the Autler-Townes method even for the weakest signals.\n\nThe sensor based on Rydberg atoms possesses all the features needed to perform precise frequency comb calibration: it can be tuned to a single tooth of the comb, and then retuned to the next, and the next. The scientists managed to observe several dozen teeth in a very wide frequency range this way. Additionally, thanks to the knowledge of the fundamental properties of atoms, the comb was directly calibrated, precisely determining its intensity.\n\nNew path for terahertz metrology and future technologies\n\nThe results obtained by the physicists from the University of Warsaw Wiktor Krokosz, Jan Nowosielski, Bartosz Kasza, Sebastian Borówka, Mateusz Mazelanik, Wojciech Wasilewski, and Michał Parniak represent much more than the development of another sensitive detector. Their work lays the groundwork for a new area of metrology. With the help of Rydberg atoms, the transformative uses of optical frequency combs can now be extended into the previously difficult terahertz region. Importantly, unlike many quantum technologies that require extremely low temperatures, this system functions at room temperature, which greatly lowers costs and makes future commercialization more realistic. This creates an opportunity to build reference measurement standards for the coming generation of terahertz technologies.\n\nThe project \"Quantum Optical Technologies\" (FENG.02.01-IP.05-0017/23) is implemented as part of Measure 2.1 International Research Agendas of the Foundation for Polish Science, co-financed by the European Union from Priority 2 of the European Funds for Modern Economy Programme 2021-2027 (FENG). The research is also one of the results of the SONATA17 and PRELUDIUM23 projects funded by the National Science Centre.)\n\nMaterials provided by University of Warsaw, Faculty of Physics.

    "fullText": "New analysis suggests Bitcoin’s four-year cycles have been replaced — and the world’s biggest cryptocurrency could rebound to $140,000 at some point in the next 180 days.\n\nAccording to Copper, the arrival of exchange-traded funds tracking BTC’s spot price have changed this digital asset’s behavior, and given way to what it calls the “cost-basis returns cycle.”\n\n“Across 2024/2025, Bitcoin has exhibited the same repeatable pattern: price breaks to new all-time highs, corrects sharply, and then finds support almost perfectly at its ETF investor cost basis before beginning the next expansion.”\n\nThe company’s analysis suggests we have seen this play out three times since these ETFs launched back in January 2024 — with each cycle delivering returns of more than 60%.\n\nCopper also claims this has exposed a significant divide between crypto-focused traders and institutional investors, with some Bitcoin commentators claiming it is “the worst bull market ever.”\n\nSo… what exactly causes these sharp corrections once BTC enters price discovery mode? Well, its analysis suggests that institutions rebalancing their portfolios is primarily to blame — an activity that “transforms Bitcoin’s volatility into realized returns.”\n\n“Institutions are not ‘staking sats’ — in fact, most do not care about sats at all now that Bitcoin is accessible through equities-style ETF shares. They care about risk-adjusted contribution to a portfolio.”\n\nGenerally speaking, it’s been recommended that institutions allocate somewhere between 2% and 5% into Bitcoin — but a sudden surge in price can have a huge impact.\n\n“Without rebalancing, a modest 2% Bitcoin allocation drifts to 6.2% in less than 180 days during these cycles. A 5% allocation drifts dangerously close to double-digit.”\n\nCopper’s head of research Fadi Aboualfa told Cryptonews that Bitcoin is now at a critical juncture.\n\n“With BTC now trading near its $84,000 cost basis, that pattern points to a move north of $140,000 in the next 180 days. If cost basis rises 10% to 15% as in prior cycles, the resulting premium seen at past peaks produces a target range of $138,000 to $148,000.”\n\nThe prospect of a return to all-time highs within the next six months would provide a much-needed dose of “hopium” for traders. However, other analysts have warned there are few catalysts that can drive BTC forwards at the moment. The Federal Reserve’s recent 0.25 percentage point interest rate reduction was largely priced in, with policymakers suggesting there may only be one cut in 2026.\n\nA big test will concern what happens if Bitcoin’s value falls below its cost basis for ETF investors — and whether sell-offs would intensify if institutions spent a prolonged period in the red.",

    "title": "Rich Western countries face a stark choice: 6-day workweeks or more immigration, top economist warns",
    "description": "One of the world's foremost economists, Lant Pritchett, has a plan.",
    "fullText": "Eva is a fellow on Fortune's news desk.\n\nA specter is haunting Europe—the specter of aging.\n\nMany Western countries are facing what the World Bank calls a “profound demographic crisis.” The twin perils of an aging population and record-low fertility rates are predicted to send their populations plunging in the coming decades.\n\nThe worst consequences of this demographic shift, per the World Bank, are economic. Soon the shrinking working population in the U.S., Canada, or Germany won’t be able to meet their own constant demands for high-quality goods and services. These rich, senescent countries will have to make a hard choice for economic survival: force people to work more, or allow immigrants to fill in?\n\nLant Pritchett, one of the world’s top thinkers on developmental economics, has seen this crisis coming for decades over his career at Harvard, the World Bank, and Oxford University, where he currently heads a research lab. He told Fortune his radical plan to stave off economic disaster.\n\nIn the long run, without intervention, the UN predicts a decline in population growth could cascade into a full-on population “collapse.” That collapse is not likely to occur until well into the next century—if it comes at all. However, in the short run, population decline presents a real and relatively simple economic problem: The West soon won’t have enough workers.\n\nThe ratio of working-age people to elderly people in rich countries will soon become so diminished that support for elders will be unaffordable. In Japan, a nation already facing the consequences of a graying population, the average cost of nursing care is projected to increase 75% in the next 30 years, with Prime Minister Fumio Kishida warning the nation is on “the brink.” In the U.S., think tanks have warned, an older population with more retirees means a shrinking tax base and higher demands on programs like Social Security and Medicare, along with a smaller number of working-age people to pay into those programs.\n\nIn short, we have a “ticking time bomb” on our hands, in the words of Greece’s Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, whose government introduced a six-day workweek last year to address the nation’s labor shortages. The move prompted fury and protests among workers as they watched their German and Belgian cousins embrace four-day workweeks.\n\nIndeed, even as some European countries and a few American companies flirt with working less, panicked economists and politicians are sounding the alarm: We need to work more. A study conducted by consulting firm Korn Ferry found by 2030, there will be a global human talent shortage of more than 85 million people, roughly equivalent to the population of Germany. That talent shortage could slash $8.5 trillion from nations’ expected revenues, affecting highly educated sectors such as financial services and IT as well as manufacturing jobs, which are considered “lower skilled” and require less education.\n\nNow is the time to act, economic veteran Pritchett told Fortune. But doing so involves some radical rethinking of the current immigration debate.\n\nClassical economics offers a number of ways to address a labor shortage, Pritchett said. Since most of the unfilled jobs are “unskilled,” or don’t require a degree to complete, one solution for businesses and governments is to invest in automation, essentially having robots fill the gap. But while automation helps get the jobs done, it depresses human workers’ wages by decreasing the number of jobs available, “exacerbating” the issue, Pritchett said.\n\nSome have called for increasing wages to induce more people to work. But most of the working-age population in the U.S. is already employed. Despite a well-documented decline in the portion of working-age men with jobs over the past few decades, Pritchett said the vast majority of working-age men are working, meaning raising pay would have small effects at best. There’s room for more women to work, he noted, but that could take away from other important responsibilities that are overwhelmingly shunted to women, such as caring for family or raising children.\n\nThat leaves two other options: forcing workers to work more or allowing an influx of legal, controlled immigration.\n\nMitsotakis’s plan for a six-day workweek is a step in the right direction for the short term, Pritchett said.\n\nBut “economics is not just about direction: It’s about magnitude,” he added. In other words, he says, small policy tweaks won’t do it. If we’re trying to address a big, structural problem with the U.S. labor force, the solution needs to be ambitious and comprehensive—precisely the type of legislation American politicians have largely avoided in recent years.\n\nIf policymakers simply try to make everyone work an additional day, the math simply won’t work out in the long run, Pritchett said. Even if Greece has “fantastic success” and increases its working hours by 10% over the next 30 years, that growth would represent a “drop in the bucket” in fighting a worsening labor shortage. He calculated a demographic labor force gap of 232 million people globally in his most recent paper, even assuming the highest possible labor force participation rate.\n\n“You can’t solve a problem that’s growing over time with [a labor force] that has an upward bound,” he said. You would have to keep the labor force working more and more, and even then, you would never be able to fill in the gap.\n\nPritchett has a better idea. He knows the current immigration debate is fraught, since the West is concerned with the social ramifications of allowing more migrants into its borders. But he maintains the only way to solve rich countries’ labor problem is to let in immigrants to work, particularly from countries where population growth is increasing, such as Nigeria or Tanzania, rather than decreasing.\n\nIn his view, the Western debate on immigration has taken on an unnecessarily binary flavor, with the choice depicted as one between a path to citizenship or closed borders. In an article titled “The political acceptability of time-limited labor mobility,” Pritchett says the West will soon have to abandon this view. Instead, he advocates for developed nations to embrace a system where immigrants can come to their country to work for a limited time—while also buying goods and services, renting homes, starting companies, and hiring workers—and then go back home, leaving both parties wealthier.\n\nThe truth, Pritchett said, is the U.S. needs low-skilled migrants, and many migrants need the economic boost from working in the U.S. Immigration is a symbiotic relationship that the West cannot quit—that’s why it’s so hard for us to actually control our borders.\n\n“The way to secure the border is to create a legitimate way for people and firms to get the labor that the economy really needs in legitimate, legal ways, and until we have that, the whole debate over the wall and stuff is just silly,” Pritchett said.\n\nIf anything, the intensifying crackdown on undocumented and legal migration since the late 1980s has led to mass settlement, according to Hein de Haas, a sociologist of immigration. Prior to the 1980s, the U.S. and Mexico enjoyed a relationship similar to the work-visa program Pritchett envisions. Mexicans freely flowed across the border, coming for a short time to work, returning home to enjoy their money, and sometimes repeating this journey over several years, Haas wrote. They never permanently settled because, knowing they could come and go as they pleased, they did not have to.\n\nThe U.S. facilitated this temporary migration programs specifically aimed at Mexicans,  encouraging contract workers to come to the U.S. after  World War I and II. The second of these, the Bracero Program, established a treaty for the temporary employment of Mexican farmworkers in the U.S., and was so popular that it was extended far beyond its initial life span, allowing nearly 5 million Mexicans to temporarily work in the U.S. from 1942 to 1964. (The program ended in 1965, when the U.S. sharply limited immigration from Latin America as part of a major overhaul of immigration laws.)\n\nWhat Pritchett suggests isn’t too dissimilar from simply turning the clock back to a time when migrants could move and work freely. He proposes a fixed-term system: A worker comes to the U.S. with the understanding that they are not on a path to citizenship, works on a three-year contract, and then returns to their home country. After an “off period” of six months to a year, the migrant could come back for another three years.\n\n“There are a billion people on the planet who would come to the U.S. under those terms,” Pritchett said. “But we don’t have that available.”\n\nHe isn’t exaggerating about the billion. In a 2010 survey, Gallup asked people around the world whether they would like to temporarily move to work in another country. Some 1.1 billion responded “yes,” including 41% of the age 15-to-24 population and 28% of those ages 25-44, Pritchett said.\n\n“What you could make in America in three years and go back to Senegal with is a fortune compared to anything else you could do to make your way in Senegal,” he added. “You go back to Senegal, you build a house, you buy your own business, and you’ve transformed your life by working temporarily.”\n\nTo avoid potential labor shortages in sending nations, Pritchett’s system would depend on bilateral agreements between the host and sending countries, and nations “could choose to put limits on their participation” to address their own labor needs, Pritchett said.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. would receive fresh batches of workers for service industries, elderly care, or manufacturing—essentially, all the jobs that would be otherwise unfilled.\n\nPolicies like these are not yet being discussed on the national stage, but Pritchett believes that will soon change. With the upcoming labor shortage and the unpopularity of forcing workers to toil for longer, politicians will have to expand their understanding of immigration to allow for policies like his. For now, he’s planting the seed.\n\nIn partnership with economist Rebekah Smith, Pritchett has started an organization called Labor Mobility Partnerships (LaMP) that aims to build political support for a temporary rotational migration system. The way he sees it, nothing will change by pitching the idea to politicians (“who tend to be followers, not leaders”) so instead, he is working with countries that are currently already expanding their immigration channels, like Spain.\n\nHe is also courting business leaders in sectors that will be the hardest hit by labor shortages, such as elderly care, who could “be potentially a powerful force” in explaining to politicians why policies like his are necessary.\n\n“Ideas at times are like dams: huge, unmoving, impregnable, able to hold the water back forever,” Pritchett writes in the conclusion of his paper. “But a small, strategically placed crack can cause a dam to be washed away overnight.”\n\nA version of this story was published on Fortune.com on Aug. 4, 2024.",

    "fullText": "SpaceX is reportedly preparing for a monster IPO — and a booming Starlink is a big reason why.\n\nGlobal web traffic from SpaceX's satellite-based internet service more than doubled in 2025, according to data from Cloudflare, a cybersecurity company that handles tens of millions of requests between users and websites every second.\n\nIt's the latest year of explosive traffic growth for Starlink, which uses a constellation of more than 9,000 low-orbit satellites to provide internet connection, including to remote areas.\n\nSpaceX said in November that the service has 8 million active customers, up from 4 million in September 2024, and is now online in over 150 markets.\n\nAround 23 airlines have also announced plans to use Starlink to offer high-speed WiFi on their planes, and SpaceX has signalled it could soon launch its own mobile carrier service powered by the satellite network.\n\nStarlink's growth comes as reports suggest a colossal SpaceX public listing is on the cards. Elon Musk seemed to confirm on Wednesday that the rocket maker is considering an IPO as early as next year, which multiple outlets have reported could see SpaceX valued at around $1.5 trillion.\n\nThat would catapult SpaceX into the list of the world's most valuable companies, and potentially put Musk within touching distance of becoming the first-ever trillionaire.\n\nSince its founding by Musk in 2002, SpaceX has successfully commercialized reusable rockets, a feat previously thought impossible by many within the space industry, and now launches more cargo into orbit than any other company.\n\nIn the long term, SpaceX aims to fulfill its billionaire founder's ambitious visions of colonizing Mars and putting data centers in space with its giant Starship rocket.\n\nFor now, however, the Texas-based company's huge valuation is driven by the success of Starlink, with Musk saying this month that the satellite network was \"by far\" the largest driver of SpaceX's revenue.\n\nCloudflare's annual report found that in the more than 20 countries and regions where Starlink launched in 2025, internet traffic from its satellite service surged immediately after the service became available. Cloudflare said that internet traffic grew 295% in Botswana this year, with Starlink launching in the African country in August 2024.\n\nThere's no sign of Starlink slowing down, with SpaceX preparing to launch the service in India next year.\n\nThere's also little sign of major competition. Rival services, including Amazon's Leo and China's Spacesail, are attempting to build their own constellations, but they have launched fewer satellites than Starlink.",

I am sorry that I reacted in the manner that I did.\n\n\"It's not an excuse, but I have had a lot of things on my mind recently and I suppose it all just became too much at the end.\n\n\"It has not been an easy time for me with my uncle Gary passing away recently. I saw him four days before he died and he gave me a look which told me how much he thought of me.\n\n\"Had I won the game against Charlie, my second match would have been on the day of Gary's funeral and that hasn't been lost on me.\n\n\"Let me say again, that's no excuse for what I did on the stage. It was the wrong thing to do and I don't want it to take anything away from Charlie. He played well.\n\n\"This is not how I would like people to view me. Yes, I can get emotional at times, but not like that and that wasn't right.\"\n\nIt is the second year running that Menzies has been knocked out in the first round after he broke down in tears during and following his exit to Leonard Gates last December.\n\nMenzies later revealed his father Ricky had been ill in hospital at the time.",

    "fullText": "A United Airlines flight bound for Tokyo was forced to return to Washington Dulles International Airport on Saturday after losing power in one of its engines shortly after takeoff, triggering a brush fire on the ground and prompting a federal investigation. The Boeing 777-200 was carrying 275 passengers when the incident occurred, according to the airline.\n\nUnited Flight 803 departed Dulles around 12:35 p.m. en route to Tokyo’s Haneda Airport. After the engine issue was detected, the aircraft circled the area for just under an hour before landing safely back at Dulles. United said there were eight crew members aboard and no injuries were reported.\n\nU.S. Transportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy said in a post on X that a piece of the jet’s engine cover broke off after takeoff, sparking a brush fire near the runway. He added that the Federal Aviation Administration will investigate the incident.\n\nI've been briefed on United Flight 803 from Dulles to Japan. \n\nHere’s what we know:\n -An engine failed on the Boeing 777-200ER shortly after take-off\n -275 passengers, 15 crew members on board\n -A piece of the engine cover separated and caught fire, sparking a brush fire on… https://t.co/IxkFJU2Fes\n\n— Secretary Sean Duffy (@SecDuffy) December 13, 2025\n\nEmily McGee, a spokesperson for the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority, said the fire was quickly extinguished and that airport fire and rescue crews evaluated the aircraft after it returned. Smoke from the brush fire was visible across the tarmac as other flights continued arriving and departing.\n\nThe incident briefly disrupted operations at Dulles and drew the attention of passengers across the airport.\n\nHouman David Hemmati, a California-based ophthalmologist, was seated on a separate United flight bound for Los Angeles when his pilot announced a ground stop.\n\n“We are on a ground stop,” the pilot told passengers, Hemmati said. “There’s an incident on the runway.”\n\nLooking out his window, Hemmati said he saw thick smoke rising near the runway, illuminated by flashing emergency vehicles. He took photos and posted on X, writing, “Praying it’s not a crash.”\n\nHemmati’s flight was later diverted to another runway and allowed to depart around 1 p.m. As the plane climbed, he said smoke was still visible below.\n\nCommercial aircraft are designed to fly safely on a single engine, particularly during critical phases like takeoff. Pilots train extensively for engine failures, and standard protocol typically calls for returning to the departure airport when a problem occurs shortly after liftoff.\n\nKey details from the incident include:\n\nFlight: United Airlines Flight 803\n\nPassengers: 275 passengers and eight crew members\n\nIssue: Loss of power in one engine after takeoff\n\nGround impact: Engine cover debris sparked a brush fire\n\nOutcome: Safe return to Dulles with no reported injuries\n\nNext step: FAA investigation underway\n\nUnited praised the response of its crews and airport personnel in a statement released Saturday.\n\n“United is grateful to our crews and to the teams at Washington Dulles for their quick work to help ensure the safety of everyone involved,” the airline said. United added that it is working to rebook passengers on a later flight.\n\nThe FAA has not released details on what caused the engine cover to detach or whether the aircraft had any prior maintenance issues. Investigators are expected to examine flight data, maintenance records, and debris from the engine as part of the inquiry.\n\nThe Boeing 777 remains one of the most widely used wide-body aircraft in international travel, but any engine-related issue shortly after takeoff draws immediate scrutiny from regulators.\n\nFor passengers aboard Flight 803, the incident ended without injury but with a tense delay to an already long journey. For United and federal investigators, the focus now turns to determining what failed and whether any broader inspections are needed.\n\nThe FAA’s findings will ultimately determine whether the incident was an isolated mechanical failure or part of a larger concern.",

    "fullText": "He rewrote the rule book with Rockstar then left it all behind. Now Dan Houser is back with a storytelling-focused studio to take on AI-obsessed tech bros and Mexican beauty queens\n\nThere are only a handful of video game makers who have had as profound an effect on the industry as Dan Houser. The co-founder of Rockstar Games, and its lead writer, worked on all the GTA titles since the groundbreaking third instalment, as well as both Red Dead Redemption adventures. But then, in 2019, he took an extended break from the company which ended with his official departure. Now he’s back with a new studio and a range of projects, and 12 years after we last interviewed him, he’s ready to talk about what comes next.\n\n“Finishing those big projects and thinking about doing another one is really intense,” he says about his decision to go. “I’d been in full production mode every single day from the very start of each project to the very end, for 20 years. I stayed so long because I loved the games. It was a real privilege to be there, but it was probably the right time to leave. I turned 45 just after Red Dead 2 came out. I thought, well, it’s probably a good time to try working on some other stuff.”\n\nAt first, he looked into film or TV writing, but didn’t like what he found. “That world was not overly excited by me and I was not overly excited by them,” he says. “I’ve spent 20 years talking about how games are the coming medium and now they are the medium […] you look at TV and the budgets and the amount of money they can generate, but the creative ambition is so small at times”. It seemed to Houser that it would be easier to come at the industry with IP that had already been generated. So he moved to Santa Monica and formed Absurd Ventures, bringing in Greg Borrud (founder of Seismic Games and Pandemic Studios) as head of games and, as COO, Wendy Smith, previously at the New Yorker and Ralph Lauren, and a White House special assistant during Bill Clinton’s presidency.\n\nIt was clear from the start it wouldn’t just be a video games studio. In 2024, the company released the 12-part story podcast A Better Paradise, a dystopian thriller about an ambitious online game world overseen by a powerful AI presence that begins to become sentient – with devastating consequences. Its creator is the mysterious tech billionaire Dr Mark Tyburn, a British inventor who intends the game as a digital utopia, then abandons it when things go awry. In some ways it is a satire on our current digital oligarchy, in which billionaire tech bros wield astronomical influence over society.\n\n“All of these tech companies start out with grandiose ambitions, this ‘we are going to save the world through togetherness’-type gibberish,” he says. “We’ve created some of the most powerful people in history in terms of reach and mind control. Those people end up living with far more money than anyone’s ever had. And it feels, as someone who lives in the society that they have helped create, that there are moments in those journeys when they must have felt their product was not quite what they intended it to be and was doing unforeseen harm, and … they went out of their way to ensure that was not regulated. That Faustian moment I find fascinating, and that’s not to say I wouldn’t make the same choice or judge them for it, I just find it interesting.”\n\nTellingly perhaps, the company at the centre of A Better Paradise, Tyburn Industria, feels much more like a games studio than a social media mega-corp. Also, the lead protagonist is a writer who finds himself at the centre of the game’s development. Is there an element of autobiography here?\n\n“Yeah, of course – at that level,” says Houser. “But I also wanted to write about games and tech in a way that felt authentic. To lean slightly more into the games side in terms of the office environment was really easy for me. I know what it’s like to work in a games company obviously. I wanted to try and bring that to life in a way that felt real and to capture some of the micro dramas.”\n\nHaving turned A Better Paradise into a novel, Houser’s Santa Monica studio is now working on an open-world video game version. He’s not saying how it will fit in with the podcast, just that Mark Tyburn and the AI at the heart of his game, NigelDave (a wildly intelligent program, fixated by humans but with no understanding of how they function), will both figure in the action.\n\nAlso in development at the company’s second studio in San Rafael, is the Absurdaverse, a comedy universe populated by a menagerie of weird characters, from a skeletal warrior to an ageing hippy. The company is planning a series of animated TV shows and/or movies for the concept, but also another open world game, which Houser has described as, “a living sitcom”. Again, he’s vague on the details, but it looks to be a more story-driven take on The Sims, possibly utilising AI to create emergent narratives around the characters and their lives. “We’re trying to use the memories of NPCs in a fun way,” he says. “Just trying to make it a bit more alive. You’ll see when we talk about it more, but it is shaping up really well. It’s a completely gamey game – very mechanics driven. With both games, we’re trying to make them really strong on mechanics, really fun to play, accessible, but plenty of depth.”\n\nHouser is also planning a game around the company’s third IP, the comic book series American Caper, co-written with fellow Rockstar alumnus, Lazlow. With its cast of escaped convicts, crooked lawyers and Mexican beauty queens, it is perhaps the closest out of all his new projects to Grand Theft Auto. Which is perhaps why the interactive version is going in a different direction. “I’m not making an open-world game for that,” says Houser. “We’re actually looking at maybe doing more of a story game. We’re still kind of exploring it.”\n\nWe talk a little bit about the current prevalence of forever games such as Minecraft, Fortnite and Roblox and how they’re sucking up a lot of the world’s playtime. But Houser is adamant that there’s still a vast audience for mature single-player narrative experiences – and that’s what he’s aiming at.\n\n“We’re trying to be ambitious, to make new stuff,” he says. “At some level [our projects] are traditional console games, accessible, but action-oriented story-driven open world console games – but then at the same time, we’re doing it a slightly different way or with slightly different subject matter. Three years ago we were watching one of those PlayStation showcases, and if you blinked and missed the credit sequences, you couldn’t tell where one game ended and the other began. Everything was sort of dark purple and about space ninjas. They were about this apocalypse or that apocalypse but always felt the same.”\n\n“That’s fine. Some of them are amazing games. But we were like, well, we’ve got limited money and we are starting from scratch. We have to have good stories and fun dialogue, and make sure our gameplay is amazing and accessible, and our art direction has to be fresh – at all points, it has to feel different. We have to make stuff where people go, ‘Well, I’ve never played a game about that’, and then treat the audience, not just as gamers, but as human beings.”\n\nSo he’s not worried about the industry’s current obsession with live-service multiplayer mega-games? “I still think there is enough of an audience who want new stuff and single player-led stuff,” he says. And then in his characteristically self-deprecating way he adds: “I hope so. Or we’re in a little bit of trouble.”",

    "description": "Mason Mount is delivering for Manchester United - but can his performances force him into Thomas Tuchel's World Cup squad?",
    "fullText": "\"I have to tell you, I love that kid.\"\n\nRuben Amorim's first public observations on Mason Mount after his appointment as Manchester United head coach just over a year ago have stood the test of time.\n\nIt has taken longer than hoped for United's fanbase to come to the same conclusion, but Mount's goal and overall performance at Wolves last week had them purring.\n\nSuddenly, the hole left by the impending departure of Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo to the Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) doesn't look quite so difficult to fill.\n\nMount's game intelligence plus his awareness and ability to play in tight spaces are coming to the fore. Now the phrase most used about him is: \"His quality was never in doubt.\"\n\nAlmost two and a half years into the five-year contract he signed in July 2023, Mount's own bold declarations about the future have some meaning.\n\n\"I am hugely ambitious,\" he said on his arrival at Old Trafford. \"I know how amazing it feels to win major trophies and what it takes to do it.\n\n\"I will be giving everything to experience that again at Manchester United.\"\n\nIt is fair to say the statement of intent Mount made after completing his £55m move from Chelsea is yet to be fulfilled.\n\nMatch-winner Mount's quality 'never in doubt'\n\nAmorim hails Mount after win at Wolves\n\nA Champions League and Club World Cup winner with Chelsea, Mount was an injury-time substitute for United's 2024 FA Cup final victory over Manchester City. He started the Europa League final defeat by Tottenham in May and was part of the United squad that finished 15th.\n\nNot that the 26-year-old regrets leaving boyhood club Chelsea.\n\nSpeak privately to people who know Mount well and you get the impression restoring United's fortunes offered the kind of challenge that enthused him.\n\nUnder Erik ten Hag at the time, the club made it clear they wanted him. That matters. It still does. That is why Amorim's first words were perfectly put.\n\nAs the former Sporting coach assessed the squad he was inheriting, he knew in Mount he was getting a high-level, flexible player who could fit into a variety of different positions within his system, something Amorim felt he did not have enough of.\n\nLeft, right, as an orthodox number 10, as a six, or an eight, Mount has a range of experiences that make him very useful for a coach who regards adaptability as a key weapon.\n\n\"He's a very smart player,\" was Amorim's response when asked about Mount on Friday before Monday's Premier League game with Bournemouth. \"He's really technical.\n\n\"Sometimes being a technical player is not just having fun with the ball. It's the quality of the pass, the reception, how to receive the ball. Mason can balance our team quite well.\"\n\nAmorim is not alone at United's Carrington training ground in recognising Mount's qualities. He is certainly not the only one genuinely glad a player who can offer so much is able to put injury issues to one side and deliver performances on a consistent basis.\n\nNo-one would argue the past couple of years have been easy. Mount himself has admitted dealing with two extended absences and a couple of smaller frustrating ones was tough.\n\nBut staff around Carrington admired the professional attitude Mount adopted throughout his various recoveries.\n\nTraining-ground sources have said the player left no stone unturned in pursuit of staying fit and was regularly one of the last to leave after long stints in the ice bath and sauna sessions.\n\nHe is regarded as a link within Amorim's squad - someone who knits groups of players together - which has been particularly evident this season when, it is generally acknowledged, United's players have remained tight and focused on delivering better results.\n\nMount is also well liked by non-football staff because he is helpful, which is not something that can be taken for granted in the playing department at United or any other club. He spends time with a couple of kids who are regulars outside the training ground, has spoken with them and their parents and still wears a bracelet one of them gave him.\n\nThese traits are all positives on a human scale.\n\nHowever, in the pressurised world of the Premier League, they are side issues compared to delivering on the pitch - and just now, he is on a roll.\n\nOutstanding in the win at Crystal Palace on 30 November, Mount followed up with an excellent performance against Wolves, who were admittedly poor at Molineux but proved they can be obdurate and diligent in their unlucky loss at Arsenal.\n\nGoals in both victories have taken his overall tally for United to seven, to match his shirt number, a fact not lost on the club's content creators who put them all on the app and launched a vote for which was the best. His second in the Europa League semi-final against Athletic Bilbao - a two-touch, 50-yard effort to seal a 4-1 win - came out on top.\n\nThe idea over the next few weeks and months is to widen that particular area of debate as United push for a European place - their overall aim - and try to secure a top-five berth likely to deliver a return to the Champions League a year before schedule.\n\nMount won the most recent of his 36 England caps in the 2022 World Cup quarter-final defeat by France in Qatar.\n\nDespite three years without an international appearance, Three Lions boss Thomas Tuchel has not forgotten him.\n\nMount revealed in the summer his former manager at Chelsea had been in touch. The pair were spotted chatting after last month's home defeat by Everton and while competition for World Cup places is fierce and Mount is rated as unlikely to break in at this stage, it cannot entirely be discounted.\n\nThe player himself is not setting that as a target. Sources say his focus and drive remains on delivering on those first words following his arrival from Chelsea.\n\nMount recognises turning the United tanker around has to be a collective effort but there are signs it is heading in the right direction, even if the process is lengthy and not without the odd glitch.\n\nHe clearly has a significant role though. Mount has missed one game so far this season though injury. His impact is starting to be felt.\n\nJust as United prepare to lose two significant attacking forces to Afcon, they can look for Mount to deliver in their absence with an increased feeling of confidence.\n\nLatest Manchester United news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Man Utd - what do you want to know?",

    "description": "The cheapest ticket to attend the USA's opening 2026 World Cup match against Paraguay is $1,120 — a steep jump from initial estimates shared in 2018.",
    "fullText": "It's been over 30 years since Americans have had the chance to watch their national soccer team play on their home turf.\n\nThey'll get another chance next year, but it'll cost them.\n\nFans could pay over $2,700 for a ticket to watch the USA's first match in the 2026 FIFA World Cup against Paraguay, which is scheduled to take place in June at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California.\n\nThat far exceeds the estimated ticket prices included in the original joint bid submitted by the United States, Canada, and Mexico to host the World Cup.\n\nFIFA, which sets ticket prices, says it is using variable pricing to determine ticket costs, and \"may adjust ticket prices throughout the sales phases based on a review of demand and availability for each match.\"\n\nThe organization said it isn't using dynamic pricing — when ticket prices change in real time based on demand and other factors — for the 2026 World Cup. In addition to third-party sites like StubHub, which sell tickets, FIFA offers a resale and exchange marketplace for fans.\n\nFIFA launched its third phase of ticketing last week. Soon after the portal opened, fans took to social media, expressing shock over what they described as steep prices.\n\nWorld Cup tickets are divided into four categories, with Category 1 selling the most expensive tickets and Category 4 the cheapest options.\n\nAs of Saturday, there are no available Category 4 tickets for the USA's opening match against Paraguay on June 12. Instead, the cheapest ticket is selling for $1,120 under Category 3. The most expensive ticket costs $2,735, followed by $1,940.\n\nThe most expensive ticket for Mexico's opening match against South Africa costs $2,355, and Canada's opening match costs $2,170. Neither of those matches is offering Category 4 tickets.\n\nAs the tournament continues, ticket prices drop but are typically still far above original estimates.\n\nWhen the USA faces off against Australia on June 19, the most affordable ticket is $265, while the most expensive is selling for $700. When the USA plays on June 25, fans will have to pay between $910 and $340.\n\nThose prices are a far cry from what the United States, Canada, and Mexico estimated in their bid to host the tournament. The countries submitted a combined bid — dubbed the \"United bid\" — and were selected in 2018.\n\nIn their pitch, the countries estimated that a Category 1 ticket for an opening match would cost $774, followed by $614 for Category 2, $320 for Category 3, and $60 for Category 4.\n\nTickets for the final match were estimated to cost between $1,550 and $128. Under FIFA, the current final match prices — held at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey — start at $4,185. The most costly ticket is $8,680.\n\nDespite the hefty price, fans eager to snag tickets in this phase can purchase them now until January 13.\n\nThe 23rd edition of the tournament will take place this summer in 16 cities across North America. The first game kicks off on June 11, and teams will play until the final match on July 19.",

    "fullText": "On a weekend when Phil Foden and Cole Palmer helped Manchester City and Chelsea to vital Premier League victories, Aston Villa's Morgan Rogers showed just why he retains a firm grip on the number 10 position in Thomas Tuchel's England set-up.\n\nVilla's eight-match winning run in all competitions appeared under serious threat at the midway point of Sunday's game at third-bottom West Ham, who led 2-1 at the break against a side who appeared jaded and short of inspiration after Thursday's Europa League victory at Basel.\n\nIn the second half, however, Rogers decided to take matters into his own hands.\n\nThe 23-year-old scored his first of the afternoon five minutes into the second half, making it 2-2 from close range after West Ham had failed to clear Youri Tielemans' low cross into the box.\n\nThen, with the final 10 minutes approaching, Rogers collected a loose ball 30 yards from goal and was given time and space to slam a powerful, swerving strike into the top right corner of Alphonse Areola's goal and clinch a ninth straight victory for Unai Emery's third-placed team.\n\nThat magnificent effort capped a fine all-round performance from Rogers and reaffirmed his status as England's first-choice number 10 at next summer's World Cup - despite world-class competition from Foden, Palmer and Real Madrid's Jude Bellingham.\n\n\"He scored two fantastic goals and, for me, he is not just going to be in the squad next summer,\" said former England forward and Match of the Day pundit Theo Walcott. \"He is a dead cert to be a starter for England at the World Cup - 100%.\n\n\"He does everything, he's not just a goal threat. I like all [the contenders for the number 10 position], but one of them is going to have to miss out on the squad itself - and Rogers, for me, has to start.\"",

    "fullText": "Just three months into his farewell tour this year, John Cena captured his 17th world title when he defeated Cody Rhodes at WrestleMania 41, officially surpassing Ric Flair's long-standing record of 16 world championships. Cena originally tied Flair in 2017 when he finally scored a victory over AJ Styles, but for years fans questioned if WWE would allow the 48-year-old to become the sole holder of the milestone. However, Cena himself was unsure about beating Flair's record, as he outlined his respect for \"The Nature Boy\" during in an interview on \"Insight,\" and hopes to one day congratulate the performer that wins 18 world titles.\n\n\"I have been apprehensive for quite some time for that because I love Ric. Super mentor to me. Always been a great guy to me and I love him. I meant what I said in the press conference at Rumble ... I want to win 17 so I can shake the hand of the performer that wins 18. So what it meant to me personally was like, hey youngins, one of them is going to be you or you better get working because I don't want to be in the ground when 18 happens. I want to shake somebody's hand and something that's impossible is now possible. So that's what it means to me of hopefully by my actions, this is possible, and holy hell this guy wants to shake my hand when I pass it and I can't wait to do that.\"\n\nCena's Undisputed WWE Championship reign would last 105 days before he was dethroned by Cody Rhodes at SummerSlam this past August. Cena never received an opportunity to win back the gold, and instead set his sights on the Intercontinental Title, where he would defeat Dominik Mysterio and officially become a Grand Slam Champion.\n\nIf you use any of the quotes in this article, please credit \"Insight\" with a h/t to Wrestling Inc. for the transcription.\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

The vessel, known as Puffer Fish Blue 01, developed by China's Wuhu Shipyard and Sandianshui New Energy Technology, had been certified by the China Classification Society, a professional body for ship classification, it added.\n\n\"Their investment and efforts to build pure electric container vessels show China's increasing influence in the global shipbuilding industry,\" said Xiong Hao, assistant general ­manager at Shanghai Jump International Shipping. \"It remains to be seen whether electric vessels will be widely accepted by global container liners.\"\n\nPeople visit a model of a nuclear-powered container ship at Marintec China 2025 in Shanghai on December 2, 2025.

According to the Palestinian Foreign Ministry, 159 countries have recognized Palestine. The vast majority of the international community believes that a two-state solution is the only way to end decades of conflict.\n\nNetanyahu's government has said the international push for a Palestinian state rewards Hamas.\n\nHere are some global reactions to the Australia shooting:\n\nIran’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmail Baghaei condemned the attack: “Terrorism and the killing of people, wherever they occur, are unacceptable and must be condemned.”\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio said Washington strongly condemned the attack and that “Antisemitism has no place in this world.”\n\nKing Charles III said he was “appalled and saddened.” He also leads the Commonwealth, and the office of Israeli President Isaac Herzog on Sunday said Herzog had reached out to the king in September warning of an “epidemic of antisemitism” in three Commonwealth countries: Britain, Canada and Australia.\n\nMeanwhile, police in London said they would step up security at Jewish sites.\n\nGerman Chancellor Friedrich Merz said the attack “has left me speechless” and added that “this is an attack on our shared values. We must stop this antisemitism, here in Germany and worldwide.”\n\nSecretary-General Antonio Guterres said he was horrified and that “My heart is with the Jewish community worldwide on this first day of Hannukah, a festival celebrating the miracle of peace and light vanquishing darkness.”\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi condemned the “ghastly terrorist attack” and said that “we stand in solidarity with the people of Australia in this hour of grief.”\n\nThe organization's president, Ronald Lauder, said that “No community should ever fear ​coming together to celebrate its faith, traditions, or identity,” adding: “Make no mistake, this will not break us.\"\n\n\"I’m surrounded by antisemitic graffiti constantly. I think for our community in the east (of Sydney), and as a Christian, I just want to declare I stand with the people of Israel,” Anglican pastor Matt Graham told Australian Broadcasting Corp. He said he had been conducting a service at the nearby Bondi Anglican Church when panicked people began entering to take shelter.",

The crowd are going to be against me so it's going to be a tough game.\"\n\nLim said: \"I hope on a given day it can happen again. I never give up. He is good but he can be beaten.\"\n\nThe crowd roared on Lim, who is 72 next month, when he won the first set against De Graaf before his opponent levelled the match.\n\nLim went ahead again after a scrappy third set as De Graaf wilted while the experienced 'Singapore Slinger' held his nerve in a tense fourth, sealing victory with an average of 86.52.\n\nFive-time world championship semi-finalist Wayne Mardle said Lim was able to \"take his chances\" against De Graaf to secure an \"incredible\" win.\n\n\"If you have the desire, the passion but most of all the ability humans can achieve amazing things - and that was amazing,\" said Mardle on Sky.\n\nDe Graaf was six years old when Lim made his PDC debut 29 years ago.\n\nElsewhere, Wessel Nijman of the Netherlands eased to a 3-0 win over Czech Karel Sedlacek while Germany's Gabriel Clemens beat American Alex Spellman by the same scoreline.",

    "description": "Liverpool Lead Race for Arda Guler as Salah Future Dominates DebateLiverpool’s season has drifted into uncomfortable territory, a campaign that promised authority now defined by uncertainty. Arne Sl...",
    "fullText": "Liverpool’s season has drifted into uncomfortable territory, a campaign that promised authority now defined by uncertainty. Arne Slot arrived with ideas and conviction, yet results and performances have not matched the expectations that followed last season’s momentum. Anfield Watch have reported on growing unease around Mohamed Salah’s future and the increasing noise linking Liverpool with Real Madrid youngster Arda Guler. It reads like a club standing at a crossroads, unsure whether renewal must be accelerated or merely prepared.\n\nLiverpool were widely tipped as early pace setters, but inconsistency has dulled that edge. The forwards, usually the club’s heartbeat, have faltered. Mohamed Salah’s form has dipped and his frustration has spilled into public view after being benched, creating what can only be described as a destabilising subplot. One source describes how this reaction has fuelled speculation that Salah’s time on Merseyside could end as early as January.\n\nThe Egyptian remains an elite performer, even if recent weeks suggest fatigue or tactical discomfort. His quality, vision, and instinct still define Liverpool’s attacking identity. Yet football moves quickly. Clubs that stand still often fall behind, and the sense grows that contingency planning has already begun.\n\nThat preparation centres on Arda Guler. According to reports, Liverpool are now leading the race to sign the Turkiye international, despite interest from Arsenal and Manchester United. The appeal is clear. Guler is described as a ‘perfect fit’ due to his adaptability within an ever evolving system. Slot is reportedly a ‘fan’ of the 20 year old, while Liverpool’s scouting department are said to be ‘impressed’ by his talent.\n\nGuler’s technical control and spatial awareness speak to a player comfortable between lines, a modern attacker who could thrive in fluid structures. He would not replicate Salah directly, few could, but he represents a different solution to a similar problem, creativity where it has recently gone missing.\n\nLiverpool’s summer spending raised expectations further. Over £200 million invested in Florian Wirtz and Alexander Isak was meant to transform attacking output. Instead, Dominik Szoboszlai has emerged as the most consistent contributor, a reminder that solutions do not always come with the largest price tag.\n\nThe lack of goals and invention has defined Liverpool’s struggles. Guler, with his close control and progressive passing, could address both. Whether his arrival depends entirely on Salah’s future remains unclear, but the logic behind the interest is hard to ignore.\n\nThis report lands like a jolt to the system for Liverpool supporters. There is excitement in being linked with a talent like Guler, but also deep concern about what it represents. Seeing Salah’s future openly questioned feels unsettling. He has carried this club through defining moments, and the idea of January rumours turning into reality is genuinely shocking.\n\nThere is scepticism too. Spending heavily on Wirtz and Isak only to still search for creativity feels like an admission that the rebuild has misfired. Fans expected Slot’s methods to elevate the squad, not expose gaps so quickly.\n\nAt the same time, Guler sparks anticipation. Supporters crave invention, someone who can unlock stubborn defences and lift the tempo. The thought of a fearless 20 year old stepping into a side searching for identity is exciting, but also risky. Liverpool are not a development club, they are a pressure cooker.\n\nMost of all, this feels like a moment of truth. Either Salah recommits and the squad recalibrates around him, or Liverpool turn the page faster than anyone expected. Right now, belief is mixed with anxiety, hope edged with disappointment.",

    "fullText": "The most valuable EV company in the world is based in the US, but Americans are buying fewer battery-powered vehicles.\n\nEV sales in North America fell 1% this year compared to 2024, according to data from supply chain data firm Benchmark Mineral Intelligence. The dip comes as the US has faced a combination of policy changes, tariffs, and supply chain upheavals this year.\n\nThere were 1.7 million EVs sold in North America between January and November — far behind the 11.6 million sold in China and below the 3.8 million sold in Europe.\n\nUS automaker execs have been sounding the alarm bells on sales. In September, Ford CEO Jim Farley predicted that the EV market share in the US would nearly halve to around 5% in the near term.\n\nBenchmark Mineral Intelligence cited the $7,500 EV tax credit ending in September as a reason for \"subdued\" sales in the US, along with the Trump administration relaxing rules for automakers designed to encourage the transition to EVs and hybrids.\n\nElon Musk's Tesla has had a rocky year in almost all of its biggest markets, but it weathered the October drop-off better than its rivals, according to separate data from Cox Automotive. The world's most valuable car company, however, is facing a race against time to avoid a second consecutive year of declining sales.\n\nOther US EV makers have been hit by slowing demand, with GM and Rivian both announcing layoffs in recent months.\n\nChina's overall EV sales were up 19%. While BYD, the country's biggest EV maker, hit a rough patch in its home market amid rising competition from local startups, it set a record for EV exports in October.\n\nGlobally, EV sales were up 21% compared to last year, the Benchmark Mineral Intelligence data showed.\n\n\"Overall, EV demand remains resilient, supported by expanding model ranges and sustained policy incentives worldwide,\" said Charles Lester, data manager for Rho Motion, the Benchmark subsidiary behind the report.",

    "description": "UBS's billionaire clients say they're increasingly leaning away from the US. They say they're looking at opportunities in two other parts of the world.",
    "fullText": "Over the last few months, we've written about where billionaires live and how the uber-rich spend their money.\n\nA new report from UBS has the answers. This year, the bank conducted its annual survey of billionaire clients on several topics, including where they plan to invest their money for 12-month and five-year periods.\n\nOptimism in the near term seems to be highest around two areas in particular compared to 2024: Western Europe and China.\n\nForty percent of respondents said they see opportunity in Western Europe over the next 12 months, up from 18% in 2024. For China, 34% of respondents see opportunity versus 11% last year.\n\nThe Asia Pacific region, excluding China, also saw an eight percentage point jump in interest, with 33% of respondents bullish.\n\nOn the flip side, North America has dipped the most in popularity. While 80% of respondents liked the region in the 2024 survey, just 63% said they did in 2025\n\nThe shifts in sentiment are due to a number of risks that worry billionaires, the primary among them being tariffs.\n\nSixty-six percent of respondents cited tariffs as one of the factors \"most likely to negatively impact the market environment over 12 months.\" That was followed by a potential major geopolitical conflict at 63%, policy uncertainty at 59%, and higher inflation at 44%.\n\n\"I do not see North America as the top investment destination, even though its markets remain deep and innovative,\" one of UBS's European clients said. \"For us, geographic concentration creates risk, and the better opportunity lies in diversification. We prefer to shift focus toward real assets, which offer more tangible value and protection in volatile or inflationary environments. Equities over bonds can make sense in the current cycle, but our approach emphasizes stability and resilience rather than short-term market moves.\"\n\nStill, while shorter-term outlooks have changed since last year, views for the next five years have generally stayed the same for most regions compared to 2024.\n\nThe report also shared which assets exactly billionaire investors plan to put their money into.\n\nPrivate, not public, equity was the most common asset where respondents said they intend to put their money over the next 12 months. Forty-nine percent said they plan to have their money in direct private equity investments.\n\nThe next most common places to invest were in hedge funds and public developed market equities, both at 43%. Emerging market public equities (37%) and private equity funds (35%) were the next most popular answers.\n\nAt the same time, respondents also showed higher intentions of pulling their money out of private equity than publicly traded stocks.\n\nExamples of funds that offer exposure to the public assets billionaire investors are most bullish on for the year ahead include the iShares MSCI Eurozone ETF (EZU), iShares MSCI China ETF (MCHI), the Global X Emerging Markets ex-China ETF (EMM), and the Vanguard Tax Managed Fund FTSE Developed Markets ETF (VEA).",

    "fullText": "The automotive world has given us incredible engineering feats, iconic designs, and moments that changed transportation forever. But alongside these achievements are puzzles that have captivated enthusiasts for decades.\n\nFrom legendary prototypes that vanished without a trace to engineering decisions that still spark heated debates, these mysteries remind us that car history isn't always written in stone.\n\nSome questions may never have definitive answers, and honestly, that's part of what makes them so fascinating to discuss over a wrench and a cold drink in the garage. The following mysteries have different endings: while some have a pretty possible answer, others still have us scratching our heads.\n\nSteve McQueen's 1968 Highland Green Mustang GT from Bullitt became one of the most famous movie cars ever, but for decades, nobody knew where it was. Two identical Mustangs were used for filming, and while one was long believed to have met its end as a battered camera car, the hero car seemingly disappeared into thin air.\n\nThe automotive community spent years hunting for it, with rumors placing it everywhere from Mexico to a Kentucky junkyard. Then in 2018, it reappeared at the Detroit Auto Show, having been quietly owned by the same family since 1974.\n\nThe owner had kept it largely original, complete with movie modifications and that iconic roar, proving that sometimes the best hiding place is simply staying quiet.\n\nPreston Tucker’s 1948 Tucker ’48 Sedan was genuinely ahead of its time, featuring a rear-mounted engine, four-wheel independent suspension, and innovative safety features that Detroit wouldn’t adopt for decades. Tucker had originally promoted disc brakes and fuel injection, but those ideas were dropped before production.\n\nBut his ambitious venture collapsed amid controversy, SEC investigations, and allegations that were later dismissed in court. While Tucker was acquitted of all fraud charges, his company was already finished, leaving only 51 cars ever produced.\n\nWhether it was a case of an innovator crushed by established industry forces or a business that simply overreached remains one of automotive history's great debates.\n\nEveryone knows the 1966 Batmobile was built from a Lincoln Futura concept car by legendary customizer George Barris, but the question of what engine actually propelled it has caused decades of confusion. The Lincoln Futura originally had a 368-cubic-inch Lincoln V8, but various sources have claimed everything from keeping the original engine to swapping in a 390 or even a 429.\n\nBarris himself gave different answers over the years, and the car underwent modifications throughout its life. Three additional Batmobiles were built for promotional tours, each potentially configured differently, further muddying the waters.\n\nFor a car that's supposed to represent cutting-edge crime-fighting technology, its actual mechanical specifications remain surprisingly mysterious.\n\nGeneral Motors' EV1, launched in 1996, was the first mass-produced electric vehicle of the modern era and developed a passionate following among its lessees. When GM abruptly canceled the program in 2003, they made the controversial decision to reclaim and crush nearly every single vehicle, despite protests from drivers who wanted to purchase them.\n\nThe company cited parts, liability, and lack of profitability as reasons, but the dramatic destruction of a functioning, beloved product seemed extreme to many. Only about 40 EV1s survived, most of them deactivated and donated to museums and universities with their powertrains disabled so they couldn’t be legally driven on public roads, although a tiny handful have been kept or made operational again under very controlled circumstances.\n\nThe whole saga spawned documentaries and conspiracy theories, making the EV1's fate one of the strangest chapters in automotive history.\n\nThere's a popular story that Enzo Ferrari viewed road car production as merely a necessary evil to finance his true passion of racing. The famous quote attributed to him suggests he built and sold road cars only because he couldn't fund his racing operation any other way.\n\nWhile this makes for a compelling narrative that certainly captures Ferrari's racing-first mentality, historians debate whether it oversimplifies a more complex business reality. Ferrari clearly prioritized racing above all else, but the company's business model required both sides to function.\n\nWhether Enzo truly saw customers as merely checkbooks for his racing dreams or understood the symbiotic relationship between the two remains open to interpretation, though his legendary indifference to customer complaints certainly supports the popular version.\n\nIn the early 1960s, Chrysler built 55 stunning turbine-powered cars and loaned them to regular families across America for real-world testing. These weren't just concepts, they were fully functional vehicles with bronze metallic paint, rotating turbine-inspired taillights, and jet engines that could run on almost anything from diesel to perfume.\n\nThe program ran from 1963 to 1966, and the cars performed surprisingly well, but Chrysler ultimately decided not to pursue production. Here's where it gets weird: of the 55 cars built, Chrysler destroyed 46 of them, mainly to avoid long-term liability and support problems with such a unique fleet in private hands (the often-repeated ‘import duties on the Italian bodies’ explanation is only part of the story), leaving just nine survivors.\n\nThose nine survivors are scattered among museums, with a few in private collections, representing one of the boldest experiments that almost changed automotive history but didn't.\n\nMazda's unwavering commitment to the rotary engine, even when it nearly bankrupted the company multiple times, remains one of automotive history's most puzzling strategic decisions. The Wankel rotary engine offered a smoother, more compact alternative to piston engines, and Mazda licensed the technology in the 1960s with genuine enthusiasm.\n\nDespite chronic issues with fuel economy, oil consumption, and emissions regulations, Mazda kept developing rotaries for decades, culminating in the legendary RX-7 and RX-8. The company invested massive resources into an engine design that most manufacturers had already abandoned as impractical.\n\nWhile enthusiasts celebrate Mazda's dedication to uniqueness and the rotary's undeniable character, it's still unclear whether this was visionary persistence or stubborn defiance of market reality.\n\nJohn DeLorean's stainless steel sports car dream became reality with substantial backing from the British government, which invested over $120 million in a factory in Northern Ireland. The deal seemed too good to be true for an unproven car company, and it was: the project collapsed amid allegations of drug trafficking in a controversial FBI sting operation.\n\nDeLorean was eventually acquitted on grounds of entrapment, but by then, the company was finished after producing only about 9,000 cars. Questions remain about the financial arrangements, government motivations, and whether the whole venture was viable from the start.\n\nThe DeLorean story has everything: innovation, government intrigue, legal drama, and ultimately, immortality through Back to the Future.\n\nMost people credit Pontiac's 1964 GTO as the first muscle car, creating the formula of stuffing a big engine into a midsize body. But Studebaker enthusiasts will quickly point out that the 1963 Avanti R3 and the 1963-64 Lark Daytona with the R2 supercharged engine came first, offering serious performance in relatively affordable packages.\n\nStudebaker was installing high-performance V8s in compact bodies before Pontiac made it famous. The debate comes down to definitions: was it about the specific formula, the marketing approach, or the cultural impact? Studebaker certainly had the hardware first, but Pontiac created the phenomenon.\n\nWhether this makes Studebaker the forgotten originator or simply an earlier experiment depends on how you define the category itself.\n\nIt's estimated that hundreds of thousands of cars were built between 1900 and 1915, yet remarkably few survive today compared to later eras. These early automobiles, often called \"brass-era\" cars for their prominent brass fixtures, have survival rates that seem impossibly low given the sheer numbers produced.\n\nMany were simply worn out and scrapped, but that doesn't fully explain where they all went. The materials were valuable during wartime scrap drives, they were considered worthless old junk long before anyone thought to preserve them, and many likely decayed in barns and fields before anyone recognized their historical value.\n\nThe few survivors command enormous prices today, making you wonder how many treasures are still hiding in forgotten corners waiting to be discovered.\n\nThe 427 Shelby Cobra has legendary performance figures that seem to vary depending on who's telling the story and which magazine you're reading. While we know the top speed, published 0-60 times range from 3.5 to 4.5 seconds, and quarter-mile times are similarly inconsistent.\n\nThe problem is that these weren't factory cars with standardized specifications; they were essentially hand-built race cars with street registration, each potentially different. Testing conditions varied wildly, some cars had race modifications, and Carroll Shelby himself was known for optimistic claims. Modern recreations and continuation cars add to the confusion by posting different numbers with modern tires and tuning.\n\nFor a car that's supposed to represent pure, raw American performance, we still can't quite pin down exactly how raw it really was.\n\nThe Pontiac Fiero suffered from one of the strangest reputation spirals in automotive history, earning a “fire hazard” label that stuck far harder than the underlying facts.\n\nEarly 1984 Fieros did experience a higher-than-normal rate of engine fires, largely due to a connecting-rod failure in the 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine. But contrary to the common retelling, GM didn’t solve the problem overnight—the company didn’t issue a full recall until late 1987, after several years of incidents and negative publicity. By that time, the damage to the Fiero’s image was irreversible. Ironically, once the mechanical issues were addressed, later Fieros had fire incident rates much closer to other cars of the era.\n\nAnd when Pontiac finally perfected the formula with the vastly improved 1988 suspension and upgraded powertrains, the car was already living under a cloud it couldn’t escape. The Fiero remains a case study in how early flaws—and delayed corporate responses—can overshadow genuine engineering progress.\n\nThese automotive mysteries remind us that history isn't always as clear-cut as we'd like it to be. Some puzzles stem from lost documentation, others from deliberate secrecy, and still others from the simple fact that people remember things differently over time.\n\nWhat makes these stories fascinating isn't necessarily finding definitive answers, but the conversations they spark and the detective work they inspire. The next time you're at a car show or scrolling through auction listings, remember that automotive history is still being written and rewritten.\n\nWho knows what forgotten prototype might be gathering dust in someone's garage, or what long-held belief might be overturned by newly discovered documents tomorrow.",

    "description": "A tomb beneath Petra’s Treasury reveals 12 skeletons and 2,000-year-old artifacts. Archaeologists call it a rare find, unlocking secrets of the Nabataeans.",
    "fullText": "Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nA new tomb was discovered at Petra’s Khazneh, one of the New Seven Wonders of the World.\n\nThe tomb’s discovery, as revealed on Discovery Channel’s “Expedition Unknown,” also included 12 skeletons from over 2,000 years ago.\n\nIn addition to being a true archaeological marvel, the ornate facade of Jordan’s ancient city of Petra has served as a backdrop in a number of movies, including “Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.”\n\nThe sandstone cliff faces of the ancient city of Petra (one of the New Seven Wonders of the World) have long been in the archaeological limelight. They’ve even spent time in the Hollywood limelight as the location for several scenes in the film Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. But in a recent on-screen appearance—and no offense to Harrison Ford’s iconic professor—they were the site of a very real discovery.\n\nDiscovery Channel’s popular show “Expedition Unknown” was on site to document the discovery of 12 human skeletons and artifacts dating back at least 2,000 years, which had all been long hidden beneath the famed Khazneh (or “Treasury”) in Petra. The colossal find was accomplished by a team lead by archaeologist Pearce Paul Creasman.\n\nIt’s a find that, were he real, Indiana Jones would certainly be proud of.\n\n“This is a hugely rare discovery,” said Josh Gates, host of the Discovery Channel’s program, according to CNN. “In the two centuries that Petra has been investigated by archaeologists, nothing like this has been found before. Even in front of one of the most famous buildings in the world … there are still huge discoveries to be made.”\n\nCreasman, executive director of the American Center of Research, employed ground-penetrating radar to first see if it was possibile that additional tombs were located at the site. The gathered data matched up to data collected from areas where tombs had been found in the past, and the Jordan government gave the approval for excavation beneath the world-famous site.\n\nThe team was beyond pleased to see an actual tomb materialize, and truly shocked by the fact that it was full of remains and artifacts—many of the tombs at the ancient city have been found empty, picked clean long ago.\n\nAlong with the 12 sets of skeletal remains—several of the bones from which had mold, thanks to the porous sandstone allowing moisture into the space in the flood-prone area—the team found a mix of bronze, iron, and ceramic artifacts. This included one ceramic chalice tucked in the arms of one of the deceased, ironically reminiscent of the “Holy Grail” depicted in The Last Crusade. “It really was this awesome moment,” Gates said, “of history imitating art.”\n\nThe Treasury, located near the main entrance to the city, is believed to be at least 2,000 years old. It is a striking mausoleum carved into the sandstone cliffs that has long attracted tourists aplenty, but dating this iconic monument has proven difficult because of the lack of finds within the tombs.\n\n“We were hopeful to find anything that might tell us more about the ancient people and place,” Creasman said. For instance, Gates believes that the individuals buried in the newly discovered tomb show must have been of very high status because of the prime real estate used for the burial place.“Human remains,” Creasman continued, “can be a really valuable tool in that regard. The burials in this tomb are articulated, so the bones haven’t been rummaged around and moved, so that’s exceedingly rare.”\n\nDelving deeper into the remains and artifacts found in the tomb could open additional information about the Khazneh, Petra, and the lives of the Nabataeans who once inhabited the area. “I think learning who they are,” Gates said, “is really going to help unlock part of the story of the Treasury.”\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "title": "FA set to take action as fans lash out at Fifa’s ‘scandalous’ World Cup ticket prices",
    "description": "The eye-watering prices for World Cup tickets were revealed on Thursday",
    "fullText": "Football fans have voiced outrage over \"scandalous\" World Cup ticket prices, prompting the Football Association (FA) to raise concerns with Fifa, though there is little optimism within English football's governing body for a reversal.\n\nThe pricing structure for members of national team travel clubs and loyalty schemes, unveiled on Thursday, includes eye-watering figures, with the cheapest ticket for the 19 July final exceeding £3,000.\n\nThe Football Supporters’ Association (FSA) has urged the FA to challenge World Cup organiser Fifa on these costs, which the FSA branded \"scandalous\" and a \"laughable insult\" to the average fan.\n\nIt is understood that the FA will formally convey fans’ discontent to Fifa through appropriate channels. However, sources close to the governing body are not hopeful that this will lead to any changes.\n\nThe FA is deeply sympathetic to England supporters, who also face significant travel and accommodation expenses. The association had no input in setting the prices and reportedly only learned of the detailed pricing plan on Thursday.\n\nIn contrast, FA bosses Mark Bullingham and Debbie Hewitt have already pledged that affordable tickets will be available for Euro 2028 – which England will co-host with the Republic of Ireland, Scotland, and Wales – and that dynamic pricing, seen in earlier rounds of World Cup ticket sales, will not be implemented.\n\nDespite this, the FA has no influence over World Cup 2026 ticket prices, and there is a prevailing sense of realism that while concerns can be voiced, Fifa is unlikely to alter its course.\n\nShould England reach the final in July, fans wishing to purchase tickets through the FA’s allocation would need to spend more than £5,000 on tickets alone to attend all matches, even for the lowest-priced category.\n\nA statement from the FSA, published on Friday morning, declared: \"We back Football Supporters Europe in calling for a halt in ticket sales and we are calling on the Football Association to work with fellow FAs to directly challenge these disgraceful prices.\"\n\nThe FSA described the prices proposed to members of the England Supporters Travel Club (ESTC) as \"scandalous\" and \"a step too far for many supporters who passionately and loyally follow their national sides at home and abroad\".\n\nThe statement further criticised Fifa’s approach: \"Everything we feared about the direction in which FIFA wants to take the game was confirmed – Gianni Infantino only sees supporter loyalty as something to be exploited for profit.\n\n“This is a tournament that is supposed to be celebrated by the world, where fans of all nations come together for the love of football. Fifa have decided to make it all about the money and the elite who can afford it.\n\n“For Fifa, loyalty is not the hard-working fan travelling thousands of miles in support of their team at qualifiers around the continent. A game that should be for all is now only for those who can afford it.\"\n\nFootball Supporters Europe (FSE) estimates that fans will pay five times more to follow their team from the first game to the final at the 2026 World Cup compared to the last tournament in Qatar in 2022.\n\nTickets for the final in the participant member association (PMA) allocations begin at 4,185 US dollars (£3,130). Following England from first game to last buying the cheapest tickets would cost 7,020 US dollars (£5,250), before factoring in travel and accommodation.\n\nThe FSA also highlighted that ESTC members are being asked to pay for tickets through to the final, rather than just for the group games England are guaranteed to play.\n\n\"If England are knocked out before the final they’ll then return (the money), minus an admin fee of course. They are beyond shameless,\" the statement added.\n\nScotland fans, who have qualified for their first finals since 1998, face similarly high prices. The Scottish Football Supporters Association (SFSA) has called on national associations to \"hold FIFA to account\" over the ticket costs.\n\nJohn MacLean, CEO of the SFSA, noted that Scottish Football Association president Mike Mulraney – recently appointed chair of FIFA’s finance committee – is ideally positioned \"to express the widespread disappointment of Scottish fans and indeed fans all around the world at ticket prices that are, in some cases, five times the cost in Qatar\".\n\nBoth the FA and Fifa have been contacted for comment.",

    "description": "A New Zealand McDonald's is located inside a decommissioned plane, and multiple restaurants have been built inside historic homes.",
    "fullText": "Some McDonald's locations go far beyond the typical drive-thru experience, offering unique and unforgettable dining settings that redefine the concept of fast food.\n\nFrom a New Zealand McDonald's located inside a decommissioned plane to multiple restaurants built inside historic homes, McDonald's has transformed iconic and unconventional spaces into mind-blowing dining locations.\n\nMany restaurants have also been modified to comply with local laws. In Sedona, Arizona, there's a McDonald's with turquoise arches instead of the iconic golden ones, designed to complement the area's natural red rock scenery. A glass-walled McDonald's restaurant in Georgia has also received an award for its impressive architecture.\n\nHere are some of the most unusual and extraordinary McDonald's restaurants around the world.\n\nIt is the oldest surviving McDonald's location in the world. It doesn't even have a drive-thru — instead, customers walk up to the restaurant's windows to place their orders.\n\nSpeedee, a chef with a hamburger for a head, appeared on the original McDonald's signs alongside the brand's logo of two interlocking golden arches.\n\nSome signs also advertised the low price of McDonald's hamburgers — just 15 cents at the time.\n\nBefore being converted into a McDonald's and McCafé restaurant, the building was known as a cultural relic that had been the residence of politician Chiang Ching-kuo for one month during the 1940s, according to CNN.\n\nCNN reported that many locals objected to the restaurant opening inside the historic building, calling it a prime example of Western commercialism invading Chinese culture.\n\nHowever, since opening in 2015, the restaurant has become somewhat of a tourist attraction, welcoming visitors from all over the world.\n\nThe restaurant opened on October 8, 1990, in Shenzhen's Special Economic Zone.\n\nThe South China Morning Post reported that on its opening day, the unique McDonald's location received over 40,000 customers, despite having a maximum seating capacity of only 460. It was the first McDonald's to open in mainland China, making it a popular destination for both locals and tourists at the time.\n\nThe restaurant's roof is still adorned with the iconic golden arches to make it recognizable to passersby.\n\nAuthor and photojournalist Gary He, who has dined at over 100 McDonald's restaurants around the world, told Business Insider in 2024 that it was one of the most \"epic\" locations he has ever visited.\n\nNamed one of the \"world's coolest McDonald's\" on a sign outside the restaurant, customers can enjoy everything from a classic Big Mac to Chicken McNuggets and McCafe beverages inside the plane.\n\nVisitors to this unique McDonald's restaurant can also view the D3 plane's cockpit.\n\nThe building was originally the United Kingdom Hotel and was designed by architect James Hastie Wardrop.\n\nConstructed between 1937 and 1938, this restaurant has been called one of the most beautiful McDonald's buildings in the world.\n\nThe restaurant, which spanned two floors and was a replica of Ray Kroc's first McDonald's, was filled with music and pop-culture memorabilia.\n\nAfter the restaurant was partially demolished and modernized, the memorabilia once housed in the restaurant were added to the franchise owner's personal collection, The Chicago Tribune reported.\n\nKnown for its giant marquee featuring thousands of light bulbs, the restaurant — perhaps surprisingly — closed in 2020 not as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic but rather as part of McDonald's regular review of its restaurant portfolio, a spokesperson told NBC.\n\nHowever, a new McDonald's restaurant has opened in Times Square, meaning you can still get your fix.\n\nThe restaurant, built in 1993, is situated in one of Arizona's most beautiful cities, renowned for its awe-inspiring red-rock mountains, canyon walls, and pine forests.\n\nWhile the bright yellow color of most McDonald's signs might work in other parts of the country, the turquoise color chosen by the Sedona, Arizona, location blends much better with the surrounding landscape.\n\nSedona also has strict restrictions on the height of buildings and signage, which is why the famous arches are placed lower than at most other McDonald's restaurants.\n\nOn top of the large McDonald's restaurant, which also had a play place, was a statue of a NASA astronaut holding a container of fries.\n\nRonald McDonald and the rest of the \"McDonaldland\" characters lined the walls wearing space suits and posing against a starry background.\n\nMoored slightly south of the Gateway Arch on the Mississippi River, this McDonald's was the very first McDonald's to be opened on a riverboat.\n\nIt was open for 20 years before closing in 2000.\n\nSome McDonald's locations attempt to blend in with the local buildings and are designed more sympathetically.\n\nThis McDonald's location, however, was actually built inside a preexisting colonial mansion that's more than 150 years old. Located in Freeport, a small seaside town in Maine, the building was converted into the town's only McDonald's in 1984.\n\nThe restaurant is on Rue Saint-Lazare in Paris, France. Though the building is now a McDonald's, it is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nInspired by Roswell's extraterrestrial history, the interior of the spaceship contains a space-themed play area.\n\nThough you might think patrons can stroll up the steps to enter one of the most unusual McDonald's buildings in the world, customers actually enter from a side entrance.\n\nThe giant bronze eagle, designed by Portuguese sculptor Henrique Moreira, is usually the first thing customers notice when they approach the restaurant.\n\nThe colorful window is original to the coffee shop that previously occupied the space, and it features beautiful coffee-related scenes.\n\nThe restaurant has been called the world's most beautiful McDonald's.\n\nIt was designed in accordance with building requirements from the city.\n\n\"The building is unique to any I have ever seen and it is a joy to take a break and walk to the second floor and enjoy the view while I enjoy breakfast or lunch,\" wrote one TripAdvisor user.\n\nThe \"train station\" opened in 1975, and is also occupied by a Starbucks and a Popeyes.\n\nDespite having a unique theme, the restaurant still serves up McDonald's favorites.\n\nThe building was originally an 18th-century farmhouse that was converted into a Georgian-style mansion in the 1860s.\n\nHowever, Atlas Obscura reported that the fast-food giant faced pressure from preservationists to restore the home to its former grandeur.\n\nThe town then allowed the chain to build onto the existing building to create space for a drive-thru.\n\nThe station was built in 1877 by the Eiffel Company, which also built the Eiffel Tower.\n\nLocated in downtown Batumi, this McDonald's stands out for its reflective glass exterior. Patrons eating inside the restaurant can also gaze out onto the pool of water and manicured grass surrounding the building.\n\nThis location was built in 2013 and won the award for The Best Commercial Building of 2014 by the architecture website ArchDaily.\n\nThis makes for a great photo-op or simply a beautiful sight while patrons eat their meals.\n\nResembling a ski lodge, the restaurant fits in perfectly in the mountain town and the nearby Biltmore Estate, a grand home built by George Vanderbilt in the 1890s.\n\nHowever, the inside is grander than perhaps any outside viewer could expect.\n\nThe interior is also decorated with wallpaper, pieces of art, and hanging chandeliers.\n\nLocated in Lindvallen, one of Sweden's premier ski resorts, this one-of-a-kind \"ski-thru\" McDonald's allows guests to enter the building and order their food without ever even removing their skis.\n\nGary He told Business Insider that it was the most unusual location he had ever visited.\n\n\"The air is so clean and crisp — it's like being on top of the world,\" He said. \"When I visited, it wasn't even busy. It was just me, the McSki, and the mountains. I was just hanging out and enjoying myself.\"",

    "title": "Dell's computer prices are about to rise for corporate clients. Here's what to expect, and what it's telling sales staff.",
    "description": "Dell is increasing its prices on December 17 amid a global memory chip supply crisis. Business Insider obtained a list of price changes.",
    "fullText": "Your company's Dell laptops are about to cost more.\n\nStarting December 17, the computer maker is set to hike prices across its commercial product lines, according to an internal list of upcoming price changes sent to staff on December 9 and seen by Business Insider.\n\nThe list outlines price hikes for Dell's commercial business — meaning its sales to corporate clients rather than individual consumers. The commercial business accounts for about 85% of Dell's annual revenue in the Client Solutions Group (CSG), the division that sells laptops and PCs, according to its latest annual results.\n\nThe company is one of the leading providers of computer hardware to US companies, and prices aren't just rising at Dell. An industry-wide shortage of memory and storage chips is driving up costs across the PC industry, affecting competitors like Lenovo and HP as well.\n\nThe soaring demand for AI infrastructure has tech companies snapping up enormous quantities of memory and storage chips, increasing competition for consumer devices.\n\nA Dell spokesperson told Business Insider that \"like others in the industry, Dell takes targeted pricing action, when necessary, while maintaining supply continuity and its commitment to customer value.\"\n\n\"Our supply chain is resilient and globally diverse. It's designed to offer the needed flexibility when navigating macroeconomic, regulatory and trade dynamics,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nHow much more expensive a laptop at Dell will be next week depends on how much memory and storage you require.\n\nThe global shortages are hitting two key types of chips that are essential components in most user devices: DRAM and NAND.\n\nWhen you buy a laptop, DRAM — dynamic random-access memory — is the memory, usually 8GB to 32GB for an average customer. NAND — non-volatile flash memory — is used for SSD storage, typically around 512GB or 1TB.\n\nFrom next week, Dell Pro and Pro Max notebooks and desktops with 32GB of memory will cost between $130 and $230 more, according to the list of price changes seen by Business Insider. If opting for the top-of-the-range 128GB memory, the price is set to rise by between $520 and $765 per device.\n\nSelecting a laptop with 1 TB of storage will add to the overall cost by between $55 and $135.\n\nAn employee at Dell who works in sales said the percentage increase would be \"between 10% and 30%\" depending on the contract. They asked to remain anonymous as they are not permitted to speak publicly, but Business Insider has verified their employment.\n\nThe price list also includes price hikes for AI laptops containing Nvidia Blackwell GPUs and individual monitors. For example, a Dell Pro 55 Plus 4K Monitor, currently listed on Dell's website at $1,349.99, will be $150 more expensive, according to the price list.\n\nAI laptops containing an Nvidia RTX PRO 500 Blackwell GPU with 6GB will become $66 more expensive, and a 24GB GPU will cost $530 more, the pricing chart shows.\n\n\"It's impacting everyone, and there's no way around it currently, so customers will just have to pay more if they want the products,\" the sales employee said.\n\nHigher prices make for a tougher sell, already a challenge for sales teams amid today's tariff-weary consumers and enterprises.\n\nDell sent an email to its \"go-to-market\" (GTM) sales staff on November 25, which Business Insider has seen, outlining the \"critical next steps\" sellers should take to prepare ahead of the increase.\n\n\"Global memory and storage supply are tightening fast,\" Dell warned GTM team members.\n\nThe price of contracts for DRAM and NAND chips has \"already risen significantly this quarter, and suppliers are signaling further increases and allocation constraints driven by AI demand,\" Dell said in the email.\n\nThe company told its sellers to \"move decisively\" ahead of the price increases to \"protect value for our customers and for Dell.\"\n\nThe email advised teams to engage with top accounts in the coming week, close deals, and plan significant opportunities and multi-quarter deals to protect the sales pipeline.\n\n\"Ordering today for future delivery DOES NOT lock in current pricing,\" Dell warned, but said that acting now would help customers stay ahead of \"significant anticipated memory increase.\"\n\nThe Dell sales employee said that there had been an initial rush to help customers buy remaining inventory, but now the situation is largely viewed as \"out of our control.\"\n\nThe employee said Dell was also absorbing some of the costs internally, through hits to margins and limiting discounts that sales staff can offer.\n\nIn the company's third-quarter earnings call on November 25, Jeff Clarke, Dell's COO and vice chairman, said the market's price increases were \"unprecedented.\"\n\n\"We have not seen costs move at the rate that we've seen,\" Clarke said. \"Demand is way ahead of supply. And as we wade our way through that, we're going to lean on the things that we've always done.\"\n\nTech companies are buying massive amounts of DRAM and NAND to power AI models and cloud services, leaving fewer chips for consumer devices.\n\nCombined with global supply-chain tensions, the explosion in demand has prompted the three companies that dominate the DRAM market — Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron — to raise their prices.\n\nDRAM prices are expected to rise 30% in the final quarter of 2025, having already increased by 50% so far this year, according to Counterpoint, a global technology market research firm.\n\n\"The entire supply chain simply can't meet the demand that is now required and that inevitably leads to these kinds of challenges,\" Bob O'Donnell, the president and chief analyst at Technalysis Research, told Business Insider.\n\nThese price increases will \"likely have a noticeable impact for all types of PCs from every PC vendor,\" said O'Donnell, adding that the supply shortage is expected to continue throughout 2026.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "Platform fighting world-leading ban on grounds it contravenes implied freedom of political communication in constitution\n\nWill Australia’s social media ban survive a high court challenge?\n\nReddit has filed a challenge against Australia’s under-16s social media ban in the high court, lodging its case two days after implementing age restrictions on its website.\n\n The company said in a Reddit post on Friday that while it agreed with protecting people under 16, the law “has the unfortunate effect of forcing intrusive and potentially insecure verification processes on adults as well as minors, isolating teens from the ability to engage in age-appropriate community experiences”.\n\nReddit said there was an “illogical patchwork” of platforms included in the ban.\n\n“As the Australian Human Rights Commission put it, ‘There are less restrictive alternatives available that could achieve the aim of protecting children and young people from online harms, but without having such a significant negative impact on other human rights.’”\n\nReddit argued it was a forum primarily for adults without the traditional social media features the government has “taken issue with”.\n\nReddit was challenging the law on the grounds it infringed on the implied freedom of political communication. It was also seeking to challenge whether Reddit could be considered an age-restricted social media platform under the legislation.\n\nIt said it was not seeking to challenge the law to avoid compliance, and had implemented age-assurance measures since Wednesday.\n\nThe company said the vast majority of Redditors were adults, and advertising wasn’t targeted to children under 18. The Apple app store age rating for Reddit is 17+.\n\n“Despite the best intentions, this law is missing the mark on actually protecting young people online,” Reddit said. “So, while we will comply with this law, we have a responsibility to share our perspective and see that it is reviewed by the courts.”\n\nReddit’s challenge is separate from one filed by New South Wales Libertarian MP John Ruddick’s Digital Freedom Project group. The next court appearance for Digital Freedom Project group is late February, and Reddit expects it will be heard sometime next year, if the high court takes up the case.\n\nProf Sarah Joseph, from Griffith university’s law school, said she believes there was a strong case against the ban.\n\n“I do believe the legislation has cut off the main source of political information for people under the age of 16, in terms of their receiving and giving information. Whilst that is not the intention of the legislation, that is one of its many effects,” she said.\n\n“Whilst other sources remain open, they operate in very different ways and do not provide the same means to communicate one’s opinions, and the same variety of opinions.”\n\nBut Joseph said she believed the high court case was more likely to fail, as with most challenges to legislation on implied freedom of communications grounds.\n\n“The freedom is engaged in most cases, but the high court goes on to find the law to be proportionate. In reality, the constitutional freedom is quite weak due to the way that it has been interpreted and applied.”\n\nA law that has the effect of reducing the overall volume of political communication in Australia will be invalid unless it is proportionate to a legitimate purpose, constitutional law professor Luke Beck wrote in the Guardian on Thursday.\n\n“[But] the social media account ban only slightly reduces the overall volume of political communication in Australia,” the Monash University academic said.\n\n“The law does not ban teenagers from using the internet or having online group chats. It’s likely that in the [Ruddick] social media account case … the government will succeed.”\n\nThe Guardian revealed on Tuesday that Reddit had argued to the eSafety commissioner in September that it should be excluded from the ban.\n\n“The sole or significant purpose of our platform is to provide knowledge-sharing in timely, context-rich conversations; interaction between end-users is simply an incidental step to enabling this primary purpose,” Reddit said in the letter obtained under freedom of information laws.\n\n“It is not in keeping with Reddit norms for users to use their real names or identities on Reddit, as communities are not centred around real-time social networking among young people.”\n\nReddit does not promote real-time presence, friend requests or activity feeds that drive ongoing engagement, the company said. It said it was committed to collecting minimal personal information from users to preserve pseudonymity on the platform.\n\nReddit was a “pseudonymous platform organised around sharing information in topic-based communities rather than personal profiles or social networks,” the platform said.\n\nThe 10 platforms the government announced were covered by the ban – Twitch, Kick, YouTube, Threads, Facebook, Instagram, Snap, X, TikTok and Reddit – had all implemented measures to comply by Wednesday.",

    "description": "AI promises to make hiring fairer by reducing human bias, yet it often reshapes what fairness means—and locks in one definition. A three-year study of a global consumer-goods firm found that their algorithmic system privileged a rigid definition that sidelined manager’s local judgment. This resulted in narrow candidate pools and unhappy hiring managers. The study underlined that fairness isn’t embedded in code, it’s negotiated by people who design and deploy it. To make AI hiring systems work better for more people, leaders must ask: Which versions of fairness exist?",

With nearly 90% of companies now using some form of AI in hiring, this question is top of mind for many leaders, and it tends to split them into two camps. One side believes algorithms will make hiring fairer by reducing human “bias” and “noise” in decision-making. The other warns that algorithms can reproduce and even amplify existing inequalities at scale. Both overlook a crucial reality: When AI is adopted, it reshapes what counts as fair in the first place.",
