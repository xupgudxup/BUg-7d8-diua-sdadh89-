    "fullText": "PDC Q-School 2026: Storied names survive the early skirmishes originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nFormer World Champion and all round darts legend Steve Beaton has safely navigated the opening minefield at the PDC's Q-School 2026, booking his passage to the final stage after storming into the last 16 on day one. The Bronzed Adonis, still chiselled, still unflustered, still very much alive in the fight, can now exhale. What lies ahead from Thursday onward will be infinitely more punishing – but for now, the popular veteran, who reversed a decision to step off the main tour in 2024, has earned a brief ceasefire.\n\nKeeping him company in the hotel lounge is former World Cup winner John Henderson. The experienced Scot has done exactly what was required, nothing more, nothing less. Job done. Feet up. A couple of days’ rest secured, safe in the knowledge that when the real party starts, it’s always more fun when Hendo is invited.\n\nTHE PDC Q-SCHOOL: How to win a Pro Tour golden ticket\n\nFourteen other hopefuls have joined them in this early sanctuary, all punching their tickets to the final phase with days to spare – a priceless luxury in a week where energy, nerve and sanity are finite resources. They are:\n\nLloyd Walker (ENG), James Howard Jones (ENG), Jamie Kelling (ENG), Damien Grimes (IRE), James Evans-Bradford (ENG), Daniel Ayres (ENG), Killian McCormack (IRE), Jake Eichen (ENG), Joe Croft (ENG), Joseph Heywood (ENG), Paul Lewis (ENG), Charlie Large (ENG), Keelan Kay (ENG) and Jamie Tiley (SCO).\n\nMeanwhile, across the Channel in Germany, the same pattern is emerging. Among the early qualifiers in Kalkar is Brian Raman, the 2022 WDF World Championship quarter-finalist and former PDC Tour Card holder, who will be eyeing a swift return to the professional circuit after falling away at the end of 2024.\n\nStanding alongside him is a name that once sent shockwaves through the elite – Jeffrey de Zwaan. The Black Cobra. Two-time Players Championship winner. Former World Matchplay semi-finalist. Those achievements may sit almost a decade in the rear-view mirror, but at just 29, time has not yet closed its fist. There is still venom left.\n\nCompleting the European batch who earned passage to the final stage on day one: Sietse Lap (NED), Jeffrey Keen (NED), Dennis Van Bergen (NED), Jarno Bottenberg (NED), Jose Justicia (ESP), Gilbert van der Meijden (NED), Michael Hurtz (GER), Michael Van De Ven (NED), Michael De Mayer (BEL), Tomislav Rosandic (CRO), Mitja Gustorf (GER), Kris Mievis (BEL), Jiri Brejcha (CZE) and Luitsen Elzinga (NED).\n\nFor the full stories and \n\nDarts World subscriptions options include Print, Digital and All Access packages, as well as exclusive products and competitions",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump hasn't minced words about the larger message he's trying to send the world with the U.S. military raid to capture Nicolás Maduro and spirit the deposed Venezuelan leader and his wife to the United States to face federal drug trafficking charges.\n\n“American dominance in the Western Hemisphere,\" Trump declared following Maduro's capture, “will never be questioned again.”\n\nIn the days since the audacious raid, Trump and his team have doubled down on the notion that the new focus on American preeminence in the hemisphere is here to stay. He also held up Maduro's capture to make the case to neighbors to get in line or potentially face consequences.\n\nTrump’s rhetoric harkens back to the muscular talk of the late 19th and early 20th centuries when American presidents deployed the military for territorial and resource conquests, including to Cuba, Puerto Rico, Hawaii, Honduras, Panama, Nicaragua, Mexico, Haiti and the Dominican Republic.\n\n“There’s been periods, Vietnam and Iraq, which have evoked questions about a return to American imperialism, but the U.S. leaders’ messages in those periods were cloaked in talk of democracy. The way Trump is talking about it is something we haven’t seen in a very long time.” said Edward Frantz, a historian at the University of Indianapolis.\n\nIn the aftermath of the operation, Trump's tough talk has been been directed at titular allies in Greenland — where he renewed calls for the U.S. to take over the Danish territory for national security reasons — and Mexico. Trump says America's southern neighbor needs to “get their act together” fighting drug cartels.\n\nTrump has also warned that longtime adversary Cuba is “going down” now that Maduro, who has provided deeply discounted oil to the economically isolated government in Havana, has been deposed. And the president has heightened anxiety with Venezuela's neighbor, telling reporters that a military operation in Colombia — the epicenter of global cocaine production — \"sounds good to me.\"\n\nThe Republican president has also said his administration will “run” Venezuela policy and threatened the country's new leader, interim President Delcy Rodríguez, with an outcome worse than Maduro's if she does not “do what’s right.” He's made plain that he expects Caracas to open its vast oil reserves to U.S. energy companies, further igniting speculation about American overreach.\n\n“We’re going to have our very large United States oil companies, the biggest anywhere in the world, go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure — the oil infrastructure — and start making money for the country,” Trump said over the weekend.\n\nThe Venezuela incursion has split Latin America, with Trump‑aligned leaders mostly from the right applauding the ouster, and non‑aligned leaders condemning it on sovereignty grounds. It's sharpened concerns that Trump might actually be serious about his desire to annex Greenland as well.\n\nLeaning on Monroe Doctrine, Trump puts neighbors on edge\n\nDanish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen warned Monday that Trump would mark the undoing of the transatlantic military alliance, NATO, if he attempts to follow through on his assertion that the U.S. “absolutely” needs to take over Greenland for national security reasons. The alliance, which includes the U.S. and Denmark, has been a linchpin of post-World War II security.\n\n“If the United States chooses to attack another NATO country militarily, then everything stops,” Frederiksen told Danish broadcaster TV2.\n\nIn the early part of the 20th century, American leaders repeatedly turned to the Monroe Doctrine, a foundational U.S. foreign policy document authored by the nation's fifth president, which had been aimed at opposing European meddling in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nNow, Trump too is leaning on the doctrine to justify U.S. intervention in Venezuela and threaten action around the hemisphere in the name of protecting the safety and welfare of Americans.\n\n“Trump's rhetoric conjures up images of Teddy Roosevelt and gunboat diplomacy. The rhetoric is a return to a pre-Great War era,” Frantz said, referring to the 26th president's intercessions in unstable Caribbean and Central American economies as well as his backing of Panama's secession from Colombia in the name of the U.S. national interest.\n\nJust weeks before the ouster of Maduro, Trump rolled out a long-awaited National Security Strategy that had some disparate elements that seemed to be at odds with each other.\n\nOn one hand, Trump, who has long eschewed America's role in foreign wars, asserted that the administration would have a “predisposition to non-interventionism.” But the strategy document also made clear that the administration would push “to restore American preeminence in the Western Hemisphere.”\n\nWith the ouster of Maduro, the administration has clearly doubled down on the latter.\n\n“This is the Western Hemisphere,\" Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in an appearance on NBC's “Meet the Press” on Sunday. \"This is where we live — and we’re not going to allow the Western Hemisphere to be a base of operation for adversaries, competitors and rivals of the United States.”\n\nThe capture of Maduro and Trump's rhetoric could certainly be a level-setting moment for global leaders as they consider what may lay ahead in the final three years of Trump's second term.\n\nAt an emergency U.N. Security Council meeting Monday, Colombian Ambassador Leonor Zalabata Torres said the raid in Venezuela was reminiscent of “the worst interference in our area in the past.”\n\n“Democracy cannot be defended or promoted through violence and coercion, and it cannot be superseded, either, by economic interests,” said Zalabata Torres, whose country requested the meeting.\n\nAt the same time, Democrats are questioning whether Trump's actions have created a permission structure for Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has designs of capturing further territory from neighboring Ukraine, and Chinese President Xi Jinping, who has vowed to annex the self-ruled island of Taiwan.\n\n“What the president's done in this case has essentially given Putin and Xi Jinping a hall pass,\" said Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, in an appearance on CNN.\n\nThe Russians, for their part, have condemned Trump's action in Venezuela. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia, the country's U.N. envoy, said the world body “cannot allow the United States to proclaim itself as some kind of a supreme judge” to the world.\n\nAP writers Jennifer Peltz and Farnoush Amiri at the United Nations contributed to this report.",

    "fullText": "Former OpenAI employee Daniel Kokotajlo says progress to AGI is ‘somewhat slower’ than first predicted\n\nA leading artificial intelligence expert has rolled back his timeline for AI doom, saying it will take longer than he initially predicted for AI systems to be able to code autonomously and thus speed their own development toward superintelligence.\n\nDaniel Kokotajlo, a former employee of OpenAI, sparked an energetic debate in April by releasing AI 2027, a scenario that envisions unchecked AI development leading to the creation of a superintelligence, which – after outfoxing world leaders – destroys humanity.\n\nThe scenario rapidly won admirers and detractors. The US vice-president, JD Vance, appeared to reference AI 2027 in an interview last May when discussing the US’s artificial intelligence arms race with China. Gary Marcus, an emeritus professor of neuroscience at New York University, called the piece a “work of fiction” and various of its conclusions “pure science fiction mumbo jumbo”.\n\nTimelines for transformative artificial intelligence – sometimes called AGI (artificial general intelligence), or AI capable of replacing humans at most cognitive tasks – have become a fixture in communities devoted to AI safety. The release of ChatGPT in 2022 vastly accelerated these timelines, with officials and experts predicting the arrival of AGI within decades or years.\n\nKokotajlo and his team named 2027 as the year AI would achieve “fully autonomous coding” although they said that this was a “most likely” guess and some among them had longer timelines. Now, some doubts appear to be surfacing about the imminence of AGI, and whether the term is meaningful in the first place.\n\n“A lot of other people have been pushing their timelines further out in the past year, as they realise how jagged AI performance is,” said Malcolm Murray, an AI risk management expert and one of the authors of the International AI Safety Report.\n\n“For a scenario like AI 2027 to happen, [AI] would need a lot of more practical skills that are useful in real-world complexities. I think people are starting to realise the enormous inertia in the real world that will delay complete societal change.”\n\n“The term AGI made sense from far away, when AI systems were very narrow – playing chess, and playing Go,” said Henry Papadatos, the executive director of the French AI nonprofit SaferAI. “Now we have systems that are quite general already and the term does not mean as much.”\n\nKokotajlo’s AI 2027 relies on the idea that AI agents will fully automate coding and AI R&D by 2027, leading to an “intelligence explosion” in which AI agents create smarter and smarter versions of themselves, and then – in one possible ending – kill all humans by mid-2030 in order to make room for more solar panels and datacentres.\n\nHowever, in their update, Kokotajlo and his co-authors revise their expectations for when AI might be able to code autonomously, putting this as likely to happen in the early 2030s, as opposed to 2027. The new forecast sets 2034 as the new horizon for “superintelligence” and does not contain a guess for when AI may destroy humanity.\n\n“Things seem to be going somewhat slower than the AI 2027 scenario. Our timelines were longer than 2027 when we published and now they are a bit longer still,” wrote Kokotajlo in a post on X.\n\nCreating AIs that can do AI research is still firmly an aim of leading AI companies. The OpenAI CEO, Sam Altman, said in October that having an automated AI researcher by March 2028 was an “internal goal” of his company, but added: “We may totally fail at this goal.”\n\nAndrea Castagna, a Brussels-based AI policy researcher, said there were a number of complexities that dramatic AGI timelines do not address. “The fact that you have a superintelligent computer focused on military activity doesn’t mean you can integrate it into the strategic documents we have compiled for the last 20 years.\n\n“The more we develop AI, the more we see that the world is not science fiction. The world is a lot more complicated than that.”",

    "fullText": "Jensen Huang also announces at CES new, more powerful Vera Rubin chips that will arrive later this year\n\nThe billionaire boss of the chipmaker Nvidia, Jensen Huang, has unveiled new AI technology that he says will help self-driving cars think like humans to navigate more complex situations.\n\nThe world’s most valuable company is to roll out the new technology, Alpamayo, which is designed to help self-driving cars handle tricky situations such as sudden roadworks or unusual driver behaviour on the road, rather than just reacting to previous patterns.\n\nNvidia claims Alpamayo will bring chain-of-thought reasoning to self-driving vehicles, combining what the car sees with language-like reasoning.\n\nIn a speech at the annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, the Nvidia founder and chief executive said: “The ChatGPT moment for physical AI is here, when machines begin to understand, reason and act in the real world. Robotaxis are among the first to benefit.\n\n“Alpamayo brings reasoning to autonomous vehicles, allowing them to think through rare scenarios, drive safely in complex environments and explain their driving decision. It’s the foundation for safe, scalable autonomy.”\n\nNvidia has started producing a driverless car powered by its technology, the Mercedes-Benz CLA, in partnership with the German carmaker. It will be launched in the US in the coming months, followed by Europe and Asia. Huang showed a video of the car driving through San Francisco with a passenger sitting behind the steering wheel, their hands in their lap.\n\n“It drives so naturally because it learned directly from human demonstrators,” Huang said, “but in every single scenario … it tells you what it’s going to do, and it reasons about what it’s about to do.”\n\nHuang also said the company’s next generation of chips was in full production, and they could deliver five times the computing power of the company’s previous products when serving up chatbots and other AI apps.\n\nHe revealed new details about the chips, which will arrive later this year as Nvidia faces increasing competition from rivals as well as its own customers.\n\nThe Vera Rubin platform, made up of six separate Nvidia chips, is expected to debut later this year. The flagship server will contain 72 of the company’s graphics units and 36 of its new central processors.\n\nHuang showed how they could be strung together into “pods” with more than 1,000 Rubin chips and said they could improve the efficiency of generating what are known as “tokens” – the fundamental unit of AI systems – by 10 times.\n\nTo get the new performance results, Huang said the Rubin chips used a proprietary kind of data that the company hopes the wider industry will adopt.\n\nWhile Nvidia still dominates the market for training AI models, it faces far more competition – from traditional rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices as well as customers such as Alphabet’s Google – in delivering the fruits of those products to hundreds of millions of users of chatbots and other technologies.",

    "fullText": "The race to build artificial general intelligence has become one of Silicon Valley's defining obsessions.\n\nHowever, Daniela Amodei, the president and cofounder of Anthropic, suggested that the term itself — a shorthand to describe when machines might reach human-level intelligence — may no longer be a useful way to think about where AI is headed.\n\n\"AGI is such a funny term,\" Amodei told CNBC in a recent interview. \"Many years ago, it was kind of a useful concept to say, 'When will artificial intelligence be as capable as a human?'\"\n\nToday, she said, that framing is breaking down.\n\n\"By some definitions of that, we've already surpassed that,\" Amodei said, pointing to areas like software development, where Anthropic's Claude model can now write code at a level comparable to many professional engineers, including some inside the company.\n\n\"That's crazy,\" she said, noting how quickly those capabilities have advanced.\n\nAt the same time, Amodei said AI systems still fall short in many areas that humans handle with ease, making it hard to declare that machines have reached any clear, universal benchmark for intelligence.\n\n\"Claude still can't do a lot of things that humans can do,\" she said.\n\nThat contradiction is why Amodei believes the concept of AGI itself may be losing relevance.\n\n\"I think maybe the construct itself is now wrong — or maybe not wrong, but just outdated,\" she said.\n\nAmodei's comments come as Anthropic and its rivals pour tens of billions of dollars into increasingly powerful models and data centers, the infrastructure required to run them.\n\nWhile some critics have said that large language models won't lead to true general intelligence without major breakthroughs, Amodei said progress hasn't shown signs of slowing.\n\n\"We don't know,\" she said of what breakthroughs may still be needed. \"Nothing slows down until it does.\"\n\nRather than fixating on a single end-state like AGI, Amodei said the more pressing question is how increasingly capable AI systems are integrated into real organizations — and how fast humans and institutions can adapt.\n\nEven if models continue to improve at a steady pace, she said, adoption can lag due to practical constraints such as change management, procurement, and determining where AI actually adds value.\n\nIn Amodei's view, the future of AI won't hinge on whether it meets a textbook definition of AGI — but on what these systems can do, where they fall short, and how society chooses to deploy them.",

    "description": "AMD CEO Lisa Su says AI will soon need \"10 yottaflops\" of compute — a scale of computing power the world has never built before.",
    "fullText": "AI needs so much computing power that AMD CEO Lisa Su put it in terms of a unit most people have never heard of: the yottaflop.\n\nSu said in her keynote at CES 2026 on Tuesday that the world would need more than \"10 yottaflops\" of compute — a measure of how fast a computer is — over the next five years to keep up with AI's growth.\n\n\"How many of you know what a yottaflop is?\" Su asked the audience. \"Raise your hand, please,\" she added, before quickly explaining the term herself when no one appeared to raise their hand.\n\n\"A yottaflop is a one followed by 24 zeros. So 10 yottaflop flops is 10,000 times more compute than we had in 2022,\" she said.\n\nIn computing, a flop is a single basic math calculation. A computer doing 1 billion calculations per second is equal to a gigaflop. A yottaflop is equivalent to a computer performing one septillion calculations per second.\n\nIn theory, scientists say 10 yottaflops would be enough computing power to run complex, atom-level simulations for entire planets.\n\nIn 2022, global AI compute stood at about one zettaflop — a one followed by 21 zeros. By 2025, Su said, that figure had already surged to more than 100 zettaflops.\n\n\"There's just never, ever been anything like this in the history of computing,\" she said at the Las Vegas conference.\n\nSu's 10 yottaflop prediction is about 5.6 million times faster than the most powerful supercomputer today — the US Department of Energy's El Capitan.\n\nHowever, powering today's AI compute is already putting a strain on the US power grid. The build-out of energy infrastructure would be a big bottleneck in scaling up AI compute power.\n\nDuring the keynote, Su also used the stage to unveil AMD's next generation of AI chips, including its MI455 GPU, as the company pushes deeper into supplying data-center hardware for customers such as OpenAI.",

    "fullText": "Sweden captured its first World Juniors gold in 14 years, and just the third in program history. Two of the key figures were goaltender Love Härenstam and captain Jack Berglund, who once again led the way for his team. When the final horn sounded, the celebration was unrestrained.\n\n“What a group! I’m so impressed with how we come out today. Wow. There’s so much character in this team, I don’t even know what to say. I’m so proud of the guys, and I’m so happy, I’m so happy,” said Jack Berglund to the Swedish TV channel SVT after the game.\n\nBerglund recorded the primary assist on Sweden’s first two goals of the game. In postgame interviews, he was quick to emphasize the team effort and how much the moment meant to him personally.\n\n“You can hardly win anything bigger than this. You grow up with this tournament. To have the honor of wearing the C is huge, and it doesn’t get any better than this. I’m so happy,” he said.\n\nHe continued: “We’ve been talking about this since the summer, and I felt that something good was coming. Everyone has just grown throughout the tournament,” said Jack Berglund to SVT after the final buzzer.\n\nWhen asked what he will remember most, Berglund did not hesitate with his answer.\n\n“It’s the brotherhood. In this group, we’re everything to each other. From the players and coaches to the staff, everyone around us and everyone who has supported us. But above all, it’s this small group. Wow. I have no words,” said Jack Berglund to SVT.\n\nAnother strong performer in the final was goaltender Love Härenstam. Czechia scored two late goals to cut into the lead, but before that Härenstam turned aside several high-danger chances. When the final horn sounded, he was visibly overcome with emotion.\n\n“The best feeling in the world. I’ve never been this happy. So much fun,” said Härenstam to SVT.\n\n“We play really well, and they do a good job six-on-five at the end. Then it’s an incredible feeling when Ivar Stenberg manages to poke the puck in and you can finally let the emotions out. It’s magical!”\n\n“We Deserved That”: Goaltender Love Härenstam After Statement Win Love Härenstam reflected on an emotional New Year’s Eve win as Sweden defeated the United States at the World Juniors.",

    "description": "Chicago Blackhawks Prospect Anton Frondell wins the gold Medal with Team Sweden.",
    "fullText": "The Chicago Blackhawks were excited as an organization when they selected Anton Frondell with the third overall pick in the 2025 NHL Draft. He has since been great as a teenager in the SHL, and now he is complete with the 2025-26 World Junior Championships.\n\nFrondell and Team Sweden won the Gold Medal on Monday night. This is their first Gold Medal at the World Junior Championships since 2012. Every player on the team, including Frondell, played incredibly and deserves this win.\n\nSweden defeated Czechia 4-2 to take the tournament. To get to the final game, they defeated their biggest rival in Team Finland, in a shootout (Frondell scored the winning goal). Along the way, they were great at defending, scoring, and performing on special teams.\n\nThe final three minutes of the 2026 world juniors featured enough chaos for an entire tournament, but in the end, Sweden took gold for the first time since 2012 and just the third time in tourney history. \n\n✍️: @THNRyanKennedy https://t.co/r0Bc0Sxffa\n\n— The Hockey News (@TheHockeyNews) January 6, 2026\n\nOn the Silver Medal-winning Czechia team was Blackhawks draft pick Vaclav Nestrasil. The 2025 25th overall pick had a wonderful tournament as well, including an assist in the Gold Medal Game. Once again, Czechia had a solid showing at this tournament, and Nestrasil was a big part of this one. He finished the tournament with two goals and six assists for eight points in 7 games.\n\nOn the Gold Medal-winning Sweden Team, Frondell was one of their top players. After advancing to the championship, he was named one of the \"3 Best Players on Team Sweden\". Once they won Gold, he was named to the Tournament All-Star Team, along with being called the Top Forward.\n\nFrondell scored a remarkable five goals in the tournament. He also added 3 assists for 8 points in 7 games played. Those stats, his individual awards, and the Gold Medal speak to how successful he was for his country. It won't be long before he is in Chicago's lineup, making an impact.\n\n\"Incredible,\" Frondell said when asked how it felt to win. \"I'm just so happy right now. It's crazy. I love it.\"\n\nThe young players on this team seemed to enjoy each other. Their chemistry and friendship were strong off the ice, which led to success on the ice.\n\n\"This group, it's fantastic how tight we are. We're like a big family.\" Frondell continued. \"It's important if you want to win.\"\n\nChicago did have a third player participating in the tournament. AJ Spellacy and Team USA went out during the quarterfinals. They were defeated in overtime by Team Finland, ending their quest to three-peat at the tournament. Spellacy finished with one goal and three assists for four points in five games.\n\nAhead of the Gold Medal Game, Canada defeated Finland to claim the Bronze Medal. There were no Blackhawks prospects involved in that game, but there was a lot of scouting that took place.\n\nGiven the nature of the up-and-down season that the Chicago Blackhawks are having at the NHL level, it is hard to predict where they will be drafting. However, there were a lot of great young players who showed their stuff throughout the tournament:\n\nGavin McKenna Silences Critics With Four Points In Bronze Medal Win For Canada At The World Junior Championship TSN's director of scouting said it was a \"mixed\" tournament for the top draft prospect, who tied for second among Canadians with 14 points in seven games\n\nWorld Juniors 2026: NHL Draft Eligibles Stenberg, McKenna Highlight Standouts From Medal Day Sweden did it. They're golden at the World Junior Championship for the first time since 2012, with Czechia and Canada completing the podium.

    "fullText": "Wincing Nick Kyrgios loses: Australian Open in doubt after loss at Brisbane International originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nNick Kyrgios' hopes of playing in the Australian Open are under threat after a first-round defeat at the Brisbane International.\n\nThe 30-year-old was frequently seen wincing and grasping at his elbow during the straight sets defeat to American journeyman Aleksandar Kovacevic 6-3 6-4 on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nIn the early stages of the match, Kyrgios was smiling as he matched the world no.60 but when the American got on top, the mood turned sour with the Aussie looking pained with his right elbow.\n\nKovacevic snared the first set after converting the only break point he created, while Kyrgios didn't get any opportunities on his opponent's serve and only struck four winners to American's 14.\n\nMORE:Novak Djokovic makes shock decision ahead of the Australian Open\n\nIt was relatively even second set also, but Kyrgios gave up a break in the ninth game, before Kovacevic easily served the match out.\n\nKyrgios is relying on getting a wildcard off Tennis Australia to participate at the major, with it clear both parties are waiting to see if he will be fit enough to compete at Melbourne Park.\n\nThe Wimbledon finalist himself admitted he wouldn't accept a wildcard for the Australian Open unless he could compete at a high level.\n\n\"[John] Milliman gave his wildcard up for me when he was injured at the French Open,\" he said prior to the Brisbane International.\n\n\"He wasn't feeling 100 per cent, and that is where everything kicked off for me in my career. After that moment, I became a different player. I learned so much.\n\n\"If I am feeling great and I can get through this week and perform at the Australian Open ... people are paying good money to be there. If I can't give them the Kyrgios experience I would genuinely rather give it to someone that earned the wildcard and is in tip-top shape to start off something special in their career.\"\n\nIt wasn't a good sign for Kyrgios being beaten fairly easily by Kovacevic, who is a 27-year-old journeyman.\n\nIf it was just rust and lack of match fitness, Kyrgios still has time to get his game ready for the Australian Open with an appearance scheduled at the Kooyong Classic.\n\nBut after playing only six professional matches since being struck down with wrist and knee injuries in 2022, it's hard to believe we will ever see Kyrgios at his best again.\n\nThe best of Kyrgios - that we are likely to see again - is on the doubles court with Thanasi Kokkinakis or in the commentary box.",

    "description": "Raich Carter led the Lads to a famous FA Cup final victory in 1937. But Sunderland had another captain — every bit as much a hero as the man whose mural proudly looks down from the Blue House pub in his home town of Hendon.",
    "fullText": "The name Raich Carter is firmly embedded within the lore of Sunderland AFC and the hearts and minds of its followers.\n\nA son of Hendon, he was the local lad come good – a one-goal-every-two-games inside-forward who would lead the club to league and cup glory in the late 1930s and who is still, to this day, one of the youngest-ever captains to lead a side to top-flight English success. Having led the club to the English First Division in 1936 – that is the Premier League in old money for the millennial masses – he was then presented with the prospect of leading the side out at Wembley the following year in the FA Cup Final.\n\nMillwall had been successfully overcome in the semi-final three weeks earlier, with Sunderland showing the resilience to come from behind. The final whistle at Leeds Road, Huddersfield, brought the typical emotions – the elation that comes with success in such settings and, of course, the anticipation of the weeks ahead and the looming date with destiny as Sunderland aspired to return to Wearside laden with silverware.\n\nThe fortitude shown to come from behind would again be evident during English football’s end-of-season showpiece on 1st May as Preston, ahead at half-time, succumbed to the Wearside warriors in the second half, with Raich Carter amongst the goalscorers.\n\nBut Sunderland had another captain in 1937 — every bit as much a hero as the man whose mural proudly looks down from the Blue House pub in his home town of Hendon. Arguably more so.\n\nCaptain Frederick Robinson would have celebrated each FA Cup tie being won as much as anyone, but by the time Sunderland headed to Yorkshire in the hope Wembley was soon to follow, the focus of Captain Robinson, bred in the Barnes area, was on an upcoming journey that had more than memories and medals at stake.\n\nIn an increasingly polarised continent, Europe was coming to terms with the political phenomenon of fascism. Whilst some of its ingredients were hardly novel, the idea of absolutism and othering communities had been adequately packaged and presented with its symbology a nod to Roman history.\n\nThe adherence to such ideology had found allure, with Germany, Italy, and Spain the notable victims as an antithesis to the democratic will of the people became evident. In the latter, Spain, the 1936 election won by the Popular Front was both disputed and dismissed by Franco and his sycophants.\n\nA fascist disputing the electoral endorsement of the people. Wouldn’t happen now, eh…\n\nThe ensuing civil discord, carefully crafted by Franco, brought about the Spanish Civil War and, for the Spanish people, the demise of parliamentary democracy for four decades.\n\nBut some would not stand idly by. Not merely the Spanish people but ordinary decent people beyond Iberian borders.\n\nOne such individual was our very own Frederick Robinson. And by the time Sunderland and Preston were engaged in battle at Wembley he, with others from Sunderland, the wider North-East, and beyond, was the captain of the SS Knitsley as it made its way to Spain to bring aid to the beleaguered Basque people. Despite the trepidation of what lay ahead, on 1st May 1937 the crew of the ship had, temporarily, other matters to focus on.\n\nSunderland, their home-town club, were at Wembley, and for several hours these local heroes, part of what we know now as the International Brigade, were able to use the ship’s radio to keep abreast of how events were unfolding in London.\n\nThey celebrated. Briefly. Before long emotions were balanced and the precarious nature of their mission realised.\n\nSome made it to Spain. Some did not. Some took down aid whilst others took up arms. All to fight on behalf of the poor and disenfranchised. Their humanity and heroism is not diluted by the outcome of the conflict; it lies in their willingness to confront evil and the preparedness to make the final sacrifice if needed.\n\nThey are memorialised across modern Spain, from street name to statue, from plaque to plaza.\n\nThere is, however, no fitting memory or memorial to Captain Robinson and others from Sunderland within Wearside.\n\nIncredibly, if you want to see the inscribed names of those from Sunderland who fought Franco and fascism you have to go to the garden and grounds of Newcastle Civic Centre.\n\nThat, however, is about to change. With the assistance of the community that reared such heroes.\n\nSolidarity Sunderland are in the process of trying to ensure that those who, as the oft-espoused football chant says, were “one of our own” can have their voices heard and story told through a public memorial that accurately reflects their demonstrable opposition to the social disharmony and destruction of political poison.\n\nIf every second Saturday you go to the Stadium of Light to support a footballing International Brigade – all colours, creeds, and nationalities – then surely we can honour the local volunteers who were part of one that had so much more to lose than a football match.\n\nGet involved – your time and input can prove as invaluable as any financial contribution.\n\nFind out more at https://solidaritypark.com/solidarity-sunderland/\n\nPlease contact – solidaritysunderland@gmail.com",

    "description": "Here are the highlights from the world's largest technology trade show happening in Las Vegas, including a new Nvidia chip architecture.",
    "fullText": "The tech scene is starting the year off strong.\n\nOn January 6, the Consumer Electronics Show, the largest and most influential technology trade show, is set to kick off in Las Vegas.\n\nA CES keynote presentation of a new chip from Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang already got the show started.\n\nBased on early announcements, the audience can expect novelties this year like the Sweekar AI pet that physically grows, robots that can bend backwards, and a wallpaper TV that is only 0.35 inches thick. Business Insider's Lloyd Lee is also on the scene to report on the latest autonomous vehicle technologies.\n\nFollow this post over the rest of the week to keep up with the most groundbreaking tech at the 2026 CES.\n\nOn Monday, ahead of the Consumer Electronics Show, Huang officially introduced the Vera Rubin architecture, which is now in production and expected to ramp up in volume in the second half of the year. This move follows a blockbuster year for its Blackwell chip, as demand for AI infrastructure continued to surge.\n\nIn a press briefing ahead of Huang's keynote, Dion Harris, Nvidia's senior director of HPC and AI infrastructure solutions, described Vera Rubin as \"six chips that make one AI supercomputer.\"\n\n\"Vera Rubin is designed to address this fundamental challenge that we have: The amount of computation necessary for AI is skyrocketing,\" Huang told the audience during a presentation at the CES.\n\nHuang added that compared to the Blackwell model, Rubin marks a leap in performance, with more than triple the speed, could run inference five times faster, and can deliver significantly more inference compute per watt of energy.\n\nRubin was first announced in 2024 and has been slated to replace Blackwell ever since. The early debut comes months ahead of the late-2026 timeline Nvidia had previously projected.\n\nNamed after astronomer Vera Rubin, who discovered the existence of dark matter, Nvidia said in a press release that the architecture is designed to support more complex, agent-style AI workloads, as well as more networking and data movement.\n\nThe Rubin systems are already lined up for deployment across much of the cloud industry. Nvidia said partners, including Amazon Web Services, OpenAI, Anthropic, alongside the upcoming Doudna system at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, all plan to use the new platform.\n\nThe accelerated launch comes shortly after Nvidia reported record data center revenue, up 66% from a year earlier, driven largely by demand for Blackwell and Blackwell Ultra GPUs. Those chips have become a benchmark for the current AI boom are widely seen as a test of whether spending on AI infrastructure is sustainable.\n\nHuang has previously estimated that between $3 trillion and $4 trillion could be spent globally on AI infrastructure over the next five years. Nvidia said products and services built on the Rubin platform will begin rolling out from partners in the second half of 2026.\n\nNvidia's Huang also used his presentation to unveil Alpamayo, a new open AI model and toolset designed to bring reasoning to autonomous vehicles.\n\nHuang said that Mercedes-Benz cars powered by the system are already expected to hit the road in the first quarter of 2026.\n\n\"Our vision is that someday, every single car, every single truck, will be autonomous,\" said Huang.\n\nAlpamayo is Nvidia's first full-stack push into self-driving technology, with the goal of using vision-language-action models to handle rare and unfamiliar driving scenarios.\n\nMercedes-Benz CEO Ola Källenius said during the presentation that he recently tested the Nvidia-powered system on public roads and drove for more than an hour through heavy traffic.\n\n\"It feels that the car is on rails. You're just driving, and it does everything,\" Källenius said. \"If you're moving an object that weighs 4,000 pounds at 50 miles an hour, sorry is not going to cut it.\"\n\nBoston Dynamics is teaming up with Google DeepMind to integrate the Gemini AI into its humanoid robot, Atlas, and its robot dog called Spot. Unveiled with Boston Dynamics's parent company, Hyundai Motor Group, at CES on Monday, the partnership aims to let Atlas understand natural-language commands, adapt on the fly, and interact more naturally with people, with the goal of pushing the machine from lab demos into real-world work.\n\nExecutives of Boston Dynamics said in a press release that by embedding a foundation model, Atlas could move beyond preprogrammed actions to navigating unfamiliar environments and identifying and manipulating objects, all of which are core skills for manual labor.\n\n\"Atlas is going to revolutionize the way industry works,\" said CEO Robert Playter in the press release, \"And it marks the first step toward a long-term goal we have dreamed about since we were children—useful robots that can walk into our homes and help make our lives safer, more productive, and more fulfilling.\"",

    "title": "CES 2026: AMD Just Showed Off 'Helios,' the Hardware That Will Power the AI Content in Your Feeds",
    "description": "\"The world's best AI rack.\"",
    "fullText": "When you come across an AI video on Instagram, or watch ChatGPT respond to your query, do you ever think about how that content was generated? Beyond the actual programs and prompts, generative AI takes an enormous amount of compute to support, especially as it skyrockets in popularity. As such, AI companies are looking for more power than ever, which means, of course, turning to those that make the hardware.\n\nDuring a Monday evening keynote, AMD's CEO Dr. Lisa Su showed off the hardware that will soon power everything from ChatGPT to the AI videos overwhelming your feeds. Su introduced \"Helios\" against a backdrop of dramatic music, the company's upcoming AI rack, that packs a staggering amount of computing power into a rack that weighs nearly 7,000 pounds.\n\nEach \"cross-section\" of these racks, if you will, is powered by four key AMD pieces of hardware: The company's new AMD Instinct MI455X GPU, the new AMD EPYC \"Veince\" CPU, the AMD Pensando \"Vulcano\" 800 AI NIC, and the AMD Pensando \"Salina\" 400 DPU. There are some staggering stats here: Helios is capable of 2.9 exaflops of AI compute, and comes with 31 TB of HBM4 memory. It offers 43 TB per second scale out Bandwidth, and is developed with 2nm and 3nm architecture. The rack has 4,600 \"Zen 6\" CPU cores, and 18,000 GPU compute units. In other words, this isn't your average piece of hardware.\n\nSu's pitch is that the AI industry is in need of this additional compute power. She notes how the world used one ZettaFlop of computing power in 2022 on AI technology, compared to 100 ZettaFlops in 2025. (For the curious, one ZettaFlop has a value of 10 to the power of 21.) It's no surprise: AI is everywhere, and many of us are using it—whether we know it or not. Some of us are using it overtly, generating AI videos or running chatbots daily. But others are using AI quietly embedded in functions, like live translation.\n\nSu welcomed reps from OpenAI, maker of ChatGPT, and Luma AI, which creates generative AI video content, to talk about how additional compute helps their programs. But during Luma AI's demonstration of its hyperrealistic video generations, all I could think about was how this type of content is already tricking people into thinking its real, when it's entirely fabricated—not to mention the impact on human artists. AMD is optimistic about AI, and the data centers powering it, but critics have been pushing back, citing concerns with the impacts on the communities companies are building these data centers in.\n\nHelios will likely be a major success for AMD, but it comes at an interesting time for tech, and AI in general. AI is more popular than ever, but it's also more controversial than ever. I see hardware like Helios only fueling the fire in both directions.\n\nIn addition to Helios, Su announced the AMD Ryzen AI 400 series. These newest chips comes with either 12 \"Zen 5\" CPU cores and 24 threads, 16 RDNA 3.5 GPU cores, a 60 TOPS XDNA 2 NPU, and memory speeds of 8,533 MT/s. AMD says the Ryzen AI 400 series is 1.7 times faster at content creation and 1.3 times faster at multitasking whe compared to Intel Core Ultra 9 288V.\n\nThese new chips will ship soon in a number of major PC brands, including Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo, Beelink, Colorful, Gigabyte, LG, Mechrevo, MSI, and NEC.",

    "fullText": "After a heartbreaking loss to Czechia last night, Vancouver Canucks prospect Braeden Cootes and Team Canada have won Bronze at the 2026 IIHF World Junior Championship, taking Finland down by a score of 6–3. This is Canada’s sixth bronze medal at the World Juniors and their 36th overall.\n\nThe past few World Junior Championships have been rough for Canada, as they have been eliminated from gold medal contention by Czechia for the past three straight years. Their last gold medal came in 2023, during which they took down none-other than Czechia to achieve the feat. Prior to this year, this was Canada’s last medal placement. The last time Canada placed third at the World Juniors was in 2012.\n\nThe 2026 World Junior Championship was an interesting one for Cootes, who played predominantly on Canada’s fourth line despite a decent showing at his team’s training camp. In today’s game, Cootes scored his second goal of the tournament and played in a total of 6:21 minutes. He finishes the tournament with two goals, seven shots on goal, and an average of 8:48 minutes played per game.\n\nWith Canada and Finland’s bronze-medal game now wrapped up, fans’ attention will turn to Canucks prospect Wilson Björck and Team Sweden as they take on Czechia for gold. Sweden’s last gold medal game appearance came in 2024, during which they lost 6–2 to Team USA. Canucks players Jonathan Lekkerimäki, Elias Pettersson (D), Tom Willander, Liam Öhgren, and Zeev Buium took part in this game.

    "description": "UN body’s recommendations driven by AI advances and proliferation of consumer-oriented neurotech devices",
    "fullText": "UN body’s recommendations driven by AI advances and proliferation of consumer-oriented neurotech devices\n\nIt is the latest move in a growing international effort to put guardrails around a burgeoning frontier – technologies that harness data from the brain and nervous system.\n\nUnesco has adopted a set of global standards on the ethics of neurotechnology, a field that has been described as “a bit of a wild west”.\n\n“There is no control,” said Unesco’s chief of bioethics, Dafna Feinholz. “We have to inform the people about the risks, the potential benefits, the alternatives, so that people have the possibility to say ‘I accept, or I don’t accept’.”\n\nShe said the new standards were driven by two recent developments in neurotechnology: artificial intelligence (AI), which offers vast possibilities in decoding brain data, and the proliferation of consumer-grade neurotech devices such as earbuds that claim to read brain activity and glasses that track eye movements.\n\nThe standards define a new category of data, “neural data”, and suggest guidelines governing its protection. A list of more than 100 recommendations ranges from rights-based concerns to addressing scenarios that are – at least for now – science fiction, such as companies using neurotechnology to subliminally market to people during their dreams.\n\n“Neurotechnology has the potential to define the next frontier of human progress, but it is not without risks,” said Unesco’s director general, Audrey Azoulay. The new standards would “enshrine the inviolability of the human mind”, she said.\n\nBillions of dollars have poured into neurotech ventures in the past few years, from Sam Altman’s August investment in Merge Labs, a competitor to Elon Musk’s Neuralink, to Meta’s recent unveiling of a wristband that allows users to control their phone or AI Ray-Bans by reading muscle movements in their wrist.\n\nThe wave of investment has brought with it a growing push for regulation. The World Economic Forum released a paper last month calling for a privacy oriented framework, and the US senator Chuck Schumer introduced the Mind Act in September – following the lead of four states that have introduced laws to protect “neural data” since 2024.\n\nAdvocates for neurotech regulation emphasise the importance of safeguarding personal data. Unesco’s standards highlight the need for “mental privacy” and “freedom of thought”.\n\nSceptics, however, say legislative efforts are often driven by dystopian anxieties and risk hampering vital medical advances.\n\n“What’s happening with all this legislation is fear. People are afraid of what this technology is capable of. The idea of neurotech reading people’s minds is scary,” said Kristen Mathews, a lawyer who works on mental privacy issues at the US law firm Cooley.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, neurotechnology has been around for more than 100 years. The electroencephalogram (EEG) was invented in 1924, and the first brain-computer interfaces were developed in the 1970s. The latest wave of investment, however, is driven by advances in AI that make it possible to decode large amounts of data – including, possibly, brainwaves.\n\n“The thing that has enabled this technology to present perceived privacy issues is the introduction of AI,” said Mathews.\n\nSome AI-enabled neurotech advances could be medically transformative, helping treat conditions from Parkinson’s disease to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).\n\nA paper published in Nature this summer described an AI-powered brain-computer interface decoding the speech of a paralysis patient. Other work suggests AI may one day be able to “read” your thoughts – or at least, reconstruct an image if you concentrate on it hard.\n\nThe hype around some of these advances has generated fears that Mathews said were often far removed from the real dangers. The Mind Act, for example, says AI and the “vertical corporate integration” of neurotechnology could lead to “cognitive manipulation” and “erosion of personal autonomy”.\n\n“I’m not aware of any company that’s doing any of this stuff. It’s not going to happen. Maybe two decades from now,” she said.\n\nThe current frontier of neurotechnology lies in improving brain-computer interfaces, which despite recent breakthroughs are in their infancy – and in the proliferation of consumer-oriented devices, which Mathews said could raise privacy concerns, a bugbear of the Unesco standards. She argues, however, that creating the concept of “neural data” is too broad an approach to this issue.\n\n“That’s the type of thing that we would want to address. Monetising, behavioural advertising, using neural data. But the laws that are out there, they’re not getting at the stuff we’re worried about. They’re more amorphous.”",

AT&T said it has been developing the plan for the new headquarters for the past year.\n\nSeveral north Dallas suburbs are among the fastest-growing cities and towns in the US, and AT&T's spokesperson said the new campus will be closer to where many employees live.\n\nIn a memo to employees, which Business Insider obtained, CEO John Stankey acknowledged feedback about expectations for \"well-maintained and functional workspaces\" that were raised in an engagement survey last year.\n\n\"This is an investment intended to put the employee experience at the center of our workspace,\" Stankey said.",

    "fullText": "U.S. multinational corporations will be exempted from paying more corporate taxes overseas in a deal finalized by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.\n\nThe OECD announced Monday that nearly 150 countries have agreed on the plan, initially crafted in 2021, to stop large global companies from shifting profits to low-tax countries, no matter where they operate in the world.\n\nThe amended version excludes large U.S.-based multinational corporations from the 15% global minimum tax after negotiations between President Donald Trump’s administration and other members of the Group of Seven wealthy nations.\n\nOECD Secretary-General Mathias Cormann said in a statement that the agreement is a “landmark decision in international tax co-operation” and “enhances tax certainty, reduces complexity, and protects tax bases.”\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent called the agreement “a historic victory in preserving U.S. sovereignty and protecting American workers and businesses from extraterritorial overreach.”\n\nThe most recent version of the deal waters down a landmark 2021 agreement that set a minimum global corporate tax of 15%. The idea was to stop multinational corporations, including Apple and Nike, from using accounting and legal maneuvers to shift earnings to low- or no-tax havens.\n\nThose havens are typically places like Bermuda and the Cayman Islands, where the companies actually do little or no business.\n\nFormer Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen was a key driver of the 2021 OECD global tax deal and made the corporate minimum tax one of her top priorities. The plan was widely panned by congressional Republicans who said it would make the U.S. less competitive in a global economy.\n\nThe Trump administration in June re-negotiated the deal when congressional Republicans rolled back a so-called revenge tax provision from Trump’s big tax and spending bill that would have allowed the federal government to impose taxes on companies with foreign owners, as well as on investors from countries judged as charging “unfair foreign taxes” on U.S. companies.\n\nTax transparency groups have criticized the amended OECD plan.\n\n“This deal risks nearly a decade of global progress on corporate taxation only to allow the largest, most profitable American companies to keep parking profits in tax havens,” said Zorka Milin, policy director at the FACT Coalition, a tax transparency nonprofit.\n\nTax watchdogs argue the minimum tax is supposed to halt an international race to the bottom for corporate taxation that has led multinational businesses to book their profits in countries with low tax rates.",

The massive event is held across various locations, including the Las Vegas Convention Center, The Venetian, Mandalay Bay, and The Sphere, and is a staple event for both companies vying for recognition and media outlets that cover them. One day into \"Unveiled,\" the media-only prelude to the trade show, I landed on what might be my mantra for my CES 2026 experience.\n\n\"Cool, if true,\" Associate Tech Editor Michelle Ehrhardt had said about a new product booth, summarizing how I felt about the conference as a whole. Since arriving in Las Vegas on Saturday as a skeptical first-time attendee, I have seen cancer-detecting scanners, smart irrigation systems, and more assistive robots than I can count. I have also rolled my eyes at tech-enabled shoe insoles, smart-companion teddy bears, and AI-powered dog leashes. But I have also seen more grounded tech that lives just at the edge of where science fiction and practicality meet: walk-assisting exoskeletons, smart helmets with fall detection and one-touch SOS commands, and assistive mobility tech that can convert any standard wheelchair into an electric one. In short, CES is both chock-full of BS and a glimpse into the future of clever, helpful, and groundbreaking tech.\n\nTech Editor Jake Peterson, Senior Health Editor Beth Skwarecki, Associate Tech Editor Michelle Ehrhardt, and I will be on the ground at CES throughout the week, covering the biggest, coolest, and weirdest tech we can find. We'll also join CNET, PCMag, and others in awarding the Best of CES 2026 awards for a second year in a row. Follow us here and on social media to see what it's like to be at the world's biggest technology trade show, and share with us your thoughts, questions, and what you'd like to see. There's a lot more cool tech to come. If true, of course.\n\n-Jordan Calhoun, Editor in Chief",

The TTP is separate from Afghanistan’s Taliban, which has governed the country since 2021 and says it does not allow its territory to be used for attacks against other countries.\n\nTensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan have persisted since early October when Pakistan carried out airstrikes on what it described as Pakistani Taliban hideouts inside Afghanistan, killing dozens of alleged insurgents.\n\nAfghan forces retaliated by targeting Pakistani military posts and claimed to have killed 58 soldiers.

What’s going on?” Barretto asked about the travel time between races when drivers share flights.\n\n“Myself, George Russell and Alex Albon had an UNO World Championship on the way from Baku to Singapore last year,” Piastri laughed. “There was some questionable rule decisions, and rules that I’d never heard of playing UNO before from some of the others, mainly George.\n\n\"Apparently, they were family rules.\"\n\nBarretto asked whether these rules from the Mercedes driver tipped the scales in his favour.\n\n\"Yes, they did,\" he smiled. \"We’re always competitive at everything, all the drivers. It’s always good fun.”\n\nHis competitiveness predates his career in motorsport. Like many, including seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton, he started with RC racing.\n\n\"Been a competitive person since I was really little,\" he said. \"But channelling that into racing and motorsport...Yeah, started with RC cars, won a national championship at nine and then started racing go-karts a year later.\"\n\nPiastri, like a lot of drivers, lives in Monaco.\n\n\"It's convenient when you want to go and play padel or do other things,\" he said on the subject. \"Also makes travelling to the races convenient. Like I'm sure most people have seen, we often travel to races together and stuff on those plane journeys.\"\n\nHe added: “It's pretty cool to come here when the races are done. It's a bit more relaxed when there's no racing.”\n\nAfter a strong start to his career in F1 and a championship contender for 2025, he has suddenly exploded in popularity - something he's still getting to grips with.\n\n“It is still a little bit strange,” he said. “Obviously at the track you expect the attention, but there has been times where you go in the supermarket or whatever, out of nowhere, someone's asking for a photo or an autograph or whatever, or even just asking, 'is that really you?'”\n\nPiastri will be hoping to continue the momentum he's found in his first three seasons into 2026.\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

    "description": "A look at 10 players who have made a difference at this year's world junior hockey championship in Minnesota.",
    "fullText": "While it was a disappointing tournament for the host Americans, the 2026 world juniors have been a thrill ride for any hockey fan tuning in. Team USA was bounced in the quarterfinal by Finland - in overtime, no less - but the semifinals produced two beguiling games.\n\nSweden punched its ticket to the gold-medal game by besting archrival Finland in a shootout, while the Canadians and Czechs added another chapter to their burgeoning rivalry with a nasty back-and-forth game eventually won 6-4 by the Czechs.\n\nIt has been more than a decade since any country other than Canada, Finland or the U.S. has won gold at the world juniors and that streak now officially ends. With Sweden (2012) and Czechia (2001) both looking for a title after many years, the final game of the tournament promises to hold intrigue.\n\nBut what about the players themselves? There have been some fantastic individual performances in the tournament, so let's take a look at some of the standouts.\n\nLoaned out by the Calgary Flames for the world juniors, Parekh has shown why Canada wanted him for the tournament. Despite being a defenseman, Parekh entered the bronze-medal game tied for the tourney lead in scoring with 11 points in six games.\n\nThe Chicago Blackhawks first-rounder has been a monster for the Swedes and perhaps his most important goal to date came in the semifinal against Finland when he iced the contest with the winning shootout goal. Frondell's shot is a weapon and it has been on full display.\n\nThough the Americans were much weaker than in previous years, Zellers was a very pleasant surprise. The University of North Dakota winger and Boston Bruins pick led the U.S. in scoring with eight points in five games while playing an electric style.\n\nNow the highest-scoring defenseman in Czech world junior history, Galvas continues to add to his totals. Undrafted because of his small stature, he plays a similar game to Lane Hutson and could very well be selected in this summer's draft. Why not take a chance, right?\n\nSlovakia brought a young team to Minnesota and one of the best was 2026 draft prospect Chrenko, whose awesome shot propelled him up the scoring charts. His five goals in five games paced his team and he certainly helped his draft stock.\n\nHeavily scrutinized thanks to his top-prospect status, McKenna nonetheless has been one of the top scorers at the world juniors with 10 points in six games. The potential No. 1 pick in the 2026 draft got in trouble in the Czech game due to some fiery behavior.\n\nAnother top scorer in the tournament, Hage is a Montreal Canadiens first-rounder and a star at the University of Michigan. He made a ton of skilled plays for Canada and his chemistry with McKenna and Brady Martin (Nashville Predators) was something to see.\n\nThe captain of the Swedes, Berglund is a two-way center and a Philadelphia Flyers prospect who has made an impact at both ends of the ice for his team. Should Sweden win gold, Berglund undoubtedly will be part of the winning formula.\n\nA speedster with skill, Saarelainen is a Tampa Bay Lightning prospect who plays back home in Finland in the top pro league. He was very involved in Finland's offense against Sweden and is one to watch in the bronze-medal game against Canada.\n\nA first-round draft prospect for 2026, Bjorck is fast and skilled. He is clearly trusted by Sweden's coaches too, as they sent him over the boards every other shift in overtime against Finland, where he had an amazing four breakaways. While he couldn't convert, he's a talent.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Draft hopefuls and NHL prospects who headlined the world juniors",

    "description": "Scotland will face Haiti in Boston on Sunday 14 June before taking on Morocco and Brazil in the US.",
    "fullText": "A public holiday will mark Scotland's men's national team playing in its first World Cup since 1998.\n\nScotland will face Haiti in Boston at 02:00 GMT on Sunday 14 June, before taking on Morocco and Brazil in their remaining group fixtures in the United States.\n\nFirst Minister John Swinney has proposed that 15 June is designated as a national bank holiday - though the move will only affect staff directly employed by the Scottish government.\n\nLike the St Andrews' Day bank holiday, other employers would not be compelled to observe it.\n\nThe proposal will be formally confirmed once it has been rubber-stamped by the King.\n\nSpeaking at an event in Glasgow, Swinney said: \"The whole nation will come to a standstill in June - even more so in July once we've seen off Brazil and progressed to the knockout stages.\n\n\"This is a moment 28 years in the waiting - and I want as many people as possible to share the occasion.\"\n\nHe added: \"That will mean that supporters across the country can watch our men's team in their first World Cup match for almost 30 years, and share in the chance for Scotland to be on the world stage, to attract business development, to create tourism and hospitality interest within the country and to make deep and lasting cultural and sporting connections.\"\n\nScotland is able to set distinct bank holidays from the rest of the UK.\n\nA day can be appointed as a bank holiday in Scotland by royal proclamation.\n\nThe first minister is able to advise the Privy Council - an advisory board to the monarch - on proclamations for Scotland, which are formally signed off by the King.\n\nScotland face Morocco in Boston on 19 June, and Brazil in Miami on 24 June. Both games kick off at 23:00 GMT.\n\nSwinney has previously said that the government would work with local authorities on extending pub opening hours during the World Cup.\n\nThe Scottish government simply does not have the power to give people across the country - including those working in the private sector or in parts of the public sector controlled by the UK government - an extra, specified day off work.\n\nBut an extra holiday may be a pragmatic response to the situation some businesses may face on the morning after Scotland's opening World Cup game. How many might want to stay up late and then take the day off?\n\nDecisions on whether or not to give staff the day off are for individual employers to take.\n\nIn general, bank or public holidays do not have to be given as paid leave by employers.\n\nAn employer can choose to include bank holidays as part of a worker's statutory annual leave.\n\nEmployment contracts tend to specify that employers have a certain number of days off every year - inclusive of bank holidays.\n\nNor is there any reason why private business would need to close. There are no restrictions on opening hours on bank holidays.\n\nEven the major Scottish high street banks do not close on Scottish bank holidays now - they observe English bank holidays, to stay in line with their sister businesses south of the border.\n\nSchool holidays are already set for the coming year by individual councils. Some may consider whether to look at giving the special bank holiday as a day off, but there are also rules on how many days schools need to open for to consider.\n\n'Scotland qualifying for the World Cup put me in hospital'\n\nScots celebrate reaching first World Cup in nearly 30 years",

    "description": "Jason Lemkin, the founder of SaaStr, the world's largest community of business-to-business executives and founders, is swapping out human workers for AI.",
    "fullText": "Jason Lemkin, known to some as the Godfather of SaaS, says the time has come to push the limits of AI in the workplace.\n\nIn practice, Lemkin, the founder of SaaStr, the world's largest community of business-to-business founders, said on Lenny's Podcast recently that this means he will stop hiring humans in his sales department.\n\nInstead, SaaStr is going all in on agents, which are commonly defined as virtual assistants that can complete tasks autonomously. They break down problems, outline plans, and take action without being prompted by a user.\n\nHe said the company now has 20 AI agents automating tasks once handled by a team of 10 sales development representatives and account executives.\n\nThat move from an entirely human workforce to an agent-based workforce was rapid.\n\nIn May, SaaStr had just one AI agent in production that it used for various digital tasks, Lemkin said. That month, though, during the SaaStr Annual — its yearly gathering of over 10,000 founders, executives, and VCs — two of its high-paid sales representatives abruptly quit.\n\nLemkin said he turned to his chief AI officer and said, \"We're done with hiring humans in sales. We're going to push the limits with agents.\"\n\nLemkin's calculus was that it just wasn't worth the cost of hiring another junior sales representative for a $150,000 a year position who would eventually quit, when he could use a loyal AI agent instead.\n\nAmelia Lerutte, SaaStr's chief AI officer, told Business Insider by email that by June, the company began ramping up the number of agents it had in production.\n\n\"We had only 1 non-core agent at the time with Delphi, but didn't go deep on 2 to 20+ until the beginning of June,\" she said. \"It was a conscious choice after their departure to reallocate some (but not all) head count spend to agents.\"\n\nAt the SaaStr office, the 10 desks that once belonged to humans on the go-to-market team are now labeled with the names of agents, like \"Quali for qualified,\" \"Arty for artisan,\" and \"Repli for Replit,\" Lemkin said.\n\nLemkin said SaaStr is training its agents on its best humans.\n\n\"Train an agent with your best person, and best script, then that agent can start to become a version of your best salesperson,\" he said.\n\nSaaStr's process is similar to how Vercel, the cloud-based platform for developers, trained a sales agent off its top performer for six weeks by documenting every step of their work, and then building an agent to mimic their process.\n\nMany companies are experimenting with AI agents, but risks remain. One of the big ones is the threat of data leaks and cybercrime.\n\n\"AI agents, in order to have their full functionality, in order to be able to access applications, often need to access the operating system or the OS level of the device on which you're running them,\" Harry Farmer, a senior researcher at the Ada Lovelace Institute, recently told Wired.\n\nAll of that access creates more potential attack points for cybercriminals.\n\nSecurity threats aside, Lemkin said that the net productivity of agents is about the same as humans. However, he said, agents are more efficient and can scale — just like software.",

    "description": "Entrepreneurs and tech workers from around the world describe how they navigated the many cloud outages in 2025.",
    "fullText": "November 18 was supposed to be a routine workday for Rwanda-based entrepreneur Derrick Ikenga. But it turned out to be a nightmare he wasn’t prepared for.\n\nCloudflare, a U.S.-based cloud services and cybersecurity firm, faced a massive global outage that day, taking down large parts of the internet, including operations of giants like X (formerly Twitter) and ChatGPT.\n\nIkenga’s company, which builds sales automation tools for clients, also uses Cloudflare. The outage brought the tools to a grinding halt, sending his clients into panic mode.\n\nFor many entrepreneurs and tech workers, this was a familiar experience in 2025. Today, an estimated 94% of enterprise services worldwide rely on at least one major cloud provider, such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud, for hosting, data storage, or delivery. Together, the three largest providers control more than 62% of the global cloud market.\n\nBetween August 2024 and August 2025, AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud together experienced more than 100 service outages. The duration of these outages varied between a few minutes and several hours. AWS saw one of the biggest and most widespread cloud outages of 2025 when its services went down for 15 hours in October. The outage affected over 4 million users and more than 1,000 companies.\n\nWhen an outage occurs, cloud service providers are responsible for restoring services as soon as possible. In some cases, providers compensate affected customers with free cloud credit.\n\nEach time such disruptions occurred, everyday moments began to fail in unexpected ways. Online payments failed. Doctors were unable to access patients’ health records. CCTV cameras went offline. Doorbells stopped working. Smart mattresses lost their sleep-tracking features.\n\nThe outage offered a glimpse into just how deeply cloud infrastructure is woven into modern life, powering everything from bank transfers to flight bookings and movie streams.\n\nRest of World brings together first-person accounts from entrepreneurs and technology workers around the world, tracing what happened when the cloud failed in 2025.\n\nThe quotes have been edited for length and brevity.\n\nFrancisco Osorio, a Mexico-based senior go-to-market marketing engineer at Simetrik, an operational control and management automation company\n\nI couldn’t do anything other than feel helpless.\n\nI am responsible for the smooth functioning of my company’s website, among other things. During the November AWS outage, the website stopped functioning, but I was unable to take any action because I lost access to all my work-related platforms, like HubSpot, Slack, and Salesforce. [Some users of AWS experienced issues on November 5, according to outage tracking website Downdetector.com. An AWS spokesperson denied the claims in comments to Reuters.]\n\nEven as we were sorting through internal issues, our clients also couldn’t log into the platform, which was a more serious concern because we need to comply with service level agreements under which we assure quality and quantity of service.\n\nI couldn’t do anything other than feel helpless. All I could tell everyone around was, “I’m deeply sorry, I cannot help you today. Our platforms are not running.”\n\nSundeep Narwani, India-based co-founder of Narrative Research Labs, a firm focusing on AI in media\n\nBeing an AI company, we’re quite heavily dependent on the cloud. The outages have wasted a lot of time for our clients and us, rendering us helpless in most cases.\n\nThe outages have wasted a lot of our time.\n\nThe first time it happened, we didn’t know what to do or how to deal with it, and we entered panic mode. My biggest concern was on two fronts: downtime disrupting our processes, and our clients being obviously very angry because we deliver a lot of daily reports for them.\n\nWhen it happened the second time, we created a standard operating procedure to deal with it because someone like me, who is involved in business development apart from being the CEO, cannot be available all the time to handle these issues.\n\nWe delegate a project manager to handle issues of cloud outages and ensure our customers are taken care of during such times while finding a quick solution to the downtime.\n\nWe have also purchased a local server to replicate what AWS does, so that if there is any kind of outage again, we have one local server to tide us over. Obviously, it doesn’t have the same kind of performance that AWS gives us, but at least the team can function. But these are just temporary options.\n\nDavid Nandwa, founder of Honeycoin, a Kenyan cross-border payment company\n\nWe have faced cloud outage issues in the past and were also hit with the recent AWS outage in November.\n\nThe approach we have applied to dealing with this is to have a “distributed stack” or multiple fallback options. We rely on multiple clouds, including AWS, Google Cloud, and Heroku. During the recent AWS outage, we temporarily switched to Google Cloud to maintain service availability for most of our customers.\n\nIf all cloud providers are down, we then fall back to using an on-premise server that we’ve created. It doesn’t perform as efficiently as our providers, but it comes in handy in moments where all the major providers are down. It’s locally hosted, so it’s an option to process requests when all else fails.\n\nSubscribing to multiple cloud providers definitely helps us not only to hedge against future risk but also to decrease reliance on a single one, and risk losing our data completely.\n\nHowever, multiple providers mean multiple bills at the end of the month.\n\nThe one-off cost of a single on-premise server installation is something we’re seriously considering to decrease reliance on the large players and also have more digital sovereignty. It’s pretty simple to set up, but it requires a lot of work to move our stack from any of the globally reputable providers to our own direct stack.\n\nOlumide Egbigbola, Nigeria-based product manager at Leatherback, a cross-border payment startup\n\nCompanies like ours can’t do much in such cases.\n\nCloud infrastructure is the backbone of most of the things that we do, as most of our critical services are hosted in the cloud. So any downtime from our cloud provider is immediately felt by our individuals and business users. We face complaints of transaction delays, and the app slowing down or being unresponsive.\n\nThis usually causes a lot of anxiety amongst users who can’t access their money.\n\nCompanies like ours can’t do much in such cases other than inform our users about the downtime.\n\nWe try to spread our cloud services and route traffic through regions that are less affected or unaffected, so that users can at least perform minimal activities while we wait for the major downtime to be over.",

    "fullText": "A Dublin man is leading the construction of the world's largest ever telescope. The Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) is approximately 70% built in the Andes Mountains in Chile.\n\nProfessor Tom Ray is president of the European Southern Observatory (ESO), which is building the telescope.\n\n\"We're talking about a mirror, right, that is 40 metres across,\" he explained on RTÉ's This Week.\n\n\"The dome is the size of the Colosseum in Rome, but actually taller than the Colosseum, but roughly about the same width.\"\n\nThe ELT is due to be completed in 2028 and is expected to cost €1.5 billion.\n\n\"It is enormous compared to anything, any sort of telescope that's been built in the past,\" he said.\n\n\"And with it, it would be possible, for example, to not only image Earth-sized planets around nearby stars, but also to explore their atmosphere.\n\n\"We want to see if there's any signs of life on the planet or whether there's any oxygen, the things that would give rise to life.\"\n\nIreland has been a member of ESO since 2019, Prof Ray said there is a lot of Irish input into the ELT project.\n\n\"The University of Galway, for example, is involved in building what we call an adoptive optics,\" he explained this as using lasers to sharpen the images of stars as seen by telescopes.\n\nIreland becoming more prominent in space exploration\n\nSenior Irish scientists say Ireland is becoming more prominent in space exploration, creating more jobs and opportunities.\n\nIn 2025, Ireland successfully completed its first satellite mission in space.\n\nBelfast-born astronaut Dr Rosemary Coogan became a European Space Agency (ESA) astronaut this year, through UK government funding.\n\nNorah Patten is expected to go into space on a commercial flight in 2027.\n\nIn March 2025, Ireland joined CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research.\n\nAnd scientists in Galway will be among the first to use the ELT when it goes live.\n\nThe scientists are studying a project on exoplanets with Italian scientists, and earlier this year, found the planet WISPIT 2b. It is about 430 light-years away from Earth.\n\nEIRSAT-1: Ireland's first satellite\n\nEIRSAT-1 was launched in January 2023 and burned back into the Earth's atmosphere after successfully completing its mission in September 2025.\n\nProfessor of astronomy, Lorraine Hanlon, director of UCD's Centre for Space Research, led the EIRSAT-1 mission.\n\n\"All of the technology that we created really from our lab to a fully functioning space instrument has been tested,\" Prof Hanlon told RTÉ's This Week.\n\n\"Showing that that technology worked, that we were able to put it together and put a full spacecraft together in our labs tells us that we can actually use this technology not only for small satellites, but we can use it as building blocks for much larger instruments that would be even more powerful in the future.\"\n\nDuring the mission, Prof Hanlon's team in UCD detected 12 gamma-ray bursts as well as several solar flares using the EIRSAT-1.\n\nWe need your consent to load this rte-player contentWe use rte-player to manage extra content that can set cookies on your device and collect data about your activity. Please review their details and accept them to load the content.Manage Preferences\n\nUnlike many ESA member countries, Ireland's does not have its own space agency; instead, Enterprise Ireland runs the country's space programme.\n\nProf Hanon said that Ireland has not necessarily needed a standalone space agency up to now.\n\n\"But I think the case is becoming stronger for some kind of coordinating entity that would oversee education, research through to industry and innovation,\" she said.\n\nIreland's investment in ESA is relatively small compared to other countries; however, it is estimated that the country sees a return of approximately 7:1 on that investment.\n\nFor 2025, Ireland's total contribution to ESA was €26 million. There are at least 116 Irish companies that have a contract with ESA.\n\nMany Irish companies and higher education institutions now have work from membership of organisations such as ESA, ESO and CERN.\n\nProf Hanlon said joining these organisations is worth the membership fees.\n\n\"It means that your scientists are in those collaborations, are defining the experiments that will create the next level of challenge.\n\n\"So, your scientists are defining those problems that need to be addressed.\"\n\nMunster Technological University has already joined a scientific experiment with CERN.\n\nThe ESA is launching the PLATO mission to search for planets around other stars this year, which will include technology from Irish company Réaltra.\n\nAnother Irish company, InnaLabs, has its technology on board another ESA mission called HERA, which will arrive at the Didymos asteroid system in late 2026.\n\nIn UCD, another satellite mission called GIFTS: A 6U CubeSat for the detection and localisation of gamma-ray bursts is currently underway.\n\nAerial, a project with funding from both ESA and ESO, also has Irish involvement.\n\nProf Ray explained: \"What Aerial is doing is looking at a few thousand planets and their atmosphere, but from space.\n\n\"So, we're involved with the constructing of several parts of this and testing them, because they have to be tested at very low temperatures, I'm talking minus 230C because that's what it's like out in space.\"\n\nProf Ray added that Irish scientists are doing \"very innovative work in space\".\n\n\"Our students, our postdocs, people who already have a PhD, are receiving wonderful training from work not only to do with the European Space Agency, but the European Southern Observatory.\n\n\"I've had 30 PhD students and none of them are unemployed. They are immediately snapped up,\" he said.",

    "description": "The oil market was already under pressure before the latest development, with crude futures falling 20% last year.",
    "fullText": "Oil futures fluctuated between gains and losses in the first trading day since the US captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro over the weekend.\n\nUS benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures fell as much as 1.4% in the opening hour of trading before moving sideways. They were 0.5% lower at $57.01 at midnight on Monday.\n\nInternational benchmark Brent crude futures were 0.4% lower at $60.50 a barrel after falling as much as 1.4% in early trade.\n\nThe oil market has been under pressure, with crude prices falling 20% last year. A main issue facing the market is an oversupply of global crude. It's been a focus of OPEC+, which also over the weekend said it will refrain from pumping new oil during the first quarter.\n\nDespite Venezuela's vast oil reserves — estimated at about one-fifth of the global total — the country's output accounts for less than 1% of global daily oil production, reflecting years of aging infrastructure and the impact of sanctions.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, President Donald Trump said on Saturday that US oil companies will invest billions of dollars in Venezuela.\n\nIf Venezuelan oil production does pick up, analysts say it could take time and big money.\n\n\"It will take tens of billions of dollars in investment and at least a decade of Western oil majors committing to the country,\" wrote Peter McNally, the global head of sector analysts at research firm Third Bridge, on Sunday.\n\nMcNally added that there are no swift solutions for Venezuela, where years of underinvestment have eroded infrastructure across the economy, and a severe power crisis continues to disrupt daily life.\n\nAnalysts at Goldman Sachs echoed that view in a Sunday note, writing that \"higher recovery rates of heavy Venezuela oil will likely require financial and time investments in oil-processing upgraders and improvements in operational efficiencies, power availability, and oil transporting infrastructure.\"\n\nVenezuela produced around 3 million barrels a day of oil at its peak in the mid-2000s.\n\nEven before the US captured Maduro, Venezuela's oil exports had already come under pressure after Trump imposed a blockade of sanctioned oil tankers entering or leaving Venezuelan waters last month. The blockade remains in place.\n\nGoldman Sachs said the latest developments increase the likelihood of a shift toward a policy environment more supportive of oil investment, even as short-term changes to oil flows — including both modest increases and further disruptions — remain possible.\n\nThe developments are negative for oil prices over the long run, as any sustained increase in Venezuelan output would add to already ample supply at a time of slowing demand growth, according to Goldman.\n\n\"Production may edge up slightly in the short-run, including in a scenario with a US-supported government and full sanctions relief. Alternatively, disruptions to Venezuela oil deliveries could continue and/or intensify in the short-run, for instance because Maduro's cabinet has asserted its control,\" wrote Goldman's analysts.\n\nGoldman estimates WTI and Brent to average $51 a barrel and $58 a barrel, respectively, should Venezuelan crude production fall by 400,000 barrels a day by the end of 2026.\n\nShould the country's crude production rise by 400,000 barrels a day instead, WTI and Brent are expected to average $50 a barrel and $54 a barrel, respectively, in 2026, the analysts added.",

    "fullText": "Former heavyweight world champion Tyson Fury has announced he will return to boxing in 2026, bringing an end to his latest spell of retirement.\n\nThe 37-year-old Briton last fought in December 2024, when he was beaten for a second time by unified champion Oleksandr Usyk in their heavyweight rematch. Fury confirmed his retirement a month later.\n\nSpeculation over a comeback had grown in recent weeks after Fury shared footage of himself training in Thailand alongside South African boxer Kevin Lerena.\n\nPosting on Instagram on Sunday, Fury said: \"2026 is that year. Return of the Mac. Been away for a while but I'm back now. 37 years old and still punching. Nothing better to do than punch men in the face & get paid for it.\"\n\nFury's return to the ring was widely expected. His most recent retirement was met with scepticism last year, given his history of reversals.\n\nHe previously stepped away from boxing after stopping Dillian Whyte at Wembley Stadium in April 2022, only to return six months later.\n\nQueensberry promoter Frank Warren said he expected Fury to fight again. Saudi Arabia powerbroker Turki Alalshikh had reportedly planned for Fury and long-time rival Anthony Joshua to take separate bouts in the Kingdom early in 2026 before finally meeting later in the year.\n\nJoshua fuelled that possibility after defeating Jake Paul in December, saying he was ready to face Fury next.\n\nThose plans are now uncertain after Joshua was injured in a car crash in Nigeria that claimed the lives of two close friends.\n\nFury enjoyed two reigns as heavyweight champion and boasts a professional record of 34 wins, two defeats - both against Usyk - and one draw with Deontay Wilder.\n\nHe stunned long-reigning champion Wladimir Klitschko in 2015 to claim the WBA (Super), IBF, WBO and The Ring heavyweight titles in Germany.\n\nAfter more than two and a half years away from the ring, during which he addressed mental health struggles, Fury returned in 2018 and regained world champion status by defeating Wilder in 2020 to win the WBC title.\n\nFury has spoken openly about wanting to avenge his defeats by Usyk, who currently holds the WBA (Super), WBC and IBF belts.\n\nThere appears to be limited appetite among fans for a trilogy, while the Ukrainian has indicated he would prefer to defend his titles against Wilder next.\n\nOne potential route to world-title contention could be a domestic clash with Fabio Wardley, the current WBO champion and another fighter promoted by Warren's Queensberry stable.",

    "title": "How the sugar industry bought out scientists for decades",
    "description": "Researchers followed the money, and found out that the sugar industry has been gaslighting the entire world for fifty years. It was code-named \"Project 226.\"",
    "fullText": "According to a report just published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, a delegation from the Sugar Research Foundation paid off Harvard scientists to produce reports that falsely downplayed the role of sugar in coronary heart disease.\n\nYep. Sugar contributes to coronary artery disease, more than we have been led to believe.\n\nReports had linked both dietary sugar and dietary fat to heart disease as early as the mid-50s; by 1960 we knew that low-fat diets high in sugars still resulted in high cholesterol levels. So in 1964, the director of the SRF proposed that the group \"embark on a major program\" to dispute the data as well as any \"negative attitudes toward sugar.\" They found a group of Harvard nutrition scientists who would take their money, and started making plans.\n\nComplete with a codename, Project 226 was designed to protect the interests of the sugar industry by \"recapturing\" the 20% of American calorie intake they expected to lose once this whole sugar-isn't-great-for-your-heart thing percolated through into public awareness. It resulted in a two-part review published in the prestigious and influential New England Journal of Medicine, which hand-waved away huge swathes of research pointing out the risks of dietary sugar.\n\nThe authors went to absurd lengths to discount studies that didn't tell the story the Sugar Research Foundation wanted to tell. For example, to get the results they wanted, they had to throw out all the studies done on animals, because not a single animal study supported the conclusion they wanted. But after they finished their work, they reported that epidemiological studies showed a positive association between high dietary sugar consumption and better heart disease outcomes. The review concluded that there was \"no doubt\" that the only way to avoid heart disease was to reduce saturated fat.\n\nHow did this get past the sanity check at NEJM? The authors were experts, respected in their fields, and they were at least consistent cherry-pickers. They also conveniently failed to report that the Sugar Research Foundation funded their \"study.\" NEJM didn't start requiring authors to report conflicts of interest until 1984, and by then the sugar industry had floated comfortably on their 1964 precedent, funding study after study supporting their pro-sugar narrative \"as a main prop of the industry's defense.\"\n\nCan we finally talk about industry-funded studies? I'm not saying that scientists shouldn't be able to work for private research establishments. Obviously the money to buy the pipettes and reagents has to come from somewhere. But I am saying that there needs to be an unpleasantly bright spotlight on the financial resources enabling the scientific findings cited to support policymaking, whether political or medical. What industry would ever pay to support research that would put it out of business? Whether or not you're in favor of industry self-regulation, no matter whether the research is funded by taxes, commercial revenue, or charitable sources, everyone deserves policies that are made based on the whole truth -- not based on a callously selective interpretation of the facts that ends up lining someone's pockets at the expense of others' health. After how many deaths or lost person-years do the industry payoffs start being blood money?\n\nI for one, as a bench scientist, am mightily tired of hearing about scientists taking money to produce the right conclusion. This is the kind of crap Bill Nye was railing against in his comments that the industry barons who pay off scientists to fit the results to the desired conclusions maybe should be thrown in jail. It's prima facie fraud.\n\nThe peer-reviewed paper in which the scientists make this report is freely available from the JAMA(Opens in a new window), and that's how it ought to be. The only solution to corruption in science is to get more critical eyes on the whole process. There needs to be an independent body of investigative experts accountable to the public, who have to submit to a zealous and hard-hitting inquiry into their financial interests, and who can serve as a sanity check for advisory boards or legislative committees.\n\nWe need a Mythbusters for medical advice: someone who isn't a wholly owned subsidiary of the industry. Someone who can turn on the lights and force the roaches of corruption to scatter. Pay-to-win gaming isn't fair, and people hate it, and pay-to-win science is just as bad. It's about time to start paying the skeptics, because an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.\n\nBut the only way we can do the above is if the science is accessible. How much do you think a subscription to every major scientific journal would cost, even at the discounted academic rate? The EU's Horizon 2020 directive provided hosting and access that made freely available all research funded even in part by EU money -- while the authors retain the right to license, patent or commercialize their work, the peer-reviewed papers reporting their results are now free, as in libre and gratis. When they publish in Nature or wherever, they also have to publish in the European Research Council's public database.\n\nWe should do that in the US, because hosting is cheap. Then maybe we could afford to hire people like Penn and Teller, Adam and Jamie, or Phil Plait and James Randi: people with faces we know and judgment we've checked, people whose stock in trade it is to root out misunderstandings and weasel words. Policy grounded in research needs to be officially subjected to the kind of person who just can't stand it when someone is wrong on the internet. Give us some accountability and tear down this paywall.\n\nResearch: doi:10.1001/jamainternmed.2016.5394",

    "description": "China's ambitious new particle accelerator was meant to pick up where the Large Hadron Collider left off, but the project was put on pause. Here's the story.",
    "fullText": "Planned to be the largest particle accelerator in the world, China's Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC) was meant to be about 100 kilometers or 62 miles long. That's much bigger than CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC) with an approximately 27 kilometer circumference – or nearly 17 miles. These systems, especially the LHC, play a huge role in studying how the universe began during the Big Bang.\n\nDevelopment for CEPC started in 2012, around the time CERN discovered the Higgs boson particle; however, it appears the multibillion-dollar project is now paused. It was not included in the country's next five-year plan, spanning 2026 to 2030, which means it's considered a lower priority by the state — it will see less funding and resources. Wang Yifang from the Institute of High Energy Physics confirmed the change, but although the recent proposal to be included in China's five-year plan was denied, the team plans to resubmit the CEPC proposal in 2030.\n\nWhile it hasn't been directly confirmed, the CEPC would cost an estimated $5.1 billion, money that the country might want to divert elsewhere. In that case, Wang says if the European Future Circular Collider (FCC) – the next-generation collider that would effectively be LHC's successor with a much larger 90.7-kilometer (or 56-mile) circumference – is approved before the 2030 proposals, they'll likely join forces with the related teams instead.\n\nTo summarize, China's CEPC is out, likely due to cost and resource requirements, but the European's FCC still has potential, and the Chinese physicist team may join up if the proposal is approved before the next round of China's plans.\n\nDiscoveries from the systems we have operating now, like the Higgs boson discovery at LHC, occur because of how particle accelerators actually work. They fire particles into a big tunnel, or underground rings, which circle around at incredibly fast speeds before colliding. By observing these collisions, scientists get a glimpse into what the early universe looked like, as well as other foundational elements like quarks, the building blocks of visible matter in the universe. Scientists also used the system to create quark soup, a substance that hadn't been seen for billions of years before that. Generally speaking, when two particles collide, for the infinitesimally small span of time afterwards, scientists can see traces or patterns that are otherwise invisible — that's exactly how they discovered the Higgs boson.\n\nThe larger colliders, like CEPC or FCC, would not only introduce larger tunnel systems but more advanced and unique equipment, to uncover heavier or different particles, many of which the LHC simply cannot create. Imagine what kind of alchemy could be achieved with the larger, more capable collider systems.\n\nAs the current system, the LHC is expected to be phased out by the 2040s; meanwhile, the FCC, if approved, will begin development in the 2030s. That said, construction can't start quite that easily: Before anything happens, the CERN Member States and international partners have to give the upgrade project a greenlight.\n\nEnjoyed this article?",

    "fullText": "Switzerland's Camille Rast said she was racing for the victims of the New Year's Eve fire in her hometown of Crans-Montana as she ended Mikaela Shiffrin's winning start to the World Cup slalom season.\n\nRast, 26, produced a stunning second run in Sunday's slalom in Kranjska Gora to pip Shiffrin by 0.14 seconds, following up Saturday's debut World Cup giant slalom victory at the same Slovenian resort.\n\nUS star Shiffrin, 30, had won the opening five slalom events which, when added to her victory in the final slalom of last season, equalled her own record of six consecutive wins in the discipline.\n\n\"I gave it everything I had this weekend - achieving the double [slalom and giant slalom] was extraordinary,\" said Rast, who added: \"I think about all those families - we raced for them this weekend.\"\n\nA devastating fire at Le Constellation bar in the Swiss ski resort killed at least 40 people and injured 119 others.\n\nBodies continue to be identified and a criminal investigation is under way.\n\n\"We can't imagine how it is, but it's for sure terribly hard,\" Rast told BBC's Ski Sunday.\n\n\"I hope they will find the support with their family and everybody around. And I hope that the sport will bring a little smile on their face.\"\n\nRast finished a close second to Shiffrin in the previous World Cup slalom event in Austria but was not to be denied a second time, making sure the World Cup's greatest skier could not add to her record tally of 106 wins in all disciplines.\n\nShiffrin was just 0.1 seconds behind leader Rast after the first run, but set an imposing time in the second that opened a 1.69secs lead over the rest of the field.\n\nBut Rast went even faster to beat Shiffrin into second place.\n\n\"I know Shiffrin is really fast and I had to be really, really fast to beat her. I saw her start and I was like 'mmm, OK, that's good, that's really good', but I just tried to give my best, and it worked,\" she said.\n\nThere are two more World Cup slalom events - in Flachau, Austria, on 13 January, and Spindleruv Mlyn in the Czech Republic on 25 January - before the Winter Olympics begin in Milan-Cortina on 6 February.\n\nWatch Rast's victory and interview in the latest edition of Ski Sunday from 17:50 GMT on 4 January.\n\nGreat Britain had two cross-country skiers finish in the top 10 of a World Cup event for the first time in Val di Fiemme, Italy, on Sunday.\n\nBritain's Joe Davies, 24, was sixth - his best World Cup finish - while team-mate Andrew Musgrave, 35, was eighth in the men's 10km mass start free, more commonly known as the 'Final Climb'.\n\nMusgrave finished 15th and Davies 16th in the overall Tour de Ski standings - the first time the British team has had two skiers in the top 20.\n\nDavies told BBC Sport: \"To have the results we've had this Tour de Ski means so much to us all. It's not only a testament to the work we've put in, but also to the belief that British skiing belongs at the top.\"\n\nThe British cross country team for the 2026 Winter Olympics is expected to be announced on 23 January.\n\nMeanwhile, Great Britain narrowly missed out on a first World Cup podium of the season in the men's four-man bobsleigh, finishing fourth in Winterberg, Germany.",

    "fullText": "Arne Slot spoke to Sky Sports after Liverpool's draw against Fulham: \"In an away game, scoring two goals should maybe be enough to win the game. It's not for the first time this season that we fight so hard and think we have a win but concede an incredible strike. We brought Joe Gomez in but they took it short. We missed out on a good result.\n\n\"We had our chances in the first half. We had a similar one with Cody Gakpo that they scored from. In an ideal world, we see a Liverpool team that is dominant but creates more chances. We scored two goals, scored two disallowed goals and hit the bar. Again, it wasn't enough.\n\n\"The players are giving everything they have. I have to keep in mind that I have to keep them available. Alexander Isak is out and I have to overload or play Hugo more, a player who has never played in the Premier League. You have to manage that. We still have 11 very good players on the pitch.\n\n\"It's not only for us, but many teams don't create chances every game. It's not perfect but at least we've created a few more chances today than last week.\"\n\nCody Gakpo spoke to BBC Match of the Day: \"It's disappointing for us. We fought very hard in the second half, dominated at moments and tried to create chances to get through. At the end I scored in minute 95, they scored in minute 97 - a wonderful goal to be fair. Unlucky, unfortunate.\n\n\"This is a moment that can happen in a game. I was just sitting down so I did not see the moments before. I just saw him take a touch and shoot the ball into the top corner.\n\n\"I think if you are going to analyse the game maybe we should have scored more goals or defended the two goals better. In the end we should do much better. There were moments that we showed how good we were but it is up to us to stay consistent and put in overall better performances. I'm sure the wins will come again.\"\n\nOn playing in the nine: \"As a forward player you always want to score goals to help the team so it's a plus for me. In the end it's a team sport and we didn't win so I'm still disappointed.\"",

    "fullText": "Countries’ commitments to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions can have important implications for their economies. Data since the 1800s reveal that the amount of CO2 emissions generated for a given level of output follows a bell-shaped curve. Pairing this with projections of future economic growth can help in predicting future overall emissions. Comparing actual data with past projections for levels of emission intensity reveals that reductions have been slower than predicted over the past 40 years. This divergence highlights the challenges many countries may face in reaching their emissions targets.\n\nMost countries have committed to reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions over the next few decades (United Nations 2021). These commitments can have important economic implications because they may involve reconfiguring the energy sector, adopting new production technologies, and a general shift in the industrial makeup of economies, to name a few (Fried, Novan, and Peterman 2021 and Gillingham and Stock 2018).\n\nIn this Economic Letter, we use historical CO2 emissions data to evaluate the evolution in the emission intensity of production. This refers to the amount of CO2 emissions per dollar of economic output produced, which can be used as a measure of emissions efficiency. The lower the emission intensity, the more likely countries are to meet their emissions targets given current trends of output growth. In assessing trends in emission intensity, we focus on the six largest carbon-emitting countries, which collectively represent about 75% of world emissions. Three of these countries—the United States, Japan, and Germany—represent advanced economies that developed early in the 20th century with highly inefficient technologies in terms of CO2 emissions. Over time, they have brought down their emissions per dollar significantly. The other three countries—China, India, and Russia—represent emerging economies that went through their industrial transition much later in the 20th century. Because production technologies available at that time had evolved to create less pollution, these three countries now face a quicker path toward cleaner production.\n\nBased on this historical evidence, we find that the emission intensities of these two groups over time can be approximated well by bell-shaped curves. We examine different economic growth scenarios and their implications for CO2 emissions relative to reduction commitments. Our analysis suggests that future paths of economic growth and efforts to reduce emission intensity are both important factors in assessing whether these countries will meet their stated targets.\n\nFollowing the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, commonly known as Glasgow COP26, world leaders reaffirmed their commitments to reducing CO2 emissions and limiting the increase in global average temperature to 1.5° Celsius (United Nations 2021). Achieving this target is likely to require countries to significantly reshape their economies, which can involve considerable transition costs (Gillingham and Stock 2018).\n\nHow can countries reduce fossil fuel emissions? At a basic level, there are only two ways: reduce overall economic output, and thus income and consumption for their citizens, or become more efficient by using cleaner technologies to produce the same goods and services with fewer emissions.\n\nWritten simply, the level of emissions equals an economy’s emission intensity multiplied by its economic output growth. Breaking down the problem into these two components is similar to approaches that some researchers use to forecast CO2 emissions (for example, Kaya and Yokobori 1997). Our approach provides a way to easily assess a country’s progress on its road toward lower emissions.\n\nWe begin by examining world emission intensity. Figure 1 displays global CO2 emissions divided by global GDP measured in U.S. dollars, which is a common way to compare output growth across countries, over the past 200 years. The dashed line shows the fit from a bell-shaped curve. We create the curve using three parameters that correspond to the peak intensity, when the peak occurs, and how long it takes for intensity to decline from the peak. The shaded regions are 68% confidence bands, which indicate the uncertainty related to the combination of our parameter estimates and how well the curve fits the data. The figure shows that a bell-shaped curve fits the historical path of emission intensity very well, capturing the rise of world intensity up to the 1920s and the gradual improvement since then.\n\nFigure 1\nGlobal CO2 emission intensity\n\nSources: Emissions: Ritchie, Roser, and Rosado (2020), based on Global Carbon Budget data. GDP levels: Maddison Project Database, accessed through Our World in Data. GDP growth rates and 2019–2021 levels: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).\n\nTo gain a better understanding of this pattern over time, we turn to more granular data on individual countries. We focus on the world’s six highest-emitting countries, which collectively account for about 75% of global emissions as of 2021: China with 37.88% of global emissions, the United States with 16.53%, India with 8.95%, Russia with 5.80%, Japan with 3.52%, and Germany with 2.23%.\n\nWe classify these countries into two groups. The first group, including the United States, Japan, and Germany, represents large advanced economies, while the second group, China, India, and Russia, represents large emerging economies. This classification helps us broadly characterize the paths and challenges ahead for these two types of economies, rather than relying on aggregate numbers.\n\nFigure 2 shows emission intensity—defined earlier as the ratio of total emissions to total economic output—averaged for the advanced economies group (solid blue line) and the emerging economies group (solid red line). Data for Russia is only available since 1960. To avoid a large jump in the series at that date, we approximate Russian data before then using the average of data for China and India because all three countries follow similar historical paths.\n\nFigure 2\nCO2 emission intensity by country group\n\nSources: Emissions: Ritchie, Roser, and Rosado (2020), based on Global Carbon Budget data. GDP levels: Maddison Project Database, accessed through Our World in Data, and authors’ calculations. GDP growth rates and 2019–2021 levels: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).\n\nFor both groups, we find that emission intensity is currently declining, implying that all countries are emitting less carbon per dollar of output produced relative to their respective peak emission intensity. In the case of the group of advanced economies, the decline of emission intensity began in the 1920s. For the group of emerging economies, the decline started from a lower peak level and took place much later, in the 1980s, which aligned with their economic development.\n\nTo model these trends of emission intensity, we find that fitting the data to bell-shaped curves again works surprisingly well for the two groups, as shown by the dashed lines in Figure 2, as well as at the individual country level (not shown). Focusing on the sample up to 2021, the dashed lines show that the bell-shaped curves nicely describe the magnitude of the emission intensity’s peak, the timing of when the peak occurs, and how quickly emission intensity declines from the peak.\n\nThe fitted curves also allow us to extrapolate the emission intensity for each group into the future. These projections are reported in Figure 2 to the right of the vertical line marking 2021. One major assumption underlying our extrapolation is that emission intensity will continue to decline at the rate dictated by the shape of the bell curve; despite the inherent uncertainty in projecting such trends, we believe that using history as a guide is a reasonable assumption.\n\nEmission intensity is only one part of the equation. The other part is determined by the rate at which countries continue to grow in the future. Therefore, in Figure 3, we present three different scenarios of output growth for our two groups.\n\nFigure 3\nProjected real GDP by country group\n\nThe first scenario relies on OECD long-term baseline projections for GDP growth for each country in the two groups through the year 2050. For the advanced economies group, shown in blue, the OECD’s average annual growth rate is 1.5%. For the emerging economies group, in red, the OECD’s average annual growth is 6.2%. The second and third scenarios assume a quarter percentage point higher and lower annual rates of growth per year, respectively. Over 27 years, these scenarios cumulate to 7% higher and lower growth for each group, shown by the upper and lower bounds of the shaded blue and red ranges.\n\nWe now have the two pieces needed to extrapolate emissions to 2050–emission intensity and output growth. Taking these pieces together, Figure 4 reports projected emissions by country group from 2021 to 2050. The solid lines report actual emissions for advanced (blue) and emerging (red) economies. The dashed lines show emissions predicted by our bell-shaped curve of emission intensity in combination with GDP projections. The figure also includes shaded regions that reflect both the uncertainty from the projections of our estimated bell curve, using plus and minus one standard deviation around the projections, and the range of assumptions for GDP growth based on OECD projections. Finally, we include horizontal lines corresponding to the 2030 emission reduction targets set by the countries of each group in accordance with Glasgow COP26. The targets were submitted as each country’s nationally determined contribution to the goal of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5°C (United Nations 2023). We calculated the target levels for the advanced and emerging economy groups by aggregating individual country-level commitments to the group level, shown by the two horizontal lines.\n\nFigure 4\nProjected emissions by country group\n\nSources: Emissions: Ritchie, Roser, and Rosado (2020), based on Global Carbon Budget data. GDP levels: Maddison Project Database, accessed through Our World in Data. GDP growth rates and 2019–2021 levels: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Country targets: United Nations (2023).\n\nWhat are the takeaways from Figure 4? The distance between the data and the model predictions (solid and dashed lines, respectively) since the 1990s shows that emissions have been running higher than our modeling framework would have predicted. In essence, the two groups are falling behind the curve. How quickly future emissions will decline is uncertain, as the wide ranges of our predictions suggest. Our exercise cannot project the potential effects of technological changes, economic shocks, and other sources of output and emissions variation. This means that the range of possible values shown in Figure 4 is likely to be even wider. Regardless of these sources of uncertainty, a comparison between the predictions and the 2030 commitments suggests that reaching these targets may require more extensive efforts from the countries in our sample.\n\nCountries worldwide have stated their commitments to reduce CO2 emissions over the next few decades. The lessons that we draw from our exercise in this Letter serve to sketch a more general view of the challenges to advanced and emerging economies when it comes to reducing fossil fuel emissions. Reaching 2030 targets may involve significant efforts to reduce emissions and have the potential to involve substantial economic changes to production, technology, use of resources, and saving and investment decisions (Fried, Novan, and Peterman 2021). Focusing on the top six emitting countries, we find that their emission intensity has considerably improved in the past few decades, though total emissions have been higher than expected over the past 40 years. Considering a relatively wide range of economic growth prospects, we find that—even with improvements in cleaner production technologies—countries are likely to fall well short of their intended emission reduction by 2030 and beyond.\n\nZoë Arnaut\nResearch Associate, Economic Research Department, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\n\nÒscar Jordà\nSenior Policy Advisor, Economic Research Department, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\n\nFernanda Nechio\nVice President, Economic Research Department, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\n\nFried Stephie, Kevin Novan, and William B.

    "fullText": "AI safety expert David Dalrymple said rapid advances could outpace efforts to control powerful systems\n\nThe world “may not have time” to prepare for the safety risks posed by cutting-edge AI systems, according to a leading figure at the UK government’s scientific research agency.\n\nDavid Dalrymple, a programme director and AI safety expert at the Aria agency, told the Guardian people should be concerned about the growing capability of the technology.\n\n“I think we should be concerned about systems that can perform all of the functions that humans perform to get things done in the world, but better,” he said. “We will be outcompeted in all of the domains that we need to be dominant in, in order to maintain control of our civilisation, society and planet.”\n\nDalrymple said there was a gap in understanding between the public sector and AI companies about the power of looming breakthroughs in the technology.\n\n“I would advise that things are moving really fast and we may not have time to get ahead of it from a safety perspective,” he said. “And it’s not science fiction to project that within five years most economically valuable tasks will be performed by machines at a higher level of quality and lower cost than by humans.”\n\nDalrymple said governments should not assume that advanced systems are reliable. Aria is publicly funded but independent from the government and directs research funding. Dalrymple is developing systems to safeguard AI’s use in critical infrastructure such as energy networks.\n\n“We can’t assume these systems are reliable. The science to do that is just not likely to materialise in time given the economic pressure. So the next best thing that we can do, which we may be able to do in time, is to control and mitigate the downsides,” he said.\n\nDescribing the consequences of technological progress getting ahead of safety as a “destabilisation of security and economy”, Dalrymple said more technical work was needed on understanding and controlling the behaviours of advanced AI systems.\n\n“Progress can be framed as destabilising and it could actually be good, which is what a lot of people at the frontier are hoping. I am working to try to make things go better but it’s very high risk and human civilisation is on the whole sleep walking into this transition.”\n\nThis month the UK government’s AI Security Institute (AISI) said the capabilities of advanced AI models were “improving rapidly” across all domains and the performance in some areas was doubling every eight months.\n\nLeading models can now complete apprentice-level tasks 50% of the time on average, up from approximately 10% of the time last year, according to the institute. AISI also found that the most advanced systems can autonomously complete tasks that would take a human expert over an hour.\n\nThe institute also tested advanced models for self-replication, a key safety concern because it involves a system spreading copies of itself to other devices and becoming harder to control. The tests showed two cutting-edge models achieving success rates of more than 60%.\n\nHowever, AISI stressed that a worst-case scenario was unlikely in a day-to-day environment, saying any attempt at self-replication was “unlikely to succeed in real-world conditions”.\n\nDalrymple believes that AI systems will be able to automate the equivalent of a full day of research and development work by late 2026, which will “result in a further acceleration of capabilities”, because the technology will be able to self-improve on the maths and computer science elements of AI development.",

    "description": "Venezuela has the world’s largest oil reserves, but “our people don’t even have gas even to cook. That’s a disaster,” María Corina Machado told Fortune last year.",
    "fullText": "Months before the U.S. military arrested Venezuela’s Nicolás Maduro, opposition leader María Corina Machado called for what she described as the most ambitious economic transformation in the nation’s history—a sweeping privatization aimed at reversing his policies and what she calls “the disaster this socialist system has wrought.”\n\nAppearing virtually on the Fortune Global Forum stage in Riyadh, Machado, while in hiding from the Maduro regime, unveiled a bold vision to rebuild Venezuela’s shattered economy through large-scale private investment.\n\n“Venezuela will be the single biggest economic opportunity for decades to come in this region,” she told Fortune’s Diane Brady at the forum’s 2025 edition, weeks after winning the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize for her decades-long fight to restore democracy to Venezuela. “We’re talking about an opportunity, business opportunity, of more than $1.7 trillion. This is unique.” Machado has floated the $1.7 trillion figure before, an estimate produced by her economic advisory team.\n\nMachado painted a stark picture of a nation that has plummeted from prosperity to poverty: “a country that used to be the richest country in our region and the freest country in our region, and that has turned into one of the poorest.” Being under socialist rule for decades, she said, has crippled industry, devastated infrastructure, and triggered an exodus of nearly a third of Venezuela’s population. “Our economy has collapsed. It’s been over 80% down in the last [several] years,” she said. “Our people have been forced to flee just to survive.”\n\nThe International Monetary Fund estimated Venezuela’s economy had declined by roughly 75% as of late 2022, also covering its migrant crisis. The left-wing think tank Center for Economic and Policy Research argued shortly afterward that, while this figure was accurate, it discounted the severe economic sanctions imposed by the U.S. on Venezuela for many years.\n\nThe opposition leader described to Brady what she called a “narco-terrorist state” built on repression and corruption, saying that “certainly Venezuela has turned into a safe haven for criminal activities from all over the world.” She accused Maduro and his allies of financing their grip on power through gold smuggling, arms and drug trafficking, and human exploitation.\n\nAt the core of Machado’s plan is a rapid and transparent privatization process. She estimates that more than 500 enterprises were “taken by the regime, confiscated, destroyed, but the infrastructure is there.” She pledged strict oversight and rule of law from “day one,” aiming to lure investors back with stability and fiscal incentives. She pledged open markets and an approach that would be “absolutely strict” in terms of rule of law and transparency, reminding Brady that Venezuela is currently in last place in terms of rule of law. To take one example, the World Justice Project recently ranked Venezuela No. 142, out of 142 countries.",

    "fullText": "Former heavyweight world champion Tyson Fury has announced he will return to boxing in 2026, bringing an end to his latest spell of retirement.\n\nThe 37-year-old Briton last fought in December 2024, when he was beaten for a second time by unified champion Oleksandr Usyk in their heavyweight rematch. Fury confirmed his retirement a month later.\n\nSpeculation over a comeback had grown in recent weeks after Fury shared footage of himself training in Thailand alongside South African boxer Kevin Lerena.\n\nPosting on Instagram on Sunday, Fury said: \"2026 is that year. Return of the Mac. Been away for a while but I'm back now. 37 years old and still punching. Nothing better to do than punch men in the face & get paid for it.\"\n\nFury's return to the ring was widely expected. His most recent retirement was met with scepticism last year, given his history of reversals.\n\nHe previously stepped away from boxing after stopping Dillian Whyte at Wembley Stadium in April 2022, only to return six months later.\n\nQueensberry promoter Frank Warren said he expected Fury to fight again. Saudi Arabia powerbroker Turki Alalshikh had reportedly planned for Fury and long-time rival Anthony Joshua to take separate bouts in the Kingdom early in 2026 before finally meeting later in the year.\n\nJoshua fuelled that possibility after defeating Jake Paul in December, saying he was ready to face Fury next.\n\nThose plans are now uncertain after Joshua was injured in a car crash in Nigeria that claimed the lives of two close friends.\n\nFury enjoyed two reigns as heavyweight champion and boasts a professional record of 34 wins, two defeats - both against Usyk - and one draw with Deontay Wilder.\n\nHe stunned long-reigning champion Wladimir Klitschko in 2015 to claim the WBA (Super), IBF, WBO and The Ring heavyweight titles in Germany.\n\nAfter more than two and a half years away from the ring, during which he addressed mental health struggles, Fury returned in 2018 and regained world champion status by defeating Wilder in 2020 to win the WBC title.\n\nFury has spoken openly about wanting to avenge his defeats by Usyk, who currently holds the WBA (Super), WBC, IBF and WBO belts.\n\nThere appears to be limited appetite among fans for a trilogy, while the Ukrainian has indicated he would prefer to defend his titles against Wilder next.\n\nOne potential route to world-title contention could be a domestic clash with Fabio Wardley, the current WBO champion and another fighter promoted by Warren's Queensberry stable.\n\nBoxing schedule and results 2025\n\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "fullText": "TEL AVIV (AP) — Israel’s decision to revoke the licenses of more than three dozen humanitarian organizations this week has aid groups scrambling to grapple with what this means for their operations in Gaza and their ability to help tens of thousands of struggling Palestinians.\n\nThe 37 groups represent some of the most prominent of the more than 100 independent nongovernmental organizations working in Gaza, alongside United Nations agencies. Those banned include Doctors Without Borders, the Norwegian Refugee Council, Oxfam and Medical Aid for Palestinians.\n\nThe groups do everything from providing tents and water to supporting clinics and medical facilities. The overall impact, however, remains unclear.\n\nThe most immediate impact of the license revocation is that Israel will no longer allow the groups to bring supplies into the Gaza Strip or send international staffers into the territory. Israel says all suspended groups have to halt their operations by March 1.\n\nSome groups have already been barred from bringing in aid. The Norwegian Refugee Council, for example, said it has not been allowed to bring in supplies in 10 months, leaving it distributing tents and aid brought in by other groups.\n\nIsrael says the banned groups make up only a small part of aid operations in Gaza.\n\nBut aid officials say they fulfill crucial specific functions. In a joint statement Tuesday, the U.N. and leading NGOs said the organizations that are still licensed by Israel “are nowhere near the number required just to meet immediate and basic needs” in Gaza.\n\nThe ban further strains aid operations even as Gaza’s over 2 million Palestinians still face a humanitarian crisis more than 12 weeks into a ceasefire. The U.N. says that although famine has been staved off, more than a quarter of families still eat only one meal a day and food prices remain out of reach for many; more than 1 million people need better tents as winter storms lash the territory.\n\nWhy were their licenses revoked?\n\nEarlier this year, Israel introduced strict new registration requirements for aid agencies working in Gaza. Most notably, it required groups to provide the names and personal details of local and international staff and said it would ban groups for a long list of criticisms of Israel.\n\nThe registration process is overseen by Israel’s Ministry for Diaspora Affairs and Combating Antisemitism, led by a far-right member of the ruling Likud party.\n\nIsrael says the rules aim to prevent Hamas and other militants from infiltrating the groups, something it has said was happening throughout the 2-year-old war. The U.N., which leads the massive aid program in Gaza, and independent groups deny the allegations and Israeli claims of major diversion of aid supplies by Hamas.\n\nAid organizations say they did not comply, in part, because they feared that handing over staff information could endanger them. More than 500 aid workers have been killed in Gaza during the war, according to the United Nations.\n\nIsrael denies targeting aid workers. But the group say Israel has been vague about how it would use the data.\n\nThe groups also said Israel was vague about how it would use the data.\n\n“Demanding staff lists as a condition for access to territory is an outrageous overreach,” Doctors Without Borders, known by its French acronym MSF, said Friday. It said Israeli officials had refused its attempts to find alternatives.\n\nA December report on MSF issued by an Israeli government team recommended rejection of the group’s license. It pointed primarily to statements by the group criticizing Israel, including referring to its campaign in Gaza as genocide and calling its monthslong ban on food entering the territory earlier this year as “a starvation tactic.” It said the statements violated neutrality and constituted “delegitimization of Israel.”\n\nThe report also repeated claims that an MSF employee killed in by an Israeli airstrike in 2024 was an operative with the Islamic Jihad militant group. That, it said, suggested MSF “maintains connections with a terrorist group.”\n\nMSF on Friday denied the allegations, saying it would “never knowingly employ anyone involved in military activities.” It said that its statements cited by Israel simply described the destruction its teams witnessed in Gaza.\n\n“The fault lies with those committing these atrocities, not with those who speak of them,” it said.\n\nAid groups have a week from Dec. 31 to appeal the process.\n\nMedical services could see biggest impact\n\nIndependent NGOs play a major role in propping up Gaza’s health sector, devastated by two years of Israeli bombardment and restrictions on supplies.\n\nMSF said Israel’s decision would have a catastrophic impact on its work in Gaza, where it provides funding and international staff for six hospitals as well as running two field hospitals and eight primary health centers, clinics and medical points. It also runs two of Gaza’s five stabilization centers helping children with severe malnutrition.\n\nIts teams treated 100,000 trauma cases, performed surgeries on 10,000 patients and handled a third of Gaza’s births, the group says. It has 60 international staffers in the West Bank and Gaza and more than 1,200 local staff — most medical professionals.\n\nSince the ceasefire began in early October, MSF has brought in about 7% of the 2,239 tons (2,032 metric tonnes) of medical supplies that Israel has allowed into Gaza, according to a U.N. tracking dashboard. That makes it the largest provider of medical supplies after U.N. agencies and the Red Cross, according to the dashboard.\n\nMedecins du Monde, another group whose license is being halted, runs another four primary health clinics.\n\nAid groups say the most immediate impact will likely be the inability to send international staff into Gaza.\n\nForeign staff provide key technical expertise and emotional support for their Palestinian colleagues.\n\n“Having international presence in Gaza is a morale booster for our staff who are already feeling isolated,” said Shaina Low, communications adviser for the Norwegian Refugee Council, which is one of the main NGOs providing shelter supplies and fresh water to displaced people.\n\nNRC has roughly 30 international staff who rotate in and out of Gaza working alongside some 70 Palestinians.\n\nWhile any operations by the 37 groups in the West Bank will likely remain open, those with offices in east Jerusalem, which Israel considers its territory, might have to close.\n\nMany of the 37 groups already had been blocked from bringing supplies into Gaza since March, said Bushra Khalidi, Oxfam's policy lead for Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories.\n\nWhat changes with the formal license revocation is “that these practices are now formalized, giving Israel full impunity to restrict operations and shut out organizations it disagrees with,” she said.\n\nSome of the groups have turned to buying supplies within Gaza rather than bringing them in, but that is slower and more expensive, she said. Other groups dug into reserve stocks, pared down distribution and had to work with broken or heavily repaired equipment because they couldn’t bring in new ones.\n\nAmed Khan, an American humanitarian philanthropist who has been privately donating medicine and emergency nutrition for children to Gaza, said the impact extends beyond the aid groups.\n\nHe relies on NGOs to receive and distribute the supplies, but the fewer groups that Israel approves, the harder it is to find one.\n\n“It’s death by bureaucracy,” he said.",

    "title": "I won the Microsoft Excel World Championship. Here's what every office worker should know about Excel.",
    "description": "Diarmuid Early won first place in the 2025 Microsoft Excel World Championship. He has some pointers for using Excel at work.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Diarmuid Early, the 40-year-old winner of the 2025 Microsoft Excel World Championship. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI've been in the Excel business for about 20 years.\n\nI played around with it a little bit in college and started using it professionally at Boston Consulting Group. Then I spent 10 years at Deutsche Bank as a business manager. It was lots of data analysis and reporting on financials.\n\nI've been doing my own thing for about six years now, so I've pretty much used Excel my entire career.\n\nWinning the Excel World Championship felt great. I've been a long-term underperformer in the postseason. I've been first or second seed going into the knockouts every year. I've made it to the final stage in Las Vegas the last couple of years, but I think fifth was my best finish before.\n\nMy number one tip for office workers is to believe that there is a better way.\n\nWhenever you find, 'Oh god, I've been copying and pasting this for the last 10 minutes, and I still have 15 minutes to go,' whenever you find yourself doing something that is manual and repetitive, it is very likely that Excel has a better way to do it.\n\nIt is very likely that, if you ask Google or ChatGPT a brief description of what you need, 1,000 or more other people have wanted to do the same thing over the years.\n\nIn my experience, 80% of the things I've ever struggled with in Excel, if I Google it with a reasonably crisp description, there's a post out there somewhere saying how to do it.\n\nLearning to use the SUMIFS function is probably going to take you longer the first time than just doing it yourself. But it's going to be a little bit faster the second time, a lot faster the third time, and one bajillion times faster over the thousand times you have to do it over your career.\n\nIt's also much less likely to be wrong or have unexplainable errors that you will get if you're doing it manually.\n\nIt'll take you a little longer the first time, but if you're the most junior, new employee at a company, they kind of expect you to be stupid and take ages to do things. If you are stupid and take ages the first time, and the second time you do it 10 times faster, the payoff over six months, not to mention your career, is pretty huge.\n\nAs you start to learn more of those things and start to stitch them together to do more complex things, the payoff is exponential.\n\nIt's great to be able to very, very quickly zoom through and say, \"The answer is seven.\" If you get to that quickly, you get more time to say: \"Does it make any sense that the answer is seven?\"\n\nIt's the thing that the junior bankers, the junior consultants, are least likely to do. They see it as their job to turn the crank on the model, hand over the answer, and the next person above them on the chain says: What does this mean? What's the insight? Does it make sense?\n\nTaking the time to do that yourself and then communicating that gets you a lot more credibility. It also makes you a lot more likely to spot your own stupid mistakes until someone spots them for you.\n\nThe thing that I find most horrifying is when I see a formula that is 50 different numbers together in the form: A1 + B3 + C5 + D10. Someone has obviously hand-typed them all or, plus click plus click plus click.\n\nThe amount of time that takes, and the chances that you will misclick one time and have something wrong you'll never be able to find, is really high.\n\nThat's one of the more entry-level ways to go down a dark path. There's basically, at every level of Excel skill, there's the thing you're doing wrong that you don't realize you're doing wrong until you get to the next level. There are problems all the way up.\n\nWhen it gets there, I think AI will be very helpful in taking people from bad to not bad, or maybe even bad to good. It's probably not going to be much help to people like me who are already quite experienced.\n\nIf it gets to a level where it can teach me new things in Excel, then there's not much room left for human Excel users.\n\nI've got 50,000 hacks. I used to do a lot of Excel training in my BCG days. Every now and again you would teach someone something, and you'd see this look of combined joy and horror on their face. You subsequently find out: \"This is the thing that, if I knew this last night, I would not have had to work until 2 a.m..\"\n\nThat is the person who will never forget what you just taught them.",

    "fullText": "A group of about 20 US investors is already planning to travel to Venezuela in March, following Saturday's news that the country's president, Nicolás Maduro, had been taken into US custody.\n\nCharles Myers, the chairman of the political risk advisory firm Signum Global Advisors and a former vice-chairman of the investment advisory firm Evercore, told Business Insider that the mood among investors he has spoken to is one of \"cautious optimism\" following news of Maduro's ouster.\n\n\"I think the centerpiece of Venezuela's success, looking out 12 months or even 24 months, is foreign investment,\" Myers said. \"A big part of the Venezuela story, starting today, is foreign investment, especially in oil and gas, which is pretty straightforward, but there are massive opportunities in construction, in tourism.\"\n\nMyers said it's not the responsibility of his firm to take a \"moral position\" on whether it was right or wrong for the US to involve itself in Venezuela's government, but rather to help the firm's clients anticipate investment opportunities or mitigate risk due to geopolitical events.\n\nHowever, he added, his firm \"very much expected\" the situation in Venezuela would unfold as it has, and has been preparing investor groups to be ready to travel to the country when the opportunity presents itself. Signum previously hosted similar trips for asset managers and hedge funds to visit Syria and Ukraine.\n\n\"People have seen this coming, especially very smart investors, and many of them have actually bought bonds in anticipation of this,\" Myers said. \"But there's a very strong degree of cautious optimism, even more so than we saw with Syria, just because this is a United States-directed action.\"\n\n\"The United States will play a pivotal role in everything, especially the Venezuelan economy, starting today,\" Myers added, \"So, I think the reaction has been more enthusiastic than perhaps other situations like this.\"",

    "description": "Despite the promise of alleviating the main memory bottleneck, and the existence of commercial hardware implementations, techniques for Near-Data Processing have seen relatively little real-world deployment. The idea has received renewed interest with the appearance of disaggregated or \"far\" memory, for example in the use of CXL memory pools.\n  However, we argue that the lack of a clear OS-centric abstraction of Near-Data Processing is a major barrier to adoption of the technology. Inspired by the channel controllers which interface the CPU to disk drives in mainframe systems, we propose memory channel controllers as a convenient, portable, and virtualizable abstraction of Near-Data Processing for modern disaggregated memory systems.\n  In addition to providing a clean abstraction that enables OS integration while requiring no changes to CPU architecture, memory channel controllers incorporate another key innovation: they exploit the cache coherence provided by emerging interconnects to provide a much richer programming model, with more fine-grained interaction, than has been possible with existing designs.",

    "fullText": "María Corina Machado released a letter addressing the Venezuelan people after leader Nicolás Maduro and his wife were captured in a U.S. operation overnight Saturday.\n\nMachado, an opposition leader who has mostly been in hiding over the last year, said Maduro will \"face international justice for the atrocious crimes committed against Venezuelans and against citizens of many other nations.\"\n\n\"The time for freedom has come!\" Machado, who was awarded the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize, wrote in the letter posted on X.\n\nIt was not clear on Saturday if Machado, who escaped to Norway in a secret mission last month, was in Venezuela. She told CBS News in mid-December that she was \"absolutely\" supportive of President Trump's increasing military pressure on the Maduro regime and said she would welcome \"more and more pressure so that Maduro understands that he has to go.\"\n\nRead the full text of her letter, translated by CBS News, below.\n\nMaría Corina Machado's letter to Venezuelans\n\nVenezuelans, The time for freedom has come!\n\nNicolás Maduro from today will face international justice for the atrocious crimes committed against Venezuelans and against citizens of many other nations. Given his refusal to accept a negotiated solution, the United States government has fulfilled its promise to enforce the law.\n\nThe time has come for popular sovereignty and national sovereignty to prevail in our country. We are going to restore order, release the political prisoners, build an exceptional country, and bring our children back home.\n\nWe have fought for years, we have given it our all, and it has been worth it. What was meant to happen is happening.\n\nThis is the hour of the citizens. Those of us who risked everything for democracy on June 28th. Those of us who elected Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia as the legitimate President of Venezuela, who must immediately assume his constitutional mandate and be recognized as Commander-in-Chief of the National Armed Forces by all the officers and soldiers who comprise it.\n\nToday we are ready to assert our mandate and take power. Let us remain vigilant, active, and organized until the democratic transition is complete. A transition that needs ALL of us.\n\nTo the Venezuelans who are currently in our country, be ready to put into action what we will be communicating to you very soon through our official channels.\n\nTo Venezuelans abroad, we need you to be mobilized, engaging the governments and citizens of the world and committing them from now on to the great operation of building the new Venezuela.\n\nIn these crucial hours, receive all my strength, my confidence, and my affection. We remain vigilant and in contact.\n\nVENEZUELA WILL BE FREE!

    "description": "The world may no longer fully live in the grip of COVID-19, but another heavily contagious disease is currently spreading through U.S. airports.",
    "fullText": "In 2020, COVID-19 caused travel restrictions and other changes to how people get around. Avoiding getting sick while traveling is tricky, as COVID-19, flu, and common colds easily spread when dozens of people sit shoulder to shoulder inside planes, trains, or buses. However, another disease has added itself to the list. Measles is on the rise, and health officials have detected it in airports.\n\nThe New Jersey Department of Health sent a press release stating that it detected measles in a traveler who was at the Newark Liberty International Airport on December 12, 2025. The department has undertaken contact tracing efforts in case the passenger infected others. Another case appeared in a passenger who flew to and from Boston Logan International Airport (one of the busiest in the country) on December 11 and 12.\n\nThe Massachusetts Department of Public Health sent a press release of its own. The press release emphasized that measles is preventable through vaccines, making the nationwide rise in cases all the more surprising. Per the Centers for Disease Control, over 2,000 people in the U.S. tested positive for measles in 2025, numbers not seen since 1992.\n\nGavi, an organization working to increase medical vaccine access worldwide, explained that measles is the most contagious virus based on how many others just one person can infect, a measurement called R0. Like COVID-19 and the flu, measles spreads through particles in the air after someone carrying the disease coughs or sneezes. Its particles also linger in the air for up to two hours, meaning you can catch measles even without direct contact. After around two centuries of documented measles existence, researchers created a vaccine in the 1960s.\n\nVaccine skeptics have long existed around the world, but recent years have seen a higher percentage of parents choosing not to vaccinate their children. Gavi attributes this to vaccine misinformation, the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, and other global crises. Multiple health officials have publicly tried to ease people's minds by stating that vaccines are safe and effective as long as enough members of a population receive them.\n\nGetting measles despite being vaccinated is incredibly uncommon, but all travelers can take solace in the fact that cases are still fairly low nationwide. If you think you might be sick, wearing a mask can prevent you from spreading anything.\n\nReady to discover more hidden gems and expert travel tips?

    "fullText": "The novelty of eating at a diner owned by the richest person in the world seems to have worn off in just a few months\n\nLess than six months since it opened, Elon Musk’s Tesla Diner has the feel of a ghost town. Gone is the Optimus robot serving popcorn, gone are the carnivore-diet-inspired “Epic Bacon” strips, gone are the hours-long, hundred-person lines wrapped around the block. Even the restaurant’s all-star chef, Eric Greenspan, is gone. The Hollywood burger-and-fries shop seems like a shell of the bustling eatery it was when it opened in late July.\n\nOn a balmy Friday afternoon in December, the parking lot for Tesla car charging was, at best, half full. Inside what the company describes as a “retro-futuristic” diner, a handful of people trickled in, ordering burgers and hotdogs or asking for merch. The upstairs deck, AKA “Skypad”, was vacant except for a pair of employees stringing holiday lights. More staff was busy at work, buffing fingerprints off the chrome walls and taking out the trash, than there were customers. The diner was spotless.\n\nThe novelty of eating at a restaurant owned by the richest person in the world seems to have worn off. When the Tesla diner opened in summer, it brought in droves of the CEO’s fans and curious onlookers. But then came the onsite anti-Musk protests, noise complaints from neighbors and customers who said menu items often sold out or, when they were available, were served soggy and cold.\n\nGreenspan, a graduate of Le Cordon Bleu who helped launch the Mr Beast Burger chain, told the Los Angeles Times last month that he was leaving the Tesla Diner to focus on opening a Jewish deli called Mish. According to Eater, the chef removed his previous Instagram posts referencing the Tesla Diner as a newly minted ex-boyfriend might.\n\nGreenspan has not publicly said why he left and did not return a request for comment. Tesla also did not return a request for comment.\n\nGreenspan and other California restaurateurs who praised the Tesla Diner faced pushback for supporting Musk. The Tesla CEO is seen as a polarizing figure who donated nearly $300m to get Donald Trump elected and then led the so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) in its rapid and haphazard teardown of federal agencies. During a speech at Trump’s inauguration, Musk made what rights groups have described as back-to-back Nazi salutes – something repeatedly portrayed in the picket signs held by Tesla Diner protesters.\n\nMusk has been talking about the concept of a 50s-style Tesla diner in LA since at least 2018 as part of an idea to have amenities for waiting drivers connected to Supercharger stations. He touted the plans for it in 2023 as “Grease meets The Jetsons with Supercharging” and claimed the diner would launch later that year. When it finally did open in the summer of 2025, he called it “one of the coolest spots in LA” and vowed that if the concept went well Tesla would open diners in major cities around the world. So far, there is only one.\n\n“This is a pretty special diner. If you are in the LA area, it’s worth visiting,” Musk said on Tesla’s second-quarter earnings call, just two days after the diner opened. “It’s a shining beacon of hope in an otherwise bleak urban landscape.”\n\nThe diner received immense media coverage upon opening but poor reviews from restaurant critics, who described the food as forgettable and the concept as little more than a corporate branding exercise. Its menu consisted of fast-food staples like a $13.50 smash burger, AKA “Tesla Giga Burger”, and an $8 milkshake, along with more internet-coded foods like the $12 maple-glazed “Epic Bacon” strips and a small-sized $8 “Wagyu Beef Chili Cup”.\n\nA display case with Tesla merchandise featured a “levitating Cybertruck” figurine for $175 and a black hoodie emblazoned with a graphic of the diner for $95.\n\nTesla posted on X in October that it had sold 50,000 burgers since its opening – an average of a little over 700 a day. Musk proclaimed that month that the diner was a success and suggested that he would open others near Tesla offices in Palo Alto and Austin. Tesla has yet to announce any formal plans for expansion.\n\nOn social media, the wave of food influencers making TikTok and Instagram videos about the diner slowed in the months after its opening. Reviewers commenting on the $13 hotdog or posing next to the giant drive-in screens playing Star Trek are now relatively rare. Musk, who usually posts dozens of times a day on X, has only made scant mentions of the diner on the platform and didn’t address it on Tesla’s third quarter earnings call in October.\n\nThe diner also appears to have pivoted to hosting some events, including a “Holiday Bash on The Skypad” in mid-December featuring unlimited Tesla food and beverages, plus a live DJ, for $75 a ticket.\n\nAs the diner narrows its ambitions, some of the customer complaints have likewise waned. The pared down menu is fully stocked, and food came out hot and fast on the balmy Friday in December. One enthusiastic Yelp reviewer said she recently visited the diner on a Saturday night. She posted a photo of her meal, saying “the burger was solid and the fries were perfectly crispy”.\n\n“Best part was that it wasn’t crowded at all,” she added.",

They were also built at a fraction of the cost and computing power that major US tech companies invest to build LLMs. The result: a massive sell-off on January 27 wiped out nearly US$1 trillion in tech stocks, including US$600 billion from Nvidia alone.\n\nAnalysts expected the momentum of Chinese AI companies to continue this year, thanks to Beijing's policy support, improved funding prospects, greater adoption of AI systems across industries and a growing number of talent being recruited for innovative projects.\n\nA domestic AI start-up's co-founder, who declined to be identified, predicted that China would overtake the US to become \"the world's leading AI power in 2027\". China's advantage was its deep talent pool, according to the co-founder.\n\nIn his New Year's address, Chinese President Xi Jinping pointed out that the domestic market has \"many large AI models competing in a race to the top\", while new breakthroughs were being achieved in domestic semiconductor development. All of that \"has turned China into one of the economies with the fastest growing innovation capabilities\", Xi said.\n\nDeepSeek founder and CEO Liang Wenfeng.

    "fullText": "When booking your next flight in the US, Delta Air Lines might be your best bet for a timely arrival.\n\nIn 2025, it was the most on-time airline in the US and the 10th most punctual in the world, according to a newly released annual report from aviation analytics company Cirium.\n\nTop carriers often benefit from large, well-organized hubs, simpler networks, or hubs concentrated in regions with fewer weather-related disruptions. The rankings are based on on-time arrivals — defined as flights arriving within 15 minutes of their scheduled arrival time — and also reflect cancellations.\n\nIn 2025, Delta achieved an on-time performance rate of 80.9%, down about 2.5% from 2024. Still, roughly 8 in 10 flights arrived on schedule — and the carrier handled just over 1.8 million flights, compared to about 200,000 each by Aeromexico and Saudia, per Cirium.\n\nAccording to the aviation data company OAG, 80% or better is considered \"pretty good,\" while only the very best carriers hit 90% or higher.\n\nDelta remains among the world's most punctual airlines, though it slipped from No. 3 globally in 2024 to No. 10 globally in 2025. It did not receive Cirium's \"Platinum Award for Operational Excellence\" in 2025, despite earning it annually from 2021 to 2024.\n\nQatar Airways — boasting an over 200-strong aircraft fleet out of its sprawling Doha hub — won Cirium's top award, which goes to an airline that excels in punctuality, network efficiency, operational scale, and recovery from disruptions.\n\n\"The airline product is the schedule,\" Cirium's chief marketing officer Mike Malik said during a press conference. \"I keep emphasizing that. And when an airline understands that the schedule is what they're selling, they focus on that; they just become a better operation.\"\n\nAlaska Airlines came in second in the US with a 79.2% on-time rate. It knocked United Airlines, which faced significant air traffic control issues at its Newark, New Jersey, hub over the summer, down to fourth from its No.-2 spot in 2024. The airlines operated about 453,000 and 1.7 million flights last year, respectively.\n\nUS carriers overall experienced heightened operational pressure last year due to sustained air traffic controller shortages and a 43-day government shutdown, the longest in US history.\n\nOne airline, however, unexpectedly made the podium: budget competitor Spirit Airlines. In a turbulent year that included re-entering bankruptcy, Spirit jumped three spots to third place in the US with an on-time rate of 78.8% in 2025.\n\nThe improvement followed the airline's exit from several airports and the sale of dozens of planes to simplify its network and bolster cash flow.\n\n\"There has been a focus at Spirit Airlines to get their operation together for the past 14 months or so,\" Malik said. \"We've seen increases and them posting good numbers, but some of it has to, obviously, do with the fact that they are a much smaller operation and much more tightly controlled.\"\n\nHere is the list of the top 8 most on-time US airlines for 2025:\n\nAmong global carriers, the cream of the crop for 2025 was Aeromexico, with a 90.0% on-time arrival rate. Saudia took second place at 86.5%, and Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) came in third at 86.1%. This marks the second consecutive year that Aeromexico and Saudia have earned gold and silver.\n\nThree regional carriers — regional in the geographic sense, not regional jets or feeder airlines — performed even better than Aeromexico: South Africa's Safair at 91.1%, Royal Jordanian at 90.7%, and Panama's Copa Airlines at 90.8%.\n\nDespite beating Aeromexico, these carriers do not qualify for the top three spots because Cirium does not classify them as \"global\" airlines due to their fewer flights and less complex international networks. Cirium shows Safair, Royal Jordanian, and Copa flew about 63,000, 37,000, and 134,000 flights last year, respectively.\n\nElsewhere in the world, Cirium listed low-cost carrier Iberia Express, owned by the Spanish flag carrier Iberia, as the most reliable airline in Europe for 2025, with an on-time rate of 88.9%. Philippine Airlines won in the Asia Pacific region at 83.1%.\n\nVirgin Atlantic was named the \"most improved,\" jumping 9.44 percentage points from 74.0% in 2024 to 83.5% in 2025.\n\nHere is the list of the top 10 most on-time global airlines for 2025:\n\nThe world's most punctual airlines have networks anchored around large, highly optimized hubs — like Copa in Panama City, Aeromexico in Mexico City, or Royal Jordanian in Amman — or deliberately spread across a small number of coordinated airports.\n\nSAS, for example, balances traffic across Stockholm, Oslo, and Copenhagen, limiting bottlenecks. Safair, with the smallest operation among the top three regionals, primarily flies domestically, simplifying its network.\n\nThese airlines also benefit from generally less-constrained air traffic control systems compared to those in the US, as well as from locations that largely avoid cascading weather disruptions.\n\nSAS' primary airports, meanwhile, are purpose-built for winter operations.\n\nUS carriers American, Delta, and United, by comparison, each operate at least eight major hubs across widely different climates — from wildfires in California and hurricanes in Florida to winter storms in the Northeast and the heat in Texas — making disruption recovery far more complex.",

    "description": "What is the current status of democracy in the world?",
    "fullText": "What is the current status of democracy in the world?\n\nIn its 2025 report, V-Dem, a Swedish independent research organization, concluded there were more dictatorial states (91) than democracies (88) for the first time since 2002.\n\nThe report warned that those numbers underscore the serious decline of democracy around the world.\n\nAfter an apparent victory over communism with the end of the Cold War, democracy now faces a major challenge.\n\nThe benefits of globalization did not reach all citizens, leading to a maldistribution of wealth.\n\nThe dissatisfaction and hatred toward existing political parties and society of those who feel left behind have been amplified through social media, widening the division.\n\nOn the other hand, authoritarian governments monitor their citizens to shut off opposing opinions. Under tight state control, decisions are quickly made, giving the impression of “efficiency.”\n\nMany people likely hold doubts as to whether democracy is something that should be protected.\n\nThe values of this government system can be found in “Democracy,” a textbook for junior and senior high schools that was published by the old education ministry soon after the end of World War II.\n\nAt that time, expectations for a fresh start in Japan were heightened as the people were liberated from oppression and a lack of freedom.\n\nSTRENGTHS OF DEMOCRATIC NATIONS\n\nIn a democracy, where citizens are respected as individuals, a major strength is the freedom and equality that lie in its roots.\n\nWhile time may be required to thoroughly discuss all decisions on policy matters, democracy does have the ability to correct mistakes.\n\nFor example, elections can oust corrupt politicians.\n\nAnd policy toward the Vietnam War by the United States, which had covered up the facts, changed course through the outcry of its citizens.\n\nIn dictatorships, those in power shut down those who criticize government mistakes, making corrections impossible to achieve.\n\nThe website for the American Center managed by the U.S. State Department and U.S. Embassy once had a section that defined democracy as a system placing the government under the control of laws and allowing all citizens equal protection under the law.\n\nThe section also explained that majority rule was respected in a democracy, but that the fundamental rights of individuals and minority groups would be earnestly protected.\n\nBut in 2025, the pages containing such definitions were deleted. It is not clear if the deletions were related to the second inauguration of U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nAlthough the United States led the way after World War II in creating an international order based on the rule of law, the Trump administration’s National Security Strategy released in November declared, “The days of the United States propping up the entire world order like Atlas are over.”\n\nTrump is also moving to destroy the separation of powers, brazenly interfering in the judicial branch by firing prosecutors who previously investigated allegations against him.\n\nIn our New Year editorial for 2023, we expressed concerns about the decline of democracy, but we also displayed expectations for its recovery.\n\nThe situation, however, has worsened since then.\n\nAfter the Trump administration ended overseas support activities through the U.S. Agency for International Development, assistance toward democratic movements in Southeast Asia has stalled to the advantage of China and Russia.\n\nIn European nations, such as Germany and France, ultraright, anti-immigrant parties have increased their popularity.\n\nIn its 2022 report, the U.S. nongovernmental organization Freedom House listed four indices for determining if democratic nations were moving toward authoritarianism.\n\nThe first was “undermining the rule of law” by politicians and governments through the weakening of judicial independence.\n\nThe second was “perverting elections” to undercut public faith in democratic balloting through opaque financing and manipulation of electoral rules.\n\nThe third was “attacking media freedom” by targeting journalists and blocking access to information.\n\nThe fourth was “discrimination and mistreatment of migrants” and marginalized communities.\n\nThe “Democracy” textbook published after World War II also pointed to the fragility of democracy, warning that even in a democratized Japan, dictatorship could rear its ugly head at any time and from anywhere.\n\nThe textbook stressed the need for citizens to have a critical state of mind and awareness of that weakness of democracy.\n\nANTI-DEMOCRATIC TRENDS IN JAPAN\n\nDemocracy is also wavering in Japan.\n\nIf we use the four indices, rule of law is threatened by the proposal of Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s administration to create an anti-spying law, which could narrow the rights of citizens.\n\nA law enacted in 2014 to protect specially designated secrets has already affected reporting activities. The anti-spying legislation could further strengthen restrictions on free speech under the excuse of protecting Japan from foreign nations.\n\nThe Liberal Democratic Party is reluctant to further investigate money scandals by its lawmakers, while a proposal to revise the electoral system would be advantageous to the ruling coalition and could arbitrarily eliminate small parties.\n\nA government panel has also started work on restricting entry into Japan by foreigners, a policy that could further spread xenophobia around Japan.\n\nPopulism that gains support through xenophobia and chest-pumping arguments is also spreading into Japan. This reflects the distortions in politics and society that fuel dissatisfaction among the public with their daily lives.\n\nCan those distortions be corrected? Or will populist politicians use them to further agitate fear?\n\nIf nothing is done and division deepens, “other people” could be viewed as a hated enemy, and an authoritarian atmosphere would strengthen under such circumstances.\n\nDemocracy, however, has shown the ability to recover from past difficulties.\n\nAlthough viewpoints and perspectives may differ in a democracy, respect has been shown for the other party, and common ground is sought through dialogue in search of compromise.\n\nPoliticians and citizens should once again recognize this principle and strength and avoid falling into the trap of division.",

    "description": "A new country is gearing up to unveil the world's second-fastest commercial transport train, and despite their reputation with technology, it isn't Japan.",
    "fullText": "There are plenty of mistakes people make while traveling by train. Pick the cheapest ride, and you'll probably be stuck on a train moving slower than drying paint. Pick the wrong type of train, and you could be spending money faster than the blink of an eye. Knowing how to choose the right type of long-distance train is crucial, and when it comes to train systems, Asia's dominance in the sector far exceeds any other continent worldwide. China currently has the top spot for the most bullet trains, as well as the fastest, and this country will soon offer the world's second-fastest train, and no, it's not Japan.\n\nSouth Korea's government and the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport just revealed on December 22 that the world's second-fastest bullet train is scheduled to join its fleet in 2030 for test operations, and expect it to be fully commercialized for the public by 2031. Capable of speeds reaching a staggering 230 miles-per-hour (370 kilometers-per-hour), the new EMU-370 train is a next generation high-speed train that's going to put South Korea on the map when it comes to bullet trains that promise lightning-fast trips.\n\nKorea Railroad Research Institute (KRRI), along with seven public and private organizations, led a national research and development program spanning the length of three years from April 2022 to December 2025, to design the highly anticipated EMU-370 train project that cost a total of 15.23 million dollars (22.5 billion Korean won). The EMU-370 was designed to have a fully functional top speed of up to 253 miles-per-hour (407 kilometers-per-hour), making the trip from Seoul to Busan in just under two hours, when typically it would take two-and-a-half hours.\n\nOne of the best places to take a day trip if you're staying in Seoul, is the coastal town of Busan, which will now be more accessible than ever. Currently, the EMU-320 (KTX-Cheongyong) is South Korea's fastest train, however the EMU-370's impressive stats speak for themselves. Set to seat 479 passengers with a two decibel reduced indoor noise level, and a motor capacity of 560 kilowatts, the EMU-370 puts out 47.4% more power to the equivalent of about 75 midsize family sedans with a sleek aerodynamic design, making it the sportscar of the train world.\n\nCurrently, China's CR450 high-speed train is in testing, with speeds reaching approximately 249 miles-per-hour (400 kilometers-per-hour), and is the world's leading passenger bullet train, which is set to launch in 2027 for commercialized public use. Other countries that have bullet trains, such as France, Germany, and Japan, who were the first to have a bullet train in 1964 called the Shinkansen, reach a top speed of approximately 200 miles-per-hour (320 kilometers-per-hour).\n\nWith technological advances in rail speeds, tracks must also naturally be upgraded. According to the head of the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport's Railway Bureau, there must be significant improvements before the EMU-370 can reach full speed. Without halting operations of the railway, replacing ballast tracks with concrete tracks on some sections will be done during a four-hour period in which trains do not run. The ministry official stated they expect South Korea's high-speed rail to exceed 217 miles-per-hour (350 kilometers-per-hour) in the near future, which would secure South Korea's spot as a top player within the high-speed railway sector for years to come.\n\nReady to discover more hidden gems and expert travel tips?

Investigators said Kennedy refused, pulled a knife from his jacket, and ignored repeated commands to drop it.\n\nAn officer used a Taser to stun the armed man but he kept moving towards another officer. A 43-year-old officer fired his gun. Four shots were fired. Officers provided aid, but Kennedy was pronounced dead at the scene. A knife was later recovered.\n\nAuthorities said Kennedy was homeless. No officers were injured. The fatal shooting remains under investigation by county detectives, with findings to be reviewed by the St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney’s Office once the case is complete.\n\nSt. Louis Lambert Airport released this statement:\n\n“The entire airport community is saddened by the events of November 21st.

    "description": "Many of MTV's last 24-hour music channels around the world are set to stop broadcasting after today, Dec. 31, 2025.",
    "fullText": "MTV will shut down many of its last dedicated 24-hour music channels after today, Dec. 31.\n\nThe move, announced back in October, will affect channels around the world, with the U.K. seeing five different MTV stations going dark. These include MTV Music, MTV 80s, MTV 90s, Club MTV, and MTV Live. As Consequence notes, MTV Music — which launched in 2011 — notably ended its run by airing the Buggles’ “Video Killed the Radio Star,” the first visual to air when MTV launched in the United States in 1981.\n\nMTV’s parent company, Paramount Skydance, is also expected to shutter music-only channels in Australia, Poland, France, and Brazil. Reps for MTV in the U.S. did not immediately return a request for comment regarding the full slate of channels that are set to go dark.\n\nDespite axing much of its dedicated music programming, MTV’s flagship channels are still expected to keep broadcasting in the U.K. and elsewhere. Like in the U.S., these channels primarily air massively popular reality programs, as opposed to music videos.\n\nThe changes at MTV come as Paramount Skydance aims to cut costs following its blockbuster (and controversial) merger earlier this year. But CEO David Ellison is reportedly still keen on revitalizing MTV and other cable channels, though it’s still unclear exactly what that will entail.\n\nIn September, The Wall Street Journal reported that Ellison had fielded ideas for MTV from major players in the music industry like Irving Azoff, Lucian Grainge, and some big-name artists. There have also reportedly been discussions about turning MTV into an online streaming service that could potentially rival Spotify or YouTube.\n\nThe decision to cut MTV’s musical-only channels wasn’t the only cost-cutting measure the Paramount took this year. Back in February, when the Skydance merger was still in the works, MTV announced that it would shutter several awards shows, including the MTV Europe Music Awards and MTV Latin America’s MIAW Awards (formerly known as the Millennial Awards).",

    "description": "The 48th edition of the world's biggest cross-country rally is nearly upon us. Here’s a look at the main contenders for victory in Dakar",
    "fullText": "The 2026 Dakar Rally is shaping up to deliver one of the most closely fought battles in recent years. Ford and Dacia arrive in Saudi Arabia determined to apply the lessons they learned on their debut last year with the aim of ending Toyota’s dominance in the world’s most prestigious rally-raid. Toyota isn’t standing still either, and has introduced an all-new car to maintain its position at the front.\n\nThe rally itself features several changes, with both the route and the format having been altered by organiser ASO to add a fresh challenge.\n\nFollowing the ceremonial start and Prologue on 3 January, competitors will tackle nearly 8,000km across two weeks, crossing some of the most unforgiving terrain in the Middle East.\n\nHere’s a list of drivers considered to be the favourites for top honours in the Ultimate category:\n\nOne of the prime contenders for the 2026 Dakar Rally is reigning champion Yazeed Al-Rajhi. The Saudi billionaire had always been rapid in cross-country rallying, with Dakar’s move to his home country in 2020 cementing his position as a frontrunner. But last year he made the biggest strides, combining his raw pace with improved maturity to secure a maiden win against factory competition. Back at the wheel of a Toyota and supported by the highly experienced Overdrive customer team, he has all the ingredients required to defend his crown.\n\nThat said, the 44-year-old’s build-up to this year’s event has been far from ideal. A heavy crash at Baja Aragon in April left him with fractured vertebrae, forcing a lengthy spell on the sidelines. He returned to competition in Portugal with a subdued 22nd-place finish before his preparations suffered another setback when he retired from Rally Morocco.\n\nToyota’s charge in Dakar will be spearheaded by Henk Lategan. At 31 years of age, he is one of the younger drivers in the field, but with four Dakar appearances already under his belt, he appears ready to finally seal the crown. The South African proved in 2025 that he is capable of fighting for the overall victory, as he went toe-to-toe with the more experienced Al-Rajhi and claimed two individual stage wins along the way. Missing out on the top spot by just under four minutes will have only sharpened his determination to go one better this time around.\n\nToyota has a new weapon in Dakar this year in the form of the GR DKR Hilux, which features a lighter tubular chassis and reinforced transmission. The Japanese manufacturer has won Dakar three times in the last four years, and the updated model based on the Hilux pick-up will help stave off competition from newer rivals.\n\nIf there is one driver the Dakar field can never afford to underestimate, it is Nasser Al-Attiyah. The Qatari has been a relentless winning force over the past decade and arrives in 2026 determined to reclaim the crown after two comparatively difficult campaigns in 2024 and 2025. While Stephane Peterhansel’s record of eight outright victories in cars remains some distance away, Al-Attiyah could enhance his legacy by winning the rally with a fourth different manufacturer after his previous triumphs with Volkswagen, Mini and Toyota. Further, he is just one stage win away from leapfrogging both Peterhansel and Ari Vatanen to become the most successful Dakar driver in that metric.\n\nAl-Attiyah will also be able to benefit from an improved Dacia Sandrider, which won in both Abu Dhabi and Morocco last year after a rather underwhelming debut in Dakar at the start of the 2025 season.\n\nCarlos Sainz Sr. shows no signs of slowing as he prepares for his 19th Dakar Rally start at the age of 63. Sainz became the oldest driver to win the world’s most prestigious cross-country rally when he won the 2024 edition at the wheel of the Audi RS Q e-tron. His 2025 outing was cut short by a crash on Stage 2, but he is back this year to gun for a fifth overall victory.\n\nWinning Dakar with Ford would bring his career a full circle, having made his WRC debut back in 1987 at the wheel of a Cosworth-powered Sierra. Sainz also never managed to win a WRC title with the American marque (his 1990 and ‘92 championships were won with Toyota), so a Dakar triumph with Raptor would be one of the most satisfying achievements of his illustrious career.\n\nRally legend Sebastien Loeb arrives at Dakar with renewed momentum after closing out the 2025 World Rally-Raid Championship with three consecutive podiums, including a victory in the season-ending Morocco Rally. That should give him some encouragement after his most recent Dakar outing ended early due to car damage. Loeb will also have a new co-driver in the form of Al-Attiyah’s former navigator Edouard Boulanger. After a run of misfortune earlier in 2025, Loeb felt a reset was required, leading to a split with Fabian Lurquin, who has moved across to partner Al-Attiyah in a direct swap between the pair.\n\nIt remains to be seen if Dacia can build on its recent success and take on Toyota on the biggest stage, but a maiden Dakar victory for Loeb would be huge for his career, especially after Sebastien Ogier drew level with him on nine World Rally Championship titles in 2025.\n\nMattias Ekstrom’s recent Dakar form has been so convincing that he is now viewed less as a two-time DTM champion and more as a genuine rally-raid specialist. The Swede has shown a remarkable ability to adapt to new disciplines, a trait underlined in 2022 when he beat his more experienced Audi team-mates to finish ninth overall on debut.\n\nThat adaptability was again on display in 2025 when, after ending a decades-long association with Audi, he guided the factory Ford team to the podium, finishing behind only the dominant Toyotas of Al-Rajhi and Lategan.\n\nHow Ekstrom builds on that impressive performance will be one of the key storylines in 2026, particularly if Ford can produce a package capable of taking the Hilux head-on in Saudi Arabia.\n\nBeyond the established leading sextet, several other drivers on the entry list are capable of springing a surprise in 2026. Toyota driver Seth Quintero, for instance, will be a much more potent force in his third outing in the Ultimate category. Also stepping into a bigger role is two-time bike champion Toby Price, whose impressive Dakar debut in the car category with Overdrive last year earned him a promotion to Toyota’s factory line-up.\n\nAnother driver to watch out for is Lucas Moraes, who won the 2025 W2RC title with Toyota and has since joined an expanded four-car Dacia operation alongside Al-Attiyah, Loeb and Cristina Gutierrez.\n\nFord’s young gun Mitch Guthrie complemented Ekstrom well in 2025 and looks well placed to challenge for individual stage wins this year. His team-mate Nani Roma, a Dakar winner on both two and four wheels, should also never be discounted.\n\nOutside of Toyota, Ford and Dacia, two smaller manufacturers could regularly mix in the top 10 this year: Century and Mini. At Century, Matthieu Serradori and Brian Baragwanath have a history of punching above their team’s weight, while Mini also fields proven talents like Guillaume de Mevius and Lionel Baud.\n\nFinally, ‘Mr Dakar’ Peterhansel will also line up at the start in Yanbu on 3 January after missing the event in 2025, competing for Land Rover’s Defender brand in the Stock class.\n\nDakar 2026: Full route, schedule and marathon stage details\n\nRed Bull co-owner Mark Mateschitz to enter Dakar Rally under an alias\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

    "fullText": "According to a report from AS, Real Madrid scouts will closely monitor Kees Smit over the next six months before the 2026 FIFA World Cup.\n\nIt is known that the AZ Alkmaar youngster is being followed as part of Madrid’s wider plan to identify a midfield orchestrator capable of leading the team into the next cycle.\n\nAs mentioned many times in the past, Real Madrid are preparing to reinforce their midfield in the summer of 2026.\n\nWith that objective in mind, Smit has emerged as a profile that fits many of the club’s requirements.\n\nOver recent weeks, his name has gathered serious traction among scouts, not just in Spain but across Europe.\n\nCompetition for Smit’s signature is expected to be fierce.\n\nSeveral top clubs are aware of his rapid development, but Real Madrid believe their sporting project and global pull could be decisive if they choose to make a concrete move.\n\nThe club see him as a player who is young enough to grow, yet already mature enough to handle responsibility at the highest level.\n\nReal Madrid will keep an eye on Kees Smit. (Photo by Richard Pelham/Getty Images)\n\nAt just 19 years old, Smit has already taken important steps forward in his career. He has made his debut for the Dutch national team under Ronald Koeman, who is counting on him as part of his plans heading into the World Cup.\n\nKoeman’s faith has been telling, and comparisons to Pedri only underline the type of midfielder Smit is becoming.\n\nMeanwhile, Real Madrid’s interest is not new. Club scouts were first drawn to Smit during a Youth League match in the 2022–23 season, when AZ Alkmaar convincingly defeated Real Madrid 4-0.\n\nThat performance sparked sustained monitoring of his progress, and since then, his development has only reinforced the initial impressions.\n\nFrom now until the end of the season, the evaluation process will intensify. Madrid intend to observe him continuously, analysing not only his performances but also his consistency, personality, and response to pressure.\n\nHowever, under contract until 2028, AZ Alkmaar currently value him at around €60 million.\n\nIt is already a hefty figure for a player who turns 20 on January 21, but one that could climb even higher with strong international exposure.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe consensus was clear before kickoff. The ESPN College GameDay crew overwhelmingly sided with Georgia to handle business against Ole Miss in the Sugar Bowl. The Bulldogs’ postseason experience, defensive strength and a regular season win in Athens weighed on many minds.\n\nThat confidence did not survive Thursday night in New Orleans.\n\nOle Miss stunned third-ranked Georgia 39-34 in a chaotic College Football Playoff quarterfinal that featured 30 combined fourth quarter points, multiple lead changes and one of the most unusual endings in bowl history. A safety on the final kickoff was the result of a desperate Georgia lateral that struck the pylon and sealed the Rebels’ victory. It sent them to the Fiesta Bowl for a semifinal matchup against Miami.\n\nNo love for Ole Miss #SugarBowl#CFBPlayoffpic.twitter.com/eJcNIRwSIF\n\n— Jeff Hauser (@radiohauser) January 2, 2026\n\nThe Rebels, now 13-1 and the CFP’s No. 6 seed, looked nothing like the underdog most of the pregame panel envisioned. Quarterback Trinidad Chambliss carved up the Bulldogs for 362 yards and two touchdowns, repeatedly answering Georgia rallies with poise and precision. His 40-yard strike to De’Zhaun Stribling on third down late in the fourth quarter set up Lucas Carneiro’s decisive 47-yard field goal with six seconds remaining.\n\nCarneiro was flawless all night, drilling three field goals, including Sugar Bowl-record kicks of 55 and 56 yards as Ole Miss totaled 473 yards of offense. Georgia finished with 355 yards but couldn’t come up with the final stop when it mattered.\n\nGeorgia had erased a 10-point deficit in the final minutes, tying the game on Peyton Woodring’s field goal with 55 seconds left. That rally only heightened the drama before Ole Miss delivered the final blow.\n\nIt was the kind of result that shows why the games are played on the field.
