    "description": "Apply to our rolling effort to find, scope, and build the most important projects to prepare the world for advanced AI",
    "fullText": "In 2025, IFP published The Launch Sequence, a set of proposals aimed at answering one question: what does America need to build, which will not be built fast enough by default, to prepare for a future with advanced AI?\n\nAs we explained in the foreword to the collection, Preparing for Launch, we need to solve two broad problems:\n\nWe invited some of the sharpest thinkers, engineers, and scientists thinking about these topics to write 16 concrete proposals to address these problems.\n\nSince then, many of the proposals have gained real-world traction:5\n\nMajor new funding is flowing into this space. The OpenAI Foundation committed $25 billion to AI resilience and curing diseases. The Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative is refocusing most of its philanthropic spending on AI projects to “cure all disease.” The White House launched the Genesis Mission, a “national effort to unleash a new age of AI‑accelerated innovation and discovery.” Philanthropies and government officials are asking us for more ideas about where this money should be directed.\n\nThis is a momentous opportunity, and how well these funds are spent will depend both on the quality of available ideas and on teams being ready to implement them.\n\nThat’s why The Launch Sequence is transitioning into a rolling effort to:\n\nThe output of The Launch Sequence will be a collection of thoroughly vetted, detailed project plans for philanthropists to fund or for policymakers to implement.7\n\nWe’re excited to announce our official Advisory Panel for the project, including:\n\nWe are seeking initial short pitches (around 200–400 words) that address one of the three focus areas of this RFP: accelerating science, strengthening security, and adapting institutions. See “Ideas we are interested in” at the bottom of this post for full descriptions of these focus areas.\n\nWe are interested in projects that are particularly important to achieve in light of rapid advances in AI. This means that the capabilities of advanced AI — or the changes such capabilities will bring — should be a key part of either the problem or the solution.8 If you are unsure if a proposal is in-scope, we encourage you to submit it anyway.\n\nA non-exhaustive list of the kinds of project ideas we’re excited about can be found at the bottom of this post. You can also see the project ideas we’ve already published on our website: ifp.org/launch.\n\nWe welcome pitches from two broad groups of contributors:\n\nWe are especially interested in pitches from people who would consider implementing their proposal themselves.10 This is not a requirement; we are also interested in hearing from strategists, researchers, and domain experts who can articulate what technologies or projects should exist, even if they are not the ones to build them. We also offer a $1,000 bounty for successful referrals — if you know someone who might be interested in being an author, please share this page with them and ask them to include your name in the application form. If their proposal is accepted, you’ll receive the bounty.\n\nWe expect authoring full Launch Sequence project plans to take 8–14 weeks from accepted pitch to published piece, involving several stages of writing, receiving feedback from IFP and input from external experts, and refining your full project plan.\n\nIFP is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, and will have no claim over any IP related to your idea, nor ownership of any resulting companies. We aim to accelerate authors and builders.\n\nIf you have an idea, we want to hear it. You can learn more and submit an idea via the form below.\n\nThis is a rolling RFP with no submission deadline, but we encourage you to submit a pitch early (within the next few weeks), as we will prioritize early submissions and start reviewing immediately.\n\nQuestions? Email launch.sequence@ifp.org\n\nWe are interested in rapidly building what we need to prepare for a world with advanced AI so that we can fully reap AI’s benefits while managing its new threats. Such an agenda will include a wide-ranging set of projects, including creating companies, tools, technologies, institutions, research streams, resources, and public policies.\n\nWe will only consider projects that address a market failure (or policy gap) and will therefore not be built by default, or not quickly enough. The three core categories where we expect these issues to surface are in accelerating science, strengthening security, and adapting key institutions.\n\nThe lists below are not meant to be exhaustive. Instead, they are meant to illustrate the kinds of projects that we would be excited to support. We encourage you to submit pitches for projects whether or not they are listed below.\n\nWhat resources, technologies, or institutions will scientists need to unlock breakthroughs with AI and other emerging technologies, and which aren’t being created fast enough through market forces or traditional grant funding?\n\nAI promises to transform how science is done. But leveraging AI advances for breakthroughs requires more than capable models. It requires infrastructure, institutions, and resources that no single lab or company has an incentive to build: shared datasets, standardized protocols, access to physical experimentation capacity, and new modes of peer review and validation. Traditional grant funding moves too slowly and often rewards the wrong things; private industry optimizes for what can become profitable, not what will most advance scientific progress. Without targeted investment and effort by the US government and philanthropies, scientific bottlenecks will limit AI-accelerated discovery even as the models improve. Below are non-exhaustive problem areas for which we are excited to receive submissions.\n\nHealth and biology. The highest ambition for AI may be to generate cures to inherited and infectious diseases. But even as AI companies pursue this goal, their efforts alone are unlikely to fully accomplish it: biology is immensely complex, wet lab work is messy and reliant on tacit knowledge, and treatments require extensive clinical trials and regulation before they can even start to be distributed to patients. And even if current technologies eventually scale to this lofty goal, delays, even on the order of years, will have massive life-altering costs for billions of people and avoidable suffering at scale. Moving faster, even to achieve the same outcome, can save millions of lives.\n\nWe are interested in proposals that offer ways to speed up biological research, decrease the time between a treatment’s discovery and its real-world availability, or create the policy entrepreneurship needed to massively improve healthspan around the world.\n\nNovel infrastructure for the scientific process. AI tools are being developed to increase productivity in every industry, science included. However, while commercial interests are rapidly building AI tools for materials or drug discovery, efforts to improve the basic scientific process have received comparatively less attention. We are interested in “horizontal” infrastructure that improves the scientific process itself across fields. Projects to build better tooling for natural and physical sciences include:\n\nMetascience. Scientists spend a great deal of time on the work that surrounds the research enterprise — developing systems to durably maintain and share data, writing and reviewing proposals, and interacting with their supporting and partner institutions. Each of these areas of work is already being transformed by AI, but conventional grants and institutions are slow to catch up. Efforts to reimagine how institutions should adapt to the age of AI include:\n\nOther potential directions. The above categories are non-exhaustive. We would also like to receive proposals for other scientific research directions, such as physics, chemistry, or ecology, or proposals that direct other unmet needs in the research, development, and innovation ecosystem.\n\nWhat tools, technologies, or institutions can we build to ensure rapid AI advances do not undermine national security or public safety?\n\nAI technologies are dual-use. The same capabilities that automate cyberdefense can automate cyberattacks; and the tools that accelerate progress in the life sciences may also reduce the barriers to engineer biological weapons. Furthermore, the transformative potential of AI raises the stakes of geopolitical competition, and strengthens the ability of state and non-state actors to cause widespread and asymmetric harm. No one actor bears these risks, requiring targeted philanthropic and government action to ensure that defenses can scale alongside AI capabilities. We are particularly interested in achieving a world in which defensive technologies are structurally advantaged, such that attacks are quickly detected and contained. Below are non-exhaustive problem areas for which we are excited to receive submissions.\n\nCyber defense. The integration of AI into cyber and cyber-physical systems introduces a broad range of vulnerabilities that hinder AI adoption and increase the attack surface for critical infrastructure. Moreover, AI is already increasing the speed and scale of cyber attacks. By proactively investing in security and leveraging AI for defense, we can enhance our resilience. Potential projects in this space include:\n\nBiological defense. Advances in AI and biotechnology are removing barriers to the development and design of biological weapons, which could cause millions of deaths and trillions in economic damage. How can we prevent the worst outcomes without slowing down beneficial research? Potential projects in this space include:\n\nVerification and evaluation. AI challenges traditional technology-policy frameworks because it lacks many of the typical characteristics they address, like concrete physical forms, easily isolated components, and straightforward version control. To mitigate these problems, we need new methods for the verification of pertinent AI system characteristics (e.g., proving that certain data was used to train a model) and the measurement science of AI system capabilities and propensities (e.g., determining whether a benchmark accurately the risk-relevant properties it claims to). At the same time, these methods will not be effective if they leak or extract other critical information from the systems they are probing. Well-designed and privacy-preserving tools of this kind can enable a world in which governments can trust industry to manage this technology, and nations can credibly signal that their AI capabilities do not pose threats to international security. Potential projects in this space include:\n\nAlignment and control. AI systems demonstrate sophisticated, unintended behaviors as well as the capacity to evade human oversight. As AI agents take on more and more consequential tasks and play a greater role in our personal lives, the risks from alignment and control failures increase. These dangers could compound significantly as coding agents become more integral to AI development. Potential projects in this space include:\n\nOther potential directions. The former categories are not an exhaustive list of ideas we are interested in. Some other promising areas we would like to receive proposals for include:\n\nWhat tools, technologies, organizations, or policies are needed to help society adapt to rapid AI-driven change while preserving human agency, individual freedoms, and democratic institutions?\n\nThe development of advanced AI would alter the very foundations of social and economic life. Translating AI’s potential into widespread flourishing requires forward-looking institutions12 and infrastructure — technological, organizational, and governmental — that can establish shared facts, coordinate at scale, and make rapid, well-informed decisions. Yet most existing systems were not built for the speed and complexity that AI enables, and markets lack the incentives to update some of these systems for this new reality. Below are non-exhaustive problem areas for which we are excited to receive submissions.\n\nIncreasing state capacity. Governments are slow-moving institutions, but it is imperative for them to respond quickly and competently to rapid AI progress. In a world of rapidly advancing AI, the US government has a crucial role to play as an enforcer of law and order, provider of public goods, and the R&D lab of the world.\n\nEpistemic integrity. AI dramatically lowers the cost of generating large volumes of apparently high-quality content, straining our ability to distinguish facts from fiction or propaganda. However, new infrastructure designed to establish ground truths, incorporate a variety of viewpoints in well-organized discussions, and analyze large amounts of data can create a more dynamic marketplace of ideas than ever before. We should be wary of interventions that give any one person, company, or interest group the power to adjudicate what is true and what isn’t — distributed solutions like Community Notes could instead provide less-brittle alternatives. Potential projects in this space include:\n\nCoordination. The costs of coordination — identifying counterparties, becoming informed, negotiating priorities and agreements, and ensuring adherence to terms — mean that many mutually beneficial agreements between people in the world never actually get made. Likewise, the cost of coordination hinders many individuals’ ability to participate in the governance decisions that affect their lives. AI could greatly reduce the costs of coordination, enabling individuals to reach positive-sum outcomes and directly participate in governance at unprecedented scale.\n\nBuilding resources to maintain human agency. In recent history, people have maintained economic and political power because they were needed as workers, taxpayers, soldiers, and voters whose cooperation institutions depended on. As advanced AI automates increasingly large parts of the economy, the risk goes beyond broad unemployment — it’s that as people lose economic leverage, their institutional leverage will suffer too. If institutions can function without broad human participation, they may become less responsive to human needs. Markets and governments will likely produce some tools for adaptation, but may do so unevenly or too slowly to keep pace with AI progress. We’re interested in projects that help people maintain economic relevance and institutional leverage even as advanced AI automates large parts of the workforce.\n\nWe believe this effort is critical, but we are unsure as to what the most promising proposals in this area may be. Proposals in this category should make an especially strong case for why markets or other institutions won’t provide the solution fast enough by default. Possible proposals in this area include concrete programs to help people rapidly adapt their skills; human-in-the-loop tooling to enable workers to efficiently supervise, direct, and collaborate with AI systems at machine speed; and benefits-sharing programs or policies to ensure the broad automation of labor benefits the general population.\n\nOther potential directions. The above categories are not an exhaustive list of ideas we are interested in. Some other promising areas we would like to receive proposals for include:\n\nAcknowledgements: Thank you to Gaurav Sett, Non-Resident Fellow at IFP, for closely consulting on this piece.\n\nMore details under “Who should submit a pitch?”\n\nAI could unlock treatments to the most debilitating human diseases. But some of these fundamental breakthroughs will lack clear commercial incentives or face other barriers. If AI greatly accelerates science, unaddressed bottlenecks will become especially acute, and proactively eliminating these bottlenecks will become especially important.\n\nAI could unlock treatments to the most debilitating human diseases. But some of these fundamental breakthroughs will lack clear commercial incentives or face other barriers. If AI greatly accelerates science, unaddressed bottlenecks will become especially acute, and proactively eliminating these bottlenecks will become especially important.\n\nWe also submitted these proposals to the American Science Acceleration Project RFI, bound them into a beautiful book, and are sending copies to all 535 offices in Congress.\n\nSubmissions to the FDA for drug approval, which collectively form one of the most exhaustive repositories of real-world scientific practice and regulatory negotiation ever assembled, and thus a rich resource for AI to be trained on.\n\nWhile the original Launch Sequence proposals were primarily aimed at the US government, we’re broadening our focus to include projects that can move forward just with philanthropic support. Given our new focus on providing shovel-ready ideas for funders, we will dedicate many more resources to vetting and refining project proposals than we did in the past.\n\nStill, the US government can play a powerful role in implementing many proposals at scale, and we are excited to support proposals that require or benefit from government action.\n\nThis should be interpreted broadly, for example: a pitch for an organization to manufacture next-gen personal protective equipment (PPE) to increase society’s resilience against pandemics would be in scope. This is because future AI may democratize access to the knowledge and tools needed to create engineered viruses, thus increasing our baseline pandemic risk.\n\nExamples with links to existing Launch Sequence project plans:\n\n1. Cases where AI creates/worsens a problem (e.g., biosecurity, offensive cybersecurity, AI sleeper agents, securing AI model weights)\n\n2. Cases where AI can be/support the solution (e.g., automating scientific replication, pathogen detection via metagenomics and ML, AI-powered code refactoring)\n\n3. Cases where AI makes something newly feasible, which will not be done fast enough by default (connectome mapping, self-driving labs)\n\nNote: You will be eligible for this bounty if: (1) we first learn about a particular project idea based on your pitch, and (2) you selected “I just want to submit an idea” in the application form, and (3) we then publish a full project plan based on your initial pitch.\n\nWe will ultimately determine whether we had already considered a project idea, or whether your pitch was the first time we encountered it. Only one person will be eligible for the “idea scout bounty” for every piece we publish.\n\nIf you're proposing a new research group or institution, we are excited to help accelerate the potential founder. If you're proposing a government program, we are excited to make the right connections and help the author make it happen.\n\nWe’ll aim to respond to initial pitches within a few weeks of submission, to allow time for us to investigate the area and consult with our advisors and domain experts.\n\n“Institutions” in this RFP should be interpreted broadly, as “the humanly devised constraints that structure political, economic, and social interaction.”",

    "fullText": "Tesla (TSLA) CEO and SpaceX (SPAX.PVT) founder Elon Musk said at this year's World Economic Form (WEF) that humanoid robots will eventually outnumber humans.\n\nRobinhood chief investment officer Stephanie Guild, Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter Ines Ferré, and Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter Brooke DiPalma joins Opening Bid host Brian Sozzi to discuss Musk's bullish claims on robotics.\n\nCheck out Musk's comments on humanoid robots and Tesla's robotaxi, and watch his full WEF interview.\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Opening Bid.\n\nFor my question of the day, I am sticking with the man Elon Musk. I really enjoyed his talk at Davos and found what he said on humanoid robots quite interesting.\n\nMy prediction is there'll be there'll be more robots than people. Probably sometime next year. I'd say that by the by the end of next year, I I think uh we'd be selling humanoid robots uh to the public.\n\nA new Gartner report this week sheds light on what's coming on the humanoid front potentially. Through 2028, uh less than 100 companies will progress humanoid robot proofs of concept beyond experimentation with fewer than 20 companies going live in production for supply chain and manufacturing use cases. My question is this, should we believe humanoids will be the next great investment opportunity. After all, there is an AI component to these bots. Stephanie, what say you?\n\nAh, it's from a personal perspective, it's a little bit scary. I have to say, but um, it is something that we have been considering in Robin Hood strategies, for example, where we haven't necessarily been looking for companies to invest in that have humanoids in their, uh, you know, in their pipeline, but we have been investing in companies that will provide the eyes and the ears for robots because even if it doesn't end up being a humanoid, I do think this concept of automation replacing humans in some way shape\n\nor form is not going away. That's going to be a growing concept. Um, and so that's where we've been focusing.\n\nAnd as I don't know why I think this, but I think you'd be an earlier uh an early adopter of one of these humanoids in your house.\n\nI would definitely be an earlier adopter.\n\nSee, I know. See, you work with someone long enough, you kind of just know, you know.\n\nMaybe for the yard. But not right now. Oh, for sure, for for everything in the house. Uh, yeah, can the humanoid clean? Oh, sure.\n\nAnd your Costco pizzas. It can make those Costco pizzas for you.\n\nCan can they cook for me? Yeah, of course. Uh I'd be a huge early adopter for humanoid robots and also the robot taxis as well. Uh but look, this year and next year and going forward, it is uh we are starting to see sort of the merging of machinery which has been around, but also now you're adding on the AI layer, the intelligence layer. And that is what's most exciting when talking about humanoid robots in in the future.\n\nAll right, so I got it right with Ines. Brooke, I'm going to guess that you're a little skeptical on the on these humanoids.\n\nBrian, I'm the youngest here and I'm skeptical. I don't think I'd want one of these in my house.\n\nYeah, I knew it. I knew it. I knew it. I knew it.\n\nI think certainly for sure, when when you think about uh the future where this is going. Elon Musk is pretty convincing. He was saying that a lot of his parent- a lot of his friends rather have elderly parents. This was in the conversation at Davos with Larry Fink. A lot of his uh friends have elderly parents and he believes that these humanoid robots will help to take care of an aging population. I thought that was an interesting point. I personally, I love interpersonal relationships. I love, you know, talking to people. I love being the one to sort of\n\njump in. And so I I will say, I'm not bought yet, but if this is anything like uh how Disney Channel's uh The Smart House went, then we're in for something certainly that might be a little scary here. And so, I'm a bit skeptical here, Brian.\n\nAll right, well I will leave it on this. I know my mom is a big opening bid watcher each day. Mom, I will say this to you right to the camera. I'm going to buy one of these robots early to take care of you at some point because look, not to be mean, I I just don't have the time. Sorry mom.",

    "description": "“The limiting factor for AI deployment is fundamentally electrical power,” Musk said at the World Economic Forum on Thursday.",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk warned the biggest issue hampering AI advancement in the United States is a problem Chinese competitors don’t have.\n\nIn a conversation in Davos, Switzerland, with BlackRock CEO and World Economic Forum interim chair Larry Fink, Musk said AI chip production is increasing exponentially, but electrical power is insufficient, hampering the efficiency of AI data centers in training and deploying AI models.\n\n“I think the limiting factor for AI deployment is fundamentally electrical power,” Musk said. “It’s clear that we’re very soon—maybe even later this year—we’ll be producing more chips than we can turn on.”\n\nThe U.S. has been grappling with an outdated grid system, the result of decades of underinvestment and an aging infrastructure. As tech companies increasingly rely on grid operators for electrical power, reliability issues and production limitations have threatened the speed of AI implementation, raising investor concerns of an AI bubble and fueling the belief that the U.S. has already lost the battle with Chinese tech.\n\nTwo massive data centers in Nvidia’s Santa Clara, Calif., hometown may sit empty for years waiting for electricity to power them, according to energy experts. Meanwhile, the massive increase in demand, combined with the need for updated infrastructure, have driven up electricity bills for the average American.\n\nEarlier this month, the Trump administration and 13 bipartisan governors mounted pressure on operators of the country’s largest grid, PJM Interconnection, to boost power supply, as well as hold an auction for tech firms to make offers on 15-year contracts to build power plants, which would transfer the cost of electricity away from consumers and to data center operators.\n\n“We know that with the demands of AI and the power and the productivity that comes with that, it’s going to transform every job and every company and every industry,” Interior Secretary Doug Burgum told reporters last week. “But we need to be able to power that in the race that we are in against China.”\n\nDuring his remarks at the gathering in Davos on Wednesday, President Donald Trump encouraged tech companies to build their own nuclear plants amid the AI push, which he claimed the administration would approve in just three weeks—although these historically take years to approve.\n\nJust as many AI investors fear, China is already well ahead of the U.S. when it comes to production capacity, and the country isn’t saddled with the same limitations as the U.S., Musk said at Davos. China is primarily reliant on solar power, seen as a less expensive alternative to nuclear power, with quicker deployment and fewer safety risks.",

    "fullText": "Kristalina Georgieva says research suggests 60% of jobs in advanced economies will be affected, with many entry-level roles wiped out\n\nArtificial intelligence will be a “tsunami hitting the labour market”, with young people worst affected, the head of the International Monetary Fund warned the World Economic Forum on Friday.\n\nKristalina Georgieva told delegates in Davos that the IMF’s own research suggested there would be a big transformation of demand for skills, as the technology becomes increasingly widespread.\n\n“We expect over the next years, in advanced economies, 60% of jobs to be affected by AI, either enhanced or eliminated or transformed – 40% globally,” she said. “This is like a tsunami hitting the labour market.”\n\nShe suggested that in advanced economies, one in 10 jobs had already been “enhanced” by AI, tending to boost these workers’ pay, with knock-on benefits for the local economy.\n\nMeanwhile people whose jobs were not directly changed by artificial intelligence risked being squeezed, she said, with their pay potentially falling without a productivity boost from AI.\n\n“So the middle class, inevitably, is going to be affected,” Georgieva predicted.\n\nShe said her greatest fear was that AI was insufficiently regulated. “This is moving so fast, and yet we don’t know how to make it safe. We don’t know how to make it inclusive. Wake up, AI is for real, and it is transforming our world faster than we are getting ahead of it,” she said.\n\nMuch of the debate at the annual meeting of the business and political elite in the Swiss ski resort this week has been hijacked by Donald Trump’s on-off tariff threats over the future of Greenland.\n\nBut many delegates were also keen to highlight the risks and benefits of AI. Christy Hoffman, general secretary of the UNI global union, told the Guardian: “It’s just a basic premise that the point of AI, on the business side, is to increase productivity, therefore lower costs – which will be cutting jobs.”\n\n“I think it’s time to come to terms with that disruption – and how to manage that disruption,” she said, calling for the productivity benefits to be distributed fairly across the economy.\n\n“We want to share in the gains. We’re not going to stop AI, nor do we want to even try – but we don’t want it to just roll over us.” She called on employers to discuss the role of AI tools with workers and their representatives before introducing them.\n\nEarlier in the week at Davos, the Microsoft chief executive, Satya Nadella, warned that AI could lose its “social permission” to compete for resources such as energy, for example, if it failed to generate benefits beyond a few powerful tech firms – such as the rapid development of effective new drugs.\n\nGeorgieva was speaking on a panel alongside the president of the European Central Bank, Christine Lagarde, who warned that the AI boom could be hampered by growing mistrust between rival economies, as the US throws up tariff barriers.\n\n“We are dependent on each other,” she said, pointing out that AI was capital intensive, energy intensive and data intensive. If countries did not work cooperatively and “define the new rules of the game,” she said, there would be less capital and less data. “We are in a bind, lets face it,” she said.\n\nLagarde also sounded the alarm about widening global inequality, highlighting the “disparity that is getting deeper and bigger”.\n\nEarlier in the week at Davos, the Canadian prime minister, Mark Carney, urged delegates to face up to a permanent “rupture” in the global economic order, and band together in the face of erratic US trade policy.\n\nBut Lagarde said she was less gloomy. “I’m not exactly on the same page as Mark,” she said. “I’m not sure that we should be talking about rupture. I think we should be talking about alternatives.”",

    "fullText": "Politicians call for more infrastructure funding amid anger that county is seen as ‘holiday playground’\n\nAccessed by a steep, winding lane, the tiny settlement of Cucurrian in the far-west of Cornwall feels remote at the best of times. But over the last two weeks, the people who live here have felt even more isolated after they were left without a way of communicating with the outside world as a result of Storm Goretti.\n\n“I think people feel let down, angry, failed,” said Mark Pugh, an audiobook producer, who has spent more hours than he would care to tot up carefully picking his way out of Cucurrian and sitting in his car in a layby to find a mobile signal good enough to work from. “This storm has shown that Cornwall isn’t resilient enough. A lot is promised, but not enough is delivered.”\n\nGoretti brought down thousands of power, phone and broadband lines and caused countless trees to fall, including one that crushed the caravan of 50-year-old James Southey and killed him.\n\nFor days, many hundreds of people were left without power, water or both, but while those services have been restored, communication links in some places remain down a fortnight on. In a world where reliable online connections are needed for everything from health consultations to banking, it makes life very difficult.\n\n“It’s like we’re forgotten,” said Elaine Claxton, 70, an actor, as she pointed to the wires still broken and dangling next to a giant fallen tree on the lane leading to her home in Cucurrian. She has no broadband, no landline and the mobile signal is unreliable at best. Staying in touch with frail family members a few miles away has been fraught.\n\nHer sister, Shelley Claxton, 63, an animal trainer, said places such as Cucurrian were resilient. “When you’re as remote as we are, you have to be, but I think this storm shows us we need to do something different. Nature is whipping up more and more storms and we need to find ways of adapting to that.”\n\nOn the Lizard peninsula, the southernmost point of the British mainland, Sam Kirby, 53, described how the communication breakdown led to difficulties in working as a digital marketing consultant and in her volunteer role as a coastguard rescue officer.\n\nHer old-style copper landline meant the coastguard station officer could – just about – contact her by phone, but without broadband, working was challenging.\n\n“I had to go full digital nomad, which included time working in a supermarket car park with the car heater on, in the library, and basically perching anywhere I could to find wifi,” she said.\n\n“We’re constantly being told by those pushing Cornwall as a place to work that we’ve got to trade nationally or internationally, that we have the best broadband in the country, that we’re a booming digital economy. It’s hard to boom digitally when you can’t even get a text message out.”\n\nKirby and the people of Cucurrian are angry that Openreach, which builds and maintains the UK’s largest broadband network, has not restored services more quickly.\n\nThere is concern that the continuing switch from copper phone lines to full-fibre broadband makes them more vulnerable. “If this happens again next year, we won’t even have the copper landline so won’t have any link out at all,” said Kirby.\n\nIt is not just remote communities that have been hit. Karen Bennett, 72, lives close to Penzance town centre but a pine tree brought down a pole there, cutting off her broadband.\n\nA new pole has been put up but the broadband hasn’t returned, making her work as chair of the twinning association forging links between Penzance and the French town of Concarneau difficult. “We’ve had to find ways of working around it,” she said. “It’s frustrating. We still don’t know when the broadband will be back.”\n\nThese are interesting political and cultural times in Cornwall. The UK government has indicated that it will explore a bespoke devolution deal for Cornwall, possibly giving it more control over transport, housing and economic development.\n\nThis week the Cornish language – Kernewek – was officially recognised under part three of the European charter for regional or minority languages, which gives it greater protection and status.\n\nBut the loss of power, water and the continuing communications issues have made many Cornish people question whether the rest of the UK cares enough about the far-west of Britain, when it is not holidaying or visiting second homes there.\n\nLoveday Jenkin, a leading member of the political party Mebyon Kernow, which campaigns for greater self-government for Cornwall, said Goretti had exposed weaknesses in its infrastructure.\n\n“It shows Cornwall should have more devolved resilience money,” Jenkin said. “People want to treat Cornwall as a holiday playground. They need to recognise that there are people on the ground who have to manage it but don’t have the money.”\n\nJenkin spoke as yet another storm, named Ingrid by the Portuguese national weather service, brought in strong winds and heavy rain on Friday. “I think UK government needs to recognise Cornwall as the canary in the coalmine in relation to climate change,” Jenkin said. “There will be more storms coming.”\n\nOpenreach said it could not put a figure on how many people in Cornwall were still without broadband and rejected the idea that the switch to fibre made the county more vulnerable, arguing the outages were largely down to trees falling on overhead wires or taking down poles, which affected the copper and fibre network.\n\nA spokesperson said: “Storm Goretti has caused the worst impact to our network in Cornwall in recent memory and as soon as it was safe to do so, we’ve had teams of engineers working round the clock to repair the extensive damage.\n\n“We have managed to reconnect thousands of homes and businesses, but there is more to do and we know how frustrating that is. Unfortunately, the reality is that this type of repair work – closing roads, replacing poles and overhead cables – is complex and time-consuming.”\n\nThe recovery will take a long time. Alasdair Moore, the head of estate and gardens on Tresco, one of the Isles of Scilly, which lies 30 miles (48km) off the mainland and was battered by 99mph gusts during Goretti, said the effect was devastating.\n\nTrees fell, houses were damaged and the water supply interrupted. “The scale of the clear-up is huge,” said Moore. “It will be ongoing for a few years but the way the community and the team has responded has been magnificent.”\n\nMoore said remote communities such as those huddled on Scilly and west Cornwall always got on with it and came good. “Dealing with gales is very much part of this place’s history,” he said.",

    "fullText": "While the US military has pursued ambitious technological advances, manpower remains one of its core pillars.\n\nFrom high-ranking generals to soldiers on the field, human troops remain a key way to assess the reach and power of the world's militaries.\n\nUsing data from the International Institute for Strategic Studies' 2025 Military Balance report, Business Insider ranked countries by the size of their active armed forces and listed their defense budgets, based on 2024 figures.\n\nActive-duty force size is a tally of a country's uniformed troops: airmen, soldiers, sailors, special operators, and Marines. Armies, in particular, depend on size to gain and occupy ground. Militaries can also be a tool of domestic repression, a focus that undercuts its capabilities against an external foe. North Korea, for example, is one of the world's most repressive states, led by a dictator who has repeatedly threatened neighboring South Korea.\n\nThe number of active-duty military personnel is far from the only factor that matters when comparing military power between countries, but it shows latent power that could be augmented via conscription and calling up reservists.\n\n\"Numbers have value, but there's a lot more to military capability,\" said Mark Cancian, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington, DC-based foreign policy and national security think tank.\n\nIISS, a London-headquartered think tank, counts active armed forces, reservists, and paramilitaries as separate categories in its analysis, showing a fuller picture of each nation's manpower.\n\nSome countries have significantly higher numbers of reservists than others — Vietnam has the largest number in the world, estimated at 5 million.\n\nBut while reservists can aid militaries when needed, the quality and longevity of their expertise can vary between conscription- and volunteer-based systems, Cancian told Business Insider.\n\n\"When you look at some countries' reserve numbers, you're often looking at people who haven't trained in 10 or 20 years,\" he said. \"It gives you a big number, but their military value is questionable.\"\n\nAnd while paramilitaries can be effective at enforcing internal security and party strength, Cancian says that \"as a military force, they have essentially zero value.\"\n\nEven when accounting for all of a military's manpower, personnel is only one of the various factors that can qualify a nation's military strength, which also include equipment and readiness.\n\nThere's also the role of technologies in global warfare, the size and sophistication of air forces and naval fleets, amphibious capabilities to land assault forces, command and control systems, or nuclear forces, which all shape military power. Larger and more advanced forces require higher state expenditures.\n\nStill, comparing global manpower offers insight into how countries prioritize military power.\n\nSee how the world's largest militaries stack up.",

Not sure why polymarket made this up.\"\n\nNope. Not sure why polymarket made this up. 🤷‍♂️\n\nIt's not entirely clear where the statement came from. The Polymarket account on X frequently posts aggregated news from around the world, often without citing an original source.\n\nPolymarket did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nBezos did recently speak about about the importance of real-world experience in general.\n\nIn an appearance at Italian Tech Week in November, Bezos advised young entrepreneurs to work at a company before starting their own, rather than dropping out of college like other famous founders.\n\n\"It is possible to, you know, be 18, 19, 20 years old, drop out of college, and be a great entrepreneur,\" Bezos said. \"We have famous examples of that working: Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, etcetera. But these people are the exception.\"\n\n\"I always advise to young people, you know, go work at a best practices company somewhere, where you can learn a lot of basic fundamental things,\" Bezos continued. \"There's still lots of time to start a company after you have absorbed it. It increases your odds, in my opinion.\"\n\nBezos also worked his first job at McDonald's while in high school, and he spoke favorably about the experience in comments that appeared in the 2012 book \"Golden Opportunity: Remarkable Careers That Began at McDonald's.\"\n\n\"You can learn responsibility in any job, if you take it seriously,\" Bezos said. \"You learn a lot as a teenager working at McDonald's. It's different from what you learn in school. Don't underestimate the value of that!\"\n\nElon Musk even weighed in, replying to Bezos with a reference toward President Donald Trump's famous appearance at a McDonald's during the 2024 presidential campaign, where he worked the fryer and appeared at the drive-thru window.\n\n\"Well, the President worked at McDonald's and now he's the President,\" Musk wrote.",

    "fullText": "When it comes to oil-rich countries, one would usually think of Middle Eastern nations like Saudi Arabia or Iraq. But what many do not know is that the country with the largest oil reserves in the world lies just 1,200 miles to the south of Florida — or about a three-and-a-half-hour flight across the Caribbean. This is the state of Venezuela, and the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimates that its oil reserves are at more than 303 billion barrels, as of 2025.\n\nMost of Venezuela's oil is in the Orinoco Belt, a swathe of land north of the Orinoco River, but extracting it poses an unusual set of challenges. The country's oil infrastructure needs to be overhauled due to years of mismanagement and corruption and a history of asset seizures from private companies by the state. The country is also under U.S. sanctions, which limit its ability to sell oil overseas.\n\nVenezuela's crude oil isn't easy to process, either. Saudi Arabian and American oil fields produce light, sweet crude oil, which contains very little sulfur, and isn't corrosive to pipes and equipment. On the other hand, Venezuelan oil is much harder to process because it's mostly heavy and sour, making it harder to process crude oil into unleaded gasoline. Prof. Paasha Mahdavi of the University of California, Santa Barbara, told NPR that it's \"among the dirtiest oils in the world to produce when it comes to global warming.\"\n\nAside from Venezuela, other countries that have massive reserves include Saudi Arabia (267 billion barrels), Iran (208 billion barrels), Iraq (145 billion barrels), and the United Arab Emirates (113 billion barrels). The United States sits in the top eight, with an estimated 45 billion barrels of crude oil in reserve.\n\nOne thing that allowed the U.S. to massively increase its oil reserves and become one of the top 10 countries with the largest oil reserves is the development of fracking. Unlike traditional oil extraction techniques, which siphoned oil deposits from porous material, fracking pumps a special type of fluid deep underground to break the dense rock that holds the oil and make it easier to extract.\n\nOther nations are continually exploring to find new oil fields within their borders, and the U.S. made a new discovery in Texas in January 2026, which potentially has 1.6 billion barrels of oil. So, if there's a new substantial find or new technologies are developed to efficiently extract more oil from existing wells, then it's possible that another state can overtake Venezuela as the largest oil reserve holder in the world.",

    "fullText": "San Francisco Giants star Jung Hoo Lee was detained by immigration officials, prompting Representative Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat and former House Speaker, to intervene.\n\nThe 27-year-old Giants outfielder was stopped by Customs and Border Protection at Los Angeles International Airport Wednesday because he forgot documents in South Korea, Pelosi’s office said in a statement shared by multiple news outlets.\n\n\"Our office is actively working with the Giants organization, our Congressional partners and federal liaisons to resolve this situation and secure Mr. Lee's release expeditiously,\" the two-time former House speaker said.\n\nLee was later released, the Giants said, after his “brief travel issue at LAX due to a paperwork issue.\"\n\n\"The matter was quickly clarified with the appropriate authorities, and he has since been cleared to continue his travel. We appreciate the professionalism of all parties involved,” a spokesperson for the team told the media.\n\nLee’s agent, Scott Boras, told the San Francisco Chronicle it was “not anything political or anything like that.”\n\nDetentions by federal agents have become a hot-button issue amid President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown.\n\nLee arrived at LAX ahead of an appearance at the Giants’ FanFest in San Ramon on Saturday. The tour, which has multiple stops across Northern California, gives fans a chance to meet players and coaches.\n\nLee is of South Korean descent, but he was born in Nagoya, Japan, where his father, Korean baseball star Jong Beom Lee, was playing for the Chunichi Dragons, according to his MLB profile. During his introductory press conference, Lee called himself “Grandson of the Wind.” His father is known as “Son of the Wind.”\n\nLee made his debut in the majors in March 2024 after playing for the Kiwoom Heroes in Korea for seven years. Lee agreed to a six-year contract with the Giants worth $113 million in December 2023, ESPN reported, citing unnamed sources, at the time.\n\nThe Giants will begin spring training for the 2026 season in Scottsdale, Arizona, in early February.",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump spent two hours on Truth Social attacking his enemies and reposting praise after world leaders ignored his “Board of Peace” ceremony in Davos.\n\nThe 79-year-old president shared almost a post a minute on Thursday, hours after his “Board of Peace” initiative at the World Economic Forum attracted a motley crew of Trump-allied leaders from the Middle East and South America.\n\nBetween 10:38 am and 1:01 pm EST, Trump fired off 51 posts, several of which were screenshots of people agreeing with videos he’d posted seconds earlier.\n\nSubjects covered in the posting barrage include a video of White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller bashing Trump’s enemies, a court victory that will allow ICE to use force against protestors in Minnesota, 2020 election fraud conspiracies, threats to sue the New York Times for publishing polls that displease him, and rants against Special Counsel Jack Smith.\n\nSmith was publicly testifying before Congress about the case he had built against Donald Trump for allegedly trying to overturn the 2020 election when the president wrote, “Jack Smith is a deranged animal, who shouldn’t be allowed to practice Law.”\n\nThe president’s posting rampage comes at the end of a humiliating and widely criticized trip to the World Economic Forum.\n\nAfter giving a speech on Wednesday in which he intimated the U.S. could take control of Greenland, Trump met with the Secretary General of NATO, Mark Rutte, who apparently talked him down. Trump walked away from the meeting claiming he’d gotten the “framework of a deal” for the United States on Greenland, but didn’t give any specifics.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump suffered a fresh humiliation at the “Board of Peace” signing party.\n\nThe White House hyped the “Board of Peace” initiative, which nations can join for a $1 billion fee, as a coalition of nations that “promote stability, restore dependable and lawful governance, and secure enduring peace in areas affected or threatened by conflict.”\n\nThough the White House expected representatives from 35 countries at the ceremony, fewer than 20 showed up. World leaders otherwise in attendance at Davos, such as French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, all ignored Trump’s endeavor.\n\nTrump was left signing what critics called a MAGA-fied U.N. charter with the likes of Argentinian President Javier Milei and far-right Hungarian leader Viktor Orban.\n\nTrump called every world leader who signed onto the Board of Peace a “great friend of mine.”\n\nShortly after Trump’s posting spree concluded, his account adopted a different, more optimistic tone.\n\n“Heading back to D.C. It was an incredible time in Davos,” Trump posted at 1:45 pm. “The Greenland structure is being worked on, and will be amazing for the U.S.A., and the Board of Peace is something that the World has never seen before — Very special. So many good things happening! PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP.\"",

    "description": "\"We were able to get firsthand exposure to a lot of real-world scenarios.\"",
    "fullText": "A team from General Motors drove two of its pre-production electric vehicles on an epic roadtrip, collecting real-world data and even helping to solve an annoying charging snafu along the way.\n\nThe company documented the 5,000-mile-long road trip that put the Cadillac OPTIQ luxury crossover and a GMC Sierra EV pickup truck to the test. During the drive, three GM engineers gathered data on its hands-free driver assistance system, EV charging, and real-time range prediction while towing a trailer.\n\n\"We were able to get firsthand exposure to a lot of real-world scenarios, from trailering features and GPS navigation updates to Super Cruise behavior in unusual situations,\" quality engineering manager Tony Kraatz said.\n\n​​GM noted that both vehicles were equipped with advanced monitoring gear that helped the team \"find the root cause of a frustrating problem\": slow performance at one public fast-charging system. Ultimately, they discovered that the charger's software code had a typo that was slowing it down. They contacted the operator, who promptly fixed the issue.\n\nThis kind of extreme real-world testing helps improve overall performance for electric vehicles, which should be a win for greater EV adoption. According to the Department of Energy, driving an EV can help slash fuel costs, though it adds that initial costs for EVs can be greater than those of combustion engine vehicles.\n\nStill, many states offer rebates or tax credits that help offset this. For instance, New Mexico gives residents a $3,000 state tax credit when they purchase a new EV.\n\nEV users can save even more money — and avoid annoying malfunctions like the one described by GM — by charging at home instead of using public chargers. If you're interested in exploring home-charging options, Qmerit can help get you started with a Level 2 charger system. The company offers free installation estimates, too.\n\nIf you're ready for even more savings, using solar to power your home can help reduce charging costs even further. TCD's Solar Explorer has all sorts of resources and can link you up with trusted partners that could help save up to $10,000 on installation costs.\n\nHow long would you be willing to wait for an EV to charge?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": "Nipah is a deadly virus with no vaccine or cure and considered a high-risk pathogen by the World Health Organization",
    "fullText": "India is moving quickly to contain a Nipah virus outbreak in the eastern state of West Bengal after five cases were confirmed, including doctors and nurses who were infected.\n\nNearly 100 people have been asked to quarantine at home, and infected patients were being treated in hospitals in and around the capital Kolkata, according to local media reports, with one patient in a critical condition.\n\nNipah is a deadly virus with no vaccine or cure and is considered a high-risk pathogen by the World Health Organization. Experts say human infections are rare and usually occur when the virus spills over from bats, often through contaminated fruit.\n\nHere is everything you need to know about this virus:\n\nNipah virus (NiV) infection most often begins with non-specific symptoms, making early detection difficult.\n\nAccording to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the incubation period is generally believed to range from four to 21 days, though longer delays between exposure and illness have been reported in rare cases during previous outbreaks.\n\nPatients typically develop a sudden flu-like illness marked by fever, headache, muscle pain and fatigue. In some cases, respiratory symptoms such as cough, shortness of breath or pneumonia also occur, although the timing and severity of these symptoms can vary widely.\n\nThe most serious and defining complication of Nipah infection is inflammation of the brain, known as encephalitis. Neurological symptoms, including confusion, altered consciousness, seizures or coma, usually appear several days to weeks after the initial onset of illness.\n\nSome patients may also develop meningitis.\n\nNipah virus is associated with a high death rate, with fatality levels reported between 40 and 75 per cent depending on the outbreak and the viral strain involved.\n\nSurvivors may experience long-term neurological effects, such as persistent seizures or changes in personality, according to the UK Health Security Agency’s update.\n\nIn rare cases, encephalitis has been reported to recur months or even years after the initial infection, either due to relapse or reactivation of the virus.\n\nNipah virus is a zoonotic pathogen that can be transmitted from animals to humans and from person to person, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nThe primary natural carriers are fruit bats (Pteropus species); humans can become infected through direct contact with infected bats or other animals, or by consuming food contaminated with bat saliva, urine or faeces.\n\nHuman‑to‑human transmission has also been reported, particularly through close contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person.\n\nNipah virus (NiV) was first identified in 1999 after an outbreak of encephalitis and respiratory illness among pig farmers and others who had close contact with infected pigs in Malaysia and Singapore. The episode led to the recognition of NiV as a serious zoonotic pathogen capable of crossing from animals to humans.\n\nSince then, repeated outbreaks have been recorded in South Asia. Parts of northeast India and several districts in Bangladesh have reported cases, with Bangladesh experiencing outbreaks almost every year since 2001.\n\nIn southern India, the state of Kerala reported its first Nipah outbreak in 2018, followed by sporadic cases in subsequent years.\n\nBeyond South Asia, infections have also been reported in the Philippines, with investigations suggesting they were caused by the Nipah virus or a closely related Nipah-like strain.\n\nScientific studies have identified fruit bats as the natural reservoir of the virus. Nipah virus has been isolated from bat urine in Malaysia, and antibodies have been detected in at least 23 bat species across Asia as well as in parts of Africa, including Ghana and Madagascar.\n\nDespite this wide animal reservoir, confirmed human outbreaks have so far been limited to South and Southeast Asia, typically occurring in rural or semi-rural settings where contact between humans, bats and domestic animals is more likely, WHO says.\n\n“Human-to-human transmission of Nipah virus has also been reported among family and caregivers of infected patients,” according to WHO.\n\nThere is currently no proven, targeted treatment for Nipah virus (NiV) infection and no approved vaccine to prevent it.\n\nCare for patients remains largely supportive, focusing on managing symptoms and complications as they arise.\n\nThe virus is listed by the WHO as a priority pathogen under its Research and Development Blueprint, which identifies epidemic threats that require urgent research.\n\nFollow these essential precautions to prevent Nipah Virus infection. Stay alert, stay informed, and follow advisories issued by local health authorities.#NipahVirus #PublicHealth #HealthForAll pic.twitter.com/itTuZA18ev\n\n— Ministry of Health (@MoHFW_INDIA) January 22, 2026\n\nWith no vaccine available, preventing Nipah virus infection relies on awareness and simple protective measures, global health agencies recommend. Public health advice focuses on reducing contact with the virus, whether from bats, animals, or infected people.\n\nPreventing bat-to-human transmission: Bats are the main carriers of Nipah. People should avoid consuming raw date palm sap or fruits that might have been contaminated by bats, WHO guidelines advise.\n\nBoiling fresh date palm juice and thoroughly washing or peeling fruits can reduce risk. Any fruit showing signs of bat bites should be discarded, the health agency advises.\n\nPreventing animal-to-human transmission: People handling sick animals, their tissues, or during slaughter should wear gloves and protective clothing. Contact with infected pigs should be minimised, and pig farms in areas with fruit bats should take steps to protect feed and enclosures from bats.\n\nSymptoms of Nipah Virus in humans can range from fever and headache to respiratory distress and neurological complications.\nEarly recognition of these symptoms and timely medical care are critical to reducing severity and preventing complications.#NipahVirus #HealthAwareness… pic.twitter.com/odW9baGomD\n\n— Ministry of Health (@MoHFW_INDIA) January 20, 2026\n\nPreventing human-to-human transmission: Avoid close, unprotected contact with people infected with Nipah. Regular hand washing after caring for or visiting sick individuals is essential to stop the virus from spreading.\n\nThe 2011 film Contagion, which depicts a fast-spreading global virus, was partly inspired by real-life pathogens like the Nipah virus, a bat-borne virus first identified in Malaysia in 1999, according to global health non-profit Path’s website.\n\nNipah causes severe respiratory illness and brain inflammation (encephalitis) and can spread from animals to humans, contaminated food, or infected people.\n\nIts high fatality rate, potential for outbreaks, and lack of a vaccine made it a model for how a zoonotic virus could trigger a pandemic, which filmmakers used to shape the realistic global crisis in Contagion, Path noted.",

    "fullText": "The World Economic Forum in Davos has an unofficial dress code: neutral colors, sensible shoes, and quiet-luxury pieces built for subzero temperatures.\n\nJolie Hunt, however, doesn't follow it.\n\nThe 47-year-old founder and CEO of the communications firm Hunt & Gather, who has made more than 20 trips to the global leadership event, has turned Switzerland into her personal runway.\n\nAt this year's WEF, Hunt wore a mix of form-fitting dresses, statement heels, and designer bags — a far cry from the simple winter coat-and-boot combos seen throughout the town.\n\n\"I can't tell you how many people stop me in my tracks and say, 'I love what you're wearing,'\" Hunt told Business Insider.\n\nHer outfits have made her one of the most fashionable people you'll find in Davos as the world's elite, from business to government leaders, convene.\n\nHunt's standout fashion is on display from the moment she leaves New York City.\n\n\"I always travel in black,\" she said. \"I like a theme, and I don't like any loose ends. I'm sure I was French in a former life.\"\n\nThis year, she departed for Davos on January 18, wearing a $1,650 Balenciaga hoodie with fur trim, leather pants, and silver Givenchy sneakers. She also had two Louis Vuitton luggage pieces in hand.\n\n\"I never check a bag,\" she said. \"It's one of my super skills. I pick a theme for what I'm going to wear, down to my pajamas. Everything has a job and a purpose, so there's never any fluff.\"\n\nThis trip, she chose red as her statement color and packed shoes and accessories that complemented her chosen outfits.\n\nOne of the first she wore at Davos comprised a $3,390 printed minidress from Balmain, sheer tights, $575 Larroudé x Libertine pumps, and an Hermès bag.\n\n\"It's a black crocodile Birkin; it's very special,\" she said. \"I wouldn't usually bring it on a trip, but it matches everything, and I'm with all the masters of the universe, so I might as well bring out the big guns.\"\n\nShe wore the dress on Monday to host an event she calls the Stragglers Dinner, which brings together members of various companies and media outlets.\n\nOn Wednesday, she wore a $1,195 red Sportmax dress beneath a $3,990 Balenciaga coat, which she bought specifically for her trip to Davos.\n\nShe accessorized with her Hermès bag, knee-high boots, and sheer Saint Sass tights with the word \"killer\" printed on the thigh.\n\n\"I'm in my 'optimized for joy' part of life,\" she said. \"Maybe this comes with age and status, but I think getting a little bit older and having done this a bunch, I feel much freer in my [fashion] choices.\"\n\nShe wore the look to attend Cisco's Women in Tech breakfast, to get drinks with company executives, and to attend the Semafor Media Party, among other events.\n\nHunt was also wearing the outfit during our phone interview, during which someone stopped her to compliment the look.\n\nIn Hunt's experience, flashy outfits are uncommon at the World Economic Forum.\n\n\"Nobody wears color. It's honestly depressing,\" she said. \"You look in a room, and you don't see a single person who's not wearing navy, gray, or black — men and women.\"\n\nShe attributes that to a few things. First, the city's icy weather makes wearing heels, dresses, and other fashion pieces impractical. Second, the event is rather reserved in nature.\n\n\"For years, this was kind of a boys' club,\" Hunt said. \"Men dressed very conservatively, and I think as women became matriculated into the program, they also kept it conservative. We didn't want to ruffle too many feathers.\"\n\nWith every outfit, though, Hunt is changing that. She said her outfits bring her confidence and energy.\n\n\"In places like this, it's a little bit survival of the fittest, if I'm honest,\" she said. \"Everybody's either eyeing up your affiliation, your look, or what you can do for them. Fashion is the quickest signal that you're either intimidating, interesting, or a whole host of other things.\"",

    "description": "Casper Frank Møller, CEO of Raw Arctic, explains how his Greenland tourism firm handles global attention and uncertainty amid renewed US interest.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Casper Frank Møller, 28, the CEO and cofounder of Raw Arctic, a tourism business based in Greenland's capital, Nuuk. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nAbout three and a half years ago, my friend Isak and I traveled along the west coast of Greenland to explore. We both love spending time outdoors — Isak is an expert in Arctic hiking and hunting, and I love fly fishing.\n\nWe're also outgoing, and wherever we went, people seeking tourist opportunities would ask us if we wanted to be their guides. That made us realize there was a gap in the market for adventure tours that we really wanted to exploit.\n\nIn 2024, we, along with our third cofounder, established our company, Raw Arctic.\n\nThere are a lot of different tourist companies in Greenland. It's actually a highly competitive market, and you have to find a way to differentiate yourself.\n\nWe decided to go with more expensive, tailor-made tours for adventure-seeking clientele who want to explore the entirety of Greenland.\n\nFor example, we've had customers who charter a helicopter for multiple days and go skiing in the mountains, spending upward of 20,000 pounds (about $26,000) a day.\n\nWhen Trump resurfaced the topic of taking Greenland in early 2025, we saw a rapid surge of interest in tourists wanting to visit. The attention was really good for business in the beginning because it put us on the world map and into people's subconscious.\n\nHowever, this entire situation with the US has raised more concerns because of what we saw in Venezuela. There's way more power behind Trump's words, which has created concerns not only among people in Greenland but the world order.\n\nGeopolitical issues usually have big consequences for tourism in general and for how people spend their money, and we're seeing that at Raw Arctic.\n\nIt's expensive to visit Greenland. Most people aren't booking a quick weekend getaway here, though some do. You can only reach the different cities by sea or by air. It costs at least 200 pounds ($270) per hour just to charter a small boat — though you can reduce the cost per ticket with a larger group — and it takes a lot of time to go from one place to the next.\n\nSome folks are spending their savings on a once-in-a-lifetime trip to come here. So when there's geopolitical instability, people become more conservative with their money. That's not unique to Greenland, but we feel it very directly right now.\n\nSince the US raid on Venezuela, we've had a lot of people — about 20 to 30 — on standby, saying they're going to wait this out before they make a final decision.\n\nAt the same time, we've continued to grow the business. We've been able to invest in new boats, marketing, and digital solutions.\n\nWe've also expanded beyond being just an operator, running tours directly. We work as an agent across Greenland, partnering with dozens of local guides and operators in smaller coastal settlements.\n\nThat part is important to us. Tourism shouldn't be centralized in the capital. The people who live in these remote areas are the best at showing off their regions, their nature, and their way of life. Giving them a voice and an opportunity is one of our core missions.\n\nFor me personally, the situation with the US has been a mix of feelings. I'm a relatively young guy, and this is my future. It's my time at stake.\n\nOf course, I get concerned about the state of things, but there's some logical part of me that feels secure that the US won't acquire us because it's too big a risk to national relations.\n\nAbout a year ago, I saw a more polarized Greenland with the general elections — one part of Greenland wanted to cut ties with Denmark and achieve rapid independence, and another wanted to stay with Denmark and achieve independence more slowly.\n\nWhen we talk about independence, there are two parts to it. There's one about cultural independence. I think that's what we're achieving at the moment as a people, and that's what the last year has really pushed.\n\nThen there's the economic part. We get about 4 billion Danish crowns ($628 million) a year from the Danish block grant, which stabilizes the Greenlandic economy. I think the economic situation would look different if ties were cut immediately.\n\nWhat I'm now seeing with Trump's interest in the island is a less polarized Greenland. We don't want to be American. We don't want to be Danish. We want to be Greenlandic. The question is just, when should we cut the ties?",

    "fullText": "Misinformation technology could be deployed at scale to disrupt 2028 US presidential election, AI researchers say\n\nPolitical leaders could soon launch swarms of human-imitating AI agents to reshape public opinion in a way that threatens to undermine democracy, a high profile group of experts in AI and online misinformation has warned.\n\nThe Nobel peace prize-winning free-speech activist Maria Ressa, and leading AI and social science researchers from Berkeley, Harvard, Oxford, Cambridge and Yale are among a global consortium flagging the new “disruptive threat” posed by hard-to-detect, malicious “AI swarms” infesting social media and messaging channels.\n\nA would-be autocrat could use such swarms to persuade populations to accept cancelled elections or overturn results, they said, amid predictions the technology could be deployed at scale by the time of the US presidential election in 2028.\n\nThe warnings, published today in Science, come alongside calls for coordinated global action to counter the risk, including “swarm scanners” and watermarked content to counter AI-run misinformation campaigns. Early versions of AI-powered influence operations have been used in the 2024 elections in Taiwan, India and Indonesia.\n\n“A disruptive threat is emerging: swarms of collaborative, malicious AI agents,” the authors said. “These systems are capable of coordinating autonomously, infiltrating communities and fabricating consensus efficiently. By adaptively mimicking human social dynamics, they threaten democracy.”\n\nOne leading expert in propaganda technology, Inga Trauthig, said the adoption of such advanced technology is likely to be slowed by politicians’ reluctance to cede campaign control to AIs. Another cause for skepticism is concern that using such illicit techniques would not be worth the risk, given voters are still more influenced by offline material.\n\nThe experts behind the warning include New York University’s Gary Marcus, a prominent sceptic about the claimed potential of current AI models who calls himself a “generative AI realist”, and Audrey Tang, Taiwan’s first digital minister, who has warned: “Those in the pay of authoritarian forces are undermining electoral processes, weaponizing AI and employing our societal strengths against us.”\n\nOthers include David Garcia, professor for social and behavioural data science at the University of Konstanz, Sander van der Linden, a misinformation expert and director of Cambridge University’s social decision-making lab, and Christopher Summerfield, AI researcher and professor of cognitive neuroscience at Oxford University.\n\nTogether they say political leaders could deploy almost limitless numbers of AIs to masquerade as humans online and precisely infiltrate communities, learn their foibles over time and use increasingly convincing and carefully tailored falsehoods, to change population-wide opinions.\n\nThe threat is being supercharged by advances in AIs’ ability to pick up on the tone and content of discourse. They are increasingly able to mimic human dynamics, for example, by using appropriate slang and posting irregularly to avoid detection. Progress in the development of “agentic” AI also means the ability to autonomously plan and coordinate action.\n\nAs well as operating across social media, they may use messaging channels and even write blogs or use email, depending on which channel the AI thinks best helps achieve an aim, said one of the authors, Daniel Thilo Schroeder, a research scientist at the Sintef research institute in Oslo.\n\n“It’s just frightening how easy these things are to vibe code and just have small bot armies that can actually navigate online social media platforms and email and use these tools,” said Schroeder, who has been simulating swarms in laboratory conditions.\n\nAnother of the authors, Jonas Kunst, professor of communication at the BI Norwegian Business School, said: “If these bots start to evolve into a collective and exchange information to solve a problem – in this case a malicious goal, namely analysing a community and finding a weak spot – then coordination will increase their accuracy and efficiency.\n\n“That is a really serious threat that we predict is going to materialise.”\n\nIn Taiwan, where voters are regularly targeted by Chinese propaganda, often unknowingly, AI bots have been increasing engagement with citizens on Threads and Facebook in the last two to three months, said Puma Shen, a Taiwanese Democratic Progressive Party MP and campaigner against Chinese disinformation.\n\nDuring discussions on political topics the AIs tend to provide “tonnes of information that you cannot verify”, creating “information overload”, Shen said. He said AIs might cite fake articles about how America will abandon Taiwan. Another recent trend is for the AI bots to stress to younger Taiwanese people that the China-Taiwan dispute is very complicated “so do not take sides if you have no knowledge”.\n\n“It’s not telling you that China’s great, but it’s [encouraging them] to be neutral,” Shen told the Guardian. “This is very dangerous, because then you think people like me are radical.”\n\nAmid signs the progress of AI technology is not as rapid as Silicon Valley companies like OpenAI and Anthropic have claimed, the Guardian asked independent AI experts to assess the swarm warnings.\n\n“In the election-heavy year of 2024 the capabilities were there for AI-driven microtargeting but we didn’t see as much of that as scholars predicted,” said Trauthig, an adviser to the International Panel on the Information Environment. “Most political propagandists I interview are still using older technologies and are not at this cutting edge.”\n\n“It isn’t fanciful,” said Michael Wooldridge, professor of the foundations of AI at Oxford University. “I think it is entirely plausible that bad actors will try to mobilise virtual armies of LLM-powered agents to disrupt elections and manipulate public opinion, for example targeting large numbers of individuals on social media and other electronic media. It’s technologically perfectly feasible … the technology has got progressively better and much more accessible.”\n\nThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.\n\nIf you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.\n\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\n\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

    "fullText": "AI evangelist Peter Kyle wants to scale up businesses, attract overseas investors and look out for UK’s poorer regions\n\nThe UK business secretary, Peter Kyle, has said he is “betting big” and “picking winners” as the government takes direct stakes in growing businesses to boost economic growth.\n\nSpeaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, where he and the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, have been talking up Britain’s prospects, Kyle said ministers were taking an “activist” approach to industrial policy.\n\nThe idea of “picking winners” is closely associated with the Conservative prime minister Margaret Thatcher’s attacks on Labour’s 1970s strategy and her argument that it should be the private sector that decides which companies thrive.\n\nKyle was unabashed about invoking the phrase, arguing a muscular approach could accelerate economic growth. “I want to make sure that the benefits of growth are felt quicker than is currently the case. We’re predicted to grow 1.5% this year. That is not enough.”\n\nHe highlighted the recent decision to allow the £26bn state-owned British Business Bank to buy equity stakes in companies, including the announcement last week of a £25m investment in the energy supplier Octopus’s software spin-off, Kraken.\n\n“The most potential in our economy, in the short and medium term, is scale-up companies,” Kyle said. “I was at Octopus yesterday. They’re now employing 1,500 people in their head office in London alone.\n\n“We can find other companies that are on that kind of trajectory and we can expedite their growth. Then it will create thousands of new jobs, and it will create enormous amounts of wealth, which will recycle through the economy in a really fast way.”\n\n“I am betting big. And I am picking winners,” he added. “It’s more activist. And there will be things that don’t work out, sure. But to have a healthy economy, failure leads to success.”\n\nThis week’s summit in the Swiss ski resort has been overshadowed by Donald Trump’s threat to slap tariffs on eight European countries if they stood in the way of his hopes of annexing Greenland.\n\nThe president backed away from the idea of punitive import taxes on Wednesday evening, after discussions with the secretary general of Nato, Mark Rutte, but several leaders in the Swiss ski resort have said the global economic order has irrevocably changed.\n\nKyle insisted international uncertainty was no reason not to press ahead with Labour’s agenda, highlighting the prospects of a “wave of opportunity that technology and life sciences and all these huge, huge, positive waves of innovation are going to present to us”.\n\nHe said: “If we are too intimidated by the global challenges, if we are too distracted by domestic political to and fro, then we will take our eye off the ball, and we will miss the opportunity of a lifetime, and that means real things to real people.\n\n“There will be kids growing up like me that will not end up becoming successful like I have. It’ll be communities that, at the moment, are poor, and they will never have a hope of becoming prosperous. And I won’t stand for it. I would literally do anything. And if that means betting [on] winners, and getting it wrong from time to time, I’ll take it.”\n\nAnnouncing the beefing up of the government’s “global talent taskforce” in his department, the business secretary suggested that the UK hoped to capitalise on the instability unleashed by Trump’s policies to help it attract jobs and investment.\n\n“I will suck the best talent in from wherever it exists, and talent goes both ways across the Atlantic. And I want to make sure that we have a good balance in that because for too long it’s been in one direction,” he said.\n\nHighlighting the need to attract innovators in particular, Kyle added: “America is being disruptive with tariffs, but America isn’t the most friendly place for scientific endeavour in any case at the moment. Do the maths and add up where we’re going with this. We are going out there and we’re saying: ‘Actually, we have one of the best regulatory environments in the world for life sciences, and across the board.’”\n\nKeir Starmer has taken a tough line on migration – despite pushback from some quarters in the party – promising to reduce it and condemning Boris Johnson’s administration for what the prime minister has called an “open borders experiment”.\n\nBut Kyle said he did not think public scepticism about migration extended to wealthy entrepreneurs. “People are deeply concerned about the immigration system we inherited, and the asylum system, which was overwhelmed, and was poorly administered by the Tories, and therefore broken,” he said.\n\n“I’ve never had anybody that says that people with a lot of money to invest in our country, who want to come here and create jobs, create businesses, shouldn’t be coming to do so.”\n\nHe added: “I have a taskforce that’s doing this, embedded in our global network. We can offer the world’s most talented a bespoke package to come to the UK swiftly, to embed, and then, of course, be part of a funding landscape that is bountiful.”\n\nThe 55-year-old MP for Hove and Portslade has been business secretary since Starmer’s September reshuffle, replacing Jonathan Reynolds, who had done the job for several years in opposition.\n\nKyle is politically close to the health secretary, Wes Streeting – who has been repeatedly mooted as a potential challenger to Starmer – but has been scrupulously loyal to the prime minister in public.\n\nEarlier this week, the business secretary rejected the suggestion that the UK try to negotiate a customs union with the EU, for which Streeting has signalled his support, telling the FT: “I think at the moment it would be foolish to slip towards what would be simple solutions.”\n\nKyle has dyslexia and left his state school “without any usable” qualifications, as he has put it. He made his way to university aged 25, and went on to secure a PhD, then worked in the charity sector before entering politics.\n\nIn his previous job of technology secretary, he was forced to defend his closeness to powerful tech companies. He is a regular user of the chatbot ChatGPT and an evangelist for the opportunities offered by the technology – and is often seen in the casual garb favoured by “tech bros”.\n\nSoon after taking on his current role, Kyle struck a deal with business groups and trade unions to water down the implementation of Labour’s Employment Rights Act, introducing a six-month probation period before the promised “day-tone rights” come into force.\n\nHe has continued to work closely with his successor and friend, Liz Kendall, and said he has insisted the connecting door that blocked the corridor between their two offices be opened up.\n\nAsked whether AI would cause mass layoffs as companies decide they can manage without entry-level staff – a hot topic at Davos – Kyle said: “People are anxious and it’s going to be painful and difficult because change is always painful and difficult.”\n\nKyle said Labour was ready to intervene to ensure the adoption of AI was less painful for poorer communities than the deindustrialisation of the 1980s, which cast a long shadow.\n\nHe said: “Waves of industrial change have always gone badly when governments stand on the sidelines and are not participants. And I will not allow that to happen.\n\n“As tech secretary I was negotiating deals for investment in digital infrastructure, insisting it happened in poorer parts of the country. I’m the gatekeeper into our country for a lot of investors. And if they want to come and benefit from our country, then they can contribute to it as well.”",

    "description": "Three robotics experts said humanoid robots need to move beyond flashy demos to performing tasks that are actually useful in the real world at scale.",
    "fullText": "Humanoid robots can do kung-fu and parkour. But can they make your morning coffee?\n\nAt a Davos panel on Thursday, moderated by Business Insider's Jamie Heller, three robotics experts said humanoid robots needed to move beyond flashy demos and perform useful tasks in the real world at scale.\n\nJake Loosararian, the CEO of infrastructure startup Gecko Robotics, said that deploying robots into real-world environments was the major challenge facing the much-hyped industry.\n\n\"Deployment is the big problem right now for robotics, in terms of the ability for it to begin to make really large impacts, and for there to be a clear road map,\" said Loosararian.\n\nThe cofounder of the Pittsburgh-based company said that building reliable sources of data about the environments in which humanoid robots were operating would be critical for startups looking to move beyond flashy demos to real-world returns.\n\n\"You have to forward deploy and build your robots as close to the environment as possible. And that gives you the information and dataset that doesn't exist anywhere on the internet, anywhere on YouTube, about what these environments are like,\" Loosararian added.\n\nDaniela Rus, the director of MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, said there was a gap between robots' ability to perform tasks in a laboratory and their ability to take on jobs traditionally done by humans in the real world.\n\n\"I can give you a robot that will fold your laundry and load your dishwasher, but it might cost you half a billion dollars,\" she said.\n\nRus said bridging that gap would require advancements in a humanoid robot's ability to perceive and manipulate the world through improved sensors and new AI models that can handle situations the robot may not have encountered before.\n\nShao Tianlan, the CEO of Chinese AI and robotics firm Mech-Mind, said that one big barrier to making humanoid robots useful in a factory environment was developing the capacity for them to learn directly from their human coworkers.\n\n\"If we want to deploy a robot, I would say demonstration is the most intuitive way to tell robots what to do. That's exactly how we humans teach others,\" he said.\n\nTianlan, who said that Mech-Mind had delivered more than 10,000 \"intelligent robots\" over the last 12 months, added that he did not believe humanoid robots needed \"Einstein-level\" intelligence to perform useful tasks, however.\n\nHe predicted that robots would take on some jobs performed by humans in controlled environments, such as in logistics and some service industries, in the next \"few hundred days.\"\n\nHumanoid robots are riding a wave of hype as companies like Tesla and Figure prepare to begin large-scale manufacturing of their machines. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has made bold predictions about the company's Optimus robot, saying it could eliminate poverty and be the biggest product of all time.\n\nHowever, most humanoid robots have not yet been deployed in real-world environments. Many humanoid robot demos are staged in tightly controlled settings, and some use teleoperation, where human operators pilot the robots remotely.\n\nLoosararian called teleoperation the \"dirty little secret\" of robotics, adding that robotics companies had a responsibility to inform customers about whether their humanoid robots are operating autonomously or with human assistance.\n\n\"There's a lot of autonomy for certain tasks, but for the majority of the cases, for humanoids, it's learning in the environment, and it has to do that with teleoperation,\" Loosararian said.",

    "fullText": "Elon Musk once called Davos \"boring af.\" After his first appearance, some attendees might agree with him.\n\nThe billionaire took to the stage at the World Economic Forum in a surprise appearance on Thursday for an interview that touched on many points of his sprawling business empire — but offered few new details.\n\nMusk has previously avoided the conference, and the Tesla CEO has in the past criticized Davos and its organizing body, the World Economic Forum.\n\nAnticipation was therefore high after Musk was unexpectedly added to the schedule on Thursday morning.\n\nInterviewed by Larry Fink, the BlackRock CEO and interim WEF cochair, Musk began by explaining Tesla's mission of \"abundance for all,\" largely reiterating comments he's previously made on X and in other interviews.\n\nThe world's richest man predicted that \"ubiquitous\" AI and robotics would lead to an unprecedented expansion of the global economy and ultimately render work obsolete, and predicted that \"AI will be smarter than all of humanity collectively\" by 2030 or 2031.\n\n\"At a certain point, there will be such an abundance of goods and services because my prediction is there'll be more robots than people,\" Musk said.\n\nThe billionaire did, however, share a more concrete timeline for Optimus: he expects Tesla to start selling the humanoid robots to the public by the end of next year.\n\nMusk didn't address Tesla's robotaxi rollout — another product critical to the company's future — beyond reiterating that he hoped to get approval for its Full Self-Driving technology in Europe and China next month. Investors are keen for details about when the company will remove human safety operators from its service in Austin and begin planned operations in several new US cities.\n\nMuch of the interview focused on space-based AI data centers, a topic that Musk and other Big Tech CEOs have discussed extensively in recent months.\n\nMusk told Fink that SpaceX would begin launching solar-powered AI satellites into space \"within a few years,\" adding that he expected space-based computing to largely solve the wrangling over the vast amounts of energy used to power AI back on earth.\n\n\"The net effect is that the lowest cost place to put AI will be in space, and that'll be true within two years, maybe three at the latest,\" said Musk.\n\nThe SpaceX founder also touched on the longevity trend, saying that ageing was a \"solvable problem,\" but warned that society could \"lack vibrancy\" if humans were able to live forever.\n\nMusk ended his Davos debut with an appeal to optimism, a philosophical conclusion for someone who has previously used public appearances to attack his business rivals and issue eye-catching pronouncements.\n\n\"I think my last words would be, I would encourage everyone to be optimistic and excited about the future,\" Musk said.\n\n\"Generally, I think for quality of life, it is actually better to err on the side of being an optimist and be wrong rather than be a pessimist and right,\" he added.",

It's not a subtle thing,\" Musk said. \"The reason I say it's not a subtle thing is because all the cells in your body, you know, pretty much age at the same rate. I've never seen someone with an old left arm and a young right arm ever in my life, so why is that? There must be a clock that is synchronizing across 35 trillion cells in your body,\"\n\nBut Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, said there would be some downsides to longer lives.\n\n\"You know, there is some benefit to death, by the way. There's a reason why we don't actually have a longer lifespan, because if people do live for a very long time, I think there's some risk of an ossification of society. Of things getting locked in place,\" he said. \"It may become stultifying. A lack of vibrancy, but that said, do I think we'll figure out ways to extend life and maybe even reverse aging?

The guest list included President Donald Trump, who made his case for the US to annex Greenland and the US's economic agenda during his address on Wednesday.\n\nTrump's push for Greenland has rattled European leaders and the US markets. It's also shocked Greenlanders, who have spoken against the annexation and the Trump administration.\n\n\"We're not for sale,\" one resident said.\n\nTrump said the US would not use military force to take Greenland, but has leveraged tariffs against European countries in his campaign.\n\nThe weeklong event ends on Friday with closing remarks from WEF President Børge Brende and Saudi Arabia's Minister of Economy and Planning.",

It suggests the impact of the technology may have been broader than previously thought. Public figures identified in sexualised images it analysed include Selena Gomez, Taylor Swift, Billie Eilish, Ariana Grande, Ice Spice, Nicki Minaj, Christina Hendricks, Millie Bobby Brown, the Swedish deputy prime minister Ebba Busch, and the former US vice-president Kamala Harris.\n\nThe feature was restricted to paid users on 9 January and further restrictions followed after the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, called the situation “disgusting” and “shameful”. Other countries, including Indonesia and Malaysia, announced blocks on the AI tool.\n\nCCDH estimated that over the 11-day period, Grok was helping create sexualised images of children every 41 seconds. These included a selfie uploaded by a schoolgirl undressed by Grok, turning a “before school selfie” into an image of her in a bikini.\n\n“What we found was clear and disturbing: in that period Grok became an industrial-scale machine for the production of sexual abuse material,” said Imran Ahmed, CCDH’s chief executive. “Stripping a woman without their permission is sexual abuse. Throughout that period Elon was hyping the product even when it was clear to the world it was being used in this way. What Elon was ginning up was controversy, eyeballs, engagement and users. It was deeply disturbing.”\n\nHe added: “This has become a standard playbook for Silicon Valley, and in particular for social media and AI platforms. The incentives are all misaligned. They profit from this outrage. It’s not about Musk personally. This is about a system [with] perverse incentives and no minimum safeguards prescribed in law. And until regulators and lawmakers do their jobs and create a minimum expectation of safety, this will continue to happen.”\n\nX announced it had stopped its Grok feature from editing pictures of real people to show them in revealing clothes, including for premium subscribers, on 14 January.\n\nX referred to its statement from last week, which said: “We remain committed to making X a safe platform for everyone and continue to have zero tolerance for any forms of child sexual exploitation, non-consensual nudity, and unwanted sexual content.\n\n“We take action to remove high-priority violative content, including child sexual abuse material and non-consensual nudity, taking appropriate action against accounts that violate our X rules. We also report accounts seeking child sexual exploitation materials to law enforcement authorities as necessary.”",

    "fullText": "Video game publisher to cancel Prince of Persia remake and close studios after several difficult years\n\nThe video game publisher behind the Assassin’s Creed series has cancelled six projects including a remake of Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time as it fights to stay competitive in the global gaming market.\n\nUbisoft announced a sweeping reorganisation and said it would cancel six games, sending its shares to their lowest level in more than a decade on Thursday.\n\nUbisoft is abandoning development of six titles, including a highly anticipated remake of Prince of Persia – a series that dates back to 1989 and received an ill-fated Hollywood adaptation in 2010 – and delaying a further seven. Studios in Halifax, Canada and Stockholm are being closed, with restructuring to follow in other countries, it said.\n\nAfter the announcement, Ubisoft’s shares fell by a third to their lowest level since 2011 on Thursday, valuing the company at €590m (£514m) compared with a peak of more than €10bn in the previous decade. The Paris-based company said it planned to split its operations into five creative divisions organised by genre, part of a broader attempt to sharpen focus and rein in costs after years of disappointing releases and weak results.\n\nThe company said the restructuring was driven by the competitive market for AAA games, the term for big-budget, high-profile titles such as Grand Theft Auto.\n\n“The triple-A industry has become persistently more selective and competitive with rising development costs and greater challenges in creating brands,” said Ubisoft’s founder and chief executive, Yves Guillemot.\n\nHowever, Guillemot added that successful triple-A games have “more financial potential than ever”.\n\nUbisoft also blamed an “increasingly competitive market” for shooters, a key genre for the industry.\n\nLaurent Michaud, a gaming industry economist, said action adventure titles such as Prince of Persia were out of step with a market dominated currently by shooters like Fortnite and Call of Duty, cooperative adventure titles such as Peak and sports titles and multiplayer games such as those available on the Roblox platform.\n\n“The expectations of gamers are quite different to where they were 10 years ago. That’s why it’s difficult to keep in touch with an audience that has changed so much over the years.”\n\nHe added: “Ubisoft is still one of the most popular content providers in the video games industry. It has developed one of the best IP slates in the industry but even if the games are really good, it is not enough. It has to meet people’s expectations and tastes.”\n\nThe latest overhaul follows several difficult years marked by game delays, cancellations and weak execution, which have eroded investor confidence and strained the group’s finances. In November 2025, Ubisoft postponed the publication of its half-year results at the last minute, triggering a week-long suspension of trading in its shares and bonds. The company later said an accounting change had revealed a breach of the terms for its debt.",

    "fullText": "There are no salary caps and no luxury taxes, yet the world’s most-watched soccer league is only getting more balanced\n\nDavid Stern used to tell a joke. In his early years as NBA commissioner, he liked to say, his job was essentially to travel back and forth between Boston and Los Angeles to hand out the championship trophy. In the first five NBA Finals after he took the helm in early 1984, the Celtics and Lakers won all five titles, each missing the decisive series just once.\n\nCurrent commissioner Adam Silver recalled the anecdote last June, ahead of the 2025 NBA Finals, by which time the league was guaranteed a seventh different champion in seven years. “We set out to create a system that allowed for more competition around the league,” Silver said then in his annual news conference. “The goal being to have 30 teams all in the position, if well managed, to compete for championships. And that’s what we’re seeing here.”\n\n“The goal isn’t necessarily to have a different champion every year,” Silver added. “It’s to have [...] parity of opportunity.”\n\nNFL commissioner Roger Goodell gave his own endorsement of competitive parity in 2011: “There are systems that we have to make sure that we maintain. When you come into a season, every fan thinks that their football team has a chance to win the Super Bowl.”\n\nWhen the Los Angeles Dodgers loaded up on talent yet again before the 2025 MLB season, seemingly fated to repeat as champions, commissioner Rob Manfred acknowledged that, “We certainly have owners in the game who are as concerned as fans are about the level of disparity in the game.”\n\nFor decades, the heads of American sports leagues have argued that parity is necessary to sustain fan interest and to stay financially sustainable. And they have manipulated the talent market in all sorts of ways – with salary caps, revenue sharing, drafts, wealth and talent redistribution, “aprons”, and so on – in service of that goal.\n\nYet the competitiveness of a league has no obvious bearing on its popularity. Baseball was never more popular than when the New York Yankees dominated it. The NBA’s cultural ascent coincided with the Celtics and Lakers’ decade-long duopoly, followed by the Chicago Bulls dynasty. Manchester United won the Premier League just about every year as the circuit became globally dominant.\n\nConcerned about sustainability? Don’t be. Professional teams that lost money often double as handy instruments to write off taxes for billionaires while the asset steadily appreciates anyway. To a cynic, parity has always felt like an excuse to short-change the players, a contrived cover for cost-controls and labor suppression.\n\nLately, the flaws in the parity principle have been delightfully illustrated by the Premier League, the sports world’s ongoing experiment to determine what happens when virtually no brakes are applied to runaway globalized capitalism. Past the halfway point of this season, just nine points separate fourth-place Liverpool from 15th-place Bournemouth. Sixth-place Newcastle are three points from 12th-place Everton. In sum, seven teams sit within the swing of a single game. Which is to say that with no parity mechanisms whatsoever, almost all the teams in the league are competitive.\n\nThey can’t all win the thing, exactly, but through an ever-evolving class of owners who treat their Premier League clubs as anything from vanity projects to investment vehicles to soft-power plays, a broad upper class and a huge middle class of teams have emerged.\n\nThe league’s largely unfettered economics – with the profitability and sustainability rules now tweaked to merely limit clubs to spending no more than 85 percent of their footballing earnings on their squads – practically require every club to spend at a competitive level every single season. This has caused a flattening of the talent level between many teams, and forced the smaller clubs to get smarter and better. In either case, the situation stands in stark contrast to the American system, in which many parasite teams allowed to feed off their more ambitious peers.\n\nMeanwhile, the Premier League’s 20 teams are trending towards more competitive balance. Liverpool’s 84-point title last season was the lowest haul since Leicester City’s fluky (if thrilling) championship in 2015-16, when all the habitual contenders happened to have an off-year at exactly the same time.\n\nMore tellingly, perhaps, is the uptick in the average points total of the middle third, give or take, of the Premier League table in the past four seasons and change. In 2021-22, the clubs who finished eighth through 13th averaged 49.5 points over the course of the campaign. That number ticked up by half a point over the next two seasons, before jumping to 54.7 in 2024-25. So far, 2025-26 is on pace to post a figure of 53.7, suggesting that something lasting may be shifting. (The 2020-21 season did produce a 54-point average, but that was a significant outlier to the three seasons before and after it.)\n\nCertainly, you could point out that this competitive balance may exist organically in the Premier League but eludes almost every other league in the world, save for Italy’s Serie A. But then the closest comparator to the Premier League in our little parity case study isn’t the European continent’s legacy soccer leagues. It’s the other best-in-class, globally popular circuits that dominate their sports: the NFL, the NBA and MLB.\n\nAt least a half-dozen Premier League teams, and as many as eight, have the resources to mount a plausible title challenge in any given season. That’s about a third of the league. Three-quarters of the top-tier clubs stand a reasonable chance of finishing in the top half or better.\n\nThat’s a kind of parity, too. Yet it was achieved without manipulating the market to the detriment of the players and, ultimately, the product.\n\nLeander Schaerlaeckens’ book on the United States men’s national soccer team, The Long Game, is out on 12 May.

    "description": "Olympic legend Katie Ledecky loves training. Her workout tips make it easier to exercise to build muscle, strength, and speed like an elite athlete.",
    "fullText": "One of the most decorated Olympians of all time said that after decades of training, she's still excited to work out.\n\nKatie Ledecky has earned 14 Olympic medals (nine of them gold) for her prowess in the pool. In events like the 800-meter freestyle, she's her own biggest competition, breaking her own world records in the quest for her personal best.\n\n\"I do really love the training,\" she told Business Insider. \"And I think because I love the training, it makes it very easy to go to practice every day and really continue to strive toward these big goals that I've set for myself.\"\n\nLedecky's training plan involves long hours in the pool, of course. But her dry-land workouts incorporate a mix of high-intensity circuits and weightlifting to build muscle.\n\n\"Swimming is a full-body exercise. So upper body strength, lower body strength, core strength, mobility, all those things are important,\" Ledecky said.\n\nThe gold medalist's approach can help you get the most out of your gym time even if you're not headed for the Olympics, with simple strategies to level up your workouts.\n\nA typical workout for Ledecky includes movements like cleans, squats, deadlifts, and pull-ups that help build explosive athleticism to stay ahead in the pool.\n\n\"Things like that translate well to developing power and pushing off the wall,\" she said.\n\nNon-swimmers can benefit, too: full-body exercises are one of the most efficient ways to build muscle, since you're working arms, legs, core, and back all at once. They can also improve mobility if you're training in a full range of motion.\n\nLedecky also incorporates circuit training with bike sprints and sled pushes. These shorter bursts of high-intensity exercise are great for improving your cardio fitness when you're short on time, and are linked to better longevity.\n\nLedecky has been swimming since she was six, and competed at her first Olympics (London 2012) at age 15.\n\nSince then, she's been to the Olympics three more times, dominating at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Games, in Tokyo 2020, and Paris 2024. She's also held multiple World Championship titles.\n\nThe training doesn't stop between big events. To stay focused leading up to international competitions, she said her approach is all about showing up to put in the work, over and over again.\n\n\"I've just always had a goal of consistency and I take it one year at a time, one day at a time,\" Ledecky said.\n\nFor everyday athletes, it's a good reminder to find a sustainable exercise routine. Personal trainers recommend starting small and building up over time, since exercise only works if you can keep doing it long enough to see results.\n\nLedecky said one of her favorite aspects of swimming is the intensely supportive community, from the youngest athletes who start at age six to the most elite competitors.\n\n\"It's seen very much as an individual sport, but I think many swimmers would say they couldn't do it without their team. There's such great camaraderie,\" she said.\n\nThat team spirit, encouragement, and playful rivalry among friends is what keeps Ledecky going through early-morning sessions in a cold pool and long hours of hard training.\n\nA good fitness community can make a big difference for everyday athletes, too — research shows you're more likely to stick to a workout plan and get results if you find a gym buddy (or many).\n\n\"It makes the motivation piece really easy when you know that you're in it with someone else,\" Ledecky said.\n\nFor peak performance, training is only part of the equation. Resting is crucial to allow the body to build back stronger. Ledecky has been competing for over a decade, and at 28 said she needs more recovery time than before.\n\n\"When I was 15, I don't remember ever feeling tired,\" she said. \"I'm definitely making sure that I'm getting extra sleep at night and getting naps in when I can.\"\n\nThe Olympian said she prioritizes getting enough sleep and eating a balanced diet (she loves a veggie omelet and has a partnership with egg brand Eggland's Best). The basic habits work better than an elaborate or high-tech protocol, according to Ledecky.\n\n\"It's not anything too crazy or too out there,\" she said. \"It's really just the simple things I think are the most important things.\"",

    "fullText": "First one-day international, R Premadasa Stadium, Colombo\n\nSri Lanka 271-6 (50 overs): K Mendis 93 (117), Liyange 46 (53); Rashid 3-44\n\nEngland 252 (49.2 overs): Duckett 62, Root 61; Madushan 3-39\n\nSri Lanka won by 19 runs, lead three-match series 1-0\n\nEngland changed formats and opponents, yet still followed their dismal Ashes campaign with defeat by Sri Lanka in the first one-day international in Colombo.\n\nOnly two weeks after the completion of their 4-1 series defeat in Australia, England were choked by the Sri Lanka spinners on a slow, low surface.\n\nSet a taxing 272 to win thanks to 93 not out from Kusal Mendis, the tourists were given a platform by a much-needed 62 from Ben Duckett and a typically classy 61 by Joe Root.\n\nBut both were out playing sweeps to the skilful Sri Lankans, and the required rate spiralled out of England's control.\n\nThe visitors lost eight wickets for 84 runs, including Harry Brook and Jacob Bethell both stumped.\n\nJamie Overton's hitting meant 20 were needed off the final over, but his miscue to cover left England 252 all out. The margin of 19 runs made the contest look closer than it was.\n\nEngland go 1-0 down in the three-match series, having now lost their last 11 ODIs away from home.\n\nThe second match of the series is at the same ground on Saturday.\n\nIn the aftermath of a high-stakes, high-intensity Ashes series, the contrast of a low-key tour of Sri Lanka could either be a welcome change for England, or an unwanted return to the grind.\n\nFive of England's Ashes squad were in the XI in Colombo. A sixth man, Will Jacks, would have played, only to be ruled out by illness. Brydon Carse is also in the squad.\n\nThere are consequences to this ODI series and the three T20s that follow. England need ODI wins to ensure automatic qualification for the 2027 World Cup, while the T20s are preparation for the World Cup in the shortest format next month.\n\nFor head coach Brendon McCullum, wins in the white-ball format may ease some of the pressure on his position. Captain Brook needs positive results on the field to move on from the controversy of being punched by a nightclub bouncer in Wellington.\n\nConditions that demand the bowling of and batting against spin are a historical weakness for England, and the task for the Ashes players was made all the harder given the switch from the pace and bounce of Australia.\n\nAfter the criticism of their preparation down under, England had only two training sessions in Colombo – this time no fault of their own because of the tight turnaround.\n\nThey can expect plenty more spin in the coming weeks. Their challenge is to adapt and improve quickly.\n\nA target of 272 was modest by the standards of modern ODIs, but well above par at this venue – only three times have more runs been chased to win a one-dayer on this ground.\n\nZak Crawley, playing his first ODI in more than two years, was out in familiar fashion – edging a drive at a wide one for only six, before Root and Duckett gave England a chance.\n\nDuckett looked horribly out of touch, swishing and swiping. The left-hander had 21 from the first 37 balls he faced, then found rhythm after two fours in the same over. This was his highest score in any cricket since the last Test against India in July.\n\nRoot, an expert in these conditions, was sublime, finding gaps and running hard. Still, even at 129-1, England were not fully in control.\n\nDuckett was lbw reverse-sweeping the leg-spin of Jeffrey Vandersay, Root leg before conventionally sweeping the off-spin of Dhananjaya da Silva delivered from round the wicket. England fell apart.\n\nSri Lanka found increasing turn, England found ways to get out. Brook ran past Chamira Asalanka to be stumped down the leg side and Bethell – who struggled to 15 off 32 balls – was stumped between bat and pad off left-armer Dunith Wellalage.\n\nAs England faltered, they were given some hope by Rehan Ahmed's 27, until he was brilliantly caught relay-style by Wellalage at long-off. Overton clubbed 34 from 17, though a heist never seemed likely.\n\nEngland named three frontline spinners - Jacks was replaced by Ahmed – and probably needed more. Bethell only bowled three overs of his left-arm spin, Root did not bowl at all.\n\nThe 33 overs of spin delivered by England was their second-most in an ODI. Adil Rashid was superb, dropping his pace for 3-44, while Liam Dawson managed 41 dots in his 1-31.\n\nCurran also impressed with his variations. At times he was almost bowling left-arm spin, and a 49mph 'moon ball' deceived Pathum Nissanka for England's first wicket.\n\nWhen Sri Lanka were 124-4, England had the opportunity to restrict the hosts, only for Mendis and Janith Liyanage to build a crucial partnership of 88, helped by some England errors in the field.\n\nLiyanage crunched two sixes in his 46, while wicketkeeper Mendis used all his experience and nous to hold the innings together. Time and again he showed deft touches to find the boundary behind square on the off side.\n\nWith Mendis as the fulcrum, Sri Lanka found 80 runs from the final 10 overs, an acceleration that would later prove beyond England.\n\nOverton's hit-the-deck style was entirely unsuitable to the surface and he went at more than seven an over.

    "description": "Los Blancos have once again been crowned the highest-revenue club in world football according to Deloitte",
    "fullText": "Real Madrid continue to operate in a financial stratosphere of their own. According to Deloitte’s latest Football Money League report, Los Blancos have once again been crowned the highest-revenue club in world football — and by a significant margin.\n\nFor the third consecutive year, the club tops Deloitte’s global ranking after generating €1.161 billion in revenue during the 2024–25 season. That figure represents a year-on-year increase of €115.5 million and places Real Madrid nearly €200 million ahead of second-placed Barcelona (€974.8m). It also puts them well clear of the Premier League’s financial heavyweights, with Liverpool the highest English club in fifth place on €836.1m.\n\nCrossing the €1.1 billion threshold further cements Real Madrid’s status as football’s dominant economic force. What makes the achievement even more striking is that it comes despite a season without major silverware on the pitch in 2023–24. While trophies remain the club’s ultimate objective, the numbers underline Madrid’s ability to thrive financially regardless of short-term sporting outcomes.\n\nDeloitte notes that football’s three primary revenue streams — commercial, broadcasting, and matchday income — all reached record levels across the industry. Real Madrid were uniquely positioned to take advantage of this growth, consolidating their place at the top of the global game.\n\nKey contributors included revenue generated through the operation of the renovated Santiago Bernabéu, alongside income from participation in elite competitions such as the Champions League and the Club World Cup.\n\nThe central pillar of Real Madrid’s financial dominance remains its commercial arm. According to Deloitte, the club’s commercial revenue increased by 23% over the previous season, fueled by stronger merchandising sales and the addition of new global commercial partners.\n\nThe scale of that growth is such that Real Madrid’s commercial revenue alone would be enough to rank the club inside the top ten of the Money League — a threshold currently occupied by Chelsea at €584.1m in total revenue. This commercial strength also helped Madrid absorb a 6% drop in matchday revenue, largely linked to fluctuations tied to stadium usage and scheduling.\n\nIn short, Real Madrid’s business model is no longer dependent on any single income stream. Instead, it is built on diversification, global reach, and the growing monetization of the Bernabéu as a multi-purpose venue.\n\nBelow is the full top-20 ranking from Deloitte’s report, highlighting just how far ahead Real Madrid currently stand:\n\nThe latest Money League figures reinforce a trend that has been developing for years: Real Madrid are not merely competing with Europe’s elite — they are financially separating from them (at least from a revenue standpoint). With sustained growth across commercial partnerships, global merchandising, and stadium-driven revenue, the club has set a benchmark few others appear capable of matching.\n\nAs football’s economic landscape continues to evolve, Deloitte’s report makes one thing clear: when it comes to revenue generation, Real Madrid are not just winning — they are redefining the scale of the game.",

    "fullText": "Inter are making significant strides toward a sensational return for Ivan Perisic, with negotiations already reaching an advanced stage.\n\nAccording to Alfredo Pedullà, the Croatian international has given his total approval to a move back to the San Siro. Discussions with Perisic’s entourage are well advanced as the Nerazzurri seek a reliable wide option to bolster Cristian Chivu’s squad, especially given the ongoing uncertainty surrounding Denzel Dumfries’ fitness. Questions have been raised about Luis Henrique’s abilities too.\n\nHowever, the timing of the deal hinges on PSV Eindhoven’s European journey. The Dutch side are currently in a delicate stretch of their campaign and will face Bayern Munich next Wednesday in a crucial Champions League clash. If PSV are eliminated from the competition, the path for Perisic’s departure is expected to clear immediately.\n\nThe 36-year-old’s desire to wear the Inter shirt again is the driving force behind the talks, and while the Italian giants remain respectful of PSV’s current commitments, an exit from Europe for the Eredivisie club could bring the transfer to life in the final days of the window.",

    "description": "In a World Economic Forum panel moderated by Business Insider, robotics experts dove into how bots are going to change the world.",
    "fullText": "In a world of AI chatbots and agents, we're not talking enough about physical AI.\n\nAt a Thursday morning Davos panel moderated by Business Insider's Jamie Heller, robotics experts dived into ways bots are going to change the world — and their key limitations.\n\nHere are three takeaways from the World Economic Forum panel, which featured robotics and automation experts and a trade minister:\n\nOne phrase dominated the conversation: digital twins.\n\nExecutives from Siemens, Agility Robotics, and Automation Anywhere agreed that what once sounded like a distant possibility is now delivering real productivity gains for companies.\n\nA digital twin is a digital replica of a physical object, person, or process. They can help organizations simulate real situations and their outcomes, allowing them to make better decisions.\n\n\"Digital twins have been around, but the technology has exponentially improved, and the computing power has exponentially improved,\" said Automation Anywhere CEO Mihir Shukla.\n\nHe added, \"Let's say digital twins tell you that there is going to be a problem in manufacturing. You can proactively act on it. It has implications on your inventory. It has implications on your shipping planning.\"\n\nSiemens' CEO Roland Busch said that the productivity boost is showing up in numbers.\n\nHe said that the company's output is 20% higher and that energy costs are 20% lower.\n\n\"You have much, much faster and ramping up, you don't make mistakes,\" if you use a digital twin, he said.\n\nRobots can do work that humans are unable to — or don't want to — do, said Peggy Johnson, the CEO of Agility Robotics.\n\n\"It's very hard to hire for these manual jobs,\" she said. \"They're dull and dirty, and they're dangerous at times because you're lifting over and over again, very repetitive. It's kind of mind-numbing work.\"\n\nFaster progress in robotics means a better quality of life for the humans who are doing such jobs.\n\n\"The injuries are also another thing,\" she said about jobs that require a lot of heavy lifting. \"We have an aging workforce. A lot of young kids don't want to go into environments like this. So the older employees are also getting hurt more.\"\n\nThani Ahmed Al Zeyoudi, the Minister of Foreign Trade for the United Arab Emirates, echoed that robotics was the future of \"non-skilled\" labor.\n\n\"It's too difficult to attract new young people to start working on the construction,\" he said. \"Robotics is the main solution.\"\n\nBut building robots that are safe to use in human environments is also key, Johnson said.\n\nAl Zeyoudi added that financing AI is only the first step toward AI integration.\n\n\"Sometimes you have the money, but you haven't diagnosed the right solution to the problem that you're having,\" he said.\n\nHe said that the UAE's push for AI includes government appointments, policy development, and research and development, which was the \"main game changer.\"\n\n\"Many, many stakeholders are avoiding that because they say someone else will do it,\" he said, referring to R&D. \"I'll just copy and paste it.\"\n\n\"But when it comes to AI, it's too late,\" Al Zeyoudi added. \"You have to start working on R&D because you ensure to customize things to your own ecosystem, your own environments, your own conditions.\"",

    "description": "Business Insider is tracking what the fight over the future of capitalism means for your work, your wealth, and your world.",
    "fullText": "From Davos to Washington to America's high school classrooms, people are questioning the foundations of our economic system — and we at Business Insider are tracking what the fight over the future of capitalism means for your work, your wealth, and your world.\n\nPolls show Americans' trust in capitalism is falling fast, as daily life has grown more expensive and less secure. Our own recent survey of readers found that people are worried their wages aren't keeping up with their expenses, that housing feels out of reach, and that the whole system seems shaky. Many employers are leaning even more heavily into a capitalistic approach, deemphasizing loyalty and tenure in favor of ruthless meritocracy. Meanwhile, the US government has taken a more hands-on role in the economy, becoming a shareholder in several companies and upending its place in the capitalist system.\n\nAs questions about the state of capitalism grow, leaders are pitching competing visions of the economy's future. President Trump told a room full of CEOs, executives, and media figures at Davos this week that the US is reshaping the rules to make sure the country comes out of this period of transition \"bigger and better than before.\" Some are pushing for reform, like California governor Gavin Newsom, who called for a \"rules-based, competitive\" model at Davos. Others, like New York City's self-described socialist mayor Zohran Mamdani, want to rethink the system from the ground up — and have a lot of voters on board.\n\nWhile capitalism's future hangs in the balance, Business Insider is digging in. We're exploring how and why the system is being reshaped — by government policy, by companies, and by you.\n\nTell us what you think about the future of capitalism. Test your own understanding. And stick with us as we track how this system is evolving in real time, and what it will look like next.",

    "fullText": "For decades, McDonald's customers have complained that the fast-food giant reserves its most fun and innovative menu items for international markets, leaving its home country with the same predictable seasonal releases.\n\nAs frustrating as that may seem, there is a deliberate strategy behind this madness.\n\nMcDonald's tailors its menu in each country based on cultural preferences, ingredient availability, and what can be executed efficiently at scale. The same applies to limited-time and seasonal items.\n\nWhile menus vary around the world, a small set of core products remains consistent, including the World Famous Fries, the classic Hamburger and Cheeseburger, the Big Mac, McNuggets, and the Vanilla Cone.\n\nThis localization strategy reduces operational risk and improves return on investment, which is why each country maintains its own lineup with exclusive offerings.\n\nHistorically, McDonald's has taken a cautious approach to bringing international items to the U.S., testing them selectively and tailoring availability based on regional preferences and past performance. In most cases, localized items had stayed local.\n\nMcDonald's has revealed an entire lineup of international menu items coming to U.S. restaurants nationwide in 2026, marking one of the company's most ambitious cross-market rollouts in years.\n\nHere is the full list, with all items set to launch within the next few days.\n\nMcDonald's (MCD) first introduced its Hot Honey Sauce in Australia in March 2025, aiming to capitalize on what it described as \"the hottest trend everyone is talking about,\" according to a company press release. The sauce was later rolled out in New Zealand and Canada, each for a limited-time run.\n\nNow, less than a year later, it is headed to the U.S.\n\nThe Hot Honey Sauce blends honey with red bell peppers and cayenne peppers, finished with a hint of tangy vinegar. Alongside it, McDonald's is debuting three new menu items featuring the trendy sauce.\n\nHot Honey Bacon McCrispy: A crispy chicken filet topped with thick-cut applewood smoked bacon, crispy jalapeños, shredded lettuce, creamy mayo, and Hot Honey Sauce, served on a toasted potato roll \n\nHot Honey Snack Wrap: A McCrispy Strip topped with shredded cheese, shredded lettuce, and Hot Honey Sauce, all wrapped in a tortilla \n\nHot Honey Sausage Egg Biscuit: A pork sausage patty and a folded egg, topped with Hot Honey Sauce, on a biscuit brushed with real butter \n\nThe Hot Honey Sauce and all three new menu items will be available for a limited time beginning January 27 at participating U.S. locations and can be added to any menu item, according to the Snackolator Instagram page.\n\nAlthough the new products have not officially launched, they already appear on the McDonald's website.\n\nThe Big Arch burger debuted in Portugal in July 2024 and quickly gained traction, prompting McDonald's to expand it into Canada, Germany, Australia, the UK, Ireland, and France.\n\nDuring an earnings call in mid-2024, McDonald's acknowledged the burger's strong performance and universal appeal, which led it to accelerate its expansion.\n\n\"The pilot of our larger burger offering, Big Arch, now in three international markets, Portugal, Germany, and Canada, shows that we're listening to consumer tastes and delivering,\" said McDonald’s CEO Chris Kempczinski in the earnings call.\n\n\"We'll work with franchisees and partners to deploy the Big Arch faster into more international markets in 2025.\"\n\nFollowing its positive reception abroad, McDonald's tested the Big Arch in the U.S. at its headquarters restaurant in Chicago for a limited time.\n\nThis massive burger features two quarter-pounder patties, three slices of white cheese, crispy onions, slivered onions, pickles, lettuce, and Big Arch Sauce, all sandwiched between a sliced sesame and poppy seed bun.\n\nWhile the Double Quarter Pounder comes close, it's not the same. McDonald's is positioning the Big Arch as a more premium, value-driven option.\n\nIn Canada, a Big Arch meal costs about $12.59, or roughly $9 in the U.S. Despite the higher price, the company says the burger delivers greater value, an increasingly important selling point as consumers grow more cautious of their spending.\n\nMcDonald's credits the Big Arch as a key traffic driver in several markets, helping boost global comparable sales by nearly 4% year over year in the second quarter of fiscal 2025.\n\nAfter extensive testing, the Big Arch will make its nationwide U.S. debut in early March 2026, according to The Street.\n\nLike much of the fast-food industry, McDonald's has faced mounting pressure in recent years, particularly in the U.S. Slower foot traffic, rising food costs, and weaker spending have weighed on results.\n\nPrices for food at home increased 2.6%, while prices for food away from home rose 3.7% in the 12 months ended September 2025, according to recent U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data.\n\nMcDonald's making major drive-thru change\n\nMcDonald’s expected to bring back beloved childhood favorite in 2026\n\nFive Guys debuts alcohol and all-day breakfast\n\nDuring the quarter ending June 2025, foodservice traffic declined 1%, as consumers dined out less frequently, according to Circana. However, value menu traffic rose 1%, marking the first positive growth in three years.\n\nCircana also found that value-focused diners are 33% more likely than non-value buyers to purchase value menu items when visiting other restaurant chains, underscoring how aggressively consumers are hunting for savings and deals.\n\nIn response to consumers' cautious spending, McDonald's has rolled out several value-focused initiatives, including the Extra Value Meals, McValue menu, and $5 Meal Deals.\n\nIn March 2025, the company launched the Restaurant Experience Team, combining operations, supply chain, franchising, development, restaurant design, delivery, and Speedee Labs to drive innovation and efficiency. It also created three new global Category Management teams focused on beef, chicken, and beverages/desserts to further specialize innovation within its food products.\n\n“Value is rarely defined only by price,” said Circana Senior VP and Industry Advisor for Food and Foodservice David Portalatin in a statement. “Operational excellence in providing quality, affordability, great experiences, and convenience is what leads winning restaurants and their supply chain partners to greater success.”\n\nThose efforts are beginning to pay off. In the third quarter of fiscal 2025, U.S. comparable sales increased 2.4%.\n\nDespite improvement, McDonald's remains cautious.\n\n\"We continue to remain cautious about the health of the consumer in the U.S. and our top international markets and believe the pressures will continue well into 2026,\" said McDonald's CEO Christopher J. Kempczinski in an earnings call.\n\n\"It’s a foundational expectation of our brand to bring consumers through our doors and keep them coming back.\"",

    "fullText": "The Supreme Court heard arguments on Wednesday regarding President Donald Trump’s move to fire Federal Reserve Board Governor Lisa D. Cook, with whom the court appeared likely to side.\n\nThe New York Times’s Ann E. Marimow summed up the arguments before the court and reported that “justices from across the ideological spectrum questioned whether the allegations President Trump lodged against Ms. Cook — an unproven assertion that she engaged in mortgage fraud before taking office — were serious enough to allow the president to fire her.”\n\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh, a Trump appointee, offered some of the most skeptical questions to Trump Solicitor General D. John Sauer.\n\nKavanaugh went so far during his questioning to suggest that if the court found in Trump’s favor, it would mean the president could fire all independent agency officials “at-will” – ending the “for cause” legal requirement.\n\nKavanaugh argued “the current president’s appointees would likely be removed for cause on January 20, 2029 if there’s a Democrat president…then we’re really at-will removal.”\n\nBelow is a transcript of that exchange:\n\nKavanaugh: For present purposes, you accept the constitutionality of the for-cause removal provision for the Federal Reserve, and that is what protects the independence of the Federal Reserve. What, in your view, is the purpose of that independence?\n\nSauer: It protects the governors. Exactly reflecting the plain text of the statute, it protects the governors from removal for policy disagreement or for no reason at all.\n\nKavanaugh: What is the broader purpose of that?\n\nSauer: To preserve the independence of the Federal Reserve.\n\nKavanaugh: And what is the broader purpose of that?\n\nSauer: Well, there are a number of reasons that are discussed by the amici, and I think not disputed by us, which is that there is, you know, a long tradition of having this exercise of monetary policy be exercised independent of, you know, executive influence, and we don’t dispute that that’s what Congress was doing in that statute. And again, we are not disputing the validity of the for-cause removal restriction here.\n\nKavanaugh: And why is that independence important in your view?\n\nSauer: We don’t dispute the importance of that for many of the reasons that the amici say, but we emphasize that there’s a balance struck here. This is not an ironclad “you can never be removed.” There is a cause removal authorization.\n\nKavanaugh: But on that, in your position that there’s no judicial review, no process required, no remedy available, very low bar for cause that the president alone determines—that would weaken, if not shatter, the independence of the Federal Reserve that we just discussed.\n Sauer: We disagree with that, and I would point to the point you made that this is a low bar for cause. In a sense, it’s a very high bar.\n\nIt is a very strong protection, because it does protect them from the one thing that Congress was apparently most worried about, which is—\n Kavanaugh: But it would be in the view of the president—the president who might have a policy disagreement—and there’s no judicial review, and the president can just define it on his or her own.\n\nSauer: One of the strongest traditions in this court’s jurisprudence is the sort of presumption of regularity to the president’s actions that has applied to this provision, I think, effectively for 112 years, and it continues to do so.\n\nKavanaugh: Let’s talk about the real-world downstream effects of this. Because if this were set as a precedent, it seems to me, just thinking big picture, what goes around comes around. All of the current president’s appointees would likely be removed for cause on January 20, 2029, if there’s a Democratic president, or January 20, 2033. And then we’re really at at-will removal. So what are we doing here? What is—you know, we started—that’s why I started with what’s the purpose of the independence and the for-cause removal. If we accept all these—no procedure, no judicial review, no remedy—you know, that’s what’s going to happen, I think. And then where are we? So do you dispute that that is, you know, the real-world effect?\n\nSauer: I can’t predict what future presidents may or may not do, but the argument strikes me as a policy argument.\n\nKavanaugh: Well, history is a pretty good guide. Once these tools are unleashed, they are used by both sides, and usually more the second time around. And I think that’s what we have to make sure we’re—again, that can’t drive the decision necessarily. We have to be aware of what we’re doing and the consequences of your position for the structure of the government.\n\nWatch the clip above via C-SPAN.\n\nThe post Kavanaugh Warns ‘What Goes Around Comes Around’ If Court Lets Trump Have ‘At-Will Removal’ Power first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "As the Ukraine-Russia drone arms race rages, hobbyists far from the war are pushing the limit for how quickly these small quadcopters can fly.\n\nA father-son duo in South Africa set a new Guinness World Record by reaching a ground speed of 408 mph with their custom, battery-powered remote-controlled quadcopter, the Peregreen V4.\n\nLuke and Mike Bell performed the record-breaking flight on December 11, 2025, the Guinness World Records organization said in a statement in January.\n\nWhile drones built for war are constrained by additional factors, the Bells' achievement expands the possibilities of how these devices might one day perform on the battlefield.\n\nIt also lays bare how accessible new war-relevant technology is becoming for civilians. The Bells documented their design and build process on YouTube, filming themselves using a 3D printer and off-the-shelf parts to create the Peregreen V4.\n\nTheir drone's design features a dome-shaped head and four propellers extending from the lower body — much like many of the interceptor drones available on the Ukrainian market today.\n\nThese drones, developed primarily as a low-cost way of countering Russian Shahed-type loitering munitions, have become a pillar of Ukrainian air defense.\n\nSome of the fastest interceptors available to Ukrainian forces can reach 200 mph, which is also the typical velocity of a bullet train.\n\nUkrainians are trying to push their quadcopters to fly even faster. Flight speed is key for these interceptors because they're designed to chase and crash into Shaheds, and Russia has been continually ramping up the speeds of its attack drones.\n\nThe Geran-2, a Shahed-type drone that Russia launches more commonly, can carry an explosive warhead for hundreds of miles at top speeds of 115 mph. Newer, jet-powered versions of Shaheds are estimated to fly up to 230 mph in some conditions.\n\nA major issue with faster drones is that their components tend to overheat when pushed to the limit — whether it's the propeller motors, wiring, or batteries.\n\nIn their YouTube videos, the Bells repeatedly recorded their drone or its individual parts catching fire during tests.\n\nDrone makers also have to juggle other design factors, such as the drone's aerodynamics and propeller efficiency.\n\nUkrainian war manufacturers face additional constraints: Their drones need to carry an additional payload — often 200 grams to 1 kg of explosives. They must also be maneuverable enough to pivot and catch a flying enemy target, and be mass-produced.\n\nEarlier this month, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said his country was already producing 1,000 interceptor drones a day.\n\nMeanwhile, the Bells' flight record involved a single drone that flew largely in a straight line.\n\nThe duo's latest certification is the third time they've attained the fastest-drone record. The previous holder of the achievement was Australian drone maker Ben Biggs, who built a drone that reached 389 mph late last year.\n\nBefore Biggs' record, the Bells' earlier quadcopter, the Peregreen V3, had flown at up to roughly 363 mph in the summer of 2025.\n\nIn 2024, the pair set a record of 298 mph with a similar drone design.\n\nGuinness World Records requires aspiring drone record-breakers to fly their device in two opposing directions and then calculate the average speed to account for wind.",

This ate into the president’s schedule and whittled away the notoriously light sleeper’s opportunity for some shut-eye.\n\nThe president swapped planes back in the capital and continued his journey, heavily delayed, to Switzerland. His second departure, just after midnight, is thought to have added a further three hours to his journey.\n\nTrump, 79, emerged from the second plane in Zurich on Wednesday morning looking frazzled, before slowly descending the stairs. Despite the setback, the president still made it in time to address world leaders in Davos, though his voice sounded hoarse and he appeared to have bags under his eyes.\n\nCNN White House Correspondent Alayna Treene reported that her colleague, frequent Trump target Kaitlan Collins, said his Chief of Staff Susie Wiles relayed the message that the president would be moving away from international travel to tour U.S. cities ahead of November midterms.\n\nWiles told the press pool that Trump’s new intinerary will begin in Iowa on Tuesday, where the president will give a speech on the economy. He will then visit a new destination “every week,” Bloomberg reported, citing Wiles.\n\nIt’s part of an attempt to reverse poor marks on affordability, a main concern of voters that Trump has sought to dismiss as a “hoax” cooked up by Democrats.\n\nTrump’s domestic charm offensive kicked off in Michigan last week. He toured Ford’s River Rouge complex in Dearborn on Tuesday afternoon before delivering a speech at the Detroit Economic Club.\n\nHowever, it got off to a contentious start as Trump appeared to flip off a person heard calling him a “pedophile protector” during his visit to the vehicle plant. According to footage of the confrontation, Trump appeared to point at the accuser as he said, “f*** you,” and then gave the person the middle finger as he walked away.\n\nThat followed another speech in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania, last month, where Trump rambled about the brazen U.S. capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro and called the affordability issue a “hoax” twice.\n\nHis focus frustrated senior White House officials and Republican lawmakers who want the administration to emphasize economic and healthcare concerns, three people familiar with internal discussions told Reuters.\n\nThe White House has been asked to comment on Trump’s revamped travel schedule.",

    "fullText": "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — The astronauts evacuated last week from the International Space Station say a portable ultrasound machine came in “super handy” during the medical crisis.\n\nDuring their first public appearance since returning to Earth, the four astronauts refused Wednesday to say which one of them needed medical attention and for what reason. It was NASA's first medical evacuation in 65 years of human spaceflight.\n\nNASA’s Mike Fincke said the crew used the onboard ultrasound machine once the medical problem arose Jan. 7, the day before a planned spacewalk that was abruptly canceled. The astronauts had already used the device a lot for routine checks of their body changes while living in weightlessness, “so when we had this emergency, the ultrasound machine came in super handy.”\n\nIt was so useful that Fincke said there should be one on all future spaceflights. “It really helped,” he said.\n\n“Of course, we didn't have other big machines that we have here on planet Earth,” he added. “We do try to make sure that everybody before we fly are really, really not prone to surprises. But sometimes things happen and surprises happen, and the team was ready ... preparation was super important.\"\n\nThe space station is set up as well as it can be for medical emergencies, said NASA's Zena Cardman, who commanded the crew's early return flight with SpaceX. She said NASA “made all the right decisions” in canceling the spacewalk, which would have been her first, and prioritizing the crew's well-being.\n\nJapanese astronaut Kimiya Yui said he was surprised how well all the preflight training paid off in dealing with the health concerns.\n\n“We can handle any kind of difficult situation,” Yui said. “This is actually very, very good experience for the future of human spaceflight.”\n\nJoining them on what turned out to be a 5 1/2-month mission — more than a month shorter than planned — was Russia's Oleg Platonov. They launched last August from Florida and splashed down in the Pacific off the San Diego coast last week.\n\nWelcoming them back to Houston were their replacements, who aren't due to launch until mid-February. NASA and SpaceX are working to move up the flight.\n\n“We were hoping to give them hugs in space, but we gave them hugs on Earth,” Fincke said.\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

    "fullText": "Las Vegas Darts Open: Brandon Claims Open as Hedman defends women's title originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nLas Vegas has a habit of exaggerating things. Lights brighter. Nights longer. Legends larger. And on the oche, beneath the neon glare of The Strip, Deta Hedman once again reminded the darts world that class doesn’t age – it sharpens.\n\nNorth America is becoming more a centre of focus for the World Darts Federation with every passing year. A glance at the rankings will confirm the growing influence of USA events and, in turn, dominance of their players. But they would not get it all their own way as the season started again after a festive breather.\n\nThe Open event brought a distinctly American flavour, and the final proved brutally one-sided. Tennessee thrower Jason Brandon turned the dial to demolition mode, whitewashing compatriot Alex Spellman 6-0 with an average nudging just past the 90 mark. Spellman never found his footing. Brandon never loosened his grip. Sometimes, finals end before they begin.\n\nFresh into 2026 and the reigning WDF Women’s World Championship holder picked up exactly where she left off, rolling into Nevada and rolling straight back into the winner’s circle by lifting the Winmau Las Vegas Open crown. At 66 years young, the Queen of Darts remains ruthlessly efficient, brushing aside America’s Cali West 5-2 in the final to add yet another major WDF trophy to an already overflowing cabinet.\n\nDETA STRIKES 10 DART LEG: Watch Vegas highlight from the World Champion\n\nThis wasn’t nostalgia. This wasn’t sentiment. This was elite darts, delivered with the calm authority of someone who has seen every trend come and go – and outlasted them all. In a city built on excess, Hedman’s dominance felt beautifully understated. Just sharp scoring, clinical doubles, and the unmistakable presence of a champion who still belongs at the very top of the World Darts Federation pyramid.\n\nBut Las Vegas is never about just one event. The weekend unfolded like a darts buffet – singles, doubles, cricket, youth tournaments – boards buzzing from morning through to whatever hour Vegas pretends is night. And naturally, Hedman wasn’t done.\n\nMore silverware followed in the doubles, where she paired with Anca Zijlstra to overcome Japan’s Kosuzu Iwao and Shiori Sato. Another medal. Another reminder that Hedman’s influence stretches across formats, continents and generations.\n\nThe Stars and Stripes flew again in the Open Doubles as Brandon Perez and Marko Silva edged out Canada’s Jayson Barlow and David Cameron in a tight North American showdown.\n\nThere are far worse places to spend a weekend throwing darts than Las Vegas. Fewer still where the trophies pile up, the WDF banner flies proudly, and legends like Deta Hedman continue to turn neon-lit stages into personal property.\n\nFor the full stories and \n\nDarts World subscriptions options include Print, Digital and All Access packages, as well as exclusive products and competitions",

    "description": "Business leaders and CEOs weighed in on President Donald Trump's highly anticipated speech at the World Economic Forum on Wednesday.",
    "fullText": "Business leaders such as Ken Griffin and Matthew Prince have already weighed in on President Donald Trump's highly anticipated speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.\n\nTrump said on Wednesday that he will not use force to get Greenland, but is \"seeking immediate negotiations to once again discuss the acquisition\" by the US.\n\nTrump's ongoing threats against Europe over his desire to take over Greenland have been dominating this year's Davos agenda.\n\nAll eyes were on Trump during his 70-minute-long speech, with billionaire CEOs — including Apple's Tim Cook and Salesforce's Marc Benioff — alongside heads of state filling up Congress Hall to hear what he had to say.\n\nHere is how some of the world's biggest business leaders have reacted:\n\nSpeaking on CNBC's Squawk Box on Wednesday, Citadel's CEO and founder Ken Griffin said Trump had an \"important message to deliver to a European audience that, bluntly, needs to do better. Europe's economic growth lags far behind America.\"\n\n\"The commitment of the American people to defend our country runs deep. The commitment of the Europeans to defend their countries — if you look at surveys of the population — is not nearly as strong,\" he added.\n\nGriffin said he thought one of Trump's \"important foundational statements he made with respect to the justification why the US needs unfettered access to Greenland\" was whether Europe would be there for the US if there was another war.\n\nHowever, Griffin said that if the US does decide to \"pursue this path\", discussions \"should take time and be thoughtfully laid out.\"\n\n\"Investors around the world do not want to see an escalation of the stress in global trade that has played out over the last 12 months,\" the Citadel CEO added.\n\nPeter Schiff, the chief economist at Euro Pacific Asset Management, said it looked like \"cooler heads prevailed at the White House.\"\n\n\"So if the US can't buy Greenland instead of taking it by military force, Trump will just hold a grudge,\" Schiff, whose firm managed $1.4 billion last year, wrote on X.\n\n\"While that is a major improvement, it also means that if we do succeed in buying Greenland, we'll massively overpay.\"\n\nSchiff also warned on X that a housing \"crash is coming.\"\n\n\"Trump basically admitted there is a housing bubble in the US. He also admitted his main policy goal is to prevent it from popping,\" Schiff wrote.\n\n\"But once you recognize a bubble, the worst thing you can do is try to sustain it. The sooner it bursts, the less damage it will ultimately cause.\"\n\nCloudflare's CEO appears to have commented on Trump's speech style.\n\n\"Last two times Trump spoke at Davos he stuck extremely close to the teleprompter. Not this time,\" Prince wrote on X.\n\nSpeaking on CNBC's Money Movers on Wednesday, the founder and executive chair of investment bank Moelis & Company, Ken Moelis, said he thought Trump \"made a very good case\" for a deal over Greenland.\n\n\"There was a real sigh of relief that he took military action off the table with Greenland. With President Trump, it's unusual for him to ever take an option off the table, so that was a big sigh of relief,\" he said.\n\nMoelis described Greenland as \"probably the biggest M&A deal in the history of the world\" and criticized Europe's approach to energy policy.\n\n\"You have to look at Europe and say their choices on energy policy have put them in the position they're in right now which is fairly weak economically and in a global position. And I thought he made a very good case for that,\" he said.",

    "description": "President Donald Trump used his Davos address to press for US control of Greenland, defend tariffs, and frame global politics as a contest of power.",
    "fullText": "It was a speech that was never going to fly under the radar.\n\nPresident Donald Trump used his Davos address on Wednesday to press his case for US control of Greenland, criticize what he described as Europe's economic decline, and outline a series of domestic and global policy priorities — from tariffs and credit card rates to the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe speech came after Trump's flight to Davos was delayed following a midair turnaround of Air Force One due to a \"minor electrical issue\" and a transatlantic flight on a backup jet.\n\nIt also came amid mounting backlash from European leaders, rattled markets, and warnings of retaliation that could hit America's biggest economic advantages.\n\nHere are the four biggest takeaways from Trump's remarks:\n\nTrump devoted a significant portion of his speech to Greenland, saying that the US does not plan to use military force and adding that no other country can secure the territory.\n\n\"I don't have to use force. I don't want to use force. I won't use force, Trump said.\"\n\nAt the same time, he framed US control of Greenland as essential to global security and openly criticized America's allies.\n\n\"All the United States is asking for is a place called Greenland,\" Trump said.\n\n\"No nation or a group of nations is in any position to be able to secure Greenland other than the United States.\"\n\nTrump said US ownership would benefit NATO, even as he questioned the alliance's reliability.\n\n\"This would greatly enhance the security of the entire NATO alliance,\" he said, adding: \"We want strong allies, not seriously weakened ones.\"\n\nTrump repeatedly returned to tariffs as a central tool of leverage, describing them as a way to get other countries to change behavior.\n\n\"Instead of raising taxes on domestic producers, we're lowering them and raising tariffs on foreign nations,\" Trump said.\n\nHe added that tariffs have enabled him to secure concessions that would not have been possible otherwise.\n\n\"Without tariffs, I wouldn't have been able to get it done,\" he said.\n\nAt one point, he described his negotiating style in blunt terms, telling the audience that when tariffs are on the table, the message to other countries is simple: \"You're going to do it fast.\"\n\nTrump used some of his most emotive language when discussing energy policy, particularly renewable power.\n\nHe dismissed green policies as \"the Green New Scam\" in reference to the EU's Green New Deal and called it \"perhaps the greatest hoax in history,\" adding that wind turbines ruin landscapes while losing money.\n\n\"Windmills all over the place destroy your land,\" Trump said.\"Stupid people buy them.\"\n\nHe also accused China of profiting from renewable energy by manufacturing windmills for export while relying on other energy sources at home, suggesting Beijing sells green technology it does not fully embrace itself.\n\nTrump said that parts of Europe have declined economically and politically — without naming specific cities or countries.\n\n\"Certain places in Europe are not even recognizable anymore,\" he said, adding that the changes were \"not in a positive way.\"\n\nHe blamed European governments for weakening themselves through energy and economic policy.\n\n\"They're destroying themselves,\" Trump said of European countries.\n\nAt the same time, he positioned the US as the central force in the global economy and security.\n\n\"The USA is the economic engine on the planet,\" he said. \"When America booms, the entire world booms.\"\n\n\"I'm working every day to ensure our military is very powerful. Our borders are very strong. And above all, our economy is strong because national security requires economic security and economic prosperity,\" he added.",

    "description": "Ken Griffin, CEO of Citadel, weighed in on how Trump's economic and geopolitical policies have impacted the US during the World Economic Forum.",
    "fullText": "Hours before President Donald Trump's highly anticipated speech at the World Economic Forum, Ken Griffin, the outspoken billionaire CEO of Citadel, gave his rundown of the US leader's key economic policies.\n\nTrump's tariffs have been \"a negative\" and have left the US economy in a \"pretty unfortunate position,\" said Griffin at the World Economic Forum on Wednesday.\n\nThe president's policy to raise tariffs on imports to the US has \"disrupted long-standing trading relationships\" and led to \"higher inflation,\" said Griffin.\n\n\"We've obviously increased the amount of cronyism in America as corporate CEOs have lined up in Washington trying to argue why their business should be exempted from tariffs, and many have prevailed,\" he added.\n\nCentral to Trump's tariff agenda is the promise that manufacturing will return to America, reducing US dependency on foreign nations for critical items.\n\n\"We have yet to bring manufacturing jobs back to the United States,\" said Griffin.\n\nThe Citadel CEO highlighted that Trump is clearly following through on the platform he was elected on and said that tariffs have had some of their intended effects, though he did not specify what these were.\n\nBut one of the main problems with US tariffs is that business leaders are uncertain about how long the policy will stay in place.\n\n\"I think people have a very hard time believing that the current tariff regime's going to persist,\" said Griffin. \"Before you spend hundreds of millions of dollars or billions of dollars to build a manufacturing plan, you really want to believe that the policy that is the anchor of that decision will be permanent in nature.\"\n\nGriffin also gave his two cents on Trump's immigration and geopolitical policies.\n\nNo country's borders should be open to mass immigration, but closing down the Southern border has meant losing a large supply of labor, said Griffin.\n\n\"These are people who did a lot of very, very difficult work, very modest wages, which helped to reduce the level of inflation in the United States,\" he said, adding that he expected housing and food prices to rise in the coming years as a result.\n\nThe bigger problem that Trump's immigration policy has caused for the US is that \"we're potentially losing access to the best and brightest minds from around the world,\" said Griffin.\n\n\"The majority of Silicon Valley is either run by immigrants or children of immigrants,\" he said, and their companies have created \"a tremendous number of jobs in the United States.\"\n\nSpeaking ahead of Trump's speech at Davos on Wednesday, Griffin said he was uncertain about what the US president was hoping to achieve by clashing with Europe over ownership of Greenland: \"What I can't understand is why are we fighting over a piece of rock covered by ice?\"\n\n\"We have frayed our relationship with our European allies in ways that I don't understand or appreciate, but there is a push here to get Europe to step up,\" said Griffin.\n\nDuring his speech, Trump ruled out using force to acquire Greenland, but said that he wants \"right, title, and ownership\" of the nation.",

There are two guys that can prove it.\"\n\nAmerican players each received $500,000 (£373,000) from organisers the PGA of America to compete in last year's defeat at Bethpage, making it the first time in the Ryder Cup's 98-year history that players on either side had been paid to play.\n\nHowever, some of the players said during the event in New York that they would donate their earnings to charity.\n\nWhile several of the world's top golfers were lured to LIV, Northern Ireland's McIlroy remained loyal to the DP World Tour and US-based PGA Tour.\n\n\"I think any organisation or any members' organisation like this has a right to uphold its rules and regulations,\" added the reigning Masters champion.\n\n\"What the DP World Tour is doing is upholding its rules and regulations. We, as members, sign a document at the start of every year, which has you agree to these rules and regulations.\n\n\"The people that made the option to go to LIV knew what they were.
