    "fullText": "Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship and Bare Knuckle Fight League are making their official entry into India, marking a significant expansion into one of the world’s largest combat sports markets.\n\nThe move is being spearheaded by World League of Fighters, BKFC’s license holder, which is co-founded by Rajesh Banga, Sunil Mathew and Siraj Gill. The organization has brought in prominent film producer Parag Sanghvi and Bollywood star and martial artist Tiger Shroff to join the board alongside BKFC founder and president David Feldman and former two-division UFC champion Conor McGregor, who became a part-owner of BFKC in 2024.\n\nMiss Universe Harnaaz Sandhu Joins Tiger Shroff, Sanjay Dutt in 'Baaghi 4' - Global Bulletin\n\nNetflix, Amazon Prime, ZEE5, SonyLIV Vie for India's IFFI Streaming Honor - Global Bulletin\n\nFox Orders Lifeguard Drama Series 'Rescue: Hi-Surf' from Producer John Wells (TV News Roundup)\n\nWLF previously delivered a sold-out BKFC event in Dubai last year, which the organization describes as the biggest bare-knuckle fighting event held in the Middle East.\n\nThe India expansion will introduce a team-based bare-knuckle league format – marking the first time such a structure has been implemented in the history of the sport. The format will feature six inaugural teams: Crushers, Punishers, Warriors, Phantoms, Gladiators and Infernos, transforming individual fights into a franchise-based competition.\n\nRahul Saxena has been appointed CEO to lead the platform. He brings experience in scaling global brands to the role.\n\n“India is not just a market – it is the future of global combat sports,” Banga, Mathew and Gill said in a joint statement. “Together with BKFC, BKFL and WLF, we are building an ecosystem that will develop Indian fighters, create global stars and deliver world-class fight entertainment to millions of fans.”\n\nSanghvi positioned the venture as an opportunity to build a sports intellectual property from India with global reach. “This is where world-class storytelling meets raw, uncompromising sport,” he said. “With WLF, BKFC and Conor McGregor, we are not just launching a league – we are architecting a global sports IP from India that will command attention, talent and fandom worldwide.”\n\nFeldman emphasized India’s longstanding position in the organization’s expansion strategy. “India has been on our roadmap for a long time,” he said. “The scale, the energy, the culture — there is no place like it. With the leadership team we have assembled and our partnership with WLF, we are bringing the purest form of combat sports to a nation ready for it.”\n\nMcGregor, who serves as a global partner for BKFC, framed the expansion as transformative. “India has warriors in its DNA,” he said. “What we’re building with BKFC and BKFL in India will be something the world has never seen before. This is not just expansion – this is a revolution.”\n\nShroff, joining McGregor as a board member, highlighted the cultural significance of the venture. “Honored to stand alongside Conor McGregor as we create something truly historic for Indian sport,” he said. “This is more than a fight – it’s a global movement, and history is being written. Just like cinema, sport is a celebration of talent and skill, and Parag [Sanghvi] and I are committed to turning this into a landmark moment for India.”\n\nThe first official BKFC and BKFL team-based events are scheduled for 2026, with venue and fight card details to be announced.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\n\nOscar Predictions: Original Screenplay — With Few Signals, 'Sinners' Takes an Early Lead\n\nOscar Predictions: ‘Sinners’ Could Shatter the All-Time Nomination Record as International Films Hope for Recognition\n\nNew Movies Out Now in Theaters: What to See This Week",

    "description": "With \"Avatar: Fire & Ash,\" Zoe Saldaña has passed Scarlett Johansson as the highest-grossing actor of all time at the global box office.",
    "fullText": "Since going Hollywood in the early 2000s after a sensational pro wrestling career at the WWE, Johnson has gradually built up his box office tally. But the ticket sales got as big as his biceps when he joined the \"Fast and Furious\" franchise with 2011's \"Fast Five.\"\n\nAlong with helping \"Fast\" entries like 2015's \"Furious 7\" and 2017's \"The Fate of the Furious\" each earn over $1 billion at the worldwide box office, he's also scored other big hits like the \"Moana\" and \"Jumanji\" franchises.\n\nAs Captain America, Evans is attached to some of the biggest box office earners of all time, including 2019's \"Avengers: Endgame,\" which is the second-highest-grossing movie of all time at the worldwide box office with over $2.7 billion.\n\nSince then, he's shown up in box office hits like \"Free Guy\" (just a quick cameo, but it still counts) and 2024's \"Deadpool & Wolverine.\"\n\nExpect him to rise up this list with him reprising his role as Captain America in \"Avengers: Doomsday\" coming out at the end of the year.\n\nAs the star in all 10 movies in the \"Fast\" franchise, Vin Diesel is a major part of its over $7 billion take.\n\nDiesel has also scored big as the voice of Groot in the \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" franchise.\n\nAs the face of the Thor franchise, Hemsworth has helped it earn close to $3 billion at the worldwide box office. As a member of \"The Avengers\" franchise, he's also been a part of the close to $8 billion those movies have grossed.\n\nMost recently, he starred in the hit \"Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga.\" He will also be \"Avengers: Doomsday.\"\n\nRegarded as one of the last true movie stars, Cruise was topping box office charts long before most on this list had their first screen credit.\n\nNow in his 60s, Cruise is proving he's still got it as the latest (and perhaps final) \"Mission: Impossible\" movie, \"The Final Reckoning,\" is going strong in theaters, earning half a billion dollars worldwide. That adds to its already impressive tally of close to $5 billion for the eight-movie franchise.\n\nThere's also talk of a third \"Top Gun\" movie after the franchise was revived in 2020 with \"Top Gun: Maverick,\" which brought in $1.4 billion.\n\nWho knew the jokester from \"Parks and Recreation\" would become such a huge box office draw?\n\nFrom playing Star-Lord in the \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" movies (and several other Marvel releases), a lovable Lego figure in the \"The Lego Movie\" franchise, the hero in the \"Jurassic World\" movies, and the voice of Mario in \"The Super Mario Bros. Movie,\" Pratt's hard work has paid off.\n\nBelieve it or not, there was a time when Hollywood wanted nothing to do with Robert Downey Jr.\n\nIn the early 2000s, Downey Jr.'s years of drug use and brushes with the law caught up with him. After spending a year at a court-ordered drug-treatment facility, he was broke and virtually unhireable.\n\nThen he got the offer that led to his comeback: the titular role in 2008's \"Iron Man.\"\n\nWith that, Downey Jr. became the face of the lucrative Marvel Cinematic Universe, which has grossed over $31 billion worldwide to date.\n\nAfter ending his run as Iron Man with 2019's \"Avengers: Endgame,\" the second-highest-grossing movie of all time, he's returning to the MCU as the villain Doctor Doom in \"Avengers: Doomsday.\"\n\nIf there has ever been a blueprint for success in the modern-day movie business, it would be Sam Jackson's filmography.\n\nFrom \"Star Wars\" to the MCU to Pixar's hit \"The Incredibles,\" the actor has been a staple of box-office sensations for decades — and let's not forget all the memorable roles he's played in movies from Spike Lee and Quentin Tarantino.\n\nThis is why he was No. 1 on this list for so many years.\n\nSince showing up as Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow in 2010's \"Iron Man 2,\" Johansson has upped her box office game.\n\nAlong with being a fixture in the MCU as a member of The Avengers, she also found big box office dollars starring in movies like \"The Jungle Book\" and \"Sing.\"\n\nAs the face of the latest hit movie in the \"Jurassic Park\" franchise, \"Jurassic World Rebirth,\" which took in close to $870 million at the worldwide box office, Johansson was tops on this list.\n\nThis recent Oscar winner has been on a box office hot streak for years.\n\nBetween playing Uhura in the \"Star Trek\" franchise, Gamora in the \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" movies, and Neytiri in the epic \"Avatar\" films, Saldaña's role choices have been impeccable.\n\nReturning as Neytiri in James Cameron's 2025 hit \"Avatar: Fire & Ash,\" which has scored over $1 billion at the global box office, has placed her as the current highest-grossing actor.",

    "description": "Jimmy Donaldson, the world’s most popular YouTuber and founder of $5 billion business Beast Industries, claims he doesn’t “technically” have enough money to buy McDonald’s in the morning.",
    "fullText": "Some successful entrepreneurs sitting atop billion-dollar businesses say they may look rich on paper, but take a peek into their bank accounts, and they’re actually cash poor. Social media mogul Jimmy Donaldson, known to his 460 million YouTube followers as MrBeast, claims he’s just as broke as everyone else despite running a $5 billion entertainment empire.\n\n“I’m borrowing money. That’s how little money I have,” Donaldson told the Wall Street Journal earlier this month. “Technically, everyone watching this video has more money than me in their bank account if you subtract the equity value of my company, which doesn’t buy me McDonald’s in the morning.”\n\nThe 27-year-old entrepreneur has said that he keeps less than $1 million for himself, despite being a billionaire and owning more than half of his $5 billion company Beast Industries. Aside from his nine-figure Amazon deal and popular YouTube channel with 107 billion lifetime views, Donaldson hit the ultra-rich club—at least on paper—from a slew of successful businesses. He’s launched ventures including multimillion-dollar chocolate brand Feastables; Lunchly, a Lunchables-esque packaged food product; MrBeast Burger, a virtual restaurant that only allows for pickup and drop-off; and production company MrBeast LLC, which helps manufacture his viral videos.\n\nThrough his assets, Donaldson is projected to be worth at least $2.6 billion—although he emphasized it’s not a fat wad of cash burning a hole in his pocket. Forbes has also estimated that his annual earnings reached $85 million between April 2024 and April 2025, a far cry from the typical American salary of $62,088 a year. However, that doesn’t mean he’s splurging on luxuries and only flying private. Donaldson claimed he’s actually in the red.\n\n“It’s funny talking about my personal finances, because no one ever believes anything I say,” Donaldson explained. “They’re like, ‘You’re a billionaire!’ I’m like, ‘That’s net worth.’ I have negative money right now.”\n\n“I wake up, I just work…I’m just so busy working I don’t really think about my personal bank account,” Donaldson continued. “I’m just laser-focused on making the greatest videos as possible, and building the business as big as possible.”\n\nDonaldson rakes in eight-figure earnings and runs a $5 billion business, yet still claims to be broke. So where is all of his money going? Right back into his business ventures, the YouTube star says.\n\n“I personally have very little money because I reinvest everything (I think this year we’ll spend around a quarter of a billion on content). Ironically I’m actually borrowing $ from my mom to pay for my upcoming wedding,” Donaldson wrote on X in response to a post heralding him as the only billionaire under 30 who didn’t inherit their wealth.",

    "fullText": "Joao Pedro’s window at Chelsea is closing, and the next few games will tell us a lot about his short term future.\n\nHe came in with a big impact at the Club World Cup, and gave everyone the hope that Chelsea’s striker troubles were over. But as time has passed, it’s become clear that he prefers to play as a number ten.\n\nThat’s all well and good. The problem is that Chelsea already have plenty of number tens. There’s an argument they have too many, even without the Brazil star. Meanwhile, they’re pretty short up front.\n\nLiam Delap has missed most of the season injured, and has only just scored his first Premier League goal a week ago. Yet as far as we can see, he’s ahead of JP in the pecking order for Liam Rosenior. Delap may not score, but he puts himself about. That’s more than you can say for Joao Pedro at the moment.\n\nJoao Pedro protests a decision against Arsenal. (Photo by Ryan Pierse/Getty Images)\n\nWith Enzo Fernandez, Andrey Santos, Cole Palmer and even Estevao Willian pushing for minutes at 10, and Delap a better option up top, JP is looking a little lost right now. Rotation and injuries will always mean he’s in line for fairly regular action, especially off the bench where he provides a good option.\n\nBut right now, it’s hard to imagine him being considered first choice. He’s got 18 Premier League starts and 3 sub appearances, so he’s featured in every game so far this season. We doubt that record is going to continue.\n\nWest Ham are circling around the drain of the Premier League, and are getting desperate for solutions. They’re now sniffing around a player who Chelsea don’t even use.\n\nCole Palmer had his annus mirabilis under Mauricio Pochettino rather than Enzo Maresca and the stats show it clearly – but how much of that was actually down to the coaches?",

    "fullText": "AS Monaco are pleased to announce the arrival of Wout Faes. The 27-year-old Belgian international centre-back has joined the club on loan from Leicester City Football Club until the end of the season, with an option to buy.\n\nAfter spells in the Belgian and English leagues, notably in the Premier League, Belgian international Wout Faes, with 28 caps, is set to make his return to Ligue 1 with AS Monaco, a championship he knows well, having previously played there with Stade de Reims from 2020 to 2022.\n\nBorn in Mol, Belgium, on 3 April 1998, Wout Faes completed his youth development in his home country. He began at KVV Rauw Sport Mol (2003–2006), before continuing at Lierse SK (2006–2012), and then at RSC Anderlecht, where he signed his first professional contract in 2016.\n\nThe following year, he made his professional debut with SC Heerenveen in the Netherlands, before joining Excelsior Rotterdam for the 2017–2018 season, during which he made 20 appearances. He then moved to KV Ostende (Belgian First Division), where he played 64 matches and scored two goals between 2018 and 2020.\n\nIn the summer of 2020, Wout Faes joined France and Stade de Reims. Wearing the “Rémois” shirt, he established himself as a key figure in defence, making 77 appearances in all competitions and scoring five goals. Since the summer of 2022, Wout Faes has been playing for Leicester City. With the “Foxes”, the 1.87 m centre-back discovered the Premier League (65 matches, 2 goals, 2 assists) and the Championship (58 matches, 3 goals, 1 assist).\n\nHis performances earned him a place in the Belgian national team. Having represented his country at all youth levels, he now has 28 caps for “les Diables Rouges” and took part in the 2022 World Cup as well as UEFA Euro 2024.\n\nWout Faes will now be playing under the colours of AS Monaco with the number 25.",

    "description": "When my partner and I broke up right before our international trip we'd planned together, I'm glad I decided to go anyway and make it a solo trip.",
    "fullText": "My boyfriend of two and a half years broke the long silence with the question we were both wondering: \"Are we still going?\"\n\nWe were supposed to be driving to the airport to leave for our five-day trip to Lisbon. Instead, we'd had an argument over the phone that morning that left me questioning how we'd even make it through a flight, let alone an international trip.\n\nOur relationship had been rocky for quite some time, but our travel plans were fast approaching, and I didn't want to give them up. The good news is we were flying standby, so our tickets were 100% refundable.\n\n\"You don't want to go?\" I asked. \"I can cancel your ticket right now.\"\n\nTurns out, he didn't think it was a good idea to still travel together — but, hey, I love a solo trip. We split. I kept my plane ticket.\n\nMy adrenaline was high and my heart was racing, but I ultimately felt relieved as I drove to the Boston airport alone, and boarded my flight.\n\nI cried a few times during the flight, but I couldn't stop smiling when I heard the pilot say, \"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Lisbon.\"\n\nI was so proud of myself for making it there alone — and, from there, the trip was surprisingly smooth.\n\nSince I'd used my credit-card points to book our hotel room, it was already in my name. I'd planned our whole itinerary myself anyway, so I just followed it on my own.\n\nThough I shed a few more tears while coping with our breakup, I found exploring a new country was a wonderful way to clear my mind.\n\nOver the next few days, I wandered around Lisbon's many viewpoints, ate amazing food, drank great wine, and even made some friends.\n\nWhile at a café, two girls noticed I was by myself and asked me to join their table. We spent over an hour divulging our life stories to each other.\n\nThe next day, I went on a guided excursion to Sintra, a beautiful town about 30 minutes away from Lisbon. At the beginning of the tour, a woman and her niece started chatting with me, and asked if I was alone.\n\nWhen I told them about the breakup, they decided to \"adopt\" me. We spent the day together hiking to Pena Palace (the town's colorful castle on a hill) and exploring the local shops.\n\nThroughout the trip, I couldn't stop thinking about how much happier I was than if I had come with my boyfriend. I got to enjoy the city at my own pace, without worrying about keeping the peace in my unstable relationship.\n\nFortunately, solo travel was not a new concept for me.\n\nNo matter my relationship status, I've always made time to travel on my own and, as a flight attendant, it comes naturally. It's nice to not have to worry about anyone else's budget or availability — I can just go where I want, when I want.\n\nTraveling solo was so in-character for me that when I posted about it on my Instagram, the only people who realized anything was wrong (or that I was fresh out of a relationship) were the ones I'd told.\n\nLater on, my friends told me they were proud of me for choosing to go on the trip alone. However, not going was never an option to me.\n\nIf I hadn't already been comfortable with traveling solo, I probably wouldn't have had the guts to go to Portugal by myself, and I would've missed out on what became an amazing, healing trip.\n\nHonestly, I'd encourage everyone to try solo travel, regardless of their relationship status. Navigating a new place on your own is a huge confidence boost and the best way to get to know yourself.",

    "fullText": "LONDON, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Global oil trading houses have emerged as early winners in the race to control Venezuelan crude flows, getting ahead of U.S. energy majors wary of credit and legal risks and securing a potentially lucrative business opportunity in the country with the world's largest crude reserves.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump said U.S. majors would invest billions of dollars in Venezuela to quickly rebuild its dilapidated oil sector following the U.S. ​capture of President Nicolas Maduro earlier in January. Trump met top oil executives at the White House on Friday as his administration outlines a long-term plan to raise $100 billion to boost Venezuelan oil output.\n\nThe first companies to secure any business in the wake ‌of the U.S. military action in Caracas, however, were Dutch-based trader Vitol and Singapore-headquartered peer Trafigura, rather than U.S. majors.\n\nThe U.S. government tapped the giant merchant houses because they were better suited to quickly get Venezuelan oil exports flowing again, four industry sources familiar with the negotiations said. That is the first order of business for Washington before reconstruction ‌can begin, so that revenue from exports under U.S. supervision can fund the government of interim President Delcy Rodriguez in Caracas.\n\n\"Securing and marketing the initial barrels of Venezuelan crude oil was done at record speed to benefit both the American and Venezuelan people,\" a White House official told Reuters.\n\nVenezuela relies on oil exports for revenue, and has been starved of those proceeds for about a month under a blockade Trump imposed as he raised pressure on Maduro.\n\nWashington and Caracas are finalizing a $2 billion deal to sell up to 50 million barrels of crude to U.S. refiners and other buyers - oil that had been stuck on ships in Venezuelan waters and in storage tanks because of the blockade.\n\nFacilitating the initial oil sales was critical to ensure funds could flow back into Venezuela for everyday services and a process is in place to maintain the steady flow of production, sales, and refining of Venezuelan crude oil, the ⁠White House official said.\n\nTrafigura and Vitol have secured preliminary special licenses to negotiate and export the ‌Venezuelan crude, and Trafigura is set to load its first cargo this week, Chief Executive Richard Holtum said at the White House meeting with Trump.\n\nGLOBAL NETWORK ADDED TO TRADERS' APPEAL\n\nThe trading houses competed with Chevron to secure the supply deals. Chevron is the only U.S. oil major that operates in Venezuela, as a minority partner in joint ventures with Venezuelan state oil firm PDVSA. Chevron has a license from U.S. authorities, which exempts it from ‍the sanctions the United States had imposed to choke off oil revenues to Maduro.",

    "fullText": "The world’s first tuned Chevrolet C8 Corvette ZR1 has officially hit the dyno, and the results are already eye-opening. In a development video published by Burger Motorsports, the company behind the JB4PRO and JB4 tuning modules, the twin-turbo Corvette delivered over 1,000 wheel horsepower in completely stock form on 93-octane pump gas. Baseline runs showed approximately 1,010 wheel horsepower and 815 lb-ft of torque, confirming just how aggressive the factory calibration is on Chevrolet’s most powerful production Corvette to date.\n\nThe testing also highlighted how carefully the ZR1 has been engineered by General Motors. Peak boost reached roughly 20 psi at low rpm before tapering to about 17 psi up top, with stable air-fuel ratios and turbo shaft speeds hovering around 120,000 rpm.\n\nEven before tuning, the data suggested there was limited, but usable, headroom for additional power if approached with detailed sensor monitoring and conservative boost control. Suddenly, the Ford Mustang GTD because even more insecure.\n\nBurger Motorsports used its JB4PRO system for development, selected for its ability to intercept and analyze up to 40 sensor inputs, including digital MAF signals, turbo shaft speed, and both high- and low-pressure fuel data. Installation proved challenging due to the Corvette’s mid-engine layout, but once wired, the system provided the level of data access needed to safely adjust boost and fueling on the seemingly underestimated LT7 twin-turbo engine.\n\nWith JB4PRO Map 1 on 93-octane pump gas, output increased to 1,048 wheel horsepower and 896 lb-ft of torque, nearly a 50-horsepower gain with no hardware changes. Switching to an E30 blend and Map 2 pushed output past 1,060 wheel horsepower and 943 lb-ft, while mid-range gains exceeded 150 wheel horsepower. Burger Motorsports emphasized that these gains came from controlled adjustments, not aggressive peak-boost spikes.\n\nView the 3 images of this gallery on the original article\n\nThe highest numbers came with JB4PRO Map 3 running on 100-octane race fuel. Under those conditions, the C8 ZR1 produced approximately 1,170 wheel horsepower and 980 lb-ft of torque. While peak output increased by about 100 wheel horsepower over stock, the most significant improvement occurred in the mid-range, where the tuned setup showed more than 220 additional wheel horsepower at 6,000 rpm.\n\nAccording to Burger Motorsports, multiple JB4PRO maps will be offered to support different fuel types, ranging from conservative 91-octane setups to race-gas configurations. Early testing confirms that the C8 ZR1 is not only historically powerful out of the box, but also capable of safely delivering supercar-level gains with minimal tuning, setting the stage for far more extreme builds to follow.\n\nView the 3 images of this gallery on the original article",

    "title": "As 2026 World Cup nears, Alan Rothenberg reflects on U.S. soccer's transformation",
    "description": "As the man behind the 1984 L.A. Olympics soccer tournament and the 1994 World Cup, Alan Rothenberg arguably had more to do with writing the story of modern U.S. Soccer than anyone.",
    "fullText": "Alan Rothenberg has a story he wants to tell you. A lot of stories actually; enough to fill a book.\n\nBut that’s not the first memorable work he’s authored. As the man behind the 1984 L.A. Olympics soccer tournament and the 1994 World Cup, still the most successful in history, Rothenberg has arguably had more to do with writing the story of U.S. Soccer in the modern era than anyone.\n\nAnd you can draw a straight line from that chapter to the one that will be written this summer when the World Cup returns to the U.S.\n\n“The turning point really was the Olympics,” he said last month over brunch in a crowded Sherman Oaks diner. “That soccer was so successful in the Olympics, that’s when FIFA thought maybe we could bring our crown jewel to the United States and not be embarrassed.\n\n“So ‘84 Olympics. That’s a crucial part of the story. I doubt that we would be where we are now but for that.”\n\nThat story’s in “The Big Bounce: The Surge That Shaped the Future of U.S. Soccer,” which is available Feb. 10. In fact, the book starts there.\n\nBut Rothenberg’s career did not. Before changing the face of U.S. Soccer, he first altered the landscape of sports in his adopted hometown, playing instrumental roles in bringing the Clippers to Los Angeles, in negotiating the trade that made Kareem Abdul-Jabbar a Laker and in settling the Kings at the Forum.\n\nAs a lawyer who started his career as the in-house counsel for Jack Kent Cooke when Cooke owned the Lakers, the Kings, the then-Washington Redskins and was launching the Wolves of the nascent NASL, Rothenberg was involved in some of the most consequential events in four sports during a career that’s nearing the end of its sixth decade. Yet he knew little about soccer when Peter Ueberroth, chair of the L.A. Olympic Organizing Committee, put him in charge of the sport for the 1984 Games.\n\n“Peter assumed with that background I must know a lot about soccer,” Rothenberg writes. “That was wrong.”\n\nWhat he lacked in soccer knowledge he more than made up for in creativity and organization skills, however, and the Olympic tournament proved to be one of the most successful in history, with the final at the Rose Bowl drawing a crowd of 104,098, a U.S. record for a soccer game that stood for 30 years.\n\nBut his name will forever be synonymous with the World Cup.\n\nThe 1994 tournament was the first to be played in a country without a first-division league and there were widespread fears it would be a disaster. Instead, it drew an average of 69,174 fans to each of the 52 games, an attendance record that still stands. It also generated a surplus of more than $50 million — also a record — money that went to the U.S. Soccer Foundation to promote the growth of the sport in the U.S.\n\nTwo years later, Major League Soccer kicked off; 30 years later it’s the sixth-most-valuable soccer league in the world.\n\n“Everything flowed from ‘94,” Rothenberg said. “If ‘94 had not been successful, including if our [U.S.] team hadn’t been credible, I’m not sure how quickly things would have developed. Certainly we wouldn’t have been able to start Major League Soccer at that time if the World Cup wasn’t successful.”\n\nAnother rarely discussed — but hugely important — legacy of that tournament is the foundation it created in terms of experience and expertise. The U.S. had never staged a major standalone soccer competition before 1994 and the learning curve was steep. Among those who worked under Rothenberg and went on to great success in the sport were Sunil Gulati, a three-term president of U.S. Soccer; Nelson Rodriguez, now MLS executive vice-president; Marla Messing, who headed the organizing committee for the 1999 Women’s World Cup and was later interim commissioner of the NWSL; Tom King, U.S. Soccer’s longtime managing director of administration; Kathy Carter, the former executive vice-president of Soccer United Marketing and chief executive officer of U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Properties; and Charlie Stillitano, a former MLS general manager who pioneered the idea of inviting major European clubs to play summer friendlies in the U.S.\n\n“It's not just that the event [came] off. Look what came out of it,” said Scott LeTellier, who as managing director and chief operating officer had responsibility for day-to-day operations of the World Cup organizing committee for 1994. “All the people who worked on our committee, who had some role that now are general managers of MLS teams. The league itself that came out of it. The number of soccer facilities. We didn't have a single soccer specific-stadium in the country.\n\n“You can argue that the ‘94 World Cup was really the linchpin to that entire explosion in the sport.”\n\nThat tournament was ahead of its time in other ways too. It was the first to stage fan fests in host cities, the first to include musical performers at the final and the first to offer hospitality packages with the price of a ticket. It also featured a lavish opening ceremony, one that featured Diana Ross, Oprah Winfrey and President Clinton, turning what was just a soccer tournament into a global spectacle.\n\nThe World Cup hasn’t been the same since, with FIFA’s revenue growing to a projected $13 billion for the 2026 cycle. There are more than 40 countries that don’t have an economy that large.\n\nAs Rothenberg notes in his book, FIFA originally pushed back on many of the innovations he proposed, including a halftime show at the final, only to eventually adopt the ideas as their own. Rothenberg also wanted to charge $1,000 a ticket for the final in 1994, arguing that fans would pay that on the secondary market, so why let the scalpers make the profit?\n\n“They were horrified,” he said. “You realize what a dramatic statement it would make if you had a $100-million gate?”\n\nThey do now; the cheapest regular tickets for the final of this summer’s tournament start at $2,000.\n\nRothenberg said he’s still thinking of other ways to improve the tournament, such as expanding the field to 64 teams and doing away with the group stage, making the World Cup like the NCAA basketball tournament.\n\n“I know I’m off the charts on this one,” he said. “Single elimination. It’s exciting start to finish.”\n\nAt 86, Rothenberg is still active, making regular trips to his office at 1st Century Bank, the community bank he founded in 2004 at an age when most people were entering retirement. And he promises to be a presence at this summer’s World Cup.\n\nAs for whether he gets the credit he deserves for making that tournament possible, Rothenberg demurs.\n\n“I didn’t do it for credit,” he says, speaking about both the World Cup and the book that explains how it happened. “All I can say is I’m proud of what I did.”\n\n⚽ You have read the latest installment of On Soccer with Kevin Baxter.

    "description": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth says Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence chatbot Grok will join Google’s AI engine inside the Pentagon network.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Monday that Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence chatbot Grok will join Google’s generative AI engine in operating inside the Pentagon network, as part of a broader push to feed as much of the military’s data as possible into the developing technology.\n\n“Very soon we will have the world’s leading AI models on every unclassified and classified network throughout our department,” Hegseth said in a speech at Musk’s space flight company, SpaceX, in South Texas.\n\nThe announcement comes just days after Grok — which is embedded into X, the social media network owned by Musk — drew global outcry and scrutiny for generating highly sexualized deepfake images of people without their consent.\n\nMalaysia and Indonesia have blocked Grok, while the U.K.’s independent online safety watchdog announced an investigation Monday. Grok has limited image generation and editing to paying users.\n\nHegseth said Grok will go live inside the Defense Department later this month and announced that he would “make all appropriate data” from the military’s IT systems available for “AI exploitation.” He also said data from intelligence databases would be fed into AI systems.\n\nHegseth’s aggressive push to embrace the still-developing technology stands in contrast to the Biden administration, which, while pushing federal agencies to come up with policies and uses for AI, was also wary of misuse. Officials said rules were needed to ensure that the technology, which could be harnessed for mass surveillance, cyberattacks or even lethal autonomous devices, was being used responsibly.\n\nThe Biden administration enacted a framework in late 2024 that directed national security agencies to expand their use of the most advanced AI systems but prohibited certain uses, such as applications that would violate constitutionally protected civil rights or any system that would automate the deployment of nuclear weapons. It is unclear if those prohibitions are still in place under the Trump administration.\n\nDuring his speech, Hegseth spoke of the need to streamline and speed up technological innovations within the military, saying, “We need innovation to come from anywhere and evolve with speed and purpose.”\n\nHe noted that the Pentagon possesses “combat-proven operational data from two decades of military and intelligence operations.”\n\n“AI is only as good as the data that it receives, and we’re going to make sure that it’s there,” Hegseth said.\n\nThe defense secretary said he wants AI systems within the Pentagon to be responsible, though he went on to say he was shrugging off any AI models “that won’t allow you to fight wars.”\n\nHegseth said his vision for military AI systems means that they operate “without ideological constraints that limit lawful military applications,” before adding that the Pentagon’s “AI will not be woke.”\n\nMusk developed and pitched Grok as an alternative to what he called “woke AI” interactions from rival chatbots like Google’s Gemini or OpenAI’s ChatGPT. In July, Grok also caused controversy after it appeared to make antisemitic comments that praised Adolf Hitler and shared several antisemitic posts.\n\nThe Pentagon did not immediately respond to questions about the issues with Grok.",

    "fullText": "Despite internet blackout, a small number of Iranians are risking their lives to share messages as protests continue\n\nFor most of Iran, the internet was shut off on Thursday afternoon – the most severe blackout the country has seen in years of internet shutdowns, coming after days of escalating anti-government protests.\n\nFor a very small sliver of the country, it is still possible to get photos and videos to the outside world, and even to make calls. The Telegram channel Vahid Online on Monday posted photos of dead bodies lying next to a street in Kahrizak, on the southern outskirts of Tehran; on Sunday, it shared a video of Iranians chanting “death to Khamenei” at a funeral.\n\nSome of these videos and messages are transmitted through an ecosystem of online tools designed to bypass censorship – among them Telegram proxies, a decentralised messaging service called Delta Chat, and a browser called Ceno, said Amir Rashidi, an Iranian digital rights expert.\n\nThere are about 50,000 Starlink terminals now in Iran, said Rashidi; other reports put this number at up to 100,000. The users of the service – which is part of Elon Musk’s SpaceX – are a tiny fraction of Iran’s overall population of more than 90 million people.\n\nWhile multiple people – even a whole apartment block – might be able to connect to the internet via a single Starlink terminal, the number of total users in the entire country is at most in the hundreds of thousands, said Doug Madory, the director of internet analysis at Kentik, a network observability and intelligence platform.\n\nThey hold Iran’s last tenuous link to the outside world. Very little information, at least electronically, appears to be leaving the country, except for minimal traffic from businesses and individuals whitelisted by the regime.\n\nAcross Iran, authorities are hunting for Starlink terminals – jamming whole neighbourhoods using tools developed for electronic warfare, and flying drones over rooftops to search for telltale satellite dishes, say sources. Under a law passed in 2025, possessing a Starlink terminal in Iran can be interpreted as espionage for Israel and is punishable by up to 10 years in prison.\n\n“They have basically criminalised Starlink to the extent that they’re saying in the law [that] if you use Starlink it’s the equivalent of conducting espionage operations for Israel and the American CIA,” said Rashidi.\n\nIt is unclear how many terminals are still operating, and how many have been confiscated, he added.\n\nThe tools Iran appears to be using to jam the terminals are military-grade, similar to those used to jam drones on the frontlines of Ukraine, said Rashidi. They are expensive and energy-intensive, capable of knocking out a certain radio frequency within a given area, but can only be used locally and cannot blanket the country.\n\n“It’s not cheap. It’s something you’d find in a military arsenal, and there’s only a few types of suppliers,” said Madory.\n\nFor now, the few who have smuggled Starlink terminals can connect online, although in neighbourhoods with heavy jamming it is nearly impossible to do more than send messages. The tech-savvy among them are using VPNs to disguise their presence; others are simply hauling their terminals from place to place to avoid detection.\n\nWhile Starlink users can communicate for now, Iran could choose – though it would be difficult – to track them down.\n\n“Depending on how much effort the Iranian government wanted to put into it, they could trace the signals that use the particular frequency those terminals have to use,” said Madory. “You’re kind of announcing yourself.”\n\nFor those without a terminal, an announcement on a state-linked Telegram channel has given a preview to the potential future of the internet in Iran. The IRIB news agency yesterday published a list of all internet sites that would now be available in Iran.\n\nThese included domestic search engines, domestic maps and navigation services, domestic messaging apps, and even a domestic streaming service – an Iranian version of Netflix, said Rashidi, with only government-approved videos.\n\nAll of these sites are part of Iran’s effort to create a national internet, said Rashidi: a skeleton version of the web that is significantly more restricted than even China’s, managed by the government and virtually unconnected to the outside world. That effort has been under way since the Rouhani administration, and now appears to be working, he said.\n\nWhat this could mean, said Madory and Rashidi, is that Iran’s internet as it was may not come back.\n\n“There are rumours,” said Rashidi. “Some people are saying that if things go back normal, there won’t be the internet. There will be only the national internet.”\n\n“They’re gearing up for the long run, for this to be the way things are for an extended period of time,” said Madory.",

    "fullText": "After Apple chose Gemini to power Siri, Alphabet surpassed Apple to become second-most valuable company in world\n\nGoogle’s parent company hit a major financial milestone on Monday, reaching a $4tn valuation for the first time and surpassing Apple to become the second-most valuable company in the world.\n\nAlphabet is the fourth company to hit the $4tn milestone after Nvidia, which later hit $5tn, Microsoft and Apple.\n\nThe spike in share price comes after Apple announced it had chosen Google’s Gemini AI model to power a major overhaul of the iPhone maker’s digital assistant Siri, which comes installed in every iPhone. Neither company disclosed how much the deal was worth.\n\n“After careful evaluation, we determined that Google’s technology provides the most capable foundation for Apple Foundation Models,” Apple said in a statement to CNBC.\n\nAs tech stocks continue a years-long meteoric rise, fears of a bubble in the stock market persist; however, Wall Street’s excitement for new avenues of investment in AI does as well. Alphabet’s milestones signal a remarkable change in investor sentiment for Alphabet, with its stock surging about 65% in 2025, outperforming its peers on Wall Street’s elite group of stocks, the so-called “Magnificent Seven”.\n\nThe tech giant has allayed investors’ doubts about its artificial intelligence strategy in recent months with a series of high-profile product launches, including the latest version of its flagship AI model, Gemini, and the popular Nano Banana image generator and editor. OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT and Google’s insurgent rival, left investors and consumers underwhelmed with the release of its latest model, GPT-5, which allowed Alphabet to surge ahead.\n\nGoogle, best known for making the world’s most popular search engine and browser, has also turned its once-overlooked cloud unit into a major growth engine, which drew a rare tech investment from Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway. Google Cloud’s revenue jumped 34% in the third quarter, with a backlog of non-recognized sales contracts rising to $155bn. Renting out Google’s self-developed AI chips that were reserved for internal use to outside customers has also enabled the unit’s breakneck pace of growth.\n\nMeanwhile, the company’s dominant revenue generator – the advertising business, driven by Google Search and YouTube – has largely held steady in the face of economic uncertainty and intense competition.\n\nThe company has faced two landmark US antitrust suits as it has navigated its place in the AI boom. After Google lost the first case, a judge ruled in September against breaking up the company, allowing it to retain control of its Chrome browser and Android mobile operating system.\n\nIn the second case, a judge ruled Google had illegally monopolized the online ad market last April. A trial over how to remedy the monopoly began in September, which could see the judge forcing Google to divest parts of its lucrative ads business to foster competition.",

    "fullText": "The world's most senior central bankers are rallying around Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell after he said the US government was attempting to pressure the central bank on monetary policy.\n\nOn Tuesday, a letter cosigned by the heads of 10 global central banking institutions defended Powell's integrity, calling him a \"respected colleague held in the highest regard by all who have worked with him.\"\n\n\"We stand in full solidarity with the Federal Reserve System and its Chair Jerome H. Powell,\" the letter read.\n\n\"The independence of central banks is a cornerstone of price, financial and economic stability in the interest of the citizens that we serve. It is therefore critical to preserve that independence, with full respect for the rule of law and democratic accountability. Chair Powell has served with integrity, focused on his mandate and an unwavering commitment to the public interest,\" the letter read.\n\nThe statement was signed by Christine Lagarde, head of the European Central Bank, and Andrew Bailey, the Bank of England chief, as well as central bank bosses from Sweden, Denmark, Switzerland, Australia, Canada, South Korea, and Brazil, alongside the chair and general managers of the Bank for International Settlements.\n\nThe letter comes after Powell revealed on Sunday that the Federal Reserve had been served grand jury subpoenas by the Department of Justice, which was widely viewed as the latest escalation in an ongoing dispute between the central bank and the Trump administration over the path of interest rates.\n\n\"No one — certainly not the chair of the Federal Reserve — is above the law,\" Powell said in a video statement on Sunday. \"But this unprecedented action should be seen in the broader context of the administration's threats and ongoing pressure.\"\n\nOn Monday, a group of senior figures in US economics and monetary policy, including all three living former heads of the Fed, and five former Treasury secretaries, rallied behind Powell.\n\nThat statement called the investigation \"an unprecedented attempt to use prosecutorial attacks to undermine\" the independence of the Fed.\n\n\"It has no place in the United States whose greatest strength is the rule of law, which is at the foundation of our economic success,\" the statement added.",

    "fullText": "Northern Ireland's Josh Rock says he expects there to be a raucous atmosphere when he faces double world champion Luke Littler in the Premier League at the SSE Arena in Belfast in February.\n\nRock was named in the elite group of eight players to contest the Premier League for the first time last week, with the 17-week tournament kicking off in Newcastle on 5 February.\n\nBelfast will host night four on 26 February, with the county Antrim native set to enjoy the support of the partisan home fans as he takes on world number one Littler.\n\n\"I think it's going to be absolutely nuts,\" the 24-year-old told BBC Sport NI.\n\n\"Daryl [Gurney] was the last one [from Northern Ireland to be part of the Premier League, in 2020], but that was prior to Covid and darts wasn't as big back then. Now darts is bigger than it has ever been.\n\n\"I play Luke [Littler] in Belfast so we'll see what happens. Every time I have played him it's been 100 plus averages every time. I've been in front every time but just can't seem to get over the line, but I'll get him yet.\"\n\nRock says he chats with Littler \"nearly every day\" and that the sport owes much to the English teenage sensation.\n\n\"Everything has to go down to Luke Littler. If it wasn't for him doing what he did when he was only 16 [reaching the World Championship final as a rank outsider] and winning the Worlds the past two years the sport wouldn't be where it is now.\n\n\"Everyone has to thank him for it.\n\n\"It has gone through the roof now.

    "fullText": "Liverpool are in the fight for Yan Diomande - but they have an alternative. And he's a true world-class talent, too.\n\nYan Diomande is one of the most in-demand talents in world football right now. The Ivorian has exploded onto the scene over the last year, first with Leganes and then at RB Leipzig this season.\n\nIt's widely expected that he'll move again in 2026, probably for a truly massive fee. Liverpool will likely try to be the team that pays that, according to several outlets.\n\nOne of those claiming it is Christian Falk, with the Bayern Munich insider suggesting the Reds are in the race along with most European giants. But there's the problem - the fight to win this race is intense and only one team can win.\n\nThus it's important that Liverpool have themselves at least one alternative on the wing. They do need to invest in the position, after all, and Diomande can't be their only option.\n\nIt seems they do have that alternative, though. And he's a truly world-class talent.\n\nThat report by Falk drops an interesting line: Liverpool have Said El Mala on their shortlist, too. Again, they’re not alone in that but it seems the Koln winger is the consolation prize here.\n\nAnd what a prize he is. El Mala is still only 19 but has six Bundesliga goals and two assists in a little over 600 minutes this season. It’s an incredible record, especially as Koln aren’t playing well.\n\nThey’ve won two of their last 14 Bundesliga games. Despite that, El Mala looks like one of the most exciting talents in the league - and one who could compete with Diomande.\n\nLiverpool showed in the summer that they rate Bundesliga talents very highly, spending massively on both Florian Wirtz and Hugo Ekitike. It now seems that they’ll move for another one, be it Diomande or El Mala.\n\nThe latter certainly ticks the boxes Liverpool want. He’s averaging 2.76 successful take-ons per 90 minutes in the Bundesliga this season and the only player in the league averaging more with at least as many minutes is Diomande.\n\nHe’s winning tackles, too, and proving to be a threat in the air. All in all, El Mala is a world-class young talent and one who surely moves up a level in a better team.",

    "description": "Musk said a \"supersonic tsunami\" of AI and robotics will bring about a world of zero scarcity.",
    "fullText": "Saving for retirement is pointless thanks to the impending “supersonic tsunami” of AI and robotics, which will bring about a world of zero scarcity, according to Elon Musk.\n\nWhile the Tesla and SpaceX CEO admitted he’s “more optimistic” than most, he insisted people shouldn’t stress over building a nest egg for the distant future, contrary to the staid advice of nearly all other financial professionals.\n\n“Don’t worry about squirreling money away for retirement in 10 or 20 years,” said the world’s richest man on the Moonshots with Peter Diamandis podcast last week. “It won’t matter.”\n\nPart of Musk’s controversial take lies in his vision of a world transformed by rapidly improving AI, robotics, and energy technology.\n\n“Anything short of shaping atoms, AI can do probably half or more of those jobs right now,” he said.\n\nThe advances could lead to such big productivity increases, he said, that they will surpass “what people possibly could think of as abundance.”\n\nRather than a universal income, everyone will enjoy a “universal ‘you can have whatever you want’ income” in the future, he claimed. In this world, the link between individual wages, savings, and living standards no longer makes sense.\n\nEven without savings, AI will help people obtain better medical care than currently available within five years, as well as remove any limit on the availability of goods, services, or educational opportunities.\n\n​Musk’s comments build on his earlier claims that AI and humanoid robots will make work “optional” within 10 to 20 years and render money itself irrelevant. Musk previously compared the future of work to leisure activities like playing sports or video games rather than a survival necessity.\n\n“If you want to work, [it’s] the same way you can go to the store and just buy some vegetables, or you can grow vegetables in your backyard. It’s much harder to grow vegetables in your backyard, and some people still do it because they like growing vegetables,” Musk said during the U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum in November.\n\n​To be sure, Musk’s predictions about the future come at a time where many Americans are struggling to save. In part due to persistent inflation and weak wage growth, only 55% of American adults said they had a “rainy day” fund of three months expenses saved up for an emergency, down from a high of 59% in 2021, according to a survey by the Federal Reserve. Fewer than half of those surveyed said they could cover an expense of $2,000 or more with their savings.",

    "description": "Gold and silver surge to historic highs as the dollar weakens. A structural shift in safe-haven demand & global monetary confidence?",
    "fullText": "As geopolitical tensions rise, the US dollar (USD), long considered the market’s default safe haven, is failing to respond in the way it has historically.\n\nMeanwhile, gold (XAU) and silver (XAG) are flashing signals that extend far beyond a typical commodities rally.\n\nInstead, capital is flowing decisively into hard assets, pushing gold toward the $5,000 mark and silver above $80, levels that are forcing investors to reassess old macro assumptions.\n\nGold stock analyst Garrett Goggin highlighted the anomaly, noting that during previous US military escalations, the dollar almost always strengthened as investors rushed toward perceived safety. This time, the opposite occurred.\n\n“The USD used to spike higher when the bombs dropped. Not anymore,” Goggin said, pointing to a sharp dollar pullback even as gold and silver surged.\n\nIndeed, while gold and silver prices recorded God Candles on Monday, the US dollar index nosedived, dipping to 98.53 as of this writing. The divergence suggests growing skepticism toward the dollar’s role as a geopolitical hedge.\n\nThe price action itself is historic. Economist and long-time precious metals advocate Peter Schiff noted that gold has cleared $4,560 for the first time ever, placing it closer to $5,000 than $4,000.\n\nSilver, meanwhile, has jumped above $84, posting one of its strongest relative performances in decades. The simultaneous breakout across both metals is unusual and typically associated with periods of deep monetary or systemic stress.\n\nAnalysts argue that silver’s move is not being driven solely by speculative frenzy. Synnax co-founder and COO Dario pointed to silver entering contango—a condition where futures prices trade above spot prices—as a potential signal that large corporate and industrial buyers are entering the market.\n\nAccording to Dario, this behavior suggests companies are hedging against future supply shortages and rising costs. It indicates real-economy demand rather than short-term trading excess.\n\nThe rally has also revived long-standing debates around price suppression in precious metals markets. Kip Herriage argues that gold and silver were artificially restrained for years, citing JPMorgan’s 2020 manipulation fine as a key inflection point.",

From now on.”\n\nA “super cycle” refers to an extended period of strong upward momentum that significantly outpaces normal market growth, often driven by macroeconomic trends.\n\nThe notion of a crypto “super cycle” has gained traction among prominent market figures in recent months.\n\nThis term has been mentioned by Fundstrat and Bitmine’s co-founder Tom Lee, Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood, and most recently Binance founder Changpeng Zhao.\n\nIn response to the SEC removing crypto from 2026 priority risk list, CZ wrote: “I could be wrong, but Super Cycle incoming.”\n\nTom Lee said in November that he believed Ethereum was embarking on the same super cycle as Bitcoin from 2017.\n\n“The path higher is not a straight line,” he wrote on X.\n\nKim has been increasingly vocal about XRP’s potential.\n\nEarlier this month, he wrote that the cryptocurrency may outperform precious metals in 2026, noting, “My prediction: XRP may outperform gold and silver in 2026.”\n\nHe added that while gold and silver were currently “pumping,” XRP would be “next.”\n\nThe comments mark a shift from Kim’s prior focus on Bitcoin, with whom he had previously engaged in frequent comparisons.\n\nHe has also suggested that XRP could approach $1,000 over the next decade under certain macroeconomic scenarios, citing a potential decline in the U.S. dollar and sustained inflation.\n\nThe predictions come as Ripple announced a significant regulatory milestone, obtaining approval for its Electronic Money Institution (EMI) licence and crypto asset registration from the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).\n\nThe new approvals allow Ripple to extend its licenced cross-border payments platform to U.K. institutions, enabling them to send international payments using digital assets efficiently.",

    "fullText": "A new year is often meant to symbolize fresh starts, but for one of America's most recognizable casual dining brands, 2024 delivered the opposite. Instead of renewal, the year was marked by financial troubles, bankruptcy, and a significant loss of its domestic and international footprints.\n\nFounded in 1965 in New York City, this restaurant chain became a household name by serving classic American bar food and offering popular happy hour drink deals intended to make every day feel like a Friday. For decades, the brand portrayed itself as a lively escape where guests could relax, enjoy indulgent food, and unwind.\n\nBut behind that image, the chain had been quietly struggling with years of declining sales and rising costs. Those pressures ultimately reached a tipping point, leaving the company unable to sustain its financial obligations.\n\nIn early 2024, TGI Fridays began closing dozens of underperforming restaurants nationwide, describing the move as a strategic effort to streamline operations and position the brand for long-term growth. However, the closures continued throughout the year, reaching around 50 locations before the company made the announcement it had long feared would come.\n\nIn November of that same year, TGI Fridays filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, citing $37 million in debt. In the court filings, the company attributed much of its financial collapse to the COVID-19 pandemic, which forced it to temporarily close restaurants and suffer the aftermath of consumers' cautious spending.\n\nThe bankruptcy filing applied only to company-owned restaurants, not franchise locations. TGI Fridays secured debtor-in-possession financing, allowing restaurants to remain open and continue normal operations during the restructuring process.\n\nAt the time of the filing, the brand operated fewer than 40 company-owned restaurants in the U.S., alongside 120 domestic franchise locations, and 316 international units.\n\nTGI Fridays' struggles expanded beyond the U.S. In September 2024, Hostmore PLC, the brand's UK franchisee, filed for administration, the UK equivalent of bankruptcy, putting 87 restaurants at risk of closure.\n\nA month later, investment firms Breal Capital and Calveton acquired the UK business, preventing the brand from disappearing from the region entirely. The deal saved 51 locations and thousands of jobs, though 35 restaurants ultimately closed and more than 1,000 employees were laid off.\n\n53-year-old restaurant chain is quietly closing locations nationwide\n\nDunkin’ copies trendy Starbucks menu move\n\nChick-fil-A made a major change to its chicken, fans are noticing",

    "fullText": "On Sunday evening, Milos Raonic announced his retirement from professional tennis.\n\nThe former world number three made the announcement on his social media accounts, calling tennis his ‘love and obsession.’\n\nRaonic is one of the greatest players in Canadian tennis history; a player who possessed an almost unreturnable serve and a steely demeanour on court.\n\nThe 35-year-old reached his one Grand Slam final at the 2016 Wimbledon Championships, where he lost to Andy Murray in straight sets.\n\nFollowing his announcement, various high-profile tennis figures have sent Raonic messages celebrating the Canadian star’s career.\n\nIn a post on X [formerly Twitter], three-time Wimbledon champion Boris Becker sent a congratulatory message to the 35-year-old Canadian superstar.\n\nBecker [pictured below] said: “Congratulations Milos on a fabulous tennis career! Good luck on your next chapter!”\n\nRaonic won 23 ATP Tour titles during his career; however, he was never able to win one of the major titles.’\n\nAlong with his one Grand Slam final loss, Raonic also lost all four of his Masters 1000 final appearances.\n\nTo be fair to the Canadian star, all of his Masters 1000 final losses came against either Novak Djokovic or Rafael Nadal – two of the greatest players in tennis history.\n\nIvan Ljubicic, the former coach of Roger Federer, has also sent a message to Raonic via Instagram.\n\nHe said: “Congrats on your impressive career! Everyone knows your future will be even more successful. Happy retirement, Milos!”\n\nLjubicic and Raonic worked together for two-and-a-half years before parting ways in November 2015.\n\nAfter they split, Raonic thanked the experienced coach for his help.\n\nAs per Tennis.com, Raonic said: “I’d like to thank Ivan Ljubicic for the tremendous amount of support, knowledge and understanding he has given me.\n\n“The decision has been made that we will not continue our professional relationship in the coming year.”",

The balls are hugging the rail. The top slates need levelling up. The table fitters need to go out and check the level of the top slate.\n\n\"If those balls are hugging that top rail, then it's going to make the game incredibly easy to make big breaks. It's also wrong that a ball should go in that easily. This looks like it's not level.\"\n\nIn response, the organisers of the invitation-only Masters, which typically features only the top-16 ranked players in the world, said: \"The table is checked before, during and after every match, as is standard at any event.\n\n\"We strive to provide the best possible playing conditions and our team of expert table fitters do a fantastic job.\"",

    "description": "Lower Chinese LNG demand could pressure global markets, especially as new U.S. and Qatari capacity comes online and Russian pipeline and LNG exports to China increase.",
    "fullText": "China is boosting domestic natural gas production, and it is doing it fast. A major LNG consumer—and importer—the country has been key in LNG demand forecasts. Now, these forecasts will need to be revised.\n\nLess than ten years ago, China was struggling to get its domestic gas production off the ground, especially in shale formations. China’s shale geology is different from the U.S. basins, and energy companies were finding it difficult to get commercial production going. Now, China’s state oil and gas majors are pumping more gas than ever and announcing new discoveries in the shale patch.\n\nIn November last year, China produced 22.1 billion cu m, which was a 7.1% increase on the year, Kpler reported this month citing official production data. The increase was driven by “faster-than-expected shale gas ramp-ups in the Sichuan Basin.” Based on that data, the energy analytics firm expects China’s total for 2025 to reach 263 billion cu m, rising to 278.5 billion cu m this year, again thanks to growing shale gas production in the Sichuan and Shanxi basins.\n\nAs with oil, rising domestic production would inevitably affect imports, even as China leans more heavily on natural gas for emission-reduction purposes. Last year, for instance, China booked higher domestic gas production and a rather substantial decline in LNG imports. In fact, imports of liquefied gas last year fell to the lowest in six years after a string of 12 monthly declines in a row. Imports only rebounded at the end of the year but not enough to reverse the decline. Kpler has predicted that Chinese demand for liquefied natural gas is going to decline this year as well, with shale gas production removing some 600,000 tons of LNG demand, reducing the total to 73.9 million tons.\n\nNow, 600,000 tons is not a whole lot in the context of a market where the United States alone exported over 100 million tons last year. But it does serve as yet another evidence of a trend in China to reduce dependence on energy imports, which has implications for global energy commodity markets that have gotten used to relying on China as the ultimate driver of demand.\n\nThe projected decline in China’s demand for gas—and by extension LNG—may interfere with new LNG capacity addition plans and prices, shrinking producers’ profits. It is these plans for a wave of new LNG supply, set to come online by the end of the decade, mostly from the top exporters, the United States and Qatar, that have prompted many analysts to expect an oversupplied LNG market by 2030 that would weigh on prices.",

    "description": "The restaurant industry is grappling with big questions about consumer behavior, efficiency, and labor this year, analysts told Business Insider.",
    "fullText": "The restaurant industry is grappling with big questions this year.\n\nDiners these days are more value-conscious, more selective, and more willing to stay home; and costs, along with competition, continue to rise for operators.\n\nAs big chains and local independents try to protect sales or regain their footing, analysts who spoke to Business Insider said the year ahead will come down to whether restaurants can do more with less, without losing what made people want to dine out in the first place.\n\nThese are the biggest questions shaping the restaurant industry's next chapter.\n\n\"Consumers are looking for value, but they're also cutting back on frequency — restaurants across the spectrum have to improve quality and the dining experience while controlling costs to maintain all-important same-store sales metrics,\" Asit Sharma, analyst for The Motley Fool, said. \"That's a difficult challenge against a backdrop of food and wage inflation.\"\n\nOperators are trying to understand their customers' restaurant and dining behaviors better in order to determine what they value most, and adjust their strategy accordingly, Michael Della Penna, the chief strategy officer at the digital advertising research firm InMarket, said.\n\n\"Restaurants think their biggest competition is the restaurant down the street,\" Della Penna said. \"In reality, competition today is far broader and more fragmented. Consumers aren't just choosing between restaurants anymore — they're deciding whether to eat out at all.\"\n\nMany brands are using limited-time offers or collectible promotions to drive repeat visits, app downloads, and loyalty program sign-ups, in attempts to connect more deeply with their customers, Evert Gruyaert, the restaurants and food service leader at Deloitte US, told Business Insider.\n\nStarbucks' viral collectible Bearista cup and Chipotle's protein snack cup launch are prime examples.\n\nHowever, Gruyaert said, the question is bigger than a simple limited-time offer. Restaurant operators are trying to identify why their brand resonates with consumers, which means aligning with a broader mission.\n\n\"Something that remains always relevant is: how do we do the right thing around, for instance, sustainability? How do we source more of our ingredients locally?\" he said. \"Because that has a cost efficiency, but it also plays into some expectations from our consumers.\"\n\n\"Restaurants are very hesitant to increase menu prices much more than they feel is reasonable,\" Moutray said. \"However, they still have to make the math work, right?\"\n\nSo, whether restaurants are adopting more technology — be it AI or other automation — or seeking alternative solutions to reduce costs, Moutray said efficiency is an \"ongoing battle\" for the industry.\n\nAI has become a buzzword in the restaurant space, but it remains an integral part of the conversation, Moutray said.\n\n\"You're seeing a lot of new technologies that are helping to speed up service, and make life a little bit more efficient, and hopefully improve the bottom line well,\" Moutray said.\n\nVoice AI integration is being continuously implemented at drive-thrus, and back-end systems are being overhauled for inventory and staffing purposes. New consumer-facing tech stacks are being rolled out, but it's not yet clear what the gold standards across the industry will be.\n\n\"Five years from today, whether it's a Michelin-starred restaurant with a single location, or a burgeoning brand capitalizing on the latest food trend, the average restaurant will be much more analytics-driven versus today,\" Sharma said.\n\n\"Labor, labor, labor,\" is top of mind for restaurants because of the industry's high turnover, Gruyaert said.\n\nExpectations from talent are also changing, Gruyaert said. The minimum wage continues to increase, and workers are seeking more flexibility in their jobs, which creates more competition among restaurants.\n\n\"So, the question is: how do you keep funneling that pipeline of talent and keep people close to you as a brand?\" Gruyaert said.\n\nMoutray said the industry will likely continue to see more consolidation this year as companies look to cut costs.\n\nSharma said smaller steakhouse chains with high fixed costs and operational inefficiencies are most at risk for closures and consolidations due to relentless beef inflation, coupled with their lack of purchasing power with suppliers, which he said \"creates a profit real headwind, and these models will get sorely tested in 2026.\"\n\nIt's not all doom and gloom. Some brands, such as Jollibee, are looking to go public — and more may be on the horizon.\n\n\"You still have a lot of focus on closures, but the reality is that we still have a lot of folks who are opening, as well,\" Moutray said.\n\nWith high labor, food, and packaging costs, many restaurant brands are closely monitoring their bottom lines while investing in upgrades.\n\n\"Slimmer profit margins are translating into lower free cash flow, but whether it's upgraded point of sales systems with rich data analytics for independent restaurants, or kitchen automation for chains, it's clear that technology investments will be critical for improving restaurant-level and overhead margins in the coming years,\" Sharma said.\n\nSharma said fast casual chains that can monitor inventory levels at restaurants in real time, and react quickly and efficiently through centralized ingredient kitchens, like Cava, have \"a real edge in this cost environment.\"\n\nSimilarly, quick-service restaurants with consistent, simple menus like Chick-fil-A, along with comfort food concepts that have low overhead and tech stacks purpose-built to accommodate digital orders, like Wingstop, are likely to see financial gains this year, Sharma said.\n\nUltimately, the questions facing the industry boil down to one key issue: growth.\n\nEach of the analysts who spoke to Business Insider said that's the core issue facing restaurants this year, as consumer tastes change, food and labor prices increase, and technology continues to advance.\n\n\"The No. 1 thing it's all about is how do you drive growth in this environment?\" Gruyaert said. \"That's the big question.\"",

The highly positive perspectives of these leaders on AI may suggest that the party can go on—high valuations of AI vendors, rising stock prices, a boom in data center construction, and initiatives to transform organizations around AI’s capabilities.

    "fullText": "Canada's decision to withdraw athletes from the North American Cup at Lake Placid on Sunday - a move which USA slider Katie Uhlaender claims cost her a spot at next month's Winter Olympics - is being investigated by the International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation.\n\nUhlaender, 41, a double world champion in 2012, was hoping to pick up enough ranking points to qualify for a sixth Games before the 18 January deadline.\n\nShe won the development race but Canada's move to pull four athletes out reduced the field to less than 21, reducing the number of points available and ending Uhlaender's chances of competing at Milan-Cortina.\n\nUhlaender claims she was told of the plan by Canada coach Joe Cecchini on Friday and in quotes reported by DW said: , external\"I cried when I found out he went through with this plan.\n\n\"I didn't know if it hurt more that my friend of 20 years just nailed my coffin, my Olympic dream is over. Or, that my best friend of 20 years is doing something so horrible that hurts so many people.\"\n\nBobsleigh Canada Skeleton (BCS) said the decision to withdraw the athletes was made \"after careful evaluation of the program's needs and in consultation with the IBSF\".\n\nBCS added that it \"remains confident that its actions were appropriate, transparent, and aligned with both athlete welfare and the integrity of the sport\".\n\nThe BCS said decisions around competition participation are made with \"careful consideration of athlete health, safety, and long-term development\".\n\n\"It was determined that continuing to race these athletes was not in their best interests, nor in the best interests of the program,\" it added.\n\nThe national body acknowledged that the move had an \"unintended impact on the size of the field and, consequently, the number of development points allocated for the event\".\n\nBut it added: \"It is well understood within the sport that development circuits do not carry fixed points. The National Skeleton Program has always treated the development circuit as exactly that - a developmental environment - not a pathway for Olympic qualification.\n\n\"The health, safety, and long-term development of our athletes remain our highest priority. Bobsleigh Canada Skeleton takes great pride in its commitment to fair, equitable competition while respecting International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation (IBSF) rules and standards.\"\n\nThe IBSF told BBC Sport: \"We have requested the IBSF Integrity Unit to investigate in the incident.\"\n\nA USA Bobsled/Skeleton spokesperson welcomed the IBSF review and said: \"USA Bobsled/Skeleton is committed to fair play and to protecting the rights of athletes.\n\n\"At the same time, we recognise the importance of maintaining positive and respectful international relationships within our sport.\"",

    "fullText": "For Philadelphia Eagles fans hoping to see A.J. Brown stick with the franchise after a tumultuous season, the events during and after Sunday's Wild Card Round loss to the San Francisco 49ers could not have been reassuring.\n\nBrown, a three-time All-Pro and three-time Pro Bowl selection, has tallied 1,000-or-more receiving yards in six of his seven seasons in the league and has been crucial to the team's success in recent seasons. However, after expressing frustrations with his usage on social media earlier this season, things took a turn for the worse during the 23-19 loss to the 49ers on Sunday.\n\nBrown had multiple dropped passes on Sunday, only hauling in three receptions for 25 yards, and at one point, head coach Nick Sirianni sprinted down the field to confront Brown after he wasn't leaving the field as the Eagles attempted to punt. This sparked a face-to-face confrontation, during which the two heatedly exchanged words before being separated. Sirianni told reporters on the sidelines that \"emotions run high\" and that \"we're fine\" before diving into the confrontation in more detail after the game.\n\nAnother look at the exchange between AJ Brown and HC Nick Sirianni on the sideline. pic.twitter.com/Syn0hr0MFK\n\n— FOX Sports: NFL (@NFLonFOX) January 11, 2026\n\n“I love A.J. I think he knows how I feel about him,\" Sirianni said. \"I have a special relationship with him. We’ve probably went through every emotion you can possibly have together. We’ve laughed together, we’ve cried together, we’ve yelled at each other. We’re both emotional...that happens in this game.”\n\nBrown declined to speak with the press following the game in the locker room – he went around the locker room giving multiple teammates hugs before immediately departing the team's facilities.\n\nA.J. Brown just went around to a bunch of teammates in the locker room, hugged them, and bounced.\n\n— Jimmy Kempski (@JimmyKempski) January 12, 2026\n\nThe day's events, both on the sidelines and after the game, suggest that Brown may not feel that his previous issues have been resolved with the Eagles, and in particular, his pot-game response to the situation indicates a player who could be convinced his tenure with the franchise may soon be coming to an end.\n\nBrown, who has been with the Eagles for four seasons after starting his career with the Titans, signed an extension in 2024 that keeps him under contract through the 2029 season. Keep an eye on Brown's situation, as another trade could be in his future.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Touchdown Wire: A.J. Brown's future with Eagles in doubt after Wild Card loss.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump says US companies will now have access to Venezuela’s vast oil reserves. But the country’s other commodities have also caught his administration’s attention.\n\nVenezuela has unverified amounts of minerals, metals and potentially rare earth elements, experts say. These raw materials are indispensable for industries from defense to technology, and the administration has repeatedly stressed their importance for US national security.\n\nBut while Washington might aspire to secure Venezuela’s critical elements, it’s a tall order, experts say, and wouldn’t do much to bolster America’s supply chain.\n\nThe quantity and economic viability of Venezuela’s mineral resources are uncertain. Companies also face major risks mining in Venezuela without sustained security guarantees.\n\nMany of these regions have guerrilla soldiers and armed groups engaging in illegal gold mining, experts say. Energy-intensive rare earths mining can also harm the environment.\n\n“There is an awareness within the administration that even beyond oil, there’s wider natural resource value in the country,” said Reed Blakemore, director of research at the Atlantic Council Global Energy Center.\n\n“However, if we’re talking about the conditions under which we are able to exploit those mineral resources and bring them to market, it’s a much more challenging story,” Blakemore said. “And even, frankly, more challenging than the oil story.”\n\nEven if US companies were to try to mine Venezuela’s rare earths, getting them out of the ground is just one part of the process. Those materials are usually sent to China for refining.\n\nChina accounted for over 90% of global rare earths refining in 2024, according to the International Energy Agency. The country maintains a virtual monopoly in processing and refining the materials due to decades of government subsidies, industry expansion and lax environmental regulations.\n\nRare earths have become a major sticking point in US-China trade tensions. Beijing last year implemented some export controls on rare earths during trade spats, raising concerns about America’s lack of secure supply chains for these critical materials.\n\n“China still holds near-singular capacity to process rare earth metals, and that industrial and geopolitical edge cannot be overcome overnight,” said Joel Dodge, director of industrial policy and economic security at the Vanderbilt Policy Accelerator.\n\nThe US Geological Survey designates 60 “critical minerals” vital to economic and national security.",

Krishnan told Reuters that \"any legitimate concerns of the industry will be addressed with an open mind\", adding it was \"premature to read more into it\". A ministry spokesperson said it could not comment further due to ongoing consultation with tech companies on the proposals.\n\nONGOING TUG OF WAR OVER GOVERNMENT REQUIREMENTS\n\nApple, South Korea's Samsung, Google, China's Xiaomi and MAIT, the Indian ⁠industry group that represents the firms, did not respond ‌to requests for comment.\n\nIndian government requirements have irked technology firms before. Last month it revoked an order mandating a state-run cyber safety app on phones amid concerns over surveillance. But the government brushed aside lobbying last year and required rigorous testing for security ‍cameras over fears of Chinese spying.\n\nXiaomi and Samsung - whose phones use Google's Android operating system - hold 19% and 15%, respectively, of India's market share and Apple 5%, Counterpoint Research estimates.\n\nAmong the most sensitive requirements in the new Indian Telecom Security Assurance Requirements is access to source code - the underlying programming instructions that make phones work. This would be analysed and possibly ​tested at designated Indian labs, the documents show.\n\nThe Indian proposals also require companies to make software changes to allow pre-installed apps to be uninstalled and to ‌block apps from using cameras and microphones in the background to \"avoid malicious usage\".\n\n\"Industry raised concerns that globally security requirement have not been mandated by any country,\" said a December IT ministry document detailing meetings that officials held with Apple, Samsung, Google and Xiaomi.\n\nThe security standards, drafted in 2023, are in the spotlight now as the government is considering imposing them legally. IT ministry and tech executives are due to meet on Tuesday for more discussions, sources said.\n\nCOMPANIES SAY SOURCE CODE REVIEW, ANALYSIS 'NOT POSSIBLE'\n\nSmartphone makers closely guard their source code. Apple declined China's request for source code between 2014 and 2016, and U.S. law enforcement has also tried and failed to ⁠get it.\n\nIndia's proposals for \"vulnerability analysis\" and \"source code review\" would require smartphone makers to perform a \"complete ​security assessment\", after which test labs in India could check their claims through source code review and ​analysis.\n\n\"This is not possible ... due to secrecy and privacy,\" MAIT said in a confidential document drafted in response to the government proposal, and seen by Reuters. \"Major countries in the EU, North America, Australia and Africa do not mandate these requirements.\"\n\nMAIT asked the ministry last ‍week to drop the proposal, a source ⁠with direct knowledge said.\n\nThe Indian proposals would mandate automatic and periodic malware scanning on phones. Device makers would also have to inform the National Centre for Communication Security about major software updates and security patches before releasing them to users, and the centre would have the right to test them.\n\nMAIT's ⁠document says regular malware scanning significantly drains a phone's battery and seeking government approval for software updates is \"impractical\" as they need to be issued promptly.\n\nIndia also wants the phone's logs - digital records ‌of its system activity - to be stored for at least 12 months on the device.\n\n\"There is not enough room on device to store ‌1-year log events,\" MAIT said in the document.",

    "fullText": "SHIZUOKA, Japan, Jan 12 (Reuters) - A Japanese mining ship departed on Monday for a remote coral atoll to probe mud rich in rare earths, part of Tokyo's drive to curb its reliance on China for critical minerals as Beijing tightens supply.\n\nThe month-long mission of the test vessel Chikyu near Minamitori ​Island some 1,900 km (1,200 miles) southeast of Tokyo, will mark the world's first attempt to continuously lift rare-earth seabed sludge from 6 km (4 miles) deep onto a ‌ship.\n\nJapan, like its Western allies, has been reducing its dependence on China for the minerals vital to the production of cars, smartphones and military equipment, an effort that has taken on urgency amid a major diplomatic dispute with ‌Beijing.\n\n\"One of our missions is to build a supply chain for domestically produced rare earths to ensure a stable supply of minerals essential to industry,\" Shoichi Ishii, the head of the government-backed project told reporters last month, ahead of the vessel's departure from the port city of Shizuoka on a bright sunny day, with a snow-capped Mount Fuji in the background.\n\nREDUCING RELIANCE ON CHINA WON'T BE EASY\n\nChina last week banned exports of items destined for Japan's military that have civilian and military uses, including some critical minerals. The Wall Street Journal reported Beijing has also begun restricting rare-earth exports ⁠to Japan more broadly.\n\nJapan has condemned China's dual-use ban but declined ‌to comment on the report of a broader ban, which China has not confirmed or denied. Chinese state media, though, have said Beijing was weighing the measure.\n\nFinance ministers from the Group of Seven industrial powers will discuss rare-earth supplies at a meeting in Washington on Monday, sources familiar ‍with the matter told Reuters.\n\nJapan is no stranger to facing China's wrath over rare earths. In 2010, China held back exports following an incident near disputed islands in the East China Sea.\n\nSince then, Japan has reduced its reliance on China to 60% from 90% by investing in overseas projects like trading house Sojitz's tie-up with Australia's Lynas Rare Earths, and promoting rare-earths recycling and manufacturing processes that rely less on ​the minerals.\n\nThe Minamitori Island project, however, is the first to attempt to source rare earths domestically.\n\n\"The fundamental solution is to be able to produce rare earths inside Japan,\" said ‌Takahide Kiuchi, executive economist at Nomura Research Institute.\n\n\"If this new round of export controls ends up covering a lot of rare earths, Japanese companies will again make efforts to move away from China, but I don’t think it will be easy,\" he said.",

    "description": "Major gauges made slight losses as Wall Street prepares for a week of major releases against a backdrop of global volatility.",
    "fullText": "US stock futures dropped Sunday night as Wall Street reacted to the Trump administration opening a criminal investigation into Fed Chair Jerome Powell.\n\nDow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) and futures on the S&P 500 (ES=F) fell 0.5%. Contracts tied to the Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) slumped 0.8%.\n\nInvestors were rattled late Sunday evening after Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell released a statement revealing that the Department of Justice had subpoenaed the US central bank.\n\nIn an uncharacteristic video address, Powell stated \"the Department of Justice served the Federal Reserve with grand jury subpoenas, threatening a criminal indictment related to my testimony before the Senate Banking Committee last June.\"\n\nPowell claimed that the move was a direct attack for the setting of interest rates that \"serve the public\" rather than \"following the preferences of the President.\"\n\nThe tumultuous start follows a strong finish to last week, when stocks climbed to fresh record highs. Both the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and the Dow (^DJI) closed Friday at new peaks, extending a rally that pushed the S&P 500 up more than 1% for the week. The Dow and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) posted even stronger gains, rising 2.3% and 1.9%, respectively.\n\nThe significant escalation in Trump’s feud with the Fed chair comes as markets are bracing for the latest consumer inflation report, due Tuesday. The release comes on the heels of Friday’s December jobs report, which showed continued cooling in the labor market without signaling a sharp economic slowdown.\n\nTaken together, the data has reinforced expectations that the Federal Reserve will remain on hold for now, with CME FedWatch offering a 95% probability of rates staying the same.\n\nBeyond the economic calendar, geopolitical developments remain a wildcard. President Trump is reportedly weighing potential action involving Iran, while also escalating pressure on Cuba over Venezuelan oil shipments. Late last week, Trump also renewed controversial comments about Greenland, saying the US could pursue control of the Danish territory “whether they like it or not.”\n\nInvestors are now turning their attention to the first major catalysts of 2026: earnings season and key inflation data. Several of Wall Street’s biggest banks are set to report in the coming days, including JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Wells Fargo (WFC), Citigroup (C), Goldman Sachs (GS), and Morgan Stanley (MS).\n\nVISHNU VARATHAN, HEAD OF ⁠MACRO RESEARCH, ASIA EX-JAPAN, ‌MIZUHO, SINGAPORE\n\n\"The Fed independence question is now well and alive and maybe subject to re-evaluation every few meetings.\n\n\"I think ‍I'm still not sure how sustained and adversarial the attack on the Fed might be. There could be a scenario where Trump could still appoint someone with ​some credibility and allow this person to run the show - so ‌that's probably why markets aren't panicking as yet.\"\n\nANDREW LILLEY, CHIEF RATES STRATEGIST AT BARRENJOEY, SYDNEY\n\n\"Trump is pulling at the loose threads of central bank independence. I don't even believe that he expects that Chair Powell will be charged... The only reason that he's taking these steps is that ⁠he knows that he's not going to ​take control of the Fed, so he ​wants to exert as much undue pressure as he can.\n\n\"It is not good. Don't get me wrong, but I think ‍it will amount to ⁠nothing. Investors won't be happy about it, but it shows actually Trump has no other levers to pull. The cash rate ⁠will stay what the majority of the FOMC wants them to be.\"",

I was born in Montreal, Canada, speak French and English.\n\n“My mom was born in Toronto, Canada, and my grandparents are from the Philippines. My dad was born in Ecuador and that is why I speak Spanish.”\n\nFernandez is evidently a keen football fan, but it’s clear she made the right decision by moving into tennis.\n\nThe 23-year-old boasts five career titles on the WTA Tour, and once reached as high as number 13 in the world rankings.\n\nHer only Grand Slam final appearance came at the US Open back in 2021, when she lost out to Emma Raducanu.\n\nShe’s also experienced Grand Slam doubles heartache, having lost the 2023 French Open doubles final playing with Taylor Townsend.\n\nFernandez is currently ranked 22nd on the WTA Tour, and she will be the 22nd seed at the upcoming Australian Open.",

    "fullText": "Bokang Masunyane has shared his thoughts on reigning ONE Strawweight MMA world champion Joshua Pacio, praising both the Filipino’s character and his standing within the division.\n\nKnown for his speed and relentless pressure, Masunyane has built a reputation as one of the most exciting contenders in ONE Championship.\n\nBut before setting his sights on the title, the South African fighter made clear that his respect for Pacio runs deep — even as he plots his route toward the belt.\n\nMasunyane’s comments highlight the mutual admiration that exists among elite competitors, even when their goals inevitably collide inside the cage.\n\nSpeaking to ONE Championship, Masunyane said: “I like Pacio. He’s got a very good personality, he’s got a good heart, he’s a fan’s favorite in the division.”\n\nThe remark offered a glimpse into the sportsmanship often seen at the highest levels of MMA. While rivals in pursuit of the same prize, Masunyane’s tone reflected genuine appreciation for Pacio’s approach both inside and outside competition.\n\nPacio, who continues to defend his title with composure and skill, has long been viewed as one of the sport’s most respected champions. His balance of humility and confidence has made him a symbol of consistency for the Strawweight division.\n\nMasunyane’s praise reinforces how Pacio’s influence extends beyond his performances — shaping how upcoming contenders carry themselves in pursuit of the same success.\n\nStill, Masunyane made it clear that his admiration will not stop his ambition. “As a fighter, I’d like to fight as much as I can. Whoever wants to fight me on my way to the title.\n\n“They are standing in my way, and my goal is to get that title shot, so I’m going through everyone in this division,” he told ONE Championship.”\n\nThose words underline the determination driving Masunyane’s climb. Despite acknowledging Pacio’s qualities, his focus remains squarely on his own mission, earning the chance to face the champion in the near future.\n\nMasunyane’s steady rise has positioned him among the top contenders at Strawweight. If his performances continue to impress, the path he’s describing may soon lead directly to Pacio himself.\n\nFor now, respect defines their relationship. But in ONE Championship, respect and rivalry often walk the same line, and Masunyane seems ready to cross it when the opportunity comes.",

    "fullText": "Aryna Sabalenka has started 2026 in strong form, securing the Brisbane International title with a convincing performance.\n\nSabalenka, who also won the event in 2025, took down Marta Kostyuk 6-4, 6-3 in this year’s final.\n\nShe did not drop a set throughout the tournament and now holds 22 WTA Tour titles. It was another dominant week for Sabalenka, who continues to build her legacy on tour.\n\nSabalenka went into Brisbane as the top seed and made her way through a competitive draw that included wins over Madison Keys and Karolina Muchova before finishing with another strong showing against Kostyuk.\n\nSabalenka has since posted on social media to mark the occasion, sharing on Instagram: “Thank you Brisbane International for all the love, it feels so good to be back.\n\n“Gummy bears and playing doubles with Paula Badosa made this tournament even better. Australia, we are just getting started.”\n\nIn addition to her singles success, Sabalenka also teamed up with Paula Badosa in doubles play. The two, who share a strong friendship off the court, made an appearance together during the tournament.\n\nThey won their first match of the event but did not compete in their scheduled quarter-final shortly after.\n\nSabalenka’s words are bound to catch the attention of the rest of the WTA Tour, especially given how sharp she looks at this stage of the season.\n\nShe clearly enjoys playing in Australia, and her current form only adds to her reputation as a player who thrives in these conditions.\n\nAs the top seed, she is set to compete in the Australian Open, a hard-court event where she has secured two of her four Grand Slam titles.\n\nHaving also reached the 2025 final, the Belarusian lost to Madison Keys. Meanwhile, Sabalenka has now achieved a remarkable record in Australia, winning 38 of her past 40 matches.\n\nThis kind of consistency makes Sabalenka a strong contender for another title run, and few will be surprised if she lifts the trophy again.",

    "fullText": "The Apple iPhone is the most popular mobile phone line in the United States and one of the most popular series of devices in the world with an estimated 1.6 billion iPhone users across the globe. Unfortunately, many of those users are now at risk.\n\nOver the past few weeks, Apple has been issuing a warning about a security flaw that data shows would impact around half of those iPhone users, which is around 800 million.\n\nLate last month, Apple began warning users of two critical flaws found in WebKit, which is the browser engine that powers Safari and all browsers on iOS. The flaws left iPhone users vulnerable an \"extremely sophisticated attack\" which would targeting specific individuals.\n\nApple said that the critical flaw could allow hackers to be able to take control of an iPhone or iPad by using malicious websites on the compromised web browsers and trick the device into executing harmful instructions.\n\nThe flaw left users vulnerable to hackers who could potentially take controll of the iPhone or iPad or run code without your permission, possibly obtaining passwords or payment information.\n\nThe good news is that Apple has already created a patch to correct the vulnerability in its latest software update. However, those that have not installed the software update are vulnurable.\n\nForbes estimates that 50% of all eligible iPhone users have yet to upgrade from iOS 18 to iOS 26. Given that there are more than 1.6 billion iPhone users worldwide, this means that around 800 million devices are still vulnerable. StatCounter has an even more pessimistic view, estimating that just 20% of users have upgraded, which would leave more than 1.2 billion iPhone users vulnerable.\n\nAccording to Apple, the devices most at risk include the iPhone 11 and later, the iPad Pro 12.9-inch (3rd generation and later), and the iPad Pro 11-inch (1st generation and later). Other vulnerable models include the iPad Air (3rd generation and later), the iPad (8th generation and later), and the iPad mini (5th generation and later).\n\nUnfortunately, the only way to protect yourself from these vulnerabilities is upgrade to the latest version of iOS, which is iOS 26.2.\n\nWhile it was expected that Apple would make a security update for users wanting to stick with iOS 18 for a bit longer, that is no longer the case, as iOS 18.7.3 is not available unless you’re running an iPhone that can’t run iOS 26.\n\n“There’s no workaround or user behavior that meaningfully mitigates this risk,” says Keeper Security’s Darren Guccione, via Forbes.\n\nHe went on to explain that upgrading to the latest version of the software is \"the only effective defense. Once patches are public, the exposure window widens for anyone who delays updating.”\n\nThe good news is that installing the update is easy. In fact, for users with automatic updates enabled, the software should be up to date and the patch should already be installed.\n\nIf you do not have automatic updates enabled, you will need to manually download iOS 26.2 or iPadOS 26.2 through their device settings. In this case, users should simply open the \"settings\" app then click \"general\" followed by \"software update.\"",

    "description": "From Davos and the Super Bowl to Burning Man and St. Barts, see the predictable social calendar billionaires follow and how much it all costs.",
    "fullText": "Like wildebeest migrating across the plains of East Africa or monarch butterflies flying thousands of miles south every winter, billionaires are a remarkably predictable breed.\n\nThe world's nearly 3,000 billionaires follow a familiar annual circuit: cruising between vacation spots on superyachts, jetting to marquee sporting events, and suiting up for the same closed-door business conferences.\n\n\"Birds of a feather flock together,\" Doug Gollan, the founder of Private Jet Card Comparison, told Business Insider.\n\nEach year, private jets congregate at events like The Masters or Super Bowl, he said.\n\n2026 is no different. There will be the Davos and Sun Valley conferences, the FIFA World Cup, and the Monaco yacht show. In between, some billionaires may attend Art Basel or the Oscars.\n\nHere's a look at the 2026 billionaire calendar — and how much it would cost to join them.\n\nBusiness leaders and politicians gather at the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, to kick off their year with policy discussions, networking, and, if time allows, some ski runs.\n\nThis year's summit, which runs from January 19 to 23, is themed \"A Spirit of Dialogue.\" While speakers have not been announced, regular attendees include BlackRock CEO Larry Fink (a cochair of the WEF), Bridgewater founder Ray Dalio, and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff.\n\nAccess to the invite-only event can cost tens of thousands of dollars, and most of Davos' luxury hotels, such as the Steigenberger Grandhotel Belvédère and AlpenGold, are closed to the public.\n\nApartment rental rates typically jump during the event, with nearby units commanding at least four figures a night. The surge pricing also applies to food. With most of the restaurants booked up for conference events, you may be left paying $43 for a hot dog.\n\nNFL teams are popular toys of the ultrarich: Walmart's Rob Walton has the Broncos, hedge fund manager David Tepper owns the Panthers, Clark Hunt and his siblings control the Chiefs, and so on.\n\nThese billionaire owners — as well as billionaire fans and friends — flock to the Super Bowl, and this year's game on February 8 in Santa Clara, California, will be no exception.\n\n\"The Super Bowl is always a draw. It's an excuse to see the best of the best in terms of sports, parties, and entertainment,\" Elisabeth Brown, client manager at travel and lifestyle concierge company Knightsbridge Circle, told Business Insider.\n\nHost committees and travel agencies curate luxury experiences for the wealthiest football fans, which can cost six figures and include chartered jets, five-star accommodations, and access to the field after the game. Throughout the weekend, there are VIP parties featuring celebrity guests and billionaire hosts, like Fanatics CEO Michael Rubin, who's become known for his star-studded annual Super Bowl bash.\n\nThe most exclusive celebration of them all, though, is in the winning team's locker room. Just ask billionaire Jeffrey Lurie, whose Philadelphia Eagles snagged the trophy last year.\n\nAs Hollywood and the tech world become increasingly intertwined, the Academy Awards and the various events surrounding it have become a magnet for billionaires.\n\nOprah Winfrey took the stage at last year's ceremony to honor Quincy Jones, and the Vanity Fair Oscars Party drew Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez Bezos — Amazon produced nominee \"The Nickel Boys\" — as well as Alphabet cofounder Sergey Brin and Skims cofounder Kim Kardashian. Two other billionaires, Jay-Z and Beyoncé, typically throw a rival after-party at Chateau Marmont.\n\nThis year's Oscars, which will be held on March 15, are likely to draw a similarly monied crowd. Larry Ellison, whose son David Ellison leads the storied movie studio Paramount, may make an appearance, as may billionaires Steven Spielberg, who produced in Best Picture hopeful \"Hamnet,\" and James Cameron, director of \"Avatar: Fire and Ash.\"\n\nThe Masters Tournament, taking place from April 9 to 12 this year, kicks off the run of major professional golf championships and signals the start of spring for billionaires.\n\nEach year, hundreds of private aircraft land at the airports around Augusta. In past years, billionaires like former Nike CEO Phil Knight, hotelier Robert Rowling, and investor Herbert Allen Jr. have had their planes touch down. So has Tiger Woods, the only billionaire winner of The Masters.\n\nThe tournament's venue, the famously exclusive Augusta National Golf Club in Georgia, counts a number of billionaires among its members.\n\nWarren Buffett, Bill Gates, Warren Stephens, David Ziff, and Stanley Druckenmiller have belonged to the club, Bloomberg reported in 2015. It's invite-only, and new members can only join when existing ones leave.\n\nThe general public can spectate alongside some of the biggest names in business. Tickets for the Masters are available through a lottery system.\n\nEvery year, the Milken Institute, a think tank founded by billionaire investor Michael Milken, hosts the Milken Global Conference in Los Angeles.\n\nDubbed the Davos of the West Coast, Milken launched the summit in 1998 as a forum for discussions on economic and policy matters.\n\nWhile the program for this year's conference, running from May 3 to 6, has not been announced, last year, Henry Kravis, Bill Ackman, and Jensen Huang were among the billionaire speakers.\n\nThe event isn't technically invite-only; members of the public can pay $35,000 to support the Institute as a council member and receive complimentary admission.\n\nWhile billionaires tend to spend June in the Hamptons or on yachts crisscrossing the Mediterranean, this year, many are expected to head to arenas across North America for the FIFA World Cup.\n\n\"The big, big, big thing everybody's talking about and getting tickets for right now is the World Cup,\" Charlie Garcia, the founder of centimillionaire membership club R360, told Business Insider.\n\nThe soccer competition, which takes place every four years, starts in June and runs through early July. Tickets for the final at MetLife Stadium start at over $9,000 on the resale market.\n\nWhile the tournament organizes teams by country, many star players are signed to clubs owned by billionaires, including Todd Boehly and Mark Walter's Chelsea, Stan Kroenke's Arsenal, and John Henry's Liverpool.\n\nThere will likely be at least one billionaire on the field: Cristiano Ronaldo, who is set to play for Portugal.\n\nPrivate jets descend on the small town of Hailey, Idaho, every July for the Allen & Company Sun Valley Conference.\n\nSince 1983, boutique investment bank Allen & Co. — its president, Herbert Allen, is a billionaire himself — has hosted the event, which attracts the biggest and richest names in business, such as Jeff Bezos, Sam Altman, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, and Warren Buffett.\n\nThe conference has become known for the deals struck in between rounds of golf, guided hikes, and tennis matches. It's where Jeff Bezos snagged The Washington Post for $250 million in 2013 and where the seed for Disney's $19 billion acquisition of ABC was planted in 1995.\n\nLast year was no exception. David Ellison, the scion of billionaire Larry Ellison, met with Bari Weiss at the conference to discuss Paramount Skydance's potential purchase of The Free Press, The New York Times reported. In October, the $150 million deal was announced.\n\nThe vacation-cum-business-meeting is invite-only and pretty much restricted to masters of the universe. Security is strict, with even the press walled off from most of the wheeling and dealing.\n\nBurning Man — the anticapitalist art and music festival in the Nevada desert — has been a rite of passage for the tech elite for decades.\n\nGoogle cofounders Sergey Brin and Larry Page are longtime Burners — the festival inspired the very first Google Doodle — as is Eric Schmidt, Google's former CEO. Facebook cofounders Dustin Moskowitz and Mark Zuckerberg, and Uber cofounder Garrett Camp have also attended. Even Ray Dalio, the billionaire hedge fund manager, joined in 2019.\n\nLast year's festival, marked by storms in Black Rock City, drew fewer billionaires than in previous years.\n\nStill, hundreds of private planes flew into Burning Man's temporary airport during the festival. The starting price to charter a plane through Burner Express Air was $18,000, one way.\n\nThis year's festival runs from August 30 to September 7, with planning already underway by the Burning Man Project.\n\nThe coastline of Monte Carlo, already a haven for the ultrawealthy, becomes crowded with superyachts at the end of September for the Monaco Yacht Show, where billionaires scope out their new toys.\n\nThe 120-plus superyachts on display feature elevators, bars, spas, pools, gyms, hot tubs, and helipads, and were worth a combined $5 billion last year. Jet Skis and submersibles are popular add-ons.\n\nLast year's yacht show featured yachts owned by the likes of billionaires Denis O'Brien and Paul Fireman. The largest of them, Mar, is still listed for sale with an asking price of $230 million.\n\nIn the past, yachts owned by billionaires such as Paul Allen, Steve Wynn, and Sergey Brin have been exhibited at the show.\n\nThe Monaco Yacht Show is open to the public, with one-day passes starting at about $800.\n\nOctober presents numerous opportunities for the affluent to expand their art collections.\n\nFirst, the Frieze Art Fair and nearby Frieze Masters, held annually in London, focus on contemporary art and pre-21st-century art, respectively. In years past, collectors like Point72's Steve Cohen and Diamond titan Laurence Graff have been spotted there.\n\nShortly after, across the English Channel, is Art Basel Paris, a relatively new addition to the art fair circuit.\n\nLast year's fair drew James Murdoch, an investor in Art Basel's parent company, as well as Delphine Arnault, the daughter of Bernard, and billionaire art collector J. Tomilson Hill.\n\nA painting by Gerhard Richter marked the fair's biggest sale, fetching $23 million, and several works sold for seven-figure sums. Exactly which moneyed collectors are behind specific purchases tends to be kept under wraps.\n\nWhile the VIP previews, when most billionaires are spotted, are invite-only, anyone can buy tickets to these shows themselves, which begin on October 14 with the Frieze fairs.\n\nFormula 1 has become a passion for billionaires over the past couple of decades.\n\nThe racing business itself is owned by John Malone's Liberty Media, and nearly all of the teams are connected to billionaires through their ownership structures.\n\nThe various Grand Prix attract these wealthy owners and fans thanks to the races and parties. Monaco maybe a marquee of the F1 calendar, but newer events like the Las Vegas Grand Prix increasingly draw big names.\n\nLast year's race drew billionaires, including Beyoncé and Jay-Z, Magic Johnson, Fanatics founder and CEO Michael Rubin, and Aston Martin Team owner Laurence Stroll.\n\nThree-day passes for the Sin City heat, which runs from November 19 to 21 this year, started at $400 for general admission last year but rose considerably for various seating and package options.\n\nWhile Aspen and Vail remain billionaire favorites over the holidays, no destination is as popular as St. Barts when it comes to ringing in the new year.\n\nLast year, superyachts owned by the likes of David Geffen, Jerry Jones, and Eric Schmidt were moored off the Caribbean island's coast. Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez Bezos were seen partying at a beach club.\n\nFor those who don't stay on yachts, rooms at popular luxury hotels like Eden Rock and Cheval Blanc, owned by Bernard Arnault's LVMH, cost upward of $7,000 a night.\n\n\"There is nothing mass-market about it,\" Winston Chesterfield, the founder of Barton, a consulting firm focused on luxury and the wealthy, told Business Insider. \"It's impossible to be there unless you are really wealthy.\"",

    "title": "What it's like working as a private jet flight attendant who makes over $100,000 a year",
    "description": "Private jet flight attendant Kelley Lokensgard earns over $100,000 and travels the world for essentially free. But it is a lot of work and long hours.",
    "fullText": "\"I grocery shop the night before, then arrive two hours before the flight; I load my flower arrangements, prep my boarding appetizers, and touch up the cabin,\" Lokensgard, the chief cabin attendant at Silver Air Private Jets, told Business Insider. \"People don't realize how many fingerprints they leave behind.\"\n\nThat behind-the-scenes work is part of serving wealthy vacationers, business executives, and celebrities who expect flawless service and discretion.\n\nLokensgard, what started in 2021, said the job can be nonstop: she's on duty for up to 21 days a month, sometimes at a moment's notice, and is responsible for catering meals and tailoring each flight to client preferences.\n\nThis is a level of invisible labor that few people outside private aviation ever see; it's not the glitz and glamour that social media often portrays. But Lokensgard — whose background is in music, youth education, and fine dining — said she loves the grind.\n\n\"It's a lot of schlepping and problem-solving and delicate communication with a lot of moving parts and people; you have to be a laborer to want to do this job,\" she said. \"I can't imagine something that better suits my random scope of skills.\"\n\nPrivate flight attendants are a small but growing niche within aviation. Jobs, which are largely non-union, span from small and medium-sized private companies like Silver Air to mega operators like NetJets and VistaJet.\n\nWhile many roles offer full-time benefits, as in Lokensgard's case, others resemble gig work, which can allow for a flexible lifestyle but often comes with less predictability and fewer labor protections than at most US airlines.\n\nThe work often involves long, irregular hours, extended travel, and the demands of high-profile clients. And private flight attendants usually don't have access to the free standby flights that commercial crew typically enjoy — meaning they only fly if a seat is available.\n\nStill, there's a significant payoff. Lokensgard gets to see the world through the destinations of her clients — essentially for free — while earning much more than most of her airline counterparts.\n\nLokensgard, who lives in Los Angeles, earns in the low six figures, though she said some veteran, freelance, and specially skilled VIP cabin attendants can make as much as $350,000 annually. Glassdoor puts the nationwide median annual salary at about $94,000.\n\nTo prepare for her role, Lokensgard completed five days of training and an online course: \"There was so much to learn, it's professionalism, luxury, service, and safety,\" she said. Silver Air also sponsored culinary classes.\n\nHer training is far shorter than the weekslong courses commercial flight attendants must complete, though that's because the Federal Aviation Administration does not regulate corporate cabin attendant positions — its \"flight attendant\" rules apply to airlines and public charters, not private jets.\n\nThis means cabin training varies widely across private operators, though Lokensgard, as chief attendant, said she is incorporating more shadow flying and collaborative learning at her company.\n\nLokensgard spends most of her days on the Gulfstream G550, a giant multimillion-dollar private jet with a bedroom and enough range to travel across oceans and continents. The plane has an owner but is also managed by Silver Air as a rental; Lokensgard serves whoever is on board.\n\nShe said these often long flights mean she is away from home for days at a time and must work early and late hours. A flight from the Los Angeles-area Van Nuys Airport to Tokyo, for example, would take about 11 hours and involve at least two meal services, she said.\n\nLokensgard must organize catering for the passengers, but is regularly asked to cook. She'll meal-prep meats and vegetables the night before and has access to an approved skillet, oven, microwave, and chiller to work with on the plane.\n\n\"Sometimes our clients don't want catering, and I will be told, 'Hey, arrange steak, sushi, chicken tenders, french fries, salads, fruit platter, snacks, and desserts for the flight,'\" she said. \"I'll shop at Erewhon, or I'll ask a local steakhouse to sear a steak that I'll finish off on the plane. Your head just explodes with ideas.\"\n\nErewhon is the US' most expensive grocery store and a hotspot for the LA elite.\n\nBesides food service, Lokensgard said she must also perform safety checks, prepare meals for the pilots, and make the bed, among other duties. She added that there is surprisingly little time to rest, even on ultra-long-haul flights.\n\nOn the ground, Lokensgard is responsible for tasks like dishes, dry cleaning, and arranging catering for the next trip. After international flights, everyone clears customs, and Lokensgard must follow agricultural rules when disposing of food and trash.\n\nRest policies vary by operator. Lokensgard said her crew gets at least a day of rest after long-haul international flights; previously, Silver Air cabin attendants often finished such trips only to almost immediately hop on a commercial flight home. She receives a minimum of 10 hours of rest after shorter flights.\n\nLokensgard added that it sometimes makes more logistical sense for the crew to stay with the plane for a few days in its destination, giving her extra time to explore places ranging from major cities like London, New York City, and Nice to quaint ski towns in Austria.\n\n\"I make the most of it since we're sacrificing time away from our families and communities,\" she said. \"We explore, see museums, and eat amazing food.\" She also dedicates time to cultivating relationships with local chefs in the cities she visits for catering needs.\n\nOnce home, Lokensgard said the first thing she does is wash her clothes and repack her suitcase, adding that she keeps a spare uniform in her car: \"I have my road wardrobe and toiletries and my home ones.\"\n\nThat constant readiness is essential in private aviation.\n\nFor example, on one reserve day — when she's on standby for last-minute flights — Lokensgard was called at 6 a.m. for a flight that had to take off by 8:30 a.m. But the plane was departing from Teterboro Airport in New Jersey, at least 30 minutes from the crew's Manhattan hotel.\n\n\"We're ripping back the covers and packing our bags,\" she said. \"We're calling to get the fuel trucks ready; I'm DoorDashing food to the airport and studying the client's eight-page portfolio, but we were in the air by 8:26 a.m. That really built trust with the client.\"",

    "fullText": "The Chicago Bears continue to prove that they like to hibernate, but they do not die. After having six comeback wins in the regular season, they capped off yet another one in their postseason matchup against the Green Bay Packers, winning 31-27 in a stunning comeback victory to advance to the divisional round of the playoffs.\n\nThings looked bleak early, as the Bears fell behind 21-3 in the first half after Jordan Love threw three touchdown passes. The Bears offense sputtered too many times and failed to convert on multiple fourth downs as faith in the defense was at an all-time low. Things looked bleak, but the team didn't lose hope.\n\nQuarterback Caleb Williams and the defense rallied in the second half to turn the momentum, scoring 28 points to storm back and retake the lead. Key passes to Colston Loveland, DJ Moore, and Rome Odunze kept drives alive as the Bears took control of the game from the Packers. After Williams found Moore for the go-ahead score late in the fourth quarter, the Packers were unable to mount one more scoring drive.\n\nIt was the craziest comeback victory in a season full of them, and the NFL world took notice. Here is how social media reacted to the victory.\n\nTHE BOOGEYMAN IS DEAD \n\nTHE CURSE IS BROKEN \n\nBEN JOHNSON AND CALEB WILLIAMS JUST ENDED GREEN BAY’S SEASON IN YEAR ONE pic.twitter.com/7sjrEmk97D\n\n— Barstool Chicago (@barstoolchicago) January 11, 2026\n\n— Freezing Cold Takes (@OldTakesExposed) January 11, 2026\n\n— C.J.

Steinberg \n\n Working Paper 34627\n\n DOI 10.3386/w34627\n\n Issue Date January 2026\n\nWe study international spillovers of corporate tax reforms in a fragmented global tax regime. Using firm-level evidence on the 2017 U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) and a quantitative general-equilibrium model, we illustrate how multinational enterprises (MNEs) propagate local policy shocks throughout the global economy. Our framework emphasizes two key intrinsic properties of intangible capital: non-rivalry and mobile ownership. We find the TCJA generated positive outward spillovers: First, it boosted U.S. MNEs’ intangible investment, raising their foreign subsidiaries’ output. Second, it increased tangible investment of foreign MNEs’ U.S. subsidiaries, incentivizing them to expand intangible investment at home. Conversely, a Global Minimum Tax (GMT) implemented by the rest of the world generates negative inward spillovers for the United States, even if U.S.-parented MNEs are exempt. These findings illustrate that there is no such thing as a purely domestic corporate tax policy.\n\n Acknowledgements and Disclosures\n\nWe are grateful to the International Tax Policy Forum for financial support of this project.

    "fullText": "Italy legend Roberto Baggio still carries a ‘weight’ for missing a decisive penalty kick against Brazil in the 1994 World Cup Final: ‘I lost three World Cups on penalties, not easy to digest.’\n\nItaly legend Baggio said his penalty kick miss in the 1994 World Cup Final was “the greatest bitterness of my football career.”\n\n“I grew up with the dream of a World Cup Final against Brazil. I don’t have a clear memory of why this goal has stayed with me since I was very young, through my entire life,” Baggio told Forbes Italia via Gazzetta.\n\n“I have always considered myself an ordinary person. Just like everyone else. I never saw myself as special. I only had this uncontrollable passion for football. A passion that stirs something inside you from morning to night. I slept with the ball.\n\nItalian former football player Roberto Baggio (R) and Argentine-born Italian former football player, David Trezeguet (L) gesture before the beginning of the Argentina 2023 U-20 World Cup final match between Uruguay and Italy at the Estadio Unico Diego Armando Maradona stadium in La Plata, Argentina, on June 11, 2023. (Photo by Alejandro PAGNI / AFP) (Photo by ALEJANDRO PAGNI/AFP via Getty Images)\n\n“I would have given up everything else to win that World Cup. I was representing Italy. It was the goal I was always chasing. The last thought before going to sleep was how to win that World Cup. Maybe by scoring a bicycle kick.\n\n“Then it turned out in a way I never would have imagined, and I will never be able to forget it. Just one step away from the finish line. The greatest bitterness of my football career, an unbelievable personal tragedy, I still carry that weight inside me.”\n\nFLORENCE, ITALY – JUNE 03: Roberto Baggio looks on during a press conference at Centro Tecnico Federale di Coverciano on June 03, 2024 in Florence, Italy. (Photo by Claudio Villa/Getty Images)\n\nBaggio took part in three World Cups. The Azzurri finished third in 1990, runners-up in 1994 and were eliminated in the quarter-finals by eventual winners France in 1998.\n\n“I played in three World Cups. In Italy [1990], we finished third, winning six matches and drawing one. I lost three World Cups on penalties, not easy to digest,” he concluded.",

    "fullText": "Ireland's Department of Foreign Affairs has recalled nearly 13,000 passports after a software update caused a printing defect.\n\nThe printing error makes the documents non-compliant with international travel standards and potentially unreadable at automated border gates.\n\nThe government said the affected passports, issued between December 23 and January 6, may fail at eGates and border control systems worldwide, prompting a global alert through the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) and a mass re-issuance program.\n\n\"The Passport Office has confirmed that 12,904 Irish passports issued between 23 December 2025 and 6 January 2026 [inclusive] may not fully meet international travel standards,\" announced the government.\n\n\"The issue was caused by a software update, which could affect use at border control or eGates.\"\n\nHolders are being asked to return their passport books (and cards, where applicable) for free replacement, with new documents to be issued within approximately 10 working days.\n\n\"This will ensure that you do not face any issues with future travel. You do not need to reapply for a new passport,\" the official notice states.\n\nWhile the Department of Foreign Affairs has not explicitly specified where the missing \"IRL\" appears, the reference to ICAO compliance and potential failures at eGates strongly suggests the error affects the machine-readable zone (MRZ), where the three-letter issuing-state code is mandatory under ICAO Doc 9303.\n\nThe MRZ is the two-line block of text at the bottom of the passport's bio page that is scanned by airline systems, border control kiosks, and eGates. It encodes critical data such as the document type, issuing country, passport number, nationality, date of birth, and checksums used to verify the document's integrity.\n\nIf the issuing-state code \"IRL\" is missing or malformed in this zone, automated systems may reject the passport outright, even if the visual biographical page and embedded chip appear normal.\n\nThose travelling imminently or overseas residents can get in touch wih the Passport Office customer service via email at passportreturn@dfa.ie or call +353 (0) 1 613 1780.\n\nAs MCP (Model Context Protocol) becomes the standard for connecting LLMs to tools and data, security teams are moving fast to keep these new services safe.\n\nThis free cheat sheet outlines 7 best practices you can start using today.",

    "description": "\"We've now given decision-makers what they need to prepare.\"",
    "fullText": "The United Kingdom has not done enough to prepare for the impact of rising temperatures, and a study has shed light on the worst-case scenarios the government should plan for.\n\nAccording to The Guardian, the findings show exactly how the U.K. could be vulnerable to these risks.\n\nIt's hard to predict the probability of the worst-case scenarios because you can't calculate uncertainty. University of Reading professor and study lead Nigel Armell compared the analysis his team did to what the Bank of England does for the financial system.\n\nThe study, published in the journal Earth's Future, found multiple worst-case scenarios. One of them is where temperatures rise 4 degrees Celsius (7.2 degrees Fahrenheit) and the sea level rises 2 meters.\n\nRising temperatures are also weakening the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, or the  AMOC. If this starts to collapse in 2030, the U.K. would actually see a 6-degree Celsius (10.8-degree Fahrenheit) temperature drop. It would disrupt agriculture and water supply, while also putting a strain on energy demand in winter.\n\nAccording to The Guardian, the scientists said, \"A collapse of even one part of AMOC, the sub-polar gyre, would reduce U.K. temperatures by 2.5 degrees Celsius.\"\n\nIf the Amazon sees a mass die-off, releasing polluting gases into the atmosphere, this could send global temperatures 4 degrees Celsius higher by 2100.\n\nThe Guardian noted, \"This would result in extreme and prolonged heatwaves and droughts hitting the U.K. in summer.\"\n\nCutting industry pollutants too quickly can also have an effect, including a rise in temperature of 0.75 degrees Celsius (1.35 degrees Fahrenheit), because these pollutants block the sun.\n\nAnother worst-case scenario is extreme weather events. Temperatures could rise 6 degrees Celsius above the average, and rainfall could be triple the average.\n\nHow worried are you about rising ocean levels?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nWhile extreme weather events such as these were always going to happen, rising temperatures intensify them, as this worst-case scenario is showing.\n\nWhile sea levels are already higher, if Greenland and Antarctica's glaciers melt even more quickly by 2100, this would flood cities in the U.K. Rising sea levels are already on planners' minds, unlike the other scenarios.\n\nAdditionally, the global temperature rise of 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.34) has already seen many deaths during heatwaves.\n\nA 2021 House of Lords report indicated that the U.K. government was not giving sufficient attention to high-impact, low-likelihood worst-case scenarios.\n\nIn addition, the Climate Change Committee, an independent advisory group, said that the U.K. needs to adapt to a 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) rise, while assessing risks in case a 4 degrees Celsius rise happens. The 2023 adaptation plans were described as being weak.\n\nAccording to The Guardian, \"The research was commissioned by the Met Office as part of the government's climate resilience programme.\"\n\nIt's vital that this kind of research on climate issues continues to better understand how to prepare for these potentially dangerous scenarios.\n\n\"The U.K. has been planning without the tools to test against worst-case scenarios,\" said Armell. \"We've now given decision-makers what they need to prepare for climate outcomes they hope never happen, but can't afford to ignore.\"\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

We identify a dramatically different form of storage of atomic facts that we term as geometric memory. Here, the model has synthesized embeddings encoding novel global relationships between all entities, including ones that do not co-occur in training. Such storage is powerful: for instance, we show how it transforms a hard reasoning task involving an $\\ell$-fold composition into an easy-to-learn $1$-step navigation task.\n  From this phenomenon, we extract fundamental aspects of neural embedding geometries that are hard to explain.",

    "fullText": "On Jan. 7, the U.S. Supreme Court deferred ruling on the litigation challenging President Donald Trump's global tariffs\n\nThe new date for the next ruling is set for Jan. 14.\n\nWhen Trump announced sweeping \"reciprocal\" tariffs targeting countries across the world on Apr. 2, 2025, a day he dubbed \"Liberation Day,\" he invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).\n\nThe administration had argued that trade deficits constituted a national emergency and the president didn't need to consult with Congress to levy global tariffs.\n\nSeveral businesses affected by the decision and 12 U.S. states, mostly Democratic-governed, then went to the Supreme Court to challenge Trump's tariffs.\n\nIf the court rules that the president was wrong in invoking the emergency powers, the Trump administration will have to reimburse importers who already have paid the duties. The reimbursement is estimated to be more than $133.5 billion as per a Reuters report.\n\nBut the administration could get away with only limited repayments if the court decides to grant limited powers to the president under IEEPA.\n\nThe court's decision carries far-reaching implications for not only the global economy but also the crypto market.\n\nThe digital assets market got increasingly tied to Wall Street last year and Trump's tariff announcements frequently rattled the markets throughout 2025.\n\nIn fact, it was Trump's threat to hike tariffs on China on Oct. 10 last year that triggered the crypto flash crash in which more than $19 billion got wiped out in a day.\n\nWealthy trader moves millions ahead of Trump’s ‘big’ economic speech\n\nMysterious trader bets millions ahead of the Fed’s big announcement\n\nMysterious traders are selling ahead of Trump's 9PM address to the nation\n\nAhead of key policy announcements, mysterious crypto traders often place market orders and net millions of dollars.\n\nAs reported earlier, a trader made millions by shorting cryptocurrencies ahead of Trump's China announcement on Oct. 10.\n\nRecently, a crypto trader on Polymarket profited over $400,000 by betting on Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro's ouster.\n\nNotably, the trader had created his Polymarket account only a day earlier, triggering speculations of insider trading.\n\nOnce again, a crypto whale placed an order as markets buzzed with reports of a Supreme Court ruling expected on Jan. 9.",

    "title": "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang Warns Investors That the AI Market Is Bigger Than They Realize With Over ‘One and a Half Million AI Models in the World’",
    "description": "Jensen Huang explains artificial intelligence as a multi-layered platform, arguing its true impact extends far beyond consumer-facing language models.",
    "fullText": "Bottom Line Up Front: Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang, in his role as the leader of the primary company behind the ongoing technology movement, says that many people don’t realize just how big the AI revolution is. He says there are currently over 1.5 million AI models throughout the world, from healthcare and drug discovery to more commonly known names like Elon Musk’s Grok and Sam Altman’s ChatGPT.\n\nThe Details: Nvidia founder and chief executive Jensen Huang has consistently framed artificial intelligence as an infrastructure-scale transformation rather than a single technological breakthrough. In a fireside chat hosted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) with President and CEO Dr. John J. Hamre, Huang continued outlining his layered view of AI, emphasizing the systems, capital, and breadth of applications that underpin the technology’s long-term impact.\n\nJeff Bezos Launched a Secretive AI Startup in 2025 That Should Give Wall Street Chills\n\nThe Top-Rated Dividend King to Buy for 2026\n\nEvercore Analysts Love UnitedHealth Stock for 2026. Should You Buy UNH Here?\n\nTired of missing midday reversals? The FREE Barchart Brief newsletter keeps you in the know. \n\nBuilding on earlier discussion of energy, chips, and systems, Huang described the current infrastructure buildout of AI as being multi-layered. The first layer is simple: energy. Huang frames electricity buildout as the most fundamental part of the entire AI revolution.\n\nThe next is Nvidia itself: Chips. Without chips, there’s nothing to use electricity and process the AI compute needed to run the AI models.\n\nHuang then highlights the third layer, which “includes financial services, because it takes an enormous amount of capital to do what we do.” His remarks highlight that AI development at scale is not only a technical challenge, but also a financial one, requiring sustained investment in data centers, networking, and long-lived computing assets.\n\nHuang then turned to the fourth layer that receives the most public attention: the models themselves. He acknowledged the prominence of well-known systems, describing how “this is where people largely focus on when they talk about AI,” citing examples such as ChatGPT, Anthropic’s Claude, Google’s Gemini, and xAI’s Grok. However, he placed those systems in a much wider context, pointing out that “those are four of the one and a half million AI models in the world.” The statement reframes popular generative models as an incredibly small subset of a far larger and more diverse ecosystem. This statement diversifies the risk away from the larger, more broadly known AI models, and instead frames Nvidia as an infrastructure play amongst a technological revolution being implemented across every industry in the world.",

Without this, maybe I win the first set.\n\n“And same on the tiebreak, I think I made only two out of maybe five first serves. But second and third set, top-5 level, for sure.

    "description": "\"I believe that, within the next decade, we will not only get the world back on track but enter a new era of unprecedented progress,\" Gates wrote in his annual letter.",
    "fullText": "Last year didn’t go the way Bill Gates hoped. As a philanthropist who has dedicated billions to improving everything from healthcare and education in poor countries to climate change action, Gates could only watch as the Trump administration slashed swathes of foreign aid contracts. \n\nThe Microsoft co-founder has criticised the cost-cutting regime, much of which was enacted under Elon Musk’s Department Of Government Efficiency (DOGE). He warned the action could directly result in the death of children, a claim which Tesla CEO Musk demanded evidence.\n\nWriting in his annual letter this year, the Gates Foundation founder was optimistic but candid, writing: “I believe the world will keep improving—but it is harder to see that today than it has been in a long time.”\n\nHe added: “The thing I am most upset about is the fact that the world went backwards last year on a key metric of progress: the number of deaths of children under five years old. Over the last 25 years, those deaths went down faster than at any other point in history. But in 2025, they went up for the first time this century, from 4.6 million in 2024 to 4.8 million in 2025—an increase driven by less support from rich countries to poor countries.”\n\nLast month the Gates Foundation’s Goalkeepers Report revealed an additional 12.5 million child deaths could occur by 2045 if development assistance for health (including government spending) is reduced by 20% from 2024 levels, according to bespoke modelling based on data from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation.\n\n“Friends and colleagues often ask me how I stay optimistic in an era with so many challenges and so much polarization,” Gates wrote. “My answer is this: I am still an optimist because I see what innovation accelerated by artificial intelligence will bring.”\n\nBut, that optimism comes with a deadline, or as Gates puts it “there are footnotes to my optimism.”\n\n“The next five years will be difficult as we try to get back on track and work to scale up new lifesaving tools,” Gates continued. “As hard as last year was, I don’t believe we will slide back into the Dark Ages.”\n\n“I believe that, within the next decade, we will not only get the world back on track but enter a new era of unprecedented progress.”\n\nIn 2025, Gates announced his $200 billion moonshot: He was donating “virtually all [his] wealth”—about $100 billion—to his foundation. It was the largest philanthropic commitment in modern history, and came with strings attached. The funds (made up of its current endowment and projected growth) must be spent in the next 20 years.\n\nWhile Gates made the announcement this year, his intentions have been clear for many years. In 2010 Gates, his wife at the time Melinda French Gates, and Berkshire Hathaway co-founder Warren Buffett launched the Giving Pledge, making a public commitment to philanthropy, which has since been signed by the likes of philanthropist Mackenzie Scott and Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky.\n\nIn a bid to bridge a gap in government funding, Gates is calling on fellow wealthy philanthropists. He wrote: “This idea of treating others as you wish to be treated does not just apply to rich countries giving aid. It must also include philanthropy from the wealthy to help those in need—both domestically and globally—which should grow rapidly in a world with a record number of billionaires and even centibillionaires.”\n\nA report on billionaires from Oxfam, released most recently in January 2025, revealed that in 2024, the number of billionaires rose to 2,769, up from 2,565 a year prior. It also said it expects at least five people to reach trillionaire status a decade from now.\n\nGates added: “I know cuts won’t be reversed overnight, even though aid represented less than 1% of GDP even in the most generous countries. But it is critical that we restore some of the funding.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

    "description": "Stuart Brown has worked at Viking for nearly two decades.",
    "fullText": "Billionaire Andreas Halvorsen will soon lose another longtime lieutenant.\n\nStuart Brown, the longtime head of trading for Viking Global, is stepping down from the $55 billion asset manager to take a career break, two people familiar with the move told Business Insider. The firm declined to comment, and Brown could not be reached for comment.\n\nBrown was at the long-running Tiger Cub, a nickname for hedge funds that spun out of late billionaire Julian Robertson's Tiger Management, for 18 years, according to his bio on the firm's website. He joined the firm after working on the corporate credit sales desk at Credit Suisse.\n\nOne of the people close to the firm said Brown's official departure date is not yet known. Brown will help the firm during a transition period, this person said.\n\nViking has lost several senior members of its team in recent years, which now numbers 275 employees, according to the firm's site.\n\nFrom the investing side, Ning Jin, the former chief investment officer of Viking, left the firm in August 2024 to start his own fund, Avantyr Capital.\n\nOn the operations side of the business, the firm's former general counsel, Andrew Genser, joined former Viking portfolio manager Divya Nettimi's fund, Avala Global, last summer. Viking's director of recruiting, Kevin Curtis, moved to Bobby Jain's eponymous fund in September 2025, and the firm's former investor relations head, Savina Boyadjieva, just started as a partner at Joshua Kushner's Thrive Capital.\n\nWhile Viking's peers include long-short equity funds such as Tiger Global, Coatue, Lone Pine, D1, Maverick, and others, the firm is not as tech-heavy as some of the other Tiger Cubs. In some years, such as 2022, this can help the manager, but when mega-stocks like Nvidia, Amazon, and Microsoft drive a bulk of the market's returns, it can lead to Viking missing out on some gains.\n\nLast year was an example of this: Viking returned less than 9% on the year in its flagship fund, a person close to the manager said, less than the S&P 500 index.",
