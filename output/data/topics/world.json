    "fullText": "An elite downhill freeride racer says juggling training around a full-time apprenticeship can be a \"challenge\".\n\nBilly Pugh, 18, from Coleford, in the Forest of Dean, said while he tries to grab \"every moment he can\" to train, it can be hard around his work as an engineering apprentice at SPP Pumps.\n\nBilly has competed in a number of races, including Poland, Switzerland and France, and has his sights set on the iXS European Downhill Cup in Portugal in April.\n\nLiam Marley, a manager at SPP Pumps, said while he hoped Billy has a long career at the company, if he was to become a professional racer, they would \"pat him on the back and hope to see him winning some world championships\".\n\nPub's campaign to tackle rising costs goes national\n\nTeacher who lied about Cambridge degree banned\n\nNature plan to support beavers, bats and dormice\n\nMarley said Billy has a \"really good work ethic\" and the company were all \"so proud of him\".\n\nBilly first got on a bike as a three-year-old, with his balance bike going everywhere with him.\n\n\"It even came to weddings,\" said Matthew Pugh, Billy's father.\n\nMatthew, who is also a bike enthusiast, said he knew his son \"had something special\" when he first beat him in a downhill race as a 10-year-old.\n\nBilly later went on to work his way up through the ranks and started competing in races across the world.\n\nBut since starting his three-year apprenticeship a year and a half ago, Billy has had to find a way to fit in both.\n\n\"It can be quite tough at times. There's a lot of sacrifice to race at that level and work full-time,\" said Matthew.\n\nBut, for Billy, it is all worth it: \"The pure adrenaline rush that you get out of it just trying to go as fast as you can, it's really good fun,\" he said.\n\nBilly is one of 17 apprentices at SPP Pumps, who provide large water pump systems globally.\n\nMatthew said he felt it was important for his son to have a \"plan B\".\n\n\"In five years' time, he'll be a qualified engineer and he'll still be racing bikes,\" Matthew said.\n\n\"We hope he gets the best of both worlds,\" Matthew added.\n\nThe race season starts for Billy in April at the iXS European Downhill Cup in Portugal, with his eyes set on a place at the World Championships in South Korea later this year.\n\nFollow BBC Gloucestershire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "description": "Programme that funds groups building tech to evade oppressive government controls under serious threat",
    "fullText": "Programme that funds groups building tech to evade oppressive government controls under serious threat\n\nFor nearly two decades, the US quietly funded a global effort to keep the internet from splintering into fiefdoms run by authoritarian governments. Now that money is seriously threatened and a large part of it is already gone, putting into jeopardy internet freedoms around the world.\n\nManaged by the US state department and the US Agency for Global Media, the programme – broadly called Internet Freedom – funds small groups all over the world, from Iran to China to the Philippines, who built grassroots technologies to evade internet controls imposed by governments. It has dispensed well over $500m (£370m) in the past decade, according to an analysis by the Guardian, including $94m in 2024.\n\nThen came Doge, Donald Trump’s department of government efficiency, tasked with reducing the size of US government agencies and initiatives. Career employees who staffed Internet Freedom resigned or were sacked in 2025 as part of larger reductions. Many of its programmes were cut permanently; its main granting office issued no money in 2025. The Open Technology Fund (OTF), a nonprofit that works with the government to direct roughly half of this money, won a lawsuit to get some of this funding restored in December; the Trump administration is now appealing against that ruling.\n\nMeanwhile, the Trump administration this January withdrew from the Freedom Online Coalition, a global alliance set up by the US to defend digital rights.\n\nThe cuts risk curtailing technologies that helped Iranians to coordinate during recent anti-government protests, and that allowed videos and images of massacres to reach the outside world. They could have a major impact in other nations too; the efforts of groups in Myanmar to get past the junta’s “digital iron curtain”, and the ability of users in China to avoid surveillance.\n\n“The programme was effectively gutted,” said a former US official. “They didn’t issue any grants this year.”\n\n“I would like to live in a world where a single US programme is not such a linchpin, such a load-bearing programme, but it has been. It’s hard to deny it has been,” said one digital rights expert based in Europe who has worked on a number of projects for Internet Freedom.\n\nTo report this story, the Guardian spoke to 10 people with knowledge of Internet Freedom, including six of its grantees, and reviewed documents related to its operations and budget.\n\nThe US Department of State has been approached for comment. The OTF declined to comment.\n\nThe purpose of the programme was to make it extremely difficult to do what North Korea has accomplished through decades of censorship efforts, and what Iran succeeded in doing this January during a bloody crackdown on anti-government protests: cut an entire population off from the global internet.\n\nThe US aimed to circumvent this by funding groups capable of building and harnessing technologies that evade such restrictions and censorship. These include familiar tools, such as the encrypted messaging service Signal and the Tor browser, which allows users to be anonymous online.\n\nThey also include far more powerful tools. Advanced circumvention technologies can make it possible to get past even extremely powerful censorship regimes – to leap the firewall in China, for example, or to obtain international news in Iran even when mobile phone networks are out, through methods like satellite datacasting, in which data is broadcast in a similar way to television signal.\n\nAnother technology has allowed Iranians to securely communicate during recent anti-government protests, alerting each other to shootings and police presence, even as the rest of the internet has been cut off.\n\nThe soft-power aim behind this was to keep the internet as it is: mostly accessible, mostly a global commons. The groups it funded made censorship costly and difficult. “When you challenge censorship, the long-term effect is that oppressive governments must either open their internet, or to go in the direction of North Korea,” said the former US official.\n\n“But because each of those options is costly for them, they’ll keep trying to censor their networks so as to have the economic benefits of the internet without the drawbacks of freedom of speech and access to information. So the fight continues.”\n\n“Internet Freedom funded the development of many of the censorship-circumvention technologies that millions of people around the world depend on to maintain a link to the outside world,” said Doug Madory, an internet infrastructure expert who works closely with many of these groups.\n\nTheir makers are “often operating on a shoestring and passion. They believe in the cause. There’s no fancy offices, they’re working out of their apartments. It’s not a moneyed industry.”\n\nMost recipients of this money keep it quiet; it’s a dangerous thing, in some places, to take state department funds. But even as the funds run out, more and more organisations – journalists, activists, and civil society – are seeking out these technologies, and the groups that build them. Censorship regimes are getting worse worldwide.\n\n“It’s a massive blow. The need is bigger and other funding is also gone. Organisations that provide these tools are being overwhelmed,” said the digital rights expert. “It’s not sustainable.”\n\nSome of the groups working on these technologies have laid off staff; others are continuing without pay. A few hold out hope that some money can be restored – although they fear that the Trump administration might more overtly politicise its aims. While a recent appropriations bill contains a budget line for Internet Freedom, it names no specific programmes as recipients of this cash.\n\nOthers say they’re existing in a brief grace period as the rest of the funds run out.\n\n“Everybody’s just waiting right now, to be honest. But at the same time, wait at your own risk,” said an Iranian technologist funded through Internet Freedom.\n\nMeanwhile, censorship tech is growing cheaper and easier to access. Chinese companies have exported sophisticated middleboxes – devices that sit on network cables and allow authorities to monitor internet traffic – to countries across Africa and Asia in the past year. These allow regimes such as Iran’s to fine-tune their control over the domestic internet – allowing commerce to continue, for example, while communication is throttled.\n\nSeveral recipients of the US money expressed hope that Europe might fund these technologies in the future; some have already petitioned EU officials for funding.\n\nThe cuts “make it easier to build a ‘digital iron curtain’. It makes it easier for the Kremlin to put Russians in a digital information bubble that reinforces specific narratives about people outside of Russia. This makes it easier for China to do this. For Iran to do this,” one said.",

    "description": "Cade Smith will not be competing in the 2026 World Baseball Classic, instead focusing on the Cleveland Guardians' upcoming season.",
    "fullText": "Three years ago, before Cade Smith made his Major League debut or even threw a pitch for the Cleveland Guardians, he had the opportunity to compete for his home country of Canada in the 2023 World Baseball Classic.\n\nSince then, Cade has established himself as one of the best high-leverage relievers in MLB, and for the first time in his career, enter the season as Cleveland’s closer.\n\nHowever, Smith is not playing for Team Canada in the 2026 WBC. It was a decision that he recently told Foul Territory was his own as he heads into\n\n“It was my decision [to not play in the WBC], Cade said.\n\n“In ‘23, it was a phenomenal experience. Like, that was my first experience pitching in major league stadiums in front of sold-out crowds and that kind of environment. I had so much fun and enjoyed that. So, just this year, being at, kind of where things are architecturally, I didn't feel that it was wise for me to take that time away. I wanted to make sure that I was here and completely present and focused on the year coming up.”\n\nThe 2026 season will be Smith’s last year on a minimum MLB contract before his arbitration eligibility next winter. Considering that through his first two years, Smith has a 2.42 ERA, 0.95 WHIP, and 17 saves under his belt, he is in line for quite a large payday, even in his first year in the arbitration process.\n\nThat inevitable payday is contingent on one thing, though: health.\n\nSmith has pitched in 150 games through his first two big-league seasons. That’s a heavy workload for any pitcher in MLB, let alone one with an average fastball velocity of 96.4 mph.\n\nIt’s hard to blame Cade if he didn’t want to compete in the WBC because of this high workload, and solely focus on the upcoming season.\n\nPerhaps three years from now, in the 2029 WBC, Cade will get another chance to rep Candada, but for now, he’s concentrated on the Guardians.\n\nGuardians Roundtable also offers a fan community and message board.

    "fullText": "Ex-NBA star Enes Kanter Freedom piled on to the often-conservative criticism of freestyle skiing great Eileen Gu on Wednesday.\n\nGu, whose mother is Chinese, was born in San Francisco but is representing China for the second straight Winter Olympics.\n\nPolitics: Trump's Latest Epstein Denial Has Critics Asking New Questions\n\nShe has earned China two silver medals in the Milan Cortina Games with the halfpipe up next. She won two golds and a silver in 2022. She has vaulted to international fame as an athlete and sometimes a model, reportedly earning tens of millions of dollars a year ― a chunk of which she has received from the Chinese government.\n\nBut as in the last Winter Olympics, Gu has gotten heat for her choice, though it should be noted that several U.S.-born athletes compete for other countries. Brazil’s Lucas Pinheiro Braathen, who was born in Oslo but has a Brazilian mother, has been widely celebrated during the Games for representing a country other than his birthplace. Gu’s defenders have suggested that racism and Sinophobia are factors in why she is being treated differently.\n\n“I’m just going to say it. She’s a traitor,” Freedom told Fox News host Laura Ingraham on Wednesday. “She was born in America. She was raised in America, lives in America, and chooses to compete against her own country for, literally, the worst human rights abuser on the planet, China. She built her fame in a free country, and then chooses to represent an authoritarian regime.”\n\nKanter Freedom: Eileen Gu Is a traitor. She was born in America and chooses to compete against her own country. pic.twitter.com/gAh4YbrFpt\n\n— Acyn (@Acyn) February 18, 2026\n\nThe former center, who played for the Utah Jazz, New York Knicks and other teams in the NBA from 2011 to 2022, added “Freedom” to his name when he became a U.S. citizen in 2021. The former Turkish citizen was outspoken against the Turkish government and had his passport canceled by the country in 2017. He often speaks out against human rights abuses in China.\n\nBefore the Games, Gu defended her choice to represent China.\n\nPolitics: Money And Power Converge As CBS Becomes Trump State Media\n\n“The U.S. already has the representation,” Gu said, per Newsweek. “I like building my own pond.”\n\nShe also dismissed speculation that she chose China because the financial windfall was potentially greater.\n\n“I’m glad that there’s enough money in the sport now for people to think that’s a consideration,” Gu said.\n\nLike this article? Keep independent journalism alive. Support HuffPost.\n\nEven Vice President JD Vance weighed in about Gu’s decision, starting off diplomatically but eventually throwing some shade her way.\n\nAsked by Fox News’ Martha MacCallum on Tuesday if the status of the San Francisco-born athlete should be “changed,” the veep replied: “Well, look, I have no idea what her status should be. I think that’s ultimately up to the Olympics Committee. I won’t pretend to wade into that.”\n\nPolitics: Homeland Security Flack Tricia McLaughlin Set To Leave Trump Administration\n\n“I certainly think that somebody who grew up in the United States of America, who benefited from our education system, from the freedoms and liberties that make this country a great place, I would hope that they want to compete with the United States of America,” he added.\n\n“So, I’m going to root for American athletes, and I think part of that is people who identify themselves as Americans. That’s who I’m rooting for this Olympics,” Vance said.\n\nFox News Host Asks Vance If U.S.-Born Olympian Should Lose ‘Status’ Skiing For China\n\nOlympian's *** Confession Spreads To Another Sport In Wild 'Late Show' Send-Up\n\nItaly Taunts U.S. In Oh-So-Familiar Style After Winning Speedskating Team Event",

    "fullText": "CORTINA D'AMPEZZO, Italy (AP) — Tennis player Alexandra Eala was a fan favorite at the Australian Open. Gymnast Carlos Yulo won two gold medals at the Paris Olympics.\n\nAnd now Alpine skier Tallulah Proulx has become the first female athlete from the Philippines to compete in the Winter Olympics — and at 17, the youngest ever from the Southeast Asian country.\n\n“This is a new era for the Philippines and sports on the global stage and I really am grateful that I get to be a part of it,” the U.S.-born Proulx said as she finished 50th in the slalom at the Milan Cortina Games on Wednesday after carrying her country’s flag during the opening ceremony.\n\nShe was 52nd in the giant slalom.\n\nProulx grew up skiing at the Sierra Tahoe resort in California, then moved at age 7 to Iowa and raced at tiny Sundown Mountain before moving on Colorado and then settling in Park City, Utah, where she now resides.\n\nProulx’s father is from the Eastern Samar province in the Philippines’ Eastern Visayas region.\n\n“And I have a lot of relatives, family back there and honestly the response has been so heartwarming,” Proulx said. “Filipinos are just such warm and welcoming people. … I think that’s what makes us really strong and I’m so grateful that I get to be the first Filipina because I show that others can follow in my footsteps and hopefully get more involved into winter sports, which I know is quite hard in the Philippines.”\n\nProulx was slated to visit the Philippines for the first time a few years ago before her trip got canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Still, she has emersed herself in the country’s culture, thanks to her grandmother.\n\n“Me and my brother grew up with her cooking — all of course the delicious Filipino food and sharing her culture,” Proulx said. “Unfortunately, last year she passed away. … I really wanted to push for this and wanted to represent such an important part of my heritage, both for her and for myself.”\n\nIn Cortina, Proulx traded pins with American slalom standout Paula Moltzan and got a picture with slalom gold medalist Mikaela Shiffrin.\n\n“It’s amazing being around these people that I’ve looked up to my whole life,” she said, “and then realize I’m skiing that course next.”\n\nNext up for Proulx: a trip to the Philippines.\n\nAP Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics",

    "fullText": "Feb 18 (Reuters) - Chinese and Indian tourists are set to make up for a potential slowdown in growth from U.S. travellers to Europe ‌this year, according to data published on Wednesday by the European Travel Commission, ‌with international arrivals to the continent set to rise by 6.2%.\n\nThis is the first sign of a slowdown ​in the post-pandemic boom in American travel to Europe, driven by a strong U.S. dollar and economic resilience in North America.\n\nAn earlier study from industry group the European Travel Commission showed that Americans were less intent on travelling to Europe in 2026 than in 2025, a ‌trend driven by worsening economic concerns ⁠and geopolitical instability.\n\nWhile Chinese arrivals to Europe are set to rise by 28% compared to 2025 and Indian arrivals to climb by 9%, ⁠traveller numbers from the Americas were seen growing by just 4.2%.\n\nAccording to data from aviation intelligence platform Cirium, bookings from Europe to the U.S. between October 7 and end January fell ​14.2% year-on-year, ​while bookings from the U.S. to Europe slid ​7.3%.\n\nDespite a tempering of interest from ‌core American travellers, Europe is still seeing a steady rise in both long-haul travellers and in spending, showing that tourists who still want to come are more focused on high-value experiences that can keep the European travel market steady.\n\n\"Europe continues to stand out as a reliable destination, well-positioned to respond to evolving demand for more flexible travel and experience-led ‌journeys,\" said Miguel Sanz, head of the European ​Travel Commission, in a statement.\n\n\"Particularly encouraging is the fact ​that growth in traveller spending is ​outpacing that of arrivals, allowing destinations to focus more on value than ‌volume.\"\n\nTravel spending in Europe is set to ​have risen by 9.7% ​in 2025, according to the new report.\n\nThat is in line with reports from Europe's major carriers, including Lufthansa and Air France-KLM, of a steady rise in ​bookings for their premium offerings, ‌while economy cabin bookings for transatlantic travel have fallen.\n\nAir France-KLM reports its full-year ​results for 2025 on Thursday.",

    "description": "The ‘Ain Braq aqueduct, which runs through the Jabal al-Madhbah massif into Petra, was even more sophisticated than scientists previously believed.",
    "fullText": "Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nThe ‘Ain Braq aqueduct, which supplied water to ancient Petra, was thought to have only one conduit, or channel, until the recent discovery of a second one.\n\nAlthough most of the lead pipe is no longer present in the conduit, its former extent can be inferred by matching its imprint to still-extant lead pipe fragments in the area.\n\nLong and narrow, this pipe was most likely used as an inverted siphon, with water passing through a header tank before it flowed through to a series of reservoirs.\n\nThe importance of finding water supplies in a harsh desert climate is a central theme in Frank Herbert's classic science-fiction novel Dune (and in its latest film adaptation by Denis Villeneuve). Rising from dusty sands and carved out of red sandstone, Jordan’s ancient city of Petra is reminiscent of the desert landscapes and stone edifices of Herbert's faraway science-fiction desert planet. But Petra already had aqueducts and water systems thousands of years ago that were far ahead of any on fictional Arrakis—so no one in Petra ever needed a stillsuit to survive.\n\nPetra was an urban hub of the ancient world despite its location in a semiarid climate that brought hardly any rain. It stood as the capital of the Nabatean kingdom until it became part of the Roman province of Arabia in the early 2nd century C.E. As an important administrative and trading center, Petra needed water for purposes beyond keeping its people alive. Its hydraulic systems filled baths, kept gardens and agriculture thriving, gushed from a sacred fountain known as a nymphaeum, and filled up basins in temples, sanctuaries, and tombs. Now, on the abandoned city’s southeast edge, archaeologists have discovered that the ‘Ain Braq aqueduct running through the Jabal al-Madhbah massif into Petra was even more sophisticated than they previously believed.\n\nAs part of a 2023 excavation conducted as part of the Urban Development of Ancient Petra project, a research team led by Niklas Jungmann of the Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin studied the system that brought water into Petra. These included cisterns, basins, a reservoir with a dam, and the ‘Ain Braq aqueduct. In the course of their research, Jungmann and his team discovered something that the aqueduct had been hiding for millennia. It featured not just one, but two different main conduits that kept water flowing into Petra. Researchers had long known about the first channel lined with terracotta pipes to carry water into the city. What the researchers didn't expect was to unearth the imprint of a second conduit that once held a pressurized lead pipeline supplying water to basins and reservoirs on az-Zantur hill.\n\n“The discovery of numerous water structures on the plateau directly above the rock slopes with the presumed aqueduct channel and the dam, raised broader questions about the engineering and chronology of this area,” Jungmann said in a study recently published in Levant. “As [the existence of a second conduit] was not mentioned in prior research, examining how the aqueduct entered the city became a primary research objective.”\n\nMeasuring roughly 380 feet (116 meters) in length, the newly-discovered pipeline used a welded metal pipe that was made of lead and encased in mortar. Further evidence that the Nabateans used a lead pipe in the second conduit includes its significantly larger diameter compared to the terracotta pipes found in the area, and the regular surface of the imprint it left behind in the underlying stone, as opposed to the irregular surface imprint typical of channels that held terracotta pipes. A later excavation backed this hypothesis when Nabatean conduit blocks were discovered during a survey of the city center. In the hardened mortar was section of lead pipe, whose imprint texture and dimensions matched those of the earlier find and left no more doubts about the overall composition of the aqueduct’s second main conduit.\n\nJungmann concluded that such a long and narrow lead pipe was probably used as an inverted siphon within the ‘Ain Braq aqueduct. It was buried in concrete to transport water beneath the city, bypassing obstacles on the surface. Water in the system would have flowed through a header tank before entering the aqueduct’s two conduits. Previously, one theory posited that the conduit could have taken a detour to supply water to another part of the city before arriving at its destination. However, the conduit was found to head west, probably to reach the reservoirs of az-Zantur hill. A detour would have not even been viable, since only an uninterrupted pipeline that generates enough internal pressure can allow water in a siphon to run from the header tank to the basin or reservoir it was meant to fill.\n\n“Overall, this study underscores the potential for further research into Nabataean water management,” said Jungmann. “While some hypotheses about the aqueduct’s two branches into the city have been proposed above, more fieldwork is required in order to provide a fuller understanding of the distribution system and its evolution over time.”\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "description": "Spanish football expert Guillem Balague details how Vincius Jr has become a global symbol of resistance against discrimination.",
    "fullText": "Spanish football expert Guillem Balague was at the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon on Tuesday as Real Madrid's Champions League play-off tie at Benfica was halted for 10 minutes after Vinicius Jr reported alleged racist abuse.\n\nIt marked the 20th time Vinicius alleges he has been the subject of abuse during his eight years at Real Madrid.\n\nHere, Balague gives his perspective and details how the 25-year-old forward has become a global symbol of resistance against discrimination.\n\nFootball should have been revelling in a masterpiece last night - Vinicius scoring a goal so outrageous it deserved to dominate every headline.\n\nInstead, once again, the sport was dragged into the same rancid swamp it never seems able to climb out of: alleged racism, denials, excuses and a staggering lack of understanding from those who should know better.\n\nVinicius has been here before many, many times. In fact, he has now faced 20 incidents of alleged abuse.\n\nThe latest accusation is that Benfica's Argentine midfielder Gianluca Prestianni racially abused him minutes after that wonder goal.\n\nPrestianni denies the allegation. Vinicius has been backed strongly by a number of his team-mates, in particular Kylian Mbappe who told the media he heard a racist term used five times.\n\nAfter the game, Benfica boss Jose Mourinho effectively blamed the player himself for provoking the situation.\n\n\"These talents are able to do these beautiful things, but unfortunately was not just happy to score that astonishing goal,\" he told Amazon Prime Video Sport. \"When you score a goal like that, you celebrate in a respectful way.\"\n\nHe then went on to claim that Benfica couldn't possibly be a racist football club for the simple reason that its greatest-ever player Eusebio was black.\n\nMourinho's comments mark a new low, but are nonetheless indicative of the media debate - particularly in Spain and today clearly in Portugal - that remains stuck in the same place.\n\n\"Yes, they insult him, but he should behave better,\" seems to be the constant refrain.\n\nAs if you could separate one thing from the other. As if they weren't part of the same process.\n\nWhen Vinicius confronts the stands his attitude is interpreted as arrogant and inappropriate.\n\nBut that reaction is said to stem from the same source as his protests against racism: a constant struggle against a hostile environment.\n\nFrantz Fanon said in his influential 1952 book Black Skin, White Masks: \"The Black man has to fight twice as hard to be accepted as a man.\"\n\nPerhaps for Vinicius this burden translates into anger, tension and gestures that, from the outside, seem excessive.\n\nBut seen from within, they could be viewed as pure survival.\n\nWhen the Spanish press demands that Vinicius limit himself to \"playing and keeping quiet,\" it points to what the American sociologist Eduardo Bonilla-Silva called \"racism without racists\" - cultural frameworks that don't directly insult, but blame the affected person for their reaction.\n\nVinicius has become a global symbol of resistance against discrimination as he strives to get the authorities to toughen their protocols and actions.\n\nWhat is Uefa's racism protocol and is it working?\n\nThe hostility towards Vinicius is real - and it has names, dates and court sentences.\n\nThe latest incident at the Estadio da Luz marks the 20th time he has allegedly been abused in his time with Real Madrid.\n\nHe has been insulted in stadiums across Spain. He has testified in court after a black mannequin wearing his shirt was hung from a bridge.\n\nHe has seen fans being sanctioned with suspended sentences for racist abuse in Valencia and Mallorca. This was largely thanks to La Liga's efforts to ensure those actions do not remain unpunished within a judicial culture that long treated football's \"industrial\" language and \"banter\" with indulgence.\n\nA chronology of some of the incidents suffered by him makes for depressing reading.\n\nBack in October 2021 during a Clasico at the Camp Nou, a fan shouted racist abuse at him as he was being substituted. The case was closed because the police were unable to identify the perpetrator.\n\nThen in March 2022, Mallorca fans made monkey noises towards him and told him that he should \"go pick bananas\".\n\nThe authorities were \"outraged\" and said it was \"despicable\" but not \"criminally significant\". No action was taken.\n\nOn the Spanish football programme El Chiringuito, Pedro Bravo, the head of the Spanish Football Agents' Association, suggested Vinicius should \"stop acting like a monkey\" and respect his opponents.\n\nHe later apologized on X, claiming he had \"badly used the expression... in a metaphorical way to mean 'fooling around'\".\n\nThe comment caused outrage, especially in Brazil. No further action was taken.\n\nIn September 2022, Atletico Madrid fans chanted racist abuse outside the stadium. Prosecutors did not file charges.\n\nA doll wearing Vinicius' jersey was found hanging from a bridge in January 2023. Four members of the supporters' group Frente Atletico were sentenced to prison terms of between 14 and 22 months, which were later commuted to fines and restraining orders.\n\nFurther incidents followed over the next few months, all of which led to little or no repercussions for the perpetrators.\n\nIf there was a turning point it occurred in Valencia at the Mestalla in May 2023, when Vinicius confronted the stands after being insulted.\n\nLater, in extra time, he was sent off after an argument with Valencia goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili and for punching Hugo Duro in the face.\n\nIn June 2024, three fans were sentenced to eight months in prison and two years of stadium bans for their part in the abuse. It was the first sentence of its kind in Spain.\n\nWhen he returned to Mestalla in March 2024 he was met by a chorus of boos. His response? Two goals, celebrated with a raised fist.\n\nSometimes he doesn't even have to be at the match to suffer the racial taunts.\n\nEleven days after the Mestalla return, racist abuse towards him was chanted before a Champions League match between Atletico Madrid and Inter. Real Madrid reported the incident to the hate crimes prosecutor's office.\n\nThen five days later, at Osasuna's ground shouts of \"Vinicius die\" were heard.\n\nOn 29 September 2024, four people were arrested for inciting a hate campaign on social media under anonymity to insult the player during the derby against Atletico Madrid.\n\nMost recently, this February, during the Copa del Rey semi-final against Real Sociedad, referee Jose Maria Sanchez Martinez paused the match through Spain's anti-hate protocol.\n\nThis was due to chants against another player, but the cameras also captured a fan making monkey gestures towards Vinicius during the stoppage. The club broadcast announcements over the PA system and LED screens rejecting xenophobic chants.\n\nOnly last month, during Alvaro Arbeloa's debut as Real manager against Albacete in the Copa del Rey, a group of their fans hurled racist insults at the Brazilian.\n\nLa Liga strongly condemned the incident, reaffirming its support for the player.\n\nPerhaps you might wonder why Vinicius continues to react and fight? He gave an answer in June 2024 after the racists who abused him in Valencia were sentenced to jail term.\n\n\"Many people asked me to ignore it, others said that my fight was in vain and that I should just 'play football',\" Vinicius said in a post on X.\n\n\"But, as I've always said, I'm not a victim of racism. I am an executioner of racists. This first criminal conviction in Spanish history is not for me. It's for all black people.\"",

    "description": "The four-time world champion previously claimed the new F1 regulations are like \"Formula E on steroids\", revealing that he doesn't like driving the 2026 cars",
    "fullText": "Max Verstappen has doubled down on his criticism of the 2026 Formula 1 regulations, stating the championship must “stay away” from becoming Formula E.\n\nThe four-time world champion caused a huge stir during last week’s Bahrain pre-season test, when he labelled the new F1 rule set as “anti-racing” and “Formula E on steroids”.\n\nThis comes as the F1 power unit is now more reliant on electrical energy with a near 50-50 split against the internal combustion engine, meaning battery harvesting will play a greater role at grands prix.\n\nIt may include drivers downshifting on straights to preserve energy, and this is similar to Formula E, where racers often deliberately drop back to save battery before launching late attacks.\n\nVerstappen is against all of this and, when asked on Wednesday if more Formula E drivers may enter F1 because of their experience with battery management, or if the all-electric championship could even become a feeder series, the Red Bull racer said: “Well, let's hope not.\n\n“I mean, not about the drivers, because there are a lot of good drivers that would be able to perform also really well here. But I don't want us to be close to Formula E.\n\n“I want us to actually stay away from that and be Formula 1. So don't increase the battery. Actually, get rid of that and focus on a nice engine and have Formula E as Formula E, because that's what they are about.\n\n“I'm sure that with the new car [Gen4] from what I've seen and talked to some of my friends in there, that's going to be also a really cool car. But let them be Formula E and we should stay Formula 1, and let's try not to mix that.”\n\nVerstappen’s comments are just an example of how the 2026 regulations have divided opinion, as reigning world champion Lando Norris claimed that the new cars are “a lot of fun”.\n\n“I'm just sharing my opinion,” added the Dutchman, when asked if he received any pushback from the authorities over his criticism.\n\n“We live in a free world, free speech and yeah, that's what I felt. Not everyone needs to feel like that, but that's how I felt and it also doesn't matter, of course, what other people have to say about that. It's just I got a question and I shared my opinion.\n\n“I think that I'm allowed to do [that]. So it's not about receiving pushback or whatever.”\n\nRed Bull: Can't make Verstappen happier about 2026 F1 cars, but can build him a winning one\n\nWhat Verstappen means by warning of F1 2026 \"disaster\" to come\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

    "description": "Electric vehicle sales fell 3% worldwide in January compared to the same period last year, as the industry braces for a deep freeze.",
    "fullText": "The EV winter is going global — and even Tesla isn't immune.\n\nElectric vehicle sales across the auto industry fell 3% worldwide in January compared to the same period last year, according to data from Benchmark Intelligence published Friday, as policy changes in the US and China threaten to throw the industry into a deep freeze.\n\nIn North America and China, sales fell 33% and 20% respectively last month.\n\nEV sales in the US have plummeted since the removal of the $7,500 tax credit for new electric vehicles in September, and CEOs and industry experts have warned of a bumpy few years ahead.\n\nIn China, EVs accounted for around half of all vehicles sold last year — but companies are facing their own challenges after the government moved to end a key tax exemption for EV purchases and adjusted its trade-in scheme to make it less generous for battery-powered vehicles.\n\nChina's EV wobble has also hit its most successful foreign import — Tesla.\n\nElon Musk's automaker sold fewer than 20,000 vehicles in China in January, according to data from the China Passenger Car Association, its lowest figure since late 2022.\n\nUnlike many other Western carmakers in China, Tesla has largely managed to fend off a wave of local rivals and protect its market share in the world's largest auto market.\n\nHowever, a slowing EV market and a lack of new products — barring refreshes and variants, Tesla hasn't launched a new vehicle in China since the Model Y in 2021 — has left the US automaker vulnerable.\n\nIndustry data published last week suggests that Tesla's Model Y was outsold in January by more than two to one by Xiaomi's YU7, which was widely hailed as a serious rival to Tesla's bestselling EV when the smartphone maker launched it last June.\n\nAnd last year, BYD took Tesla's crown as the world's largest seller of battery-powered vehicles — although the Chinese company also saw its January sales fall 30% year over year, signaling a difficult start to 2026.\n\nOutside of China, things aren't looking much better for Tesla.\n\nThe company continues to struggle in Europe, after facing major backlash last year over CEO Musk's interventions into local politics and endorsement of the German far-right party AfD.\n\nDespite staging a recovery in some markets, such as Spain and Italy in January, Tesla's registrations also collapsed by 42% in France and fell to just 82 cars in EV-friendly Norway.\n\nIn the UK, where Tesla's Chinese rivals do not face tariffs, BYD sold four times as many cars as Tesla last month, after the Austin-based automaker's registrations fell by half.\n\nThe ongoing slump comes despite Europe being one of the few regions to see a bump in EV demand so far this year. Electric vehicle sales grew by nearly 25% year-over-year in January, per Benchmark figures.\n\nTesla's struggles in China and Europe mean its attempt to return to growth after two years of annual sales declines is off to a rough start.\n\nThe company has also faced a difficult spell in the US following the end of the tax credit, with sales in the final three months of 2025 falling 15% year over year, per figures from Cox Automotive — although the brand's January sales were only 2% lower than last year.\n\nTesla is by no means the only US automaker taking a hit in the EV market. The Detroit \"big three\" of Ford, GM, and Stellantis have collectively announced over $50 billion in charges related to their EV businesses in recent months, as they switch gears to sell more gas-powered and hybrid vehicles. Just 90,000 electric vehicles were sold in North America in January, according to Benchmark's figures.\n\nGetting caught in the EV winter might not bother Tesla's management, though, with the company rapidly shifting its focus away from the traditional auto industry.\n\nMusk told investors last month that Tesla will sunset its pioneering Model X and S models to build a new production line for its Optimus humanoid robot, and predicted that the company's upcoming Cybercab robotaxi will make current transportation methods obsolete.\n\n\"We're literally saying what we're going to do and have said what we're going to do for a while,\" Musk said\n\n\"I think long-term, really the only vehicles that we'll make will be autonomous vehicles, with the exception of the next-generation Roadster,\" he added.",

    "fullText": "Rob Citrone sees better opportunities outside of the US.\n\nThe billionaire hedge funder says he's short US stocks, largely due to expectations that the domestic market would continue underperform the rest of the world.\n\n\"I am short the US, and I'm long global markets,\" the Discovery Capital founder said, speaking to CNBC about his investment strategy on Tuesday.\n\nCitrone said the US market was already beginning to fall behind relative to other assets. In the year leading up the last Friday, he noted that the gains in dollar-based assets have been the weakest when compared to 19 other markets around the world.\n\nThe S&P 500 is up 11% over the past year, compared to the 34% gain in the iShares Core MSCI Emerging Market ETF over the same period.\n\n\"The US is 20th out of 20,\" Citrone said, adding that gains in the US market fell around 30% short of the gains in emerging markets in the last year. \"That's a significant difference.\"\n\nThere are a few reasons Citrone said he believed the US's underperformance would continue:\n\nMost global investors are \"way overweight\" in the US-based assets. On average, US-based institutions have around 80% of their wealth invested in the US market, he said.\n\n\"Most people are going to move some money from the US, elsewhere,\" Citrone added.\n\nAI uncertainty. US markets are also facing uncertainty as to how the AI trade will pan out, he said, pointing to overarching concerns about large AI-related capex spending, though monetization plans for AI remain unclear at some firms.\n\nVarious stock sectors are also starting to sell-off out of fear over how AI could disrupt business models, he added, pointing to the selling pressure that's hammered the software, real estate, and trucking sectors recently.\n\nCitrone said he saw better opportunities in emerging markets. He pointed in particular to the promising investment climate in areas like Argentina and Brazil, and said Mexico was his top pick due to its growing ties to the US economy.\n\n\"I think Mexico has really gone all in with the United States and they've got good — better leadership, the companies are quite competitive,\" Citrone said, adding that most of the companies in the nation had \"big moats\" in competition due to being monopolies or oligopolies.\n\nInvestors have been increasingly turning their attention to other areas around the world, a trend that has been gathering steam since President Donald Trump's tariffs first sparked a \"Sell America\" moment in markets last year. Goldman Sachs and Lazard are among the firms that have also warned the US's dominance in global markets could continue to fade.",

    "fullText": "Last year, the bears came out of hibernation.\n\nThere were 166 short-selling campaigns launched in 2025, according to industry tracker Diligent Market Intelligence — a 55% bump compared to 2024. The vast majority were based in the US.\n\nThe most targeted companies were technology stocks that had been boosted by market-wide optimism about artificial intelligence, Josh Black, the author of Diligent's report, told Business Insider. The report identified Applovin, a company that helps iPhone apps monetize users via advertising technology, as an example of a common short. The company's stock is down nearly 40% this year.\n\nThe spike in short-selling campaigns may be a sign of pain to come in 2026. In 2021, one year before a global market plunge brought on in part by concerns over lofty tech valuations, there were 128 campaigns — the most in the last five years until 2025.\n\nOf last year's 166 campaigns, 55 of them were focused on technology companies, by far the most of any sector.\n\nThe slide in software stocks such as Salesforce and Oracle this year has added fuel to short-sellers' questions about the industry's valuations in the age of AI.\n\nNew shortseller BMF Capital, run by Frankie Gerola and based in Arizona, told Diligent that one of the firm's first bets, against defense AI company BigBear.ai, came about in part due to what it viewed as a \"lack of true AI innovation.\" BigBear, which has attracted other short sellers, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the short-sellers' critiques.\n\nBMF Capital is also keeping an eye on companies \"that repeatedly change narratives in search of relevance, such as a sports company pivoting into AI dating.\"\n\n\"That kind of identity drift usually precedes capital stress or poor fundamentals,\" BMF Capital said.\n\nLast year, the average short campaign generated returns of 7.2% 30 days after launch, according to Diligent. So far in 2026, the software-stock crash has generated billions for those betting against the stocks, short-seller tracker S3 Partners said.",

    "fullText": "Jess Fishlock will join Rhian Wilkinson's coaching staff for part of Wales' international camp in March before leaving to fulfil club commitments with Seattle Reign.\n\nWales legend Fishlock, 39, retired from international football in October, but signed a new one-year deal with National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) side Reign the following month.\n\nShe will join her former international team-mates as a technical assistant for Wales' opening 2027 World Cup qualifying game against the Czech Republic on Tuesday, 3 March.\n\nFishlock will not be present for the second Group B1 fixture, against Montenegro in Llanelli four days later, because of Reign's preparations for the new NWSL season, which begins later in the month.\n\n\"She's obviously in pre-season with Seattle so a big thank you to Seattle and to her coach Laura Harvey for allowing us to borrow her for the front end of this campaign,\" said Wales head coach Wilkinson.\n\n\"She's coming in as a technical assistant. I know as a former player who became a coach, it's quite a leap off a cliff. When the players have days off, you do not. Your day starts a lot earlier and ends a lot later.\n\n\"Jess is still a player for Seattle and she's just retired from the national team so she will be eased into it. In that way, it's slightly different than the other technical staff, but she will be putting in a shift for sure.\"\n\nFishlock's former team-mate Kayleigh Barton, who has been working with Wales' under-17s squad after retiring in the wake of Euro 2025, will also be involved with the senior group.\n\nFishlock has 'had conversations' over Wales role\n\nCould granddaughter of 'The King' play for Wales?\n\nWales to tour country in World Cup qualifying\n\nWales 'all in' for 2027 World Cup - Wilkinson\n\n\"These are women who have given everything for their country and as our young players come through now, I think having the support of those players around the environment is huge,\" Wilkinson added.\n\n\"Equally, Jess needs to see a little bit behind the curtain so she can make her decisions about what she might want to do in the future, if she ever retires.\"\n\nThe Czech Republic game, which will be played in Uherske Hradiste, is Wales' first competitive fixture since Euro 2025, which was the first women's major tournament the team had qualified for.\n\nWales' hopes of following their European Championship appearance by reaching a first World Cup have not been helped by the loss of Fishlock, the greatest female player in the history of the Welsh game.\n\nBut while she feels Fishlock could still contribute on the pitch, Wilkinson says she has to accept her decision to stand down from Wales duty.\n\n\"Jess is one of those players that could play for many more years and she knew that when she retired,\" Wilkinson said.\n\n\"It's painful to know that she could probably still step on the pitch, but equally I think it was a great decision that she's made when she's healthy, strong and still fully capable to be like 'OK, I want to focus on my club football at this point'.\n\n\"We had really good conversations and Jess is an all-in type person so she wouldn't say 'oh I'm good to go for another year'. In her mind if she's good to go, she's saying yes to a cycle, whether that's two or four years, and I don't think she felt like she had the energy to do that.\"\n\nWales begin their bid to reach the World Cup knowing there is no opportunity to qualify automatically because they are in League B.\n\nAssuming they do not finish bottom of a group which also includes Albania – which would be disastrous – Wales will progress to a play-off campaign in which they may have to come through stages to secure a place at the tournament, which will be held in Brazil.\n\nWilkinson has recalled fit-again Newcastle United player Lois Joel to her squad for the first two group games, but midfielder Laura Hughes misses out through injury.\n\nHughes, who has previously been capped by Australia, made her Wales debut in the friendly win over Switzerland in December.\n\nWilkinson says she does not know the exact nature of Hughes' injury, but expects her back for the double-header against Albania in April.\n\nThere are three uncapped players in the squad - goalkeeper Poppy Soper and Plymouth Argyle duo Olivia Francis and Phoebie Poole.\n\nOlivia Clark (Leicester City), Safia Middleton-Patel (Manchester United), Poppy Soper (Rugby Borough), Ceri Holland (Liverpool), Gwen Zimmerman (Eclipse Select), Ella Powell (Bristol City), Rhiannon Roberts (Sunderland), Hayley Ladd (Everton), Gemma Evans (Liverpool), Charlie Estcourt (Portsmouth), Lily Woodham (Liverpool), Esther Morgan (Bristol City), Sophie Ingle (Bristol City), Mia Ross (Charlton Athletic), Angharad James (Seattle Reign), Lois Joel (Newcastle United), Carrie Jones (IFK Norrkoping), Tianna Teisar (Plymouth Argyle – on loan from Bristol City), Mared Griffiths (Sunderland - on loan from Manchester United), Olivia Francis (Plymouth Argyle), Phoebie Poole (Plymouth Argyle), Hannah Cain (Leicester City), Rachel Rowe (Nottingham Forest), Ffion Morgan (West Ham United), Elise Hughes (Crystal Palace), Mary McAteer (Charlton Athletic).",

    "description": "Hull KR made history with a domestic treble in 2025 and now target world domination in Thursday's decider with NRL premiers Brisbane Broncos.",
    "fullText": "The sensation of winning is an addictive one.\n\nWhether it's the fizz of champagne bubbling on the tongue, the feeling of completion mixed intoxicatingly with the ecstasy of achievement, or even the monetary rewards, those who have enjoyed success crave it greedily.\n\nHull KR captain Elliot Minchella is no exception.\n\nIn 2025, Minchella got his hands on all the prizes; the first Robin since the great Roger Millward to lift a Challenge Cup, the first since David Watkinson to raise the prize for securing the top-flight championship.\n\nWinning Super League for the first time gives Rovers a crack at a trophy no Robin has ever won - the World Club Challenge.\n\nThursday's showpiece against Australia's National Rugby League premiers Brisbane Broncos will give Minchella and his team-mates the chance to box off their 2025 successes and earn the mantle of best club team in the world.\n\n\"St Helens, Leeds, Wigan and Bradford, to name just four, all won World Club Challenges and we want to remembered for winning this game,\" Minchella told BBC Sport.\n\n\"No-one remembers a team that didn't come out on the winning side. You remember the ones that won for years to come.\n\n\"That's my thought process - I want to be part of a team that wins. I experienced that last year and this is the first opportunity for 2026.\n\n\"Winning silverware felt great last year, so I want another piece of it.\"\n\nAlthough there might be some in the west of the rugby league-mad city of Hull who swap their irregular black and white hoops for maroon, white and gold on Thursday night, the World Club Challenge tends to unite many fans behind the Super League representing the northern hemisphere game.\n\nBeing standard bearers for the competition and the community is not lost on Minchella, who watched the likes of Bradford and St Helens strike a blow to the all-conquering NRL in the inter-hemisphere match-ups as a boy.\n\n\"It's unique to play against a team not in your competition, teams you're not used to if you like,\" he added.\n\n\"In Super League you get to know your opposition when you play against them two or three times a season, so this is a completely unique situation.\n\n\"It's the same for both teams; you do your homework on the opposition.\n\n\"These are games I watched as a kid, the World Club Challenges from yesteryear. You dream then of being involved in one someday, and here we are, getting the chance to play in one on Thursday.\n\n\"It's a massive privilege to be involved in this game, not just to represent the city of Hull but also Super League and going up against the NRL's best.\"\n\nHaving dominated the competition in 2025, Hull KR's start to life as champions can hardly be described as ideal preparation for the ominous meeting with NRL champions Brisbane.\n\nThe Robins let slip an 18-6 lead against newly-promoted York in their season opener to lose 19-18 and started the Super League campaign in defeat.\n\nFor head coach Willie Peters, it is a case of finding improvement and learnings, and a little inspiration, as they head into Thursday's crunch encounter with the Broncos.\n\n\"The way York handled the game, coming up against a team who had just won the treble, they showed no fear,\" he told BBC Radio Humberside.\n\n\"It didn't matter who was in front of them, they just went after them.\n\n\"We need to be the same this week against Brisbane. The Broncos are a formidable side, the best in the NRL, so it will be good to take some of York's mindset against us into the game.\"\n\nThursday, 19 February (19:30 GMT)\n\nWatch on BBC Three and BBC iPlayer; listen to commentary on BBC Radio 5 live and BBC Radio Humberside\n\nAround 24,000 fans will get the opportunity to roar on Rovers in Thursday's game, after Hull KR negotiated the use of the larger MKM Stadium, home of their fierce rivals Hull FC.\n\nCraven Park's much lower capacity would have left many fans locked out of the event, and stifled the club's ability to generate revenue from a major showpiece.\n\nSo, Minchella and his team-mates have a unique situation whereby they will head for the home dressing room rather than the away facility, as well as running out to thousands of cheering voices rather than a chorus of boos and jeers.\n\nThey will also do so in a specially designed kit, which harks back to the Robins' famous 1983 victory over a touring Queensland side which featured 'The King' Wally Lewis, later Wigan star Gene Miles and other Australia internationals such as Wally Fullerton-Smith and Bryan Niebling.\n\nThat Rovers side remains fondly recalled, with Robins forever favourites such George Fairburn, Gary Prohm, Mike Smith, John Dorahy, Watkinson, Mark Broadhurst and Phil Hogan among the ranks.\n\n\"We're looking forward to pulling the shirt on,\" Minchella added. \"I've done some pictures with the kit and heard a lot of the story, the reasons why we're wearing the shirt.\n\n\"You never forget the history is there, it's in the books forever and for us to be able to represent those guys, our club and our community wearing the shirt is a great nod to them.\n\n\"Hopefully people are proud to see us wear that and we can make them proud and make our own history as the 2026 team.\"\n\nBrisbane arrived in England for a two-week visit last week, spending the first part of their trip in London, where they linked up with namesakes London Broncos as part of legend Darren Lockyer's involvement in the capital.\n\nThe NRL champions then headed north to prepare for Thursday's match, having put together an impressive squad.\n\nRugby league's 'Justin Bieber' in the shape of dynamic full-back Reece Walsh spearheads the high-profile group, while powerful forwards such as Payne Haas and Patrick Carrigan offer the muscle to put Rovers under duress.\n\nPeters will look to Arthur Mourgue, Oli Gildart, Peta Hiku and Mikey Lewis to provide the sparkle in response to the attacking gifts of Walsh, Kotoni Staggs, Ezra Mam and Gehemat Shibasaki.\n\nTom Amone, Jai Whitbread and Dean Hadley are among the packmen who will look to get at their Broncos counterparts.\n\n\"Us as a forward pack, we look forward to going up against theirs, and most games of rugby league are won in the middle, and the backs decide by how many,\" Minchella said.\n\n\"So, it'll be no different on Thursday. We're testing ourselves against the best out there and we're looking forward to the physical battle of the game, and going after it and embracing it.\n\n\"We've got to stop them but we want to be confident in making them try to stop us too.\"\n\nHull KR became only the fifth team to win Super League in achieving their 2025 dreams, likewise in terms of securing a treble.\n\nWhile skill was at the heart of such success, mentality and mindset too are key for the Robins to continue to bring silverware to the red and white side of the River Hull.\n\n\"We've got a responsibility to put our best foot forward, we need to put together a 'British' performance, represent who we are and that's East Hull as well,\" Minchella maintained.\n\n\"It's about having some grit and some toughness, doing that to the best of our ability.\n\n\"It's something we're good at as a team and it's going to come out on the biggest stage - it needs to come out on the biggest stage.\n\n\"The conditions are going to be pretty cold, the atmosphere is going to be hostile, and for us as players we need to nail all those effort areas, be a tough team to break down and be dogged.\"",

    "fullText": "Former world number two Paula Badosa has responded to claims she is \"disrespectful to the game\" following her withdrawal from a match in Dubai.\n\nThe Spaniard beat Katerina Siniakova 6-3 7-5 at the Dubai Tennis Championships on Monday before a right thigh issue forced her to retire from the match against Elina Svitolina on Tuesday.\n\nThe 28-year-old, who retired from four matches last year, was 4-1 up against Svitolina but lost the first set 6-4 and then, having called for treatment, withdrew.\n\nA social media user accused Badosa of being \"disrespectful to the game\" as \"you cannot retire/withdraw from every tournament\".\n\n\"You have no idea what it's like to live with a chronic injury and still choose to keep going,\" wrote Badosa in response., external\n\n\"To wake up every day not knowing how your body will respond, searching for solutions, and fighting for something you love and give everything to even when it's so difficult.\"\n\nTennis 'racist, misogynistic, homophobic', says Aiava\n\nBadosa contemplated ending her playing career in 2024 because of a string of injuries, including a chronic back problem.\n\nShe was ranked as high as number two in 2022 but, despite working her way back into the top 10 last year, is now 70th.\n\n\"Trust me I'm the first one suffering with pain and having endless nightmares to try to find solutions every single day,\" she added.\n\n\"I'll always try one more time. And if there's even a 1% chance to keep going, I'll take it.\"\n\nBadosa, who reached the semi-finals of the Australian Open in January 2025, criticised the toxicity of some of social media.\n\n\"So for me the only disrespect here is to open social media and read messages like this,\" she added.\n\n\"Then we complain if we see players or people suffering and having mental health issues. But I'm not surprised with the amount of hate and 'experts' we have here.\"\n\nBadosa's comments follow Destanee Aiava announcing her impending retirement aged 25, saying it had a \"racist, misogynistic, homophobic and hostile\" culture.\n\nAs part of her explanation of her decision, Aiava said she had faced abuse from online trolls - an issue that has affected several players in the game.\n\nBritish player Katie Boulter shared some of the abuse she had received with BBC Sport last year to help highlight the scale of the problem.\n\nFigures from data science firm Signify, the International Tennis Federation and Women's Tennis Association show that in 2024, about 8,000 abusive, violent or threatening messages were sent publicly to 458 tennis players through their social media accounts, with many stemming from betting.\n\nLive scores, results and order of play\n\nGet tennis news sent straight to your phone",

    "title": "'It smacks of England' - Australia fail again at T20 World Cup",
    "description": "Muddled selection and the lack of a plan B - how Australia's T20 World Cup campaign was derailed in Sri Lanka.",
    "fullText": "After Monday's resounding defeat by Sri Lanka took World Cup fate out of his side's hands, Australia captain Mitchell Marsh asked for the luck of the Irish to kick in.\n\nThe following day, Ireland were due to take on Zimbabwe in Pallekele. Any points for the African side would knock Australia out of the competition.\n\nClearly, no-one told Marsh that when it comes to Irish luck in a cricketing context, rain is never far away. The two sides shared the points after wet weather saw the match abandoned without a ball bowled. Zimababwe through, Australia gone.\n\nFor the first time since 2009, there will not be an Australian side in the Super 8s stage or equivalent. Since winning it in 2021, this edition marks a third consecutive T20 World Cup without Australia in the semi-finals.\n\nLess than a month on from wrapping up a resounding Ashes drubbing, Australia's T20 side has failed to hit similar heights. The failings of this competition, which has seen them play all of their group games in Sri Lanka, alongside a wider slump in this format, does little to discard the notion that T20 cricket is not a priority.\n\nAs always after a difficult tournament, selection is questioned. Steve Smith has long been out of this side, not appearing in almost two years. A century and two 50s in the recent Big Bash were not enough to earn a recall. Not until Marsh was hit in the groin in training prior to Australia's first game against Ireland.\n\nSmith was summoned to acclimatise in Colombo in case he was required. He ultimately was, but not as a replacement for Marsh.\n\nAustralia's Test run machine eventually earned a place in the squad proper when the selectors belatedly named a replacement for Josh Hazlewood, who was ruled out of the competition before a ball was bowled.\n\nAll those moving parts for a player who only made it onto the park as a sub fielder while Australia were still mathematically alive, with Smith powerless to stop Sri Lanka and Pathum Nissanka's charge.\n\nThe decision to drop Matthew Renshaw for that defeat also reads as confusing. His 37 off 33 balls against Ireland was slow, but the Ireland camp highlighted how impressed they were given the tricky nature of the pitch. Next time out, Renshaw's 65 off 44 fell short of match-winning status against Zimbabwe.\n\nDropping him against Sri Lanka backfired. After Travis Head and Marsh's opening partnership of 104 off 8.3 overs, Australia looked well set. They lost the next three wickets for 26 runs, the middle order appearing to lack the stability previously provided by Renshaw.\n\n\"The reaction back home has been rather heavy because I think we've been sold down the stream a little bit in terms of our selection and how we've gone about preparing for this T20 World Cup,\" Australia's two-time 50-over World Cup winner Matthew Hayden told Test Match Special.\n\n\"It sort of smacks of England, and their questions in the Ashes preparation - this kind of self-fulfilling prophecy of 'we're OK' and 'no, don't worry'. It's a mix of denial and maybe even just mismanagement.\n\n\"We enjoy coming to countries like Sri Lanka but we just haven't prepared for what we've seen. We've picked power hitters in finesse type conditions.\n\n\"[It's] almost like stubbornness but there is a plan A. And that plan A is called power. And it's a day and age of power. In India, that's certainly the case.\n\n\"These conditions [in Sri Lanka], though, are different. They're not such pure batting surfaces, and that requires methodology. It almost requires a bit more of an old school approach and way of thinking about the game that allows you to stay in the contest.\"\n\nAustralia's fast-bowling depth behind the big three of Hazlewood, Pat Cummins and Mitchell Starc looks strong in red-ball cricket. Just ask England.\n\nIn white-ball cricket, though, it's a different story. Starc has retired from the format while Cummins and Hazelwood are injured. It says plenty that, instead of calling up a bowler immediately once the latter went down, they waited until mid-tournament to call up Smith, a batter.\n\nWord from within the camp refuses to dwell too much on muddled selection or lack of depth.\n\n\"Looking down our list, honestly, it feels like there's more than enough talent to look after the situations in the games that we're playing,\" said Marsh after the Sri Lanka defeat.\n\n\"As much as we can talk about team line-up and who's in, who's out and that sort of thing, I think if everyone just looks after their role it should help [put] us in good stead.\"\n\nAll-rounder Cameron Green, who became the Indian Premier League's most expensive overseas signing when he was picked up for more than £2m by Kolkata Knight Riders in December, was criticised by Hayden having struggled to make an impact despite batting at number three.\n\n\"Cam Green has just looked awful with the bat,\" said Hayden. \"He looks woody, he looks tinny, he looks like he's just a man with no confidence, and I'd be very surprised if that's not exactly the case.\n\n\"Matt Renshaw has come with no baggage to this tournament. He actually had a really good series back home in Australia in the ODIs.

    "fullText": "Prof Michael Wooldridge says scenario such as deadly self-driving car update or AI hack could destroy global interest\n\nThe race to get artificial intelligence to market has raised the risk of a Hindenburg-style disaster that shatters global confidence in the technology, a leading researcher has warned.\n\nMichael Wooldridge, a professor of AI at Oxford University, said the danger arose from the immense commercial pressures that technology firms were under to release new AI tools, with companies desperate to win customers before the products’ capabilities and potential flaws are fully understood.\n\nThe surge in AI chatbots with guardrails that are easily bypassed showed how commercial incentives were prioritised over more cautious development and safety testing, he said.\n\n“It’s the classic technology scenario,” he said. “You’ve got a technology that’s very, very promising, but not as rigorously tested as you would like it to be, and the commercial pressure behind it is unbearable.”\n\nWooldridge, who will deliver the Royal Society’s Michael Faraday prize lecture on Wednesday evening, titled “This is not the AI we were promised”, said a Hindenburg moment was “very plausible” as companies rushed to deploy more advanced AI tools.\n\nThe Hindenburg, a 245-metre airship that made round trips across the Atlantic, was preparing to land in New Jersey in 1937 when it burst into flames, killing 36 crew, passengers and ground staff. The inferno was caused by a spark that ignited the 200,000 cubic metres of hydrogen that kept the airship aloft.\n\n“The Hindenburg disaster destroyed global interest in airships; it was a dead technology from that point on, and a similar moment is a real risk for AI,” Wooldridge said. Because AI is embedded in so many systems, a major incident could strike almost any sector.\n\nThe scenarios Wooldridge imagines include a deadly software update for self-driving cars, an AI-powered hack that grounds global airlines, or a Barings bank-style collapse of a major company, triggered by AI doing something stupid. “These are very, very plausible scenarios,” he said. “There are all sorts of ways AI could very publicly go wrong.”\n\nDespite the concerns, Wooldridge said he did not intend to attack modern AI. His starting point is the gap between what researchers expected and what has emerged. Many experts anticipated AI that computed solutions to problems and provided answers that were sound and complete. “Contemporary AI is neither sound nor complete: it’s very, very approximate,” he said.\n\nThis arises because large language models, which underpin today’s AI chatbots, rattle out answers by predicting the next word, or part of a word, based on probability distributions learned in training. It leads to AIs with jagged capabilities: incredibly effective at some tasks, yet terrible at others.\n\nThe problem, Wooldridge said, was that AI chatbots failed in unpredictable ways and had no idea when they were wrong, but were designed to provide confident answers regardless. When delivered in human-like and sycophantic responses, the answers could easily mislead people, he added. The risk is that people start treating AIs as if they were human. In a 2025 survey by the Center for Democracy and Technology, nearly a third of students reported that they or a friend had had a romantic relationship with an AI.\n\n“Companies want to present AIs in a very human-like way, but I think that is a very dangerous path to take,” Wooldridge said. “We need to understand that these are just glorified spreadsheets, they are tools and nothing more than that.”\n\nWooldridge sees positives in the kind of AI depicted in the early years of Star Trek. In one 1968 episode, The Day of the Dove, Mr Spock quizzes the Enterprise’s computer only to be told in a distinctly non-human voice that it has insufficient data to answer. “That’s not what we get. We get an overconfident AI that says: yes, here’s the answer,” he said. “Maybe we need AIs to talk to us in the voice of the Star Trek computer. You would never believe it was a human being.”",

    "fullText": "Google, Anthropic and OpenAI bosses to mingle with global south leaders wrestling for control over technology\n\nSilicon Valley tech billionaires will land in Delhi this week for an AI summit hosted by India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, where leaders of the global south will wrestle for control over the fast-developing technology.\n\nDuring the week-long AI Impact Summit, attended by thousands of tech executives, government officials and AI safety experts, tech companies valued at trillions of dollars will rub along with leaders of countries such as Kenya and Indonesia, where average wages dip well below $1,000 a month.\n\nAmid a push to speed up AI adoption across the globe, Sundar Pichai, Sam Altman and Dario Amodei, the heads of Google, OpenAI and Anthropic, will all be there. Rishi Sunak and George Osborne, a former British prime minister and a former chancellor, will each be pushing for greater adoption of AI. Sunak has taken jobs for Microsoft and Anthropic and Osborne leads OpenAI’s push to deepen and widen the use of ChatGPT beyond its existing 800 million users.\n\nMeanwhile Modi, who will address the summit on Thursday, is positioning India as the AI hub for south Asia and Africa. On the agenda will be AI’s potential to transform agriculture, water supplies and public health. Governments in Kenya, Senegal, Mauritius, Togo, Indonesia and Egypt will send ministers.\n\nModi’s enthusiasm for AI has a darker side, civil liberties campaigners say. Last week they raised serious concerns about India deploying AI to increase state surveillance, discriminate against minorities and sway elections. But Modi this week spoke of “harnessing artificial intelligence for human-centric progress” and India has given the summit the strapline: “Welfare for all, happiness for all.”\n\nSummit observers talk of a battle between a new kind of AI colonialism from the US tech firms and an alternative “techno-Gandhism”, in which AI is used for social justice and to benefit marginalised people. After global AI summits in the UK, Korea and France, the Delhi meeting is the first to be held in the global south.\n\nIndian commentators say the test of AI’s value is not in its technical sophistication but whether it can improve the lives of people living in some of the toughest circumstances in the global south. By contrast, US AI companies are racing for supremacy, competing with each other and China, and rolling out AI for shopping, personal companionship and agentic systems that could slash corporate labour costs by making white-collar jobs redundant.\n\nIf a referee between the two sides is needed, António Guterres, the secretary general of the United Nations, will speak in Delhi. This week he said it would be “totally unacceptable that AI would be just a privilege of the most developed countries or a division only between two superpowers”.\n\nIndia’s AI Impact Summit is the fourth iteration of the event, which Sunak launched in 2023 at Bletchley Park in the UK, with a focus on international coordination to prevent catastrophic risks from the most advanced AI models. Summits followed in Seoul in 2024 and Paris in 2025, where the US vice-president, JD Vance, appeared to abandon the White House’s interest in safety saying: “The AI future will not be won by hand-wringing about safety; it will be won by building.”\n\nSafety is once again on the agenda, with Yoshua Bengio, one of the “godfathers” of AI, on hand to repeat his fears about the risk of powerful AI systems enabling cyber- and bioweapons attacks.\n\n“The capabilities of AI have continued to advance, and although mitigation and risk management of AI has also progressed [it has happened] not as quickly,” he said on Tuesday. “So it becomes urgent that leaders of this world understand where we could be going and it needs their attention and intervention as soon as possible.”\n\nOne of those working at the summit to make sure AI remains safe will be Nicolas Miaihle, co-founder of the AI Safety Connect group, who noted that the summit was taking place in the shadow of AI-enabled warfare in Ukraine and the Middle East.\n\n“The existential risks are not going anywhere,” he told the Guardian. “When Rishi Sunak started this, the race was not raging as hard. The trillions are pouring in but we are very far away from securing these models. This is profound for democracy, profound for the mental health of our kids and profound for warfare.”\n\nBut the Trump administration continues its policy of refusing to bind US AI companies with red tape. The White House is not expected to send a high-level representative to Delhi, with Sriram Krishnan, its senior AI policy adviser, the highest-ranked speaker listed in the programme.\n\n“Given where we are with the US administration it’s pretty unlikely you’re going to have a massive breakthrough on any consensus on what a regulatory framework will look like,” said one senior AI company source.\n\nCompanies such as Google are focused on the use of AI in education in India, where large language models’ ability to function in many of the country’s dozens of languages is an advantage.\n\n“[There’s] a big focus on access and adoption, how can you make sure that the technology is available as broadly as possible,” said Owen Larter, head of frontier AI policy and public affairs at Google DeepMind. “We’re excited on the education front in India. It’s a remarkable story of an incredibly intense adoption. About 90% of teachers and students already using AI in their learning. We’ve had a big promotional programme where 2 million students have access to our pro subscription for free.”\n\nGoogle’s investments in India include a $15bn spend, in partnership with the conglomerate of Gautam Adani, one of India’s richest billionaires, on an gigawatt-scale AI datacentre hub in the coastal city of Visakhapatnam, in Andhra Pradesh, with subsea cables connecting to other parts of the world.",

    "description": "CORTINA D'AMPEZZO, Italy (AP) — Team USA skiers Lindsey Vonn and Mikaela Shiffrin, along with Italy's Federica Brignone, are among the many skiers who have expressed concern during these Olympic Games about the accelerating melt of the world’s glaciers.",
    "fullText": "CORTINA D'AMPEZZO, Italy (AP) — Team USA skiers Lindsey Vonn and Mikaela Shiffrin, along with Italy's Federica Brignone, are among the many skiers who have expressed concern during these Olympic Games about the accelerating melt of the world’s glaciers.\n\nAnd Olympic host city Cortina is a fitting place for them to be talking about climate change: Glaciers once visible from town have dramatically shrunk. Many have been reduced to tiny glaciers or residual ice patches at high elevations among the jagged peaks of the Dolomites. Any Olympian or spectator wishing to lay eyes on a major glacier would have to take a long drive on winding mountain roads to the Marmolada. It's melting rapidly, too.\n\nThe world’s top skiers train on glaciers because of the high-quality snow there, and a warming world jeopardizes the future of their sport. Vonn started skiing on glaciers in Austria when she was just 9 years old.\n\n“Most of the glaciers that I used to ski on are pretty much gone,” 41-year-old Vonn said Feb. 3 in response to a question from The Associated Press at a prerace press conference in Cortina before she crashed on the Olympic downhill course. “So that’s very real and it’s very apparent to us.”\n\nAs athletes in snow sports, Shiffrin said, they “get a real front-row view” to the monumental changes underway atop some of the world’s highest, coldest peaks.\n\n“It is something that’s very close to our heart, because it is the heart and soul of what we do,” Shiffrin told AP after racing Sunday. “I would really, really like to believe and hope that with strong voices and sort of broader policy changes within companies and governments, there is a hope for a future of our sport. But I think right now, it’s a little bit of a ... it’s a question.”\n\nItalian glaciologist Antonella Senese said Italy has lost more than 200 square kilometers (77 square miles) of glacier area since the late 1950s.\n\n“We are observing a continuous and uninterrupted decrease in glacier area and volume. In the last one to two decades, this reduction has clearly accelerated,” Senese, associate professor of physical geography in the University of Milan's environmental science and policy department, said in an interview.\n\nAmong the peaks surrounding Cortina d’Ampezzo, there are glaciers on the slopes of the Cristallo and Sorapiss mountains. The 2015 New Italian Glacier Inventory found these glaciers shrunk by about one-third since the 1959-1962 inventory.\n\nShortly after winning a second gold Sunday at her home Winter Olympics, Brignone told AP that skiing is “totally different” now than when she was younger. Brignone lives in the Valle d’Aosta, about six hours away.\n\nWhen she sees how glaciers are retreating to higher elevations, Brignone said she’s not thinking about the future of skiing — she’s concerned for the future of the planet.\n\n“There we have a lot of glaciers, but they are going up and up, every year, more and more,” she told AP.\n\nYet many people who don't frequent the mountains remain unaware of what's at stake, so the University of Innsbruck created the Goodbye Glaciers Project. The loss of glaciers has far-reaching consequences, threatening water sources, increasing mountain hazards and contributing to sea level rise.\n\nThe project shows how different warming levels change the amount of ice left on selected glaciers around the world. To be included, glaciers must have an estimated 2020 volume of at least 0.01 cubic kilometers. The Cristallo and Sorapiss glaciers no longer meet that threshold, said Patrick Schmitt, a doctoral student at the University of Innsbruck.\n\nSome 50 kilometers (31 miles) from Cortina is the Marmolada glacier, one of the largest glaciers in Italy and the largest in the Dolomites. An apartment building-sized chunk of the glacier detached in July 2022, sparking an avalanche of debris that killed 11 hikers. The mountain is popular for hiking in summer and skiing in winter.\n\nThe University of Padua said in 2023 the glacier had been halved over 25 years.\n\nIt's expected to be mostly gone by 2034 if the world warms 2.7 Celsius (4.9 Fahrenheit), according to the Goodbye Glaciers Project. But if warming is limited to 1.5 C (2.7 F — the international goal — the glacier’s life could be extended by another six years, and around 100 glaciers in the Alps can be saved, Schmitt said.\n\n“Cutting greenhouse gas emissions now will reduce future ice loss and soften the impacts on people and nature,” Schmitt wrote in an email. “The choices we make in this decade will decide how much ice remains in the Dolomites, across the Alps, and around the world.”\n\nGlobally, more than 7 trillion tons of ice (6.5 trillion metric tons) has been lost since 2000, according to a study last year. And the prospective impact of climate change on Olympic sport is enormous; the list of places that could host Winter Games is projected to shrink substantially in the coming years.\n\nIn Cortina, Noa Szollos, who is competing for Israel, said in an interview the state of the nearby glaciers speaks to the condition of glaciers around the world.\n\n“I hope we can do something about it,” she said, “but it’s a hard time.”\n\nSilja Koskinen of Finland said in an interview she can’t train on some of the glaciers she used to because of crevices, rocks and flowing water. Team USA skier AJ Hurt talked about starting the season in October on glaciers in Sölden, Austria.\n\n“Every year, I feel like we come and there’s a little less snow. And every time, we’re like, are we really going to start in October? There’s no snow here,'” Hurt told the AP. “It is really sad and it’s hard to ignore in this sport, definitely, when we’re around it so much and it is so clear.”\n\nNorwegian skier Nikolai Schirmer is leading an effort to stop fossil fuel companies from sponsoring winter sports. Burning coal, oil and gas is the largest contributor to global climate change by far.\n\nIn Bormio, Italy, Team USA skier River Radamus said athletes — as stewards of outdoor winter sports— should be on the forefront of trying to defend the environment as best they can.\n\n“It’s always present in our mind that we’re on a dangerous trend unless we do something right,” Radamus said.\n\nAP Sports Writer Pat Graham contributed from Bormio, Italy.\n\nAP Winter Olympics coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics\n\nThe Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

    "fullText": "Javier Báez didn’t dodge responsibility. He didn’t deflect blame. And he didn’t sugarcoat how much it hurts.\n\nSpeaking Tuesday, Feb. 17, at spring training in Lakeland, the Detroit Tigers shortstop addressed his suspension from the 2026 World Baseball Classic, which will prevent him from representing Team Puerto Rico after testing positive for marijuana during the 2023 WBC.\n\n“I don’t want to point fingers at anybody because this is all my fault,” Báez said via the Detroit Free Press. “I’m the one that failed the test. … It’s just really frustrating that I won’t be able to be there. … It really hurts my family, my reputation, but it’s part of it. Other than that, I got a long season to go, and I got to prepare for that.”\n\nThe 2026 World Baseball Classic is scheduled to run from March 5–17, but Báez’s suspension — handed down by the World Baseball Softball Confederation (WBSC) — does not expire until April 26, making him ineligible for the tournament.\n\nWhile Major League Baseball has permitted marijuana use since 2020 under its jointly negotiated drug policy with the MLB Players Association, the WBSC still prohibits the substance. MLB and the MLBPA explored whether Báez could be cleared for the tournament, but those efforts ultimately failed.\n\n“I understand the rules,” Báez said. “It’s not like I was taking steroids or anything to last longer or whatever. They made that decision. I’m fine with it – I mean, I’m not fine with it. I just keep my mouth shut.”\n\nThe positive test dates back to March 12, 2023, during the previous WBC. As a result, Báez received a two-year period of ineligibility — from April 26, 2024, through April 26, 2026 — which bars him from WBSC-sanctioned events.\n\n“There are a lot of people mad and frustrated,” Báez said, “but it doesn’t hurt more than it hurts me. It’s time to turn the page and get ready for the season – and try to stay healthy.”\n\nThe timing makes the situation even more painful. Team Puerto Rico will host WBC games in 2026, marking the first time the tournament returns to the island since 2013. For Báez, the opportunity carried deep personal meaning.\n\n“One of my dreams is to play in Puerto Rico for Team Puerto Rico with our families, our fans, our island,” Báez said. “Nothing I can do. I’m just happy for all of my teammates that got the chance to represent. I wish them good luck.”\n\nBáez, who lives in Puerto Rico during the offseason, vividly remembers watching the inaugural 2006 World Baseball Classic as a 13-year-old fan in the stands at Hiram Bithorn Stadium in San Juan.\n\n“It’s been a long, long time since we played this tournament in Puerto Rico,” Báez said. “To have the chance to be a part of that, and now it’s away from me, it really hurts.”\n\nThe post Detroit Tigers’ Javier Báez Addresses Suspension, WBC Absence appeared first on Detroit Sports Nation.",

    "fullText": "Ireland and Australia have both been eliminated from the T20 World Cup as rain prevented play in the Group B game between the Irish and Zimbabwe at Pallekele Cricket Stadium in Kandy.\n\nZimbabwe's shock victory over Australia left them needing just a point on Tuesday to advance to the Super 8s with the match being a must-win for Ireland to retain any hope of advancing.\n\nAustralia, who suffered an eight-wicket defeat by Sri Lanka on Monday, were also banking on a win for Ireland to remain in the hunt for the next phase.\n\nBut with the rain unrelenting in Kandy the match was abandoned with both Ireland and Zimbabwe taking a point apiece.\n\nThat left Zimbabwe on five points and Ireland - whose four-game campaign is complete - on three, with Australia sitting on two and just one game remaining against Oman on Friday (13:30 GMT) which is now a dead rubber.\n\n\"It's very disappointing to go out in this fashion but it's completely uncontrollable,\" said Ireland stand-in skipper Lorcan Tucker.\n\n\"It looked like we were building momentum with the Oman win but unfortunately it came too late.\n\n\"I think when we look back there were moments, especially in the first game against Sri Lanka, which we didn't get quite right. It just wasn't to be - we started a bit slower than we wanted.\n\n\"Our group gained great experience from the tournament, for many it was their first World Cup. It's really competitive and shows the pressure elite cricketers are under.\n\n\"Those big moments, it's how you deal with them and process them. We hope to have big moments in the next couple of years and prepare well for the next tournament.\"\n\nZimbabwe will take on Sri Lanka in Colombo on Thursday (09:30 GMT) with the winner topping Group B, but they are both guaranteed a place in the next phase of the tournament.",

    "fullText": "Team GB's Winter Olympics curling medal hopes are now in serious jeopardy after Bruce Mouat's world champions were beaten 9-5 by Canada in Cortina.\n\nArriving in Italy as gold-medal favourites, the British quartet have lost four of their eight matches in a round-robin stage full of maybes and might have beens.\n\nNow, they must beat the United States in their final game on Wednesday (13:05 GMT) - and hope either Italy or Norway fail to win both their closing games, against the Canadians and the unbeaten Swiss - to reach Thursday's semi-finals and salvage their podium prospects.\n\nThe 2022 silver medallists have spoken all week of playing well, but coming out on the wrong side of the narrow margins. And that was the case again against their great rivals high in the Dolomites.\n\nA shot here and a shot there was the difference, as Canada kept their shape better in the big moments and confirmed their own progress.\n\n\"That wasn't a game where we played well,\" vice-skip Grant Hardie told BBC Sport. \"We made too many mistakes and we're running out of time to put it right.\n\n\"I think we can deliver the right result tomorrow and hopefully get into the semis.\"\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nMouat's rink have an excellent record against Brad Jacobs' team, and beat them in the last four of the worlds last spring.\n\nBut the Canadians knew they could improve their own chances - and inflict a little revenge - and they started strongly, opening a 3-1 lead after three ends.\n\nThe British team are considered the world's best, though, and righted themselves. Capitalising on a slight drop off by their opponents, they took two themselves in the fourth and another two in the sixth to lead with four to play.\n\nHowever, the clank of granite went against them in the seventh, an unfortunate bounce leaving Canada the chance of three, which they gladly took.\n\nMouat and his team needed to respond. They couldn't. Instead, they gave up a steal to leave themselves with a three-point deficit with two ends to play.\n\nIt was a deficit that they could not overcome. And now, their aspirations of upgrading their silver medal from Beijing are no longer in their own hands.\n\nGB's women are also in a perilous position, and also must beat the United States on Wednesday (08:05), as well as Japan later in the day (18:05) and Italy on Thursday (13:05) if they are to scrape into the last four.\n\nTeam GB finished 12th in the two-man bobsleigh after brakeman Taylor Lawrence withdrew from the final two runs and was replaced by Leon Greenwood.\n\nA statement from Team GB said that Lawrence, who missed several World Cup races last season because of a calf injury, sat out the race as a \"precautionary measure\" in preparation for the four-man event that begins later this week.\n\nGreenwood, making his Olympic debut, and pilot Brad Hall clocked 55.72 seconds and 56.17secs to give them a combined overall time of 3:43:43.\n\nIt was a disappointing showing from Hall, who is GB's most decorated men's bobsleigh pilot in World Cup history with 30 race medals.\n\n\"It wasn't plan A but with Leon [Greenwood] coming in last minute, we wanted to keep Taylor [Lawrence] safe, ready for the four-man,\" Hall told BBC Sport.\n\n\"We knew we were out of contention for the two-man so we just used it as extra training runs for the four-man.\"\n\nIt was a German clean sweep on the podium as Johannes Lochner and Georg Fleischhauer won gold while legendary pilot Francesco Friedrich and Alexander Schuller took silver with Adam Ammour and Alexander Schaller bronze.\n\nThe four-man event begins on Saturday with the medal-deciding runs on Sunday.\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "fullText": "Walsall head coach Mat Sadler said \"it's not my job to worry about that\" following a statement from the club's board last week in the midst of their stuttering promotion challenge.\n\nThe Saddlers have seen a four-point lead at the top of League Two in December whittle away into a 14-point deficit behind current leaders Bromley, slipping from first place to ninth in the process.\n\nTheir run of one win in eight league games since 26 December has seen them drop one point outside the play-off places and led to the board to announce last Friday they were \"aware of the urgency to improve results\".\n\nIn the build up to Wednesday's game at Grimsby, Sadler was asked about his take on what the board said.\n\n\"It's not my job to worry about that,\" he told BBC Radio WM.\n\n\"It's my job to make sure the players see me, win, lose or draw as exactly the same person.\n\n\"My role is doing exactly what we've done for the last three and a half years through scrutiny, through every single part of that.\"\n\n\"The belief I have in the players and their willingness to work all comes though me.

I'm certainly not looking back. I never will be because this is a completely different group and team,\" he said.\n\n\"It's not a completely different environment - we get constant reminders about that - our job is to focus on us and not on what anyone else is saying - good and bad.\n\n\"I live in a positive world. I recognise where we are, and where we want to get to, and we do that doing it our way.\n\n\"Everyone's human and different things happen. Sometimes that edge of uncertainty can affect people.

    "fullText": "CORTINA D’AMPEZZO, Italy (AP) — First came the expletives. Then the allegations. Then the media glare and hilarious memes.\n\nGlobal interest in curling surged over the past week when a cheating controversy erupted at the Winter Olympics, rocking a staid, 500-year-old sport known for its etiquette, manners and friendliness.\n\nAfter a wild few days for curling featuring plenty of verbal jousting and a brief rule change, things have calmed down and both players and officials appear ready to move on with the medal games approaching.\n\n“It’s the Olympics,” said Canadian curler Ben Hebert, whose team has been a central character in the controversy. “It’ll be over in two weeks and everyone will go back to covering curling in four years.”\n\nYet the headline-grabbing saga has highlighted some issues in a sport eager for exposure – and one slowly becoming more professional — but maybe isn’t ready for all the trappings that come with it.\n\nSweden crying foul over a rule infringement, an illegal double-touch by Canada’s Marc Kennedy in the act of releasing his stone down the ice, called into question whether the so-called “spirit of curling” had been broken.\n\nCurling, after all, has long been a tight-knit sport where players typically call their own fouls, shake hands at the end of a match and share a beer or two afterwards.\n\nThe Swedish and Canadian players have been long-time rivals but they’re also friendly. Couldn’t they just have dealt with this behind closed doors without all the bruising?\n\n“That’s where I think the spirit of curling is in a little bit of trouble,” Kennedy said, “and honestly that’s probably come from the quest for medals. But it’s OK. It’s all about the evolution of the sport. There’s opportunity here as well, right? For the sport to really figure it out as we all go forward.”\n\nIt seems the top of the sport isn’t quite ready for that.\n\nThere are no video replays in curling, unlike with sports like soccer, cricket and in the NFL, so officials aren’t allowed to re-umpire decisions like the hog line violation apparently committed by Kennedy when he poked one of the granite stones with his outstretched finger after releasing it.\n\nIn response, curling’s higher-ups first stationed umpires at the hog line to check for future fouls, but then reverted to the traditional practice of players policing themselves.\n\n“We’re trying to spread the word about our culture, and our culture is one based on integrity, and honor, and friendship,” World Curling President Beau Welling told The Associated Press in a phone interview. “We live by this code — the spirit of curling — where you’re expected to have honorable conduct on ice, but also off ice.\n\n“Obviously, this has been tested a little bit this week. But, fundamentally, that’s who we are,” he said. “And I really don’t see that changing.”\n\nSome might see this as sweeping the issue under curling's rug.\n\nYet this is the Olympic Games — it’s serious business, being played out in front of curling’s biggest audience.\n\n“Curling needs to professionalize a little bit,” Canada Curling CEO Nolan Thiessen told the AP at the Cortina Curling Center. “If we want to be where we want to be as a sport, there’s some steps we have to take, and some give and take probably. You know, having officials making subjective calls ... there’s a lot of sports that have that. And we probably need to get there as opposed to, ‘I think you did this’ and ‘Well, I don’t think I did.’\n\n“We’re trying,” he added, “to find the right balance as a sport.”\n\nThe Olympics soon will be without Sweden’s defending champion men’s team, which was officially eliminated from semifinal contention on Tuesday after a sixth loss in seven matches in round-robin play.\n\n“We maybe should have done something different and could have dealt with it differently,” Sweden skip Niklas Edin said of what he described as a “horrible week.”\n\nPlenty of curling traditionalists will no doubt agree with that.\n\nAP Sports Writer Jimmy Golen and Associated Press writer Julia Frankel contributed to this story.\n\nAP Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics",

The Italians claimed the gold medal by finishing 4 1/2 seconds faster than the American world record-holders, and that margin was so large that Giovannini pulled his two white-gloved hands together and pressed them to the side of his head at the close, just the way NBA star Curry does.\n\n“The last lap, we were in control,” Giovannini said, “and I was just waiting for that finish line to emulate Steph.”\n\nGiovannini said he remembered watching on TV during the 2024 Paris Summer Olympics when Curry did his signature move after one of his late 3-pointers sealed a 98-87 victory for the U.S. against France to win gold in men's basketball.\n\n“Emblematic of having cold blood,” Giovannini said.\n\nSo a couple of days ago, Giovannini was chatting with his Olympic roommate, speedskating teammate Francesco Betti, and told him he planned to go with the “Night night.”\n\n“It happened,” Giovannini said. “I was worried I would forget.”\n\nOne of the other team pursuit gold medalists, Ghiotto, said later he hadn't seen what Giovannini did — and actually wasn't even sure what the whole thing was about, because he wasn't aware of who Curry is.\n\nHearing that, Giovannini joked: “Tonight we’ll watch a basketball game.”\n\nThe American trio of Casey Dawson, Emery Lehman and Ethan Cepurian — who got the bronze in the event at the 2022 Beijing Olympics and set the world record in November — weren't aware of Giovannini's gesture.\n\n“It’s better,” Lehman said with a big laugh, “than getting two middle fingers from the Russians four years ago.”\n\nAP Sports Writer Daniella Matar contributed to this report.\n\nAP Winter Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics",

    "description": "One of the world's richest men and his son get another shot at the media conglomerate, which includes Warner Bros., HBO and CNN.",
    "fullText": "Larry and David Ellison are getting another shot to buy Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nThe media conglomerate announced Tuesday that it will let the Ellisons make another bid for the company over the next week, with two key stipulations: Their offer has to be more than $31 for each share of WBD, and it will be the last time the Ellisons get to make a formal pitch to the WBD board.\n\nWBD's announcement reopens a deal that was theoretically closed last December, when it agreed to sell most of itself to Netflix in an $83 billion transaction.\n\nSince then, the Ellisons, who bought Paramount last year and want to merge it with WBD, have argued that their offer of $30 per share — for the entire company — was better than Netflix's offer.\n\nThey have repeatedly told WBD and its investors that they should get another shot at making their case. Their most recent pitch came a week ago, when they offered to pay billions \n\nNow, WBD says, they have one more opportunity to bid. WBD says they expect the Ellisons to increase their offer to more than $31 a share. The company is trading around $28 a share, up 170% in the last year.\n\nIn a press release, WBD officials say that last week, a \"senior representative\" for Paramount told them that if they had the chance to bid, they would offer $31 per share, but could go above that.\n\nNone of this means the existing deal Netflix has with WBD goes away. For starters, WBD continues to formally endorse its Netflix deal. More important: If Paramount does increase its bid, Netflix will have the ability to raise its offer, too.\n\nAnd no matter what bid WBD eventually agrees to, the deal will still need regulatory approval in the US and overseas. Netflix got a preview of some of the issues regulators might bring up earlier this month during a congressional hearing, when Republicans argued that the company is too woke, and Democrats worried that a combined Netflix/WBD could doom the movie industry.\n\nA Paramount/WBD combination would also get regulatory scrutiny, though the Ellisons are counting on their ties to the Trump White House to give them a leg up.",

    "description": "The US has the world's largest military budget. Here's how military budgets compare around the world, and what they reveal about military priorities.",
    "fullText": "The US has the world's most expensive military, spending nearly $1 trillion on defense. That's roughly four times China's reported defense budget, the next largest.\n\nFrom spending on nuclear technology to advanced aircraft and warships, the world's top militaries allocate hundreds of billions of dollars each year to stay ahead.\n\nIn some countries, big-ticket items such as naval assets or technologically advanced aircraft or missiles account for the bulk of military spending, while others devote large sums to maintaining large conscription troop systems.\n\nUltimately, military spending varies by country depending on location and interests, Gian Gentile, a retired US Army colonel and senior historian at RAND, told Business Insider. Some countries prioritize homeland defense while others value overmatch and far-reaching power projection.\n\n\"The US spends a lot on more sophisticated, extremely precise weapon systems,\" he said.\n\nA military's budget can be measured either as a total amount or as a share of its country's GDP, reflecting the burden on its economy. Worldwide, countries spent an average of 2.4% of their GDP on defense in 2024.\n\nWartime spending as a share of GDP typically rises, putting strain on the civilian economy, said Mark Cancian, a senior advisor at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Ukraine in 2024, for example, devoted over 15% of its GDP to its military, the highest share globally.\n\nSpending statistics help paint a picture of defense priorities, but they don't always translate into readiness for conflict.\n\n\"Readiness is very expensive, and perishable,\" Cancian said.\n\nA country's on-paper investment in its defense systems doesn't always translate directly into military capability, he added. Training and maintenance are often overlooked in analyses of spending on equipment and technologies.\n\nA particularly significant cost when it comes to technologically advanced aircraft, for instance, is maintenance and sustainment.\n\nStill, looking at military budgets can reveal how much capital each country relies on to defend itself.\n\nLast year, the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a London-based think tank, released its Military Balance report, which included data on nearly every country's defense budget based on each's reported 2024 figures.\n\nThe report includes each country's total budget (in US dollars), per-capita figures, and defense budget as a share of GDP. Some countries, such as North Korea, Libya, Syria, Cuba, and Afghanistan, did not publicly report their defense budgets.\n\nThese are the 30 countries that spend the most on their military, ranked by the size of their defense budgets.\n\nDefense budget per capita: $3,785\n\nDefense budget per capita: $1,776\n\nDefense budget per capita: $1,157\n\nDefense budget per capita: $301\n\nDefense budget per capita: $170\n\nDefense budget per capita: $2,517\n\nDefense budget per capita: $799\n\nDefense budget per capita: $411\n\nDefense budget per capita: $455\n\nDefense budget per capita: $2,220\n\nDefense budget per capita: $1,328\n\nDefense budget per capita: $111\n\nDefense budget per capita: $696\n\nDefense budget per capita: $723\n\nDefense budget per capita: $797\n\nDefense budget per capita: $3,589\n\nDefense budget per capita: $578\n\nDefense budget per capita: $1,360\n\nDefense budget per capita: $842\n\nDefense budget per capita: $430\n\nDefense budget per capita: $937\n\nDefense budget per capita: $1,963\n\nDefense budget per capita: $1,184\n\nDefense budget per capita: $1,022\n\nDefense budget: $120.32 billion\n\nDefense budget per capita: $854\n\nDefense budget: $234.98 billion\n\nDefense budget per capita: $166\n\nDefense budget: $967.96 billion\n\nDefense budget per capita: $2,831",

    "fullText": "Former Ireland captain Johnny Sexton has said he does not think Edwin Edogbo \"paid too much attention\" to the racist abuse that was directed at him following his international debut.\n\nThe Irish Rugby Football Union (IRFU) had to turn off comments on a social media post that congratulated the Cork-born player for coming off the bench in the Six Nations game against Italy because of replies that contained racial abuse.\n\nOn Tuesday, the IRFU said it is hopeful \"we can bring something to the Gardai [Irish police]\" regarding the abuse.\n\n\"It's horrible to see that in this day and age, it still exists like that,\" said Ireland assistant coach Sexton.\n\n\"In terms of how he is, he's good. I don't think he would have paid too much attention to it, and I don't know if he would have even seen most of it.\n\n\"He's a pretty humble guy, really level-headed, but it's not right, some of the comments that were made.\n\n\"I feel for him, I feel for his family, it marred a pretty special day for him.\"\n\nIRFU keen to 'hold people to account' for racist abuse\n\nKeyboard warriors should 'cop on and help 10s' - Farrell\n\nI think Crowley starts against England - Murray\n\nSexton was speaking before Ireland's match against England on Saturday amid ongoing uncertainty over who will in the long term fill the number 10 jersey he wore with distinction.\n\nSam Prendergast has started both Six Nations games this year, but head coach Andy Farrell has Jack Crowley, Ciaran Frawley and Harry Byrne as options against England.\n\n\"It's important that they all keep developing and getting game-time,\" added Sexton, who won 118 Ireland caps.\n\n\"So there are four guys and all the criticism from previous World Cup cycles is that we didn't develop guys, and we have relied too heavily on one [player] in some positions.\n\n\"So we're doing it a different way now and whether that's right or wrong, everyone judges it by the outcome but I know that in games to come, they're going to hit their best form and they'll be in a good place.\"\n\nThe former British and Irish Lions fly-half emphasised Ireland's eagerness to have strength in depth for next year's World Cup.\n\n\"All four are very good, they've all got their different strengths and as coaches I think we are trying to make sure that we have lots of options going to a World Cup, try and learn from previous cycles and make sure that we give them all a certain number of caps,\" he added.\n\n\"We need to make sure that we see their form in different pressurised situations, in different venues against different opposition and yeah, I'm sure it will be like that for the foreseeable.\"",

Obviously, I know there's a World Cup coming up, but I've not really been a part of it recently.\n\n\"I'm not really expecting anything. I'm just enjoying myself and enjoying football again, which is the most important thing for me.\n\n\"If I can, hopefully, do some good performances, score some more goals and hopefully that is catching the eye a little bit and gives me a chance, at least.\n\n\"Obviously, it's an absolute honour to wear the badge and represent your country. It's such a privilege. Obviously, I would really love that again and to have that experience again.\n\n\"I cannot think too much on that. I have to just stay focused and do the best I can here and see what happens.\"\n\nBurke is in his third spell in Germany, having made his first move to the Bundesliga in 2016, when he joined RB Leipzeg from Nottingham Forest for what was then a record fee for a Scottish player of £13m.\n\n\"I was young, the price tag, I didn't really know too much about it,\" he recalled. \"I didn't really understand it so much at that age. As I got older, it started to weigh a little bit.\n\n\"In football, everything happens quickly. You have your good moments and then there can be bad moments.\n\n\"It's been kind of like this throughout my career. Many ups and many downs.\"\n\nBurke, who joined Union from Werder Bremen, says the experience he has in Germany has developed him.\n\n\"I almost feel like a different player, but obviously that comes with maturing,\" he said. \"Knowing your job better and being more effective in your role, defensively as well.\n\n\"It's just about adapting really.\"\n\nIn 2019, Burke had a spell on loan to Celtic, who play Stuttgart on Thursday in the Europa League play-off, and he is predicting a difficult tie for his former club.\n\n\"Stuttgart are not an easy team,\" he said. \"They're doing brilliantly this season.\n\n\"Celtic are an amazing club. I love the club. I still watch here and there.\n\n\"I watched the Kilmarnock game the other day. I was saying to my wife 'they're going to score in the last minute' because it's just Celtic typical.\"\n\nKirkcaldy-born Burke also had a stint with Alaves in Spain after his time with Celtic.\n\n\"When you move abroad, it's also important to try and embed yourself into the culture quickly and become close with your team-mates as fast as you can,\" he added.\n\n\"Create a bond, not just on the pitch but off it as well, so that you feel more comfortable and you feel more at home.\"",

They called me that when I was younger,” he said to ESPN.\n\n“But some people also tell me I play like Ibrahima Konate. It’s very similar. He’s a leader. For a defender, it’s very important to be a leader. Off and on the pitch, I talk a lot. It’s an important job. I think I anticipate well.\n\n“With the ball, I can pick a good pass.

    "fullText": "England captain Leah Williamson returns to the squad for the first time since Euro 2025 as they prepare to begin their 2027 Women's World Cup qualifying campaign.\n\nWilliamson, 28, missed England's friendly victories over China, Ghana and Australia as well as their defeat by Brazil at the end of 2025 due to a knee injury.\n\nThe Arsenal defender had surgery after lifting England's second successive European title in July and returned to action at the start of December.\n\n\"I'm very happy. It feels really good for her too. She has trained lots and I'm in close contact with her and the club,\" said manager Sarina Wiegman.\n\n\"There are more players who are still building and that is one of the reasons why we went with a bigger squad.\"\n\nSeveral big names return to the squad including Chelsea forward Lauren James, Manchester City defender Alex Greenwood and goalkeeper Hannah Hampton.\n\nJames, 24, was absent for four months with an ankle injury before returning in November and is now back to full fitness.\n\nShe impressed in Sunday's win over Liverpool and boosts Wiegman's attacking options with Arsenal's Beth Mead out with a fractured shin.\n\nGreenwood, 32, missed the start of the season with a knee injury while Hampton had a thigh issue which ruled her out of the November camp.\n\nThere is a first senior call-up for London City Lionesses defender Poppy Pattinson, while uncapped 20-year-old Freya Godfrey retains her place in the squad.\n\nAston Villa goalkeeper Ellie Roebuck also earns a recall, with Manchester City's Khiara Keating dropping out of the squad.\n\n\"[Roebuck] came in the last camp of course because we had some injuries. She has got some minutes [with Villa] so it's really good to see her back, see her happy and being available. She is playing and training fully,\" added Wiegman.\n\n\"Keating will be with the under-23s. We all know she is a very talented goalkeeper. I had big concerns about her playing minutes over this last season.\n\n\"It's a long period of time. There is also competition with the other goalkeepers.\"\n\nGotham FC defender Jess Carter is back after she was given time to recover from the conclusion of the National Women's Soccer League play-offs in November.\n\nEngland are without Manchester United midfielder Ella Toone, who is out with a hip injury until the end of March.\n\nBay FC defender Anouk Denton, 22, who made her debut as a late substitute in December, is not included in the squad.\n\nThe Lionesses travel to Turkey to face Ukraine on Tuesday, 3 March (17:00 GMT) before hosting Iceland at the City Ground on Saturday, 7 March (12:30).\n\nThey are the first competitive games since England's success in Switzerland and they will meet reigning world champions Spain later in their qualifying group.\n\nThere are eight international windows before England hope to travel to Brazil for the World Cup between 24 June and 25 July 2027.\n\n\"It's a new year with new objectives as we start our qualification journey with these two very important fixtures against Ukraine and Iceland,\" said Wiegman.\n\n\"This is new opposition for this England team, so that's exciting too. I am looking forward to being back with the squad and getting back to work.\"\n\nSuccess in 2025 - are the Lionesses ready for 2026?\n\nLondon City Lionesses defender Pattinson has featured for England's youth teams and is the latest to make the jump up to the senior squad.\n\nShe follows in the footsteps of team-mate Godfrey, who is yet to make her debut having been selected for the friendlies against Ghana and China.\n\nWiegman was at Leigh Sports Village on Sunday to watch Pattinson in London City Lionesses' 2-1 defeat by Manchester United and delivered the news of her England call-up this week.\n\n\"It was a short conversation but she was really happy and really grateful. She can't wait to come in so that was a nice phone call,\" Wiegman told BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\n\"She deserved the call-up because she has played really well. What we have seen the most is that she is very proactive and takes a lot of initiative.\n\n\"She can cover the whole wing on the left side. At the same time, she wants to play forward and is looking for passes forward which I thought was really good.\n\n\"Although she is not the tallest, she does use her body well in defence. Let's see how she relates to the other players we have in the squad.\"\n\nGoalkeepers: Hannah Hampton (Chelsea), Anna Moorhouse (Orlando Pride), Ellie Roebuck (Aston Villa)\n\nDefenders: Lucy Bronze (Chelsea), Jess Carter (Gotham), Grace Fisk (Liverpool), Alex Greenwood (Manchester City), Lotte Wubben-Moy (Arsenal), Maya Le Tissier (Manchester United), Esme Morgan (Washington Spirit), Taylor Hinds (Arsenal), Poppy Pattinson (London City Lionesses), Leah Williamson (Arsenal)\n\nMidfielders: Grace Clinton (Manchester City), Georgia Stanway (Bayern Munich), Keira Walsh (Chelsea), Laura Blindkilde Brown (Manchester City), Lucia Kendell (Aston Villa)\n\nForwards: Chloe Kelly (Arsenal), Lauren James (Chelsea), Aggie Beever-Jones (Chelsea), Alessia Russo (Arsenal), Lauren Hemp (Manchester City), Freya Godfrey (London City Lionesses), Jess Park (Manchester United)",

    "fullText": "China is a huge market for the NBA, and that is nothing new. Among the league’s international audiences, few countries can go toe to toe with the second-most populous nation in the world. Because of that, the NBA makes sure to establish its presence on the ground every single year. The face of the league, LeBron James, understands this as well.\n\nJames has been to China 15 times so far for his Nike promo tour. It’s also not been that long since his last visit, with the King traveling to China as recently as 2025 to promote his “Forever King” tour, to promote his LeBron 23 shoes. Was it also a farewell visit? One last visit to China?\n\nNot according to James, who, during media availability at All-Star Weekend, admitted that he would like to make another trip to the East.\n\n“To all my fans and people over there it’s always been great,” James stated. “Always welcomed me and my friends and family in open arms. I’ve always appreciated it, they’re be another opportunity for me to go over there at some point.”\n\nJames has remained coy on his relationship with China over the years. He found himself in hot water in 2019 when he went against Daryl Morey’s statement on China.\n\n“I don’t want to get in a word or sentence feud with Daryl Morey, but I believe he wasn’t educated on the situation at hand, and he spoke.”\n\nSince then James has returned to China on a semi-regular basis as he did before the incident as well. So, it’s safe to say he’s welcome in the country to quite a fair extent.\n\nEven if James retires from the NBA after the 2025-26 season, as some believe he will, Nike, which has supported him throughout his career, would still look to capitalize on his popularity in China. Both James and the iconic American brand remain hugely popular there, despite the political tensions between the two countries.\n\nAt the same time, it looks as though James has another country in his mind he would love to visit. And that’s Israel.\n\nIn the same presser in L.A., James was asked about his thoughts on the Middle-Eastern country, and his reply showed that he really wanted to go there. “If I have fans over there — I’ve never been there — I hope you follow my career, I hope I inspire people over there.”\n\n“Not only to be great in sports, but to be better in general in life, hopefully someday I can make it over there,” the Lakers icon added. “I’ve heard great things and I appreciate the question.”\n\nFor now, though, James cannot travel anywhere that far from home. Crunch time in the season is here with the All-Star break nearly over, and his focus is solely on possibly ending his career with a fifth ring.\n\nThe post LeBron James Admits To Wanting To Visit China “At Some Point” appeared first on The SportsRush.",

    "description": "Nvidia was his dream job, but he got turned down. So this 30-year-old regrouped and strategized. He shares how he got a job offer there.",
    "fullText": "As Sylendran Arunagiri considered moving from India to the US to pursue a master's degree, some friends and mentors advised him to delay his move. They warned that the US tech job market had become too challenging.\n\nArunagiri's goal was to move to the US in late 2023, begin a master's program in product management at Carnegie Mellon University, and land a Big Tech internship for the summer of 2024. He hoped this would be a stepping stone toward landing an AI-related role, ideally at Nvidia, his \"dream company\" because of its central role in the AI technologies he'd long wanted to work on.\n\nHowever, there were several things working against him. For one, the US tech hiring landscape was already creating headaches for job seekers. Openings had plummeted from highs reached a year earlier, and industry layoffs were increasing competition for available roles.\n\nAdditionally, Arunagiri had grown accustomed to the job market in India, where he earned a bachelor's degree and an MBA from top institutions that he said relied on structured campus placement programs to funnel many students directly into jobs. But from what he'd heard, the US was very different. Job fairs were often more like networking events than recruiting opportunities.\n\n\"You're completely on your own,\" said the 30-year-old, who now lives in San Jose.\n\nArunagiri is among the many job seekers who have struggled to navigate a US hiring landscape that's become more challenging in recent years. Amid economic uncertainty, the early effects of generative AI adoption, and a broader push to streamline operations, US businesses are now hiring at one of the slowest rates since 2013.\n\nStill, some people have managed to break through in a challenging market. Arunagiri shared how he pursued his goal of working at Nvidia — a company he described as his dream employer — and offered his top advice for other job seekers.\n\nMany of the tech companies Arunagiri was targeting had conducted summer internship interviews the previous fall, so he began applying before moving to the US. After sending out many applications, he landed an interview with Nvidia in November 2023.\n\nArunagiri said the interview process went so well that he stopped applying to other internships. But after moving to the US and completing his final interview in February, he learned that he wouldn't be getting the role — which left him scrambling to find another internship.\n\n\"I had to start from scratch, but by then many of the applications had dried out,\" he said\n\nArunagiri was able to land an AI product manager internship based in India at the tech company Informatica. However, that summer, he found it difficult to stop thinking about what went wrong during his interview process with Nvidia — and began setting his sights on eventually landing a full-time role with the company.\n\nUpon reflection, Arunagiri suspected that his final Nvidia interview may have doomed him. He said he was lower energy than usual because he was feeling sick that day, and that he'd been hesitant to postpone it out of fear that the opportunity would be filled in the meantime. In hindsight, he said that decision was likely a mistake.\n\n\"I came off as a dull candidate, but I'm usually energetic and conversational,\" he said. \"I should have probably postponed it to a day that I was feeling better.\"\n\nArunagiri decided to reach out to an HR professional from Nvidia to get insight into where he fell short, and they agreed to jump on a call with him. While they didn't provide specific insights into his candidacy, he said they recommended he try to connect with people at Nvidia in current roles, including hiring managers and interns, to get insight into the kinds of projects they were working on and how he could better align his profile.\n\nHe eventually connected with about five Nvidia interns, who he said provided valuable insights. Those conversations helped shape the personal AI-related projects he began pursuing and sharing on LinkedIn in hopes of standing out.\n\nAfter the summer, Arunagiri dove back into the job search, eager to land a role before he graduated in December 2024. He knew that if he didn't land a job within 90 days after graduation, his F-1 visa restrictions would force him to return to India.\n\nIn September 2024, he submitted a cold application for a technical product marketing role in agentic AI at Nvidia —a role he described as his \"dream AI role\" at his dream company. He was asked to interview starting in October, and around the same time, he was also invited to interview for a more junior product management role at Microsoft.\n\nIn December, with his graduation looming later that month, Arunagiri received offers from Nvidia and Microsoft within days of each other. Given that Nvidia was his dream employer, the role checked a lot of his boxes, and the pay was higher than Microsoft's, he said the decision was fairly easy — and he accepted Nvidia's offer. He said that so far, working at Nvidia has been \"everything that I've dreamed of.\"\n\nArunagiri believes that his LinkedIn presence helped him stand out. During the interview process, he said, the hiring manager told him that he'd reviewed his LinkedIn profile and noticed the projects he'd been working on, including small experiments with new generative AI tools and models he'd shared publicly.\n\nHe has a few pieces of advice for job seekers. First, he said, time management is key, particularly because applying for jobs and connecting with people can be time-consuming. Second, he said, never compare your job search journey to anyone else's, since a variety of factors can influence how it plays out.\n\nRather than quietly applying and networking, he recommends sharing tangible projects publicly — such as posting about AI tools you've explored and linking to projects on LinkedIn or a personal website — so hiring managers can see your work.\n\n\"You need to find something that sets you apart from others,\" he said.",

The first full workout for the Blue Jays at spring training Monday brought some clarity to that plan.  “When I left, I felt like I had faced reality, and the only thing I had left to say to myself was just thank God for the year I had, for the year the team had had,” Guerrero said through an interpreter.",
    "fullText": "DUNEDIN, Fla. (AP) — Vladimir Guerrero Jr. was the last person to leave the Toronto dugout after the Game 7 loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers in the World Series last fall because the star slugger wanted that to be the moment when he moved on.\n\nThe first full workout for the Blue Jays at spring training Monday brought some clarity to that plan.\n\n“When I left, I felt like I had faced reality, and the only thing I had left to say to myself was just thank God for the year I had, for the year the team had had,” Guerrero said through an interpreter. “Right then, I just turned the page.”\n\nThe Blue Jays lost the decisive game 5-4 in 11 innings, missing on a second consecutive chance to clinch the franchise's third championship at home. For manager John Schneider, this spring training is no different from a year ago.\n\n“The main message is we’re not defending anything,” Schneider said. “We’re not defending the AL East. We’re not defending the American League. We’re attacking 2026 like we did in 2025 or any year, really. You’re trying to win the division, you’re trying to win the World Series. That’s it.”\n\nGuerrero jolted the franchise at the start of the spring last year, when he said there was no deal on a new contract and that his own deadline for getting one done had passed, raising the specter of free agency in 2026.\n\nInstead, the sides settled on a $500 million, 14-year contract early last season, and the son of Hall of Famer Vladimir Guerrero went on to hit .292 with 23 home runs and 84 RBIs.\n\nIn the postseason, Guerrero had a 1.289 OPS while hitting .397 with eight homers in 18 games and was MVP of the American League Championship Series. He didn't homer in any of his first three trips to the playoffs, and the Blue Jays lost all six of those games.\n\n“Going back to the postseason last year, I think it’s really cool for everyone to be on that heightened stage and to see how they responded,” Schneider said. “I think that kind of bleeds into this year, but (Guerrero) has been a little bit more vocal than I’ve ever seen him, a little bit more loose than I’ve ever seen him and understands that he’s one of the best players in the game.”\n\nThe 26-year-old Guerrero, a five-time All-Star, is now the longest-tenured Blue Jays player.\n\n“I don’t see myself as a leader,” Guerrero said. “I always put myself as a good teammate, and when you are a good teammate, then you become a good leader. I’m a good teammate.”\n\nHis role as the face of the franchise was cemented when Bo Bichette left the team, signing a $126 million, three-year with the New York Mets and moving from shortstop to third base.\n\n“It’s difficult not having him around,” said Guerrero, who played with Bichette through the minor leagues. “I mean, we played 10 years together. But at the same time, I understand it’s business, and he has to take care of his family as well.”\n\nThe Blue Jays signed Japanese infielder Kazuma Okamoto to fill the void left by Bichette while adding pitchers Dylan Cease and Cody Ponce.\n\n“I think we’re very capable,” Guerrero said. “I think it’s going to be more fun, and I’m actually more happy than last year.”\n\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB",

    "description": "The Lionesses return to competitive action next month as their campaign to qualify for the 2027 Women's World Cup begins. So what changes could we see?",
    "fullText": "The Lionesses return to competitive action next month as their campaign to qualify for the 2027 Women's World Cup in Brazil begins.\n\nSarina Wiegman's side travel to Turkey to face Ukraine on Tuesday, 3 March (17:00 GMT) before hosting Iceland at the City Ground on Saturday, 7 March (12:30).\n\nThere are just eight international camps before England hope to be in Brazil for the World Cup - so they will want to ensure there are no slip-ups in their first qualifying matches of the year.\n\nEngland have been drawn in a qualifying group alongside 2023 winners Spain - who beat the Lionesses in the final - as well as Ukraine and Iceland.\n\nWiegman will name her squad for the first time in 2026 on Tuesday at 11:00 - who might feature and what are the key decisions for the Dutchwoman?\n\nSuccess in 2025 - are the Lionesses ready for 2026?\n\nEngland have not had a competitive fixture since winning Euro 2025 as they beat China 8-0 and Ghana 2-0 in friendly matches at the end of last year.\n\nBefore that, they suffered a 2-1 defeat by Brazil on their homecoming return but recorded a 3-0 win over Australia three days later.\n\nThe matches gave Wiegman an opportunity to test new players and formations - handing a debut to 30-year-old goalkeeper Anna Moorhouse in the process.\n\nAmong those to receive their first senior call-ups to the squad were defenders Anouk Denton, Taylor Hinds and forward Freya Godfrey.\n\nThere was also time for England stars Leah Williamson, Lucy Bronze and Lauren James to recover from lengthy injuries.\n\nChelsea defender Millie Bright, who captained England to the World Cup final in 2023, announced her retirement in October having withdrawn from the Euros.\n\nThere was a serious blow for Arsenal forward Michelle Agyemang - one of England's key players in Switzerland - as she was carried off on a stretcher after suffering an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury during the win over Australia.\n\nBut it's been a successful time for the other Lionesses in Arsenal's squad, including captain Williamson, who lifted the Champions Cup in February.\n\nAnd Chelsea goalkeeper Hannah Hampton was named the world's best goalkeeper at the Ballon d'Or awards in September, as Wiegman picked up the best coach award.\n\nHampton also wrapped up the BBC Women's Footballer of the Year award in November after being caught up in the fallout of Mary Earps' autobiography, which was released earlier that month.\n\nMost of Wiegman's key players have returned from injury in recent weeks - but there will still be some noteable absentees.\n\nManchester United midfielder Ella Toone is out with a hip issue until the end of March so will not feature against Ukraine or Iceland.\n\nThere are not many midfield options available with Aston Villa's Missy Bo Kearns also absent, while team-mate Lucia Kendall came off the bench to play 28 minutes of Villa's 7-3 thrashing by Tottenham on Sunday - her first appearance in five weeks due to a thigh injury.\n\nElsewhere, Arsenal winger Beth Mead fractured her shin so is out but Chloe Kelly made her return at the end of January and is available for selection.\n\nArsenal defender Hinds has had an ankle injury that has kept her out for a few weeks but she could still be included.\n\nChelsea full-back Niamh Charles is also sidelined with an ankle injury but team-mate Aggie Beever-Jones came on as an 83rd-minute substitute in their win over Liverpool on Sunday so her return is timely.\n\nTottenham full-back Ella Morris is close to returning from the ACL injury she suffered last year but will not be back in time.\n\nMeanwhile, Agyemang and Arsenal defender Katie Reid are still recovering from their respective ACL injuries.\n\nThere remains a lack of full-back options for Wiegman with Manchester United captain Maya Le Tissier seen as back-up for Bronze despite playing her club football at centre-back every week.\n\nCharles' absence and Hinds' recent injury means there are limited options at left-back too - meaning Manchester City's Alex Greenwood could once again make the switch from centre-back to full-back.\n\nThere could be a recall for Bay FC's Anouk Denton, who moved to the American club from West Ham in February, two months after making her England debut.\n\nLondon City Lionesses forward Godfrey has impressed this season and Wiegman was at Leigh Sports Village on Sunday to see her grab an assist in a 2-1 defeat by Manchester United.\n\nThe 20-year-old was called up for the first time in November but remains uncapped - so she will hope to feature this time around.\n\nTeam-mate Izzy Goodwin could be a surprise call-up in Beth Mead's absence, though Chelsea's James is back so Wiegman has other attacking options.\n\nWiegman will need to manage players like Kelly, Bronze and Keira Walsh who have not been fully fit in recent weeks and they may not be able to start both games.\n\nBut she will have been boosted by James' impressive display for Chelsea on Sunday, while Jess Park has shone for United and Lauren Hemp for Manchester City.",

    "fullText": "England narrowly avoided a disaster in their final T20 World Cup group match against Italy on Monday.\n\nHarry Brook won the toss and controversially decided to bat first at Eden Gardens in Kolkata.\n\nEngland were 105/5 after a shaky opening 13 overs before Will Jacks rescued the innings with an unbeaten 53 from 22 balls.\n\nItaly then battled back from 22/3 to 135/4 in their run chase, making the England players and fans nervous.\n\nHowever, the Italians ultimately collapsed to 178 all out, and the Three Lions qualified for the Super 8s.\n\nBrook made an interesting comment about England’s performance in his post-match interview, which many will disagree with.\n\nHarry Brook has every reason to be pleased with his team’s progression into the last eight of the competition.\n\nHowever, it would be foolish to suggest that England’s performance against Italy was anything to be proud of.\n\nItaly are the 26th-ranked team in the ICC T20I Team Rankings, so it should never have been a close contest.\n\nThat is why it was so surprising to hear Brook’s claim that England bowled well on Monday.\n\n“I thought we fielded excellently, and we bowled nicely as well,” he said. “I never had a doubt at the end with Sam [Curran] and Jamie [Overton]. Sam has been awesome, and he has been throughout this comp so far.\n\n“When Jof is on a heater, you want to get as much out of as possible – he did that today in his first couple of overs.”\n\nWithout question, England will need to bowl much better in the next stage of the tournament if they want to make the semi-finals.\n\nWhile Brook praised England’s bowlers, he did recognise that their batting unit must improve quickly.\n\n“We haven’t played our best cricket,” he added. “At the end of the day, we have made it through, and we’re heading to Sri Lanka, so we can be happy about that.\n\n“A little bit of a trend in this competition. We have not managed to string along the score as we like to do as a batting unit. We have got to keep on being brave and taking our options.”\n\n202 would normally be an excellent T20 score, but England would have hoped for at least 220 against cricket minnows Italy.\n\nBen Stokes finally has a rude awakening about importance of helmets in cricket\n\nMatthew Renshaw’s scathing interview reveals main culprit behind Australia’s disastrous loss vs. Zimbabwe\n\nSir Geoffrey Boycott reignites Joe Root debate after England’s T20 World Cup loss to West Indies",

    "fullText": "PARIS, Feb 16 (Reuters) - French police searched the Arab World Institute in Paris on Monday as part of a ‌probe into its former head, ex-culture minister Jack Lang, and ‌his links to late convicted U.S. sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, prosecutors said.\n\nFrance's National Financial Prosecutor (PNF) said ​in a statement that the Arab World Institute was among several locations being raided.\n\nProsecutors this month opened a preliminary investigation of Lang and his daughter Caroline on suspicion of tax fraud following the release of documents on Epstein in ‌the U.S.\n\nLang, who was ⁠culture minister under late Socialist president Francois Mitterrand, resigned this month from the Arab World Institute, which he had led ⁠since 2013.\n\nHe has said he was unaware of Epstein's crimes despite corresponding with him between 2012 and 2019, 11 years after the financier was convicted of soliciting ​prostitution ​from an underage girl.

    "title": "Nvidia: A complete guide to the hardware company behind the AI boom",
    "description": "Nvidia is one of the world's most valuable companies. Read about its history, leadership, and financials.",
    "fullText": "Nvidia has been around for over three decades, but the chipmaker became a household name only in the past few years.\n\nIn October 2025, the AI chipmaker became the first company to hit a $5 trillion market cap.\n\nNvidia was founded in 1993 by Jensen Huang, Chris Malachowsky, and Curtis Priem, \"with a vision to bring 3D graphics to the gaming and multimedia markets.\"\n\nThe boom in AI technology has made it one of the most valuable companies in the world as companies scramble to buy its graphics processing units. Here's what you need to know about Nvidia.\n\nNvidia's origin story began at a Denny's during a meeting between Huang — who once worked for the chain — Malachowsky, and Priem.\n\nPersonal computing was on the cusp of taking off, and the trio sought a way to capitalize on it. Huang said in a 2010 interview with Stanford University's engineering school that they \"wondered whether starting a graphics company would be a good idea.\"\n\n\"We brainstormed and fantasized about what kind of company it would be and the world we could help,\" he said. \"It was fun.\"\n\nTheir goal was to improve the experience of gaming on a PC.\n\nIn 2006, it released CUDA, a general-purpose programming interface that would expand its business far beyond gaming.\n\nOn Sequoia Capital's \"Crucible Moments\" podcast, Andrew Ng, a Stanford professor who founded Google Brain, recalled his students telling him, \"Hey, Andrew, there's this thing called CUDA — not that easy to program, but it's letting people use GPUs for something different.\"\n\n\"We started to see 10x or even 100x speedups training neural networks on GPUs because we could do 1,000 or 10,000 things in parallel rather than one step after another,\" he added.\n\nNvidia's GPUs were used to train AlexNet, an image classification system unveiled in 2012 that significantly influenced the field of deep learning.\n\nThe launch of ChatGPT in late 2022 ushered Nvidia into a new era. The chipmaker's shares surged by more than 1,000% from 2022 to early 2026.\n\nMuch of that growth came from the success of Nvidia's H100 chip, which it released in March 2022. The $40,000 chip, named for the computer scientist Grace Hopper, has played a crucial role in providing the computing power for large language models.\n\nSince the launch of Nvidia's Blackwell chips, which are twice as fast as its Hopper chips, customers including SoftBank, Amazon Web Services, and Microsoft have also flocked to the company.\n\nNvidia's success may be best personified by its CEO, Jensen Huang.\n\nA 61-year-old bona fide tech mogul, Huang has a net worth of about $165 billion, according to Forbes. While some execs sport chains or Patagonia vests, Huang is often spotted in a leather jacket. Business Insider identified at least six versions he's worn over the years, including a nearly $9,000 lizard-embossed coat from Tom Ford he wore at the company's global AI conference, GTC, in 2024. He commemorated Nvidia's stock price hitting $100 with a tattoo of Nvidia's logo on his arm.\n\nHuang's early years were tumultuous. He was born in Taiwan, and he spent time there and in Thailand before his parents sent him to the United States because of social unrest in the region.\n\nHe attended a reform school in Kentucky. He later moved to Oregon, where he was reunited with his parents. In high school, he became a nationally ranked table tennis champion.\n\nHuang graduated from Oregon State University with a degree in electrical engineering in 1984.\n\nDuring his freshman year, Huang met Lori Mills, his future wife. In an interview at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, he said he won her over by offering to help her with her homework. They married five years after meeting and now have two children.\n\nJensen Huang later earned a master's in electrical engineering from Stanford, and he worked at the chip companies LSI Logic and Advanced Micro Devices before launching Nvidia.\n\nHuang sold about 1.3 million shares of Nvidia when the company hit a $3 trillion market cap in June 2024, but he retains a more than 3% stake in the company.\n\nNvidia's business is built around GPUs, which can handle tasks simultaneously, as opposed to central processing units, or CPUs, which are in standard computers.\n\nNvidia's GPUs have become a mainstay of the AI revolution because they provide the computing power needed to run massive large language models like OpenAI's GPT-4 and Meta's Llama 3.\n\nDemand for Nvidia's H100 chips, built on its Hopper architecture, has been so high in late 2023 and 2024 that tech execs like Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk have bragged about how many units they're training new technology on. ByteDance has found workarounds to the US export bans on the chips to China. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have bought up thousands of units to fuel their AI ambitions, while venture capitalists have bought Nvidia GPUs as backup units for their startups.\n\nIn 2024, Nvidia unveiled its Blackwell chips, which it says are twice as fast as its Hopper chips and have attracted customers including SoftBank, Amazon Web Services, and Microsoft. The recent frenzy around the Chinese company DeepSeek's models has fueled demand for Nvidia's H200 chips.\n\nIn January 2025, Huang also unveiled new chips targeting the gaming, robotics, and autonomous vehicle industries, as well as partnerships with Toyota and Microsoft.\n\nAt the January 2026 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Huang unveiled the new Vera Rubin architecture that will succeed Blackwell. During his presentation, Huang said Vera Rubin is built to confront the core problem of a surge in computing demand.\n\nCompared with Nvidia's Blackwell architecture, Huang said Rubin delivers more than three times the performance, can run inference up to five times faster, and offers significantly higher inference compute per watt.\n\nA key to Nvidia's success is also CUDA, a software layer that can link GPUs to almost any AI application a developer wants to run. It's a critical component of the competitive advantage, or moat, that Nvidia has built up over the years.\n\nStill, AMD, Nvidia's main competitor, is quietly catching up. In October 2025, AMD announced a major multi-year strategic partnership with OpenAI under which OpenAI will deploy up to 6 gigawatts of AMD Instinct GPUs for its AI infrastructure starting in the second half of 2026. The deal is expected to bring tens of billions of dollars in revenue to AMD over time.\n\nNvidia's other competitors include Intel and IBM. Tech giants like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta have also released their own AI chips.\n\nNvidia overtook Apple and Microsoft for the title of the most valuable company in the world when it hit a historic $5 trillion in market capitalization in October 2025.\n\nAfter a tumultuous start to 2025 over chip export restrictions to China that would have cost billions in losses for Nvidia, Nvidia is heading into 2026 with confidence that demand for its AI chips is far from peaking.\n\nIn 2025, the chipmaker's blockbuster third-quarter results brought in $57 billion in revenue, including $51 billion from its data center business alone, beating Wall Street expectations. Nvidia raised its fourth-quarter forecast to $65 billion in sales, helping revive AI and semiconductor stocks after a brief slump. Shares of Nvidia and peers rallied on the upbeat outlook.\n\nHuang repeatedly dismissed fears of an AI bubble, arguing that the shift from CPUs to GPUs, the rise of agentic AI, and monetization through advertising all point to sustained growth. Nvidia also expanded its influence through major partnerships with OpenAI, Anthropic, and hyperscalers such as Meta.\n\nLooking to 2026, Nvidia is betting big on next-generation chips like Blackwell Ultra, massive AI infrastructure projects, and growth areas including robotics and automotive. While US export restrictions on China remain a headwind, Nvidia expects hyperscalers and global AI investment to keep demand strong into next year.\n\nNvidia is based in Santa Clara, California. Nvidia's headquarters, known as Voyager, was designed by the architectural firm Gensler and is about 750,000 square feet.\n\nIt has parks, \"treehouses\" for gatherings, and places designed to help employees focus. However, the overall design is intended to facilitate Nvidia's flat organizational structure.\n\n\"When you're moving that fast, you want to make sure that that information is flowing through the company as quickly as possible,\" Huang told the Harvard Business Review in 2023.\n\nIt's also a way to create more harmony between leadership and workers. Huang, who in 2023 oversaw 50 direct reports, has said that CEOs \"by definition\" should have the most direct reports at a company.\n\nHuang has earned a reputation among those who work with him as a demanding boss. Meetings with Huang can get heated, and senior employees have described his tough questions as a \"Jensen grilling.\"\n\nNvidia's top executives include Ian Buck, a vice president of hyperscale and high-performance computing; Colette Kress, the chief financial officer; and Bryan Catanzaro, a vice president of applied deep learning research.\n\nLanding a job at Nvidia isn't easy, but Lindsey Duran, a VP of recruitment, told BI that Nvidia applicants should express an interest in generative AI, tap into their professional network for referrals, and aim to do an internship.",

    "fullText": "Men's T20 World Cup, Group B, Pallekele\n\nAustralia 181 all out (20 overs): Head 56 (29); Hemantha 3-37\n\nSri Lanka 184-2 (18 overs): Nissanka 100* (52), Kusal Mendis 51 (38)\n\nAustralia's hopes of reaching the Super 8 stage of the T20 World Cup are all but over after Sri Lanka's Pathum Nissanka hit a brilliant unbeaten 100 to condemn them to an eight-wicket defeat in Pallekele.\n\nStunned by Zimbabwe in their second outing on Friday, Australia needed a win to keep their qualification fate in their own hands but it is Sri Lanka who march into the next round.\n\nFor Australia to sneak through as the second-placed team from their group, they now need Zimbabwe to lose both of their remaining matches against Ireland and Sri Lanka and then to defeat Oman themselves which would bring net run-rate into play.\n\nAustralia's predicament came from their inability to convert a good start from their openers Travis Head and Mitchell Marsh as they set the home side a target of 182 after a collapse in the second half of their innings.\n\nDespite the feeling Sri Lanka could have a complicated chase on their hands because of a pitch which was slowing down, they eased to victory with the Australian bowling attack lacking any bite in the absence of injured Pat Cummins, Josh Hazlewood and Mitchell Starc.\n\nAnd the Sri Lanka duo of Nissanka and Kusal Mendis took full advantage.\n\nWith wicketkeeper Mendis providing perfect support with a composed 51 from 38 balls, Nissanka brought up his century in 52 balls to take his side past the finish line with an innings that blended brute power and finesse.\n\nAustralia had Marsh return after recovering from a groin injury that forced him out of the first two matches and the returning skipper gave his side a solid platform batting alongside Head, who hit a long-overdue half-century off 27 balls.\n\nThey powered Australia to 104-0 in 8.2 overs before Head departed for 59 and it marked the beginning of dramatic downturn.\n\nMarsh followed him shortly after with a brisk 54 as they unravelled alarmingly to be bundled out for 181, losing their final five wickets in the space of just seven runs and 14 balls.\n\nWith Sri Lanka chasing down the target with ease, the Australians are left clinging to only the slimmest mathematical hope and will watch nervously as Zimbabwe face Ireland on Tuesday.\n\nIt looked as though Sri Lanka's chase of 182 might slip away early when Kusal Perera fell to Marcus Stoinis only eight balls in.\n\nBut it became clear almost immediately Nissanka was operating on an entirely different level in Pallekele, playing \"an innings for the ages,\" as Test Match Special commentator Daniel Norcross labelled it.\n\nNissanka raced to 38 off 20 balls to lift Sri Lanka to 61‑1 at the end of the powerplay.\n\nKusal Mendis then picked up the pace against Australia's spinners, bringing up his third consecutive half-century of this T20 World Cup in 35 balls before Nissanka joined him, reaching his fifty in just 32 deliveries.\n\nAustralia would have hoped for a way back after Mendis departed in the 13th over with Sri Lanka on 105‑2, and though Pavan Rathnayake walked in, he only needed to play second fiddle to Nissanka, who effortlessly took Sri Lanka past the target.\n\nThe 27‑year‑old Sri Lanka opener was outstanding in manipulating the leg‑side field all game, scoring 26 runs through mid‑wicket and another 20 through square leg.\n\nBut he mixed brutal hitting with plenty of finesse too, guiding 15 runs down to third with some deft late cuts.\n\nAdding extra sweetness to Nissanka's day was an extraordinary catch he took to dismiss Glenn Maxwell and keep Australia at bay in the closing stages of their innings.\n\nHaving dropped Maxwell in the previous over, Nissanka more than made up for it with a brilliant flying catch at backward point to send back the Australia all-rounder, who had looked dangerous.\n\nThough there will be concern for pacer Matheesha Pathirana, who walked off with an injury, Sri Lanka will fancy their chances of putting on a good show in the Super 8s and making it to the semi-finals, with both Nissanka and Mendis in good form.\n\nAustralia captain Mitchell Marsh: \"I thought it was a competitive total at the halfway mark but with the start we had, maybe a few short. Well played to Sri Lanka.\n\n\"We know that at our best we can make big scores but we lost our way a little bit at the end and Sri Lanka bowled well. Not much more to say other than Sri Lanka outplayed us.\n\n\"It's a devastated group. We are in the lap of gods now. We haven't been at our best. We will watch the Zimbabwe vs Ireland game and hope.\"\n\nSri Lanka captain Dasun Shanaka: \"One of the best performances in the recent times. Really happy with how the proceedings went.\n\n\"We were still very positive after losing [Pathirana] in the powerplay. We had the confidence and knew about the wicket. Each and every one showed a good body language today. And everyone wanted to contribute somehow.\n\n\"We hope to continue like this in the tournament. It's wonderful to qualify after many years. It's a good team. We should go to the next round and hopefully make to the semis. Thanks to the massive crowd today.\"\n\nNissanka's century leads Sri Lanka to victory and puts Australia on brink - as it happened\n\nWho needs what to reach T20 World Cup Super 8s?\n\nMen's T20 World Cup tables, top run-scorers & wicket-takers",

We don't want it to be that close and feel those nerves.\n\n\"But, going forward, it's more experience and we can never have enough of that.\"\n\nEngland progress at World Cup despite Italy scare\n\n'England have no chance at T20 World Cup if they do not improve'\n\nJofra Archer took two wickets in the first over of Italy's chase but Ben Menenti smashed 60 from 25 balls and Grant Stewart 45 from 22 to give Italy real hope.\n\nWith Stewart at the crease, the tournament's lowest-ranked side needed 30 runs from the final two overs for an almighty upset.\n\nThat England came through is obviously a positive. Sam Curran, who also defended 10 from the last over against Nepal, dismissed Stewart in the penultimate over.\n\nHe admitted there have been nerves throughout the initial group stage.\n\n\"It's actually just a tricky stage in a World Cup,\" Curran told the BBC.\n\n\"You're nervous, you've got all kinds of nerves and expectation.\n\n\"I had a little chat with Morgs [former England captain Eoin Morgan] before the toss and said these are the hardest games because we want to get there so badly.\n\n\"Now we've done it it's [about] enjoying it. This is our first aim and now we focus on the teams that we know will be in our group.\"\n\nEngland will play their entire Super 8s phase in Sri Lanka, where they recently beat the co-hosts 3-0 in a T20 series.\n\nTheir opponents are yet to be confirmed. If it goes to seeding then it will be Sri Lanka, Pakistan and New Zealand with the top two progressing to the semi-finals.\n\nJacks said he remains as confident in England as when the group left Sri Lanka at the start of the month.\n\n\"Going back to Sri Lanka, we feel confident there,\" he said. \"That experience is good for us.\n\n\"We've obviously done it the hard way, we've not made it easy.

    "fullText": "It has been a miserable season for Marc-Andre ter Stegen, who has made only three appearances for Barcelona and Girona. The 33-year-old missed almost the entire first half of the season as he was recovery from back surgery, and after moving to Montilivi, he featured twice before tearing his hamstring.\n\nThere is little chance of ter Stegen returning to action before April, which means he would have a matter of weeks to get himself up to speed ahead of this summer’s World Cup. He has hopes of being Germany’s starter at a major tournament for the very first time, although his injury woes have left these in tatters.\n\nRecent comments by Germany head coach Julian Nagelsmann have appeared to back this up. As per Sempre Barca, he has admitted that ter Stegen’s current situation makes it difficult for him to be called up for the World Cup.\n\n“There are three things to consider regarding the goalkeeper position. It’s a tragic injury (for ter Stegen), which I deeply regret. I will never rule him out completely because it is his turn. We have to make the right decision for him and for us. And at the moment, the situation is not favourable.”\n\nGiven that he is 33 years of age, ter Stegen will not have too many years left in football – especially consider his recent injury woes. This summer’s World Cup would have been the perfect time for him to be a starter for Germany at a major tournament, and at this stage, it appears that it will pass him by.\n\nGermany have a number of talented younger goalkeepers rising through the ranks, such as Bayern Munich’s Jonas Urbig and Freiburg’s Noah Atubolu. Both will fancy their chances of ousting ter Stegen in the coming years, and especially before the 2030 World Cup in Spain, Portugal and Morocco.",

    "fullText": "Multiple game creators describe ineffective moderation on the platform, resulting in unchecked hatred in forums and targeted campaigns of negative ‘anti-woke’ reviews\n\nFor years, the gaming storefront Steam has let abuse and bigotry pass through its moderation, according to players and developers who use it. The platform is now host to reams of content that violate its own guidelines.\n\nAccording to developers who spoke with the Guardian, abuse – particularly directed towards transgender creators – is a fact of life on the platform. “Everyone is at one another’s throats all the time in reviews, discussions, forums, anywhere you can possibly find it on Steam,” says content creator and Steam curator Bri “BlondePizza” Moore. “It ensures no one is safe on the platform; developers and consumers alike.”\n\nAside from the content of Steam’s forums, sources pointed to two main causes for concern: bigoted reviews posted on games’ Steam pages, which can hugely affect sales for their developers; and Steam curators (self-appointed taste-makers on the platform) directing campaigns against games they perceive to lean left or pursue inclusion.\n\n“I’m not new to online harassment,” says designer Nathalie Lawhead, who spent two years trying to get reviews removed from their games’ pages. Both reference allegations of sexual assault that Lawhead made in 2019. “I assumed reporting Steam abuse might have its own issues. But when people suggested that I open a ticket, I did have hope that this would be the way to get it resolved.”\n\nOne of the reviews, published in 2023, read, “cringe game, made by a liar”. The other, a review of Lawhead’s game Blue Suburbia posted in 2024, said: “A women [sic] who seeks to destroy other’s [sic] career made this. It’s very poorly put together. She also probably has dual Israeli citizenship with how pointy her nose is.”\n\nDespite Steam’s code of online conduct and community guidelines prohibiting “abusive language or insults”, public accusations or “discrimination”, moderators initially cleared both reviews after Lawhead reported them.\n\nSteam does not allow cleared content to be reported again by the same user unless it has been edited. So Lawhead asked others on social media to report the reviews, which prompted Steam to remove the antisemitic example. The other, however, was passed again. “We aren’t in a position to verify the accuracy of statements made in user reviews,” reads a response from Steam sent on 9 January 2026, “and we don’t try to moderate reviews based on accuracy.” Removing reviews, the response claimed, could be seen as “censorship”.\n\n“Crushing,” is how Lawhead describes Steam’s missive. “The implication seems to be that I must prove my sexual assault [to Steam] if I want to be protected from harassment over it,” they say. “I am hard-pressed to see where the misunderstanding might be. They had all the information regarding the situation. It’s an obvious stance. It’s a choice.”\n\nThe remaining review was finally removed, but only after Lawhead personally approached an employee of Steam’s developer, Valve, outside the moderation ecosystem. “This was too much work just for two obviously unjustifiable reviews,” they say, describing having to resolve the issue outside the usual channels as awkward for both parties. “I think this entire process of moderation is broken.”\n\nWhile Lawhead was able to call on public support to help get reviews removed, that is not an option for every developer: not everyone has enough of a following. Others who have gone public with Steam moderation issues have received further harassment, and have asked to speak anonymously or be identified by their first names only.\n\nSome games have been targeted by Steam curators. Ethan, the developer of Coven, a first-person action-horror set in the 1600s, says he has been targeted by “CharlieTweetsDetected”, a curator devoted to recommending games based solely on whether their developers are perceived to have correctly mourned the assassination of rightwing activist Charlie Kirk.\n\nCharlieTweetsDetected’s review of Coven, a first-person action-horror game set in the 1600s, read simply “Celebrated Sept 10th on blue sky [sic]”. This encouraged others to post further reviews and comments related to Kirk (and not the game). “I even mentioned it to Steam support,” Ethan says, “how it stemmed from that curator list, but they weren’t interested.” Instead, Steam support claimed that “off-topic” constituted “a recipe for cookies, or something completely unrelated to video games that is clearly trolling.” Reviews referencing Kirk, including one reading simply “RIP Charlie Kirk” alongside a negative rating, did not fit that criteria according to Steam; all remain in place today.\n\nElsewhere, campaigns chase games that include trans or LGBTQ+ characters. A trans developer included on a curation list titled “NO WOKE” cites frequent discussion threads, including one that referred to them as a “transvestite” and asked whether their game included “woke faggotry.” Plane Toast’s Émi Lefèvre points to reviews and discussions of Caravan SandWitch, a sci-fi action-adventure and driving game, which frequently approach its queer characters negatively. “Too LBGTQ [sic] … There is no future or continuation for these sad gays and lesbians,” reads one among many that remain visible on the game’s store page.\n\n“For sure, the ‘anti-woke’ curators brought insincere negative attention to the game,” Lefèvre says. “Valve’s refusal to moderate any of this is making Steam reviews and forums the battleground for some kind of culture war, and is making them unsafe for marginalised people and regular gamers trying to simply enjoy the game they bought.”\n\nThanks to this influx of bad actors, and the lengths that developers need to go to in the hopes of getting hateful content removed from their pages, often without success, many report feeling held hostage by the platform. Steam has become essential for developers. It brings in millions of daily users – last month it had almost 42 million concurrent players – and billions of dollars. “No other storefront has the clout that Steam does,” Lawhead says. “Publishers don’t take you seriously if you’re not on it.”\n\nThat level of success results in hundreds of thousands of support tickets every week. Details about how Valve, a company that has been reported to employ fewer than 400 people, handles its moderation load are elusive. Online consensus, including among those formerly involved in Steam’s volunteer moderation programme (retired in 2022), is that the process must be outsourced. The Guardian reached out to Valve on multiple occasions, through multiple channels, \n\nDeveloper Phi endured an identical process to Ethan and Lawhead upon releasing Heart of Enya in 2021. After escalating a support ticket over transphobic reviews, Phi received the following response from a Steam agent: “It’s much better to continue working on the product, while letting the community use the helpfulness feature to surface reviews that they agree with or find to be uninformed.” (This exact wording was in Steam support’s response to Lawhead five years later.) “Most of our moderating decisions come down to a yes/no criteria … that’s a frustrating line to walk, and I think it inevitably leaves content that would be considered offensive.”\n\nThe agent suggested the issue would be discussed with their team, but after five years little appears to have changed.\n\n“To us, it seemed that in Steam’s [view], hateful comments about an individual is abuse – but targeting it towards a group of people is totally fine, that’s welcome speech,” Phi says. “We had no other choice for what to do about transphobia in our reviews. They’re still up there today.”\n\nRecourse for developers is limited. Some are looking into their own security, shoring up protections for developers on their team against being doxxed or hacked by trolls. Or, in the case of the developers of Caves of Qud, paying their own moderators to handle forums and the hate that spills out of Steam. Others push bigoted comments into public view in an attempt to cajole Valve, such as No More Robots head Mike Rose, who pushed back against racist reviews of its game Little Rocket Lab last year. “Woke game. Also has muslims,” reads one negative review; “please never, ever play any of our games ever again,” reads Rose’s response.\n\nOthers are just trying to roll with it. “Brown space lesbians trying and failing to contain a simple fungal outbreak” is, despite its original derogatory intent, “the hardest line in all of our marketing copy”, according to Ambrosia Sky developer Christina Pollock.\n\nIt is increasingly easy, however, for the average consumer to log on to Steam and encounter abuse, bigotry and hate, much of which has been cleared by moderators. And because reviews affect a game’s visibility on Steam, a single negative rating can mean the difference between success and failure. Lax moderation doesn’t just create individual harm but has profound professional and economic implications for developers across the platform.\n\nMany of them say they feel forced simply to endure it – unable to walk away from Steam’s near-monopoly on PC gaming. “If I am to continue existing on Steam, I am under the impression that I will have to go through this exhausting ordeal every time I want to report abuse,” Lawhead concludes. “This shouldn’t be normal.”",

    "fullText": "The biggest software companies might be reduced to mere data sources, says Snowflake's CEO.\n\n\"The big model makers want to create a world in which all of the data for all of the enterprises is easily available to them,\" Sridhar Ramaswamy said on an episode of Alex Kantrowitz's \"Big Technology Podcast\" published last week. \"Everything else, the world, is just a dumb data pipe that feeds into that big brain.\"\n\nPrior to becoming Snowflake's CEO in 2024, Ramaswamy was a partner at Greylock Ventures and cofounded AI search startup Neeva, which was acquired by Snowflake.\n\nRamaswamy added that Snowflake needs to operate with a \"fear\" that people would stop using AI agents developed by software companies and instead want an all-inclusive agent that has data from Snowflake, for example, and everywhere else\n\nHe said his solution was to let customers take the lead and decide how they want to access their data — directly through their own agents, or through a product like ChatGPT.\n\nIn the last few months, AI labs have evolved from being sources of AI infrastructure to becoming software providers themselves. OpenAI has entered the sales, support, and document analysis market, threatening incumbents such as Salesforce and Oracle.\n\nOn a podcast released last week, Andreessen Horowitz general partner Anish Acharya said software firms were being unnecessarily punished by Wall Street over fears that AI could take over their industry. The VC said that legacy software could not be replaced so easily, because it would not be worth it to use AI for every business function.\n\nHe said that software accounts for 8% to 12% of a company's expenses, so vibe coding to build the company's resource planning or payroll tools would only save about 10%. Instead, companies should focus on big-ticket items, like developing their core businesses or optimizing other costs.\n\nRamaswamy and Acharya's comments follow a brutal start of the month for software stocks, which dragged down tech and broader markets. The sell-off started when already-wary investors panicked about Anthropic's new AI tool, which can perform a range of clerical tasks for people working in the legal industry.",

    "description": "After weeks of debate about whether Pakistan's fixture against India would go ahead at the T20 World Cup, the action failed to deliver and it left the rivalry feeling more political than sporting.",
    "fullText": "Colombo awoke to its greyest sky of the week come Sunday morning. A portent, perhaps, of the weather forecast which briefly caused a scare prior to India's dominant win over Pakistan later that evening.\n\nIt certainly mirrored the cloud lurking over the build-up to cricket's most-charged derby. Pakistan relented on their original decision to boycott the fixture in solidarity with Bangladesh, who had to forfeit their place in this T20 World Cup when refused dispensation to play their games outside of India.\n\nArguably more interest stemmed from the pageantry of Sunday's game than from the actual cricket. Plenty were on handshake-watch given recent history between these two. Polite formalities did not return at the toss, Suryakumar Yadav and Salman Ali Agha giving each other the silent treatment.\n\nTo be ready for the myriad cameras capturing the flip of the coin, both captains have to be in place a good two minutes before getting on with the ceremony. When mired in such awkwardness, it seems an eternity.\n\nEnough time for a detail-oriented TV producer to spot that Salman, Pakistan's skipper, sported a kink in his collar. The scruffy schoolboy-look was rectified by an anonymous figure inadvertently stealing the situation's authority. It certainly detracted from the attempted strong-man image projected by stubborn leaders.\n\nAs did the behaviour of the ex-pros off the pitch. On the ICC broadcast, Rohit Sharma and Wasim Akram warmly greeted before walking the tournament trophy onto the field. Away from the cameras, Harbhajan Singh, Misbah Ul-Haq and Ramiz Raja were spotted in cordial conversation in the media area.\n\nThe stadium certainly felt different to earlier World Cup matches at this venue. A perimeter was set multiple blocks from the ground. Bags were inspected long before the entrance. And again upon arrival. The Sri Lankan special task force, previously unseen at this tournament, was out in force, automatic weapons on full display.\n\nEven the price of a fake jersey among street vendors shot up amid India-Pakistan inflation. Local entrepreneurs were delighted the fixture went ahead. As were the swarming hotels. Such was the influx in India's accommodation that Mohammed Siraj could not squeeze into the lift on his morning commute.\n\nThe backdrop reflected the magnitude of the occasion, but not necessarily any tension. That didn't come until the toss. Albeit there were some murmurs of discontent at the choice of pre-match music. Indian rapper Hanumankind performed with his dance troupe and pyrotechnics aplenty.\n\nHe appeared on the soundtrack to Dhurandhar, a movie released last year, the political undertones of which were not well received in Pakistan where the film is banned. Shortly after Sunday's performance concluded, the call to prayer could be heard from a local mosque. The cricketing gods have a sense of humour.\n\nBoth camps were reluctant to really delve into the off-field narratives. \"In these games the emotions are always going to be high but we need to deal with that,\" said Salman.\n\n\"We have played enough cricket and games like this. You have to see the bigger picture and win our next game to qualify for the Super 8s.\"\n\nKishan goes crazy as India hammer Pakistan\n\nOnce the cricket finally started, Ishan Kishan's belligerent hitting delighted the Indian-heavy crowd - which, it should be said, was not at capacity. Usman Tariq's curious action, his pause akin to Jorginho's jump when taking a penalty, dominated pre-match chat. He failed to remain the protagonist of the contest itself, albeit he did cheekily bow towards Suryakumar upon dismissing the man who was filmed mimicking his ways during Indian net sessions.\n\nAt the mid-innings break, some dared to think we could have a chase on our hands with Pakistan needing 176. India's dominant powerplay, taking four wickets and conceding just 39 runs, put a swift end to such notions.\n\nThe scoreline in this match-up at T20 World Cups now reads 8-1 in favour of India. This rivalry has become political, rather than a sporting one. As tedious as the interference is, it offers more to discuss than one side consistently outclassing the other.\n\nAs if aware of this, in a lull during Pakistan's inevitable defeat, the ICC replayed the cordial exchange between Wasim and Rohit prior to the match. Aren't we all getting along just fine? Just not to the extent that players shook hands once India wrapped up their shellacking. That sign of respect continues to feel some way off.\n\n\"We see them as a team - we are not thinking about this as a rivalry or whatever,\" said India's Axar Patel.\n\n\"We are playing against one team and we are focusing on cricket. Whenever I'm playing, I'm not thinking about whatever, I treat it as one match and opponent.\"\n\nAfter the final wicket, Hardik Pandya and Shivam Dube did not feel they had hit their desired workloads. The former bowled three overs in the match, the latter was not required. Out came bowling coach Morne Morkel to catch extra work with his baseball mitt. Opposition resoundingly dealt with yet more reps needed.\n\nAn apt reflection, not that it was required, of this contest's non-existent relationship with the sort of jeopardy required to make us all forget the politics.\n\nWho needs what to reach T20 World Cup Super 8s?\n\nMen's T20 World Cup tables, top run-scorers & wicket-takers\n\nWhy is there talk about a Pakistan spinner's action?",

    "fullText": "STAVANGER, Norway (AP) — Jeffrey Epstein repeatedly played up his ties to the former head of the Nobel Peace Prize committee in invitations to and chats with elites like Richard Branson, Larry Summers, Bill Gates and Steve Bannon, a top ally of President Donald Trump, the Epstein files show.\n\nThorbjørn Jagland, who headed the Norwegian Nobel Committee from 2009 to 2015, turns up hundreds of times in the millions of documents about the former U.S. financier and convicted sex offender that were released by the U.S. Justice Department last month.\n\nSince the release, Jagland, 75, has been charged in Norway for “aggravated corruption” in connection with an investigation prompted by information in the files, the economic crime unit of Norwegian police Økokrim said.\n\nØkokrim has said it would investigate whether gifts, travel and loans were received in connection with Jagland’s position. Its teams searched his Oslo residence on Thursday, plus two other properties in Risør, a coastal town to the south, and in Rauland to the west.\n\nHis attorneys at Elden law firm in Norway said Jagland denies the charges, and was questioned by the police unit on Thursday.\n\nWhile there is no evidence in the documents seen so far of any outright lobbying for the Nobel Peace Prize, Epstein repeatedly played up hosting Jagland at his properties in New York and Paris in the 2010s.\n\nIn September 2018, during Trump’s first term and in an apparent allusion to his interest in the peace prize, Epstein had a varied text-message exchange with Bannon, at one point writing — in one of many messages with untidy grammar: “donalds head would explode if he knew you were now buds with the guy who on monday will decide the nobel peace prize.”\n\n“I told him next year it should be you when we settle china,” he added, without elaborating.\n\nIn one email from 2013, mixing in investment tips and praise for PR tips, Epstein told British entrepreneur and magnate Richard Branson that Jagland would be staying with Epstein in September that year, adding: “if you are there, you might find him interesting.”\n\nA year after she left a job as White House counsel to President Barack Obama, in 2015, Kathy Ruemmler got an email from Epstein saying: \"head of nobel peace prize coming to visit, want to join?\"\n\nIn 2012, Epstein wrote former Treasury Secretary and Harvard University president Larry Summers about Jagland, saying “head of the nobel peace prize staying with me, if you have any interest.”\n\nIn that exchange, Epstein referred to Jagland — also a former Norwegian prime minister and former head of the Council of Europe, a human rights body — as “not bright” but someone who offered a “unique perspective.”\n\nThe financier wrote Bill Gates in 2014, saying that Jagland had been reelected as head of the Council of Europe.\n\n“That is good,” the Microsoft co-founder and formerly the world's richest man, wrote. “I guess his peace prize committee job is also up in the air?”\n\nDuring Jagland's tenure as chair of the committee, it gave the peace prize to Obama, in 2009, and the European Union in 2012.\n\nJagland was brought into Epstein’s orbit by Terje Rød Larsen, a Norwegian diplomat who helped broker the Oslo Peace Accords between Israel and Palestinians.\n\nLarsen and his wife are also facing corruption charges in Norway due to their association with Epstein.\n\nThe AP is reviewing the documents released by the Justice Department in collaboration with journalists from CBS, NBC, MS NOW and CNBC. Journalists from each newsroom are working together to examine the files and share information about what is in them. Each outlet is responsible for its own independent news coverage of the documents.",

    "fullText": "The T20 World Cup heads into the final week of group-stage fixtures with six spots in the Super 8s still up for grabs.\n\nWest Indies were the first team to qualify for the next phase, while India joined them with victory over Pakistan later on Sunday.\n\nHere's what the remaining teams need to progress to the next stage.\n\nThe top two teams in each group - A to D - will progress to the Super 8s, which will be made up of two groups of four.\n\nIf any teams are level on points after the four group-stage fixtures, they will be separated by number of wins and then net run-rate.\n\nThe International Cricket Council has pre-determined the Super 8 groups if the eight seeded sides qualify:\n\nX Group: India (X1), Australia (X2), West Indies (X3), South Africa (X4)\n\nY Group: England (Y1), New Zealand (Y2), Pakistan (Y3), Sri Lanka (Y4)\n\nIf any of those sides do not progress, the teams who do in their place will just fill the spot.\n\nEach team plays three more matches in the Super 8s phase, facing each of the other teams in their group once.\n\nAfter those fixtures, the top two teams from each group will advance to the semi-finals, with the winner of each Super 8s group facing the runner-up from the other.\n\nRemaining games: Pakistan v Namibia (18 Feb, 09:30) and India v Netherlands (18 Feb, 13:30)\n\nDefending champions India sealed their place in the Super 8s with a comfortable 61-run win over rivals Pakistan.\n\nPakistan slipped to third with that defeat, with their net run-rate taking a heavy hit.\n\nHowever, a win in their final game against Namibia on Wednesday would see them progress.\n\nUSA have played all of their games and are currently second but need Pakistan to lose their final game and for the Netherlands to lose or not overtake their net run-rate if they win.\n\nThe Netherlands must beat India, hope Pakistan lose and then it could come down to net run-rate.\n\nRemaining games: Australia v Sri Lanka (16 Feb, 13:30), Ireland v Zimbabwe (17 Feb 09:30 GMT), Sri Lanka v Zimbabwe (19 Feb, 09:30), Australia v Oman (20 Feb, 13:30)\n\nSri Lanka will progress with a win over Australia on Monday. If they lose they would likely need to beat Zimbabwe and then it could come down to net run-rate. Two wins would guarantee progression.\n\nAustralia would be eliminated if they lose to Sri Lanka on Monday and Zimbabwe beat Ireland on Tuesday. They may need to win both their remaining games and rely on net run-rate.\n\nZimbabwe will guarantee progression with two wins. One win potentially may be enough but it would come down to net run-rate.\n\nIreland need to win their last match and hope other results go their way because they can only qualify on net run-rate.\n\nRemaining games: England v Italy (16 Feb, 09:30), Scotland v Nepal (17 Feb, 13:30), West Indies v Italy (19 Feb, 05:30)\n\nWest Indies secured their progression with a nine-wicket win over Nepal on Sunday.\n\nEngland must beat Italy on Monday to progress. A defeat would likely see them eliminated on net run-rate.\n\nScotland need to beat Nepal and hope Italy beat England but do not overtake their net run-rate.\n\nItaly must beat England but could lose to West Indies and then net run-rate would decide who progresses. Two wins would see them through, as would a win against England and a washed-out game against West Indies.\n\nRemaining games: Afghanistan v UAE (16 Feb, 05:30 GMT), New Zealand v Canada (17 Feb, 05:30 GMT), South Africa v UAE (18 Feb, 05:30 GMT), Afghanistan v Canada (19 Feb, 13:30 GMT)\n\nSouth Africa are in a strong position to progress and their spot could be sealed on Monday if UAE lose to Afghanistan. Regardless of that result, a win against UAE on Wednesday would confirm their progression.\n\nNew Zealand likely need to win and hope that UAE do not win both of their games. If both of those things happen then net run-rate would decide who moves through.\n\nUAE likely need to win both of their remaining games and even then are likely to be relying on net run-rate to progress.\n\nAfghanistan need to win both of their matches, including one against UAE, and hope that neither UAE or New Zealand pick up points in their final game.\n\nCanada need to win both their remaining fixtures and will need other results to go their way.\n\nRun-rate is the average number of runs scored per over by a team in their entire innings - so, for example, a score of 140 off 20 overs equals seven runs per over.\n\nNet run-rate is calculated by subtracting the opposition's run-rate from the other team's run-rate.\n\nThe winning side will therefore have a positive net run-rate, and the losers a negative net run-rate.\n\nIn a tournament, net run-rate is worked out by taking the average runs per over scored by that team in each game and subtracting the average runs per over scored against them in each game.\n\nIf a team is bowled out inside their allotted overs, their run-rate is calculated by dividing the runs by the maximum overs they could have batted - 20 overs in the case of this tournament.\n\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "T20 World Cup, Group A, Colombo\n\nIndia 175-7 (20 overs): Kishan 77 (40); Ayub 3-25\n\nPakistan 114 (18 overs): Usman 44 (34); Hardik 2-16, Chakravarthy 2-17, Bumrah 2-17\n\nIndia continued their recent on-field dominance over Pakistan by winning their highly anticipated meeting in Colombo by 61 runs to confirm their place in the Super 8s of the T20 World Cup.\n\nAfter weeks of discussion and doubt over whether the match would even go ahead, India ultimately proved too strong and sealed a ninth successive win in completed matches against their rivals.\n\nAlthough the captains did not shake hands at the toss and there were no exchanges between the players after the final play, the rest of the match passed without any flashpoints amid the ongoing political tensions between the two nations and last year's military conflict.\n\nThe encounter was effectively won by a brutal early assault by India opener Ishan Kishan, who struck 77 from 40 balls on a tricky, turning pitch.\n\nIt gave co-hosts a flying start and meant, even with Pakistan's plethora of spinners slowing the scoring and taking wickets, they still posted 175-7.\n\nThat always felt a challenging total and Hardik Pandya took a wicket in the first over of the chase and Jasprit Bumrah two in the second to all but confirm the result.\n\nUsman Khan struck some blows in making 44 but Pakistan were swept aside - all out for 114 in 18 overs.\n\nWhile India are now certain to progress as they attempt to retain the title won in 2024, Pakistan must beat Namibia on Wednesday to guarantee their place in the Super 8s.\n\nShould they do so, the rivals could yet meet again in this competition in a semi-final or final.\n\nWho needs what to reach T20 World Cup Super 8s?\n\nMen's T20 World Cup tables, top run-scorers & wicket-takers\n\nIndia-Pakistan to go ahead as government ends boycott request\n\nFor a while it looked like this match would not happen.\n\nPakistan, whose last win against India was at the Asia Cup in 2022, announced a boycott a week before the tournament began, only to reverse their decision at the start of this week after extensive talks.\n\nIt went ahead, in front of a large crowd weighted towards Indian blue, because it is the most lucrative fixture in the world game, providing the funds upon which cricket's ecosystem survives in its current imperfect state.\n\nHow long that remains the case given India's dominance, built from their cricketing and financial might, remains to be seen.\n\nKishan's assault gave India breathing space and their bowlers were ruthless, even if their fielders dropped three catches.\n\nAfter Pakistan's seamers went the distance, Hardik began with a wicket maiden - dismissing right-hander Sahibzada Farhan, who skewed a pull shot high to mid-on.\n\nIn the next over, the majestic Bumrah pinned left-hander Saim Ayub in front with full inswinger, before Pakistan Salman Agha holed out playing a wild slog.\n\nEven Pakistan's biggest name, Babar Azam, was tamely bowled for five attempting a swipe to left-arm spinner Axar Patel in the fifth over, while left-handers Mohammed Nawaz and Faheem Ashraf meekly picked out fielders in the deep.\n\nAfter all of the build-up this was another underwhelming meeting.\n\nKishan's innings was an outlier across the match. He scored at a strike-rate of 192.50 per 100 balls. Only one other batter to face more than five deliveries, Shivam Dube - who made 27 from 17 balls - went at more than 130.\n\nOf the first 88 runs in the match, 77 came off the bat of Kishan as he made his second 50 in a row at this World Cup.\n\nHe was fortunate to chip three swings into gaps but otherwise hit cleanly in all directions until he was bowled by Ayub in the ninth over.\n\nSwitching through six different spinners, Pakistan's fightback came too late with mystery spinner Usman Tariq held back too long.\n\nAyub had Tilak Verma lbw for a stodgy 25 from 24 balls before Hardik hit his next ball to long-off. Had Ayub's hat-trick ball not narrowly missed Dube's edge and stumps after turning sharply, Pakistan may have had a better chance.\n\nTheir decision to bowl first also seemed a misstep, with the ball skidding through later on.\n\nDube was left to push India beyond 150 which was probably a par total in the conditions.\n\nIn truth, little went right for Pakistan.",

Former long-time bantamweight Muay Thai king Nong-O Hama takes on undefeated Russian standout Asadula Imangazaliev for the vacant ONE Flyweight Muay Thai World Title inside Bangkok’s iconic Lumpinee Stadium.\n\nThe explosive showdown takes place on March 20, live in Asia primetime, pitting a living legend and a young superstar against each other.\n\nNong-O spent years establishing himself as one of the most dominant World Champions in ONE Championship history.\n\nAfter winning the inaugural ONE Bantamweight Muay Thai World Title in 2019, he defended it a record seven times against top-flight opposition, blending sharp counters, clean combinations, and devastating finishing power.\n\nHis reign came to an end in a first-round knockout loss to Jonathan “The General” Haggerty in April 2023, and although he picked up another win at bantamweight a year later, the 39-year-old began reassessing his long-term path as the division grew bigger and more physical.\n\nThat’s when he decided to move to flyweight, which presented a fresh opportunity.\n\nAt 135 pounds, Nong-O could lean more heavily on his speed, balance, and timing. His debut in the division came at ONE Fight Night 28 against Kongthoranee Sor Sommai in a closely contested bout. Despite that fight ending in a split decision loss, his performance showed he could immediately compete with the division’s elite.\n\nThree months later at ONE Fight Night 31, the Evolve MMA representative returned with clear adjustments and defeated Kongthoranee by unanimous decision, controlling the tempo and displaying sharper movement across three fast-paced rounds in their rematch.\n\nThat victory carried significance. It confirmed Nong-O was not simply testing himself in a new weight class. He had recalibrated, and he had earned his place among the top contenders.\n\nThe Thai icon was initially scheduled to challenge for the flyweight Muay Thai crown at ONE 173 in November last year. However, after his opponent was not medically cleared to compete following the weigh-in and hydration test, the bout was shelved.\n\nNow, Nong-O finds himself standing opposite a young contender on a seemingly flawless trajectory.\n\nImangazaliev’s path has been fueled by momentum. After making waves with five wins – including four knockouts – on ONE Championship’s weekly Asia primetime spectacle, he secured a main roster contract at ONE Friday Fights 122 with a first-round head-kick knockout of seven-time Muay Thai World Champion “The Angel Warrior” Panpayak Jitmuangnon.\n\nThe finish instantly elevated the Team Mehdi Zatout product into serious contention.\n\nHe reinforced that status by stopping Kongthoranee in the second round at ONE Fight Night 39 this past January, extending his pristine record to 11-0, earning a US$50,000 performance bonus, and strengthening his claim for a World Title opportunity.\n\nWhile Nong-O brings World Championship composure and years of elite experience, Imangazaliev arrives in this matchup with explosiveness, confidence, and an unblemished record.\n\nWith the flyweight Muay Thai belt vacant, ONE Friday Fights 147 will determine who gets to claim the division’s throne. Inside the hallowed ground of Lumpinee Stadium, a new king will be crowned.",

    "fullText": "MILAN (AP) — Few figure skaters at the Winter Olympics have seen Adeliia Petrosian compete in real life.\n\nShe might leave with the gold medal.\n\nRussia's exclusion from international sports events during its war with Ukraine means that the 18-year-old Petrosian has only skated one senior competition outside of her homeland, the qualifier that earned her place as a neutral athlete in Milan.\n\nAs she readies to skate to Michael Jackson's music in the short program Tuesday, no one besides Petrosian and her controversial coach, Eteri Tutberidze, can be sure of her form, or whether she's injury-free.\n\nBut if Petrosian can get past skaters like the U.S. “Blade Angels” trio of Amber Glenn, Alysa Liu and Isabeau Levito, and Japanese stars Kaori Sakamoto and Ami Nakai, she'll shoot to sudden fame as the fourth consecutive Olympic champion from Russia.\n\nPetrosian is the latest star produced by Tutberidze, who revolutionized women's skating a decade ago by getting young girls barely in their teens to perform bigger and bigger jumps, only to have many of them struggle with repeated injuries.\n\nShe coached 2018 gold medalist Alina Zagitova, and a trio of standouts in 2022, when Anna Shcherbakova won the gold medal.\n\nBut the Beijing Games have been remembered less for Shcherbakova's triumph and more for the positive doping test turned in by another Tutberidze talent, 15-year-old Kamila Valieva. The case ended ultimately in a doping ban for Valieva that only recently ended, and an investigation into Tutberidze, though it found no evidence of wrongdoing by the Russian coach.\n\nTutberidze also was criticized for her harsh words toward her students in Beijing, while World Anti-Doping Agency president Witold Bańka said last week that he didn't “feel comfortable with her presence” at the Milan Cortina Olympics.\n\nAs part of the fallout from the Valieva case, the International Skating Union increased the minimum age from 15 to 17 for senior-level athletes. That means Petrosian is one of the oldest women's skaters that Tutberidze has coached at a major championship.\n\nPetrosian has landed quadruple jumps in Russian national events, much like her compatriots were able to do in previous Olympics, and none of the other skaters at the Milan Cortina Games are able to match those high-scoring elements.\n\nThe big question is whether she's fit enough to do it in Milan.\n\n“I can't turn properly,” Petrosian complained in a Russian documentary following Tutberidze released last week. Tutberidze said Petrosian had been making progress in a difficult program around the new year, but suddenly “everything hurt.”\n\nThere's been no indication of how Petrosian's condition may have changed in the last month as she readied for the Olympics.\n\nFitness has been a factor for months. Tutberidze previously told Russian media that Petrosian wanted to give up her place in September's Olympic qualifier for lower-ranked skaters after an injury but ended up competing because the Russian alternate's fitness was worse.\n\n“Let's imagine it's just Chelyabinsk.” That was the advice Russian skater Petr Gumennik got from his coach ahead of skating in the men’s event, to pretend that the Olympics were happening in that provincial Russian city.\n\nFor a few seconds, it felt as if the competition might indeed be happening in Russia.\n\n“When I went out there I got so much applause, there was such noise, you can't compare it to anything,” Gumennik said after skating in the short program, where he was 12th. “That's Olympic support. It was unexpected and it gave me strength and confidence.”\n\nGumennik was greeted by fans waving personalized banners with his face, calling out “well done” in Russian.\n\nThere also was a Russian flag in the stands, even though Olympic organizers have barred it from the Games, where athletes such as Gumennik and Petrosian were vetted for any support of the war before they were allowed to compete as neutral athletes.\n\nAs the Russian with the best chance of a gold medal at these Olympics, there may be even more support when Petrosian skates. ___\n\nAP Winter Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics",

    "title": "Too old or too good to ignore: The Mohammed Shami conundrum",
    "description": "Mohammed Shami's consistent domestic form and World Cup pedigree raise questions about his continued omission from the Indian team. Despite his impressive wicket-taking record, selectors appear hesitant, possibly due to age and injury concerns, while his coach insists performance and fire are paramount. His return remains a strong possibility.",
    "fullText": "These questions swirl every time Shami’s name is omitted from the Indian team. Everyone knows about him: the rasping seam, the wobble that refuses to settle and the habit of arriving at big tournaments and leaving with bigger hauls. Yet, for all that familiarity, his absence from the Indian team has now become a recurring theme.\n\nIndia are understandably wary of pinning their World Cup hopes on two high-class but injury-prone fast bowlers in their thirties: Shami and Jasprit Bumrah. With the domestic pace cupboard thin, the instinct is to invest early in younger bodies. What is harder to justify is ignoring pedigree. \n\nShami is India’s highest wicket-taker in ODI World Cups: 55 wickets at an average of 13.5 in 18 games. The recent numbers only strengthen his case. In four Ranji Trophy matches for Bengal, Shami bowled an average of 20 overs an innings and claimed 20 scalps at 18.6. In the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, he picked up 16 wickets in seven games. In the Vijay Hazare Trophy, he prised out 11 at 22.5 in five games. \n\nShami played a crucial role in India’s 2025 Champions Trophy, claiming 9 scalps from 5 games. Yet, he was omitted from 2025-26 central contracts.\n\nBadruddin Siddiqui, Shami’s long-time coach, does not mask his frustration. “There’s fire in him,” he says. “He is serious about playing for India. I always tell him --- perform karte raho: India will need you,” he says. For Siddiqui, the equation is simple. A cricketer’s job is to perform; the selectors’ job is to decide. “Age should never be a consideration. Fitness, performance and fire: that’s what matters.” \n\nDomestic cricket, Siddiqui argues, is too easily dismissed. “Bowling 25 overs in a day is not easy,” he says. “There is no bowler who can replace him. There is a lot left in him.” \n\nFormer Delhi pacer Sanjeev Sharma offers a more nuanced perspective. “There’s a lot of difference between domestic and international cricket,” he says. “Even a T20 international takes a lot out of you: in terms of fielding, bending and chasing. There is no place to hide in international cricket.” \n\n“Perhaps, Shami is not yet at the exact match-fitness level the selectors want him to be,” Sharma notes. \n\nPerhaps, communication has faltered, he says. But Sharma is unequivocal about Shami’s ability. \n\n“Skill-wise, he is your second-best fast bowler after Bumrah. There’s no doubt in my mind that Shami will return.” Around Shami, competition has intensified—Arshdeep Singh’s left-arm angles, Siraj’s stamina, Harshit Rana’s development. But competition does not erase class. “Performs speaks for itself,” Siddiqui says. “Bilkul wapas aayega: he will be back,” he adds.",

    "description": "From Costco to Toyota, global companies are filing lawsuits to secure tariff refunds should the Supreme Court decide to strike down Trump's duties.",
    "fullText": "Top global companies want their money back from the Trump administration.\n\nThe Supreme Court is in the process of deciding whether Trump's tariffs enacted under an emergency law, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, are legal. To companies that may have already paid billions in duties over the past year, a ruling against tariffs may not be enough to recoup funds.\n\nSmall businesses mainly spearheaded the initial wave of lawsuits against tariffs, but some of the largest global corporations are now filing lawsuits in fear that they may not be refunded should the Supreme Court overturn the duties.\n\nTypically, duties paid to the Customs and Border Protection undergo a process called liquidation within a year of the entry of the goods in question. Once liquidation occurs, the chances of getting any money back become slim — and for many companies, their time is running out.\n\nFrom Costco to Toyota, here are some of the largest global companies that want their tariffs refunded.\n\nCostco is seeking a \"full refund\" of tariffs it paid under the IEEPA, arguing the levies were imposed illegally and could soon become unrecoverable.\n\nIn a lawsuit filed with the Court of International Trade in December 2025, Costco's lawyers argued that the law, first enacted in 1977, has never authorized tariffs.\n\n\"The text of IEEPA does not use the word 'tariff' or any term of equivalent meaning,\" the company wrote.\n\nThe company also said in the complaint that it filed its own suit because even if the Supreme Court ultimately rules the tariffs unlawful, importers are not guaranteed refunds without separate court judgments. Costco said that its imports could begin entering \"liquidation\" as early as mid-December, which is a customs process that could permanently close the door on refunds. Customs has already declined to extend that timeline, Costco said in the suit.\n\nCostco did not disclose how much it has paid in duties.\n\nSubsidiaries of the Toyota Group, Toyota Tsusho America, Toyota Tsusho Canada, and Toyota Tsusho Nexty Electronics America filed a lawsuit in November 2025 to secure refunds.\n\n\"And this action is necessary now because the entries for which Plaintiffs paid tariffs imposed under authority of IEEPA will begin to become liquidated and final as a matter of law by January 31, 2026,\" the companies wrote in the complaint.\n\n\"Plaintiffs seek relief from the impending final liquidations to ensure that their right to a complete refund is not jeopardized,\" they added.\n\nThe auto sector has been among the industries most exposed to Trump's tariffs, which added duties on vehicles as well as on steel and aluminum. In May 2025, Toyota said that the higher import and export rates could cost the company about $1.3 billion over a two-month period.\n\nBYD's lawsuit marks the first from a Chinese carmaker against Trump's tariffs.\n\nThe EV giant filed the suit on February 9 and detailed nine executive orders related to trade that affected the company, including tariffs on cars, auto parts, aluminum, steel, and exports from China.\n\nIn the complaint, BYD wrote that it is seeking a refund of \"all IEEPA tariffs paid to date\" and \"all IEEPA tariffs that may be paid in the future.\"\n\nThe company also said that aside from China, its imports into the US from Canada, Germany, Mexico, and Poland were also affected.\n\nThe Chinese carmaker does not sell passenger cars in the US, but its business here includes buses, commercial vehicles, batteries, energy storage systems, and solar panels. According to its website, the company's truck plant in Lancaster, California, employs 750 workers.\n\nOn December 10, 2025, Goodyear Tire & Rubber filed its complaint and request for relief, and detailed how tariffs, especially the ones imposed on China, which changed nearly a dozen times, affected the company.\n\n\"Where CBP acts in a ministerial capacity (i.e., without discretion) in imposing a duty, the entry's liquidation cannot be protested,\" wrote Goodyear in its complaint as to why the company is asking the court to block liquidation.\n\nGoodyear sources a significant portion of its raw materials from Southeast Asia, where the rubber plant is widely commercially grown. According to Goodyear's website, the company's manufacturing facilities are located across 23 countries, including China, the US, Germany, Poland, and Thailand.\n\nAlcoa Corp, one of the world's top producers of aluminum, bauxite, and alumina, filed a complaint for tariff refunds on November 26, 2025.\n\nThis case is one of several dozen that were consolidated with AGS Company Automotive Solutions v. United States Customs and Border Protection, which became the lead case regarding IEEPA duty liquidation as of December 2025.\n\nAs of June 2025, tariffs on most steel and aluminum imports increased to 50%.",
