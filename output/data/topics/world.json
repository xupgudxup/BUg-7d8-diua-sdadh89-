    "fullText": "Trailblazing former world number three Milos Raonic announced his retirement from tennis on Monday, ending a career that earned him eight ATP titles.\n\nThe big-serving 35-year-old, the first Canadian man to reach a Grand Slam singles final, has not competed in over a year.\n\nHe has long been plagued by injuries and said on social media it was time to call it quits.\n\n\"This is a moment you know will come one day, but somehow you never feel ready for it,\" he said.\n\n\"This is as ready as I will ever be. I have been the luckiest person to get to live out and fulfil my dreams.\"\n\nRaonic's best season was in 2016, when he reached the Wimbledon final after defeating Roger Federer in the semis, losing to Andy Murray in the decider.\n\nHe also advanced to the Australian Open semi-finals and the ATP Finals the same year, finishing the season as world number three.\n\nHe last competed at the 2024 Olympics in Paris.",

The month-long mission of the test vessel Chikyu near Minamitori ​Island some 1,900 km (1,200 miles) southeast of Tokyo, will mark the world's first attempt to continuously lift rare-earth seabed sludge from 6 km (4 miles) deep onto a ‌ship.",
    "fullText": "SHIZUOKA, Japan, Jan 12 (Reuters) - A Japanese mining ship departed on Monday for a remote coral atoll to probe mud rich in rare earths, part of Tokyo's drive to curb its reliance on China for critical minerals as Beijing tightens supply.\n\nThe month-long mission of the test vessel Chikyu near Minamitori ​Island some 1,900 km (1,200 miles) southeast of Tokyo, will mark the world's first attempt to continuously lift rare-earth seabed sludge from 6 km (4 miles) deep onto a ‌ship.\n\nJapan, like its Western allies, has been reducing its dependence on China for the minerals vital to the production of cars, smartphones and military equipment, an effort that has taken on urgency amid a major diplomatic dispute with ‌Beijing.\n\n\"One of our missions is to build a supply chain for domestically produced rare earths to ensure a stable supply of minerals essential to industry,\" Shoichi Ishii, the head of the government-backed project told reporters last month, ahead of the vessel's departure from the port city of Shizuoka on a bright sunny day, with a snow-capped Mount Fuji in the background.\n\nREDUCING RELIANCE ON CHINA WON'T BE EASY\n\nChina last week banned exports of items destined for Japan's military that have civilian and military uses, including some critical minerals. The Wall Street Journal reported Beijing has also begun restricting rare-earth exports ⁠to Japan more broadly.\n\nJapan has condemned China's dual-use ban but declined ‌to comment on the report of a broader ban, which China has not confirmed or denied. Chinese state media, though, have said Beijing was weighing the measure.\n\nFinance ministers from the Group of Seven industrial powers will discuss rare-earth supplies at a meeting in Washington on Monday, sources familiar ‍with the matter told Reuters.\n\nJapan is no stranger to facing China's wrath over rare earths. In 2010, China held back exports following an incident near disputed islands in the East China Sea.\n\nSince then, Japan has reduced its reliance on China to 60% from 90% by investing in overseas projects like trading house Sojitz's tie-up with Australia's Lynas Rare Earths, and promoting rare-earths recycling and manufacturing processes that rely less on ​the minerals.\n\nThe Minamitori Island project, however, is the first to attempt to source rare earths domestically.\n\n\"The fundamental solution is to be able to produce rare earths inside Japan,\" said ‌Takahide Kiuchi, executive economist at Nomura Research Institute.\n\n\"If this new round of export controls ends up covering a lot of rare earths, Japanese companies will again make efforts to move away from China, but I don’t think it will be easy,\" he said.",

    "description": "Major gauges made slight losses as Wall Street prepares for a week of major releases against a backdrop of global volatility.",
    "fullText": "US stock futures dropped Sunday night as Wall Street reacted to the Trump administration opening a criminal investigation into Fed Chair Jerome Powell.\n\nDow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) and futures on the S&P 500 (ES=F) fell 0.5%. Contracts tied to the Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) slumped 0.8%.\n\nInvestors were rattled late Sunday evening after Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell released a statement revealing that the Department of Justice had subpoenaed the US central bank.\n\nIn an uncharacteristic video address, Powell stated \"the Department of Justice served the Federal Reserve with grand jury subpoenas, threatening a criminal indictment related to my testimony before the Senate Banking Committee last June.\"\n\nPowell claimed that the move was a direct attack for the setting of interest rates that \"serve the public\" rather than \"following the preferences of the President.\"\n\nThe tumultuous start follows a strong finish to last week, when stocks climbed to fresh record highs. Both the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and the Dow (^DJI) closed Friday at new peaks, extending a rally that pushed the S&P 500 up more than 1% for the week. The Dow and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) posted even stronger gains, rising 2.3% and 1.9%, respectively.\n\nThe significant escalation in Trump’s feud with the Fed chair comes as markets are bracing for the latest consumer inflation report, due Tuesday. The release comes on the heels of Friday’s December jobs report, which showed continued cooling in the labor market without signaling a sharp economic slowdown.\n\nTaken together, the data has reinforced expectations that the Federal Reserve will remain on hold for now, with CME FedWatch offering a 95% probability of rates staying the same.\n\nBeyond the economic calendar, geopolitical developments remain a wildcard. President Trump is reportedly weighing potential action involving Iran, while also escalating pressure on Cuba over Venezuelan oil shipments. Late last week, Trump also renewed controversial comments about Greenland, saying the US could pursue control of the Danish territory “whether they like it or not.”\n\nInvestors are now turning their attention to the first major catalysts of 2026: earnings season and key inflation data. Several of Wall Street’s biggest banks are set to report in the coming days, including JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Wells Fargo (WFC), Citigroup (C), Goldman Sachs (GS), and Morgan Stanley (MS).\n\nVISHNU VARATHAN, HEAD OF ⁠MACRO RESEARCH, ASIA EX-JAPAN, ‌MIZUHO, SINGAPORE\n\n\"The Fed independence question is now well and alive and maybe subject to re-evaluation every few meetings.\n\n\"I think ‍I'm still not sure how sustained and adversarial the attack on the Fed might be. There could be a scenario where Trump could still appoint someone with ​some credibility and allow this person to run the show - so ‌that's probably why markets aren't panicking as yet.\"\n\nANDREW LILLEY, CHIEF RATES STRATEGIST AT BARRENJOEY, SYDNEY\n\n\"Trump is pulling at the loose threads of central bank independence. I don't even believe that he expects that Chair Powell will be charged... The only reason that he's taking these steps is that ⁠he knows that he's not going to ​take control of the Fed, so he ​wants to exert as much undue pressure as he can.\n\n\"It is not good. Don't get me wrong, but I think ‍it will amount to ⁠nothing. Investors won't be happy about it, but it shows actually Trump has no other levers to pull. The cash rate ⁠will stay what the majority of the FOMC wants them to be.\"",

I was born in Montreal, Canada, speak French and English.\n\n“My mom was born in Toronto, Canada, and my grandparents are from the Philippines. My dad was born in Ecuador and that is why I speak Spanish.”\n\nFernandez is evidently a keen football fan, but it’s clear she made the right decision by moving into tennis.\n\nThe 23-year-old boasts five career titles on the WTA Tour, and once reached as high as number 13 in the world rankings.\n\nHer only Grand Slam final appearance came at the US Open back in 2021, when she lost out to Emma Raducanu.\n\nShe’s also experienced Grand Slam doubles heartache, having lost the 2023 French Open doubles final playing with Taylor Townsend.\n\nFernandez is currently ranked 22nd on the WTA Tour, and she will be the 22nd seed at the upcoming Australian Open.",

    "fullText": "Bokang Masunyane has shared his thoughts on reigning ONE Strawweight MMA world champion Joshua Pacio, praising both the Filipino’s character and his standing within the division.\n\nKnown for his speed and relentless pressure, Masunyane has built a reputation as one of the most exciting contenders in ONE Championship.\n\nBut before setting his sights on the title, the South African fighter made clear that his respect for Pacio runs deep — even as he plots his route toward the belt.\n\nMasunyane’s comments highlight the mutual admiration that exists among elite competitors, even when their goals inevitably collide inside the cage.\n\nSpeaking to ONE Championship, Masunyane said: “I like Pacio. He’s got a very good personality, he’s got a good heart, he’s a fan’s favorite in the division.”\n\nThe remark offered a glimpse into the sportsmanship often seen at the highest levels of MMA. While rivals in pursuit of the same prize, Masunyane’s tone reflected genuine appreciation for Pacio’s approach both inside and outside competition.\n\nPacio, who continues to defend his title with composure and skill, has long been viewed as one of the sport’s most respected champions. His balance of humility and confidence has made him a symbol of consistency for the Strawweight division.\n\nMasunyane’s praise reinforces how Pacio’s influence extends beyond his performances — shaping how upcoming contenders carry themselves in pursuit of the same success.\n\nStill, Masunyane made it clear that his admiration will not stop his ambition. “As a fighter, I’d like to fight as much as I can. Whoever wants to fight me on my way to the title.\n\n“They are standing in my way, and my goal is to get that title shot, so I’m going through everyone in this division,” he told ONE Championship.”\n\nThose words underline the determination driving Masunyane’s climb. Despite acknowledging Pacio’s qualities, his focus remains squarely on his own mission, earning the chance to face the champion in the near future.\n\nMasunyane’s steady rise has positioned him among the top contenders at Strawweight. If his performances continue to impress, the path he’s describing may soon lead directly to Pacio himself.\n\nFor now, respect defines their relationship. But in ONE Championship, respect and rivalry often walk the same line, and Masunyane seems ready to cross it when the opportunity comes.",

It was another dominant week for Sabalenka, who continues to build her legacy on tour.\n\nSabalenka went into Brisbane as the top seed and made her way through a competitive draw that included wins over Madison Keys and Karolina Muchova before finishing with another strong showing against Kostyuk.\n\nSabalenka has since posted on social media to mark the occasion, sharing on Instagram: “Thank you Brisbane International for all the love, it feels so good to be back.\n\n“Gummy bears and playing doubles with Paula Badosa made this tournament even better. Australia, we are just getting started.”\n\nIn addition to her singles success, Sabalenka also teamed up with Paula Badosa in doubles play. The two, who share a strong friendship off the court, made an appearance together during the tournament.\n\nThey won their first match of the event but did not compete in their scheduled quarter-final shortly after.\n\nSabalenka’s words are bound to catch the attention of the rest of the WTA Tour, especially given how sharp she looks at this stage of the season.\n\nShe clearly enjoys playing in Australia, and her current form only adds to her reputation as a player who thrives in these conditions.\n\nAs the top seed, she is set to compete in the Australian Open, a hard-court event where she has secured two of her four Grand Slam titles.\n\nHaving also reached the 2025 final, the Belarusian lost to Madison Keys. Meanwhile, Sabalenka has now achieved a remarkable record in Australia, winning 38 of her past 40 matches.\n\nThis kind of consistency makes Sabalenka a strong contender for another title run, and few will be surprised if she lifts the trophy again.",

    "fullText": "The Apple iPhone is the most popular mobile phone line in the United States and one of the most popular series of devices in the world with an estimated 1.6 billion iPhone users across the globe. Unfortunately, many of those users are now at risk.\n\nOver the past few weeks, Apple has been issuing a warning about a security flaw that data shows would impact around half of those iPhone users, which is around 800 million.\n\nLate last month, Apple began warning users of two critical flaws found in WebKit, which is the browser engine that powers Safari and all browsers on iOS. The flaws left iPhone users vulnerable an \"extremely sophisticated attack\" which would targeting specific individuals.\n\nApple said that the critical flaw could allow hackers to be able to take control of an iPhone or iPad by using malicious websites on the compromised web browsers and trick the device into executing harmful instructions.\n\nThe flaw left users vulnerable to hackers who could potentially take controll of the iPhone or iPad or run code without your permission, possibly obtaining passwords or payment information.\n\nThe good news is that Apple has already created a patch to correct the vulnerability in its latest software update. However, those that have not installed the software update are vulnurable.\n\nForbes estimates that 50% of all eligible iPhone users have yet to upgrade from iOS 18 to iOS 26. Given that there are more than 1.6 billion iPhone users worldwide, this means that around 800 million devices are still vulnerable. StatCounter has an even more pessimistic view, estimating that just 20% of users have upgraded, which would leave more than 1.2 billion iPhone users vulnerable.\n\nAccording to Apple, the devices most at risk include the iPhone 11 and later, the iPad Pro 12.9-inch (3rd generation and later), and the iPad Pro 11-inch (1st generation and later). Other vulnerable models include the iPad Air (3rd generation and later), the iPad (8th generation and later), and the iPad mini (5th generation and later).\n\nUnfortunately, the only way to protect yourself from these vulnerabilities is upgrade to the latest version of iOS, which is iOS 26.2.\n\nWhile it was expected that Apple would make a security update for users wanting to stick with iOS 18 for a bit longer, that is no longer the case, as iOS 18.7.3 is not available unless you’re running an iPhone that can’t run iOS 26.\n\n“There’s no workaround or user behavior that meaningfully mitigates this risk,” says Keeper Security’s Darren Guccione, via Forbes.\n\nHe went on to explain that upgrading to the latest version of the software is \"the only effective defense. Once patches are public, the exposure window widens for anyone who delays updating.”\n\nThe good news is that installing the update is easy. In fact, for users with automatic updates enabled, the software should be up to date and the patch should already be installed.\n\nIf you do not have automatic updates enabled, you will need to manually download iOS 26.2 or iPadOS 26.2 through their device settings. In this case, users should simply open the \"settings\" app then click \"general\" followed by \"software update.\"",

    "description": "From Davos and the Super Bowl to Burning Man and St. Barts, see the predictable social calendar billionaires follow and how much it all costs.",
    "fullText": "Like wildebeest migrating across the plains of East Africa or monarch butterflies flying thousands of miles south every winter, billionaires are a remarkably predictable breed.\n\nThe world's nearly 3,000 billionaires follow a familiar annual circuit: cruising between vacation spots on superyachts, jetting to marquee sporting events, and suiting up for the same closed-door business conferences.\n\n\"Birds of a feather flock together,\" Doug Gollan, the founder of Private Jet Card Comparison, told Business Insider.\n\nEach year, private jets congregate at events like The Masters or Super Bowl, he said.\n\n2026 is no different. There will be the Davos and Sun Valley conferences, the FIFA World Cup, and the Monaco yacht show. In between, some billionaires may attend Art Basel or the Oscars.\n\nHere's a look at the 2026 billionaire calendar — and how much it would cost to join them.\n\nBusiness leaders and politicians gather at the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, to kick off their year with policy discussions, networking, and, if time allows, some ski runs.\n\nThis year's summit, which runs from January 19 to 23, is themed \"A Spirit of Dialogue.\" While speakers have not been announced, regular attendees include BlackRock CEO Larry Fink (a cochair of the WEF), Bridgewater founder Ray Dalio, and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff.\n\nAccess to the invite-only event can cost tens of thousands of dollars, and most of Davos' luxury hotels, such as the Steigenberger Grandhotel Belvédère and AlpenGold, are closed to the public.\n\nApartment rental rates typically jump during the event, with nearby units commanding at least four figures a night. The surge pricing also applies to food. With most of the restaurants booked up for conference events, you may be left paying $43 for a hot dog.\n\nNFL teams are popular toys of the ultrarich: Walmart's Rob Walton has the Broncos, hedge fund manager David Tepper owns the Panthers, Clark Hunt and his siblings control the Chiefs, and so on.\n\nThese billionaire owners — as well as billionaire fans and friends — flock to the Super Bowl, and this year's game on February 8 in Santa Clara, California, will be no exception.\n\n\"The Super Bowl is always a draw. It's an excuse to see the best of the best in terms of sports, parties, and entertainment,\" Elisabeth Brown, client manager at travel and lifestyle concierge company Knightsbridge Circle, told Business Insider.\n\nHost committees and travel agencies curate luxury experiences for the wealthiest football fans, which can cost six figures and include chartered jets, five-star accommodations, and access to the field after the game. Throughout the weekend, there are VIP parties featuring celebrity guests and billionaire hosts, like Fanatics CEO Michael Rubin, who's become known for his star-studded annual Super Bowl bash.\n\nThe most exclusive celebration of them all, though, is in the winning team's locker room. Just ask billionaire Jeffrey Lurie, whose Philadelphia Eagles snagged the trophy last year.\n\nAs Hollywood and the tech world become increasingly intertwined, the Academy Awards and the various events surrounding it have become a magnet for billionaires.\n\nOprah Winfrey took the stage at last year's ceremony to honor Quincy Jones, and the Vanity Fair Oscars Party drew Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez Bezos — Amazon produced nominee \"The Nickel Boys\" — as well as Alphabet cofounder Sergey Brin and Skims cofounder Kim Kardashian. Two other billionaires, Jay-Z and Beyoncé, typically throw a rival after-party at Chateau Marmont.\n\nThis year's Oscars, which will be held on March 15, are likely to draw a similarly monied crowd. Larry Ellison, whose son David Ellison leads the storied movie studio Paramount, may make an appearance, as may billionaires Steven Spielberg, who produced in Best Picture hopeful \"Hamnet,\" and James Cameron, director of \"Avatar: Fire and Ash.\"\n\nThe Masters Tournament, taking place from April 9 to 12 this year, kicks off the run of major professional golf championships and signals the start of spring for billionaires.\n\nEach year, hundreds of private aircraft land at the airports around Augusta. In past years, billionaires like former Nike CEO Phil Knight, hotelier Robert Rowling, and investor Herbert Allen Jr. have had their planes touch down. So has Tiger Woods, the only billionaire winner of The Masters.\n\nThe tournament's venue, the famously exclusive Augusta National Golf Club in Georgia, counts a number of billionaires among its members.\n\nWarren Buffett, Bill Gates, Warren Stephens, David Ziff, and Stanley Druckenmiller have belonged to the club, Bloomberg reported in 2015. It's invite-only, and new members can only join when existing ones leave.\n\nThe general public can spectate alongside some of the biggest names in business. Tickets for the Masters are available through a lottery system.\n\nEvery year, the Milken Institute, a think tank founded by billionaire investor Michael Milken, hosts the Milken Global Conference in Los Angeles.\n\nDubbed the Davos of the West Coast, Milken launched the summit in 1998 as a forum for discussions on economic and policy matters.\n\nWhile the program for this year's conference, running from May 3 to 6, has not been announced, last year, Henry Kravis, Bill Ackman, and Jensen Huang were among the billionaire speakers.\n\nThe event isn't technically invite-only; members of the public can pay $35,000 to support the Institute as a council member and receive complimentary admission.\n\nWhile billionaires tend to spend June in the Hamptons or on yachts crisscrossing the Mediterranean, this year, many are expected to head to arenas across North America for the FIFA World Cup.\n\n\"The big, big, big thing everybody's talking about and getting tickets for right now is the World Cup,\" Charlie Garcia, the founder of centimillionaire membership club R360, told Business Insider.\n\nThe soccer competition, which takes place every four years, starts in June and runs through early July. Tickets for the final at MetLife Stadium start at over $9,000 on the resale market.\n\nWhile the tournament organizes teams by country, many star players are signed to clubs owned by billionaires, including Todd Boehly and Mark Walter's Chelsea, Stan Kroenke's Arsenal, and John Henry's Liverpool.\n\nThere will likely be at least one billionaire on the field: Cristiano Ronaldo, who is set to play for Portugal.\n\nPrivate jets descend on the small town of Hailey, Idaho, every July for the Allen & Company Sun Valley Conference.\n\nSince 1983, boutique investment bank Allen & Co. — its president, Herbert Allen, is a billionaire himself — has hosted the event, which attracts the biggest and richest names in business, such as Jeff Bezos, Sam Altman, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, and Warren Buffett.\n\nThe conference has become known for the deals struck in between rounds of golf, guided hikes, and tennis matches. It's where Jeff Bezos snagged The Washington Post for $250 million in 2013 and where the seed for Disney's $19 billion acquisition of ABC was planted in 1995.\n\nLast year was no exception. David Ellison, the scion of billionaire Larry Ellison, met with Bari Weiss at the conference to discuss Paramount Skydance's potential purchase of The Free Press, The New York Times reported. In October, the $150 million deal was announced.\n\nThe vacation-cum-business-meeting is invite-only and pretty much restricted to masters of the universe. Security is strict, with even the press walled off from most of the wheeling and dealing.\n\nBurning Man — the anticapitalist art and music festival in the Nevada desert — has been a rite of passage for the tech elite for decades.\n\nGoogle cofounders Sergey Brin and Larry Page are longtime Burners — the festival inspired the very first Google Doodle — as is Eric Schmidt, Google's former CEO. Facebook cofounders Dustin Moskowitz and Mark Zuckerberg, and Uber cofounder Garrett Camp have also attended. Even Ray Dalio, the billionaire hedge fund manager, joined in 2019.\n\nLast year's festival, marked by storms in Black Rock City, drew fewer billionaires than in previous years.\n\nStill, hundreds of private planes flew into Burning Man's temporary airport during the festival. The starting price to charter a plane through Burner Express Air was $18,000, one way.\n\nThis year's festival runs from August 30 to September 7, with planning already underway by the Burning Man Project.\n\nThe coastline of Monte Carlo, already a haven for the ultrawealthy, becomes crowded with superyachts at the end of September for the Monaco Yacht Show, where billionaires scope out their new toys.\n\nThe 120-plus superyachts on display feature elevators, bars, spas, pools, gyms, hot tubs, and helipads, and were worth a combined $5 billion last year. Jet Skis and submersibles are popular add-ons.\n\nLast year's yacht show featured yachts owned by the likes of billionaires Denis O'Brien and Paul Fireman. The largest of them, Mar, is still listed for sale with an asking price of $230 million.\n\nIn the past, yachts owned by billionaires such as Paul Allen, Steve Wynn, and Sergey Brin have been exhibited at the show.\n\nThe Monaco Yacht Show is open to the public, with one-day passes starting at about $800.\n\nOctober presents numerous opportunities for the affluent to expand their art collections.\n\nFirst, the Frieze Art Fair and nearby Frieze Masters, held annually in London, focus on contemporary art and pre-21st-century art, respectively. In years past, collectors like Point72's Steve Cohen and Diamond titan Laurence Graff have been spotted there.\n\nShortly after, across the English Channel, is Art Basel Paris, a relatively new addition to the art fair circuit.\n\nLast year's fair drew James Murdoch, an investor in Art Basel's parent company, as well as Delphine Arnault, the daughter of Bernard, and billionaire art collector J. Tomilson Hill.\n\nA painting by Gerhard Richter marked the fair's biggest sale, fetching $23 million, and several works sold for seven-figure sums. Exactly which moneyed collectors are behind specific purchases tends to be kept under wraps.\n\nWhile the VIP previews, when most billionaires are spotted, are invite-only, anyone can buy tickets to these shows themselves, which begin on October 14 with the Frieze fairs.\n\nFormula 1 has become a passion for billionaires over the past couple of decades.\n\nThe racing business itself is owned by John Malone's Liberty Media, and nearly all of the teams are connected to billionaires through their ownership structures.\n\nThe various Grand Prix attract these wealthy owners and fans thanks to the races and parties. Monaco maybe a marquee of the F1 calendar, but newer events like the Las Vegas Grand Prix increasingly draw big names.\n\nLast year's race drew billionaires, including Beyoncé and Jay-Z, Magic Johnson, Fanatics founder and CEO Michael Rubin, and Aston Martin Team owner Laurence Stroll.\n\nThree-day passes for the Sin City heat, which runs from November 19 to 21 this year, started at $400 for general admission last year but rose considerably for various seating and package options.\n\nWhile Aspen and Vail remain billionaire favorites over the holidays, no destination is as popular as St. Barts when it comes to ringing in the new year.\n\nLast year, superyachts owned by the likes of David Geffen, Jerry Jones, and Eric Schmidt were moored off the Caribbean island's coast. Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez Bezos were seen partying at a beach club.\n\nFor those who don't stay on yachts, rooms at popular luxury hotels like Eden Rock and Cheval Blanc, owned by Bernard Arnault's LVMH, cost upward of $7,000 a night.\n\n\"There is nothing mass-market about it,\" Winston Chesterfield, the founder of Barton, a consulting firm focused on luxury and the wealthy, told Business Insider. \"It's impossible to be there unless you are really wealthy.\"",

    "title": "What it's like working as a private jet flight attendant who makes over $100,000 a year",
    "description": "Private jet flight attendant Kelley Lokensgard earns over $100,000 and travels the world for essentially free. But it is a lot of work and long hours.",
    "fullText": "\"I grocery shop the night before, then arrive two hours before the flight; I load my flower arrangements, prep my boarding appetizers, and touch up the cabin,\" Lokensgard, the chief cabin attendant at Silver Air Private Jets, told Business Insider. \"People don't realize how many fingerprints they leave behind.\"\n\nThat behind-the-scenes work is part of serving wealthy vacationers, business executives, and celebrities who expect flawless service and discretion.\n\nLokensgard, what started in 2021, said the job can be nonstop: she's on duty for up to 21 days a month, sometimes at a moment's notice, and is responsible for catering meals and tailoring each flight to client preferences.\n\nThis is a level of invisible labor that few people outside private aviation ever see; it's not the glitz and glamour that social media often portrays. But Lokensgard — whose background is in music, youth education, and fine dining — said she loves the grind.\n\n\"It's a lot of schlepping and problem-solving and delicate communication with a lot of moving parts and people; you have to be a laborer to want to do this job,\" she said. \"I can't imagine something that better suits my random scope of skills.\"\n\nPrivate flight attendants are a small but growing niche within aviation. Jobs, which are largely non-union, span from small and medium-sized private companies like Silver Air to mega operators like NetJets and VistaJet.\n\nWhile many roles offer full-time benefits, as in Lokensgard's case, others resemble gig work, which can allow for a flexible lifestyle but often comes with less predictability and fewer labor protections than at most US airlines.\n\nThe work often involves long, irregular hours, extended travel, and the demands of high-profile clients. And private flight attendants usually don't have access to the free standby flights that commercial crew typically enjoy — meaning they only fly if a seat is available.\n\nStill, there's a significant payoff. Lokensgard gets to see the world through the destinations of her clients — essentially for free — while earning much more than most of her airline counterparts.\n\nLokensgard, who lives in Los Angeles, earns in the low six figures, though she said some veteran, freelance, and specially skilled VIP cabin attendants can make as much as $350,000 annually. Glassdoor puts the nationwide median annual salary at about $94,000.\n\nTo prepare for her role, Lokensgard completed five days of training and an online course: \"There was so much to learn, it's professionalism, luxury, service, and safety,\" she said. Silver Air also sponsored culinary classes.\n\nHer training is far shorter than the weekslong courses commercial flight attendants must complete, though that's because the Federal Aviation Administration does not regulate corporate cabin attendant positions — its \"flight attendant\" rules apply to airlines and public charters, not private jets.\n\nThis means cabin training varies widely across private operators, though Lokensgard, as chief attendant, said she is incorporating more shadow flying and collaborative learning at her company.\n\nLokensgard spends most of her days on the Gulfstream G550, a giant multimillion-dollar private jet with a bedroom and enough range to travel across oceans and continents. The plane has an owner but is also managed by Silver Air as a rental; Lokensgard serves whoever is on board.\n\nShe said these often long flights mean she is away from home for days at a time and must work early and late hours. A flight from the Los Angeles-area Van Nuys Airport to Tokyo, for example, would take about 11 hours and involve at least two meal services, she said.\n\nLokensgard must organize catering for the passengers, but is regularly asked to cook. She'll meal-prep meats and vegetables the night before and has access to an approved skillet, oven, microwave, and chiller to work with on the plane.\n\n\"Sometimes our clients don't want catering, and I will be told, 'Hey, arrange steak, sushi, chicken tenders, french fries, salads, fruit platter, snacks, and desserts for the flight,'\" she said. \"I'll shop at Erewhon, or I'll ask a local steakhouse to sear a steak that I'll finish off on the plane. Your head just explodes with ideas.\"\n\nErewhon is the US' most expensive grocery store and a hotspot for the LA elite.\n\nBesides food service, Lokensgard said she must also perform safety checks, prepare meals for the pilots, and make the bed, among other duties. She added that there is surprisingly little time to rest, even on ultra-long-haul flights.\n\nOn the ground, Lokensgard is responsible for tasks like dishes, dry cleaning, and arranging catering for the next trip. After international flights, everyone clears customs, and Lokensgard must follow agricultural rules when disposing of food and trash.\n\nRest policies vary by operator. Lokensgard said her crew gets at least a day of rest after long-haul international flights; previously, Silver Air cabin attendants often finished such trips only to almost immediately hop on a commercial flight home. She receives a minimum of 10 hours of rest after shorter flights.\n\nLokensgard added that it sometimes makes more logistical sense for the crew to stay with the plane for a few days in its destination, giving her extra time to explore places ranging from major cities like London, New York City, and Nice to quaint ski towns in Austria.\n\n\"I make the most of it since we're sacrificing time away from our families and communities,\" she said. \"We explore, see museums, and eat amazing food.\" She also dedicates time to cultivating relationships with local chefs in the cities she visits for catering needs.\n\nOnce home, Lokensgard said the first thing she does is wash her clothes and repack her suitcase, adding that she keeps a spare uniform in her car: \"I have my road wardrobe and toiletries and my home ones.\"\n\nThat constant readiness is essential in private aviation.\n\nFor example, on one reserve day — when she's on standby for last-minute flights — Lokensgard was called at 6 a.m. for a flight that had to take off by 8:30 a.m. But the plane was departing from Teterboro Airport in New Jersey, at least 30 minutes from the crew's Manhattan hotel.\n\n\"We're ripping back the covers and packing our bags,\" she said. \"We're calling to get the fuel trucks ready; I'm DoorDashing food to the airport and studying the client's eight-page portfolio, but we were in the air by 8:26 a.m. That really built trust with the client.\"",

    "fullText": "The Chicago Bears continue to prove that they like to hibernate, but they do not die. After having six comeback wins in the regular season, they capped off yet another one in their postseason matchup against the Green Bay Packers, winning 31-27 in a stunning comeback victory to advance to the divisional round of the playoffs.\n\nThings looked bleak early, as the Bears fell behind 21-3 in the first half after Jordan Love threw three touchdown passes. The Bears offense sputtered too many times and failed to convert on multiple fourth downs as faith in the defense was at an all-time low. Things looked bleak, but the team didn't lose hope.\n\nQuarterback Caleb Williams and the defense rallied in the second half to turn the momentum, scoring 28 points to storm back and retake the lead. Key passes to Colston Loveland, DJ Moore, and Rome Odunze kept drives alive as the Bears took control of the game from the Packers. After Williams found Moore for the go-ahead score late in the fourth quarter, the Packers were unable to mount one more scoring drive.\n\nIt was the craziest comeback victory in a season full of them, and the NFL world took notice. Here is how social media reacted to the victory.\n\nTHE BOOGEYMAN IS DEAD \n\nTHE CURSE IS BROKEN \n\nBEN JOHNSON AND CALEB WILLIAMS JUST ENDED GREEN BAY’S SEASON IN YEAR ONE pic.twitter.com/7sjrEmk97D\n\n— Barstool Chicago (@barstoolchicago) January 11, 2026\n\n— Freezing Cold Takes (@OldTakesExposed) January 11, 2026\n\n— C.J.

Steinberg \n\n Working Paper 34627\n\n DOI 10.3386/w34627\n\n Issue Date January 2026\n\nWe study international spillovers of corporate tax reforms in a fragmented global tax regime. Using firm-level evidence on the 2017 U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) and a quantitative general-equilibrium model, we illustrate how multinational enterprises (MNEs) propagate local policy shocks throughout the global economy. Our framework emphasizes two key intrinsic properties of intangible capital: non-rivalry and mobile ownership. We find the TCJA generated positive outward spillovers: First, it boosted U.S. MNEs’ intangible investment, raising their foreign subsidiaries’ output. Second, it increased tangible investment of foreign MNEs’ U.S. subsidiaries, incentivizing them to expand intangible investment at home. Conversely, a Global Minimum Tax (GMT) implemented by the rest of the world generates negative inward spillovers for the United States, even if U.S.-parented MNEs are exempt. These findings illustrate that there is no such thing as a purely domestic corporate tax policy.\n\n Acknowledgements and Disclosures\n\nWe are grateful to the International Tax Policy Forum for financial support of this project.

I don’t have a clear memory of why this goal has stayed with me since I was very young, through my entire life,” Baggio told Forbes Italia via Gazzetta.\n\n“I have always considered myself an ordinary person. Just like everyone else. I never saw myself as special. I only had this uncontrollable passion for football. A passion that stirs something inside you from morning to night. I slept with the ball.\n\nItalian former football player Roberto Baggio (R) and Argentine-born Italian former football player, David Trezeguet (L) gesture before the beginning of the Argentina 2023 U-20 World Cup final match between Uruguay and Italy at the Estadio Unico Diego Armando Maradona stadium in La Plata, Argentina, on June 11, 2023.

It was the goal I was always chasing. The last thought before going to sleep was how to win that World Cup. Maybe by scoring a bicycle kick.\n\n“Then it turned out in a way I never would have imagined, and I will never be able to forget it. Just one step away from the finish line. The greatest bitterness of my football career, an unbelievable personal tragedy, I still carry that weight inside me.”\n\nFLORENCE, ITALY – JUNE 03: Roberto Baggio looks on during a press conference at Centro Tecnico Federale di Coverciano on June 03, 2024 in Florence, Italy. (Photo by Claudio Villa/Getty Images)\n\nBaggio took part in three World Cups. The Azzurri finished third in 1990, runners-up in 1994 and were eliminated in the quarter-finals by eventual winners France in 1998.\n\n“I played in three World Cups. In Italy [1990], we finished third, winning six matches and drawing one. I lost three World Cups on penalties, not easy to digest,” he concluded.",

    "fullText": "Ireland's Department of Foreign Affairs has recalled nearly 13,000 passports after a software update caused a printing defect.\n\nThe printing error makes the documents non-compliant with international travel standards and potentially unreadable at automated border gates.\n\nThe government said the affected passports, issued between December 23 and January 6, may fail at eGates and border control systems worldwide, prompting a global alert through the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) and a mass re-issuance program.\n\n\"The Passport Office has confirmed that 12,904 Irish passports issued between 23 December 2025 and 6 January 2026 [inclusive] may not fully meet international travel standards,\" announced the government.\n\n\"The issue was caused by a software update, which could affect use at border control or eGates.\"\n\nHolders are being asked to return their passport books (and cards, where applicable) for free replacement, with new documents to be issued within approximately 10 working days.\n\n\"This will ensure that you do not face any issues with future travel. You do not need to reapply for a new passport,\" the official notice states.\n\nWhile the Department of Foreign Affairs has not explicitly specified where the missing \"IRL\" appears, the reference to ICAO compliance and potential failures at eGates strongly suggests the error affects the machine-readable zone (MRZ), where the three-letter issuing-state code is mandatory under ICAO Doc 9303.\n\nThe MRZ is the two-line block of text at the bottom of the passport's bio page that is scanned by airline systems, border control kiosks, and eGates. It encodes critical data such as the document type, issuing country, passport number, nationality, date of birth, and checksums used to verify the document's integrity.\n\nIf the issuing-state code \"IRL\" is missing or malformed in this zone, automated systems may reject the passport outright, even if the visual biographical page and embedded chip appear normal.\n\nThose travelling imminently or overseas residents can get in touch wih the Passport Office customer service via email at passportreturn@dfa.ie or call +353 (0) 1 613 1780.\n\nAs MCP (Model Context Protocol) becomes the standard for connecting LLMs to tools and data, security teams are moving fast to keep these new services safe.\n\nThis free cheat sheet outlines 7 best practices you can start using today.",

    "description": "\"We've now given decision-makers what they need to prepare.\"",
    "fullText": "The United Kingdom has not done enough to prepare for the impact of rising temperatures, and a study has shed light on the worst-case scenarios the government should plan for.\n\nAccording to The Guardian, the findings show exactly how the U.K. could be vulnerable to these risks.\n\nIt's hard to predict the probability of the worst-case scenarios because you can't calculate uncertainty. University of Reading professor and study lead Nigel Armell compared the analysis his team did to what the Bank of England does for the financial system.\n\nThe study, published in the journal Earth's Future, found multiple worst-case scenarios. One of them is where temperatures rise 4 degrees Celsius (7.2 degrees Fahrenheit) and the sea level rises 2 meters.\n\nRising temperatures are also weakening the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, or the  AMOC. If this starts to collapse in 2030, the U.K. would actually see a 6-degree Celsius (10.8-degree Fahrenheit) temperature drop. It would disrupt agriculture and water supply, while also putting a strain on energy demand in winter.\n\nAccording to The Guardian, the scientists said, \"A collapse of even one part of AMOC, the sub-polar gyre, would reduce U.K. temperatures by 2.5 degrees Celsius.\"\n\nIf the Amazon sees a mass die-off, releasing polluting gases into the atmosphere, this could send global temperatures 4 degrees Celsius higher by 2100.\n\nThe Guardian noted, \"This would result in extreme and prolonged heatwaves and droughts hitting the U.K. in summer.\"\n\nCutting industry pollutants too quickly can also have an effect, including a rise in temperature of 0.75 degrees Celsius (1.35 degrees Fahrenheit), because these pollutants block the sun.\n\nAnother worst-case scenario is extreme weather events. Temperatures could rise 6 degrees Celsius above the average, and rainfall could be triple the average.\n\nHow worried are you about rising ocean levels?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nWhile extreme weather events such as these were always going to happen, rising temperatures intensify them, as this worst-case scenario is showing.\n\nWhile sea levels are already higher, if Greenland and Antarctica's glaciers melt even more quickly by 2100, this would flood cities in the U.K. Rising sea levels are already on planners' minds, unlike the other scenarios.\n\nAdditionally, the global temperature rise of 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.34) has already seen many deaths during heatwaves.\n\nA 2021 House of Lords report indicated that the U.K. government was not giving sufficient attention to high-impact, low-likelihood worst-case scenarios.\n\nIn addition, the Climate Change Committee, an independent advisory group, said that the U.K. needs to adapt to a 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) rise, while assessing risks in case a 4 degrees Celsius rise happens. The 2023 adaptation plans were described as being weak.\n\nAccording to The Guardian, \"The research was commissioned by the Met Office as part of the government's climate resilience programme.\"\n\nIt's vital that this kind of research on climate issues continues to better understand how to prepare for these potentially dangerous scenarios.\n\n\"The U.K. has been planning without the tools to test against worst-case scenarios,\" said Armell. \"We've now given decision-makers what they need to prepare for climate outcomes they hope never happen, but can't afford to ignore.\"\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "On Jan. 7, the U.S. Supreme Court deferred ruling on the litigation challenging President Donald Trump's global tariffs\n\nThe new date for the next ruling is set for Jan. 14.\n\nWhen Trump announced sweeping \"reciprocal\" tariffs targeting countries across the world on Apr. 2, 2025, a day he dubbed \"Liberation Day,\" he invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).\n\nThe administration had argued that trade deficits constituted a national emergency and the president didn't need to consult with Congress to levy global tariffs.\n\nSeveral businesses affected by the decision and 12 U.S. states, mostly Democratic-governed, then went to the Supreme Court to challenge Trump's tariffs.\n\nIf the court rules that the president was wrong in invoking the emergency powers, the Trump administration will have to reimburse importers who already have paid the duties. The reimbursement is estimated to be more than $133.5 billion as per a Reuters report.\n\nBut the administration could get away with only limited repayments if the court decides to grant limited powers to the president under IEEPA.\n\nThe court's decision carries far-reaching implications for not only the global economy but also the crypto market.\n\nThe digital assets market got increasingly tied to Wall Street last year and Trump's tariff announcements frequently rattled the markets throughout 2025.\n\nIn fact, it was Trump's threat to hike tariffs on China on Oct. 10 last year that triggered the crypto flash crash in which more than $19 billion got wiped out in a day.\n\nWealthy trader moves millions ahead of Trump’s ‘big’ economic speech\n\nMysterious trader bets millions ahead of the Fed’s big announcement\n\nMysterious traders are selling ahead of Trump's 9PM address to the nation\n\nAhead of key policy announcements, mysterious crypto traders often place market orders and net millions of dollars.\n\nAs reported earlier, a trader made millions by shorting cryptocurrencies ahead of Trump's China announcement on Oct. 10.\n\nRecently, a crypto trader on Polymarket profited over $400,000 by betting on Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro's ouster.\n\nNotably, the trader had created his Polymarket account only a day earlier, triggering speculations of insider trading.\n\nOnce again, a crypto whale placed an order as markets buzzed with reports of a Supreme Court ruling expected on Jan. 9.",

    "title": "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang Warns Investors That the AI Market Is Bigger Than They Realize With Over ‘One and a Half Million AI Models in the World’",
    "description": "Jensen Huang explains artificial intelligence as a multi-layered platform, arguing its true impact extends far beyond consumer-facing language models.",
    "fullText": "Bottom Line Up Front: Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang, in his role as the leader of the primary company behind the ongoing technology movement, says that many people don’t realize just how big the AI revolution is. He says there are currently over 1.5 million AI models throughout the world, from healthcare and drug discovery to more commonly known names like Elon Musk’s Grok and Sam Altman’s ChatGPT.\n\nThe Details: Nvidia founder and chief executive Jensen Huang has consistently framed artificial intelligence as an infrastructure-scale transformation rather than a single technological breakthrough. In a fireside chat hosted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) with President and CEO Dr. John J. Hamre, Huang continued outlining his layered view of AI, emphasizing the systems, capital, and breadth of applications that underpin the technology’s long-term impact.\n\nJeff Bezos Launched a Secretive AI Startup in 2025 That Should Give Wall Street Chills\n\nThe Top-Rated Dividend King to Buy for 2026\n\nEvercore Analysts Love UnitedHealth Stock for 2026. Should You Buy UNH Here?\n\nTired of missing midday reversals? The FREE Barchart Brief newsletter keeps you in the know. \n\nBuilding on earlier discussion of energy, chips, and systems, Huang described the current infrastructure buildout of AI as being multi-layered. The first layer is simple: energy. Huang frames electricity buildout as the most fundamental part of the entire AI revolution.\n\nThe next is Nvidia itself: Chips. Without chips, there’s nothing to use electricity and process the AI compute needed to run the AI models.\n\nHuang then highlights the third layer, which “includes financial services, because it takes an enormous amount of capital to do what we do.” His remarks highlight that AI development at scale is not only a technical challenge, but also a financial one, requiring sustained investment in data centers, networking, and long-lived computing assets.\n\nHuang then turned to the fourth layer that receives the most public attention: the models themselves. He acknowledged the prominence of well-known systems, describing how “this is where people largely focus on when they talk about AI,” citing examples such as ChatGPT, Anthropic’s Claude, Google’s Gemini, and xAI’s Grok. However, he placed those systems in a much wider context, pointing out that “those are four of the one and a half million AI models in the world.” The statement reframes popular generative models as an incredibly small subset of a far larger and more diverse ecosystem. This statement diversifies the risk away from the larger, more broadly known AI models, and instead frames Nvidia as an infrastructure play amongst a technological revolution being implemented across every industry in the world.",

Without this, maybe I win the first set.\n\n“And same on the tiebreak, I think I made only two out of maybe five first serves. But second and third set, top-5 level, for sure. Amazing, not missing much, running well, serving like hell, volleys, everything.\n\n“So really happy with my level these three matches and looking forward.”\n\nMedvedev’s ranking fell to as low as 18th in the world during the 2025 ATP season.",

    "description": "\"I believe that, within the next decade, we will not only get the world back on track but enter a new era of unprecedented progress,\" Gates wrote in his annual letter.",
    "fullText": "Last year didn’t go the way Bill Gates hoped. As a philanthropist who has dedicated billions to improving everything from healthcare and education in poor countries to climate change action, Gates could only watch as the Trump administration slashed swathes of foreign aid contracts. \n\nThe Microsoft co-founder has criticised the cost-cutting regime, much of which was enacted under Elon Musk’s Department Of Government Efficiency (DOGE). He warned the action could directly result in the death of children, a claim which Tesla CEO Musk demanded evidence.\n\nWriting in his annual letter this year, the Gates Foundation founder was optimistic but candid, writing: “I believe the world will keep improving—but it is harder to see that today than it has been in a long time.”\n\nHe added: “The thing I am most upset about is the fact that the world went backwards last year on a key metric of progress: the number of deaths of children under five years old. Over the last 25 years, those deaths went down faster than at any other point in history. But in 2025, they went up for the first time this century, from 4.6 million in 2024 to 4.8 million in 2025—an increase driven by less support from rich countries to poor countries.”\n\nLast month the Gates Foundation’s Goalkeepers Report revealed an additional 12.5 million child deaths could occur by 2045 if development assistance for health (including government spending) is reduced by 20% from 2024 levels, according to bespoke modelling based on data from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation.\n\n“Friends and colleagues often ask me how I stay optimistic in an era with so many challenges and so much polarization,” Gates wrote. “My answer is this: I am still an optimist because I see what innovation accelerated by artificial intelligence will bring.”\n\nBut, that optimism comes with a deadline, or as Gates puts it “there are footnotes to my optimism.”\n\n“The next five years will be difficult as we try to get back on track and work to scale up new lifesaving tools,” Gates continued. “As hard as last year was, I don’t believe we will slide back into the Dark Ages.”\n\n“I believe that, within the next decade, we will not only get the world back on track but enter a new era of unprecedented progress.”\n\nIn 2025, Gates announced his $200 billion moonshot: He was donating “virtually all [his] wealth”—about $100 billion—to his foundation. It was the largest philanthropic commitment in modern history, and came with strings attached. The funds (made up of its current endowment and projected growth) must be spent in the next 20 years.\n\nWhile Gates made the announcement this year, his intentions have been clear for many years. In 2010 Gates, his wife at the time Melinda French Gates, and Berkshire Hathaway co-founder Warren Buffett launched the Giving Pledge, making a public commitment to philanthropy, which has since been signed by the likes of philanthropist Mackenzie Scott and Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky.\n\nIn a bid to bridge a gap in government funding, Gates is calling on fellow wealthy philanthropists. He wrote: “This idea of treating others as you wish to be treated does not just apply to rich countries giving aid. It must also include philanthropy from the wealthy to help those in need—both domestically and globally—which should grow rapidly in a world with a record number of billionaires and even centibillionaires.”\n\nA report on billionaires from Oxfam, released most recently in January 2025, revealed that in 2024, the number of billionaires rose to 2,769, up from 2,565 a year prior. It also said it expects at least five people to reach trillionaire status a decade from now.\n\nGates added: “I know cuts won’t be reversed overnight, even though aid represented less than 1% of GDP even in the most generous countries. But it is critical that we restore some of the funding.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

    "description": "Stuart Brown has worked at Viking for nearly two decades.",
    "fullText": "Billionaire Andreas Halvorsen will soon lose another longtime lieutenant.\n\nStuart Brown, the longtime head of trading for Viking Global, is stepping down from the $55 billion asset manager to take a career break, two people familiar with the move told Business Insider. The firm declined to comment, and Brown could not be reached for comment.\n\nBrown was at the long-running Tiger Cub, a nickname for hedge funds that spun out of late billionaire Julian Robertson's Tiger Management, for 18 years, according to his bio on the firm's website. He joined the firm after working on the corporate credit sales desk at Credit Suisse.\n\nOne of the people close to the firm said Brown's official departure date is not yet known. Brown will help the firm during a transition period, this person said.\n\nViking has lost several senior members of its team in recent years, which now numbers 275 employees, according to the firm's site.\n\nFrom the investing side, Ning Jin, the former chief investment officer of Viking, left the firm in August 2024 to start his own fund, Avantyr Capital.\n\nOn the operations side of the business, the firm's former general counsel, Andrew Genser, joined former Viking portfolio manager Divya Nettimi's fund, Avala Global, last summer. Viking's director of recruiting, Kevin Curtis, moved to Bobby Jain's eponymous fund in September 2025, and the firm's former investor relations head, Savina Boyadjieva, just started as a partner at Joshua Kushner's Thrive Capital.\n\nWhile Viking's peers include long-short equity funds such as Tiger Global, Coatue, Lone Pine, D1, Maverick, and others, the firm is not as tech-heavy as some of the other Tiger Cubs. In some years, such as 2022, this can help the manager, but when mega-stocks like Nvidia, Amazon, and Microsoft drive a bulk of the market's returns, it can lead to Viking missing out on some gains.\n\nLast year was an example of this: Viking returned less than 9% on the year in its flagship fund, a person close to the manager said, less than the S&P 500 index.",

    "description": "Robotaxi reporter Lloyd Lee breaks down what he saw — and heard — on the ground at the world's largest consumer tech show, CES, in Vegas.",
    "fullText": "The race to dominate the robotaxi space may not be as close as some companies suggest.\n\nLloyd Lee, Business Insider's reporter covering robotaxis and emerging mobility tech, went to CES for the first time to check out the autonomous service from Zoox, Vay, and other providers. Lee, who has taken a few rides with robotaxis recently entering the market, said the experience sharpened his view that one company appears to be significantly ahead — and that the industry still faces major hurdles before the vehicles can truly go mainstream.\n\nIn the Q&A below with BI News Chief Steve Russolillo, Lee breaks down his biggest takeaways from CES, the most impressive tech he saw, and how the experience will shape his coverage in the year ahead.\n\nSteve Russolillo: Lloyd, this is your first time at CES. What are your impressions and biggest takeaways from the event?\n\nLloyd Lee: First, CES is a massive event. It is humanly impossible to stop by every booth no matter how militant you are with your time. Second, I was struck by how much space the convention was dedicated to automobility. I agree with what Paul Costa, a 25-year Apple veteran who worked on the company's self-driving car project and is now at Ford, told me: CES has become a car show as much as it remains a tech show.\n\nRussolillo: What's the craziest and wildest piece of new technology that you saw?\n\nLee: Hyundai Motor Group's booth had a really impressive display of how far it's trying to take autonomy — from EV charging stations and robotaxis to robotic arms and humanoid robots. Boston Dynamics, a Hyundai unit, demoed its Atlas humanoid robot at the booth. Just the way it activates and stands up is terrifying and awe-striking at the same time.\n\nRussolillo: You cover robotaxis for BI and had the opportunity to test drive two different robotaxis this week. What stood out to you the most?\n\nLee: I tried two robotaxi services for the first time, including Amazon's Zoox. There are obviously a lot of smart people working on this technology. But I have to say: Trying those services only made me realize 1.) how far ahead Waymo is or at least appears to be, and 2.) just how difficult it is to make a profitable business case for robotaxis right now.\n\nGetting autonomous driving right is only part of the challenge. There's also the operations side — like fleet scaling and management — that Waymo has had to build up to help make robotaxis feel like a real autonomous ride-hailing service you can use in your day-to-day. (That is if you live in the city Waymo operates.) And even then, we know Waymo is burning money on its service.\n\nRussolillo: What are some of the predictions you've heard from sources about tech, AI and business?\n\nLee: Chris Ahn, a principal at Deloitte with expertise in software-defined vehicles, had a few interesting points.\n\nRussolillo: What startup you never heard before really stole the show and impressed you?\n\nLee: Perhaps less stole the show, but I thought Vay, a German startup developing a driverless car rental service, reminded me that there's still room for some contrarian voices in the driverless space. Remote driving is the big bogeyman for robotaxi companies. You don't want to be caught using it. This startup's entire business model is built around it. Vay is using remote driving — with a potential to pursue autonomy in the future — for a small fraction of the overall driving experience: Getting the car delivered to a renter without a human inside. It was a \"Huh, I never thought about that\" moment.\n\nRussolillo: What did you learn that might change how you go about your tech coverage for BI?\n\nLee: Broadly, emerging technologies like humanoid robots, self-driving cars, and, more generally, AI, contain a lot of unknowns and uncertainties. And company leaders in those spaces can be evasive when you ask for specifics, or they simply don't know the answer. Possibly both. My instinct is to resolve that ambiguity, which in this space, will not always be realistic. Instead, I should write to the uncertainty, not through it. Name the ambiguity, build the story around it.",

    "description": "Countries worldwide have eyes on Greenland for its natural resources, but the island only has one fully operational mine. We visited to find out why.",
    "fullText": "Greenland has no shortage of valuable minerals. What it lacks is almost everything else needed to extract them.\n\nGreenland is one of the most logistically hostile environments on the planet — a place with no roads between towns, limited labor, and weather that can shut down operations without warning.\n\nStill, world leaders and investors across the globe have their eyes on the island for its natural resources, including copper, zinc, graphite, gold, and rare earth elements that can be used in everything from construction and manufacturing to electronics and defense systems.\n\nAs the US, Europe, and other countries look to diversify supply chains away from China, Greenland has drawn renewed attention as a potential alternative. President Donald Trump's latest remarks that the US should annex Greenland for national security reasons — triggering an outcry from its citizens — have also drawn attention to the island and its strategic value.\n\nThere is only one fully operational mine in Greenland. Business Insider's Sarah Andersen visited the mine in June to see why it remains open while others have shut down — and why the island's vast mineral wealth hasn't translated into a mining boom.\n\nYou always have to plan several steps ahead when operating in Greenland, said Bent Olsvig Jensen, managing director of Lumina Sustainable Materials.\n\n\"We have to think of everything because we cannot just pick up the phone and expect spare parts to be available the next morning,\" he said in June.\n\nLumina Sustainable Materials — a private science and mining company group with operations in Greenland, the US, Mexico, and the European Union — operates the island's only fully active mine, located deep inside a fjord system with no road access.\n\nThe mine produces an industrial mineral called anorthosite, used in fiberglass, construction materials, and other industrial applications.\n\nAside from what they've built, which includes a camp, a plant, a warehouse, a harbor, and a small gym and clinic, there is no other infrastructure supporting the site. Everything, including the crew, arrives by ship during the ice-free months or by helicopter when the fjord freezes over for months on end, Jensen said. (Andersen arrived via an eight-hour boat trip from the capital, Nuuk.)\n\nWhen something breaks, there is no overnight delivery.\n\n\"Sometimes you can wait for spare parts for a week or two,\" Dennis Jensen (no relation to Bent Jensen) said during Andersen's visit to the mine. Jensen is the mine's site manager who oversees operations through the long, dark winters, where temperatures can dip to -22°F. When that happens, \"we are not working outside,\" he said.\n\nWinter storms can ground helicopters for days, delaying crew changes and keeping workers on-site longer than planned, Dennis Jensen added.\n\nOn average, \"it takes 16 years to develop a mine, right from the first idea to the actual mine,\" Naaja Nathanielsen, Greenland's minister responsible for natural resources, including minerals, said in June.\n\nFor most of that time, \"you spend money, you don't make a lot of money,\" she said.\n\nIt took Lumina 11 years, for example, to get from exploration to production. Exploration started in 2008 and reached final production in 2019, Bent said.\n\nGreenland has over 100 mineral licenses, spanning early exploration to advanced stages. Many projects stall long before reaching operation, often because they cannot secure long-term financing, Nathanielsen said.\n\nPeople mistakenly think they can begin to extract the minerals on day one, but they can't, Majken Djurhuus Poulsen, a geologist with the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland, told Andersen during her visit.\n\nParts of Greenland host some of the oldest bedrock on the planet, billions of years old, Poulsen said. That history has created many different types of mineral deposits, but the conditions make exploration slow.\n\n\"You can only do exploration for three to four months a year,\" when areas are ice-free enough, she added.\n\nOn top of that, Poulsen said sites can be difficult to get to, often requiring helicopters that push costs higher. There's rarely any infrastructure, so you have to build everything from scratch — from the mine to where workers will live. After all that, identifying a promising deposit can take years, sometimes decades, she added.\n\nAs a result, mining requires investors who are willing to wait years without returns and have a high tolerance for risk. Nathanielsen said Greenland lacks the domestic capital to fund that process and depends heavily on foreign investment.\n\n\"It is quite sobering in terms of trying to keep your providers of capital,\" James Kiernan, honorary chairman of Cordiant Capital, a Canadian multinational investment management firm and one of Lumina's major backing investors, told Andersen in July.\n\nKiernan pointed to multiple examples of mines affected as market realities shifted.\n\n\"There was a mine called Ruby that was open, and they were trying to find rubies. They were open and closed and open and closed,\" he said, referring to the Greenland Ruby mine and describing the stop-start pattern that has defined many efforts on the island.\n\nAt the same time, the government has kept strict environmental and social standards.\n\nBefore any project moves forward, Nathanielsen said companies must answer two questions: Will it create jobs for Greenlanders, and how will it protect the environment?\n\n\"If the project owners cannot answer those two questions on a satisfactory level, if they cannot provide the people with a good answer, they will meet opposition,\" she said.\n\nLumina's success in navigating that process is in part due to its long planning horizons, close coordination with the government, and a business model designed around Greenland's constraints.\n\nStill, the mine has yet to turn a profit, Kiernan told Andersen during a follow-up call on Friday.\n\nBut Bent Jensen and Kiernan said that after years of operating in Greenland's challenging conditions, the company is well-positioned to apply that know-how to other mining projects, and Lumina has recently secured an exploration license to search for rare earth minerals.\n\nMore mines could unlock a new future for Greenlanders, helping pave a path toward greater autonomy as the island seeks to develop new revenue streams to eventually become financially independent from Denmark.\n\nHowever, a mining boom isn't likely at any point soon, Bent Jensen said.\n\n\"I see Greenland developing slowly because it needs to develop organically with the population, with the politicians,\" he said. \"It will be one mine at a time.\"",

    "description": "The World Economic Forum found that AI will reshape most jobs by 2030, with only one path limiting major displacement.",
    "fullText": "The World Economic Forum says the future of work isn't doomed by AI — but most paths forward still involve painful disruption.\n\nIn the \"Four Futures for Jobs in the New Economy: AI and Talent in 2030,\" white paper published on Wednesday, the organization laid out four scenarios based on two variables — how fast AI capabilities advance and how ready workers and institutions are to adapt.\n\nThe scenarios range from rapid AI breakthroughs to slower, more uneven progress.\n\nOnly one scenario — dubbed the \"Co-Pilot Economy\" — is explicitly designed to limit large-scale displacement.\n\nIn that future, AI adoption is widespread but measured, and workers have the skills to use the technology as a complement rather than a replacement.\n\nAs the report puts it, \"Gradual AI progress and availability of AI-ready skillsets shift the focus towards augmentation rather than mass automation.\"\n\nInstead of eliminating roles outright, AI reshapes tasks, with humans staying in the loop.\n\nEven this relatively optimistic scenario is far from static.\n\n\"Although displacement and job churn have risen, governments, businesses, and workers increasingly view AI as an opportunity rather than a threat,\" the WEF's report said.\n\nThe remaining three scenarios are more disruptive, but they differ in pace and severity.\n\nIn \"The Age of Displacement,\" AI advances faster than education and reskilling systems can respond, pushing companies to automate aggressively and leaving large parts of the workforce struggling to keep up.\n\nIn \"Stalled Progress,\" AI continues to improve, but productivity gains are patchy and concentrated among a small number of firms and regions, eroding job quality elsewhere and widening inequality.\n\nIn \"Supercharged Progress,\" explosive AI breakthroughs drive rapid economic growth and innovation — but still render many existing roles obsolete faster than new ones can emerge.\n\nHowever, some researchers caution that the future is unlikely to follow any single, clean path.\n\nJames Ransom, a research fellow at University College London, told Business Insider that AI progress and workforce readiness vary widely across industries, jobs, and regions, resulting in uneven rather than universal disruption.\n\nHe expects displacement to accelerate over the next few years — even as he said most workers are still likely to be on the payroll by 2030.\n\nThe Forum said that the future of work will not be defined by technology alone. Throughout the report, it said that policy choices, corporate strategy, and investment in skills will shape how painful — or manageable — the transition becomes.\n\nSaadia Zahidi, a managing director at the WEF, told Business Insider that the four scenarios \"are not predictions of where the world will be in 2030, but a framework to help leaders prepare for the evolving global economy.\"\n\nTech leaders and AI researchers remain split over how disruptive AI will ultimately be to the workforce.\n\nFigures like Geoffrey Hinton, often described as the \"godfather of AI,\" and Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei have warned that AI could replace large swaths of white-collar work within just a few years.\n\nOthers, including Box CEO Aaron Levie and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, have predicted that AI will deliver explosive productivity gains — even as it renders many existing roles obsolete.\n\nA more optimistic camp, including Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman and Zoom CEO Eric Yuan, have said AI will ultimately augment workers.",

    "description": "I moved from the US to Copenhagen, the world's most livable city. The language and weather were hard to adapt to, so I left nearly two years later.",
    "fullText": "When I moved to Copenhagen in January 2021 for my \"dream job,\" my expectations were high.\n\nI was going to help design a new national museum — full of dinosaur skeletons and other natural wonders — in a place that routinely ranks as one of the happiest and most liveable cities in the world.\n\nJust last year, the Economist Intelligence Unit ranked Copenhagen as the No. 1 most livable city — above places like Vienna, Zurich, and Osaka — while the World Happiness Report named Denmark the second-happiest country in the world, behind only Finland.\n\nAhead of my move, I envisioned the city as a cobblestone paradise of candy-colored houses, vast bike lanes, and delicious cinnamon rolls — a romanticized fantasy reinforced by a stellar reputation.\n\nLittle did I know, I'd come to find myself running at sunrise because it was the only time the city felt like the place I'd been promised.\n\nI grew up in Vermont and lived there while I finished grad school, so I was used to facing long, cold winters.\n\nBut immediately, Copenhagen felt different, with the January sun rising after 8:30 a.m. and disappearing around 3:30 p.m. — leaving me with about two hours less sunlight than I was used to at home.\n\nThe short days often felt gloomy, with frequent rain bringing a layer of gray clouds unlike anything I'd ever seen — it was like an oppressive, immovable blanket across the entire sky. During the winter months, those clouds could rob the city of sunshine for many consecutive days.\n\nI also quickly discovered why the salary I'd been offered seemed high. Prices in Copenhagen were higher than what I was used to in Vermont, making a simple coffee and pastry feel like luxuries I couldn't afford. But maybe I shouldn't have been so surprised, given the city has regularly found itself on \"most expensive city\" lists over the past few years.\n\nRunning at sunrise became my refuge. Weaving through empty streets flanked by beautiful old houses and canals, I felt like I could see the city's magic.\n\nBut beyond those runs, I was struggling.\n\nI spent my first year in Copenhagen taking language classes, exploring street art, and embracing football culture while sipping Carlsberg beers with the Dane I was dating.\n\nYet, it seemed like there were barriers everywhere. Although I speak three languages, I found it difficult to master Danish, leaving me unable to keep up when happy-hour banter inevitably slipped away from English.\n\nThis, of course, didn't make socializing any easier. My colleagues were pleasant, but they already had calcified social circles. I tried to meet new people by attending live music events, but the local smoking culture made it tricky to find bars that weren't filled with cigarette smoke, which I didn't enjoy.\n\nMeanwhile, summer brought its own challenges. Short winter days were replaced by shockingly long summer ones — think over 17 hours of sunlight. This near-constant light wreaked havoc on my sleep, and sunrise runs were only possible before 5 a.m.\n\nIn this land of extremes, it felt impossible for me to attain a good balance.\n\nOn top of that, so many of the perks that helped Copenhagen earn high marks for livability and happiness seemed designed for someone else.\n\nFor example, I didn't have kids, nor was I expecting any, so Denmark's generous maternity leave and excellent childcare were of no use to me.\n\nAnd although employees here are entitled to a whopping five weeks of vacation time, I felt like I couldn't even take advantage of it because my museum project was behind schedule. I just felt pressured to work more.\n\nA year in, my dream job had become a nightmare. It was my second winter, and the combination of work pressure and isolation in an expensive, dark city was taking its toll. I biked to work in the dark each morning and left in the dark each afternoon.\n\nFor months, I continued lacing up my shoes for runs, hoping to recapture that sense of possibility. But instead, I felt like I was chasing something that would never come.\n\nThe empty cobblestone streets that once seemed quaint were now a metaphor for my lonely existence.\n\nIt suddenly hit me during a morning run in early summer — I was done trying to make it work. After securing a job stateside, I left my notice, and just before autumn threatened to transform into another winter, I packed my life into two suitcases. I hadn't even lasted two years.\n\nOn my one-block walk to the metro, my suitcases got soaked in the rain — a fitting goodbye.\n\nLooking back, my time in Copenhagen taught me that independence has its limits. Community, balance, and a sense of belonging matter more to me than I realized, and if I were to live abroad again, I'd need to know I'd have them.",

    "description": "We took a long, international flight on Singapore Airlines' business class. For my family, the best part was the food, but I had issues with the seat.",
    "fullText": "When I booked a family trip from Copenhagen to Singapore, I knew we were facing a 13-hour overnight flight.\n\nFlying with my husband and our 7-year-old son meant comfort wasn't just a luxury — it was a necessity. So, we splurged on business class, using points to bring the cost down to something we could justify.\n\nHere's what it was like — the highs, the lows, and the key thing that made it worthwhile.\n\nA deal popped up on discount search engine seats.aero that seemed too good to pass up: Singapore Airlines business-class seats from Copenhagen to Singapore, bookable through Air Canada's Aeroplan program, for just 80,000 points per person.\n\nSingapore Airlines has a reputation for having one of the best business-class experiences in the world, and the thought of spending 13 hours in lie-flat comfort — especially with a child — was incredibly appealing.\n\nWe transferred our American Express points to Air Canada and booked the seats, paying only about $100 per person in taxes and fees.\n\nThat flight, which could easily cost over $15,000 for three passengers, cost us just over $300 out of pocket.\n\nWhen we boarded the Airbus A350-900, the first thing I noticed was how wide the seats looked. At about 28 inches wide, there was plenty of room for my husband and me, and our son could stretch out without feeling cramped.\n\nEven better, the seats were equipped with numerous compartments — small storage areas for headphones, snacks, books, and charging devices.\n\nAs a parent, I loved being able to keep things organized instead of digging through one overflowing bag the entire flight.\n\nI loved that you could control the seatback setup either directly on the screen or with a pull-out remote. That flexibility made it simple for all of us to watch what we wanted.\n\nThe complimentary noise-canceling headphones were another highlight. They blocked out the hum of the cabin, allowing me actually to enjoy a movie without distraction.\n\nThe food turned out to be one of the highlights of the flight. I started with stuffed chicken paired with potatoes and mushrooms — a flavorful and surprisingly restaurant-quality dish.\n\nWe also tried the oriental-style braised beef cheek, which was tender and rich.\n\nBeyond the formal meal service, there was also an \"anytime\" menu. At any point during the flight, you could order a sandwich, a bowl of egg-noodle soup, or a variety of small snacks.\n\nWe didn't lean on it this time, but as a parent, I loved knowing it was there in case my son got hungry outside of meal times.\n\nAnother unexpected perk: I was able to order a proper latte in the morning. Usually, I avoid airplane coffee altogether, but this was actually good — smooth, not burnt-tasting, and served with a bit of flair in a real mug.\n\nIt felt like a small luxury, but after hours in the air, it made a big difference.\n\nFor me, one downside was the way the seat converted into a bed.\n\nInstead of just reclining with a button, we had to stand up and have the flight attendant flip our seats over. Not great when you're already half-asleep.\n\nAnd once it was a bed, the surface felt surprisingly firm. Since I have back problems, this was not ideal, and it was challenging to find a comfortable position.\n\nHowever, it was certainly better than sleeping upright.\n\nThe lie-flat seat sort of forces your legs into a diagonal position, which can make it difficult to relax during such a long flight.\n\nMy husband and I both found ourselves shifting around trying to get comfortable.\n\nFor our son, though, it was perfect. The smaller frame of a 7-year-old fit right into the angled nook, and he slept soundly while we tossed and turned.\n\nWould I pay cash for this flight? Probably not — the angled footwell and hard bed weren't quite worth the usual five-figure price tag.\n\nHowever, this flight was absolutely worth spending points on.\n\nThe wide seats, smart storage, strong entertainment system, tasty meals, and polished service all combined to make the journey manageable — especially with a child in tow.\n\nAnd arriving in Singapore rested enough to start exploring right away was the ultimate payoff.",

    "fullText": "Copper joined the mega rally in precious and industrial metals in 2025, but the gains might be far from over if recent forecasts for supply and demand prove correct.\n\nCopper ended 2025 with a gain of about 44%, and touched a fresh all-time high this week. Yet, the AI boom might be the key to another 15 years of surging demand at a time when supply is expected to remain constrained.\n\nS&P Global recently published an analysis of the copper market, predicting that demand is likely to increase by 50% by 2040, reaching 42 million metric tons. The report also said that it will be extremely difficult for the mining industry to keep up as companies struggle with aging mines and regulatory hurdles.\n\nThe authors predict that, without new mines or technological advancements, copper production will peak in 2030, leaving the world short of roughly 10 million metric tons by 2040.\n\n\"Several countries have deemed copper a 'critical metal' over the past half decade, including, in 2025, the United States. And with good reason,\" said Carlos Pascual, Senior Vice President, Geopolitics and International Affairs, at S&P Global Energy. \"Copper is the connective artery linking physical machinery, digital intelligence, mobility, infrastructure, communication and security systems.\"\n\nCopper benefited from a broad rush into metals last year that also pushed gold and silver to record highs. Some forecasters have said they think prices for all three metals are likely to decline in the near future as market conditions shift, but copper's industrial importance could continue to buoy it.\n\nJosé Torres, chief economist at Interactive Brokers, said he thinks copper's global strategic importance means prices will remain elevated.\n\n\"Broadly, it has to do with limited supply as nations want to stockpile the cyclical metal to bolster sovereign AI prospects,\" he told Business Insider. \"Governments are afraid that without enough copper, their economies won't remain competitive in a world where advanced technology is increasingly adopted.\"\n\nRita Adiani, president and CEO of rare earth mining company Titan Mining Corporation, believes that a surge in demand, as predicted by S&P, would lead to a period of higher prices.\n\n\"A significant part of the incremental demand is tied to electrification, grid build, data centers/AI and defense, where copper's conductivity and reliability makes substitution harder in critical applications.\"",

    "title": "15 Shows Like 'Fallout' You Should Watch Next",
    "description": "It's the end of the world and they show it.",
    "fullText": "Prime Video's Fallout, an adaptation of the popular video game series of the same name, is set more than two centuries from now on an Earth still devastated by a long-ago nuclear war between the United States and China. The protagonist, Lucy MacLean (Ella Purnell), emerges from the underground fallout shelter where she's lived her entire life in search of her father, and a fuller understanding of the world above, a wasteland is dominated by warring factions and freakish mutants.\n\nIt's a gutsy, hilarious adaptation of out-there source material, and it's wild to consider that, in the space of a couple of years, we've gone from approximately zero worthwhile video game adaptations to having two series (the other being HBO's The Last of Us) contending for Outstanding series Emmys. Strange days. Yet these two are definitely not the only post-apocalyptic narratives you'll find streaming right now. Here are 15 more to shows, from dramatic, to funny, to everything between, to fuel your end times fantasies. (It's fine, everything's fine, I'm fine lol.)\n\nThis '90s were a great time for post-apocalyptic video games, and the 2020s seem to be a great time to adapt them for TV. The most brutal show on Peacock is based on the vehicular combat games that parents probably hated way more than they hated Fallout (it’s a lot of wild, demolition-derby style action involving smashing and/or blowing up your opponents). It stars Anthony Mackie as John Doe, an effective anchor for the chaos of this lawless future America in which the roads have become battlegrounds. There's tons of clever humor amid the frenetic car-on-car (and car-on-semi, car-on-hearse, -ice cream truck, etc.) action. Things go boom, mostly, and sometimes that’s exactly what you want—it’s the show for the 15-year-old gamer inside all of us. Stream Twisted Metal on Peacock.\n\nRebecca Ferguson stars as Juliette Nichols, an engineer who gets wrapped up in an investigation involving the local sheriff (David Oyelowo)—usual procedural stuff, except that the characters all inhabit a massive silo, 144-levels deep, protecting the remaining 10,000 humans from the allegedly poisoned world above. Those running the silo have managed to convince everyone left that only strict adherence to rules and procedures will keep them safe from the dangers outside. This is a more dour, less colorful apocalypse than the one in Fallout—it's a prestige drama that incorporates elements of horror, mystery, and science fiction to tell human stories about fear and control. Two further seasons are coming. Stream Silo on Apple TV+.\n\nWhere The Walking Dead and The Last of Us made prestige television out of the zombie apocalypse, this SyFy channel original is all about treating zombies as a campy, gory good time. Things kick off with a soldier who’s been tasked with transporting a package across country. The package in question is actually a human being, a survivor of a zombie bite who might be able to help create a vaccine (sound familiar?), but the emotional stakes are a lot lower than The Last of Us's tortured trek. It comes from the schlock-masters at The Asylum, purveyors of infamous B-movies like Sharknado, which should tell you all you need to know about the tone. Stream Z Nation on Peacock, Tubi, AMC+, and Shudder.\n\nI've never been particularly convinced that an end-of-the-world narrative needs to be set in the future, and this darkly funny but surprisingly humane show offers up a slice of a real-life apocalypse. Loosely adapting Giovanni Boccaccio's 14th century story collection with hints of Bridgerton-esque swagger, we're taken to plague-ravaged Florence, as a bunch of nobles and attendants make their way across a dangerous landscape to hole up in a countryside villa to wait out the end while draining the liquor supplies—as you would. Rules and social mores are turned upside down, particularly by servant Licisca (Tanya Reynolds), who kind of accidentally kills her lady on the way to the villa and then decides to take her place. Despite being primarily a show about how hell is other people, it makes for an entirely addictive binge experience. Stream The Decameron on Netflix.\n\nAbout 500 years from now, war has eradicated anything resembling civilization and left the planet ravaged, even as some vestiges of technology remain. Still, firearms are largely taboo given the devastation they've caused—allowing for an action apocalypse dominated by kick-ass martial arts combat. The Badlands, Rocky Mountains and Mississippi River are transformed into competing feudal-esque kingdoms, dominated by Marton Csokas's creepy, over-the-top Baron Quinn and, at least initially, his chief lieutenant Sunny (Daniel Wu). Stream Into the Badlands on Prime Video and AMC+.\n\nThis smart, impressively voice-acted, beautifully animated sci-fi epic follows the fates of the stranded survivors of a crashed interstellar cargo ship. The web of natural life on the world on which they find themselves is unusually complex, and the rules of biology they're used to don't seem to apply. The outer space sci-fi setting doesn't, on the surface, have much to do with the blasted desert of Fallout, but both shows are set in imagined worlds that are intricate, colorful, and devilishly clever. Stream Scavengers Reign on HBO Max.\n\nThough initially feeling like an unnecessary extention of Bong Joon Ho's allegorical post-apocalyptic film, Snowpiercer, the show, ultimately takes on a life of its own as a clever sci-fi melodrama, smartly recognizing that there are no heroes and few true villains at the end of the world—it's mostly just people doing whatever they can to survive. In a frozen future (2026, to be precise), humanity survives on an extremely long train that circumnavigates the globe. If it stops, the power will go out and everyone (literally everyone) will die. Those who came aboard with wealth live near the front in relative luxury, while the poor live on scraps (or worse) in the train's tail. Daveed Diggs stars as former detective Andre Layton, a \"Tailie\" deputized by Jennifer Connelly's Melanie Cavill, engineer and the train's Head of Hospitality, to solve a series of murders. The inevitable uprising that follows sets the two of them on different sides of a violent conflict, before each eventually realizes they're just pawns of elites—same as it ever was. Stream Snowpiercer on AMC+ or buy episodes from Prime Video.\n\nThis anime series makes clear that it definitely isn't 5G that we need to be worried about...it's 7G, an experimental cell network that warps reality and leaves Japan as a series of isolated settlements—it's also caused strange mutations, including turning people into animals, and creating mind-controlling mushrooms à la The Last of Us. Discovering evidence that one of her classmates is alive outside of Tokyo, Shizuru Chikura gets some friend together and they commandeer a train to carry them through the strange new wilderness. Stream Train to the End of the World on Crunchyroll or buy episodes from Prime Video.\n\nPredating Fallout by just about a year, The Last of Us started what remains an extremely exclusive club of video game adaptations that click, in this case even picking up a bunch of Emmys—Fallout maybe running a bit behind in terms of major awards, but has picked up nominations for Outstanding Drama and Lead Actor Emmys, which ain't too shabby. Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey star here, at least initially, as Joel and Ellie, travelers through an apocalyptic wasteland populated by zombified humans infected by a fungus. There's genuine suspense and expertly crafted horror in the show's zombie threat, but it's all built around the dynamic between Joel and Ellie, a beaten-down smuggler and the immune teenager he's being paid to deliver to the other side of the country. Their relationship sells the premise, and makes the stakes feel very real when the zombie mushroom people come out to bite. When the show upends that cart in season two, it's devastating. Stream The Last of Us on HBO Max.\n\nI suppose it says something about our uniquely fun era that you can turn on the TV and take your pick of future dystopias—here we visit a hyper-capitalist future in which everything's hunky-dory, as long as you mostly only care about money. A dark comedy based on the Hugo-Award winning book series by Martha Wells, the show stars Alexander Skarsgård is the title's hilariously deadpan robot, a private \"security construct\" who's managed to hack its way through its own programming and gain free will—which it mostly wants to use to watch its favorite streaming shows. It can't just run off for fear of drawing attention, but the self-named Murderbot (it's being ironic, kinda) is content to do the bare minimum when it's assigned to a team of inexperienced and naive hippie researchers who don't see the need for a killer security robot—at least, not until they're enmeshed in a complicated capitalist plot in which they're all just cogs. Stream Murderbot on Apple TV+.\n\nThe miniseries, based on the Emily St. John Mandel bestseller, was released at either the best time or the worst possible time, the story of a flu pandemic twenty years on hitting HBO square in the middle of COVID—and don't all of our current apocalypse dramas owe just a bit to that waking nightmare? The show follows two tracks, one introducing Kirsten Raymonde, a young stage actor whose performance in a production of King Lear is cut short by the onset of a virus with a 99% fatality rate. We also visit Kirsten twenty years on, still an actor, in a world very much changed. It’s a slow-burn, picking up steam only after a couple of episodes, but ultimately, the series makes a moving case for the power of art, even (or especially) in moments when survival is on the line. Stream Station Eleven on HBO Max.\n\nNo weird mutations here; instead we get an apocalypse that looks disturbingly normal. As the series begins, around 2% of the world's population disappears without explanation—it's enough to upend just about everything. Politics have adapted to the new normal, religions have collapsed and reformed, and families have had to make peace with the inexplicable loss of loved ones. The first season revolves around the Garvey family led by Kevin (Justin Theroux), a sheriff whose wife (Amy Brenneman) left him to join a cult, while subsequent seasons broaden the scope to bring in other characters in other locations. Showrunner Damon Lindelof also co-created Lost, and Leftovers inherits that show's relatively grim tone while doing it one better in sticking a landing. Stream The Leftovers on HBO Max.\n\nWe get a lot of Fallout-esque desert dystopias, but leave it to those melancholy Danes to center an apocalypse around precipitation. In this three-season import, a virus spread by rainfall that wipes out most of the population of Scandinavia. Siblings Simone and Rasmus emerge from their bunker six years later, setting off across Scandinavia with the hope of finding a safe haven, and maybe their father. It turns out that one of them holds the key to wiping out the virus and saving the world. It’s not the most original premise (The Last of Us game came out five years earlier), but the setting gives it a unique feel, and the series comes to a decisive ending. Stream The Rain on Netflix.\n\nOK, so maybe the end of days is feeling a little heavy at this point, and you're looking for something a little brighter and a lot more gay. I got you! New Queer Cinema pioneer Greg Araki followed up his neon-tinged apocalypse in Kaboom with Now Apocalypse, a successor in spirit. Avan Jogia plays Ulysses Zane, living in sun-soaked California with his best friend Carly (Kelli Berglund), a struggling actress and sex worker. He keeps having bizarre dreams about an alien invasion that feel increasingly like they might be premonitions...or possibly just anxiety delusions brought on by too much weed. The show only lasted one season, and never quite made it to its own prophesied apocalypse, but it was definitely fun while it lasted, and definitely offers something a bit to the left of the typical dreary end-of-the-world. Stream Now Apocalypse on Tubi.\n\nAt seven seasons, the CW’s YA The 100 is, currently, our most deeply explored TV apocalypse, telling the story of the descendants of refugees of nuclear devastation who return to Earth from their habitat in space—to encounter the remnants of humanity who’d survived on Earth. Naturally, the first people sent to scope things out are the juvenile delinquents (better them than me, honestly), and they discover that three civilizations that have risen up in the aftermath of the apocalypse, and they are all pretty darned scary (including the inevitable cannibals). The show builds an impressive mythology over the course of its run, leading to a conclusion that’s borderline metaphysical. Buy episodes of The 100 from Prime Video.",

    "fullText": "Fifa's failure to address concerns over access to tickets for disabled supporters at the 2026 World Cup is \"unacceptable\", a charity has said.\n\nDisabled fans face paying more to attend games as there are no tickets available to them in the lowest-priced tier of the general allocation.\n\nPersonal assistants have been told they will have to pay the full price of a ticket, rather than receive a free or concession rate. Fifa says it cannot guarantee that they will get a seat next to the disabled fan they have taken to the game.\n\nThere is also uncertainty over how many tickets will be made available to wheelchair users and the number of easy access spaces.\n\nLevel Playing Field says it \"raised serious and legitimate concerns\" with Fifa more than three weeks ago but has not received a response.\n\nIt has now written to national governing bodies and the secretary of state for culture, media and sport.\n\n\"This ongoing uncertainty over accessible ticketing is unacceptable,\" said Tony Taylor, the chair of Level Playing Field.\n\n\"The current situation appears to expect disabled fans to gamble on cost and access.\n\n\"Planning, personal assistants and pricing are vital considerations for disabled fans, as repeatedly shown in Level Playing Field Annual Fan Survey data.\n\n\"Restricting access to the lowest pricing tiers and charging for personal assistants, add unavoidable, additional, disability-related costs to attending.\n\n\"Instead of addressing the issue and communicating with supporters effectively, the current response has only been to delay and ignore.\"\n\nFifa has been approached for comment.\n\nWorld football's governing body has been heavily criticised for its high pricing structure at this summer's event in the United States, Mexico and Canada.\n\nIt eventually bowed to pressure by releasing a small number of \"more affordable\" $60 (£45) tickets to general fans for all 104 matches. But there has been no such flexibility for disabled fans.\n\nEngland supporters have not taken up their full general ticket allocation for the final and semi-final because of the cost.

    "fullText": "A significant chunk of Chinese copper demand has all but evaporated after the metal’s stunning surge to record levels.\n\nCopper on the London Metal Exchange burst through $13,000 a ton for the first time this week, extending its rally to nearly 50% over the past year. A cocktail of bullish factors could drive prices even higher over the short term. While real-world buyers typically take time to adjust to such sharp increases, what’s notable in this case is the extent to which industrial users in the biggest market are scaling back purchases.\n\nNYC Fights Sale of Bankrupt Rentals After Mamdani Blasts Living Conditions\n\nNew Design Plans Revealed for White House Ballroom\n\nWe Still Don’t Know if Robotaxis Are Safer Than Human Drivers\n\nNew LA Home Designs, Reimagined By Fire\n\nSlowing the Spread of Urban Fires Starts Right Outside the Home\n\n“It is surprising how much price rejection is taking place. The Chinese are just not buying copper, it’s true,” Kostas Bintas, head of metals at trading giant Mercuria Energy Group Ltd., said in an interview. “But it’s finite — at some point you need to buy.”\n\nSluggish physical demand contrasts with the speculative frenzy lifting futures markets, where deep-pocketed funds are responding to tighter global supply, favorable interest rates and an impulse to hedge geopolitical turmoil by stockpiling commodities. The copper contract in Shanghai, which accounts for import costs, topped 100,000 yuan a ton ($14,300) for the first time at the end of December.\n\nChinese industry, though, accounts for half of global copper demand. The fabricators that shape the metal — into wires, sheets and pipes for power cables, circuit boards and plumbing systems — are struggling to pass on their higher costs to factories. As inventories build, the smelters that refine copper in the first instance are trying to export their surplus.\n\nRecord copper prices “had a significant impact in December,” said Hai Jianxun, a sales executive at Henan Yuxing Copper Co. in central China, which makes pipes for items like air-conditioners. “The overall market was very quiet — much quieter than in previous years.”\n\nA Mysteel Global survey covering most suppliers showed that about 60% of the firms making copper rod for electricity transmission, a category that accounts for around half of China’s copper goods, cut or shut production over the month because of mounting costs.\n\nFees to process refined copper into rod fell to zero this week, Mysteel said, the lowest-ever level for the time of the year.\n\nThe subdued activity isn’t an anomaly. Even during the autumn, when demand typically peaks, operating rates across fabricators were at multiyear lows for the season. Ultimately, the market is paying the price of the economy’s lackluster recovery from the pandemic and structurally weaker growth.",

    "fullText": "Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nA stone seal found at the archaeological site of Tadım Fortress in Türkiye reveals how Neolithic people lived 7,500 years ago.\n\nThe seal is thought to possibly have identifying information to mark someone’s property, but alternatively, it could have also been used in agricultural trade.\n\nWhatever it was used for, this artifact is evidence of a civilization whose social structure was much more advanced than previously expected.\n\nWhile monolithic structures that have survived thousands of years may generate the most headlines, it is sometimes the smallest artifacts that can be portals into a civilization that was making social advances long before the Sphinx or the Parthenon towered over the ancient world.\n\nTadım Fortress has been revealing such relics of a surprisingly advanced Neolithic civilization in the Elazim region of eastern Türkiye. A 7,500-year-old stone seal recently unearthed at the site predates the kingdom of Urartu, which is already known for having had complex and organized social structures, but the seal reflects that they had already begun to take shape millennia before the rise of Urartu. Excavations that led to the discovery of the seal and other objects were overseen by the Elazig Museum and the Provincial Directorate of Culture and Tourism, with support from the Ministry of Culture and Tourism and the Elazig Governorship.\n\n“The findings show that the region was not only inhabited since the earliest times, but also developed sophisticated social, economic, and cultural practices that influenced later civilizations,” governor Numan Hatipoğlu told Türkiye Today.\n\nWhat exactly the seal was used for remains unknown, but archaeologists think it might have been a marker of property or ownership. It may have also signified personal identity. This is a rare example of relatively advanced social organization in such an early culture. Investigations as to what it reveals about Neolithic administration, daily life and social activity are ongoing. Archaeological studies in Elazig are part of the preservation efforts of the Turkish Ministry’s Heritage for the Future Project. It is the only stone seal found so far, but another seal locally known as ‘cec damga muhru’ was found to have been used in the trading of grain, reinforcing evidence of a structured society and economy.\n\nThis is not the first groundbreaking find at Tadım Fortress. While it is one of the oldest, buried beneath vessels and other objects left behind by the Byzantine, Roman, Seljuk and Ottoman empires, other artifacts and structures revealed how people lived slightly after the period when the seal was made. A temple that was also recently discovered at the site is now some of the oldest evidence of ritual architecture in the region. Dating to the Late Chalcolithic and Early Bronze Age, around 6,000 years ago, it features a stone altar with a ritual blood channel. Cut marks on the altar, along with animal and human remains, suggest blood sacrifice to appease deities. The temple shows that many aspects of life back then were closely tied to religion and ritual.\n\nNear the temple are the remnants of both ceremonial and everyday items, including tools and seal stamps that were likely used for agricultural trade, much like the one found along with the stone seal. There were also idol figurines on four podiums supposedly used for devotional offerings. Possibly the most striking is a hearth meant to keep a holy flame burning. Unique double-headed hearths carved with images of animals had previously been found at Tadım, with a jug beside them that is thought to have once held sacrificial blood or wine. Fire was sacred to many ancient cultures, such as the ancient Greeks and Romans, who associated it with Hestia (also Vesta), goddess of home and hearth.\n\nFindings including the stone seal are now undergoing analysis and preservation at the Elazig Archaeology and Ethnography Museum. Excavations in Tadım are ongoing, and the deeper archaeologists dig, the further back in time they will travel, with objects that have not seen the light of the sun in thousands and thousands of years potentially surfacing as a result.\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "description": "All in all it was a pretty miserable night, but there are obvious mitigating factors — this was simply a game too far for a squad that has been stretched beyond its limits by injury and international call-ups.",
    "fullText": "Every once in a while, even at our highest point arguably for decades, Sunderland AFC love to administer a well-timed punch in the gut just to keep everyone on our toes, and Wednesday night’s trip to Brentford was a textbook example.\n\nJust as the post-Christmas cobwebs were almost blown off, the fixture list threw up a second London away game in four days. I deliberated for some time whether to take any leave for this one, either to get to the pub early or to enjoy a post-game lie-in on Thursday, and in the end opted for neither, reasoning that a short trip to the other side of the capital is not a sensible use of paid holiday. At least my future self will be grateful for that, but the present version thinks the past one is a bastard.\n\nAnyway, I was at least able to steal out of the office earlier than usual having started early and headed post-haste to the Rose and Crown in Kew Green where the branch would be congregating. Some of the club’s media team were present to interview some of us about our experiences following the Lads from the capital and predictions for the game. You can have a read of our chairman Matthew’s thoughts here.\n\nShameless plug over, time to focus on the football. Brentford would inevitably present a tough proposition, having surged in December from lower mid-table to sit above us in the league on goal difference. Their in-form forward Igor Thiago clearly took it personally after I removed him from my fantasy league team, smashing in a hat-trick against Everton, but our defence has handled similarly dangerous strikers this season quite well, so we hoped we might manage to keep him quiet.\n\nThe Gtech Community Stadium is of course a new ground for Sunderland, so that on its own was enough of a reason to tempt so many to make the long journey south. It was a short walk from Kew Green across the river to the stadium; this really would be a lovely trip if it weren’t on a freezing midweek night in early January. The stewards wouldn’t have been out of place working in government security, going through everyone’s wallets with a fine-toothed comb, but thankfully we made it to our seats in time for kick-off.\n\nThe compact away end actually made for a great atmosphere – far better than at Spurs on Sunday – as chants from the fans were able to carry across and be picked up much more easily. Brentford played their incredibly unoriginal anthem to the tune of “Hey Jude”, and the Lads kicked off in blue and white attacking the far end. The opening exchanges were relatively even, but then Brentford began to turn the screw, and our defence was split apart far too easily as Thiago rounded Roefs to make it 1-0.\n\nWe made it in at half-time with just a single-goal deficit, and over a pint of London Pride we reasoned that a second-half improvement similar to what we produced at Spurs should see us claim at least a point.\n\nA golden opportunity to level was presented to us after Brobbey did brilliantly to win a penalty, but I was hesitant to celebrate too much given Brentford keeper Kelleher’s excellent record from the spot. In the end Le Fée’s ridiculous Panenka attempt could probably have been saved by anyone from the away end, even those who’d spent four hours on the train with a crate of Cruzcampo. It was a bizarre moment of idiocy from a brilliant player, and we can only hope he learns the requisite lessons from it.\n\nI would argue that it was the manner of the missed penalty rather than the miss itself that spurred Brentford on to such a degree and completely dashed the wind from our sails. The second goal was frankly embarrassing to watch as we were let out of jail initially when the ball hit the crossbar, only for our defence to fail to pick up Thiago again as he headed low into the corner. Brentford’s third was the kind of sloppy goal teams concede when their heads have completely dropped. We huffed and puffed, and a few of last season’s heroes in the shape of Neil and O’Nien were given a run-out, but the game was long since done as a contest.\n\nBack at the packed Express Tavern waiting for the Tube traffic to die down, we were given a brief morale boost as Leeds took the lead at St James’ Park, only for the Mags to overturn the deficit and climb above us in the table for the first time this season.\n\nAll in all it was a pretty miserable night, but there are obvious mitigating factors. This was simply a game too far for a squad that has been stretched beyond its limits by injury and international call-ups. The cup game at the weekend will likely be seen as a chance for mass rotation, and while it is a shame to essentially sacrifice our only slim chance at silverware for the season, it seems to be the only logical approach in the circumstances. This team has bounced back many times before, and with the imminent reinforcements from Africa incoming, you’d back them to do it again.",

    "description": "TikTok told some US staff that they will work for a new global entity that is not a part of the new joint venture run by Oracle and others.",
    "fullText": "TikTok is preparing to carve off parts of its US business, but not all US workers are joining the new entity.\n\nSome US staff were told this week that they will not work for the new joint venture, called TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC, led by managing investors Oracle, Silver Lake, and MGX. Instead, they will work for a separate TikTok global entity that will remain under ByteDance's ownership, called TT Commerce & Global Services LLC.\n\nThe change, outlined in a memo sent to impacted employees, includes workers who focus on US products that will remain tied to TikTok's global operations after the sale closes. In December, TikTok's CEO Shou Chew told staff those business lines would include \"certain commercial activities, including e-commerce, advertising, and marketing.\"\n\nOther US workers, such as those focused on data protection or algorithm security, would work under the USDS Joint Venture entity, according to Chew's memo. He said the deal would close on January 22.\n\nTikTok and ByteDance did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment about the staffing change.\n\nIf the proposed TikTok deal goes through, Oracle, MGX, and Silver Lake would each own 15% of the new US joint venture. Affiliates of existing ByteDance investors would get around 30%. Five percent would go to an unnamed group of new investors, and ByteDance would keep just under 20% of the business to comply with the ownership requirements of the US divestment law that sparked the sale.\n\nThe law, known as the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, requires companies based in countries the US has deemed a foreign adversary to divest from their US assets or face hefty fines.\n\nCongress called out TikTok and China-based ByteDance in the law's text. TikTok challenged the law in court but lost its case in a Supreme Court ruling last January.\n\nPresident Donald Trump allowed the app to continue to operate last year via a series of executive orders as his administration worked with TikTok and prospective buyers on a potential deal. In September, the White House announced a deal had been reached, which Vice President JD Vance said would value TikTok US at around $14 billion.",

    "description": "The president doubled down on his plans to take military action in Latin America, annex Greenland and more in a revealing new interview",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump said that his only guardrail as he looks to obtain more global power is \"my own morality\"\n\nIn a new interview with The New York Times, he said he doesn't \"need international law\" to dictate his approach to foreign policy\n\nAlso in the interview, the president doubled down on his plans to take military action in Latin America, annex Greenland and more\n\nPresident Donald Trump is making it clear that he won't be constrained by the law as he continues teasing a takeover of the Western Hemisphere.\n\n“I don’t need international law,” Trump said in a new interview with The New York Times. “I’m not looking to hurt people.”\n\nWhen pressed further, the president said he understood that his administration would need to abide by international laws. However, he added, \"It depends what your definition of international law is.\"\n\nThere is, Trump insisted, just \"one thing\" that can curtail his desire for global supremacy: \"My own morality. My own mind. It’s the only thing that can stop me.\"\n\nThe interview comes less than a week after U.S. forces, under Trump's direction, captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, first lady Cilia Flores, amid \"large-scale strikes\" on the capital city of Caracas, and brought them to the U.S. to stand trial on multiple charges related to narco terrorism.\n\nThough Venezuela has installed an interim leader, Delcy Rodríguez, Trump has stated many times that the United States is now in charge of running the independent nation.\n\n\"It's going to be run very judiciously, very fairly. And it's gonna make a lot of money,\" he previously said. \"You know they stole our oil. We built that whole industry and they just took it over like we were nothing. So we did something about it. We're late, but we did something about it.\"\n\nHe later added, \"We'll be selling large amounts of oil [from Venezuela] to other countries... We're going to get the oil flowing the way it should be.\"\n\n\"We're gonna make sure the people of Venezuela are taken care of... You're going to have peace, justice...you're going to have a real country.\"\n\nHe doesn't plan to stop there. The president is also fixated on his desire to annex Greenland, which is currently controlled by Denmark, a NATO ally of the U.S.\n\nTrump admitted that \"it may be a choice\" to preserve the country's relationship with NATO versus taking over Greenland, an important trade crossroads between the U.S., Europe, China and Russia.\n\n“It’s so strategic right now. Greenland is covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place,” he said to reporters aboard Air Force One on Jan. 4. “We need Greenland from the standpoint of national security, and Denmark is not going to be able to do it.”\n\nTo The New York Times, he insisted that it wasn't enough to have the country controlled by an ally — he wants exclusive, outright ownership.\n\n“Because that’s what I feel is psychologically needed for success. I think that ownership gives you a thing that you can’t do with, you’re talking about a lease or a treaty. Ownership gives you things and elements that you can’t get from just signing a document,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump also has his sights set on Colombia, Cuba, Iran and Mexico.\n\n\"You have to do something with Mexico. Mexico has to get their act together because they're pouring through Mexico and we're going to have to do something,\" he previously told reporters, referring to drug cartels in the country.\n\n\"We'd love Mexico to do it. They're capable of doing it, but unfortunately, the cartels are very strong in Mexico,\" Trump added.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nReferring to Colombian President Gustavo Petro, Trump said his country is being \"run by a sick man who likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States, and he’s not going to be doing it very long.\"\n\nPetro spoke with the Times prior to calling Trump to discuss the threats, expressing his concern about the U.S. making a strike in Colombia, similar to the one in Venezuela.\n\n“We are in danger,” the Colombian president said. “Because the threat is real. It was made by Trump.”",

The massive event is held across various locations, including the Las Vegas Convention Center, The Venetian, Mandalay Bay, and The Sphere, and is a staple event for both companies vying for recognition and media outlets that cover them. One day into \"Unveiled,\" the media-only prelude to the trade show, I landed on what might be my mantra for my CES 2026 experience.\n\n\"Cool, if true,\" Associate Tech Editor Michelle Ehrhardt had said about a new product booth, summarizing how I felt about the conference as a whole. Since arriving in Las Vegas on Saturday as a skeptical first-time attendee, I have seen cancer-detecting scanners, smart irrigation systems, and more assistive robots than I can count. I have also rolled my eyes at tech-enabled shoe insoles, smart-companion teddy bears, and AI-powered dog leashes. But I have also seen more grounded tech that lives just at the edge of where science fiction and practicality meet: walk-assisting exoskeletons, smart helmets with fall detection and one-touch SOS commands, and assistive mobility tech that can convert any standard wheelchair into an electric one. In short, CES is both chock-full of BS and a glimpse into the future of clever, helpful, and groundbreaking tech.\n\nTech Editor Jake Peterson, Senior Health Editor Beth Skwarecki, Associate Tech Editor Michelle Ehrhardt, and I will be on the ground at CES throughout the week, covering the biggest, coolest, and weirdest tech we can find. We'll also join CNET, PCMag, and others in awarding the Best of CES 2026 awards for a second year in a row. Follow us here and on social media to see what it's like to be at the world's biggest technology trade show, and share with us your thoughts, questions, and what you'd like to see. There's a lot more cool tech to come. If true, of course.\n\n-Jordan Calhoun, Editor in Chief",

    "fullText": "The Ashes series is over and, once again, it finishes with Australia holding the urn.\n\nEngland did avoid a clean sweep with victory in Melbourne but Australia reasserted their dominance in Sydney this week.\n\nHere we hand out player ratings for the whole series.\n\nZak Crawley – 5 – Averaged 27, which was entirely predictable at the beginning of the series. Did not live up to the billing of a man backed for Australia and should not be guaranteed a place for the home summer.\n\nBen Duckett – 3 – Arrived with a reputation as one of the best all-format batters in the world, leaves with career at a crossroads. Did not pass 50, dropped catches and was caught on video in Noosa. Now goes to England's white-ball tours and the Indian Premier League, when a break might be the smart option.\n\nJacob Bethell – 7 – Where has he been? How different might England's tour have turned out had they backed Bethell sooner? Only two Tests, but a vital 40 in Melbourne was followed by a coming-of-age 154 in Sydney. England's new number three.\n\nJoe Root – 7 – Finally ticked off the Test century in Australia and got another in Sydney, but not much else. Still England's best batter at 35 and wants to come back in four years. Where would they be without him?\n\nHarry Brook – 5 – Should have been the series when he announced himself as a Test mega-star and instead was one of too many frustrating dismissals. Has a lot on his plate as white-ball captain - is that hindering his development as a Test batter?\n\nBen Stokes – 6 – Another England captain to be beaten down under and will not get another chance to win a series here. England's best bowler, below his best with the bat and a poor series tactically. Gets an extra mark for shouldering the burden of the many team-mates that let him down.\n\nJamie Smith – 3 – Like Duckett, arrived as an England banker and leaves with his international future in doubt. Mistakes with the gloves and too many soft dismissals - his shot in Sydney encapsulated England's bone-headed tour. Dropped from the white-ball teams, is a Test axe next?\n\nWill Jacks – 5 – Did what he was asked to do, which was bowl some part-time off-spin and bat at eight - it is just that no-one expected him to do it in four Tests. Would be unfair to judge on a role Jacks isn't really qualified for. When might he play another Test?\n\nBrydon Carse – 6 – A total of 22 wickets for a fast bowler has been bettered only by James Anderson and Ian Botham on England Ashes tours in the past 55 years. The numbers don't quite tell the story of how often he sprayed the ball. Having the durability to play all five Tests says plenty about his character.\n\nMatthew Potts – 1 – Probably harsh, given the hand he was dealt. His sole appearance in Sydney was tough to watch. Mistreated by England - in and out, ignored for a year, then dropped into an Ashes Test. Will surely slip further down the pecking order.\n\nJosh Tongue – 7 – Didn't play until the third Test, then managed to pick up 18 wickets. One of the few England players to leave Australia with his reputation enhanced and should be in the first-choice attack come the summer.\n\nMark Wood – 2 – A Herculean effort to get fit, only for his series to end after bowling 11 overs in the first Test. Will he play for England again?\n\nJofra Archer – 6 – Bowled better than a total of nine wickets would suggest and at times was among England's best batters. Injured after three matches as a reminder (if it was needed) he will need constant managing through the remainder of his Test career.\n\nOllie Pope – 3 – Started with promise, then predictably faded to be rightly dropped after three Tests. Did not repay faith shown in him and should have to work very hard for another chance.\n\nGus Atkinson – 3 – One of the many who wilted in the first two Tests, then hinted at something near his best in the fourth, only to get injured. No longer a guaranteed part of England's first-choice attack.\n\nShoaib Bashir – 0 – Was earmarked for this tour in an experiment of building a spinner from raw materials, then could not get a game in any of the five Tests.\n\n'Whoever signed off England's tour has to go' - Agnew column\n\nThe Ashes: Australia beat England in final Test - clips and reaction\n\nJake Weatherald – 4 – Started well with vital cameos in the first two Tests, only to be found out later in the series. An Ashes winner, but possibly not Australia's long-term opener.\n\nTravis Head – 10 – The best three-format batter in the world and a likeable superstar. His elevation to opener altered the course of the series and three hundreds mean the spot is his to keep. This was the Travball Ashes.\n\nMarnus Labuschagne - 5 - Yet to score the runs that fully justify his recall at number three. Gets an extra mark for his catching - he took three stunners. Unclear whether his bowling deserves praise or eradicating from cricket history.\n\nSteve Smith – 7 – Was below his best with the bat until a predictable century in Sydney. Stood-in as captain for Pat Cummins in four Tests, which means he did not have Cummins the bowler at his disposal, yet still engineered an Ashes triumph.\n\nUsman Khawaja – 5 – A strange culmination to his career. Khawaja's Ashes will be remembered for the batting he did not do in Perth, rather than the innings he played everywhere else.\n\nAlex Carey – 9 – One of the greatest exhibitions of glovework ever seen in a Test series and handy runs at number six, including a hometown century in Adelaide. Admitted to not walking in the same knock, setting the wheels in motion for the Snicko revelation. Hit winning runs in Sydney to seal 4-1 series win.\n\nCameron Green – 4 – Losing his way after being earmarked as the future face of the Australian team. Injuries are limiting his bowling and a lack of runs have him slipping down the order - possibly to number 12.\n\nBeau Webster – 5 – When he finally got his chance he made the runs that should put pressure on Green's place, then proved how versatile he is with his off-breaks.\n\nMichael Neser – 7 – Out of Test cricket for three years then recalled as injury cover and a pink-ball specialist. Did a fine job as the sort of medium-fast bowler England have shown disdain for.\n\nMitchell Starc – 10 – This series was essentially decided in the first two Tests and Starc was the primary reason Australia won both. Faded slightly towards the end, but at his best gave off Mitchell Johnson 2013-14 vibes - there can be no higher praise.\n\nScott Boland – 7 – Not quite the heights of his debut series four years ago, though did more than enough to banish the demons of a tough 2023 Ashes in England.\n\nBrendan Doggett – 4 – Covered for injuries in the first two Tests and claimed a respectable seven wickets. May never add to his two Test caps, yet is an Ashes winner with a 100% record.\n\nPat Cummins – 6 – Astonishing effort to have played even one Test, given the severity of his back injury. In his sole appearance in Adelaide, Cummins bowled magnificently and was the captain that sealed the Ashes. Will now plot the bid for a holy grail win in 2027.\n\nNathan Lyon – 4 – Was making an impact in Adelaide before being struck by another injury. Will want to be part of 2027 Ashes, but surely there will be questions over his fitness and the role of spin in England.\n\nJosh Inglis – 3 – Australia won the two Tests he played, even if he did not take his chance. May get another opportunity as a result of Khawaja's retirement, or could fall down the pecking order.\n\nJhye Richardson – 2 – Like Wood, deserves huge credit for coming back from injuries to play Test cricket, albeit for one match and 9.2 overs. Should get another chance.\n\nBest player, moment & back spasm - our Ashes awards\n\nWho made your Ashes team of the series?\n\nEngland beaten to give Australia 4-1 Ashes win",

What he did, the nights he had… he inspired us.\"\n\nManchester's Hatton was one of a select group of British fighters to have captured the boxing public's imagination in America, packing arenas in Las Vegas with his loyal following.\n\nSmith still has a long way to go before coming close to what Hatton achieved, but he has won all 18 of his professional bouts.\n\nHe now faces his toughest assignment to date - the heavy-handed Matias boasts 22 stoppages in 23 victories, alongside two defeats.\n\n\"I'm not here to make up the numbers,\" Smith added. \"I'm here to achieve a childhood dream and to win the best belt in boxing.\"",

    "fullText": "Red Sox predicted to sign $150M World Series Champion, Gold Glove winner after Rafael Devers fiasco originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Boston Red Sox signed Alex Bregman last offseason, but the deal included opt-outs. After the conclusion of the 2025 season, it became clear that Bregman would hit the free-agent market after just one season in Boston.\n\n“Alex Bregman plans to opt out of his contract with the Boston Red Sox, a source told ESPN on Tuesday night, confirming a New York Post report. The move was expected and doesn't rule out the veteran third baseman returning to Boston, but for now, he will be part of the free agent class for a second straight offseason,” ESPN reported.\n\nThe Red Sox are optimistic about their chances of bringing Bregman back, but the Philadelphia Phillies could also be in the mix.\n\n“If the Phillies were to move Bohm, in my judgment, it would have to be because they think there's a chance of getting a Bregman or they're one of the teams potentially that could look at a Bo Bichette at a spot that's not shortstop,\" MLB insider Jon Morosi said. \"There's different ways they could augment their club, but you would have to have a clear upgrade on Bohm if you're gonna go ahead and make that trade.\"\n\nSports Illustrated’s Will Laws believes the Red Sox will ultimately get the job done and re-sign Bregman.\n\n“Bregman opted out of his contract just one year into his three-year, $120 million deal in Boston. A quad injury cost him about a month-and-a-half in the middle of the year, but he was otherwise productive at the plate after a relatively down 2024 campaign. Bregman’s approach is sound, with minimal swing-and-miss and a good command of the strike zone, and his defense remains at least solid at the hot corner, so it seems likely he’ll get four- or five-year offers from teams this time around. Bregman assumed a leadership role last year with the Red Sox, who appear motivated to sign a star infielder,” Laws wrote.\n\nThe Red Sox would love to have Bregman back, particularly for the experience and leadership he provides. Boston made the playoffs last year and believes it can repeat that success.\n\nBringing Bregman back would also generate excitement around the city. With Spring Training just a month away, expect the Red Sox to move quickly to work out a deal.",

In every transfer window, billions are now being exchanged between clubs around the world.\n\nThis is unlikely to change in the foreseeable future. The football portal 'CIES Football' has calculated, based on several factors, how much the most valuable stars in the world are currently worth when considering age, contract duration, etc.\n\n📷 Screenshot from CIES Football\n\nAccording to the football portal, Lamine Yamal tops the list with a market value of a whopping 343 million euros, followed by the usual suspects like Haaland, Mbappé, and Bellingham. In fifth place is Michael Olise, the highest Bundesliga star.\n\nWhile Florian Wirtz is considered the most valuable German player according to 'CIES Football', Nick Woltemade, after a strong first half of the season, is also high up in the rankings.\n\nNow it's your turn: Were you surprised by the calculated market values?

    "description": "Can Italy make it happen?",
    "fullText": "It’s early January in Boston. Every day, or so it seems, there is the dreaded wintery of sleet/snow/rain/ice and of course wind. But over the next month there will be more and more stories about guys “in the best shape of his life” and heading to Florida for Spring Training. And as soon as those stories finish we’ll be looking at high-level baseball sooner than you think: the World Baseball Classic runs from March 5th to 17th. Representing teams across the globe, the Red Sox will be represented. According to Chris Cotillo these are the likely participants, although there is some flux.\n\nAroldis Chapman has been included on Great Britain’s preliminary roster but does not appear to be a final candidate yet according to the MLB players listed. Neither do Rafaela, Abreu, or Morán seem to be included on that list. But there are players being announced as additions every day so this may still change.\n\nBut one player has me more interested than other: Roman Anthony.\n\nLast week on the Foul Territory show at about 1:43:16, Kansas City Royals first baseman Vinnie Pasquantino and member of Team Italy admitted to having something of a white whale in recruiting for the WBC: Roman Anthony.\n\nAnd why wouldn’t he? Anthony was only worth 3.1 bWAR in 71 games in 2025 while basically posting the dream .300/.400/.500 slash line of .292/.396/.463. Pasquantino’s entire career, 424 games over 4 years with some injuries, has been 4.9 bWAR. Granted 2025 is 2.4 of that over a span of 160 games so he’s no slouch himself. But Anthony is his prize.\n\nYes, Roman, from Florida, can play for Team USA. But why would you want to?\n\nYou know who doesn’t have an endless supply of guys? Especially high-end outfielders? Italy!\n\nThe average of the projections currently on FanGraphs predict a slash line of .263/.358/.437 with around 20 home runs this year. And about a 3.0 WAR season. Projection systems, of course, feed on prior data which at the major league level Anthony just doesn’t have much of but even if you think that’s his max for a sophomore season guaranteed a starting job and signed for most of the next decade that’s looking pretty good!\n\nWhich, if this is his floor, is all the more reason for Vinnie and Team Italy to make their move now. He literally might not be available for the next WBC because if he looks as good as he did over the summer of 2025, MLB and whoever succeeds Rob Manfred isn’t going to want that guy playing for Italy. They’re fine with lower tier players (Sorry Pasquach) representing an ancestral homeland but not superstars.\n\nIf there is ever a time for Italy to scoop him up it’s now. 2026. Just imagine the face of Team Italy: Roman Anthony.\n\nNow if they can only do something about that hat design…",

    "fullText": "Kim Farrell, TikTok's global head of creators, is leaving the company, Business Insider has learned.\n\nFarrell joined TikTok nearly six years ago, starting on the company's Latin America marketing team before shifting to its operations division and later taking over as global creator lead in late 2023. In December, she helped organize TikTok's first awards show for creators at the Hollywood Palladium theater in Los Angeles. Prior to TikTok, Farrell worked in marketing at Booking.com and Google.\n\nHer departure was announced internally on Wednesday, as the company informed staff that it was reorganizing its content division, which includes employees who work with creators, publishers, and other content partners. As part of the reorg, the company is merging its creator and publisher teams into one and letting go of 20 US staffers and some other roles globally. Business Insider was unable to learn the full count of global job cuts.\n\n\"We are realigning our global content operations team as we continue to accelerate the growth of high-quality content and key content verticals,\" a TikTok spokesperson told Business Insider.\n\nMedia publisher Status earlier reported on the layoffs.\n\nFarrell's exit follows a string of executive shake-ups and reorgs across TikTok over the past year and a half.\n\nTikTok Shop US operations lead Nico Le Bourgeois left the company in May. Blake Chandlee, TikTok's advertising leader, stepped down in March as part of a reorg that put the sales team under the oversight of its global monetization product technology division. TikTok's global head of marketing, Kate Jhaveri, left the company in September 2024. Some of the company's reorgs have shifted power away from local leaders toward executives based in China or Singapore, Business Insider previously reported.\n\nTikTok's content team reorg comes at a moment of flux for the video platform.\n\nCEO Shou Chew told workers in December that it plans to spin off parts of its US business in a joint venture with an investor group that includes tech company Oracle and investment firms Silver Lake and MGX. The new entity will have oversight over some aspects of the business like data security, but key business lines like e-commerce and advertising will remain under TikTok's global owner, ByteDance, according to Chew's memo. The US product is supposed to remain interoperable with the rest of the world.\n\nThe deal is expected to close later this month, Chew said in the memo.",

    "fullText": "What does Hotty Toddy mean at Ole Miss? Explaining the World War I origin of famous chant originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nOle Miss football games are soundtracked by a familiar refrain.\n\nBetween touchdowns, canons and cheers exists a six-line sonnet that has proven especially memorable in Oxford, Miss.\n\nHotty Toddy has been a steady part of the Rebels' game day routine for the better part of a century. The chant is a rhythmic one, filled with whimsy, intensity and camaraderie like few other war cries in the nation.\n\nSo, just what does Hotty Toddy mean? The Sporting News gives you the inside scoop on all things related to Ole Miss' signature phrase.\n\nMORE: How Trinidad Chambliss went from Ferris State to Ole Miss stardom\n\nDubbed the \"unified holler of Ole Miss fans\" by the Magnolia Tribune in 2024, Hotty Toddy is the Rebels' beloved rallying cry. Its origins are mysterious, having first been published in Ole Miss student newspaper The Mississippian (now known as The Daily Mississippian) in 1926.\n\nIt's something of a mating call amongst Rebels enthusiasts, a classic call-and-response chant that exists in a similar space to other famed slogans like Mississippi State's \"Hail State\" and Alabama's \"Rammer Jammer.\" The chant itself is always preceded by a simple query: \"Are You Ready?!\"\n\nMORE: Lane Kiffin's timeline of teams coached and career record\n\nThe ensuing dialogue flows like honey, each word growing more memorable than the last.\n\nThe Hotty Toddy lyrics are as follows:\n\nHotty Toddy is undoubtedly a full-body experience. It grasps at three different senses at once. Those who deliver the chant don't merely see and hear it. They feel the rhythm, too, courtesy of a hand gesture. Most fans who utter the phrase do so while pulling off the landshark or \"Fins Up\", a simple signal which sees users point their hand sideways and bring it up to their head to mimic a shark's fin underneath waves.\n\nThe gesture began in 2008 when then-linebacker threw it up after corralling then-Rebels quarterback Jevan Snead multiple times during a summer practice.\n\nMORE: Where is Trinidad Chambliss from?\n\n\"Fins Up\" was born, a tradition that has paired harmoniously with the Hotty Toddy chant over the years.\n\nIt's unclear why the Rebels have grown so fond of Hotty Toddy. Its meaning is muddled, with different Ole Miss supporters delivering different definitions of the term.\n\nSome think it's a play on the phrase hoity-toity, perhaps a reference to the high-brow nature of tailgating typically present at Vaught Hemingway Stadium, the Rebels' home ground.\n\nMORE:How Ole Miss-Mississippi State rivalry got Egg Bowl name\n\nThere's also the case of the Hot Toddy, a tea-like cocktail that tends to feature hot water, lemon, honey and your choice of dark liquor. Some believe the chant is a nod to the famous spirit. It's quite possible that Rebels enthusiasts delivering the phrase do so as liquid courage seeps into their bellies.\n\nThere is some evidence that the phrase is derived from World War I-era banter. Still, all roads to the tagline's origins are shrouded in dust and fog. One thing is for certain, though: Ole Miss students have no interest in retiring the chant any time soon.\n\nAs previously mentioned, the first published use of Hotty Toddy took place in the mid-1920s. It is likely that the phrase was around for some time before then.\n\nMORE:11 most expensive coach buyouts in college football history\n\nThe cheer was initially known as \"Heighty Tighty\", with its lyrics slightly altered compared to its present-day version. Here's a look at the chant in its initial form, per Magnolia Tribune.\n\nHell, yeah! Damn right! \nHeighty Tighty, Gosh Almighty,\nWho The Hell Are We? Hey!\nFlim Flam, Bim Bam\nOle Miss By Damn!\n\nThe hot toddy is not believed to be related to the Ole Miss chant. However, the warm alcoholic beverage is a favorite of fans at The Grove and figures to feature prominently in the fanbase's pregame rituals, particularly when temperatures drop.",

    "description": "Bob Sternfels, global managing partner at McKinsey, identified three human skills that he said the AI models can't do.",
    "fullText": "Artificial intelligence is reshaping McKinsey's workforce, but the firm's top executive said there are still fundamental human skills that AI models can't do.\n\nBob Sternfels, global managing partner at McKinsey, talked about how AI is changing work at the firm during an appearance at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas on Tuesday.\n\nSternfels said that last year alone, embracing AI saved McKinsey 1.5 million hours in search and synthesis, work that he says AI models are great for. He also said AI agents, of which McKinsey has 25,000, excel at generating charts and that they've made 2.5 million of them in the past six months.\n\nWith agents taking over some of that work, he said consultants are now \"moving up the stack\" and tackling \"more complicated problems.\"\n\nGiven those changes, Sternfels said McKinsey looked at which skills new graduates will need in an AI-infused world from the perspective of large employers. He identified three: the ability to aspire, judgment, and true creativity.\n\n\"What can the models not do? Aspire. Set the right aspiration,\" he said. \"Do you go to low Earth orbit? Do you go to the moon? Do you go to Mars? That's a uniquely human capability.\"\n\nSternfels said you should look to build skills around aspiring and getting others to believe in those aspirations.\n\n\"There's no right and wrong in these models, and so how do you set the right parameters?\" he said, adding humans can build the skills to set the architecture based on factors like firm values and societal norms.\n\n\"The models are inference models — the next most likely step,\" Sternfels said.\n\nHumans, on the other hand, have an edge when it comes to \"orthogonal\" work, or the ability to think outside existing patterns and land on an entirely new approach.\n\nSternfels said AI adoption is also changing how companies look for talent, adding that where someone went to school should matter a lot less.\n\nFor someone with a tech background, he said, instead of looking at where they graduated from, prospective employers should look at their GitHub, a site engineers use to showcase their work.\n\n\"Let's actually get to the content,\" he said, \"and could that actually start meaning that a wider set of people can enter the workforce with different pathways?\"",

    "description": "Find out who got a 10 and who is facing an uncertain international future with our Ashes player ratings.",
    "fullText": "The Ashes series is over and, once again, it finishes with Australia holding the urn.\n\nEngland did avoid a clean sweep with victory in Melbourne but Australia reasserted their dominance in Sydney this week.\n\nHere we hand out player ratings for the whole series.\n\nZak Crawley – 5 – Averaged 27, which was entirely predictable at the beginning of the series. Did not live up to the billing of a man backed for Australia and should not be guaranteed a place for the home summer.\n\nBen Duckett – 3 – Arrived with a reputation as one of the best all-format batters in the world, leaves with career at a crossroads. Did not pass 50, dropped catches and was caught on video in Noosa. Now goes to England's white-ball tours and the Indian Premier League, when a break might be the smart option.\n\nJacob Bethell – 7 – Where has he been? How different might England's tour have turned out had they backed Bethell sooner? Only two Tests, but a vital 40 in Melbourne was followed by a coming-of-age 154 in Sydney. England's new number three.\n\nJoe Root – 7 – Finally ticked off the Test century in Australia and got another in Sydney, but not much else. Still England's best batter at 35 and wants to come back in four years. Where would they be without him?\n\nHarry Brook – 5 – Should have been the series when he announced himself as a Test mega-star and instead was one of too many frustrating dismissals. Has a lot on his plate as white-ball captain - is that hindering his development as a Test batter?\n\nBen Stokes – 6 – Another England captain to be beaten down under and will not get another chance to win a series here. England's best bowler, below his best with the bat and a poor series tactically. Gets an extra mark for shouldering the burden of the many team-mates that let him down.\n\nJamie Smith – 3 – Like Duckett, arrived as an England banker and leaves with his international future in doubt. Mistakes with the gloves and too many soft dismissals - his shot in Sydney encapsulated England's bone-headed tour. Dropped from the white-ball teams, is a Test axe next?\n\nWill Jacks – 5 – Did what he was asked to do, which was bowl some part-time off-spin and bat at eight - it is just that no-one expected him to do it in four Tests. Would be unfair to judge on a role Jacks isn't really qualified for. When might he play another Test?\n\nBrydon Carse – 6 – A total of 22 wickets for a fast bowler has been bettered only by James Anderson and Ian Botham on England Ashes tours in the past 55 years. The numbers don't quite tell the story of how often he sprayed the ball. Having the durability to play all five Tests says plenty about his character.\n\nMatthew Potts – 1 – Probably harsh, given the hand he was dealt. His sole appearance in Sydney was tough to watch. Mistreated by England - in and out, ignored for a year, then dropped into an Ashes Test. Will surely slip further down the pecking order.\n\nJosh Tongue – 7 – Didn't play until the third Test, then managed to pick up 18 wickets. One of the few England players to leave Australia with his reputation enhanced and should be in the first-choice attack come the summer.\n\nMark Wood – 2 – A Herculean effort to get fit, only for his series to end after bowling 11 overs in the first Test. Will he play for England again?\n\nJofra Archer – 6 – Bowled better than a total of nine wickets would suggest and at times was among England's best batters. Injured after three matches as a reminder (if it was needed) he will need constant managing through the remainder of his Test career.\n\nOllie Pope – 3 – Started with promise, then predictably faded to be rightly dropped after three Tests. Did not repay faith shown in him and should have to work very hard for another chance.\n\nGus Atkinson – 3 – One of the many who wilted in the first two Tests, then hinted at something near his best in the fourth, only to get injured. No longer a guaranteed part of England's first-choice attack.\n\nShoaib Bashir – 0 – Was earmarked for this tour in an experiment of building a spinner from raw materials, then could not get a game in any of the five Tests.\n\n'Whoever signed off England's tour has to go' - Agnew column\n\nThe Ashes: Australia beat England in final Test - clips and reaction\n\nJake Weatherald – 4 – Started well with vital cameos in the first two Tests, only to be found out later in the series. An Ashes winner, but possibly not Australia's long-term opener.\n\nTravis Head – 10 – The best three-format batter in the world and a likeable superstar. His elevation to opener altered the course of the series and three hundreds mean the spot is his to keep. This was the Travball Ashes.\n\nMarnus Labuschagne - 5 - Yet to score the runs that fully justify his recall at number three. Gets an extra mark for his catching - he took three stunners. Unclear whether his bowling deserves praise or eradicating from cricket history.\n\nSteve Smith – 7 – Was below his best with the bat until a predictable century in Sydney. Stood-in as captain for Pat Cummins in four Tests, which means he did not have Cummins the bowler at his disposal, yet still engineered an Ashes triumph.\n\nUsman Khawaja – 5 – A strange culmination to his career. Khawaja's Ashes will be remembered for the batting he did not do in Perth, rather than the innings he played everywhere else.\n\nAlex Carey – 9 – One of the greatest exhibitions of glovework ever seen in a Test series and handy runs at number six, including a hometown century in Adelaide. Admitted to not walking in the same knock, setting the wheels in motion for the Snicko revelation. Hit winning runs in Sydney to seal 4-1 series win.\n\nCameron Green – 4 – Losing his way after being earmarked as the future face of the Australian team. Injuries are limiting his bowling and a lack of runs have him slipping down the order - possibly to number 12.\n\nBeau Webster – 5 – When he finally got his chance he made the runs that should put pressure on Green's place, then proved how versatile he is with his off-breaks.\n\nMichael Neser – 7 – Out of Test cricket for three years then recalled as injury cover and a pink-ball specialist. Did a fine job as the sort of medium-fast bowler England have shown disdain for.\n\nMitchell Starc – 10 – This series was essentially decided in the first two Tests and Starc was the primary reason Australia won both. Faded slightly towards the end, but at his best gave off Mitchell Johnson 2013-14 vibes - there can be no higher praise.\n\nScott Boland – 7 – Not quite the heights of his debut series four years ago, though did more than enough to banish the demons of a tough 2023 Ashes in England.\n\nBrendan Doggett – 4 – Covered for injuries in the first two Tests and claimed a respectable seven wickets. May never add to his two Test caps, yet is an Ashes winner with a 100% record.\n\nPat Cummins – 6 – Astonishing effort to have played even one Test, given the severity of his back injury. In his sole appearance in Adelaide, Cummins bowled magnificently and was the captain that sealed the Ashes. Will now plot the bid for a holy grail win in 2027.\n\nNathan Lyon – 4 – Was making an impact in Adelaide before being struck by another injury. Will want to be part of 2027 Ashes, but surely there will be questions over his fitness and the role of spin in England.\n\nJosh Inglis – 3 – Australia won the two Tests he played, even if he did not take his chance. May get another opportunity as a result of Khawaja's retirement, or could fall down the pecking order.\n\nJhye Richardson – 2 – Like Wood, deserves huge credit for coming back from injuries to play Test cricket, albeit for one match and 9.2 overs.

    "description": "If true, the claim could significantly reshape the global bitcoin market.",
    "fullText": "When Bitcoin first launched in 2009, many investors dismissed the currency as a fringe concept and even as a scam. (Charlie Munger, Warren Buffett’s former right-hand man at Berkshire Hathaway, memorably called it “stupid and evil.”) But the asset has skyrocketed in value in recent years and President Donald Trump labeled the currency “digital gold” after signing an executive order to create a strategic bitcoin reserve last January. Now, reports allege that Venezuela has bought into that “digital gold,” holding a “shadow reserve” nearly double that of the U.S.\n\nDigital publication Project Brazen reported Saturday that Venezuela could hold an estimated $60 billion worth of Bitcoin. Additional intelligence reports allege that ousted Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his associates accrued Bitcoin via three channels: a gold swap overseen by Venezuelan Interior Minister Alex Saab in 2018, oil revenue priced in Bitcoin, and by seizing crypto mining equipment from miners in the country.\n\nSanctions have walled off the country’s access to financial markets for years, and experts allege that they may have motivated Venezuelan leaders to invest in cryptocurrencies to sidestep the barrier.\n\nBitcointreasuries.net puts Venezuela’s holdings at 240 bitcoin, worth nearly $22 million. The website sourced the data from a 2022 Forbes article that cited research from a blockchain analytics firm. The total is a far cry from the estimated U.S. holdings of 328,372, currently worth $30 billion, though the claim positions Venezuela’s holdings at nearly double the U.S. and one of the biggest holders of bitcoin globally.\n\nThe claims of Venezuela’s shadow Bitcoin holdings have predictably garnered skeptics, including digital asset financial services company Ledn Co-founder Mauricio di Bartolomeo, who grew up in Venezuela and whose family has mined crypto there since 2014.\n\nDi Bartolomeo finds no credibility in any of the three alleged sources of bitcoin income: the gold swap, oil exchange or mining equipment seizures. “This to me does not align with anything in the public record,” di Bartolomeo told Fortune. “There’s so much corruption, embezzlement and missing money that I don’t believe that any meaningful amount would have accrued.”\n\nHe outlined his full argument in a Coindesk op-ed piece titled “Don’t hold your breath for Venezuela’s bitcoin.” Though he notes that his family’s crypto mining materials were seized by the government in 2018 and returned five years later in a worn down condition, signaling heavy use of the equipment.",

    "fullText": "The Consumer Electronics Show (CES) is often referred to as \"the most powerful tech event in the world,\" bringing together tech companies from around the globe to unveil their latest innovations. The massive event is held across various locations, including the Las Vegas Convention Center, The Venetian, Mandalay Bay, and The Sphere, and is a staple event for both companies vying for recognition and media outlets that cover them. One day into \"Unveiled,\" the media-only prelude to the trade show, I landed on what might be my mantra for my CES 2026 experience.\n\n\"Cool, if true,\" Associate Tech Editor Michelle Ehrhardt had said about a new product booth, summarizing how I felt about the conference as a whole. Since arriving in Las Vegas on Saturday as a skeptical first-time attendee, I have seen cancer-detecting scanners, smart irrigation systems, and more assistive robots than I can count. I have also rolled my eyes at tech-enabled shoe insoles, smart-companion teddy bears, and AI-powered dog leashes. But I have also seen more grounded tech that lives just at the edge of where science fiction and practicality meet: walk-assisting exoskeletons, smart helmets with fall detection and one-touch SOS commands, and assistive mobility tech that can convert any standard wheelchair into an electric one. In short, CES is both chock-full of BS and a glimpse into the future of clever, helpful, and groundbreaking tech.\n\nTech Editor Jake Peterson, Senior Health Editor Beth Skwarecki, Associate Tech Editor Michelle Ehrhardt, and I will be on the ground at CES throughout the week, covering the biggest, coolest, and weirdest tech we can find. We'll also join CNET, PCMag, and others in awarding the Best of CES 2026 awards for a second year in a row. Follow us here and on social media to see what it's like to be at the world's biggest technology trade show, and share with us your thoughts, questions, and what you'd like to see. There's a lot more cool tech to come. If true, of course.\n\n-Jordan Calhoun, Editor in Chief",

    "title": "Newest Nuclear Sub Arrives For The US Navy With A Historic WW2 Namesake",
    "description": "The U.S. Navy has some of the most advanced nuclear submarines in the world. Its newest addition is named after an important World War II ship.",
    "fullText": "The United States Navy has the largest fleet of nuclear submarines on the planet, and it just added a new one to the inventory. This new fifth generation submarine is an incredible machine, and it was named in honor of one of World War II's biggest and best vessels. On December 15, 2025, the U.S. Navy took ownership of the USS Idaho (SSN-799). The ship was named to carry on the honor of the battleship USS Idaho (BB-42), which was first commissioned in 1919 and went on to be awarded seven battle stars during WWII.\n\nThe new Idaho is the 26th Virginia-class boat. The ship is the fifth U.S. Navy vessel to carry the name \"Idaho. The first was a wooden steam sloop that was turned into a full-rigged sailing ship commissioned in 1866. The second was the BB-24, a Mississippi-class battleship. During World War I, motorboat SP-545 also carried the name before \"Idaho\" was transferred to a New Mexico-class battleship of WWII. That warship was known as \"The Big Spud\" for the state's most famous crop.\n\nIt's common for the U.S. Navy to reuse ship names in honor of historical vessels. The most well-known example is probably the USS Enterprise, as there have been nine thusly-named vessels, three of which are aircraft carriers. The new USS Idaho will undergo a series of sea trials prior to its official commissioning, which will likely take place sometime in the spring of 2026. In the meantime, dedicated submariners will get to know the boat, which is expected to help strengthen the nation's undersea warfare capabilities.\n\nThe USS Idaho (SSN-799) is one of the most advanced nuclear submarines in the world. Virginia-class subs are designated to be attack platforms with the capability to launch cruise missiles. They're used primarily for anti-submarine warfare and intelligence gathering, and they can operate in blue-water oceans as well as in littoral areas along coastlines. The class is slowly replacing the cruise-missile variant of the Ohio class and other nuclear submarines in the Los Angeles class.\n\nAs of this writing, three Virginia-class boats are earmarked for the Royal Australian Navy, while the rest remain with the U.S. Navy. The USS Idaho measures 377 feet long with a displacement of 10,200 tons of seawater when submerged. The boat utilizes an S9G reactor alongside an auxiliary diesel engine and has a maximum speed of around 29 mph. Like other vessels of its class, the Idaho will be home to 128 enlisted personnel and 17 officers.\n\nBecause the boat is powered by nuclear energy, it has virtually an unlimited range and will likely remain in service for at least 40 years. In terms of armament, the USS Idaho features two Virginia Payload Tubes and four additional payload tubes capable of firing the BGM-109 Tomahawk cruise missile. Additionally, it features four 21-inch torpedo tubes to fire the U.S. Navy's MK-48 heavy torpedo.\n\nWant the latest in tech and auto trends?

    "description": "\"I want to properly understand.\"",
    "fullText": "Tens of thousands of years ago, a new study suggests, a warming event led to the release of carbon dioxide from deep in the Southern Ocean. Now, scientists say, these findings could shed light on the potential fallout from continued warming in the Antarctic.\n\nLed by scientists at the Laoshan Laboratory in Qingdao, China, and Germany's GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel, the study looked at sediment cores from the Southern Ocean to understand the behavior of Antarctic Bottom Water, or AABW.\n\n​​\"We wanted to understand how the influence of Antarctic Bottom Water, the coldest and densest water mass in the global ocean, changed during the last deglaciation, and what role it played in the global carbon cycle,\" said Huang Huang, who led the study, in a GEOMAR press release.\n\nThe researchers' findings, published recently in the journal Nature Geoscience, suggest that AABW expansion helped bring the last Ice Age to an end.\n\n\"As the planet warmed and the ice sheets melted between about 18,000 and 10,000 years ago, the volume of Antarctic Bottom Water expanded in two distinct phases,\" according to the release.\n\n\"These phases coincided with known warming events in Antarctica. As vertical mixing in the Southern Ocean increased, the carbon that had been stored in the deep ocean was able to return to the atmosphere.\"\n\nThe research team found that the deepest waters stayed fairly stagnant and out of touch with shallower waters until the Earth began to warm. When the water was stirred up by the expansion created by the warming of the planet, carbon stores were released into the Earth's atmosphere, forcing temperatures higher.\n\nThe team's study goes back tens of thousands of years and thousands of meters down into the ocean. But its insights could be relevant today and on land where countless communities are vulnerable to the impacts of rising global temperatures.\n\n\"Comparisons with the past are always imperfect, but ultimately it comes down to how much energy is in the system,\" said GEOMAR geochemist Marcus Gutjahr, per the release. \"If we understand how the ocean responded to warming in the past, we can better grasp what is happening today as Antarctic ice shelves continue to melt.\"\n\nDeep Southern Ocean waters have warmed faster than most others in the past half-century. If the warming waters and thawing ice repeat the patterns of the past, huge amounts of carbon could be released into the atmosphere again and contribute to subsequent temperature rise.\n\nShould we be pouring money into nuclear fusion technology?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\n\"I want to properly understand the modern ocean in order to interpret signals from the past,\" Gutjahr said. \"If we can trace how Antarctic Bottom Water has changed over the last few thousand years, we can assess more accurately how rapidly the Antarctic Ice Sheet may continue to lose mass in the future.\"\n\nOther studies have shown that sea ice levels have dropped alarmingly over the last 50 years.\n\nAdvances in this field could help world leaders and global organizations prepare for the potentially catastrophic consequences of continued planetary warming. Evidence about the threats of sea level rise, food system disruptions, and disease spread can inform adaptation strategies.\n\nBut such alarming findings could also help stir meaningful public action now to mitigate rising temperatures, such as transitioning to cleaner home energy systems and transportation options.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

(Photo by Octavio Passos/Getty Images)\n\nInterestingly, Inzaghi’s former team, Inter Milan, were interested in the services of Cancelo as well and had even reached an agreement with Al Hilal. But the player had his heart set on a return to Barcelona.\n\nCancelo, in fact, has big plans upon his impending return to Barcelona, as he wants to stay at Camp Nou beyond the end of the season.\n\nSuch a move would depend on Barcelona’s relationship with Al Hilal, who have shown interest in signing Raphinha and have already tabled a bid worth €100 million.\n\nA potential Al Hilal move for Raphinha would certainly pave the way for the Saudi giants to release Cancelo.\n\nHowever, such a deal would depend entirely on the Brazilian international, who will be allowed to move on due to a gentleman’s agreement between him and Deco.",

FlashInfer-Bench addresses this gap by establishing a standardized, closed-loop framework that connects kernel generation, benchmarking, and deployment. At its core, FlashInfer Trace provides a unified schema describing kernel definitions, workloads, implementations, and evaluations, enabling consistent communication between agents and systems. Built on real serving traces, FlashInfer-Bench includes a curated dataset, a robust correctness- and performance-aware benchmarking framework, a public leaderboard to track LLM agents' GPU programming capabilities, and a dynamic substitution mechanism (apply()) that seamlessly injects the best-performing kernels into production LLM engines such as SGLang and vLLM. Using FlashInfer-Bench, we further evaluate the performance and limitations of LLM agents, compare the trade-offs among different GPU programming languages, and provide insights for future agent design.",

    "fullText": "Millions of Gen Zers are facing unemployment as entry-level office roles get absorbed by AI, and millennials are regretting taking out thousands in student loans for careers that now have significantly diminished prospects. Now, the CEO of the world’s biggest talent company, Randstad, has confirmed what many young grads are already fearing: The traditional college-to-office pipeline is dead.\n\n“People need to reflect on—taking a student loan, going to college and being trained or educated for a profession that is rapidly changing—whether that’s still the right path,” Sander van ’t Noordende, the global CEO of Randstad, told Fortune.\n\n“We all grew up, with our parents saying, ‘go do something in college or university and then do something in an office,’ that path that used to work for a long time is starting to break,” he added.\n\n“You already see that with the graduates finding it harder to find a job. You see that in professions like marketing, communications, design… just look at how good AI already is at some of that.”\n\nUnder his helm, the staffing company places around half a million workers in jobs every week—and he has bad news for those who have already forked out thousands for their degree in the hopes of nabbing a cushy office role: You may have more luck landing bartending, barista, or building jobs.\n\nTech leaders have consistently warned that AI is already as good as entry-level workers and that it could halve white-collar jobs by 2030. In fact, a “first-of-its-kind” Stanford University study has warned that the new technology is already having “significant and disproportionate impact” on Gen Z. Bartenders and baristas are even seeing bigger pay raises than desk workers, right now.\n\n“Jobs will change—and are changing—but also new jobs will emerge,” van ’t Noordende echoed. “There is a massive demand in skilled trades, mechanical engineers, machine operators, maintenance engineers, forklift drivers, truck drivers—you name it.”\n\nWith the white-collar job market seemingly frozen, van ’t Noordende said it’s no longer “good advice” to tell young people to follow their passions.\n\n“No, learn a craft or a trade or a skill or a profession, where you can make a good living and provide for you and your family, is much better advice than follow your passion.”\n\nFurther making his case: The U.K. government has just announced it’ll be splurging $965 million into apprenticeships to help place tens of thousands of unemployed young people into the jobs that they think are the future—and they’re all in hospitality, retail, and AI.\n\nBut for those hell-bent on going to college, van ’t Noordende stressed that STEM subjects—which are studied in China at twice the rate of the U.S. and parts of Europe—will likely remain in demand.\n\nAnd his advice to those who’ve already wasted time and money on a degree that’s dwindling in relevance? “Retrain. Learning new skills always good.”\n\n“Look around you, and where you see the opportunities that match with your skills and your background and go there,” van ’t Noordende added. But he warned that at some point, you may just “have to bite the bullet and say, ‘Okay, this is not working.’”\n\nThe CEO stressed that you’re not alone; many people are currently doing exactly that. And that ultimately, going from a desk job to becoming a plumber, teacher, or nurse, van ’t Noordende says, requires a mindset shift. It’s not a failure if you end up doing work outside your field of study—it’s just adjusting to what actually works. “You have to come off your chair and build skills,” he added.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

    "fullText": "In this week’s newsletter: Stranger Things’ climactic showdown is the latest pop culture spectacle to feel like its been ported straight from a console. The industries’ reciprocally influential relationship can be to everyone’s gain\n\nDon’t get Pushing Buttons delivered to your inbox? \nIt had begun to feel like an endurance test by the end, but nonetheless, like the sucker I am, I watched the Stranger Things finale last week. And spoiler warning: I’m going to talk about it in general terms in this newsletter. Because approximately 80% of the final season comprised twentysomething “teenagers” explaining things to each other while using random 1980s objects to illustrate convoluted plans and plot points, my expectations were not high. After an interminable hour, finally, something fun happens, as the not-kids arm themselves with machine guns and molotovs and face off against a monstrously gigantic demon-crab. Aha, I thought – the final boss battle!\n\nThe fight was like something out of Monster Hunter, all scale and spectacle with a touch of desperation. For a very long time, video games sought to imitate cinema. Now cinema (and TV) often feels like a video game. The structure of Stranger Things’ final season reminded me a lot of Resident Evil: long periods of walking slowly through corridors, with characters exchanging plot information aloud on their way to the action, and occasional explosions of gunfire, screeching monsters or car chases. Those long periods of relative inaction are much more tolerable when you’ve got a controller in your hands. I am all for TV and film embracing the excitement, spectacle and dynamism of video games, but do they have to embrace the unnecessary side-quests and open-world bloat, too?\n\nThe reciprocally influential relationship between games, TV and film has developed a lot in the last few years. A generation of gen X and elder-millennial gamers have recently aged into creative and commissioning power in these industries. That’s why we’re getting people such as Jonathan Nolan heading up an excellent Fallout TV show, and indeed why all video-game-to-screen adaptations have become dramatically less terrible in the past five years or so. It also inevitably means that the boundaries between interactive and non-interactive entertainment are becoming more porous: where previously game-makers were heavily influenced by film (primarily but not exclusively Alien/s and Star Wars), now that relationship works both ways. Most Marvel movies look and feel like a video game to me, and not just because they’re all full of computer-generated graphics. It’s the mood and pace of them.\n\nEdge of Tomorrow remains the most video-game-ish movie I’ve ever seen: its premise revolves around dying and respawning, trying out different things on each run. It’s a sci-fi roguelike of a film. I wanted to play Mad Max: Fury Road the entire time I was watching it, and John Wick 4 was literally a fighting-game boss rush. When film critics say that a film feels like a video game, they often mean it disparagingly; a lot of cinephiles still see games as the lower form. When I say a movie feels like a video game, it’s a compliment – unless it feels like a boring video game.\n\nThis was the problem, for me, with Stranger Things: every episode felt like loading up an open-world game that I hadn’t played for a few months. More and more characters kept appearing, and I didn’t remember or care who most of them were. Between the Upside Down, Vecna’s mindscape, real-world Hawkins and an entirely new dimension introduced in the last couple of episodes, there were too many locations to keep track of. Every episode brought on the mild despair I feel when I think I’m near the end of an overlong game, only to discover yet another entirely new area to explore. The painfully long epilogue, meanwhile, was rivalled only by Red Dead Redemption 2’s interminable post-game hours. Please, just let it end already!\n\nOf course, in modern pop culture, nothing is ever allowed to end properly, not if it’s still making money. I’m surprised there’s been no word of an official Stranger Things video game tie-in (outside of a retro-style smartphone beat-em-up from 2019). Come to think of it, we don’t see many of these kinds of licensed games any more: back in the 00s and 2010s, most major movies and TV shows launched with an interactive accompaniment. Presumably this is because of the spiralling cost of game development – you can’t knock out a mediocre PlayStation 2 game in nine months any more – but also, when TV shows feel so much like games, do we really need an adaptation anyway?\n\nThe first game I’ve finished in 2026 is Indika, a surreal and mildly horrible game about a young nun questioning her faith and having conversations with the devil as she goes on an extremely strange journey through bleak, snow-covered villages and abandoned factories with an escaped convict. There are much-needed flashes of humour in here, but also stuff about religion, control and sexuality that I haven’t seen in a video game before. It’s also part of a small wave of games (see Baby Steps) that mocks gamer mentality: there are points, but they are pointless; explore off the beaten path and you will find something useless and inconsequential rather than a secret or something fun. And that’s if you find anything at all.\n\nAvailable on: PC, PS5, Xbox, Nintendo Switch\n\n Estimated playtime: five hours\n\nDavid Rosen, the co-founder of Sega and an influential figure in the history of arcade video games, died on Christmas Day at 95. Keith Stuart writes about his very interesting life.\n\nHollow Knight: Silksong has picked up a game-of-the-year trophy in PC games storefront Steam’s publicly voted awards. The Sit Back and Relax award was won by something I’ve never heard of: RV There Yet. I have bought it out of curiosity.\n\nMy book about Nintendo is out next month! It’s called Super Nintendo and it’s a lively cultural history of the most beloved company in games, based on 20 years of interviews (and 30 years as a player). You can support the Guardian by ordering it through the Guardian Bookshop, and I’ll also be doing launch events around the UK throughout February.\n\nThe 15 best PS5 games to play in 2026\n\n‘I wanted that Raiders of the Lost Ark excitement – you could die any minute’\n\nFrom K-pop and The Traitors to Grand Theft Auto VI: your A-Z of the biggest culture of 2026\n\nIn a recent Pushing Buttons, Keza mentioned that games have consolidated into five established mega-franchises and I was trying to work out which franchises these are? I guessed GTA, Fortnite, Call of Duty, Minecraft and EA FC, but don’t have huge confidence in that!\n\nYou’re not far off. According to data from Circana, the top five most played games on PlayStation 5 this year were exactly the same as last year: Fortnite, Call of Duty, Grand Theft Auto 5 (including Online), Roblox and Minecraft. All of these games are five to 10-plus years old. This stagnation at the top is why every big publisher has spent millions in the last decade trying to create live-service games, and why most of them have flopped. Last year on Steam, meanwhile, only 14% of all playtime was spent on new games released in 2025. Any developer releasing something new, be they blockbuster or indie, is competing for a sliver of a sliver of players’ time and money. These stats explain a lot about why the games industry is where it is right now, and why there’s such a bleak mood among many developers.",
