    "fullText": "United States forward Trinity Rodman has signed a new three-year deal with the National Women's Soccer League's Washington Spirit that will reportedly make her the world's highest-paid woman footballer.\n\nThe Spirit announced the signing in a statement on Thursday, calling it \"one of the most significant contracts in the NWSL and the women's game worldwide, reflecting both Rodman's elite status and the Spirit's role as a global standard-bearer in women's soccer.\"\n\nESPN and The Athletic reported the deal is worth more than $2 million annually, including bonuses.\n\nHer agent, Mike Senkowski of Upper 90 Sports Group, told both outlets it will make her the highest-paid female player in the world.\n\nRodman, daughter of former NBA star Dennis Rodman, was drafted at the age of 18 in 2021 and earned Rookie of the Year honors as the Spirit won their first NWSL title.\n\nShe has won Olympic gold, and while the Spirit fell in the past two NWSL title matches, the club has made retaining her a priority.\n\n\"I knew this was where I wanted to enter the next chapter of my career,\" Rodman said in a statement. \"I'm proud of what we've built since my rookie season, and I'm excited about where this club is headed.\n\n\"We're chasing championships and raising the standard, and I can't wait to keep doing that with my teammates and the best fans in the NWSL.\"\n\nThe path to re-sign Rodman, whose previous contract expired on December 31, hasn't been smooth.\n\nA four-year deal that would have paid Rodman significantly \n\nThe NWSL Players Association responded by filing a grievance against the league on Rodman's behalf.\n\nIn December, the league's board of governors approved the creation of a new High Impact Player rule, allowing teams to spend up to $1 million beyond the salary cap on certain stars in a bid to keep them in the league.\n\nESPN had reported that Rodman had offers from overseas clubs, notably in England.\n\n\"Trinity is a generational player, but more importantly, she represents the future of this club and the future of women's soccer,\" Spirit owner Michele Kang said. \"This agreement reflects our belief that elite talent deserves elite commitment.\"",

    "description": "Three robotics experts said humanoid robots need to move beyond flashy demos to performing tasks that are actually useful in the real world at scale.",
    "fullText": "Humanoid robots can do kung-fu and parkour. But can they make your morning coffee?\n\nAt a Davos panel on Thursday, moderated by Business Insider's Jamie Heller, three robotics experts said humanoid robots needed to move beyond flashy demos and perform useful tasks in the real world at scale.\n\nJake Loosararian, the CEO of infrastructure startup Gecko Robotics, said that deploying robots into real-world environments was the major challenge facing the much-hyped industry.\n\n\"Deployment is the big problem right now for robotics, in terms of the ability for it to begin to make really large impacts, and for there to be a clear road map,\" said Loosararian.\n\nThe cofounder of the Pittsburgh-based company said that building reliable sources of data about the environments in which humanoid robots were operating would be critical for startups looking to move beyond flashy demos to real-world returns.\n\n\"You have to forward deploy and build your robots as close to the environment as possible. And that gives you the information and dataset that doesn't exist anywhere on the internet, anywhere on YouTube, about what these environments are like,\" Loosararian added.\n\nDaniela Rus, the director of MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, said there was a gap between robots' ability to perform tasks in a laboratory and their ability to take on jobs traditionally done by humans in the real world.\n\n\"I can give you a robot that will fold your laundry and load your dishwasher, but it might cost you half a billion dollars,\" she said.\n\nRus said bridging that gap would require advancements in a humanoid robot's ability to perceive and manipulate the world through improved sensors and new AI models that can handle situations the robot may not have encountered before.\n\nShao Tianlan, the CEO of Chinese AI and robotics firm Mech-Mind, said that one big barrier to making humanoid robots useful in a factory environment was developing the capacity for them to learn directly from their human coworkers.\n\n\"If we want to deploy a robot, I would say demonstration is the most intuitive way to tell robots what to do. That's exactly how we humans teach others,\" he said.\n\nTianlan, who said that Mech-Mind had delivered more than 10,000 \"intelligent robots\" over the last 12 months, added that he did not believe humanoid robots needed \"Einstein-level\" intelligence to perform useful tasks, however.\n\nHe predicted that robots would take on some jobs performed by humans in controlled environments, such as in logistics and some service industries, in the next \"few hundred days.\"\n\nHumanoid robots are riding a wave of hype as companies like Tesla and Figure prepare to begin large-scale manufacturing of their machines. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has made bold predictions about the company's Optimus robot, saying it could eliminate poverty and be the biggest product of all time.\n\nHowever, most humanoid robots have not yet been deployed in real-world environments. Many humanoid robot demos are staged in tightly controlled settings, and some use teleoperation, where human operators pilot the robots remotely.\n\nLoosararian called teleoperation the \"dirty little secret\" of robotics, adding that robotics companies had a responsibility to inform customers about whether their humanoid robots are operating autonomously or with human assistance.\n\n\"There's a lot of autonomy for certain tasks, but for the majority of the cases, for humanoids, it's learning in the environment, and it has to do that with teleoperation,\" Loosararian said.",

    "description": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk took to the stage at Davos in his first-ever World Economic Forum appearance, in which he revealed few new details.",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk once called Davos \"boring af.\" After his first appearance, some attendees might agree with him.\n\nThe billionaire took to the stage at the World Economic Forum in a surprise appearance on Thursday for an interview that touched on many points of his sprawling business empire — but offered few new details.\n\nMusk has previously avoided the conference, and the Tesla CEO has in the past criticized Davos and its organizing body, the World Economic Forum.\n\nAnticipation was therefore high after Musk was unexpectedly added to the schedule on Thursday morning.\n\nInterviewed by Larry Fink, the BlackRock CEO and interim WEF cochair, Musk began by explaining Tesla's mission of \"abundance for all,\" largely reiterating comments he's previously made on X and in other interviews.\n\nThe world's richest man predicted that \"ubiquitous\" AI and robotics would lead to an unprecedented expansion of the global economy and ultimately render work obsolete, and predicted that \"AI will be smarter than all of humanity collectively\" by 2030 or 2031.\n\n\"At a certain point, there will be such an abundance of goods and services because my prediction is there'll be more robots than people,\" Musk said.\n\nThe billionaire did, however, share a more concrete timeline for Optimus: he expects Tesla to start selling the humanoid robots to the public by the end of next year.\n\nMusk didn't address Tesla's robotaxi rollout — another product critical to the company's future — beyond reiterating that he hoped to get approval for its Full Self-Driving technology in Europe and China next month. Investors are keen for details about when the company will remove human safety operators from its service in Austin and begin planned operations in several new US cities.\n\nMuch of the interview focused on space-based AI data centers, a topic that Musk and other Big Tech CEOs have discussed extensively in recent months.\n\nMusk told Fink that SpaceX would begin launching solar-powered AI satellites into space \"within a few years,\" adding that he expected space-based computing to largely solve the wrangling over the vast amounts of energy used to power AI back on earth.\n\n\"The net effect is that the lowest cost place to put AI will be in space, and that'll be true within two years, maybe three at the latest,\" said Musk.\n\nThe SpaceX founder also touched on the longevity trend, saying that ageing was a \"solvable problem,\" but warned that society could \"lack vibrancy\" if humans were able to live forever.\n\nMusk ended his Davos debut with an appeal to optimism, a philosophical conclusion for someone who has previously used public appearances to attack his business rivals and issue eye-catching pronouncements.\n\n\"I think my last words would be, I would encourage everyone to be optimistic and excited about the future,\" Musk said.\n\n\"Generally, I think for quality of life, it is actually better to err on the side of being an optimist and be wrong rather than be a pessimist and right,\" he added.",

It's not a subtle thing,\" Musk said. \"The reason I say it's not a subtle thing is because all the cells in your body, you know, pretty much age at the same rate. I've never seen someone with an old left arm and a young right arm ever in my life, so why is that? There must be a clock that is synchronizing across 35 trillion cells in your body,\"\n\nBut Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, said there would be some downsides to longer lives.\n\n\"You know, there is some benefit to death, by the way. There's a reason why we don't actually have a longer lifespan, because if people do live for a very long time, I think there's some risk of an ossification of society. Of things getting locked in place,\" he said. \"It may become stultifying. A lack of vibrancy, but that said, do I think we'll figure out ways to extend life and maybe even reverse aging? I think that's highly likely.\"\n\nMusk's surprise appearance was his first time onstage at the World Economic Forum, which he'd previously called \"boring af.\" His conversation with Fink was wide-ranging, but didn't reveal much new information.\n\nDozens of political and business leaders from across the globe gathered in Davos, Switzerland, this week to attend the World Economic Forum. The guest list included President Donald Trump, who made his case for the US to annex Greenland and the US's economic agenda during his address on Wednesday.\n\nTrump's push for Greenland has rattled European leaders and the US markets. It's also shocked Greenlanders, who have spoken against the annexation and the Trump administration.\n\n\"We're not for sale,\" one resident said.\n\nTrump said the US would not use military force to take Greenland, but has leveraged tariffs against European countries in his campaign.\n\nThe weeklong event ends on Friday with closing remarks from WEF President Børge Brende and Saudi Arabia's Minister of Economy and Planning.",

    "fullText": "Estimate made by Center for Countering Digital Hate after Elon Musk’s AI image generation tool sparked outrage\n\nGrok AI generated about 3m sexualised images in less than two weeks, including 23,000 that appear to depict children, according to researchers who said it “became an industrial-scale machine for the production of sexual abuse material”.\n\nThe estimate has been made by the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) after Elon Musk’s AI image generation tool sparked international outrage when it allowed users to upload photographs of strangers and celebrities, digitally strip them to their underwear or into bikinis, put them in provocative poses and post the images on X.\n\nThe trend went viral over the new year, peaking on 2 January with 199,612 individual requests, according to analysis conducted by Peryton Intelligence, a digital intelligence company specialising in online hate.\n\nA fuller assessment of the output from the feature, from its launch on 29 December 2025 until 8 January 2026, has now been made by the CCDH. It suggests the impact of the technology may have been broader than previously thought. Public figures identified in sexualised images it analysed include Selena Gomez, Taylor Swift, Billie Eilish, Ariana Grande, Ice Spice, Nicki Minaj, Christina Hendricks, Millie Bobby Brown, the Swedish deputy prime minister Ebba Busch, and the former US vice-president Kamala Harris.\n\nThe feature was restricted to paid users on 9 January and further restrictions followed after the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, called the situation “disgusting” and “shameful”. Other countries, including Indonesia and Malaysia, announced blocks on the AI tool.\n\nCCDH estimated that over the 11-day period, Grok was helping create sexualised images of children every 41 seconds. These included a selfie uploaded by a schoolgirl undressed by Grok, turning a “before school selfie” into an image of her in a bikini.\n\n“What we found was clear and disturbing: in that period Grok became an industrial-scale machine for the production of sexual abuse material,” said Imran Ahmed, CCDH’s chief executive. “Stripping a woman without their permission is sexual abuse. Throughout that period Elon was hyping the product even when it was clear to the world it was being used in this way. What Elon was ginning up was controversy, eyeballs, engagement and users. It was deeply disturbing.”\n\nHe added: “This has become a standard playbook for Silicon Valley, and in particular for social media and AI platforms. The incentives are all misaligned. They profit from this outrage. It’s not about Musk personally. This is about a system [with] perverse incentives and no minimum safeguards prescribed in law. And until regulators and lawmakers do their jobs and create a minimum expectation of safety, this will continue to happen.”\n\nX announced it had stopped its Grok feature from editing pictures of real people to show them in revealing clothes, including for premium subscribers, on 14 January.\n\nX referred to its statement from last week, which said: “We remain committed to making X a safe platform for everyone and continue to have zero tolerance for any forms of child sexual exploitation, non-consensual nudity, and unwanted sexual content.\n\n“We take action to remove high-priority violative content, including child sexual abuse material and non-consensual nudity, taking appropriate action against accounts that violate our X rules. We also report accounts seeking child sexual exploitation materials to law enforcement authorities as necessary.”",

    "fullText": "Video game publisher to cancel Prince of Persia remake and close studios after several difficult years\n\nThe video game publisher behind the Assassin’s Creed series has cancelled six projects including a remake of Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time as it fights to stay competitive in the global gaming market.\n\nUbisoft announced a sweeping reorganisation and said it would cancel six games, sending its shares to their lowest level in more than a decade on Thursday.\n\nUbisoft is abandoning development of six titles, including a highly anticipated remake of Prince of Persia – a series that dates back to 1989 and received an ill-fated Hollywood adaptation in 2010 – and delaying a further seven. Studios in Halifax, Canada and Stockholm are being closed, with restructuring to follow in other countries, it said.\n\nAfter the announcement, Ubisoft’s shares fell by a third to their lowest level since 2011 on Thursday, valuing the company at €590m (£514m) compared with a peak of more than €10bn in the previous decade. The Paris-based company said it planned to split its operations into five creative divisions organised by genre, part of a broader attempt to sharpen focus and rein in costs after years of disappointing releases and weak results.\n\nThe company said the restructuring was driven by the competitive market for AAA games, the term for big-budget, high-profile titles such as Grand Theft Auto.\n\n“The triple-A industry has become persistently more selective and competitive with rising development costs and greater challenges in creating brands,” said Ubisoft’s founder and chief executive, Yves Guillemot.\n\nHowever, Guillemot added that successful triple-A games have “more financial potential than ever”.\n\nUbisoft also blamed an “increasingly competitive market” for shooters, a key genre for the industry.\n\nLaurent Michaud, a gaming industry economist, said action adventure titles such as Prince of Persia were out of step with a market dominated currently by shooters like Fortnite and Call of Duty, cooperative adventure titles such as Peak and sports titles and multiplayer games such as those available on the Roblox platform.\n\n“The expectations of gamers are quite different to where they were 10 years ago. That’s why it’s difficult to keep in touch with an audience that has changed so much over the years.”\n\nHe added: “Ubisoft is still one of the most popular content providers in the video games industry. It has developed one of the best IP slates in the industry but even if the games are really good, it is not enough. It has to meet people’s expectations and tastes.”\n\nThe latest overhaul follows several difficult years marked by game delays, cancellations and weak execution, which have eroded investor confidence and strained the group’s finances. In November 2025, Ubisoft postponed the publication of its half-year results at the last minute, triggering a week-long suspension of trading in its shares and bonds. The company later said an accounting change had revealed a breach of the terms for its debt.",

    "fullText": "There are no salary caps and no luxury taxes, yet the world’s most-watched soccer league is only getting more balanced\n\nDavid Stern used to tell a joke. In his early years as NBA commissioner, he liked to say, his job was essentially to travel back and forth between Boston and Los Angeles to hand out the championship trophy. In the first five NBA Finals after he took the helm in early 1984, the Celtics and Lakers won all five titles, each missing the decisive series just once.\n\nCurrent commissioner Adam Silver recalled the anecdote last June, ahead of the 2025 NBA Finals, by which time the league was guaranteed a seventh different champion in seven years. “We set out to create a system that allowed for more competition around the league,” Silver said then in his annual news conference. “The goal being to have 30 teams all in the position, if well managed, to compete for championships. And that’s what we’re seeing here.”\n\n“The goal isn’t necessarily to have a different champion every year,” Silver added. “It’s to have [...] parity of opportunity.”\n\nNFL commissioner Roger Goodell gave his own endorsement of competitive parity in 2011: “There are systems that we have to make sure that we maintain. When you come into a season, every fan thinks that their football team has a chance to win the Super Bowl.”\n\nWhen the Los Angeles Dodgers loaded up on talent yet again before the 2025 MLB season, seemingly fated to repeat as champions, commissioner Rob Manfred acknowledged that, “We certainly have owners in the game who are as concerned as fans are about the level of disparity in the game.”\n\nFor decades, the heads of American sports leagues have argued that parity is necessary to sustain fan interest and to stay financially sustainable. And they have manipulated the talent market in all sorts of ways – with salary caps, revenue sharing, drafts, wealth and talent redistribution, “aprons”, and so on – in service of that goal.\n\nYet the competitiveness of a league has no obvious bearing on its popularity. Baseball was never more popular than when the New York Yankees dominated it. The NBA’s cultural ascent coincided with the Celtics and Lakers’ decade-long duopoly, followed by the Chicago Bulls dynasty. Manchester United won the Premier League just about every year as the circuit became globally dominant.\n\nConcerned about sustainability? Don’t be. Professional teams that lost money often double as handy instruments to write off taxes for billionaires while the asset steadily appreciates anyway. To a cynic, parity has always felt like an excuse to short-change the players, a contrived cover for cost-controls and labor suppression.\n\nLately, the flaws in the parity principle have been delightfully illustrated by the Premier League, the sports world’s ongoing experiment to determine what happens when virtually no brakes are applied to runaway globalized capitalism. Past the halfway point of this season, just nine points separate fourth-place Liverpool from 15th-place Bournemouth. Sixth-place Newcastle are three points from 12th-place Everton. In sum, seven teams sit within the swing of a single game. Which is to say that with no parity mechanisms whatsoever, almost all the teams in the league are competitive.\n\nThey can’t all win the thing, exactly, but through an ever-evolving class of owners who treat their Premier League clubs as anything from vanity projects to investment vehicles to soft-power plays, a broad upper class and a huge middle class of teams have emerged.\n\nThe league’s largely unfettered economics – with the profitability and sustainability rules now tweaked to merely limit clubs to spending no more than 85 percent of their footballing earnings on their squads – practically require every club to spend at a competitive level every single season. This has caused a flattening of the talent level between many teams, and forced the smaller clubs to get smarter and better. In either case, the situation stands in stark contrast to the American system, in which many parasite teams allowed to feed off their more ambitious peers.\n\nMeanwhile, the Premier League’s 20 teams are trending towards more competitive balance. Liverpool’s 84-point title last season was the lowest haul since Leicester City’s fluky (if thrilling) championship in 2015-16, when all the habitual contenders happened to have an off-year at exactly the same time.\n\nMore tellingly, perhaps, is the uptick in the average points total of the middle third, give or take, of the Premier League table in the past four seasons and change. In 2021-22, the clubs who finished eighth through 13th averaged 49.5 points over the course of the campaign. That number ticked up by half a point over the next two seasons, before jumping to 54.7 in 2024-25. So far, 2025-26 is on pace to post a figure of 53.7, suggesting that something lasting may be shifting. (The 2020-21 season did produce a 54-point average, but that was a significant outlier to the three seasons before and after it.)\n\nCertainly, you could point out that this competitive balance may exist organically in the Premier League but eludes almost every other league in the world, save for Italy’s Serie A. But then the closest comparator to the Premier League in our little parity case study isn’t the European continent’s legacy soccer leagues. It’s the other best-in-class, globally popular circuits that dominate their sports: the NFL, the NBA and MLB.\n\nAt least a half-dozen Premier League teams, and as many as eight, have the resources to mount a plausible title challenge in any given season. That’s about a third of the league. Three-quarters of the top-tier clubs stand a reasonable chance of finishing in the top half or better.\n\nThat’s a kind of parity, too. Yet it was achieved without manipulating the market to the detriment of the players and, ultimately, the product.\n\nLeander Schaerlaeckens’ book on the United States men’s national soccer team, The Long Game, is out on 12 May.

    "description": "Olympic legend Katie Ledecky loves training. Her workout tips make it easier to exercise to build muscle, strength, and speed like an elite athlete.",
    "fullText": "One of the most decorated Olympians of all time said that after decades of training, she's still excited to work out.\n\nKatie Ledecky has earned 14 Olympic medals (nine of them gold) for her prowess in the pool. In events like the 800-meter freestyle, she's her own biggest competition, breaking her own world records in the quest for her personal best.\n\n\"I do really love the training,\" she told Business Insider. \"And I think because I love the training, it makes it very easy to go to practice every day and really continue to strive toward these big goals that I've set for myself.\"\n\nLedecky's training plan involves long hours in the pool, of course. But her dry-land workouts incorporate a mix of high-intensity circuits and weightlifting to build muscle.\n\n\"Swimming is a full-body exercise. So upper body strength, lower body strength, core strength, mobility, all those things are important,\" Ledecky said.\n\nThe gold medalist's approach can help you get the most out of your gym time even if you're not headed for the Olympics, with simple strategies to level up your workouts.\n\nA typical workout for Ledecky includes movements like cleans, squats, deadlifts, and pull-ups that help build explosive athleticism to stay ahead in the pool.\n\n\"Things like that translate well to developing power and pushing off the wall,\" she said.\n\nNon-swimmers can benefit, too: full-body exercises are one of the most efficient ways to build muscle, since you're working arms, legs, core, and back all at once. They can also improve mobility if you're training in a full range of motion.\n\nLedecky also incorporates circuit training with bike sprints and sled pushes. These shorter bursts of high-intensity exercise are great for improving your cardio fitness when you're short on time, and are linked to better longevity.\n\nLedecky has been swimming since she was six, and competed at her first Olympics (London 2012) at age 15.\n\nSince then, she's been to the Olympics three more times, dominating at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Games, in Tokyo 2020, and Paris 2024. She's also held multiple World Championship titles.\n\nThe training doesn't stop between big events. To stay focused leading up to international competitions, she said her approach is all about showing up to put in the work, over and over again.\n\n\"I've just always had a goal of consistency and I take it one year at a time, one day at a time,\" Ledecky said.\n\nFor everyday athletes, it's a good reminder to find a sustainable exercise routine. Personal trainers recommend starting small and building up over time, since exercise only works if you can keep doing it long enough to see results.\n\nLedecky said one of her favorite aspects of swimming is the intensely supportive community, from the youngest athletes who start at age six to the most elite competitors.\n\n\"It's seen very much as an individual sport, but I think many swimmers would say they couldn't do it without their team. There's such great camaraderie,\" she said.\n\nThat team spirit, encouragement, and playful rivalry among friends is what keeps Ledecky going through early-morning sessions in a cold pool and long hours of hard training.\n\nA good fitness community can make a big difference for everyday athletes, too — research shows you're more likely to stick to a workout plan and get results if you find a gym buddy (or many).\n\n\"It makes the motivation piece really easy when you know that you're in it with someone else,\" Ledecky said.\n\nFor peak performance, training is only part of the equation. Resting is crucial to allow the body to build back stronger. Ledecky has been competing for over a decade, and at 28 said she needs more recovery time than before.\n\n\"When I was 15, I don't remember ever feeling tired,\" she said. \"I'm definitely making sure that I'm getting extra sleep at night and getting naps in when I can.\"\n\nThe Olympian said she prioritizes getting enough sleep and eating a balanced diet (she loves a veggie omelet and has a partnership with egg brand Eggland's Best). The basic habits work better than an elaborate or high-tech protocol, according to Ledecky.\n\n\"It's not anything too crazy or too out there,\" she said. \"It's really just the simple things I think are the most important things.\"",

    "fullText": "First one-day international, R Premadasa Stadium, Colombo\n\nSri Lanka 271-6 (50 overs): K Mendis 93 (117), Liyange 46 (53); Rashid 3-44\n\nEngland 252 (49.2 overs): Duckett 62, Root 61; Madushan 3-39\n\nSri Lanka won by 19 runs, lead three-match series 1-0\n\nEngland changed formats and opponents, yet still followed their dismal Ashes campaign with defeat by Sri Lanka in the first one-day international in Colombo.\n\nOnly two weeks after the completion of their 4-1 series defeat in Australia, England were choked by the Sri Lanka spinners on a slow, low surface.\n\nSet a taxing 272 to win thanks to 93 not out from Kusal Mendis, the tourists were given a platform by a much-needed 62 from Ben Duckett and a typically classy 61 by Joe Root.\n\nBut both were out playing sweeps to the skilful Sri Lankans, and the required rate spiralled out of England's control.\n\nThe visitors lost eight wickets for 84 runs, including Harry Brook and Jacob Bethell both stumped.\n\nJamie Overton's hitting meant 20 were needed off the final over, but his miscue to cover left England 252 all out. The margin of 19 runs made the contest look closer than it was.\n\nEngland go 1-0 down in the three-match series, having now lost their last 11 ODIs away from home.\n\nThe second match of the series is at the same ground on Saturday.\n\nIn the aftermath of a high-stakes, high-intensity Ashes series, the contrast of a low-key tour of Sri Lanka could either be a welcome change for England, or an unwanted return to the grind.\n\nFive of England's Ashes squad were in the XI in Colombo. A sixth man, Will Jacks, would have played, only to be ruled out by illness. Brydon Carse is also in the squad.\n\nThere are consequences to this ODI series and the three T20s that follow. England need ODI wins to ensure automatic qualification for the 2027 World Cup, while the T20s are preparation for the World Cup in the shortest format next month.\n\nFor head coach Brendon McCullum, wins in the white-ball format may ease some of the pressure on his position. Captain Brook needs positive results on the field to move on from the controversy of being punched by a nightclub bouncer in Wellington.\n\nConditions that demand the bowling of and batting against spin are a historical weakness for England, and the task for the Ashes players was made all the harder given the switch from the pace and bounce of Australia.\n\nAfter the criticism of their preparation down under, England had only two training sessions in Colombo – this time no fault of their own because of the tight turnaround.\n\nThey can expect plenty more spin in the coming weeks. Their challenge is to adapt and improve quickly.\n\nA target of 272 was modest by the standards of modern ODIs, but well above par at this venue – only three times have more runs been chased to win a one-dayer on this ground.\n\nZak Crawley, playing his first ODI in more than two years, was out in familiar fashion – edging a drive at a wide one for only six, before Root and Duckett gave England a chance.\n\nDuckett looked horribly out of touch, swishing and swiping. The left-hander had 21 from the first 37 balls he faced, then found rhythm after two fours in the same over. This was his highest score in any cricket since the last Test against India in July.\n\nRoot, an expert in these conditions, was sublime, finding gaps and running hard. Still, even at 129-1, England were not fully in control.\n\nDuckett was lbw reverse-sweeping the leg-spin of Jeffrey Vandersay, Root leg before conventionally sweeping the off-spin of Dhananjaya da Silva delivered from round the wicket. England fell apart.\n\nSri Lanka found increasing turn, England found ways to get out. Brook ran past Chamira Asalanka to be stumped down the leg side and Bethell – who struggled to 15 off 32 balls – was stumped between bat and pad off left-armer Dunith Wellalage.\n\nAs England faltered, they were given some hope by Rehan Ahmed's 27, until he was brilliantly caught relay-style by Wellalage at long-off. Overton clubbed 34 from 17, though a heist never seemed likely.\n\nEngland named three frontline spinners - Jacks was replaced by Ahmed – and probably needed more. Bethell only bowled three overs of his left-arm spin, Root did not bowl at all.\n\nThe 33 overs of spin delivered by England was their second-most in an ODI. Adil Rashid was superb, dropping his pace for 3-44, while Liam Dawson managed 41 dots in his 1-31.\n\nCurran also impressed with his variations. At times he was almost bowling left-arm spin, and a 49mph 'moon ball' deceived Pathum Nissanka for England's first wicket.\n\nWhen Sri Lanka were 124-4, England had the opportunity to restrict the hosts, only for Mendis and Janith Liyanage to build a crucial partnership of 88, helped by some England errors in the field.\n\nLiyanage crunched two sixes in his 46, while wicketkeeper Mendis used all his experience and nous to hold the innings together. Time and again he showed deft touches to find the boundary behind square on the off side.\n\nWith Mendis as the fulcrum, Sri Lanka found 80 runs from the final 10 overs, an acceleration that would later prove beyond England.\n\nOverton's hit-the-deck style was entirely unsuitable to the surface and he went at more than seven an over. Wellalage took him for three fours and a six in a final over that cost 23 – vital given the eventual difference between the two sides.\n\nEngland in Sri Lanka 2026 - schedule\n\nEngland captain Harry Brook: \"[The toss] proved very crucial in the end. Sri Lanka played a very good game and deserved the victory.\n\n\"We bowled really well through the middle. Spinners bowled exceptionally well. But they got hold of us in the last over - but that's part of one-day and white-ball cricket.\n\n\"They've got extremely good spinners who were able to get enough out of the surface. They challenged us in a lot of different departments.\"\n\nSri Lanka captain Charith Asalanka: \"I know that are a few areas we need to improve, especially fast bowling.\n\n\"We knew that the first 25 overs it wasn't going to spin. Suddenly I think after the 25th-30th over it started, and we bowled really well.\"\n\nWhat is Curran's ultra-slow 'moon ball' leaving batters in a spin?\n\nWright stands down as England national selector\n\nSL hold nerve to beat England despite Overton's late hitting - as it happened",

According to Deloitte’s latest Football Money League report, Los Blancos have once again been crowned the highest-revenue club in world football — and by a significant margin.\n\nFor the third consecutive year, the club tops Deloitte’s global ranking after generating €1.161 billion in revenue during the 2024–25 season. That figure represents a year-on-year increase of €115.5 million and places Real Madrid nearly €200 million ahead of second-placed Barcelona (€974.8m). It also puts them well clear of the Premier League’s financial heavyweights, with Liverpool the highest English club in fifth place on €836.1m.\n\nCrossing the €1.1 billion threshold further cements Real Madrid’s status as football’s dominant economic force. What makes the achievement even more striking is that it comes despite a season without major silverware on the pitch in 2023–24. While trophies remain the club’s ultimate objective, the numbers underline Madrid’s ability to thrive financially regardless of short-term sporting outcomes.\n\nDeloitte notes that football’s three primary revenue streams — commercial, broadcasting, and matchday income — all reached record levels across the industry. Real Madrid were uniquely positioned to take advantage of this growth, consolidating their place at the top of the global game.\n\nKey contributors included revenue generated through the operation of the renovated Santiago Bernabéu, alongside income from participation in elite competitions such as the Champions League and the Club World Cup.\n\nThe central pillar of Real Madrid’s financial dominance remains its commercial arm. According to Deloitte, the club’s commercial revenue increased by 23% over the previous season, fueled by stronger merchandising sales and the addition of new global commercial partners.\n\nThe scale of that growth is such that Real Madrid’s commercial revenue alone would be enough to rank the club inside the top ten of the Money League — a threshold currently occupied by Chelsea at €584.1m in total revenue. This commercial strength also helped Madrid absorb a 6% drop in matchday revenue, largely linked to fluctuations tied to stadium usage and scheduling.\n\nIn short, Real Madrid’s business model is no longer dependent on any single income stream. Instead, it is built on diversification, global reach, and the growing monetization of the Bernabéu as a multi-purpose venue.\n\nBelow is the full top-20 ranking from Deloitte’s report, highlighting just how far ahead Real Madrid currently stand:\n\nThe latest Money League figures reinforce a trend that has been developing for years: Real Madrid are not merely competing with Europe’s elite — they are financially separating from them (at least from a revenue standpoint). With sustained growth across commercial partnerships, global merchandising, and stadium-driven revenue, the club has set a benchmark few others appear capable of matching.\n\nAs football’s economic landscape continues to evolve, Deloitte’s report makes one thing clear: when it comes to revenue generation, Real Madrid are not just winning — they are redefining the scale of the game.",

    "fullText": "Inter are making significant strides toward a sensational return for Ivan Perisic, with negotiations already reaching an advanced stage.\n\nAccording to Alfredo Pedullà, the Croatian international has given his total approval to a move back to the San Siro. Discussions with Perisic’s entourage are well advanced as the Nerazzurri seek a reliable wide option to bolster Cristian Chivu’s squad, especially given the ongoing uncertainty surrounding Denzel Dumfries’ fitness. Questions have been raised about Luis Henrique’s abilities too.\n\nHowever, the timing of the deal hinges on PSV Eindhoven’s European journey. The Dutch side are currently in a delicate stretch of their campaign and will face Bayern Munich next Wednesday in a crucial Champions League clash. If PSV are eliminated from the competition, the path for Perisic’s departure is expected to clear immediately.\n\nThe 36-year-old’s desire to wear the Inter shirt again is the driving force behind the talks, and while the Italian giants remain respectful of PSV’s current commitments, an exit from Europe for the Eredivisie club could bring the transfer to life in the final days of the window.",

    "description": "In a World Economic Forum panel moderated by Business Insider, robotics experts dove into how bots are going to change the world.",
    "fullText": "In a world of AI chatbots and agents, we're not talking enough about physical AI.\n\nAt a Thursday morning Davos panel moderated by Business Insider's Jamie Heller, robotics experts dived into ways bots are going to change the world — and their key limitations.\n\nHere are three takeaways from the World Economic Forum panel, which featured robotics and automation experts and a trade minister:\n\nOne phrase dominated the conversation: digital twins.\n\nExecutives from Siemens, Agility Robotics, and Automation Anywhere agreed that what once sounded like a distant possibility is now delivering real productivity gains for companies.\n\nA digital twin is a digital replica of a physical object, person, or process. They can help organizations simulate real situations and their outcomes, allowing them to make better decisions.\n\n\"Digital twins have been around, but the technology has exponentially improved, and the computing power has exponentially improved,\" said Automation Anywhere CEO Mihir Shukla.\n\nHe added, \"Let's say digital twins tell you that there is going to be a problem in manufacturing. You can proactively act on it. It has implications on your inventory. It has implications on your shipping planning.\"\n\nSiemens' CEO Roland Busch said that the productivity boost is showing up in numbers.\n\nHe said that the company's output is 20% higher and that energy costs are 20% lower.\n\n\"You have much, much faster and ramping up, you don't make mistakes,\" if you use a digital twin, he said.\n\nRobots can do work that humans are unable to — or don't want to — do, said Peggy Johnson, the CEO of Agility Robotics.\n\n\"It's very hard to hire for these manual jobs,\" she said. \"They're dull and dirty, and they're dangerous at times because you're lifting over and over again, very repetitive. It's kind of mind-numbing work.\"\n\nFaster progress in robotics means a better quality of life for the humans who are doing such jobs.\n\n\"The injuries are also another thing,\" she said about jobs that require a lot of heavy lifting. \"We have an aging workforce. A lot of young kids don't want to go into environments like this. So the older employees are also getting hurt more.\"\n\nThani Ahmed Al Zeyoudi, the Minister of Foreign Trade for the United Arab Emirates, echoed that robotics was the future of \"non-skilled\" labor.\n\n\"It's too difficult to attract new young people to start working on the construction,\" he said. \"Robotics is the main solution.\"\n\nBut building robots that are safe to use in human environments is also key, Johnson said.\n\nAl Zeyoudi added that financing AI is only the first step toward AI integration.\n\n\"Sometimes you have the money, but you haven't diagnosed the right solution to the problem that you're having,\" he said.\n\nHe said that the UAE's push for AI includes government appointments, policy development, and research and development, which was the \"main game changer.\"\n\n\"Many, many stakeholders are avoiding that because they say someone else will do it,\" he said, referring to R&D. \"I'll just copy and paste it.\"\n\n\"But when it comes to AI, it's too late,\" Al Zeyoudi added. \"You have to start working on R&D because you ensure to customize things to your own ecosystem, your own environments, your own conditions.\"",

    "description": "Business Insider is tracking what the fight over the future of capitalism means for your work, your wealth, and your world.",
    "fullText": "From Davos to Washington to America's high school classrooms, people are questioning the foundations of our economic system — and we at Business Insider are tracking what the fight over the future of capitalism means for your work, your wealth, and your world.\n\nPolls show Americans' trust in capitalism is falling fast, as daily life has grown more expensive and less secure. Our own recent survey of readers found that people are worried their wages aren't keeping up with their expenses, that housing feels out of reach, and that the whole system seems shaky. Many employers are leaning even more heavily into a capitalistic approach, deemphasizing loyalty and tenure in favor of ruthless meritocracy. Meanwhile, the US government has taken a more hands-on role in the economy, becoming a shareholder in several companies and upending its place in the capitalist system.\n\nAs questions about the state of capitalism grow, leaders are pitching competing visions of the economy's future. President Trump told a room full of CEOs, executives, and media figures at Davos this week that the US is reshaping the rules to make sure the country comes out of this period of transition \"bigger and better than before.\" Some are pushing for reform, like California governor Gavin Newsom, who called for a \"rules-based, competitive\" model at Davos. Others, like New York City's self-described socialist mayor Zohran Mamdani, want to rethink the system from the ground up — and have a lot of voters on board.\n\nWhile capitalism's future hangs in the balance, Business Insider is digging in. We're exploring how and why the system is being reshaped — by government policy, by companies, and by you.\n\nTell us what you think about the future of capitalism. Test your own understanding. And stick with us as we track how this system is evolving in real time, and what it will look like next.",

    "fullText": "For decades, McDonald's customers have complained that the fast-food giant reserves its most fun and innovative menu items for international markets, leaving its home country with the same predictable seasonal releases.\n\nAs frustrating as that may seem, there is a deliberate strategy behind this madness.\n\nMcDonald's tailors its menu in each country based on cultural preferences, ingredient availability, and what can be executed efficiently at scale. The same applies to limited-time and seasonal items.\n\nWhile menus vary around the world, a small set of core products remains consistent, including the World Famous Fries, the classic Hamburger and Cheeseburger, the Big Mac, McNuggets, and the Vanilla Cone.\n\nThis localization strategy reduces operational risk and improves return on investment, which is why each country maintains its own lineup with exclusive offerings.\n\nHistorically, McDonald's has taken a cautious approach to bringing international items to the U.S., testing them selectively and tailoring availability based on regional preferences and past performance. In most cases, localized items had stayed local.\n\nMcDonald's has revealed an entire lineup of international menu items coming to U.S. restaurants nationwide in 2026, marking one of the company's most ambitious cross-market rollouts in years.\n\nHere is the full list, with all items set to launch within the next few days.\n\nMcDonald's (MCD) first introduced its Hot Honey Sauce in Australia in March 2025, aiming to capitalize on what it described as \"the hottest trend everyone is talking about,\" according to a company press release. The sauce was later rolled out in New Zealand and Canada, each for a limited-time run.\n\nNow, less than a year later, it is headed to the U.S.\n\nThe Hot Honey Sauce blends honey with red bell peppers and cayenne peppers, finished with a hint of tangy vinegar. Alongside it, McDonald's is debuting three new menu items featuring the trendy sauce.\n\nHot Honey Bacon McCrispy: A crispy chicken filet topped with thick-cut applewood smoked bacon, crispy jalapeños, shredded lettuce, creamy mayo, and Hot Honey Sauce, served on a toasted potato roll \n\nHot Honey Snack Wrap: A McCrispy Strip topped with shredded cheese, shredded lettuce, and Hot Honey Sauce, all wrapped in a tortilla \n\nHot Honey Sausage Egg Biscuit: A pork sausage patty and a folded egg, topped with Hot Honey Sauce, on a biscuit brushed with real butter \n\nThe Hot Honey Sauce and all three new menu items will be available for a limited time beginning January 27 at participating U.S. locations and can be added to any menu item, according to the Snackolator Instagram page.\n\nAlthough the new products have not officially launched, they already appear on the McDonald's website.\n\nThe Big Arch burger debuted in Portugal in July 2024 and quickly gained traction, prompting McDonald's to expand it into Canada, Germany, Australia, the UK, Ireland, and France.\n\nDuring an earnings call in mid-2024, McDonald's acknowledged the burger's strong performance and universal appeal, which led it to accelerate its expansion.\n\n\"The pilot of our larger burger offering, Big Arch, now in three international markets, Portugal, Germany, and Canada, shows that we're listening to consumer tastes and delivering,\" said McDonald’s CEO Chris Kempczinski in the earnings call.\n\n\"We'll work with franchisees and partners to deploy the Big Arch faster into more international markets in 2025.\"\n\nFollowing its positive reception abroad, McDonald's tested the Big Arch in the U.S. at its headquarters restaurant in Chicago for a limited time.\n\nThis massive burger features two quarter-pounder patties, three slices of white cheese, crispy onions, slivered onions, pickles, lettuce, and Big Arch Sauce, all sandwiched between a sliced sesame and poppy seed bun.\n\nWhile the Double Quarter Pounder comes close, it's not the same. McDonald's is positioning the Big Arch as a more premium, value-driven option.\n\nIn Canada, a Big Arch meal costs about $12.59, or roughly $9 in the U.S. Despite the higher price, the company says the burger delivers greater value, an increasingly important selling point as consumers grow more cautious of their spending.\n\nMcDonald's credits the Big Arch as a key traffic driver in several markets, helping boost global comparable sales by nearly 4% year over year in the second quarter of fiscal 2025.\n\nAfter extensive testing, the Big Arch will make its nationwide U.S. debut in early March 2026, according to The Street.\n\nLike much of the fast-food industry, McDonald's has faced mounting pressure in recent years, particularly in the U.S. Slower foot traffic, rising food costs, and weaker spending have weighed on results.\n\nPrices for food at home increased 2.6%, while prices for food away from home rose 3.7% in the 12 months ended September 2025, according to recent U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data.\n\nMcDonald's making major drive-thru change\n\nMcDonald’s expected to bring back beloved childhood favorite in 2026\n\nFive Guys debuts alcohol and all-day breakfast\n\nDuring the quarter ending June 2025, foodservice traffic declined 1%, as consumers dined out less frequently, according to Circana. However, value menu traffic rose 1%, marking the first positive growth in three years.\n\nCircana also found that value-focused diners are 33% more likely than non-value buyers to purchase value menu items when visiting other restaurant chains, underscoring how aggressively consumers are hunting for savings and deals.\n\nIn response to consumers' cautious spending, McDonald's has rolled out several value-focused initiatives, including the Extra Value Meals, McValue menu, and $5 Meal Deals.\n\nIn March 2025, the company launched the Restaurant Experience Team, combining operations, supply chain, franchising, development, restaurant design, delivery, and Speedee Labs to drive innovation and efficiency. It also created three new global Category Management teams focused on beef, chicken, and beverages/desserts to further specialize innovation within its food products.\n\n“Value is rarely defined only by price,” said Circana Senior VP and Industry Advisor for Food and Foodservice David Portalatin in a statement. “Operational excellence in providing quality, affordability, great experiences, and convenience is what leads winning restaurants and their supply chain partners to greater success.”\n\nThose efforts are beginning to pay off.

    "fullText": "NEW DELHI/MOSCOW, Jan 21 (Reuters) - India's Reliance Industries Ltd, operator of the world's largest refining complex, is set to receive sanctions-compliant Russian ​oil in February and March after a one-month pause, four sources familiar ‌with the matter said.\n\nReliance last received Russian crude in December after securing a one-month U.S. concession that ‌allowed it to wind down dealings with the sanctioned Russian oil producer Rosneft beyond a November 21 deadline.\n\nLike other Indian refiners, Reliance will buy Russian oil from non-sanctioned sellers, the sources said, without elaborating on the number of February and March cargoes that the ⁠refiner has booked.\n\nIt is not ‌clear if the private refinery will continue to buy Russian oil beyond March.\n\nReliance did not respond to a Reuters email seeking comment.\n\nREFINERS ‍BOOST MIDDLE EAST CRUDE IMPORTS\n\nDespite Reliance's return, India's overall Russian oil imports are expected to stay subdued through February and March, the sources added.\n\nReliance had been importing Russian crude under a ​long‑term agreement with Rosneft for 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) for its 1.4 million ‌bpd Jamnagar refinery complex in Gujarat.\n\nThe European Union has said from January 21 it will not take fuel produced at refineries that received or processed Russian oil 60 days prior to the bill-of-lading date.\n\nReliance has said it will process the cargoes that arrived after November 20 at its India-focused 660,000 barrels per day plant, allowing it to ⁠continue selling fuels to the EU from its ​704,000 bpd export-oriented refinery.\n\nRefiners in India, which became ​the top buyer of discounted Russian seaborne crude following the 2022 outbreak of war in Ukraine, are recalibrating their crude import strategies, raising ‍Middle Eastern purchases as ⁠they shift away from Russia.\n\n\"We have faced instances where sanctions were imposed suddenly and we had to cut back,\" Srinivas T, chief operating officer, refinery ⁠and marketing, at Reliance, said last week.\n\nReliance had ramped up purchases from national oil companies elsewhere ahead ‌of time to avoid spot market disruptions, he said.",

    "fullText": "The Supreme Court heard arguments on Wednesday regarding President Donald Trump’s move to fire Federal Reserve Board Governor Lisa D. Cook, with whom the court appeared likely to side.\n\nThe New York Times’s Ann E. Marimow summed up the arguments before the court and reported that “justices from across the ideological spectrum questioned whether the allegations President Trump lodged against Ms. Cook — an unproven assertion that she engaged in mortgage fraud before taking office — were serious enough to allow the president to fire her.”\n\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh, a Trump appointee, offered some of the most skeptical questions to Trump Solicitor General D. John Sauer.\n\nKavanaugh went so far during his questioning to suggest that if the court found in Trump’s favor, it would mean the president could fire all independent agency officials “at-will” – ending the “for cause” legal requirement.\n\nKavanaugh argued “the current president’s appointees would likely be removed for cause on January 20, 2029 if there’s a Democrat president…then we’re really at-will removal.”\n\nBelow is a transcript of that exchange:\n\nKavanaugh: For present purposes, you accept the constitutionality of the for-cause removal provision for the Federal Reserve, and that is what protects the independence of the Federal Reserve. What, in your view, is the purpose of that independence?\n\nSauer: It protects the governors. Exactly reflecting the plain text of the statute, it protects the governors from removal for policy disagreement or for no reason at all.\n\nKavanaugh: What is the broader purpose of that?\n\nSauer: To preserve the independence of the Federal Reserve.\n\nKavanaugh: And what is the broader purpose of that?\n\nSauer: Well, there are a number of reasons that are discussed by the amici, and I think not disputed by us, which is that there is, you know, a long tradition of having this exercise of monetary policy be exercised independent of, you know, executive influence, and we don’t dispute that that’s what Congress was doing in that statute. And again, we are not disputing the validity of the for-cause removal restriction here.\n\nKavanaugh: And why is that independence important in your view?\n\nSauer: We don’t dispute the importance of that for many of the reasons that the amici say, but we emphasize that there’s a balance struck here. This is not an ironclad “you can never be removed.” There is a cause removal authorization.\n\nKavanaugh: But on that, in your position that there’s no judicial review, no process required, no remedy available, very low bar for cause that the president alone determines—that would weaken, if not shatter, the independence of the Federal Reserve that we just discussed.\n Sauer: We disagree with that, and I would point to the point you made that this is a low bar for cause. In a sense, it’s a very high bar.\n\nIt is a very strong protection, because it does protect them from the one thing that Congress was apparently most worried about, which is—\n Kavanaugh: But it would be in the view of the president—the president who might have a policy disagreement—and there’s no judicial review, and the president can just define it on his or her own.\n\nSauer: One of the strongest traditions in this court’s jurisprudence is the sort of presumption of regularity to the president’s actions that has applied to this provision, I think, effectively for 112 years, and it continues to do so.\n\nKavanaugh: Let’s talk about the real-world downstream effects of this. Because if this were set as a precedent, it seems to me, just thinking big picture, what goes around comes around. All of the current president’s appointees would likely be removed for cause on January 20, 2029, if there’s a Democratic president, or January 20, 2033. And then we’re really at at-will removal. So what are we doing here? What is—you know, we started—that’s why I started with what’s the purpose of the independence and the for-cause removal. If we accept all these—no procedure, no judicial review, no remedy—you know, that’s what’s going to happen, I think. And then where are we? So do you dispute that that is, you know, the real-world effect?\n\nSauer: I can’t predict what future presidents may or may not do, but the argument strikes me as a policy argument.\n\nKavanaugh: Well, history is a pretty good guide. Once these tools are unleashed, they are used by both sides, and usually more the second time around. And I think that’s what we have to make sure we’re—again, that can’t drive the decision necessarily. We have to be aware of what we’re doing and the consequences of your position for the structure of the government.\n\nWatch the clip above via C-SPAN.\n\nThe post Kavanaugh Warns ‘What Goes Around Comes Around’ If Court Lets Trump Have ‘At-Will Removal’ Power first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "Ukrainian interceptors on the market can typically fly at speeds of up to 200 mph, but they'll need to be faster to catch Russia's newer Gerans.",
    "fullText": "As the Ukraine-Russia drone arms race rages, hobbyists far from the war are pushing the limit for how quickly these small quadcopters can fly.\n\nA father-son duo in South Africa set a new Guinness World Record by reaching a ground speed of 408 mph with their custom, battery-powered remote-controlled quadcopter, the Peregreen V4.\n\nLuke and Mike Bell performed the record-breaking flight on December 11, 2025, the Guinness World Records organization said in a statement in January.\n\nWhile drones built for war are constrained by additional factors, the Bells' achievement expands the possibilities of how these devices might one day perform on the battlefield.\n\nIt also lays bare how accessible new war-relevant technology is becoming for civilians. The Bells documented their design and build process on YouTube, filming themselves using a 3D printer and off-the-shelf parts to create the Peregreen V4.\n\nTheir drone's design features a dome-shaped head and four propellers extending from the lower body — much like many of the interceptor drones available on the Ukrainian market today.\n\nThese drones, developed primarily as a low-cost way of countering Russian Shahed-type loitering munitions, have become a pillar of Ukrainian air defense.\n\nSome of the fastest interceptors available to Ukrainian forces can reach 200 mph, which is also the typical velocity of a bullet train.\n\nUkrainians are trying to push their quadcopters to fly even faster. Flight speed is key for these interceptors because they're designed to chase and crash into Shaheds, and Russia has been continually ramping up the speeds of its attack drones.\n\nThe Geran-2, a Shahed-type drone that Russia launches more commonly, can carry an explosive warhead for hundreds of miles at top speeds of 115 mph. Newer, jet-powered versions of Shaheds are estimated to fly up to 230 mph in some conditions.\n\nA major issue with faster drones is that their components tend to overheat when pushed to the limit — whether it's the propeller motors, wiring, or batteries.\n\nIn their YouTube videos, the Bells repeatedly recorded their drone or its individual parts catching fire during tests.\n\nDrone makers also have to juggle other design factors, such as the drone's aerodynamics and propeller efficiency.\n\nUkrainian war manufacturers face additional constraints: Their drones need to carry an additional payload — often 200 grams to 1 kg of explosives. They must also be maneuverable enough to pivot and catch a flying enemy target, and be mass-produced.\n\nEarlier this month, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said his country was already producing 1,000 interceptor drones a day.\n\nMeanwhile, the Bells' flight record involved a single drone that flew largely in a straight line.\n\nThe duo's latest certification is the third time they've attained the fastest-drone record. The previous holder of the achievement was Australian drone maker Ben Biggs, who built a drone that reached 389 mph late last year.\n\nBefore Biggs' record, the Bells' earlier quadcopter, the Peregreen V3, had flown at up to roughly 363 mph in the summer of 2025.\n\nIn 2024, the pair set a record of 298 mph with a similar drone design.\n\nGuinness World Records requires aspiring drone record-breakers to fly their device in two opposing directions and then calculate the average speed to account for wind.",

This ate into the president’s schedule and whittled away the notoriously light sleeper’s opportunity for some shut-eye.\n\nThe president swapped planes back in the capital and continued his journey, heavily delayed, to Switzerland. His second departure, just after midnight, is thought to have added a further three hours to his journey.\n\nTrump, 79, emerged from the second plane in Zurich on Wednesday morning looking frazzled, before slowly descending the stairs. Despite the setback, the president still made it in time to address world leaders in Davos, though his voice sounded hoarse and he appeared to have bags under his eyes.\n\nCNN White House Correspondent Alayna Treene reported that her colleague, frequent Trump target Kaitlan Collins, said his Chief of Staff Susie Wiles relayed the message that the president would be moving away from international travel to tour U.S. cities ahead of November midterms.\n\nWiles told the press pool that Trump’s new intinerary will begin in Iowa on Tuesday, where the president will give a speech on the economy. He will then visit a new destination “every week,” Bloomberg reported, citing Wiles.\n\nIt’s part of an attempt to reverse poor marks on affordability, a main concern of voters that Trump has sought to dismiss as a “hoax” cooked up by Democrats.\n\nTrump’s domestic charm offensive kicked off in Michigan last week. He toured Ford’s River Rouge complex in Dearborn on Tuesday afternoon before delivering a speech at the Detroit Economic Club.\n\nHowever, it got off to a contentious start as Trump appeared to flip off a person heard calling him a “pedophile protector” during his visit to the vehicle plant. According to footage of the confrontation, Trump appeared to point at the accuser as he said, “f*** you,” and then gave the person the middle finger as he walked away.\n\nThat followed another speech in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania, last month, where Trump rambled about the brazen U.S. capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro and called the affordability issue a “hoax” twice.\n\nHis focus frustrated senior White House officials and Republican lawmakers who want the administration to emphasize economic and healthcare concerns, three people familiar with internal discussions told Reuters.\n\nThe White House has been asked to comment on Trump’s revamped travel schedule.",

    "fullText": "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — The astronauts evacuated last week from the International Space Station say a portable ultrasound machine came in “super handy” during the medical crisis.\n\nDuring their first public appearance since returning to Earth, the four astronauts refused Wednesday to say which one of them needed medical attention and for what reason. It was NASA's first medical evacuation in 65 years of human spaceflight.\n\nNASA’s Mike Fincke said the crew used the onboard ultrasound machine once the medical problem arose Jan. 7, the day before a planned spacewalk that was abruptly canceled. The astronauts had already used the device a lot for routine checks of their body changes while living in weightlessness, “so when we had this emergency, the ultrasound machine came in super handy.”\n\nIt was so useful that Fincke said there should be one on all future spaceflights. “It really helped,” he said.\n\n“Of course, we didn't have other big machines that we have here on planet Earth,” he added. “We do try to make sure that everybody before we fly are really, really not prone to surprises. But sometimes things happen and surprises happen, and the team was ready ... preparation was super important.\"\n\nThe space station is set up as well as it can be for medical emergencies, said NASA's Zena Cardman, who commanded the crew's early return flight with SpaceX. She said NASA “made all the right decisions” in canceling the spacewalk, which would have been her first, and prioritizing the crew's well-being.\n\nJapanese astronaut Kimiya Yui said he was surprised how well all the preflight training paid off in dealing with the health concerns.\n\n“We can handle any kind of difficult situation,” Yui said. “This is actually very, very good experience for the future of human spaceflight.”\n\nJoining them on what turned out to be a 5 1/2-month mission — more than a month shorter than planned — was Russia's Oleg Platonov. They launched last August from Florida and splashed down in the Pacific off the San Diego coast last week.\n\nWelcoming them back to Houston were their replacements, who aren't due to launch until mid-February. NASA and SpaceX are working to move up the flight.\n\n“We were hoping to give them hugs in space, but we gave them hugs on Earth,” Fincke said.\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

    "fullText": "Las Vegas Darts Open: Brandon Claims Open as Hedman defends women's title originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nLas Vegas has a habit of exaggerating things. Lights brighter. Nights longer. Legends larger. And on the oche, beneath the neon glare of The Strip, Deta Hedman once again reminded the darts world that class doesn’t age – it sharpens.\n\nNorth America is becoming more a centre of focus for the World Darts Federation with every passing year. A glance at the rankings will confirm the growing influence of USA events and, in turn, dominance of their players. But they would not get it all their own way as the season started again after a festive breather.\n\nThe Open event brought a distinctly American flavour, and the final proved brutally one-sided. Tennessee thrower Jason Brandon turned the dial to demolition mode, whitewashing compatriot Alex Spellman 6-0 with an average nudging just past the 90 mark. Spellman never found his footing. Brandon never loosened his grip. Sometimes, finals end before they begin.\n\nFresh into 2026 and the reigning WDF Women’s World Championship holder picked up exactly where she left off, rolling into Nevada and rolling straight back into the winner’s circle by lifting the Winmau Las Vegas Open crown. At 66 years young, the Queen of Darts remains ruthlessly efficient, brushing aside America’s Cali West 5-2 in the final to add yet another major WDF trophy to an already overflowing cabinet.\n\nDETA STRIKES 10 DART LEG: Watch Vegas highlight from the World Champion\n\nThis wasn’t nostalgia. This wasn’t sentiment. This was elite darts, delivered with the calm authority of someone who has seen every trend come and go – and outlasted them all. In a city built on excess, Hedman’s dominance felt beautifully understated. Just sharp scoring, clinical doubles, and the unmistakable presence of a champion who still belongs at the very top of the World Darts Federation pyramid.\n\nBut Las Vegas is never about just one event. The weekend unfolded like a darts buffet – singles, doubles, cricket, youth tournaments – boards buzzing from morning through to whatever hour Vegas pretends is night. And naturally, Hedman wasn’t done.\n\nMore silverware followed in the doubles, where she paired with Anca Zijlstra to overcome Japan’s Kosuzu Iwao and Shiori Sato. Another medal. Another reminder that Hedman’s influence stretches across formats, continents and generations.\n\nThe Stars and Stripes flew again in the Open Doubles as Brandon Perez and Marko Silva edged out Canada’s Jayson Barlow and David Cameron in a tight North American showdown.\n\nThere are far worse places to spend a weekend throwing darts than Las Vegas. Fewer still where the trophies pile up, the WDF banner flies proudly, and legends like Deta Hedman continue to turn neon-lit stages into personal property.\n\nFor the full stories and \n\nDarts World subscriptions options include Print, Digital and All Access packages, as well as exclusive products and competitions",

    "description": "Business leaders and CEOs weighed in on President Donald Trump's highly anticipated speech at the World Economic Forum on Wednesday.",
    "fullText": "Business leaders such as Ken Griffin and Matthew Prince have already weighed in on President Donald Trump's highly anticipated speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.\n\nTrump said on Wednesday that he will not use force to get Greenland, but is \"seeking immediate negotiations to once again discuss the acquisition\" by the US.\n\nTrump's ongoing threats against Europe over his desire to take over Greenland have been dominating this year's Davos agenda.\n\nAll eyes were on Trump during his 70-minute-long speech, with billionaire CEOs — including Apple's Tim Cook and Salesforce's Marc Benioff — alongside heads of state filling up Congress Hall to hear what he had to say.\n\nHere is how some of the world's biggest business leaders have reacted:\n\nSpeaking on CNBC's Squawk Box on Wednesday, Citadel's CEO and founder Ken Griffin said Trump had an \"important message to deliver to a European audience that, bluntly, needs to do better. Europe's economic growth lags far behind America.\"\n\n\"The commitment of the American people to defend our country runs deep. The commitment of the Europeans to defend their countries — if you look at surveys of the population — is not nearly as strong,\" he added.\n\nGriffin said he thought one of Trump's \"important foundational statements he made with respect to the justification why the US needs unfettered access to Greenland\" was whether Europe would be there for the US if there was another war.\n\nHowever, Griffin said that if the US does decide to \"pursue this path\", discussions \"should take time and be thoughtfully laid out.\"\n\n\"Investors around the world do not want to see an escalation of the stress in global trade that has played out over the last 12 months,\" the Citadel CEO added.\n\nPeter Schiff, the chief economist at Euro Pacific Asset Management, said it looked like \"cooler heads prevailed at the White House.\"\n\n\"So if the US can't buy Greenland instead of taking it by military force, Trump will just hold a grudge,\" Schiff, whose firm managed $1.4 billion last year, wrote on X.\n\n\"While that is a major improvement, it also means that if we do succeed in buying Greenland, we'll massively overpay.\"\n\nSchiff also warned on X that a housing \"crash is coming.\"\n\n\"Trump basically admitted there is a housing bubble in the US. He also admitted his main policy goal is to prevent it from popping,\" Schiff wrote.\n\n\"But once you recognize a bubble, the worst thing you can do is try to sustain it. The sooner it bursts, the less damage it will ultimately cause.\"\n\nCloudflare's CEO appears to have commented on Trump's speech style.\n\n\"Last two times Trump spoke at Davos he stuck extremely close to the teleprompter. Not this time,\" Prince wrote on X.\n\nSpeaking on CNBC's Money Movers on Wednesday, the founder and executive chair of investment bank Moelis & Company, Ken Moelis, said he thought Trump \"made a very good case\" for a deal over Greenland.\n\n\"There was a real sigh of relief that he took military action off the table with Greenland. With President Trump, it's unusual for him to ever take an option off the table, so that was a big sigh of relief,\" he said.\n\nMoelis described Greenland as \"probably the biggest M&A deal in the history of the world\" and criticized Europe's approach to energy policy.\n\n\"You have to look at Europe and say their choices on energy policy have put them in the position they're in right now which is fairly weak economically and in a global position. And I thought he made a very good case for that,\" he said.",

    "description": "President Donald Trump used his Davos address to press for US control of Greenland, defend tariffs, and frame global politics as a contest of power.",
    "fullText": "It was a speech that was never going to fly under the radar.\n\nPresident Donald Trump used his Davos address on Wednesday to press his case for US control of Greenland, criticize what he described as Europe's economic decline, and outline a series of domestic and global policy priorities — from tariffs and credit card rates to the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe speech came after Trump's flight to Davos was delayed following a midair turnaround of Air Force One due to a \"minor electrical issue\" and a transatlantic flight on a backup jet.\n\nIt also came amid mounting backlash from European leaders, rattled markets, and warnings of retaliation that could hit America's biggest economic advantages.\n\nHere are the four biggest takeaways from Trump's remarks:\n\nTrump devoted a significant portion of his speech to Greenland, saying that the US does not plan to use military force and adding that no other country can secure the territory.\n\n\"I don't have to use force. I don't want to use force. I won't use force, Trump said.\"\n\nAt the same time, he framed US control of Greenland as essential to global security and openly criticized America's allies.\n\n\"All the United States is asking for is a place called Greenland,\" Trump said.\n\n\"No nation or a group of nations is in any position to be able to secure Greenland other than the United States.\"\n\nTrump said US ownership would benefit NATO, even as he questioned the alliance's reliability.\n\n\"This would greatly enhance the security of the entire NATO alliance,\" he said, adding: \"We want strong allies, not seriously weakened ones.\"\n\nTrump repeatedly returned to tariffs as a central tool of leverage, describing them as a way to get other countries to change behavior.\n\n\"Instead of raising taxes on domestic producers, we're lowering them and raising tariffs on foreign nations,\" Trump said.\n\nHe added that tariffs have enabled him to secure concessions that would not have been possible otherwise.\n\n\"Without tariffs, I wouldn't have been able to get it done,\" he said.\n\nAt one point, he described his negotiating style in blunt terms, telling the audience that when tariffs are on the table, the message to other countries is simple: \"You're going to do it fast.\"\n\nTrump used some of his most emotive language when discussing energy policy, particularly renewable power.\n\nHe dismissed green policies as \"the Green New Scam\" in reference to the EU's Green New Deal and called it \"perhaps the greatest hoax in history,\" adding that wind turbines ruin landscapes while losing money.\n\n\"Windmills all over the place destroy your land,\" Trump said.\"Stupid people buy them.\"\n\nHe also accused China of profiting from renewable energy by manufacturing windmills for export while relying on other energy sources at home, suggesting Beijing sells green technology it does not fully embrace itself.\n\nTrump said that parts of Europe have declined economically and politically — without naming specific cities or countries.\n\n\"Certain places in Europe are not even recognizable anymore,\" he said, adding that the changes were \"not in a positive way.\"\n\nHe blamed European governments for weakening themselves through energy and economic policy.\n\n\"They're destroying themselves,\" Trump said of European countries.\n\nAt the same time, he positioned the US as the central force in the global economy and security.\n\n\"The USA is the economic engine on the planet,\" he said. \"When America booms, the entire world booms.\"\n\n\"I'm working every day to ensure our military is very powerful. Our borders are very strong. And above all, our economy is strong because national security requires economic security and economic prosperity,\" he added.",

    "fullText": "Hours before President Donald Trump's highly anticipated speech at the World Economic Forum, Ken Griffin, the outspoken billionaire CEO of Citadel, gave his rundown of the US leader's key economic policies.\n\nTrump's tariffs have been \"a negative\" and have left the US economy in a \"pretty unfortunate position,\" said Griffin at the World Economic Forum on Wednesday.\n\nThe president's policy to raise tariffs on imports to the US has \"disrupted long-standing trading relationships\" and led to \"higher inflation,\" said Griffin.\n\n\"We've obviously increased the amount of cronyism in America as corporate CEOs have lined up in Washington trying to argue why their business should be exempted from tariffs, and many have prevailed,\" he added.\n\nCentral to Trump's tariff agenda is the promise that manufacturing will return to America, reducing US dependency on foreign nations for critical items.\n\n\"We have yet to bring manufacturing jobs back to the United States,\" said Griffin.\n\nThe Citadel CEO highlighted that Trump is clearly following through on the platform he was elected on and said that tariffs have had some of their intended effects, though he did not specify what these were.\n\nBut one of the main problems with US tariffs is that business leaders are uncertain about how long the policy will stay in place.\n\n\"I think people have a very hard time believing that the current tariff regime's going to persist,\" said Griffin. \"Before you spend hundreds of millions of dollars or billions of dollars to build a manufacturing plan, you really want to believe that the policy that is the anchor of that decision will be permanent in nature.\"\n\nGriffin also gave his two cents on Trump's immigration and geopolitical policies.\n\nNo country's borders should be open to mass immigration, but closing down the Southern border has meant losing a large supply of labor, said Griffin.\n\n\"These are people who did a lot of very, very difficult work, very modest wages, which helped to reduce the level of inflation in the United States,\" he said, adding that he expected housing and food prices to rise in the coming years as a result.\n\nThe bigger problem that Trump's immigration policy has caused for the US is that \"we're potentially losing access to the best and brightest minds from around the world,\" said Griffin.\n\n\"The majority of Silicon Valley is either run by immigrants or children of immigrants,\" he said, and their companies have created \"a tremendous number of jobs in the United States.\"\n\nSpeaking ahead of Trump's speech at Davos on Wednesday, Griffin said he was uncertain about what the US president was hoping to achieve by clashing with Europe over ownership of Greenland: \"What I can't understand is why are we fighting over a piece of rock covered by ice?\"\n\n\"We have frayed our relationship with our European allies in ways that I don't understand or appreciate, but there is a push here to get Europe to step up,\" said Griffin.\n\nDuring his speech, Trump ruled out using force to acquire Greenland, but said that he wants \"right, title, and ownership\" of the nation.",

There are two guys that can prove it.\"\n\nAmerican players each received $500,000 (£373,000) from organisers the PGA of America to compete in last year's defeat at Bethpage, making it the first time in the Ryder Cup's 98-year history that players on either side had been paid to play.\n\nHowever, some of the players said during the event in New York that they would donate their earnings to charity.\n\nWhile several of the world's top golfers were lured to LIV, Northern Ireland's McIlroy remained loyal to the DP World Tour and US-based PGA Tour.\n\n\"I think any organisation or any members' organisation like this has a right to uphold its rules and regulations,\" added the reigning Masters champion.\n\n\"What the DP World Tour is doing is upholding its rules and regulations. We, as members, sign a document at the start of every year, which has you agree to these rules and regulations.\n\n\"The people that made the option to go to LIV knew what they were.

    "description": "John Abernathy was tackled by federal agents in Minneapolis and threw his Leica to safety.",
    "fullText": "John Abernathy, a photographer from Minneapolis, was flat on the ground. He had the knees of at least one federal officer on his back. He heard someone shouting to put his hands behind his back, but his arms were half pinned beneath him. He was surrounded by dozens of officers deploying something ― tear gas, he thinks ― that made it hard to see or breathe. He felt like he could puke or pass out.\n\nHe feared what might happen if federal agents got hold of his equipment. So when he locked eyes with another photographer, he took his camera ― a Leica M10-R with a 28-millimeter lens ― and threw it, pitching his cellphone away from him shortly after.\n\nPierre Lavie, a fellow photojournalist, snatched the Leica by the strap and brought it close to his body. As he reached for Abernathy’s phone, which had only traveled a couple of feet, a federal officer repeatedly tried to stomp on it.\n\n“I had to Hungry Hippo my hand in and out to avoid my hand getting stepped on, and I managed to finally grab it and get it away,” Lavie told HuffPost.\n\nNews: Ex-Flight Attendant Accused Of Yearslong ‘Catch Me If You Can’-Style Scam\n\nIt’s a familiar scene to both. Abernathy, who previously did photography work for advertisements and magazines, said he set out to document the protests over Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s crackdown in Minneapolis and the killing of Renee Good “just to show what’s happening to whoever might see it.” Lavie, a member of the National Press Photographers Association from Dallas, had come from New Orleans, where he was also capturing ICE activity, to cover the unrest.\n\nOn Thursday, Jan. 15, both were outside the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building in Minneapolis, which has recently been used to hold people detained by ICE officers.When Abernathy saw what he called “agitators” ― pro-ICE demonstrators ― carrying bear spray, he grabbed a can from someone and tossed it aside so it couldn’t go off near him.\n\nHe speculates that’s why he was targeted by federal agents, who yelled that they saw him spraying the crowd, though he said they didn’t provide evidence to back that up after they handcuffed him and took him inside the Whipple Building. (He received a citation, but has yet to receive a court date.)\n\nAs he struggled underneath the agents, he fought to keep breathing.\n\n“I couldn’t breathe. I screamed my name because I didn’t know what was about to happen, and I also sort of subconsciously screamed ‘I can’t breathe,’ and right when it came out, I thought of George Floyd, and I thought, ‘Oh ****, this is getting real,’” he said.\n\nNews: The Past Year Of Trump Has Shown Us What's At Stake. HuffPost Refuses To Back Down.\n\nLavie, who has traveled around the United States in recent months documenting ICE activity, said officers working in Minneapolis are harsher than those he’s seen elsewhere, doing things like shooting pepper spray into the air intake of vehicles to force people out.\n\n“They’re very threatening right away, instead of de-escalating a situation,” he said.\n\n“Their unprofessionalism worries me as an observer because I just see it as a short distance to travel to having somebody really hurt,” he added. “It’s reckless and dangerous.”\n\nDespite suffering a chemical burn in his eye, wounds from pepper bullets and abrasions from hitting the ground, Abernathy didn’t rush to the hospital after he was released from custody.\n\nInstead, he set out to find his phone and camera, though because of the chemical agent he was doused with, he didn’t have a clear idea of who had scooped them up.\n\n“I found some guy with a bullhorn, and I asked him to walk up and down and ask if anybody has my camera, and nobody had it,” he said.\n\nNews: Trump-Appointed Prosecutor Who Pursued Indictments Against The President's Foes Is Leaving Post\n\nHe enlisted his wife’s help, having her use the Find My iPhone feature. At the same time, Lavie had passed the equipment to another journalist he was traveling with, who tried to find the owner using the contact information on the phone’s Medical ID.\n\nThe two finally reunited at a hotel where they met for the first time.\n\n“He hopped out of the car and gave me a big handshake and a hug and said, ‘thank you so much,’” Lavie said, adding Abernathy “was a little beat up, but he’s obviously a tough dude and quick-thinking, and he seemed good.”\n\nAbernathy went to the hospital after retrieving his camera, where he discovered the last few images he captured before officers took him down.\n\nAbernathy said he’s fine now, but tired and constantly shaky.\n\n“I don’t know if it’s a nervous system response to stress or something with tear gas or what,” he said.\n\nNews: DOJ Says It May Use KKK Act To Prosecute Don Lemon For Reporting On Church ICE Protest\n\nLavie said Abernathy didn’t stay down long, noting he saw him out making more images on Saturday, after being tackled on Thursday.\n\n“We don’t like to stop,” Lavie said.\n\nAbernathy noted that he’s never been tackled, handcuffed or pepper-sprayed until last week, but he will keep documenting what’s happening.\n\n“The world needs to see it, not just people here,” he said, “because the whole world has to come down on this.”\n\nWall Street Sinks As Trump Threatens 8 European Countries With Tariffs Over Greenland\n\nU.S. Bank Stocks Fall As Investors Weigh Credit Card Rate Cap Deadline\n\nVolatility Gauges Jump As Tariff Threats Spook Investors",

Last year, I threw a new year’s party for my children in the game, but apart from that I have barely touched my island since the depths of lockdown, when sunny Alba was my preferred escape from the monotonous misery of the real world. Back then, I spent more than 200 hours on this island. Stepping out of her (now massive) house, my avatar’s hair is all ruffled and her eyes sleepy after a long, long time aslumber.\n\nI half-expected Alba to be practically in ruins, but it’s not that bad. Aside from a few cockroaches in the basement and a bunch of weeds poking up from the snow, everything is as it was. The paths that I had laid out around the island still lead me to the shop, the tailors, the museum; I stop by to visit Blathers the curatorial owl, and he gives me a new mission to find a pigeon called Brewster so that we can open a museum cafe. “It’s been four years and eight months!” exclaims one of my longtime residents, a penguin called Aurora. That can’t be right, can it? Have I really been ignoring her since summer 2021? Thankfully, Animal Crossing characters are very forgiving. I get the impression they’ve been getting along perfectly fine without me.\n\nI take myself on a little tour of Alba, investigating all the things I’d forgotten I made. Atop the highest cliffs on the island I find a half-finished bamboo zen garden. Down by the beach there is a playground; I had a baby and a toddler back in 2020 and I was spending a lot of time in playgrounds. The whole place is testament to the extent of my homesickness during the pandemic, during which I was stuck in a suboptimal basement flat in Brighton: the island flag is a saltire, the island tune is the first couple of bars of Scotland the Brave.\n\nI check my bank account and find over 2 million bells in there. How the hell did I accumulate 2 million bells from selling fish and fossils? With the help of a further 99,000 bells of interest, I pay off the final instalment of my home loan, forgetting that there’s no real point in doing this except personal satisfaction. I am now penniless, but at least I am out from under the thumb of the Tom Nook financial empire. That loan-shark raccoon has got nothing on me now.\n\nThere’s a new building: a hotel perched on the end of the pier, run by a family of pirate kappa. Home decoration was never my favourite part of Animal Crossing so I am not exactly thrilled to be asked to put together new rooms for the guests, but there have been a lot of improvements to this activity since I last played – placing cute little furniture items and paintings on the floor and walls is much easier than it was, especially using the Switch 2 controller as a mouse. I throw together a nautical theme for the first room and discover that the rewards for this work are tiny versions of old Nintendo toys and consoles. I start mentally planning out a games room back at my house.\n\nRather than face all the tidying up, some of my friends have ditched their pandemic-era islands and started again, which involves a level of dedication to the game that I can only respect. There’s a new service – run by Mr Resetti, the angry mole who used to yell at you for turning off the game without saving in the early-00s era of Animal Crossing – that lets you wipe everything off the ground of your island, leaving it clear for terraforming and redecorating. It’s also now easier to make those outdoor transformations, as you can hold L to stick your character to the island’s invisible grid, making it much easier to place things like walls and roads. And crops, I discover. Did you know Animal Crossing has farming now? And food recipes? This was news to me. Now I make my mini-me a smoothie before my morning rounds of Alba.\n\nI am surprised at how quickly I fall back into the rhythm of Animal Crossing. It’s such a soothing game, with so many outlets for creativity. Much of this update’s new stuff is for people with more time than me – for instance, you can decorate entire new Slumber Islands with friends while your avatar sleeps, but what was always great about this game is that it doesn’t require much from you. You can spend a peaceful half hour every day checking in on your small world, or you can spend many hours creating custom fashions for your residents and tourists, and designing every square metre of the island to your specifications.\n\nBack in the 90s, Animal Crossing was a game born from loneliness: Nintendo’s Katsuya Eguchi came up with the original idea for the game because moving to Kyoto had separated him from his friends and family in Chiba, near Tokyo. He envisioned a game that fostered a sense of community, that families could play together. (You can read a lot more about this series’ origins in my book about Nintendo, by the way – it’s out in a couple of weeks.) So it feels very poetic that Animal Crossing ended up saving the whole world from loneliness in 2020. It’s taken me a long while to feel good about returning to Alba, and it’s been a surprise to discover that this game is now better than it’s ever been.\n\nMan was I sleeping on Dispatch. I played all of its eight episodes over the course of a week and I have never laughed aloud so often at a video game. A narrative game in the vein of the old Telltale adventures The Walking Dead and The Wolf Among Us, and made by many of the same people, it tells the story of washed-up superhero, Robert Robertson III, who is sent to work at a call centre and put in charge of a team of mardy former supervillains on a rehabilitation programme. The animation is superb, the characters and acting memorable, and the dialogue quick-witted. It would have made a great animated series, but it makes an even better choice-centric video game. Anything with superheroes is usually an instant “no” from me, but this is clever and funny without the boringly self-referential humour that usually infests the genre.\n\nAvailable on: PS5, PC; Nintendo Switch/2 versions coming 28 January\n\n Estimated playtime: 8-9 hours\n\nAmazon MGM Studios released a first image of Game of Thrones actor Sophie Turner as Lara Croft in the forthcoming Tomb Raider TV series. Angelina Jolie and Alicia Vikander were the previous two on-screen Crofts; Turner says she has been training eight hours a day, five days a week for the past year for the role.\n\nNewish independent site Design Room has gone deep on the groundbreaking 2008 parkour game Mirror’s Edge, in an in-depth history written by frequent Guardian Games contributor Lewis Gordon.\n\nAnother online multiplayer game was put to bed last week: 2019’s sci-fi mech shooter Anthem, one of the first live-service flops of the current era. It was made by BioWare – a studio better known for its RPGs. Its producer Mark Darrah released a four hour (!) postmortem video on YouTube, summarised here by VGC.\n\nA beginner’s guide to Arc Raiders: what it is and how you start playing\n\n‘It’s a loving mockery, because it’s also who I am’: the making of gaming’s most pathetic character\n\nCommodore 64 Ultimate – it’s like 1982 all over again! | ★★★★★\n\nA few weeks ago I asked for your most-anticipated games of 2026 (mine are here). Reader Ee simply responded with the words Fatal Frame – there’s a remake of the second instalment in this iconic Japanese ghost photography series coming in March. Nora picked out The Mermaid Mask – a “funny and creepy point-and-click mystery” – and TOEM 2, the sequel to a beloved black-and-white photography game. Andrew is looking forward to the interesting mix of characters in Resident Evil 9, which stars relatively defenceless newcomer Grace and seasoned zombie-killer Leon Kennedy.\n\nBrad is hoping for a new 3D Mario on Switch 2, as am I – Nintendo usually announces games late, so I think the odds are good. And I’m sorry, Maks, but the odds aren’t so great on this finally being the year that we see Half-Life 3, so I can’t share in your optimism. I’ve lost so many bets about that game that I’ve given up for good.\n\nIf you’ve got a question for Question Block – or anything else to say about the newsletter – email us on pushingbuttons@theguardian.com.",

    "title": "Forget the four-day workweek: Despite what Bill Gates and Elon Musk predict, the CEO of the world’s largest workspace provider says it’s not happening",
    "description": "Billionaire tech CEOs promise shorter weeks thanks to AI—but IWG’s Mark Dixon says automation won’t free time, it’ll just create more work.",
    "fullText": "Billionaire Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, Nvidia’s boss Jensen Huang and Elon Musk have all made the same prediction in recent years: The workweek is about to shrink. Automation will take over routine tasks, they argue, freeing workers’ time and pushing a four-day week toward becoming standard. Gates has even floated the idea of a two-day workweek.\n\nBut Mark Dixon, CEO and founder of International Workplace Group (IWG) CEO isn’t buying it. From his vantage point, running the world’s largest flexible office provider—with more than 8 million users across 122 countries and 85% of the Fortune 500 among its customers—the math doesn’t add up.\n\n“Everyone is focused on productivity, so no time soon,” Dixon says flatly.\n\n“It’s about the cost of labor,” Dixon explains to Fortune. The U.S. and U.K. are experiencing significant cost-of-living crises. At the same time, he says, businesses are experiencing a “cost of operating crisis.”\n\n“Everyone’s having to control their labor costs because all costs have gone up so much, and you can’t get any more money from customers, so therefore you have to get more out of people.”\n\nEssentially, companies can’t afford to pay the same wages for fewer hours, and they can’t pass the difference on to customers. So any time ‘freed’ by automation is far more likely to be filled with new tasks than handed back to workers.\n\nSilicon Valley’s loudest voices frame AI as a route to more leisure. The world’s richest person and the boss of Space X, Tesla and X, Elon Musk has gone as far as predicting work will be completely “optional” and more like a hobby, in as little as 10 years.\n\nIn reality, Dixon suggests that this scenario would only happen if there’s not enough work to go around, rather than bosses suddenly becoming benevolent. But in his eyes, AI will most likely create more—not less—work.\n\nEvery major technological shift, he argues, has followed a similar arc: fear of displacement, followed by an expansion of opportunity.\n\n“AI will speed up companies development, so there’ll be more work, it’ll just be different work,” he says.\n\nIn 19th-century Britain, Dixon recalls English textile workers protesting against new automated machinery, fearing it threatened their livelihoods, lowered wages, and de-skilled their craft during the Industrial Revolution. They were called Luddites.\n\n“They went around the country smashing up the looms to stop progress. But look, in the end, you’ve heard of the Industrial Revolution. That’s what came from those looms and factory production.” As mass production made goods more available, retail grew; More managers were needed to oversee the machines; The middle-class grew, and so on.",

His shocking admission that the move is linked to a personal gripe over being snubbed for last year’s Nobel Peace Prize has further raised alarm both at home and abroad, with some fearing that at 79 years old, he may simply no longer be up to the job.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to the White House for comment on this story. The president has previously described his cognitive and physical health as “perfect.”",

    "fullText": "Carlos Alcaraz admitted it was tougher than expected to beat world number 102 Yannick Hanfmann at the 2026 Australian Open, despite advancing in straight sets.\n\nThe world No.1 Spaniard’s third-round clash tested his rhythm early, even though he eventually sealed a 7-6(7-4), 6-3, 6-2 victory to reach the third round at Melbourne Park.\n\nAfter the match, Alcaraz spoke honestly about the challenge posed by Hanfmann’s level and pace on the big stage.\n\nCarlos Alcaraz said after his Australian Open second-round win that his opponent pushed him harder than expected.\n\n“I knew he was going to play great. I mean, I know his level, I played him a few times already. To be honest, it was tougher than I thought at the beginning.\n\n“I didn’t feel the ball that good. You know, the ball was coming as a bomb, forehand and backhand,” Alcaraz stated.\n\nAlcaraz’s second-round match saw some early resistance from the German qualifier, ranked 102 in the world, especially in a closely contested first set that went to a tie-break.\n\nBut once the top seed found his groove, he took command to close out the match in straight sets and keep his bid for a maiden Australian Open title alive.\n\nSpeaking further about his performance, Alcaraz acknowledged how he turned things around after a difficult opening frame.\n\n“Really, really happy that I got through a really difficult first set and then I started to feel a little bit better on the court,” he concluded.\n\nWith the win secured in roughly 2 hours and 44 minutes, Alcaraz moves into the third round, where he will look to build momentum and push deeper into the draw at the Australian Open, a title that has eluded him previously despite his status as one of the sport’s brightest stars.",

    "description": "The European Union could roll out a never-before-used tool known as a trade \"bazooka\" should Trump move forward with his proposed tariffs.",
    "fullText": "Europe is weighing retaliation if President Donald Trump imposes more tariffs — and it threatens the US's big global advantage.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron pushed to activate what's commonly referred to as a trade \"bazooka\" in response to Trump's recent threat to impose an additional 10% tariff on European countries unless they agree to a deal ceding control of Greenland.\n\n\"The anti-coercion mechanism is a powerful instrument, and we should not hesitate to deploy it in today's tough environment,\" Macron said at the World Economic Forum at Davos on Tuesday.\n\nMacron was referring to a tool passed by the EU in 2023 that would allow it to impose tariffs on imports and restrict services from the US.\n\nThe hit to services such as pharma, tech, and finance would be the new blow to the US economy, as tariffs tend to focus on goods. While the US has a trade deficit for goods, it has a surplus for services.\n\nThe US exported $1.1 trillion in services in 2024, according to data from the St. Louis Federal Reserve, and has exported more services than it has imported for the last five decades, making it the world's leading services exporter. The St. Louis Fed said in its report that it means \"the U.S. can specialize in services and trade with other countries, which leads to greater efficiency and more benefits for consumers.\"\n\nThe Bureau of Economic Analysis also found that the US exported $489 billion in services to Europe that same year.\n\nAlex Durante, a senior economist at the nonpartisan Tax Foundation, told Business Insider that these threats are \"uncharted territory,\" and Trump's push to acquire Greenland could put the US' international standing at risk.\n\n\"America really would lose whatever standing it still has in the world if it were to go forward and do something like that,\" Durante said.\n\nWhite House Spokesman Kush Desai told Business Insider that \"the Trump administration has kept its word\" on its trade deal with the EU earlier this year, adding, \"the EU's time would be better spent delivering on these trade commitments.\"\n\nIn his plan, Trump called out eight European countries that opposed US control of Greenland and sent troops to the country, including Denmark, Germany, France, and the United Kingdom, as potential targets for more tariffs.\n\nThose tariffs would be raised to 25% in June if those countries do not agree to the deal, Trump said.\n\n\"This tariff will be due and payable until such time a deal is reached for the complete and total purchase,\" he wrote in a Truth Social post.\n\nA Q&A from the EU Commission said that the anti-coercion tool is \"designed to be broad\" to allow for an \"efficient response to an individual case of economic coercion with minimal or no impact on the EU economy.\"\n\nIt could restrict access to European markets for US-based service exporters, such as Big Tech companies and Wall Street firms.\n\nThe trigger for this tool, per the Commission, would be a situation in which a country pressures a member of the EU into making a decision through trade threats.\n\nDurante highlighted the intellectual property issues; the EU could restrict certain IP licenses for US firms. It could similarly limit US banks' access to EU markets, increasing costs domestically.\n\n\"A lot of those sectors, in terms of the tariffs that Trump has imposed, have been insulated from that because of the exemptions,\" Durante said.\n\nIf Trump follows through on his threatened tariffs on EU countries, prices of affected goods would likely increase. The Kiel Institute for the World Economy — a German think tank — found in a recent report that examined over 25 million shipment records that 96% of US tariffs have been paid by US consumers between January 2024 and November 2025.\n\nAnd if the EU rolls out the bazooka, it would take time — the Commission said it would have four months to examine the allegations and up to six months to determine an appropriate response. At the same time, the Trump administration is awaiting the Supreme Court's ruling on the legality of many of the president's tariffs, which could limit the tools that Trump has for future trade threats.\n\nAmerican workers could also be affected, Durante said, because the anti-coercion tool would target \"natively American firms\" and reduce their market access and profitability.\n\n\"When you have this kind of tit for tat policy, the US threatens something, the EU responds, and then we threaten something else even beyond that, it could really get out of hand very fast and make citizens of both the EU and the US worse off,\" Durante said.",

Fink said that China's population size and different privacy regime could translate into a major data advantage.\n\nThat dynamic, Fink argued, makes collaboration among the US and its allies essential. \"I would much rather say that we need to spend more money to make sure that we're competing properly against China,\" he said.\n\nStill, Fink warned that the AI boom could disappoint if its benefits remain concentrated among a small group of dominant firms.\n\n\"The key to that is making sure that the demand only comes if technology is diffused for more applications, more utilizations,\" he said.\n\n\"If technology is just the domain of the six hyperscalers, we will fail,\" he added.\n\nFink's comments came amid a broader debate about whether massive investments in AI are sending the stock markets into a bubble.\n\nSome leaders, including OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, have cautioned about overexcitement in AI — even as they acknowledge the technology's game-changing potential.\n\nMeanwhile, Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates said in late October that AI was in a bubble.",

Security guards cleared Congress Hall after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink wrapped up around noon.\n\nWhile waiting to go back in to hear Trump, attendees, including financier Anthony Scaramucci and University of California chief investment officer, Jagdeep Singh Bachher, could be seen sipping coffee and eating saffron risotto Milanese.\n\nA French journalist approached me to ask whether Trump's threats were real. I told her I didn't know.\n\nAway from hype about Trump's arrival, Davos is still carrying on as normal.\n\nOn a panel this morning, Nvidia chief Jensen Huang described AI as the biggest infrastructure buildout in human history — and one he sees creating a jobs boom for those with the right skillset.\n\nAway from hype about Trump's arrival, Davos is still carrying on as normal.\n\nOn a panel this morning, Nvidia chief Jensen Huang described AI as the biggest infrastructure buildout in human history — and one he sees creating a jobs boom for those with the right skillset.\n\n\"It's wonderful that the jobs are related to tradecraft and we're going to have plumbers and electricians and construction and steelworkers,\" he said in a conversation with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink.\n\nHuang said the US was seeing a \"significant boom\" in this area, with salaries nearly doubling in some cases. \"So we're talking about six-figure salaries for people who are building chip factories or computer factories or AI factories, and we have a great shortage in that,\" added Huang.\n\n\"Everybody should be able to make a great living.

Now, there's another 75 miles to reach Davos, most likely by helicopter.\n\nCongress Hall is now being cleared ahead of President Donald Trump's speech.\n\nOne security guard told me the speech would be on time despite the electrical problems on AF1, but we still haven't heard official word from WEF.\n\nAs Trump seeks Greenland, insisting that it's key for protection against Russia and China, his allies don't actually disagree with his security concerns. His methods are causing great tension among his allies, but they agree that the Arctic is an area of risk.\n\n\"I think President Trump is right. Other leaders in NATO are right. We need to defend the Arctic,\" as China and Russia increase their presence there, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said in a Wednesday morning appearance at Davos.\n\nAs Trump seeks Greenland, insisting that it's key for protection against Russia and China, his allies don't actually disagree with his security concerns.

He expects tensions with the US to de-escalate, \"I think at the end of the day, we'll find an off-ramp on this.\"\n\nAfter an electrical issue on Air Force One delayed the president overnight, a replacement plane, a Boeing C-32A, was scrambled into action to bring him to Europe.\n\nAs of around midday Swiss time, the jet, a modified Boeing 757 often used as Air Force Two, was still in the air, flying close to Paris and heading for Zurich airport, where it looks likely to land within the next hour.\n\nIf, like many high-profile World Economic Forum attendees, Trump travels by helicopter from Zurich airport, it would take about another 30 to 40 minutes to reach Davos.\n\nThat could put him in the Swiss Alps just before 1.30 p.m. CET, and he is scheduled to speak at 2:30 p.m. CET.\n\nHowever, there will likely be further added time due to security and other preparations.\n\nIn short, we don't exactly know.\n\nNo clear indication has been given of what the president plans to discuss in his special address to the Davos crowd.

Still, Steinbach told me that Hines raised about 50% more discretionary capital year over year in 2025.\n\n\"There's a risk and opportunity, right? The risk is it's now different. And that's probably not changing anytime soon,\" Steinbach said. \"The opportunity is a lot needs to be built now, because you've got supply chains that need to get re-looked. You got very directive investments in-country.\"\n\n\"That's creating a lot of demand as well,\" Steinbach added.\n\nOn the schedule for Wednesday: Citadel CEO Ken Griffin, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates, Nvidia chief Jensen Huang, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks, and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff.\n\nTrump ran into some travel trouble en route to Davos late Tuesday.

    "fullText": "A PGA Tour veteran has sent a jolt through the golf world with a candid take on LIV Golf’s ripple effect. While many criticize LIV Golf and the professionals who play in it, Tom Hoge doesn’t. The reason – the Saudi-backed league has helped him financially in a unique way.\n\n“Well, I would say personally speaking, I’m probably the player that’s benefited absolutely the most from LIV coming along. I played well in 2022 right before LIV got going, which brought an offer from LIV, so I went down that road for a little bit. But, sticking with the PGA Tour and the changes they made, I’ve played in every signature event since they were established. And I would say nobody’s benefited more financially than I have cuz I’ve played well in some of those events and been in all of them,” Tom Hoge revealed in conversation with Trey Wingo.\n\n“So, it’s been fantastic for me. So, I shouldn’t be the guy here, complaining about any of that coming along. But it is tough for the game of golf that there’s a lot of great players that are on LIV that we’re not competing with against every week like we were.”\n\nThe 36-year-old PGA Tour professional from Statesville, North Carolina, stated that LIV’s inception has brought him financial benefits. However, he is not the only one. Many professionals on the PGA Tour have benefited indirectly from LIV’s inception. As former CEO Greg Norman highlighted, the Saudi-backed league disrupted the market, which was essential to restoring balance.\n\nBefore LIV’s arrival, the prize pools for PGA Tour events weren’t that large. And there weren’t many additional benefits that athletes enjoy today. For instance, the PGA Tour started its for-profit entity and offered equity stakes to golfers. The standard prize pool on the PGA Tour was around $8-$9 million. Then came LIV Golf, offering $20-$25 million per event. This put pressure on the PGA Tour to pay golfers more.\n\nThus, the PGA Tour started elevating events in 2023, which officially became the Signature Events in 2024. These events feature higher prize money of around $20 million or more.\n\nSince Tom Hoge performed well in 2022, he has been eligible to play Signature Events until now. In 2025, too, he was eligible for and played all Signature Events. He posted strong results in many of them, including T8 at The Sentry ($550,000), T3 at THE PLAYERS Championship ($1,325,000), T5 at Valero Texas Open ($304,000), T14 at the Masters ($336,000), and T7 at the Memorial ($603,200). These finishes underscore his claim of major financial gains from post-LIV Tour upgrades.\n\nIn 2024, he also finished strongly at many events. Hoge received $642,500 at the 2024 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am, $646,000 at the 2024 The Genesis Invitational, $389,666 at the 2024 Arnold Palmer Invitational, and $1,160,000 at the Travelers Championship. This shows that a large part of his official money came from the Signature events in both 2024 and 2025.\n\nWhile he enjoys the financial benefits, he also misses playing with some of the best golfers. Playing against strong competitors makes an athlete strong. Jon Rahm, Bryson DeChambeau, Joaquin Niemann, and Patrick Reed are some of the many gold golfers playing LIV Golf. Their exclusion from PGA Tour events influences the field’s strength, which also impacts the OWGR points.\n\nAlthough Tom Hoge is happy with almost every change the PGA Tour has gone through after LIV’s inception, he dislikes one thing that may come from 2027.\n\nTiger Woods’s Future Competition Committee (FCC) planned for a redesigned schedule from 2027. The new schedule will likely feature fewer events and may start in February instead of January. Woods and the FCC aim to mitigate viewership competition from the NFL in January. CEO Brian Rolapp supports this view and the redesigned schedule. However, Tom Hoge doesn’t.\n\nHoge told Golf Channel the pre-LIV model worked well. It allowed players to pick events freely with equal stature throughout the season. He praised past flexibility where stars like Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson elevated chosen events without a rigid top-heavy structure. If the redesigned schedule reduces the number of events, it will take away this flexibility. Therefore, Hoge opposed a reduced schedule. Instead, he valued the ability to take a month off or play four straight weeks.\n\nTom Hoge’s comments highlight how LIV Golf’s arrival reshaped his financial outlook while also changing the competitive feel of the PGA Tour. As golf moves toward another possible shift, his perspective reflects both gratitude for new opportunities and concern for what may be lost.\n\nThe post Greg Norman Was Right All Along as PGA Tour Champ Owns Up to Benefiting from LIV Golf appeared first on EssentiallySports.",

    "description": "In a client-server world, identity and authority are anchored in a server that logs people in and enforces\npermissions. When you take the server away, though, it might seem like there’s no solid foundation for\nauthentication or authorization. Is there a principled way to establish trust in a distributed application?",
    "fullText": "When I first started thinking about authentication and authorization in a local-first context I\nfound it super weird and confusing, like I’d stepped through the looking-glass. I found myself\nwrestling with big philosophical questions like “where does authority ultimately come from?” and\n“what does it mean to know someone?“.\n\nI’m going to walk you through my journey, from that initial disorientation to what I believe are\nsolid, principled approaches, in the course of developing the @localfirst/auth library.\n\nIt might not be obvious why this might be disorienting, so I’ll explain.\n\nWithout a server, it’s not clear where authority or identity come from.\n\nTraditional authentication and authorization ultimately “root out” in a physical piece of hardware,\nowned and controlled by a company that you’ve decided to trust. The hardware is a server that has\nyour username and password and rules about what you’re allowed to do. It might be controlled by your\nemployer, or a SaaS provider, or a big tech company.\n\nThe server is like a guard at the castle gates. If the server doesn’t recognize you, it doesn’t let\nyou in. If the server doesn’t think you should be allowed to have something, it doesn’t give it to\nyou.\n\nOf course, the whole point of local-first software is that we don’t love that arrangement.\n\nBut when you take away that central server, you’re losing the thing that all our notions of security\nare anchored to.\n\nIf all you have is clients, who are peers — which means they relate to each other as equals — then\nhow do we know who is who? How do we know who to trust? What do permissions even mean — who exactly\nis “giving permission”?\n\n“Bootstrapping” has become a word that we associate with something as easy and routine as turning\nyour computer on. But the whole point of bootstrapping as a metaphor is that it’s supposed to be\nimpossible: You can’t lift yourself up by pulling on your bootstraps.\n\nIt’s like living in a monarchy and realizing that the king is just another person, and not someone\nappointed by the gods. Just like countries making that transition from monarchy to democracy, we’re\nsuddenly adrift, and have to come up with completely new arrangements to solve problems that were\nalready solved — even if in a suboptimal way.\n\nWithout a server, it feels like we’re having to pull ourselves up by our bootstraps on some\nfundamental questions:\n\nIn 2020, a couple of weeks into the pandemic, I started work on a library that became\nlocalfirst/auth.\n\nI had to learn about modern cryptography starting from zero.\n\nI was immediately fascinated by how empowering public-key cryptography is, in the sense that it\ncan put me on an equal footing with even very powerful adversaries.\n\nThe movies would lead you to believe that defeating encryption is something a dude in a hoodie can\ndo just by typing really hard.\n\nBut in the real world strong cryptography can’t be defeated.* It just\ncan’t.**\n\nHere is legendary cryptologist and mathematician Daniel J. Bernstein writing over a decade\nago:\n\nFor most cryptographic operations, there exist widely accepted primitives that have been\nextensively studied, and breaking them is considered computationally infeasible on any existing\ncomputer cluster.\n\nThe point is you don’t need a lot of money, or computing power, or specialized equipment. Strong\nencryption doesn’t cost any more than weak encryption. It doesn’t cost any more to use a long\nencryption key than a short one. It’s just math. It’s just code.\n\nSo anyway I’m sitting down to work on this, and the first thing that makes my head spin is, how do\nyou know you’re talking to?\n\nWhen we collaborate or communicate online using a traditional cloud-based platform, we can think of\nthe service provider as vouching for us — introducing us to other people and confirming our\nidentity.\n\nIf I’m using Slack to talk to you, you know it’s me because Slack says it’s me, and you trust Slack.\nAnd maybe Slack knows it’s me because I logged in with Google: Google vouched for me, and Slack\ntrusts Google.\n\nIf we don’t want to put our trust in a centralized third party, then who will vouch us?\n\nIn a system where everyone’s a peer, then maybe peers could vouch for peers, in some kind of chain\nof trust.\n\nBut that chain has to be anchored somewhere: Maybe Charlie vouches for Bob to Alice, but who vouches\nfor Charlie?\n\nIgnoring the infinite regress problem for the moment, it seems clear that the solution will be\nsomething something public-key cryptography. But to do public-key cryptography, you need to know\npeople’s public keys.\n\n”Crypto is a tool for turning a whole swathe of problems into key management problems. Key\nmanagement problems are way harder than virtually all cryptographers think.”\n\n— Dr. Lea Kissner\n\nDr. Kissner was the head of information security at Twitter and I don’t think they meant the above\ntweet to be encouraging.\n\nBut I do find it encouraging. Even granting that key management is a hard problem, the idea that you\ncan collapse lots of different problems into this one problem is exciting, because you just have to\nfocus on solving that thing. If you can succeed at the key management thing — it’s is a big if — but\nif you can, then you can solve this “whole swathe of problems.”\n\nSo how do we learn people’s public keys?\n\nHere in Spain, I can obtain a certificate from the treasury department to install in my browser,\nwhich allows me to transparently authenticate to government websites and sign official documents\ndigitally.\n\nThe most obvious solution is to have some trusted party keep a directory of people and their public\nkeys, and of course that’s totally a thing that exists.\n\nThe certificate authorities (CAs) that make secure https connections possible are an example. Some\nbig companies have their own certificate authorities to anchor their employees’ digital identities.\nAnd countries can do the same for residents.\n\nThis is what my public PGP\nkey looks\nlike.\n\nBut we’re trying to do this without depending on centralized services.\n\nIf you want a decentralized solution, the alternative seems to be for people to actively share their\nown keys directly with each other.\n\nThis was the approach taken by PGP (“Pretty Good Privacy”) in the 1990s.\n\nPGP was the first encryption toolset intended for ordinary users. The idea was that people would put\ntheir public keys on their websites and in their email signatures. Apparently there were key signing\nparties where people exchanged and signed each other’s keys.\n\nFrom the looks of it these parties were lit.🥳\n\nIn 2014, Keybase had a better idea: People can just post their public keys in\nmachine-readable form on public sites where they have accounts, like Twitter or GitHub. They called\nthese “social proofs”. Then anyone can look up a person’s public keys by username, and use them to\nverify their identity.\n\nI’ve used Keybase to “verify myself” by posting machine-readable statements on\nTwitter,\nGitHub, and\nReddit\n\nThe first applications to truly bring end-to-end encryption to the masses were messaging apps. The\nSignal protocol came out in 2013, and two years later WhatsApp brought it to their entire customer\nbase, and overnight about a billion people were using encrypted messaging. Since then WhatsApp’s\nuser base grew to two billion and then to three billion, making it one of the most widely used\ncommunication tools in all of human history.\n\nThis succeeded because they made encryption transparent to the user. The key insight is that a\npublic key will never be like an email or a telephone number. It’s not a stable component of our\ndigital identity. Wrangling encryption keys is a job for computers, not for people. Devices should\njust generate keys as needed and we should never see them or have to think about them. Private keys\nshould never leave the device, and public keys should be shared automatically with other devices.\n\nWe’re agreed, then, that device-to-device sharing of keys is better than key signing parties. But\nAlice’s device still needs to know that Bob’s device is really Bob’s device, and not Eve’s device\npretending to be Bob’s device.\n\nTOFU considered squishy. Image: Yoav Aziz\n\nWhatsApp and Signal take an approach called “Trust On First Use”, or TOFU. Here’s how that works:\n\nThere’s a little risk there, they’re both taking a little leap of faith, but it’s a one-time thing,\nit’s probably fine.\n\nThat seems reasonable. The problem, though, is that the “first use” bit is kind of misleading,\nbecause in practice TOFU doesn’t happen just once.\n\nRemember, the keys we care about are device-level keys, not user-level keys. So what happens when\nBob gets a new phone, or Alice reinstalls the software on her laptop?\n\nWhat happens is an “account reset”, and at that point we’re back to TOFU — except that now, the\nattack scenarios are a bit more plausible: an impostor might have engineered the reset, and it would\nbe more feasible to exploit it.\n\nWhen a user has an account reset, the messaging apps suggest to everyone they communicate with that\nthey compare “security codes” or “safety numbers”. Most users don’t do this — I never have, I can’t\nimagine that people less technical than me do this.\n\nAnd anyway this is bad enough for a single pairwise connection; where this all really falls apart is\nin a large group, where the number of pairwise connections scales exponentially with the size of the\ngroup.\n\nWith a balanced PAKE, both parties need to know the password.\n\nSo when you want to connect with someone and don’t know their public key, is there an alternative to\nTOFU for securing that initial connection?\n\nThe most promising approach is to first share a single-use password out of band (in person, or via a\nchannel you already trust). There is whole a family of cryptographic protocols that support this,\ncalled PAKEs (for “password-authenticated key exchange”).\n\nWe’re saying “password” but it’s generally presented as an invitation code.\n\nIn the most common forms, both parties need to know the secret code; this is called a balanced\nPAKE.\n\nThe downside is that the inviter and invitee need to connect directly to validate the invitation.\n\nWith an asymmetric PAKE, a third party can verify the password without knowing it.\n\nWith an asymmetric PAKE (asymmetric because the verifier doesn’t need to know the password) a\nthird party can validate an invitation code without knowing it in advance or asking for it.\n\nThis brings us back to Keybase. In 2017 or so, they decided to try to monetize by building a\nSlack-but-encrypted thing for enterprise customers. They quickly realized that even if the global\nnerd population thought the idea of putting your public key on Twitter was really cool, Jim in\nAccounts Payable is probably just not going to do that. Sorry, it’s just not going to happen.\n\nSo they needed a way to bootstrap that initial key exchange, and they proposed something called a\nSeitan Token Exchange (presumably “seitan” because it’s not as\nsoft as tofu).\n\nThis is the approach I stole for localfirst/auth. At the time I didn’t know a PAKE from a hole in\nthe ground, but as it turns out this is essentially an asymmetric PAKE.\n\nWe’ve been talking about “identity”; but the beauty of this approach is that identity doesn’t need\nto mean “who you are in the world”, in the sense of linking to your real name or email or whatever —\nit can just mean “who you are to me“.\n\nRather than linking identity to a name or an email address, we link it to a relationship.\n\nFor example, in Ink & Switch’s Backchannel project one\nof the motivating use cases was connecting an anonymous source to a journalist. With a system like\nthis the source doesn’t have to have a name at all; the only thing that matters is that they’re able\nto interact once.\n\nTrust and identity are ultimately rooted in real-world relationships and interactions between human\nbeings. I know you because we interact, whether that’s face-to-face or online. That’s what it\nmeans to “know” someone. And we can use that interaction to bootstrap cryptographically secure\nconnections going forward. And if you have those secure connections with other people and I trust\nyou, I can benefit from your connections, and so on, forming a network of trust relationships.\n\nThat helps us clear up our thinking about identity:\n\nA. Real-world human interactions and relationships.\n\nThis feels correct to me: It’s natural, human-scale, and rooted in social reality.\n\nThe server-centric model roots our identity in getting distant corporations to vouch for us.\n\nWith this model, instead can we vouch for ourselves:\n\nAnd we can vouch for each other:\n\nIs it possible to have a secure, distributed access control list?\n\nSo now I have a way of knowing it’s you. But how do I know if you’re on my team? How do I know if I\nshould share this document with you, or if you should be able to edit it?\n\nOn a server this information is often recorded in some kind of access control list (ACL). So\nmaybe we need that, but distributed — everybody needs a copy of the same list. How would that work?\n\nMy first thought was that we could just put this information in an Automerge document and replicate\nit across everyone’s devices that way. But we can’t just let anyone edit this document at will. It\nshould be obvious if anyone changes the permissions, and we need to know who changed the\npermissions, and if they … had permission to do so? Do we need an ACL for the ACL?\n\nLet’s ignore that rabbit hole of infinite regress for the moment and focus on the mechanics. We need\na way of replicating a document that is:\n\n✅ tamper-evident: it shouldn’t be possible for someone to surreptitiously modify the list\n\n✅ eventually consistent: everybody should have the same list\n\n✅ authenticated: we need to know who has written changes to the list\n\nSo let’s look at some options for data structures.\n\nWhen we say “tamper-resistant” the first thing you might think of is a hash chain (or\nblockchain), where each link contains a cryptographic hash of the previous link, so it’s\nimpossible to modify one link or change the order without breaking the chain.\n\nThe problem is that this chain needs to be linear. Replicating it while ensuring consistency\nrequires enforcing a strict ordering; and cryptocurrency blockchains are famously … not optimized\nfor efficiency.\n\nTo accomplish this without burning enough fossil fuels to power multiple small countries, we could\nuse a hash graph. A hash graph is a hash chain plus branching. A CRDT like Automerge combines a\nhash graph with automatic conflict resolution logic to support replication with eventual\nconsistency. Git works the same way but with manual conflict resolution.\n\n✅ tamper-evident\n\n✅ eventually consistent\n\nSo far so good. But we still need a way of verifying who made which changes to our distributed\naccess control list.\n\nA signature graph is a hash graph where the individual operations are signed by the author. This\ngives us all three things.\n\n✅ tamper-evident\n\n✅ eventually consistent\n\n✅ authenticated\n\nIf you look at the work of anyone who’s trying to tackle this problem, you’re going to see some kind\nof signature graph: the Matrix protocol,\nDXOS’s HALO, Fission’s\nUCANs, etc. It’s a case of convergent evolution — we’ve all more\nor less independently landed on this data structure.\n\nThe way this works, concretely, is that there’s a series of operations on the group:\n\nThe first link, the root of the chain, marks the creation of the group and by definition adds\nthe founder to the group as an admin. It also includes the founder’s public keys.\n\nEach subsequent link represents an administrative action such as inviting a member, removing a\nmember, promoting a member to admin (or another role), or demoting a member.\n\nEach link contains a cryptographic hash of the preceding link, so the order of the links\ncannot be altered.\n\nEach link contains a digital signature of its content by the member making the change, so that\nits authenticity can be independently verified, and so that the link body cannot be tampered with.\n\nWhen I found a group, I am the only member and the only authority. I can decide to add members, and\nI can decide to delegate authority to them as well. Another member with admin authority could even\nremove me from the group.\n\nThis is a key point that we’ll come back to: In a group, authority is rooted in the act of\ncreating the group.\n\nTo be replicable, this data structure needs to be a CRDT. However, you can’t model group permissions\nusing a JSON CRDT like Automerge. I’ll explain why.\n\nHere we have two concurrent actions, but there’s no conflict, and we can resolve this by picking one\nor the other in an arbitrary but deterministic order. So far, nothing a generic CRDT couldn’t handle.\n\nWhat if someone takes actions while concurrently being removed? For example, what if Bob adds\nCharlie to the group and concurrently, Alice removes Bob from the group? Now we have a conflict.\n\nQ. Is Charlie in the group or not?\n\nIt’s important to resolve this correctly, or else Bob could circumvent his removal by writing a\nconcurrent operation adding proxy-Bob to the group.\n\nA: No. Removals always take precedence. We resolve that conflict by prioritizing removals. A\ngeneric CRDT like Automerge won’t be able to resolve this conflict in a principled way; it won’t\neven see it as a conflict. So this has to be implemented as a custom CRDT engine.\n\nWhat if two admins remove each other concurrently? (Or more generally, what if there’s a cycle of\nconcurrent removals?)\n\nAs a scenario involving two legitimate members of the group, this is far-fetched and unlikely to\nhappen. A more realistic and worrying scenario might be, for example, a compromised and revoked\ndevice trying to undo its revocation.\n\nOption 1: Remove both The logical conclusion of “removals take precedence” is to remove both.\n\nHowever, this seems unlikely to be the correct way of resolving the issue. It leaves Charlie\norphaned in a group without admins and creates an opening for a denial-of-service attack, where a\nrogue device blows up the group rather than allowing itself to be removed.\n\nOption 2: Fork the group Another approach is to “fork the world” into two parallel versions of\nthe same group: one where Alice stays and one where Bob stays. Then each member decides which world\nthey want to live in. This reflects the reality of a decentralized system.\n\nI suspect that in practice it’d be hard to communicate what’s going on to most users, and it would\njust be confusing and upsetting.\n\nI call option 2 the “Papal Schism” approach, in honor of the time when there were two popes and all of\nCatholic Christendom had to decide which one to follow.\n\nOption 3: Keep the senior member The solution I settled on is to let seniority be a proxy for\nwho is more likely to be in the right. In this case, Alice has been in the group longer than Bob, so\nshe stays.\n\nThe key insight for me was that the root node of a signature graph gives you an anchor for\nauthority. If I create a group, by definition I get to decide who’s in it.\n\nAt the moment of creation, Alice is the absolute dictator of a group with no other members: Alice\ndecides who to add to the group. Alice decides if she wants to delegate her authority to other\nmembers. She can make everyone else an admin too.\n\nThis delegates the right to remove anyone, including herself, from the group. But even once she’s\ngone, the authority behind any action — any addition or removal of members, any further delegation\nof authority — can always be traced back to the authority inherent in her act of creation.\n\nWe started with two big questions about how we find our footings in a local-first world.\n\nThe Seitan protocol that I decided to use, like any other flavor of PAKE, is complex and involves\nmany cryptographic subtleties. But any invitation protocol, no matter how involved, has something\nvery simple at its core: An interaction that takes place in the context of some existing\nrelationship.\n\nIn the beginning there was a relationship.\n\nAt first, it felt like cheating, or a cop-out, to rely on a “pre-existing trusted side channel” to\ntransmit this invitation. But it’s not at all. And it’s not a minor thing or an implementation\ndetail either — in fact, it’s the core of this whole thing.\n\nHow does Alice know it’s Bob? Because Alice and Bob had that interaction where Alice communicated\nthe invitation code to him, and Bob is able to prove that he’s the one she had that interaction\nwith.\n\nThe fact that this pre-existing channel exists at all is very significant; it only exists because\nthere is some kind of pre-existing relationship between Alice and Bob in the real world.\n\nSo, that’s our answer: preexisting human interactions and relationships are what anchor\nidentity.\n\nWhen you found a company, you decide who you want to invite to work with you. Depending on how you\nset things up, you might end up being removed from the company later on. But the authority to do\nthat can ultimately be traced back to delegations of authority you made.\n\nWhen you start any kind of project, you decide who you want to go on that journey with you, or if\nyou want to go it alone.\n\nWhen you begin writing a document, you don’t have to share it with anyone - you could keep it to\nyourself forever. If you do share it, the details are up to you: Do you share it with the whole\nworld? Just with your team? Just with one person? Whose input will you pay attention to?\n\nNone of this gives you any power over anyone outside the context of the thing you created: They can\nchoose whether to accept, and they can stop collaborating with you at any time.\n\nIt only recently occurred to me that authority and authorship come from the same root word.\n\nAuthority is rooted in authorship, in the act of creation.\n\nSo. These are the answers I’ve found to our big questions. I think they’re good answers. As it\nturns out, not only you can anchor decentralized security on something solid, but the foundation\nwe’ve found is something more legitimate, more satisfying, more human than a distant company’s\n“because I said so”.\n\nIf you’re looking to secure a local-first application, take a look at my\n@localfirst/auth library, which is a working\nimplementation of these ideas, including an auth provider for integration with\nautomerge-repo.\n\nAt some point in the process of creating localfirst/auth, I realized that I’d made a custom CRDT; so\nI extracted the machinery for creating, validating, and interpreting signature chains into the\nCRDX package. This can be used on\nits own to create an encrypted, authenticated CRDT with bespoke conflict detection and resolution\nlogic.\n\nIf you take any of this out for a spin — or if you have questions about how it works — please get in\ntouch with me — via one of the (pre-existing, trusted) channels listed below!\n\nThis library’s shape emerged from a series of conversations early on with Peter Van\nHardenberg of Ink & Switch. Peter drilled\ninto my head the idea that device keys should be generated locally and never leave the device, and\npointed me towards Keybase’s signature chains.\n\nMartin Kleppmann of Cambridge University has been very generous\nwith his time and expertise. Martin is the creator of\nAutomerge and co-author with Peter of Ink & Switch’s\nlocal-first manifesto. Much of localfirst/auth is an\nexpression in code of his theoretical work. Every time I’ve been stuck on something, Martin has\nco-written a paper that solves that exact thing. These two papers were particularly helpful:",

    "fullText": "When I swapped my iPhone for a Nokia, Walkman, film camera and physical map, I wasn’t sure what to expect. But my life soon started to change\n\nWhen two balaclava-clad men on a motorbike mounted the pavement to rob me, recently, I remained oblivious. My eyes were pinned to a text message on my phone, and my hands were so clawed around it that they didn’t even bother to grab it. It wasn’t until an elderly woman shrieked and I felt the whoosh of air as the bike launched back on to the road that I looked up at all. They might have been unsuccessful but it did make me think: what else am I missing from the real world around me?\n\nBefore I’ve poured my first morning coffee I’ve already watched the lives of strangers unfold on Instagram, checked the headlines, responded to texts, swiped through some matches on a dating app, and refreshed my emails, twice. I check Apple Maps for my quickest route to work. I’ve usually left it too late to get the bus, so I rent a Lime bike using the app. During the day, my brother sends me some memes, I take a picture of a canal boat, and pay for my lunch on Apple Pay. I walk home listening to music on Spotify and a long voice note from a friend, then I watch a nondescript TV drama, while scrolling through Depop and Vinted for clothes.\n\nI’m constantly contactable, I have no personal boundaries, and my attention span disappeared a long time ago. Since the first iPhone in 2007, smartphones have become indispensable to modern life, with the average person in the UK spending four hours and 20 minutes online per day. “Social media provides frictionless access to an infinite universe of mostly free digital drugs,” says Anna Lembke, author of Dopamine Nation. “And the algorithm tailors the experience for each unique brain, making it very reinforcing, while also injecting just enough novelty in the infinite scroll to overcome boredom and tolerance. All these features combined keep us clicking and swiping long after we want to.” Over time we develop tolerance, which means “we need more of it and a more potent form to get the same effect.”\n\nIncreased screen time has been associated with depression, anxiety and poorer sleep. But is it possible to live lo-fi in a hi-tech world? For a month, I tried: swapping my iPhone for a Nokia which I can only use to text, call and play Snake; also, a Walkman and a film camera. I picked up physical copies of books, newspapers and magazines; I used a London A-Z for directions, and hunted down my physical bank cards or tried to use cash. The only screen time exception was for work, where from 9-5 I used my laptop to respond to emails and write.\n\n“You’re going to look like such a performative hipster,” my flatmate Ben says, as I’m setting up my new devices. He’s right. I leave the Walkman behind, but my bag is still heavier than usual with my book, notepad, A-Z and wallet. I haven’t taken the bus into work yet from my new home so I follow a hand-drawn map to the stop and run for a bus. I stupidly didn’t write down the bus number but that one sounds familiar. It’s not the one, two friendly strangers tell me, but I can swap on to another at Angel. “We’ve outsourced our memory to our phones,” says Nicholas Kardaras, author of Digital Madness and a former assistant clinical professor of psychology at Stony Brook University, New York. “And unfortunately the ease and comfort of being lubricated by technology just means our human skills atrophied. It is use it or lose it.”\n\nThe bus is crawling. Normally, I would have looked up a different route. I try to message a friend back but it’s difficult having to click each button multiple times for the letter I want. “Hard work,” I manage. I read for the rest of the journey.\n\nOn my lunch break, my sister and I go for a walk around the park. When she leaves me to do another lap, I have an urge to check Instagram and my emails but I’m only getting the odd SMS. I’m craving the back-and-forth WhatsApps with friends telling me fun facts about their day. I feel a little unsettled, but I try to focus on the changing leaves on the trees. I have thoughts that wouldn’t usually have the time to surface. How stressful.\n\nAfter work, I go to see the saxophone player cktrl at the ICA. I’m a little worried about collecting the tickets without access to the Dice app I bought them on, but I show them my passport instead. I would normally join the throngs of people filming a song or two, so I could upload some blurred clips with poor sound to social media to show that I had a great time. But I can’t, so I watch him play, undistracted. Then a flashlight glares behind me, as someone films an entire track. I vow never to be that annoying person again.\n\nMy digital detox is starting to stress out my friends. Nicole finally gets through to me, saying: “I hate your dumb phone.” She’s been texting, but didn’t realise you had to click twice to make it send as an SMS not an iMessage. Another friend wants to share a dating story and texts: “Omg this is a terrible time not to access voice note.” And, when my landlord messages asking us to send pictures of the new carpet on WhatsApp, which I can’t do, Ben texts: “You’re going to be such a liability this month.”\n\nIn the evening, my date sends me the address of a pub to meet him at “for your A-Z”. I allow lots of time to decipher its tiny font and navigate my way there. He’s running late, so I sit by the fireplace in the pub and read my book. I look like I’m waiting for someone to chat me up. When he arrives, he shows me how to turn on predictive text, which is a relief for my very tired thumbs.\n\nAt lunchtime, I put on the terrestrial TV and watch Escape to the Country, where I learn about the housing market in Herefordshire. I want to cook myself an elaborate meal – for dinner, and also for entertainment, but when I get to the shops, I remember that I can’t look up a recipe on my phone, so I settle for tomato pasta.\n\nMy flatmate picked up a Nina Simone CD for me in a charity shop. I try to play it on my Walkman, but realise it needs batteries. On my lunch break I buy some (who knew there were so many sizes?) and walk home from the office listening to it. Spotify can be overwhelming with its hundred million tracks, so it’s nice to remove the element of choice and focus on the album as it was intended, not scrambled by shuffle mode. Rosanna Irwin, who runs Samsú – a collection of digital detox cabins in Ireland – knows the importance of analogue listening: she leaves her guests with cassette tapes she makes with her father. After reaching a state of burnout, working long hours in tech – first at Meta and later for a climate tech company – she visited the Danish island of Samsø with her husband in 2023, and found peace amid the scrappy phone service and incredible nature.\n\n“My mental health was very poor,” she says. “I was spending a lot of time online and I did an accidental digital detox on this island and came back invigorated from the experience.” She recommends a three-day retreat. “There’s a lot of science to show that it’s around 72 hours in nature where the true magic starts to happen.”\n\nI meet my friend at Vauxhall station, and we walk to a cafe for breakfast, then to Tate Britain. Camilla is pretty offline: she’s a doctor and doesn’t have social media. She rarely responds to texts and is maybe one of the most joyful people I know. But she says she feels so much guilt about not replying sooner and hates the fact that phones are like this ever-present person in the room, distracting you from being totally engaged with the real-life friends around you.The sentiment resonates with me; we both want to be more spontaneous.\n\nInspired by our conversation, I call Aakriti, who doesn’t live too far away. I meet her and two of her friends and we eat empanadas. On the way home, I have to ask the only man on the platform for help. The overground isn’t due for 24 minutes, so I wonder if there is a faster route. There isn’t, so I shiver at the outdoor station wishing I could book an Uber.\n\nIt’s tipping down with rain when I arrive at Canada Water, and I don’t want to ruin my A-Z to search for Rotherhithe Street. I know The Mayflower pub is on the river and ask a man at a convenience store to point me in the right direction. I’m early, so I squint at my book in the candle-lit pub, feeling very Victorian. There’s a hilarious waiter, who is telling dating stories from Grindr, and it’s much better than my book. This no-technology thing is making me nosy. I pay for my roast with cash, which feels almost fake now, like I’m in a game. Then my friend and I go to the cinema – the Picturehouse in central London, because it’s in between where we both live. They charge us £20 for a ticket, which I would never have paid had I known before we made the trip. I’m left fuming, but luckily the movie is good.\n\nI need to call the bank. My flatmate has sent rent money to my Monzo account, which I can only access on the app, and I get a text saying that I’ve gone into an unarranged overdraft. When I get to the tube in the morning, my Oyster card has run out, so I top up the credit and miss my train – I would usually have used a payment card on Apple Pay instead. I have to wait eight minutes for the next one. I’m flustered by the time I get to the office and feel stressed about not being able to check how much money is in my account or transfer money between accounts.\n\nThere’s a group of children on a school trip on my train. The teacher is trying to keep them entertained by getting them to play a word association game. “When I say ‘bread’,” she says. “You could say, ‘sandwich’. Let’s have a go. ‘School,’” the teacher says. “Prison,” a child shouts back. When I arrive in Notting Hill, I study the map at the station to make sure I surface from the correct exit. I memorise key landmarks so I know where to turn – the Gate Cinema is by the road I need to get to Uxbridge Street. I’m late, and don’t have time for mistakes, so I start walking down the street quickly, scouring every restaurant until I find the Palestinian cafe I’m looking for.\n\nThe worries I felt at the start of the experiment about getting lost and not being able to communicate with friends seem to have diminished. I’m calmer, and present when I’m with people. I look around the train on my morning commute and notice that everyone except one person has their eyes glued to their phones. The man opposite me doesn’t have earphones, a phone or a book. I try not to catch his eye, as I’m worried I’ve been staring. Things are less relaxed when I try to meet my friend Navid after work. We can’t pick a place to meet and he is frustrated because he can’t send me links: “Please return to WhatsApp you Neanderthal.” He’s late, so I wait outside the station for 45 minutes. He arrives with a big grin, knowing I’m a bit irritated, but I get my own back by torturing him with two hours of experimental jazz.\n\nAfter work, I go to see my friend Scarlett, who is being held captive by a corgi puppy. It’s dark and damp when I arrive in south-east London but I’ve written out the directions to the house as carefully as I can. I didn’t bring my A-Z because my bag was too heavy, but I’m certain I can’t mess up the 10-minute walk. I call my mum and we natter for 20 minutes before I realise I haven’t spotted the turning. In a panic, I ask her to look up my location on Google Maps, which is obviously cheating, but I’m now late and in the middle of a cemetery. I’ve gone completely the wrong way and she has to narrate the route to my destination.\n\nIt’s been a busy weekend so far and I feel like having a lazy day. I walk to a yoga class and then go for a wander. As I’m walking, and listening to my one CD, I get a call from the guy I’m dating who has just finished work. We try to hunt down a board game to play, but when the local charity shops fail us, we pick up some newspapers and magazines and the ingredients for a roast chicken instead. We then sit on the sofa playing music and reading in the old fashioned way. It feels like we’ve retired.\n\nI finally get around to calling the bank to pay my rent, which is late for the first time. I’ve been putting off the inevitable 20-minute call that includes reading out lots of sort codes and bank numbers and spelling the names of my landlord along with the various friends I owe money to. It’s quite unnerving transferring money without checking the details with my own eyes, and the woman on the phone keeps telling me that it would be much easier to do this online.\n\nFor all the frustrations of the month, I’m sad the experiment is over. I’m left with the feeling that living offline puts other people out: if we’re looking for a place to eat or a pub to go to it’s down to them, they’re on map duty, and I’m not able to book Ubers. But I was happier and calmer – relieved of the endless scrolling, waiting for texts back, and the need to communicate with people all the time. After about a week, I wasn’t reaching for my phone and I had the patience to read. It was nice not to be able to look at my work emails in the evening. I’m determined to delete my main distractions: Depop, Hinge and Instagram. Scouring charity shops for clothes is much more satisfying; dating with no distractions is so much easier; and I can live without reels about botched Botox and AI animals. “Big tech platforms are not addictive accidentally, they’re addictive by design,” says Kardaras. “They’re selling their product by targeting the vulnerable: if the algorithm detects that a young person has a body image issue or is struggling with self-harm or depression, then they bombard them with content on that subject that exacerbates their mental unwellness.” On my last day, I get an email from Scarlett: “Splashed my phone with water whilst listening to the Lily Allen album in the bath, now phoneless and actually want to copy you.” It seems I’m not the only one keen to disconnect.",

    "description": "A new report warns the U.S. could lose the ability to sustain combat within weeks of a China war over Taiwan, as munitions run dry, logistics collapse and global markets face a $10T shock.",
    "fullText": "FIRST ON FOX: The Trump administration asked for redactions to a sweeping new Heritage Foundation report modeling a potential U.S.–China war over Taiwan, even though the analysis relied entirely on publicly available, unclassified data, according to the report’s authors.\n\nThe redacted report, TIDALWAVE, warns that the United States could reach a breaking point within weeks of a high‑intensity conflict with China — conclusions that the authors say prompted senior national security officials to seek redactions over concerns adversaries could exploit the findings or use them to identify U.S. and allied military vulnerabilities.\n\nThose conclusions include warnings that U.S. forces would culminate far sooner than China, suffer catastrophic losses to aircraft and sustainment infrastructure in the Pacific, and still fail to prevent a global economic shock estimated at roughly $10 trillion, nearly a tenth of global GDP.\n\nSKIES AT STAKE: INSIDE THE US-CHINA RACE FOR AIR DOMINANCE\n\nAccording to the report's authors, the AI‑enabled model drew exclusively on open‑source government, academic, industry and commercial information. An unredacted version of the report was provided to authorized U.S. government recipients for internal use.\n\nUnlike traditional tabletop war games, TIDALWAVE employs an AI‑enabled model that runs thousands of iterations, tracking how losses in platforms, munitions, and fuel compound over time and drive cascading operational failure early in the conflict.\n\nAccording to a Heritage spokesperson, the report had been shown to \"high-level national security officials\" who requested some of the specifics be crossed out in black ink before its release to the public. The report still details how quickly U.S. forces could reach a breaking point and why the conflict would carry global consequences.\n\n\"Redactions were made at the request of the U.S. government to prevent disclosure of information that could reasonably enable an adversary to (1) re mediate or ‘close’ critical vulnerabilities that the United States and its allies could otherwise exploit, or (2) identify or exploit U.S. and allied vulnerabilities in ways that could degrade operational endurance, resilience, or deterrence,\" the report said.\n\nA Department of War spokesperson declined to comment on discussions surrounding TIDALWAVE's publication, but added: \"The Department of War does not endorse, validate, or adjudicate third-party analyses, nor do we engage publicly on hypothetical conflict modeling. As a general matter, we take seriously the protection of information that, if aggregated or contextualized, could have implications for operational security.\"\n\nThe White House could not be reached for comment.\n\nAccording to the report’s redacted findings, the U.S. would culminate in less than half the time required for the People's Republic of China in a high-intensity conflict. Culmination is defined as the point at which a force becomes incapable of continuing operations due to the loss of platforms, ammunition and/or fuel.\n\nThe report is explicit that the first 30 days to 60 days of a U.S.-China war determine its long-term shape and outcome, as early losses in aircraft, ships, fuel throughput and munitions rapidly compound and cannot be recovered on operationally relevant timelines.\n\nThe report concludes that the U.S. is not equipped nor arrayed to protect and sustain the Joint Force in a conflict with China in the Indo-Pacific. Rapid platform attrition, brittle logistics, concentrated basing and insufficient industrial surge capacity combine to force an early operational breaking point for American forces.\n\nThe report warns that U.S. reliance on a few large, concentrated forward bases — particularly in Japan and Guam — leaves American airpower dangerously exposed to Chinese missile forces.\n\nIn multiple scenarios, up to 90% of U.S. and allied aircraft positioned at major forward bases are destroyed on the ground during the opening phase of the conflict, as runways, fuel depots, command facilities and parked aircraft are hit simultaneously.\n\nThe report finds that critical U.S. precision‑guided munitions — including long‑range anti‑ship missiles, air‑to‑air interceptors and missile‑defense systems — begin to be unavailable within five to seven days of major combat operations. Across most scenarios, those critical munitions are completely exhausted within 35 days to 40 days, leaving U.S. forces unable to sustain high‑tempo combat.\n\nFuel emerges as the most decisive vulnerability of all. The report makes a critical distinction: the U.S. does not run out of fuel in most scenarios — it loses the ability to move fuel under fire.\n\nCHINA’S MISSILE SURGE PUTS EVERY US BASE IN THE PACIFIC AT RISK — AND THE WINDOW TO RESPOND IS CLOSING\n\nChinese doctrine explicitly prioritizes attacks on logistics vessels, ports, pipelines and replenishment tankers. Even limited tanker losses, port disruptions or pipeline severance are sufficient to drive fuel throughput below survivable levels, forcing commanders to sharply curtail air and naval operations despite fuel remaining in aggregate stockpiles.\n\nChinese ammunition stockpiles of critical munitions begin to be depleted after approximately 20 days to 30 days of major combat operations. However, substitution effects extend China’s ability to sustain combat operations out to months — well beyond the point at which U.S. forces culminate, according to the report.\n\nThe consequences extend far beyond the battlefield.\n\nThe redacted report concludes the U.S. is highly unlikely to prevent massive global economic fallout once a Taiwan conflict begins.\n\nDisruption of shipping lanes, destruction of critical infrastructure and the collapse of Taiwan’s semiconductor production would trigger a global economic shock estimated at roughly $10 trillion, with enduring ripple effects across financial markets, manufacturing and global trade.\n\nThe report comes amid years of concern over U.S. military readiness and industrial capacity, as China rapidly expands its naval forces and shipbuilding base.\n\nThe U.S. Navy operates a smaller fleet than planned, while American shipyards face workforce shortages, aging infrastructure and chronic delays — even as China, the world’s largest shipbuilder, continues to outpace the U.S. in producing new naval hulls.\n\nWar Secretary Pete Hegseth and other military leaders have vowed to put the Pentagon on a wartime footing for industrial capacity.\n\nPerhaps most alarming, TIDALWAVE warns that the scale of losses in the Indo‑Pacific would leave the U.S. unable to deter or respond effectively to a second major conflict elsewhere in the world.\n\nA war over Taiwan could open the door to follow‑on aggression by adversaries such as Russia, Iran or North Korea, fundamentally destabilizing the global security order.\n\nThe report is blunt in its assessment: existing Pentagon programs and congressional funding are too slow, too fragmented and too modest to address the scale of the challenge. In many cases, the timeline required to fix critical vulnerabilities exceeds the likely timeline to conflict.\n\nTo avoid what the authors describe as a strategic defeat, the report urges Congress to immediately expand munitions stockpiles, strengthen fuel reserves and distribution infrastructure, harden and disperse forward bases, and accelerate sustainment and logistics reforms. Without rapid action, the authors warn, the U.S. risks entering a conflict it is structurally unprepared to fight or sustain.\n\nWith intelligence warnings mounting that China could move on Taiwan before the end of the decade, TIDALWAVE cautions that the window to correct these deficiencies may be closing faster than Washington is prepared to act.",
