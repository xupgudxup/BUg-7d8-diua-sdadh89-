    "description": "Los Blancos have once again been crowned the highest-revenue club in world football according to Deloitte",
    "fullText": "Real Madrid continue to operate in a financial stratosphere of their own. According to Deloitte’s latest Football Money League report, Los Blancos have once again been crowned the highest-revenue club in world football — and by a significant margin.\n\nFor the third consecutive year, the club tops Deloitte’s global ranking after generating €1.161 billion in revenue during the 2024–25 season. That figure represents a year-on-year increase of €115.5 million and places Real Madrid nearly €200 million ahead of second-placed Barcelona (€974.8m). It also puts them well clear of the Premier League’s financial heavyweights, with Liverpool the highest English club in fifth place on €836.1m.\n\nCrossing the €1.1 billion threshold further cements Real Madrid’s status as football’s dominant economic force. What makes the achievement even more striking is that it comes despite a season without major silverware on the pitch in 2023–24. While trophies remain the club’s ultimate objective, the numbers underline Madrid’s ability to thrive financially regardless of short-term sporting outcomes.\n\nDeloitte notes that football’s three primary revenue streams — commercial, broadcasting, and matchday income — all reached record levels across the industry. Real Madrid were uniquely positioned to take advantage of this growth, consolidating their place at the top of the global game.\n\nKey contributors included revenue generated through the operation of the renovated Santiago Bernabéu, alongside income from participation in elite competitions such as the Champions League and the Club World Cup.\n\nThe central pillar of Real Madrid’s financial dominance remains its commercial arm. According to Deloitte, the club’s commercial revenue increased by 23% over the previous season, fueled by stronger merchandising sales and the addition of new global commercial partners.\n\nThe scale of that growth is such that Real Madrid’s commercial revenue alone would be enough to rank the club inside the top ten of the Money League — a threshold currently occupied by Chelsea at €584.1m in total revenue. This commercial strength also helped Madrid absorb a 6% drop in matchday revenue, largely linked to fluctuations tied to stadium usage and scheduling.\n\nIn short, Real Madrid’s business model is no longer dependent on any single income stream. Instead, it is built on diversification, global reach, and the growing monetization of the Bernabéu as a multi-purpose venue.\n\nBelow is the full top-20 ranking from Deloitte’s report, highlighting just how far ahead Real Madrid currently stand:\n\nThe latest Money League figures reinforce a trend that has been developing for years: Real Madrid are not merely competing with Europe’s elite — they are financially separating from them (at least from a revenue standpoint). With sustained growth across commercial partnerships, global merchandising, and stadium-driven revenue, the club has set a benchmark few others appear capable of matching.\n\nAs football’s economic landscape continues to evolve, Deloitte’s report makes one thing clear: when it comes to revenue generation, Real Madrid are not just winning — they are redefining the scale of the game.",

    "fullText": "Inter are making significant strides toward a sensational return for Ivan Perisic, with negotiations already reaching an advanced stage.\n\nAccording to Alfredo Pedullà, the Croatian international has given his total approval to a move back to the San Siro. Discussions with Perisic’s entourage are well advanced as the Nerazzurri seek a reliable wide option to bolster Cristian Chivu’s squad, especially given the ongoing uncertainty surrounding Denzel Dumfries’ fitness. Questions have been raised about Luis Henrique’s abilities too.\n\nHowever, the timing of the deal hinges on PSV Eindhoven’s European journey. The Dutch side are currently in a delicate stretch of their campaign and will face Bayern Munich next Wednesday in a crucial Champions League clash. If PSV are eliminated from the competition, the path for Perisic’s departure is expected to clear immediately.\n\nThe 36-year-old’s desire to wear the Inter shirt again is the driving force behind the talks, and while the Italian giants remain respectful of PSV’s current commitments, an exit from Europe for the Eredivisie club could bring the transfer to life in the final days of the window.",

    "description": "In a World Economic Forum panel moderated by Business Insider, robotics experts dove into how bots are going to change the world.",
    "fullText": "In a world of AI chatbots and agents, we're not talking enough about physical AI.\n\nAt a Thursday morning Davos panel moderated by Business Insider's Jamie Heller, robotics experts dived into ways bots are going to change the world — and their key limitations.\n\nHere are three takeaways from the World Economic Forum panel, which featured robotics and automation experts and a trade minister:\n\nOne phrase dominated the conversation: digital twins.\n\nExecutives from Siemens, Agility Robotics, and Automation Anywhere agreed that what once sounded like a distant possibility is now delivering real productivity gains for companies.\n\nA digital twin is a digital replica of a physical object, person, or process. They can help organizations simulate real situations and their outcomes, allowing them to make better decisions.\n\n\"Digital twins have been around, but the technology has exponentially improved, and the computing power has exponentially improved,\" said Automation Anywhere CEO Mihir Shukla.\n\nHe added, \"Let's say digital twins tell you that there is going to be a problem in manufacturing. You can proactively act on it. It has implications on your inventory. It has implications on your shipping planning.\"\n\nSiemens' CEO Roland Busch said that the productivity boost is showing up in numbers.\n\nHe said that the company's output is 20% higher and that energy costs are 20% lower.\n\n\"You have much, much faster and ramping up, you don't make mistakes,\" if you use a digital twin, he said.\n\nRobots can do work that humans are unable to — or don't want to — do, said Peggy Johnson, the CEO of Agility Robotics.\n\n\"It's very hard to hire for these manual jobs,\" she said. \"They're dull and dirty, and they're dangerous at times because you're lifting over and over again, very repetitive. It's kind of mind-numbing work.\"\n\nFaster progress in robotics means a better quality of life for the humans who are doing such jobs.\n\n\"The injuries are also another thing,\" she said about jobs that require a lot of heavy lifting. \"We have an aging workforce. A lot of young kids don't want to go into environments like this. So the older employees are also getting hurt more.\"\n\nThani Ahmed Al Zeyoudi, the Minister of Foreign Trade for the United Arab Emirates, echoed that robotics was the future of \"non-skilled\" labor.\n\n\"It's too difficult to attract new young people to start working on the construction,\" he said. \"Robotics is the main solution.\"\n\nBut building robots that are safe to use in human environments is also key, Johnson said.\n\nAl Zeyoudi added that financing AI is only the first step toward AI integration.\n\n\"Sometimes you have the money, but you haven't diagnosed the right solution to the problem that you're having,\" he said.\n\nHe said that the UAE's push for AI includes government appointments, policy development, and research and development, which was the \"main game changer.\"\n\n\"Many, many stakeholders are avoiding that because they say someone else will do it,\" he said, referring to R&D. \"I'll just copy and paste it.\"\n\n\"But when it comes to AI, it's too late,\" Al Zeyoudi added. \"You have to start working on R&D because you ensure to customize things to your own ecosystem, your own environments, your own conditions.\"",

    "description": "Business Insider is tracking what the fight over the future of capitalism means for your work, your wealth, and your world.",
    "fullText": "From Davos to Washington to America's high school classrooms, people are questioning the foundations of our economic system — and we at Business Insider are tracking what the fight over the future of capitalism means for your work, your wealth, and your world.\n\nPolls show Americans' trust in capitalism is falling fast, as daily life has grown more expensive and less secure. Our own recent survey of readers found that people are worried their wages aren't keeping up with their expenses, that housing feels out of reach, and that the whole system seems shaky. Many employers are leaning even more heavily into a capitalistic approach, deemphasizing loyalty and tenure in favor of ruthless meritocracy. Meanwhile, the US government has taken a more hands-on role in the economy, becoming a shareholder in several companies and upending its place in the capitalist system.\n\nAs questions about the state of capitalism grow, leaders are pitching competing visions of the economy's future. President Trump told a room full of CEOs, executives, and media figures at Davos this week that the US is reshaping the rules to make sure the country comes out of this period of transition \"bigger and better than before.\" Some are pushing for reform, like California governor Gavin Newsom, who called for a \"rules-based, competitive\" model at Davos. Others, like New York City's self-described socialist mayor Zohran Mamdani, want to rethink the system from the ground up — and have a lot of voters on board.\n\nWhile capitalism's future hangs in the balance, Business Insider is digging in. We're exploring how and why the system is being reshaped — by government policy, by companies, and by you.\n\nTell us what you think about the future of capitalism. Test your own understanding. And stick with us as we track how this system is evolving in real time, and what it will look like next.",

    "fullText": "For decades, McDonald's customers have complained that the fast-food giant reserves its most fun and innovative menu items for international markets, leaving its home country with the same predictable seasonal releases.\n\nAs frustrating as that may seem, there is a deliberate strategy behind this madness.\n\nMcDonald's tailors its menu in each country based on cultural preferences, ingredient availability, and what can be executed efficiently at scale. The same applies to limited-time and seasonal items.\n\nWhile menus vary around the world, a small set of core products remains consistent, including the World Famous Fries, the classic Hamburger and Cheeseburger, the Big Mac, McNuggets, and the Vanilla Cone.\n\nThis localization strategy reduces operational risk and improves return on investment, which is why each country maintains its own lineup with exclusive offerings.\n\nHistorically, McDonald's has taken a cautious approach to bringing international items to the U.S., testing them selectively and tailoring availability based on regional preferences and past performance. In most cases, localized items had stayed local.\n\nMcDonald's has revealed an entire lineup of international menu items coming to U.S. restaurants nationwide in 2026, marking one of the company's most ambitious cross-market rollouts in years.\n\nHere is the full list, with all items set to launch within the next few days.\n\nMcDonald's (MCD) first introduced its Hot Honey Sauce in Australia in March 2025, aiming to capitalize on what it described as \"the hottest trend everyone is talking about,\" according to a company press release. The sauce was later rolled out in New Zealand and Canada, each for a limited-time run.\n\nNow, less than a year later, it is headed to the U.S.\n\nThe Hot Honey Sauce blends honey with red bell peppers and cayenne peppers, finished with a hint of tangy vinegar. Alongside it, McDonald's is debuting three new menu items featuring the trendy sauce.\n\nHot Honey Bacon McCrispy: A crispy chicken filet topped with thick-cut applewood smoked bacon, crispy jalapeños, shredded lettuce, creamy mayo, and Hot Honey Sauce, served on a toasted potato roll \n\nHot Honey Snack Wrap: A McCrispy Strip topped with shredded cheese, shredded lettuce, and Hot Honey Sauce, all wrapped in a tortilla \n\nHot Honey Sausage Egg Biscuit: A pork sausage patty and a folded egg, topped with Hot Honey Sauce, on a biscuit brushed with real butter \n\nThe Hot Honey Sauce and all three new menu items will be available for a limited time beginning January 27 at participating U.S. locations and can be added to any menu item, according to the Snackolator Instagram page.\n\nAlthough the new products have not officially launched, they already appear on the McDonald's website.\n\nThe Big Arch burger debuted in Portugal in July 2024 and quickly gained traction, prompting McDonald's to expand it into Canada, Germany, Australia, the UK, Ireland, and France.\n\nDuring an earnings call in mid-2024, McDonald's acknowledged the burger's strong performance and universal appeal, which led it to accelerate its expansion.\n\n\"The pilot of our larger burger offering, Big Arch, now in three international markets, Portugal, Germany, and Canada, shows that we're listening to consumer tastes and delivering,\" said McDonald’s CEO Chris Kempczinski in the earnings call.\n\n\"We'll work with franchisees and partners to deploy the Big Arch faster into more international markets in 2025.\"\n\nFollowing its positive reception abroad, McDonald's tested the Big Arch in the U.S. at its headquarters restaurant in Chicago for a limited time.\n\nThis massive burger features two quarter-pounder patties, three slices of white cheese, crispy onions, slivered onions, pickles, lettuce, and Big Arch Sauce, all sandwiched between a sliced sesame and poppy seed bun.\n\nWhile the Double Quarter Pounder comes close, it's not the same. McDonald's is positioning the Big Arch as a more premium, value-driven option.\n\nIn Canada, a Big Arch meal costs about $12.59, or roughly $9 in the U.S. Despite the higher price, the company says the burger delivers greater value, an increasingly important selling point as consumers grow more cautious of their spending.\n\nMcDonald's credits the Big Arch as a key traffic driver in several markets, helping boost global comparable sales by nearly 4% year over year in the second quarter of fiscal 2025.\n\nAfter extensive testing, the Big Arch will make its nationwide U.S. debut in early March 2026, according to The Street.\n\nLike much of the fast-food industry, McDonald's has faced mounting pressure in recent years, particularly in the U.S. Slower foot traffic, rising food costs, and weaker spending have weighed on results.\n\nPrices for food at home increased 2.6%, while prices for food away from home rose 3.7% in the 12 months ended September 2025, according to recent U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data.\n\nMcDonald's making major drive-thru change\n\nMcDonald’s expected to bring back beloved childhood favorite in 2026\n\nFive Guys debuts alcohol and all-day breakfast\n\nDuring the quarter ending June 2025, foodservice traffic declined 1%, as consumers dined out less frequently, according to Circana. However, value menu traffic rose 1%, marking the first positive growth in three years.\n\nCircana also found that value-focused diners are 33% more likely than non-value buyers to purchase value menu items when visiting other restaurant chains, underscoring how aggressively consumers are hunting for savings and deals.\n\nIn response to consumers' cautious spending, McDonald's has rolled out several value-focused initiatives, including the Extra Value Meals, McValue menu, and $5 Meal Deals.\n\nIn March 2025, the company launched the Restaurant Experience Team, combining operations, supply chain, franchising, development, restaurant design, delivery, and Speedee Labs to drive innovation and efficiency. It also created three new global Category Management teams focused on beef, chicken, and beverages/desserts to further specialize innovation within its food products.\n\n“Value is rarely defined only by price,” said Circana Senior VP and Industry Advisor for Food and Foodservice David Portalatin in a statement. “Operational excellence in providing quality, affordability, great experiences, and convenience is what leads winning restaurants and their supply chain partners to greater success.”\n\nThose efforts are beginning to pay off. In the third quarter of fiscal 2025, U.S. comparable sales increased 2.4%.\n\nDespite improvement, McDonald's remains cautious.\n\n\"We continue to remain cautious about the health of the consumer in the U.S. and our top international markets and believe the pressures will continue well into 2026,\" said McDonald's CEO Christopher J. Kempczinski in an earnings call.\n\n\"It’s a foundational expectation of our brand to bring consumers through our doors and keep them coming back.\"",

    "fullText": "NEW DELHI/MOSCOW, Jan 21 (Reuters) - India's Reliance Industries Ltd, operator of the world's largest refining complex, is set to receive sanctions-compliant Russian ​oil in February and March after a one-month pause, four sources familiar ‌with the matter said.\n\nReliance last received Russian crude in December after securing a one-month U.S. concession that ‌allowed it to wind down dealings with the sanctioned Russian oil producer Rosneft beyond a November 21 deadline.\n\nLike other Indian refiners, Reliance will buy Russian oil from non-sanctioned sellers, the sources said, without elaborating on the number of February and March cargoes that the ⁠refiner has booked.\n\nIt is not ‌clear if the private refinery will continue to buy Russian oil beyond March.\n\nReliance did not respond to a Reuters email seeking comment.\n\nREFINERS ‍BOOST MIDDLE EAST CRUDE IMPORTS\n\nDespite Reliance's return, India's overall Russian oil imports are expected to stay subdued through February and March, the sources added.\n\nReliance had been importing Russian crude under a ​long‑term agreement with Rosneft for 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) for its 1.4 million ‌bpd Jamnagar refinery complex in Gujarat.\n\nThe European Union has said from January 21 it will not take fuel produced at refineries that received or processed Russian oil 60 days prior to the bill-of-lading date.\n\nReliance has said it will process the cargoes that arrived after November 20 at its India-focused 660,000 barrels per day plant, allowing it to ⁠continue selling fuels to the EU from its ​704,000 bpd export-oriented refinery.\n\nRefiners in India, which became ​the top buyer of discounted Russian seaborne crude following the 2022 outbreak of war in Ukraine, are recalibrating their crude import strategies, raising ‍Middle Eastern purchases as ⁠they shift away from Russia.\n\n\"We have faced instances where sanctions were imposed suddenly and we had to cut back,\" Srinivas T, chief operating officer, refinery ⁠and marketing, at Reliance, said last week.\n\nReliance had ramped up purchases from national oil companies elsewhere ahead ‌of time to avoid spot market disruptions, he said.",

    "fullText": "The Supreme Court heard arguments on Wednesday regarding President Donald Trump’s move to fire Federal Reserve Board Governor Lisa D. Cook, with whom the court appeared likely to side.\n\nThe New York Times’s Ann E. Marimow summed up the arguments before the court and reported that “justices from across the ideological spectrum questioned whether the allegations President Trump lodged against Ms. Cook — an unproven assertion that she engaged in mortgage fraud before taking office — were serious enough to allow the president to fire her.”\n\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh, a Trump appointee, offered some of the most skeptical questions to Trump Solicitor General D. John Sauer.\n\nKavanaugh went so far during his questioning to suggest that if the court found in Trump’s favor, it would mean the president could fire all independent agency officials “at-will” – ending the “for cause” legal requirement.\n\nKavanaugh argued “the current president’s appointees would likely be removed for cause on January 20, 2029 if there’s a Democrat president…then we’re really at-will removal.”\n\nBelow is a transcript of that exchange:\n\nKavanaugh: For present purposes, you accept the constitutionality of the for-cause removal provision for the Federal Reserve, and that is what protects the independence of the Federal Reserve. What, in your view, is the purpose of that independence?\n\nSauer: It protects the governors. Exactly reflecting the plain text of the statute, it protects the governors from removal for policy disagreement or for no reason at all.\n\nKavanaugh: What is the broader purpose of that?\n\nSauer: To preserve the independence of the Federal Reserve.\n\nKavanaugh: And what is the broader purpose of that?\n\nSauer: Well, there are a number of reasons that are discussed by the amici, and I think not disputed by us, which is that there is, you know, a long tradition of having this exercise of monetary policy be exercised independent of, you know, executive influence, and we don’t dispute that that’s what Congress was doing in that statute. And again, we are not disputing the validity of the for-cause removal restriction here.\n\nKavanaugh: And why is that independence important in your view?\n\nSauer: We don’t dispute the importance of that for many of the reasons that the amici say, but we emphasize that there’s a balance struck here. This is not an ironclad “you can never be removed.” There is a cause removal authorization.\n\nKavanaugh: But on that, in your position that there’s no judicial review, no process required, no remedy available, very low bar for cause that the president alone determines—that would weaken, if not shatter, the independence of the Federal Reserve that we just discussed.\n Sauer: We disagree with that, and I would point to the point you made that this is a low bar for cause. In a sense, it’s a very high bar.\n\nIt is a very strong protection, because it does protect them from the one thing that Congress was apparently most worried about, which is—\n Kavanaugh: But it would be in the view of the president—the president who might have a policy disagreement—and there’s no judicial review, and the president can just define it on his or her own.\n\nSauer: One of the strongest traditions in this court’s jurisprudence is the sort of presumption of regularity to the president’s actions that has applied to this provision, I think, effectively for 112 years, and it continues to do so.\n\nKavanaugh: Let’s talk about the real-world downstream effects of this. Because if this were set as a precedent, it seems to me, just thinking big picture, what goes around comes around. All of the current president’s appointees would likely be removed for cause on January 20, 2029, if there’s a Democratic president, or January 20, 2033. And then we’re really at at-will removal. So what are we doing here? What is—you know, we started—that’s why I started with what’s the purpose of the independence and the for-cause removal. If we accept all these—no procedure, no judicial review, no remedy—you know, that’s what’s going to happen, I think. And then where are we? So do you dispute that that is, you know, the real-world effect?\n\nSauer: I can’t predict what future presidents may or may not do, but the argument strikes me as a policy argument.\n\nKavanaugh: Well, history is a pretty good guide. Once these tools are unleashed, they are used by both sides, and usually more the second time around. And I think that’s what we have to make sure we’re—again, that can’t drive the decision necessarily. We have to be aware of what we’re doing and the consequences of your position for the structure of the government.\n\nWatch the clip above via C-SPAN.\n\nThe post Kavanaugh Warns ‘What Goes Around Comes Around’ If Court Lets Trump Have ‘At-Will Removal’ Power first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "As the Ukraine-Russia drone arms race rages, hobbyists far from the war are pushing the limit for how quickly these small quadcopters can fly.\n\nA father-son duo in South Africa set a new Guinness World Record by reaching a ground speed of 408 mph with their custom, battery-powered remote-controlled quadcopter, the Peregreen V4.\n\nLuke and Mike Bell performed the record-breaking flight on December 11, 2025, the Guinness World Records organization said in a statement in January.\n\nWhile drones built for war are constrained by additional factors, the Bells' achievement expands the possibilities of how these devices might one day perform on the battlefield.\n\nIt also lays bare how accessible new war-relevant technology is becoming for civilians. The Bells documented their design and build process on YouTube, filming themselves using a 3D printer and off-the-shelf parts to create the Peregreen V4.\n\nTheir drone's design features a dome-shaped head and four propellers extending from the lower body — much like many of the interceptor drones available on the Ukrainian market today.\n\nThese drones, developed primarily as a low-cost way of countering Russian Shahed-type loitering munitions, have become a pillar of Ukrainian air defense.\n\nSome of the fastest interceptors available to Ukrainian forces can reach 200 mph, which is also the typical velocity of a bullet train.\n\nUkrainians are trying to push their quadcopters to fly even faster. Flight speed is key for these interceptors because they're designed to chase and crash into Shaheds, and Russia has been continually ramping up the speeds of its attack drones.\n\nThe Geran-2, a Shahed-type drone that Russia launches more commonly, can carry an explosive warhead for hundreds of miles at top speeds of 115 mph. Newer, jet-powered versions of Shaheds are estimated to fly up to 230 mph in some conditions.\n\nA major issue with faster drones is that their components tend to overheat when pushed to the limit — whether it's the propeller motors, wiring, or batteries.\n\nIn their YouTube videos, the Bells repeatedly recorded their drone or its individual parts catching fire during tests.\n\nDrone makers also have to juggle other design factors, such as the drone's aerodynamics and propeller efficiency.\n\nUkrainian war manufacturers face additional constraints: Their drones need to carry an additional payload — often 200 grams to 1 kg of explosives. They must also be maneuverable enough to pivot and catch a flying enemy target, and be mass-produced.\n\nEarlier this month, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said his country was already producing 1,000 interceptor drones a day.\n\nMeanwhile, the Bells' flight record involved a single drone that flew largely in a straight line.\n\nThe duo's latest certification is the third time they've attained the fastest-drone record. The previous holder of the achievement was Australian drone maker Ben Biggs, who built a drone that reached 389 mph late last year.\n\nBefore Biggs' record, the Bells' earlier quadcopter, the Peregreen V3, had flown at up to roughly 363 mph in the summer of 2025.\n\nIn 2024, the pair set a record of 298 mph with a similar drone design.\n\nGuinness World Records requires aspiring drone record-breakers to fly their device in two opposing directions and then calculate the average speed to account for wind.",

This ate into the president’s schedule and whittled away the notoriously light sleeper’s opportunity for some shut-eye.\n\nThe president swapped planes back in the capital and continued his journey, heavily delayed, to Switzerland. His second departure, just after midnight, is thought to have added a further three hours to his journey.\n\nTrump, 79, emerged from the second plane in Zurich on Wednesday morning looking frazzled, before slowly descending the stairs. Despite the setback, the president still made it in time to address world leaders in Davos, though his voice sounded hoarse and he appeared to have bags under his eyes.\n\nCNN White House Correspondent Alayna Treene reported that her colleague, frequent Trump target Kaitlan Collins, said his Chief of Staff Susie Wiles relayed the message that the president would be moving away from international travel to tour U.S. cities ahead of November midterms.\n\nWiles told the press pool that Trump’s new intinerary will begin in Iowa on Tuesday, where the president will give a speech on the economy. He will then visit a new destination “every week,” Bloomberg reported, citing Wiles.\n\nIt’s part of an attempt to reverse poor marks on affordability, a main concern of voters that Trump has sought to dismiss as a “hoax” cooked up by Democrats.\n\nTrump’s domestic charm offensive kicked off in Michigan last week. He toured Ford’s River Rouge complex in Dearborn on Tuesday afternoon before delivering a speech at the Detroit Economic Club.\n\nHowever, it got off to a contentious start as Trump appeared to flip off a person heard calling him a “pedophile protector” during his visit to the vehicle plant. According to footage of the confrontation, Trump appeared to point at the accuser as he said, “f*** you,” and then gave the person the middle finger as he walked away.\n\nThat followed another speech in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania, last month, where Trump rambled about the brazen U.S. capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro and called the affordability issue a “hoax” twice.\n\nHis focus frustrated senior White House officials and Republican lawmakers who want the administration to emphasize economic and healthcare concerns, three people familiar with internal discussions told Reuters.\n\nThe White House has been asked to comment on Trump’s revamped travel schedule.",

    "fullText": "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — The astronauts evacuated last week from the International Space Station say a portable ultrasound machine came in “super handy” during the medical crisis.\n\nDuring their first public appearance since returning to Earth, the four astronauts refused Wednesday to say which one of them needed medical attention and for what reason. It was NASA's first medical evacuation in 65 years of human spaceflight.\n\nNASA’s Mike Fincke said the crew used the onboard ultrasound machine once the medical problem arose Jan. 7, the day before a planned spacewalk that was abruptly canceled. The astronauts had already used the device a lot for routine checks of their body changes while living in weightlessness, “so when we had this emergency, the ultrasound machine came in super handy.”\n\nIt was so useful that Fincke said there should be one on all future spaceflights. “It really helped,” he said.\n\n“Of course, we didn't have other big machines that we have here on planet Earth,” he added. “We do try to make sure that everybody before we fly are really, really not prone to surprises. But sometimes things happen and surprises happen, and the team was ready ... preparation was super important.\"\n\nThe space station is set up as well as it can be for medical emergencies, said NASA's Zena Cardman, who commanded the crew's early return flight with SpaceX. She said NASA “made all the right decisions” in canceling the spacewalk, which would have been her first, and prioritizing the crew's well-being.\n\nJapanese astronaut Kimiya Yui said he was surprised how well all the preflight training paid off in dealing with the health concerns.\n\n“We can handle any kind of difficult situation,” Yui said. “This is actually very, very good experience for the future of human spaceflight.”\n\nJoining them on what turned out to be a 5 1/2-month mission — more than a month shorter than planned — was Russia's Oleg Platonov. They launched last August from Florida and splashed down in the Pacific off the San Diego coast last week.\n\nWelcoming them back to Houston were their replacements, who aren't due to launch until mid-February. NASA and SpaceX are working to move up the flight.\n\n“We were hoping to give them hugs in space, but we gave them hugs on Earth,” Fincke said.\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

    "fullText": "Las Vegas Darts Open: Brandon Claims Open as Hedman defends women's title originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nLas Vegas has a habit of exaggerating things. Lights brighter. Nights longer. Legends larger. And on the oche, beneath the neon glare of The Strip, Deta Hedman once again reminded the darts world that class doesn’t age – it sharpens.\n\nNorth America is becoming more a centre of focus for the World Darts Federation with every passing year. A glance at the rankings will confirm the growing influence of USA events and, in turn, dominance of their players. But they would not get it all their own way as the season started again after a festive breather.\n\nThe Open event brought a distinctly American flavour, and the final proved brutally one-sided. Tennessee thrower Jason Brandon turned the dial to demolition mode, whitewashing compatriot Alex Spellman 6-0 with an average nudging just past the 90 mark. Spellman never found his footing. Brandon never loosened his grip. Sometimes, finals end before they begin.\n\nFresh into 2026 and the reigning WDF Women’s World Championship holder picked up exactly where she left off, rolling into Nevada and rolling straight back into the winner’s circle by lifting the Winmau Las Vegas Open crown. At 66 years young, the Queen of Darts remains ruthlessly efficient, brushing aside America’s Cali West 5-2 in the final to add yet another major WDF trophy to an already overflowing cabinet.\n\nDETA STRIKES 10 DART LEG: Watch Vegas highlight from the World Champion\n\nThis wasn’t nostalgia. This wasn’t sentiment. This was elite darts, delivered with the calm authority of someone who has seen every trend come and go – and outlasted them all. In a city built on excess, Hedman’s dominance felt beautifully understated. Just sharp scoring, clinical doubles, and the unmistakable presence of a champion who still belongs at the very top of the World Darts Federation pyramid.\n\nBut Las Vegas is never about just one event. The weekend unfolded like a darts buffet – singles, doubles, cricket, youth tournaments – boards buzzing from morning through to whatever hour Vegas pretends is night. And naturally, Hedman wasn’t done.\n\nMore silverware followed in the doubles, where she paired with Anca Zijlstra to overcome Japan’s Kosuzu Iwao and Shiori Sato. Another medal. Another reminder that Hedman’s influence stretches across formats, continents and generations.\n\nThe Stars and Stripes flew again in the Open Doubles as Brandon Perez and Marko Silva edged out Canada’s Jayson Barlow and David Cameron in a tight North American showdown.\n\nThere are far worse places to spend a weekend throwing darts than Las Vegas. Fewer still where the trophies pile up, the WDF banner flies proudly, and legends like Deta Hedman continue to turn neon-lit stages into personal property.\n\nFor the full stories and \n\nDarts World subscriptions options include Print, Digital and All Access packages, as well as exclusive products and competitions",

    "description": "Business leaders and CEOs weighed in on President Donald Trump's highly anticipated speech at the World Economic Forum on Wednesday.",
    "fullText": "Business leaders such as Ken Griffin and Matthew Prince have already weighed in on President Donald Trump's highly anticipated speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.\n\nTrump said on Wednesday that he will not use force to get Greenland, but is \"seeking immediate negotiations to once again discuss the acquisition\" by the US.\n\nTrump's ongoing threats against Europe over his desire to take over Greenland have been dominating this year's Davos agenda.\n\nAll eyes were on Trump during his 70-minute-long speech, with billionaire CEOs — including Apple's Tim Cook and Salesforce's Marc Benioff — alongside heads of state filling up Congress Hall to hear what he had to say.\n\nHere is how some of the world's biggest business leaders have reacted:\n\nSpeaking on CNBC's Squawk Box on Wednesday, Citadel's CEO and founder Ken Griffin said Trump had an \"important message to deliver to a European audience that, bluntly, needs to do better. Europe's economic growth lags far behind America.\"\n\n\"The commitment of the American people to defend our country runs deep. The commitment of the Europeans to defend their countries — if you look at surveys of the population — is not nearly as strong,\" he added.\n\nGriffin said he thought one of Trump's \"important foundational statements he made with respect to the justification why the US needs unfettered access to Greenland\" was whether Europe would be there for the US if there was another war.\n\nHowever, Griffin said that if the US does decide to \"pursue this path\", discussions \"should take time and be thoughtfully laid out.\"\n\n\"Investors around the world do not want to see an escalation of the stress in global trade that has played out over the last 12 months,\" the Citadel CEO added.\n\nPeter Schiff, the chief economist at Euro Pacific Asset Management, said it looked like \"cooler heads prevailed at the White House.\"\n\n\"So if the US can't buy Greenland instead of taking it by military force, Trump will just hold a grudge,\" Schiff, whose firm managed $1.4 billion last year, wrote on X.\n\n\"While that is a major improvement, it also means that if we do succeed in buying Greenland, we'll massively overpay.\"\n\nSchiff also warned on X that a housing \"crash is coming.\"\n\n\"Trump basically admitted there is a housing bubble in the US. He also admitted his main policy goal is to prevent it from popping,\" Schiff wrote.\n\n\"But once you recognize a bubble, the worst thing you can do is try to sustain it. The sooner it bursts, the less damage it will ultimately cause.\"\n\nCloudflare's CEO appears to have commented on Trump's speech style.\n\n\"Last two times Trump spoke at Davos he stuck extremely close to the teleprompter. Not this time,\" Prince wrote on X.\n\nSpeaking on CNBC's Money Movers on Wednesday, the founder and executive chair of investment bank Moelis & Company, Ken Moelis, said he thought Trump \"made a very good case\" for a deal over Greenland.\n\n\"There was a real sigh of relief that he took military action off the table with Greenland. With President Trump, it's unusual for him to ever take an option off the table, so that was a big sigh of relief,\" he said.\n\nMoelis described Greenland as \"probably the biggest M&A deal in the history of the world\" and criticized Europe's approach to energy policy.\n\n\"You have to look at Europe and say their choices on energy policy have put them in the position they're in right now which is fairly weak economically and in a global position. And I thought he made a very good case for that,\" he said.",

    "description": "President Donald Trump used his Davos address to press for US control of Greenland, defend tariffs, and frame global politics as a contest of power.",
    "fullText": "It was a speech that was never going to fly under the radar.\n\nPresident Donald Trump used his Davos address on Wednesday to press his case for US control of Greenland, criticize what he described as Europe's economic decline, and outline a series of domestic and global policy priorities — from tariffs and credit card rates to the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe speech came after Trump's flight to Davos was delayed following a midair turnaround of Air Force One due to a \"minor electrical issue\" and a transatlantic flight on a backup jet.\n\nIt also came amid mounting backlash from European leaders, rattled markets, and warnings of retaliation that could hit America's biggest economic advantages.\n\nHere are the four biggest takeaways from Trump's remarks:\n\nTrump devoted a significant portion of his speech to Greenland, saying that the US does not plan to use military force and adding that no other country can secure the territory.\n\n\"I don't have to use force. I don't want to use force. I won't use force, Trump said.\"\n\nAt the same time, he framed US control of Greenland as essential to global security and openly criticized America's allies.\n\n\"All the United States is asking for is a place called Greenland,\" Trump said.\n\n\"No nation or a group of nations is in any position to be able to secure Greenland other than the United States.\"\n\nTrump said US ownership would benefit NATO, even as he questioned the alliance's reliability.\n\n\"This would greatly enhance the security of the entire NATO alliance,\" he said, adding: \"We want strong allies, not seriously weakened ones.\"\n\nTrump repeatedly returned to tariffs as a central tool of leverage, describing them as a way to get other countries to change behavior.\n\n\"Instead of raising taxes on domestic producers, we're lowering them and raising tariffs on foreign nations,\" Trump said.\n\nHe added that tariffs have enabled him to secure concessions that would not have been possible otherwise.\n\n\"Without tariffs, I wouldn't have been able to get it done,\" he said.\n\nAt one point, he described his negotiating style in blunt terms, telling the audience that when tariffs are on the table, the message to other countries is simple: \"You're going to do it fast.\"\n\nTrump used some of his most emotive language when discussing energy policy, particularly renewable power.\n\nHe dismissed green policies as \"the Green New Scam\" in reference to the EU's Green New Deal and called it \"perhaps the greatest hoax in history,\" adding that wind turbines ruin landscapes while losing money.\n\n\"Windmills all over the place destroy your land,\" Trump said.\"Stupid people buy them.\"\n\nHe also accused China of profiting from renewable energy by manufacturing windmills for export while relying on other energy sources at home, suggesting Beijing sells green technology it does not fully embrace itself.\n\nTrump said that parts of Europe have declined economically and politically — without naming specific cities or countries.\n\n\"Certain places in Europe are not even recognizable anymore,\" he said, adding that the changes were \"not in a positive way.\"\n\nHe blamed European governments for weakening themselves through energy and economic policy.\n\n\"They're destroying themselves,\" Trump said of European countries.\n\nAt the same time, he positioned the US as the central force in the global economy and security.\n\n\"The USA is the economic engine on the planet,\" he said. \"When America booms, the entire world booms.\"\n\n\"I'm working every day to ensure our military is very powerful. Our borders are very strong. And above all, our economy is strong because national security requires economic security and economic prosperity,\" he added.",

    "fullText": "Hours before President Donald Trump's highly anticipated speech at the World Economic Forum, Ken Griffin, the outspoken billionaire CEO of Citadel, gave his rundown of the US leader's key economic policies.\n\nTrump's tariffs have been \"a negative\" and have left the US economy in a \"pretty unfortunate position,\" said Griffin at the World Economic Forum on Wednesday.\n\nThe president's policy to raise tariffs on imports to the US has \"disrupted long-standing trading relationships\" and led to \"higher inflation,\" said Griffin.\n\n\"We've obviously increased the amount of cronyism in America as corporate CEOs have lined up in Washington trying to argue why their business should be exempted from tariffs, and many have prevailed,\" he added.\n\nCentral to Trump's tariff agenda is the promise that manufacturing will return to America, reducing US dependency on foreign nations for critical items.\n\n\"We have yet to bring manufacturing jobs back to the United States,\" said Griffin.\n\nThe Citadel CEO highlighted that Trump is clearly following through on the platform he was elected on and said that tariffs have had some of their intended effects, though he did not specify what these were.\n\nBut one of the main problems with US tariffs is that business leaders are uncertain about how long the policy will stay in place.\n\n\"I think people have a very hard time believing that the current tariff regime's going to persist,\" said Griffin. \"Before you spend hundreds of millions of dollars or billions of dollars to build a manufacturing plan, you really want to believe that the policy that is the anchor of that decision will be permanent in nature.\"\n\nGriffin also gave his two cents on Trump's immigration and geopolitical policies.\n\nNo country's borders should be open to mass immigration, but closing down the Southern border has meant losing a large supply of labor, said Griffin.\n\n\"These are people who did a lot of very, very difficult work, very modest wages, which helped to reduce the level of inflation in the United States,\" he said, adding that he expected housing and food prices to rise in the coming years as a result.\n\nThe bigger problem that Trump's immigration policy has caused for the US is that \"we're potentially losing access to the best and brightest minds from around the world,\" said Griffin.\n\n\"The majority of Silicon Valley is either run by immigrants or children of immigrants,\" he said, and their companies have created \"a tremendous number of jobs in the United States.\"\n\nSpeaking ahead of Trump's speech at Davos on Wednesday, Griffin said he was uncertain about what the US president was hoping to achieve by clashing with Europe over ownership of Greenland: \"What I can't understand is why are we fighting over a piece of rock covered by ice?\"\n\n\"We have frayed our relationship with our European allies in ways that I don't understand or appreciate, but there is a push here to get Europe to step up,\" said Griffin.\n\nDuring his speech, Trump ruled out using force to acquire Greenland, but said that he wants \"right, title, and ownership\" of the nation.",

There are two guys that can prove it.\"\n\nAmerican players each received $500,000 (£373,000) from organisers the PGA of America to compete in last year's defeat at Bethpage, making it the first time in the Ryder Cup's 98-year history that players on either side had been paid to play.\n\nHowever, some of the players said during the event in New York that they would donate their earnings to charity.\n\nWhile several of the world's top golfers were lured to LIV, Northern Ireland's McIlroy remained loyal to the DP World Tour and US-based PGA Tour.\n\n\"I think any organisation or any members' organisation like this has a right to uphold its rules and regulations,\" added the reigning Masters champion.\n\n\"What the DP World Tour is doing is upholding its rules and regulations. We, as members, sign a document at the start of every year, which has you agree to these rules and regulations.\n\n\"The people that made the option to go to LIV knew what they were.

    "description": "John Abernathy was tackled by federal agents in Minneapolis and threw his Leica to safety.",
    "fullText": "John Abernathy, a photographer from Minneapolis, was flat on the ground. He had the knees of at least one federal officer on his back. He heard someone shouting to put his hands behind his back, but his arms were half pinned beneath him. He was surrounded by dozens of officers deploying something ― tear gas, he thinks ― that made it hard to see or breathe. He felt like he could puke or pass out.\n\nHe feared what might happen if federal agents got hold of his equipment. So when he locked eyes with another photographer, he took his camera ― a Leica M10-R with a 28-millimeter lens ― and threw it, pitching his cellphone away from him shortly after.\n\nPierre Lavie, a fellow photojournalist, snatched the Leica by the strap and brought it close to his body. As he reached for Abernathy’s phone, which had only traveled a couple of feet, a federal officer repeatedly tried to stomp on it.\n\n“I had to Hungry Hippo my hand in and out to avoid my hand getting stepped on, and I managed to finally grab it and get it away,” Lavie told HuffPost.\n\nNews: Ex-Flight Attendant Accused Of Yearslong ‘Catch Me If You Can’-Style Scam\n\nIt’s a familiar scene to both. Abernathy, who previously did photography work for advertisements and magazines, said he set out to document the protests over Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s crackdown in Minneapolis and the killing of Renee Good “just to show what’s happening to whoever might see it.” Lavie, a member of the National Press Photographers Association from Dallas, had come from New Orleans, where he was also capturing ICE activity, to cover the unrest.\n\nOn Thursday, Jan. 15, both were outside the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building in Minneapolis, which has recently been used to hold people detained by ICE officers.When Abernathy saw what he called “agitators” ― pro-ICE demonstrators ― carrying bear spray, he grabbed a can from someone and tossed it aside so it couldn’t go off near him.\n\nHe speculates that’s why he was targeted by federal agents, who yelled that they saw him spraying the crowd, though he said they didn’t provide evidence to back that up after they handcuffed him and took him inside the Whipple Building. (He received a citation, but has yet to receive a court date.)\n\nAs he struggled underneath the agents, he fought to keep breathing.\n\n“I couldn’t breathe.

HuffPost Refuses To Back Down.\n\nLavie, who has traveled around the United States in recent months documenting ICE activity, said officers working in Minneapolis are harsher than those he’s seen elsewhere, doing things like shooting pepper spray into the air intake of vehicles to force people out.\n\n“They’re very threatening right away, instead of de-escalating a situation,” he said.\n\n“Their unprofessionalism worries me as an observer because I just see it as a short distance to travel to having somebody really hurt,” he added. “It’s reckless and dangerous.”\n\nDespite suffering a chemical burn in his eye, wounds from pepper bullets and abrasions from hitting the ground, Abernathy didn’t rush to the hospital after he was released from custody.\n\nInstead, he set out to find his phone and camera, though because of the chemical agent he was doused with, he didn’t have a clear idea of who had scooped them up.\n\n“I found some guy with a bullhorn, and I asked him to walk up and down and ask if anybody has my camera, and nobody had it,” he said.\n\nNews: Trump-Appointed Prosecutor Who Pursued Indictments Against The President's Foes Is Leaving Post\n\nHe enlisted his wife’s help, having her use the Find My iPhone feature.

    "fullText": "After years away​ revisiting my abandoned island uncovers new features, old memories and the quiet reassurance that ​you can go home again\n\nDon’t get Pushing Buttons delivered to your inbox? \nNintendo’s pandemic-era hit Animal Crossing: New Horizons got another major update last week, along with a £5 Switch 2 upgrade that makes it look and run better on the new console. Last year, I threw a new year’s party for my children in the game, but apart from that I have barely touched my island since the depths of lockdown, when sunny Alba was my preferred escape from the monotonous misery of the real world. Back then, I spent more than 200 hours on this island. Stepping out of her (now massive) house, my avatar’s hair is all ruffled and her eyes sleepy after a long, long time aslumber.\n\nI half-expected Alba to be practically in ruins, but it’s not that bad. Aside from a few cockroaches in the basement and a bunch of weeds poking up from the snow, everything is as it was. The paths that I had laid out around the island still lead me to the shop, the tailors, the museum; I stop by to visit Blathers the curatorial owl, and he gives me a new mission to find a pigeon called Brewster so that we can open a museum cafe. “It’s been four years and eight months!” exclaims one of my longtime residents, a penguin called Aurora. That can’t be right, can it? Have I really been ignoring her since summer 2021? Thankfully, Animal Crossing characters are very forgiving. I get the impression they’ve been getting along perfectly fine without me.\n\nI take myself on a little tour of Alba, investigating all the things I’d forgotten I made. Atop the highest cliffs on the island I find a half-finished bamboo zen garden. Down by the beach there is a playground; I had a baby and a toddler back in 2020 and I was spending a lot of time in playgrounds. The whole place is testament to the extent of my homesickness during the pandemic, during which I was stuck in a suboptimal basement flat in Brighton: the island flag is a saltire, the island tune is the first couple of bars of Scotland the Brave.\n\nI check my bank account and find over 2 million bells in there. How the hell did I accumulate 2 million bells from selling fish and fossils? With the help of a further 99,000 bells of interest, I pay off the final instalment of my home loan, forgetting that there’s no real point in doing this except personal satisfaction. I am now penniless, but at least I am out from under the thumb of the Tom Nook financial empire. That loan-shark raccoon has got nothing on me now.\n\nThere’s a new building: a hotel perched on the end of the pier, run by a family of pirate kappa. Home decoration was never my favourite part of Animal Crossing so I am not exactly thrilled to be asked to put together new rooms for the guests, but there have been a lot of improvements to this activity since I last played – placing cute little furniture items and paintings on the floor and walls is much easier than it was, especially using the Switch 2 controller as a mouse. I throw together a nautical theme for the first room and discover that the rewards for this work are tiny versions of old Nintendo toys and consoles. I start mentally planning out a games room back at my house.\n\nRather than face all the tidying up, some of my friends have ditched their pandemic-era islands and started again, which involves a level of dedication to the game that I can only respect. There’s a new service – run by Mr Resetti, the angry mole who used to yell at you for turning off the game without saving in the early-00s era of Animal Crossing – that lets you wipe everything off the ground of your island, leaving it clear for terraforming and redecorating. It’s also now easier to make those outdoor transformations, as you can hold L to stick your character to the island’s invisible grid, making it much easier to place things like walls and roads. And crops, I discover. Did you know Animal Crossing has farming now? And food recipes? This was news to me. Now I make my mini-me a smoothie before my morning rounds of Alba.\n\nI am surprised at how quickly I fall back into the rhythm of Animal Crossing. It’s such a soothing game, with so many outlets for creativity. Much of this update’s new stuff is for people with more time than me – for instance, you can decorate entire new Slumber Islands with friends while your avatar sleeps, but what was always great about this game is that it doesn’t require much from you. You can spend a peaceful half hour every day checking in on your small world, or you can spend many hours creating custom fashions for your residents and tourists, and designing every square metre of the island to your specifications.\n\nBack in the 90s, Animal Crossing was a game born from loneliness: Nintendo’s Katsuya Eguchi came up with the original idea for the game because moving to Kyoto had separated him from his friends and family in Chiba, near Tokyo. He envisioned a game that fostered a sense of community, that families could play together. (You can read a lot more about this series’ origins in my book about Nintendo, by the way – it’s out in a couple of weeks.) So it feels very poetic that Animal Crossing ended up saving the whole world from loneliness in 2020. It’s taken me a long while to feel good about returning to Alba, and it’s been a surprise to discover that this game is now better than it’s ever been.\n\nMan was I sleeping on Dispatch. I played all of its eight episodes over the course of a week and I have never laughed aloud so often at a video game. A narrative game in the vein of the old Telltale adventures The Walking Dead and The Wolf Among Us, and made by many of the same people, it tells the story of washed-up superhero, Robert Robertson III, who is sent to work at a call centre and put in charge of a team of mardy former supervillains on a rehabilitation programme. The animation is superb, the characters and acting memorable, and the dialogue quick-witted. It would have made a great animated series, but it makes an even better choice-centric video game. Anything with superheroes is usually an instant “no” from me, but this is clever and funny without the boringly self-referential humour that usually infests the genre.\n\nAvailable on: PS5, PC; Nintendo Switch/2 versions coming 28 January\n\n Estimated playtime: 8-9 hours\n\nAmazon MGM Studios released a first image of Game of Thrones actor Sophie Turner as Lara Croft in the forthcoming Tomb Raider TV series. Angelina Jolie and Alicia Vikander were the previous two on-screen Crofts; Turner says she has been training eight hours a day, five days a week for the past year for the role.\n\nNewish independent site Design Room has gone deep on the groundbreaking 2008 parkour game Mirror’s Edge, in an in-depth history written by frequent Guardian Games contributor Lewis Gordon.\n\nAnother online multiplayer game was put to bed last week: 2019’s sci-fi mech shooter Anthem, one of the first live-service flops of the current era. It was made by BioWare – a studio better known for its RPGs. Its producer Mark Darrah released a four hour (!) postmortem video on YouTube, summarised here by VGC.\n\nA beginner’s guide to Arc Raiders: what it is and how you start playing\n\n‘It’s a loving mockery, because it’s also who I am’: the making of gaming’s most pathetic character\n\nCommodore 64 Ultimate – it’s like 1982 all over again! | ★★★★★\n\nA few weeks ago I asked for your most-anticipated games of 2026 (mine are here). Reader Ee simply responded with the words Fatal Frame – there’s a remake of the second instalment in this iconic Japanese ghost photography series coming in March. Nora picked out The Mermaid Mask – a “funny and creepy point-and-click mystery” – and TOEM 2, the sequel to a beloved black-and-white photography game. Andrew is looking forward to the interesting mix of characters in Resident Evil 9, which stars relatively defenceless newcomer Grace and seasoned zombie-killer Leon Kennedy.\n\nBrad is hoping for a new 3D Mario on Switch 2, as am I – Nintendo usually announces games late, so I think the odds are good. And I’m sorry, Maks, but the odds aren’t so great on this finally being the year that we see Half-Life 3, so I can’t share in your optimism. I’ve lost so many bets about that game that I’ve given up for good.\n\nIf you’ve got a question for Question Block – or anything else to say about the newsletter – email us on pushingbuttons@theguardian.com.",

    "description": "Billionaire tech CEOs promise shorter weeks thanks to AI—but IWG’s Mark Dixon says automation won’t free time, it’ll just create more work.",
    "fullText": "Billionaire Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, Nvidia’s boss Jensen Huang and Elon Musk have all made the same prediction in recent years: The workweek is about to shrink. Automation will take over routine tasks, they argue, freeing workers’ time and pushing a four-day week toward becoming standard. Gates has even floated the idea of a two-day workweek.\n\nBut Mark Dixon, CEO and founder of International Workplace Group (IWG) CEO isn’t buying it. From his vantage point, running the world’s largest flexible office provider—with more than 8 million users across 122 countries and 85% of the Fortune 500 among its customers—the math doesn’t add up.\n\n“Everyone is focused on productivity, so no time soon,” Dixon says flatly.\n\n“It’s about the cost of labor,” Dixon explains to Fortune. The U.S. and U.K. are experiencing significant cost-of-living crises. At the same time, he says, businesses are experiencing a “cost of operating crisis.”\n\n“Everyone’s having to control their labor costs because all costs have gone up so much, and you can’t get any more money from customers, so therefore you have to get more out of people.”\n\nEssentially, companies can’t afford to pay the same wages for fewer hours, and they can’t pass the difference on to customers. So any time ‘freed’ by automation is far more likely to be filled with new tasks than handed back to workers.\n\nSilicon Valley’s loudest voices frame AI as a route to more leisure. The world’s richest person and the boss of Space X, Tesla and X, Elon Musk has gone as far as predicting work will be completely “optional” and more like a hobby, in as little as 10 years.\n\nIn reality, Dixon suggests that this scenario would only happen if there’s not enough work to go around, rather than bosses suddenly becoming benevolent. But in his eyes, AI will most likely create more—not less—work.\n\nEvery major technological shift, he argues, has followed a similar arc: fear of displacement, followed by an expansion of opportunity.\n\n“AI will speed up companies development, so there’ll be more work, it’ll just be different work,” he says.\n\nIn 19th-century Britain, Dixon recalls English textile workers protesting against new automated machinery, fearing it threatened their livelihoods, lowered wages, and de-skilled their craft during the Industrial Revolution. They were called Luddites.\n\n“They went around the country smashing up the looms to stop progress. But look, in the end, you’ve heard of the Industrial Revolution. That’s what came from those looms and factory production.” As mass production made goods more available, retail grew; More managers were needed to oversee the machines; The middle-class grew, and so on.",

His shocking admission that the move is linked to a personal gripe over being snubbed for last year’s Nobel Peace Prize has further raised alarm both at home and abroad, with some fearing that at 79 years old, he may simply no longer be up to the job.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to the White House for comment on this story. The president has previously described his cognitive and physical health as “perfect.”",

    "fullText": "Carlos Alcaraz admitted it was tougher than expected to beat world number 102 Yannick Hanfmann at the 2026 Australian Open, despite advancing in straight sets.\n\nThe world No.1 Spaniard’s third-round clash tested his rhythm early, even though he eventually sealed a 7-6(7-4), 6-3, 6-2 victory to reach the third round at Melbourne Park.\n\nAfter the match, Alcaraz spoke honestly about the challenge posed by Hanfmann’s level and pace on the big stage.\n\nCarlos Alcaraz said after his Australian Open second-round win that his opponent pushed him harder than expected.\n\n“I knew he was going to play great. I mean, I know his level, I played him a few times already. To be honest, it was tougher than I thought at the beginning.\n\n“I didn’t feel the ball that good. You know, the ball was coming as a bomb, forehand and backhand,” Alcaraz stated.\n\nAlcaraz’s second-round match saw some early resistance from the German qualifier, ranked 102 in the world, especially in a closely contested first set that went to a tie-break.\n\nBut once the top seed found his groove, he took command to close out the match in straight sets and keep his bid for a maiden Australian Open title alive.\n\nSpeaking further about his performance, Alcaraz acknowledged how he turned things around after a difficult opening frame.\n\n“Really, really happy that I got through a really difficult first set and then I started to feel a little bit better on the court,” he concluded.\n\nWith the win secured in roughly 2 hours and 44 minutes, Alcaraz moves into the third round, where he will look to build momentum and push deeper into the draw at the Australian Open, a title that has eluded him previously despite his status as one of the sport’s brightest stars.",

    "description": "The European Union could roll out a never-before-used tool known as a trade \"bazooka\" should Trump move forward with his proposed tariffs.",
    "fullText": "Europe is weighing retaliation if President Donald Trump imposes more tariffs — and it threatens the US's big global advantage.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron pushed to activate what's commonly referred to as a trade \"bazooka\" in response to Trump's recent threat to impose an additional 10% tariff on European countries unless they agree to a deal ceding control of Greenland.\n\n\"The anti-coercion mechanism is a powerful instrument, and we should not hesitate to deploy it in today's tough environment,\" Macron said at the World Economic Forum at Davos on Tuesday.\n\nMacron was referring to a tool passed by the EU in 2023 that would allow it to impose tariffs on imports and restrict services from the US.\n\nThe hit to services such as pharma, tech, and finance would be the new blow to the US economy, as tariffs tend to focus on goods. While the US has a trade deficit for goods, it has a surplus for services.\n\nThe US exported $1.1 trillion in services in 2024, according to data from the St. Louis Federal Reserve, and has exported more services than it has imported for the last five decades, making it the world's leading services exporter. The St. Louis Fed said in its report that it means \"the U.S. can specialize in services and trade with other countries, which leads to greater efficiency and more benefits for consumers.\"\n\nThe Bureau of Economic Analysis also found that the US exported $489 billion in services to Europe that same year.\n\nAlex Durante, a senior economist at the nonpartisan Tax Foundation, told Business Insider that these threats are \"uncharted territory,\" and Trump's push to acquire Greenland could put the US' international standing at risk.\n\n\"America really would lose whatever standing it still has in the world if it were to go forward and do something like that,\" Durante said.\n\nWhite House Spokesman Kush Desai told Business Insider that \"the Trump administration has kept its word\" on its trade deal with the EU earlier this year, adding, \"the EU's time would be better spent delivering on these trade commitments.\"\n\nIn his plan, Trump called out eight European countries that opposed US control of Greenland and sent troops to the country, including Denmark, Germany, France, and the United Kingdom, as potential targets for more tariffs.\n\nThose tariffs would be raised to 25% in June if those countries do not agree to the deal, Trump said.\n\n\"This tariff will be due and payable until such time a deal is reached for the complete and total purchase,\" he wrote in a Truth Social post.\n\nA Q&A from the EU Commission said that the anti-coercion tool is \"designed to be broad\" to allow for an \"efficient response to an individual case of economic coercion with minimal or no impact on the EU economy.\"\n\nIt could restrict access to European markets for US-based service exporters, such as Big Tech companies and Wall Street firms.\n\nThe trigger for this tool, per the Commission, would be a situation in which a country pressures a member of the EU into making a decision through trade threats.\n\nDurante highlighted the intellectual property issues; the EU could restrict certain IP licenses for US firms. It could similarly limit US banks' access to EU markets, increasing costs domestically.\n\n\"A lot of those sectors, in terms of the tariffs that Trump has imposed, have been insulated from that because of the exemptions,\" Durante said.\n\nIf Trump follows through on his threatened tariffs on EU countries, prices of affected goods would likely increase. The Kiel Institute for the World Economy — a German think tank — found in a recent report that examined over 25 million shipment records that 96% of US tariffs have been paid by US consumers between January 2024 and November 2025.\n\nAnd if the EU rolls out the bazooka, it would take time — the Commission said it would have four months to examine the allegations and up to six months to determine an appropriate response. At the same time, the Trump administration is awaiting the Supreme Court's ruling on the legality of many of the president's tariffs, which could limit the tools that Trump has for future trade threats.\n\nAmerican workers could also be affected, Durante said, because the anti-coercion tool would target \"natively American firms\" and reduce their market access and profitability.\n\n\"When you have this kind of tit for tat policy, the US threatens something, the EU responds, and then we threaten something else even beyond that, it could really get out of hand very fast and make citizens of both the EU and the US worse off,\" Durante said.",

Fink said that China's population size and different privacy regime could translate into a major data advantage.\n\nThat dynamic, Fink argued, makes collaboration among the US and its allies essential. \"I would much rather say that we need to spend more money to make sure that we're competing properly against China,\" he said.\n\nStill, Fink warned that the AI boom could disappoint if its benefits remain concentrated among a small group of dominant firms.\n\n\"The key to that is making sure that the demand only comes if technology is diffused for more applications, more utilizations,\" he said.\n\n\"If technology is just the domain of the six hyperscalers, we will fail,\" he added.\n\nFink's comments came amid a broader debate about whether massive investments in AI are sending the stock markets into a bubble.\n\nSome leaders, including OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, have cautioned about overexcitement in AI — even as they acknowledge the technology's game-changing potential.\n\nMeanwhile, Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates said in late October that AI was in a bubble.",

Security guards cleared Congress Hall after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink wrapped up around noon.\n\nWhile waiting to go back in to hear Trump, attendees, including financier Anthony Scaramucci and University of California chief investment officer, Jagdeep Singh Bachher, could be seen sipping coffee and eating saffron risotto Milanese.\n\nA French journalist approached me to ask whether Trump's threats were real.

He expects tensions with the US to de-escalate, \"I think at the end of the day, we'll find an off-ramp on this.\"\n\nAfter an electrical issue on Air Force One delayed the president overnight, a replacement plane, a Boeing C-32A, was scrambled into action to bring him to Europe.\n\nAs of around midday Swiss time, the jet, a modified Boeing 757 often used as Air Force Two, was still in the air, flying close to Paris and heading for Zurich airport, where it looks likely to land within the next hour.\n\nIf, like many high-profile World Economic Forum attendees, Trump travels by helicopter from Zurich airport, it would take about another 30 to 40 minutes to reach Davos.\n\nThat could put him in the Swiss Alps just before 1.30 p.m. CET, and he is scheduled to speak at 2:30 p.m. CET.\n\nHowever, there will likely be further added time due to security and other preparations.\n\nIn short, we don't exactly know.\n\nNo clear indication has been given of what the president plans to discuss in his special address to the Davos crowd.

The first: Can the West grow economies fast enough to overcome deficits?\n\n\"That can be one big issue, especially with the rising deficits of the US,\" Fink said.\n\nSecondly, another limiting factor is whether Western economies can make a J-curve of demand happen for AI and other technologies.\n\n\"The key to that is making sure that the demand only comes if technology is diffused for more applications, more utilizations,\" Fink said. \"If technology is just the domain of the six hyperscalers, we will fail.\"\n\nTax us — that's the message from nearly 400 wealthy people, who've signed an open letter addressed to the leaders gathering at Davos.\n\nThe letter's co-signees called out a \"handful of global oligarchs with extreme wealth,\" accusing them of harming society as a whole across governance, tech, innovation, and the environment.\n\nThe solution, per the letter, comes down to one thing — taxing the superrich.\n\nSignatories include the actor Mark Ruffalo, film producer and activist Abigail Disney, and musician Brian Eno.\n\n\"I believe President Trump is going to be about 3 hours late,\" US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said at a morning presser. \"I haven't seen the updated schedule.\"\n\nICYMI: Trump had to switch planes after an electrical fault was detected on board Air Force One.\n\nDavid Steinbach, Hines' global chief investment officer, didn't mince words when describing the overall real-estate environment.\n\n\"It's been a really bad few years, honestly,\" Steinbach told me. \"Really beginning in 2022.\"\n\nDavid Steinbach, Hines' global chief investment officer, didn't mince words when describing the overall real-estate environment.\n\n\"It's been a really bad few years, honestly,\" Steinbach told me. \"Really beginning in 2022.\"\n\nRising geopolitical tensions and the siloing of regions can make the environment even trickier. Especially for a company with over $90 billion of assets across 30 countries. Still, Steinbach told me that Hines raised about 50% more discretionary capital year over year in 2025.\n\n\"There's a risk and opportunity, right? The risk is it's now different. And that's probably not changing anytime soon,\" Steinbach said. \"The opportunity is a lot needs to be built now, because you've got supply chains that need to get re-looked. You got very directive investments in-country.\"\n\n\"That's creating a lot of demand as well,\" Steinbach added.\n\nOn the schedule for Wednesday: Citadel CEO Ken Griffin, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates, Nvidia chief Jensen Huang, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks, and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff.\n\nTrump ran into some travel trouble en route to Davos late Tuesday. He was forced to switch from Air Force One to a backup plane after an electrical fault was detected on board. Flight maps show Air Force One making a U-turn over the waters off Long Island, then landing back in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe president is now back on the road and on his way to Switzerland.",

    "fullText": "A PGA Tour veteran has sent a jolt through the golf world with a candid take on LIV Golf’s ripple effect. While many criticize LIV Golf and the professionals who play in it, Tom Hoge doesn’t. The reason – the Saudi-backed league has helped him financially in a unique way.\n\n“Well, I would say personally speaking, I’m probably the player that’s benefited absolutely the most from LIV coming along. I played well in 2022 right before LIV got going, which brought an offer from LIV, so I went down that road for a little bit. But, sticking with the PGA Tour and the changes they made, I’ve played in every signature event since they were established. And I would say nobody’s benefited more financially than I have cuz I’ve played well in some of those events and been in all of them,” Tom Hoge revealed in conversation with Trey Wingo.\n\n“So, it’s been fantastic for me. So, I shouldn’t be the guy here, complaining about any of that coming along. But it is tough for the game of golf that there’s a lot of great players that are on LIV that we’re not competing with against every week like we were.”\n\nThe 36-year-old PGA Tour professional from Statesville, North Carolina, stated that LIV’s inception has brought him financial benefits. However, he is not the only one. Many professionals on the PGA Tour have benefited indirectly from LIV’s inception. As former CEO Greg Norman highlighted, the Saudi-backed league disrupted the market, which was essential to restoring balance.\n\nBefore LIV’s arrival, the prize pools for PGA Tour events weren’t that large. And there weren’t many additional benefits that athletes enjoy today. For instance, the PGA Tour started its for-profit entity and offered equity stakes to golfers. The standard prize pool on the PGA Tour was around $8-$9 million. Then came LIV Golf, offering $20-$25 million per event. This put pressure on the PGA Tour to pay golfers more.\n\nThus, the PGA Tour started elevating events in 2023, which officially became the Signature Events in 2024. These events feature higher prize money of around $20 million or more.\n\nSince Tom Hoge performed well in 2022, he has been eligible to play Signature Events until now. In 2025, too, he was eligible for and played all Signature Events. He posted strong results in many of them, including T8 at The Sentry ($550,000), T3 at THE PLAYERS Championship ($1,325,000), T5 at Valero Texas Open ($304,000), T14 at the Masters ($336,000), and T7 at the Memorial ($603,200). These finishes underscore his claim of major financial gains from post-LIV Tour upgrades.\n\nIn 2024, he also finished strongly at many events. Hoge received $642,500 at the 2024 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am, $646,000 at the 2024 The Genesis Invitational, $389,666 at the 2024 Arnold Palmer Invitational, and $1,160,000 at the Travelers Championship. This shows that a large part of his official money came from the Signature events in both 2024 and 2025.\n\nWhile he enjoys the financial benefits, he also misses playing with some of the best golfers. Playing against strong competitors makes an athlete strong. Jon Rahm, Bryson DeChambeau, Joaquin Niemann, and Patrick Reed are some of the many gold golfers playing LIV Golf. Their exclusion from PGA Tour events influences the field’s strength, which also impacts the OWGR points.\n\nAlthough Tom Hoge is happy with almost every change the PGA Tour has gone through after LIV’s inception, he dislikes one thing that may come from 2027.\n\nTiger Woods’s Future Competition Committee (FCC) planned for a redesigned schedule from 2027. The new schedule will likely feature fewer events and may start in February instead of January. Woods and the FCC aim to mitigate viewership competition from the NFL in January. CEO Brian Rolapp supports this view and the redesigned schedule. However, Tom Hoge doesn’t.\n\nHoge told Golf Channel the pre-LIV model worked well. It allowed players to pick events freely with equal stature throughout the season. He praised past flexibility where stars like Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson elevated chosen events without a rigid top-heavy structure. If the redesigned schedule reduces the number of events, it will take away this flexibility. Therefore, Hoge opposed a reduced schedule. Instead, he valued the ability to take a month off or play four straight weeks.\n\nTom Hoge’s comments highlight how LIV Golf’s arrival reshaped his financial outlook while also changing the competitive feel of the PGA Tour. As golf moves toward another possible shift, his perspective reflects both gratitude for new opportunities and concern for what may be lost.\n\nThe post Greg Norman Was Right All Along as PGA Tour Champ Owns Up to Benefiting from LIV Golf appeared first on EssentiallySports.",

    "description": "In a client-server world, identity and authority are anchored in a server that logs people in and enforces\npermissions. When you take the server away, though, it might seem like there’s no solid foundation for\nauthentication or authorization. Is there a principled way to establish trust in a distributed application?",
    "fullText": "When I first started thinking about authentication and authorization in a local-first context I\nfound it super weird and confusing, like I’d stepped through the looking-glass. I found myself\nwrestling with big philosophical questions like “where does authority ultimately come from?” and\n“what does it mean to know someone?“.\n\nI’m going to walk you through my journey, from that initial disorientation to what I believe are\nsolid, principled approaches, in the course of developing the @localfirst/auth library.\n\nIt might not be obvious why this might be disorienting, so I’ll explain.\n\nWithout a server, it’s not clear where authority or identity come from.\n\nTraditional authentication and authorization ultimately “root out” in a physical piece of hardware,\nowned and controlled by a company that you’ve decided to trust. The hardware is a server that has\nyour username and password and rules about what you’re allowed to do. It might be controlled by your\nemployer, or a SaaS provider, or a big tech company.\n\nThe server is like a guard at the castle gates. If the server doesn’t recognize you, it doesn’t let\nyou in. If the server doesn’t think you should be allowed to have something, it doesn’t give it to\nyou.\n\nOf course, the whole point of local-first software is that we don’t love that arrangement.\n\nBut when you take away that central server, you’re losing the thing that all our notions of security\nare anchored to.\n\nIf all you have is clients, who are peers — which means they relate to each other as equals — then\nhow do we know who is who? How do we know who to trust? What do permissions even mean — who exactly\nis “giving permission”?\n\n“Bootstrapping” has become a word that we associate with something as easy and routine as turning\nyour computer on. But the whole point of bootstrapping as a metaphor is that it’s supposed to be\nimpossible: You can’t lift yourself up by pulling on your bootstraps.\n\nIt’s like living in a monarchy and realizing that the king is just another person, and not someone\nappointed by the gods. Just like countries making that transition from monarchy to democracy, we’re\nsuddenly adrift, and have to come up with completely new arrangements to solve problems that were\nalready solved — even if in a suboptimal way.\n\nWithout a server, it feels like we’re having to pull ourselves up by our bootstraps on some\nfundamental questions:\n\nIn 2020, a couple of weeks into the pandemic, I started work on a library that became\nlocalfirst/auth.\n\nI had to learn about modern cryptography starting from zero.\n\nI was immediately fascinated by how empowering public-key cryptography is, in the sense that it\ncan put me on an equal footing with even very powerful adversaries.\n\nThe movies would lead you to believe that defeating encryption is something a dude in a hoodie can\ndo just by typing really hard.\n\nBut in the real world strong cryptography can’t be defeated.* It just\ncan’t.**\n\nHere is legendary cryptologist and mathematician Daniel J. Bernstein writing over a decade\nago:\n\nFor most cryptographic operations, there exist widely accepted primitives that have been\nextensively studied, and breaking them is considered computationally infeasible on any existing\ncomputer cluster.\n\nThe point is you don’t need a lot of money, or computing power, or specialized equipment. Strong\nencryption doesn’t cost any more than weak encryption. It doesn’t cost any more to use a long\nencryption key than a short one. It’s just math. It’s just code.\n\nSo anyway I’m sitting down to work on this, and the first thing that makes my head spin is, how do\nyou know you’re talking to?\n\nWhen we collaborate or communicate online using a traditional cloud-based platform, we can think of\nthe service provider as vouching for us — introducing us to other people and confirming our\nidentity.\n\nIf I’m using Slack to talk to you, you know it’s me because Slack says it’s me, and you trust Slack.\nAnd maybe Slack knows it’s me because I logged in with Google: Google vouched for me, and Slack\ntrusts Google.\n\nIf we don’t want to put our trust in a centralized third party, then who will vouch us?\n\nIn a system where everyone’s a peer, then maybe peers could vouch for peers, in some kind of chain\nof trust.\n\nBut that chain has to be anchored somewhere: Maybe Charlie vouches for Bob to Alice, but who vouches\nfor Charlie?\n\nIgnoring the infinite regress problem for the moment, it seems clear that the solution will be\nsomething something public-key cryptography. But to do public-key cryptography, you need to know\npeople’s public keys.\n\n”Crypto is a tool for turning a whole swathe of problems into key management problems. Key\nmanagement problems are way harder than virtually all cryptographers think.”\n\n— Dr. Lea Kissner\n\nDr. Kissner was the head of information security at Twitter and I don’t think they meant the above\ntweet to be encouraging.\n\nBut I do find it encouraging. Even granting that key management is a hard problem, the idea that you\ncan collapse lots of different problems into this one problem is exciting, because you just have to\nfocus on solving that thing. If you can succeed at the key management thing — it’s is a big if — but\nif you can, then you can solve this “whole swathe of problems.”\n\nSo how do we learn people’s public keys?\n\nHere in Spain, I can obtain a certificate from the treasury department to install in my browser,\nwhich allows me to transparently authenticate to government websites and sign official documents\ndigitally.\n\nThe most obvious solution is to have some trusted party keep a directory of people and their public\nkeys, and of course that’s totally a thing that exists.\n\nThe certificate authorities (CAs) that make secure https connections possible are an example. Some\nbig companies have their own certificate authorities to anchor their employees’ digital identities.\nAnd countries can do the same for residents.\n\nThis is what my public PGP\nkey looks\nlike.\n\nBut we’re trying to do this without depending on centralized services.\n\nIf you want a decentralized solution, the alternative seems to be for people to actively share their\nown keys directly with each other.\n\nThis was the approach taken by PGP (“Pretty Good Privacy”) in the 1990s.\n\nPGP was the first encryption toolset intended for ordinary users. The idea was that people would put\ntheir public keys on their websites and in their email signatures. Apparently there were key signing\nparties where people exchanged and signed each other’s keys.\n\nFrom the looks of it these parties were lit.🥳\n\nIn 2014, Keybase had a better idea: People can just post their public keys in\nmachine-readable form on public sites where they have accounts, like Twitter or GitHub. They called\nthese “social proofs”. Then anyone can look up a person’s public keys by username, and use them to\nverify their identity.\n\nI’ve used Keybase to “verify myself” by posting machine-readable statements on\nTwitter,\nGitHub, and\nReddit\n\nThe first applications to truly bring end-to-end encryption to the masses were messaging apps. The\nSignal protocol came out in 2013, and two years later WhatsApp brought it to their entire customer\nbase, and overnight about a billion people were using encrypted messaging. Since then WhatsApp’s\nuser base grew to two billion and then to three billion, making it one of the most widely used\ncommunication tools in all of human history.\n\nThis succeeded because they made encryption transparent to the user. The key insight is that a\npublic key will never be like an email or a telephone number. It’s not a stable component of our\ndigital identity. Wrangling encryption keys is a job for computers, not for people. Devices should\njust generate keys as needed and we should never see them or have to think about them. Private keys\nshould never leave the device, and public keys should be shared automatically with other devices.\n\nWe’re agreed, then, that device-to-device sharing of keys is better than key signing parties. But\nAlice’s device still needs to know that Bob’s device is really Bob’s device, and not Eve’s device\npretending to be Bob’s device.\n\nTOFU considered squishy. Image: Yoav Aziz\n\nWhatsApp and Signal take an approach called “Trust On First Use”, or TOFU. Here’s how that works:\n\nThere’s a little risk there, they’re both taking a little leap of faith, but it’s a one-time thing,\nit’s probably fine.\n\nThat seems reasonable. The problem, though, is that the “first use” bit is kind of misleading,\nbecause in practice TOFU doesn’t happen just once.\n\nRemember, the keys we care about are device-level keys, not user-level keys. So what happens when\nBob gets a new phone, or Alice reinstalls the software on her laptop?\n\nWhat happens is an “account reset”, and at that point we’re back to TOFU — except that now, the\nattack scenarios are a bit more plausible: an impostor might have engineered the reset, and it would\nbe more feasible to exploit it.\n\nWhen a user has an account reset, the messaging apps suggest to everyone they communicate with that\nthey compare “security codes” or “safety numbers”. Most users don’t do this — I never have, I can’t\nimagine that people less technical than me do this.\n\nAnd anyway this is bad enough for a single pairwise connection; where this all really falls apart is\nin a large group, where the number of pairwise connections scales exponentially with the size of the\ngroup.\n\nWith a balanced PAKE, both parties need to know the password.\n\nSo when you want to connect with someone and don’t know their public key, is there an alternative to\nTOFU for securing that initial connection?\n\nThe most promising approach is to first share a single-use password out of band (in person, or via a\nchannel you already trust). There is whole a family of cryptographic protocols that support this,\ncalled PAKEs (for “password-authenticated key exchange”).\n\nWe’re saying “password” but it’s generally presented as an invitation code.\n\nIn the most common forms, both parties need to know the secret code; this is called a balanced\nPAKE.\n\nThe downside is that the inviter and invitee need to connect directly to validate the invitation.\n\nWith an asymmetric PAKE, a third party can verify the password without knowing it.\n\nWith an asymmetric PAKE (asymmetric because the verifier doesn’t need to know the password) a\nthird party can validate an invitation code without knowing it in advance or asking for it.\n\nThis brings us back to Keybase. In 2017 or so, they decided to try to monetize by building a\nSlack-but-encrypted thing for enterprise customers. They quickly realized that even if the global\nnerd population thought the idea of putting your public key on Twitter was really cool, Jim in\nAccounts Payable is probably just not going to do that. Sorry, it’s just not going to happen.\n\nSo they needed a way to bootstrap that initial key exchange, and they proposed something called a\nSeitan Token Exchange (presumably “seitan” because it’s not as\nsoft as tofu).\n\nThis is the approach I stole for localfirst/auth. At the time I didn’t know a PAKE from a hole in\nthe ground, but as it turns out this is essentially an asymmetric PAKE.\n\nWe’ve been talking about “identity”; but the beauty of this approach is that identity doesn’t need\nto mean “who you are in the world”, in the sense of linking to your real name or email or whatever —\nit can just mean “who you are to me“.\n\nRather than linking identity to a name or an email address, we link it to a relationship.\n\nFor example, in Ink & Switch’s Backchannel project one\nof the motivating use cases was connecting an anonymous source to a journalist. With a system like\nthis the source doesn’t have to have a name at all; the only thing that matters is that they’re able\nto interact once.\n\nTrust and identity are ultimately rooted in real-world relationships and interactions between human\nbeings. I know you because we interact, whether that’s face-to-face or online. That’s what it\nmeans to “know” someone. And we can use that interaction to bootstrap cryptographically secure\nconnections going forward. And if you have those secure connections with other people and I trust\nyou, I can benefit from your connections, and so on, forming a network of trust relationships.\n\nThat helps us clear up our thinking about identity:\n\nA. Real-world human interactions and relationships.\n\nThis feels correct to me: It’s natural, human-scale, and rooted in social reality.\n\nThe server-centric model roots our identity in getting distant corporations to vouch for us.\n\nWith this model, instead can we vouch for ourselves:\n\nAnd we can vouch for each other:\n\nIs it possible to have a secure, distributed access control list?\n\nSo now I have a way of knowing it’s you. But how do I know if you’re on my team? How do I know if I\nshould share this document with you, or if you should be able to edit it?\n\nOn a server this information is often recorded in some kind of access control list (ACL). So\nmaybe we need that, but distributed — everybody needs a copy of the same list. How would that work?\n\nMy first thought was that we could just put this information in an Automerge document and replicate\nit across everyone’s devices that way. But we can’t just let anyone edit this document at will. It\nshould be obvious if anyone changes the permissions, and we need to know who changed the\npermissions, and if they … had permission to do so? Do we need an ACL for the ACL?\n\nLet’s ignore that rabbit hole of infinite regress for the moment and focus on the mechanics. We need\na way of replicating a document that is:\n\n✅ tamper-evident: it shouldn’t be possible for someone to surreptitiously modify the list\n\n✅ eventually consistent: everybody should have the same list\n\n✅ authenticated: we need to know who has written changes to the list\n\nSo let’s look at some options for data structures.\n\nWhen we say “tamper-resistant” the first thing you might think of is a hash chain (or\nblockchain), where each link contains a cryptographic hash of the previous link, so it’s\nimpossible to modify one link or change the order without breaking the chain.\n\nThe problem is that this chain needs to be linear. Replicating it while ensuring consistency\nrequires enforcing a strict ordering; and cryptocurrency blockchains are famously … not optimized\nfor efficiency.\n\nTo accomplish this without burning enough fossil fuels to power multiple small countries, we could\nuse a hash graph. A hash graph is a hash chain plus branching. A CRDT like Automerge combines a\nhash graph with automatic conflict resolution logic to support replication with eventual\nconsistency. Git works the same way but with manual conflict resolution.\n\n✅ tamper-evident\n\n✅ eventually consistent\n\nSo far so good. But we still need a way of verifying who made which changes to our distributed\naccess control list.\n\nA signature graph is a hash graph where the individual operations are signed by the author. This\ngives us all three things.\n\n✅ tamper-evident\n\n✅ eventually consistent\n\n✅ authenticated\n\nIf you look at the work of anyone who’s trying to tackle this problem, you’re going to see some kind\nof signature graph: the Matrix protocol,\nDXOS’s HALO, Fission’s\nUCANs, etc. It’s a case of convergent evolution — we’ve all more\nor less independently landed on this data structure.\n\nThe way this works, concretely, is that there’s a series of operations on the group:\n\nThe first link, the root of the chain, marks the creation of the group and by definition adds\nthe founder to the group as an admin. It also includes the founder’s public keys.\n\nEach subsequent link represents an administrative action such as inviting a member, removing a\nmember, promoting a member to admin (or another role), or demoting a member.\n\nEach link contains a cryptographic hash of the preceding link, so the order of the links\ncannot be altered.\n\nEach link contains a digital signature of its content by the member making the change, so that\nits authenticity can be independently verified, and so that the link body cannot be tampered with.\n\nWhen I found a group, I am the only member and the only authority. I can decide to add members, and\nI can decide to delegate authority to them as well. Another member with admin authority could even\nremove me from the group.\n\nThis is a key point that we’ll come back to: In a group, authority is rooted in the act of\ncreating the group.\n\nTo be replicable, this data structure needs to be a CRDT. However, you can’t model group permissions\nusing a JSON CRDT like Automerge. I’ll explain why.\n\nHere we have two concurrent actions, but there’s no conflict, and we can resolve this by picking one\nor the other in an arbitrary but deterministic order. So far, nothing a generic CRDT couldn’t handle.\n\nWhat if someone takes actions while concurrently being removed? For example, what if Bob adds\nCharlie to the group and concurrently, Alice removes Bob from the group? Now we have a conflict.\n\nQ. Is Charlie in the group or not?\n\nIt’s important to resolve this correctly, or else Bob could circumvent his removal by writing a\nconcurrent operation adding proxy-Bob to the group.\n\nA: No. Removals always take precedence. We resolve that conflict by prioritizing removals. A\ngeneric CRDT like Automerge won’t be able to resolve this conflict in a principled way; it won’t\neven see it as a conflict. So this has to be implemented as a custom CRDT engine.\n\nWhat if two admins remove each other concurrently? (Or more generally, what if there’s a cycle of\nconcurrent removals?)\n\nAs a scenario involving two legitimate members of the group, this is far-fetched and unlikely to\nhappen. A more realistic and worrying scenario might be, for example, a compromised and revoked\ndevice trying to undo its revocation.\n\nOption 1: Remove both The logical conclusion of “removals take precedence” is to remove both.\n\nHowever, this seems unlikely to be the correct way of resolving the issue. It leaves Charlie\norphaned in a group without admins and creates an opening for a denial-of-service attack, where a\nrogue device blows up the group rather than allowing itself to be removed.\n\nOption 2: Fork the group Another approach is to “fork the world” into two parallel versions of\nthe same group: one where Alice stays and one where Bob stays. Then each member decides which world\nthey want to live in. This reflects the reality of a decentralized system.\n\nI suspect that in practice it’d be hard to communicate what’s going on to most users, and it would\njust be confusing and upsetting.\n\nI call option 2 the “Papal Schism” approach, in honor of the time when there were two popes and all of\nCatholic Christendom had to decide which one to follow.\n\nOption 3: Keep the senior member The solution I settled on is to let seniority be a proxy for\nwho is more likely to be in the right. In this case, Alice has been in the group longer than Bob, so\nshe stays.\n\nThe key insight for me was that the root node of a signature graph gives you an anchor for\nauthority. If I create a group, by definition I get to decide who’s in it.\n\nAt the moment of creation, Alice is the absolute dictator of a group with no other members: Alice\ndecides who to add to the group. Alice decides if she wants to delegate her authority to other\nmembers. She can make everyone else an admin too.\n\nThis delegates the right to remove anyone, including herself, from the group. But even once she’s\ngone, the authority behind any action — any addition or removal of members, any further delegation\nof authority — can always be traced back to the authority inherent in her act of creation.\n\nWe started with two big questions about how we find our footings in a local-first world.\n\nThe Seitan protocol that I decided to use, like any other flavor of PAKE, is complex and involves\nmany cryptographic subtleties. But any invitation protocol, no matter how involved, has something\nvery simple at its core: An interaction that takes place in the context of some existing\nrelationship.\n\nIn the beginning there was a relationship.\n\nAt first, it felt like cheating, or a cop-out, to rely on a “pre-existing trusted side channel” to\ntransmit this invitation. But it’s not at all. And it’s not a minor thing or an implementation\ndetail either — in fact, it’s the core of this whole thing.\n\nHow does Alice know it’s Bob? Because Alice and Bob had that interaction where Alice communicated\nthe invitation code to him, and Bob is able to prove that he’s the one she had that interaction\nwith.\n\nThe fact that this pre-existing channel exists at all is very significant; it only exists because\nthere is some kind of pre-existing relationship between Alice and Bob in the real world.\n\nSo, that’s our answer: preexisting human interactions and relationships are what anchor\nidentity.\n\nWhen you found a company, you decide who you want to invite to work with you. Depending on how you\nset things up, you might end up being removed from the company later on. But the authority to do\nthat can ultimately be traced back to delegations of authority you made.\n\nWhen you start any kind of project, you decide who you want to go on that journey with you, or if\nyou want to go it alone.\n\nWhen you begin writing a document, you don’t have to share it with anyone - you could keep it to\nyourself forever. If you do share it, the details are up to you: Do you share it with the whole\nworld? Just with your team? Just with one person? Whose input will you pay attention to?\n\nNone of this gives you any power over anyone outside the context of the thing you created: They can\nchoose whether to accept, and they can stop collaborating with you at any time.\n\nIt only recently occurred to me that authority and authorship come from the same root word.\n\nAuthority is rooted in authorship, in the act of creation.\n\nSo. These are the answers I’ve found to our big questions. I think they’re good answers. As it\nturns out, not only you can anchor decentralized security on something solid, but the foundation\nwe’ve found is something more legitimate, more satisfying, more human than a distant company’s\n“because I said so”.\n\nIf you’re looking to secure a local-first application, take a look at my\n@localfirst/auth library, which is a working\nimplementation of these ideas, including an auth provider for integration with\nautomerge-repo.\n\nAt some point in the process of creating localfirst/auth, I realized that I’d made a custom CRDT; so\nI extracted the machinery for creating, validating, and interpreting signature chains into the\nCRDX package. This can be used on\nits own to create an encrypted, authenticated CRDT with bespoke conflict detection and resolution\nlogic.\n\nIf you take any of this out for a spin — or if you have questions about how it works — please get in\ntouch with me — via one of the (pre-existing, trusted) channels listed below!\n\nThis library’s shape emerged from a series of conversations early on with Peter Van\nHardenberg of Ink & Switch. Peter drilled\ninto my head the idea that device keys should be generated locally and never leave the device, and\npointed me towards Keybase’s signature chains.\n\nMartin Kleppmann of Cambridge University has been very generous\nwith his time and expertise. Martin is the creator of\nAutomerge and co-author with Peter of Ink & Switch’s\nlocal-first manifesto. Much of localfirst/auth is an\nexpression in code of his theoretical work. Every time I’ve been stuck on something, Martin has\nco-written a paper that solves that exact thing. These two papers were particularly helpful:",

    "fullText": "When I swapped my iPhone for a Nokia, Walkman, film camera and physical map, I wasn’t sure what to expect. But my life soon started to change\n\nWhen two balaclava-clad men on a motorbike mounted the pavement to rob me, recently, I remained oblivious. My eyes were pinned to a text message on my phone, and my hands were so clawed around it that they didn’t even bother to grab it. It wasn’t until an elderly woman shrieked and I felt the whoosh of air as the bike launched back on to the road that I looked up at all. They might have been unsuccessful but it did make me think: what else am I missing from the real world around me?\n\nBefore I’ve poured my first morning coffee I’ve already watched the lives of strangers unfold on Instagram, checked the headlines, responded to texts, swiped through some matches on a dating app, and refreshed my emails, twice. I check Apple Maps for my quickest route to work. I’ve usually left it too late to get the bus, so I rent a Lime bike using the app. During the day, my brother sends me some memes, I take a picture of a canal boat, and pay for my lunch on Apple Pay. I walk home listening to music on Spotify and a long voice note from a friend, then I watch a nondescript TV drama, while scrolling through Depop and Vinted for clothes.\n\nI’m constantly contactable, I have no personal boundaries, and my attention span disappeared a long time ago. Since the first iPhone in 2007, smartphones have become indispensable to modern life, with the average person in the UK spending four hours and 20 minutes online per day. “Social media provides frictionless access to an infinite universe of mostly free digital drugs,” says Anna Lembke, author of Dopamine Nation. “And the algorithm tailors the experience for each unique brain, making it very reinforcing, while also injecting just enough novelty in the infinite scroll to overcome boredom and tolerance. All these features combined keep us clicking and swiping long after we want to.” Over time we develop tolerance, which means “we need more of it and a more potent form to get the same effect.”\n\nIncreased screen time has been associated with depression, anxiety and poorer sleep. But is it possible to live lo-fi in a hi-tech world? For a month, I tried: swapping my iPhone for a Nokia which I can only use to text, call and play Snake; also, a Walkman and a film camera. I picked up physical copies of books, newspapers and magazines; I used a London A-Z for directions, and hunted down my physical bank cards or tried to use cash. The only screen time exception was for work, where from 9-5 I used my laptop to respond to emails and write.\n\n“You’re going to look like such a performative hipster,” my flatmate Ben says, as I’m setting up my new devices. He’s right. I leave the Walkman behind, but my bag is still heavier than usual with my book, notepad, A-Z and wallet. I haven’t taken the bus into work yet from my new home so I follow a hand-drawn map to the stop and run for a bus. I stupidly didn’t write down the bus number but that one sounds familiar. It’s not the one, two friendly strangers tell me, but I can swap on to another at Angel. “We’ve outsourced our memory to our phones,” says Nicholas Kardaras, author of Digital Madness and a former assistant clinical professor of psychology at Stony Brook University, New York. “And unfortunately the ease and comfort of being lubricated by technology just means our human skills atrophied. It is use it or lose it.”\n\nThe bus is crawling. Normally, I would have looked up a different route. I try to message a friend back but it’s difficult having to click each button multiple times for the letter I want. “Hard work,” I manage. I read for the rest of the journey.\n\nOn my lunch break, my sister and I go for a walk around the park. When she leaves me to do another lap, I have an urge to check Instagram and my emails but I’m only getting the odd SMS. I’m craving the back-and-forth WhatsApps with friends telling me fun facts about their day. I feel a little unsettled, but I try to focus on the changing leaves on the trees. I have thoughts that wouldn’t usually have the time to surface. How stressful.\n\nAfter work, I go to see the saxophone player cktrl at the ICA. I’m a little worried about collecting the tickets without access to the Dice app I bought them on, but I show them my passport instead. I would normally join the throngs of people filming a song or two, so I could upload some blurred clips with poor sound to social media to show that I had a great time. But I can’t, so I watch him play, undistracted. Then a flashlight glares behind me, as someone films an entire track. I vow never to be that annoying person again.\n\nMy digital detox is starting to stress out my friends. Nicole finally gets through to me, saying: “I hate your dumb phone.” She’s been texting, but didn’t realise you had to click twice to make it send as an SMS not an iMessage. Another friend wants to share a dating story and texts: “Omg this is a terrible time not to access voice note.” And, when my landlord messages asking us to send pictures of the new carpet on WhatsApp, which I can’t do, Ben texts: “You’re going to be such a liability this month.”\n\nIn the evening, my date sends me the address of a pub to meet him at “for your A-Z”. I allow lots of time to decipher its tiny font and navigate my way there. He’s running late, so I sit by the fireplace in the pub and read my book. I look like I’m waiting for someone to chat me up. When he arrives, he shows me how to turn on predictive text, which is a relief for my very tired thumbs.\n\nAt lunchtime, I put on the terrestrial TV and watch Escape to the Country, where I learn about the housing market in Herefordshire. I want to cook myself an elaborate meal – for dinner, and also for entertainment, but when I get to the shops, I remember that I can’t look up a recipe on my phone, so I settle for tomato pasta.\n\nMy flatmate picked up a Nina Simone CD for me in a charity shop. I try to play it on my Walkman, but realise it needs batteries. On my lunch break I buy some (who knew there were so many sizes?) and walk home from the office listening to it. Spotify can be overwhelming with its hundred million tracks, so it’s nice to remove the element of choice and focus on the album as it was intended, not scrambled by shuffle mode. Rosanna Irwin, who runs Samsú – a collection of digital detox cabins in Ireland – knows the importance of analogue listening: she leaves her guests with cassette tapes she makes with her father. After reaching a state of burnout, working long hours in tech – first at Meta and later for a climate tech company – she visited the Danish island of Samsø with her husband in 2023, and found peace amid the scrappy phone service and incredible nature.\n\n“My mental health was very poor,” she says. “I was spending a lot of time online and I did an accidental digital detox on this island and came back invigorated from the experience.” She recommends a three-day retreat. “There’s a lot of science to show that it’s around 72 hours in nature where the true magic starts to happen.”\n\nI meet my friend at Vauxhall station, and we walk to a cafe for breakfast, then to Tate Britain. Camilla is pretty offline: she’s a doctor and doesn’t have social media. She rarely responds to texts and is maybe one of the most joyful people I know. But she says she feels so much guilt about not replying sooner and hates the fact that phones are like this ever-present person in the room, distracting you from being totally engaged with the real-life friends around you.The sentiment resonates with me; we both want to be more spontaneous.\n\nInspired by our conversation, I call Aakriti, who doesn’t live too far away. I meet her and two of her friends and we eat empanadas. On the way home, I have to ask the only man on the platform for help. The overground isn’t due for 24 minutes, so I wonder if there is a faster route. There isn’t, so I shiver at the outdoor station wishing I could book an Uber.\n\nIt’s tipping down with rain when I arrive at Canada Water, and I don’t want to ruin my A-Z to search for Rotherhithe Street. I know The Mayflower pub is on the river and ask a man at a convenience store to point me in the right direction. I’m early, so I squint at my book in the candle-lit pub, feeling very Victorian. There’s a hilarious waiter, who is telling dating stories from Grindr, and it’s much better than my book. This no-technology thing is making me nosy. I pay for my roast with cash, which feels almost fake now, like I’m in a game. Then my friend and I go to the cinema – the Picturehouse in central London, because it’s in between where we both live. They charge us £20 for a ticket, which I would never have paid had I known before we made the trip. I’m left fuming, but luckily the movie is good.\n\nI need to call the bank. My flatmate has sent rent money to my Monzo account, which I can only access on the app, and I get a text saying that I’ve gone into an unarranged overdraft. When I get to the tube in the morning, my Oyster card has run out, so I top up the credit and miss my train – I would usually have used a payment card on Apple Pay instead. I have to wait eight minutes for the next one. I’m flustered by the time I get to the office and feel stressed about not being able to check how much money is in my account or transfer money between accounts.\n\nThere’s a group of children on a school trip on my train. The teacher is trying to keep them entertained by getting them to play a word association game. “When I say ‘bread’,” she says. “You could say, ‘sandwich’. Let’s have a go. ‘School,’” the teacher says. “Prison,” a child shouts back. When I arrive in Notting Hill, I study the map at the station to make sure I surface from the correct exit. I memorise key landmarks so I know where to turn – the Gate Cinema is by the road I need to get to Uxbridge Street. I’m late, and don’t have time for mistakes, so I start walking down the street quickly, scouring every restaurant until I find the Palestinian cafe I’m looking for.\n\nThe worries I felt at the start of the experiment about getting lost and not being able to communicate with friends seem to have diminished. I’m calmer, and present when I’m with people. I look around the train on my morning commute and notice that everyone except one person has their eyes glued to their phones. The man opposite me doesn’t have earphones, a phone or a book. I try not to catch his eye, as I’m worried I’ve been staring. Things are less relaxed when I try to meet my friend Navid after work. We can’t pick a place to meet and he is frustrated because he can’t send me links: “Please return to WhatsApp you Neanderthal.” He’s late, so I wait outside the station for 45 minutes. He arrives with a big grin, knowing I’m a bit irritated, but I get my own back by torturing him with two hours of experimental jazz.\n\nAfter work, I go to see my friend Scarlett, who is being held captive by a corgi puppy. It’s dark and damp when I arrive in south-east London but I’ve written out the directions to the house as carefully as I can. I didn’t bring my A-Z because my bag was too heavy, but I’m certain I can’t mess up the 10-minute walk. I call my mum and we natter for 20 minutes before I realise I haven’t spotted the turning. In a panic, I ask her to look up my location on Google Maps, which is obviously cheating, but I’m now late and in the middle of a cemetery. I’ve gone completely the wrong way and she has to narrate the route to my destination.\n\nIt’s been a busy weekend so far and I feel like having a lazy day. I walk to a yoga class and then go for a wander. As I’m walking, and listening to my one CD, I get a call from the guy I’m dating who has just finished work. We try to hunt down a board game to play, but when the local charity shops fail us, we pick up some newspapers and magazines and the ingredients for a roast chicken instead. We then sit on the sofa playing music and reading in the old fashioned way. It feels like we’ve retired.\n\nI finally get around to calling the bank to pay my rent, which is late for the first time. I’ve been putting off the inevitable 20-minute call that includes reading out lots of sort codes and bank numbers and spelling the names of my landlord along with the various friends I owe money to. It’s quite unnerving transferring money without checking the details with my own eyes, and the woman on the phone keeps telling me that it would be much easier to do this online.\n\nFor all the frustrations of the month, I’m sad the experiment is over. I’m left with the feeling that living offline puts other people out: if we’re looking for a place to eat or a pub to go to it’s down to them, they’re on map duty, and I’m not able to book Ubers. But I was happier and calmer – relieved of the endless scrolling, waiting for texts back, and the need to communicate with people all the time. After about a week, I wasn’t reaching for my phone and I had the patience to read. It was nice not to be able to look at my work emails in the evening. I’m determined to delete my main distractions: Depop, Hinge and Instagram. Scouring charity shops for clothes is much more satisfying; dating with no distractions is so much easier; and I can live without reels about botched Botox and AI animals. “Big tech platforms are not addictive accidentally, they’re addictive by design,” says Kardaras. “They’re selling their product by targeting the vulnerable: if the algorithm detects that a young person has a body image issue or is struggling with self-harm or depression, then they bombard them with content on that subject that exacerbates their mental unwellness.” On my last day, I get an email from Scarlett: “Splashed my phone with water whilst listening to the Lily Allen album in the bath, now phoneless and actually want to copy you.” It seems I’m not the only one keen to disconnect.",

    "description": "A new report warns the U.S. could lose the ability to sustain combat within weeks of a China war over Taiwan, as munitions run dry, logistics collapse and global markets face a $10T shock.",
    "fullText": "FIRST ON FOX: The Trump administration asked for redactions to a sweeping new Heritage Foundation report modeling a potential U.S.–China war over Taiwan, even though the analysis relied entirely on publicly available, unclassified data, according to the report’s authors.\n\nThe redacted report, TIDALWAVE, warns that the United States could reach a breaking point within weeks of a high‑intensity conflict with China — conclusions that the authors say prompted senior national security officials to seek redactions over concerns adversaries could exploit the findings or use them to identify U.S. and allied military vulnerabilities.\n\nThose conclusions include warnings that U.S. forces would culminate far sooner than China, suffer catastrophic losses to aircraft and sustainment infrastructure in the Pacific, and still fail to prevent a global economic shock estimated at roughly $10 trillion, nearly a tenth of global GDP.\n\nSKIES AT STAKE: INSIDE THE US-CHINA RACE FOR AIR DOMINANCE\n\nAccording to the report's authors, the AI‑enabled model drew exclusively on open‑source government, academic, industry and commercial information. An unredacted version of the report was provided to authorized U.S. government recipients for internal use.\n\nUnlike traditional tabletop war games, TIDALWAVE employs an AI‑enabled model that runs thousands of iterations, tracking how losses in platforms, munitions, and fuel compound over time and drive cascading operational failure early in the conflict.\n\nAccording to a Heritage spokesperson, the report had been shown to \"high-level national security officials\" who requested some of the specifics be crossed out in black ink before its release to the public. The report still details how quickly U.S. forces could reach a breaking point and why the conflict would carry global consequences.\n\n\"Redactions were made at the request of the U.S. government to prevent disclosure of information that could reasonably enable an adversary to (1) re mediate or ‘close’ critical vulnerabilities that the United States and its allies could otherwise exploit, or (2) identify or exploit U.S. and allied vulnerabilities in ways that could degrade operational endurance, resilience, or deterrence,\" the report said.\n\nA Department of War spokesperson declined to comment on discussions surrounding TIDALWAVE's publication, but added: \"The Department of War does not endorse, validate, or adjudicate third-party analyses, nor do we engage publicly on hypothetical conflict modeling. As a general matter, we take seriously the protection of information that, if aggregated or contextualized, could have implications for operational security.\"\n\nThe White House could not be reached for comment.\n\nAccording to the report’s redacted findings, the U.S. would culminate in less than half the time required for the People's Republic of China in a high-intensity conflict. Culmination is defined as the point at which a force becomes incapable of continuing operations due to the loss of platforms, ammunition and/or fuel.\n\nThe report is explicit that the first 30 days to 60 days of a U.S.-China war determine its long-term shape and outcome, as early losses in aircraft, ships, fuel throughput and munitions rapidly compound and cannot be recovered on operationally relevant timelines.\n\nThe report concludes that the U.S. is not equipped nor arrayed to protect and sustain the Joint Force in a conflict with China in the Indo-Pacific. Rapid platform attrition, brittle logistics, concentrated basing and insufficient industrial surge capacity combine to force an early operational breaking point for American forces.\n\nThe report warns that U.S. reliance on a few large, concentrated forward bases — particularly in Japan and Guam — leaves American airpower dangerously exposed to Chinese missile forces.\n\nIn multiple scenarios, up to 90% of U.S. and allied aircraft positioned at major forward bases are destroyed on the ground during the opening phase of the conflict, as runways, fuel depots, command facilities and parked aircraft are hit simultaneously.\n\nThe report finds that critical U.S. precision‑guided munitions — including long‑range anti‑ship missiles, air‑to‑air interceptors and missile‑defense systems — begin to be unavailable within five to seven days of major combat operations. Across most scenarios, those critical munitions are completely exhausted within 35 days to 40 days, leaving U.S. forces unable to sustain high‑tempo combat.\n\nFuel emerges as the most decisive vulnerability of all. The report makes a critical distinction: the U.S. does not run out of fuel in most scenarios — it loses the ability to move fuel under fire.\n\nCHINA’S MISSILE SURGE PUTS EVERY US BASE IN THE PACIFIC AT RISK — AND THE WINDOW TO RESPOND IS CLOSING\n\nChinese doctrine explicitly prioritizes attacks on logistics vessels, ports, pipelines and replenishment tankers. Even limited tanker losses, port disruptions or pipeline severance are sufficient to drive fuel throughput below survivable levels, forcing commanders to sharply curtail air and naval operations despite fuel remaining in aggregate stockpiles.\n\nChinese ammunition stockpiles of critical munitions begin to be depleted after approximately 20 days to 30 days of major combat operations. However, substitution effects extend China’s ability to sustain combat operations out to months — well beyond the point at which U.S. forces culminate, according to the report.\n\nThe consequences extend far beyond the battlefield.\n\nThe redacted report concludes the U.S. is highly unlikely to prevent massive global economic fallout once a Taiwan conflict begins.\n\nDisruption of shipping lanes, destruction of critical infrastructure and the collapse of Taiwan’s semiconductor production would trigger a global economic shock estimated at roughly $10 trillion, with enduring ripple effects across financial markets, manufacturing and global trade.\n\nThe report comes amid years of concern over U.S. military readiness and industrial capacity, as China rapidly expands its naval forces and shipbuilding base.\n\nThe U.S. Navy operates a smaller fleet than planned, while American shipyards face workforce shortages, aging infrastructure and chronic delays — even as China, the world’s largest shipbuilder, continues to outpace the U.S. in producing new naval hulls.\n\nWar Secretary Pete Hegseth and other military leaders have vowed to put the Pentagon on a wartime footing for industrial capacity.\n\nPerhaps most alarming, TIDALWAVE warns that the scale of losses in the Indo‑Pacific would leave the U.S. unable to deter or respond effectively to a second major conflict elsewhere in the world.\n\nA war over Taiwan could open the door to follow‑on aggression by adversaries such as Russia, Iran or North Korea, fundamentally destabilizing the global security order.\n\nThe report is blunt in its assessment: existing Pentagon programs and congressional funding are too slow, too fragmented and too modest to address the scale of the challenge. In many cases, the timeline required to fix critical vulnerabilities exceeds the likely timeline to conflict.\n\nTo avoid what the authors describe as a strategic defeat, the report urges Congress to immediately expand munitions stockpiles, strengthen fuel reserves and distribution infrastructure, harden and disperse forward bases, and accelerate sustainment and logistics reforms. Without rapid action, the authors warn, the U.S. risks entering a conflict it is structurally unprepared to fight or sustain.\n\nWith intelligence warnings mounting that China could move on Taiwan before the end of the decade, TIDALWAVE cautions that the window to correct these deficiencies may be closing faster than Washington is prepared to act.",

    "fullText": "World Cup 2026 ticket holders can now access priority visa appointments for travel to the United States - but doubt remains whether fans from every country to have qualified will be able to enter.\n\nThe Fifa Prioritised Appointment Scheduling System - or Fifa Pass - announced by US President Donald Trump in November, went live on Tuesday.\n\nIt was introduced in part because citizens of some countries whose teams have qualified for the 2026 World Cup may not otherwise receive visa appointments in time for the tournament.\n\nBut the US State Department has stressed that a Fifa Pass appointment does not guarantee a visa will be approved, with all ticket holders having to \"undergo thorough security screening and vetting\".\n\nMost citizens of countries under the US visa waiver programme, which covers much of Europe, including the UK, along with Japan, Australia and others, can ordinarily travel visa-free for up to 90 days, so do not need to use the Fifa Pass. Travellers from those countries would need to apply instead for an Esta - an Electronic System for Travel Authorization.\n\nA senior State Department official said the new Fifa Pass system will cut wait times - with applicants in \"over 80%\" of countries now able to schedule a visa appointment in \"less that 60 days\".\n\nIt added: \"At the visa appointment, the applicant must show they qualify for the visa and plan to follow our laws and leave at the end of the tournament.

    "fullText": "Nathan Aspinall has opened up about his unusual experience at the Saudi Arabia Darts Masters, admitting the crowd “weren’t all there of their own accord” even as the event made headlines for its record-breaking $200,000 nine-dart prize.\n\nAspinall’s comments highlight the cultural differences faced by the Professional Darts Corporation (PDC) as it pushes into new global markets.\n\nThe Saudi Arabia Darts Masters, held at Riyadh’s Global Theater, marked the first PDC event in the kingdom, drawing world champion Luke Littler, Luke Humphries, and Michael van Gerwen to a country with strict no-alcohol laws and a developing darts fanbase.\n\nAspinall said the experience was “certainly different” and admitted that the atmosphere felt more restrained than the usual lively darts nights in the UK or Europe.\n\n“I’m not stupid. I feel like they [the crowd] weren’t all there of their own accord, shall we say, and it was quite a small venue,” he said. “Everything needs to start somewhere, but as long as people walk away from the week and are like, ‘You know what, we really enjoyed the darts’, and it gets good coverage.”\n\nThe Englishman said he enjoyed playing despite the muted energy and found humor in the crowd’s unfamiliarity with darts’ scoring quirks, laughing with opponent Lourence Ilagan as spectators clapped at the wrong moments during his opening win.\n\nThe PDC responded by saying all attendees were legitimate ticket-holders or guests and praised the event’s turnout, noting that the atmosphere and crowd make-up can differ from long-established European tournaments.\n\nBeyond the atmosphere, the event made global headlines for offering the biggest nine-darter prize in PDC history: a staggering $200,000 (£149,400). Any player who landed a perfect leg would take home $100,000 (£74,700), doubled to $200,000 if they finished on a bullseye.\n\nThe unprecedented prize pool reflects Saudi Arabia’s growing ambition to establish itself as a hub for elite sport, with similar investments seen in golf, Formula 1, and boxing.\n\nFor the PDC, the record bonus signals an opportunity to grow the sport in new regions, even as it navigates challenges around culture and fan engagement.\n\nAspinall’s candid comments may reflect those early growing pains, but his willingness to engage and the PDC’s record incentives show darts’ global expansion is gaining serious momentum.",

    "fullText": "Liverpool have a golden opportunity to sign the next Sadio Mane.\n\nThe Senegalese international was probably one of the best players to have ever played for the club. At this peak, Mane was the epitome of Jurgen Klopp's greatest era at the club.\n\nWhen he was running at defences, you just had confidence that Liverpool were going to be able to win games consistently.\n\nMane was a special player. Someone who was selfless and who worked hard for the team but who was also capable of individual brilliance.\n\nMost importantly, he was a top professional. This was apparent in the African Cup of Nations final on Sunday night with Mane staying on the pitch during Senegal's boycott after a dubious penalty was awarded against them.\n\nUltimately, Mane convinced his players to continue the game and played a key role in creating Senegal's winner to crown himself a champion for the second time in the tournament's history.\n\nIt's a remarkable time for Senegal right now. Mane is just the leading face of a golden generation and there is so much more to come.\n\nOne of the biggest factors behind Senegal's rise to prominence has been the Generation Foot academy. This is the academy that produced Mane and which has a partnership with FC Metz.\n\nAlongside Mane, they have also developed players like Ismaila Sarr, Pape Matar Sarr, Lamine Camara and many others.\n\nThey are the leading academy in Senegal and they always have exciting gems worth keeping an eye on who are ready to follow in Mane's footsteps.\n\nWe know Liverpool like to scout in Senegal. They've just signed Mor Talla Ndiaye from a Senegalese club and are expected to sign Sidy Barhama Ndiaye from another Senegalese side.\n\nBut they should now direct their attention to Generation Foot, where there is a really exciting young player who might just be the next Mane.\n\nLet us introduce you to Sega Fall Mbodji. He's only 16-years-old but he's already a regular member of Generation Foot's first-team, who play in Senegal's top tier.\n\nMbodji became the youngest ever goal-scorer in the club's history at 15-years-old earlier this season, and he's also the fourth youngest to make an appearance for the club.\n\nAn exciting winger with great technical skills, he can play on either wing and he is a brilliant dribbler.\n\nWhat stands-out about him is his decision making and his intelligent movement, Mbodji always receives the ball facing forward and ready to attack his opponent.\n\nHe makes clever runs behind the defensive lines and has the composure to finish chances.\n\nMaking history at such an impressive club and breaking records at his age is worth taking notice.\n\nRight now he's not made his mark at international level yet so this is a golden chance for Liverpool to strike and agree a deal for him to join the Reds, before the other big clubs start to sniff around for him.",

    "fullText": "Scores of private jets landed near Davos on Monday as the rich and powerful descended on the Alpine town for the World Economic Forum's annual meeting.\n\nBusiness Insider tracked at least 157 private jets that arrived near the Alpine town, using data from ADS-B Exchange and JetSpy. These flight-tracking tools don't participate in privacy systems that many business-jet owners have signed up for to hide their movements from most similar tools.\n\nMore than half of the flights tracked landed at Zurich International Airport. Another 45 came into Friedrichshafen, a German city on the shore of Lake Constance, just over the Swiss border. The rest were spread across other smaller airports in Switzerland.\n\nThey included airplanes belonging to Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff and the former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, according to data from JetSpy.\n\nJetSpy also showed numerous companies' private jets arriving in the area, including those of Aramco, BlackRock, Blackstone, Citigroup, Google, HP, JPMorgan Chase, Lockheed Martin, and the quantitative hedge fund Two Sigma.\n\nThe most popular private jet was the Gulfstream G650, representing 31 of the flights tracked by Business Insider.\n\nBuying one typically costs over $65 million. It can accommodate up to 19 people or be configured with a double bed and a shower.\n\nThe world's newest private jet, the G800, also appeared three times on Monday. Gulfstream only delivered the first one in August.\n\nAt 7,600 miles, the longest trip was made by the Gulfstream G700 that JetSpy says belongs to Benioff. It flew for 14½ hours from Hawaii. Meanwhile, a commercial flight would have taken two stops and over 24 hours.\n\nOther major journeys included airplanes arriving from Kuala Lumpur, Mumbai, and Uruguay.\n\nPrivate jets flew in from dozens of different countries, including Sierra Leone and Montenegro.\n\nLondon was the most popular departure point, with 19 flights coming from four airports in and around the British capital. However, many of these planes appear to have stopped only briefly on the way toward Davos. For example, a Google private jet spent 13 hours on the ground near London after arriving from San Jose.\n\n10 private jets departed from around New York, seven from the Bay Area metropolitan regions, and six from Dubai.\n\nDozens more are expected to arrive throughout the week.\n\nTuesday also saw the arrival of jets belonging to Bill Gates, Michael Dell, and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, according to data from JetSpy.",

    "description": "In his opening remarks at the World Economic Forum, Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, warned that AI could heighten wealth inequality.",
    "fullText": "Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, the world's largest asset management firm, kicked off the World Economic Forum on Tuesday with a critique of capitalism.\n\nMore wealth has been created since the fall of the Berlin Wall than at any other time in human history, but it has not translated into shared prosperity, said Fink, who was appointed as interim co-chair of the World Economic Forum in August 2025, replacing founder Klaus Schwab.\n\n\"In advanced economies, that wealth has accrued to a far narrower share of people than any healthy society can ultimately sustain,\" he said.\n\nFink warned that the pattern of unequal wealth distribution could repeat in the era of AI.\n\n\"Early gains are flowing to the owners of models, owners of data, and owners of infrastructure,\" said Fink.\n\n\"The open question, what happens to everyone else? If AI does to white collar workers what globalisation did to blue collar workers, we need to confront that today, directly.\"\n\nHe urged those gathered at the annual meeting in Davos to rethink how prosperity is defined and to create a \"credible plan\" for broad participation in the gains AI can deliver.\n\n\"This is going to be the test. Capitalism can evolve to turn more people into owners of growth instead of spectators watching it happen,\" said Fink.\n\nThe world's wealthiest 10% own roughly 75% of global wealth, while the poorest half hold only about 2%, according to the World Inequality Report 2026, released in December 2025 and based on data compiled by 200 researchers.\n\nFink acknowledged in his speech that the World Economic Forum has lost trust and \"feels out of step with the moment.\"\n\n\"Davos is an elite gathering trying to shape a world that belongs to everyone,\" Fink said, adding that the forum should be more transparent and precise about what economic success means, especially with those who don't feel represented at gatherings like Davos.\n\n\"Prosperity just isn't the growth in the aggregate. It's not just GDP. It can't be measured by GDP or the market caps of companies. It has to be judged by many people who see it, who can touch it, can feel it, and can build their own future on it,\" said Fink.\n\nFink has previously spoken about how the pandemic fueled a rethink of the US economy.\n\nIn his 2022 annual letter to shareholders, Fink said the growth of stakeholder capitalism — the idea that companies should prioritize interests beyond shareholders — was a natural evolution of how capitalism can best work to build a strong economy.\n\n\"It is through effective stakeholder capitalism that capital is efficiently allocated, companies achieve durable profitability, and value is created and sustained over the long-term,\" he said.\n\nBlackRock, which manages some $14 trillion in assets, has been one of the loudest voices in support of environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) investing, with Fink often highlighting climate change and sustainability in his annual letters.",

Maybe it's that there are reportedly a lot more people here than there have been in a long time.\n\nWhatever the case, everyone seems to be on edge. Multiple attendees told me they were already feeling exhausted, as if we were halfway through the week, even though we're just getting started.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's ongoing threats against Europe over his desire to take over Greenland have been a big talking point. Speculation continues to swirl about his Wednesday address.\n\nI heard the word \"trust\" used a lot yesterday in the context of the rising geopolitical tension and fears that we've reached a breaking point.\n\nFor the business world, that means a global economy that's a lot less … global. We've been headed in that direction for a while, but this week feels like an inflection point. Talk of the year ahead includes discussions about businesses needing to silo their global operations, even for digitally focused strategies.\n\nIt's not all doom and gloom. The conversations around AI have been fascinating, from the evolution of AI agents to concerns over cyber risks in the space to the potential that physical AI (think robots and autonomous systems) could be much larger than generative AI.\n\nFor more of our Davos coverage, please follow along on our live blog and",

The three-piece set, in its winter-white shade, featured a delicate floral print.\n\nShe wore the ensemble with ballet flats and chunky black glasses.\n\nIuliia Bazhan, a model and the founder of Evoautism, attended in a full Chanel getup.\n\nShe wore a jacket and miniskirt from the fashion house's Coco Neige collection, a floor-length coat, and white boots with thick chain detailing.\n\nOne attendee, photographed by Business Insider, accessorized his navy jacket with a multicolored scarf, sunglasses with orange-tinted lenses, and blue leather gloves.\n\nHe also wore a thick gold ring and a giant watch.\n\nOne woman was seen in Davos wearing a bright-pink suit with a white mock-neck top. On its own, the outfit was chic and feminine — especially when paired with her Louis Vuitton tote bag.\n\nHowever, she didn't accessorize with heels or jewelry. Instead, she wore tan snow boots and brown leather gloves.\n\nOf course, they're doing so fashionably. One person wore dark-wash jeans with white socks, red sneakers, and a puffy coat that combined both colors with others across its statement print.\n\nThey also wore a thick red scarf and a lilac beanie.\n\nSarah Backhouse, an executive director at executive networking company World Fifty Group, matched the fur collar of her Frankie Shop coat with a cozy fur hat.\n\nShe accessorized the ensemble with Saint Laurent sunglasses and a Maison Goyard bag.\n\nWealth manager Andrew Gan gave his suit a Davos upgrade with a fur-lined coat and sunglasses as he headed to the Philippines House to moderate.\n\nNidhi Sinja, the head of marketing and communications for BCG North America, opted to carry a notebook in her quilted weatherproof Tory Burch bag.\n\nShe coordinated the look with a North Face coat and L.L. Bean boots, both in cream hues that matched her white purse.\n\nWendy Diamond is the founder and CEO of Women's Entrepreneurship Day Organization. She's also an investor and board advisor for numerous companies.\n\nShe wore a green satin suit, a statement charm necklace, and thick black boots. She told Business Insider that green is her \"happy color,\" and that she likes to wear bright colors when \"the world is so dark.\"\n\nWhen the CEO of Philip Morris International US travels, even for long trips, she takes a carry-on. Her trick: Pick a color for the week and coordinate outfits around that, with travel-well fabrics. For Davos this week, the color is black.\n\nJonathan Nowak Delgado, a senior advisor at nonprofit ViaTalenta Foundation, per his business card, has a strategy to stand out at Davos: wear a mix of bold colors.\n\nHis outfit included a statement orange scarf, which his mother made for him.\n\nOne attendee photographed by Business Insider was seen wearing a tweed suit beneath a gray fuzzy coat and a thin, floral scarf.\n\nIn addition to the fabric layers, she wore black platform boots, white sunglasses, Chanel earrings, and a pink Prada handbag.\n\nJolie Hunt, the CEO of communications agency Hunt & Gather, has worn some of the event's most statement-making looks.\n\nOn Monday, she donned a printed minidress from Balmain with sheer tights, paired it with Larroudé x Libertine pumps adorned with lips, and carried an Hermès Birkin bag.",

The company had some success by having AI follow its old policies, but had a real \"breakthrough\" after its developers rebuilt everything from scratch.\n\nThat involved giving an AI agent clear underlying goals, Khosrowshahi said, such as making the customer feel good after the interaction.\n\n\"Allowing the AI actually to reason through that and throwing away all of the old policies is turning out to be the most promising way forward,\" he said.\n\nKhosrowshahi added that companies are essentially a \"bunch of policies,\" and that to get the full potential of AI, they would need to \"break down those rules and start over.\"\n\nInternally, Uber developers are using AI tools like Anysphere's Cursor and Anthropic's Claude, he added.\n\nMany companies have been ramping up their AI spending in the hope of unlocking productivity gains. A recent poll of IT professionals by RBC Capital found that 90% of respondents plan to spend more on AI this year.\n\nHowever, there are also fears that AI isn't always living up to the hype, and companies are grappling with concerns that it's eroding workers' skills.\n\nKhosrowshahi acknowledged that getting AI adoption right at a company isn't always plain sailing.\n\n\"You have to survive through a bunch of car crashes internally to do so,\" he said.",

    "fullText": "Five years ago, I changed careers from a dental hygienist to a full-time travel writer. Since then, I've spent much of each year on the road, researching destinations and traveling internationally.\n\nWhat I enjoy most, though, is planning and hosting trips for women.\n\nEach year, I bring small groups together in destinations around the world, and certain places consistently stand out.\n\nIt's rarely the most trendy or Instagram-famous locations that resonate most. Rather, the trips women love are built around places that feel safe, comfortable, and easy to enjoy together.\n\nThese are the five destinations I recommend most often for girls' trips, and a few must-try highlights in each spot.\n\nYork is perfect for a girls' trip because it's so easily walkable and has plenty to offer, from modern boutique shops and pubs to historic cobbled streets full of stories from the past.\n\nThe English city is also easily accessible by a short train ride from London or Edinburgh.\n\nPro tip: Book a historical walking tour with Mad Alice; she's phenomenal.\n\nIncredible outdoor experiences, restaurants, wildlife experiences, and temples are all within reach in this central part of Bali.\n\nUbud is also a great place for relaxation, as it's known for its first-class wellness resorts that still feel accessible, especially compared to similar retreats elsewhere in the world.\n\nPro tip: Hire a private driver while you're there, as traffic can feel overwhelming to navigate. Keep in mind that some resort packages, including several at Goddess Resorts, include access to a driver.\n\nWith about 300 days of sunshine a year, first-class wineries, white-washed buildings, and a beautiful coastline, Santa Barbara is a great travel destination in California.\n\nIts downtown is walkable and full of shops, and the newly revitalized Funk Zone is home to more restaurants, bars, and wine tasting rooms than I can count.\n\nPro tip: Take the Santa Barbara Trolley tour for a great overview of the city's sights and history.\n\nScottsdale is easily accessible for a range of travelers as it's just a short drive from the Phoenix Airport. Surrounded by the Sonoran Desert, the city's natural beauty is also visible around every turn.\n\nPro tip: Eat brunch at Hash Kitchen if you want to enjoy Instagrammable surroundings and a build-your-own Bloody Mary bar.\n\nIf you've ever wanted to feel ike you are the main character in a storybook, head to the charming Alsace region in France.\n\nA short train ride from Paris will land you right in the heart of Alsace, and you can explore numerous villages and wineries with both German and French influence.\n\nEach village has its own charm, but my favorites are Eguisheim, Obernai, and Ribeauville.\n\nPro tip: Go during December to see the villages come alive with Christmas markets — it's magical!",

    "fullText": "Steven Bartlett said one use of AI has mattered more to his business than anything else: translating his podcast into other languages.\n\n\"There's nothing more important than what we've done for our business than translations. Period,\" Bartlett said during the \"What it Takes to Build\" panel at the World Economic Forum at Davos on Tuesday.\n\nThe British entrepreneur and host of \"The Diary of a CEO\" podcast was in conversation with Jessica Lessin, the CEO of The Information, alongside Bret Taylor, formerly the co-CEO of Salesforce and CTO of Meta.\n\nBartlett said using AI tools to translate the podcasts was initially an \"expensive experiment.\" The problem he was trying to solve, he said, was reaching the untapped market of non-English speakers.\n\n\"If we're just in English, we're reaching like 10% of the world,\" Bartlett added.\n\nThere were technical challenges, too. Some languages use longer words, Bartlett said, meaning three-hour English-language conversations could become significantly longer when translated, risking the audio and video falling out of sync.\n\nTwo years ago, Bartlett announced on LinkedIn that \"The Diary of a CEO\" had hired a full-time data scientist who helped the company achieve a technological breakthrough, enabling them to use AI to translate the podcast into \"EVERY language.\"\n\nAt Davos and in the LinkedIn post, Bartlett did not elaborate on exactly how the AI translations work. Today, however, the videos show Bartlett speaking Spanish in a voice similar to his own, a shift he said had significantly expanded the podcast's reach.\n\n\"This month, 28% of my audience is Spanish,\" he said, adding that Spanish speakers now have access to interviews with some of the world's most high-profile podcast guests, citing his own interview with former first lady Michelle Obama as an example.\n\nOther guests on the podcast include former vice President Kamala Harris, Simon Cowell, and the psychologist Jordan Peterson.\n\nSpotify said in its \"2025 Wrapped\" press release in December 2025 that \"The Diary of a CEO with Steven Bartlett\" was the platform's second-most-listened-to podcast globally, behind \"The Joe Rogan Experience.\" On YouTube, Bartlett's podcast channel has 14.5 million subscribers.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump's latest threats to hike tariffs on major European economies are shaking up markets on Tuesday, but a surge in Japanese bonds yields is also weighing on investor sentiment.\n\nJapanese 40-year bond yields surged to 4.2% on Tuesday from 3.94% on Monday — the first time ever they've crossed the 4% mark. Yields started the year at 3.6%. Rates on 30- and 20-year bonds have also spiked.\n\nIn a note to clients on Tuesday, Jeffrey Favuzza, an equities trader at Jefferies, called the Tuesday sell-off a two-standard-deviation move lower. When yields rise, bond prices fall.\n\nWhat's behind the volatility? A potential pause on food taxes.\n\nOn Monday, Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi called a snap parliamentary election set to be held on February 8. Takaichi's goal is to gain more support for her agenda — which includes a proposed 2-year break from the 8% tax on food products — in the new parliament.\n\nThe news has been too much for investors to swallow. Japan's government debt levels have already been a concern for markets, and investors fear such a tax holiday would exacerbate an already shaky fiscal situation.\n\nAs of 10:30 am ET, the S&P 500 was down 1.16%, while the Nikkei 225 had fallen 1.11%. Meanwhile, gold, which investors have increasingly seen as a hedge to the threat of global fiat currency debasement, was up 3.3%. The Japanese bond turmoil was part of a one-two punch battering markets, along with Donald Trump's increasingly aggressive rhetoric on Greenland.\n\n\"These moves highlight the extent to which investors are souring on this snap election that is promising a food sales tax holiday, which will only make a bad fiscal situation worse,\" David Rosenberg, the founder of Rosenberg Research, said in a note on Tuesday. \"Since Takaichi took office in October, longer-term interest rates have jumped +80 basis points, with obvious spillover effects across the globe.\"\n\nRising Japanese bond yields have an impact on broader markets because of the country's outsize influence on global capital flows. Both domestic and foreign investors have used low yields to lever up positions in higher-yielding assets like US Treasurys and stocks.\n\nWith yields surging, Japanese investors could pivot away from US bond markets and simply buy domestic government debt. It also revives fears of an unwind of the \"carry trade.\" Concerns about the carry trade have been on display in recent years, as investors fear an unwind of levered positions amid rising Japanese yields.\n\nYields on 30-year US Treasurys rose to 4.9% on Tuesday from 4.84% on Monday. Generally, higher long-term government bond yields tend to hurt equity performance as investors can get attractive returns on risk-free assets.\n\nHow things develop in Japan in the days ahead should be top of mind for investors, said Jean Boivin, head of the BlackRock Investment Institute, in a note on Tuesday.\n\n\"On a quieter data week, we are looking at what global flash PMIs say about global activity. Otherwise, the focus is on Japan where the expected snap election may pave the way for the ruling Liberal Democratic Party to pursue looser fiscal policy and add more pressure to global long-term bond yields,\" Boivin and his team wrote.\n\nThere are plenty of other things happening this week for investors to keep an eye on, too.\n\nFor one, Trump is speaking in Davos on Wednesday, perhaps offering another update to his approach to acquiring Greenland from Denmark. Trump may also join G7 leaders for dinner in Paris on Thursday, per an invite from French President Emmanuel Macron. Michigan Consumer Sentiment data is also out on Friday, which could provide a window into whether renewed tariff uncertainty is weighing on Americans' economic outlook.",

I'm not sure that's true of all human immigrants, but it will definitely be true of the AI immigrants,\" he said.\n\nHarari asked the audience whether they want to allow AIs to be recognized as \"legal persons\" with rights in their countries, giving them the ability to start businesses, form and preach their own religions, or befriend their children on social media.\n\n\"If you want to influence where humanity is going, you need to make a decision now,\" he said.\n\nHarari is a distinguished research fellow at the University of Cambridge's Centre for the Study of Existential Risk, and a history professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Alongside \"Sapiens,\" his book tracing human history across the centuries, he also released \"Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow\" in 2015, where he discussed the existential threat AI poses to humanity.\n\nHarari is not the first person to refer to \"AI immigrants.\" Earlier this month, the Nvidia CEO, Jensen Huang, referred to robots using the term, and said \"AI immigrants\" will help humans with work we no longer want to do, such as manufacturing jobs, AFP reported.",

    "description": "Europe’s struggle to produce globally dominant companies is not a mystery—it is the predictable result of a weak and fragmented venture capital ecosystem. Despite an economy comparable in size to that of the United States, Europe invests only a fraction as much in venture-backed firms, and the gap is widening as capital concentrates around AI and other winner-take-all technologies. The consequences are visible in lower innovation, weaker returns for investors, and a steady outflow of entrepreneurial talent. But Europe’s venture deficit is not inevitable. While structural disadvantages exist, policy choices and investor behavior play a decisive role.",

    "fullText": "Trial involving 4,000 children will explore impact on mental health, sleep and time spent with friends and family\n\nA pioneering investigation into the impact of restricting social media access for children in the UK has been announced as politicians around the world consider action on the issue.\n\nIn December, Australia became the first country to ban under-16s from social media, with governments in other countries, including the, coming under pressure to do the same.\n\nHowever, while experts say there is evidence that aspects of social media are harmful to most children, there has been no large-scale experimental study exploring the effect of limiting time spent on social media in healthy children as a population.\n\n“This study is a world first to try to look at that question,” said Prof Amy Orben, of the University of Cambridge, who is co-lead of the study.\n\nOrben and colleagues plan to study about 4,000 children across 30 secondary schools in Bradford, West Yorkshire, focusing on students in years 8, 9 and 10.\n\nAll participants would be asked to complete an initial questionnaire on areas including their mental health, sleep and friendships, and to download the research app on their main device.\n\nEach year group in each school would be randomly assigned to one of two conditions: the app would simply record the pupils’ social media use, or it would curtail their social media use by limiting access to the apps for TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, X, LinkedIn, Reddit, YouTube and Snapchat to one hour a day, as well as imposing a curfew from 9pm to 7am.\n\nCrucially, the team said, all pupils within a particular year group in a school would experience the same intervention.\n\n“We know that if we take away social media for one adolescent, that might have a very different impact than if we take it away for their whole friendship group for a certain period of time,” Orben said.\n\nAccess to messaging apps including WhatsApp would not be restricted, the team said, as they were important for family communication.\n\nAfter six weeks students would complete another questionnaire. After an initial pilot period beginning in April, the team planned to start the study itself in October, with the first results expected in summer 2027.\n\nMembers of the House of Lords are preparing to vote on an amendment brought by John Nash to the children’s wellbeing and schools bill which would introduce an outright ban on children using social media.\n\nThe amendment has the support of some Labour peers, and if it passes in the Lords it will then be debated in the Commons, where 61 Labour MPs recently wrote a letter to the prime minister urging him to bring in a ban.\n\nLiz Kendall, the technology secretary, reassured MPs on Tuesday that the government’s consultation on the issue would only take a few months and that it would have a firm position by the summer.\n\nHowever, Nash insisted he would press ahead with his attempt to legislate immediately for a ban, saying on Tuesday: “The time for delay and procrastination is over. Without swift action to raise the age limit for social media to 16, we are at risk of a societal catastrophe.\n\n“That is why I am urging all fellow peers to vote for my amendment, which has the backing of peers from every major party, to end the disastrous harm being done to our young people by social media and to give them their childhood back.”\n\nWhile the researchers have noted that the study, called the IRL trial, has limitations – for example students may use devices that belong to other people or may choose not to participate – they said they hoped the results would shed light on the effect of restricting teens’ social media use.\n\n“The participants’ levels of anxiety is our key outcome, and we’re also interested in depression,” said Dr Dan Lewer, who leads the Bradford Centre for Health Data Science and is co-lead of the study. The researchers would also explore the impact by looking at which apps were used and when, as well as participants’ sleep patterns, experiences of bullying, time spent with friends and family, and how they compared themselves to other young people, he said.\n\nThe trial was independent from the UK government’s announcement of a consultation on whether to ban under-16s from social media, Orben said, adding that the results may be valuable for other countries debating the issue.\n\n“The decision that policymakers need to make is up to them,” she said. “We’re really just delivering the best quality evidence we can in the timeframes that are available.”",

    "fullText": "Fulham are battling Wolfsburg and Real Betis in the race to sign Troy Parrott following his huge impact in the Republic of Ireland’s quest to qualify for the World Cup 2026.\n\nSo far, the trio are the clubs that have gone in strongest in what is expected to be a wide race for the AZ Alkmaar forward over the next few months.\n\nThe 23-year-old's profile exploded after the five goals against Portugal and Hungary that sent Heimir Hallgrimsson’s side into a World Cup play-off.\n\nBut that was only on the back of burgeoning development that had made a series of clubs around the Premier League and European football take note of his impact in the Netherlands.\n\nWolfsburg have talked about a €20m (£17.4m) deal, but it is understood that AZ would want even more. Fulham have so far shown the strongest interest from the Premier League.\n\nHaving energised his career at AZ, though, Parrott is understood to want to be very considerate about his next steps. While the forward does want to return to the Premier League at some point - he initially came through the Tottenham Hotspur system - any English move would have to fully make sense for both his current position and future prospects, which is why he is happy to stay in Europe.\n\nThe Bundesliga is an appealing option, particularly with the way the competition has proven so successful in developing young talent.\n\nAway from his prolific run for his country, Parrott has hit nine goals in 13 Eredivisie games, with 10 more goals this term in Conference League qualifiers and the KNVB Cup.\n\nParrott is tied fourth in the Eredivisie top scorer standings, with Ayase Ueda clear with 18 goals in as many games for Feyenoord.",

    "description": "A real-world comparison of GPT-5.2-Codex (high), Claude Opus 4.5, and Gemini 3 Pro on two coding tasks, focusing on quality, speed, and cost.",
    "fullText": "If you want a quick take: Claude Opus 4.5 was the most consistent, GPT-5.2-codex (high) delivered strong code with slower turnaround, and Gemini 3 Pro was the most efficient but less polished.\n\nIf you want a quick take, here’s how the three models performed in our tests:\n\n💡 If you want the safest pick for real “ship a feature in a big repo” work, Opus 4.5 felt the most reliable in my runs. If you care about speed and cost and you’re okay polishing UI yourself, Gemini 3 Pro is a solid bet.\n\nOkay, so right now the WebDev leaderboard on LMArena is basically owned by the big three: Claude Opus 4.5 from Anthropic, GPT-5.2-codex (high) from OpenAI, and finally everybody's favorite, Gemini 3 Pro from Google.\n\nSo, I grabbed these three and put them into the same existing project (over 8K stars and 50K+ LOC) and asked them to build a couple of real features like a normal dev would.\n\nSame repo. Same prompts. Same constraints.\n\nFor each task, I took the best result out of three runs per model to keep things fair.\n\nThen I compared what they actually did: code quality, how much hand-holding they needed, and whether the feature even worked in the end.\n\n⚠️ NOTE: Don't take the result of this test as a hard rule. This is just a small set of real-world coding tasks that shows how each model did for me in that exact setup and gives you an overview of the difference in the top 3 models' performance in the same tasks.\n\nFor the test, we will use the following CLI coding agents:\n\nHere’s the repo used for the entire test: iib0011/omni-tools\n\nWe will check the models on two different tasks:\n\nEach model is asked to create a global action menu that opens with a keyboard shortcut. This feature expands on the current search by adding actions, global state, and keyboard navigation. This task checks how well the model understands current UX patterns and avoids repetition without breaking what's already in place.\n\nEach model had to add real usage tracking across the app, persist it locally, and then build an analytics dashboard that shows things like the most used tools, recent activity, and basic filters.\n\nWe’ll compare code quality, token usage, cost, and time to complete the build.\n\n💡 NOTE: I will share the source code changes for each task by each model in a .patch file. This way, you can easily view them on your local system by cloning the repository and applying the patch file using git apply <path_file_name>. This method makes sharing changes easier.\n\nThe task is simple: all models start from the same base commit and then follow the same prompt to build what is asked in the prompt.\n\nAnd obviously, as mentioned, I will evaluate the response from the model from the \"Best of 3.\"\n\nLet's start off the test with something interesting:\n\nGPT-5.2 handled this surprisingly well. The implementation was solid end to end, and it basically one-shotted the entire feature set, including i18n support, without needing multiple correction passes.\n\nThat said, it did take a bit longer than some other models (~20 minutes), which is expected since reasoning was explicitly set to high. The model spends more time thinking through architecture, naming, and edge cases rather than rushing to output code. The trade-off felt worth it here.\n\nThe token usage was noticeably higher due to the reasoning set to high, but the output code reflected that.\n\nYou can find the code it generated here: GPT-5.2 High Code\n\n💡 NOTE: I ran the exact same prompt with the same model using the default (medium) reasoning level. The difference was honestly massive. With reasoning set to high, the quality of the code, structure, and pretty much everything jumps by miles. It’s not even a fair comparison.\n\nClaude went all in and prepared a ton of different strategies. At the start, it did run into build issues, but it kept running the build until it was able to fix all the build and lint issues.\n\nThe entire run took me about 7 minutes 50 seconds, which is the fastest among the models for this test. The features all worked as asked, and obviously, the UI looked super nice and exactly how I expected.\n\nYou can find the code it generated here: Claude Opus 4.5 Code\n\nTo be honest, this exceeded my expectations; even the i18n texts are added and displayed in the UI just as expected. Absolute cinema!\n\nGemini 3 got it working, but it's clearly not on the same level as GPT-5.2 High or Claude Opus 4.5. The UI it built is fine and totally usable, but it feels a bit barebones, and you don't get many choices in the palette compared to the other two.\n\nOne clear miss is that language switching does not show up inside the action palette at all, which makes the i18n support feel incomplete even though translations technically exist.\n\nYou can find the code it generated here: Gemini 3 Pro Code\n\nOverall, Gemini 3 lands in a very clear third place here. It works, the UI looks fine, and nothing is completely broken, but compared to the depth, completeness, and polish of GPT-5.2 High and Claude Opus 4.5, it feels behind.\n\nThis test is a step up from the action palette.\n\nYou can find the prompt I've used here: Prompt\n\nGPT-5.2 absolutely nailed this one.\n\nThe final result turned out amazing. Tool usage tracking works exactly as expected, data persists correctly, and the dashboard feels like a real product feature. Most used tools, recent usage, filters, everything just works.\n\nOne really nice touch is that it also wired analytics-related actions into the Action Palette from Test 1.\n\nIt did take a bit longer than the first test, around 26 minutes, but again, that’s the trade-off with high reasoning. You can tell the model spent time thinking through data modeling, reuse, and avoiding duplicated logic. Totally worth it here.\n\nYou can find the code it generated here: GPT-5.2 High Code\n\nGPT-5.2 High continues to be slow but extremely powerful, and for a task like this, that’s a very good trade.\n\nClaude Opus 4.5 did great here as well.\n\nThe final implementation works end to end, and honestly, from a pure UI and feature standpoint, it’s hard to tell the difference between this and GPT-5.2 High. The dashboard looks clean, the data makes sense, and the filters work as expected.\n\nYou can find the code it generated here: Claude Opus 4.5 Code\n\nGemini 3 Pro gets the job done, but it clearly takes a more minimal approach compared to GPT-5.2 High and Claude Opus 4.5.\n\nThat said, the overall experience feels very bare minimum. The UI is functional but plain, and the dashboard lacks the polish and depth you get from the other two models.\n\nAlso, it didn't quite add the button to view the analytics right in the action palette, similar to the other two models.\n\nYou can find the code it generated here: Gemini 3 Pro Code\n\nOverall, Gemini 3 Pro remains efficient and reliable, but in a comparison like this, efficiency alone is not enough. 🤷‍♂️\n\nAt least from this test, I can conclude that the models are now pretty much able to one-shot a decent complex work, at least from what I tested.\n\nStill, there have been times when the models mess up so badly that if I were to go ahead and fix the problems one by one, it would take me nearly the same time as building it from scratch.\n\nIf I compare the results across models, Opus 4.5 definitely takes the crown. But I still don’t think we’re anywhere close to relying on it for real, big production projects. The recent improvements are honestly insane, but the results still don’t fully back them up. 🥴\n\nFor now, I think these models are great for refactoring, planning, and helping you move faster. But if you solely rely on their generated code, the codebase just won’t hold up long term.\n\nI don't see any of these recent models as “use it and ship it” for \"production,\" in a project with millions of lines of code, at least not in the way people hype it up.\n\nLet me know your thoughts in the comments.\n\nSoftware and DevOps engineer with 4+ years of experience building for the web and cloud, mainly with TypeScript, Python, Go, Docker, and Kubernetes.

    "description": "In developing EnergyNet we have leveraged and are extending lessons from telecom's shift from a centralized, circuit-switched phone system to decentralized, packet-switched data networks. EnergyNet utilizes 1) an Energy Router that enforces galvanic separation and utilizes software-controlled energy flows over a DC backplane, 2) Energy Local and Wide Area Networks (ELAN/EWAN) based on DC microgrids that interconnect through an open Energy Protocol (EP), and 3) a control plane comprised of the Energy Router Operating System (EROS) and EP Server which is managed at operator scale through an Energy Network Management System (ENMS). We distinguish the architectural contribution (Tier-1 including components, interfaces, and operating model) from expected outcomes contingent on adoption (Tier-2). The latter includes local-first autonomy with global interoperability, near-real-time operation with local buffering, removal of EV-charging bottlenecks, freed grid capacity for data centers and industrial electrification, as well as a trend toward low, predictable, fixed-cost clean energy. Evidence from early municipal demonstrators illustrates feasibility and migration paths.",

    "description": "Patrick Reed stands by the sentiment that he wants to be a worldwide player. It's why he would consider a return to the PGA Tour if given the chance.",
    "fullText": "Patrick Reed stands by the sentiment that he wants to be a worldwide player. It's something he has not only said but followed up on throughout his career.\n\nThe 2018 Masters champion opened his 2026 campaign last week at the Dubai Invitational on the DP World Tour and will compete in this week's Dubai Desert Classic. Next month, he'll kick off his fifth season competing for LIV Golf, where he has one win in 45 career starts. Late last year, he also made starts on the Asian Tour.\n\nOver the weekend, Reed was asked about a possible return to the PGA Tour. He's not eligible for the Returning Member Program, which only four players fit the criteria for, but that doesn't mean he hasn't thought about going back.\n\n\"I mean, of course; if it were up to me, I'd play everywhere,\" Reed told Golf Digest's Evin Priest. Then he continued: \"I'm already playing on three tours, why not add one more? I always enjoyed my time out there on the PGA Tour.\n\n\"Let's be honest, out there, it's the best tour in the world. Look at what they've done in golf … I could see myself playing there at some point again. But right now, you just never know; everything's so fluid.”\n\nReed joking about competing on four tours is somewhat ironic, considering the Texan's reason for leaving the PGA Tour in the first place was centered around wanting to spend more time at home with his family. “It wears on you as an athlete, wears on you as a person, as a father, and this is for me, I feel like this is the best decision ever,\" Reed said in 2022. \"Now I can compete at the highest level, but also prepare and get ready for every single event and be able to be home, and even though I'll be grinding at home getting ready, I'll be able to spend time with the kids.\"\n\nBut his praise for the PGA Tour is not too surprising. He has maintained, even since leaving, he wants to play all around the world, including back on the PGA Tour eventually.\n\n\"Right now, it's not even a decision,” Reed said. \"That was for ’22 and on winners. So, I definitely would have to think about it … if that number (came) down to 2018. Right now, it's hard to say really what we're going to do or anything like that.\"\n\nLast year, Reed tied for third at the Masters. He's a nine-time winner on the PGA Tour and has lifetime membership on the DP World Tour, which he received in 2019.\n\n\"Right now, the biggest thing is trying to play some good golf these (two) weeks, not only to solidify myself out here on DP, but to have a good momentum going into the year.”\n\nFor every LIV Golf event he competes in that is the same week as a DP World Tour event, Reed must pay fines for competing in a conflicting event. The amount of each fine is unknown, but Reed said having to pay those won't stop him.\n\n“Me traveling and playing around the world ... it helps this tour, but also it's something I've always held true to my heart and wanted to do,\" Reed saod. \"So, if that's what it takes, that's what it takes.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on Golfweek: Patrick Reed calls PGA Tour 'the best tour in the world' in Dubai",

    "fullText": "Fans from around the globe cast their ballots, picking who should start in the NBA All-Star Game next month in Los Angeles. Those fan votes (50% of the total) — combined with votes from NBA players (25%) and select media (25%) — have chosen the 10 All-Star Game starters. There are five starters from the Eastern Conference and five from the West (even though those players will later be divided into two USA and one World team for the new format, more on that below).\n\nThose All-Star Game starters will be unveiled today on NBC, read by the NBA Showtime crew live on set at 2 p.m. Eastern. This will be right before the tip-off of the Oklahoma City at Cleveland game, part of a quadruple header of Martin Luther King Day games on NBC and Peacock.\n\nRefresh this page, where we will have all the details on who the starters will be, as well as analysis of those selections.\n\nNow that the fans have had their say, it falls to the coaches around the league.\n\nNBA coaches will vote to choose the seven reserve (or bench) players from each conference. The results of the vote and the names of the remaining NBA All-Stars will be announced next week on NBC.\n\nThose starters and reserves will then be divided up into three teams as part of a new USA vs. World All-Star Game format. Two international players, Luka Doncic in the West and Giannis Antetokounmpo in the East, were the top vote-getters among fans.\n\nWhile the idea of a USA vs. international players All-Star Game format has been talked about for years, 2026 felt like the right time.\n\nThat's because the NBA All-Star Game returns to NBC and debuts on Peacock in the middle of the Milan Cortina Winter Olympics. That was a perfect setup for the first-of-its-kind All-Star Game format.\n\nThe 24 All-Star players will be divided into three teams — two USA teams and one world team — that will compete in a round-robin tournament of four 12-minute games. Each of the three teams will have a minimum of eight players (if the USA or World teams are short on players, the league office will select one or more players to reach the required number).\n\nAt the end of the round-robin, the two top teams will play a championship game (the fourth 12-minute game of the day) for the title.\n\nAll-Star weekend tips off on Feb. 13 with the Rising Stars at the Intuit Dome at 6 p.m. PT, featuring the league's top first- and second-year players. Also on the 13th is the NBA All-Star Celebrity Game, featuring stars from media, sports and entertainment at the Kia Forum. The Forum also hosts the fifth annual NBA HBCU Classic at 8 p.m. that night.\n\nOn Saturday, Feb. 14, All-Star Saturday night — featuring the Skills Challenge, 3-point Contest and the Dunk Contest — will take place at the Intuit Dome.\n\nThe 75th NBA All-Star Game will take place on Sunday, Feb. 15, at 5 p.m. Eastern, earlier than in previous years, leading into more coverage of the Milan Cortina Winter Olympics.\n\nPeacock NBA Monday will stream up to three Monday night games each week throughout the regular season. Coast 2 Coast Tuesday presents doubleheaders on Tuesday nights throughout the regular season on NBC and Peacock. On most Tuesdays, an 8 p.m. ET game will be on NBC stations in the Eastern and Central time zones, and an 8 p.m. PT game on NBC stations in the Pacific and often Mountain time zones. Check local listings each week. Both games will stream live nationwide on Peacock. NBC Sports will launch Sunday Night Basketball across NBC and Peacock on Feb. 1, 2026.

As in years' past, five players from each conference receive the starter label, even though 15 players will actually start as part of the league's three-team format.\n\nIf the early voting returns were any indication, fans expect the World team to have an advantage over the two USA teams on All-Star Weekend.

Instead, he offered a blistering virtual address that largely attacked the rest of the world.\n\nThis time, he's coming with a big contingent, and it's the talk of the town. He's already said a focus of his speech will largely be affordability, interestingly choosing a US-specific issue on the global stage. (It is America First, after all.)\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom is also coming to town. He plans to argue that Trump's economic agenda has been a failure. It's another example of the ever-evolving future of capitalism, a topic we've been closely covering this year.\n\nTariffs: Tariffs have been a staple of Trump's second term, and they don't appear to be going anywhere. Their impact is also felt worldwide, making them a perfect fit for the global Davos crowd.\n\nTheir latest iteration is a threat Trump is wielding against countries that oppose his plan to take over Greenland. Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said controlling Greenland is actually about Trump trying to avoid conflict.\n\nAI: You didn't think you'd get through this without an AI mention, did you? Last year, the word of the conference was \"agentic AI.\" This year it feels like three letters will be top of mind: ROI. The bets have been placed, and they are big, but what is AI doing for companies?\n\nAlso expect some chatter about how the tech is affecting workforce headcounts.",
