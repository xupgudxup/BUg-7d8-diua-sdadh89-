    "fullText": "A photo of Stephen Hawking with two women in bikinis has emerged in a new batch of Epstein files\n\nA family spokesperson said the two women were the late physicist 's caretakers and that the photo was taken at a science symposium in 2006\n\nRepresentatives for Hawking’s family did not immediately respond to PEOPLE’s request for comment\n\nA photo of Stephen Hawking with two women in bikinis has emerged in a new batch of Epstein files that were released by the U.S. Department of Justice.\n\nThe photo of the late British physicist began making headlines after it was released with other files related to the Epstein investigation, and a family spokesperson told U.K. newspaper The Times that the two women were Hawking’s longtime carers.\n\nHis family went on to tell the outlet that the photo was taken at a science symposium at The Ritz-Carlton in St. Thomas in 2006, where Hawking — who had amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and died in 2018 — presented a speech on quantum cosmology.\n\nLater that same year, Epstein was charged with soliciting prostitution and an FBI investigation began, the Associated Press reported. The convicted sex offender died in a New York City jail in August 2019.\n\nRepresentatives for Hawking’s family did not immediately respond to PEOPLE’s request for comment.\n\nThe professional conference in 2006 was funded by Epstein, according to The Times.\n\nWhile the notable group met to discuss the main topic, “Confronting Gravity,” they could also relax on the beach and take a trip to Epstein’s “nearby private island retreat,” according to an online post from the Edge Foundation, which has ties to the disgraced financier.\n\nThe event wasn’t the only time that Hawking has come up in the Epstein files. One photo, which surfaced in 2015, pictured the physicist with other diners on a patio, while another showed Hawking participating in a submarine tour of the seabed of Little Saint James, one of Epstein's private islands, according to The Times.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nHawking was also referenced in a previously-released email from Epstein to accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell, when the disgraced financier mentioned offering a reward to disprove an unsubstantiated allegation that Hawking had engaged in “an underage orgy\" in the Virgin Islands, where Epstein had a home.\n\nThe email was released as a result of a lawsuit filed by Virginia Giuffre — who accused Epstein and the former Prince Andrew of sexual abuse and died of suicide last year—against Maxwell. The case was settled out of court and Andrew has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.\n\nHawking is referenced around 250 times in the Epstein files, according to files reviewed by PEOPLE, though he has not been accused of a crime related to Epstein and being mentioned in the files is not an indication of wrongdoing.",

    "fullText": "We explore the strange food-obsessed world of a new game whose tech was once called ‘an insult to life itself’ by Hayao Miyazaki, the film-maker behind Spirited Away\n\nA strange piece of software has recently landed on the PC gaming store Steam. And “software” feels like the cleanest way to describe it. Existing somewhere between a full-blown life sim, a science project and a kind of haunted fish tank, Anlife: Motion-learning Life Evolution probably would have disappeared without making much impact if it wasn’t for one unusual factor. Several years ago some of its creators were absolutely roasted on camera by one of the genuine legends of Japanese animation.\n\nBack in 2016, Hayao Miyazaki, the director of movies such as Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away, was shown new technology that used AI in order to animate models. Faced with a zombie that utilised its head to move by knocking its skull against the ground and wriggling its body like a fish, Miyazaki declared what he had seen was “an insult to life itself”. It’s hard not to watch the clip without feeling slightly seared – but now, a decade later, the ashen-faced developers from that room have sufficiently recovered to make their work widely available.\n\nJudging by the chatter surrounding the launch, at least some of the people downloading Anlife are doing so in the hope that it might provide some kind of indication of the current state video games’ relationship with AI. Putting aside the often broad use of that term, this is certainly a thing that’s worth trying to understand, whether it’s because of the job losses caused by AI or blamed on AI, or the sheer number of games made with the assistance of AI models now landing on storefronts such as Steam.\n\nThere’s a problem here, though. And it’s that Anlife itself is such a cheerfully inconsequential thing that it’s hard to read too much of anything into it.\n\nAnlife promises players an evolution simulator where “AI-driven block creatures move in unexpected ways.” What this comes down to for the most part involves placing a range of different creatures into a small environment and then watching as they learn to get around.\n\nVisually Anlife is pure Frutiger Aero, offering landscapes of green valleys and sparkling water that could be the kind of soothing images MRI technicians sometimes encourage you to look at during a lengthy scan. Sonically it’s equally inoffensive: with a range of bloops, bleeps and popping sounds, we’re pitched right into the soundtrack of a million 00s day spas.\n\nThis desire to soothe permeates to the level of mechanics, too. Over the course of an idle morning with Anlife you can place a range of simple creatures in the environment and then give them food that will encourage them to breed or mutate. You can expand your territory and then lure creatures towards water or up into the air in order to create more variations. There are plenty of things to unlock (including a shadow tech tree that has you covered if you want to annihilate your digital sea monkeys rather than watching them flourish) but the ecosystem is kept simple. It’s a game about watching how things decide to crawl towards food.\n\nThe thrill of all of this presumably comes down to the “how” in that last sentence. This is where the game’s slightly mysterious use of AI is probably involved. And it’s true that, after a few hours of play, you’ll have Anlife’s funny little blob creatures exploring new kinds of joints and body arrangements as they swim and fly and generally roll around eating.\n\n(AI has a history of being used to make creatures walk around, incidentally, often using small neural networks and computer evolution. In 2009, the UK-based games technology company NaturalMotion developed a project in which a bipedal model learned to walk using evolved neural networks. The company was subsequently bought by Zynga in 2014.\n\nThere are two problems, however, the first being that the focus on unlocking the skill tree gives the opening hours of Anlife the feel of a rather mindless clicker game that it struggles to shake off. The second comes down to something that I gather people studying procedural generation sometimes refer to as “the oatmeal problem”.\n\nThe oatmeal problem, which was first formulated by writer, developer and academic Kate Compton, hinges on the fact that every single bowl of oatmeal in the universe is unique. Just not in a very interesting way. Similarly, when Anlife’s creatures discover a new way of rolling or bouncing or flapping their bodies towards food, they’re still just moving towards food. It makes for a game that’s either about really, really paying attention to tiny variations in detailing, or about completely zoning out and just enjoying the floaty aesthetic. Over the course of my time with Anlife, I’ve generally started with the first approach and then discovered, after 10 minutes, that I’ve slid into the second.\n\nThe more I played Anlife, the more I ended up thinking about something I heard from one of the first AI researchers I ever spoke to, all the way back in 2013. The real value of AI, they explained – and I am paraphrasing here – is that it could one day become a completely alien form of intelligence. Which means that us humans would have the lens of a different kind of mind through which to see ourselves and our quirks and cognitive fallacies – things that can be hard to spot when you’re talking to people who think in a very similar way to you.\n\nSince then the apparent focus for a lot of companies such as OpenAI seems to be completely the opposite: creating mimetic plagiarism machines that sometimes seem to exist only to tell people what they already want to hear.\n\nIt feels as if Anlife is filling a very small and specific niche. It isn’t trying to disguise its AI use, as far as I am aware. It’s actually trying to draw attention to the way it uses AI to allow its little creatures to move around. It’s not just a game born of AI, in other words. It’s a game that in some small way is actually about AI. It wants to be slightly alien. It doesn’t want to hide itself or ingratiate; it wants to examine AI’s innate capacity for otherness.",

    "title": "Revenge of the English majors: The age of AI is driving new respect for humanities skills",
    "description": "For years, English majors were mocked as useless. Now, AI is giving them some momentum in the job market, while computer science grads get disrupted.",
    "fullText": "At the University of Colorado Boulder, you can take a course co-taught by an applied mathematician and a Renaissance scholar.\n\n\"The students love it,\" said John-Michael Rivera, the school's dean of arts and humanities, of the class, which is called Inclusive Interdisciplinary Data Science for All.\n\nThe class gives STEM students a way to think about the ethics of AI, he said. In other courses, humanities majors can use their skills to evaluate how AI writes, what it means for the practice of writing, and what the \"self\" means in an AI world.\n\nRivera credits the creation of courses focusing on the intersection of AI and humanities with a resurgence in student interest in liberal arts degrees like English. Pre-pandemic, the number of English majors at the university was shrinking, part of a broader decline in English across the country, he said. It was a far cry from the days of over 1,500 majors and long waitlists in the early 2000s, according to Rivera. But there's been a rebound, with the number of English majors rising 9% since 2021.\n\nRivera said students \"want to know more about the 'why' these days. And that's what we do in humanities. We really engage in the 'why.'\"\n\nDerided by some as useless, the utility of the English major has long been questioned. Who needs to write essays (or articles) any\n\n\"We are certainly seeing organizations look more towards the soft skills, the accountability of a job, the identity of the person, their style, their empathy — their humanity,\" in a world that requires both humans and technology, said Bryan Ackermann, head of AI strategy and transformation at recruiting and organizational consulting firm Korn Ferry.\n\nFor the English majors, that's all offered some degree of vindication. As the conversation heats up over which skills will be useful in an AI world, one camp argues it's time for ideas, people, and critical thinkers to flourish. That means that, after years of mocking, English majors are finally getting recognized for their usefulness. Some schools are seeing enrollment in the major rise after years of decline; technical recruiters and experts are seeing greater demand for humanities skills. Call it the makeover of the English major.\n\nJessie Hennen directs the creative writing and literature programs at Southwest Minnesota State University, a large public school with a returning and transfer student population.\n\n\"They've had jobs, they have experience, and they're just like, we are not letting AI take creative writing away from us,\" Hennen said. \"And I think that has to do with the fact that creative writing is — it's a business, but it's also an art, and arts are imperfect; we do them for human reasons that are not just to make money.\"\n\nShe said that their program has been growing over the last two to three years.\n\n\"I would say we're starting to see trends that look really promising for students starting to ask, 'Can the humanities sustain me at a time when everything is moving so quickly?'\" Rivera, the dean at the University of Colorado Boulder, said. Those students \"really want to reflect what it means to be part of a technological world.\"\n\nThat's also the case at Rice University in Houston, where enrollment in English classes has grown steadily over the last few years and the number of faculty within Creative Writing has nearly doubled, according to Kathleen Canning, the dean of humanities and arts.\n\nOne example of an assignment is an English professor who will issue an essay prompt and ask students to compare their own version to one they get from an LLM, and analyze the difference between the two. The aim is to examine what it means to be an interpreter of a prompt — and the power of their own words.\n\n\"Students are trying to ascertain how to develop and advance their own capacities while AI appears to do so much for them in these times,\" Canning said. \"The humanities and arts offer them opportunities not only to probe the limits of AI, to grapple with it as an increasingly powerful reality, but to do so critically by advancing their capacities for self-reflection, interpretation, and revision.\"\n\nDespite these examples, schools across the country are paring back on their humanities offerings or cutting programs completely, and the nationwide number of humanities bachelor's degrees being conferred has fallen from 2010s highs in recent years.\n\nStill, students pursue English out of passion, said Kevin Caffrey, a senior associate registrar at the University of Mary Washington in Virginia. His research found that English majors who participated in his survey \"illustrated that even with a strong overall awareness of criticisms of the major, they were determined to enroll in the program because it aligned with their interests, personal ideals, and goals for the future.\"\n\n\"What do you need more in a company than someone who knows how to communicate with people at all different levels from all different backgrounds and walks of life? The English majors are primed to do that,\" Caffrey said.\n\nThey're learning to do it as communication changes rapidly. When 23-year-old Margo D. returned from a semester abroad, she noticed something had shifted on campus.\n\n\"Many of my peers were using ChatGPT for almost every assignment,\" Margo, who graduated from a small liberal arts school in 2025 with a double major in English and Earth and Climate Sciences, said. Margo wasn't sold.\n\n\"I noticed that my English professors were asking a lot out of my writing, asking for a lot of creativity and an original voice and style, and asking me questions that AI couldn't necessarily grasp the nuance of, and I don't really think it even can now,\" Margo said. \"And so I felt really grateful to be an English major.\"\n\nThere are signs of employment hope for the English majors.\n\nDaniela Amodei, the cofounder of Anthropic, studied literature in college. In an ABC News interview, she said \"the things that make us human will become much more important,\" and that when her AI company hires, it looks for candidates who are great communicators.\n\n\"I actually think studying the humanities is going to be more important than ever,\" Amodei said.\n\nSteve Johnson, the editorial director of NotebookLM, previously told Business Insider that there's what he's deemed a \"revenge of the humanities.\" Philosophical thinking is necessary; some AI firms are even actively seeking out liberal arts graduates.\n\nStill, companies aren't falling over themselves to snap up English majors — hiring overall has slowed to one of the lowest rates in over a decade, and the recent grad unemployment rate has been ticking up.\n\nEarly-career humanities and arts graduates had a higher unemployment rate than their peers in other fields, according to an analysis of the Census Bureau's American Community Survey by Georgetown researchers.\n\nJoe Kramer, a 2020 English graduate, hasn't worked directly in a related field since he graduated — he worked in a role that relied on automation, and even helped train AI while searching for post-pandemic work.\n\n\"I think it's just getting really scary out there for a lot of humanities adjacent stuff, because the level of AI that's out there now, it generates pictures, it crawls all kinds of web forums, and it can oversee thousands of pages and documents at a time while only being run by one person,\" Kramer said. \"So even if AI isn't taking your job, they don't need to hire a lot of people anymore.\"\n\nPart of some of the general reticence to hire in hiring right now can also be chalked up to an equal-opportunity dismal labor market. It's not just English majors suffering.\n\nUnder the hood, the prospects for English majors aren't as dreary, according to the Georgetown analysis. The unemployment rate for those specifically in humanities and liberal arts is still well below the post-2008 Great Recession highs, although it's still higher than pre-pandemic levels.\n\nKorn Ferry's Ackermann said that it's still a \"tad early\" to fully declare a revenge of the English major, since it's smaller, more nimble firms looking for those with a good command of language, but he predicts that could expand to bigger employers soon.\n\n\"Ask me again in a couple of months, and we're going to see that go from smaller, nimble organizations into the larger enterprises as the larger enterprises begin to incorporate AI-driven development tools into their processes,\" he said.\n\nGiancarlo Hirsch, a managing director at global tech talent partner Glocomms, said he's seen greater willingness to look at candidates from various backgrounds. Candidates with history backgrounds, for example, are making it further into interview processes than they previously would.\n\n\"People are not explicitly targeting folks from humanities degrees, but they're really willing to speak with them and open to it and finding reasons to say yes throughout an interview process,\" Hirsch said.\n\nDaniella LaGaccia, a 37-year-old copywriter and former English literature major, sees AI as a tool — creatives use all sorts of different tools to complement their work, and AI can be one of them. But, if anything, that makes a greater case for the type of creative thinking and knowledge that humanities majors can bring.\n\n\"Think about it this way: If you have five different companies who are using the same generative tools to develop their marketing copy, they're all going to get generally the same type of thing,\" LaGaccia said. \"If everybody's using the same tools and everybody's inputting the same information, then how are you going to differentiate yourself in the market? That's where creative people come in.\"",

    "title": "Legendary SF Author Harlan Ellison Had Nothing but Harsh Words About Star Wars",
    "description": "Harlan Ellison is one of the most influential voices in science-fiction history, and he was vocally not a fan of Star Wars.",
    "fullText": "We may receive a commission on purchases made from links.\n\nMost stories one reads about the legendary sci-fi author Harlan Ellison tend to be about how cranky and/or litigious he was. Harlan Ellison hated Hollywood. The stories about his dissatisfaction with \"Star Trek\" are legendary, and he often took other writers and/or studios to court, claiming they had ripped off his idea. He once sued the makers of the obscure 1970s sci-fi cop show \"Future Cop,\" and he famously (and successfully) sued James Cameron over \"The Terminator.\" He sued the movie \"In Time\" for \"borrowing\" one of his ideas. And in interviews, Ellison remained cantankerous. A notable 1979 interview with the Comics Journal revealed the man's open hatred for studios' habit of stealing other authors' ideas and claiming them as their own.\n\nIn 1989, Ellison published a book of reviews and essays called \"Harlan Ellison's Watching,\" which compiled 25 years of his ancillary nonfiction writing output. He weighed in on various pop sci-fi films and TV shows, adding his two acidic cents to the otherwise genteel conversation. It was never a secret that Harlan Ellison hated George Lucas' 1977 sci-fi opera \"Star Wars,\" as he would make passing mention of it in ancillary interviews, but in \"Watching,\" he got to lay his opinions bare in an essay entitled \"Luke Skywalker Is A Nerd And Darth Vader Sucks Runny Eggs.\" As one can tell, Ellison was not about to launch into a paean about the glories of Lucas' Skywalker saga. He was about to lay out, in explicit detail, just how much he hated \"Star Wars\" and why.\n\nIn brief, Ellison felt that \"Star Wars\" was shallow and thoughtless, not interested in anything complex or adult. Because it was a mere adventure, it didn't fully exploit the depths of its own genre.\n\nThe Grailrunner website printed some passages from Harlan Ellison's essay, and boy howdy are they harsh. Ellison hated that sci-fi, a genre he associated with imagination, ambition, and philosophy, was being wielded to tell a mere swashbuckling adventure pic. He called \"Star Wars\" \"some half-wit wild west adventure in outer space.\" He said that Hollywood doesn't know the difference between making a sci-fi movie and making any other genre. Sci-fi is \"just another shoot-'em-up with laser rifles.\" He wrote:\n\n\"For all of its length, for all of its astonishing technical expertise, its headlong plunge and its stunning effects, at no time can one discern the passage of a thought. It is all bread and circuses. The human heart is never touched, the lives unexamined, the characters are comic strip stereotypes.\"\n\nAnd he does have a point. The first \"Star Wars,\" taken independently from its many, many sequels, most closely resembles the 1930s sci-fi adventure serials that George Lucas watched as a kid. The characters are quite deliberately archetypal and even a little arch and artificial. The original \"Star Wars\" is using modern special effects and 1970s filmmaking tech to link up contemporary cinema with older, squarer filmic traditions from decades previous. There is no moral nuance or complexity to \"Star Wars.\" It's an adventure novel, a \"heroes and villains\" story. Ellison seemingly felt that devoting all that time and all those cinematic resources to a story about comic book stereotypes was a waste of time.\n\nSci-fi was, as Ellison wrote, a \"what if\" genre that probes the possibilities of broad, high-concept ideas. What if we were all psychic? What if we met aliens? There is, one might agree, no \"what if\" quality to \"Star Wars.\" It's a caper film.\n\nHarlan Ellison was keen to recommend sci-fi movies that he felt did explore the genre in interesting ways. He liked the movie \"Charly.\" He liked \"1984,\" of course. He also recommended L.Q. Jones' 1975 film \"A Boy and His Dog\" ... which is based on one of his own short stories. Ellison was famously not fond of Stanley Kubrick's seminal sci-fi text \"2001: A Space Odyssey,\" as he felt it was too focused on its visuals, and not its humanity. He wrote:\n\n\"[A]ll the films that we thought were great, like '2001,' become, in retrospect, merely exercises in special effects. There are damned few 'people' stories that deal with what science fiction at its best and most valuable handles better than any other kind of story: the effects on human beings of technology, unusual happenings and the future.\"\n\nOne of Ellison's biggest issues with \"Star Wars\" was how uncritical the public seemed to be. He hated that NASA scientists were singing its praises, and that a friend, author Ben Bova, dared to give it a good review. He saw no dissenting voices among the rising tide of what would come to be known as \"the fandom.\" He wrote:\n\n\"I sincerely hope that science and scientists differ from science fiction and its practitioners. Heaven help us if they don't: we may be headed for a very boring world indeed. Strip 'Star Wars' of its often striking images and its highfalutin scientific jargon, and you get a story, characters, and dialogue of overwhelming banality ... trite characters and paltry verbiage ... Still, 'Star Wars' will do very nicely for those lucky enough to be childish or unlucky enough never to have grown up.\"",

    "fullText": "Compilers occupy a special place in computer science. They're a canonical course in computer science education. Building one is a rite of passage. It forces you to confront how software actually works, by examining languages, abstractions, hardware, and the boundary between human intent and machine execution.\n\nCompilers once helped humans speak to machines. Now machines are beginning to help humans build compilers.\n\nI’ve spent a large part of my career working on compilers and programming languages, so when Anthropic announced the Claude C Compiler (CCC), I paid close attention. My basic take is simple: this is real progress, a milestone for the industry. We’re not in the end of times, but this also isn’t just hype, so take a deep breath, everyone.\n\nAI building a C compiler is not truly revolutionary, but it does reveal how far AI coding has progressed and where it may be heading next.\n\nBefore diving in, here are my main take-aways:\n\nThe implications for engineering teams are real and immediate. At the end, I share how I'm translating these insights into concrete expectations for my team at Modular.\n\nTo understand why the Claude C Compiler matters, we must first understand why compilers themselves are such a revealing test of intelligence, whether human or artificial.\n\nA compiler sits at the intersection of multiple difficult domains at once: formal language design, large-scale software architecture, deep performance constraints, and unforgiving correctness requirements.\n\nMost applications can tolerate bugs, compilers cannot. A single incorrect transformation can silently produce wrong programs, disrupting the productivity of countless users. Every layer must maintain strict invariants while cooperating with every other layer.\n\nHistorically, this is why compilers became a rite of passage in computer science education. They force engineers to think across abstraction layers: turning text into structure, structure into meaning, meaning into optimized machine behavior.\n\nThat process mirrors something deeper, which is the process of translating human intent into precise execution, which is why compilers are a uniquely interesting benchmark for AI system integration.\n\nEarlier generations of AI coding tools were impressive at local tasks, such as writing functions, generating scripts, or filling in missing pieces of code. Those tasks test pattern recognition and short-term reasoning.\n\nThe Claude C Compiler is a milestone, showing progress at a different level. It shows an AI system maintaining coherence across an entire engineering system that can coordinate multiple subsystems, preserve architectural structure, iterate toward correctness over time, and operate within a complex feedback loop of tests and failures. AI is beginning to move from code completion toward engineering participation.\n\nHowever, the deeper reason compilers align unusually well with modern AI systems is that compiler engineers build architectures that are highly legible and structured. Compilers have layered abstractions, consistent naming conventions, composable passes, and deterministic feedback (“it works” or “it doesn’t” - there is a clear success criteria). These properties make compilers unusually learnable for both humans and machine learning systems trained on large amounts of source code.\n\nSeen this way, CCC is validation of decades of software engineering practice. The abstractions developed by compiler engineers turned out to be structured enough that machines can now reason within them. That is a remarkable milestone. However, it also hints at an important limitation.\n\nOne of the most interesting aspects of the Claude C Compiler is that Anthropic released the full source history. Unlike many AI demonstrations, this is an engineering artifact that anyone can inspect, not simply a polished result or benchmark score. The entire repository, including commit history, design documents, and future plans, is available. That means we can actually study how the system approached building a compiler. I spent some time doing exactly that.\n\nThe first major commit effectively “one-shots” the basic architecture of the system. From the start, CCC follows a classic compiler structure. Major subsystems all have pretty amazing design docs too, including:\n\nThe design choices throughout the repository consistently reflect well-established compiler practice - things taught in a university class and widely used by existing compilers like LLVM and GCC. The intermediate representation includes concepts that will look immediately familiar to LLVM developers, including instructions like GetElementPtr, basic block “terminators” and Mem2Reg. It appears to have strong knowledge of widely-used compiler design techniques.\n\nLLVM and GCC code are clearly part of the training set - Claude effectively translated large swaths of them into Rust for CCC. The design docs show detailed knowledge of both systems, as well as considered takes on its implementation approach. Some have criticized CCC for learning from this prior art, but I find that ridiculous - I certainly learned from GCC when building Clang!\n\nPushpendre Rastogi wrote a great blog post about CCC and agent scaling laws, showing how iterative agent workflows gradually expanded implementation and test coverage:\n\nTaken together, CCC looks less like an experimental research compiler and more like a competent textbook implementation, the sort of system a strong undergraduate team might build early in a project before years of refinement. That alone is remarkable.\n\nThe most revealing parts of CCC are its mistakes. Several design choices suggest optimization toward passing tests rather than building general abstractions like a human would. A few examples:\n\nThis last issue is the big problem that indicates CCC won’t be able to generalize well beyond its test-suite, which appears to be confirmed by its bug tracker. These flaws are informative rather than surprising, suggesting that current AI systems excel at assembling known techniques and optimizing toward measurable success criteria, while struggling with the open-ended generalization required for production-quality systems.\n\nAnd that observation leads directly to the deeper question: what does this tell us about AI coding itself?\n\nThe most interesting lesson from the Claude C Compiler is not that AI can build a compiler. It’s how it built one. CCC didn’t invent a new architecture or explore an unfamiliar design space. Instead, it reproduced something strikingly close to the accumulated consensus of decades of compiler engineering: structurally correct, familiar, and grounded in well-understood techniques.\n\nModern LLMs are extraordinarily powerful distribution followers. They learn patterns across vast bodies of existing work and generate solutions near the center of that collective experience. When trained on decades of compilers shaped by GCC, LLVM, and academic literature, it is entirely natural that the result reflects that lineage. This phenomenon closely aligns with Richard Sutton’s Bitter Lesson, where scalable methods rediscover broadly successful structures.\n\nAn analogy helps. Training on English literature allows a model to produce Shakespearean prose: not because literature stopped evolving in the 1600s. Instead, it’s because Shakespeare occupies a dense region of the training distribution. Models learn what has been widely written and reinforced. The same dynamic appears here in compiler design (of all things, rawr! 🐉).\n\nCCC shows that AI systems can internalize the textbook knowledge of a field and apply it coherently at scale. AI can now reliably operate within established engineering practice. This is a genuine milestone that removes much of the drudgery of repetition and allows engineers to start closer to the state of the art. But it also highlights an important limitation of this work:\n\nImplementing known abstractions is not the same as inventing new ones. I see nothing novel in this implementation.\n\nHistorically, progress in compilers did not come from assembling standard components quickly. It came from conceptual leaps, e.g. new intermediate representations, new optimization models, new ways of structuring programs and hardware interaction. It came from getting groups of people to work together, which required inspiring and motivating engineers in new ways.\n\nCurrent AI coding systems excel when success criteria are clear and verifiable: compile the program, pass the tests, improve performance. In these environments, iterative refinement works extremely well: red/green TDD works! Innovation is different. When inventing a new abstraction, success is not yet measurable. There is no test suite for an idea that does not exist, and good design is hard to quantify.\n\nAs writing code is becoming easier, designing software becomes more important than ever. As custom software becomes cheaper to create, the real challenge becomes choosing the right problems and managing the resulting complexity. I also see big open questions about who is going to maintain all this software.\n\nThe Claude C Compiler also raises important yet uncomfortable questions about intellectual property. If AI systems trained on decades of publicly available code can reproduce familiar structures, patterns, and even specific implementations, where exactly is the boundary between learning and copying? Some observers have pointed out cases where CCC appears to regenerate artifacts strongly resembling existing implementations, including standard headers and utility code, despite claims of “clean room” development. These examples highlight how current legal frameworks struggle to describe systems that learn statistically from vast prior work rather than explicitly referencing source material.\n\nAt the same time, this situation is not new. Humans learn by studying existing systems, internalizing patterns, and reapplying ideas in new contexts. The difference is scale and automation. AI compresses decades of engineering knowledge into a generative model capable of reproducing solutions instantly. That challenges traditional assumptions about ownership when the underlying ideas are widely shared but specific expressions may still carry licenses.\n\nWe are facing a new era of automated reimplementation of proprietary software, but this doesn’t mean the paradigm is suddenly obsolete. AI lowers the cost of reproducing established designs, which will shift competitive advantage away from isolated codebases and toward execution, ecosystems, and continuous innovation. This will force legal and institutional norms to evolve, similar to when Linux and open source software first gained wide-spread adoption. Just as with those transitions, I am betting that we will see ecosystem gravity from human collaboration replace legacy ecosystems that cannot keep pace with rapidly changing times.\n\nIf AI coding primarily automates implementation, what happens next?\n\nHistory gives us a clear pattern: when the cost of building something drops dramatically, we don’t simply build the same things more cheaply. We build entirely new things.\n\nCompilers themselves are a perfect example. Early programmers wrote assembly by hand, but once compilers became reliable, developers became vastly more ambitious and entire industries emerged because abstraction made complexity manageable. As writing code becomes easier, the likely outcome is not fewer programmers but more software. We will get more experimentation, more specialized tools, and solutions to problems that previously weren’t worth automating.\n\nWhat changes is the economics of engineering work and particularly the large-scale elimination of mechanical tasks like rewrites, migrations, and boilerplate implementation. These activities are necessary but rarely innovative, and AI systems are unusually good at exactly this kind of work. Engineers move from typing implementations toward directing systems: specifying intent, validating outcomes, and shaping architecture.\n\nAs implementation becomes cheaper, the role of engineers shifts upward. The scarce skills become choosing the right abstractions, defining meaningful problems, and designing systems that humans and AI can evolve together. This will increasingly blur the boundary between software engineering and product thinking. The limiting factor is no longer whether software can be built, but deciding what should be built and how to manage the complexity that follows. AI amplifies both good and bad structure, so we can expect to see poorly managed code scale into incomprehensible nightmares.\n\nThat raises the next question: if programming is changing this fundamentally, what happens to software engineers themselves?\n\nEvery major shift in software development has changed what it means to be a programmer. Early engineers managed hardware directly, while later generations learned to trust compilers and higher-level languages. Each transition removed manual work while raising expectations for what engineers could accomplish, and AI coding represents the next step in that progression.\n\nAs implementation grows increasingly automated, the core skill of software engineering shifts away from writing code line-by-line and toward shaping systems. Engineers can focus on deciding what should exist, how components fit together, and how complexity remains understandable over time. Good software depends on judgment, communication, and clear abstraction. AI systems amplify these human qualities, rather than replacing them.\n\nThe most effective engineers will not compete with AI at producing code, but will learn to collaborate with it, by using AI to explore ideas faster, iterate more broadly, and focus human effort on direction and design. These tools are rapidly becoming part of the normal software development stack, much like compilers, version control, or continuous integration before them. Learning to work effectively with AI is quickly becoming a core professional skill. Ignoring AI today would be like refusing to adopt source control twenty years ago.\n\nThe gap between teams successfully embracing AI tooling and those that aren't is already measurable and widening fast. According to CircleCI's 2026 State of Software Delivery Report, the top 5% of engineering teams nearly doubled their output year-over-year, while the bottom half stagnated. The most productive team in 2025 delivered roughly 10x the throughput of 2024's leader.\n\nWhich raises a practical question: how should teams adapt to be successful?\n\nHere's how I'm translating this shift into concrete expectations for Modular.\n\nDevelopments like the Claude C Compiler have changed how I think about engineering work and what I now ask from my team. Fully benefiting from AI tools requires a deliberate leap: habits formed over decades don’t change automatically, and organizations rarely transform just because better tools exist.\n\nAt the same time, we need to be pragmatic. AI systems are powerful but far from perfect. Progress comes from collaboration with AI, not abdication to it. The goal is not to remove humans from the loop, but to move humans into higher-leverage positions inside it.\n\nThat leads to three expectations:\n\nEvery employee, from engineering to G&A and GTM, is expected to actively adopt AI tools to accelerate productivity and decision-making. The world is moving quickly, and we must lean into change.\n\nCrucially, this does not transfer responsibility to the tool. For example, engineers building large-scale production software remain accountable for correctness, design quality, and long-term maintainability. AI expands our capabilities, but it does not outsource judgment. Work produced with AI should be understood, validated, and owned just as deeply as work written by hand. Reputation is still built on outcomes, not prompts.\n\nA large fraction of historical engineering effort has gone into mechanical work: rewriting code, adapting interfaces, migrating systems, and reproducing existing patterns in new environments. AI is rapidly becoming better at these tasks than humans. We should not compete with automation at mechanical work. Instead, engineers should clarify intent with rigor, validate outcomes with tests, and improve their design.\n\nHuman effort should concentrate where creativity and judgment matter most: and all engineers now have management responsibilities. As migration and implementation accelerate, architectural evolution is no longer limited by how fast humans can rewrite software, but by how clearly we can define where systems should go next.\n\nWell-documented systems become dramatically easier to extend and evolve, and poorly structured systems scale into confusion faster than ever. Documentation, clear interfaces, and explicit design intent are now operational leverage, not optional overhead.\n\nAs implementation costs approach zero, the scarce resource shifts from writing code to aligning people. The greatest opportunity lies in building communities of like-minded people that collaborate toward shared goals and ecosystems where developers can move forward together instead of repeatedly rebuilding the past.\n\nFor my team, that means focusing on tools and platforms that help other developers succeed: systems that move existing code forward, unlock modern compute, and enable collaboration between humans and AI. This aligns directly with Modular’s mission to Democratize AI Compute and expand what programmers everywhere can create.\n\nThe Claude C Compiler doesn’t mark the end of software or compiler engineering. If anything, it opens the door wider. The easier implementation gets, the more room there is for genuine innovation.\n\nLower barriers to implementation do not reduce the importance of engineers; instead, they elevate the importance of vision, judgment, and taste. When creation becomes easier, deciding what is worth creating becomes the harder problem. AI accelerates execution, but meaning, direction, and responsibility remain fundamentally human.\n\nWriting code has never been the goal. Building meaningful software is. The future belongs to teams willing to embrace new tools, challenge assumptions, and design systems that help people create together.\n\nThat is the future that has driven Modular’s mission from the start, and the one I believe this new era of AI makes possible.\n\nWant to build the AI future with us?

But as headlines mounted about tech layoffs and AI’s potential to replace entry-level coders, he began to question whether that path would actually lead to a job.\n\nWhen the 20-year-old interviewed for a datacenter technician role that June and never heard back, his doubts deepened. In December, Ramirez decided on what he thought was a safer bet: turning away from computer science entirely. He dropped his planned major to instead apply to nursing school. He comes from a family of nurses, and sees the field as more stable and harder to automate than coding.\n\n“Even though AI might not be at the point where it will overtake all these entry-level jobs now, by the time I graduate, it likely will,” Ramirez said.\n\nRamirez is not alone in reshaping his career out of anxiety over AI. As students like him are reconsidering their majors over concerns that AI may disrupt their employment prospects, more established workers – some with decades of experience – are rethinking their trajectories because they’re encountering AI at work and share the same unease. Some workers are eschewing it entirely; others are embracing it.\n\nIt’s not clear when AI will become advanced enough to replace certain white-collar workers and just how many jobs it will be capable of taking over. But jitters around its potential impact are already pushing people to change course, reshaping the labor market before automation fully arrives.\n\nWhat is clear is why workers are feeling on edge. The World Economic Forum projects that AI could displace 92m roles worldwide by 2030, including many white-collar positions. In the US, employers cited AI as a factor in nearly 55,000 job cuts in 2025, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas, a consulting firm, as job seekers navigate a tougher market.\n\nWhile AI is still just one factor among many that are leading to layoffs, ADP, the largest payroll company in the US, found that professional and business services roles, alongside information services jobs in media, telecom and IT, collectively lost 41,000 jobs in December 2025. In that same month, employment grew in healthcare, education and hospitality, per the firm’s data.\n\nMany of those white-collar roles involve writing, data analysis and coding – tasks generative AI tools can increasingly perform. Hands-on, people-facing work remains less exposed.\n\nJobs that emphasize interpersonal and hands-on skills are increasingly appealing to young people who are wary of automation, according to Dr Jasmine Escalera, a career development expert at Zety, a professional development platform.\n\nShe pointed to research showing that 43% of gen Z workers who are anxious about AI are moving away from entry-level corporate and administrative roles and toward careers that rely on what she calls “human skills”, including creativity, interpersonal connection and hands-on expertise.\n\nIn that same report, 53% of young respondents said they were seriously considering blue-collar or skilled trade work. Escalera said it was a move that workers were making to reduce their exposure to AI and one that the Wall Street Journal, the paper of record of white-collar work, had recently urged its readers to consider.\n\nBut the pivot may come with sacrifices. Many of the white-collar roles that workers worry could be automated – from software development to financial analysis – are paid median salaries well above $75,000 a year, with developers raking in about $133,000, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Blue-collar jobs pay less. Many skilled trades, like electricians and plumbers, receive closer to $60,000 a year. These types of jobs also often require in-person work, physical labor and less predictable schedules – all trade-offs workers may accept in their attempts to future-proof their careers.\n\nFor some job seekers, any mention of AI is a red flag in job listings, so they’re skipping them entirely.\n\nAfter getting laid off last January, Roman Callaghan, 30, spent nine months hunting for his next job. As a medical coder at a medication access firm for four years, Callaghan handled administrative tasks like calling insurance providers and entering medical data. After his employer started rolling out AI across the company to streamline workflows, he wondered whether the move would one day affect his job. When he was laid off two years later, he suspected his fears had come true, though his employer didn’t specifically cite AI as a reason.\n\nWhen he looked for new work, he avoided any roles that mentioned phrases like “integrating AI”, “AI-first” or “developing AI” in job descriptions. Callaghan wanted a new job, but his AI anxiety steered him away from roles that now felt short-term to him. He just didn’t want to risk being laid off again because a future employer would eventually use AI to cull its ranks.\n\nIn the past nine months, he said, he applied to at least 100 jobs across data entry, medical coding, call centers and paralegal work, while deliberately skipping 30 to 40 postings that referenced AI. While he searched, he took odd gigs to make ends meet, first at a local fish store and later at a call center. He stayed there until mid-October, when he landed a data entry job.\n\nAvoiding AI-centric jobs “felt like it narrowed the amount of companies I could work for”, Callaghan said. “Even though my options were limited, sticking to my convictions felt worth it.”\n\n​​Recruiters say that kind of avoidance is becoming more common. Marshall Scabet, the CEO of Precision Sales Recruiting, which helps manufacturers hire sales professionals, said that roughly a quarter of sales candidates he spoke with over the past six months were trying to pivot away from software-as-a-service (SaaS) jobs.\n\nMany clients told him they worried their tech sales roles could be replaced by AI, Scabet said, and believed selling industrial equipment was safer from automation. Doing so, he said, requires building human relationships with vendors.\n\n“In their opinion, there was less likelihood of that job being taken by AI,” Scabet said. “AI isn’t just going to walk into a factory and give a pitch about a machine.”\n\nFor more experienced workers, their encounters with AI in the workplace are pushing them to reconsider entire industries or build new skill sets.\n\nLiam Robinson, a 45-year-old animation artist, says he is actively avoiding jobs in the mobile gaming industry he has worked in for more than a decade. In his last role as an art director, his employer encouraged staff to use generative AI to speed up production. Robinson, who refused to use AI in his own work, said he watched the quality of animation suffer around him as his colleagues began relying on the tech.\n\nLast September, after disclosing in a self-evaluation survey that he wasn’t using AI, Robinson was laid off. It left him disillusioned with the direction of the industry. He believes AI flattens creativity, erodes craftsmanship and hurts the environment, fueling his resistance to work for companies building or deploying it.\n\nHe is not actively applying for new roles and instead is focused on creating webtoon comics. But if money runs dry, he said, he would take on other work, from driving for Uber to trash disposal. “As long as I’m useful and making a little money, that’s enough,” Robinson said.\n\nAs professionals like Robinson confront the possibility that skills they spent years mastering are no longer highly valued, many are redefining what stability looks like, according to Arianny Mercedes, founder of the career strategy firm Revamped.\n\nRather than chasing prestige or high salaries, Mercedes said her job-seeking clients increasingly prioritize roles tied to regulated or essential parts of an organization, such as healthcare administration, education or compliance.\n\n“The objective isn’t to avoid AI,” Mercedes said. “It’s to be in roles where AI changes the tools of work without undermining authority or decision-making.”\n\nFor others, the safest response to AI is to lean into it.\n\nAfter designing and developing websites for four years, Dmitry Zozulya decided to leave his work behind. As AI tools have proliferated and make it possible to code and create branding at a fraction of what it used to cost, the 29-year-old found it increasingly difficult to sell website and landing page work.\n\nInstead, Zozulya began offering AI-driven automation services, helping businesses streamline workflows. He now runs a small consultancy while building personal projects to deepen his experience.\n\n“I believe it’s very important to adapt,” Zozulya said. “Even when it’s uncomfortable.”\n\nWhether the rise of AI is steering workers away from entire industries or just certain roles, it is disrupting many people’s calculus for what their future at work will look like – and it’s happening abruptly.\n\nFor Ramirez, that recalculation began before he had even entered the workforce. He believes switching from computer science to nursing means he’ll find work after graduation, even if it means letting go of the future he once imagined.\n\n“When you throw AI into the picture, the likelihood of healthcare jobs disappearing is slim as of right now,” Ramirez said. “I can’t speak for the future, but in the next few years, they’re still going to be there.”",

    "fullText": "There was a backlash when No 10 invited online content creators inside its doors. But in a fast-changing media landscape, this solves two problems at once\n\nLast year, No 10 took an unprecedented step: it invited content creators to cross the threshold of Downing Street.\n\nNaturally, the creators all filmed themselves outside the famous door. Once inside, their most treasured possessions, their phones, were taken from them and exchanged for government-approved devices, so they could continue to take photos and record video without breaching security guidelines. At the reception, creators from areas as wide as science, education and travel took part in a networking session at the heart of government.\n\nThis was one of a number of events in 2025. There were also off-the-record breakfasts to talk about how creators might collaborate with the government to reach new and younger audiences. A large part of the work being done by No 10’s New Media Unit was aimed at working with financial education creators to help share new policies being launched by the Treasury.\n\nFinancial content creators were invited to speeches and briefings for the biggest political events of the year. When Anna Brading, a personal finance content creator, entered the No 10 briefing room for the spring statement, she could hardly believe it. Having three kids at a young age meant that she spent her time raising a family and making ends meet by tutoring maths on the side. As she managed her family’s money, she began posting tips online for other mums. Now she was in the room that public health experts had updated the public from during the pandemic. “The day I walked in that room, I had to take a minute,” she says.\n\nThis article includes content provided by Instagram. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. To view this content, click 'Allow and continue'.\n\nThere was, of course, a backlash as some journalists felt that these creators didn’t have the expertise or clout to hold the government to account, but this may be one of the few areas in which No 10 is getting it right. The unit is attempting to address two unavoidable truths: one, people don’t trust politicians; two, more people are now getting their news from content platforms. Using highly trusted content creators to share news of policies addresses both of these issues at once.\n\nFinancial educator Rotimi Merriman-Johnson, known as Mr MoneyJar, has recorded videos for policies such as changes to the minimum wage for young people. He began making content before training as a financial adviser, and is keen to emphasise that it’s not just about relaying any old information. It’s about consistently sharing quality information that makes a difference to people’s pockets. “Every additional year you spend as a content creator, you become more trusted … It’s not just about the information, it’s about the person sharing the information.”\n\nPolitical journalists, known as lobby journalists, have been permitted to work in parliament since the 1870s, sit in the press gallery watching the Commons floor, and receive briefings from the prime minister’s communication staff. The walls of the room where these briefings happen are lined with now-defunct telephone booths designed to allow reporters to file their copy down the phone. Desks in the members’ lobby, the room in which MPs gather before entering the Commons chamber, are pitted with now-dry ink wells. The bowels of Westminster are knotted with internet cables that sit – quite precariously – on top of old steam pipes. Inviting creators into the heart of government is yet another iteration of British politics and its institutions responding to technological innovation.\n\nSince their introduction more than 20 years ago, social media sites have evolved into “content platforms”. Once, Myspace, Facebook et al were spaces to connect with friends; with the advent of Instagram, they became places to follow lifestyle “influencers”; now they are platforms that host a never-ending stream of “content”. Some of the best creators lean hard into specialisms and niches, and present themselves as experts in specific areas. According to Diane Banks, the chief executive of talent management agency Northbank Talent: “We are in the age of the expert content creator.”\n\nIn many ways, these expert creators are the perfect interlocutors for the Starmer government: they are technocratic and emphatically apolitical. As creator Cameron Smith says: “When I go into these rooms I’m representing my audience’s interests, not the interests of these political parties.” In fact, being non-ideological is integral to the business model. Talent management agencies shy away from polemicists as they are difficult to monetise. Brands don’t like to work with opinions. In this sense, the UK is treading a different path from the US, as the White House has seen an exodus of mainstream reporters who are being replaced by regime-friendly influencers and commentators.\n\nOf course, the creators acknowledge the tension between pushing politicians on issues their audiences may be facing and needing to maintain access. This is especially pressing at a time when so many people feel knots tighten in their stomachs whenever they check their bank balances. There are more than a dozen major news publications in the UK, but millions of individual creators. It’s hard for a government to ignore – to pick an example out of nowhere – the Guardian for long, but easy to cast aside a creator who isn’t playing ball.\n\nCreator Mat Gay says: “It’s a difficult question because while I would love to push a bit harder and talk a little bit more about the things that people are worrying about, to me it’s more important to just get them to the table.” Gabriel Nussbaum believes things are shifting. “They were a little bit rigid at the start,” he says. “They said: ‘Can you submit five questions that you’d want to ask Rachel Reeves?’, for example. And then they’d come back and say: ‘Do you mind not asking question four and five?’” But now, he finds he is given the freedom to question politicians. A government spokesperson said: “We are engaging with content creators, as well as journalists to reach new audiences, ensure we are held to account in a changing media landscape and keep the public better informed about government policies.”\n\nTalking to these creators, I get the sense that they’re diligent and dutiful to their audiences, focused on the policy rather than the politics. Rather than political journalists, they seem to have \n\nKirsty Major is a deputy Opinion editor for the Guardian",

    "description": "Changing your rep range and your workout intensity can help you build more muscle, says an exercise scientist with decades of gym experience.",
    "fullText": "Jim Stoppani has been lifting weights for longer than most fitness influencers have been alive.\n\n\"I'v been training since I was a young kid, probably 7 or 8,\" he told Business Insider. \"My father built an amazing gym in our basement and I wanted to hang out with my dad, so I was down there learning the principles of weightlifting.\"\n\nNow at 58, with a PhD in exercise physiology, his own supplement brand, and a renowned research career, Stoppani has learned from decades of scientific study and first-hand experience what it takes to pack on lean muscle.\n\nHe recommends three strategies everyone should know to make the most of every workout for optimal gains.\n\nOne thing Stoppani has learned over his years in fitness is that progress will plateau — unless you make smart training decisions and plan ahead.\n\nThe human body has natural limits in how much strength or muscle mass we can achieve. As you work out and get stronger, you'll get closer to those limits, but additional gains become increasingly more difficult to earn.\n\nInstead of fighting for diminishing returns, diversify your fitness with different elements like power, agility, mobility, and stamina to get the most bang for your buck in the gym.\n\n\"I'm not going to put on 20 pounds of muscle at my age and with so many years under my training belt,\" Stoppani said. \"So why should I come in here and train like a bodybuilder every day?\"\n\nTo free up time to work on different skills without losing gains, Stoppani often uses a technique called a superset. A superset involves alternating between two exercises that recruit different muscles, with little to no break in between. Doing so allows one muscle group to rest while the other is working, cutting out your downtime in the gym (and potentially burning more fat in the process).\n\nStoppani uses the extra time to work on yoga, stretching, and cardio, to avoid any weak points in his fitness.\n\n\"The thing that I recommend as you get older is to be less singular in your goals and more well-rounded,\" he said.\n\nA concept called \"reps in reserve\" can help make sure you're pushing hard enough to make the most of your workouts, according to Stoppani.\n\nAt the end of each set, think about how many more reps you could do, if you really had to.\n\nToo many reps in reserve, and you're leaving gains on the table. For instance, if you finish a set of 10 reps, and feel like you could easily do 10 more, you should increase your weight or reps until it feels challenging.\n\nHowever, you don't have to push to your absolute limit with every set. Working to total muscle failure, the most you can possibly lift, comes with a risk of injury, and isn't necessary if you aren't a competitive athlete.\n\nFor average gym-goers, the sweet spot for building muscle is one to three reps in reserve, said Stoppani.\n\nHe recommends waiting until the last set to push closer to failure, and ending the set when you're too tired to complete the exercise with proper form.\n\n\"The key to turning on muscle growth is getting closer to muscle failure,\" he said.\n\nForget what you've seen from fitness influencers. There's no magic number when it comes to making your muscles bigger or \"toning\" them.\n\nBuilding muscle is all about challenging your body, whether you're lifting heavy weights for a few reps, or light weights for a lot of reps, according to Stoppani.\n\nBut your choice of weights can lead to slightly different results over time: heavier weights are ideal for getting stronger, while lighter weights help to maximize the signal for muscle tissue to grow.\n\nAs a result, using a variety of strategies can help you make better progress in the long run.\n\n\"The biggest misconception is that you can just use one rep range and stick to that forever,\" Stoppani said. \"You're eventually going to stop getting the same results because you're providing the body the same stress over and over and over again.\"\n\nPrevent your gains from stalling with a periodization plan, breaking up your training into sections of 6 to 12 weeks each. For instance, you might start with sets of six to eight reps, focusing on building strength, and after two months, switch to sets of 10 to 12 reps help boost muscle growth.\n\n\"The best way to build muscle is with change,\" Stoppani said.",

    "title": "Why haven't humans been back to the moon in over 50 years?",
    "description": "Humans haven’t been back to the lunar surface since the Apollo moon program ended over five decade ago. The reasons why go beyond science, according to experts.",
    "fullText": "As he took his final steps before leaving the moon, Apollo 17 commander Gene Cernan had some poignant closing words: “We leave as we came, and, God willing, as we shall return, with peace and hope for all mankind.”\n\nIt was December 14, 1972, and Cernan knew his footprints would be the last to impress the lunar soil for a while, because the planned Apollo missions that were supposed to follow — 18, 19 and 20 — had long since been canceled. But he probably wouldn’t have guessed that, over 50 years later, his speech would stand as the last words spoken by a human on the moon.\n\nArtemis II, which NASA is preparing to launch as soon as March after recent testing delays, will perform a lunar fly-by rather than a landing. Still, the mission will mark humanity’s first journey to the vicinity of the moon since Apollo 17.\n\nSo why has it taken so long for astronauts to go back?\n\n“The short answer to that question is political will,” said Teasel Muir-Harmony, a historian of science and technology and the curator of the Apollo Collection at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Washington, DC. “It takes a whole lot of political will to send humans to the moon. These are extremely complex, really costly, major national investments. It has to be a priority over a sustained period of time.”\n\nIn the years since the Apollo program ended due to budget cuts, there have been a number of other federal initiatives to send humans to the moon again, Muir-Harmony added. “But what’s happened is that as presidential administrations changed, space priorities for these large-scale programs also changed. And so we just haven’t seen the sustained political will to follow through with a program that will take many years, significant funding and lots of resources in general.”\n\nLes Johnson, a former NASA chief technologist who worked at the agency for over three decades, agreed that rapidly changing political objectives have been a key factor: “Every four to eight years, NASA has its human spaceflight goals and objectives completely, totally, radically altered,” he said.\n\n“When I joined NASA in 1990, we were directed to go back to the moon by then President George H.W. Bush. But when President Clinton took office in 1993, he canceled that. He said, we’re going to make the space station happen — don’t do anything associated with going back to the moon,” Johnson said. “We did that for eight years, and then in 2001 we got George W. Bush, and he said, cancel all this other stuff and let’s focus on going back to the moon. So we did, and a project called Constellation was born, which survived the two terms of the second Bush presidency.”\n\nThe cycle continued with Barack Obama moving NASA’s priorities more toward sampling asteroids, and President Donald Trump coming in and shifting back to lunar goals. Then, after 2020, Joe Biden broke up the pattern.\n\n“He was the first president in my career at NASA who did not change everything,” Johnson said of Biden. “He said, I really didn’t like a lot of what Trump did, but I think going back to the moon is a good idea. Let’s just keep going.” Now, in Trump’s second term, his administration has recently doubled down on returning astronauts to the lunar surface — intent on outpacing China in the new space race.\n\nPolitical hurdles aside, however, moon missions also present a remarkable technical challenge. Earth’s natural satellite is roughly a quarter of a million miles (over 400,000 kilometers) away, and over half of all lunar landing attempts have ended in failure. The Artemis program — making use of a rocket and spacecraft that have taken two decades and more than $50 billion to complete — is NASA’s latest and most promising attempt to bring such feats within reach.\n\nMany similarities between Apollo and Artemis are undeniable, including a near match in the mission profile between Apollo 8 and Artemis II, but re-creating the Apollo program today wouldn’t have been a practical — or logical — option.\n\nLong gone are the supply chains and skilled machinists that built the hardware for those mid-20th century moon missions.\n\n“People ask what was wrong with Apollo,” Wayne Hale, a former NASA space shuttle program manager, previously said during a Human Exploration and Operations Committee meeting. “The thing that was wrong with Apollo was it ended.”\n\nOne oft-mentioned piece of Apollo lore is that the program’s spacecraft and rockets were controlled by computers less powerful than a modern smartphone. And NASA has put many of those advancements to use, particularly when it comes to the robotic exploration of other worlds.\n\nBut spaceflight — and human spaceflight in particular — is far too complex, dangerous and expensive to directly translate computing advancements to easier, cheaper moon missions.\n\nThe technology regular folks interact with on Earth also has the benefit of being tested by millions of users and improved over decades of mass production.\n\nComplex missions to deep space, however, require multibillion-dollar contracts and years of continuous work toward the same goal — a scenario that has been hard to come by in the years since Apollo as presidential administrations have stopped and started various flagship human exploration programs.\n\nThe Artemis program is the most successful moon program the United States has had in decades, noted Casey Dreier, the chief of space policy at The Planetary Society, a nonprofit exploration advocacy group — “because it still exists.”\n\nAt the technical level, the differences between the Apollo and Artemis spacecraft are vast. For starters, Orion’s flight computers are 20,000 times faster and possess 128,000 times more memory than the lone machine that guided Apollo.\n\nThe Orion capsule offers the crew — increased from three to four — more space and opportunities for exercise and entertainment. And a much better toilet. “With the Apollo program, the astronauts had a waste collection device which was like a plastic bag with a rim, and they would stick it upon themselves. Not the most pleasant experience,” Muir-Harmony said.\n\nAboard Orion, which has about a third more habitable space than Apollo, the crew will enjoy the luxury of a real bathroom. “It’s a little room tucked into the spacecraft that they can go inside,” Muir-Harmony said. “It looks like a little closet or a little phone booth. It’s small, but there’s some privacy, which is pretty essential when you have a crew that’s both men and women.”\n\nDuring the Apollo era, she added, the bathroom issue was part of the discussion around whether women should be astronauts. “The Soviet program had a woman fly in space 20 years before the United States did. But some people said that designing bathroom technology for women in space was going to be too complicated,” Muir-Harmony said. “You can debate that, but it is important to think through privacy when you have a crew of both men and women, and so they were able to achieve that with the design of the Orion spacecraft.”\n\nIn-space bathrooms have come a long way since Apollo. The International Space Station, for example, has a comparatively spacious stall for washing and using the toilet. And the SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule, which since 2020 has transported astronauts to and from the orbiting laboratory, has a small private area with a vacuum toilet.\n\nThe goals of the two programs are also markedly different. Apollo already accomplished the one-off “flags and footprints” missions, Hale said.\n\nNow, NASA wants to create the infrastructure that will allow astronauts to live and work at a lunar base — eventually creating a sustainable, permanent human presence on the moon.\n\n“That means the landers that are being developed are designed to remain for longer than a day. They’re meant to be a part of a bigger architecture or system that will eventually have habitats on the moon,” Johnson said, adding that while the upcoming flight of Artemis II is reminiscent of Apollo 8, the programs will diverge dramatically after that.\n\nThe rise of the commercial space industry has helped fuel this decisive push toward revamping moon plans, according to Brian Odom, NASA’s chief historian.\n\n“NASA is now a customer to a private industry where we have SpaceX, Boeing, Blue Origin. That’s an enabling factor that’s helped us,” Odom said.\n\nSpaceX is among the biggest of those partners, and its CEO, Elon Musk, recently announced a dramatic shift in the company’s focus from prioritizing sending humans to Mars to first building “a self-growing city on the Moon.”\n\nHowever, Odom added, getting back to the moon has always been dependent on a number of pieces falling into place. “Space is very difficult and requires a lot of different things coming together at one time. Commercial commitments, international commitments and now the government — all three working together, is what’s really enabled us to get to this point,” he said.\n\n“It’s been a long road, but going back has always been a strategy, and it’s emerged in a couple of different moments. Now we have the infrastructure in place, we have partners in place — and it’s becoming possible.”\n\nCrucially, prolonged human presence on lunar soil will also benefit from the experience gained through the programs that followed the Apollo era, such as the International Space Station, where humans have had a permanent presence for over 25 years.\n\n“Returning to the moon will require long-term stays on the lunar surface, and thus understanding the effects of space habitation on the human body,” said James W. Head, a research professor of Earth, environmental and planetary sciences at Brown University who worked on the Apollo program.\n\n“And robotic missions flown in the interim, such as NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, have provided information on where to go and find the resources necessary to support human presence, indicating the possibility of water resources trapped at the lunar poles.”\n\nAnd if world leaders need extra motivation, Head added, they should look to the words of Apollo 16 Commander John Young, who was asked before retiring in 2004 what the point was of spending money to go to the moon. “Earth’s geologic history is pretty clear: It says, quite frankly, that single-planet species don’t last,” Young said.\n\nThe Apollo program had to contend with the deadline imposed by President John F. Kennedy, who in 1961 declared to Congress his goal to land a man on the moon before the decade was out. He wanted to beat the Soviet Union, which had already put a satellite and a man in orbit before the US.\n\n“A critical element to understanding the early space race and why the United States sent humans to the moon was the Cold War context, and the competition for the hearts and minds of the world,” Muir-Harmony said. “The United States was quite worried about Soviet influence, especially in newly established countries. Space exploration was seen as a really important tool of influence internationally.”\n\nToday, the United States considers China to be its archrival, and the government has sought allies to sign onto its vision of the future of lunar exploration with a set of international agreements called the Artemis Accords, which over 60 nations have now joined.\n\nThe nonbinding accords outline a safe, peaceful and sustainable approach to civil space exploration. They build upon the existing 1967 Outer Space Treaty, which states that no nation can claim territory in space as its own or use it to harbor weapons of mass destruction. However, the Artemis Accords were not negotiated multilaterally in the same manner as the Outer Space Treaty, and some analysts argue that they violate some of its principles, for example by allowing commercial mining on the moon.\n\nGoing back to the moon for a long-term presence and building an infrastructure in the lunar environment wouldn’t be sustainable for a single country, Odom said. “I think that’s what makes the Artemis Accords so good — they create a framework for opportunity, but they also double down on the idea that this is for humanity, not just one nation.”\n\nHowever, even though no other country has ever come close to sending a crewed mission to the moon, China also has concrete plans to do so by 2030 — and is not a signatory of the Artemis Accords.\n\n“There may be a perception that the US is in a race with China to the moon,” Odom said.\n\n“Maybe there’s a second space race, but I think that’s always going to be balanced with understanding risk, something that had become problematic in the early years of Apollo, when the idea that you had to do it before the end of the decade became a primary driver, and may have cost the lives of three crewmen,” he added, referring to the Apollo 1 accident in 1967 that killed all three crew members as a fire broke out in the cabin during a launch rehearsal.\n\nSince Apollo, Odom noted, the Challenger and Columbia disasters also cemented a more grounded approach to risk: “We’ve learned so many lessons the hard way, and now those lessons are being applied.”\n\nNASA’s Artemis program is sending humans into deep space for the first time in five decades.",

    "description": "Raphael Cuomo, also the creator of ‘Cuomo’s paradox,’ says survival epidemiology puts a greater focus on what helps people live longer after they get sick rather than on prevention in g…",
    "fullText": "Further deviating from a “one-size-fits-all” approach to health, UC San Diego professor Raphael Cuomo recently introduced a new field of science that he calls survival epidemiology.\n\nPutting a greater focus on what helps people live longer after they get sick, he hopes it will lead to new cures, more effective treatments and better disease-fighting approaches.\n\nCuomo, an associate professor in the UCSD School of Medicine and a member of the La Jolla university’s Moores Cancer Center, said he sees survival epidemiology as “a game-changer for the future of medicinal science.”\n\nIn essence, he said, survival epidemiology does not assume an exposure that influences prevention of a disease will have the same effect on survival when one gets the disease.\n\n“It differs from traditional epidemiology because traditional epidemiology has more of a focus on prevention in general,” said Cuomo, whose findings were published Dec. 27 in the Journal of Clinical Epidemiology. “And it differs from other kinds of science because it looks at the nuanced patterns of exposures that occur after diagnosis.\n\n“There have been studies done previously on large datasets to look at health outcomes in patients with [certain] conditions. … But the tool kit that should be used to approach the study of survival epidemiology has not yet been defined. And this field [and] this term has not yet been defined either.”\n\nA starting point for future studies in the field, he said, is the large volume of information in electronic databases.\n\n“These are incredibly valuable tools for helping to understand what is beneficial for people living with disease, because there are records on millions of patients out there and we can learn quite a lot from those records about what will improve health outcomes … and survival when you compare the nuanced exposures that people experience after they receive a diagnosis,” Cuomo said.\n\nSurvival epidemiology serves as a complementary branch of science tied to another concept Cuomo introduced last year.\n\nThe Nutritional Epidemiology Risk-Survival Paradox, coined “Cuomo’s paradox,” illuminates paradoxes in patient needs based on his evaluation of scientific literature on the influence of nutritional factors on disease prevention and mortality.\n\nHe posits that factors commonly viewed as harmful to health can paradoxically predict better survival in people who later develop cancer or cardiovascular disease.\n\n“There are instances in which … something that would increase risk of developing a disease may not be as big a concern for the survival of the disease after it has been diagnosed,” Cuomo said.\n\nEverything from obesity and alcohol intake to high amounts of cholesterol and antioxidant supplements can pose increased risk of chronic diseases, his research states. But what can harm someone in some circumstances could help in others.\n\nPeople who are considered obese, for example, are at greater risk of developing cancer or cardiovascular disease but have higher chances of survival than patients of normal or less than normal weight, according to Cuomo.\n\n“The personalization of medicine is very much a theme consistent across both ‘Cuomo’s paradox’ and survival epidemiology,” he said. “I will say, however, that survival epidemiology takes a bigger focus on the specific post-diagnosis period.”\n\nCuomo said he hopes survival epidemiology will enable treatments that accommodate patients in complex health circumstances. ♦",

The Tesla CEO’s most recent output displays a more consistent and explicit engagement with white supremacist content and nativist activists than in the past, however, lending them the imprimatur of the world’s richest person and spreading their ideas to his audience of over 200 million followers.

Several of Musk’s posts included what Braniff described as “textbook examples” of white supremacist conspiracy theories such as “the great replacement” – a belief that liberal elites or Jewish people are conspiring to use immigration to replace white populations.\n\nThe danger of Musk’s obsession lies in mainstreaming ideas that are deeply tied to violence and discrimination, according to Braniff, who is now executive director of the Polarization and Extremism Research and Innovation Lab (Peril) at American University. “The great replacement has been an especially important mobilizing narrative for highly lethal white supremacist attacks in the United States and elsewhere,” he said.\n\nMusk has repeatedly denied he is racist or antisemitic, stated that he condemns terrorism and said he does not advocate for violence. He asserted in a 2024 interview with Don Lemon that he does not He also told Joe Rogan in March last year that he is not a Nazi, weeks after facing condemnations from Jewish groups and the chairman of the World Holocaust Remembrance Center in Israel over his speech to Germany’s far-right AfD party in which he told Germans to move beyond their “past guilt”.\n\nAlthough Musk wrote a number of posts on race and immigration himself last month, much of his output involved reposting far-right activist accounts or replying to them with brief endorsements such as a bullseye emoji, implying agreement. On 10 January, Musk replied “yes” in reply to a post from a white nationalist account that claimed “race communism that destroyed Rhodesia and South Africa are the same things they are bringing to America and the rest of the Occident to turn us into the Global Favela”. The author of the post previously published a blog titled How To Build An American Orania – a reference to the privately owned, whites-only town of Orania in South Africa.\n\nSimilar interactions took place throughout the month. After a far-right influencer posted “they just want to eradicate White people it’s that simple” in reference to the New York Mayor Zohran Mamdani’s inauguration speech, Musk replied on 7 January “some people really do”. On 9 January, he wrote “true” in a quote-tweet of a post that claimed white people would be “slaughtered” as a minority and that “White solidarity is the only way to survive”. On 16 January, Musk reposted a rightwing influencer’s post claiming “white genocide is the official Democrat party platform”. The same day, he promoted another rightwing influencer’s anti-diversity post that used an AI-generated image of tattooed black women on Yale’s rowing team.\n\nWhile some of the accounts Musk interacted with are fringe social media influencers, several others are prominent far-right activists whose extremist views have been well-documented. On 17 January, Musk reposted a screed against “ethno-cultural upheaval” in Europe from Martin Sellner, far-right Austrian activist, who is the founder of the ethno-nationalist Identitarian Movement. Musk, who reinstated Sellner’s banned X account in 2024, replied to the anti-immigration post that “this is simply a statement of fact”.\n\n“Martin Sellner is probably the most significant global white supremacist right now,” Beirich said. “He’s the one who pushed the great replacement, and has now pushed the idea of remigration – ethnically cleansing western countries of non-whites.”\n\nSellner gave a presentation in 2024 at an event in Germany on the logistics of carrying out mass deportations that was attended by neo-Nazis and other extremists. The event sparked immense backlash and protests against the far-right across the northern European nation. Lawmakers attempted to ban him from the country. The Austrian activist also received a €1,500 donation from and communicated with white supremacist Brenton Tarrant, who would later go on to commit a terrorist attack in 2019 that killed 51 people at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand.\n\n Sellner rejected being described as a white supremacist and said he respects “the dignity of all others” in a statement to the Guardian, while taking credit for politically mainstreaming the concepts of the great replacement and remigration. “Now, from Trump to Musk, everyone is talking about replacement migration, the ethnic vote and remigration,” Sellner said. He additionally claimed that the Potsdam event was “misrepresented” by media and that he rejected any form of terrorism. Sellner described his interactions with Tarrant, which included offering to get a drink with Tarrant if he ever visited Austria, as limited to standard thank-you emails to a donor.\n\nExtremism experts said the ideas Musk has publicized are deeply tied to some of the most notorious, violent extremist attacks of the past decade, including the 2018 antisemitic attack on the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh and the 2022 racist mass killing of 10 people at a Buffalo supermarket. The shooter in Buffalo left a 180-page manifesto filled with mentions of white supremacist replacement theory.\n\nMusk’s posts also reflect an increasing embrace of white supremacist figures and talking points among prominent Republicans and government agencies in the past year. Some of that shift has played out on X, where Musk reinstated a number of formerly banned accounts such as prominent antisemite Nick Fuentes. Federal agencies such as the Department of Homeland Security have meanwhile posted content that aligns with white supremacist propaganda. Earlier this month, Donald Trump also drew widespread backlash after posting a racist video to his Truth Social platform that depicted Barack and Michelle Obama as apes.\n\nMusk has repeatedly mocked those who have criticized his comments as far-right or racist, framing his views as common sense or simply reiterating facts and statistics. His rhetoric reflects a widespread tactic among people on the far-right, experts say, when extremists attempt to defend their worldview of an in-group of white people against everyone else.\n\n“That reductionist worldview breaks down when people in your in-group say you’re full of it, that what you’re saying is wrong,” Braniff said. “So now the main requirement is to attack the dissenting in-group, to delegitimize them as race traitors and as woke.”\n\nAs February began, Musk was still posting about race and immigration on a consistent basis. He replied to an anti-immigrant activist this week who claimed that Ireland’s civilization would end “because Irish men are afraid of being called racist and upsetting people from the 3rd world”.\n\n“Such men are pathetic traitors,” Musk responded.",

    "description": "Aspiring computer science student Alex Seungyong Yang sees AI as both a challenge and opportunity as he enters university as a freshman in the fall.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Alex Seungyong Yang, an 18-year-old high school senior, based in Seoul. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nAs an incoming university freshman and the founder of an AI research startup, AI feels like a double-edged sword.\n\nI started my AI research and development startup with other students around the world, and AI has been amazing for us. It's allowed us to push further and think about achieving things we couldn't have imagined. On the other hand, I'm pursuing a computer science major this fall, and I keep hearing that computer science jobs are being replaced by AI.\n\nNo one has explicitly told me that pursuing computer science is a complete waste of time, but many people around me have expressed concerns about the risks it entails. I think those concerns point to something valid.\n\nSimply learning how to code no longer guarantees a stable or well-defined career path, but there are still many opportunities by staying within what I would call the \"eye of the typhoon\" and studying these machines, even if they are increasingly unpredictable.\n\nFrom 2025 to 2026, the tech industry changed so much. Last year, there was still a broad sense of expansion and experimentation, startups, new tools, and huge model launches. Now, what feels dominant is resource concentration in capital, compute, and top talent, along with a narrowing focus on AI infrastructure.\n\nThis kind of acceleration makes it so that one year doesn't feel like just a single year anymore. I think that computer science, engineering, and very technical majors are the only majors that can fully understand how this industry is changing and the direction of that change.\n\nI think the important part of studying computer science isn't about basic coding or programming; it's understanding the logic behind it and the framework that can be applied anywhere, anytime, wherever we are with technology. It's all about solving the problem, and I think that kind of talent is most relevant in the AI era.\n\nStudying computer science will help me adapt more flexibly and with greater urgency in my career. I want to use the knowledge from my degree to develop a niche kind of talent rather than simply following a very conventional pathway and becoming another factory-made worker.\n\nBeing unemployed or unable to find a job used to be the most obvious failure. Now, given how frequently unemployment is already happening around us, I don't think it can even be considered the greatest failure anymore. To me, the biggest failure would be an inability to adapt, and if we become irrelevant as technology advances.\n\nA small number of people or companies can now build and deploy things at a scale that used to require much larger organizations. Rather than only preparing for predefined roles, I spend time now and will continue to during my degree, building real systems, contributing to research, and working on projects where the constraints are unclear and the outcomes are uncertain.\n\nI see my computer science degree as a way to build depth, judgment, and adaptability rather than just technical skills.\n\nI don't see this as a guaranteed strategy, and I'm still learning what truly matters, but I hope that developing this ability in specific domains matters the most. I'm in competition with AI, but it's equally a competition with other people. I want to become an irreplaceable person, not just with AI, but also relative to other people.\n\nMany peers around me who are pursuing computer science and working on startups believe this is actually the easiest era to start something and succeed. Some majors naturally keep people closer to the frontier of change. I believe studying computer science, engineering, or mathematics trains you to reason from first principles, work with abstraction, and stay comfortable with uncertainty.\n\nThose habits matter more than any specific technical skills, which may quickly become outdated. Because the underlying skills are transferable, people in these fields may be better positioned to adapt when conditions change, even if the direction of change is unclear.\n\nI'm excited to pursue computer science, even though it might be uncertain how it will turn out. Things may become more complex, demanding, and challenging than I can anticipate, but I still believe there will be abundant opportunities for those who are willing to adapt, go deep, and continuously redefine their value.\n\nDo you have a story to share about higher education and AI?

    "title": "What People Are Getting Wrong This Week: Is Snow Fake?",
    "description": "The science behind a weather-based conspiracy theory.",
    "fullText": "Memphis city council members Pearl Eva Walker and Yolanda Cooper Sutton (and many other people online) say that snow is fake.\n\nSutton recently posted a video on her Facebook page to demonstrate the artificiality of snow. Over footage of her husband holding a snowball and a lighter, Sutton says, \"So we decided to see what was really hitting the ground.\" Her husband holds a flame to the snowball, and it does not melt.\n\n“It’s not melting [it stinks] when you set fire to it OMG, Jesus Christ, what is happening!!!” Sutton asks.\n\nIn the video's comment section, fellow council member Walker reportedly replied, \"man made,\" and included another video showing the same phenomenon. It looks like that specific video was taken down, but these kinds of posts are pretty common after snowstorms like the ones that just blanketed the US. Here are a couple of examples:\n\nSo: What's happening? Has plastic snow replaced the real stuff? Is this a flurry of misinformation? Are all these people just flakes?\n\nFirst, snow is real, but I understand why the Memphis council members would be suspicious. These videos are convincing, and they're not AI nor the result of people deliberately hoaxing with prop snow. They are documents of what happens when you hold a flame up to real, actual, fell-from-the-sky snow. You'd expect that holding fire to a snowball would make it melt into water in your hand but it just doesn't. No shade to people running their own experiments, but they're missing that snow can be counterintuitive.\n\nSnow is 90–95% air, so there's a lot less water than people might expect no matter how it melts. But the main thing going on is sublimation—a solid changing directly to a gas without first becoming liquid. When you hold a flame to snow, especially packed snow, much of it will become water vapor without becoming liquid water first. Sublimation is also why snow can seem to disappear without the temperature going above freezing. You can see sublimation in action in the video below.\n\nSnow is also porous. When a snowball melts, water is sucked to the center of the mass through capillary action, and it fills up the spaces that were once air. The video below shows unpacked snow on the ground being hit with a torch. Some of the snow is sublimating in response to the heat, while some of the surface snow is melting into water and being sucked into the empty spaces in the snow below it. You can see how it goes from \"powdery\" snow to more wet snow by the end of the video. (Also, these yahoos are going to burn down the trailer soon):\n\nThe scorch marks on the \"burning snow\" have an explanation as well: The flame from a match or a lighter is result of fuel burning—butane from a lighter; wood or paper from matches. As the fuel burns, it produces carbon soot, which reacts to the cold snow by condensing onto its surface. The soot isn't scorch marks from the snow burning. It's scorch marks from the butane or wood/paper burning. You can tell the snow itself isn't burning, because it never catches fire.\n\nThat leaves only the burning plastic smell that some report. That's actually the smell of the butane from the lighter not fully burning and/or the smell of the mercaptans sometimes added to butane so we can smell it. The result is a chemical odor that is easy to mistake for burning plastic, especially when you hold a flame up to soot you've already deposited on a cold surface. In this video, the conspiracy theorist used a candle instead of a lighter, and notes that it doesn't smell like burning plastic. That's because butane was absent.\n\nYou can try all this yourself to amaze your friends with the wonders of sublimation and/or trick a bunch of people on social media. It's easy:\n\nGrab some snow and pack it into a tight snowball. A more solid surface will help soot stick to it.\n\nApply flame from a standard butane lighter for a few seconds. If you use matches, you won't get the same burning plastic smell.\n\nCool scorch mark, right? Note how little water is dripping and how the snow is \"disappearing.\"\n\nNote the edges of the scorch mark. Here's where water that did melt was pulled toward the center of the snowball.\n\nIf you want to debunk the snow-burn conspiracy, simply hold the snow in your hand instead, and you will find that it melts into water.\n\nWhat if the government wanted to create a fake snow storm for some reason? It's possible—you can see fake snow at ski resorts during bad winters; you can buy your own snow-maker on Amazon for less than $100. The problem would be the scale. All \"they control the weather\" conspiracies fall apart when you consider the scale.\n\nArtificial snow is produced by spraying a mist of pressurized water into air that's below freezing. You could cover some trails at a ski resort without a problem, but a whole city or state would require a lot of snow. Industrial snow-making-machines use about 160,000 gallons of water to create one-acre-foot of snow. To cover a town that's 25 square miles with six inches of snow, you'd need about 1.28 billion gallons of water pumping through thousands of snow-guns. It would cost a lot, use a ton a fuel, and it wouldn't fool anyone anyway—those machines are loud as hell, and the snow wouldn't fall from the sky; it would shoot out of snow guns. You'd end up like, \"What am I even doing with my life?\"\n\nYou could also try seeding existing clouds with silver iodide to try to make it snow, but that's expensive too, and no one really one knows if it works at all.\n\nHumankind can collectively alter weather patterns—global climate change and all that—but we can't control weather. We can't make it snow on command in Memphis without anyone noticing thousands of roaring machines shooting artificial snow into the air any more than we can control hurricanes. The snow falling from the sky is real and it's made of frozen water crystals, just like it always has been.",

The specimen is assigned to †Ctenobethylus goepperti (Mayr in Die Ameisen des Baltischen Bernsteins. Beiträge zur Naturkunde Preussens, 1868), which we redescribe and re-diagnose, proposing †Eldermyrmex exsectus Dubovikoff et Dlussky, 2019 as its junior synonym (syn. nov., comb. nov.). We further infer a potential sister-group relationship with the extant genus Liometopum Mayr, 1861, suggesting that †C. goepperti may have been a dominant arboreal species in warm-temperate coniferous forests, a scenario which is supported by its abundance in Baltic amber. Critically, our results document endoskeletal structures in a Cenozoic fossil ant, underscoring both the morphological value of historical collections and the lasting scientific legacy of Goethe’s naturalist vision.\n\nJohann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749–1832), the polymathic poet, statesman, and naturalist, maintained a deep and lifelong engagement with the natural sciences, particularly geology, mineralogy, botany, and morphology. While he is most renowned for his literary works and philosophical contributions, Goethe also made original scientific observations, including his rediscovery of the os intermaxillare (premaxillary bone) in humans (Haas1, and c.f. Barteczko2), and played a key role in developing morphology as a scientific discipline. It has even been argued that Goethe’s artistic direction was of such a kind that it drove him necessarily to science (Steiner3). He conceptualized nature as a system in continuous transformation, driven by the interplay of form and function, a view that shaped his approach to classification and scientific observation. From this perspective of natural dynamism, he developed the concept of Reihenbildung (series formation) to describe orderly variation in natural systems (Mierbach4), a precursor to ideas central in evolutionary biology and systematics.\n\nGoethe’s scientific practice was deeply intertwined with his personal collections, now housed in the Goethe-Nationalmuseum in Weimar (Thuringia, Germany). Unlike many historical collections, his geological and mineralogical specimens, comprising over 18,000 objects, have been preserved nearly in their entirety and remain in their original location. Many of the objects reside in the same boxes and cabinets Goethe used, bearing his handwritten labels. This continuity offers a unique opportunity to study Goethe’s scientific perspective through the material record.\n\nWithin these collections, amber occupies only a modest place. Classified not among fossils but among combustible substances (“brennliche Wesen”), Goethe catalogued amber under fossil resins (“fossile Harze”), reflecting late 18th-century systematic conventions that grouped it with substances like bitumen and jet. A catalog from 1978 (Prescher5) listed only four amber entries; however, recent re-inventorying revealed at least 40 pieces, including two samples of “amber earth” (“Bernsteinerde”). These are housed in their original cabinet (“Schrank II”) and include specimens from the Baltic region, including Gdańsk and Pomerania. Although Goethe himself never made explicit mention of biological inclusions, and any scientific study of amber bioinclusions started only near the end of his life, especially in Germany with Georg Carl Berendt’s “Die Insekten im Bernstein” (The insects in amber) in 1830, our examination revealed three insect inclusions within two pieces: two nematoceran flies and a worker ant.\n\nHere, we present a detailed examination of this fossil ant, †Ctenobethylus goepperti (Mayr, 18686), using synchrotron radiation-based micro-computed tomography (SR-µ-CT). The scan allowed for a three-dimensional reconstruction of the specimen, revealing anatomical features that were previously inaccessible, particularly the tentorium and prosternum, two endoskeletal structures never before documented in Cenozoic fossil ants. Our study provides a redescription and re- diagnosis of †Ctenobethylus, establishing †C. goepperti as a senior synonym of †Eldermyrmex exsectus Dubovikoff et Dlussky, 2019 (syn. et comb. nov.). The refined morphological assessment allows for improved systematic placement and paleoecological inference, evidencing an arboreal lifestyle in Eocene coniferous forests. Through this work we document paleontological discoveries and provide a rare synthesis of Enlightenment-era collecting and modern analytical science, illustrating the enduring scientific value of historical collections. It also invites reflection on Goethe’s holistic and integrative approach to knowledge, an approach grounded in careful observation, the ordering of nature, and the search for underlying principles that bridge form and function.\n\nWe examined all 40 amber pieces using a stereomicroscope. Most were opaque, a natural state of many Baltic amber pieces, and a sign of an ongoing aging process. Of the 40, we used synchrotron radiation to exploratorily scan 30 pieces, including the two pieces that contained the three insect inclusions. In one piece, labeled ‘ID 1552.b’, we found one ant that we identified as †Ctenobethylus goepperti (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) and a dark-winged fungus gnat (Diptera: Sciaridae) (Fig. 1, 2, 3 and Suppl. Fig. 3). The other piece, labeled ‘ID 1550.d’, contained a blackfly (Diptera: Simuliidae) (Suppl. Figs. 1 and 2). Finer identifications for the two Diptera were not achieved yet, as their state of preservation could pose an insurmountable obstacle, even with µ-CT rendering. The family identity of the two flies was confirmed via contact with an expert (pers. comm. Björn Rulik, March 12, 2023).\n\nAmber piece 1552.b showing bioinclusions.

The specific differentiation of †Ctenobethylus relative to other Dolichoderinae is addressed in the Discussion under “Systematic implications” below. For a complete description and rationale for synonymization of †Eldermyrmex, see the Supplementary Results.\n\nSystematic implications: Placing †Ctenobethylus among Dolichoderinae is not trivial. We accept the placement of the genus in Tapinomini, first proposed by Ward et al.10, based on a process of elimination, wherein we used the favored multi-gene topology of Ward et al.10 for detecting morphological consistencies across the subfamilial phylogeny. Our reasoning for each dolichoderine tribe follows below.\n\nTribe Bothriomyrmecini. Although Arnoldius, Bothriomyrmex, and Chronoxenus have largely similar mesosomal forms (mesosoma compact, dorsal propodeal face short), †Ctenobethylus cannot be placed in Bothriomyrmecini, as it lacks the synapomorphic facial modifications of the constituent genera of this tribe. Specifically, the posterior clypeal margin of †Ctenobethylus extends posteriorly between the antennal toruli (vs. synapomorphy: this margin ending at around the anterior torular margin in all bothriomyrmecine genera), the antennal toruli are wideset, separated by more than one of their own lengths (vs. closely approximated in Loweriella and Ravavy), the frontal carinae are well-defined (vs. synapomorphy: effaced in Arnoldius, Bothriomyrmex, and Chronoxenus), and the medial hypostomal lamella is well-developed (vs. synapomorphy: reduced or absent in all bothriomyrmecine genera).\n\nTribe Leptomyrmecini. The propodeum of †Ctenobethylus does not appear diagnostic at first examination but is in fact distinct in comparison to the Leptomyrmecini. Across the leptomyrmecines, the dorsal propodeal surface is distinctly developed, being longer than the posterior surface (Iridomyrmex, Ochetellus, Papyrius, Philidris, Turneria, Axinidris, Forelius, Anillidris), about as long as the posterior surface (Azteca, Linepithema, Anonychomyrma, Dorymyrmex), or distinct but shorter than the posterior surface (Nebothriomyrmex). Doleromyrma and various Leptomyrmex have short dorsal propodeal surfaces but differ from †Ctenobethylus as the former genus has frontal carinae that are close-set, and the latter has an elongate body form and lacks the medial hypostomal lamella. Certain leptomyrmecine genera are further distinguished through petiolar form (high-squamate in Iridomyrmex, Ochetellus, Papyrius), eye form (anteriorly converging in Turneria), and almost all leptomyrmecines have anterior clypeal margins that are convex or sinuate in some manner, with the most limited exceptions being Dorymyrmex and Anillidris, which have weakly convex margins but are otherwise distinguished by several other conditions (e.g., psammophore development, torular separation).\n\nTribe Dolichoderini. The highly derived Dolichoderini can be excluded, as †Ctenobethylus lacks the flange-like anterolateral hypostomal teeth, a strong, large petiolar node, and the thick cuticular sculpture. Thus, only the tribe Tapinomini remains, as apparently inferred by Ward et al.10, Shattuck11,12, and Bolton13,14).\n\nTribe Tapinomini. Within the Tapinomini, †Ctenobethylus has been previously synonymized with the extant, arboreal genus Liometopum (Shattuck15), an inference that was not explained, or otherwise considered in detail (Dlussky and Perkovsky9). Given that the petiole of †Ctenobethylus plesiomorphically retains a small but distinct petiolar node and short posterior petiolar tube, it is reasonable to exclude the genus from the Axinidris + Technomyrmex clade and from the Tapinoma crown clade. Axinidris and Technomyrmex, further, have comparatively long to definitely long dorsal propodeal surfaces. Among Liometopum and the remaining tapinomine genera, Aptinoma and Ecphorella, †Ctenobethylus clearly differs from Ecphorella in having a linear anterior clypeal margin. Fascinatingly, †Ctenobethylus is morphologically intermediate between Aptinoma and Liometopum, and the relationship of these two taxa is in a virtual polytomy with Tapinoma given the analyses of Ward et al.10 and the reanalysis of Boudinot et al.16.\n\nThe available morphological evidence suggests that †Ctenobethylus is a stem group of Liometopum: (1) the second submarginal cell is present (see Fig. 45 of plate III in Mayr6 and the venational mapping of Boudinot et al.16 in Fig. 5; vs. absent in Aptinoma; note that reduction of this cell is prone to homoplasy across all dolichoderine tribes); (2) the head is distinctly cordate (vs. very weakly lobate posteriorly in Aptinoma); (3) the teeth are relatively coarse (vs. fine in Aptinoma); (4) the petiolar node is distinctly developed, raised above the levator process, and anteroposteriorly narrow (vs. node not distinct, not raised above process, broad in Aptinoma); (5) antennomere III is about half the length of the pedicel (vs. about as long as the pedicel in Liometopum); (6) the scape is short, not exceeding the posterior head margin in repose (vs. scape long as specified in Liometopum); and (7) the body lacks elongate erect setae (vs. with such setae in Liometopum). The mesosoma of †Ctenobethylus is further similar to Liometopum in having a large, cavernous metapleural gland opening and long mesonotum. Notably, the mesonotum of ant workers does not receive musculature; thus, this is primarily a structural feature that influences the geometry of the pronotum, and by consequence, the head. Development of the metanotum and impression of the metanotal groove does not appear to have much bearing on the distinction of †Ctenobethylus relative to Liometopum and Aptinoma.\n\n†Ctenobethylus goepperti is the most frequently encountered species of ants in Baltic amber, yet its abundance has paradoxically contributed to its scientific marginalization. However, through our renewed morphological considerations, particularly the probable sistergroup relationship to Liometopum, it becomes possible to make inferences of the biology of this fossil species. In terms of abundance, it is worth re-examining specimens of †Liometopum oligocenicum to determine whether they do, in fact, belong to Liometopum. Regardless, extant Liometopum are arboreal carton-nesters and form massive colonies that may extend from tree to tree. It is therefore possible that †C. goepperti was a dominant arboreal species in the humid and warm-temperate coniferous forests of Eocene Europe (e.g., Sadowski et al.17), which went extinct during the major climatological changes leading to the present day. Dlussky and Perkovsky9 previously speculated that the robust mandibles of †C. goepperti may have been useful for an arboreal lifestyle, specifically for excavating or boring wood. Where Liometopum are absent in contemporary central Europe, possibly due to Pleistocene glaciation, they are replaced by Lasius in the niger clade, by species of both the brunneus and niger groups as well as the highly derived fuliginosus group. In this light, turnover of the temperate Eocene ant fauna in European is further evidenced by the high abundance of extinct Formica species and †Lasius schiefferdeckeri in Baltic ambers and the very young age of crown Lasius (Boudinot et al.18). Seemingly a cursed genus given its taxonomic history (e.g., Shattuck15), †Ctenobethylus now appears to be a paleoecologically important taxon, being the likely Eocene analog of Liometopum.\n\nGoethe’s legacy in the natural sciences extends far beyond his renowned Farbenlehre (Theory of Color; Goethe19) and provides the poetic impetus for the journal Nature (Huxley20; see Suppl. Text Box), but also encompasses sustained engagement with geology, mineralogy, and biological form. Best known among scientists for his rediscovery of the human premaxilla and his formulation of the Urpflanze or archetypal form in plant morphology, Goethe helped lay the groundwork for comparative morphology and the study of metamorphosis in biological systems. Through both theory and practice, Goethe emphasized perceptual and conceptual synthesis, an aesthetic empiricism that sought truth through close observation, iterative experimentation, and attention to form and transformation, i.e., Goethe’s Naturphilosophie.\n\nGoethe shaped our modern patterns of biological inquiry by being among the first to integrate ideas about structure, differential development, and process over time. In particular, he distilled organismal science into the living concepts of morphology and metamorphosis, together, a broadly applicable theoretical framework for the consideration of analogy and homology (Hall21, Levit et al.22). Distilling complex reality into perceptible patterns once earned him a commendation as “the Copernicus and Kepler of the organic world” (Steiner23), and in order to shape this mentality, he placed great emphasis on the relationship between the investigator and their object of study. Namely, comparative morphology extends beyond simple comparison of anatomical facts; it requires direct human perspective to reveal the underlying metamorphosis and broader significance. From a Goethean perspective, comparative morphology is not only descriptive but also explanatory, even complementing modern molecular approaches in evolutionary developmental biology (Toni24).\n\nAcross multiple fields of study, it becomes clear that Goethe wanted to understand time and process, not only pattern (Sullivan25). In botany, Goethe sought the form of the Urpflanze that is contained in each plant today and how it manifests as variable leaf phenotypes (i.e., its processes of development) (Goethe26). He also endeavored to draw similar conclusions about the geological world, writing at length about granite and its status as the oldest of Earth’s ancient stones. The incredible antiquity of our planet, a long history documented in text-like layers in stones and mountains, was at the time a revolutionary idea with both religious and scientific implications. Geology was just beginning to develop from a classificatory scheme into a field concerned with the Earth’s formation and evolution (Sullivan25). In this context Goethe’s geological collections are herald of the shifting scientific perspectives of the era. Furthermore, reminiscent of modern museum archives, Goethe believed collections such as the en vogue “cabinets of curiosities” were shared intellectual capital rather than personal property. In the collection-themed novella “Der Sammler und die Seinigen”, co-written with Friedrich Schiller (1759–1805), he highlights the interpersonal aspects of collecting, such as corresponding about a collection’s inheritance and comparing and transferring specimens across different collections, making clear that these information-rich assemblages transcend a single owner (Schellenberg27).\n\nAmber was not central to Goethe’s scientific output, yet it occupied an intriguing intersection of his interests. Classified in Schrank II of his mineral system under combustible substances of economic value (“Brände”), amber was grouped with resins and other organic materials rather than with fossils. His amber holdings, some 42 catalogued pieces (of which 40 could be found) today preserved by the Klassik Stiftung Weimar, were acquired primarily from contemporary dealers, or gifts from friends with synergetic interests, such as Johann Georg Lenz (1748–1832) in 1796. Goethe was familiar with the fact, that amber could contain biological inclusions, as he held a friendship with Friedrich W. H. von Trebra (1740–1819), corresponded with him, read his works, quoted it, and kept two copies of his “Mineraliencabinett gesammlet und beschrieben” in his library that states on p. 125 “[…] das Stück Bernstein […] welches ein Lorbeerblatt, und ein Paar kleine Insecten darauf einschließt” (Trebra28). Thus, while he was evidently aware of the paleontological potential of amber, he did not examine these for inclusions, as suggested by his omission of contemporary works like Sendel29 and his lack of commentary on biological inclusions. Rather, Goethe conducted optical experiments using amber, attempting to observe visual effects like entoptic phenomena. These efforts culminated in the “Entoptische Farben” chapter of his 1820 supplement to Farbenlehre, demonstrating amber’s experimental utility in Goethe’s empirical investigations of light and vision.\n\nIn pursuit of botanical, geological, and optical knowledge, Goethe shared energizing conversations with famed naturalist and explorer Alexander von Humboldt (1769–1859), who was likewise trying to understand nature through both empirical analysis and aesthetic perception. These exchanges fueled Goethe’s desire to collect and curate his personal collections, creating a continuous cycle of artistic and scientific pursuits. Even today, aesthetic considerations remain significant to scientists. In a 2021 survey of 3442 scientists, 91% reported they find it important to encounter beauty, awe, and wonder in their work; moreover, 94% believed that science helps us better access the beauty that actually exists in the world (Jacobi et al.30). More frequent experiences of wonder and awe also correlate with higher job satisfaction and better mental health.\n\nFittingly our investigation bridges Enlightenment-era inquiry and modern morphological bioinformatics, or phenomics (i.e., big-data morphology; Deans et al.31). Using synchrotron radiation-based micro-computed tomography (SR-µ-CT), we scanned Goethe’s amber collection for bioinclusions. Remarkably, only two of the 40 pieces contained visible fossil insects: two nematoceran flies and an ant, †Ctenobethylus goepperti. This study presents the first high-resolution reconstruction of the ant (Fig. 3), permitting redescription of the species and genus, documentation of internal structures like the tentorium and prosternum (Fig. 4a and b), and a new taxonomic synonymy. These findings reanimate a neglected piece of Goethe’s collections and exemplify the growing potential of historical collections for generating new scientific knowledge.\n\nTransparent 3D renders of †Ctenobethylus goepperti in amber piece 1552.b. a Head frontal view showing the tentorium. b Mesosoma seen from lateral showing the profurca, legs removed.

Collectomics treats natural history collections not merely as repositories of objects, but as structured, information-rich datasets subject to modern scientific scrutiny. Our study contributes to this emerging framework by applying advanced imaging technologies to Goethe’s archival specimens, without altering their cultural integrity, and demonstrating that even long-frozen collections can yield unexpected scientific dividends. Ongoing imaging and provenance research work will improve the accessibility of these collections for cultural and scientific research (Schmuck33). This case also reflects Goethe’s own philosophy: that truth lies in the persistent, perceptive encounter with nature, and that empirical inquiry must be grounded in both historical consciousness and aesthetic sensibility.\n\n“Weder Fabel noch Geschichte, weder Lehre noch Meinung halte ihn ab zu schauen. ”\n\n(May neither legend nor history, neither theory nor opinion, prevent him from seeing.)\n\n– J.W. von Goethe, letter to the Duke of Saxony-Gotha, 1780 (as per Safranski and Dollenmayer34)\n\nAmber can preserve biological structure at unparalleled fidelity, and the Goethe collection, preserved through cultural significance rather than scientific design, has now yielded new insights through modern imaging. Our phenomic redefinition of †Ctenobethylus goepperti demonstrates the continued potential and relevance of historical collections for systematic revision and paleobiological interpretation. Through this lens, Goethe’s own epistemological commitment to observation, metamorphosis, and morphological synthesis finds renewed relevance. This study reflects the intersecting values of historical inquiry and contemporary science: where morphology joins informatics, where amber infirms evolutionary biology, and museum collections continue to generate knowledge when examined with care and curiosity, whether these are geological, biological, or cultural (Fig. 5). In a poetic inversion, we now use advanced imaging tools to peer through the same amber Goethe once used to explore vision. While Goethe opposed artificial enhancements of perception in principle, he embraced tools like microscopes and prisms when they aided genuine observation. This study honors that spirit by integrating visual technology with empirical inquiry and highlights the enduring value of historical collections for modern science.\n\nGoethe as a Natural philosopher. a Goethe and Schiller Monument in Weimar. b For Goethe, art, science, and humanity were inextricably linked. He was particularly invested in color theory and prisms on both a physical and a philosophical level; he painted and annotated this color wheel in 180935 for his Farbenlehre to symbolize the “human spirit and soul life” (image taken from: Freies Deutsches Hochstift, Frankfurter Goethe Museum; https://goethehaus.museum-digital.de/singleimage?imagenr=35554). c Goethe collected many natural objects; this specimen is the last remaining insect in Goethe’s collections (without the amber inclusions). The label states “Curculio imperialis”, today known as Entimus imperialis (Forster J.R, 1771), an endemic beetle species from Brazil.\n\nWe examined a total of 40 amber pieces found in Goethe’s collections held in Weimar (Germany). Of these 40 pieces four are presumably ambergris (produced in the digestive system of sperm whales). The remaining 36 pieces were classified as Baltic amber (47–34 Ma) (Kosmowska et al.36, Kasiński et al.37). Six of these were not scanned, as we could already observe under the microscope that they did not hold any bioinclusions. In total 30 pieces were suitable for scanning.\n\nNo piece was ground or polished, as the objects are of significant cultural value. Pieces were cleaned with a dust blower and Super Soft Dusting Brush (Preservation Equipment Ltd. Vinces Road, Diss, Norfolk, UK). Stacks of partially focused images were taken of the amber pieces with a Canon EOS R5 equipped with Canon EF 100 mm f/2.8L Macro IS USM (Canon, Krefeld, Germany). For focus stacking, the internal camera software was used. The camera was mounted on a Kaiser copy stand (Kaiser Fototechnik GmbH & Co. KG, Buchen, Germany). The scene was illuminated with a Euromex LE.5211–230 cold light source for stereomicroscopy (Euromex, Papenkamp, the Netherlands) equipped with three gooseneck lamps to adjust light conditions and prevent reflections. Underneath the camera a blurred glass plate was positioned over a black sprayed Kapa® box (Kohlschein GmbH & Co. KG, Viersen, Germany). The amber pieces were placed on the glass plate in a petri dish filled with distilled water (Sadowski et al.38). Additional photographs were taken with the same camera and lens.\n\nIn total 30 pieces of Baltic amber from Goethe’s collections were first scanned at the Deutsches-Elektronen-Synchrotron (DESY), Hamburg, Germany and subsequently at the Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology, Jena, Germany.\n\nIn two pieces animal inclusions were found (Fig. 1 and Suppl. Fig. 1) under the light microscope, these were scanned at the DESY using synchrotron radiation (SR-µ-CT) at the Imaging Beamline p05 (IBL) operated by the Helmholtz-Zentrum Hereon at the storage ring PETRA III. A photon energy of 18 keV and a sample to detector distance of 30–50 mm was used. Projections were recorded using a 50 MP CMOS camera system with an effective pixel size of 0.46 µm. 4001 projections were recorded for each tomographic scan at equal intervals between 0 and π, with an exposure time of 350 ms. When specimens were too large to fit into the field of view in the z-axis, we scanned overlapping sections and subsequently stitched them together. Tomographic reconstruction was done by applying a transport of intensity phase retrieval and using the filtered back projection algorithm (FBP) implemented in a custom reconstruction pipeline (Moosmann et al.39) using MATLAB (Math-Works) and the Astra Toolbox (Palenstijn et al.40, van Aarle et al.41,42). For further processing, raw projections were binned two times resulting in an effective pixel size of the reconstructed volume of 0.913 µm. For segmentation and visualization, the 32-bit .tif image sequences were converted to 8-bit files and down sampled twofold with Fiji (Schindelin et al.43), resulting in an effective pixel size of 1.826 µm. Pieces with no visible bioinclusions were “pre-scanned” and checked if there are any specimens inside (see Suppl. Tables 1 and 2).\n\nAll ambers pieces were pre-scanned with a SkyScan 1272 (Bruker, Belgium) equipped with an Xray sensitive xiRay16 (4872 × 3248) (Suppl. Table 2). One of the seven pieces labeled with ID 1552.b containing †Ctenobethylus goepperti and a sciarid fly was irradiated with a voltage of 25 kV and a current of 125 µA. The exposure time for one image was 5.19 s. A pixel size of 7.4 × 7.4 µm2 was achieved. The 360° scan was accomplished in 0.2° steps. Three additional pieces, suspected of containing bioinclusions, labeled with ID 1550.d were quick scanned with the same parameters, except for source voltage of 23, 27 and 30 kV and a current of 130 µA.\n\nµCT-image stacks were segmented and 3D-reconstructed using Amira 6.0.1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA) and Dragonfly 2022.1 (Object Research Systems, Montreal, Quebec, Canada). tif image stacks and files containing the isosurfaces were exported with the Amira macro “Multi-Export” (Engelkes et al.44). The isosurfaces were reduced and smoothed under the following parameters: ItTotal: 5; smooth: iteration: 4, lambda: 0.6; reduction: 0.7. The resulting .tif image stacks were volume rendered in VGStudio Max 2.0 (Volume Graphics, Heidelberg, Germany) using the option Phong reflection model. The isosurfaces were further smoothed (modifier: smooth and option shade smooth) with Blender 3.2.0 (Blender Foundation). The 3D-Models were uploaded to the 3D model repository Sketchfab (https://sketchfab.com) using the free blender plugin: Sketchfab for blender 1.5.0 (https://github.com/sketchfab/blender-plugin/releases/tag/1.5.0).\n\nThere is no doubt the material is any other than Baltic amber, an assumption confirmed by spectroscopy for amber piece 1552.b. Since these amber pieces are highly brittle as a result of their basic storage conditions in the hallway to Goethe’s “Arbeitszimmer” (study room), a small piece unintentionally broke off of specimen 1552.b, the piece that contains two bioinclusions, during transportation and scan preparations. The crumb was sent to the International Amber Association (IAA; Gdańsk, Poland) for UV fluorescence and Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The results showed that the piece is true Baltic amber (Report No 41992_17022023). Due to their inestimable cultural value, we refrained from examining further pieces. As this would mean sending the whole amber pieces to the IAA or cutting off small flakes, that would bear the risk of harming the objects.\n\nRenders of the synchrotron-scanned specimen were used to evaluate gross morphology as well as structures that are otherwise hidden or internal; the specimen could not be clearly seen under standard light microscopic conditions. As needed to evaluate given characters, comparisons were made to images hosted on AntWeb45 and the literature, particularly Richter et al.46,47,48,49,50 and Boudinot et al.51 for the tentorium. For the prosternum, we referred to Aibekova et al.52 and Aibekova et al.53. Terminology used for description and discussion follows these references for the head and mesosoma, with the addition of Lieberman et al.54 for the metasoma. Detailed comparisons of worker morphology were made for the following genera based on AntWeb (numbers in square brackets indicate taxon sampling within the indicated tribe): Bothriomyrmecini [5/5] (Arnoldius, Bothriomyrmex, Chronoxenus, Loweriella, Ravavy); Dolichoderini [1/1] (Dolichoderus); Leptomyrmecini [16/16] (Anillidris, Anonychomyrma, Azteca, Doleromyrma, Dorymyrmex, Forelius, Froggattella, Gracilidris, Iridomyrmex, Leptomyrmex, Linepithema, Nebothriomyrmex, Ochetellus, Papyrius, Philidris, Turneria); Tapinomini [6/6] (Aptinoma, Axinidris, Ecphorella, Liometopum, Tapinoma, Technomyrmex).\n\nMeasurements were taken from the 2D orthographic renders in parallel perspective of the fossil in full-face and lateral view using Adobe Illustrator.

    "description": "Lindsey Vonn isn't the only woman athlete extending her Olympic career into her 40s. Here's what science says about their longevity.",
    "fullText": "MILAN ― A 41-year-old Olympian crashes on a mountain while preparing for the 2026 Winter Olympics and will compete anyway.\n\nThat's not just Lindsey Vonn, the downhill ski racer. It's also Elana Meyers Taylor, the 41-year-old bobsledder who took a spill during a practice run in early January. And Kaillie Humphries, the 40-year-old bobsledder, she knows about aches and pains, too.\n\nDetermination and struggle are part of what bind these members of Team USA.\n\nVonn, Taylor and Humphries have extended their Olympic careers beyond the normal threshold for world-class athletes, and now they'll get a chance to shine at the Milano Cortina Games.\n\n\"I think I’m proving to the world that a woman at 41 can do anything they set their mind to,\" Vonn said.\n\nThat was before she ruptured the ACL in her left knee Jan. 30 in the World Cup downhill in Crans-Montana. What's happening now helps shed light on what sets these women apart from the pack.\n\nOpinion: Lindsey Vonn believes in herself. About time everyone else does, too\n\nChronic injuries led Vonn to retire in February 2019. Her comeback did not begin in earnest until after she had partial knee replacement surgery on her left leg in April 2024.\n\nThat November, she announced she was coming out of retirement.\n\n\"I kept pushing myself further and further to see what I was capable of, and skiing and racing seemed like the logical next step,\" Vonn said in October at the Team USA Media Summit in New York. \"And, yeah, when I decided to start racing again, I kind of had (the Olympics) as a possibility.\"\n\nShe’s not doing this on her own, of course.\n\nVonn’s coach is Aksel Lund Svindal, the retired Norwegian skier who won two Olympic golds, a silver and a bronze. Her trainer is Peter Meliessnig, who worked Anna Veith, the retired Austrian skier who won an Olympic gold, silver and bronze.\n\nIn December, Vonn told reporters she had gained 12 pounds over the summer.\n\n\"Physically I'm in possibly the best shape I've ever been in,\" Vonn said at a news conference in the Swiss resort, according to the Associated Press. \"And my body doesn't hurt, so that's the best part of all.\"\n\nAbout two months earlier, at the Team USA Media Summit, Vonn said her training regimen was different because of \"more knowledge.\"\n\n\"The way we train now is so much different than when I started my career,\" she said. \"From the training, to also diet and recovery and how we approach all of those things.\n\n\"I feel like I can recover faster because of those things. I’m training a lot smarter. I used to overtrain when I was younger. I would do three sessions a day, which now looking back seems completely insane and unnecessary. So I think the way I’ve  trained is not age specific. It’s just smart training for any athlete.\"\n\nHumphries competed for her home country of Canda at the 2010, 2014 and 2018 Games. But she competed for the United States in 2022 after filing a complaint accusing her former coach in Canada of abuse and marrying an American man.\n\nThe aging process seemed like the least of her troubles as she became the first gold medal winner in the women’s monobob at the Beijing Games.\n\n\"I loved my 30s,\" Humphries told USA TODAY Sports. \"I thought they were awesome. And 40 is no different. It's not like you all of a sudden go downhill…\n\n\"I liked having a little tighter of a face when I was 20. Don't get me wrong.\"\n\nShe’s shown the ability to adapt on the track, transition the two-woman sled in which she won two Olympic golds and a bronze to the monobob, where in 2022 she won another gold in the single-rider sled’s Olympic debut.\n\n\"My body gets into shape really fast,\" Humphries said. \"The muscle memory's there, so that's awesome. But I also lose it really quickly. So I don’t get spend too many days not doing anything because it needs that constant feedback.\n\n\"I'm a lot more confident in myself, in my ability and who I am as a person versus when I was 20. And I know that that affects performance hands down because I know I can go out there and perform where when you're 20 you're like, please just hold on. Don't make mistakes. The things you're scared of or worried of are just so different. And so I don't worry about those things anymore.\"\n\nTaylor, who is eight days older than Vonn, said competing as older athlete is expensive. The latest example was a crash she had during a practice run on the bobsled in Switzerland the first week of January, according to Taylor.\n\n\"I had that crash this week, so next week I'll have to fly out a physio (therapist) to come and work on me just for a week and buying a last-minute train ticket or last-minute flight to Berlin and booking hotel rooms and all this kind of stuff,\" Taylor, who will be competing in her fifth Olympics, told USA TODAY Sports. \"Fortunately, I'm in a position within my sport that I'm able to afford it, but it's not cheap. It's not cheap to keep up this kind of level of performance. And you have to make those kind of financial sacrifices. You have to spend more on nutrition. You have to spend more on making sure you're not sitting in the back of a plane. You have to pay extra for an aisle seat and all those kind of stuff because the difference it's going to make at the end of the day.\"\n\nIn her 20s, Taylor recalled, she experimented with different approaches to training to try to figure out what worked best. Those days are long gone.\n\n\"Now everything's down to science, everything's down to a T,\" Taylor said. \"We monitor nutrition and hydration. And not to say we weren't doing that stuff before, but now it's much more meticulous…\n\n\"In your 20s, you could sleep four hours and still have a great race. Now it's like, I need nine hours of sleep, and if I don't, we're going to pay some prices. So everything has to be maximized because father time isn't on your side anymore.\"\n\nKevin Murach, an associate professor at the University of Arkansas with an expertise in human performance, said scientific research helps explain why it's possible for women to thrive in their 40s. He cited the benefits of \"muscle memory\" and new ways to improve recovery.\n\nHe addressed Vonn's success despite a layoff of almost six years. (Deep breath as we plunge into the science.)\n\n“…the research from my lab and others suggests that there are possible mechanisms specifically within skeletal muscle that can contribute to a rapid recovery of exercise adaptations following a layoff from consistent training,\" Murach wrote in an email to USA TODAY Sports. \"What those specific mechanisms are is a topic of debate – my research suggests it could be related to epigenetics in muscle – I think it is becoming more accepted that there is a ‘muscle memory’ of previous training that sensitizes the muscle to retraining.\"\n\nWith regard to Humphries and Taylor, Maruch suggested that emphasis on recovery has contributed to their longevity in elite competition.\n\n\"I speculate that training loads have been adjusted to accommodate for longer recovery time which can be a consequence of the aging process,\" he said. \"Different recovery tactics as well as an emphasis on quality sleep, in addition to monitoring various physiological metrics for quantifying recovery using new technologies and leveraging data to guide training decisions, seems to have increased in popularity in recent years. I suspect it is a variety of factors that are allowing for longer careers at the highest level of sport.\"\n\nUltimately, Murach put things in simpler language.\n\n\"In any case,\" he said, \"the success of these women into their 40s gives the rest of us hope.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: How Lindsey Vonn, other women extend Olympic careers into 40s",

    "fullText": "Device-independent quantum key distribution (DI-QKD) is a key step toward the quantum internet, as it provides the highest level of cryptographic security allowed by quantum mechanics. For it to have practical applications in a communication network, it must be achieved between nodes that are sufficiently far apart. An article published in Science demonstrates DI-QKD for the first time between two single-atom nodes connected by 100-kilometer-long fibers. This distance would be sufficient to achieve cryptographic security at a metropolitan scale.\n\nRamón y Cajal Researcher Department of Theoretical Physics UAM Madrid\n\nIn a future quantum communication network, a sufficiently large and reliable quantum computer (far beyond anything we currently have) could break the cryptographic keys used to protect our data and operations. The solution is to use new cryptographic keys based on the properties of quantum physics. These new keys are also vulnerable to certain types of attacks, but a particularly secure way to generate them is for the sender and receiver to share a quantum system with the celebrated property of quantum entanglement. Any attack would destroy the entanglement, which would be easily detectable by measuring the so-called Bell inequalities. This is the principle behind device-independent quantum key distribution (DI-QKD).\n\nIf we truly want DI-QKD to have practical applications in a future communication network, we must be able to perform it between network nodes separated by sufficiently large distances.\n\nIn this Science article, the researchers succeed in implementing DI-QKD between parties separated by distances ranging from 10 to 100 kilometers. The quantum systems that are entangled are neutral rubidium atoms.\n\nThe method used to entangle them was proposed, among others, by Ignacio Cirac in 2001 and consists of detecting the light emitted at a point halfway between the atoms. Since this light can originate from either atom indistinguishably, the rules of quantum physics tell us that, upon measuring a photon, the atoms become entangled. Although in this experiment the atoms are not actually separated by tens of kilometers—because they are located in the same laboratory—the distance is simulated by sending the light through coiled optical fiber cables of those lengths.\n\nQuantum entanglement is a very fragile property: as light travels through the fiber, small losses accumulate, and the resulting entanglement is of lower quality, which translates into higher error rates in the generated cryptographic keys. The experimental results show that the key error rate ranges from 3% at a distance of 11 kilometers to more than 7% at 100 kilometers. Therefore, although this represents an important step in the right direction, we are still far from being able to achieve a completely secure, error-free quantum key distribution over intercity distances.\n\nICREA research professor at the Institute of Photonic Sciences (ICFO)\n\nWhat does this advance consist of?\n\n\"Cryptography is a very important field today: every day, a large number of confidential information exchanges take place. Quantum key distribution (QKD) cryptographic protocols allow two honest users—usually referred to as Alice and Bob—to share a secret key, which can then be used to transmit confidential information privately. This represents a paradigm shift: in these schemes, the security of the protocol is guaranteed by the laws of quantum physics.\n\nAround 2010, a series of successful attacks on QKD implementations showed that the security of these protocols can be compromised if the devices used in practice do not behave exactly as assumed in the theoretical description of the protocol. In other words, any mismatch between theory and experiment opens up opportunities for an adversary to break the security. To address this weakness, device-independent QKD protocols were introduced. In these protocols, the theoretical description makes no assumptions about the devices (it is independent of them), which are treated as black boxes. There is therefore no gap between theory and experiment that an adversary could exploit to break the communication, as in the earlier successful attacks. Device-independent protocols provide the highest level of security guaranteed by quantum physics. The quantum property used to achieve this exceptionally strong level of security is the violation of the so-called Bell inequalities, which is observed when measuring entangled particles.\n\nThe drawback of device-independent protocols is that their implementation is complex. Before this experiment, they had only been demonstrated in a configuration where the distance between Alice and Bob was two meters. The result was remarkable as a proof of principle, but in practice we do not usually need full cryptographic schemes to secure a transaction between two people who are only two meters apart. Taking a couple of steps would be more than enough 😊.\n\nThis article reports the experimental implementation of a device-independent protocol over distances of tens of kilometers, which are far more interesting from a practical point of view, and therefore opens the door to the viability of these protocols\".\n\n\"Excellent. It is a major achievement and a very significant improvement over the state of the art: it is the first practical demonstration of device-independent quantum key distribution\".\n\nAre there any limitations that should be taken into account?\n\n\"Despite being an impressive advance, it still has aspects of a proof of principle. The most important one is that Alice and Bob are not separated by tens of kilometers. They are located in the same laboratory, but connected by a fiber whose length is tens of kilometers. In principle, this configuration simulates the situation in which Alice and Bob are located at sites separated by tens of kilometers and connected by a fiber, but in practice it is not exactly the same.\n\nA slightly more technical point: the experiment reports that, for fiber distances of hundreds of kilometers, the conditions required to successfully carry out the protocol are observed, but a complete implementation has not yet been achieved\".",

Jupiter, a world that is so huge that it could hold 1,000 Earths, is eight kilometers narrower in width at its equator and 24 kilometers flatter at its poles than had been previously estimated, according to a new study.\n\nThe new measurements overturn almost 50 years’ worth of consensus about the size and shape of the planet.\n\n“Textbooks will need to be updated,” said Yohai Kaspi, a professor at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel, and senior author of the study, in a statement. “The size of Jupiter hasn’t changed, of course, but the way we measure it has.”\n\nPreviously, scientists relied on observations by the Voyager and Pioneer spacecraft, which were launched by NASA in the 1970s. But NASA’s Juno mission, which launched in 2011 and reached Jupiter in 2016, has proved to be a game changer: By orbiting over Jupiter’s poles for the first time, it allowed for clearer observations of Jupiter’s size.\n\nThe research means scientists have to adjust their models of Jupiter, a change that will have resounding implications for both studying the planet’s features, such its volatile atmosphere, and understanding how gas giants like Jupiter formed in the first place.\n\n“Jupiter was likely the first planet to form in the solar system,” Kaspi said in the same statement, “and by studying what’s happening inside it, we get closer to understanding how the solar system, and planets like ours, came to be.”",

    "fullText": "Hundreds of parents, teens and school districts have claimed social media is intentionally addictive and harmful\n\nSocial media companies will have to answer to a jury – for the first time – for allegations that their products are intentionally addictive and harmful to young users’ mental health. Hundreds of parents, teens and school districts sued Meta, Snap, TikTok and YouTube, leading to a series of landmark trials that began this week. Jury selection in the first case started on Tuesday in Los Angeles court.\n\nMeta’s Mark Zuckerberg is among the big tech CEOs who are expected to testify. Both sides are likely to bring in experts to hash out the science behind alleged addiction to social media.\n\nThe initial trial involves a 20-year-old, identified by the initials KGM, who alleges she experienced physical and emotional harm after becoming addicted to social media at age 10. This case is expected to last six to eight weeks, and will be the first of about 22 “bellwether” trials. The outcome can signal, and influence, how courts and juries may handle similar lawsuits in the future. Snap and TikTok have settled with the plaintiff in the first case, leaving Meta and YouTube to stand trial.\n\n“Everybody’s looking at it as a data point,” said Benjamin Zipursky, a law professor at Fordham University.\n\nThe legal proceedings follow years of heated criticism of tech companies from angry parents; they blame social networks for causing eating disorders, suicidal thoughts and anxiety in their children. The companies lay blame on the victims, plaintiffs’ lawyers and supporters say: “The tech companies blame parents for not being good parents,” said Sacha Haworth, executive director of the Tech Oversight Project, which has been involved in advocacy work for the plaintiffs. “Their experience has shown that you can be the best parent in the world – you can have conversations, you can limit screen time, you can turn on the bullshit parental controls – and your kid still dies.”\n\nThe cases and future settlements could eventually change the way social media platforms work; plaintiffs are asking for money, as well as injunctive relief that would establish industry-wide safety standards. Legislators around the world are watching; many are trying to impose liability on tech companies in a similar way as the plaintiffs. So even if juries declare the defendants aren’t liable in these cases, lawmakers will be taking notes–and adapting their own strategies, says Eric Goldman, a professor at the Santa Clara University school of law. Some have already enacted laws that align with the plaintiff’s claims.\n\nThere’s more at stake now, legal experts say. “Bad press about how some members of Congress embarrass Zuckerberg is one thing,” Zipursky added. Changing the architecture of a social network may be another entirely.\n\nPlaintiffs want to know: how much did tech companies know about the alleged harm caused by their products, and to what extent did they fail to warn users? They take particular issue with design features such as infinite scroll, autoplay and content curated by algorithms, accusing social media companies of prioritising engagement over wellbeing. Their legal strategy has brought up comparisons with those used against tobacco companies in the 1990s.\n\nThe trial will explore what social media addiction consists of. Tech companies have questioned the scientific link between their platforms and addiction. They also highlight various safety features and parental controls they adopted in recent years. Even if this harm exists, they argue, it’s a result of problematic content, as opposed to a poorly designed system. In doing so, the companies have often relied on a federal law that shields them from liability for third-party content on their platforms: section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. That defense hasn’t worked so far in this case, given the plaintiffs’ novel argument.\n\n“[Plaintiffs] have reconfigured it to say, look: the wrongful thing Meta is doing is running its whole platform in such a way that people get addicted,” Zipursky said. A key issue will be whether plaintiffs can prove the tech companies were wrongfully taking harmful risks, Zipursky added. Moreover, if the plaintiffs can prove that tech companies knowingly and intentionally caused harm, it will be easier to get punitive damages.\n\nSocial media addiction is not included in the latest edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the authoritative handbook for mental health treatment. Scientists have, however, catalogued compulsive use with severe consequences among young people, and legislators across the world are engaged in heated debate over its addictive potential and how to respond.\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, YouTube CEO Neal Mohan and Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri are expected to testify in the initial trial. Snap and TikTok reached a settlement in that case but are still defendants in other suits in the state-level trial.\n\nA Meta spokesperson said in an emailed comment that they strongly disagree with these allegations, and stressed that they have listened to parents and worked with experts and law enforcement to address safety issues. The company also cited the introduction of teen accounts, with additional protections.\n\nGoogle spokesperson José Castañeda called allegations in the lawsuits “simply not true”, and emphasized that the company had prioritized providing a safe and healthy experience for young people. Snap commented only on the first bellwether trial, saying they were “pleased to have been able to resolve this matter in an amicable manner”. TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nWhile much of the cases is yet to play out, some unsealed evidence has already drawn criticism of tech companies. That includes allegations that an Instagram employee compared the app to a drug, and that another suggested: “lol, we’re basically pushers.” A Meta spokesperson previously told Politico that the plaintiffs’ allegations relied on “cherry-picked quotes and misinformed opinions in an attempt to present a deliberately misleading picture”.\n\nThe 20-year-old at the center of the initial trial started using social media around age 10, even as her mother tried to stop her from using the apps. She “developed a compulsion to engage with those products nonstop” as a result of their “addictive design” and “constant notifications”, the complaint notes, according to NPR.\n\nLegal experts expect all of these cases will eventually be appealed if they don’t reach a settlement, and there’s no certainty about outcomes until appellate courts have weighed in. They expect tech companies to raise several issues, including whether the Communications Decency Act or first amendment applies, as well as potential disputes over causation and expert testimony. “None of these companies are going to feel that they need to change what they do,” Zipursky said.\n\nStill, juries’ verdicts in the early cases can affect how much companies may pay out. “The jury might signal they’re completely persuaded by the plaintiff’s arguments,” Goldman said. “Then, if there’s any settlement, the price tag will go up substantially.”",

    "description": "The National Institutes of Health failed to protect brain scans that an international group of fringe researchers used to argue for the intellectual superiority of white people.",
    "fullText": "Genetic researchers were seeking children for an ambitious, federally funded project to track brain development — a study that they told families could yield invaluable discoveries about DNA’s impact on behavior and disease.\n\nThey also promised that the children’s sensitive data would be closely guarded in the decade-long study, which got underway in 2015. Promotional materials included a cartoon of a Black child saying it felt good knowing that “scientists are taking steps to keep my information safe.”\n\nThe scientists did not keep it safe.\n\nA group of fringe researchers thwarted safeguards at the National Institutes of Health and gained access to data from thousands of children. The researchers have used it to produce at least 16 papers purporting to find biological evidence for differences in intelligence between races, ranking ethnicities by I.Q. scores and suggesting Black people earn less because they are not very smart.\n\nMainstream geneticists have rejected their work as biased and unscientific. Yet by relying on genetic and other personal data from the prominent project, known as the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study, the researchers gave their theories an air of analytical rigor.\n\nMembers of the research group were ineligible to obtain data from the ABCD project. But one of them gained access through an American professor who was already being investigated by the N.I.H. over his handling of another child brain study.\n\nTheir papers have provided fodder for racist posts on social media and white nationalist message boards that have been viewed millions of times. Some of the papers are cited by A.I. bots like ChatGPT and Grok in response to queries about race and intelligence. On the social media platform X, Grok has referred users to the research more than two dozen times this month alone.\n\n“It’s evil,” said Dr. Terry L. Jernigan, national co-director of the ABCD Study and a neuropsychologist at the University of California, San Diego. “It’s not just that the science is faulty, but it’s being used to advance an unethical agenda.”\n\nThe misuse of the children’s data has validated longstanding concerns that hundreds of thousands of Americans’ genetic information held by the N.I.H. could fall into the wrong hands. The agency grants widespread access to stimulate new medical discoveries. But critics say the N.I.H. has failed to address the risks that the data, even with personally identifiable details removed, could be misused in unethical research, for commercial purposes or by foreign adversaries.\n\nAt least 63 times since 2007, data from some of the 28 human genomic repositories that the N.I.H. controls was improperly released to researchers, used for unapproved purposes or made vulnerable to theft, according to government records reviewed by The New York Times. In dozens of cases, the N.I.H. suspended researchers’ access and demanded that compromised data be destroyed, but the agency relies heavily on good-faith pledges of compliance.\n\nThe misuse of the data for so-called race science is not the only example of a security failure involving the ABCD Study.\n\nThe Times learned that in 2024, the same data was improperly obtained by an unidentified researcher in China. The data is not allowed to be shared with people in adversarial countries that could use it for blackmail, spy recruitment or military purposes. But the researcher evaded that prohibition by faking an affiliation with an American university, according to a former N.I.H. official and Dr. Jernigan, who said the agency informed her of the incident.\n\nThere has been no official public accounting of how the N.I.H. lost control of the children’s genetic information. The Chronicle of Higher Education in 2022 reported on the mishandling of data from another child brain study by the same American professor, Bryan J. Pesta, who also obtained the ABCD information. But details about the subsequent loss and abuse of the ABCD data have not been previously reported.\n\nToday, the data continues to be twisted to advance an ideological agenda.\n\nWhen Elon Musk invited X users last June to post politically incorrect “divisive facts” on the social network, one of Dr. Pesta’s collaborators — Jordan Lasker, who often writes about race and intelligence under the name Crémieux — replied with a criticism of affirmative action and said white people had bigger brains than Black people. The post, viewed 670,000 times, included a chart that purported to support his claim about brain size and cited the ABCD Study as its data source.\n\nThe conservative commentator Dinesh D’Souza said on X in 2023 that studies showed that Black people, “who are the rock-solid base of the Democratic Party, have the lowest IQ of any ethnic group.” As evidence, he reposted another chart by Mr. Lasker based on ABCD data about American 10-year-olds.\n\nScientists said the unauthorized use of the data underscored the need for stronger controls. Several families in the ABCD Study said in interviews that they were not told about the misuse of the information and never would have agreed to participate had they known it could be used to promote racial division.\n\nKevin Bird, a geneticist who complained to the N.I.H. about Dr. Pesta, said the data was made vulnerable because “our scientific institutions sort of assume good faith in people.”\n\n“There needs to be an acknowledgment that there are bad-faith researchers,” he said. “The rules and regulations need to catch up with that.”\n\nIn a statement, Lyric Jorgenson, associate director of science policy at the N.I.H., said the agency had taken steps to protect the ABCD Study. It has introduced a new online portal requiring users to complete training on responsible data use and to “pass a knowledge test prior to accessing the data.”\n\nIn response to the fraudulent access by a Chinese researcher, she said, the N.I.H. “made enhancements that will prevent this type of incident” from happening again.\n\n“N.I.H. has a longstanding commitment to make the results of N.I.H.-funded research available,” she said, noting that it has approved more than 92,000 access requests since 2007. “At the same time, N.I.H. takes the protection of all human data very seriously and has numerous safeguards in place.”\n\nBut the Government Accountability Office, a federal watchdog, reported last April that the N.I.H. did not have the resources to properly monitor all the downloads of genetic data and “may be missing violations that go unreported by researchers.”\n\nThe data that Dr. Pesta obtained came from two studies. In the nationwide ABCD Study, more than 11,000 children underwent regular M.R.I.s and clinical tests and had DNA samples taken from their blood or saliva. In a separate study, known as the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort, researchers at the University of Pennsylvania collected similar information from about 9,500 children.\n\nData from the projects has generated hundreds of papers on, among other things, the effects of social media on mental health, genetic links to addiction and the causes of sleep disorders.\n\nThe data is maintained by the N.I.H. To gain access, researchers must be tenure-track professors or senior scientists with authorization from their institutions. They also must detail what they plan to do with the information. The N.I.H. can reject proposals that fall outside its guidelines.\n\nThe agency discourages “stigmatizing research” that could promote “negative stereotypes” or cause “social detriment.” That is, in part, a nod to eugenics, a discredited field of research asserting that certain races, usually white Europeans, are genetically superior. Such ideas — and the pseudoscientific studies that support them — have been used to justify violence, including by the gunman who killed 10 Black people at a supermarket in Buffalo in 2022.\n\nIn April 2018, Dr. Pesta, who at the time was a management professor at Cleveland State University, submitted a proposal to the N.I.H. He said he was researching differences in brain size and cognitive abilities in men and women and wanted access to data from the Philadelphia study.\n\nEmails unearthed in a lawsuit that Dr. Pesta later brought against the university show that he had been working with a group of race researchers who coached him on how to apply for access. One of them was John G.R. Fuerst, a graduate student from North Carolina. In a March 2018 email, he told Dr. Pesta that focusing on gender differences would be “a sneaky way” to get the data to also study disparities in intelligence between races — a topic the group believed the N.I.H. would not greenlight.\n\nGot a confidential news tip? The New York Times would like to hear from readers who want to share messages and materials with our journalists.\n\nThough Dr. Pesta later submitted updates on further research he wanted to do, none explicitly described the group’s true intentions, according to court records. The legal filings also show that another group member, Emil O.W. Kirkegaard, a right-wing blogger in Denmark, suggested Dr. Pesta submit misleading proposals to gain access to additional data sets.\n\n“I reckon that if we mask the nature of the study with usual medical terms, one can ‘get away with’ a lot,” Mr. Kirkegaard wrote in an email. “Getting samples for analyses that one doesn’t publish (to preserve your reputation!) are still useful because they allow us to validate our beliefs privately.”\n\nIn an interview, Dr. Pesta denied misleading the N.I.H. and defended his work. “I am not a eugenicist,” he said.\n\nDr. Pesta’s collaborators had a history of scrounging for data to support their fringe theories and of using unreliable methodologies.\n\nIn a 2023 paper, Mr. Fuerst tried to rank the intelligence of children across ethnic groups. But the sample size for the vast majority of groups was far too small to draw meaningful conclusions.\n\nEthnic/National group N ▼ Black African 59 Asian Indian 53 Other Asian 52 Black Caribbean 51 Filipino 51 N. Africa & Mid. East 47 White & Asian Indian 44 Native American 39 Dominican 38 Korean & Japanese 33 Other Cuban 30 White & Pacific Islander 25 Vietnamese 24 Pacific Islander 17\n\nThe paper also invented a category, “USA Black,” excluding Black children with Hispanic or white heritage and an immigrant parent or grandparent. Furthermore, the race of participants was self-reported, a potentially inconsistent gauge of ancestry.\n\nEthnic/National group Definition Pacific Islander not Hispanic & not White & Pacific Islander USA Black not Hispanic & not White & Black & non-immigrant family Vietnamese not Hispanic & not White & Vietnamese\n\nMr. Kirkegaard has published dozens of pieces in Mankind Quarterly, a journal known for pushing race science. He has studied penis sizes by race and once looked for correlations between intelligence and first names, concluding that people with “non-western Muslim names” had lower I.Q.s. Authorities in Britain blocked Mr. Kirkegaard and his European colleagues from the country’s repository of genetic data because they were “not bona fide researchers,” The Guardian reported in 2024.\n\nAnother member of Dr. Pesta’s group was Mr. Lasker, whose frequent posts online mix data analysis with ideological barbs. He dismissed Supreme Court Justices Ketanji Brown Jackson and Sonia Sotomayor as “clearly incompetent” affirmative-action hires. (During the campaign for New York City mayor, Mr. Lasker also shared hacked data with The Times showing that Zohran Mamdani had identified as “Black or African American” on a college application.)\n\nTo finance their research, Dr. Pesta and Mr. Fuerst, the North Carolina graduate student, set up a foundation that received tens of thousands of dollars from the Pioneer Fund, which has a history of promoting eugenics-related research and race science. The fund’s president at the time once wrote approvingly about the idea of “phasing out” incompetent cultures by withholding foreign aid and banning migrants “of low genetic quality.”\n\nThe N.I.H. approved Dr. Pesta’s access to the Philadelphia data, which he and Mr. Fuerst analyzed on a computer in Dr. Pesta’s home, according to a transcript of his interview with university investigators. Dr. Pesta also told them that he had uploaded the data, without N.I.H. approval, to a foreign DNA lab to try to determine the skin color of children in the study.\n\nIn August 2019, Dr. Pesta, Mr. Fuerst, Mr. Kirkegaard and Mr. Lasker produced an analysis of the Philadelphia data. Their paper — which appeared in Psych, an online journal that Dr. Pesta edited — had nothing to do with gender differences and brain size, the topic for which Dr. Pesta had initially obtained the data. Instead, it declared that among people of mixed race, those with greater European ancestry were more intelligent, and that genes were probably the reason.\n\n“These results provide support for a hereditarian model,” they wrote.\n\nThe “hereditarian model” is the belief that intelligence is largely inherited and not a result of environmental factors. Race science broadens the theory across ancestral groups, asserting that people with a European background tend to perform better than African Americans on I.Q. tests because they are innately smarter, a view embraced by white supremacists.\n\nThis runs counter to the scientific consensus that any correlation between a complex trait like intelligence and genes, let alone social constructs like race, is not the same as causation.\n\nResearch has found that the environment in which people are raised can affect their cognitive abilities. In the United States, for example, any serious analysis must consider how Black people endured centuries of slavery and racial discrimination and how they today face disproportionately high poverty rates and a lack of quality education and health care.\n\nBut Dr. Pesta and his colleagues did not focus on that.\n\nThe authors of this paper admitted that the only socioeconomic information available in the Philadelphia data was the education levels of the children’s parents. Their study didn't consider factors like family income and employment that can affect racial I.Q. gaps.\n\n2.2. Parental Socioeconomic Status\n\nOnly paternal and maternal education were available to us as measures of SES. We coded parental education as the average of each, both z-scored first. When data were only available from one parent this value was used. The final score was then z-scored again.\n\nThe Philadelphia data did not include information on skin, eye or hair color of the children, so Dr. Pesta tried to predict those traits by uploading the genetic data to an unapproved, foreign DNA lab — contributing to sanctions against him from the N.I.H.\n\n2.5. Skin, Hair, and Eye Color\n\nThe data did not include measures of appearance, so we opted to impute these based on genotypes. We used the HIrisPlex-S web application to do this. This application was developed by the U.S. Department of Justice for use in forensic investigations. It imputes skin, hair, and eye color probabilities with a high degree of accuracy based on 41 SNPs (with overlapping variants; 6 for eye color, 22 for hair color, and 36 for skin color).\n\nDr. Pesta said in the interview that his research was scientifically sound and intended to improve the lives of Black people by determining the cause of I.Q. gaps. Because “I.Q. test scores strongly predict human well-being, and African Americans are on the short end of every well-being stick, I think it’s an important problem,” he said.\n\nMr. Fuerst, Mr. Kirkegaard and Mr. Lasker did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nTheir 2019 paper caused a commotion, with scientists criticizing it for discounting possible nongenetic explanations for the I.Q. gap. Alexander Gusev, a geneticist at Harvard University who has written about the “weaponization of genomic data,” said such an approach was “playacting at doing science.”\n\n“The goal seems to be just to dig through the data and find something that matches a hypothesis about some difference in African Americans versus whites, and then report it without seriously considering any possible caveats,” he said.\n\nDr. Hakon Hakonarson, a geneticist at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, was the co-leader of the study whose data Dr. Pesta used. When the N.I.H. informed him of Dr. Pesta’s paper, Dr. Hakonarson was outraged, saying its conclusions were not supported by the underlying data.\n\n“It’s most unfortunate that the data you submit in good faith gets abused in this sort of way,” Dr. Hakonarson said.\n\nIn September 2019, a month after the paper’s publication, the N.I.H. ordered Dr. Pesta to “immediately cease all work” with the Philadelphia data and began an investigation into his use of it. But about a year later, while the agency was still investigating, it approved Dr. Pesta’s request for the ABCD data. (The N.I.H. did not respond to a question about why.)\n\nIn 2021, before Dr. Pesta published anything based on the ABCD Study, the N.I.H. accused him of misconduct with the Philadelphia data and suspended his access to its repositories for three years. It was the most severe penalty the agency had ever issued. Cleveland State fired him the following year.\n\nDr. Pesta told university investigators that he had destroyed the data as instructed by the N.I.H., but he could not say for certain whether Mr. Fuerst had made a copy from the computer in Dr. Pesta’s home. He said he had distanced himself from Mr. Fuerst, who had “gone a little bit rogue.”\n\nMr. Fuerst and his colleagues have continued to cite the ABCD data. In 2024, for example, they published a book that compiled many of their papers and mentioned the ABCD Study about 200 times. Mr. Fuerst’s co-authors have included other people ineligible to access the data, such as a professor at a state university in Russia and a freelance researcher in China who has publicly acknowledged having “no formal credentials” in intelligence research.\n\nThe papers provide fuel for more forays into race science. Invoking their own previous analyses of the child brain studies, Dr. Pesta, Mr. Kirkegaard and Mr. Fuerst have produced new papers suggesting that Black people earn less than white people because they are less intelligent.\n\nOne of those papers, in turn, was cited in a Substack article last April asserting that Black people’s supposed lack of intelligence was the source of the racial income gap. The article was picked up by an online magazine with tens of thousands of viewers.\n\nAnother paper, coauthored by Mr. Kirkegaard, was limited by what he acknowledged were small sample sizes and a lack of nongenetic data. Those shortcomings did not stop him from trumpeting the findings online as proof that “genetic ancestry, not social race, explains observed gaps in social status.”\n\nThe scientists leading the ABCD Study decided not to tell participants that their data had been misused for race research.\n\nParents and their children — who are now adults nearing the end of the decade-long study — reacted with surprise and dismay when The Times told them what had happened. They said they deserved to learn about it from the study’s organizers.\n\nScientists said they chose not to inform the families because they believed doing so could cause more harm than good.\n\n“We have struggled with the decision,” said Angela Laird at Florida International University, who helps run the ABCD Study in South Florida.\n\nMany of her study participants are Black and Hispanic and “are really the targets of these racist studies,” Dr. Laird said. “I do believe that if we sat our families down and read them the studies, they would be upset — and in many cases, that is likely an understatement.”\n\nThe organizers of the Philadelphia study didn’t tell families, either. Dr. Hakonarson said that because children’s identities weren’t disclosed, informing parents “was not something that was felt to be needed.”\n\nWhile some scientists have pushed the N.I.H. to limit how sensitive genetic data can be used in research, there is little indication the Trump administration agrees — and there are signs it is moving in the opposite direction.\n\nAdam Candeub, the top lawyer at the Federal Communications Commission, wrote a law review article in 2024 criticizing the N.I.H.’s discouragement of stigmatizing research. He compared it to the persecution of Galileo.\n\n“A liberal society should support the search for truth,” Mr. Candeub wrote, “regardless of how uncomfortable and unsettling that truth turns out to be.”\n\nDr. Pesta has claimed that he faced such persecution. He sued Cleveland State for wrongful termination, saying he was a victim of cancel culture. A federal judge dismissed his lawsuit. He ruled that Dr. Pesta was fired “because of his own misconduct” with the restricted data, not the content of his research. A federal appeals court affirmed the decision in November.\n\nStill, Dr. Pesta and his fellow race researchers have reason for optimism. The pendulum of public policy, Dr. Pesta said, “is swinging in terms of acceptance of even asking the questions.”\n\nA few days after President Trump won the 2024 election, Mr. Kirkegaard happily noted on his website that incoming Vice President JD Vance followed compatriots like Mr. Lasker on social media. His post featured an image of a red “Make Science Great Again” hat.\n\nWithin weeks of Mr. Trump taking office, the N.I.H. made a little-noticed revision to the guidelines on access to a large genetic database. Its description of what constituted stigmatizing research no longer included any reference to skin color, ancestry and ethnicity.\n\nProduced by Tina Zhou and Rumsey Taylor.",

    "fullText": "Misinformation technology could be deployed at scale to disrupt 2028 US presidential election, AI researchers say\n\nPolitical leaders could soon launch swarms of human-imitating AI agents to reshape public opinion in a way that threatens to undermine democracy, a high profile group of experts in AI and online misinformation has warned.\n\nThe Nobel peace prize-winning free-speech activist Maria Ressa, and leading AI and social science researchers from Berkeley, Harvard, Oxford, Cambridge and Yale are among a global consortium flagging the new “disruptive threat” posed by hard-to-detect, malicious “AI swarms” infesting social media and messaging channels.\n\nA would-be autocrat could use such swarms to persuade populations to accept cancelled elections or overturn results, they said, amid predictions the technology could be deployed at scale by the time of the US presidential election in 2028.\n\nThe warnings, published today in Science, come alongside calls for coordinated global action to counter the risk, including “swarm scanners” and watermarked content to counter AI-run misinformation campaigns. Early versions of AI-powered influence operations have been used in the 2024 elections in Taiwan, India and Indonesia.\n\n“A disruptive threat is emerging: swarms of collaborative, malicious AI agents,” the authors said. “These systems are capable of coordinating autonomously, infiltrating communities and fabricating consensus efficiently. By adaptively mimicking human social dynamics, they threaten democracy.”\n\nOne leading expert in propaganda technology, Inga Trauthig, said the adoption of such advanced technology is likely to be slowed by politicians’ reluctance to cede campaign control to AIs. Another cause for skepticism is concern that using such illicit techniques would not be worth the risk, given voters are still more influenced by offline material.\n\nThe experts behind the warning include New York University’s Gary Marcus, a prominent sceptic about the claimed potential of current AI models who calls himself a “generative AI realist”, and Audrey Tang, Taiwan’s first digital minister, who has warned: “Those in the pay of authoritarian forces are undermining electoral processes, weaponizing AI and employing our societal strengths against us.”\n\nOthers include David Garcia, professor for social and behavioural data science at the University of Konstanz, Sander van der Linden, a misinformation expert and director of Cambridge University’s social decision-making lab, and Christopher Summerfield, AI researcher and professor of cognitive neuroscience at Oxford University.\n\nTogether they say political leaders could deploy almost limitless numbers of AIs to masquerade as humans online and precisely infiltrate communities, learn their foibles over time and use increasingly convincing and carefully tailored falsehoods, to change population-wide opinions.\n\nThe threat is being supercharged by advances in AIs’ ability to pick up on the tone and content of discourse. They are increasingly able to mimic human dynamics, for example, by using appropriate slang and posting irregularly to avoid detection. Progress in the development of “agentic” AI also means the ability to autonomously plan and coordinate action.\n\nAs well as operating across social media, they may use messaging channels and even write blogs or use email, depending on which channel the AI thinks best helps achieve an aim, said one of the authors, Daniel Thilo Schroeder, a research scientist at the Sintef research institute in Oslo.\n\n“It’s just frightening how easy these things are to vibe code and just have small bot armies that can actually navigate online social media platforms and email and use these tools,” said Schroeder, who has been simulating swarms in laboratory conditions.\n\nAnother of the authors, Jonas Kunst, professor of communication at the BI Norwegian Business School, said: “If these bots start to evolve into a collective and exchange information to solve a problem – in this case a malicious goal, namely analysing a community and finding a weak spot – then coordination will increase their accuracy and efficiency.\n\n“That is a really serious threat that we predict is going to materialise.”\n\nIn Taiwan, where voters are regularly targeted by Chinese propaganda, often unknowingly, AI bots have been increasing engagement with citizens on Threads and Facebook in the last two to three months, said Puma Shen, a Taiwanese Democratic Progressive Party MP and campaigner against Chinese disinformation.\n\nDuring discussions on political topics the AIs tend to provide “tonnes of information that you cannot verify”, creating “information overload”, Shen said. He said AIs might cite fake articles about how America will abandon Taiwan. Another recent trend is for the AI bots to stress to younger Taiwanese people that the China-Taiwan dispute is very complicated “so do not take sides if you have no knowledge”.\n\n“It’s not telling you that China’s great, but it’s [encouraging them] to be neutral,” Shen told the Guardian. “This is very dangerous, because then you think people like me are radical.”\n\nAmid signs the progress of AI technology is not as rapid as Silicon Valley companies like OpenAI and Anthropic have claimed, the Guardian asked independent AI experts to assess the swarm warnings.\n\n“In the election-heavy year of 2024 the capabilities were there for AI-driven microtargeting but we didn’t see as much of that as scholars predicted,” said Trauthig, an adviser to the International Panel on the Information Environment. “Most political propagandists I interview are still using older technologies and are not at this cutting edge.”\n\n“It isn’t fanciful,” said Michael Wooldridge, professor of the foundations of AI at Oxford University. “I think it is entirely plausible that bad actors will try to mobilise virtual armies of LLM-powered agents to disrupt elections and manipulate public opinion, for example targeting large numbers of individuals on social media and other electronic media. It’s technologically perfectly feasible … the technology has got progressively better and much more accessible.”\n\nThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.\n\nIf you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.\n\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\n\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

    "fullText": "James Cameron says he had talked about moving to New Zealand for years before finally following through in 2020.\n\nOn Wednesday's episode of \"In Depth with Graham Bensinger,\" the filmmaker said he first fell in love with the country in the '90s, but the US response to the pandemic ultimately pushed him to make the move.\n\n\"I went to New Zealand for the first time in '94. I was on my way to the South Pole, and we wound up getting stuck there because the flights were grounded because of ice conditions,\" Cameron, 71, told podcast host Graham Bensinger.\n\nThe flight delay gave him time to explore the Christchurch area, and he ended up falling in love \"with the country, the scenery, the people, the kind of way of life there,\" he said.\n\n\"I made myself a promise. I'm going to come live here someday,\" he said.\n\nCameron added that when he and his now-wife, Susie, were first getting serious, she was also open to the idea of eventually moving to New Zealand. However, life got in the way as they went on to have kids and settled down in Malibu and Santa Barbara.\n\n\"That conversation, you know, had to be amended slightly, but we did say, you know, after 'Avatar,' let's make this happen,\" Cameron said.\n\nThe couple bought a farm in New Zealand in 2011 and spent years traveling back and forth between the two countries.\n\n\"We were shooting in New Zealand. We came back for Christmas, then COVID-19 hit, and we didn't get back down there,\" Cameron said. \"So then I had to move mountains to get our production unit back up and running in New Zealand, and we just decided at that point in time that it was time to make the move as a family.\"\n\n\"This is why I love New Zealand. People there are, for the most part, sane as opposed to the United States,\" he said, pointing to what he described as stark differences in attitudes toward vaccines and public health.\n\n\"Are you kidding me? Where would you rather live?\" Cameron said. \"A place that actually believes in science, and is sane, and where people can work together cohesively to a common goal, or a place where everybody's at each other's throats, extremely polarized, turning its back on science, and basically would be in utter disarray if another pandemic appears?\"\n\nWhen Bensinger said New Zealand had beautiful natural landscapes, Cameron replied, \"I'm not there for the scenery. I'm there for the sanity.\"\n\nIn February, the filmmaker told New Zealand outlet Stuff that the US under Donald Trump was \"a turn away from everything decent.\"\n\n\"There's something nice about the New Zealand outlets — at least they'll put it on page three. I just don't want to see that guy's face anymore on the front page of the paper. It's inescapable there, it's like watching a car crash over and over and over,\" he said.\n\nCameron was granted New Zealand citizenship in August, a spokesperson for the filmmaker told The New Zealand Herald.\n\nHe isn't the only Hollywood celebrity who has left the US for political reasons.\n\nRosie O'Donnell said in a TikTok video in March that she moved from the US to Ireland with her youngest daughter just days before Trump's inauguration.\n\n\"I miss many things about life there at home, and I'm trying to find a home here in this beautiful country,\" she said. \"And when it is safe for all citizens to have equal rights there, in America, that's when we will consider coming back.\"\n\nDuring a July public appearance at a theater in the UK, Ellen DeGeneres said she and Portia de Rossi moved to England following the 2024 election results.\n\n\"We got here the day before the election and woke up to lots of texts from our friends with crying emojis, and I was like, 'He got in.' And we're like, 'We're staying here,'\" she said, per the BBC.",

    "fullText": "A series of graphics reveals how the Trump administration has sought historic cuts to science and the research workforce.\n\nGrant termination data analysis and visualization by Kim Albrecht\n\nMMore than 7,800 research grants terminated or frozen. Some 25,000 scientists and personnel gone from agencies that oversee research. Proposed budget cuts of 35% — amounting to US$32 billion.\n\nThese are just a few of the ways in which Donald Trump has downsized and disrupted US science since returning to the White House last January. As his administration seeks to reshape US research and development, it has substantially scaled back and restricted what science the country pursues and the workforce that runs the federal scientific enterprise.\n\nA year into Trump’s second presidential term, Nature presents a series of graphics that reveal the impact of his administration on science.\n\nIn an unprecedented move, officials began terminating already-funded grants at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in February, and later at the National Science Foundation (NSF), two of the largest public supporters of scientific research in the United States. A total of 5,844 NIH grants and 1,996 NSF grants were cancelled or suspended.\n\nThe Trump administration disproportionally cancelled or froze projects on topics it disfavours, such as misinformation, vaccine hesitancy, infectious diseases and research on people from under-represented ethnic and gender groups, which it has called discriminatory and unscientific.\n\nOver the course of 2025, more than 7,800 grants were cancelled or suspended. In this tree map, each block represents one grant or grant supplement, and the size of the block corresponds to the total budget of the original grant.\n\nThe inclusion of supplements means that some grants — less than 0.5% of the total — appear two or three times.\n\nThe blocks are grouped by state. New York (orange) had the most cancelled or frozen grants, totalling nearly 1,500. The majority were at Columbia University.\n\nSome of the largest grants (orange) are for clinical trials, cancer centres and infrastructure, and they can run over many years.\n\nThe NIH terminated or froze 5,843 research grants (yellow). The total for the NSF was 1,996 (blue).\n\nOf the grants that were terminated or frozen, more than 800 were related to infectious diseases (orange).\n\nCourts have ordered that thousands of grants be reinstated, and some universities have settled with the government to unfreeze funding (both reinstated and unfrozen grants are shown in blue). But it is unclear how many scientists have received those funds.\n\nRoughly 2,600 grants have not been reinstated or unfrozen (black), amounting to $1.4 billion of unspent funding.\n\nThe Trump administration has substantially reduced the number of new grants issued by the NSF and the NIH, which means that fewer researchers are getting support.\n\nIn 2025, the total number of new grants funded by the NSF dropped by 25% relative to the average of the previous ten years. In part, this resulted from uncertainty about future funding, and the agency’s decision to provide multi-year funding — in which a project’s budget is awarded all at once, rather than year by year.\n\nA similar story played out at the NIH, which issued 24% fewer grants in 2025, compared with the average of the previous ten years. After delays early in the year and with reduced staff levels, the agency raced to award grants by the end of the fiscal year. It achieved this in part by providing multi-year funding to a smaller number of new grant applications than usual — sharply reducing the number of scientists that received support.\n\nDuring the 2025–26 academic year, new international-student enrolment at US universities fell markedly. The Institute of International Education (IIE), a non-profit organization in New York City, released preliminary data, based on a subset of universities, showing a 17% decline from 2024 to 2025. This would result in the smallest number of new international enrolments in a decade, except for in 2020–21, during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThese trends are not uniform. An IIE survey found that about 60% of colleges and universities saw decreases, whereas 40% reported stable or increasing numbers. Of those experiencing declines, 96% cited visa-application concerns as a contributing factor. These concerns have intensified under the second Trump administration.\n\nIn total, federal science agencies lost about 20% of their staff in 2025 relative to the previous year, after modest increases over the past few years.\n\nAmong the hardest hit are the Environmental Protection Agency and NASA, both of which have been targets of the Trump administration’s attacks on climate science. The Food and Drug Administration also lost more than 20% of its staff.\n\nSome employees were fired during mass layoffs in early 2025, but most left voluntarily through a programme that offered incentives for federal workers to resign. Across the science agencies, there was an exodus of more than 25,000 people, many of whom were at early career stages.\n\nRemaining staff members at agencies such as the NIH and the NSF say they struggle to keep up with the workload, which includes approving research grants.\n\nIn its proposed budget for the 2026 fiscal year, the Trump administration requested historic cuts of 35% to the budget for research and development not related to defence. The final funding levels will be determined through spending bills passed by the House of Representatives and the Senate in an ongoing process.\n\nAfter adjusting for inflation, the president’s proposed decrease in funding for non-defence research would be unprecedented over the past half century and would reduce spending to 1991 levels.\n\nBut in enacted spending bills, lawmakers in both the Senate and the House of Representatives have so far rejected the most drastic budget cuts for many of the core science agencies. Policy experts hope that Congress will continue its long-standing support for science agencies when it finalizes the 2026 budget in the coming weeks.\n\nThe Trump administration shocked the science community when it proposed slashing more than $18 billion, or around 40% of the total, from the budget of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), which is the largest funder of biomedical research in the world.\n\nThe Trump administration also sought steep cuts at the National Science Foundation (57%) and NASA’s Science Mission Directorate (47%). In final budget agreements that are likely to be adopted by the House and the Senate, lawmakers agreed on much smaller cuts of 3.4% for the NSF and 1.1% for NASA’s science directorate.\n\nThe House and the Senate must finish negotiating final budgets for the remaining agencies, such as the NIH, and the actual funding levels will probably be somewhere in the middle. That would mostly protect the country’s total budget for research and development from the Trump administration’s drastic cuts for the current fiscal year.\n\nThis article is also available as a pdf version.",

    "fullText": "Sometimes science can be painfully slow. Data comes in dribs and drabs, truth trickles, and veracity proves viscous.\n\nThe world's longest-running lab experiment is an ongoing work in sheer scientific patience. It has been running continuously for nearly a century, under the close supervision of several custodians and many spectators – and it's ever so slowly drip, drip, dripping away.\n\nIt all started in 1927, when physicist Thomas Parnell at the University of Queensland in Australia filled a closed funnel with the world's thickest known fluid: pitch, a derivative of tar that was once used to seal ships against the seas.\n\nThree years later, in 1930, Parnell cut the funnel's stem, like a ribbon at an event, heralding the start of the Pitch Drop Experiment. From then on, the black substance began to flow.\n\nAt least, that is, in a manner of speaking. At room temperature pitch might look solid, but it is actually a fluid 100 billion times more viscous than water.\n\nIt took eight years for the first droplet to finally hit the beaker below. Then, they dripped at a cadence of once every eight years or so, slowing down only after air conditioning was installed in the building in the 1980s.\n\nToday, 96 years after the funnel was cut, only nine drops in total have seeped out. The last was in 2014.\n\nScientists expect another will fall sometime in the 2020s, but they are still waiting.\n\nNo one has ever actually seen a droplet fall directly, despite all the watchful eyes. The experiment is now live-streamed, but various glitches in the past meant that each fateful moment has slipped us by.\n\nAfter Parnell, fellow physicist John Mainstone took over caretaking duties in 1961. Sadly, both died without ever seeing a droplet fall with their own two eyes.\n\nMainstone was custodian for 52 years. In 2000, he missed a drop because a thunderstorm disrupted the live feed. He passed away just a few months before the next drop oozed out in April 2014.\n\nPhysics professor Andrew White is the third and current custodian of the pitch drop experiment, keeping vigil for the long-awaited 10th drop.\n\nThe world's longest-running lab experiment has barely begun.",

    "fullText": "I am a science-fiction writer, which means that my job is to make up futuristic parables about our current techno-social arrangements to interrogate not just what a gadget does, but who it does it for, and who it does it to.\n\nWhat I do not do is predict the future. No one can predict the future, which is a good thing, since if the future were predictable, that would mean we couldn’t change it.\n\nNow, not everyone understands the distinction. They think science-fiction writers are oracles. Even some of my colleagues labor under the delusion that we can “see the future”.\n\nThen there are science-fiction fans who believe that they are reading the future. A depressing number of those people appear to have become AI bros. These guys can’t shut up about the day that their spicy autocomplete machine will wake up and turn us all into paperclips has led many confused journalists and conference organizers to try to get me to comment on the future of AI.\n\nThat’s something I used to strenuously resist doing, because I wasted two years of my life explaining patiently and repeatedly why I thought crypto was stupid, and getting relentlessly bollocked by cryptocurrency cultists who at first insisted that I just didn’t understand crypto. And then, when I made it clear that I did understand crypto, they insisted that I must be a paid shill.\n\nThis is literally what happens when you argue with Scientologists, and life is just too short. That said, people would not stop asking – so I’m going to explain what I think about AI and how to be a good AI critic. By which I mean: “How to be a critic whose criticism inflicts maximum damage on the parts of AI that are doing the most harm.”\n\nIn automation theory, a “centaur” is a person who is assisted by a machine. Driving a car makes you a centaur, and so does using autocomplete.\n\nA reverse centaur is a machine head on a human body, a person who is serving as a squishy meat appendage for an uncaring machine.\n\nFor example, an Amazon delivery driver, who sits in a cabin surrounded by AI cameras that monitor the driver’s eyes and take points off if the driver looks in a proscribed direction, and monitors the driver’s mouth because singing is not allowed on the job, and rats the driver out to the boss if they do not make quota.\n\nThe driver is in that van because the van cannot drive itself and cannot get a parcel from the curb to your porch. The driver is a peripheral for a van, and the van drives the driver, at superhuman speed, demanding superhuman endurance.\n\nObviously, it’s nice to be a centaur, and it’s horrible to be a reverse centaur. There are lots of AI tools that are potentially very centaurlike, but my thesis is that these tools are created and funded for the express purpose of creating reverse centaurs, which none of us want to be.\n\nBut like I said, the job of a science-fiction writer is to do more than think about what the gadget does, and drill down on who the gadget does it for and who the gadget does it to. Tech bosses want us to believe that there is only one way a technology can be used. Mark Zuckerberg wants you to think that it is technologically impossible to have a conversation with a friend without him listening in. Tim Cook wants you to think that it is impossible for you to have a reliable computing experience unless he gets a veto over which software you install and without him taking 30 cents out of every dollar you spend. Sundar Pichai wants you to think that it is for you to find a webpage unless he gets to spy on you from asshole to appetite.\n\nThis is all a kind of vulgar Thatcherism. Margaret Thatcher’s mantra was: “There is no alternative.” She repeated this so often they called her “Tina” Thatcher: There. Is. No. Alternative.\n\n“There is no alternative” is a cheap rhetorical slight. It’s a demand dressed up as an observation. “There is no alternative” means: “stop trying to think of an alternative.”\n\nI’m a science-fiction writer – my job is to think of a dozen alternatives before breakfast.\n\nSo let me explain what I think is going on here with this AI bubble and who the reverse-centaur army is serving, and sort out the bullshit from the material reality.\n\nStart with monopolies: tech companies are gigantic and they don’t compete, they just take over whole sectors, either on their own or in cartels.\n\nGoogle and Meta control the ad market. Google and Apple control the mobile market, and Google pays Apple more than $20bn a year not to make a competing search engine, and of course, Google has a 90% search market share.\n\nNow, you would think that this was good news for the tech companies, owning their whole sector.\n\nBut it’s actually a crisis. You see, when a company is growing, it is a “growth stock”, and investors really like growth stocks. When you buy a share in a growth stock, you are making a bet that it will continue to grow. So growth stocks trade at a huge multiple of their earnings. This is called the “price to earnings ratio” or “PE ratio”.\n\nBut once a company stops growing, it is a “mature” stock, and it trades at a much lower PE ratio. So for every dollar that Target – a mature company – brings in, it is worth $10. It has a PE ratio of 10, while Amazon has a PE ratio of 36, which means that for every dollar Amazon brings in, the market values it at $36.\n\nIt’s wonderful to run a company that has a growth stock. Your shares are as good as money. If you want to buy another company or hire a key worker, you can offer stock instead of cash. And stock is very easy for companies to get, because shares are manufactured right there on the premises, all you have to do is type some zeros into a spreadsheet, while dollars are much harder to come by. A company can only get dollars from customers or creditors.\n\nSo when Amazon bids against Target for a key acquisition or a key hire, Amazon can bid with shares they make by typing zeros into a spreadsheet, and Target can only bid with dollars they get from selling stuff to us or taking out loans, which is why Amazon generally wins those bidding wars.\n\nThat’s the upside of having a growth stock. But here is the downside: eventually a company has to stop growing. Like, say you get a 90% market share in your sector, how are you going to grow?\n\nIf you are an exec at a dominant company with a growth stock, you have to live in constant fear that the market will decide that you are not likely to grow any further. Think of what happened to Facebook in the first quarter of 2022. They told investors that they experienced slightly slower growth in the US than they had anticipated, and investors panicked. They staged a one-day, $240bn sell-off. A quarter-trillion dollars in 24 hours! At the time, it was the largest, most precipitous drop in corporate valuation in human history.\n\nThat’s a monopolist’s worst nightmare, because once you’re presiding over a “mature” firm, the key employees you have been compensating with stock experience a precipitous pay drop and bolt for the exits, so you lose the people who might help you grow again, and you can only hire their replacements with dollars – not shares.\n\nThis is the paradox of the growth stock. While you are growing to domination, the market loves you, but once you achieve dominance, the market lops 75% or more off your value in a single stroke if they do not trust your pricing power.\n\nWhich is why growth-stock companies are always desperately pumping up one bubble or another, spending billions to hype the pivot to video or cryptocurrency or NFTs or the metaverse or AI.\n\nI am not saying that tech bosses are making bets they do not plan on winning. But winning the bet – creating a viable metaverse – is the secondary goal. The primary goal is to keep the market convinced that your company will continue to grow, and to remain convinced until the next bubble comes along.\n\nSo this is why they’re hyping AI: the material basis for the hundreds of billions in AI investment.\n\nNow I want to talk about how they’re selling AI. The growth narrative of AI is that AI will disrupt labor markets. I use “disrupt” here in its most disreputable tech-bro sense.\n\nThe promise of AI – the promise AI companies make to investors – is that there will be AI that can do your job, and when your boss fires you and replaces you with AI, he will keep half of your salary for himself and give the other half to the AI company.\n\nThat is the $13tn growth story that Morgan Stanley is telling. It’s why big investors are giving AI companies hundreds of billions of dollars. And because they are piling in, normies are also getting sucked in, risking their retirement savings and their family’s financial security.\n\nNow, if AI could do your job, this would still be a problem. We would have to figure out what to do with all these unemployed people.\n\nBut AI can’t do your job. It can help you do your job, but that does not mean it is going to save anyone money.\n\nTake radiology: there is some evidence that AI can sometimes identify solid-mass tumors that some radiologists miss. Look, I’ve got cancer. Thankfully, it’s very treatable, but I’ve got an interest in radiology being as reliable and accurate as possible.\n\nLet’s say my hospital bought some AI radiology tools and told its radiologists: “Hey folks, here’s the deal. Today, you’re processing about 100 X-rays per day. From now on, we’re going to get an instantaneous second opinion from the AI, and if the AI thinks you’ve missed a tumor, we want you to go back and have another look, even if that means you’re only processing 98 X-rays per day. That’s fine, we just care about finding all those tumors.”\n\nIf that’s what they said, I’d be delighted. But no one is investing hundreds of billions in AI companies because they think AI will make radiology more expensive, not even if that also makes radiology more accurate. The market’s bet on AI is that an AI salesman will visit the CEO of Kaiser and make this pitch: “Look, you fire nine out of 10 of your radiologists, saving $20m a year. You give us $10m a year, and you net $10m a year, and the remaining radiologists’ job will be to oversee the diagnoses the AI makes at superhuman speed – and somehow remain vigilant as they do so, despite the fact that the AI is usually right, except when it’s catastrophically wrong.\n\n“And if the AI misses a tumor, this will be the human radiologist’s fault, because they are the ‘human in the loop’. It’s their signature on the diagnosis.”\n\nThis is a reverse centaur, and it is a specific kind of reverse centaur: it is what Dan Davies calls an “accountability sink”. The radiologist’s job is not really to oversee the AI’s work, it is to take the blame for the AI’s mistakes.\n\nThis is another key to understanding – and thus deflating – the AI bubble. The AI can’t do your job, but an AI salesman can convince your boss to fire you and replace you with an AI that can’t do your job. This is key because it helps us build the kinds of coalitions that will be successful in the fight against the AI bubble.\n\nIf you are someone who is worried about cancer, and you are being told that the price of making radiology too cheap to meter, is that we are going to have to rehouse America’s 32,000 radiologists, with the trade-off that no one will ever be denied radiology services again, you might say: “Well, OK, I’m sorry for those radiologists, and I fully support getting them job training or UBI or whatever. But the point of radiology is to fight cancer, not to pay radiologists, so I know what side I’m on.”\n\nAI hucksters and their customers in the C-suites want the public on their side. They want to forge a class alliance between AI deployers and the people who enjoy the fruits of the reverse centaurs’ labor. They want us to think of ourselves as enemies to the workers.\n\nNow, some people will be on the workers’ side because of politics or aesthetics. But if you want to win over all the people who benefit from your labor, you need to understand and stress how the products of the AI will be substandard. That they are going to get charged more for worse things. That they have a shared material interest with you.\n\nWill those products be substandard? There is every reason to think so.\n\nThink of AI software generation: there are plenty of coders who love using AI. Using AI for simple tasks can genuinely make them more efficient and give them more time to do the fun part of coding, namely, solving really gnarly, abstract puzzles. But when you listen to business leaders talk about their AI plans for coders, it’s clear they are not hoping to make some centaurs.\n\nThey want to fire a lot of tech workers – 500,000 over the past three years – and make the rest pick up their work with coding, which is only possible if you let the AI do all the gnarly, creative problem solving, and then you do the most boring, soul-crushing part of the job: reviewing the AI’s code.\n\nAnd because AI is just a word-guessing program, because all it does is calculate the most probable word to go next, the errors it makes are especially subtle and hard to spot, because these bugs are nearly indistinguishable from working code.\n\nFor example: programmers routinely use standard “code libraries” to handle routine tasks. Say you want your program to slurp in a document and make some kind of sense of it – find all the addresses, say, or all the credit card numbers. Rather than writing a program to break down a document into its constituent parts, you’ll just grab a library that does it for you.\n\nThese libraries come in families, and they have predictable names. If it’s a library for pulling in an html file, it might be called something like lib.html.text.parsing; and if it’s a for docx file, it’ll be lib.docx.text.parsing.\n\nBut reality is messy, humans are inattentive and stuff goes wrong, so sometimes, there will be another library, say, one for parsing pdfs, and instead of being called lib.pdf.text.parsing, it’s called lib.text.pdf.parsing. Someone just entered an incorrect library name and it stuck. Like I said, the world is messy.\n\nNow, AI is a statistical inference engine. All it can do is predict what word will come next based on all the words that have been typed in the past. That means that it will “hallucinate” a library called lib.pdf.text.parsing, because that matches the pattern it’s already seen. And the thing is, malicious hackers know that the AI will make this error, so they will go out and create a library with the predictable, hallucinated name, and that library will get automatically sucked into the AI’s program, and it will do things like steal user data or try to penetrate other computers on the same network.\n\nAnd you, the human in the loop – the reverse centaur – you have to spot this subtle, hard-to-find error, this bug that is indistinguishable from correct code. Now, maybe a senior coder could catch this, because they have been around the block a few times, and they know about this tripwire.\n\nBut guess who tech bosses want to preferentially fire and replace with AI? Senior coders. Those mouthy, entitled, extremely highly paid workers, who don’t think of themselves as workers. Who see themselves as founders in waiting, peers of the company’s top management. The kind of coder who would lead a walkout over the company building drone-targeting systems for the Pentagon, which cost Google $10bn in 2018.\n\nFor AI to be valuable, it has to replace high-wage workers, and those are precisely the workers who might spot some of those statistically camouflaged AI errors.\n\nIf you can replace coders with AI, who can’t you replace with AI? Firing coders is an ad for AI.\n\nWhich brings me to AI art – or “art” – which is often used as an ad for AI, even though it is not part of AI’s business model.\n\nLet me explain: on average, illustrators do not make any money. They are already one of the most immiserated, precarious groups of workers out there. If AI image-generators put every illustrator working today out of a job, the resulting wage-bill savings would be undetectable as a proportion of all the costs associated with training and operating image-generators. The total wage bill for commercial illustrators is less than the kombucha bill for the company cafeteria at just one of OpenAI’s campuses.\n\nThe purpose of AI art – and the story of AI art as a death knell for artists – is to convince the broad public that AI is amazing and will do amazing things. It is to create buzz. Which is not to say that it is not disgusting that former OpenAI CTO Mira Murati told a conference audience that “some creative jobs shouldn’t have been there in the first place”.\n\nIt’s supposed to be disgusting. It’s supposed to get artists to run around and say: “The AI can do my job, and it’s going to steal my job, and isn’t that terrible?“\n\nBut can AI do an illustrator’s job? Or any artist’s job?\n\nLet’s think about that for a second. I have been a working artist since I was 17 years old, when I sold my first short story. Here’s what I think art is: it starts with an artist, who has some vast, complex, numinous, irreducible feeling in their mind. And the artist infuses that feeling into some artistic medium. They make a song, a poem, a painting, a drawing, a dance, a book or a photograph. And the idea is, when you experience this work, a facsimile of the big, numinous, irreducible feeling will materialize in your mind.\n\nBut the image-generation program does not know anything about your big, numinous, irreducible feeling. The only thing it knows is whatever you put into your prompt, and those few sentences are diluted across a million pixels or a hundred-thousand words, so that the average communicative density of the resulting work is indistinguishable from zero.\n\nIt is possible to infuse more communicative intent into a work: writing more detailed prompts, or doing the selective work of choosing from among many variants, or directly tinkering with the AI image after the fact, with a paintbrush or Photoshop or the Gimp. And if there will ever be a piece of AI art that is good art – as opposed to merely striking, interesting or an example of good draftsmanship – it will be thanks to those additional infusions of creative intent by a human.\n\nAnd in the meantime, it’s bad art. It’s bad art in the sense of being “eerie”, the word that cultural theorist Mark Fisher used to describe “when there is something present where there should be nothing, or there is nothing present when there should be something”.\n\nAI art is eerie because it seems like there is an intender and an intention behind every word and every pixel, because we have a lifetime of experience that tells us that paintings have painters, and writing has writers. But it is missing something. It has nothing to say, or whatever it has to say is so diluted that it is undetectable.\n\nWe should not simply shrug our shoulders and accept Thatcherism’s fatalism: “There is no alternative.”\n\nSo what is the alternative? A lot of artists and their allies think they have an answer: they say we should extend copyright to cover the activities associated with training a model.\n\nAnd I am here to tell you they are wrong. Wrong because this would represent a massive expansion of copyright over activities that are currently permitted – for good reason. I’ll explain:\n\nAI training involves scraping a bunch of webpages, which is unambiguously legal under present copyright law. Next, you perform analysis on those works. Basically, you count stuff on them: count pixels and their colors and proximity to other pixels; or count words. This is obviously not something you need a license for.\n\nAnd after you count all the pixels or the words, it is time for the final step: publishing them. Because that is what a model is: a literary work (that is, a piece of software) that embodies a bunch of facts about a bunch of other works, word and pixel distribution information, encoded in a multidimensional array.\n\nAnd again, copyright absolutely does not prohibit you from publishing facts about copyrighted works. And again, no one should want to live in a world where someone else gets to decide which factual statements you can publish.\n\nBut hey, maybe you think this is all sophistry. Maybe you think I’m full of shit. That’s fine. It wouldn’t be the first time someone thought that.\n\nAfter all, even if I’m right about how copyright works now, there’s no reason we couldn’t change copyright to ban training activities, and maybe there’s even a clever way to wordsmith the law so that it only catches bad things we don’t like, and not all the good stuff that comes from scraping, analyzing and publishing – such as search engines and academic scholarship.\n\nWell, even then, you’re not gonna help out creators by creating this new copyright. We have monotonically expanded copyright since 1976, so that today, copyright covers more kinds of works, grants exclusive rights over more uses, and lasts longer.\n\nAnd today, the media industry is larger and more profitable than it has ever been, and also – the share of media industry income that goes to creative workers is lower than it has ever been, both in real terms, and as a proportion of those incredible gains made by creators’ bosses at the media company.\n\nIn a creative market dominated by five publishers, four studios, three labels, two mobile app stores, and a single company that controls all the ebooks and audiobooks, giving a creative worker extra rights to bargain with is like giving your bullied kid more lunch money.\n\nIt doesn’t matter how much lunch money you give the kid, the bullies will take it all. Give that kid enough money and the bullies will hire an agency to run a global campaign proclaiming: “Think of the hungry kids! Give them more lunch money!”\n\nCreative workers who cheer on lawsuits by the big studios and labels need to remember the first rule of class warfare: things that are good for your boss are rarely what’s good for you.\n\nA new copyright to train models will not get us a world where models are not used to destroy artists, it will just get us a world where the standard contracts of the handful of companies that control all creative labor markets are updated to require us to hand over those new training rights to those companies. Demanding a new copyright just makes you a useful idiot for your boss.\n\nWhen really what they’re demanding is a world where 30% of the investment capital of the AI companies go into their shareholders’ pockets. When an artist is being devoured by rapacious monopolies, does it matter how they divvy up the meal?\n\nWe need to protect artists from AI predation, not just create a new way for artists to be mad about their impoverishment.\n\nIncredibly enough, there is a really simple way to do that. After more than 20 years of being consistently wrong and terrible for artists’ rights, the US Copyright Office has finally done something gloriously, wonderfully right. All through this AI bubble, the Copyright Office has maintained – correctly – that AI-generated works cannot be copyrighted, because copyright is exclusively for humans. That is why the “monkey selfie” is in the public domain. Copyright is only awarded to works of human creative expression that are fixed in a tangible medium.\n\nAnd not only has the Copyright Office taken this position, they have defended it vigorously in court, repeatedly winning judgments to uphold this principle.\n\nThe fact that every AI-created work is in the public domain means that if Getty or Disney or Universal or Hearst newspapers use AI to generate works – then anyone else can take those works, copy them, sell them or give them away for nothing. And the only thing those companies hate more than paying creative workers, is having other people take their stuff without permission.\n\nThe US Copyright Office’s position means that the only way these companies can get a copyright is to pay humans to do creative work. This is a recipe for centaurhood. If you are a visual artist or writer who uses prompts to come up with ideas or variations, that’s no problem, because the ultimate work comes from you. And if you are a video editor who uses deepfakes to change the eyelines of 200 extras in a crowd scene, then sure, those eyeballs are in the public domain, but the movie stays copyrighted.\n\nBut creative workers do not have to rely on the US government to rescue us from AI predators. We can do it ourselves, the way the writers did in their historic writers’ strike. The writers brought the studios to their knees. They did it because they are organized and solidaristic, but also are allowed to do something that virtually no other workers are allowed to do: they can engage in “sectoral bargaining”, whereby all the workers in a sector can negotiate a contract with every employer in the sector.\n\nThat has been illegal for most workers since the late 1940s, when the Taft-Hartley Act outlawed it. If we are gonna campaign to get a new law passed in hopes of making more money and having more control over our labor, we should campaign to restore sectoral bargaining, not to expand copyright.\n\nAI is a bubble and bubbles are terrible.\n\nBubbles transfer the life savings of normal people who are just trying to have a dignified retirement to the wealthiest and most unethical people in our society, and every bubble eventually bursts, taking their savings with it.\n\nBut not every bubble is created equal. Some bubbles leave behind something productive. Worldcom stole billions from everyday people by defrauding them about orders for fiber optic cables. The CEO went to prison and died there. But the fiber outlived him. It’s still in the ground. At my home, I’ve got 2gb symmetrical fiber, because AT&T lit up some of that old Worldcom dark fiber.\n\nIt would have been better if Worldcom had not ever existed, but the only thing worse than Worldcom committing all that ghastly fraud would be if there was nothing to salvage from the wreckage.\n\nI do not think we will salvage much from cryptocurrency, for example. When crypto dies, what it will leave behind is bad Austrian economics and worse monkey jpegs.\n\nAI is a bubble and it will burst. Most of the companies will fail. Most of the datacenters will be shuttered or sold for parts. So what will be left behind?\n\nWe will have a bunch of coders who are really good at applied statistics. We will have a lot of cheap GPUs, which will be good news for, say, effects artists and climate scientists, who will be able to buy that critical hardware at pennies on the dollar. And we will have the open-source models that run on commodity hardware, AI tools that can do a lot of useful stuff, like transcribing audio and video; describing images; summarizing documents; and automating a lot of labor-intensive graphic editing – such as removing backgrounds or airbrushing passersby out of photos. These will run on our laptops and phones, and open-source hackers will find ways to push them to do things their makers never dreamed of.\n\nIf there had never been an AI bubble, if all this stuff arose merely because computer scientists and product managers noodled around for a few years coming up with cool new apps, most people would have been pleasantly surprised with these interesting new things their computers could do. We would call them “plugins”.\n\nIt’s the bubble that sucks, not these applications. The bubble doesn’t want cheap useful things. It wants expensive, “disruptive” things: big foundation models that lose billions of dollars every year.\n\nWhen the AI-investment mania halts, most of those models are going to disappear, because it just won’t be economical to keep the datacenters running. As Stein’s law has it: “Anything that can’t go on forever eventually stops.”\n\nThe collapse of the AI bubble is going to be ugly. Seven AI companies currently account for more than a third of the stock market, and they endlessly pass around the same $100bn IOU.\n\nAI is the asbestos in the walls of our technological society, stuffed there with wild abandon by a finance sector and tech monopolists run amok. We will be excavating it for a generation or more.\n\nTo pop the bubble, we have to hammer on the forces that created the bubble: the myth that AI can do your job, especially if you get high wages that your boss can claw back; the understanding that growth companies need a succession of ever more outlandish bubbles to stay alive; the fact that workers and the public they serve are on one side of this fight, and bosses and their investors are on the other side.\n\nBecause the AI bubble really is very bad news, it’s worth fighting seriously, and a serious fight against AI strikes at its roots: the material factors fueling the hundreds of billions in wasted capital that are being spent to put us all on the breadline and fill all our walls with hi-tech asbestos.\n\nCory Doctorow is a science fiction author, activist and journalist.

    "fullText": "Patrick Vallance says robots would take away ‘repetitive’ tasks, but Sadiq Khan warns AI will usher in ‘new era of mass unemployment’\n\nAdvances in AI and robotics will transform human jobs, starting with roles in warehouses and factories, the UK science minister has said, as the government announced plans to reduce red tape for robot and defence tech companies.\n\nPatrick Vallance said technological progress was creating a “whole new area” for robots to work in. “What’s really changing now is the combination of AI and robotics. It is opening up a whole new area, particularly in the sorts of things like humanoid robotics. And that will increase productivity, it will change the human job,” he told the Guardian.\n\nLord Vallance spoke as a government unit helping to deploy new technologies in Britain announced robots and defence as new sectors receiving its support.\n\nHe said factories and warehouses, already at the forefront of robot deployment, will undergo further change as a result of the new generation of humanoid robots.\n\n“Activities that require movement around warehouses and factories, or those sorts of things that can be made robotic, will be made robotic. I think they will be made robotic in many cases and therefore, will change the nature of those jobs. That’s going to be the first wave,” he said.\n\nMeanwhile, the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, has warned that AI could “usher in a new era of mass unemployment”.\n\nSpeaking in his annual Mansion House speech on Thursday, Khan said artificial intelligence could destroy a significant amount of jobs in London unless ministers act to help replace jobs taken over by the technology.\n\nAsked to comment on Khan’s speech, Vallance said robots would take away “repetitive” tasks. “You take away some of the things which are less interesting, repetitive things that can be done in another way,” he said.\n\nVallance, formerly the government’s chief scientific adviser, added that the example of robotics assisting in surgery showed how the technology can enhance jobs.\n\n“Robotics is not displacing surgeons, it’s radically improving how those surgeons work and allowing things to be done with more precision,” he said.\n\nThe government announced on Friday that the Regulatory Innovation Office (RIO) is expanding its remit to defence tech and robotics, with the aim of slashing red tape for companies operating in those spaces.\n\nThe Department for Science, Innovation and Technology is also releasing £52m for new hubs to drive robotics adoption in British businesses. These hubs will offer companies advice on using robots and live demonstrations. “The RIO will aim to streamline overlapping requirements to bring products to market safely, but more quickly, to improve lives and grow our economy,” it said.\n\nThe department added that autonomous drones could benefit from the wider RIO remit. Such technology could require separate approvals for aviation, data protection, and sector-specific safety rules, in an expensive process that could take months.\n\nVallance was speaking during a visit to Humanoid, a UK-based robotics company that has already deployed its prototypes in a factory operated by German industrial group Siemens.\n\nAdam Kelsall, Humanoid’s head of product management, said the company welcomed “anything that gets us into the real world and testing [robots] sooner”.",

    "description": "Microplastics are everywhere. We drink them in our water, we eat them in our food, we breathe them in our air, leading to – so we are told – alarming levels of plastic accumulating in our tissues.",
    "fullText": "Microplastics are everywhere. We drink them in our water, we eat them in our food, we breathe them in our air, leading to – so we are told – alarming levels of plastic accumulating in our tissues.\n\nSo it was somewhat of a shock this week when the Guardian published a “bombshell” article suggesting that scientists may be overstating the health concerns. The award-winning journalist Damian Carrington, a champion of green issues, accepted that he himself had warned of the dangers, but said there was mounting concern over the technology used to detect tiny pieces of plastics in the body.\n\nThe article followed a recent letter published in Nature Medicine which questioned the analytical techniques used to detect microplastics in human tissue, warning they lacked controls and validation. One of the signatories, Dr Dusan Materic, of the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research in Germany, argued that fat in the body can give a false positive for polyethylene, and said the obesity epidemic could be behind the perceived rise in bodily plastic.\n\nDr Fazel Monikh, of the University of Padua, Italy, another signatory, who has spent a decade working on the detection of nanomaterials in biological samples, says he has never come across the kinds of microplastics reported in recent studies. “When particulate materials enter a living organism, including the human body, they undergo biotransformation,” he tells The Telegraph.\n\n“Even if one were to assume the highly unlikely scenario in which an intact particle reaches a protected compartment, such as the brain, and is then successfully detected, it would not retain the appearance shown in most of the reported data.\n\n“For these reasons, most of the presented results and their interpretation are not scientifically convincing to me, nor to my colleagues who are experts in this field.”\n\nMicroplastics were first detected in the human body in 2018 when Austrian scientists analysed stool samples of people in eight countries – including Britain – and found every one contained the tiny particles. Such research is not in doubt, and there is good evidence that humans do ingest tens of thousands of plastic particles each year. The sticking point is whether these become embedded in tissues, causing long-term harm.\n\nThe problem seems to lie in the tinier versions of microplastics, known as nanoplastics.\n\nOfficially, microplastics are no larger than 5mm in size (the size of a grain of rice or smaller) whereas nanoplastics are 1nm to 1,000nm in size (as small as bacteria) and are a lot harder to detect. In recent years, studies have claimed to have found these miniscule particles in nearly every human organ and tissue, including the lungs, liver, kidneys, heart, brain, placenta, testicles, bone marrow and blood.\n\nIt is feared that these tiny intruders carry toxic chemicals which cause inflammation and cell damage, as well as disrupting hormones, damaging microbes in the gut, lowering IQ, decreasing fertility and increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer, heart attacks and strokes. The paper which sparked the recent Nature Medicine rebuttal letter claimed to have found microplastics and nanoplastics in the brain, which the scientists behind it linked to dementia.\n\nSuch studies have sparked a wave of eco-anxiety, with people switching to plastic-free tea bags and ditching water bottles, kitchen sponges, polyethylene chopping boards and non-stick saucepans.\n\nBut there are concerns that because microplastics are so prevalent in the environment it is difficult to tease out whether they really are getting into human tissue, or if samples are just contaminated during the process of collecting and analysing them. Lab testing should include “blanks” – control samples of clean water or inert material processed like real samples to detect contamination – but many studies do not.\n\nFay Couceiro, professor of environmental pollution at the University of Portsmouth says: “I don’t think that there is any doubt that there are microplastics in us – they are everywhere and we are breathing and eating them daily, so that they are in us is inevitable.\n\n“I think the question raised is more about where in the body they are stored and what quantity there is.\n\n“Some studies – particularly those based on humans – don’t follow the full standard methodologies used in environmental sampling around blanks, replicates and recovery checks.”\n\nWith large microplastics, scientists can easily spot particles under a microscope and then fire a laser at them to see if they are plastic. But with nanoplastics, scientists must burn the particle and measure the gases emitted, which is less reliable and still in its infancy as a technique.\n\nThis unreliability of testing has made researchers more sceptical about the more alarmist findings. An abstract presented at the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology last year showing microplastics in human reproductive fluids was met with raised eyebrows among scientists.\n\n“Many previous scary-sounding headlines on microplastics in blood and food have turned out to be measurement errors,” warns Oliver Jones, professor of chemistry at RMIT University, Melbourne, referring to reports that preceded last year’s findings.\n\nLikewise, separate claims that microplastics had been found in human blood in 2022 were criticised by a US chemist as being “consistent with incidental or accidental contaminations”, in a letter to the Environmental International journal.\n\nEven Dr Philipp Schwabl, of the Medical University of Vienna, who found the original evidence of microplastics in human bodies is unsure about their health impacts. “The question of how harmful these little foreign plastic bodies truly are remains open to me and thus constitutes a crucial field of environmental biology that remains to be scientifically elucidated,” he says.\n\nYet despite the testing issues, many experts are still convinced microplastics are causing harm.\n\nProf Philip Landrigan, a paediatrician and epidemiologist at Boston College in the US, led a recent review into microplastics for the Lancet, and says people should not dismiss the dangers. “The Guardian article is accurate in pointing out that there is work to be done in refining, standardising and harmonising the analytical techniques for examining microplastics in tissue samples,” he says.\n\n“There is a need especially to distinguish microplastics from lipids [fats]. But the Guardian is wrong in implying that this whole area of science is rubbish.\n\n“The presence of microplastics in the human body needs to be taken seriously, even if we don’t yet know all the ways in which they may harm health. They cannot be wished away.”\n\nThe Medical University of Vienna recently developed a new imaging technique which can detect plastics without needing to burn up samples. They say it reduces contamination risk and allows scientists to find direct correlations between tissue samples and disease.\n\nAnd Dr Matthew Campen, of the University of New Mexico, lead author of the brain study that was challenged in Nature Medicine, said his team had hosted a microplastics conference in the last few days in which “convincing” new evidence had been presented of particles in cerebrospinal fluid. “Our paper is actually very clear on where uncertainties lie and how these may impact the interpretation of results,” he added. “We are 100 per cent confident that nanoplastics are in the brain.”\n\nProf Lukas Kenner, deputy director of the Department of Pathology at the Medical University of Vienna, says: “The concerns raised are understandable but a blanket dismissal of the entire body of evidence is not scientifically justified.\n\n“While early studies certainly had methodological limitations, the field has advanced rapidly.\n\n“There is now good evidence that microplastics can enter and accumulate in the human body, and growing experimental evidence that they are biologically active rather than inert.”\n\nFor now, it seems the scientific community is split on the true impact of microplastics and it may be several years before consensus is reached on the harms. The debate over the extent to which they enter and remain in human bodies will be a key part of those discussions.\n\nWhile some fear that plastics could be the modern-day equivalent of asbestos, lead or tobacco, it may be that the particles are processed or ejected by the body before they do long-term damage.\n\nProf Christian Dunn, an expert in microplastic pollution at Bangor University in Wales, says: “When it comes to nanoplastics I think we’re still pushing the boundaries as to what we can confidently detect.\n\n“The extent of how much of this plastic is entering and accumulating in our organs, and the damage this is doing to us, is still up for scientific discovery.”\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "description": "Computer science professor Roman Yampolskiy says investors are pouring billions into AI because they expect it to deliver \"free labor\" at scale.",
    "fullText": "The soaring valuations of AI companies aren't just a bet on better software.\n\nThey're a wager on who will control human labor in the future, according to Roman Yampolskiy, a University of Louisville computer science professor who was one of the first academics to warn about AI's risks.\n\nAs artificial intelligence moves from tools to increasingly autonomous agents, Yampolskiy said markets are pricing in a radical shift: machines providing \"free labor\" at scale.\n\n\"You go from having tools to having agents with humanlike capability that really represents free labor,\" Yampolskiy told the UK's LBC radio station in a recent interview. \"Free labor — cognitive free labor, physical labor.\"\n\nThat dynamic, he said, helps explain why investors are willing to pay lofty valuations for AI companies even before many of them have established clear business models.\n\n\"If a company valuation is a hundred billion today, it's actually a small bet on having access to that free labor,\" he told LBC.\n\nIn comments later to Business Insider, he said that \"once a model is trained and deployed, copying its capabilities across millions of tasks is mostly compute, not salaries.\"\n\nMarkets, he added, tend to underestimate how abruptly change can arrive.\n\n\"When quality crosses a usability threshold, substitution can be abrupt,\" he said. \"Wage value can collapse faster than institutions can adapt.\"\n\nYampolskiy told LBC that any job performed entirely on a computer is vulnerable to automation; he offered up programming, accounting, tax preparation, and web design as examples.\n\nWhile automation may initially remove only the most tedious tasks, entire roles could disappear over time, he said.\n\n\"In five years, we'll have capability to automate all cognitive labor and a lot of physical labor,\" he said during the interview, pointing to rapid advances in robotics.\n\nWhat makes this technological wave different, Yampolskiy told Business Insider, is that AI targets \"the general substrate of cognitive work itself,\" rather than specific tasks.\n\nPast technologies have created new jobs that require uniquely human skills; this time, he said, the frontier keeps moving.\n\n\"The new categories become automatable shortly after they appear,\" he said.\n\nHe expects adoption to be slowed by regulation, liability, and organizational inertia — but ultimately driven by competitive pressure and cost-cutting.\n\n\"Firms adopt whatever lowers costs and increases speed once reliability is good enough,\" he said.\n\nYampolskiy, who has previously said AI could leave 99% of workers jobless by 2030, joins a growing chorus of AI experts and tech leaders predicting that the technology could wipe out vast swaths of work.\n\nGeoffrey Hinton, the computer scientist known as \"the godfather of AI,\" has said that AI could replace \"many, many jobs\" as early as 2026, while AI pioneer Stuart Russell has warned that societies may face up to 80% unemployment.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang and former Meta AI chief Yann LeCun have said AI will change jobs rather than eliminate them, while executives like JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon and Zoom's Eric Yuan have predicted the technology could reshape work and shorten the workweek instead of erasing employment.\n\nYampolskiy sees a bigger risk. Once societies become dependent on AI as critical infrastructure, he said, slowing down may no longer be a real option.\n\n\"Dependency creates lock-in,\" he told Business Insider.\n\n\"Once AI becomes critical infrastructure,\" he said, \"risk tolerance increases by necessity rather than choice. In that state, control failures become more likely precisely because the option to pause, audit, or roll back is no longer viable.\"",

    "title": "Google’s Sergey Brin admits he’s hiring ‘tons’ of workers without degrees: ‘They just figure things out on their own in some weird corner’",
    "description": "Google cofounder Sergey Brin studied graduate computer science at Stanford—but admits Gen Z no longer needs a degree to land a high-paying job at the tech giant.",
    "fullText": "Whether it’s Nike’s Phil Knight, LinkedIn’s Reid Hoffman, or Google’s Sergey Brin, many of the world’s most influential business founders can trace part of their success back to Stanford University. Nestled in the foothills of Silicon Valley, the school has long functioned as a launchpad for tech’s elite.\n\nBut the rise of artificial intelligence is challenging long-held assumptions about the value of higher education. As tech reshapes entry-level work and companies rethink traditional hiring pipelines, the payoff of a four-year degree—especially from elite institutions—is increasingly up for debate.\n\nStill, Brin doesn’t regret his own academic path. Speaking to Stanford engineering students last month, he said his decision to study computer science was not driven by a fixation on credentials.\n\n“I chose computer science because I had a passion for it,” he said. “It was kind of a no-brainer for me. I guess you could say I was also lucky because I was also in such a transformative field.”\n\nEven in an era when AI can write code, Brin cautioned students against chasing—or abandoning—fields of study based solely on automation fears.\n\n“I wouldn’t go off and switch to comparative literature because you think the AI is good at coding,” he said. “The AI is probably even better at comparative literature, just to be perfectly honest anyway.”\n\nBrin met Google cofounder Larry Page in 1994 during his second year of graduate studies at Stanford. Together they developed PageRank, an algorithm they later renamed Google and would become a company in 1998.\n\nGoogle’s hiring practices today reflect how dramatically the industry has shifted. The tech giant is now embracing workers without college degrees.\n\n“In as much as we’ve hired a lot of academic stars, we’ve hired tons of people who don’t have bachelor’s degrees,” Brin said. “They just figure things out on their own in some weird corner.”\n\nBetween 2017 and 2022, the share of job postings at Google requiring a degree dropped from 93% to 77%, according to analysis from the Burning Glass Institute. And Google isn’t alone: companies including Microsoft, Apple, and Cisco have reduced degree requirements in recent years, signaling a broader industry shift toward skills-based hiring.\n\nThat’s forcing a broader reckoning over what a degree actually signals and whether it’s still a reliable proxy for talent.\n\n“I don’t think necessarily because you go to an Ivy League school or have great grades it means you’re going to be a great worker or great person,” said JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon in 2024. For many roles, skills matter far more than credentials, he added: “If you look at skills of people, it is amazing how skilled people are in something, but it didn’t show up in their resume.”",

    "description": "Little known today, Fitz-James O’Brien deserves serious attention for developing some of science fiction’s most familiar tropes—among them microcosmic worlds, invisible monsters, time slips, and robots.",
    "fullText": "Back in the early 1930s Gilbert Seldes—a literary critic and early champion of popular culture—was asked to contribute an introduction to a volume of stories by Fitz-James O’Brien, now often regarded as the most original American writer of supernatural fiction between Edgar Allan Poe and Ambrose Bierce. At first Seldes declined, confessing that he’d never read anything by the man. But when the publisher jogged his memory, Seldes remembered that in some anthology or another he had in fact come across “The Diamond Lens,” O’Brien’s 1858 account of an obsessive microscopist who discovers an Eden-like world in a drop of water—and falls in love with the beautiful woman who lives in it.\n\nSeldes finally did introduce The Diamond Lens and Other Stories, published in 1932 as a limited edition with subtly sinister illustrations by Ferdinand Huszti Horvath. The book featured seven of O’Brien’s tales of the weird and grotesque, most notably “The Wondersmith,” which centers on a satanic toymaker whose miniature figures can be animated to kill the young children who play with them. According to Anthony Boucher, who reprinted the story in the December 1950 issue of The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, “almost the whole body of writing on robots is here in matrix.” That matrix, however, is one of melodramatic grisliness and horror in the style of the French Théâtre du Grand-Guignol. In one blood-drenched chapter, the inventor of these devil dolls tests their ferocity by setting them loose to massacre the caged birds in a pet store.\n\nO’Brien’s even better-known “What Was It?: A Mystery” describes a life-or-death struggle against an invisible and murderous humanoid entity. So popular was the story that the O’Brien scholar Jessica Amanda Salmonson found it represented in “over thirty anthologies between 1896 and 1964.”\n\nNevertheless, the Celtic Poe, as the Irish-born O’Brien has been called, is probably as little known today as he was in Seldes’s time. Yet he deserves serious attention, if only for establishing or promulgating some of science fiction’s most familiar tropes: microcosmic worlds, invisible monsters, time slips, robots. In one of his stories a fabricator of artificial eyes creates a portable surveillance camera in the form of an egg-size eyeball that transmits images to its creator. In another, O’Brien sets down the precise engineering specs for the construction of a gyroscope-like personal flying machine.\n\nWhile even his best stories tend to be structurally ramshackle and go on just a little too long, they always display O’Brien’s remarkably protean imagination. For example, “The Dragon-Fang Possessed by the Conjurer Piou-Lu” is a comic fantasy set in an ancient China that never was, one in which a tailor can be referred to as an “inventive closer of symmetrical seams.” Utterly surreal, the novella-length “From Hand to Mouth” takes place in the Hotel de Coup d’Oeil and features disembodied hands and ears, a talking bird, a heroine whose legs have been stolen, a mirror that acts as a clone generator, and an ancient guardian who, like Dante’s Bertran de Born, carries his head under his arm. The hotel’s owner is Count Goloptious, a kind of psychic vampire who slowly drains the residents of their creative vitality. For the most part this gothic comedy resembles a mix of The Rocky Horror Picture Show and Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland.\n\nIn fact, a considerable number of O’Brien’s stories should be viewed as absurdist fantasies. In “The Wonderful Adventures of Mr. Papplewick” the middle-aged protagonist finds himself accidentally transformed into a human magnet, just misses becoming a star exhibit in P.T. Barnum’s museum of grotesques, and ends up on an expedition to the North Pole, where he encounters a talking walrus. An amusing playlet, “The Gory Gnome,” neatly sends up the vogue for sentimental, romantic melodrama. Set in the Harz Mountains, it features a star-crossed couple described as the “despairing Lover” and the “Distressed Heroine.” In the opening scene of this five-page theatrical extravaganza—an active volcano plays an important role—Anna Matilda, the Distressed Heroine, enters “hurriedly, with disheveled hair, eating a sandwich,” which she quickly finishes before announcing to the audience that she’s been living on nothing but wild berries. Another story, “The Comet and I,” depicts an anthropomorphized comet taken on a tour of New York, not excluding the saloons. It’s the kind of jeu d’esprit long associated with Donald Barthelme.\n\nThe full panoply of Fitz-James O’Brien’s macabre fiction—horror stories, satires, weird tales, contes cruels—has now been assembled by the independent scholar John P. Irish in an exceptionally handsome three-volume edition comprising An Arabian Night-mare and Others (1848–1854), The Diamond Lens and Others (1855–1858), and What Was It? and Others (1858–1864). Irish’s introductory essay, which is spread out over the three volumes, provides a useful overview of O’Brien’s life and extended commentary on his major works, but also makes claims for the writer’s importance and influence that seem overzealous. No matter. Though endnotes explaining period slang and obscure allusions would have been helpful, this is the most complete edition of O’Brien’s supernatural writing now available, superseding that compiled by Salmonson in 1988.\n\nBoth Irish and Salmonson use the original magazine appearances of the stories for their copy text instead of relying on the sometimes slightly edited versions printed in William Winter’s pioneering 1881 volume, The Poems and Stories of Fitz-James O’Brien. However, we now know that Salmonson inadvertently made two misattributions: “Seeing the World” is actually an English version of a work by Vladimir Fedorovich Odoevsky, and “A Dead Secret” was written by George Augustus Sala. This confusion arose because much of O’Brien’s copious writing for periodicals appeared anonymously, as was then the common practice.\n\nMoreover, O’Brien was one of those prolific professional writers who could turn their hand to anything. Sensitive to the era’s penchant for tear-jerking sentimentality, he could produce “Duke Humphrey’s Dinner,” an O. Henry–like tale about a starving young couple who pretend to dine on imaginary delicacies and are rescued from death at almost the last moment. Alas, the two orphaned waifs and the organ grinder’s monkey in another of his tear-jerkers aren’t so lucky: all three freeze to death—on Christmas Eve.\n\nAs a magazine poet, O’Brien could turn out Keatsian lyrics, tragic ballads, or political satire. (A handful of the poems with an eerie or fantastic cast are included in Irish’s edition.) As a journalist, he produced reams of opinion essays—it’s been estimated that half of his three hundred or so known pieces of writing are devoted to political or economic matters—but he could also dash off lighthearted casuals, some under the rubric the Man About Town. His book and theater reviews blend insight with humor, always a winning combination. Though one of Herman Melville’s earliest admirers, he nonetheless suggested that the author of Typee and Mardi would be wise to adopt the familiar but elegant prose style of Joseph Addison rather than the baroque grandeur of Sir Thomas Browne. (Happily, Melville didn’t take this advice.) In judging a revival of his own popular comedy A Gentleman from Ireland, O’Brien spared neither the production nor his youthful self:\n\nThe dialogue is sometimes smart, but never witty, while occasionally it rises into the realm of fustian. The ending of the first act is weak and nonsensical. There is no characterization in it from beginning to end, and everybody talks like everybody else.\n\nThat’s scathingly (if half facetiously) dismissive, yet this transplanted Irishman’s savage indignation could sometimes match that of his countryman Jonathan Swift, particularly in the best of the early stories, “The King of Nodland and His Dwarf.” In Nodland, to sleep as many hours as possible is the whole aim and purpose of life. Given the resulting universal torpor, the Nodlanders maintain their somnolent lifestyle by enslaving members of the pastoral Cock-Crow people from a neighboring country. Meanwhile, Nodland’s government constantly replenishes its treasury—the money largely spent on frivolous luxuries for the king—by levying increasingly arcane taxes. Lord Incubus, the prime minister, reasons that “the more necessary a thing is…the more it ought to be taxed. Superfluities can be dispensed with, but if you want to be sure of a man’s money, tax something that he cannot possibly do without.”\n\nThis policy soon leads to a graduated impost on the number of hours a citizen spends asleep. Only the first four are tax-free. Unsurprisingly, a firebrand named Ivned soon calls for revolution, though he actually just craves total power for himself. “He possessed a certain species of vulgar, brazen eloquence, that was very effective with a particular class,” O’Brien writes.\n\nHis effrontery was dauntless, and his conscience, from systematic stretching, had become so large that it was capable of embracing any set of opinions from which the most profit was to be derived. He blustered largely about an article he called “patriotism,” but which in reality meant self-interest; he was, in short, one of those bold, bad men who was sufficiently elevated above his own low class to be regarded by them as a leader, but who was too far beneath any other to be looked on in the light of any thing but an unpleasant pest.\n\nAnything but an unpleasant pest himself, the easygoing O’Brien appears to have charmed every echelon of New York society. He was, however, cagey about his past. We now know—largely from the excellent 1944 biography by Francis Wolle—that he was born in Cork, either in 1826 or 1828, to a well-off Irish family. He later dissipated his inheritance during a two-year London spree, almost certainly resided in France for a time (he spoke excellent French), and immigrated to the United States in late 1851, possibly to escape the consequences of an affair with a married woman.\n\nIn New York, where he lived throughout the 1850s, O’Brien quickly joined the loose sodality of flaneurs and freelance writers who called themselves Bohemians. By his own definition, true Bohemians rejected bourgeois society to “cultivate literature and debts, and, heedless of the necessities, fondly pursue the luxuries.” In his later years, Thomas Bailey Aldrich—by then one of the country’s most popular poets—would recall “how hurt I was on an occasion when O’Brien borrowed $35.00 off me, to pay a pressing bill, and, instead of paying the bill, gave a little dinner at Delmonico’s to which he did not invite me!” This was typical.\n\nO’Brien consistently dressed as a well-to-do gentleman, was often broke, seldom had any long-fixed abode, frequently drank evenings away at Pfaff’s beer cellar (which Walt Whitman also frequented), regularly got into fistfights (in one he had his nose badly broken), enjoyed practical jokes, and could never maintain the self-discipline needed to hold down a steady job. Better to live by one’s wits as a hack, despite the pittance paid to contributors by even the best magazines, Harper’s Monthly and The Atlantic. As a result, O’Brien needed to write quickly and steadily. In a novel by William North, a character transparently modeled after him is called Fitzgammon O’Bouncer: “A professional critic, he wrote brilliantly but falsely. His imagination dominated his judgment, and worst crime of all, he was superficial—worse yet, consciously superficial.”\n\nThat’s an exquisite put-down, but it’s rivaled by O’Brien’s own self-mocking humor. In a piece titled “Walk Up, Ladies!” he offers himself as the grand prize in a lottery sponsored by an (imaginary) association of eligible bachelors. He naturally catalogs the rare qualities he brings to this signal honor:\n\nI am…of medium height, while in my figure, symmetry and strength are harmoniously mingled. My nose and forehead form the Phidian line. My hands and feet are small and aristocratically shaped, and my eyes by turns melt with the soft emotions of the heart, or flash with the nobler passions of the hero. My hair is chestnut, and flows in long ringlets over my neck, somewhat like the hair of the Apollo Belvidere…. Words fail me in endeavoring to describe my whiskers and mustache. I have been informed by the most excellent female judges that even in their dreams they never imagined any thing more lovely. My accomplishments are varied.\n\nAfter the Civil War broke out in 1861, O’Brien could add “courage” to the list of his virtues. Proudly American and a staunch Unionist, he immediately enlisted and all too soon was shot during a kind of impromptu duel with a Confederate officer. After much suffering, Fitz-James O’Brien died in 1862 at the age of thirty-five.\n\nWhile O’Brien’s prose usually reflects the easy efficiency of the born journalist, one still pauses over his flair for striking phrases and bizarrely surreal imagery. A shark is likened to “the thin blade of a sharp knife, cutting through the water with a slow, even, deadly motion.” Perfect. But to describe a winter storm, he writes, “The large flakes fell sleepily through the dim blue air, like soft white birds that had been stricken with cold in the upper skies, and were sinking benumbed to earth.” (Hmm, cloudy with a chance of chickens?) I particularly love the title he originally proposed for a collection of his stories, “Flotsam and Jetsam—Things Lost by Shipwreck, or Thrown Overboard to Save the Vessel.”\n\nAs it happens, there was no collection of O’Brien’s work until 1881—nearly twenty years after his death—when his friend William Winter brought out The Poems and Stories of Fitz-James O’Brien. Following a section of reminiscences from now forgotten literati of the time, it reprinted over a hundred pages of O’Brien’s poetry and thirteen stories. In general, Winter emphasized the darker, more disturbing fiction.\n\nIn Studies in Classic American Literature, D.H. Lawrence counseled readers to “look through the surface of American art, and see the inner diabolism of the symbolic meaning.” In O’Brien’s case, the diabolism is often right on the surface. In one harrowing conte cruel, a loving wife and mother gradually becomes strangely moody, then one night tries to murder her husband as he sleeps. Why? he asks. “‘I was weary of you,’ she answered, in a cold even voice—a voice so level that it seemed to be spoken on ruled lines, ‘that is my reason.’”\n\nIn “The Lost Room” a man residing in a labyrinthine apartment building discovers that his room may exist in two (or more) dimensions. When he opens its door one evening he surprises guests dressed in eighteenth-century finery trading quips at an elegant dinner party. When he insists that these interlopers leave his room, one of them smugly asks the epistemological question, “How know you that it is your room?” The narrator has already heard rumors that some of the building’s inhabitants are cannibals or demons. Could these be they? Or might they be insidious enchanters? All his own belongings have vanished, but in their stead he glimpses expensive, more sophisticated versions of the originals:\n\nWherever my eyes turned they missed familiar objects, yet encountered strange representatives. Still in all the substitutes there seemed to me a reminiscence of what they replaced…. There lingered around them the atmosphere of what they once had been.\n\nAt the end of the story, the room disappears entirely, leaving only a blank wall.\n\nAgain and again, O’Brien likes to embed his reader inside a protagonist’s disordered mind, as in “The Hasheesh Eater,” or reveal the existential vertigo that results when the universe no longer makes sense, as in “Mother of Pearl.” In “Uncle and Nephew” the eponymous characters flip-flop between which of them is sane, which insane. Even O’Brien’s most gothicky tales eschew the then-typical gothic setting: instead of gloomy castles or the decaying House of Usher, he sets the action in cheap rooming houses in contemporary New York. You could actually visit the sites of the events he chronicles. We are told that the building in “What Was It?” is located on 26th Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenues; a note informs readers that they can soon see a plaster cast of the invisible monster’s head at a local museum.\n\nSuch localization, leisurely set forth, lulls the reader with its comforting familiarity—and only then does O’Brien introduce the ominous thing, the unsettling anomaly. To use Freud’s terminology, the heimlich (homey) suddenly grows unheimlich (uncanny). In some instances, the horrific or bizarre events turn out to have been only nightmares, drug-induced visions, or monomaniacal frenzies. This sort of bathetic letdown mars—some would say ruins—several otherwise terrifying shockers. As a writer, O’Brien regularly has trouble with plotting and especially with closure, which explains why so many of his works end abruptly or exist only as fragments.\n\nOne reason “The Diamond Lens” remains particularly admired lies in its being susceptible to varying interpretations. Consider no more than its first half. In the story’s opening pages the narrator, Linley, recounts his childhood obsession with microscopy, which began with the gift of a simple microscope from a distant cousin. As he recalls,\n\nI comprehended then for the first time the “Arabian Nights’ Entertainments.” The dull veil of ordinary existence that hung across the world seemed suddenly to roll away, and to lay bare a land of enchantments.\n\nTo satisfy the wishes of his family, he agrees to enroll in medical school, but never sets foot in a classroom or laboratory. Instead he expends all his resources in acquiring every possible instrument or accessory needed for advanced microscopic research.\n\nAlready in this set-up, O’Brien hints at two ways to understand what follows: we can believe the narrator utterly, or we can conclude that monomania has left him “enchanted,” that is, delusional. Most readers take the story as “real,” despite the implication of a statement such as this:\n\nIt was I who resolved the singular problem of rotation in the cells and hairs of plants into ciliary attraction, in spite of the assertions of Mr. Wenham and others, that my explanation was the result of an optical illusion.\n\nOf his later research Linley admits that\n\nlike all active microscopists, I gave my imagination full play. Indeed, it is a common complaint against many such, that they supply the defects of their instruments with the creations of their brains.\n\nAt this point, O’Brien presents Jules Simon, an urbane fellow tenant of Linley’s building who regularly persuades him to buy unneeded and overpriced knickknacks. The source of these supposed treasures is kept deliberately vague. As Linley says, “I came at length to the conclusion that this peddling was but a mask to cover some greater object.” What might that object be? One evening Simon mentions, with unusual enthusiasm, the séances of the spiritualist Madame Vulpes. She can reveal “the most astonishing things in the world.”\n\nAlmost immediately, Linley wonders whether she can help reveal astonishing things in the microscopic world. At their meeting, Madame Vulpes summons the spirit of Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, who tells his fellow microscopist that fame will be his if he creates a super-lens out of a 140-carat diamond. Totally disheartened, Linley realizes that such huge diamonds exist only in “the regalia of Eastern or European monarchs.”\n\nAfter returning home, Linley visits Simon, who is closely examining something that he quickly hides away. The normally self-possessed sophisticate behaves oddly, appearing nervous and jittery for no apparent reason. To “probe the mystery to the bottom,” Linley gets Simon drunk, then tricks him by saying he already knows his secret, so why hide it any longer? Reluctantly, or so it would seem, Simon shows him a large and lustrous diamond: “I could just gather from his drunken statements (of which, I fancy, half the incoherence was affected) that he had been superintending a gang of slaves engaged in diamond-washing in Brazil” and one day absconded with the stone and fled to New York. If this is true, why is Simon’s incoherence “affected”? Needless to say, the diamond, which he calls “The Eye of Morning,” weighs exactly 140 carats. “Here was an amazing coincidence. The hand of Destiny seemed in it.”\n\nI’ll stop there, except to add that Linley does create his diamond lens from the Eye of Morning, and it reveals a fresh, paradisical world in a droplet of water, one inhabited by a lovely human female. Unknowingly, Animula, as he calls her, becomes the adored object of his almost mystical ecstasies: “My whole life was absorbed in contemplation as rapt as that of any of the Romish saints.” Growing ever more hopelessly in thrall to his microscopic beloved, Linley berates himself that what he feels “is at best but a fantasy. Your imagination has bestowed on Animula charms which in reality she does not possess.” As a test, he visits a theater to see a celebrated dancer, said to be the most beautiful woman in the world. He finds her almost repulsive compared with the sylphlike perfection of his Animula. While there’s much more to the story, you can probably guess what will eventually happen.\n\nAt the story’s very end, Linley—like some character out of Poe—confesses that “They say now that I am mad; but they are mistaken.” Are they? O’Brien leaves this an open question. Perhaps Linley did see into another world, but enough clues have been planted to suggest that he might have been imagining everything. I suspect that O’Brien intended this ambiguity. As with Henry James’s “The Turn of the Screw,” we ask ourselves: What is real? Everything or nothing? How much is the product of an unstable imagination?\n\n“The Diamond Lens” might even incorporate an additional turn of the screw: Could Linley have been the dupe in a scam cooked up by Madame Vulpes and Jules Simon? It does seem that he has been subtly manipulated, first to consult the spiritualist, then to learn—so fortuitously—of a diamond weighing precisely 140 carats in the unlikely possession of his fellow tenant. Simon and Vulpes probably counted on Linley to pay whatever it took to acquire the gem, which was doubtless a fake of some sort. Alas, the con artists misjudged the ends to which the fanatical microscopist would go to further his research.\n\nH.L. Mencken once noted that Fitz-James O’Brien was the only significant artist to die in the Civil War. His best works really are significant, too, despite their shaky plotting and occasional smudges of mid-nineteenth-century melodrama. This “fabulous fantast,” as Sam Moskowitz called him in Explorers of the Infinite (1963), remains a crucial figure in American literature’s dominant fictional mode, which isn’t the novel but rather the romance. O’Brien’s stories can’t match the concentrated visionary power of Poe, the Calvinist moral intensity of Hawthorne, or the grim ironies of Bierce, but the best of them do come close. Yes, he is just a minor writer. But aren’t minor writers sometimes the ones we love the most?\n\nMichael Dirda is a Pulitzer Prize–winning critic for The Washington Post and the author of several collections of essays, including Classics for Pleasure and Browsings: A Year of Reading, Collecting, and Living with Books.

    "description": "We’re on a journey to advance and democratize artificial intelligence through open source and open science.",
    "fullText": "A natural way to display multi-step code execution together with reasoning is within a Jupyter Notebook, which consists of code and markdown cells. So we built Jupyter Agent to act as an agent that can execute code directly inside a Jupyter notebook and use this environment to solve data analysis and data science tasks. Think of it like Cursor, but living natively inside your data science workflow.\nWe built a demo of this vision with Qwen-3 Coder, currently one of the strongest coding models. This is a follow-up to our earlier work on jupyter-agent (v1).\n\nWhile large models are starting to show useful behavior, the key question is how we can continue improving them. To this end, we focus on strengthening smaller models to perform well on agentic data science tasks as they currently struggle to compete with the large models.\n\nThe goal of this project is to build a pipeline to first generate high-quality training data, then fine-tune an existing small model, and finally evaluate whether the model's performance improves on relevant benchmarks.\n\nLet’s begin with the last step: selecting a strong benchmark for evaluating models on data science tasks.\n\nIn order to understand if we are making progress towards better data science agents we need a benchmark to measure such capabilities. Last year, in partnership with Adyen, we introduced the DABStep benchmark: a way to evaluate data science agents on realistic tasks. The setup is simple: provide the LLM with datasets and ask it to answer non-trivial data questions.\n\nThis benchmark remains challenging for today’s LLMs — e.g. the best out-of-the-box model is Claude 4 Sonnet which reaches not even 20% accuracy on the hard tasks.\nYou can explore the live leaderboard here.\n\nNow that we identified a good benchmark we can try to climb it! We set out to build a dataset for fine-tuning such that even a small data agent model could perform well on DABStep.\n\nOur first choice was Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507: extremely small (fast to iterate with, easy to run), yet strong enough to act in agentic scenarios.\n\nNot great — but a promising starting point, since it left a lot of room for improvement. Let's see how we can improve it!\n\nA core aspect of agents that sets it apart from a pure chat model is the scaffolding built around the model to steer its behaviour. The evaluation script in DABStep for example uses smolagents to execute code. Smolagents comes with predefined behaviors, prompting structures, and expected formats.\n\nWe also studied the Qwen-Agent codebase, where the authors tailoring scaffolding to the model. This makes sense: Claude Code, for example, works shockingly well with Claude Sonnet because their scaffolding is aligned.\n\nSo, we restructured our scaffolding:\n\n👉 Check it out here: utils.py.\n\nResults: accuracy jumped from 44.4% → 59.7% (easy split). 🚀\n\nWith simplified scaffolding in place, we focused on fine-tuning Qwen3-4B for data science agentic tasks.\n\nThe recipe to improve a model on a certain task or behaviour is to train it on data that reflects the tasks as closely as possible. A natural starting point is to look at real Jupyter Notebooks and find notebooks that align closely with the task that we plan to tackle, namely data analysis.\n\nKaggle notebooks offer a wealth of high quality data analysis notebooks and are made available by Kaggle:\n\nNow that we have good results with a base model it's time to build a dataset that will help us improve it even further. We designed a multi-stage pipeline using Datatrove to clean and prepare Kaggle notebooks at scale.\n\nWe started with ~2TB of Kaggle notebooks and reduced it to ~250GB reusing our work from the BigCode project. As part of the StarCoder2 training data processing the notebooks (without output cells) were already deduplicated.\nMost Kaggle notebooks are small variations or near-identical copies, so this step was essential.\nKey insight: ~90% of raw notebooks are duplicates, which would have skewed training if left unfiltered.\n\nMost Kaggle notebooks reference external datasets via Kaggle metadata. To make sure the code inside notebooks could actually run, we built a pipeline that automatically fetched these linked datasets. This step was crucial, since many notebooks would otherwise be incomplete or non-executable.\n\nUsing the kagglehub package, we downloaded thousands of datasets — about 5TB in total. To keep things manageable and relevant:\n\nWe scored notebooks based on educational quality using Qwen3-32B. We saw that using the whole notebook was not optimal, as many contained trivial or broken code. Our educational scoring approach is detailed in edu_scoring.py.\n\nTL;DR: We assigned each notebook a score from 1–5 based on clarity, completeness, and educational value, and kept only those above a chosen threshold. This filtering removed about 70% of the notebooks.\n\nThis is similar to the insight from the BeyondWeb paper, which showed that using high-quality data is better for synthetic data generation — a step we relied on for QA (Question-Answer) generation.\nThis helped the model learn from “high quality” notebooks instead of noisy ones.\n\nWe excluded notebooks about training LLMs or unrelated to data analysis.\nWe also removed notebooks that didn’t actually use datasets through an automated LLM-based filtering process using Qwen3-32B. The implementation of filtering can be found in extract_packages_and_files.py.\n\nTL;DR: We prompted Qwen3-32B to identify and remove notebooks that either (1) had nothing to do with data analysis, or (2) didn’t actually use datasets. This step removed about 20% of the notebooks.\n\nThis ensured we trained only on relevant data science tasks.\n\nUsing the cleaned notebooks, we generated question–answer pairs using Qwen3-32B. The questions and answer are grounded in the real notebook traces so the QA pairs are based on real code execution results.\nPrompt design: we asked the LLM to produce natural questions that could realistically be asked of the dataset, then validated whether the notebook provided a correct answer.\n\nChallenge: We had to try many prompts to get higher-difficulty questions because LLMs tended to generate trivial ones like \"what is the size of the dataset\".\nInsight: We broke this into two steps because LLMs tended to hallucinate answers:\n\nThe complete prompting strategy and implementation is available in generate_qa.py.\n\nFinally we want to generate clean code execution traces since even the original notebooks after processing are often open ended and verbose with lots of irrelevant parts. However, we want our Jupyter Agent to get to the result efficiently. To generate cleaner notebook traces for training we generated traces synthetically based on the original notebooks.\nWe have prompted Qwen-3-Coder-480B model to generate a jupyter notebook code to answer the question from the previously generated synthetic QA pair. \nTraces captured step-by-step code execution, including intermediate outputs, which are crucial for agent training.\n\nWe used E2B for our agent to solve the synthetic QA pairs, which required fetching Kaggle datasets so the code could actually run via E2B.\n\nChallenge 1: Many datasets were unavailable.\nTrick: Since LLMs are strong at code and have a decent world model, we prompted them to act as a code interpreter when the dataset was missing.\n\nChallenge 2: Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B model does not support thinking mode - how can we extract code commentary? By default it often outputs just a brief comment followed by several steps of code execution. However, we'd like some reasoning or comments between every cell. \nTrick: When switching from Qwen3-32B to Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B we noticed that often output message content was empty. This turns out to be a previously known quirk of Qwen3-Coder models in which when using tool calling the model would not return an empty assistant response. We enforce some text commentary through tooling by passing 'comment' as a required field in the code execution tool call. This way when non-reasoning model is used for code cell generation it will by default output some description of its actions from 1st POV, emulating the thinking traces structure.\n\nNote: the generated final answer in the notebook may vary from the answer specified in the QA pair. This is caused by the fact that the agent model could use data preprocessing methods and steps different from the original Kaggle notebook and the synthetic question would not usually specify them. This discrepancy is normal and lays the foundation for a new exciting research direction of how language models tend to treat data analysis and whether they do it differently from humans. For full transparency we keep both LLM-generated final answer and original answer from the real Kaggle notebook as a signal of model's performance. We encourage the community to try different dataset mixes to see how they can push performance even further.\n\nWe truncated overly long outputs and filtered out trivial traces to prevent content length issues and keep only high-quality traces.\nWe kept non-trivial, multi-turn traces aligned with DABStep-style tasks.\nThe resulting Jupyter Agent Dataset became the foundation for SFT on Qwen3-4B models with 51k synthetic notebooks and almost 0.2B tokens.\n\nWith this dataset in hand, the natural next step is to see whether it actually helps our model become a stronger data science agent. Let’s move on to the training pipeline and evaluate the impact!\n\nWith the curated dataset ready, we turned to the key question: does this data actually help the model get better at solving data analysis tasks?\nTo find out, we set up a simple fine-tuning pipeline and ran experiments to measure the impact of training on our synthetic notebooks.\n\nSome training steps turned out to be particularly interesting and gave us useful insights:\n\nOur complete training implementation, including hyperparameter configurations and template adaptations, is available in our finetuning directory in our repo.\n\nFirst, we generated our final dataset using Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B which contains high quality code and short reasoning-like traces. Afterwards, we started our training and we have experimented with various configurations like PEFT/adapters vs. full-parameter tuning, learning rate, number of epochs, adding noise and others. We found out, that full-parameter fine-tuning allows the model to learn and replicate the Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B behavior response quality better with shorter supporting commentary fitting more to the data analysis task without unnecessary long reasoning.\n\nWe have done a small ablation study on the impact of no. training epochs:\n\nWe observe that it is beneficial to have a bit more epochs than usual for SFT with lower learning rate and higher neftune noise (7). Finally, we compare our trained models with implemented scaffolding to define the pure impact of our training dataset. In summary, we can see up to 36%/22% boost on DABStep easy score compared with base/scaffolded model:\n\nWe can also see, that the hard score can increase too even though our dataset is focused on easier questions:\n\nFrom figures above one can notice a noticeable impact of both new scaffolding and tuning on our synthetic notebooks. This makes Qwen-4B (with our pipeline + scaffolding) a state-of-the-art small-model agent on DABStep.\n\nIn practice, the model can now solve a wide range of realistic Kaggle-style data analysis tasks with consistent execution.\nIt’s not yet strong enough for the hardest queries, but we’ve shown that even small models can become powerful agents when paired with the right data and scaffolding.\n\nThese results demonstrate that even small models can become powerful data science agents with the right training approach. Ready to try it yourself? We've made everything openly available so you can experiment with our fine-tuned models and dataset.\n\nWe openly release best-performing checkpoints of tuned Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507 and Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507 together with the training dataset, which you can try out and experiment with:\n\nYou can load Jupyter Agent Dataset in just a couple of lines using the following code:\n\nYou can also use sourced Kaggle datasets directly with E2B code execution using the following code:\n\nYou use tuned Jupyter Agent Qwen-based models following the Qwen documentation code:\n\nFor Thinking model you can decode both thinking response and content using the next code:\n\nMaybe this will lead to… Jupyter-Agent 3. 😉\n\nWe hope that our findings will inspire others to continue progress in developing more powerful notebook coding agents and we're excited to see what the community builds next.

    "title": "Why is Nature considered a \"prestigious\" journal?",
    "description": "Since launching in 1869, Nature has evolved from a periodical offering commentary on pigeons to the prestige journal in science. But how did Nature build its reputation, and can it last?",
    "fullText": "Science seeks truths that outlive those who discover them. English poet William Wordsworth’s observation that “to the solid ground of nature trusts the Mind that builds for aye [forever]” — a line that appeared beneath the masthead of the scientific journal Nature for 75 years — captures this romantic ambition: the dream that building on nature’s foundations yields truths durable enough to transcend their discoverers.\n\nAnd yet, for many of us, when we think about scientific prestige, we cannot help but focus on the individual. Often, we imagine institutions such as Oxford or Harvard as metonyms for the “brilliant mind,” or perhaps envision a Nobel Laureate or Fields Medal winner. One component of this prestige is selectivity — from many, few are chosen. The same is true for scientific journals. While both journals and individuals project their prestige through reputation, journals have found ways to signal prestige through metrics such as impact factor, acceptance rate, and journal rankings; each suggesting the difficulty of publication and the likelihood that an individual’s work will receive institutional acclaim as a result.\n\nAt the dawn of the 19th century, approximately 100 scientific periodicals existed worldwide, and by its close, this number had risen to an estimated 10,000. Such growth marked a new era of independent scientific periodicals, distinct from traditional society publications. In such a competitive landscape, most of these publications clung to a tenuous existence, with prominent titles like The Reader (founded 1863) and Scientific Opinion (1864) struggling financially before ultimately folding. Even established and reputable periodicals, such as Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, which had enjoyed royal patronage since it was formally taken over by the Royal Society in 1752, rarely made money and struggled to publish without assistance.\n\nWhen Norman Lockyer and Alexander Macmillan launched Nature on November 4th, 1869, they did so amidst a graveyard of failed scientific periodicals. That Nature survived while so many publications collapsed reflects not only scientific merit, but patronage, elite networks, speed of publication, and a talent for capturing an international audience.\n\nFrom these advantages emerged not only a successful journal but also a system of prestige that continues to shape modern science. Prestige in this system is not simply a reflection of pure scientific merit, as one would hope, but a fiction that attempts to command attention in an era where the quantity of research far exceeds an individual’s capacity to assess it.\n\nToday, this system faces serious scrutiny, with many questioning whether selective journals serve science beyond merely rationing merit. Understanding how Nature’s prestige was constructed, however, can help clarify which elements are deserved and which are entrenched.\n\nMany of the features that would come to define Nature emerged in its earliest years. Survival was not inevitable, ultimately resting upon three contingent advantages: patronage that insulated it from commercial failure, elite networks that conferred early credibility, and a publication speed responsive to the increasingly competitive scientific environment.\n\nInitially, what distinguished Nature from its failed contemporaries was the patronage of Alexander Macmillan, who, alongside his brother, had built Macmillan & Co. into one of Britain’s most successful publishers. Flush from a remarkably profitable decade built on fiction, theological texts, and educational works, Macmillan was eager to expand his empire and could afford to absorb the financial losses that would have buried other periodicals (which he did, for the thirty years before Nature began turning a profit).\n\nMacmillan already knew Lockyer. Indeed, Lockyer’s Elementary Lessons in Astronomy (1868) had sold well for Macmillan, who then employed him as his most important “consulting physician in regard to scientific books and schemes.” Lockyer was at the zenith of his early career, co-discovering helium with Pierre Jules Janssen in 18681 and elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1869.\n\nHad Lockyer’s reputation not been what it was, Nature would have perished. Patronage secured survival, but credibility required connection. Lockyer’s prior editorship of The Reader had linked him to influential scientific circles, most notably the English biologist Thomas Huxley and the X-Club. This informal dining society of nine prominent scientists, formed in 1864 and meeting monthly, exercised considerable influence over British scientific institutions and publications, promoting scientific naturalism and working to establish science as a professional, secular discipline independent of ecclesiastical authority.\n\nHuxley, alarmed by scientific errors in popular books and frustrated by theological overtones he believed many journalists (particularly women) wove into their writing, concluded that only researchers themselves could properly educate the public. Through his enthusiastic support, Nature found an early contributor with an interest in scientific journalism unusual for a man of his scientific stature. Huxley, for his part, relished the attention, musing that when it came to journalism, he was “as spoiled as a maiden with many wooers.” Huxley also encouraged other prominent figures to contribute, even though they generally preferred to publish lengthy scientific essays in more established monthly periodicals.\n\nWhile attracting prominent contributors was beneficial, the early editorial approach of Nature was unconventional. Lockyer envisioned the journal serving two audiences: educated laypeople seeking accessible science and professional researchers eager to learn about the latest advances.\n\nAvoiding the abstract, passive voice of specialist journals, many popular articles in Nature were written in an accessible first-person, journalistic style. Observations from readers of a decidedly less technical nature were featured, including a report of a pigeon’s cunning method of procuring food by repeatedly startling a horse to shake grain from its nose-bag and an account of a goose raised by a Golden Eagle and taught “to eat flesh.”\n\nGradually, such whimsical observations yielded space to more technical book reviews and papers. Lockyer, who had hoped for favor from both the intellectually sophisticated layman and the scientific community, found that he mostly attracted the latter. Nature became a publication with short publication cycles and brief articles, with little elaboration or color.\n\nMany scientists viewed these changes positively, regarding Nature as an efficient means to highlight a scientific idea. Capturing this sentiment, William Crookes, who would later become President of the Royal Society and one of the discoverers of Thallium, requested in an 1895 letter to Lockyer that his paper on helium’s spectrum appear in Nature even though it would already be published in his own Chemical News: “my circulation is not to the same class of researchers as that of ‘Nature,’ and having taken a great deal of trouble about it I want the results to get to the right people.”\n\nNature had cultivated this readership of active researchers through publication speed: its weekly schedule made it essential reading for scientists tracking developments in increasingly competitive fields. As to why such speed was possible, one likely factor was economic. Macmillan absorbed the financial losses that more frequent publication required, losses that would have crippled competitors, while society journals generally operated on quarterly schedules tied to meeting proceedings, creating inherent publication delays.\n\nThe strategic utility of this model became evident in how researchers employed the journal. One example was George Romanes, a seminal figure of comparative psychology and popularizer of “neo-Darwinism,” who presented his theory of “physiological selection” to the Linnean Society in May 1886 before publishing detailed abstracts across three consecutive August issues of Nature to establish priority.\n\nThe success of Nature’s approach was recognized internationally, with the first editor of Science declaring his desire that it may “in the United States, take the position which Nature so ably occupies in England, in presenting immediate information of scientific events.”\n\nSpeed of publication would have meant little, of course, without credibility. Although Nature initially drew legitimacy from its X-Club connections, this proved fragile. Lockyer’s commitment to editorial independence conflicted with the Club’s expectation that the journal would reliably advance its interests. Disputes followed, beginning in 1872 with the Hooker-Owen controversy, where Nature published Joseph Hooker’s defense against Richard Owen’s accusations of mismanaging Kew Gardens, and then gave Owen space to respond with his rebuttal. Hooker, a prominent X-Club member, regarded the platforming of his opponent as an act of disloyalty, while Lockyer argued that the journal could not be “the mere mouthpiece of a clique.”\n\nThoroughly annoyed with Lockyer and losing much of their initial enthusiasm, the X-Club’s contributions to Nature began to decline, further isolating the publication’s lay readership by depriving them of the popular articles the Club had regularly provided. Yet this development did not significantly undermine Nature’s credibility within the scientific community. The X-Club still faced opposition from many important scientists who continued to contribute to the journal, while the Club’s own influence was waning due to internal conflicts and its aging membership, leading to its disbanding in 1892.\n\nMore significantly, a new generation of scientists was beginning to assume leadership of the British scientific community, and this cohort would include some of Nature’s most important and prolific contributors of the late nineteenth century, such as eminent zoologist Ray Lankester, physicist Oliver Lodge (a giant in radio communication), and George Romanes, a protégé of Darwin.\n\nUnlike their predecessors, whose preferred medium for scientific debate tended to be long-form periodicals, this new generation generally preferred Nature, often redirecting debate to its pages. Debates were structured, combative exchanges, featuring formal turn-taking and explicit rebuttals.\n\nOne noteworthy debate centered on Weismann’s theory of panmixia, which proposed that when an organ no longer conferred an evolutionary advantage, that organ would no longer be the subject of natural selection, leading it to diminish in size or vanish entirely. George Romanes endorsed this view in Nature, prompting Lankester to challenge him directly, arguing that a “useless” organ would be equally inclined to grow or diminish, and that panmixia could not account for reduction unless smaller size itself conferred an advantage. The exchange extended over eight weeks in Nature’s pages, with Romanes refusing to concede and instead insisting that Lankester fundamentally misunderstood his position.\n\nFor all its growing influence, Nature wasn’t yet particularly prestigious. It lacked the rigor of journals like Annalen der Physik or the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, finding survival through patronage and speed.2 At this time, Richard Gregory, an administrator rather than a practicing scientist, was hired as Nature’s editor-in-chief in 1919 — a smart choice given that many of Nature’s challenges were operational rather than scientific.\n\nSensible of his own limitations, Gregory had positioned himself not as a “man of science,” but as a “spokesman of science.” As a spokesman, Gregory was oriented more towards advocacy and would extend such efforts beyond Britain, positioning Nature as an international venue protecting scientific freedoms.\n\nStarting in 1933, for example, Nature began criticizing the Nazi regime for their expulsions of Jewish scientists. The Nazi regime banned the journal from German libraries in 1937. Gregory later defended this position forcefully, arguing that only “a German political official” would expect scientists to remain silent while respected colleagues were expelled “as the result of bitter racial prejudice.”\n\nThis pattern made Nature unusual among prominent journals: domestic contributions steadily declined over time. By 1933, half of Nature’s letters came from outside Britain. By contrast, Science remained predominantly American even later in the century (by 1980, only 15 percent of its experimental content came from abroad). In making Nature international when most other journals remained domestic, Gregory had established what would become a keystone of Nature’s future prestige.\n\nYet progress was fragile, with the international vision waning under Gregory’s successors, A.J.V Gale and Lionel “Jack” Brimble. Viewing their role as publishing “as many credible scientific papers — particularly ones from respectable British laboratories — as possible,” editorial selections became more domestic as English was displacing German and French as science’s lingua franca.\n\nThat said, their passive editorial approach meant they largely accommodated, rather than restricted, international submissions. By 1965, nearly 60 percent3 of all articles and letters originated from abroad. This shift was largely contributor-driven, as scientists worldwide continued to see Nature’s utility for gaining visibility and establishing priority findings.\n\nAdopting such a hands-off approach had consequences for editorial quality, however. Nature developed a reputation for printing almost anything that wasn’t demonstrably wrong, with editorial decisions often relying disproportionately on institutional prestige as a filter. One notable editorial misjudgment was the geophysicist Lawrence Morley’s seafloor spreading hypothesis, submitted from Canada in February 1963, which was dismissed by Nature’s referee as mere “talk at cocktail parties.” Seven months later, Vine and Matthew’s virtually identical hypothesis, bearing Cambridge credentials, sailed through to publication in what became known, with belated justice, as the Vine-Matthews-Morley hypothesis.\n\nStill not considered a particularly prestigious journal by the mid-1960s, Nature suffered from mediocre output, erratic refereeing, and publication delays that exceeded 14 months, eroding the speed that had once been one of its strongest competitive advantages.4 As geologist Drummond Matthews (of Vine-Matthews-Morley fame) would later recall, Nature “dropped into a sort of vacuum … American labs wouldn’t hear anything of it — thought it was all nonsense.”\n\nYet, Nature’s position within Britain’s scientific establishment still attracted significant breakthroughs, particularly in biological sciences, where the editors had actual expertise. Perhaps most famously, Watson and Crick’s 1953 DNA structure paper was accepted within three weeks, without external peer review, after Physics Nobel Laureate Lawrence Bragg sent a “strong covering letter” to the editors, whom he knew personally.5\n\nWith a reputation resting less on systematic editorial excellence and more on adjacency to transformative figures, Nature was — confusingly — both a second-tier outlet and a site for breakthroughs that reshaped entire fields.\n\nGifted this unhappy inheritance in 1966, editor John Maddox set about transforming Nature from survivor to standard-bearer, confronting a publication backlog of six months or more — nearly 2,000 manuscripts — left behind by Brimble and Gale’s passive editorial approach. He would first restore the submission processing speed that had deteriorated under his predecessors, pursuing a more assertive editorial strategy, and laying the foundation for the selectivity that would come to define Nature’s modern identity.\n\nTo speed up article processing, Maddox imposed discipline: instituting daily editorial meetings and introducing a streamlined index-card tracking system6 that sped up publication. By December 1966, he was even printing submission dates to signal the journal’s restored speed.7\n\nPerhaps the greatest departure from previous editorships was Maddox’s view that Nature was engaged in direct competition with other journals. Maddox pursued an editorial strategy that actively courted laboratory submissions, sometimes convincing authors to withdraw their manuscripts from rival periodicals.8 By courting higher-quality submissions and publishing them quickly, Maddox restored much of Nature’s reputation. This success did, however, create an issue: rising submissions overwhelmed the journal.\n\nUnfortunately for Maddox, this backfired. Authors in the satellite journals felt “demoted to the second division,” while British researchers appeared disproportionately in the flagship (over 50 percent) compared to the satellites (~33 percent), reinforcing perceptions of Nature as a “very British establishment journal.” When Nature recorded a financial loss at the end of 1972, Maddox was replaced.9\n\nIn 1973, Nature’s new editor, David Davies, scrapped the three-journal plan, returning to a single title while retaining Maddox's operational improvements. With submissions continuing to grow but channeled through one outlet rather than three, Nature rejection rates continued to rise. Authors sought out Nature not only for visibility but for the symbolic capital it conferred. For the aspiring scientist navigating an environment where funding had slowed and, in many fields, shrunk, publication in Nature represented a form of career insurance.\n\nHowever, exclusivity was an asset only if it was perceived as legitimate. Davies set out to reform the editorial process, moving it from the insular circles that had characterized earlier periods.\n\nWithin the first year of his editorship, Davies made peer review a requirement. Nature was late to this practice — American journals had been experimenting with peer review since the 1940s, and institutionalizing it since the 1960s — but the timing proved strategically important: U.S. academic departments increasingly demanded peer-reviewed publications for tenure decisions.\n\nUltimately, peer review didn’t transform Nature’s standing so much as protect it, converting exclusivity that might have seemed arbitrary into gatekeeping that appeared meritocratic.\n\nTogether, Davies and Maddox had directed a significant transformation. By the late 1970s, they had created the essential architecture of modern Nature — a highly selective, internationally oriented, generalist publication. This architecture allowed Nature publications to function as Schelling points,10 coordinating attention and providing shared references that researchers across disciplines could build on without extensive explanation. Nature’s prestige, in other words, derived less from gatekeeping quality than from solving a coordination problem.\n\nAnd by solving that problem, Nature became valuable as career insurance. Publication in Nature provided a universally recognized signal for hiring committees, grant reviewers, and colleagues. It also had scientific value, because breakthroughs often arise when researchers apply principles from their own discipline to another. A paper’s inclusion alongside others of unrelated inquiry thereby indicated that a scientist’s work wasn’t only impactful in their own field but contributed to science on the whole.\n\nDavies, who believed that staying in the same role too long led to personal stagnation, left Nature in 1980. To the surprise of many, including Davies, he was to be replaced by a returning Maddox, whose reappointment was facilitated by management changes at Macmillan, particularly the declining influence of one of its publishing executives, Jenny Hughes, who had orchestrated his prior exit.\n\nUpon returning, Maddox set out to establish Nature as the definitive publication for the international scientific community. By 1980, four-fifths of articles and letters already originated from outside Britain. Nature extended this reach by opening offices in Tokyo, Paris, Munich, and Hong Kong. International expansion was accompanied by increased selectivity. By the late 1980s, Nature’s acceptance rate had fallen to just 12.5 percent (down from 35 percent in 1974), making publication more highly coveted; for comparison, editor Daniel Koshland Jr. reported Science’s acceptance rate at approximately 20 percent in 1985.\n\nThroughout both editorships, Maddox had maintained a conviction that a scientific journal “should have an opinion on the state of science,” rather than serving as a passive conduit. During his first tenure, Maddox had personally taken over writing editorials, often at the last minute, to keep them current and provocative, and restructured the journal to place news and opinion prominently at the front. His second tenure would see a more direct approach, albeit sometimes controversially, such as when he personally investigated claims about homeopathy in 1988, drawing criticism for creating a “circus” atmosphere, and again when he deployed editorial skepticism against cold fusion claims the following year.\n\nDespite such blips, by 1995, Nature had largely solidified its position through its core strengths. Its selectivity made publication valued across the global scientific community. Its international reach connected researchers. Finally, its approval had become one of science’s most valued forms of validation.\n\nUpon assuming the editorship in 1995, Philip Campbell — a physicist who had spent the previous decade in science publishing, including as founding editor of the magazine Physics World — was tasked with preserving the legacy of Davies and Maddox as the journal transitioned from print to pixel. Through editorial independence, digital presence, and selective competitive engagement, Nature would continue to strengthen its institutional position.\n\nInstitutional security, however, often rested on foundations beyond Campbell’s direct editorial control. During Campbell’s editorship, Nature’s portfolio expanded significantly: though sub-journals had resumed under Maddox with Nature Genetics in 1992, Campbell’s tenure would see them increase in number from 3 in 1995, to 30 by 2018, with many more partner journals.11\n\nCampbell and other editors proposed or were consulted about new journal content; in the 2010s, he recalls supporting the initiation and early development of multidisciplinary thematic journals such as Nature Climate Change and Nature Sustainability. This devolved authority operated across multiple levels: issue-by-issue editorial decisions remained independent from corporate strategy, the journal and magazine maintained independence from one another, and individual Nature-branded journals operated independently from the flagship.12\n\nAnother significant development during Campbell’s tenure was the digitization of Nature content. Just as Davies had protected Nature’s standing through peer review — not by implementing it brilliantly, but by ensuring its absence couldn’t be used against the journal — digitization served a similar defensive function. Even though nature.com launched inauspiciously in 1995, with limited content, technical issues, and no full papers, its existence mattered more than its execution. This imperfect step, taken to be seen as modern and avoid anachronism, would prove foundational as scientific communication moved overwhelmingly online.\n\nCampbell’s control was primarily editorial; for example, he sought to boost Nature’s attention to research themes he felt were undersupported, expanding coverage of foundational themes like methodology and scientific integrity, as well as specific subject matter such as marine science and mental health. Campbell also initiated greater engagement with the social sciences across Nature’s magazine and journal content, which underpinned the subsequent expansion of multidisciplinary research in Nature and its thematic journals beyond the natural sciences.\n\nEditorial independence remained important, even when at odds with the publisher’s interests. One example of this independence was the Human Genome Project, an international project to sequence, map, and identify all human DNA. In 2000, Craig Venter’s Celera Genomics and the public Human Genome Project were completing their sequences, with Science pursuing both manuscripts. Venter insisted that some data remain behind a paywall (a position not considered heretical at the time). Campbell, however, refused these terms, judging it more important that data published in Nature remain publicly accessible, even at the risk of losing both sequences to Science. Venter did indeed go to Science, though Nature was able to publish the public project.\n\nSimilarly, when DORA (the Declaration on Research Assessment; an initiative advocating for the evaluation of research on its own merits rather than relying on journal metrics) launched in 2012, Nature abandoned a marketing campaign that had highlighted impact factor as a way to boost subscriptions. Campbell had been a longstanding critic of impact factor, though Nature had continued employing the metric in its marketing. Their public endorsement of DORA, however, cast this reversal as a matter of principle, giving Nature reputational capital for championing fairer evaluation practices. While this action carried some cost in absolute terms (abandoning a successful marketing lever isn’t nothing) Nature’s market position made this cost bearable, whereas it would have been prohibitive for a less established journal.\n\nPerhaps most unusual about Campbell was that he approached rivalry selectively. He was seemingly indifferent to ordinary competition, but would pursue landmark contests intensely. “I can honestly say that we spent little time looking at what other journals were doing,” he would later muse.13 But when the symbolic value justified a more intensive pursuit, such as the Genome Project, Nature would compete aggressively. Otherwise, Campbell operated with a “room for both” philosophy regarding Science, seeing each journal as serving its own constituency. This selective engagement reveals that Nature’s strength during this period came not from controlling everything, but from knowing what mattered for preserving its position.\n\nWhen Magdalena Skipper, the current editor-in-chief, succeeded Campbell in 2018, she commanded a journal whose reach and influence surpassed anything her predecessors had inherited. Yet the surrounding scientific ecosystem was also far less stable. Preprints had matured through platforms like bioRxiv and arXiv, the open science movement was gathering momentum with initiatives like Plan S14 and platforms such as PLOS ONE,15 and conventional scientific institutions faced mounting scrutiny.\n\nWhere Campbell had practiced selective indifference to competition, Skipper brought a different sensibility, actively monitoring rivals. Attentiveness to competition extended beyond traditional academic journals to include outlets such as The Guardian and Financial Times, all competing for mainstream public attention on scientific developments, particularly during the pandemic. Although Nature held scientific authority, these mainstream outlets commanded greater public reach.\n\nWhile Nature cannot beat these publishing giants on reach, Skipper’s ambition to foster “true multidisciplinarity” does extend its breadth. Throughout history, she observes, Nature has been “multidisciplinary primarily within the natural sciences.” Under Skipper, the journal has expanded into physical sciences, clinical research, social sciences, and engineering. Skipper’s guiding idea is that today’s most pressing questions demand collaboration across fields: “innovation often comes with an element of social sciences,” she says.16\n\nWidening the lens, however, doesn’t mean capturing everything. Skipper advocates for an “ecosystem with different publishing approaches: inclusive and selective.” Not everything requires Nature-level selectivity; there is value in venues for replication, negative results, and less conventionally interesting datasets. Publishing, she contends, is inseparable from research itself: “not thinking about publication when conducting research is a conceptual error,” as research without dissemination has limited value.\n\nFor the critic of scientific publishing, however, it’s the journal itself, no matter how inclusive or reformed, that is the problem. In June 2025, Astera Institute, a nonprofit research organization, announced it would no longer fund traditional journal publications. For Astera, the journal system has flaws so deeply entrenched that they resist reform: publications become final stamps of approval with mistakes rarely corrected, artificial scarcity fuels competition over collaboration, and articles don’t adapt as new evidence emerges, allowing flawed studies to mislead fields for decades.17\n\nWhile quite the indictment, there is merit to many of these complaints. As such, there are reforms that journals can implement that attempt to redress them. One especially illustrative example (although there are others) is retraction. Skipper considers it in Nature’s interest to “clean up [its] own pages.” She views retractions as visible evidence of vigilance rather than hidden embarrassment. Indeed, Springer Nature18 retracted 2,923 papers in 2024, with 61.5 percent addressing historical papers published before January 2023 as part of what the company describes as its commitment to “cleaning up the academic record.”\n\nThat said, these retraction efforts are not as thorough as they sound. This is because the complexity of removal processes and procedural requirements can override editorial judgment and stifle effectiveness. For example, in December 2016, independent researchers published an investigation uncovering nearly 300 fraudulent papers by two Japanese physicians, Yoshihiro Sato and Jun Iwamoto, across 78 journals. Among the publishers implicated was Springer Nature, which (as of 2024) had only retracted 13 of the 45 Sato-Iwamoto papers it had published.\n\nArguably more troubling was that at the Journal of Bone and Mineral Metabolism (a Springer Nature journal), only one of eleven papers was retracted, despite the editors recommending withdrawal, because the institutional investigation remained incomplete. Although the intention to reform may be sincere, procedural dependencies can override editorial judgment.19\n\nUnlike her predecessors, who established Nature as the central hub for international science, Skipper must now defend that position against emerging alternatives in a maturing ecosystem of preprints, open access mandates, and funder defection. What her predecessors could largely take for granted — that a selective, central venue served science well — is itself contested.\n\nUltimately, the question isn’t so much whether Nature deserves its prestige (history shows that much of its success has been circumstantial and opportunistic rather than meritorious) but whether the coordination function it now serves is sufficiently valuable to the scientific ecosystem.\n\nAfter all, in building its prestige, Nature became a vehicle for features that make scientific ecosystems function: international collaboration, multidisciplinarity, rigor and evaluation, and reach. Prestige may connote selectivity, but it speaks more to the broader question of what science is valuable and, as history demonstrates, that question was never answered by merit alone. Elite networks and well-endowed institutions may have shaped Nature’s ascension, but we should not mistake the system that emerged for one that reliably surfaces the best work.\n\nPrestige journals became a default filter, but even that may be fragmenting. As submissions outpace what peer review can absorb, prestige risks becoming a marker of scarcity rather than quality, while scientific discourse migrates to faster venues. Yet coordination without quality control is insufficient. Not all science is equally valuable, and not all scientists have the same amount of integrity. In the era of paper mills, AI slop, and epistemic pollution, whatever system comes next — whether prestige journals or something else entirely — must contend with how to navigate this noise. We have seen one way to do this and understand how we arrived there. We may well need another.\n\nRobert Reason is a Parliamentary Researcher.

    "title": "Why Your New Year's Resolutions Need 'Cues,' According to Science",
    "description": "There's a difference between making a New Year's resolution and actually sticking to one.",
    "fullText": "Thanks to my gig teaching spin classes, I have a front-row seat to a reliable annual phenomenon: My classes are packed for the first few weeks of the year as people make New Year's resolutions—but by mid-February, I'm back to teaching normal-sized groups of people who are grateful the \"January joiners\" have cleared out. I'm always sad to see the new faces go, though, because I do think it's possible to set a New Year's resolution and stick to it, even if it's not the norm.\n\nThere are plenty of self-betterment goals you can set as a new year approaches, both in and out of the gym, but no matter what you endeavor to do, it's important to have an implementation strategy that ensures you'll actually get it done. One way you can better situate yourself for success is by attaching \"cues\" to your resolutions. Here's why it works, and how to do it.\n\nThe more specific your goals are, the better they'll turn out. This is true for pretty much everything, which is why I recommend SMART goals for everything from studying to mapping out your personal productivity roadmap. For the unfamiliar, a SMART goal is a well-defined goal that includes specific, measurable, actionable, realistic, and time-bound elements, like, \"I will meal prep four meals per week every week for the first three months of the year, then determine if I have the capacity to add more or should stay at four.\" Already, you can see how that's better than, \"I will start meal prepping this year\"—but SMART goals are just one option and we have more to explore.\n\nIf you wake up on a Saturday morning and want to tidy up your living space, you'll have more success defining a room you want to clean up than attempting to just generally \"clean the house,\" right? When it comes to New Year's resolutions, that specificity is important, since you're planning for 12 months of change and you'll need some kind of road map. Instead of saying your resolution is to \"eat healthier,\" you should define what your diet is missing, then drill down on it: \"I want to eat 10 more grams of protein every day,\" for example.\n\nThis is where cues are going to become valuable. Research shows that adding a cue—literally, a set trigger for action—to your goals can help you implement them better. On a smaller scale, I've recommended this kind of approach through something called \"habit stacking,\" which you can do when you attach a habit you want to build (like answering all of your outstanding emails every day) with one you already have down pat (like making and drinking your morning coffee). You carry out the new habit while doing the old one and, over time, the new habit becomes engrained, too.\n\nWe rely on automatic processes to do the standard stuff in our daily lives, like how we just automatically turn on the coffee pot after waking up or grab keys on the way out the door. In those cases, waking up and walking out the door are actually cues that signal to our brains it's time to fulfill the second half of the process. Building your resolutions around cues will help them become second-nature habits, too. Here are some examples:\n\nIf your New Year's resolution is to save a certain amount of money by December, make it something like, \"When I spend $X, I'll move $Y into savings.\"\n\nIf you want to be more productive at work, try turning the Pomodoro technique into a resolution: \"When I work for 25 minutes, I'll take a five-minute break.\"\n\n\"When I sit down at my desk, I'll answer all new emails.\"\n\n\"When my meetings end, I'll take five minutes for meditation.\"\n\n\"When work is over, I'll put on my sneakers and head straight to the gym.\"\n\n\"When the 6:00 news ends, I'll call my mom.\"\n\nDoing it this way combines the specificity needed for realistic goal-setting with the tried-and-true method of habit stacking, setting you up for more success than a vague desire to \"work out more\" or \"call home more\" ever could.\n\nThere are a few reasons tying your resolutions to existing cues will help you stick with them. First, you're creating those automatic processes in your brain, basically Pavlov-ing your subconscious self into taking action whenever your trigger occurs. It will take a few weeks of conscious effort, yes, but you will already know when you're supposed to act on your new habit, which is half the battle.\n\nOperating this way also leaves less room for error. If you don't have a defined schedule and cues in place, you can easily forget to do your new task—or maybe even actively avoid it. Sticking reminders into your calendar can help here, too, since the push alert can further emphasize that it's time to get down to business—plus, seeing a visual reminder that you have something to do can stop you from double-booking. If your cue to go to the gym is clocking out at 5, it will take a few weeks for you to get into the habit of declining an invitation to go for after-work drinks, so having it blocked out on the calendar every day after work will keep you on track. You'll need to set yourself up for success by taking a few steps to make sure your cue and action are possible, though. In the example above—\"When work is over, I'll put on my sneakers...\"—you need to have your gym shoes packed in your commute bag for it to work. If you have to go home between the office and the gym, you might not be so easily roused into going back out to complete the workout. My goal over the past few months has been to be more of a morning exerciser. I did a lot of lifestyle restructuring to make that possible, but among the most crucial steps was laying out my activewear, sneakers, and gym accessories the night before so when I wake up, all I have to do is put them on and leave.\n\nStick with your cues, but give yourself some space those first few weeks. You might find that the timing you set up doesn't work well with your existing schedule. You just won't stick to the goal as well if you can't make it work. Research shows that if you're following the cue method, it will take about two months, on average, for the habit to form, so use that time to take note of what's working, what isn't, and what could be changed. If you have a goal of being more connected to friends and family, for instance, you might align your cue to call home with the time you spend doing the dishes every night, only to find you're too tired in the evening or eat out too frequently for that one to stick. Switching the cue to calling home when you get in the car to head to work in the morning might work better. Just make sure you stick to it once you figure out the best timing.",

    "description": "Brian Cox once toured as a keyboardist in major rock and pop bands. Now he’s a particle physicist on a new world tour with a dazzling show he designed in an era of science disinformation and denial.",
    "fullText": "Stefano Montali traveled to Redditch, England, in November to attend a warm-up show for Prof. Brian Cox’s coming world tour.\n\nProf. Brian Cox flashed a wide smile toward the crowd, picked up an iPad, looked up at the enormous screen behind him and started to write out a complex equation. “This is what I call a live math solo,” he said.\n\nThe audience chuckled. Many in the packed theater that night last month in the small English town of Redditch seemed to be in on the joke.\n\nBecause before he became Brian Cox, the particle physicist renowned for his adroitness in explaining the intricacies and magnificence of space, he was Brian Cox the rock star.\n\nHis first professional gig, in fact, was playing keyboards in the opening band on a tour with Jimmy Page, the lead guitarist of Led Zeppelin. His second band, D:Ream, had a song that hit No. 1 on the British pop charts in 1994.\n\nNow, Professor Cox is the star of his own show, albeit one about science.\n\nHe has sold out venues often reserved for sports and pop stars, like Wembley Arena (not the stadium) and the O2 in London. His coming tour, “Emergence,” will take him to places like Singapore, Serbia and Australia, before arriving in the United States in late 2026.\n\n“If you believe, as I do, that science is one of the necessary foundations of society, alongside the arts and politics,” Professor Cox said in an interview, “it has to be there with them on an equal footing.”\n\nWith his geniality, Beatles-esque haircut and a dazzling show that explores black holes, galaxies and the significance — and insignificance — of human beings in the universe, Professor Cox, 57, has reached mainstream audiences, when many scientists cannot.\n\nNeil deGrasse Tyson, the astrophysicist and popular science communicator, said in an interview that Professor Cox, whom he has known for years, “has a force of rationality, and a force of reason, and a force of science.” He added, “Society needs all three, lest we regress back to the caves whence we came.”\n\nIn an era when science denial and disinformation are common, Professor Cox, who teaches particle physics at the University of Manchester, has sought to make science accessible through Peabody Award-winning BBC documentaries and podcasts, books and appearances on other media, like “The Joe Rogan Experience.”\n\nThis year, the United Nations named Professor Cox its Champion for Space, a role in which he will work with the organization to promote space as a “force for progress.”\n\nAs a child, Professor Cox spent many Saturday mornings at the Manchester Airport, near his hometown, Oldham, England, spotting planes with his father. “I liked the engineering, the big machines,” he said. “The Apollo moon landings, astronomy, science fiction — I wanted to see ‘Star Wars,’ ‘Star Trek,’ ‘Alien,’ all of it.”\n\nEventually, Professor Cox’s interests expanded to include music.\n\nAt 18, he deferred going to university for a year to join the band Dare, founded by a member of Thin Lizzy who lived nearby. The band recorded its debut album with A&M Records in Joni Mitchell’s private studio.\n\nAfter one London show where Dare opened for Jimmy Page, Professor Cox said he found himself having a drink backstage with George Harrison.\n\nEven while touring, Professor Cox read popular science books.\n\nHe left Dare at 23 — after a bar fight with his bandmates in Berlin, he said — to study physics and astronomy at the University of Manchester. He soon joined D:Ream, whose No. 1 pop anthem “Things Can Only Get Better” was later appropriated by the Labour Party.\n\nEventually, he left that band to shift his focus to science. Stints at particle accelerators in Hamburg, Chicago and Geneva followed.\n\nIn 2001, Professor Cox met Gia Milinovich, a TV presenter and writer, whom he married two years later at her mother’s house in Duluth, Minn. The pair started writing documentary ideas “with the sole aim of ‘making science part of popular culture,’” she told The Guardian in 2010. Today, they live in London with their 16-year-old son, George.\n\nStill, the draw to the stage never truly left Professor Cox, who eventually found his way back to it.\n\nThe show in Redditch, about 45 minutes south of Birmingham, was the beginning of a slate of warm-up performances. For Professor Cox, they are a chance to work out new material. The show changes night to night.\n\nProfessor Cox’s enthusiasm is as much a character in the show as the planets and the stars. He kept the audience captivated, even on topics that might seem out of reach, like the origin of space and time or quantum entanglement.\n\nDavid Attenborough, whose nature documentaries on the BBC helped carve out a place for science presenters on television, said in 2013, “If I had a torch, I would hand it to Brian Cox.”\n\nBut the worlds in which Mr. Attenborough first rose to fame and in which Professor Cox works now couldn’t be more different. Disinformation on social media has contributed to a growing skepticism of experts.\n\n“Our instinct, which is a good instinct,” Professor Cox said, “is to say, ‘I want to listen to as many voices as possible.’” Still, he stressed that there needed to be a weighting to people who have expertise.\n\nBut his expertise has been poached by hyper-realistic deepfakes. Days before the Redditch show, several appeared online depicting him falsely claiming that the 3I/ATLAS comet, which was passing through the solar system, was an alien spacecraft.\n\nThe mother of a friend of his was so convinced by the deepfake that she was “starting to hoard things,” Professor Cox said the friend told him.\n\nWith the deepfakes multiplying and looking increasingly realistic, the effort to take them down can feel like full-time job, he said.\n\nEarlier in his career, Professor Cox made light of conspiracies.\n\nWhile he was working in Geneva at CERN on the Large Hadron Collider, or LHC, several doomsday theories circulated online claiming the accelerator could cause the end of the universe by creating microscopic black holes.\n\n“My first instinct was to laugh it off,” Professor Cox said. He told the The Daily Telegraph that “anyone who thinks the LHC will destroy the world” is a fool, though he used a word that many find offensive.\n\nIt caused an uproar. “It’s probably my most famous quote,” Professor Cox said.\n\nBut he says he came to understand of conspiracy theories that it’s important to be sensitive that even if people believe in something that isn’t true, the strong emotion that belief can evoke — panic or fear, in the case of the collider — is real.\n\n“If people are getting information that’s saying that there’s a chance that the world will be destroyed,” he said, “it’s not silly to be worried about that.”\n\nHe has appeared three times in the past decade on Joe Rogan’s podcast. While he acknowledges that Mr. Rogan and his guests have indulged in conspiracy theories or denial about climate change and other accepted science, Professor Cox regards the appearances as an opportunity to reach an important new audience.\n\nAt the start of his show in Redditch, Professor Cox appeared in front of a projection of the Charles Bridge in Prague on a snowy night, and he told the story of how the astronomer Johannes Kepler pondered the physical makeup of a six-pointed snowflake. Eventually, the visual zoomed deeper and deeper into one of the falling snowflakes, revealing its intricacy.\n\nAs he stood to the side of the stage in the dark, Professor Cox described how Kepler’s bridge walk, along with Galileo’s discovery of Jupiter’s four largest moons, contributed to a revolution in science — a refocusing away from the reliance on ancient knowledge and toward the modern method of observation and questioning.\n\nThat drive for discovery, Professor Cox said, lies at the center of his show and at the heart of his questions. How do we acquire reliable knowledge? How do we remove our opinion and biases?\n\n“Certainty is kind of a brutish thing,” he said, “it doesn’t really get you anywhere.”\n\nAs for the music world, Professor Cox still has a toe in. He reunited with D:Ream, onstage at the Glastonbury Festival in 2024. And at another event, he said, he was approached by a fan who expressed his awe at a show Professor Cox had done about Enceladus, one of Saturn’s moons.",

    "description": "This year saw new AI models, transformative products and new breakthroughs in science and robotics.",
    "fullText": "This was a year of AI agents, reasoning and scientific discovery.\n\n2025 has been a year of extraordinary progress in research. With artificial intelligence, we can see its trajectory shifting from a tool to a utility: from something people use to something they can put to work. If 2024 was about laying the multimodal foundations for this era, 2025 was the year AI began to really think, act and explore the world alongside us. With quantum computing, we made progress towards real-world applications. And across the board, we helped turn research into reality, with more capable and useful products and tools making a positive impact on people's lives today.\n\nHere’s a look back at some of the breakthroughs, products and scientific milestones that defined the work of Google, Google DeepMind and Google Research in a year of relentless progress.\n\nThis year, we significantly advanced our model capabilities with breakthroughs on reasoning, multimodal understanding, model efficiency, and generative capabilities, beginning with the release of Gemini 2.5 in March and culminating in the November launch of Gemini 3 and the December launch of Gemini 3 Flash.\n\nBuilt on a foundation of state-of-the-art reasoning, Gemini 3 Pro is our most powerful model to date, designed to help you bring any idea to life. It topped the LMArena Leaderboard and redefined multimodal reasoning with breakthrough scores on benchmarks like Humanity’s Last Exam — a fiendishly hard test for AI models to see if AI can truly think and reason like humans — and GPQA Diamond. It also set a new standard for frontier models in mathematics, achieving a new state-of-the-art of 23.4% on MathArena Apex. We followed shortly with Gemini 3 Flash, which combines Gemini 3's Pro-grade reasoning with Flash-level latency, efficiency and cost, making it the most performant model for its size. Gemini 3 Flash's quality surpasses our previous Gemini 2.5 Pro-scale model's capabilities at a fraction of the price and substantially better latency, continuing our Gemini-era trend of 'the next generation's Flash model is better than the previous generation's Pro model'.\n\nLearn more about our progress on our world-class AI models this year:\n\nGemini 3 Flash price & benchmark table.\n\nWe’re committed to making useful AI technology accessible, with state-of-the-art open models. We built our Gemma family of models to be lightweight and open for public use; this year we were able to introduce multimodal capabilities, significantly increase the context window, expand multilingual capabilities, and improve efficiency and performance.\n\nLearn more about this year’s advances in Gemma models:\n\nThroughout 2025, we continued to advance the trajectory of AI from tool to utility, transforming our portfolio of products with new, powerful agentic capabilities. We reimagined software development by moving beyond tools that assist coding to introducing powerful, agentic systems that collaborate with developers. Key advances, such as the impressive coding capabilities in Gemini 3 and the launch of Google Antigravity, mark a new era in AI-assisted software development.\n\nLearn more about this year’s advances building developer tools:\n\nThis evolution was also clear across our core products, from AI-enabled features on the Pixel 10 and updates to AI Mode in Search, to AI-first innovations like the Gemini app and NotebookLM, which gained advanced features like Deep Research.\n\nLearn more about how we’ve transformed our products with AI:\n\n2025 was a transformative year for generative media, giving people new and unprecedented capabilities to realize their creative ambitions. Generative media models and tools for video, images, audio and worlds became more effective and broadly used, with breakouts Nano Banana and Nano Banana Pro offering unprecedented capabilities for native image generation and editing. We worked with people in creative industries to develop tools like Flow and Music AI Sandbox, making them more helpful for creative workflows, and we expanded creative possibilities for people with new, AI-powered experiences in the Google Arts & Culture lab, major upgrades to image editing within the Gemini app, and the introduction of powerful new generative media models like Veo 3.1, Imagen 4 and Flow.\n\nLearn more about how we’re building AI to enhance creativity:\n\nAs research breakthroughs continue to expand AI’s capabilities, Google Labs is where we share AI experiments as we develop them – hearing from users and evolving as we learn. Some of this year’s most engaging experiments from Labs: Pomelli, an AI experiment for on-brand marketing content; Stitch, which introduced a way to turn prompt and image inputs into complex UI designs and frontend code in minutes; Jules, an asynchronous coding agent that acts as a collaborative partner for developers; and Google Beam, a 3D video communications platform that used AI to advance the possibilities of remote presence.\n\nLearn more about how we’re experimenting in Labs:\n\n2025 was also a banner year for scientific advances with AI, marked by breakthroughs in life sciences, health, natural sciences, and mathematics.\n\nIn the space of a year, we made progress in building AI resources and tools that empower researchers and help them understand, identify, and develop treatments in healthcare. In genomics, where we’ve been applying advanced technology to research for 10 years, we moved beyond sequencing, using AI to interpret the most complex data. We also marked the 5-year anniversary of AlphaFold, the Nobel-winning AI system that solved the 50-year-old protein folding problem. AlphaFold has been used by over 3 million researchers in more than 190 countries, including over 1 million users in low- and middle-income countries.\n\nLearn more about how we’re using AI to advance life sciences and health:\n\nGemini’s advanced thinking capabilities, including Deep Think, also enabled historic progress in mathematics and coding. Deep Think was able to solve problems that require deep abstract reasoning – achieving gold medal-standard in two international contests.\n\nLearn more about how we’re advancing natural sciences and mathematics:\n\nWe’re also leading major discoveries and shaping the future of science in areas like quantum computing, energy and moonshots. Research in this area drew new levels of public attention, with progress towards real-world applications of quantum computing as demonstrated by Quantum Echoes and, notably, Googler Michel Devoret becoming a 2025 Physics Nobel Laureate along with former Googler John Martinis and UC Berkeley’s John Clarke, for their foundational 1980s quantum research.\n\nLearn more about our work on space infrastructure and quantum computing:\n\nIn 2025, we continued to advance the core infrastructure that powers our AI, focusing on breakthroughs in hardware design and improving energy efficiency. This included the introduction of Ironwood, a new TPU built for the age of inference, which was designed using a method called AlphaChip, alongside a commitment to measuring the environmental impact of our technology.\n\nLearn more about how we’re using AI to develop chips, infrastructure and improve energy efficiency:\n\nOur work in robotics and visual understanding brought AI agents into both the physical and virtual worlds, with advancements like the foundational Gemini Robotics models, the more sophisticated Gemini Robotics 1.5, and the introduction of Genie 3 as a new frontier for general-purpose world models.\n\nLearn more about our work with world models and robotics:\n\nOur work throughout 2025 demonstrates how AI-enabled scientific progress is being directly applied to address the world's most critical and pervasive challenges. By leveraging state-of-the-art foundational models and agentic reasoning, we are significantly increasing our understanding of the planet and its systems, while also delivering impactful solutions in areas vital to human flourishing, including climate resilience, public health and education.\n\nFor example, we are using state-of-the-art foundational models and agentic reasoning to help increase our understanding of the planet, helping enable work that is making a difference in people’s lives now from weather predictions to urban planning to public health. For example, our flood forecasting information now covers more than two billion people in 150 countries for severe riverine floods. And our most advanced and efficient forecasting model, WeatherNext 2 can generate forecasts 8x faster and with resolution up to 1-hour. Using this technology, we’ve supported weather agencies in making decisions based on a range of scenarios through our experimental cyclone predictions.\n\nLearn more about our work in weather, mapping and wildfires:\n\nWe are working with partners to apply AI-enabled scientific progress closer to patients, opening up new avenues for disease management and therapeutic discovery.\n\nLearn more about our health-related work:\n\nAI is proving to be a powerful tool in education, enabling new forms of understanding and expanding curiosity through initiatives like LearnLM and Guided Learning in Gemini. We brought Gemini’s most powerful translation capabilities to Google Translate, enabling much smarter, more natural and accurate translations and piloting new speech to speech translation capabilities.\n\nLearn more about how we’re using AI to enable learning:\n\nWe couple our research breakthroughs with rigorous and forward-looking work on responsibility and safety. As our models grow more capable, we’re continuing to advance and evolve our tools, resources and safety frameworks to anticipate and mitigate risk. Gemini 3 demonstrated this approach in action: it's our most secure model yet, and has undergone the most comprehensive set of safety evaluations of any Google AI model to date. And we’re looking further ahead, exploring a responsible path to AGI, prioritizing readiness, proactive risk assessment, and collaboration with the wider AI community.\n\nLearn more about our responsibility and safety work:\n\nAdvancing the frontier of AI responsibly demands collaboration across all parts of society. In 2025, we worked with leading AI labs to help to form the Agentic AI Foundation and support open standards to ensure a responsible and interoperable future for agentic AI. In education, we’ve partnered with school districts like Miami Dade County and education groups like Raspberry Pi to equip students with AI skills. Our research partnerships with universities like UC Berkeley, Yale, the University of Chicago and many more have been instrumental to some of this year’s most exciting frontier research, and we’re working with the US Department of Energy’s 17 national laboratories to transform how scientific research is conducted. And we’re working with filmmakers and other creative visionaries to put the best AI tools in their hands and explore storytelling in the age of AI.\n\nLearn more about our work on frontier collaboration:\n\nAs we look towards 2026, we’re looking forward to continuing to advance the frontier, safely and responsibly, for the benefit of humanity.",

    "description": "From sports to chemistry to fieldwork abroad, Wall Street's Rising Stars harnessed experiences far afield to scale top banks and asset managers.",
    "fullText": "Before he ever worked in finance, Cardinez thought he'd play professional football. When that didn't happen, he found a way to remain close to the action — interning at Madison Square Garden, joining the 2014 Super Bowl host committee, and completing the NFL's rotational program across media, business development, and strategy.\n\nHe thought he'd stay there and ascend the ranks. But he decided on a different path that seemed to align more with his interests: finance.\n\nAfter earning his MBA and working in investment banking, he joined Blue Owl's HomeCourt Partners, a fund established with the NBA to buy minority stakes in teams.\n\nCardinez has since worked on multiple franchise deals, including the Phoenix Suns' $4 billion sale and a 2024 transaction involving the Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\nKress' path to high finance began in academic research, studying anthropology and psychology at Notre Dame and conducting fieldwork in Sierra Leone before pursuing graduate work on Angola's energy sector at the University of Oxford. She later worked at political research and consultancy firm, Eurasia Group, training investors to integrate geopolitical risk into decision-making.\n\nKress came to BlackRock first as an advisor to Tom Donilon, the former US national security advisor, a post she called a \"dream job.\" She helped Donilon elevate the firm's geopolitics function into a permanent part of the BlackRock Investment Institute.\n\nBut she didn't stop there. This year, Kress was named the chief of staff to Larry Fink, the firm's powerful CEO. She told Business Insider that this new job was the \"culmination\" of her career, offering \"unparalleled exposure\" to global policymakers and business leaders.\n\nJack Levendoski, JPMorgan Chase\n\nLevendoski grew up all over the world — from Louisiana to London, Nigeria, Indonesia, and Australia — before beginning his career as a facilities engineering project manager at Chevron.\n\nIn that role, he supported offshore oil and gas work in the Gulf of Mexico. Levendoski later moved into investment banking and is now an executive director in JPMorgan's M&A group, advising on high-profile technology and software transactions.\n\nMenasche admits he didn't always feel like a natural fit for the finance industry — he didn't grow up in a household of bankers, he said, and he studied chemistry and math at Cambridge. But after trying academic research, he found the lab's pace too slow. That realization led him to roles that blended analytical work with more day-to-day momentum, eventually steering him into secondaries.\n\nToday, Menasche is a managing director and global cohead of Goldman Sachs' private capital and liquidity solutions group, working across real estate, infrastructure, private equity, and venture capital transactions.\n\nJackie Shepherd, Morgan Stanley\n\nBefore joining the ranks of Wall Street, Shepherd spent years competing in Division I golf, earning a full-ride scholarship and captaining the University of Minnesota's team. She began her career in accounting at EY's international tax practice, where she first encountered investment banking.\n\n\"I didn't realize that there was an intersection between the two,\" she told Business Insider. \"I wanted to be the person coming up with more of the cool ideas.\" So she made the pivot to Wall Street.\n\nAfter holding roles at Goldman Sachs and Citi, she joined Morgan Stanley's separations and structured solutions group. Shepherd has worked on roughly $250 billion in transactions, including Comcast's pending carve-out of its cable networks.\n\nGolf, she said, remains a key part of her life, adding that aspires to play on all seven continents.",

    "fullText": "Like many of his US counterparts, the Russian science prodigy turned hugely successful ‘digital populist’ has a deep suspicion of government constraint\n\nTech visionary, Kremlin dissident, FSB agent, free speech absolutist, health guru. These are just some of the labels admirers and critics have attached to Pavel Durov over the past decade.\n\nThe Russian-born tech entrepreneur founded Russia’s version of Facebook before going on to create the messaging app Telegram, launch a cryptocurrency ecosystem and amass a multibillion-dollar fortune, all while clashing repeatedly with authorities in Russia and beyond.\n\nBut much of Durov’s real story – and the logic that drives him – remains obscured.\n\nA new biography aims to change that.\n\nThe Populist, by the independent Russian writer Nikolay Kononov, traces the 41-year-old’s rise from a St Petersburg schoolboy science prodigy to the founder of Telegram, one of the world’s most influential communications platforms, which has more than a billion users.\n\nKononov describes the book as the product of a 14-year attempt to map Durov’s strategy and mindset, drawing on conversations with Durov himself and people who worked with him, as well as rivals and critics.\n\nThe book’s title, he said, refers to a thread running through Durov’s life: his desire to address Telegram’s millions of users directly, allowing him to bypass institutions, the press and any system of representation.\n\n“Durov is one of the first digital populists,” Kononov said in an interview, explaining that “from the very beginning, as soon as he started making his digital products, he programmed into them the ability to write and communicate his ideas directly to his audience.”.\n\nBoth VKontakte, Durov’s first venture, and Telegram have at times pushed messages from Durov directly to all users, including users who had not opted in, outlining his libertarian worldview.\n\n“He sees himself as a visionary. And obviously wants to be heard,” the author said.\n\nThat strategy has helped promote Durov’s central promise – almost absolute freedom of expression – even as Telegram has become a go-to tool for dissidents, extremists, scammers and war propagandists.\n\nIf Durov’s public brand is built on libertarianism, Kononov says his private management style points in the opposite direction: power concentrated in one man’s hands, with few visible checks.\n\n“He is essentially the only one making all the product decisions at Telegram,” Kononov said. “Marketing, PR – it’s a one-man show.”\n\nThe portrait he draws is of a tech founder whose worldview has not wavered over the years, remaining most comfortable within an ultra-libertarian, anti-institutional strand of the right that is often misogynistic and, at times, conspiratorial.\n\n“What surprised me most is that Durov hasn’t changed or evolved in all the years that I have interviewed him,” Kononov said.\n\nDurov is not an outlier, Kononov writes, but part of a broader new wave of moguls – most visibly in the US – who pair technological dominance with an outsized sense of personal mythology and a deep suspicion of government constraint.\n\nLike Elon Musk, Peter Thiel and Jeff Bezos, he has shown a strong interest in longevity science as well as pronatalism, the belief that having as many children as possible is a social or civilisational duty.\n\nDurov does not drink or use drugs, Kononov says, regularly dispenses spartan health advice – often alongside photos of him shirtless – and has said he has fathered dozens of children through sperm donation.\n\nOne of the book’s most striking sections tells for the first time of Durov’s tense early meeting with President Vladimir Putin in 2014, held behind closed doors.\n\nKononov writes that Durov described the encounter as a one-way conversation, in which the Kremlin leader reprimanded him over illegal content on Vkontakte and suggested that Durov leave the country.\n\nUnder pressure from the authorities, Durov sold his stake in Vkontakte, left Russia and eventually settled in Dubai, where he founded Telegram.\n\nBut the clearest mark on Durov in recent years, Kononov suggests, came not from Russia but from France.\n\nDurov, who also holds French citizenship, was detained and held for three days in France in August last year as part of an investigation into crimes linked to Telegram, including the circulation of child sexual abuse images, drug trafficking and fraudulent transactions.\n\nHis detention came as a shock to the tech mogul. In interviews conducted in Paris after his arrest, Durov described to Kononov a harsh, disorienting ordeal – a permanently lit cell and little sleep – that rattled a man who had spent years insulating himself from the reach of the state.\n\nIt also appears to have sharpened his hostility towards the west. Kononov says Durov now frames Europe as sliding toward “total digital control”, and increasingly conspiratorial rhetoric.\n\nMost recently, Durov appeared to endorse a conspiracy theory promoted by the far-right blogger Candace Owens, suggesting that Paris was behind the killing of Charlie Kirk.\n\n“What interests me about Durov is that, on the one hand, he clearly has a very high IQ,” Kononov said. “But at the same time, he is prone to conspiracy theories.”\n\nKononov is adamant, however, that Durov’s views should not be conflated with formal political allegiances.\n\nOne of the most persistent claims surrounding Durov is that he is secretly aligned with Russian security services.\n\nBut Kononov said that in the course of his research, he found no evidence that Durov has worked with, or on behalf of, the Russian state. “He has a huge number of flaws – but not the sin of Telegram acting as a backdoor for the FSB,” Kononov said.\n\nKononov argues that what Durov has ultimately learned is the need to compromise – with both Russian and western authorities – when it serves his interests and allows Telegram to continue operating.\n\nKononov recalls Durov once telling him: “I never waste time on things that are unnecessary or that cannot be useful to me personally.” That self-serving mindset, Kononov said, ultimately ended their personal relationship.\n\nAbout a year ago, the writer asked Durov whether he saw a contradiction between Telegram’s highly centralised, almost authoritarian internal structure and his professed devotion to freedom of expression. After that, Durov stopped responding.\n\n“He quickly realised it wasn’t going to be a book to his liking,” Kononov said.",

This paper examines the negativity within AI ethics through a philosophy of science lens. The prevailing negativity is a result of the particular way the discipline is institutionally organized, which pressures AI ethicists to portray AI in a critical light. As a consequence, the overall picture of AI offered by the AI ethics community is one-sided and negatively biased. We should be skeptical about the negative narrative promoted by AI ethics and explore ways of reforming the system.",

    "fullText": "It's exciting to shop for kids, especially around the holidays, but it can be overwhelming with all the options available. I'm a mom to a 3-year-old and a 6-year-old, and I work in a scientific research lab, so I gravitate toward toys that can be both educational and fun.\n\nOver the years, my kids have tried out a lot of STEM-based toys. These are the ones that they return to again and again, and they also happen to be ones that I know are challenging their brains in all the right ways.\n\nI bought this Highlights cookbook for my son last Easter, and have since purchased a handful more to gift to friends and relatives. My 6-year-old frequently requests to make recipes from this cookbook, which covers a wide range of scientific topics.\n\nEach recipe has a scientific description alongside it, and the recipes range from easy (building a pyramid with cheese cubes and grapes, teaching basic engineering skills) to multiple-step (think along the lines of chocolate chip cookies — an opportunity to talk about chemical reactions and how baking soda leavens the cookies), so there's something for everyone (even if you're not prepared!).\n\nMy parents have gifted a few Poraxy and Yutin STEM wood building kits — vehicles, more vehicles, and lanterns — to my kids. While geared more toward ages 8 and up, my younger kids enjoy making these kits with help from an adult.\n\nMany of the kits run on batteries, but there's also a solar-charged helicopter and car that you can use to discuss the differences in power, as well as the building concepts.\n\nThe Ferris wheel model uses slow gears and a fast motor, introducing gear speed reduction. The kits involve attaching wires (positive and negative) to battery power, teaching simple polarity (which end of the battery is positive or negative?). My kids enjoy playing with the vehicles, and the lanterns are often used at bedtime.\n\nMy kids often love to grab a Snap Circuit kit, labeled for ages 8 to 108, when we visit our local library. Our branch has the kit in a large plastic carrying case, available to check out upon request. I like to borrow the kit a few times a year as a special activity during school breaks or when the weather is poor, and my kids are always excited to bring it home.\n\nMy son and daughter are able to work on the circuit board with a little help from me. The kit has a variety of build setups, some reminiscent of physics labs I did in school, but you can also create your own setups.\n\nThis toy teaches how practical objects, such as an alarm, a switch, or a lightbulb, work. Beyond the basics of electricity, physics, and engineering, this kit also encourages critical thinking.\n\n\"Turn, Crank, Zoom!\" is a book that I have repeatedly bought as a gift for toddlers. The text encourages young readers to turn the gears in certain directions or ways to see what happens. The book focuses on colors and motor skills, evoking a sense of curiosity, while being illustrated in the Eric Carle style that kids gravitate toward.\n\nRecommended for ages 3 and up, Quercetti Kaleido Gears give kids the freedom to explore. The gears and axles attach to a board, which kids can connect to a crank to see simple mechanical reactions as the gears move.\n\nThese gears could make a great gift to accompany the Eric Carle book. There is also a boxed set aimed toward ages 5 to 12, which includes chains and other components that require finer motor skills. The kits are interchangeable, so both of my kids can play with the gears together.\n\nMarble run toys have been created in all sorts of designs, and my kids have access to multiple versions.\n\nMy son enjoys playing with a bath marble run set, which features pieces with suction cups that attach to the wall. The bath set requires more structural design planning than traditional marble runs, as the pieces must fit flat against the wall.\n\nOur friends own one of the more advanced GraviTrax marble run systems — those can be quite the puzzle, even as an adult! The junior GraviTrax set will be wrapped under our Christmas tree this year.",

    "fullText": "Researchers have homed in on a single gut microbe that acts to prevent fat gain, even with a high-fat diet. The discovery adds to the booming science of finding ways to enlist the microbes that already live in our bodies to help us improve our health.\n\nIt's been known for some time that our gut microbiome – the collection of bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other microscopic critters living in our intestines – can influence weight gain or loss. But narrowing down exactly which members of this microbial community do what can take some effort to tease out. That's because microbes that live inside the body don't do well outside of it, so to test them, they often have to be processed inside airtight environments, because oxygen can often kill them. This takes time.\n\nHowever, researchers at the University of Utah (U of U) say they have succeeded in whittling down about 100 bacteria suspected of fighting weight gain to just one that really does: Turicibacter.\n\nIn their study, mice that were fed a high-fat diet and were also given Turicibacter saw reduced blood sugar, lower levels of fat in the blood, and less overall weight gain compared to a control group.\n\n\"I didn’t think one microbe would have such a dramatic effect – I thought it would be a mix of three or four,\" says June Round, professor of microbiology and immunology at U of U Health, and senior author on the study. \"So when [Kendra Klag] brought me the first experiment with Turicibacter and the mice were staying really lean, I was like, 'This is so amazing.' It's pretty exciting when you see those types of results.\" Klag is the first author on the study.\n\nThe reason why the bacteria was successful in keeping fat-fed mice thin is due to a feedback loop based on fatty molecules called ceramides. These molecules increase on a high-fat diet and, as they accumulate, they not only cause the gut to increase its absorption of dietary fat, but they push the body toward higher storage of that fat. They also spike blood sugar levels, which leads to insulin resistance. This is why elevated ceramide levels have been linked to type 2 diabetes and heart disease. In some studies, in fact, they've been shown to be better predictors of cardiovascular disease than LDL cholesterol.\n\nSomewhat paradoxically, Turicibacter bacteria also produce lipids (fats) in the gut. But the molecules they produce actually tamp down the rise of ceramides, even in the face of high-fat consumption. Furthermore, when a high-fat diet is consumed, it drowns Turicibacter, eliminating its protective effects. In humans with obesity for example, Turicibacter levels in the gut have been found to be reduced.\n\nRegular supplementation in the study, however, kept the levels of Turicibacter-produced fats high and the mice slim and healthy. The researchers admit that it remains to be seen if the same results carry over to humans, but point to its potential in engineering new ways to combat weight gain.\n\n\"Identifying what lipid is having this effect is going to be one of the most important future directions, both from a scientific perspective because we want to understand how it works, and from a therapeutic standpoint,\" says Round. \"Perhaps we could use this bacterial lipid, which we know really doesn't have a lot of side effects because people have it in their guts, as a way to keep a healthy weight.\"\n\n\"With further investigation of individual microbes, we will be able to make microbes into medicine and find bacteria that are safe to create a consortium of different bugs that people with different diseases might be lacking,\" Klag adds.\n\nThe research has been published in the journal Cell Metabolism.",

    "description": "People were outraged by the president's recent use of this particular expression. Experts in political science and mental health say the term tells quite the story.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump recently leveled one of his commonly used terms in a statement attacking iconic actor and director Rob Reiner shortly after he and his wife, Michele Singer, were found dead at their home on Sunday.\n\nThe president took to his Truth Social platform on Monday to seize on the opportunity to slam Rob Reiner, who was a critic of Trump, and for baselessly attributing the Hollywood filmmaker’s death to “Trump Derangement Syndrome” — a phrase Trump and his supporters often use to attack those who criticize the president, his policies and his rhetoric.\n\nLife: Psychologists React To THAT Post From Trump About Rob Reiner's Death\n\n“Rob Reiner, a tortured and struggling, but once very talented movie director and comedy star, has passed away, together with his wife, Michele, reportedly due to the anger he caused others through his massive, unyielding, and incurable affliction with a mind crippling disease known as TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME, sometimes referred to as TDS,” Trump wrote in part on the social media platform.\n\nTrump’s vile post about Reiner garnered wide condemnation, with many on social media describinghis remarks as“disgusting.” Rocker Jack White took to Instagram to slam the president, writing: “Trump you disgusting, vile, egomaniac, loser, child. Neither he nor any one of his followers can defend this gross, horrible insult to a beautiful artist who gave the world so much.”\n\nThe president also garnered a rare rebuke from many MAGA supporters and a number of the president’s most loyal advocates. He was further criticized when he doubled down on his attacks on Reiner while speaking to reporters at the Oval Office hours later.\n\nThe concept of a so-called “derangement syndrome” has been used against critics of past presidents before. But Trump has a history of frequently using the phrase against his naysayers himself. He had also used the expression against those who opposed him during his first term as president.\n\nLife: How To Do That 'Defying Gravity' Riff Without Murdering Your Voice\n\nAlexandra Cromer, a licensed professional counselor with Thriveworks, believes that Trump’s habit of leveling the phrase “Trump Derangement Syndrome” reveals a lot about his leadership style.\n\n“It reveals that he is not a leader that values, welcomes, or is willing to receive feedback,” she told HuffPost. “This also is a behavior pattern that we see in people with narcissistic tendencies; projection of perceived criticism onto someone else.”\n\nCromer explained that by Trump calling his critics “deranged,” he’s essentially seeking to undermine “the authenticity of the feedback.”\n\n“This reveals that his leadership style is very rigid and very one-dimensional. He is the one to give directions and all others must comply,” she said. “This is a tremendously unhealthy way to receive criticism or any other form of feedback. Psychologically, we know that feedback is critical to not only growth [and] prosperity, but overall health and wellness.”\n\nLife: The Funniest Posts From Women This Week (Dec. 6-12)\n\nShe later continued, “shutting down criticism by engaging in stereotyping and blaming of the source can also be viewed as abusive behavior — that is, behavior that attempts to inflict psychological harm and maintain power structures.”\n\nHallie Kritsas, a licensed mental health counselor and therapist with Thriveworks who specializes in self-esteem, workplace issues and anxiety, told HuffPost that she believes the term “Trump Derangement Syndrome” is “polarizing and emotionally activating.”\n\n“It comes across as a threat and will more than likely increase stress and divide groups in two different ones versus unifying them,” she said.\n\nJacob Neiheisel, associate professor of political science at the University at Buffalo College of Arts and Sciences, told HuffPost that he thinks Trump’s frequent use of the phrase is “meant to be dismissive of his opposition” and intended to “give his followers cover for dismissing similar criticisms that they might hear.”\n\nLife: The Most Popular Dog Names Of 2025\n\n“I think his use of the term reflects his deep-seated disdain for dissent,” he said. “Trump’s leadership style is certainly not one that is welcoming of a ‘team of rivals’ type of approach, but rather one that demands loyalty and a willingness to do political combat on his behalf.”\n\nNeiheisel thinks that the “Trump Derangement Syndrome” phrase has caught on with so many Trump supporters because it “allows them to adopt a similar orientation toward dissent in their own social environments.”\n\n“Simply dismissing the opposition as having a form of mental illness allows them to protect their own attitudes and beliefs, inoculating them against any negativity directed toward Trump,” he added.\n\nNeiheisel thinks that Trump’s attack on Reiner after his death hit “a new low.”\n\nLife: We Asked Actual Historians About Trump's New Plaques — And They Have THOUGHTS\n\n“Republicans had the moral high ground in the wake of Charlie Kirk’s murder and were able to use the negative things said about Kirk after his death to attack Democrats,” he said. “With Trump’s response, that high ground is gone. I think that’s why we saw a number of Republicans condemning Trump’s remarks.”\n\nKritsas believes that Trump’s statements about the iconic director “violated what some might view as a time to grieve and have decency in a moment of loss.”\n\nCromer said that Trump’s harsh words for Reiner was likely particularly upsetting to so many people because the filmmaker was a “universally liked person.”\n\n“While Rob was not a perfect person (because nobody is), he demonstrated consistent prosocial behavior patterns and centered his personal values at the forefront of his personal and professional life,” she said.\n\n“Further, Trump’s remarks state a belief that someone was murdered because they didn’t like Trump; an assertion that can be viewed as narcissistic by inserting himself into a situation that had nothing to do with him in any contextual way,” she continued.\n\nCromer later added that overall, Trump’s remarks about Reiner “communicates a lack of respect for psychological and personal boundaries for those affected by this incident.”\n\nMedical Examiner Report States Rob And Michele Reiner’s Cause Of Death\n\n2 Of Rob Reiner's Children Release Statement On Parents' Deaths\n\nTrump Blames Rob Reiner For His Own Death In Truth Social Post",

    "description": "Trump’s AI “Manhattan Project” will fail if DOGE cuts are kept, critics say.",
    "fullText": "Described as a “historic national effort” to “invest in AI-enabled science to accelerate scientific advancement,” Trump claimed his mission would address key challenges to American energy dominance, innovation, and national security.\n\nThis mission, Trump boasted, would be a game-changer to science akin to putting a man on the moon or firing the first nuclear weapons. By building “an integrated AI platform” trained on “the world’s largest collection” of federal scientific data sets, he promised, the government could set off cascades of scientific breakthroughs.\n\nAccess to such a platform, Trump imagined, would supercharge top US labs, powering AI agents to do tasks like quickly test hypotheses and automate research workflows to speed up discoveries.\n\nHowever, the mission crucially depends on strengthening collaboration between public, private, and academic sectors. And Trump’s order is concerningly vague on how those partnerships will be structured and funded at a time when many scientists have been sidelined due to a flurry of Trump orders earlier this year that eliminated their funding or removed them from their labs.\n\nTo critics, including scientists, policy experts, advocates, and historians, Trump’s order seems divorced from reality, given that he spent the past year attacking some of the very institutions the Genesis Mission would seem to depend on. Trump also seemed unclear about what can be achieved with AI and confused about how scientific progress is actually made, some critics suggested.\n\nAmong the critics was Arati Prabhakar, who served as the director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy under the Biden administration. Prabhakar told Ars that Trump’s crippling cuts to government science agencies, research grant funding freezes, and attacks on universities must be repaired or his mission will fail.\n\n“After the Trump administration has inflicted so much damage to valuable datasets and publicly funded research, the new executive order is a Band-Aid on a giant gash,” Prabhakar said.\n\nAlso skeptical of Trump’s plans is Kathryn Kelley, executive director for the Coalition for Academic Scientific Computation, an educational nonprofit representing more than 100 of “the nation’s most forward-thinking universities and computing centers,” CASC’s LinkedIn said.\n\nHer group is specifically dedicated to Genesis Mission-aligned goals, “advocating for the use of the most advanced computing technology to accelerate scientific discovery for national competitiveness, global security, and economic success.” And while Trump’s initiative could be considered “a step in the right direction,” Kelley told Ars that she shares Prabhakar’s concerns.\n\n“Many research institutions and national laboratories continue to experience funding uncertainty, program disruptions, and workforce instability stemming from earlier cuts,” Kelley told Ars.\n\nParticular pain points considered critical to address for Genesis Mission to move forward include reversing “impacts on staffing, ongoing research, and student pipelines,” she suggested.\n\nIn one prominent example, some Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) cuts targeting workers at the National Science Foundation hit hardest in the branch designed to accelerate technology development across a wide range of research settings in the US. DOGE slashed workers there simply because it was the youngest directorate at NSF with the most workers in transition when Trump took office. As courts weighed legal challenges to cuts, whistleblowers warned that Trump was aiming to politicize and dismantle NSF.\n\n“Large-scale initiatives like Genesis rely on highly skilled personnel, robust infrastructure, and sustained program support—some of the very resources at NSF and other federal agencies that were disrupted,” Kelley told Ars. “Rebuilding trust, re-establishing lost programs, and stabilizing the research workforce will be essential to make this mission feasible.”\n\nCritics urged that Trump’s attacks on science also included messing with government datasets that scientists depend on. Since Trump’s second term started, scientists have watched valuable data get censored or scrubbed from government websites. Some researchers have rushed to recreate datasets independently with the help of the Internet Archive.\n\nPrabhakar pointed out that some “datasets that could improve health and prevent disasters are eroding or even disappearing due to this administration,” while universities training “the next generation of great researchers and innovators have reduced or even stopped graduate admissions because of Trump’s assault.”\n\nWithout a massive undertaking to undo moves that critics have said undermined both US science and trust in it, Trump’s dreams of launching AI models that would propel a million moonshots could go down in history as merely hype.\n\n“Without robust data and research and without people’s trust, America won’t lead in AI,” Prabhakar said.\n\nFor people in the science community, it’s hard to square Trump’s aggressive cuts from earlier this year with the broad ambition of Genesis Mission. Frustratingly, the president demands that scientists make discoveries on his timeline, without acknowledging AI’s limitations or how his attacks on science could be driving away talent that could help labs advance AI.\n\nIn many fields, scientists are still exploring how AI can aid research. Trump’s order appears to politicize science by focusing on areas he favors—like critical materials, nuclear energy, biotechnology, and quantum computing—despite their limited AI applications or data-quality challenges. Meanwhile, critics noted that it overlooks areas where “supercharging” AI could perhaps be more impactful—but where Trump notably does not want to leave his mark—like climate science or vaccine research.\n\nIt also lays out aggressive timelines for results, demanding that the Department of Energy Secretary, Chris Wright, “demonstrate an initial operating capability of the Platform for at least one of the national science and technology challenges” identified in less than a year (270 days). Ideally, Trump’s mission will have generated significant discoveries in key fields within the next three years before he leaves office, his order outlined.\n\nPaul Josephson, a Colby College professor and expert in the history of 20th-century science and technology, told Ars that Genesis Mission deadlines differ from John F. Kennedy’s 10-year timeline to reach the moon.\n\nTrump’s order “shows tremendous ignorance of how science and technology work,” Josephson said. The White House is saying, “Tell me what your discoveries will be and how many there will be in three years,” Josephson said, expecting that “we can pick the places where we want discoveries and make them happen.”\n\n“That’s not anything like how science works,” Josephson told Ars, reducing Genesis Mission to “a vision without policy” and “a hope without funding.”\n\nTo Josephson, Trump’s order sounded “more like it came out of Silicon Valley” than out of talks with government scientists, seemingly rushing approvals of industry partnerships and incentives without mentioning what resources would be available to fund gutted labs or train the next generation of scientists. It’s perhaps notable that the order is DOE-centric and does not place the same emphasis on contributions from universities or national labs funded by NSF and the National Institutes of Health as it does on industry partners.\n\nKelley told Ars that “many public datasets are already being used effectively in research and industry” in the ways that Trump intends his AI platform to amplify. However, “there are areas—such as advanced nuclear research or emerging energy technologies—where datasets are limited.” And Trump risks reducing Genesis Mission to bluster by claiming that an AI platform could drive breakthroughs to the major challenges he flagged in the short term.\n\n“There is a real risk that the EO’s ambitious framing could overpromise what AI can achieve in the near term without addressing foundational data gaps,” Kelley told Ars. “That said, even partial progress in these areas could provide valuable insights, but expectations need to be realistic.”\n\nJust as important as asking where Genesis Mission funding is coming from or who the funding is going to, Chris R. Glass asks: “Where’s the talent coming from?”\n\nTrump’s order does not forecast that, only vaguely referencing support for universities training scientists. This comes, of course, after the administration revoked an estimated $1.5 billion in federal grant money in 2025. Those grant cuts shrank the pipeline for PhD students at an “unprecedented rate,” Axios reported.\n\nA Boston College professor who researches global student mobility and the impact of emergent technology on learning, Glass told Ars that Trump has notably left international talent out of his AI plans, despite the prominent roles that both “domestic and international scientists play in our current leadership” in AI.\n\nIn a recent Washington Post op-ed, Glass warned that “America is losing research scientists,” who are seeking more stable environments to set up their lives and conduct long-term studies.\n\nAs the Trump administration has attacked immigrants, other governments like the European Union and China have benefited by offering friendlier visa systems to attract the best and brightest minds graduating from US universities. Of course, of the two, China is America’s bigger AI rival. Earlier this year, China began heavily recruiting American scientists spooked by Trump’s grant funding cuts, and Glass confirmed that China has continued those efforts with the AI race heating up. Meanwhile, Trump appears to be going the other direction, recently requiring a $100,000 payment for some skilled workers seeking non-immigrant visas.\n\nThroughout 2025, US universities’ ability to attract international students showed resilience, but “we’re on thin ice,” Glass told Ars, with that resilience “waning.”\n\nCurrently, the US “is ranked the lowest among top destinations for its safety and welcoming and the lowest for its post-graduation visa policies,” Glass said, noting that doctoral students must affirm that they do not intend to immigrate, even though the majority of STEM PhD students stay in the US after graduating.\n\n“They want to stay, and we want them to stay,” Glass told Ars.\n\nAnother concerning outcome of Trump cuts that could hamper Genesis Mission: Entire research groups at many institutions were “displaced”—removed from their labs and left to work in cubicles without access to their equipment, Glass told Ars.\n\n“I think scientists want to go where the best sciences are being done, but eventually these kinds of friction points and these hostile policies make them redirect elsewhere, even temporarily redirect, earn their doctorate in Europe and hope that the policy environment in the US changes,” Glass said.\n\nTo turn it around, Glass made several recommendations in his op-ed to help retain PhD graduates and create stable pathways for high-value talents. That includes suggesting that the Trump administration consider fast-tracking green cards for students in fields that Genesis Mission depends on, including AI and machine-learning researchers, quantum computing scientists, and semiconductor engineers.\n\nHe also thinks the US should “unlock the O-1A visa for researchers and entrepreneurs” by redefining what makes someone an “extraordinary” talent and creating dedicated “founder tracks” for international talent, as Britain and Singapore do. That visa is “uncapped yet underused,” Glass said, only approving 4,500 STEM candidates in 2023.\n\nWithout changes to the visa system, the US “risks redirecting those talent flows,” he said. “And like a river, once those talent flows get redirected, they are very difficult to reverse.”\n\nAnd it won’t just be international talents jumping ship, Glass suggested, but also possibly US scientists forced to continue navigating potentially more of Trump’s cuts and indirect costs in the coming years.\n\n“I think that’s the kind of thing that slowly eats away at someone’s desire to continue to do science in the United States,” Glass said.\n\nGlass told Ars that he expects the US to stay on a “downward trajectory,” driving away talent in 2026, which Josephson suggested “will damage science both for the short and long term.”\n\n“Many universities figured out a one-year contingency plan, but reality will set in if funding continues to be cut,” Glass said.\n\nCASC’s Kelley told Ars that like university international student recruitment, “the US research ecosystem continues to be resilient, but the gap between ambitious goals and the current capacity must be carefully managed.”\n\n“While the Genesis Mission signals strong intentions to invest in science and technology, its success will depend on aligning resources, rebuilding workforce capacity, and thoughtfully integrating AI and data capabilities where they are most effective,” Kelley said.\n\nA scientist might be best positioned to understand the nuance that requires, but Josephson noted that Trump tasked his Science Advisor, Michael Kratsios, with leading the initiative. Unlike prior officials serving in that role, Kratsios is not a scientist and has no PhD, earning his BA in politics. Instead, Kratsios has strong industry ties, previously serving as chief of staff for venture capitalist Peter Thiel and managing director of a company called Scale AI.\n\nTo Josephson, Kratsios as head of the mission—which “seems to be totally based on faith in AI and datasets to do everything”—makes the initiative seem more aligned with Silicon Valley ambitions than public good. That could be a problem since historically, it has never worked when governments attempt to “pick winners” or pass industrial policy with claims that “if we do this, we will come out on top.”\n\n“It’s a belief in AI as the cure or the panacea for all the world’s problems to ensure we’re a dominant technological power, but ignoring climate change, race, gender, anything that is important in daily life,” Josephson said.\n\nJosephson is also an expert in Russian and Soviet history, explaining that precedent shows there are “tremendous dangers” of governments controlling which sciences are funded. In some ways, he thinks Genesis Mission “smells of Putin,” he told Ars, warning that Trump’s attempts to hoard and censor science in 2025 have been “as damaging to science and technology in the world’s leading centers as totalitarian regimes have been.”\n\n“It reflects the general timbre of the Trump administration toward the scientific enterprise,” he suggested, saying that the president has embraced the “authoritarian view” that he “has the right to pick and choose which fields and which branches merit more support and which should not be funded at all.”\n\nJules Barbati-Dajches, an analyst for the Center for Science and Democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS), told Ars that in addition to cuts, Trump recently “weakened federal agency policies (called scientific integrity policies) that were specifically in place to protect federal agency science from political interference.” This further threatens scientific integrity, Barbati-Dajches warned in August.\n\nUCS has tracked “instances of science being sidelined, ignored, or misused by the federal government” across “multiple presidential administrations” for two decades, Barbati-Dajches told Ars. And although their methodology was recently updated, the current Trump administration stands out, as “the rate and impact of attacks on science we’ve observed over the past nine months far outpace anything UCS has tracked before,” Barbati-Dajches said.\n\nAdditionally, UCS has documented “cases of the administration using AI in their reports and research that raise concern” that AI initiatives like Genesis Mission may promote dubious claims to serve “politicized” outcomes, Barbati-Dajches said.\n\n“This altogether paints a very troubling picture,” Barbati-Dajches said. “Scientific innovation and discovery are exciting, important, and can help inform federal policy and guidance. But as history tells us (and recent history even more so), science in the federal government needs protective guardrails to keep it independent and free from undue influence.”\n\nWith Trump pushing for rapid buildouts of AI data centers—sparking widespread backlash among Americans—Barbati-Dajches noted that UCS has documented his administration making “policy choices and decisions that benefit favored interests (including tech and fossil fuel companies) over the health and safety of the public and planet.” Genesis Mission appears to follow that trend, critics suggested, along with Trump’s most recent executive order threatening to block state AI laws, which many consider a gift to the tech industry.\n\n“And meanwhile, most Americans are clear they don’t trust AI and want it regulated—but this administration has opposed even basic guardrails,” Prabhakar said.\n\nPlanning to closely monitor Genesis Mission, UCS is keen to get answers to many questions, such as “who will have access to the platform that’s being created as part of this initiative” and “who will own or will benefit from the outputs of this type of program?”\n\nJosephson said that it’s unlikely Genesis Mission will advance much before the midterm elections. In the next steps, Congress will have to approve funding for the mission, as its broad ambitions, if supported, would surely require structure to continue across multiple administrations.\n\nTo Barbati-Dajches, it’s critical that Genesis Mission is “viewed in the context of [the Trump administration’s] pattern of anti-science actions.”\n\n“One of my main concerns is that this type of mission is being funded in the name of science and innovation when the administration has continuously and methodically attacked federal scientific systems since Inauguration Day,” Barbati-Dajches said.\n\nIt’s unclear whether Genesis Mission will amount to anything but hype. But Josephson noted that perhaps the most blustery part of Trump’s order was a claim that “from the founding of the Republic, scientific discovery and technological innovation have driven American progress and prosperity.”\n\nThe US only began funding research in the back half of the 19th century, Josephson said, “but the amount of money coming from the federal government to the sciences was limited until the Manhattan Project.” After that, the US emerged as a “leading scientific power” in the Cold War, not by racing for “global technology dominance,” as Trump wants, but by embracing science as a “national good.”\n\nAs it stands now, Genesis Mission’s biggest flaw might stem from Trump’s disdain for DEI, which fueled his attacks on science and universities all year, Josephson suggested.\n\n“Funding science and technology and allowing the scientific community through peer review to determine what is the best science and to give funding to encourage young people to enter the science pipeline and to ensure that there are more women and people of color in the scientific community, so that more and more brains are taking part—there’s none of that in the Genesis Mission,” Josephson said.",

    "description": "A grandmother from New Orleans stays healthy at 79 with daily walking, social clubs, and two workouts a day. Science says she has the right idea.",
    "fullText": "When I first met 79-year-old Anne Thibodeaux, she was fresh out of two back-to-back workout classes and excited to show me what she was reading for book club.\n\nThe book was \"Outlive,\" a longevity handbook from Dr. Peter Attia, an anti-aging specialist beloved by tech CEOs and Hollywood actors, and now, apparently, this grandmother from New Orleans.\n\nThe funny thing, Thibodeaux told me via Zoom last month, is that Attia's advice for a long life matches what she's been doing for decades already.\n\nWe all might want to take a page out of her book when it comes to longevity.\n\nThibodeaux said she works out 11 times a week, on average, doing everything from yoga to dance to strength and stability training. Her social calendar is packed. In her free time, she loves to garden, check out museums, and hit the dance floor.\n\nThese habits, which Thibodeaux believes have kept her vibrant and healthy, are science-backed strategies for healthier aging.\n\nThibodeaux has been retired for more than two decades, but spent her career teaching and never lost her love of learning.\n\nThese days, she channels her curiosity into learning new types of exercise (among other things).\n\nHer weekly routine includes a variety of different virtual classes from SilverSneakers, an exercise program for adults 65 and older (available at no cost with eligible Medicare plans).\n\nThat's why, flipping through Attia's book, she found his anti-aging exercise recommendations were already familiar.\n\nStability work? Check, her regular classes include plenty of core and balance moves.\n\nStrength training? Check, courtesy of dumbbell exercises.\n\nLow-intensity cardio? Double-check: Thibodeaux loves to dance in class and out on the town.\n\nThibodeaux isn't just active in her virtual classes twice (or more) a day. She's also out and about — keen to avoid becoming too sedentary, which can shorten lifespan, especially for older folks.\n\n\"A lot of people my age sit all day. And that's not healthy,\" she said.\n\nHer typical habits include working in her garden, walking in the park, or strolling around local landmarks, especially in nice weather.\n\n\"We have a beautiful sculpture garden right by our museum, so I like to get out and get some of that vitamin D,\" she said.\n\nAll the walking adds up over time on her FitBit, Thibodeaux told me.\n\nShe's often going above and beyond 10,000 steps a day. (Research suggests as few as 4,000 steps a day can boost heart health.)\n\nOne recent highlight: at her granddaughter's wedding, Thibodeaux logged 22,315 steps.\n\n\"I never left the dance floor. I was determined I was going to enjoy that wedding, and I did,\" she said.\n\nThibodeaux's social life is as action-packed as her gym routine. She said she regularly hangs out with friends on outings to the mall or to catch a movie. Her workout classes, while virtual, are also intensely social, with members often connecting during and outside class for daily chitchat.\n\nHer daily mantra is to stay in touch with people in her life, whether it's a quick chat or getting lunch. Her granddaughter, for instance, calls regularly.\n\n\"It's important to check on your family and friends, make sure they're doing OK, because sometimes you have no idea what challenges some people are dealing with,\" Thibodeaux said.\n\nLongevity isn't about staying physically active. The longest-living people on earth are renowned for strong community ties, and research suggests good relationships are key to healthy aging.\n\nSpending time with loved ones is also linked to another longevity-boosting habit: gratitude. Feeling appreciation in your daily life can even lower the risk of dying early, according to some studies.\n\n\"I'm a person of simple pleasures,\" Thibodeaux said. \"I think it's important to be grateful for the blessings you have.\"",

    "fullText": "We gave Claude the ability to fine-tune language models using a new tool called Hugging Face Skills. Not just write training scripts, but to actually submit jobs to cloud GPUs, monitor progress, and push finished models to the Hugging Face Hub. This tutorial shows you how it works and how to use it yourself.\n\nClaude Code can use \"skills\"—packaged instructions, scripts, and domain knowledge—to accomplish specialized tasks. The hf-llm-trainer skill teaches Claude everything it needs to know about training: which GPU to pick for your model size, how to configure Hub authentication, when to use LoRA versus full fine-tuning, and how to handle the dozens of other decisions that go into a successful training run.\n\nWith this skill, you can tell Claude things like:\n\nThe model trains on Hugging Face GPUs while you do other things. When it's done, your fine-tuned model appears on the Hub, ready to use.\n\nThis isn't a toy demo. The skill supports the same training methods used in production: supervised fine-tuning, direct preference optimization, and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards. You can train models from 0.5B to 70B parameters, convert them to GGUF for local deployment, and run multi-stage pipelines that combine different techniques.\n\nHugging Face skills are compatible with Claude Code, Codex, and Gemini CLI. With integrations on the way for Cursor, Windsurf, and Continue.\n\nThis repo includes gemini-extension.json to integrate with the Gemini CLI.\n\nYou have to authenticate to your Hugging Face account with a write-access token so that the job can create a model repo.\n\nConfigure Hugging Face MCP Server to use your write token by sending it in either the HF_TOKEN or Authorization: Bearer HTTP Headers.\n\nFor Claude Code : claude mcp add --transport http hf-skills https://huggingface.co/mcp?bouquet=skills --header \"Authorization: Bearer $HF_TOKEN\"\n\nLet's walk through a complete example. We'll fine-tune a small model to see the full workflow, then explore more advanced capabilities.\n\nStart with a simple and clear instruction to fine tune a specific model\n\nThe coding agent analyzes your request and prepares a training configuration. For a 0.6B model on a demo dataset, it selects t4-small—enough GPU for this model size and the cheapest option available.\n\nThe open-r1/codeforces-cots dataset is a dataset of codeforces problems and solutions. It is a good dataset for instruction tuning a model to solve hard coding problems.\n\nBefore your coding agent submits anything, you'll see the configuration:\n\nThis is your chance to adjust anything. Change the output repo name, pick different hardware, or ask Claude to modify training parameters. Once you approve, the agent submits the job.\n\nFor example, you can ask the agent to try a test run:\n\nAfter submission, you get job details:\n\nThe skill includes Trackio integration, so you can watch training loss decrease in real-time. Jobs run asynchronously so you can close your terminal and come back later. When you want an update:\n\nThen the agent fetches the logs and summarizes progress.\n\nClick here for an example Trackio dashboard with some completed runs.\n\nWhen training completes, your model is on the Hub:\n\nThat's the full loop. You described what you wanted in plain English, and the agent handled GPU selection, script generation, job submission, authentication, and persistence. The whole thing cost about thirty cents.\n\nThe skill supports three training approaches. Understanding when to use each one helps you get better results.\n\nSFT is where most projects start. You provide demonstration data—examples of inputs and desired outputs—and training adjusts the model to match those patterns.\n\nUse SFT when you have high-quality examples of the behavior you want. Customer support conversations, code generation pairs, domain-specific Q&A—anything where you can show the model what good looks like.\n\nThe agent validates the dataset, selects hardware (a10g-large with LoRA for a 7B model), and configures training with checkpoints and monitoring.\n\nFor models larger than 3B parameters, the agent automatically uses LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) to reduce memory requirements. This makes training 7B or 13B models feasible on single GPUs while preserving most of the quality of full fine-tuning.\n\nDPO trains on preference pairs—responses where one is \"chosen\" and another is \"rejected.\" This aligns model outputs with human preferences, typically after an initial SFT stage.\n\nUse DPO when you have preference annotations from human labelers or automated comparisons. DPO optimizes directly for the preferred response without needing a separate reward model.\n\nDPO is sensitive to dataset format. It requires columns named exactly chosen and rejected, or a prompt column with the input. The agent validates this first and shows you how to map columns if your dataset uses different names.\n\nGRPO is a reinforcement learning task that is proven to be effective on verifiable tasks like solving math problems, writing code, or any task with a programmatic success criterion.\n\nThe model generates responses, receives rewards based on correctness, and learns from the outcomes. This is more complex than SFT or DPO, but the configuration is similar.\n\nThe agent selects hardware based on your model size, but understanding the tradeoffs helps you make better decisions.\n\nFor tiny models under 1B parameters, t4-small works well. These models train quickly—expect $1-2 for a full run. This is perfect for educational or experimental runs.\n\nFor small models (1-3B), step up to t4-medium or a10g-small. Training takes a few hours and costs $5-15.\n\nFor medium models (3-7B), you need a10g-large or a100-large with LoRA. Full fine-tuning doesn't fit, but LoRA makes these very trainable. Budget $15-40 for production.\n\nFor large models (7B+), this HF skills job is not suitable.\n\nWhen testing a workflow, start small:\n\nTh coding agent configures minimal training—enough to verify your pipeline works without real cost.\n\nAlways run a demo before committing to a multi-hour production job. A $0.50 demo that catches a format error saves a $30 failed run.\n\nDataset format is the most common source of training failures. The agent can validate datasets before you spend GPU time.\n\nThe agent runs a quick inspection on CPU (fractions of a penny) and reports:\n\nIf your dataset needs transformation, the agent can show you how:\n\nThe agent provides mapping code and can incorporate it directly into your training script.\n\nReal-time monitoring helps you catch problems early. The skill configures Trackio by default—after submitting a job, you can watch metrics at:\n\nThis shows training loss, learning rate, and validation metrics. A healthy run shows steadily decreasing loss.\n\nAsk the agent about status anytime:\n\nIf something goes wrong, the agent helps diagnose. Out of memory? the agent suggests reducing batch size or upgrading hardware. Dataset error? The agent identifies the mismatch. Timeout? The agent recommends longer duration or faster training settings.\n\nAfter training, you might want to run your model locally. The GGUF format works with llama.cpp and dependent tools like LM Studio, Ollama, etc.\n\nThe agent submits a conversion job that merges LoRA adapters, converts to GGUF, applies quantization, and pushes to Hub.\n\nWe've shown that coding agents like Claude Code, Codex, or Gemini CLI can handle the full lifecycle of model fine-tuning: validating data, selecting hardware, generating scripts, submitting jobs, monitoring progress, and converting outputs. This turns what used to be a specialized skill into something you can do through conversation.\n\nThe skill is open source. You can extend it, customize it for your workflows, or use it as a starting point for other training scenarios.\n\nIs this still usable without a Pro account? Will it be able to output everything up to \"Submit the job to Hugging Face Jobs\"?\n\nIs there data privacy when doing this?\n\nIs it posted privately to a personal/team hub?\n\nCould this be done locally without the push to the repo?\n\nAnother agentic way of wasting tokens\n\nis it possible to use this inside vscode's copilot extension ?\n\nSkill documentation is not available at the provided link - https://github.com/huggingface/skills/blob/main/hf-llm-trainer/SKILL.md\n\nAh, we moved a couple of bits around in the repo -- link for that is here: https://github.com/huggingface/skills/blob/main/hf-llm-trainer/skills/model-trainer/SKILL.md -- I'll update the article 👍.\n\n\"Really fascinating read! I found the explanation of Hugging Face’s “Skills Training” initiative — how it lets you use a coding‑agent (like Claude Code or other supported agents) to fine‑tune large language models, submit GPU jobs, monitor progress and push trained models to the Hub — particularly eye‑opening. The combination of high‑level instructions, hardware selection, monitoring, and automation makes the complex process of model training much more approachable, even for developers who may not be ML‑infrastructure experts.\n\nI also recently read a related guide: https://mobisoftinfotech.com/resources/blog/ai‑development/llm‑api‑pricing‑guide\n — which gives practical advice on LLM API usage, token‑based pricing, and how to plan costs when working with LLMs.\n\nPutting your article’s look into empowering accessible LLM fine‑tuning together with the cost‑management strategies from that guide gives a well‑rounded perspective: it helps developers understand not just what is possible now with modern tools, but also how to build and deploy responsibly, balancing capability and cost.\"\n\nGreat work and great article!\nRegarding the maximum models size we can train using this approach, at the beginning of the article it's mentioned \"models from 0.5B to 70B parameters\" but at the end you write that \"For large models (7B+), this HF skills job is not suitable\", which order of magnitude is correct?\nI suspect the max range is 7B, if it's the case, do you plan to support training of larger models?\nThanks!\n\nis the trained model now open source and / or available to the public?\n\n·\n Sign up or\n log in to comment",
