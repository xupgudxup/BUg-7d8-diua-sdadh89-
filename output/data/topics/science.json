    "description": "Computer science doctoral student Daniel Honrales demonstrates PropType, a patent-pending technology that overlays an augmented keyboard surface onto handheld objects. Virtual keyboards are a frequent source of frustration for augmented reality (AR) users. The virtual surfaces are slow and error prone, and raising an arm to type on them can cause muscle strain known as […]",
