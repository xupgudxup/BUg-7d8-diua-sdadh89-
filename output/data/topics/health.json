    "description": "Owners, corporation appear for sentencing in federal court in Erie in health care fraud case against Hertel & Brown Physical & Aquatic Therapy.",
    "fullText": "(This story was updated to add new information.)\n\nThe two owners of Hertel & Brown Physical & Aquatic Therapy have been sentenced to six years in federal prison and fined the maximum of $250,000 each for engineering a multimillion-dollar health care fraud scheme in which the well-known Erie-based clinic overbilled Medicare, Medicaid and private insurers for 14 years.\n\nThe defendants, Aaron W. Hertel, 47, and Michael R. Brown, 49, must also pay restitution an in amount to be determined. They will both report to prison at dates the federal Bureau of Prisons will set.\n\nU.S. District Judge Susan Paradise Baxter sharply criticized Hertel and Brown as she sentenced them in federal court in Erie on Feb. 27.\n\nShe said the two damaged public confidence in the health care system as they overbilled insurers to boost the revenues of Hertel & Brown and provide more income for themselves.\n\n\"It is a breach of public trust,\" Baxter said.\n\nHertel and Brown apologized to Baxter in statements they gave at separate sentencing hearings in a courtroom whose gallery was filled with their friends and relatives.\n\nOther defendants: Who has been sentenced in Hertel & Brown fraud? Long case nears an end\n\nHertel said he was \"expressing my sincere remorse for the harm and distress caused by my actions.\" He said he was sorry to Hertel & Brown's employees and to his family, \"who have suffered consequences they do not deserve.\"\n\nBrown expressed remorse to his family and Hertel & Brown's employees.\n\n\"I regret my actions and the circumstances that brought me here today,\" Brown said.\n\nHe said he realized that his time in prison will keep him from his family and children during \"the most important moments of their lives,\" and that his conviction means that he might be prohibited from practicing physical therapy once he leaves prison. Those convicted in the Hertel & Brown case face suspension or revocation of their state-issued licenses.\n\n\"I don't know if physical therapy is in my future,\" Brown told Baxter, but he said whatever he does once he leaves prison, \"service to those in need will be at its core.\"\n\nBaxter's sentences followed the terms of the plea agreement that U.S. Attorney's Office and defense reached when Hertel & Brown as a corporation and Hertel and Brown as individuals pleaded guilty a year ago to the felony of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and health care fraud.\n\nThe plea deal called for recommended sentences of six years each for Hertel and Brown, plus restitution and the possibility of a fine, and Baxter chose to impose the maximum amount. She will determine the amount of restitution following a restitution hearing on April 21.\n\nBaxter also sentenced Hertel and Brown to three years of supervised release. The six-year prison terms represent a significant sentencing break for Hertel and Brown.\n\nThe advisory sentencing guidelines for Hertel and Brown called for prison terms of 15 years to eight months to 19 years and seven months. The guidelines accounted for the millions of dollars of losses to insurers due to the fraud.\n\nBaxter followed another part of the plea deal and ordered Hertel and Brown to forfeit their ownership of a condominium in Sarasota, Florida. They also must forfeit their ownership in their former satellite office on Avonia Road in Fairview Township. Hertel & Brown's flagship office was in rented space at the West Erie Plaza in Millcreek Township.\n\nHertel and Brown were allowed to keep their individual residences. The U.S. Attorney's Office initially sought forfeiture of those properties. Hertel lives in North East and Brown in Millcreek.\n\nBaxter at an earlier hearing on Feb. 27 sentenced Hertel & Brown as a corporation to a year of probation, with restitution based on the outcome on the hearing in April. The clinic is out of business.\n\nThe case against Hertel & Brown started with an indictment filed in November 2021 against the corporation, Hertel and Brown as individuals and 18 employees. The U.S. Attorney's Office said the defendants defrauded Medicare, Medicaid and private insurers by as much as $22 million over the 14 years Hertel & Brown's existed.\n\nOwners make their case: Hertel & Brown owners ask sentencing judge to consider entire careers\n\nEighteen of the 21 defendants — including Hertel & Brown and Hertel and Brown as individuals — pleaded guilty to the felony of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and health care fraud.\n\nBefore the sentencings of Hertel and the corporation, 11 of those other defendants were sentenced to probation and ordered to pay restitution, with the other sentencings set to occur by the end of March. Another defendant was convicted of health care fraud at a trial in April, and two other defendants were acquitted at the same trial.\n\nAmong the evidence was that Hertel & Brown used low-paid and unlicensed technicians to treat patients and billed Medicare, Medicaid and private insurers as if licensed physical therapists and physical therapy assistants had done the work. Hertel and Brown were using proceeds from the overbilling to pay themselves $800,000 to $1 million a year, according to the evidence.\n\nBaxter at the sentencings alluded to the size and scope of the Hertel & Brown case ― the largest-ever prosecution of white-collar crime in Erie.\n\nShe said the case \"has occupied a significant part of the court's docket and community attention for a considerable period of time.\"\n\nShe said the community attention was not due to gossip but because of public interest in the integrity of the systems for reimbursement of Medicare, Medicaid and private insurers.\n\nThe criminal activity of Hertel & Brown and Hertel and Brown as individuals, Baxter said, eroded the confidence \"not only in individual providers, but in the systems on which patients and families depend.\"\n\nBaxter also blamed Hertel and Brown for being behind the fraud that led to the charges and felony convictions against the 15 of the 18 employees who were indicted and pleaded guilty or were convicted at trial. Baxter said those employees made much less money than Hertel and Brown and put trust in them for guidance on billing practices.\n\nWhat all the employees \"have in common,\" Baxter said, \"is that they believed ― misplaced as that belief was ― in Hertel & Brown Physical & Aquatic Therapy as a vehicle for good, and not for a money-making machine for its owners.\n\n\"Unfortunately, they believed that Mr. Hertel and Mr. Brown, individually, were their mentors, and that the instructions given to them were for the good of the team, for their own professional development and, most of all, the way of the practice.\"\n\nThe lead prosecutor in the case, Assistant U.S. Attorney Christian Trabold, emphasized to Baxter that the Hertel and Brown committed \"purposeful conduct\" in leading the overbilling scheme.\n\nTrabold said many crimes grow out of alcohol and drug use and impulsive behavior. The fraud in the Hertel & Brown case was calculated.\n\n\"This is not a spur-of-the-moment thing,\" Trabold told Baxter. \"It is a daily decision to shirk the rules to enhance your lifestyle.\n\n\"At any point in time, they could have stopped this.\"\n\nContact Ed Palattella at epalattella@usatodayco.com or 814-870-1813.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Erie Times-News: Hertel & Brown owners sentenced to prison, fined maximum of $250,000",

    "fullText": "As Cactus League play kicks into full gear, A.J. Preller and his baseball operations crew will have to start narrowing down the list of players who will have a chance at breaking camp with the Major League squad to end Spring Training. With stars heading off to play for their respective countries, here's how Padres camp stands as of Friday evening:\n\nStarting rotation and bench races heat up\n\nStarter Randy Vásquez built off the impressive end to his 2025 season on Friday against the Rockies. He struck out four without allowing a hit through 2 2/3 scoreless frames in San Diego's 3-2 loss to Colorado. Vásquez noticeably made a leap in increasing his fastball velocity last September and has kept it going, sitting 95 to 97 mph in his first Cactus League start.\n\nFormer Cleveland top prospect Triston McKenzie has struggled in his first few innings for the Friars. The hard-throwing righty has shown flashes of the electric stuff he possessed as a farmhand, but has fallen short so far due to lack of command on his pitches. He's given up five earned runs in 2 2/3 innings thus far.\n\nIn 11 at-bats, infielder Jose Miranda has impressed. He's hitting .545 with a 1.615 OPS, two doubles, a home run, and six RBIs. The former Minnesota Twin is competing for a bench spot along with returning veteran Ty France and KBO new-comer Sung-Mun Song.\n\nSuperstars Manny Machado and Fernando Tatis Jr. collected their final at-bats before heading off to join Team Dominican Republic for the World Baseball Classic. Machado collected an RBI on a sacrifice fly on Friday against the Rockies, but had quite an afternoon on Thursday after launching two no-doubt homers, including a grand slam against the Cincinnati Reds. He tallied six RBIs and two runs in the contest. Talk about getting hot at the right time.\n\nFernando Tatis Jr. on the opportunity to represent the Dominican Republic at the World Baseball Classic:\n\n“It means the world…I’m truly blessed to be from that small island.” pic.twitter.com/YwLdu0m5MD\n\n— Sammy Levitt (@SammyLev) February 27, 2026\n\nOther Padres stars heading off to the WBC include standout closer Mason Miller for Team USA, Xander Bogaerts will play shortstop for the Netherlands, relievers Alek Jacob and Ron Marinaccio will throw for team Italy, while lefty Wandy Peralta also suits up for the Dominican Republic.\n\nMusgrove and Canning making progress\n\nVeteran right-hander Joe Musgrove is progressing nicely and is on track to be a full-go for Opening Day. After missing the entirety of the 2025 campaign due to Tommy John surgery, Musgrove arrived in Peoria with sights set on once again toeing the slab for his native ball club.\n\nHe recorded nine outs after facing 12 batters in a simulated game on Thursday morning, looking exceptionally sharp. Various reports indicate he was reaching up to 95 mph on the fastball, while spinning the slider and sinker with intense movement.\n\nJoe Musgrove pitched three innings and threw 34 pitches in a simulated game today in Peoria. pic.twitter.com/iRMdUh2ca4\n\n— 97.3 The Fan (@973TheFanSD) February 26, 2026\n\nMusgrove's last big league start came in October 2024 against the Atlanta Braves in the National League Wild Card Series. He struck out four and gave up one run across 3 2/3 innings.\n\nFreshly signed Frair Griffin Canning showed positive signs of healing, continuing agility work with Padres strength and conditioning staff. He's also been able to throw in the bullpen while working closely with pitching coach Ruben Niebla. Canning is recovering from a ruptured left achilles injury sustained last June. San Diego expects him to be game ready by early to mid May.\n\nIn non-related Spring Training news, a resolution to the impending sale of the Padres might be nearing a conclusion. On Thursday evening, Kevin Acee of the San Diego Union-Tribune reported that five groups have submitted a first round of bids for the franchise. Among them are José E. Feliciano, Dan Friedkin, and Joe Lacob.\n\nFeliciano, is a businessman whose private equity firm holds a majority share of Premier League club Chelsea F.C. Friedkin, a native San Diegan, also owns the Premier League team Everton F.C., along with several other business ventures. Lacob, the more popular name of the three, is owner of the NBA's Golden State Warriors and has expressed interest in purchasing a Major League franchise, after attempting at acquisitions of the Los Angeles Angels and Athletics.\n\nIntriguingly, The Athletic's Dennis Lin followed by reporting that Vuori CEO Joe Kudla and NFL legend Drew Brees were one of the five groups to bid on the Padres, but later confirmed that they ultimately did not submit a formal offer by Wednesday's deadline. Kudla and Brees have however, expressed interest in with one of the other groups in the bidding process.\n\nPer Sportico, the franchise has an estimated value of $2.31 billion. Industry expectations are for the Seidler family to fetch north of $5 billion once the sale is completed.",

    "title": "The 'Glucose Goddess' says 3 food hacks helped her reduce blood sugar spikes for better mood and energy",
    "description": "The \"Glucose Goddess\" built a brand around her blood sugar balancing hacks. She said a few swaps to her diet boosted her mood, energy, and health.",
    "fullText": "One morning, Jessie Inchauspé, then in her 20s, grabbed her usual sugary breakfast on her way to work in Silicon Valley — and noticed something strange.\n\nWith a cutting-edge tech wearable, she could see her blood sugar spiking, then crashing, in a pattern that mirrored her bouts of brain fog, anxiety, and exhaustion almost exactly, she said.\n\n\"It might seem obvious today that what we eat impacts our mental health, but back then, for me, I hadn't connected the dots,\" Inchauspé told Business Insider.\n\nInchauspé was part of a pilot study using a continuous glucose monitor, or CGM. Once reserved for people with diabetes, the devices were being tested to see how food affected the blood sugar levels, and corresponding mood and energy, of otherwise healthy people.\n\nIt sent her down a rabbit hole. About a decade later, the rest of us are finally starting to catch up. Now, an online audience of more than 5 million people are looking to Inchauspé — better known as the Glucose Goddess — for advice on achieving steady energy and a healthy metabolism.\n\nCGMs have since exploded in popularity among athletes, CEOs, and ordinary people trying to lose weight or to feel less sluggish. Brands like the Stelo, a device from Dexcom that Inchauspé has partnered with, are available without a prescription.\n\nThey may not be for everyone, particularly if intensive tracking makes you feel trapped in \"sugar jail\" as one Business Insider reporter wrote about trying a CGM.\n\nDietitians caution that self-tracking can sometimes lead to overanalyzing normal biological responses as your blood sugar goes through natural spikes and dips throughout the day. The science behind blood-sugar \"optimization\" is still evolving.\n\nStill, Inchauspé said she's seen lasting benefits from understanding her blood sugar and making simple daily tweaks. Three of her top tips are backed by solid evidence to prevent blood sugar spikes and support healthy eating overall.\n\n\"Saying that glucose only matters if you have diabetes is to me like saying brushing your teeth only matters if you have cavities,\" Inchauspé told Business Insider. \"We all feel the effects of our glucose levels on a daily basis.\"\n\nInchauspé said her previous habit of starting the day with cereal or granola seemed healthy, but ended in an afternoon slump.\n\nShe reined in her skyrocketing blood sugar by switching to eggs, Greek yogurt with unsweetened nut butter, or a smoothie with protein powder.\n\nAfter her mood and energy dramatically improved, she said a high-protein breakfast has become a non-negotiable.\n\n\"Anchoring your day with a protein-rich breakfast that keeps you steady is really, really key,\" Inchauspé said. \"It changed how I felt. It changed how I ate, how I was connected to my body.\"\n\nStarting the day with protein, and including it in each meal, is a dietitian-approved way to get enough of the nutrient, although your exact needs will vary based on your weight and goals.\n\nWhole food sources of protein like dairy and eggs, combined with nutrient-dense choices like fruit and nuts, are more satiating for long-lasting energy compared to processed foods like shakes and bars.\n\nCarb-rich foods are often blamed for blood sugar spikes, but Inchauspé is quick to point out that carbs can be healthy.\n\n\"I love pasta, and I could never give up pasta, nor do I want to,\" she said.\n\nContext is key. A dose of fiber at the beginning of a meal helps create a softer landing when the carbs hit your system, slowing digestion so that blood sugar levels cruise along like a gently rolling hill instead of a roller coaster.\n\nInchauspé starts her meals with salad or other fiber-rich vegetables that support healthy digestion, topped with flavorful, low-sugar miso dressing\n\n\"It's not necessarily replacing things, but also just learning when and how to eat them so I can still get all the joy out of them with less impact on my glucose levels,\" she said.\n\nBetween meals, Inchauspé's go-to healthy snack is an apple with peanut butter. The dose of healthy fat and fiber helps to balance out the natural sugars of the fruit.\n\nShe found the combo of fruit and nuts leads to more stable energy than her previous daily snacks. She used to eat grapes, which can be healthy but have a fraction of the fiber, which means the sugars digest more quickly and prompt an energy boost that doesn't last.\n\nIt's just one example of how nuance and balance are crucial when it comes to blood sugar and daily health. Everyone's response to carbs can vary, and some people may be just fine with plain fruit — new research even suggests people have different \"glucotypes\" that influence how their bodies handle sugar.\n\nThat's why dietitians emphasize there's no one-size-fits-all diet for healthy eating.\n\nStill, Inchauspé's advice has garnered a massive following online, a clear sign that people are hungry for data to give them more control over their health. Scientists are still making sense of how the average person might make the most of blood-sugar tracking. For now, consider a common-sense approach to your diet, with plenty of room for nuance and the occasional treat.\n\n\"A donut is not the best thing for your blood sugar, but I would never tell you, 'you could not ever eat a donut ever again,'\" Inchauspé said. \"That would be ridiculous.",

    "description": "As a kid, Faye Bradley brushed off her Chinese mom's health advice. Now, she starts each day with a warm cup of water and refuses to go to bed with wet hair.",
    "fullText": "When I first saw \"Chinamaxxing\" on my feed, I was surprised by how happy it made me.\n\nThe viral trend — where people share Chinese lifestyle hacks, from wearing red for luck during Lunar New Year to banning outdoor shoes indoors — felt like watching the world embrace the culture I grew up with.\n\nAround the same time, another phrase was everywhere: \"You met me at a very Chinese time in my life.\" The line went viral after Hong Kong-born stand-up comedian Jimmy O Yang posted a video of himself singing the well-known Chinese song \"Yi Jian Mei\" on Instagram in November, with those words splashed across the screen. The clip has since drawn more than 6.5 million views.\n\nIt was around the same time that New Jersey TikTok creator Sherry Zhu started sharing wellness tips with her \"Chinese baddies.\"\n\nGrowing up in Hong Kong, I followed these habits long before they had a name. My mom talked constantly about balance: hot versus cold foods, drying your hair before bed, and the little miracles of White Flower Oil.\n\nWatching the internet embrace these traditions made me reflect. Some explanations oversimplify centuries-old practices — feng shui isn't just moving your desk, and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) isn't just a trendy tea. But the curiosity feels genuine.\n\nHere are four simple things my mom taught me years ago that I still swear by.\n\nGrowing up, my mom would reach for a tiny bottle of White Flower Oil, a concentrated ointment, whenever my brother or I complained about tummy aches.\n\nA dab of the concentrated herbal ointment — that has a sharp smell that combines menthol, eucalyptus, and a hint of lavender — on my belly, temples, or behind my ears, and relief would follow almost instantly.\n\nToday, I carry a small bottle whenever I travel and keep one at my bedside.\n\nIt's also a staple for motion sickness, muscle aches, or even mild stomach pain.\n\nMy mom had firm rules about drinks. Hong Kong summers are stifling — often 90 degrees Fahrenheit and humid — yet anything cold in the morning was discouraged.\n\nIn TCM, hot water is believed to support digestion and circulation, while cold drinks can \"shock\" the body and disrupt internal balance.\n\nSwitching to hot water first thing in the morning may sound trivial, but it transformed my mornings. My energy feels steadier, my stomach calmer, and I start the day feeling grounded instead of jolted awake.\n\nI used to brush off her advice, but after seeing my friends do the same, I began incorporating it into my routine in my late teens.\n\nTo think she was right all along.\n\n\"You'll get sick!\" my mom would yell every time I tried to crawl into bed with damp hair.\n\nI used to roll my eyes, but now, decades later, I have to admit she was right. Sleeping with wet hair often leaves me stiff, chilled, and inexplicably irritable — not just uncomfortable, but subtly disruptive to my body's rhythm and sleep quality.\n\nFor me, blow-drying signals closure: a pause at the end of the day and a small act of respect for my body. By keeping warm and dry before bed, I wake up more rested, my muscles looser, and my mind calmer.\n\nI remember heading off to university in the UK and asking my future British flatmates in a group chat whether anyone was bringing a rice cooker. \"What's that?\" they replied. \"We just boil rice in a pan.\" I was stunned. When I moved in, I quickly realized I couldn't live without one. It makes the rice taste better.\n\nAnd my rice cooker isn't just for rice. My mom taught me it's perfect for complete meals: chicken, vegetables, and rice all in one pot. The magic isn't just convenience — steaming keeps food tender, flavorful, and healthy, locking in nutrients while reducing oil. It's practical, too, with fewer pots to scrub.\n\nIt's heartening to see these traditions embraced more widely. For me, they've always been simple acts of care; practical, grounding habits shaped by generations before us.",

    "description": "Cassenda Nelson, 47, is overwhelmed by insurance costs and medical debt due to her daughter's health condition. She's worried about paying bills.",
    "fullText": "Cassenda Nelson holds her breath when the phone rings.\n\nShe knows that it could be a hospital or ambulance service calling about unpaid bills. Nelson said she has dialed 911 several times in recent months for her 16-year-old daughter, Amunet, who has serious health issues. It's staggeringly expensive, but she doesn't have other options — and her daughter's life is at stake.\n\nNelson is a single mother of four in Camilla, a small town in southwest Georgia. She estimates that her medical debt exceeds $10,000, though she said the total is likely much higher. The ongoing cost of her daughter's care is a constant source of stress and has affected the family's ability to afford groceries, rent, and household expenses.\n\n\"I pay what I can, what's most important,\" Nelson, 47, told Business Insider. \"I don't have any other help.\"\n\nShe is one of over 100 million Americans saddled with medical bills they can't pay. Healthcare debt is among the top causes of personal bankruptcy in the US, and a 2024 analysis of government data by KFF found that millennials and Gen X carry the most debt compared to other generations. Black Americans and people living in rural areas are at the highest risk, and about 14% of these debt holders owe at least $10,000.\n\nCollection agencies can't legally charge interest on medical bills, but they can report the information to credit bureaus if the balance is over $500 for at least one year. Nelson said her credit score has tumbled because her debt is above this threshold. The cost of care is backbreaking, even with her employer-sponsored insurance plan. Her situation isn't an outlier: Many Americans with medical debt have health insurance.\n\n\"Sometimes I can't even buy groceries,\" Nelson said. \"I make a certain amount of money, but I bring home very little because she needs to have the best insurance. When I was on other insurances, I kept getting issues with pre-authorization. I couldn't even get my baby insulin.\"\n\nThe past five years have been a whirlwind for Nelson and Amunet. The teenager developed type 2 diabetes in 2020, alongside a seizure condition. She requires daily access to insulin and other medications, full-time care, and frequent trips to the emergency room. The family also lives in a rural area, meaning they sometimes travel for hours to see specialists.\n\nNelson pays $787 a month for her family's health insurance. She works as a community healthcare worker in Camilla, mostly focused on cancer screening education. She said the role has more stable coverage than her previous employers and past marketplace plan, but insurance premiums are a big part of her monthly spending.\n\nLike many Americans, her job is directly tied to her family's healthcare access. Missing extra days or hours to support Amunet puts both in jeopardy. \"I feel heavy every day getting up,\" Nelson said. \"I have to literally pray, 'God, please don't let Amunet have a seizure. I need to go to work, please.\"'\n\nYears of paying for ambulances, hospital stays, prescriptions, lab tests, and doctor co-pays have bled into other parts of Nelson's life. Her food budget has shrunk, and she can rarely afford her own healthcare. She has stopped contributing to her son's college tuition. The lights in her house were recently shut off due to unpaid electricity bills. And, without enough money to hire a caregiver for Amunet, Nelson relies on help from her other children or brings her daughter to work.\n\nThe debt weighs on her too: Nelson said she and her family recently moved into a low-income housing unit because she could no longer afford their home. And the hit to her credit score has made it more difficult for her to get approval for a lease or an auto loan, she said. Without a clear path to financial stability, Nelson said her mental health has worsened.\n\nBeyond money, Nelson said that navigating the healthcare system, especially as a Black family, can be exhausting. There are hours of medical paperwork, phone calls with insurance, meetings with doctors, and travel between appointments. She does her best to be her daughter's advocate.\n\nSometimes, she lays out her clothes before bed in case her daughter has a seizure in the middle of the night. That way, she can quickly change before the ambulance arrives. \"I know that because of me being an African American woman, I cannot walk here without any clothes on my hair combed,\" she said. \"It shouldn't matter, but I have to present my best self.\"\n\nNelson isn't sure how she will pay her next set of bills, or if she will ever be able to pay down her medical debt — but she would do anything for Amunet.\n\n\"I don't give up,\" she said. \"I get up every morning and I pray.\"",

    "description": "Throughout her 20s, a woman struggled with bloating, indigestion, and skin problems. She revised her diet for better gut health and energy.",
    "fullText": "Samantha Citro Alexander was about 11 years old when she first realized her health was linked to every bite of food she ate.\n\nGrowing up in an Italian-American family, food was part of her culture. Meals were home-cooked, nutritious but quite rich: heaping helpings of Grandma's lasagna, with a side of spinach and fruit for dessert.\n\nBut around the time her age hit double digits, she started to suffer from severe bloating and unpleasant digestive symptoms for hours after every meal.\n\n\"My stomach would feel like a bowling ball,\" she told Business Insider. \"I can still feel it viscerally to this day.\"\n\nAfter nearly a year of medical appointments and an elimination diet, Citro Alexander learned that dairy was one culprit in her symptoms.\n\n\"That is the first moment that I remember realizing that food could have a negative impact on my health,\" she said.\n\nMore than two decades later, Citro Alexander is CEO of FoodHealth Company, which uses a food scoring system to help consumers make healthier choices. It's a resource she said she could have used years ago as she struggled to manage digestive symptoms.\n\nNow in her 30s, Citro Alexander said she's dialed in her nutrition for more energy, healthier skin and hair, and better digestion by focusing on simple, everyday foods for gut health.\n\nCitro Alexander spent her late teens and 20s battling digestive issues.\n\nAt the time, she relied on cheap convenience food and takeout. The \"processed crap\" didn't make her feel great, she said.\n\nA growing body of research suggests that processed foods can cause of multitude of health harms, from increasing risk of cancer and heart disease to speeding cognitive decline.\n\nResolved to cook more at home, Citro Alexander started going to the farmers market to load up on new-to-her ingredients like dried beans and Swiss Chard.\n\nShe also found an unlikely inspiration at work. Through her former marketing and development role skincare industry, she routinely used plant-based ingredients like turmeric to reduce inflammation.\n\nOn a trip to Indonesia, she discovered how many herbs and spices could have digestive benefits, too, prepared in flavorful meals or warming teas.\n\nIt was a revelation to reframe healthy eating as adding more nutritious foods rather than focusing on what to cut out.\n\n\"Just avoiding badness doesn't really give your body what it needs. You need to fuel it with goodness,\" she said.\n\nNow, Citro Alexander said her daily routine includes a high-fiber, high-protein breakfast, along with tea, bone broth, farmers market veggies, and fresh herbs.\n\nShe starts the day with a homemade electrolyte drink: a tall glass of water with lemon, cayenne, and sea salt.\n\nFor breakfast, her go-to choice is a protein smoothie alongside whole-grain toast with avocado (which offers healthy fats in addition to fiber).\n\nThroughout the day, Citro Alexander said she drinks several teas and herbal infusions. These infusions can be rich in polyphenols and other plant-based micronutrients, and are as simple to make as steeping fresh ginger in hot water.\n\nFor lunch, she often turns to salad or a grain bowl packed with more veggies, olive oil, herbs, beans, farro or quinoa, according to recipes she's shared on social media.\n\nAt dinnertime, Citro Alexander has a rotating menu of recipes. A favorite is soba noodles with bone broth, which is high in collagen protein for healthy joints, skin, and hair. She adds plenty of ginger, lemongrass, and chiles for a punch of flavor and even more nutrients.\n\nTrue to her Italian roots, she also makes plenty of classic pasta dishes with sauce using extra-virgin olive oil, herbs, and veggies from the garden or farmers market.\n\nLocally-grown produce can be more nutritious than what you'd buy at a big-box grocery store, since commercial fruits and veggies are often less fresh and grown for durability, not flavor or vitamin content.\n\nCitro Alexander said her best advice for people looking to eat healthier is to start cooking simple recipes.\n\n\"Pick one meal a day that you're going to make from whole foods, whichever ones you like,\" she said. \"When you're cooking for yourself, you have a lot more control over what you put into your body.\"\n\nCitro Alexander turned her own struggles into the FoodHealth score to help highlight better-for-you options.\n\n\"The intention is to help people prevent and manage chronic disease,\" Citro Alexander said. \"The best way to do that is to eat a diet that is rich in fruit, vegetables, legumes, lean proteins, high fiber, and healthy fats.\"",

    "fullText": "Wales international Hannah Cain says the mental health of female players can be affected by \"really ugly\" social media abuse.\n\nLeicester City forward Cain is with the Wales squad preparing for next Tuesday's opening Women's World Cup qualifying game against the Czech Republic.\n\nEarlier this season, the 27-year-old posted on social media that \"enough is enough\" following abuse from people \"hiding behind a keyboard\".\n\nCain has now explained that \"abusive messages after pretty much every game\" for her club prompted her to speak out.\n\n\"I think over the years as the women's game has grown, it's opened up more of a platform for people to have their opinion and share their voices,\" Cain said.\n\n\"I think unfortunately social media has become a place where people can say whatever they want whether it's good, bad, ugly and sometimes the ugly is really ugly.\"\n\nFormer Everton player Cain has been at Leicester since 2020.\n\nThe Foxes are in the midst of a difficult season, with Rick Passmoor's team currently bottom of the Women's Super League (WSL).\n\nCain posted about the abuse in November, when Leicester suffered heavy defeats against Brighton and Arsenal.\n\nRacism, rape and death threats: One weekend of social media abuse in football\n\n'The abuse never stops' - Lionesses to avoid social media\n\n\"During that time I think that we weren't playing badly at a club and I wasn't playing badly but certain people decided to just send abusive messages after pretty much every game and it got to a point where I thought this is not OK,\" Cain added.\n\n\"It didn't matter what I did on the pitch and it does affect you at some point.\n\n\"You see so much of it you start thinking, are they right? Obviously you know that they're not but I think it was becoming so much that sometimes you have to speak out.\"\n\nCain believes people can forget that footballers \"are actual humans\", with abuse affecting players' lives away from the pitch as well as family members.\n\nTherefore, Cain says, she will use her platform to try to prevent further abuse.\n\n\"I think when you do say something, people start deleting all the negative comments they've made and they think that's OK,\" she added.\n\n\"But if I can have a tiny, tiny effect on people maybe thinking before they write something, then I'll absolutely do that.\"\n\n\"You have to take the good with the bad sometimes and I understand people can get carried away and let their emotions get away from them, but I think [it is good to have] a reminder that it can have a serious effect on people's mental health.\"\n\nCain is back on Wales duty having helped Rhian Wilkinson's team end a 12-game winless streak in their most recent game, the 3-2 friendly triumph over Euro 2025 quarter-finalists Switzerland in December.\n\nCain scored a fine goal in that friendly success and is likely to be a key attacking player for Wilkinson as Wales' women attempt to reach a World Cup for the first time.\n\nThe Czech Republic game marks the start of a new era given that Jess Fishlock, Wales' greatest player, will be in the dugout rather than on the pitch having retired from international football last October.\n\nThough Fishlock is still playing at club level for Seattle Reign, the 39-year-old is with Wales as a technical assistant to Wilkinson.\n\nCain says Fishlock earned \"a little round of applause\" earlier this week after taking charge of a passing session on the training ground.\n\n\"It's just weird seeing her in a different-coloured kit, to be honest,\" Cain added.\n\n\"But playing with Jess, she kind of coaches you on the pitch as well, so it's not too different.\"\n\nPele, borrowed kits and Euro glory: The FAW at 150\n\nWales to tour country in World Cup qualifying\n\nWales, who host Montenegro in Llanelli in their second qualifier on Saturday, 7 March, can expect a stern test against a Czech Republic side who are ranked 31st in the world, one place above Wilkinson's team.\n\nBut Wales start Group B1 with top spot as their target, given that finishing first would give them a more favourable route through the play-offs for the 2027 World Cup.\n\nHaving been part of the Wales squad at Euro 2025, Cain says qualification for next year's tournament in Brazil would be \"absolutely incredible\".\n\n\"Obviously our first major tournament last year was absolutely immense and you never think it's going to get any better,\" she said.\n\n\"Then once that's done you're like OK, what's next? And then you're like, amazing, World Cup in Brazil – absolutely, why not?\"",

    "description": "How important is magnesium for brain health? According to one study, higher magnesium lowers dementia risk. Here's what the scientists found.",
    "fullText": "\"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links.\"\n\nEating more magnesium-rich foods may improve cognitive function and lower dementia risk, according to one study.\n\nResearchers say that magnesium reduces brain inflammation and may benefit post-menopausal women the most.\n\nExperts share how to safely increase your daily magnesium intake.\n\nLongevity is one of the hottest research areas in the health world right now. But doctors and scientists are not just trying to figure out how to help people live longer—instead, they're looking for ways to help you live longer in a healthy way, keeping your body strong and mobile and your mind sharp for as long as possible. One study contributing to this new body of research found that higher magnesium lowers dementia risk, while others are increasing our understanding of the role of magnesium in maintaining optimal brain health.\n\nHere, find out what the research says about magnesium and brain health, plus how to get enough of the mineral from your daily diet.\n\nMeet the experts: Khawlah Alateeq, Ph.D. researcher from the ANU National Centre for Epidemiology and Population Health; Melissa Mroz-Planells, D.C.N., R.D.N., national media spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and member of the Prevention Medical Review Board; Amit Sachdev, M.D., director of the Division of Neuromuscular Medicine at Michigan State University.\n\nThe study, published in the European Journal of Nutrition, utilized data from the UK Biobank and analyzed more than 6,000 cognitively healthy participants in the United Kingdom aged 40 to 73. Dietary magnesium was measured using a 24-hour recall questionnaire to estimate the daily amount people ingested and recorded five times over 16 months.\n\nResearchers found that people who consumed more than 550 milligrams (mg) of magnesium each day had a brain age that was approximately one year younger by the time they reached 55, compared to someone with a normal magnesium intake of about 350 mg a day. “Our study shows a 41% increase in magnesium intake could lead to less age-related brain shrinkage, which is associated with better cognitive function and lower risk or delayed onset of dementia in later life,” lead author and Ph.D. researcher Khawlah Alateeq, from the ANU National Centre for Epidemiology and Population Health, said in a press release.\n\nThe study also showed that higher dietary magnesium intake may contribute to protecting the brain earlier in the aging process and preventative effects may begin in your 40s or even earlier, Alateeq said in the press release. “This means people of all ages should be paying closer attention to their magnesium intake.” In addition to these findings, researchers also found that the brain-protective effects of more dietary magnesium appeared to benefit women more than men, and more so in post-menopausal than pre-menopausal women.\n\nWhile this study came out in 2023, research that has been published since continues to illuminate the role of magnesium in maintaining brain health and staving off dementia. A study in the Journal of Neurorestoratology found that magnesium may block key receptors in the brain to halt the course of Alzheimer's disease, plus reduce inflammation and oxidative stress, both of which contribute to the development of age-related chronic diseases like dementia.\n\nMagnesium is a mineral commonly found in nuts, seeds, leafy greens, and dairy, said Melissa Mroz-Planells, D.C.N., R.D.N., national media spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and member of the Prevention Medical Review Board. “Magnesium is necessary for the maintenance of our body tissues, including nerve signaling in the brain and the integrity of the blood-brain barrier.”\n\nIn addition to the findings of the above studies, magnesium deficiency has been associated with an increase in brain inflammation and with the development of diseases like Alzheimer’s disease, multiple sclerosis, and Parkinson’s disease, explained Mroz-Planells.\n\nAdditionally, there is a relationship between magnesium status, intake, and menopause that may account for some differences between men and women, said Mroz-Planells. “High intake of magnesium in post-menopausal women has been associated with lower levels of inflammatory markers like C-reactive protein, [a protein that indicates the level of inflammation in your body],” she explained.\n\nAdult magnesium needs vary by age and biological sex from 310-420 mg per day, according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The aforementioned study found the most brain health benefits in people who consumed 550 mg per day from food—according to the NIH, getting more than the recommended magnesium intake from food is not dangerous because the kidneys will eliminate any excess. However, there are some possible side effects from supplementing with high doses of magnesium, including diarrhea, nausea, and abdominal cramping. For this reason, always check with your doctor or a registered dietitian before adding a magnesium supplement or going over the recommended daily intake.\n\nFirst and foremost, try to increase your intake of magnesium-rich foods. According to Mroz-Planells, a sample day could include “cereal, milk, and a banana for breakfast, a sandwich on whole wheat bread with 1 cup of bean soup for lunch, 1 ounce of almonds for a snack, and a dinner of salmon, brown rice, and broccoli, providing around 350 mg of magnesium in total for the day.”\n\nIncluding magnesium-rich foods like whole grains and dark-green, leafy vegetables in your diet are beneficial for brain health no matter your age, said Mroz-Planells. “Eating a healthful diet has a positive impact on your brain health by reducing [brain] inflammation and providing the right nutrients for your brain’s optimal performance.”\n\nHealthy living leads to a healthy brain, affirmed Amit Sachdev, M.D., director of the Division of Neuromuscular Medicine at Michigan State University. While trying to consume enough magnesium is smart, “more common aspects of health, such as blood sugar and alcohol intake, are much more associated with brain health than magnesium,” he said. Making choices in the kitchen and in your daily life that will nourish your body is the best way to protect your brain as you age.\n\nDietary supplements are products intended to supplement the diet. They are not medicines and are not intended to treat, diagnose, mitigate, prevent, or cure diseases. Be cautious about taking dietary supplements if you are pregnant or nursing. Also, be careful about giving supplements to a child, unless recommended by their healthcare provider.\n\nCan Apple Cider Vinegar Lead to Weight Loss?\n\nBobbi Brown Shares Her Top Face-Transforming Makeup Tips for Women Over 50",

    "fullText": "After a frustrating draw with NYCFC that felt more like a loss Sunday, the LA Galaxy are back in action at Dignity Health Sports Park on Wednesday night. This time, for the second leg of their Concacaf Champions Cup opening round against Sporting San Miguelito.\n\nAfter the first leg, LA hold the advantage, last week's 1-1 draw in Panama means a win, or any scoreless draw, sends the Galaxy through to the round of 16, where Jamaican club Mt. Pleasant, the 2025 Caribbean Cup champion, awaits.\n\nIn Concacaf Champions Cup play, the away goals rule acts as the primary tiebreaker for two-legged knockout rounds (Round One through Semifinals). If the aggregate score is tied after two legs, the team with more away goals advances. If away goals are also equal, the tie goes directly to penalties.\n\nBut as head coach Greg Vanney made clear, the away goal conceded in the first leg makes this a precarious lead.\n\n“I think it's really up to them. It's a catch-22,” Vanney said of San Miguelito’s approach. “Ninety minutes is a long time, so I don't think you necessarily have to come out flying... It's really up to us to have the solution to whichever way they come.”\n\nFor a Galaxy side still trying to find its rhythm, that unpredictability is the central challenge. The team returned from Panama and looked sharp early against NYCFC, with new striker João Klauss scoring inside two minutes. But as Vanney noted, that sharpness faded.\n\nYour @LARiotSquad Player of the Match, João Klauss ⭐️ pic.twitter.com/2uKGPBkqbA\n\n— LA Galaxy (@LAGalaxy) February 24, 2026\n\n“We haven't had two back-to-back training sessions in a row since somewhere in Coachella,” Vanney explained. “We're actually trying to evolve a little bit inside of these games and solve some different looks.”\n\nThe \"look\" in Panama was a disciplined, bunkered approach from San Miguelito that the Galaxy couldn't fully break down, surrendering a goal that gave the visitors a precious away tally.\n\nThe \"look\" against NYCFC was a high press that the Galaxy solved early, only to stall after going down to ten men following a lengthy VAR review. The result was another draw, leaving the Galaxy with more questions than answers.\n\nNext up: @TheChampions at home on wednesday ⏭️ pic.twitter.com/aUmWrPJrLN\n\n— LA Galaxy (@LAGalaxy) February 23, 2026\n\n“We got off to a great start, and we just didn't deal with the ball well. I thought we defended really well for large stretches,” Vanney reflected on the NYCFC match. “We're evolving, and tomorrow is another opportunity to take a step.”\n\nThat step will require the Galaxy to dictate the tempo against a San Miguelito team that now has a clear objective: find a goal and hunker down defensively.\n\nVanney believes these dense, high-stakes fixtures are the perfect classroom for his squad.\n\n“What's beautiful about these moments is the team is facing different challenges,” he said. “Playing against a low block in Panama, your team has to change its mentality because they have to add speed into the game with the ball... These are great opportunities for our guys that are going to build a solid foundation.”\n\nThe Galaxy's midfield is slowly getting replenished, Vanney told reporters Isaiah Parente and Elijah Wynder are progressing and could be \"part of the group\" on Wednesday. He added Erik Thommy could make his debut Saturday against Charlotte and defender Chris Rindov was \"a little further behind\"\n\nKickoff is set for 8:30 p.m. from Dignity Health Sports Park.\n\nLocation: Dignity Health Sports Park, Carson, Calif.\n\nRadio: LA Galaxy Youtube Channel.",

    "fullText": "Philippe Coutinho was once among the most talented stars in European football. From a treble-winning loan spell at Bayern Munich in 2019/20 after some dazzling nights at Liverpool to a €135 million move to Barcelona, the Brazilian’s career seemed unstoppable at its peak. Now, it has reached an unexpected and sobering turn.\n\nPer a report from Tz, Coutinho has announced the termination of his contract with Vasco da Gama, his boyhood club in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The decision, confirmed via his social channels, came despite talks of a possible extension. Instead, the 33-year-old requested for a premature termination, one that the club granted.\n\nThe reason is deeply personal. Coutinho admitted he is “mentally exhausted.” Years of serious knee injuries have taken their toll, both physically and emotionally. Growing criticism from fans, including jeering during a recent cup match, only added to the weight.\n\nIn an emotional farewell, he described stepping away with a heavy heart, insisting his connection to Vasco remains strong. Whether this signals the end of his career or simply a pause remains unclear.",

    "description": "Snowstorms can become dangerous quickly, and because they're often treated as emergencies, the eventual melting of snow is rarely considered a risk.",
    "fullText": "In January, a historic snowstorm spanning several states blanketed millions of Americans in inches of powder and ice, bringing bitter, sustained low temperatures.\n\nAs that stubborn cold front began to wane, a second, subtler condition started \"stirring up hidden dangers,\" according to WILX.\n\nIn states affected by this bout of wintry extreme weather, persistent low temperatures ensured that snowdrifts quickly iced over.\n\nIn Michigan, weeks-old snow finally started melting — introducing a lesser-known risk.\n\nA 2017 study in the journal Environmental Pollution found that little was known about how snow reacts to pollutants and that snowpack absorbs a wide range of contaminants.\n\nWILX spoke with Dr. Dean McFarlane-Parrott, who explained that as the snow sat unmelting for weeks after the storm, \"vehicle exhaust, road salt, heavy metals,\" and other harmful carbon pollution slowly contaminated it.\n\nIn New York, WNYW reported similar concerns, adding that locals complained about dog feces buried in the city's snowdrifts. On Feb. 12, The New York Times reported on the city's melting snow, noting that it also posed a major pollution risk to the region's many waterways.\n\nAccording to WTOP, residents in the broader Washington, D.C., area were also facing rapidly melting snow and the health risks it posed.\n\nSnowstorms can become dangerous quickly, and because they're often treated as emergencies, the eventual melting of snow is rarely considered a risk.\n\nMelting snow doesn't just absorb pollution and release toxins as solids. As McFarlane-Parrott warned, the toxins released when snow melts create shockingly high levels of air pollution.\n\nWhat's the most you'd pay per month to put solar panels on your roof if there was no down payment?\n\nI'd only do it if someone else paid for it\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nLansing, Michigan, resident Zac Williams told WILX that he considered air quality ratings during wildfires, but not as an issue related to snow melting — however, the local air quality index was a risky 118 on Monday.\n\nMcFarlane-Parrott said that people often don't realize how dangerous poor air quality can be, particularly for vulnerable groups.\n\n\"If you can't carry oxygen well, then heart attacks go up, strokes go up,\" he said, per WILX. \"… Little kids who are developing their lung function, if they have asthma, it makes it worse as well. If the air quality index is high, you should rethink what you're doing.\"\n\nAs extreme weather becomes more frequent, awareness of critical climate issues, such as the subtle risks posed by melting snow, is more important than ever.\n\nThe New York Times suggested ways to mitigate the risks, including strategically placing green spaces to absorb runoff before it reaches rivers and waterways.\n\nResearchers are investigating alternatives to road salt to mitigate environmental damage, and the Times advised readers to \"shovel first\" and \"avoid the temptation to oversalt.\"\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": "Layoffs are often stressful. Find out what to do if you lose your job, including financial strategies and tips for effective networking.",
    "fullText": "Getting laid off can be frightening. Knowing how to respond if it happens can take away some of the fear, especially as large companies continue to cut workers.\n\nFirst off, it's worth considering that right after it happens, you'll likely be in shock. That's why it might not be wise to sign forms your employer might give you — at least not before taking time to review them with a clear head. You need to process what has occurred.\n\nOnce you do that, you'll be able to start your search for a new role. It's best to treat the hunt like, well, a job. That doesn't mean applying to everything you see; it just means having a plan.\n\nThat's in part because the average unemployment in the US as of January 2026 lasted about 5.5 months, according to Labor Department data. Naturally, that varies by industry and role. Some job seekers report that it's taken them far longer.\n\n\"I wouldn't dillydally in a market like this, because it can take a long time,\" Jennifer Schielke, the CEO of the staffing firm Summit Group Solutions, told Business Insider. \"Get into the rhythm that you're used to in the workplace.\"\n\nHere are three steps you'll want to consider taking following a layoff:\n\nAs you process what you've gone through, think about your goals, said former recruiter Mike Peditto.\n\n\"In stressful situations, your panicked reaction is almost never as good as the decision you make after reflection, processing, and intention-setting,\" he told Business Insider. That said, everyone's timeout might look different.\n\n\"Some people take a month off to travel, and that's great, but most people don't have that cushion. Take whatever you can,\" he said.\n\nIt's important to assess your situation. That means considering the health of your industry, but also your own. The search process can be lonely, so you might consider joining a support group for laid-off workers.\n\nYou might also want to consider how you can invest in yourself. That's especially important as AI threatens to upend an array of roles, especially for desk workers. Adding to your AI skills can make you more attractive to employers. Rather than prohibiting the technology in the interview process, some employers are now incorporating AI into how they assess job applicants to ensure their skills are up to date.\n\nEven though the job market can make it feel unreasonable to be choosy, it's worth reflecting on what you want from your next position.\n\nIt's also worth looking at what roles and industries are growing; they might provide opportunities.\n\nTaking practical steps can help you feel like you're reasserting control during what's often an uncertain time.\n\nFirst, collect the severance paperwork your employer gave you. Ask any questions you might have. Take time to review the documents, and don't forget that severance is sometimes negotiable.\n\nIt's also important to apply for unemployment benefits right away, because those can take a while to process. You might also need to figure out how to handle any stock options, think about what to do with your 401(k), and how long your health insurance or COBRA coverage will last.\n\nIt's also a good time to examine your spending and, if you haven't, craft a budget. There are numerous financial survival tips after a layoff, including canceling any unnecessary subscriptions and seeing whether you can get price breaks on your phone and internet bills.\n\nYou might get that ick feeling thinking of yourself as a brand, but, however you frame it, the reputation you've built through your work history and other interactions matters. It's a good time to reexamine your LinkedIn profile, add an \"open to work\" banner to attract recruiters, and let your connections know about your new status by drafting a layoff message.\n\nIf you've kept your résumé up to date, well done. In any case, you'll probably want to tweak it now. Focus on your skills, accomplishments, and impact, rather than just job titles.\n\nOnce you've done that, you can start reaching out to your network. Maybe set up some coffees or quick chats with connections, because that's often far more effective than panic-applying — what recruiters sometimes call \"spray and pray\" — to every job posting you find. Now is a good time to make a list of employers you want to target.\n\nGive some thought to how you will talk about your layoff in interviews. Consider what employers are after. One CEO who had 800 applications for a role told Business Insider why three stood out.\n\nYou might be fortunate enough to use your layoff as a chance to take bold steps — like negotiating for higher pay or better benefits in your next role.\n\nHave you been through a layoff? What made the difference when embarking on a job hunt? Business Insider would like to hear about your experience. Contact this reporter at tparadis@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "Comment: Precocious talent, mental-health concerns, and a failed drug test – what next for Garcia? Possibly a showdown with Britain’s Benn",
    "fullText": "Ryan Garcia and Conor Benn are a match made in hell, in the exact way that makes them heaven for boxing promoters. For now, a match-up between the American and the Briton is in purgatory, but the barriers could come crumbling down on Saturday.\n\nIn Las Vegas, Garcia will challenge Mario Barrios for the WBC welterweight title, to which Benn is the next mandatory challenger.\n\nNever mind the fact that Garcia, 27, is receiving this title shot on the back of a loss, in which he was dropped and outpointed by underdog Rolly Romero. Never mind that he entered the Romero fight after a year-long drug ban. Never mind that Benn’s last two fights were middleweight bouts with Chris Eubank Jr, in which he went 1-1. Never mind that he went through his own drug-test saga beforehand. All roads lead to Garcia vs Benn.\n\nStill, the terrain is often rocky in this sport.\n\nBenn, 29, has long said his greatest desire is to become WBC welterweight champion, yet he has also barked at any American star who will listen, as well as a 47-year-old Manny Pacquiao. Just a few weeks ago, the Briton was face-to-face with new WBO champion Shakur Stevenson, having “messaged” the four-weight king over a possible showdown in the preceding weeks.\n\nYet the general thinking is that the unbeaten Stevenson, 28, would prove too slick for Benn, in a way that the inconsistent Garcia might not. Indeed, in Garcia, Benn might have found the ideal opponent and perfect rivalry to follow the blood feud with Eubank Jr.\n\nHowever, Garcia must first overcome Barrios, and “King Ryan”’s past struggles in and out of the ring mean that is no guarantee. One cannot overlook his loss to Romero in May, his stoppage by Gervonta Davis in 2023, nor past concerns over his mental health – due to, in his own words, his habit of “drinking every day” before his bout with Devin Haney.\n\nIn that contest in 2024, Garcia was electric. He had gone 3-3 with his fellow American during their amateur careers, but the feeling was that, at this level, the unbeaten Haney would prove too clinical and elusive for Garcia. But Garcia dropped the “Dream” three times en route to a points win. Of course, that victory was ruined by the revelation of a failed drug test, with the result overturned and Garcia banned for a year.\n\nNaturally, that adverse test result had fans and pundits questioning the legitimacy of Garcia’s performance against Haney, but King Ryan may not need to match that level to see off Barrios; with respect, the 30-year-old is seen as one of the weaker champions in boxing right now, and he enters Vegas on the back of two straight draws – one of which came against an aged Pacquiao. So, Garcia is the favourite on Saturday, and the question is whether he can live up to that status, after he failed to against Romero.\n\nIf he can, boxing may have a scintillating new rivalry: one between two admittedly-flawed fighters.\n\nFor Benn, Garcia represents a more-beatable opponent than Stevenson, and a more-marketable one than Barrios. In that way, a Garcia victory would be the perfect outcome for Benn this weekend.\n\nThere are other options out there for Benn, such as a clash with Northern Ireland’s Lewis Crocker for the IBF belt. However, the risk-reward ratio of that fight might not tip in the right direction for the “Destroyer”.\n\nIn truth, the profile of Benn’s opponents from here on out feels more important than their status; that is to say: Benn should share the ring with big names, whether or not they carry title belts.\n\nBut again, in Garcia, he might have encountered someone who can bring both. And so Benn will watch from ringside at T-Mobile Arena, it seems.\n\n“I don’t think he has a big presence in America, but I would be willing to go to the UK,” Garcia said of Benn in November. “I would definitely be willing to go to the UK to fight him. He seems like a fun match-up. He’s gonna come crazy and throw bombs all night and thinks he’s gonna overwhelm me, but he won’t.\n\n“But I would love to fight him. I love fighting Eddie Hearn’s fighters, I don’t know why, I just love to beat them up. He just makes you want to beat his fighters up. It’s just the way he talks, the way he moves, I can’t wait to look at his face and say: ‘I did it again.’\n\n“That would bring so much joy to me, almost more than a championship title. I would be ecstatic just to see Eddie's face, sad and confused. I beat Luke Campbell, Devin Haney – he was representing him, I beat him. I’m ready to beat up Conor now.”\n\nIn any case, Garcia must beat up Barrios. Then, fans will hope the road to Garcia vs Benn remains firm under the fighters’ feet. The press conferences would be engrossing, and the fight itself would be captivating. Yes, Garcia and Benn are flawed, but at this precise moment, they could make each other whole.\n\nEditor’s note: Friday brought the shock news that Benn is leaving Hearn’s promotional company, Matchroom, to join rivals Zuffa Boxing. Given Zuffa’s desire to move away from boxing’s traditional belt system, it is conceivable that Benn will soon lose his status as WBC mandatory challenger.",

    "description": "Consumers should stop using the product immediately.",
    "fullText": "Freeze-dried food and treats have become a popular feeding option for both cats and dogs. The food provides a better delivery system for nutrients to your pets without the downsides of raw food, which can pose a salmonella risk.\n\nHowever, freeze-dried foods are not exempt from recalls. One popular cat food brand recently issued a voluntary recall for their freeze-dried chicken cat nuggets. It wasn't for bacterial contamination, though. This recall was due to a possible vitamin deficiency.\n\n🐶\nView the complete details on this recall at: https://t.co/E5Zy1sSKuI pic.twitter.com/pSb6bD7qW0\n\n— U.S. FDA Recalls (@FDArecalls) February 18, 2026\n\nIf your cat is eating the Quest Cat Food Chicken Recipe, you need to check your pantry. The voluntary recall affects one specific lot: C25288 with the UPC: 6-91730-18103-1 and a Best Buy Date of 10/15/2027. The zip-lock bags were sold in Colorado, Utah, Washington, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Michigan, California, Texas and Illinois. The affected batch may have low thiamine levels, also known as vitamin B1.\n\nThe recall of the freeze-dried nuggets was triggered after a cat owner reported illness in their cat. Thankfully, a veterinarian treated the cat, and it has recovered. So far, it is the only cat to have experienced adverse effects from the product.\n\nThe product was tested by the veterinarian who treated the ill cat, and the test indicated that the lot did not meet the required thiamine levels to support a cat's diet. Quest conducted further testing to verify that the lot may have low thiamine levels. Quest's parent company, Go Raw LLC, has already taken measures to ensure that this doesn't happen again.\n\nThiamine is considered an essential nutrient for cats. According to a 2017 study, the water-soluble vitamin helps animals process carbohydrates, synthesize nucleotides, and maintain normal nervous system function. Since they can't produce the vitamin on their own, they need to consume at least 0.33 to 0.35 milligrams per day to maintain healthy levels.\n\nWhile deficiencies can be reversed if caught early enough, they can lead to severe medical issues. According to the FDA's press release, cats' nervous systems and stomachs can be affected. \"Early signs of thiamine deficiency may include decreased appetite, salivation, vomiting, failure to grow, and weight loss,\" the release said. \"In advanced cases, neurological signs may develop, including ventroflexion (bending towards the floor) of the neck, mental dullness, vision changes, wobbly walking, circling, falling, and seizures.\"\n\nIf not treated in time, cats can also become so ill that they die from their symptoms. Go Raw LLC has said that consumers should immediately stop using the product and return it to the store where it was purchased for a full refund. If you have any questions, you can email the company at cs@gorawllc.com or call them at (801) 432-7478, Monday through Friday, 9 am to 4 p.m. MST.",

    "fullText": "Exclusive: England and Wales charity to examine safeguards after Guardian exposed ‘very dangerous’ advice on Google AI Overviews\n\n‘Very dangerous’: a Mind mental health expert on Google’s AI summaries\n\nMind is launching a significant inquiry into artificial intelligence and mental health after a Guardian investigation exposed how Google’s AI Overviews gave people “very dangerous” medical advice.\n\nIn a year-long commission, the mental health charity, which operates in England and Wales, will examine the risks and safeguards required as AI increasingly influences the lives of millions of people affected by mental health issues worldwide.\n\nThe inquiry – the first of its kind globally – will bring together the world’s leading doctors and mental health professionals, as well as people with lived experience, health providers, policymakers and tech companies. Mind says it will aim to shape a safer digital mental health ecosystem, with strong regulation, standards and safeguards.\n\nThe launch comes after the Guardian revealed how people were being put at risk of harm by false and misleading health information in Google AI Overviews. The AI-generated summaries are shown to 2 billion people a month, and appear above traditional search results on the world’s most visited website.\n\nAfter the reporting, Google removed AI Overviews for some but not all medical searches. Dr Sarah Hughes, chief executive officer of Mind, said “dangerously incorrect” mental health advice was still being provided to the public. In the worst cases, the bogus information could put lives at risk, she said.\n\nHughes said: “We believe AI has enormous potential to improve the lives of people with mental health problems, widen access to support, and strengthen public services. But that potential will only be realised if it is developed and deployed responsibly, with safeguards proportionate to the risks.\n\n“The issues exposed by the Guardian’s reporting are among the reasons we’re launching Mind’s commission on AI and mental health, to examine the risks, opportunities and safeguards needed as AI becomes more deeply embedded in everyday life.\n\n“We want to ensure that innovation does not come at the expense of people’s wellbeing, and that those of us with lived experience of mental health problems are at the heart of shaping the future of digital support.”\n\nGoogle has said its AI Overviews, which use generative AI to provide snapshots of essential information about a topic or question, are “helpful” and “reliable”.\n\nBut the Guardian found some AI Overviews served up inaccurate health information and put people at risk of harm. The investigation uncovered false and misleading medical advice across a range of issues, including cancer, liver disease and women’s health, as well as mental health conditions.\n\nExperts said some AI Overviews for conditions such as psychosis and eating disorders offered “very dangerous advice” and were “incorrect, harmful or could lead people to avoid seeking help”.\n\nGoogle is also downplaying safety warnings that its AI-generated medical advice may be wrong, the Guardian found.\n\nHughes said vulnerable people were being served “dangerously incorrect guidance on mental health”, including “advice that could prevent people from seeking treatment, reinforce stigma or discrimination and in the worst cases, put lives at risk”.\n\nShe added: “People deserve information that is safe, accurate and grounded in evidence, not untested technology presented with a veneer of confidence.”\n\nIf you have something to share about this story, you can contact Andrew using one of the following methods.\n\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories. Messages are end to end encrypted and concealed within the routine activity that every Guardian mobile app performs. This prevents an observer from knowing that you are communicating with us at all, let alone what is being said.\n\nIf you don’t already have the Guardian app, download it (iOS/Android) and go to the menu. Select ‘Secure Messaging’.\n\nIf you don’t need a high level of security or confidentiality you can email andrew.gregory@theguardian.com\n\nSecureDrop and other secure methods\n\nIf you can safely use the tor network without being observed or monitored you can send messages and documents to the Guardian via our SecureDrop platform.\n\nFinally, our guide at theguardian.com/tips lists several ways to contact us securely, and discusses the pros and cons of each.\n\nThe commission, which will run for a year, will gather evidence on the intersection of AI and mental health, and provide an “open space” where the experience of people with mental health conditions will be “seen, recorded and understood”.\n\nRosie Weatherley, information content manager at Mind, said that although Googling mental health information “wasn’t perfect” before AI Overviews, it usually worked well. She said: “Users had a good chance of clicking through to a credible health website that answered their query, and then went further – offering nuance, lived experience, case studies, quotes, social context and an onward journey to support.\n\n“AI Overviews replaced that richness with a clinical-sounding summary that gives an illusion of definitiveness. They give the user more of one form of clarity (brevity and plain English), while giving them less of another form of clarity (security in the source of the information, and how much to trust it). It’s a very seductive swap, but not a responsible one.”\n\nA Google spokesperson said: “We invest significantly in the quality of AI Overviews, particularly for topics like health, and the vast majority provide accurate information.\n\n“For queries where our systems identify a person might be in distress, we work to display relevant, local crisis hotlines. Without being able to review the examples referenced, we can’t comment on their accuracy.”",

    "fullText": "Meta chief says it has improved identifying underage users but adds ‘I always wish we could have gotten there sooner’\n\nThe Meta CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, testified at a landmark trial of social media companies on Wednesday. Plaintiffs’ lawyers grilled Zuckerberg about internal complaints that not enough was being done to verify whether children under 13 were using the platform.\n\nZuckerberg claimed Meta had improved in identifying underage users but also said: “I always wish that we could have gotten there sooner.”\n\nZuckerberg also said some users lie about their age when joining Instagram and that the company removes those it identifies as underage. The plaintiffs’ lawyers hit back at those claims: “You expect a nine-year-old to read all of the fine print? That’s your basis for swearing under oath that children under 13 are not allowed?” After repeated questioning about age verification, Zuckerberg said: “I don’t see why this is so complicated.”\n\nIn response to questioning by the plaintiffs’ attorney, Zuckerberg also said: “I think a reasonable company should try to help the people that use its services.”\n\nAsked about media training and his famously stiff responses to public questioning: he said: “I think I’m actually well-known to be sort of bad at this.”\n\nThe Meta chief was flanked by people wearing the Meta Ray-Ban artificial intelligence glasses, and the judge in the courtroom threatened to hold anyone recording with the devices in contempt.\n\nWhen he arrived at court, Zuckerberg was asked by a security guard at a metal detector if he had any metal on him. “I have a gold chain on,” he responded, according to the New York Post.\n\nLawyers for the plaintiffs, who argue that Meta intentionally designed its social media platforms to be addictive, questioned Zuckerberg about whether he knew of harms his company’s products could inflict on young people’s mental health. The plaintiffs have already made public internal documents they say prove their point.\n\nThis is the first time Zuckerberg has addressed concerns about child safety before a jury at trial. Tech companies have long relied on a federal law that shields them from liability for content posted by users, but the plaintiffs’ novel argument – which is focused on harmful design and not individual actors – has so far sidestepped this defense.\n\nThe initial trial in Los Angeles focuses on a 20-year-old woman, known as KGM, who says her compulsive use of YouTube and Instagram worsened her depression and suicidal thoughts. KGM’s case is one of about 20 “bellwether” cases – designed to be test cases to gauge a jury’s reaction. TikTok and Snap settled in the initial trial but will still be defendants in hundreds of other cases.\n\nZuckerberg’s testimony comes about a week after Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri spoke on the witness stand. Mosseri pushed back on the science behind social media addiction by denying users could be “clinically addicted”. He described children’s high usage of Instagram as “problematic use” – similar to “watching TV for longer than you feel good about”. Psychologists do not classify social media addiction as an official diagnosis, but many researchers have documented the harmful consequences of compulsive use among young people, and lawmakers around the world are worried about its addictive potential.\n\nPaul Schmidt, one of Meta’s attorneys, previously said in his opening statement that the company acknowledged KGM’s mental health issues but disputed that Instagram played a significant role in exacerbating them. He cited medical records to suggest the primary issue was a difficult home life.\n\nTwo years ago, Zuckerberg fielded similar questions in a heated congressional hearing about child exploitation. In January 2024, Zuckerberg turned directly towards grieving parents on the Senate floor to apologize, promising to continue investments to protect children. Those families were not convinced that Meta would make meaningful progress, and still aren’t; they are hoping the courts can provide more relief. These trials could eventually result in large payouts from tech companies and changes in the way social media platforms are designed.\n\n“His apology – if you will call it that – was mostly empty,” said John DeMay, who was present in the Senate hearing room in 2024. DeMay’s son, Jordan, was 17 when he died by suicide in 2022, hours after being targeted in an online sextortion scam on Instagram. “He basically said they’re doing everything they can to stop and prevent this stuff from happening and unfortunately that’s just not the case.”\n\nIn the two years since, DeMay has visited Capitol Hill frequently to advocate for online child safety – but has been frustrated by the lack of progress. DeMay’s lawsuit is one of the many cases that will be considered as part of a judicial council coordination proceeding. He has more faith in the courts than Congress, and has previously attended hearings in the current trial, although he was following Wednesday’s proceedings from his home in Michigan.\n\n“I’m hopeful that this case prevails but if it doesn’t, we still won because we showed the world – with on the record evidence – that they’re doing one thing and saying another,” DeMay said.\n\nMeta is also involved in separate litigation in New Mexico, where prosecutors accuse the company of violating the state’s consumer protection laws; Meta failed to disclose what it knew about how its social media platforms could harm children, they say. Meta has denied those claims.\n\nInstagram has, in recent years, added some safety features aimed at its young users. But a 2025 review of these tools by Fairplay – a non-profit that advocates for reducing the influence of big tech on children – found “that less than one in five are fully functional and two-thirds (64%) are either substantially ineffective or no longer exist”.\n\nSome former Meta employees have said that the company has been dismissive of warnings around child safety. Kelly Stonelake left Meta on medical leave, in February 2023, after she faced harassment and retaliation for raising such concerns, she says. Stonelake sued Meta last year over the issue, and also alleged a toxic pattern of silencing women.\n\nShe alleges Meta was collecting data on kids without parental consent and exposing them to other adults and “an environment that we knew was riddled with harassment and bullying”.",

    "fullText": "After winning a gold medal at the 2026 Winter Olympics, photographers zeroed in on U.S. figure skater Alyssa Liu’s teeth - and the silver spikes that appeared to hover over them.\n\nThe 20-year-old athlete, from California, has what’s called a frenulum or “smiley” piercing, one that pierces the skin connecting the gums to the upper lip.\n\nLiu did the piercing herself, she explained in an interview before the games.\n\nBut while the body jewelry may look cool, experts warn getting these piercings come with a risk of infection and can damage oral health.\n\nMouth piercings are particularly risky because of the millions of bacteria that live in our mouths, according to Colgate. “There's a greater risk of infection when you pierce the inside of your mouth versus getting your ears pierced because of the bacteria,” the mouth care brand says.\n\nInfections can easily develop following oral piercings if the jewelry and surrounding areas are improperly cleaned or touched with dirty hands.\n\nInfection can lead to gum disease that causes teeth to fall out, and inflammation that may result in irreversible receding gums, exposing the sensitive roots of the teeth.\n\nIn much rarer cases, people can also develop Hepatitis B, C, D, E and G, oral hygiene brands Crest and Oral B note. They may also be infected with tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, fungal and bacterial infections like candidiasis and cellulitis or even the heart valve infection, endocarditis.\n\n“Smiley piercings are done on a very sensitive area, and it requires adequate care; otherwise, it can lead to infection and cause adverse effects,” Rodeo Dental Care cautions.\n\nThese piercings can bring about other issues for the teeth and mouth. Piercings can lead to swelling, bleeding, bruising, nerve damage, inflammation and traumatized tissue around the piercing site. They can even impact taste and saliva production.\n\nThe metal piercing can harm teeth over time, as well, because of its near-constant movement in the mouth.\n\nIt can bump and scratch the teeth, resulting in enamel erosion and cracked or chipped teeth. Enamel protects against tooth decay, and it wears away over time.\n\nAll of these risks are why it’s important not to “DIY” your piercings, dentists say.\n\n“After understanding the risks, if you still decide to get an oral piercing make sure the procedure is performed by a trained professional who uses sterile instruments,” advises cosmetic dentist Dr. Edward Liu. “Consult with your dentist before getting an oral piercing to learn proper aftercare and maintenance that will help you reduce your risk of infection or complication.”",

    "fullText": "\"What did you do today?\" my superager grandmother Rosine, nicknamed Neni, asks me almost as soon as she picks up the phone on our nightly chats.\n\nAt 95, Neni lives on her own in the sunlit condo she bought as a widow in her fifties. Her main complaints are fatigue, hip pain, insomnia, and swelling in her ankles, mostly due to a heart that's running out of lifetime. Still, she plows through her roster of self-imposed tasks as though her worth depends on the state of her carpets and cabinets.\n\nShe still bakes, speaks up at condo board meetings, scrubs her floors on her bony knees, and climbs atop her rickety rattan chairs to dust a chandelier that doesn't need much dusting. She makes her bed every morning, no matter how badly she slept and still wants to sleep, careful not to leave a single crease in her comforter.\n\nBut no matter how much she handles, she gets down and defeated because she's not like \"before.\" Neni is both tireless and tired.\n\nWe've always been close, but we've become closer in recent years since we discovered we have \n\nI shouldn't be able to relate to Neni's frustrations about not doing enough and not being the person she used to be, but I do. I see myself in the way she slams into her chair, a controlled descent too difficult to orchestrate with joints and nerves out of tune. I see myself in her curved spine, backed-up bowels, and anxiety.\n\nShe's 55 years older than me, except that I've aged before aging. Like Neni, I had a hysterectomy in my late 30s. Like her, the anemia that keeps me breathless has more to do with marrow than menstruation. We share the same cancer genes, the same allergies, the same immune system dysfunction.\n\nI've had to reboot my career after my Ph.D. to accommodate an illness that won't leave. I know how unsettling it feels to plant new offshoots while mourning the roots that rotted away.\n\nWe've become unlikely companions, brought together by the bodies that fail us.\n\nNeni and I confide in each other. We vent about our incontinence and maddeningly itching skin. I understand her when she says she doesn't recognize herself in the mirror, doesn't fit into her pants, can't bridge the gap between want and can. I never knew, before this, how much grief aging and chronic illness share.\n\n\"Are you constipated?\" she asks me at least twice a week. She reminds me not to lift anything heavy, to have a banana for potassium, and not to overwater the plant she gave me.\n\nSometimes she asks me, \"Is lasting living?\"\n\nShe's not only outlasted her husband but also most of the people she's known and loved. She's left behind a country, a language she once spoke fluently, and a craft her hands can no longer do. As immigrants, success meant enduring, sweeping pain under the rug to adapt and belong. But resilience has a downside: the stronger you are, the stronger you're expected to be.\n\nTogether, we've practiced pacing ourselves rather than pushing beyond our limits and paying for it later. Neni has always believed that rest is lazy, even when it's earned. Now, she's beginning to let herself nap to replenish her precious energy.\n\nIn turn, she's been teaching me about resourcefulness and patience, and about how worthwhile things take the time they need. An avid gardener who nurses plants back to health and distributes thriving offshoots to her neighbors, she reminds me that blooms happen on their own schedule and seasons can't be rushed.\n\n\"Don't be afraid,\" she tells me when the uncertainty with my health, my creativity, and surrogacy has me feeling unsteady. She reminds me that hard work and a little magic (but especially her prayers) go a long way.\n\nAs anxious as I am about her leaving and my aging, I know this bond we have is sacred. I also know she's doing much more than just \"lasting;\" she's in her space, with her music and her recipes, running her home as best as she can, even if her best fluctuates. Her resolve is stronger than her heartbeat.\n\nShe reminds me every day that there's pride in organizing a home and finding comfort in order, rituals, light, and togetherness. These small acts of survival might just be our greatest legacy.",

    "description": "The history of AS Roma, its strong following, and its eagerness to play at the top level, both nationally and at the European level, preconditions the formation of the image of the football club, whic...",
    "fullText": "The history of AS Roma, its strong following, and its eagerness to play at the top level, both nationally and at the European level, preconditions the formation of the image of the football club, which is admittedly one of the most prestigious in Italy. In the contemporary game, in which control of finances and economic sustainability has become as vital as on-field strategies, Roma’s financial health is also a decisive factor in the development of its sporting goals.\n\nThat said, the interactions between the prudent accounting, the strategic investment and the competitive results are the key to the realization of why and how Roma is placed in Serie A and further. With fans tracking each turn of the season and weighing the chances on sites such as wetttippsheute that capture expectations and overall sentiment, the club’s financial position can be used to justify what can and cannot happen and to identify the limits.\n\nThe competitive strength of a club in the transfer market is dependent on the sources of revenue. For Roma, broadcast revenues continue to constitute a major source of revenue, yet international business is gaining significance. Promoting the club brand with international partners increases visibility and generates funds that can be reinvested in squad improvements.\n\nThese financial flows enable Roma to make more manoeuvres in the transfer market. Investing in high-potential young talent and retaining core performers constitutes a strategic approach to balancing short-term competitiveness and long-term growth. Nevertheless, such an approach should be supported by strict compliance with regulatory standards to prevent fines that may hinder sporting performance.\n\nThe Financial Fair Play (FFP) and other UEFA regulatory strategies ensure the financial fairness of clubs by maintaining a reasonable balance between spending and revenue, thereby preventing excessive use of funds. Adherence to these regulations would ensure that Roma is permitted to participate in European competitions and is not sanctioned, thereby discouraging Roma’s sporting goals.\n\nIn the case of Roma, it is very important to carefully plan finances as a way to navigate regulatory requirements. Any transfer, contract renewal, and any marketing initiative should not only be assessed on its sporting basis but also on its accounting basis. FFP compliance is no longer a procedural requirement; it is a strategic requirement that permeates the decision-making across every tier of the club.\n\nOne of the biggest expenses incurred by any football club is the wages of players. This must be managed effectively to achieve financial balance. The Roma wage system has been repeatedly revisited to align wages with performance and long-term sustainability.\n\nThis strategy has altered the squad’s strategy. Instead of pursuing a few high-profile contracts that may disrupt the wage ladder, Roma has sought prudence. This implies promoting performance, incorporating performance-based bonuses, and maintaining a wage structure that does not make the financial burden disproportionate.\n\nMoreover, this discipline is effective in that it sometimes hinders the acquisition of marquee names and at other times it has averted the financial pitfalls of the kind of fiscal vulnerability that has plagued clubs that have overspent. This restraint, in the case of Roma, can protect the club’s future while allowing competitive additions without compromising its tactical and cultural values.\n\nThe financial strategy of Roma is manifested in the transfer market strategy. The club focuses on players who are not only compatible with a specific tactical system but also provide more than merely on-field value. This philosophy includes younger talent with resale value, those in their prime whose wage demands are balanced, and those with strategic loan agreements.\n\nRather than engaging in bidding wars and inflating costs to an unsustainable level, Roma’s leadership tends to adopt a more calculated approach to its acquisition plans, minimizing financial risk and improving team quality. This cautious market participation can help Roma remain competitive in Serie A and European competitions without compromising its financial position.\n\nThe long-term objective of AS Roma is to play at the peak of Italian and European football. Such a dream, though, needs to be anchored in the financial reality. The club’s strategy on competition is based on the understanding that the financial health and success in the sport do not oppose one another but are mutually dependent on long-term success.\n\nThe financial well-being of AS Roma is not merely an accounting footnote but a key factor in how the club develops its competitive positioning. The strength of the financial base determines the capacity to compete in the transfer market, remain in regulatory compliance, and invest intelligently both in players and infrastructure.\n\nIn a game where financial misjudgment can result in on-screen losses, Roma’s focus on financial control and strategic development is a match between sporting aspiration and business feasibility. This strategy can be used to keep the club competitive enough to compete for honours and maintain its financial stability in the future.",

You may even get sweaty in them at the gym.\n\nBut an investigation into headphones has found every single pair tested contained substances hazardous to human health, including chemicals that can cause cancer, neurodevelopmental problems and the feminisation of males.\n\nEven products by market-leading brands such as Bose, Panasonic, Samsung and Sennheiser were found to contain harmful chemicals in the formulation of the plastics from which they are made.\n\nCampaigners condemned “a market-wide failure” as they called for broad bans on whole classes of endocrine-disrupting chemicals in consumer goods and greater transparency from manufacturers about what is in their products.\n\n“These chemicals are not just additives; they may be migrating from the headphones into our body,” said Karolína Brabcová, chemical expert at Arnika, part of the ToxFree LIFE for All project, a partnership of central European civil society groups that carried out the research.\n\n“Daily use – especially during exercise when heat and sweat are present – accelerates this migration directly to the skin.\n\n“Although there is no immediate health risk, the long-term exposures – especially for vulnerable groups like teenagers – is of great concern. There is no ‘safe’ level for endocrine disruptors that mimic our natural hormones.”\n\nAround the world, there is increasing concern over the potential impacts of contaminating ecosystems, animals and humans with synthetic chemicals, and fears they are linked to the global rise in rates of cancer, obesity and infertility.\n\nMany chemicals that have become ubiquitous, such as bisphenols, phthalates and poly- and per-fluoroalkyl substances (Pfas) have subsequently been discovered to have drastic biological effects. Despite that, many continue to be used in the manufacture of consumer goods, with little public awareness of what they are and what they might be doing to people.\n\nResearchers say that while individual doses from particular sources may be low, a “cocktail effect” of daily, multi-source exposure nevertheless poses potentially severe long-term risks to health.\n\nCampaigners from the ToxFree project said they decided to investigate the presence of such chemicals in headphones because the devices had “transitioned from occasional accessories to essential tools”, worn by users for long periods.\n\nResearchers bought 81 pairs of in-ear and over-ear headphones, either on the market in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Slovenia and Austria, or from the online marketplaces Shein and Temu, and took them for laboratory analysis, testing for a range of harmful chemicals.\n\n“Hazardous substances were detected in every product tested,” they said.\n\nBisphenol A (BPA) appeared in 98% of samples, and its substitute, bisphenol S (BPS), was found in more than three-quarters. Synthetic chemicals used to stiffen plastic, BPA and BPS mimic the action of oestrogen inside organisms, causing a range of adverse effects including the feminisation of males, early onset puberty in girls, and cancer. Previous studies have shown that bisphenols can migrate from synthetic materials into sweat, and that they can be absorbed through the skin.\n\n“Given the prolonged skin contact associated with headphone use, dermal exposure represents a relevant pathway, and it is reasonable to assume that similar migration of BPA and its substitutes may occur from headphone components directly to the user’s skin,” the researchers said.\n\nAlso found in the headphones tested were phthalates, potent reproductive toxins that can impair fertility; chlorinated paraffins, which have been linked to liver and kidney damage; and brominated and organophosphate flame retardants, which have similar endocrine disrupting properties to bisphenols. Most were, however, found in only trace quantities.\n\nThe headphones investigation is the third undertaken by the ToxFree project. Previous investigations found bisphenol A, a known hormone disruptor, in baby dummies, including some labelled BPA-free, and that one in three pairs of women’s underpants contained toxic chemicals.\n\nBose, Panasonic, Samsung and Sennheiser did not respond to requests for comment.",

    "description": "Stanley 1913 wants to expand beyond viral tumblers with the Vitalize collection, focusing on wellness and appealing to both male and female consumers.",
    "fullText": "Stanley 1913 is ready to go beyond its viral moment.\n\nThe drinkware company is best known for its Stanley Quencher line of 40-ounce tumblers, which has exploded in popularity since 2020 alongside reusable water bottles. Stanley has ridden that wave with viral product launches that have flown off of shelves. Its collaboration with the \"Wicked\" movie franchise, for example, caused a frenzy at Target in 2024.\n\nNow, Stanley is setting out to show it's more than a TikTok fad known for limited-edition cup drops.\n\nIt's trying to turn a new tide by taking advantage of another hot trend: wellness. Global President Matt Navarro told Business Insider in an interview that Stanley wants to meet customers where they're at, which, increasingly, happens to be the gym or the yoga studio.\n\n\"They want products that support their health and wellness lives,\" Navarro told Business Insider.\n\nThe company is launching a new product line on Tuesday to serve that audience and avoid becoming too reliant on TikTok virality.\n\nStanley is betting on its Vitalize line to kick-start its new chapter. It features a new tote bag, backpack, and shaker bottle, designed to support people on the go who want to bring their Stanley cup with them. The bags come with pockets and straps to carry Stanley cups.\n\n\"It's about really understanding today's consumer,\" Navarro said. \"They're constantly on the move.\"\n\nThe shaker bottle is made for protein, which Navarro said is having \"an incredible moment\" based on his observations at the grocery store.\n\nThe Vitalize drop comes as Stanley's position as the top drinkware brand is in question. A 2025 survey of more than 500 Morgan Stanley interns found that Stanley tumblers lagged in popularity compared to brands like Owala. Piper Sandler's 2024 Taking Stock With Teens survey found that teens saw Stanley as \"on the way out\" of style.\n\nNavarro pushed back on the narrative that Stanley is becoming stale.\n\n\"Whether you're 14 or 44, as long as we're meeting them in the right places in their lives, then we'll continue to remain relevant,\" he said.\n\nStanley's Quencher series may be losing momentum, but the company is exploring an identity as a lifestyle brand. Navarro said Stanley is paying close attention to what consumers want while sticking to its roots.\n\nThe Vitalize bags infuse the drinkware it's known for with wearable accessories, such as carrying straps that fit your Stanley cup.\n\n\"They're balancing work, play, yoga, all their passions in life, and they want products that fit into their lifestyle,\" Navarro said.\n\nThe tote and backpack aren't Stanley's first venture beyond drinkware. It also sells camping cookware, pet bowls, and a crossbody strap to carry your tumbler.\n\nNavarro said Stanley started as a brand for the working man in 1913 before shifting to an outdoor focus in 1965. Thanks to social media, it's evolved into a brand beloved by women. Collaborations with \"Wicked\" and lifestyle brand LoveShackFancy have drawn the attention of female consumers over the years.\n\nHowever, with the new shaker, backpack, and tote, Stanley also aims to attract more male customers, Navarro said.\n\nIt's also using partnerships, such as those with soccer star Lionel Messi and global football club Paris Saint-Germain, to win over men.\n\n\"Our partnerships work because they're authentic to us, and they're also authentic to our consumer,\" Navarro said.",

    "fullText": "Tyler Reddick and his family went through a tough time in the latter half of 2025. The Cup Series driver’s infant son, Rookie, had to undergo surgery to remove a kidney after he was diagnosed with a tumor that was increasing the stress on his heart. In an interview after he won the Daytona 500 on Sunday, he detailed how the NASCAR community helped him in those days.\n\nRookie was born on May 25, 2025. It was around late September when doctors at the Atrium Health Levine Children’s Hospital in Charlotte confirmed that he had a tumor in his chest and that it was compressing his renal artery and vein. This was causing his heart to work heavier than normal, and it was why he was showing signs of heart failure.\n\nAny parent in this situation would be terrified, and Reddick was too. Fortunately, he received some able support from his friends. He said, “Michael and everybody at 23XI Racing basically told me, ‘Look. If you need to step away and not run another race… do whatever you need to do.’ Just having everyone’s support along the way was incredible.”\n\nThe support wasn’t limited to his team. He continued, “When my wife was headed down there, Rick Hendrick and his whole group were doing everything they could to kind of expedite the process for Rookie. Joey Logano, a fellow competitor of mine, was reaching out, doing everything he could to pick up Beau and let him go hang out with Joey’s kids while we were dealing with that.”\n\nHe quipped that the amount of support he got from the NASCAR community throughout the whole deal was incredible. At the end of the day, all that matters is that the boy is safe and is recovering well. The cherry on top of the cake is that Rookie actually began crawling for the first time during the Daytona 500 weekend.\n\nReddick was jubilant about that as well. To win the Harley J. Earl trophy and to celebrate it with his family after undergoing such scary battles must be a memorable moment for him. The season has just begun under the Chase format, and he has kicked off on the best foot possible.\n\nBut winning the championship will require consistency at this same level throughout the year. Reddick is only too capable of producing that. Without question, Rookie, too, wouldn’t mind visiting more Victory Lanes with his father.\n\nThe post How NASCAR Team Owners and Drivers Supported Tyler Reddick After His Son’s Unfortunate Health Condition appeared first on The SportsRush.",

    "description": "Moving from San Francisco to a smaller city in the Southern California countryside has come with benefits for our health and finances.",
    "fullText": "When I moved to San Francisco almost 13 years ago, I never imagined how much it would help my career — and, unexpectedly, lead me to fall in love with the country outside of it.\n\nI have always lived in cities, from Viña del Mar, Chile, where I was born, to Los Angeles, where I grew up. However, my marketing career didn't really take off until I moved to San Francisco, the epicenter of the startup boom.\n\nThere, I had everything I wanted: I was surrounded by potential clients, I dined at fancy restaurants, I made great friends, and I had no shortage of access to top music venues, cafés, bars, and wine-country weekends.\n\nI fell in love with San Francisco, which was like a huge playground for adults with no kids. It's also where I met and married the love of my life.\n\nBut in 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic swept the US, I had my first child and San Francisco (like many other big cities) seemed to empty out. That's when my husband and I decided we'd like to move closer to my parents in Los Angeles and buy a house with acreage.\n\nIt felt right after living in a small apartment in the city for so long — we wanted distance from other people, and the freedom to grow our own food, and live a calmer life.\n\nWe set our sights on a place in the Southern California countryside when we realized how much further our money could go there.\n\nOur new home is only about an hour from major cities, like Los Angeles and San Diego, but it's still the most remote place I've lived.\n\nThe city is also quite small, with a population of about 100,000 people — a stark contrast to the 800,000 in San Francisco and millions in Los Angeles.\n\nI didn't know what to expect when we moved, but I've found myself pleasantly surprised.\n\nLife seems to move slower and there's far less noise and light pollution. At night, our sky lights up with stars. Instead of traffic being spread all over, like in other cities we've lied in, it's mostly just confined to a few busy streets.\n\nOn top of getting much more house and yard than we could afford in a bigger city, we've found a lot of our everyday expenses, like groceries and gas, are about 20% cheaper here.\n\nOur city's small-town feel is refreshing and it's also been easy to build community. Strangers smile at us often, and locals have been welcoming and genuinely friendly. We've even become friends with all of our neighbors.\n\nI still get culture shock when I bump into acquaintances at the farmers market, or when the store clerk talks to us like we're old pals.\n\nThe biggest gossip topics around here are which fancy new apartment buildings might be built and the newest batch of coyotes.\n\nMy daughter also loves her school, which feels like a tight-knit community of families — many of whom also moved away from big cities.\n\nSure there's drawbacks. At times, living in a more remote area can also feel isolating.\n\nWe're far from friends, fun malls, and trendy gyms. Sometimes I miss going to fancy farmers markets and trying a new restaurant every week.\n\nGoing into a nearby bigger city takes planning and effort — especially if you have kids — and at least an hourlong drive.\n\nWe also have more limited shopping and grocery-store options, and scheduling doctor visits can be tricky when everyone goes to the same four clinics.\n\nHowever, what we've lost in big-city perks, we have gained back in nature with easy access to horses, hiking trails, farms, and petting zoos. We may be far from a Whole Foods, but we're close to neighbors who sell homemade bread, organic cheese, jam and goat milk.\n\nOur area is less diverse than the cities we left behind, but I've still found community here among people who share my values and interests.\n\nAnd all that we have here — space, time, fresh air, calm, community — has completely changed how I live and what I now prioritize. This move has felt like a reset to to my nervous system.\n\nI never imagined I would live in the country and love it — city friends are still skeptical when they come visit.\n\nHowever, seeing what's possible when you venture out of your comfort zone has even inspired some of them to move to more remote areas, too.\n\nStill, I'd never change the path that brought me here. San Francisco and Los Angeles are great cities with incredible energy — especially if you're early in your career — but at this stage of my life, the things that make me happy are in this cozy countryside.\n\nThe area feels very well-suited for aging. It's a place where slowing down isn't seen as \"failing\"; and being close to San Diego, with its world-class medical institutions, has made it easy to imagine staying here for the rest of our lives.",

    "description": "As the UK adds folic acid to supermarket bread, a nutritionist examines whether TikTok health fears are backed by evidence.",
    "fullText": "Fortified foods are marketed as being good for us, helping to plug nutritional gaps that can lead to deficiencies and poor health.\n\nHowever, the government’s recent decision to add folic acid to supermarket bread has become the centre of a heated online debate.\n\nFrom December this year, a new law will see food manufacturers add the synthetic nutrient to non-wholemeal flour, meaning that certain varieties of breads, cakes and other supermarket items will all carry additional fortification.\n\nOnce the rule is in place, it will be mandatory for millers in the UK to add 0.25 mg of folic acid per 100 grams of non-wholemeal wheat flour.\n\nBut what actually is folic acid? Why are people concerned, and is there any truth to the concerns swirling on social media?\n\nTo better understand the conversation, we asked a nutritionist to answer some of the most common questions.\n\nFolic acid is the synthetic form of the vitamin folate, also known as B9.\n\nFolate helps the body to manufacture healthy red blood cells and plays a role in how efficiently our cells divide and grow. It’s naturally found in foods like leafy greens, chickpeas and cruciferous vegetables, with the NHS saying that most adults can get all they need from a healthy diet alone.\n\nIn early pregnancy, having good levels of folate becomes particularly important, as it helps to aid the proper development of the baby's brain, skull and spinal cord.\n\nDuring these weeks and months, it can be more challenging for women to obtain enough folate from diet alone, as the body's requirements increase significantly.\n\nThis is why the NHS recommends that all pregnant women take 400 micrograms of folic acid every day – from before they fall pregnant until their 12-week scan.\n\n\"Folic acid is being added to bread in the UK because folate intakes are still too low in women of childbearing age, and that has real, preventable consequences,\" says Rob Hobson, nutritionist and author of Unprocess Your Life.\n\n\"Around nine in 10 neural tube defects, including spina bifida (a condition where the baby’s spine and spinal cord don’t fully develop in the womb), develop very early in pregnancy – often before many women even know that they’re pregnant.\n\n\"Despite years of advice to take supplements, uptake has been patchy in the UK, particularly among younger women and those from lower-income backgrounds.\"\n\nIn England, a study of nearly half a million women showed that only 31% take a folic acid supplement prior to pregnancy.\n\n\"That’s why fortification exists,\" says Hobson. \"It follows years of evidence review, careful modelling of risks and benefits, and advice from independent scientific bodies.\n\n\"Countries that already fortify flour have consistently seen reductions in neural tube defects, without clear evidence of harm to the wider population.\"\n\nOne recent review that looked at data from multiple countries found a clear link between the introduction of folic acid fortification and a reduction in neural tube defects, with Chile in South America seeing incidences drop by 55% over a decade.\n\nMuch of the online controversy focuses on a gene called \"MTHFR\", which plays a role in how your body metabolises folate.\n\nSome people are concerned that, if you have a mutation of this particular gene, you may be naturally less efficient at processing synthetic folic acid, leading to higher levels of the unmetabolised nutrient in the bloodstream.\n\nOnline, panic has spread around this \"build-up\" of folic acid, with claims being made that it could contribute to everything from immune problems and heightened cancer risk to increased depression and fatigue.\n\nHowever, Hobson believes that these concerns have largely been sensationalised, and are not based on robust scientific evidence.\n\n\"It’s true that variants of the MTHFR gene are common and can slightly affect how folate is processed in the body,\" he clarifies. \"However, the idea that people with these variants can’t safely handle folic acid, or that fortification is harmful at a population level, isn’t supported by good-quality evidence.\n\n\"This argument often comes from unregulated sources online, and it tends to overlook the scale of public health benefit.\"\n\nFears around folic acid and cancer appear to stem from early research looking at high-dose supplementation.\n\nSome early studies suggested that very high intakes of folic acid might be linked to a possible increase in certain cancers. However, a 2013 meta-analysis of randomised trials looked into these concerns, and found that folic acid supplementation didn't significantly increase overall or site-specific cancer risk over a five-year follow-up period.\n\nWhen it comes to your weekly loaf of bread, Hobson says it’s sensible to keep the fortification levels being increased in context.\n\n\"The level of folic acid being added to flour is small and tightly regulated,\" he reminds. \"Even with fortified bread, most people will still be consuming folic acid well below the upper safe intake level. This is very different from taking high-dose supplements.\"\n\nHe adds: \"Claims on social media that fortified bread can 'slow down bodily processes' or 'promote cancer' aren’t backed up by robust human evidence at the levels used in fortification.\n\n\"While very high supplement doses may overwhelm certain pathways in theory, there’s no good evidence that the small amounts used in flour fortification impair metabolism or cause harm in the general population.\"\n\nOf course, if you’re really anxious about the new law and you’re meeting your daily folate requirements through diet alone, you can always opt for wholewheat varieties that aren’t affected by the rule, or try making your own wholemeal sourdough at home. Both are healthy and nutritious ways to increase your fibre intake.\n\nHowever, if you love nothing more than tucking into a white bread sarnie, Hobson believes there’s no immediate reason to panic. \"The bottom line is that fortification isn’t about optimising nutrition for people who already eat well and take supplements,\" he notes.\n\n\"It’s about reducing avoidable birth defects across the population. From a public health perspective, the benefits are clear, the risks have been carefully assessed, and the policy is grounded in decades of evidence.\"",

    "description": "\"Future mortality will depend on how health systems, policymakers, and societies address the risks now.\"",
    "fullText": "Scientists warn a new pandemic is taking shape as public trust in data and science wanes, making it challenging to respond effectively to looming threats.\n\nFrontiers, a global leader in science publishing, opened its doors to leaders in Davos, Switzerland, in January to champion solutions that promote healthy lives and a healthy planet.\n\nAt one of its sessions, Vanina Laurent-Ledru, chief public health and government affairs officer of Institut Mérieux and bioMérieux, spoke about the next pandemic, which scientists fear could kill more people than cancer by 2050: antimicrobial resistance, or AMR.\n\nAlarmingly, Ledru said, \"No one is speaking about it.\"\n\nAdèle James, co-founder and chief technology officer of biotech firm Phagos, echoed those sentiments, referring to AMR as \"a silent pandemic.\"\n\nAs Jeff Goldblum's character famously said in Jurassic Park, \"Life finds a way.\" According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, that's essentially what's happening with AMR.\n\n\"To survive, germs can develop defense strategies against antibiotics and antifungals,\" the agency wrote. (Unlike bacteria, viruses are technically considered non-living, but they fall under the AMR umbrella.) These germs can then share their defense mechanisms with germs that haven't encountered antibiotics or antifungals.\n\nThis is a serious problem because modern medicine relies heavily on these treatments for life-saving procedures and to heal what would otherwise be deadly infections. Antibiotics alone are believed to have expanded the average human lifespan by over two decades.\n\n\"Experts at Davos said the threat is clear — but worry that without urgent attention, the world may once again wait too long to act,\" Newsweek reported in its coverage of the Frontiers Science House.\n\nGerms can receive an unintentional helping hand from humans in their fight for survival.\n\nWhat's the most you'd pay per month to put solar panels on your roof if there was no down payment?\n\nI'd only do it if someone else paid for it\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nStudies suggest microplastics and air pollution are playing a role. As the CDC and World Health Organization have documented, the misuse and overuse of antibiotics are accelerating germ evolution. For example, antibiotics are effective against certain bacterial infections.

    "fullText": "LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) — She says she was let down at every step. By a partner who abandoned her when she was pregnant. By a health service that denied her a legal abortion. And by a justice system that sent her to a maximum-security prison for illegally terminating her pregnancy on her own.\n\nViolet Zulu, a house cleaner in Zambia earning $40 a month, was sentenced to seven years in prison in 2024 after representing herself in court with little understanding of the consequences of her actions. She didn't see her two children or other family members for nearly two years.\n\nAfter word of her case reached international rights groups that helped her file an appeal, Zulu was freed last month. Activists say she represents many women in Africa who take desperate decisions when facing barriers to legal abortion services.\n\nHer story has drawn little sympathy in her southern African nation, where parts of society view abortion harshly. Her own mother said she agreed with her daughter's prison sentence, but said it should have been shorter.\n\nZulu spoke with The Associated Press as she pieces her life together again at the age of 26.\n\nShe said she first attempted to access legal abortion services at a public clinic, which should have given her advice or services but turned her away. She then tried a private pharmacy, which requested 800 Zambian kwacha ($43) for abortion drugs, a month's salary for her.\n\nShe was already struggling to feed her two young sons, and she sometimes had to beg food from relatives.\n\nShe said her decision to drink an herbal concoction she prepared herself, one known for terminating pregnancies, was taken out of despair. She couldn't bear for her boys to have even less food if she had another child.\n\n“I never wanted to abort my pregnancy, but it is the circumstances at home that forced me to do it,\" Zulu said in the interview at the two-room rented home with no running water that she shares with her children and parents.\n\n“I was scared (when I took the concoction), but I didn’t really care what would happen to me,\" she added.\n\nIn her court testimony, she explained what happened next: She delivered the fetus in a toilet, placed it in a sack and dropped it in a nearby stream. She said she confided in a friend, but word got out and neighbors reported her to police.\n\nZulu, who left school in the eighth grade, was never offered free legal counsel despite the right to request it. She represented herself in court and pleaded guilty to the offense of procuring her own abortion. She said she didn’t understand the legality of abortion and thought she would receive a warning.\n\n“This is a system that failed Violet,” said Rosemary Kirui, a legal adviser for Africa for the abortion rights group Center for Reproductive Rights, which campaigned for Zulu’s release and helped with her appeal. “It is not that she did not try. It is that she could not afford the services, yet she should be able to access them as a citizen of Zambia.”\n\nZulu should have been eligible for a free abortion under a provision that allows doctors in Zambia to consider risks to the well-being of her existing children, said Sharon Williams, country director for the Women and Law in Southern Africa advocacy group.\n\nBut Zulu was not aware of that, largely because of the secrecy, stigma and shame around abortion, which is not advertised by Zambia's public health system.\n\nZambia's health ministry did not respond to questions about her case.\n\nPart of the problem, Williams said, is that Zambia has legalized abortion while also defining itself in its constitution as a strongly Christian country.\n\nAbortions are still largely restricted in Africa, with few countries allowing them for reasons other than threats to the health of the mother or the fetus. Even in countries like Zambia, religious beliefs, conservative values rooted in local cultures or a lack of information make access to legal procedures difficult, according to health and rights groups.\n\nWilliams said Zulu’s case ought to lead to a national conversation over whether Zambian authorities should better educate communities over the legal right to abortion.\n\n“I think now that we have this judgment, we’re ready for the conversation,\" she said.\n\nActivists say desperate women turn to unsafe abortions. Africa and Latin America have the highest proportions of them, with approximately 75% of all abortions in Africa deemed unsafe, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nThe Guttmacher Institute health rights organization estimated in a 2019 report that over 6 million unsafe abortions a year occurred in sub-Saharan Africa. It noted that Zambia's abortion law “tended to be a ‘paper law’ rather than one that ensures widespread access.”\n\nIn South Africa, which claims to have the most progressive laws on the continent, abortion has been legal for nearly 30 years. It is allowed on request before 13 weeks of pregnancy and for several reasons before 21 weeks.\n\nBut studies estimate only 7% of public health facilities there offer abortion services.\n\nIn 2023, the case of a 14-year-old who was denied an abortion by South African health workers three times for reasons that were not valid prompted a national reality check. After an urgent court case, a judge ordered that the girl be allowed to have an abortion, which was performed on the last day eligible by law.\n\nAt the time, a representative of the social justice group that represented the girl said South Africa's abortion laws were being undermined by \"the abuse of medical knowledge by health care professionals\" in trying to prevent abortions.\n\nIn Zambia, Zulu said she still felt bad about what she did but must now provide for her sons. She was looking for work again, she said.\n\nImray reported from Cape Town, South Africa.\n\nFor more on Africa and development: https://apnews.com/hub/africa-pulse\n\nThe Associated Press receives financial support for global health and development coverage in Africa from the Gates Foundation.

I took about a month to settle my mind, reflect on what I wanted next for my career, and help my daughter finish her college essays.\n\nIt's been a very refreshing change to think about what I want next in my engineering career. I'm less focused on the size or name of the next company I work for, and more on what I'd be doing there. I'm looking forward to hopefully heading the engineering for something that has a great impact on customers.

    "fullText": "The wife of Grammy-winning artist Jelly Roll detailed the harrowing mental-health struggle she experienced after taking weight-loss drugs.\n\n“Honestly, I just went through a bout of suicidal ideation from using a GLP-1,” Bunnie Xo, whose real name is Alisa DeFord, told People magazine.\n\nBunnie, 46, married Jelly Roll (Jason Bradley DeFord) in 2016 and is the stepmother to his two children.\n\nJelly Roll, 41, has been on his own weight loss journey since 2023. He’s since lost 275 pounds without the help of GLP-1s, working with a medical team, a chef, and a sports nutritionist, and seeking professional treatment for his food addiction.\n\nGLP-1 receptor agonists, sold under names such as Ozempic, Wegovy, and Mounjaro, are a class of drugs used to manage diabetes and support weight loss, favored by celebrities like Oprah and Serena Williams.\n\n“[December 2025] was one of the darkest times of my life, and it was scary,” Bunnie, a podcast host and author, said.\n\n“I prided myself on the fact that I only had anxiety. I never had depression,” Bunnie said.\n\nShe details her hard childhood in her new memoir, Stripped Down: Unfiltered and Unapologetic (HarperCollins Publishers), which comes out on February 17.\n\n“So, when you get slammed with suicidal ideation and visions and just, oh, it was horrific,” she continued.\n\n“You want to have anxiety because you want to be scared to die. You don’t want to have depression because you literally don’t care if you want to die. So yeah, it was really dark.”\n\nBunnie started using GLP-1s due to health issues in her family.\n\n“Both my parents had diabetes. So my insulin numbers are really crazy and my body just cannot tolerate it,” she said, adding, “I wish I could be part of the cool crowd and be skinny and freaking not have a care in the world.”\n\nAlthough Bunnie says she feels much better now, she felt compelled to share her story in order to help others. “I really think people need to talk more about this,” she said.\n\n“I just want people to know you’re not alone. Everybody goes through ups and downs and you are worth staying here. Please stay. Everybody, please stay because you’re here for a reason and you’re going through this, but do not make a permanent decision based on a temporary emotion because it will go away.”\n\nIf you or a loved one is struggling with suicidal thoughts, please reach out to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline by dialing or texting 988.",

    "description": "After years of extreme work and little sleep, a founder explains how health data revealed hidden risks and pushed him to rethink success.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Tyler Smith, founder of Hundred Health. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI used to brag about how little sleep I got. It felt like a superpower: I could sleep just three or four hours a night, and still operate at a very high level.\n\nThat helped me get ahead early on. As a teen, I bused tables and sold firewood. By the time I was 19, I bought a house (which was possible because it was the subprime mortgage days). Having a mortgage gave me real responsibility at a young age.\n\nIt also got me thinking about a career. I couldn't believe how much my real estate agent made on the sale. Her commission was about $13,000 — which seemed like $1 million to me at the time — and I thought she didn't do a very good job. I realized that if I did good work in real estate, I could make even more.\n\nI dropped out of college to get into real estate. During the financial crisis, I found a niche helping banks sell foreclosures. In 2006 and 2007, I oversaw about 1,000 home sales a year and managed triple that number of properties.\n\nI was working 14-hour days, seven days a week. It wasn't a good life, but I was young enough that it didn't matter. I fueled myself on energy drinks and embraced the fact that work was my life.\n\nTo help scale, I developed software to track my business's transactions. Other brokerages inquired about what I was using, and soon I had clients paying $2,000 or $5,000 a month to use the software.\n\nI was in the right place at the right time with the right product as real estate transactions went digital. By 2012, that software, SkySlope, was doing $12 million in annual revenue. In 2017, Fidelity bought a majority stake, valuing the company at more than $80 million.\n\nThat deal meant that I had enough money to never work again. I'm wired to build, though, so I planned to use my financial freedom to focus on something with purpose: a mission-driven business.\n\nWhen I was 39, my wife and I were trying to have a child. I took a biological age test, which said my biological age was 47. That stopped me in my tracks, because my own father had died suddenly of a heart attack at 47.\n\nThe test showed me that what I was telling myself wasn't true. I was working out and eating relatively healthy. I looked fit, but the data showed that what was happening inside my body didn't match what was on the outside.\n\nOnce I saw that data, I couldn't ignore it. I spent well over six figures hiring a top-notch healthcare team. My wife and I rented a 2,000 square-foot unit in Sacramento, which we transformed into our own personal wellness center. It had IV infusions, a hyperbaric chamber, a red light bed, cold plunges, massagers — basically anything you can name in the health and fitness world.\n\nWe were building a home in Napa and wanted to know which equipment we would actually use. We spent about $700,000 fitting out the Sacramento space, and eventually over $1 million building the wellness center in our home.\n\nToday, I use the red light bed, oxygen therapy, and cold plunge almost daily. Other therapies — like massagers and bikes — didn't make the final cut. I love the results of the hyperbaric chamber, but don't like lying in it for an hour, so for now, that's out of rotation.\n\nI changed everything about my health and fitness, and because of that, everything in my life changed: my muscle mass and energy levels went through the roof, and my mood improved. I felt better than ever, and friends began to notice.\n\nI know not everyone has the money and access I do. Most people have more data about their health than ever due to smart watches and wearable monitors, but they don't have a team of doctors helping them use that information.\n\nI started Hundred Health not only to provide data, but also to offer a personalized plan for what to do with it. I used to think that wealth was freedom, but now I know that health is — and I would like to help more people access that.",

    "description": "The Trump Environmental Protection Agency delivered a significant blow to longstanding US climate policy on Thursday, finalizing rules to revoke a 2009 scientific finding that human-caused climate change endangers human health and safety.",
    "fullText": "The Trump administration delivered a deadly blow to longstanding US climate policy on Thursday, finalizing rules that revoke the Environmental Protection Agency’s ability to regulate climate pollution.\n\nFirst issued in 2009, the endangerment finding determined that six greenhouse gases could be categorized as dangerous to human health under the Clean Air Act. It has underpinned the EPA’s authority to limit planet-warming pollution from the oil and gas industry, power plants and vehicles since the Obama administration and is considered the federal government’s most powerful tool to tackle climate pollution and the country’s contribution to the global crisis.\n\n“We are officially terminating the so-called endangerment finding,” President Donald Trump said on Thursday, calling the policy “disastrous.”\n\nTrump said repealing the regulations “has nothing to do with public health.”\n\n“This was all a scam, a giant scam,” Trump said on Thursday. “This was a rip off of the country by Obama and Biden.”\n\nIn addition, the Trump administration will finalize a repeal of rules that regulate greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles, since they stem from the finding. Under former President Joe Biden, the EPA sought to tighten those standards to prod the auto industry to make more fuel-efficient hybrids and electric vehicles — an effort the industry has since backtracked on.\n\nThe full text of EPA’s repeal of the endangerment finding wasn’t made available before the Trump administration announced it, but the justification for the repeal laid out in an EPA press release relies far more on legal arguments than an outright rejection of climate science.\n\nThe agency is arguing that the Obama and Biden administrations exceeded their legal authority when they used the Clean Air Act to regulate climate pollution. This is in contrast to last summer, when the agency first proposed the repeal. The EPA proposal was then based in part on a hastily produced report authored by five climate contrarians that questioned the severity of climate impacts like wildfires, extreme heat and stronger storms.\n\nInstead of doubling down on that Thursday, the Trump EPA in a press release concluded the Clean Air Act “does not provide statutory authority for EPA” to put forward vehicle emissions standards “including for the purpose of addressing global climate change, and therefore has no legal basis for the Endangerment Finding and resulting regulations.”\n\nHowever, in the same press release announcing the repeal, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin nodded to the administration’s opposition to climate policy.\n\n“Referred to by some as the ‘Holy Grail’ of the ‘climate change religion,’ the Endangerment Finding is now eliminated,” Zeldin said in the EPA’s press release. While speaking next to Trump on Thursday, however, Zeldin’s remarks were slightly different.\n\n“Today, the Trump EPA has finalized the single largest act of deregulation in the history of the United States of America. Referred to by some as the holy grail of federal regulatory overreach, the 2009 Obama EPA endangerment finding is now eliminated,” Zeldin said on Thursday.\n\nLegal precedent has granted the government regulatory powers over climate pollution. The US Supreme Court ruled in 2007 that EPA had the authority to regulate climate pollution from greenhouse gases. And in 2022, the US Supreme Court upheld the EPA’s authority to regulate greenhouse gases from power plants, but narrowed the agency’s scope significantly, prompting the Biden administration to formulate rules aimed only at making individual power plants more efficient.\n\nThe 2022 Supreme Court ruling “never questioned that EPA had the authority to regulate greenhouse gases,” said Meredith Hankins, legal director for federal climate at the Natural Resources Defense Fund. “That was settled law.”\n\nBut the endangerment finding repeal will thrust that question back into the courts, where litigating the repeal could take years, and potentially go all the way to the nation’s highest court. A former top Biden EPA official told CNN he believes this move shows the Trump administration is playing a legal long game.\n\n“Their definition of winning I believe has been and will be when they take final action and defend their action in the courts, to permanently remove EPA’s Clean Air Act authority to regulate greenhouse gases,” said Joe Goffman, who led EPA’s Office of Air and Radiation under Biden.\n\nIf the Trump administration repeal is “upheld in court, no future EPA will be able to regulate (carbon dioxide) emissions,” said Jeff Holmstead, an energy attorney with the law firm Bracewell, and a former high-ranking EPA official in the George W. Bush administration. Congress could pass a new law that specifically directs the EPA to regulate climate pollution, but there is little bipartisan consensus on addressing the issue.\n\nZeldin laid out the agency’s argument, saying EPA has no authority to regulate certain kinds of pollution unless Congress passes a law giving them express permission.\n\n“If Congress didn’t authorize it, EPA shouldn’t be doing it,” Zeldin said on Thursday. “If Congress wants EPA to regulate the heck out of greenhouse gasses emitted from motor vehicles, then Congress can clearly make that the law.”\n\nClimate, public health and environmental groups are already promising legal challenges to the agency’s move.\n\n“Earthjustice and our partners will see the Trump administration in court,” said Abigail Dillen, president of the environmental legal group. “The courts have repeatedly affirmed EPA’s obligation to clean up climate pollution. There is no way to reconcile EPA’s decision with the law, the science, and the reality of disasters that are hitting us harder every year.”\n\nOn Thursday, a coalition of public health groups including the American Lung Association and the American Public Health Association announced they would sue the administration, calling the regulatory appeal “unlawful.”\n\nAttorneys for the Natural Resources Defense Fund recently emphasized that even with a conservative Supreme Court, the EPA’s authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions has been reaffirmed multiple times. NRDC attorneys suggested that EPA’s legal arguments are relatively novel, which could make the EPA’s move more vulnerable to being overturned in court.\n\n“It’s not something that has been done before,” said Hankins.",

    "fullText": "Exclusive: in 2025 briefing to Wes Streeting, officials warned reputation of tech firm behind US ICE operations would hinder rollout of data system in UK\n\nHealth officials fear Palantir’s reputation will hinder the delivery of a “vital” £330m NHS contract, according to briefings seen by the Guardian, sparking fresh calls for the deal to be scrapped.\n\nIn 2023, ministers selected Palantir, a US surveillance technology company that also works for the Israeli military and Donald Trump’s ICE operation, to build an AI-enabled data platform to connect disparate health information across the NHS.\n\nNow it has emerged that after Keir Starmer demanded faster deployment, Whitehall officials privately warned that the public perception of Palantir would limit its rollout, meaning the contract would not offer value for money.\n\nPalantir was this week called “ghastly” and “a highly questionable organisation” by MPs in the House of Commons.\n\nThe fallout over Peter Mandelson’s relationship to the convicted child sexual abuse offender Jeffrey Epstein has also affected the image of Palantir, which employed the former US ambassador’s lobbying company, Global Counsel.\n\nBefore he was sacked, Mandelson took Starmer to meet Palantir’s chief executive, Alex Karp, at the tech company’s Washington showroom.\n\nMPs last week demanded greater transparency around Palantir’s public sector deals, which also include a £240m contract with the Ministry of Defence and with several police forces.\n\nIn a private briefing for Wes Streeting before a meeting with Palantir’s European boss, Louis Mosley, in June 2025, Department of Health officials wrote: “The public perception of the [Federated Data Platform (FDP)] during the procurement, and then in delivery, has been affected by the profile of Palantir.\n\n“We do not know the extent to which this is impacting on delivery. It is, however, likely to make it harder to go further with the FDP, and to encourage the inclusion of GP data locally.”\n\nThe briefing was released under the Freedom of Information Act to Foxglove, a tech fairness campaign group.\n\nThe officials said the rollout had also been affected by debates about patient privacy and concerns that the NHS was being “locked-in” to a single vendor, but added: “Many of these debates are inaccurate and are often as a result of misconceptions.”\n\nDonald Campbell, director of advocacy at Foxglove, said: “The prime minister and the health secretary should listen to the public they serve when they tell them Palantir has no place in the NHS.\n\n“They should not be scheming with tech billionaires’ staff on how best they can ‘mitigate’ the ‘public perception’ problems these tech giants deservedly face through their own repellent behaviour.”\n\nThe BMA, which represents NHS doctors, said it has “long opposed the involvement of Palantir in the delivery of care and the use of patient data in our NHS, and it is concerning to see from this briefing that the government felt public concern about Palantir should be dismissed as ‘misconceptions’”.\n\nThe briefing document suggested Streeting could ask Palantir how to speed up the rollout, and say that the government was keen to “remove unnecessary obstacles” including by revisiting “regulations relating to confidential patient information”.\n\nStreeting on Monday sought to show he had “nothing to hide” regarding his relationship with Mandelson by publishing their WhatsApp messages between August 2024 and October 2025.\n\nNone mentioned Palantir, although in one exchange just over three weeks after Streeting’s meeting with the company, Mandelson encouraged him to visit the US and said: “Need to plan. Lots of tech companies and people to talk to.”\n\nNew figures released on Thursday showed that the number of NHS organisations using the Palantir technology has increased since June from 118 to 151, which is still well short of the target of 240 by the end of this year.\n\nPalantir was co-founded by the Trump supporter and billionaire Peter Thiel, who has previously said “the NHS makes people sick”, and described the British public’s affection for the NHS as a case of “Stockholm syndrome” – the term for hostages who feel a bond with their captors.\n\nThe former Conservative government minister David Davis said the government now faced a “huge value-for-money issue” over the Palantir contract.\n\nHe said there had been “naivety in the senior management of the NHS” in awarding a contract to a company with “spectacular baggage in terms of its genesis in the American security state”.\n\n“The government is going to have a problem with many hospital trusts and they are going to have really difficult problems with the GPs,” he said. “My best estimate is they will never get most of the GPs with an organisation like Palantir.”\n\nJohn Puntis, co-chair of the Keep Our NHS Public campaign, said: “This looks like another example of a hugely wasteful IT contract, and lack of public trust will make it unworkable.\n\n“They ought to end the contract or not renew it. They should accept that the public is very concerned and it is going to make the use of public data very difficult if people think it’s going to be accessed by a company like Palantir.”\n\nA spokesperson for Palantir said: “Palantir software is helping to deliver better public services in the UK. That includes delivering 99,000 more NHS operations and reducing hospital discharge delays by 15%, as well as helping the Royal Navy keep ships at sea for longer and the police to tackle domestic violence.”\n\nA Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “The Federated Data Platform is already delivering for the NHS – helping to join-up patient care, increase hospital productivity, speed up cancer diagnosis and ensure thousands of additional patients can be treated each month.\n\n“All providers go through a rigorous, competitive procurement process in line with Government legislation. All data operates under the instruction of the NHS, with strict stipulations in the contract about confidentiality.”\n\nNHS England declined to comment.",

    "fullText": "The president appeared to experience a system malfunction during a self-indulgent speech at the White House on Wednesday.\n\nDonald Trump, 79, drew attention to his declining health with a confounding word salad at an event celebrating him as the “Undisputed Champion of Coal.”\n\n“I’m proud to officially name the undispuut...” Trump said, before muttering unintelligible gibberish for about two seconds.\n\n“When did this come out? Mr. Speaker,” he said, before appearing to remember his lines and getting back on track. “The undisputed champion of beautiful, clean coal.”\n\n“We have to proceed, always—don’t use the word coal, you know, it needs a PR job,\" he added.\n\nThe strange slip-up generated buzz almost immediately on social media, with internet users, including Trump’s former opponent Kamala Harris, commenting on the president’s supposedly diminishing mental faculties.\n\n“Trump, slurring: I’m proud to officially name the...undishpu...the...jshhhh...whendidthiscomeout,” wrote the Headquarters account, which is operated by Harris’ team.\n\nTrump’s trolling rival, California Gov. Gavin Newsom, couldn’t miss an opportunity to slam the president, with his press office posting the footage on X. “The sundowning starts earlier every day,” the caption read.\n\nWhen contacted by the Daily Beast for comment, White House Spokesman Davis Ingle said, “President Trump is the sharpest, most accessible, and energetic president in American history. While the deranged and failing Daily Beast has their lightweight, glue-sniffing interns push baseless conspiracy theories — President Trump spent the day unleashing energy dominance, lowering costs, and putting the American people first.”\n\nAlso, during the appearance, as the president was speaking about the benefits of coal-based energy, he took a tangent to one of his favorite topics: windmills.\n\n“I’m not a big fan of those crazy windmills,” Trump said, mimicking a windmill’s circular motion with his finger. “They’re made in China but not used by China. Let’s look for a couple of wind farms in China. See if you can find one.”\n\nChina is the undisputed leader in wind and solar power, according to The Guardian, with nearly twice as much renewable energy under construction as the rest of the world combined.\n\nHe called the inanimate objects “losers” before saying, “You’re supposed to make money with energy, not lose money with energy.”\n\nAside from his speech slip-ups, the president’s right hand also appeared discolored again, as the Daily Beast has reported extensively.\n\nTrump’s health has been in decline for months, from cankle appearances to awkward descents down the stairs of Air Force One; the president is now repeatedly finding himself having to defend his multiple gaffes.\n\nFollowing his speech, the president was presented with a trophy of a golden miner by the Washington Coal Club, which designated him as the “Undisputed Champion of Coal.”",

    "fullText": "From oral care and nutritional supplements to running shoes, workout apparel, and electric bikes, Insider Reviews tests and reviews all manner of health, fitness, and outdoors products. For close to five years, the team has tested hundreds of products, including items like electric toothbrushes, sex toys, thermometers, glucometers, fitness trackers, massage guns, and teeth whiteners. Our goal is to deliver honest and truthful recommendations for what people use every day to manage their health, wellness, and fitness.\n\nIn addition to research and testing, the Health, Fitness, and Outdoors team's coverage is backed by insight, advice, and counsel from doctors, dietitians, and other health experts to ensure a high level of trustworthiness and authority. Our writers are subject-matter experts as well. Insider's medical review board, which comprises medical professionals from a variety of fields, also fact-checks our coverage.\n\nNutrition supplements: Our recommendations are based on extensive research and expert consultations. We look at the benefits and drawbacks of supplements like multivitamins, protein powders, workout supplements, and more. Many of these guides include insight from dietitians and nutritionists and are rigorously fact-checked by health experts.\n\nOral health: We review a variety of oral health products including electric toothbrushes, whitening toothpaste, floss and floss alternatives, and mouthwash. These articles are thoroughly fact-checked and reviewed by dentists and dental hygienists.\n\nSex health: Our sex health coverage is inclusive, diverse, and mindful, and includes testing and research of things like sex toys, condoms, and lube. We also work with sex health experts who serve as advisers as well as writers. These articles are thoroughly fact-checked by our medical review board.\n\nHome health products: Home health includes everything from using thermometers and pulse oximeters to getting prescriptions delivered, utilizing telehealth services to see a doctor or therapist, and managing other health conditions like diabetes or high blood pressure. This coverage is deeply researched and tested (where possible) and includes expert insight from doctors, therapists, pharmacists, and others, as well as routine, in-depth fact-checking.\n\nWorkout equipment: From sets of dumbbells and jump ropes to pull-up bars, kettlebells, and resistance bands, our team tests a variety of home gym equipment for every type of user, no matter their skill level or fitness.\n\nWorkout apparel: Whether it's a workout shirt, pair of shorts, or running shoes, we rigorously test fitness apparel. This includes sweat-testing tops during the humid days of summer, muddying up a pair of trail running shoes, and working with freelancers of all body types and sizes in order to be as inclusive as possible.\n\nFitness trackers: Our team puts fitness trackers from brands like Garmin, Fitbit, Suunto, Polar, and so many others through a series of extensive on-wrist tests to determine how useful they are for tracking activity throughout the day. That includes using them to track runs, workouts, bike rides, and even outdoor activities like hiking, snowboarding, and skiing.\n\nBikes and bike accessories: As avid cyclists ourselves, we cover popular types of bikes, including commuter bikes, electric bikes, and mountain bikes, to related gear like helmets, pumps, and bike locks.\n\nYoga equipment: From yoga mats and yoga blocks to streaming apps, our team actually practices yoga with everything we test in order to judge things like long-term durability, how well it holds up to sweat and various weights and body sizes, comfort, and portability.\n\nAt-home workout machines: This includes treadmills, rowing machines, exercise bikes, and full at-home smart gyms from big names like Peloton and NordicTrack but also up-and-coming brands. We test for everything — from how much space the unit takes up to how effective (and enjoyable) the workout is — and, ultimately, if it's worth investing your money on.\n\nHiking gear: Whether it's for a day hike or a longer backpacking trip, our experienced outdoors writers cover a variety of hiking products. This means stress-testing hiking boots to see how comfortable they are over miles of trekking, carrying backpacks of all sizes, and wearing hiking pants for days. We even make sure to let our adventure dogs spend some time testing hiking gear, too.\n\nCamping equipment: Everyone has a different idea of what the essential camp kit looks like, so we've taken to the task of testing it all. We have recommendations from tents and sleeping bags to camp kitchen setups, coffee makers, sleeping pads, and headlamps.\n\nApparel and gear: Outdoors is an inherently seasonal category, as most people opt to hike and camp in the summer then throw on skis, snowboards, and snowshoes in the winter. That seasonality dictates how and what we test, but we work to stay ahead of the curve by offering proper seasonal recommendations before you actually need them, so you're well prepared.\n\nOur team spends anywhere from a few weeks to several months testing a product across a variety of use cases. We develop unique testing methodologies for each section of products and create benchmarks by which we're able to effectively judge what we test.\n\nThis means seeing through the entire lifespan of a running shoe, sweat-testing (and laundry testing) workout apparel for weeks on end, riding an electric bike until its battery runs out, using telehealth services as our go-to means of visiting a doctor, following the latest advice from the CDC, doctors, research institutions, and other health experts, or setting out into the backcountry for a few days with nothing but a backpack full of gear in tow.\n\nWe take a product's price, durability, ease of use, and other factors into consideration to offer quality options across a variety of budgets.\n\nOur health, fitness, and outdoors team has many years of combined experience testing, reviewing, and researching products, and are true experts across their beats.

It's an opportunity for \"walking and talking and connecting in a way that's just different than happy hour.\"\n\nIt's one sign of how coworker bonding is changing as folks are drinking less, in-person schedules are more variable with the rise of hybrid work, and work friendships are flailing.\n\nThe downfall of after-work drinks doesn't mean socializing is dead. Instead, some workers are getting creative: Think rage rooms, pickleball, saunas, and intense workouts. In a more wellness-minded America — and one where folks might want to optimize their post-work time — there's a focus on ways to boost endorphins other than the best beer deal. This shift might also mean forging deeper relationships along the way.\n\nKayla Merchant, a 39-year-old compliance manager who works remotely in Tulsa, Oklahoma, has experienced both in-person and online alternatives to happy hour. Her old law firm wanted to add perks for staff — as well as potentially bring down insurance premiums — and brought in a trainer to lead in-person workout classes for employees.\n\n\"A lot of us, we weren't super close before the workout class,\" Merchant said. The exercise enthusiasts were spread across departments and floors. She said she's still friends with some of the people she worked out with 15 years later.\n\nMerchant's experience isn't an anomaly. Business Insider reported in October that fitness studios like Barry's and F45 have seen a surge in corporate bookings. Barry's saw a 55% surge in its corporate events and bookings business compared to the year prior. F45 similarly shared that it went from booking an average of one corporate fitness event a month at an offsite or conference, to as many as four.\n\nOf course, the happy hour will likely never be fully vanquished. Getting together for a drink after a long day still very much has its appeal. Manhattan's infamous Stone Street is still drawing crowds, and workers in many major US cities spent more on happy hours in 2024 than they did in 2019. Some of that might be from fusing post-work drinking with more novel activities, like pickleball or blowing off steam in a rage room.\n\nCandice Pokk, a senior consultant for organizational effectiveness at benefits and HR consultancy Segal, said that she's seen increased interest in in-person events. \"Younger employees are craving experiences and not just freebies,\" she said, adding that she's seen organizations moving away from merely offering wellness perks like gym memberships or meditation app subscriptions, and instead investing in unique shared experiences for employees.\n\nCityPickle, which will soon operate a total of 25 pickleball courts across New York City, said the majority of its over 2,000 bookings this year have been corporate. Corporate off-sites, team bonding, and client events have become a major revenue driver, the company said — and that demand helped fuel the opening of its new flagship location in Times Square in February.\n\nThe 37,000-square-foot space, which will also serve as CityPickle's headquarters and its first year-round location, was a strategic choice given proximity to Midtown offices and transit access to major subway lines, said Mary Cannon, the cofounder of CityPickle. The venue includes seven courts, a bar and restaurant, event spaces, and coworking phone booths.\n\nCannon said happy hour isn't dead, but it has \"evolved,\" with companies increasingly choosing venues that offer more than just a bar.\n\nCityPickle isn't the only venue reimagining happy hour. At Break Bar NYC — which features an extensive nonalcoholic menu — coworkers end their drinks by hurling their glasses against a wall, sometimes with a photo attached. The space also has a projector that lets guests display images in the throwing arena.\n\nBreak Bar NYC, which evolved from a former rage room into a more traditional bar setting to reduce liability from injuries, draws individuals, after-work groups, small teams, and corporate buyouts, owner Tom Daly said.\n\nThe smashing is typically lighthearted, he said, with some managers opting to bring in photos of themselves or images of the software they use to attach to the glasses their employees shatter.\n\nSmashing objects with a hammer, sweating in a sauna next to your boss, or cheering on your coworkers as they hit the 2-minute mark in the cold plunge can unlock a different kind of team bonding.\n\nMyles Farmer, the cofounder of the cold plunge and sauna studio Othership, told Business Insider that as people shift away from solely alcohol-centered socializing, workers are seeking ways to connect more \"authentically.\"\n\nOthership operates in major cities like New York and Toronto and tends to attract workers aged 25 to 45 in fields including finance, law, and medicine, Farmer said. Many are \"really stressed\" or \"wound up,\" Farmer said, and the company has seen \"huge demand\" for corporate outings. He said workers are looking for a mental and physical reset without taking up too much of the workday.\n\n\"It provides community and connection, and then they're back out in the city and back to work,\" Farmer said.\n\nHe added that Othership, which has plans to open its largest New York location on the Upper East Side next year, has even become a place for workers to host meetings.\n\n\"People are looking at these as alternatives to getting to know someone,\" Farmer said.\n\nHappy hour alternatives can foster real, lasting connections — and in some cases, even romance. When Julia Bonacini, a 30-year-old LA-based commercial real estate finance professional, first started at her company, she befriended a coworker and learned they both loved Corepower. They started to go together, and another coworker soon joined in. When someone new arrived at the firm, he asked Bonacini to go hiking, and then to a yoga class. He then asked her out, though she initially declined.\n\nWhen he revealed to her that he had been interviewing elsewhere and was likely to put in his notice, she realized how much she'd miss him. They've now been together for two years.",

    "fullText": "Warning: This article contains discussion around suicide and depression.\n\nFormer Great Britain rugby league player Josh Jones has revealed he came close to taking his own life as a result of what he says are the effects of head injuries sustained while playing the sport.\n\nHaving retired in 2023 because of concussion-related issues, he was then diagnosed with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) aged 31.\n\nThe degenerative brain disease is linked to repeated blows to the head and causes an increased risk of mental illness.\n\nJones - who made 246 Super League appearances for a number of clubs - is among the youngest and highest-profile claimants in a concussion lawsuit against rugby league authorities.\n\nIn his first interview since quitting the game, the former international second row told BBC Sport he considered suicide during his playing career.\n\n\"It breaks my heart to share this, but the day before the start of a season, I was contemplating ending my life, and that is how dark it got,\" he said.\n\n\"I sat there for hours contemplating [it] because I didn't like the person I was becoming. I felt a burden to my family.\n\n\"It was awful, and the scariest thing was, that evening [my wife] Olivia managed to calm me down and bring me home… and I played the following day.\"\n\nJones says he developed various symptoms after being regularly concussed during training and matches.\n\nSpeaking to BBC Sport from Malaysia, where he and his family now live, he said: \"I noticed that if I was doing simple tasks, like making my children a bottle of water, trying to pour it and trying to steady my hand, putting a card in the card machine, putting the keys in the door, I just couldn't stop my shaking,\" he said.\n\n\"And that's when things progressively started to get worse; headaches, brain fog, neck pain, eye pain… I'm sensitive to light and to noise, anxiety, depression.\n\n\"The scariest thing I find is being unable to regulate my emotions. That terrifies me. I cope with it by just taking myself away. It's been at the detriment sometimes of our marriage and me being a father and as a friend. I very much isolate myself.\n\n\"I would never let my children play, and that's a really sad thing.\"\n\nJones' wife Olivia told BBC Sport that the changes in her husband's personality were \"very gradual at first\" but became \"impossible to ignore\".\n\n\"He went from being confident, energetic, and present to being withdrawn, irritable, forgetful - and he just seemed to be constantly in pain,\" she said.\n\n\"And he often complained about suffering with headaches, brain fog, and anxiety, and it became quite scary for me.\"\n\nJones - who won three caps for Great Britain in 2019 - says he was diagnosed with probable stage 2 CTE in July 2024, after he had finished playing.\n\nThe degenerative brain disease can only be diagnosed definitively after death, and has been linked to dementia.\n\n\"Being told that someone could actually see me and support me and was listening to me, it was just relief, because for so long I'd just been told there's nothing,\" he added.\n\n\"What the governing body was providing for us as players wasn't, in my opinion, good enough, because there's so many players told there's nothing wrong with them.\n\n\"I think there needs to be an independent regulatory body for brain health, not just in rugby league, but throughout sport.\n\n\"My neurologist has said I'm at high risk now of further problems. It scares the life out of me what I put my body through and what's to come.\n\n\"It's heartbreaking, but the hardest thing for me is my children. When I was able to play on a trampoline with them, play football with them in the garden, I loved being a dad.\n\n\"And I almost feel like that, to the full extent, has been taken away from me, because right now I can't do those things, and I've got to explain to my children why.\"\n\nJones and other claimants in the concussion lawsuit argue that the Rugby Football League (RFL) was negligent in failing to take reasonable action to protect them from serious brain injuries.\n\nThey also claim that the organisation should have established and implemented rules on the assessment, diagnosis and treatment of actual or suspected concussive injuries. The governing body denies liability.\n\nWhen asked why he decided to join the legal action, Jones said: \"I've seen a lot of fans questioning the integrity of players, and saying that they knew the risks.\n\n\"I knew I'd have sore shoulders, a bad back, sore knees, maybe arthritis, those sort of physical things. I never knew that I would be left like this - and be living with this neurological damage that the game's given me.\n\n\"For me, it's not the game, it's the governance of the game that's the problem. And to add insult to injury, to be abandoned from the sport - it's not right. The governing body has failed to protect its players, and something needs to be done.\n\n\"I know it's not just me that's suffering. When I retired, I had lots of former team-mates reach out to me and ask me, 'what care have you got, because I'm suffering with the same symptoms as you'.\"\n\nJones says he believes that \"a lack of protocols\" made his symptoms progress.\n\nAfter retirement, Jones tried to forge a career in the financial sector, and then in his father-in-law's demolition business, but said he \"couldn't deal with the high-stress environment or the hours\" and had to \"isolate myself in dark rooms for hours\".\n\n\"It was just another nightmare,\" he said. \"So, right now, I don't do anything. I'm not employed. In a sense, I can't do anything because I can't work a nine-to-five.\n\n\"I need daily treatment. So we had to sell our home to be able to afford to come to the Far East to get cheaper treatment. We're looking to head to New Zealand.\n\n\"I'm speaking to neurologists over there who have got a different approach, who are recommended by other players who are going through this.\n\n\"Being proactive in trying to slow that transition down, because early-onset dementia, that's a very realistic possibility for me. So is Parkinson's, epilepsy.\n\n\"We're just trying to find some help. It has been the hardest time of our lives.\"\n\nOlivia added that watching her husband struggle after he had retired was \"a harsh reality to me as it was 'oh gosh, this is your life now. This isn't just the impact of playing week in, week out. You have now got brain damage'\".\n\n\"We got to a point in England where there was just no quality of life,\" she added.\n\n\"He didn't leave the house, he completely isolated himself. And obviously, I was scared to leave him on his own. I didn't know what to do and how to help him.\"\n\nIn a statement, the RFL said that it \"takes player safety and welfare extremely seriously and it is always extremely sad to hear of any health difficulties experienced by former players\".\n\n\"Rugby League as a sport invests significantly into scientific research, and continues to evolve its approach to help best prevent and manage concussion injuries.\n\n\"As such the sport has never been safer in this regard. The RFL has developed a clear action plan including a target to reduce concussions across the sport by 30% and is on track to meet these targets.\n\n\"Significant help and assistance is given to former professional players through charity provider Rugby League Cares, [which] supports a comprehensive transition programme supporting players during and post their career, including education and hardship grants.\n\n\"A Brain Health Fund has been established offering access to specialist counselling and care - which has provided support to more than 40 former players and their families.\"\n\nSolicitor Richard Boardman of Rylands Garth, the firm representing the claimants, said: \"Josh's problems still stick out, because he should be in the prime of his life.\n\n\"Josh has been so brave to discuss this publicly and our hearts go out to those who are suffering in silence.\"\n\nIn December, after five years of legal arguments, claimants in the litigation across both rugby league and union were refused permission to appeal against a decision ordering them to provide all of their medical records to the defendants.\n\nIf you have been affected by the issues raised in this article, help and support is available via BBC Action Line.",

    "fullText": "A guide to the highest-leverage longevity habits (20% effort for 80% impact) compiled from evidence-based clinicians and coaches. Curated from Andrew Huberman, David Sinclair, Layne Norton, Andy Galpin, Rhonda Patrick, Bryan Johnson, and others.\n\nDisclaimer: This guide is for informational purposes only and is not medical advice. Consult a qualified healthcare provider before making changes to your diet, exercise, or supplement routine — especially if you have existing health conditions or take medication.\n\nBase your diet on whole or minimally processed foods (meat/fish/eggs or plant proteins, vegetables, fruit, legumes, whole grains, nuts, olive oil) and dramatically reduce ultra-processed foods. [1] [2] [3]\n\nPrioritize protein + fiber so you stay full and support muscle: each meal should include a clear protein source and high-fiber plants (vegetables/beans/fruit/whole grains). [1] [2] [3]\n\nLimit the “big 3” that make diets go off the rails: liquid calories, added sugars, and highly processed snacks/meals, because they make overeating easy. [1] [2] [3]\n\nProtein intake supports muscle growth and maintenance, aids weight management by promoting satiety, strengthens bones and immunity, regulates hormones and blood sugar, and enhances overall recovery and metabolic health. [1] [2]\n\nAim for 1.2 to 1.6 g protein per kg bodyweight per day (Example: 70 kg -> 85 to 110 g/day). [1] [2]\n\nIf you lift weights, diet (cut), or want muscle go higher: 1.6 to 2.2 g/kg/day. [1] [2] [3]\n\nTip: Spread your protein intake across multiple meals throughout the day for better absorption.\n\nFiber intake, a non-digestible carbohydrate from plant foods available as soluble and insoluble types, promotes digestive regularity, lowers cholesterol and blood sugar levels, supports weight control through satiety, boosts gut microbiome health, strengthens heart protection, and reduces risks of diabetes, cancer, and inflammation. [1]\n\nAim for 25 to 35 g/day as a simple baseline. [1] [2] [3]\n\nIf you want a more “optimized” target, build toward 30 to 60 g/day (increase slowly). [1]\n\nThe easiest way to hit it: make 2 meals/day include a clear fiber source (vegetables + beans/lentils + fruit and/or whole grains). [1]\n\nTip: increase fiber gradually over 1 to 2 weeks to avoid bloating and drink more water.\n\nSugar intake, particularly added sugars and refined forms like fructose in processed foods and drinks, is associated with obesity, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, heart disease through inflammation and high triglycerides, fatty liver disease, cognitive decline and depression, dental decay, gout, and increased cancer risks. [1]\n\nDefault: minimize added sugar (especially sugary drinks + corn syrup); get sweetness mainly from whole fruit. [1] [2]\n\nA simple “OK” cap: keep added sugar within conservative public-health limits, e.g. ≤25 g/day (women) or ≤36 g/day (men), and ideally ≤10% of calories. [1]\n\nLongevity-leaning approach: many people in this camp try to avoid refined/added sugars most of the time. [1] [2] [3]\n\nCoffee consumption, primarily through its caffeine and antioxidant content in moderate amounts (3-4 cups daily), enhances cognitive alertness and performance, is associated with lower risk of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and certain cancers like liver and prostate, supports liver and kidney health, lowers all-cause mortality, and provides anti-inflammatory metabolic benefits. [1] [2]\n\nProper hydration regulates temperature, supports cognitive function and mood, aids digestion and waste removal, enhances physical performance and joint lubrication, prevents headaches and fatigue, and promotes heart health and kidney function. [1]\n\nUse a simple baseline: drink to thirst, and make urine pale yellow most of the day (not crystal clear all day, not dark). Usually it is 30 to 35 mL per kg/day. [1] [2]\n\nDistribute this throughout the day — don't chug it all at once. Stop earlier to avoid waking at night.\n\nAlcohol consumption, even in moderation but especially when excessive, damages the liver leading to cirrhosis and cancer, weakens the heart causing high blood pressure, arrhythmias, and cardiomyopathy, impairs brain function resulting in cognitive decline, memory loss, and addiction, increases risks of multiple cancers (mouth, throat, breast, liver), disrupts immunity and sleep, promotes mental health issues like depression and anxiety, and accelerates overall mortality. [1] [2]\n\nBest-for-health default: the less the better, with zero being the safest baseline for brain and long-term health. [1] [2]\n\nIf you choose to drink anyway: no more than 2 drinks per week. [1] [2]\n\nFish oil, rich in omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA, provides key health benefits including improved heart function, better brain and mental health, eye and skin support, and reduced joint inflammation. [1] [2]\n\nDefault: get omega-3s from fatty fish ~2x/week, or supplement if you do not eat fish. [1]\n\nIf supplementing: use a product where the label shows EPA + DHA, and aim around ~1 to 3 g/day EPA+DHA (many people land near ~2 g/day). [1] [2] [3] [4]\n\nSafety note: if you have AFib history, bleeding risk, or take blood thinners, be cautious with higher doses. [1]\n\nCreatine supports rapid energy production in muscles, which can improve strength, power, high-intensity exercise performance, and muscle mass, while also enhancing brain function like memory and cognition. [1] [2]\n\nTake creatine monohydrate 5 g/day, consistently (timing is not important). [1] [2] [3]\n\nFor brain support under stress consider 10 g/day (split 5 g + 5 g) for ~6 to 8 weeks; this is often discussed for cognitive benefits, especially when sleep-deprived or “stressed brain” contexts. [1] [2]\n\nSome research discussed uses ~20 to 30 g once (for example 0.35 g/kg once) to blunt sleep-deprivation hits to cognition. [1]\n\nZone 2 cardio, a moderate-intensity aerobic exercise (roughly 60-70% of max heart rate), enhances fat burning, mitochondrial efficiency, endurance, cardiovascular health, and recovery while reducing chronic disease risk. [1] [2]\n\nUse an easy intensity check: Zone 2 should feel like you can talk in sentences but not sing (steady, sustainable). [1] [2]\n\nAim for 150 to 200 minutes/week of Zone 2 (for example 3 to 4 sessions of 45 to 60 min). [1] [2]\n\nStrength training, involving resistance exercises like weights or bodyweight movements, builds muscle strength, boosts metabolism, enhances bone density, reduces injury risk, and improves overall longevity and mental well-being. [1]\n\nDo strength training 2 to 3 days/week as a strong baseline for healthspan (and to maintain/build muscle as you age). [1] [2]\n\nProgression rule of thumb (Galpin): increase gradually, roughly ~3%/week intensity and ~5%/week volume (do not crank volume up endlessly; keep weekly jumps modest). [1]\n\nDeload cadence: build for about ~6 weeks, then take a deload week before building again (50% fewer sets and/or using 10% to 20% lighter weights). [1] [2]\n\nSleep is a vital restorative process that enhances cognitive function, boosts immune defenses, supports heart health and metabolism, aids muscle recovery, and improves mood and emotional regulation. [1] [2]\n\nKeep a consistent sleep and wake time (within ~30 to 60 minutes every day) and aim for ~7 to 9 hours (Sinclair often mentions 7 to 8). [1] [2] [3] [4]\n\nGet morning outdoor light during first hour after waking (roughly 10 to 30 minutes, more if cloudy) to anchor your body clock and improve nighttime sleep. [1] [2]\n\nCut caffeine at least 8 to 10 hours before bed. [1]\n\nMake the bedroom cool and dark (cool room helps deeper sleep). [1] [2]\n\nReduce bright light/screens in the last 1 to 2 hours before bed (dim lights, warm lighting). [1] [2]\n\nOptional supplements (only if needed): low-dose melatonin and/or magnesium, glycine, L-theanine are commonly discussed as “try if you struggle” tools. [1] [2]\n\nSauna bathing, involving exposure to dry heat, mimics moderate exercise through heat stress, is associated with cardiovascular improvements, reduced inflammation, enhanced recovery, better mental health, and longevity benefits. [1] [2]\n\nSimple “works for most” protocol: 80 to 100°C (176 to 212°F) for 5 to 20 min, 2 to 3x/week (more frequent can be better if you tolerate it). [1]\n\nIf you want the “max benefit” version many people reference: 4 to 7x/week is the high-frequency range most associated with big health correlations in Finnish sauna studies (observational). [1] [2]\n\nTraining/recovery timing note: heat after training can be used for recovery, but it’s not magic; apply it as a tool, not a replacement for sleep/nutrition (and be mindful of dehydration).

The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhen I was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis in 2022, I thought: Why me?\n\nI didn't have lots of bad habits, I hadn't abused my body, and it took me a long time to accept what was happening to me.\n\nI considered giving up my dream of solving meaningful problems in tech at scale, taking a career break to focus on my health, and leaving the US to go back to my home country of India.\n\nUltimately, I stayed in the US and continued with my career while making huge changes to my lifestyle and work routine. I'm proud of what I've achieved in tech in spite of my adversities, and along the way, I've found my voice and a new vision of success.\n\nWhen I first got sick in 2021, I was working in Washington as a software engineer at Microsoft. Previously, I'd spent two years in software engineering at McKinsey, and a few months interning at PayPal. I now work at a large enterprise software company.\n\nI was on a trip with my partner just before Thanksgiving when I had rectal bleeding and felt weak, but I didn't think it was anything more serious than hemorrhoids or food poisoning. My symptoms kept getting worse, even after I consulted doctors and took medication. I was going to the restroom 15 to 20 times a day, and I lost a lot of weight.\n\nDoctors noticed my gut was inflamed, and referred me to a gastroenterologist. I was very scared.\n\nA colonoscopy showed I have ulcerative colitis, a type of inflammatory bowel disease that causes symptoms like abdominal pain and rectal bleeding.\n\nI'm used to putting 100% into my work, and when I was diagnosed in 2022, I'd been working on projects at Microsoft I felt were impactful. I took three to four weeks of sick leave, then returned to work, but I was completely remote for a year after my diagnosis.\n\nMy body struggles to absorb nutrients, and I get tired very quickly. I've had to make many dietary changes to manage flare-ups, including cutting out caffeine, alcohol, lactose, chile, and red meat.\n\nWhen my wife and I went on honeymoon in Hawaii in August 2025, we planned the trip down to the restaurants I could eat at and what I'd order. But then I ate something I hadn't planned at a lūʻau, and I was sick for two days, which was disheartening.\n\nAt first, I was scared to tell people about my condition, but when I started sharing with my colleagues, I found people empathized and judged me according to my merits.\n\nI have bad days related to my condition 20% of the time, and sometimes have to step away for appointments and procedures. For example, I have a colonoscopy every year because ulcerative colitis puts me at higher risk of getting colorectal cancer. I always try to catch up with tasks in my own time, and accept that I have to achieve the same things as others in less time.\n\nI left Microsoft and started working at a large enterprise software company in 2023. I live in the San Francisco Bay Area, where the allure of startups is all around. However, I'm not physically or mentally ready to take the leap of faith to work at one yet. The stability of my current job is vital for my health.\n\nI also need to be careful with what jobs I consider, because a workplace might not be a good fit if it has a strict policy of being in the office five days a week and doesn't make accommodations. Plus, I'm very happy where I am.\n\nBefore I got sick, I took my health for granted, but I've started treating my body like a temple and am careful with how I'm spending my energy. I've come to define success as being healthy, because it helps me solve problems at work better.\n\nIt's also given me a voice. My diagnosis made me want to be more purposeful with my time, so I started exploring creative passions, like writing a newsletter and technical blogs. I want to connect with like-minded people and not live in a shell.\n\nWhen I look back at what I've achieved in my career since my diagnosis, I feel God has been kind to me. I've done interesting, cutting-edge work in tech, like building important infrastructure.\n\nBut I'm not done yet. I'm still in the early innings of my career, and I have a long way to go.\n\nMicrosoft declined to respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nDo you have a story to share about navigating a diagnosis alongside your career?

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A leading U.S. health official on Sunday urged people to get inoculated against the measles at a time of outbreaks across several states and as the United States is at risk of losing its measles elimination status.\n\n“Take the vaccine, please,” said Dr. Mehmet Oz, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services administrator whose boss has raised suspicion about the safety and importance of vaccines. “We have a solution for our problem.”\n\nOz, a heart surgeon, defended some recently revised federal vaccine recommendations as well as past comments from President Donald Trump and the nation's health chief, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., about the efficacy of vaccines. From Oz, there was a clear message on the measles.\n\n“Not all illnesses are equally dangerous and not all people are equally susceptible to those illnesses,” he told CNN’s “State of the Union.” “But measles is one you should get your vaccine.”\n\nAn outbreak in South Carolina in the hundreds has surpassed the recorded case count in Texas’ 2025 outbreak, and there is also one on the Utah-Arizona border. Multiple other states have had confirmed cases this year. The outbreaks have mostly impacted children and have come as infectious disease experts warn that rising public distrust of vaccines generally may be contributing to the spread of a disease once declared eradicated by public health officials.\n\nAsked in the television interview whether people should fear the measles, Oz replied, “Oh, for sure.” He said Medicare and Medicaid will continue to cover the measles vaccine as part of the insurance programs.\n\n“There will never be a barrier to Americans get access to the measles vaccine. And it is part of the core schedule,” Oz said.\n\nBut Oz also said “we have advocated for measles vaccines all along” and that Kennedy “has been on the very front of this.”\n\nQuestions about vaccines did not come up later in a Kennedy interview on Fox News Channel's “The Sunday Briefing,” where he was asked about what kind of Super Bowl snack he might have (probably yogurt). He also he eats steak with sauerkraut in the mornings.\n\nCritics of Kennedy have argued that the health secretary's longtime skepticism of U.S. vaccine recommendations and past sympathy for the unfounded claim that vaccines may cause autism may influence official public health guidance in ways contrary to the medical consensus.\n\nOz argued that Kennedy's stance was supportive of the measles vaccine despite Kennedy's general comments about the recommended vaccine schedule.\n\n“When the first outbreak happened in Texas, he said, get your vaccines for measles, because that’s an example of an ailment that you should get vaccinated against,” Oz said.\n\nThe Republican administration last month dropped some vaccine recommendations for children, an overhaul of the traditional vaccine schedule that the Department of Health and Human Services said was in response to a request from Trump.\n\nTrump asked the agency to review how peer nations approach vaccine recommendations and consider revising U.S. guidance accordingly.\n\nStates, not the federal government, have the authority to require vaccinations for schoolchildren. While federal requirements often influence those state regulations, some states have begun creating their own alliances to counter the administration’s guidance on vaccines.\n\nU.S. vaccination rates have dropped and the share of children with exemptions has reached an all-time high, according to federal data. At the same time, rates of diseases that can be protected against with vaccines, such as measles and whooping cough, are rising across the country.\n\nKennedy's past anti-vaccine activism\n\nKennedy's past skepticism of vaccines has come under scrutiny since Trump first nominated him to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nDuring his Senate confirmation testimony last year, Kennedy told lawmakers that a closely scrutinized 2019 trip he took to Samoa, which came before a devastating measles outbreak, had “nothing to do with vaccines.”\n\nBut documents obtained by The Guardian and The Associated Press undermine that testimony. Emails sent by staffers at the U.S. Embassy and the United Nations said that Kennedy sought to meet with top Samoan officials during his trip to the Pacific island nation.\n\nSamoan officials later said Kennedy’s trip bolstered the credibility of anti-vaccine activists before the measles outbreak, which sickened thousands of people and killed 83, mostly children under age 5.\n\nMixed messaging on autism, vaccines\n\nOz's comments mark a broader pattern among administration officials of voicing discordant and at times contradictory statements about the efficacy of vaccines amid an overhaul of U.S. public health policy.\n\nOfficials have walked a fine line in criticizing past U.S. vaccine policy, often at times appearing to express sympathy for unfounded conspiracy theories from anti-vaccine activists, while also not straying too far from established science.\n\nDuring a Senate hearing Tuesday, Jay Bhattacharya, the director of the National Institutes of Health, said no single vaccine causes autism, but he did not rule out the possibility that research may find some combination of vaccines could have negative health side effects.\n\nBut Kennedy, in Senate testimony, has argued that a link between vaccines and autism has not been disproved.\n\nHe has previously claimed that some components of vaccines, like the mercury-containing preservative thimerosal, may cause childhood neurological disorders such as autism. Most vaccines for measles, mumps and rubella do not contain thimerosal. A federal vaccine advisory board overhauled by Kennedy last year voted to no longer recommend thimerosal-containing vaccines.\n\nAdministration public health officials often cite the need to restore trust in public health systems after the coronavirus pandemic, when vaccine policy and the general public health response to the deadly pandemic became a highly polarizing topic in American politics.\n\nMisinformation and conspiracy theories about the public health system also spread during the pandemic, and longtime anti-vaccine activist groups saw a swell in interest from the wider public.\n\nKennedy, who for years led the anti-vaccine activist group Children's Health Defense, has been criticized for ordering reviews of vaccines and public health guidelines that leading medical research groups have deemed settled science.\n\nPublic health experts also criticized the president for making unfounded claims about highly politicized health issues. During a September Oval Office event, Trump asserted without evidence that Tylenol and vaccines are linked to a rise in the incidence of autism in the United States.",

    "description": "Kim Kardashian's trainer explains how strength training transformed her mental health, career, and approach to fitness after immigration.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Senada Greca, founder of WeRise and cofounder of Aonic. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nAt least four times a week, I meet with Kim Kardashian for a personal training session. Today, we're focused on the upper body and core. Over our hour-and-a-half session, we'll do assisted pull-ups, hollow-body chest presses, face-pulls, and more. Kim likes to end most training sessions with a dead hang on the bar.\n\nI've been training Kim for three years now. I also help millions of other people (mostly women) through my training platform WeRise, and the fitness and nutrition videos I post on social media.\n\nStrength training is powerful, especially for women. Once you know the strength your body possesses, you'll understand how to feel good in your body, rather than feeling like you need to shrink or punish it. I know, because that's a change I've made myself.\n\nI'm the oldest of three girls, born in Albania. After the communist government was overthrown in the early 1990s, there was a lot of civil unrest. I remember the first time we heard gunshots. We hid under the bed, staying down for a long time.\n\nLuckily, my family won the green card lottery (Editor's note: The green card lottery is formally called the Diversity Visa Program, which provides up to 55,000 visas through random selection.), and we were able to immigrate to America in 1997 when I was 14. That helped set up a safer, more prosperous future for my sisters and me.\n\nAt the time, it was very challenging. I spoke with a heavy accent and dressed differently from my classmates in upstate New York, which led to a lot of bullying. Since I was the only one in the family who spoke English, I had to help my parents with legal documents, doctors' appointments, and getting my sisters into school. It was a lot.\n\nEverything in my life felt out of control. The one thing I could control was my eating, and not long after immigrating, I developed anorexia. Within a few years, I was also struggling with depression and anxiety. I was exercising, but only to punish my body.\n\nIn college, I connected with counseling and medication that helped me start getting healthy. The real turning point came when I was in my mid-20s and met a new primary care doctor. She was in her 50s, but running marathons every quarter. She taught me to think about exercise as a way to support mental health. I started running and became more physically and mentally stable.\n\nAbout 10 years ago, in my mid-30s, I started strength training. It changed my life, as I started using exercise to nourish myself.\n\nIn my immigrant family, financial security was always very important. I had a corporate job, and had never considered building something on my own — it just wasn't done.\n\nI started teaching yoga at night, and loved how my classes made people feel. In 2019, I began posting videos of my workouts, at first for myself. I was extremely consistent, which helped me grow a big following. When the pandemic happened, my following grew exponentially as people looked for workouts they could do at home.\n\nIn 2020, I launched my website and began charging for memberships. I quickly saw that my fitness business could be stable and successful. That gave me the courage to quit my corporate job to follow my passion. In the years since, my audience has only grown, and I've had amazing opportunities, like training Kim.\n\nToday, I'm in the best shape of my life — physically and mentally — at 43. I don't often talk about my age, because I feel ageless and don't want to define myself by a number. At the same time, I want to show that getting older doesn't have to mean winding down.",

    "description": "BBC health correspondent James Gallagher gets his blood analysed to understand how air pollution is killing us.",
    "fullText": "I'm in a laboratory staring at my blood under a microscope. Rather than pristine red blood cells, some of them have been tainted with black markings. I'm now one of the first people in the world to see air pollution building up inside their body.\n\nLess than an hour ago I was standing next to four lanes of busy central London traffic. It was the type of road where you can taste the air and you're left with a gritty sensation in your mouth.\n\nI had volunteered to stand there for 10 minutes; breathing in dirty air as part of an experiment to understand how air pollution is affecting our bodies and damaging our health.\n\nIn the UK, poor air quality is thought to kill 30,000 people a year, as well as harming babies in the womb and exacerbating conditions from asthma to dementia.\n\nMost of the air pollution I was breathing in came from traffic – billowing invisibly out of exhaust pipes, but also released by the wear and tear of tyres and brakes.\n\nProf Jonathan Grigg, from Queen Mary University of London, calls this spot his \"exposure chamber\".\n\nShouting over the blare of revving engines and sirens, he tells me most people incorrectly assume air pollution is all filtered out by our nose or mouth, or is trapped and then brought up out of the lungs.\n\n\"What we're looking at is whether the smallest particles are not only staying in your lung, but moving across into your bloodstream and going around your body,\" says Grigg.\n\nAfter our dose of London air, we head back to the laboratory where I have my finger pricked and a sample of blood prepared for examination.\n\nUnder the microscope, we can easily see the red disc-shaped cells that transport oxygen around our bodies.\n\nIt takes a few minutes for me to get my eyes in, but then the air pollution becomes apparent. It appears as tiny black dots stuck to the red blood cells.\n\nThese are pieces of carbon and other chemicals, like a miniature lump of coal, that come from the incomplete burning of fuel. They're known as PM 2.5, because the particles are smaller than 2.5 micrometres.\n\nI'm not surprised to see air pollution, it's why we're doing the experiment, but I can't escape a feeling of being dirtied, contaminated… sullied by it.\n\nResearcher Dr Norrice Liu has looked at more than a dozen volunteers' blood samples as part of a study.\n\nOn average, one in every two to three thousand red blood cells had picked up a hitch-hiking piece of pollution.\n\nThat might not sound like much, but scale it up to the full five litres of blood in an adult and the researchers estimate there could be 80 million red blood cells transporting pollution around our bodies.\n\n\"It's a bit upsetting to see that, isn't it?\" says Liu. \"Every time I walk by a busy road, now I'm thinking how much of this is travelling around my body… you just feel like you don't want to be out on the road much.\"\n\nI stood beside the road for just 10 minutes. It was busy, but it was not an extreme scenario. Your blood has probably looked like this too.\n\nThe team at Queen Mary University of London have shown that levels of air pollution in the blood come back down after about two hours of breathing clean air.\n\nGrigg was \"pretty shocked\" the air pollution was so visible in blood, but says the important question is where it's going.\n\nIt's not being breathed back out, he says, some may be filtered out by the kidneys and leave the body in urine. But the most likely answer is that particles of pollution are \"wiggling their way through the lining of the blood vessels and lodging in various organs\".\n\nThis research is starting to explain why air pollution has been linked to so many health problems far beyond the lungs, including in the brain and for babies still in the womb.\n\nDeposits of black carbon from air pollution have been found in the human body including in placentas analysed after birth.\n\n\"There's no reason why it's choosing one organ over another,\" says Liu, \"so chances are they're everywhere.\"\n\nAnd there are other forms of air pollution, such as nitrogen oxides, which are gases and are not visible down the microscope, but are known to cause harm.\n\nThe World Health Organization says 99% of the world population breathes in polluted air leading to seven million deaths a year. A report by the Royal College of Physicians estimates the figure for the UK is 30,000 deaths a year.\n\nSir Stephen Holgate, who led that report, said there was no doubt air pollution was damaging our health - \"it's nailed, it's game set and match\" - and the clearest evidence was coming from areas that were cutting air pollution and seeing the benefit.\n\nBut now that air pollution is \"largely invisible\", unlike the smogs of yesteryear, most of us don't realise we're breathing it in and \"don't really understand that air pollution on a daily basis is damaging\", he says.\n\nAir pollution has been linked to harms throughout our lives and throughout our bodies.\n\nThere are many ways dirty air can harm the other organs of our body, but triggering inflammation is thought to be the main one. Inflammation is our body's natural response to injury and infection, but can also affect blood vessels to make heart attacks and strokes more likely.\n\nInflammation in the lungs has been shown to wake up dormant cancerous cells, which then develop into deadly tumours. Around one in 10 lung cancers are thought to be caused by air pollution in the UK.\n\nEven while in the womb, air pollution is even thought to alter how a developing baby's DNA is functioning during critical stages of development.\n\n\"There's a very sensitive period when air pollution can cause a problem and it undoubtedly does: small lungs, small heart and some problems with brain development,\" says Sir Stephen.\n\nAt the other end of life, components of air pollution seem to be \"accelerating the process\" of dementia, he says, by helping plaques of toxic proteins form inside the brain.\n\nThere is advice on how to minimise our exposure to air pollution - including walking on quieter side streets or keeping away from the edge of the road so you're further from traffic. This is especially important for babies in buggies, who are much closer to the height of exhaust pipes.\n\nGrigg's study showed a tight-fitting FFP2 mask led to less air pollution in the blood, but \"we're not saying that everyone should wear a mask\", says Grigg, adding some clinically vulnerable people including those \"recovering from a heart attack or have chronic respiratory disease\" might benefit while in areas of high pollution.\n\nBut the tricky thing with air pollution is you're often breathing in the pollution caused by other people. It is not easy to just live somewhere else if your house is on a busy road.\n\nChanges to cars – not just sales of electric vehicles, but emissions standards on newer diesel and petrol engines – are improving air quality.\n\nBut Grigg says: \"I think the more we understand the mechanisms of how it can cause these effects, the more we can add to the pressure for policy makers to reduce exposure - because that's the answer in the end.\"\n\nInside Health was produced by Tom Bonnett",

    "description": "AT&T has introduced the amiGO Jr. Phone, a child-friendly smartphone with safety features to address concerns about screen time and mental health.",
    "fullText": "AT&T is hoping to entice parents concerned about screentime with a smartphone designed for children. Whether children will be enticed is another question.\n\nThe telecommunications company debuted the amiGO Jr. Phone on Friday. The company says it will give parents greater control over how their children interact with smartphones. The rollout also featured the new amiGO Jr. Watch 2.\n\n\"Putting customers at the center of our business means anticipating what comes next — not just responding to what already exists,\" Erin Scarborough, the senior vice president of Revenue Management & Commercialization at AT&T, said in a press release. \"As smartphones become a daily necessity, parents have made it clear they need better tools to help their children navigate the digital world safely.\"\n\nAfter purchasing the smartphone, parents can download an app that allows them to set several safety features. They include location tracking, up to 30 pre-approved contacts, established safe zones, customizable controls for each device, and \"schedules to limit distractions during school hours.\"\n\nThe app can also implement safety features on AT&T's amiGO Jr tablet, which the company released in 2024.\n\nAT&T collaborated with Samsung to build the smartphone's hardware. The smartphone costs $209.99.\n\nIn the age of smartphones, parents have raised concerns over the tech's impact on children's and teens' mental health.\n\nA 2025 study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that teenagers who had higher non-schoolwork-related screentime were more likely to have \"adverse health outcomes,\" including irregular sleep routines, depression symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and insufficient peer support.\n\nAccess to social media on smartphones is also a concern. Over a dozen attorneys general filed lawsuits against TikTok in 2024, accusing the social media platform of targeting young users with addictive algorithms and features. Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, has also faced legal action over the platform's potentially harmful impact on young users.\n\nAs a result, parents have sought different ways to navigate the complex technology landscape. Some parents have invested in products like Gabb, a kid-friendly smartphone, while others have purchased landline phones created for children. Dumb phones, which don't have social media and other advanced app functions, have emerged as another option.\n\nA growing number of young folks are also ditching smart devices as part of a movement embracing real-life connections and a healthy relationship with technology.\n\n\"I feel like I've spent so much of my early life glued to a screen. I find it particularly addicting and incredibly dangerous,\" a Gen Z woman told Business Insider in 2025. \"I think we need to be worried about the repercussions this will have on both individuals and society.\"",

    "description": "I hate when influencers are right about something.",
    "fullText": "When Owala water bottles started appearing in every influencer's \"daily essentials\" video and cluttering my Instagram feed, I rolled my eyes. I assumed this was another overhyped product that people would forget about in three months, just the latest in a long line of Stanley Cup successors.\n\nOne of my biggest personality quirks (or \"flaws,\" according to some) is that I'm a major spiller. The Stanley Cup's open straw is a non-starter for me. In fact, no water bottle technology has been stronger than my ability to spill its contents. After watching my latest bottle create yet another puddle in my bag, I caved and bought an Owala. And now, I have to admit this water bottle is officially an upgrade in my life.\n\nI'm a huge fan of the FreeSip lid—yes, that's what they call it, and yes, it lives up to the name—is genuinely brilliant in its simplicity. There's a built-in straw for when you want to sip without tilting (perfect for walking, driving, or my personal use case: lying horizontally on the couch). Flip it open a bit more, and there's a wide-mouth spout for when you want to chug. One lid, two drinking options, and crucially, a push-button lock that has saved my laptop, my physical planner, and my dignity. Seriously, I cannot emphasize this enough: I am a world-class spiller. The Owala's lock mechanism is the only thing standing between me and constant catastrophe.\n\nAt 24 ounces, it's the perfect size—big enough that I'm not refilling it every hour, small enough that it actually fits in my bag's side pocket and doesn't make me look like I'm headed out for a weekend camping trip when I'm just going to run errands. It's become my constant companion without feeling like I'm lugging around gym equipment.\n\nSometimes the influencers are onto something. And now I'm part of the problem, becoming the exact person who won't shut up about their water bottle. But when you find something that solves multiple persistent problems at once, when a product actually delivers on its promises instead of just looking good in photos, it's hard not to evangelize a little. The Owala works. I'm staying hydrated, my bag is staying dry, and I'm sipping with ease wherever I go.",

These metrics can be made visible in a project-driven dashboard, a live operating system that tracks the real-time health, velocity, and strategic alignment of a transformation portfolio.

    "description": "Scotland players tell BBC Sport their mental health suffered after they were told their contracts would end following the World Cup.",
    "fullText": "When Scotland left the pitch following their gutsy 2025 Women's Rugby World Cup quarter-final defeat by England, for some of the squad it was a moment of pride that marked how far the team had come.\n\nFor others the full-time whistle signalled the end of an emotionally damaging tournament from which some say they are still struggling to recover.\n\nReaching the last eight was the team's best performance at a World Cup in 23 years.\n\nHowever, players have since told BBC Sport that behind the scenes Scottish Rugby's management of player contracts before the tournament left them in \"probably the worst case of mental health\" they had ever had, with one saying she suffered a breakdown as a result.\n\n\"I had an actual real-life breakdown in club to one of my coaches,\" she said.\n\n\"I've been put on medication for depression because of the impact that it's had on me.\"\n\nAnother said: \"I came back from the World Cup in a hole, a shell of myself.\"\n\nIn response, Scottish Rugby said the union was \"aware of the potential challenges players faced in their mental health during this time\" and that a package of support was put in place.\n\n\"We would not question the personal experience of an individual athlete,\" the union's response continued.\n\n\"We would, however, dispute the lack of care referenced.\"\n\nBBC Sport spoke to four players involved in the World Cup and one who was in the wider Scotland training squad. Contributors wished to remain anonymous out of fear of jeopardising their future in the sport.\n\nPlayers said their contracts were due for renewal in June 2025, two months before the World Cup began in August, and that they had asked for 12-month deals beyond that to ensure job security and so they could focus on their performances at the tournament.\n\nHowever, according to those contacted, while some players in Scotland's 32-player World Cup squad were given 12-month contracts in May 2025, a quarter were told their deals would end in October, a decision one player described as a \"big shock\".\n\nAt the time, contracts ranged from £18,000 to £27,000 and in most cases were the player's main source of income. Those playing in the Premiership could also earn up to about £10,000 from their club contracts.\n\nThe players who spoke to BBC Sport said that having to compete at the World Cup knowing their jobs and international careers were potentially about to come to an end put them under huge mental strain.\n\nThey also said they were not given the proper support by Scottish Rugby to cope with the situation.\n\nSome of those who were told they would lose their funding after October had been part of the Scotland team for many years and were regularly starting international matches.\n\nOne said that \"despite clear signs\" that some were suffering with the news, \"no transitional help\" was offered by Scottish Rugby.\n\nAnother said she spent downtime between World Cup matches searching for a job.\n\nIn 2025 Scottish Rugby said it would increase the number of contracts available to players from 32 to 35 for the 2025-26 season.\n\nOne player said \"everybody understands contracts aren't going to be guaranteed every year\", before questioning why Scottish Rugby did not provide access to career advisors or psychologists for those affected.\n\nAnother added: \"It's not about contracts. It's not about resources. It's literally about treating people like human beings.\"\n\nScottish Rugby's response stated that psychological support was embedded in Scotland camps and available to all players regardless of contract status.\n\nIt said a player development manager supported players on off-field matters, including employment, and that exit meetings were held at the end of contracts to identify any potential physical or psychological support that may be needed.\n\nAsked if she felt Scottish Rugby had failed in its duty of care to players, one player responded \"without a doubt\" and referenced the death of international Siobhan Cattigan aged 26 in 2021.\n\n\"How many people need to die before you take it seriously?\" she added, addressing Scottish Rugby. \"You've clearly not learned.\"\n\nCattigan's family said undetected rugby-related brain damage caused a \"catastrophic decline\" in her health and led to her death.\n\nIn 2023 Scottish Rugby said it \"let down\" Cattigan's family and chairman John McGuigan apologised \"wholeheartedly for any anguish we caused Siobhan during her time with Scottish Rugby\".\n\nMcGuigan added at the time: \"We have listened and heeded the lessons and, in Siobhan's memory, commit to making changes to ensure we are a better organisation in the future.\"\n\nAnother player said the communication of selection decisions left her \"unbelievably unwell\", adding: \"There are loads of harsh realities of elite sport: injury and non-selection. How you manage people is more important than ever.\n\n\"You can't treat people like they're just disposable, regardless of the elite sport wheel being a forever turning one.\n\n\"We still need to have empathy. And I just didn't feel like there was much at all.\"\n\nScottish Rugby's response to this story said: \"We are very uncomfortable with this comparison to Siobhan's own tragic situation and the inference in any way that we were negligent in our support to her.\"\n\nPlayers told BBC Sport that the squad discussed boycotting one match during the 2025 Women's Six Nations - five months before the World Cup began - to try to reach a resolution with Scottish Rugby on its request for 12-month contracts.\n\nAll the players contacted say they were told contract decisions were based on performance and that they may still get a new contract should they perform well at the tournament, adding further pressure.\n\n\"It literally was a do or die lifeline,\" one player said.\n\n\"It's like I need to do everything I can on this rugby pitch, otherwise I'm not going to have a job and I'm going to struggle to pay my rent.\n\n\"When you're not sleeping, you don't have an appetite. You're just miserable most of the day. It's really hard to then put in a performance or do yourself justice.\"\n\nScottish Rugby's response said that players were told \"on a number of occasions that their standalone playing performance at the World cup was not the sole criteria for any possible change to their contract situation\".\n\nTold her contract would end in October, one player said she was on job search websites \"most nights\" during the tournament looking for jobs \"that were appropriate\" for her life as a club rugby player.\n\nShe said: \"Before you even started a job, you're trying to bargain and speak with a new employer and be like, 'Can I finish at this time?' Because I have to actually go to my other job [club rugby training].\n\n\"Then I'm going to come in tired in the morning because I've not got into bed until midnight.\"\n\nPlayers no longer on contracts can still represent Scotland, but they now fall under the country's National Team Agreement, which offers them £75 a day, not including rest days, for attending Scotland training camps.\n\nOne player said \"she can't be involved\" for that amount, adding: \"I won't be able to afford to pay my mortgage.\"\n\nAnother player said concerns over her future took \"an emotional toll\", adding: \"I didn't want to be there. I look back on it with exhaustion. It was such a big opportunity but I have nothing but negative thoughts around it.\n\n\"[After the tournament] I removed myself from social settings, any settings where people could ask me loads about rugby.\n\n\"If I did get into that environment, I would try to remove myself as quickly as possible because it made me panic and stress.\"\n\nThe player said Scotland Rugby had not been in contact about any follow-up support.\n\n\"There's been no kind of input about, 'do you need psychology?' or anything like that,\" she said.\n\nScottish Rugby detailed the steps put in place to support players:\n\nAccess to clinical psychology and a player development manager.\n\nA mandatory medical exit meeting to \"identify any potential physical or psychological support\".\n\nAn independent HR exit interview and a six-week post-contract window to access \"exit support services\" if needed.\n\nScottish Rugby said: \"From the outset of this process we recognised that players - particularly those whose contracts were due to end - would need additional support during the Rugby World Cup period and in planning their next steps.\n\n\"We believe we did deliver on our duty of care by the provision of both psychological and career guidance support throughout 2025, including in the lead-up to and during, the RWC.\n\n\"The entire playing group were out of contract in June 2025 and we made the decision to extend all contracts through to the end of October 2025 to provide a degree of stability through the RWC itself.\n\n\"The timings involved were designed to give clarity to all players as early as possible, following a timeline agreed and requested by the players themselves.\"\n\nListen to the latest Rugby Union Weekly podcast",

    "description": "The World Health Organization found that nearly 40% of cancer cases worldwide are linked to preventable causes.",
    "fullText": "A new report from the World Health Organization found that nearly 7 million cases of cancer worldwide were preventable.\n\nAnalyzing 18.7 million new cancer cases in 2022 (the most recent data available to them), researchers found that nearly 4 out of 10 cases were linked to 30 modifiable risk factors, including smoking tobacco, infections like HPV and hepatitis B, and consuming alcohol. Stomach, lung, and cervical cancer accounted for almost half of all preventable cancers in the report.\n\nThe findings are a comprehensive assessment of cancer cases globally, which vary greatly by region, so while promising, they come with limitations. \n\nThe news comes less than two weeks after it was revealed that colon cancer is now the leading cause of cancer death in people under 50.\n\nCancer can be caused by a variety of factors, including family history, genetic mutations, and environmental pollutants — all things out of our control — but some risk can be mitigated with lifestyle modifications.\n\nResearch shows that diets involving lots of ultra-processed foods (UPFs) are linked to higher cancer risk. They can increase inflammation and disrupt the gut microbiome, increasing the risk of colon and ovarian cancer.\n\nA diet rich in whole foods is the best way to go. Dr. Daniel Landau, an oncologist specializing in genitourinary cancers, previously told Business Insider that he mostly follows the Mediterranean diet, focusing on lean protein, fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, and legumes while limiting red meat (which might be carcinogenic), dairy, alcohol, sugar, and UPFs.\n\nGut-healthy foods are also important. Dr. Susan Bullman, an associate professor at MD Anderson Cancer Center who specializes in gut health and cancer research, previously told Business Insider that she eats fiber-rich foods like pears and probiotics like kefir to feed beneficial gut microbes. Eating a wide variety of plants, such as swapping out vegetable sides or sprinkling seeds on top of salads, can also improve gut health.\n\nExercise has long been associated with a reduced risk of cancer. One 2025 trial found that a strict workout regimen for preventing colon cancer resurgence than expensive treatments like chemotherapy. While scientists are still exploring the reasons why exercise is so effective at cancer prevention, they have their theories. Dr. Paul Oberstein, a medical oncologist at NYU Langone, previously told Business Insider that exercise is probably reducing inflammation, which may help slow tumor growth.\n\nDr. Sue Hwang, an oncologist who was diagnosed with breast cancer, said you should aim for 30 minutes of exercise a day, whether it's strength training or cardio.\n\nIf you can't make it to a gym every day, she said, even taking a walk or playing with your kids in a playground helps. Even vigorous daily movements, like climbing up stairs or carrying heavy groceries, can cut down cancer risk. Still, the best thing you can do is pencil in real workouts.\n\nBeing aware of early cancer symptoms, like blood in your stool for colon cancer, can help you seek screenings earlier than the recommended starting age.\n\nIt's also important to be aware of your family history, any genetic mutations like Lynch syndrome that increase risks of several cancers, or other factors like PCOS for endometrial cancer.\n\nDr. Thaïs Aliabadi, an OB-GYN who helped Olivia Munn get diagnosed with stage 1 breast cancer, said collecting data on your body, such as previous biopsies or breast density, can help you better assess your risk.",

    "fullText": "Researchers are sounding the alarm after finding antibiotic resistance genes released from melting Antarctic glaciers.\n\nA study published in the journal Biocontaminant examined the effects of glacial melting on our water supply.\n\nGlaciers serve as reservoirs for antibiotic resistance genes, or ARGs, and other microbes. When they are released from the ice, they enter our water systems, posing a major health risk to people downstream.\n\nMillions of people get their water from glacier-fed rivers and lakes. ARGs are strands of DNA that make bacteria more resistant to drugs. When ARGs in meltwater make their way into our water supply, they become a global public health risk.\n\nThe study emphasizes the importance of viewing glaciers, rivers, and lakes as being part of a \"glacier continuum.\" This means they are an interconnected system rather than separate environments.\n\nFrom our gas-powered cars to overconsumption, human activity has contributed to the production of heat-trapping gases that warm the planet. Rising global temperatures have caused glaciers to rapidly melt, causing elevated sea levels and releasing ARGs.\n\nARGs from melting glaciers are worrisome because they help facilitate the spread of diseases. This threat is compounded by the fact that our growing microplastic problem is also helping antibiotic-resistant bacteria breed. As a result, medicines are being rendered less effective.\n\nOne way we can combat warming temperatures is by making more eco-friendly lifestyle choices. This might include installing solar panels, which can help you slash utility rates and cut energy-related pollution.\n\nTCD's Solar Explorer curates competitive bids from vetted installers, saving you up to $10,000 on installation. EnergySage, a TCD partner, provides a free service that helps people find installers, save thousands, and understand available incentives.\n\nOngoing research into the effects of glacial melt helps us understand and approach the problem of ARGs.\n\nWhat's the most you'd pay per month to put solar panels on your roof if there was no down payment?\n\nI'd only do it if someone else paid for it\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\n\"Climate change is reshaping microbial risks in ways we are only beginning to understand,\" study co-author Guannan Mao of Lanzhou University told The Microbiologist.\n\n\"Recognizing glaciers as part of the global antibiotic resistance landscape is an important step toward protecting both environmental and human health.\"\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": "Dr. Adam Perlman prioritizes strength training, sleep, and a low-sugar diet to boost his metabolic health.",
    "fullText": "When he was first starting his physician training, Dr. Adam Perlman had a daily ritual: ordering a very sugary coffee.\n\n\"I'm from Boston, so I'd go to Dunkin' Donuts and drink my coffee with cream and three sugars,\" Perlman, 59, told Business Insider.\n\nNow an integrative and functional medicine doctor and former chief medical officer for Mayo Clinic's integrative medicine program, his habits changed as he learned more about his health.\n\n\"I went from cream and two sugars, to cream and one sugar, to artificial sweeteners, and those weren't good for you, so I learned to drink it without that,\" he said, eventually eliminating dairy creamer as well because it upset his stomach. Now, he uses a sugar-free, oat milk-based creamer. \"I made these changes over time, and I think that's really important because then they become a part of your routine, and they stick.\"\n\nEven now, he said, new research, like what we're learning about the gut microbiome's roles in metabolic health, inspires him to gradually tweak his lifestyle. \"I didn't think about probiotics as it related to metabolism up until just a few years ago,\" he said.\n\nBased on his work, he shared three habits he's worked into his daily routine to boost his metabolism and aid in fat loss.\n\nPerlman's years of research and work experience led him to think of his diet like a budget.\n\n\"Protein and vegetables, they're kind of like my mortgage and utilities,\" he said. Perlman, who strength trains and practices martial arts like Krav Maga almost every day, focuses a lot on protein, which builds muscle. He likes leaner protein sources like chicken, turkey, and lower-mercury tuna, which can help lower cholesterol compared to red meat.\n\nAs for ultra-processed foods or products with added sugar and simple carbohydrates, \"those for me are impulse purchases. Easy to overspend, and they don't necessarily pay the dividends.\" He drinks seltzer instead of sugary drinks and often snacks on frozen grapes.\n\nOver the past few years, he added a \"microbiome twist\" to his diet: making sure he also eats a wide variety of plants and fermented foods like Greek yogurt throughout the week, as good gut health is linked to metabolic health.\n\n\"I'm less about counting or tracking and more about just trying to keep things colorful, sort of eat a rainbow,\" he said. For example, he tries to buy a range of fresh produce when he shops — like sweet potatoes, sugar snap peas, and green beans — and adds raisins to his favorite broccoli slaw to include more plant diversity in his meals.\n\nIn the past few years, Perlman has made tweaks to his sleep routine, as keeping a consistent schedule helps regulate hormones and promote a healthy metabolism.\n\nHe installed blackout shades, bought a new noise machine, and cools down the temperature in his bedroom before he winds down. \"The body likes a little cooler temperature when you're falling asleep,\" he said.\n\nHe also started setting boundaries around his sleep. Sometimes, he'll watch a show with his wife and she'll ask if he wants to start another episode. If it's getting late — around 9 or 9:30 p.m. — \"It's not uncommon for me to say, 'If you don't mind, why don't we hold off?'\" Instead, he'll read in bed until he falls asleep.\n\nHis most recent change is focusing more on stress in his daily life, which can slow metabolism and promote the production of visceral fat.\n\nWhile he said his morning exercise routine certainly helps, he wanted to do more.\n\n\"I'm on day 42 of starting with some mindfulness in the morning,\" he said. He uses a guided meditation app and dedicates 10 to 15 minutes when he wakes up, wearing headphones so as not to wake his wife.\n\n\"It's newer for me,\" he said. \"I'm just kind of playing with it and seeing how that feels in my routine.\"",

    "fullText": "You wouldn't wait until your 50s to start saving for retirement — so why wait until your heart is already at risk to start protecting it?\n\nHeart disease is spiking among younger people, in part because people in their 20s, 30s, and 40s are procrastinating on their health, according to Dr. Sadiya Khan.\n\nKhan, a professor of cardiovascular epidemiology at Northwestern University, told Business Insider that changes to your diet and exercise habits now can pay big dividends as you age.\n\n\"You can't just become older and then hope to make all these changes,\" she said.\n\nThe earlier you understand your heart health, the better equipped you are to make healthy decisions for future you.\n\nRight now, most of us are behind in our investments to our cardiovascular health. The average American's heart is 4 to 7 years older than their calendar age, according to Khan's research.\n\n\"All of us are naturally driven to procrastinate,\" she said. \"You try to worry about the things that are immediately in front of you, and it's harder to prioritize and give as much attention to something that is a long-term consequence.\n\nAn online tool, developed by Khan and her team, helps forecast a person's risk of heart attack or stroke over the next 30 years by illustrating how they stack up to their peers. It shows their percentile rank for heart health: in other words, out of 100 people the same age and sex, how many have a higher or lower risk of cardiovascular disease.\n\nKhan said the new tool uniquely uses percentiles to help people manage their health by understanding their risk and making changes if needed. Patients can then prioritize which habits provide the best bang for their buck in terms of health benefits, starting with what Khan recommends most.\n\nKhan said a big challenge with heart health is that it can be highly individualized. All the factors involved — diet, exercise habits, genetics, and stress — can vary widely from person to person.\n\n\"It's not going to be a one-size-fits-all,\" she said. \"It's this overarching goal that we need to personalize how we communicate risk and how we can share that information in a way that works for each patient.\"\n\nThat makes it hard to recommend a specific game plan to boost everyone's heart health. However, there are a few strategies that can pay off for most people.\n\nFor best results, try to make small, sustainable changes that you can keep up over time.\n\n\"It depends on what works for you and what you are able to stick with,\" Khan said. \"They all matter, but you don't also need to do it all at once.\"",

    "fullText": "Paul George, a nine-time NBA All-Star forward for the Philadelphia 76ers, was issued a 25-game suspension by the league on Saturday for violating the NBA Anti-Drug Program.\n\nGeorge's ban will begin with Saturday's Sixers home game against New Orleans.\n\nThe 35-year-old American who has averaged 20.5 points over his 16-year NBA career, said in a statement to ESPN he mistakenly took a mental health medication that violated the NBA and players union joint anti-drug policy.\n\n\"Over the past few years, I've discussed the importance of mental health, and in the course of recently seeking treatment for an issue of my own, I made the mistake of taking an improper medication,\" George told ESPN.\n\n\"I take full responsibility for my actions and apologize to the Sixers organization, my teammates and the Philly fans for my poor decision making during this process.\n\n\"I'm focused on using this time to make sure that my mind and body are in the best condition to help the team when I return.\"\n\nGeorge would not be eligible to return until the 76ers play host to Chicago on March 25, with only 10 games remaining in the regular season for the Sixers.\n\nGeorge has averaged 16.0 points, 5.1 rebounds, 3.7 assists and 1.5 steals over 27 games this season for Philadelphia, which stands 26-21 and sixth in the Eastern Conference.\n\nTogether with Joel Embiid and Tyrese Maxey, the 76ers were expected to be contenders this season but their time together as a triple threat has been limited by injuries.\n\nThe ban is expected to cost George about $11.7 million of his season salary and save the 76ers about $5 million in luxury tax payments under the league's salary cap system.\n\nTaken by Indiana with the 10th pick in the 2010 NBA Draft, George played seven seasons for the Pacers, earning the 2013 NBA Most Improved Player award.\n\nGeorge, who captured Olympic gold with the US team of NBA stars at Rio in 2016, was traded to Oklahoma City in 2017 and led the NBA with 2.2 steals a game in the 2018-19 campaign.\n\nIn 2019, George was sent to the Los Angeles Clippers in a blockbuster deal that brought reigning NBA Most Valuable Player Shai Gilgeous-Alexander to the Thunder along with five first-round draft picks and Italy's Danilo Gallinari -- a swap that helped the Clippers land free agent Kawhi Leonard.\n\nGeorge spent five seasons with the Clippers before opting out of his contract in 2024 and signing a four-year deal worth $212 million with the 76ers.\n\nInjuries limited George to only 41 appearances last season.",

    "title": "I tracked my blood glucose levels for two weeks. It felt like I was in sugar jail.",
    "description": "The health reporter Kim Schewitz often feels tired, and hoped tracking her blood sugar levels using a continuous glucose monitor would help. Then the app told her to do calf raises for 15 minutes.",
    "fullText": "Blood sugar is a hot topic, and after months of watching content waxing lyrical about \"balancing it,\" I needed to know if it was true that tracking my glucose levels would help boost my energy.\n\nSo with a few taps on my laptop, I ordered a continuous glucose monitor: a small white disk carrying a tiny needle, which charts blood sugar levels in near real-time via an app.\n\nDesigned for people with diabetes to closely monitor their glucose levels and prevent potentially life-threatening fluctuations, in recent years, they've become a buzzy lifestyle wearable marketed at healthy people.\n\nGlucose is our primary energy source, which we get from carbohydrates in food and drink. The body uses it for energy, and anything that's left over is stored in the muscles, liver, or fat cells for later use. Sugary snacks and simple carbs like white pasta tend to lead to bigger blood sugar spikes, while pairing carbs with protein, fats, and fiber has been found to smooth out the curve.\n\nThe term \"glucose spike\" has become a dirty word, as wellness influencers say that peaks and troughs lead to weight gain, energy crashes, and cravings. In turn, there are plenty of personal anecdotes online — but limited evidence — that \"balancing\" blood sugar by keeping it stable has helped people lose weight, feel happier and more energetic, sleep better, and avoid chronic disease.\n\nDespite following a pretty balanced diet — I eat protein and plenty of fiber with most meals, and few ultra-processed foods — I'm often tired and lacking energy. I was curious to see if the longevity bros were onto something, and if wearing a CGM for two weeks could provide any helpful insights.\n\nThe experience started with the sharp scratch of the CGM needle puncturing my skin. I held the plastic applicator to the back of my left arm, pressed down, and before I knew it, was branded with a white plastic circle. It stayed there for two weeks, measuring the glucose levels in the fluid around my cells and sending the data via Bluetooth to a line chart on my phone. I felt very aware of the CGM when my arms were exposed in public, which made me feel a little self-conscious.\n\nAt the beginning, it was exciting having access to this new metric, and the first thing I did was eat a rich chocolate truffle.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the little line on the chart — representing my glucose level — started moving sharply up, but I was pleased to see that it stayed within the healthy range of 3.9 mmol/L to 7.8 mmol/L. This was delineated on the chart by two dotted lines, which made it easy to see if I was having what would be considered a glucose spike or dip.\n\nThe line moved every time I ate or drank something other than water, exercised, or felt stressed (both can affect glucose levels).\n\nI ate normally to get an idea of my typical daily blood glucose levels, and in hindsight see that I quickly fell into the trap of judging meals as \"good\" or \"bad\" based on their effect. I know that's not a healthy way to think of food, but I guess I subconsciously believed the reductionist idea that any rise in blood sugar should be avoided. In fact, fluctuations within the healthy range (and sometimes outside of it) are just a normal part of digestion.\n\nSo I was pleased when my go-to breakfast didn't cause a spike, but surprised when the flat white coffee with 2% milk that I drank before it caused the level to rise as much as my entire breakfast.\n\nI didn't love that my protein and fiber-rich lunch of ground turkey and black bean chili with red rice sent my line close to the top of the healthy range, but reasoned that was probably because it was larger than my breakfast. I felt particularly disheartened when a dinner of soba noodles, which are made from buckwheat flour (complex carbs), and tofu (protein) in broth with cabbage (fiber) marked the first sharp spike.\n\nI was even more confused when the chili caused a huge spike and the noodles didn't when I ate the same lunch and dinner the next day.\n\nMy blood sugar didn't exceed the healthy range many times, but when it did, it was after I consumed:\n\nI would consider half of these balanced meals, but according to my chart, they raised my blood sugar more than the sweet treats like cake and a brownie that I ate during the two weeks. Maybe that's to be expected, but, without an expert to explain the data, I didn't know.\n\nOn reflection, I underestimated how complicated it would be to decipher this data and apply it to my life healthily. My glucose levels fluctuated more than I expected and it wasn't always clear to me why.\n\nThe app did explain that a healthy person's blood sugar tends to be outside of the healthy range for up to two hours per day, but I wasn't sure if an unsteady line within the safe zone was worrying or not (a nutrition researcher I spoke to since reassured me that it is not).\n\nIn terms of my energy levels, I noticed that I felt better on weekdays when I ate three square meals a day around the same time than weekends, when I tended to skip breakfast and eat a big meal around 2 or 3 p.m. This was reflected in my blood sugar levels, but I'm not sure I needed a CGM to figure that out.\n\nThe urge to check how my body reacted to food after a few bites quickly became a compulsion. Even though I understood a spike wasn't necessarily bad, I still felt encouraged by the app to keep my line as straight as possible.\n\nIt set me a daily target to stay within, at first based on averages and after a week based on my levels. It would tell me to do 15 squats, five to 10 minutes of calf raises, or take a brisk walk, when my glucose started rising (research suggests these movements can bring it down). I tried to go on walks, and did the squats on two occasions, but I drew the line at 10 minutes of calf raises.\n\nThe app was purportedly helping me to make my diet even healthier, but I became hyperfixated on a single metric that I didn't really understand.\n\nI felt a pang of dread every time I ate, knowing my glucose levels would rise and the app would watch and prescribe me exercise like some kind of punishment. It felt like the only way to keep my glucose stable would be to unnecessarily overhaul my already healthy diet.\n\nI intended to spend the second half of the experiment trying to avoid spikes and observing if I felt more alert and focused. That was before I realized that optimizing your health means aiming for constantly shifting goal posts. Once you perfect one metric, you simply move onto the next.\n\nHaving too many blood sugar spikes over time can increase the risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and heart disease. But diabetes experts previously told Business Insider that glucose monitoring isn't necessary for people without the disease and that it can cause unnecessary anxiety.\n\nIt's possible that cutting out all refined sugar and eating plainer, simpler meals would help me focus a little better. But I already track my sleep, go for a daily lunchtime walk, do a weekly run, eat 30 plants a week, and stop drinking caffeine after 1 p.m, in the name of my health.\n\nMaybe it was the invasive nature of sleeping with a needle in my arm, or the Black Mirror-ness of my phone tracking my bloodwork, but I suddenly felt I was on the border between healthy and obsessive. That isn't somewhere I want to be.",

    "fullText": "Hundreds of parents, teens and school districts have claimed social media is intentionally addictive and harmful\n\nSocial media companies will have to answer to a jury – for the first time – for allegations that their products are intentionally addictive and harmful to young users’ mental health. Hundreds of parents, teens and school districts sued Meta, Snap, TikTok and YouTube, leading to a series of landmark trials that began this week. Jury selection in the first case started on Tuesday in Los Angeles court.\n\nMeta’s Mark Zuckerberg is among the big tech CEOs who are expected to testify. Both sides are likely to bring in experts to hash out the science behind alleged addiction to social media.\n\nThe initial trial involves a 20-year-old, identified by the initials KGM, who alleges she experienced physical and emotional harm after becoming addicted to social media at age 10. This case is expected to last six to eight weeks, and will be the first of about 22 “bellwether” trials. The outcome can signal, and influence, how courts and juries may handle similar lawsuits in the future. Snap and TikTok have settled with the plaintiff in the first case, leaving Meta and YouTube to stand trial.\n\n“Everybody’s looking at it as a data point,” said Benjamin Zipursky, a law professor at Fordham University.\n\nThe legal proceedings follow years of heated criticism of tech companies from angry parents; they blame social networks for causing eating disorders, suicidal thoughts and anxiety in their children. The companies lay blame on the victims, plaintiffs’ lawyers and supporters say: “The tech companies blame parents for not being good parents,” said Sacha Haworth, executive director of the Tech Oversight Project, which has been involved in advocacy work for the plaintiffs. “Their experience has shown that you can be the best parent in the world – you can have conversations, you can limit screen time, you can turn on the bullshit parental controls – and your kid still dies.”\n\nThe cases and future settlements could eventually change the way social media platforms work; plaintiffs are asking for money, as well as injunctive relief that would establish industry-wide safety standards. Legislators around the world are watching; many are trying to impose liability on tech companies in a similar way as the plaintiffs. So even if juries declare the defendants aren’t liable in these cases, lawmakers will be taking notes–and adapting their own strategies, says Eric Goldman, a professor at the Santa Clara University school of law. Some have already enacted laws that align with the plaintiff’s claims.\n\nThere’s more at stake now, legal experts say. “Bad press about how some members of Congress embarrass Zuckerberg is one thing,” Zipursky added. Changing the architecture of a social network may be another entirely.\n\nPlaintiffs want to know: how much did tech companies know about the alleged harm caused by their products, and to what extent did they fail to warn users? They take particular issue with design features such as infinite scroll, autoplay and content curated by algorithms, accusing social media companies of prioritising engagement over wellbeing. Their legal strategy has brought up comparisons with those used against tobacco companies in the 1990s.\n\nThe trial will explore what social media addiction consists of. Tech companies have questioned the scientific link between their platforms and addiction. They also highlight various safety features and parental controls they adopted in recent years. Even if this harm exists, they argue, it’s a result of problematic content, as opposed to a poorly designed system. In doing so, the companies have often relied on a federal law that shields them from liability for third-party content on their platforms: section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. That defense hasn’t worked so far in this case, given the plaintiffs’ novel argument.\n\n“[Plaintiffs] have reconfigured it to say, look: the wrongful thing Meta is doing is running its whole platform in such a way that people get addicted,” Zipursky said. A key issue will be whether plaintiffs can prove the tech companies were wrongfully taking harmful risks, Zipursky added. Moreover, if the plaintiffs can prove that tech companies knowingly and intentionally caused harm, it will be easier to get punitive damages.\n\nSocial media addiction is not included in the latest edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the authoritative handbook for mental health treatment. Scientists have, however, catalogued compulsive use with severe consequences among young people, and legislators across the world are engaged in heated debate over its addictive potential and how to respond.\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, YouTube CEO Neal Mohan and Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri are expected to testify in the initial trial. Snap and TikTok reached a settlement in that case but are still defendants in other suits in the state-level trial.\n\nA Meta spokesperson said in an emailed comment that they strongly disagree with these allegations, and stressed that they have listened to parents and worked with experts and law enforcement to address safety issues. The company also cited the introduction of teen accounts, with additional protections.\n\nGoogle spokesperson José Castañeda called allegations in the lawsuits “simply not true”, and emphasized that the company had prioritized providing a safe and healthy experience for young people. Snap commented only on the first bellwether trial, saying they were “pleased to have been able to resolve this matter in an amicable manner”. TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nWhile much of the cases is yet to play out, some unsealed evidence has already drawn criticism of tech companies. That includes allegations that an Instagram employee compared the app to a drug, and that another suggested: “lol, we’re basically pushers.” A Meta spokesperson previously told Politico that the plaintiffs’ allegations relied on “cherry-picked quotes and misinformed opinions in an attempt to present a deliberately misleading picture”.\n\nThe 20-year-old at the center of the initial trial started using social media around age 10, even as her mother tried to stop her from using the apps. She “developed a compulsion to engage with those products nonstop” as a result of their “addictive design” and “constant notifications”, the complaint notes, according to NPR.\n\nLegal experts expect all of these cases will eventually be appealed if they don’t reach a settlement, and there’s no certainty about outcomes until appellate courts have weighed in. They expect tech companies to raise several issues, including whether the Communications Decency Act or first amendment applies, as well as potential disputes over causation and expert testimony. “None of these companies are going to feel that they need to change what they do,” Zipursky said.\n\nStill, juries’ verdicts in the early cases can affect how much companies may pay out. “The jury might signal they’re completely persuaded by the plaintiff’s arguments,” Goldman said. “Then, if there’s any settlement, the price tag will go up substantially.”",

    "fullText": "The start of a new year always brings new exercise routines — or at least the intentions to start them.\n\nIf you're anything like me, though, you might need a little encouragement and inspiration to get going.\n\nSo Business Insider spoke with successful women who make time for fitness regimens each week. They shared the workouts they love, and the gym essentials they swear by.\n\nJanel Barden, 27, is a cofounder of the talent and marketing agency LuxeHaus Management.\n\nIdeally, she likes to exercise between three and five times a week. When her schedule is extra busy, though, she uses a simple piece of equipment to enhance shorter exercises: $65 Bala Bangles.\n\nEach bracelet weighs two pounds and attaches with elastic straps.\n\n\"I love wearing them on walks, and when I'm at home doing a five to 10-minute arm workout I found on YouTube,\" Barden said.\n\nBarden uses ClassPass to vary her workouts. Sometimes, she does Pilates. Other times, she visits the gym, and most recently, she started working with a personal trainer.\n\nNo matter the workout, she's almost always wearing Alo Yoga clothes. She said its pieces are cute and comfortable.\n\nBarden specifically loves the brand's $138 sweatpants and $148 quarter-zip pullover from its Accolade collection, as well as the $78 bra and $134 leggings from its Airlift line.\n\nOccasionally, though, she'll swap her Alo pants for Lululemon's $108 Align leggings.\n\nVictoria Villanueva, 25, cofounded LuxeHaus Management with Barden. She said that exercise is vital to staying active and boosting her mental health while working from home.\n\n\"I've been really into bike riding lately,\" she said. \"I used to go all the time with my dad when I was little, and getting back into it now as an adult is healing something inside me. It's better than taking walks.\"\n\nTo hydrate before and after those rides, she relies on her $40 Stanley 1913 tumbler.\n\nVillanueva told Business Insider that her exercise wardrobe includes a mix of Halara leggings, Fabletics sets, and one accessory: the $349 Ultrahuman Ring Air in bionic gold.\n\n\"It's a dupe for the Oura Ring, but you don't have to pay for a monthly subscription,\" she said.\n\nIt helps her track her steps, heart rate, sleep, and more.\n\nSabrina Guler is the 32-year-old founder of Intuitive CEO, an advisory studio that helps new brands grow and raise capital.\n\nHer exercise regimen starts before she really gets moving each day.\n\n\"Drinking electrolytes before coffee every morning has completely changed my energy levels and hydration,\" she said. \"I avoid sugar-based options and use Ultima electrolytes.\"\n\nThe brand sells packets in sets for around $20.99 per bag.\n\n\"My 45-minute morning walk helps with insulin regulation, cortisol balance, and mental clarity,\" Guler told Business Insider. \"Hormones are everything.\"\n\nThe specific clothing pieces she wears on those walks might vary, but the brands don't.\n\n\"If I want to be seen and look cute, I am wearing Alo Yoga,\" she said. \"If I want to be comfortable, Lululemon has functional pieces. The butter-soft leggings still have me in a chokehold years later.\"\n\nNikki Seaman, 30, is the founder and CEO of Freestyle Snacks. Her brand, which recently appeared on \"Shark Tank,\" offers premium olives and pickles in to-go pouches.\n\n\"I do strength training two or three times a week, and I try to walk outside on the other days,\" she told Business Insider. \"I started strength training after my first son was born, and it has totally changed me physically and mentally.\"\n\nDuring those workouts, she wears $110 performance joggers from Vuori and $155 Clifton 10 sneakers from Hoka.\n\nShe described both as comfortable, durable, and easy to throw on before heading outside.",

    "description": "Ant’s health chatbot has become a top downloaded app in China as users seek personalized care they can’t get from the overburdened hospitals.",
    "fullText": "Ant Group, Alibaba’s fintech affiliate and parent of China’s ubiquitous payment app Alipay, is racing to lead the country’s digital health market with a chatbot designed to be a wellness companion.\n\nIts app, Ant Afu, uses artificial intelligence and agentic capabilities to answer health-related questions, suggest hospital appointments, analyze test results, and remind users to exercise or take medication. First created in June under the name AQ, it had recorded 30 million monthly active users by January, with more than half of them living in small cities, according to Ant Group’s chief executive Han Xinyi.\n\nInternet users have increasingly turned to AI for everyday health questions and companionship, especially in markets where access to physicians is limited. Despite concerns about patient safety and data privacy, products like Ant Afu are widely embraced in China as consumers seek more personalized, round-the-clock health support.\n\nChina’s primary care system is underdeveloped. Most people seek treatment for everything from the flu to cancer at sprawling, overcrowded public hospitals that are concentrated in big cities. Patients often complain of long wait times, short consultations, and poor bedside manner of exhausted clinicians.\n\nThis demand for better care, combined with a fast-aging population, has created a fertile ground for digital health products that can spare people the burden of visiting hospitals. Tech companies including JD.com, ByteDance, and Baidu have all built online medical consultation tools, and more recently, chatbots branded as AI doctors.\n\nAnt has a unique advantage as Alipay has long hosted the appointment and payment systems for many hospitals. Millions of people access their national medical insurance accounts through Alipay. In January 2025, Ant acquired Haodf, a leading online consultation portal with more than 300,000 registered physicians.\n\nIn the U.S., AI companies are also expanding their health-care offerings, but they do not yet offer direct access to the country’s large number of private providers and insurers. This month, both OpenAI and Anthropic announced tools targeting consumers, health-care providers, and clinical researchers. Both ChatGPT and Claude now offer features that analyze users’ medical reports and fitness data.\n\nAmong its domestic rivals, Ant’s extensive partnerships with regulators, hospitals, and doctors give it an edge in the AI health-care race, Ivy Yang, a China tech analyst and founder of New York-based consulting firm Wavelet Strategy, told Rest of World. On Ant Afu, users can ask health-related questions, book online consultations and offline appointments at major hospitals, and get reimbursed by state or commercial insurance.\n\n“For startups, the bureaucratic red tape and initial investment required to build the platform, be compliant with all health-care data [regulations], and deal with various government agencies seem like too big a hurdle to overcome,” Yang said.\n\nAnt’s foray into health care has been endorsed by its billionaire founder Jack Ma. He came up with the name Afu, because it made the chatbot sound like a friend, chief executive Han told Chinese tech outlet Latepost this month. “He really cares about whether or not Afu can be like an AI friend that offers emotional companionship and humane care,” Han said, “rather than being just a tool for solving professional problems.”\n\nMa hopes to one day launch the app in underdeveloped parts of Africa and Southeast Asia, Han said.\n\nAnt has spent tens of millions of dollars marketing Afu in China, according to Han. Ant Afu ads have popped up in subway stations, on social media feeds, inside public restrooms, and have been painted on walls in rural China, according to photos shared online. By the end of January, Ant Afu ranked among the top ten most-downloaded iOS apps in China, according to Sensor Tower data.\n\nThe expanding role of AI in patient care, a largely unregulated area, has also prompted warnings about misinformation around the world.  A recent investigation by The Guardian found that Google’s AI summaries were giving out inaccurate health advice. Academics have also found AI diagnostic tools to harbor racial or socioeconomic biases.",

    "fullText": "A serious health threat has been spreading in Pennsylvania, according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, and shifting weather patterns may be a contributing factor.\n\nCases of anaplasmosis went up over 50% in Allegheny County in 2025. U.S. states, including Wisconsin and California, have also seen jumps in the tick-borne bacterial infection.\n\nAnaplasmosis is routinely transmitted alongside Lyme disease via tick bites. Initial symptoms of infection include fever, fatigue, and nausea. When left untreated, it can have longer-term consequences.\n\n\"I really can't commit a lot to doing what I used to,\" Janine Hauck told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette in late December. Hauck contracted anaplasmosis in 2019 and has since suffered from chronic fatigue, impacting her ability to hike, bike, swim, and engage in the outdoor activities she loves. \"It's changed my life.\"\n\nA major contributor to the increase in anaplasmosis infections is the expanded population and habitat of disease-carrying ticks. Warmer, wetter weather patterns, exacerbated in part by atmospheric pollution, have provided prime conditions for ticks to reproduce.\n\nThis phenomenon has exacerbated the spread of other vector-borne illnesses, including dengue virus and West Nile virus.\n\nAnaplasmosis can be treated with antibiotics if detected early. For this reason, officials recommend regularly checking for tick bites after spending time outdoors. Seeking medical attention soon after a tick bite can help support recovery.\n\nPreventing tick bites in the first place is possible by wearing adequately long clothing and using effective repellents. Hauck told the Post-Gazette that the precautions are worth the hassle.\n\n\"People don't get how bad a tick bite could affect your life,\" she told the paper. \"I probably spent over $60,000 trying to get better. I'm lucky I have [the money], but not everyone does.\"\n\nIn the big picture, attacking the root of the problem may also require reducing emissions as much as possible in order to mitigate increasingly warm, wet weather and to shrink tick habitats and activity.\n\nDo you worry about having toxic forever chemicals in your home?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": "\"The point is, go to the doctors for a check-up or if something is not right. It might save your life.\"",
    "fullText": "\"Last year, after four years of hell, some new extreme symptoms popped up, like shortness of breath and joint pain. A few exams and lots more bloodwork later — wham, bam, thank you ma'am — it was undiagnosed LUPUS this whole time. I've now been on treatment for four months. Always, always, ALWAYS listen to your body above anyone else!\"\n\n\"When I couldn't step out of the shower without completely losing my breath, I finally went to the ER. I was diagnosed with what the docs called the largest deep vein thrombosis (blood clot in my thigh) they had ever seen. A piece of it had migrated to my lung, creating a huge saddle pulmonary embolism.\n\nI spent four days in the ICU and underwent two separate stent procedures to get the clots dissolved. Took about six months to get back to full capacity.\n\nIn my defense, I didn't know leg pain was a symptom of a blood clot, but I shouldn't have let it go on for so long.\"\n\n\"Also can be a sign of kidney disease.\"\n\n\"Ignored this for over two years and eventually ended up in the hospital with kidney failure.\"\n\n—Anonymous, 57, Female, California\n\n—Anonymous, 20, Nonbinary, North Carolina\n\n\"I went to the emergency room the week before I was supposed to return to work from maternity leave. The ER doctor told me my blood pressure was up, but to just go to my primary and sent me on my way. I made an appointment with my primary, and she told me I went through a lot having a baby, and my body is just adjusting.\"\n\n\"I spent three days in the hospital being treated as my heart was only at 15% functionality. My poor husband was distraught, he almost lost his partner, and was sad because he couldn't spend the days with me, instead having to care for my infant. It was scary. Thankfully, I have recovered, but I will spend the rest of my life taking lots of medicine to keep my heart healthy. What I learned is to listen to your body. If something feels wrong, it very well may be, and losing your life isn't worth being afraid to go to the doctor.\"\n\n\"By the time he was willing to share this with me, and we went to a doctor who treated his illness, my husband had between 6-18 months left to live. He delayed his treatment because he thought his 'persona' would be destroyed. He became more verbal and the loving man I recalled after taking his medication. He was a better man… until he was no longer alive. He died at 67. Men, check your PSA count. Save your lives not only for yourselves, but also for those who love you.\"\n\n\"Turns out I was so severely anemic, the breathlessness and coughing weren't from asthma or bronchitis or allergies, but it was from severe anemia for many years, indicating possible heart failure. After an iron supplement and an IUD to slow heavy menstrual bleeding, I haven't had to use an inhaler or asthma medicine in almost seven years. Get your iron levels checked often if you are a female in your 30s and 40s; it can literally make your heart fail.\"\n\n—Anonymous, 47, Female, North Carolina\n\n\"The poor ER doctor lady was so nice, but I was so embarrassed. Like, she literally stuck her hand up my ass. I genuinely felt like I was in John Mulaney's skit about trying to get Xanax and ending up getting a prostate exam because he said he was lying to get prescribed drugs. Unfortunately, because I waited, it's mostly pain management now. Pay attention to rectal issues and eat your fiber! I wanna die writing this. I'm so glad it's anon.\"\n\n—Anonymous, 25, Female, Seattle, Washington\n\n\"Two surgeries, a long hospital stay, followed by a home nurse aid daily to administer intravenous antibiotics and clean the 3-inch section of flesh removed, which had to remain open for weeks for the tendons to heal. You could see my bone and all the other inside things. I have a wicked scar from it.\"\n\n—Anonymous, 63, Female, New Jersey\n\n\"I had open heart surgery soon after, and they were able to remove it. I'll be on medication forever and need to see a specialist twice a year. Had my wife not told me to go to the doctors, I'd be dead by now. This is definitely the short version of my story, but the point is, go to the doctors for a check-up or if something is not right. It might save your life.\"\n\n—Anonymous, 42, Male, Atlanta, Georgia\n\n\"Right before my 33rd birthday, my father passed, and a month before, I had gotten a divorce. So when my period came on and didn't stop after 15 days, I figured maybe my hormones were messed up since I was going through a lot emotionally. I didn't think too much about it — it'll stop eventually, I told myself. That was June of 2025; by August, I was still bleeding. It never stopped. I finally dragged myself into the doctor's office. I was in pain, I was anemic, and I showed up with photos where it looked like I was passing pure flesh the size of my hand. Something had to give.\"\n\n\"I finally got my second opinion four months later. I have endometrial cancer, and I am going to have a total hysterectomy at 33 years old next week. I'm not happy, but it's easier to process knowing what the problem is. And I can't help but wonder if someone had listened to me for all the years I was complaining, if maybe there could have been a treatment for my endometriosis before it turned cancerous.\n\nSo no, a normal cycle should not be 10-15 days per month. No, you should not feel like you are giving birth every month (cramping is normal, but it should not be so severe that you can't walk). If you are bleeding so much you have to resort to wearing a diaper — that's not normal. And if the doctor won't listen to you, make them. Don't wait until you are so anemic you need a transfusion (also not normal), and if you have every single symptom and they tell you the imaging is normal — make them get you a second opinion. Being a woman is hard, but it doesn't mean suffering in silence. Speak up.\"\n\n—Anonymous, 33, Female, Alabama\n\nAlso in Goodful: If You Can Complete More Than 15 Of These Common Phrases, Your Vocabulary Is Better Than 95% Of People’s\n\nAlso in Goodful: \"I Knew Instantly That He Would Be Dead Soon\": Doctors Are Sharing The Biggest Health Issues Patients Ignored Until It Was Too Late, And Whew, I've Been Warned\n\nAlso in Goodful: My Husband And I Separated.

Victor Manuel Diaz, 36, was found by guards on Jan. 14 in a room at Camp East Montana in El Paso, Texas, after he tried to die by suicide, a camp official reported on a 911 call obtained by The Associated Press through a public information request.  “They were doing rounds and they just found him with his pants tied up to his neck, I believe,” said the caller, who identified himself as a health administrator named Luis Gonzalez.",
    "fullText": "Victor Manuel Diaz, 36, was found by guards on Jan. 14 in a room at Camp East Montana in El Paso, Texas, after he tried to die by suicide, a camp official reported on a 911 call obtained by The Associated Press through a public information request.\n\n“They were doing rounds and they just found him with his pants tied up to his neck, I believe,” said the caller, who identified himself as a health administrator named Luis Gonzalez.\n\nDiaz’s death was at least the third of a detainee housed at Camp East Montana, which opened last year at Fort Bliss to hold 5,000 detainees in the desert near the U.S.-Mexico border. Advocates for detainees have alleged a pattern of violence, abuse and neglect at the camp. One earlier death has been ruled a homicide.\n\nRandall Kallinen, an attorney for Diaz's family, said they are suspicious of the claim that his death was a suicide because he was not depressed and would have been reunited with his mother, two sons and siblings in Nicaragua if he had been deported.\n\n“Even if it is suicide, was there something that happened to him that drove him to suicide?” Kallinen asked. “There still has to be an investigation.”\n\nMessages seeking comment were left with ICE on Wednesday.\n\nGonzalez did not witness Diaz's suicide attempt. A separate report by emergency medical services that was released Wednesday said Diaz was suspected of hanging himself with a bed sheet. Federal authorities have not released the findings of an autopsy, but have said the death was a “presumed suicide.”\n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement picked up Diaz on Jan. 6 as agents fanned out across Minneapolis looking for people who may be in the country illegally. He was then sent to the sprawling Texas tent complex.\n\nDiaz crossed the U.S.-Mexico border in 2024, requested asylum and was released. A judge later ordered his removal after he didn’t show up for an immigration hearing, according to ICE.\n\nRelatives in Nicaragua lost contact with Diaz after he went to work at a suburban restaurant on Jan. 6 and later learned he'd been detained. They received a call on Jan. 15 from ICE saying Diaz was dead. Family members “were in disbelief,” said Carlos Morales, board president of Texas Nicaraguan Community, a nonprofit that helped the family raise money to repatriate Diaz's remains to Nicaragua.\n\nA coalition of groups and a Democratic congresswoman who represents El Paso have called for Camp East Montana to be closed.\n\nSome of those calls came after the Jan. 3 death of 55-year-old Cuba native Geraldo Lunas Campos. A medical examiner has ruled that a homicide, citing physical restraint by guards.\n\nA witness has described guards pinning Lunas Campos to the ground in handcuffs, with one restraining him in a chokehold until he could no longer breathe. ICE has said the guards intervened to try to help Lunas Campos after he attempted suicide, and that he resisted them. A camp official initially told police it was a suicide.\n\nLawyers for the family of Lunas Campos have asked a judge for an emergency order to prevent ICE from deporting detainees who witnessed the struggle.\n\nICE, which oversees the camp, announced Diaz’s death on Jan. 18, saying security staff “found Diaz unconscious and unresponsive in his room.” The agency said he “died of a presumed suicide” but that the cause was still under investigation.\n\nIn addition to Lunas Campos and Diaz, ICE announced that on Dec. 3 an immigrant from Guatemala held in Camp East Montana died after being transferred to a El Paso hospital for care. The agency said Francisco Gaspar-Andres, 48, was suspected to have died of liver and kidney failure.\n\nUnlike with the two prior deaths, Diaz’s body wasn’t sent to the county medical examiner in El Paso for an autopsy. Kallinen said an Armed Forces pathologist conducted the autopsy at Fort Bliss, and that he's been told it could take months for findings to be released.\n\nThe 911 caller in the case told the dispatcher that a team of doctors and nurses were working to try to revive Diaz after his suicide attempt and they needed an ambulance.\n\nParamedics found him laying on his back in a hospital bed without a heartbeat, according to an El Paso Fire Department incident report.\n\nAP reporter Michael Biesecker contributed from Washington.",

    "description": "A former marketing manager explains why leaving corporate life to freelance after having kids led to burnout and mental health struggles.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Katie Bullon of activ Marketing Franchise. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nBefore I got pregnant with my firstborn, I was working in the corporate world as a marketing manager. It was an intense job that I absolutely loved, both as a single person and then as a newly married one. I got to travel the world, quickly advance in my career, and diversify my skill set, but I could only do the job because I didn't yet have kids.\n\nI knew once I started a family, I wouldn't want to continue working in the corporate world full time. I never wanted to be in a position where I had to choose between taking care of my kids and doing my job, so I initially decided to go back to my role part time, thinking that would be a happy medium.\n\nBut after keeping in touch day, a reintroduction to work after maternity leave, when my son was 7 months old, it became clear I couldn't even manage the part time role. To do the job well, to the high standard I expected of myself, I had to give it my everything.\n\nI remember finishing the keeping in touch day, crying in my boss's office, telling her I just couldn't come back. The day had been a reminder of my old life — the life of a young, free, travelling corporate marketer. It was a life I knew I couldn't maintain with a baby in tow, and I mourned the end of my life as a corporate professional.\n\nI quit my job and, after months of deliberation and dreaming, decided to go freelance — I was really excited. Surely, I thought, I would strike a healthy balance of parenting and working if I worked for myself.\n\nThe plan would be to devote all my attention to my son when he was awake, and pull out my laptop to work while he slept.\n\nBut the reality of being self-employed as a new mom was not what I had imagined.\n\nI was running on empty all the time, exhausted from sleepless nights. I didn't know what I was doing with parenting, as I had never done it before, and often felt I was doing it all wrong. I adored my son even more than I had imagined I would, and not being with him while I worked constantly pulled at my heartstrings.\n\nIt was from this state that I then tried to work, attempting to be at clients' full-time disposal. Even though I knew about marketing, I didn't fully take into account the amount of work or the number of non-billable hours I'd be working as a self-employed individual. As opposed to working for a corporate company, I was the sole person responsible for every aspect of the business. It was all on me.\n\nNot keen on putting my son in a day care to save us a bit of money, I tried to build the business with him around most of the time, save for a few hours a week when my mom or sister would have him.\n\nI was on a hamster wheel from the moment I woke up, becoming more and more exhausted as I tried to work as if I didn't have a child, and parent as if I didn't have a job.\n\nThe standards I set for myself as a mother and business owner were unachievable, and I could feel myself starting to burn out as I attempted to do it all.\n\nOnly 20 months after my first son was born, I gave birth to my second son, and I continued trying to balance my own business with parenting, this time with a toddler and newborn in tow.\n\nMy second didn't ever take a bottle, so I frequently sat with him breastfeeding on one side with my laptop set up on the other. I was absolutely determined to do it all, and do it all perfectly.\n\nI suppose part of me wanted to prove people wrong, to show them that I could be a completely present mother while also being an incredibly successful self-starter.\n\nMy mental health crashed. My physical health deteriorated. My relationship with my husband was rocky. I was exhausted all the time and felt like I had hit rock bottom.\n\nIt wasn't what I had expected freelancing to be like, and it most certainly wasn't what I wanted motherhood to be like.\n\nWhile self-employment might seem like the \"easier than corporate path\" for new mothers, it wasn't — not for me.\n\nSomething had to change, so I went back to the drawing board, considering what I could do differently, and joined a marketing franchise. It allowed me to continue doing what I loved, marketing, but I had the back office and a team of people behind me to carry out all the work that had overwhelmed me when I was working on my own.\n\nIf I could go back in time and give myself advice, I would say: You can't do it all, nor should you.\n\nAs a mom, I can't put myself last. I must build my life in a way that prioritizes me; otherwise, I'll burn out repeatedly, which is detrimental to ume, my family, and my work.",

    "description": "Oprah Winfrey's newest book, \"Enough,\" is about her relationship with weight-loss drugs. Since the '90s, she has been combining her health with business.",
    "fullText": "Oprah Winfrey has spent years turning her private health journey into a public conversation — and, at times, a lucrative business.\n\nThe billionaire, real-estate mogul, talk-show host, journalist, actor, and producer has just released her 12th book: \"Enough: Your Health, Your Weight, and What It's Like To Be Free.\"\n\nThe book, which she co-authored with Dr. Ania M. Jastreboff, a doctor and professor at Yale's School of Medicine, dives into the role of GLP-1 drugs to facilitate weight loss.\n\nThe practice is something that Winfrey herself has touted. On CNN in December 2024, she said she had first begun using a GLP-1 before Christmas in 2023.\n\nWinfrey has been combining her personal health and fitness with business for decades, including investing in WeightWatchers (now WW International), writing books about health, identifying exercise and health trends for her show and magazine, and putting her support behind figures like Dr. Mehmet Oz, who is now the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\nWinfrey did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nHere's a timeline of how her health empire has evolved.\n\nDuring a 1988 episode of \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" — a few years after Joan Rivers asked about Winfrey's weight gain — Winfrey wheeled out a red wagon filled with 67 pounds of animal fat.\n\nWhy? To convey to her audience how much weight she'd lost in the last year while on the Optifast liquid diet.\n\nThe episode put a spotlight on medically supervised liquid formula diets. After it aired, The New York Times reported that Winfrey got just 400 calories a day from Optifast and wrote that the ability of people on such diets \"to maintain the loss is questionable and not yet fully evaluated.\"\n\nFor a 2005 issue of O, The Oprah Magazine, Winfrey wrote, \"For four solid months, I didn't eat a single morsel of food,\" and lost 67 pounds. \"What I didn't know was that my metabolism was shot. Two weeks after I returned to real food, I was up 10 pounds.\"\n\nWhile she was proud of losing the weight, Winfrey later regretted the decision to pull the wagon out.\n\n\"When I look at that show, I think it was one of the biggest ego trips of my life,\" Winfrey told Entertainment Tonight in 2011.\n\nShe cowrote \"Make the Connection: Ten Steps to a Better Body and a Better Life\" with exercise physiologist (and her personal trainer) Bob Greene.\n\nThe 10 steps included guidance such as \"exercise 20 to 60 minutes a day,\" \"eat a low-fat, balanced diet,\" and \"eat three meals and two snacks each day.\"\n\nIt went on to become a No. 1 bestseller and is still in circulation.\n\nWinfrey introduced audiences to Phil McGraw, aka Dr. Phil, in the late '90s as her show's resident relationship expert. He proved so popular that Winfrey produced and co-created a spinoff of \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" starring McGraw: \"Dr. Phil.\" It aired from 2002 to 2023, and for most of its run, it was second in ratings only to Winfrey's show.\n\nLike Winfrey, McGraw frequently discussed weight loss and health on his show, and also lent his face and name to nutritional supplements. As The New York Times wrote in 2003, \"Oprah Winfrey has talked about weight loss — hers and everyone else's — for years. Her protégé Dr. Phil has found a way to make money from it.\"\n\nHe's also written his own weight-loss books, including \"The Ultimate Weight Solution: The 7 Keys to Weight Loss Freedom\" and \"The Ultimate Weight Solution Food Guide.\"\n\nWinfrey also introduced Dr. Mehmet Oz to her show's audience. He made his \"Oprah\" debut in 2004 and ultimately appeared more than 60 times, per NPR, before Winfrey greenlit \"The Dr. Oz Show\" in 2009. It aired until 2022, when he began a US Senate campaign in Pennsylvania.\n\nSimilarly, Oz's program featured many segments on weight loss, and Oz himself endorsed multiple \"cures\" for obesity that have been disproven. He was appointed administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services in 2024.\n\nWhile it's not known how much money Winfrey made from their two shows, both aired for over a decade (with reruns on Winfrey's channel, OWN), and Winfrey's production company, Harpo Productions, was involved throughout.\n\nWinfrey's own show, which aired for 25 years, was the foundation of her wealth, rocketing her to millionaire status when it became nationally syndicated in 1986. By 2003, she was a billionaire, and she's now worth an estimated $3.2 billion, Forbes reported.\n\nIn 2015, Winfrey announced she was joining the board of WeightWatchers (now known as WW International, or WW) and was purchasing a 10% stake in the company worth $43 million.\n\nThe New York Times reported in 2015 that it led to an increase of $400 million in market value for the brand, which had been trending downward before Winfrey's involvement.\n\n\"WeightWatchers has given me the tools to begin to make the lasting shift that I and so many of us who are struggling with weight have longed for,\" she said in a statement. \"I believe in the program so much I decided to invest in the company and partner in its evolution.\"\n\nIt's an example of the Oprah Effect: the trend of Winfrey endorsing, supporting, or investing in a brand that leads to a spike in value.\n\nWinfrey posted on X (then Twitter) a video about how she'd lost 26 pounds on WeightWatchers while still eating bread.\n\n\"I love bread,\" she said. \"That's the genius of this program. I lost 26 pounds, and I have eaten bread every single day.\"\n\nAccording to MarketWatch, the subsequent bump in the stock price, just one hour after the post, netted Winfrey around $12 million.\n\nWinfrey's cookbook, which also reached bestseller status, incorporated the WeightWatchers system into its recipes and flagged the number of points each meal was worth, in a neat bit of corporate synergy.\n\nSoon after confirming her use of a GLP-1, Winfrey publicly said she wouldn't be seeking reelection to the board.\n\nThe announcement sent WeightWatchers' stock tumbling 25%. As Business Insider wrote at the time, it seemed like Winfrey was jumping ship from an \"outdated operating system\" in the age of Ozempic and other GLP-1s.\n\nWinfrey's latest book, \"Enough,\" which she cowrote with Dr. Ania M. Jastreboff, was released in January 2026. It details Winfrey's experience with GLP-1s, combined with Jastreboff's expertise.\n\nWinfrey has been promoting her book heavily, including a stop on \"CBS Sunday Morning,\" where she explained how reframing her relationship to obesity and weight has changed her life.\n\n\"I'm not going to, but I could weep right now for all of the many days and nights I've journaled about this being my fault and why can't I conquer this thing?\" she said.\n\n\"There are tools to use that can help you. And I do see [GLP-1s] as a tool,\" she continued.",

    "description": "A functional medicine doctor shared lifestyle habits that can boost metabolic health, such as strength training and getting better sleep.",
    "fullText": "How quickly your body burns fat can sometimes feel out of your control. For Dr. Adam Perlman, it's one of the biggest laments he's heard from patients.\n\n\"I can't tell you how many times I've had patients who have had so much trouble losing weight complain to me that their friends can eat whatever they want and never put weight on,\" Perlman, an integrative and functional medicine doctor and former chief medical officer for Mayo Clinic's integrative medicine program, told Business Insider.\n\nIt's also one of the biggest misconceptions he hears about metabolic health.\n\n\"Your genetics aren't your destiny,\" he said, even if they play a role. \"You can counter a lot of those genetics with the right type of interventions, particularly around lifestyle.\"\n\nLuckily, none of those involve eating less, the other big myth he hears around losing fat. \"Sometimes, if you restrict your diet too much, it really backfires because you go into this sort of scarcity state,\" he added.\n\nWhile he said it's important to speak to a doctor and rule out potential underlying issues of unexplained weight gain, like thyroid function, he said there are a few simple lifestyle changes everyone can make to boost their metabolic health and burn fat faster.\n\nFrom his experience, Perlman has seen people lean on heavy exercise, particularly cardio workouts, to shed fat fast.\n\nWhile aerobic exercise has other health benefits, he said that there isn't great evidence that movement alone will lead to drastic weight loss.\n\nStrength training, however, has its own metabolic benefits. Because muscle is a more metabolically active tissue, having higher muscle mass helps you burn more calories at rest over time.\n\nPerlman said he encourages strength training to his patients and performs a bioelectric scan to measure their body's composition of muscle and fat. He especially emphasizes it to older patients who may be going through hormonal changes, like during menopause, or experiencing a natural decrease in muscle mass.\n\n\"People begin to develop what they perceive as a slowing of metabolism, where part of the issue is that they're not maintaining their muscle mass the way they need to,\" he said. \"Making sure they're getting strength training is particularly Important.\"\n\nPerlman is particularly fascinated by newer science that links a slower metabolism to issues with your gut microbiome.\n\nCertain microbes, like the gut bacterium akkermansia muciniphila, thrive on fiber and polyphenols found in foods like raspberries and artichokes. Their byproducts can signal the body to release hormones that help regulate appetite and blood sugar.\n\nEating lots of ultra-processed foods can disrupt this cycle. But even if you follow the Mediterranean diet, you might still struggle with losing fat due to a lack of variety in your meals, he said.\n\n\"By and large, what you want is to make sure you eat the rainbow,\" he said. \"So a mix of different types of plants, which is really a mix of different types of fibers that the body tends to feed on.\"\n\nA lack of sleep disrupts your hormones, making it harder to lose fat.\n\nWhat's more, even a consistent sleep schedule during the work week won't make up for late nights on the weekend.\n\n\"A lot of people have what's called 'social jet lag,'\" Perlman said, where they go to bed at 10 p.m. on weekdays but 2 a.m. on Saturday nights. \"That really wreaks havoc on your health, on your microbiome, on other aspects of your health as well.\"\n\nFor Perlman, getting better sleep has been the most recent change he's made to boost his own metabolic health.\n\n\"If you came to my home, you'd see that we have blackout shades, I use a new noise machine at night, I turn the temperature down before I go to bed,\" he said. \"Sleep has been one that I've definitely been focused on.\"",

The chain's stock opened 9% higher after it reported its first comparable transaction increase in the US in eight quarters.\n\nEven Niccol himself appears to be getting in on the protein craze. On Wednesday's call, the CEO said that he \"might have started my day with a vanilla protein latte.\"\n\nThe key, he said, is getting the word about the offering to more people.\n\n\"Awareness is still pretty surprisingly low, but the trial and the repeat rates are really, really great — meaning, when someone tries it, we see a high level of repeat, and it has proven to be highly incremental,\" Niccol said. \"So this is one we want to keep doing.\"",

    "description": "Health insurance stocks fell hard Tuesday morning as investors digested a CMS report proposing a lower-than-expected increase to 2027 Medicare Advantage plans.",
    "fullText": "The health insurance sector saw a deep sell-off Tuesday, led by a plunge in UnitedHealth Group (UNH) shares, as the Trump administration proposed a lower-than-expected increase to 2027 Medicare Advantage plans.\n\nIn a report published Monday night by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the administration proposed that payment rates for Medicare Advantage plans (private insurance plans) will rise by just 0.09% in 2027. Analysts were expecting an increase of as much as 6%.\n\nUnitedHealth (UNH) lost nearly 20%, while fellow major insurers Elevance Health (ELV) and CVS (CVS) each shed around 14%.\n\nThe smaller-than-expected proposal comes as margins are already tight for insurers. When UNH reported earnings Tuesday morning, the company said its Medical Care Ratio sat at 89.1%. Other insurers have reported similar rates.\n\nThe MCR is a key metric that measures the percentage of premium revenue spent on medical claims and healthcare services for policy members. In UNH's case, the company uses $0.89 of every dollar the company makes from the premiums it charges customers to pay for medical care.\n\nUnitedHealth has the largest exposure among insurers to Medicare Advantage changes, accounting for roughly 30% of enrollment nationally. Humana (HUM), which comes in second with roughly 17% of national enrollment, also saw shares plunge over 20% on Tuesday.\n\nThe tiny increase for 2027 comes after the insurance got a 5.06% increase for 2026, higher than expected. Final numbers for 2027 are scheduled to be finalized on or before April 6, according to William Blair analysts.\n\nIn a statement released after the CMS report, a spokesperson for the insurance industry group AHIP said that, if the proposal is to be implemented, it \"could result in benefit cuts and higher costs for 35 million seniors and people with disabilities when they renew their Medicare Advantage coverage in October 2026.\"\n\nThe proposal \"represents an additional headwind for the [Medicare Advantage] sector, further pressuring industry fundamentals,\" William Blair analysts wrote in a note to clients published on Tuesday.\n\nUnitedHealth, the country's largest insurer, took a secondary hit Tuesday morning when the company reported fourth quarter and full-year 2025 revenues that came in below expectations.\n\nFourth quarter and full-year revenue came in at $113.2 billion and $447.6 billion, respectively, compared to estimates of $113.7 billion and $447.9 billion. Both fourth quarter and full-year revenues were up 12% against the previous year.",

In comparison, Medicare Advantage payments in 2026 rose 5.06% from 2025.\n\nThe proposed payment increase was well below Wall Street's expectations, with RBC Capital Markets analysts expecting an \"at least a mid-single digit increase.\" The analysts noted that historically, the final payment rate is higher than the initial proposal.\n\nDr. Mehmet Oz, CMS administrator, said the \"proposed payment policies are about making sure Medicare Advantage works better for the people it serves,\" while \"protecting taxpayers from unnecessary spending that is not oriented towards addressing real health needs.\"\n\nThe CMS proposal also includes updates to the Medicare Advantage risk adjustment model, such as excluding diagnosis information not associated with a specific beneficiary encounter.",

Air pollution directly affects the environment and all of the plants, animals, and humans living in it.\n\nOften called the \"silent killer,\" air pollution is one of the biggest health emergencies since tobacco, according to the WHO, contributing to higher risks of everything from respiratory infections and heart disease to asthma and cancer.\n\nAn investigation by the Guardian this year found that 98% of people in Europe were breathing air that breached WHO guidelines.\n\nThe WHO states that this is true for almost all of the global population, with air pollution responsible for 6.7 million premature deaths annually.\n\nOver the years, knowledge has become power in identifying ways we can improve air quality.\n\nThe Clean Air Act requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to regulate and monitor toxic gases released into the atmosphere.\n\nIn recent years, the EPA has taken steps to minimize pollution from large industrial facilities and transportation, two huge contributors to the health crisis we face today.\n\nTransitioning to clean energy, like solar and wind, is vital to reducing air-polluting gases.\n\nSometimes it's hard to know where to start fighting the problem at home, but it's easier than you think.\n\nRecycling, thrifting, and repurposing products are amazing ways to make a difference. You can also purchase an air purifier to cleanse your living space.\n\nSwitching to public transportation and taking walks when possible instead of using gas-powered vehicles are other low-effort ways to help the issue of air pollution. If you're in the market for a new car, think about upgrading to an electric vehicle.\n\n\"The good news is that clean-air policy works,\" Sinkevičius told the Guardian. \"But we need to do better still and bring pollution levels down further.\"\n\nJoin our free newsletter for weekly updates on the coolest innovations improving our lives and saving our planet.",

    "description": "\"At a time when the universe had robbed me — of my husband’s health and companionship, of security, contentment and peace of mind — she offered me a gift.\"",
    "fullText": "Ten minutes after my husband arrived in his hospital room, the space throbbed with doctors, nurses, therapists and technicians. Warnings beeped on machines. White coats huddled and whispered. And then Joel was rushed back out the door, gurney wheels spinning, propelled by a fleet of scrubs in sprint mode.\n\nWe had just returned from the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro. Our next trip would be from Wisconsin to Portland, Oregon, to welcome our first grandchild. But first, Joel elected to have a hip replacement. He counted on it to improve his quality of life.\n\nAlso Read: I Was 21 When My Doctors Told Me I Had A Year To Live. What Happened Next Left Them Stunned.\n\nInstead, a nick from the retractor caused a life-threatening bleed that set off a cascade of catastrophes. Within a few hours, he went from a healthy, active, 63-year-old to an unconscious, life-support-dependent ICU patient. Kidney failure followed, plus an obstructed colon and compartment syndrome — all complications of what should have been a routine procedure.\n\nTo make matters worse, the doctor who ****** up his hip replacement was in charge of fixing the mistake.\n\nI had trusted too much — the doctors, the hospital, the statistics proclaiming hip replacement common and safe.\n\nWhy hadn’t I asked more questions? I thought, berating myself. Why hadn’t I educated myself about the risks? Why hadn’t I asked for the procedure to be done at a larger, regional facility?\n\nAlso Read: My Husband's Medical Team Was Failing Him. Then A Stranger Stepped In And Said 6 Words That Saved His Life.\n\nPrepared for a one- to three-day hospital stay, with a return to normal in six weeks, Joel instead embarked on a monthslong hospitalization with no guaranteed survival. And since he was drugged into incoherence, I made decisions for him. With no medical knowledge and little experience in trauma, surgeries or hospitals, I once again trusted too much.\n\nThe staff invited me to daily briefings, but their terminology confused me, and I missed information because they talked so fast. I wanted to go back in time. I hoped it was all a dream. Still, I tried to memorize their words and repeat each message to our daughters.\n\nThe community hospital’s small cadre of ICU nurses monitored Joel around the clock, checking his breathing tube, supervising dialysis and scheduling multiple surgeries per week. Nurses handed me consent forms with little explanation, assuring me each surgery was essential to remove dead tissue from Joel’s leg. I signed the forms until 90% of his lower leg muscle was gone.\n\nI had so many questions: Why was the doctor who botched the hip replacement now in charge of Joel’s recovery? Why did the lead surgeon disregard the colon specialist’s recommendation to have Joel evaluated elsewhere? Why was there a rotating staff instead of one director in charge of intensive care? And why were two of Joel’s doctors arguing at the central ICU desk?\n\nThat’s when a rabbi came to see me.\n\nAlso Read: I Pursued Motherhood Despite Past Psychosis -- Then This Happened\n\n“You know what they’re arguing about, don’t you?” she said.\n\nShe never asked if we were Jewish (we’re not) or if I needed spiritual guidance.\n\nJust minutes before, a nurse had told me one doctor advocated amputating Joel’s leg; the other disagreed. The argument continued.\n\nWhy only two doctors instead of a larger team? I wondered. Why did they not ask my opinion? Who would make the ultimate decision?\n\nAlso Read: Since I Was A Child, I've Known Things I Had No Way Of Knowing. I Hid My Abilities Out Of Fear — Until Now.\n\n“You can request a different hospital,” she told me calmly, as though she had been reading my thoughts. “You could have your husband transferred.”\n\nThose six words seemed so obvious.\n\nTwenty minutes to the east was a prominent medical facility affiliated with a medical college and staffed with hundreds of doctors, research teams, and state-of-the-art equipment. But in the fuzz of shock and stress, I hadn’t considered this alternative.\n\n“Maybe discuss it with your daughters,” the rabbi said.\n\nAlso Read: I'm A Doctor Who Almost Died Because My Own Doctors Refused To Do This 1 Basic Thing\n\nFor the first time in two weeks, I sensed someone on my side. She had assessed the situation and proposed I abandon the place that employed her. She suggested there was a better place than the one she represented. But more than that, she gave me agency. She assumed I had power even as I felt powerless. She assumed I was fierce even as I felt impotent.\n\nHer suggestion seemed impossible. Doctors, not wives, made decisions.\n\nWould anyone listen to me? I wondered. How would I move a critically ill man who needed minute-by-minute monitoring?\n\nStill, I knew if I didn’t act quickly, my husband’s leg could be gone. He could even lose his life.\n\nI went home, and I made phone calls to that regional hospital. I discovered a team of limb salvage specialists who saved legs instead of amputating them, and I found a doctor to supervise my husband’s case.\n\nAt 7 a.m. the next day, intimidated and fearful, I approached the authority figures I had been taught to trust — the medical professionals who towered from their self-constructed pedestals. I told them I had initiated a transfer and my husband would be leaving their facility.\n\nAll day, I endured delays, waiting for a bed, waiting for approval, waiting for coordination — waiting, waiting, waiting.\n\nAt 10 p.m., Joel was transferred in an ambulance to the larger hospital, where he would spend the next 2 1/2 months.\n\nHe still required surgeries, feeding tubes and dialysis. But now, he had a team of doctors dedicated to saving both limb and life, with resources beyond those in the local hospital. And he had a wife with a voice.\n\nWould I have found my voice without that rabbi? I’m not convinced I would have. But once I initiated change, I intended to do it again.\n\nNot all my requests were heeded. But sometimes, when I pointed out a symptom or insisted on a test, my inquiry led to a new treatment. My husband experienced medical errors in this new hospital too, but he survived. And aside from the leg brace he now wears, the blue handicapped sign on our car and the scar from his temporary colostomy, he is whole.\n\nCompared to the dying man who laid unconscious and immobile, Joel is changed. I’m changed too. Shortly after Joel returned home, I consulted a law firm about a malpractice suit. After almost a year of meetings and investigations, they advised us to abandon the case. Wisconsin had a cap on damages, and the burden was too great to prove negligence.\n\nDespite that disappointment, I still speak up. Now, before every doctor appointment, I compose a list of questions, complaints and possible treatments. When a doctor pooh-poohs a test, I challenge their opinion. When a nurse minimizes a symptom, I repeat my concern. When a result goes unnoticed, I call attention to it. And my advocacy goes beyond medicine. When I appeared in court on a probate issue, I wrote a script for my lawyer with points to make to the judge.\n\nAlthough drugs, surgeries, therapies and hard work saved and rehabilitated my husband, it was a complete stranger who precipitated his move to the proper facility — and very well may have saved his life. Though life often seems impersonal, with virtual meetings instead of face-to-face interactions, texts instead of phone calls and blood tests instead of bedside manner, she made me feel connected to and cared for.\n\nAt a time when the universe had robbed me — of my husband’s health and companionship, of security, contentment and peace of mind — she offered me a gift. Expecting nothing in return, she stood by my side and held me up. She gave me confidence and hope. Her compassion healed and transformed as much as any test or treatment and left me looking for ways to pay her kindness forward.\n\nThis piece originally ran in February 2025 and is being shared again as part of HuffPost Personal’s “Best Of” series.\n\nNancy Jorgensen is a Wisconsin-based writer, educator and collaborative pianist.

    "fullText": "This live blog is refreshed periodically throughout the day with the latest updates from the market.To find the latest Stock Market Today threads, click here.\n\nHappy Monday. This is TheStreet’s Stock Market Today for Jan. 26, 2026. You can follow the latest updates on the market here in our daily live blog.\n\nThe Trump Administration has reportedly proposed keeping reimbursement rates for Medicare plans almost flat year-over-year, much to the detriment of already slammed health insurers like UnitedHealth, Humana, CVS Health, and the like.\n\nThe proposal, first reported in WSJ this evening, says that payments will increase by an average rate of \"0.09%\" in 2027. The reaction after hours has been stark. On news of the report, the aforementioned three firms --- among the largest Medicare Advantage providers --- fell 8.8%, 12.8%, and 9.5% after the bell.\n\nAlthough over half of U.S. equities were in decline today, large caps kept the market on track. The Dow (+0.64%), S&P 500(+0.50%), and Nasdaq (+0.43%) continued a four day winning streak, while the Russell 2000 (-0.36%) suffered modest declines.\n\nTop of mind for most investors were forthcoming earnings and the Fed rate decision due out tomorrow. Earnings alone would have been a sufficient distraction this week, with reports from Apple, Microsoft, Meta, Tesla, and others. However, the Fed is also expected to release its rate decision tomorrow, adding to the busy state of affairs this week.\n\nThrough midday, things have taken a small turn. The Russell 2000 (-0.21%), once leading the pack is now the sole decliner among major indexes. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq (+0.71%) has pulled ahead.\n\nIn their fourth straight winning session, 56.1% (3,103) U.S. issues are now seen declining, but the 41.5% (2,293) lifting the market are putting up quite the fight.\n\nThat said, here are today's midday movers, our daily list of the top and bottom 20 stocks with at least a $2 billion market cap. Here, we aim to capture the biggest stories on markets\n\nUSA Rare Earth (+14.86%) is fetching a bid today after the U.S. government confirmed it would take a 10% stake in the business, making it today's best-performer.\n\nIt's joined by a handful of software companies; DigitalOcean (+12.27%), Pattern Group (+12.06%), Cloudflare (+10.74%), and Zoom Communications (+9.87%) are also putting up a strong performance today after a weak week for software stocks.",

    "description": "\"Your body can’t metabolize it properly.\"",
    "fullText": "Soda is never the beverage of choice when it comes to health, but some types are better than others. If you want to drink Coca-Cola, for example, there are several varieties to choose from, with noticeable differences between them.\n\nContent creator David Céspedes (@dr.davidcespedes) recently shared a video revealing which variety of this iconic soda is the best of the worst, as AS reported.\n\n\"If you're going to drink supermarket Coca-Cola, I'll explain which one you should never touch and which is the least harmful,\" the doctor says in his video.\n\nDiet Coke and Coca-Cola Zero Sugar are the worst, Céspedes reveals.\n\n\"The main problem is aspartame,\" he says, referring to the artificial sweetener used in place of sugar in these diet products. \"Your body can't metabolize it properly, and it disrupts your brain, your gut microbiome, and your overall system.\"\n\nHowever, that doesn't make regular Coca-Cola healthy, as other experts have also highlighted.\n\n\"It's not safe either because it contains high-fructose corn syrup,\" says Céspedes. \"It's a ticking time bomb for your liver. One can has about 36 grams of sugar, enough to spike your blood sugar and increase inflammation.\"\n\nEven the container that the Coke comes in makes a difference. Céspedes points out that the plastic bottles shed microplastics into the soda you drink — the same effect that makes drinking bottled water unhealthy.\n\nCéspedes' position that drinking cola is never good for you has been backed up by experts, as Verywell Health reported. It leads to issues as small as acne breakouts and as large as heart disease.\n\nAll of that is on top of the negative impact of plastic bottles on the planet.\n\nDo you think forever chemicals should be banned from all products?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nIf you can minimize your impact by switching to a similar, healthier product, that's better for you and for the entire world.\n\nUltimately, Céspedes recommends one specific product.\n\n\"If you're going to drink Coke, at least choose glass bottles,\" he says. \"They don't have the plastic lining of cans and usually use cane sugar, which your body handles much better than high-fructose corn syrup. … If you're going to indulge, do it with a glass bottle, in moderation, and knowing exactly what's inside.\"\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "title": "The CEO of a $2 billion healthcare firm only felt rich after he paid off $100K in student loans—but that joy ‘disappeared’ in less than 3 days",
    "description": "Virta Health CEO Sami Inkinen only felt like he “made it” once in 2008, when he was able to pay off $100,000 in debt. He didn’t own a car until he was 37, and is “happy with very little.”",
    "fullText": "When envisioning the CEO of a billion-dollar company, it’s easy to fall victim to the clichés: a well-manicured businessman adorned in designer clothes, jet-setting from one international meeting to the next, a team of assistants in tow. But not every entrepreneur enjoys the spoils of their success with a glitzy lifestyle—some are simply thankful to pay off their student loans.\n\nSerial entrepreneur Sami Inkinen has founded and scaled three different companies—including two unicorns—throughout his 20-year career. While the Virta Health CEO has built wealth thanks to his business success, he isn’t concerned with his net worth. In fact, Inkinen only viewed himself as wealthy when he was able to repay the $100,000 of student debt that was burning a hole in his bank account.\n\n“There’s one moment in my life that I felt rich. And then after that, I’ve never thought of money,” Inkinen tells Fortune. In 2008, three years after Inkinen cofounded real estate search company Trulia, he sold off a batch of secondary shares worth $500,000 pre-tax. “I had enough money to pay all my student debts. I was able to buy whatever I wanted, and it was a very expensive bicycle purchase, [and] furnishing my tiny apartment in San Francisco.”\n\nThe immigrant entrepreneur first made his foray into entrepreneurship with mobile software company Matchem back in 2000 when he was still living in Finland. After two and a half years serving as the cofounder and VP of business development, Inkinen sold the organization for a few million dollars, and uprooted his life in Europe to head to the U.S.\n\nThe Gen X entrepreneur attended Stanford’s MBA program, graduating in 2005 with an advanced business degree and $100,000 of student debt. Consulting giant McKinsey floated him a six-figure job offer, flush with a $10,000 signing bonus. It was a chance for Inkinen to quickly pay off his loans, but he skirted the opportunity and returned to entrepreneurship.\n\nFor the next decade, the entrepreneur helped scale Trulia into an industry staple, before Zillow acquired the company for a whopping $3.5 billion in 2015. Now, Inkinen is 11 years into his third stint as a founder, serving as the CEO of $2 billion healthcare business Virta Health. His student loans are squared away, bills are covered, and housing is fully furnished.\n\nInkinen will always remember the excitement of financial security he felt back in 2008, but stipulates the thrill was fleeting. It’s not in his nature to be “money-driven,” the executive says.\n\n“This feeling of money bringing happiness disappeared in less than two or three days. I was like, ‘Okay, well, it’s nice that I have no debt,’” Inkinen explains. “Money isn’t going to make my life or break it, and it’s not going to bring happiness.”",
