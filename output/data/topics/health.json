    "title": "CES 2026: Withings' Body Scan 2 Is a Smart Scale With Smartwatch Health Features",
    "description": "With sensors on a handle, and a screen to display data, the Body Scan 2 may replace a smartwatch in addition to a smart scale.",
    "fullText": "Withings launched their $600 Body Scan 2 smart scale at CES Unveiled last night—but they're positioning it as a \"longevity station\" rather than a smart scale. The device has a handle in addition to the footplate, which allows for extra sensors, and the new features include things like hypertension notifications that we've previously seen from smartwatches. (Hypertension notifications only just came to the Apple Watch a few months ago.)\n\nI got to see the Body Scan 2 at a CES event but haven't had a chance to use it for myself. According to Withings, the Body Scan 2 can measure \"60+ biomarkers\" that it says are relevant to tracking your health over time. With the caveat that I'm asking the company \n\nSmart scales generally aren't very accurate for data like body fat percentage, or really anything that goes beyond simple body weight. A typical smart scale runs a weak electrical current from one foot to another, measuring the electrical resistance of your lower legs. The Body Scan 2 adds a handle with electrodes, which brings the upper body into the mix. The screen on the handle also allows it to display data like ECG readings or other detailed results. Since the screen is in your hands, you don't have to squint at a display at your feet. (In product photos, the retractable handle sits on top of the footplate, but at yesterday's demo, Withings had the handles mounted on little holders at hand height.\n\nThis setup allows for more detailed data than smart scales can usually measure. For example, a Withings rep told me yesterday that it can measure arterial stiffness by comparing the timing of your pulse in your torso, hands, and feet—the faster blood flows between these areas, the better. The Body Scan 2 uses impedance cardiography, a well-studied technology that can measure several aspects of heart health, and it includes a six-lead ECG. This means you can get ECG data and hypertension notifications—two headline Apple Watch features—without having to wear a watch every day.\n\nThe scale isn't yet available for sale, but Withings estimates that it will be available in the second quarter of this year, pending FDA clearance for some features. The price will be $599.95. Withings already sells a first-generation Body Scan scale, with a handle but with fewer sensors and without a screen on the handle, for $399.95.",

    "description": "In a yearlong interview with Men's Health, Jelly Roll opens up about his struggles with addiction, topping the scales at more than 520 pounds in 2020, and how he's managed to lose half his body weight.",
    "fullText": "Jelly Roll (aka Jason Bradley DeFord) is loving the new life he's worked hard to achieve. The Grammy-nominated country superstar opened up with Men's Health about his weight-loss journey, opening up about some of the startling things he learned at the beginning, and how far he's come.\n\nTopping out at more than 520 pounds (Jelly explained that his scale maxed out there and he could not move it at all, \"so it could have been 560, it could have been 528.\" Jelly said he reached his maximum weight around 2020.\n\nWorking with The Ultimate Human founder Gary Brecka and wellness clinic Ways2Well, Jelly started by getting himself under 500 pounds and assessing where he was. He was also adamant that he didn't want to use GLP-1 drugs to achieve his results, saying, \"I don't want an asterisk next to my name, bubba. I want to show people that this is possible.\"\n\nMen's Health notes that after publication, Jelly did admit to trying these drugs for two weeks before committing himself to achieving his goals without them.\n\nAt the start, he took a full blood panel, and learned some startling results about his insulin levels, \"super high\" and his testosterone levels, super low.\n\n\"When you have an excessive amount of insulin, it forces your body to store fat,\" Ways2Well nurse practitioner Danese Rexroad told Men's Health. \"So switching those receptors and switching what Jelly’s body was signaling with insulin helped him rapidly adjust his insulin resistance. I wasn’t doing a big science experiment. It was just meal timing and eating real foods.\" He was also put on a drug to treat Type 2 diabetes.\n\nHis A1C, which measures sugars in the blood, was so high, Jelly said that \"the first couple of blood panels were like, how are you alive?\"\n\nThe other number that left the singer truly shocked was his T. \"My testosterone level -- and I’m cool to talk about this openly -- was of a preteen boy,\" Jelly told the magazine. \"When I went in there for the test, it was bad. Bad. The world opened up when I seen it on paper. I was like, That’s my testosterone level? I mean, dude, we’re talking a 57.\"\n\nA normal t-level for a man Jelly's age is between 300 ng/dL to 900 ng/dL, while obesity commonly reduces those numbers. But a reduction in testosterone can have a huge impact on a man, and especially when it comes to his romantic life.\n\nJelly went there, talking about struggles in his intimate relationship with Bunnie Xo, with whom he's been married since 2016. \"You can’t get it up without T,\" he said candidly. \"I was married to a smoke show, and I was still struggling.\"\n\nHe said that a team came together to look at the root causes behind his health issues, rather than just give him medications to address the symptoms, though medication is a part of the process. \"I'll be on testosterone replacement therapy probably for the rest of my life,\" Jelly admitted to Men's Health.\n\nNevertheless, what his body could adjust and change for the better, Jelly says has been happening. \"That' was a big part of my journey: wanting to know what's happening within me.\"\n\nFor Jelly, who admitted that food was as much an addiction for him as cocaine and codeine had been during his years in and out of the prison system, he's learned that it's about setting small goals. Every time he'd decide to do everything it takes to lose weight, he'd fail, so he started with just one of those things -- and he recommends that one thing be food.\n\n\"Start there. F--k everything else,\" he said. \"Just commit yourself to 'I'm gonna count every calorie and macro that goes in my mouth.'\"\n\nHe was also clear in learning that he needed to shift his goal. He wasn't trying to lose weight, he was trying to be healthy. That's why the focus on blood panels and knowing what's going on inside. The scale only tells one part of the story.\n\nIn 2021, Jelly hired chef/sports nitritionist Ian Larios, who has worked with some MMA champions. Jelly, a huge fan of MMA, found him through this route and one of the first things he told him was that he wanted to appear on the cover of Men's Health magazines.\n\nIn December 2024, he reiterated this goal, \"to be on the cover of Men's Health in 2026. The magazine has come to mean a lot to him, he explained, because he would read it in jail and be inspired by the stories and transformations within its pages. He wanted his own journey to be told there.\n\nMen's Health followed him for a year, watching his healthy journey throughout 2025 before granting his dream with the first issue of the new year. Along with the dramatic change in his body, the magazine noted that when they returned to visit him in November, he proudly declared that his healthier body is a different man in the bedroom, too.\n\n\"Now it’s a totally different thing. I’m chasing her around the house, you know what I’m saying?,\" he laughed. \"I’m like a teenage kid again! I'm like the Pink Panther: I bust out of every corner. And she opens the cabinet and I go, 'Hi!'\"\n\n\"Dramatically different world,\" he declared. Next up is loose skin removal, which he is planning for sometime this year. The journey continues.",

    "title": "4 Habits to Break If You’re Trying to Lose Visceral Fat",
    "description": "Visceral fat is a hidden health risk, but small lifestyle changes can help reduce it.",
    "fullText": "Reviewed by Dietitian Madeline Peck, RDN, CDN\n\nVisceral fat surrounds the organs and is linked to conditions like type 2 diabetes.\n\nSugary drinks, stress, smoking and poor sleep can all drive visceral fat gain.\n\nLifestyle changes like eating a balanced diet and getting regular exercise can reduce visceral fat.\n\nVisceral fat is a term that often comes up in discussions about health and wellness, and for good reason. Unlike the fat you can pinch just under your skin (subcutaneous fat), visceral fat is the deeper fat stored around the abdominal organs. Higher levels are linked to insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, fatty liver disease and heart disease, per Raksha Shah, M.A., RDN. Visceral fat is more involved in metabolic processes due to its proximity to organs such as our liver, pancreas and intestines, which is why it is more closely associated with poor health outcomes than other kinds of fat. It is also very responsive to lifestyle changes. By understanding what to avoid, you can take effective steps toward reducing visceral fat and improving your overall well-being.\n\nSugar-sweetened  sodas are a top offender when it comes to visceral fat gain. Loaded with added sugar, these drinks provide a surge of calories but fail to help you feel full or provide any nutrients. Because regular sodas are a potent source of added sugar, they can easily lead to excessive sugar consumption. In order to manage this extra sugar, the liver turns it into fat.  Over time, this process facilitates the buildup of visceral fat around your organs. Data has linked routine consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages, like sodas and sweet tea, to higher visceral fat accumulation. Instead of drinking sugary drinks, opt for alternatives like water, unsweetened tea or sparkling water with a splash of fruit juice.\n\nStress is something everyone deals with, but unmanaged, ongoing stress can make it much harder to lose abdominal fat. “Chronic stress doesn’t just affect your mood; it can upset the hormonal balance in your body and lead to more visceral fat accumulation in various areas,” shares Toby Amidor, M.S., RD. Data shows that people with higher stress levels tend to have more visceral fat. When you’re stressed, your body releases more of the hormone cortisol, which has been directly linked to increased abdominal fat storage.\n\nTaking steps to manage stress, such as mindfulness practices, exercise or carving out time for activities you enjoy, can pay off in both your mental well-being and your physical health.\n\nPeople who smoke cigarettes tend to have lower body weights than nonsmokers. But, perhaps surprisingly, they also have more visceral fat. Data suggest that there is a link between prolonged smoking, greater nicotine dependence and increased visceral fat. This connection may be due to the way smoking affects hormones and fat distribution in the body. Nicotine can increase levels of cortisol, a stress hormone that promotes fat storage in the abdominal area. This redistribution of fat can occur even in individuals who appear lean, making smoking a hidden risk factor for visceral fat accumulation.\n\n“Sleep might not be the first thing you think of when it comes to visceral fat, but it plays a role,” says Amidor. A chronic lack of quality sleep can wreak havoc on your hormones, particularly those that regulate appetite and stress. When you are sleep-deprived, your body tends to produce more ghrelin, the “hunger hormone,” and less leptin, the hormone that signals fullness. This hormonal imbalance can lead to increased cravings that result in excess calorie intake, contributing to visceral fat.\n\nPoor sleep also elevates levels of the stress hormone cortisol. Aiming for seven to nine hours of quality sleep per night can help regulate your hormones, manage your appetite and reduce stress, creating a more favorable environment for your body to lose visceral fat. “Establishing a consistent sleep schedule and creating a relaxing bedtime routine can significantly improve your sleep quality and support your health goals,” Amidor advises.\n\nWhile avoiding certain habits is important, incorporating positive ones is just as crucial. The following are some additional strategies for shedding visceral fat and achieving healthy weight loss:\n\nPrioritize Protein: Including a good source of protein with every meal helps you feel full and satisfied, which can reduce overall calorie intake and support muscle maintenance during weight loss.\n\nFill Up on Fiber: Fiber, found in foods like oats, beans and apples, can help reduce visceral fat by slowing digestion and promoting feelings of fullness.\n\nRegular Exercise: A combination of moderate-intensity cardio (like brisk walking or cycling) and strength training may help reduce visceral fat and improve your overall metabolic health.\n\nVisceral fat may be hidden from view, but its impact on your health is anything but invisible. Because it is more metabolically active than other forms of fat, visceral adipose tissue can increase the risk of developing chronic conditions such as diabetes and heart disease. The good news? You can manage visceral fat with just a few lifestyle changes. By making mindful choices like swapping soda for sparkling water, managing stress, quitting smoking, prioritizing sleep, embracing a balanced diet and getting regular exercise, you can take meaningful steps to reduce visceral fat and improve your overall health.",

    "fullText": "Moral injury—psychological harm incurred from committing, witnessing, or being subject to actions that violate one’s moral code—has officially been recognized by the American Psychiatric Association (APA), thanks to research led by Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. The APA included “moral problem” in the newest version of its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), the handbook for classifying and diagnosing mental health conditions used by U.S. mental health care providers.\n\nIn a Sept. 16 Psychology Today article, Tyler VanderWeele, John L. Loeb and Frances Lehman Loeb Professor of Epidemiology and director of the Human Flourishing Program at Harvard (HFH), and Jennifer Wortham, a research associate at HFH, described their research on moral injury and subsequent work with the APA.\n\n“Over the past several years, [HFH has] been trying to develop a more unified approach to moral injury and to moral distress that would be applicable to perpetrators, witnesses, and victims,” they wrote. “After months of synthesis of prior work, we defined ‘moral distress’ as ‘distress that arises because personal experience disrupts or threatens: (a) one’s sense of the goodness of oneself, of others, of institutions, or of what are understood to be higher powers, or (b) one’s beliefs or intuitions about right and wrong, or good and evil.’ When that distress became sufficiently persistent it would constitute ‘moral injury.’”\n\nVanderWeele and Wortham introduced this definition, and the research behind it, in a March 4 Frontiers in Psychology study. The study sparked collaboration with the APA to ensure that moral injury was incorporated into the DSM.\n\n“Our hope is that [inclusion in the DSM] opens important opportunities for awareness and treatment of moral trauma, moral distress, and moral injury,” VanderWeele and Wortham wrote in the Psychology Today article. “If we are to truly provide person-centered care, the very real possibility of moral distress and moral injury needs to be acknowledged. The present recognition within psychiatry is a step forward in this regard.”\n\nRead the study: Moral trauma, moral distress, moral injury, and moral injury disorder: definitions and assessments\n\nRead the Psychology Today article: The Importance of Recognizing Moral Trauma in Clinical Care\n\nRead an HFH press release: DSM recognizes moral injury, thanks to Human Flourishing Program research\n\nMedia Relations Manager in the Office of Communications",

    "fullText": "Many people start the new year thinking about ways to improve their health, be more organized and manage their finances. Experts say there is one area that touches on each of those resolutions — home care.\n\nEarly and routine home maintenance goes beyond fixing visible damage. It helps ensure a healthy living environment, extends the life of a home and can protect its long-term value, according to real estate professionals. Planning ahead for regular upkeep and for unexpected emergencies can reduce the risk of costly repairs later and help spread expenses more evenly throughout the year.\n\nAccording to research by the U.S. Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency, about three-quarters of existing homes are expected to still be in use in 2050.\n\n“Maintaining the homes that we have is really essential to protecting our health and our well-being,” said Amanda Reddy, executive director of the National Center for Healthy Housing, an organization that researches and advocates for reducing housing-related health disparities.\n\nDespite who owns the property, Reddy says, keeping residences dry, clean, pest-free, well-ventilated and safe is the goal, which can mean different types of maintenance depending on the type of home, where someone lives and the time of year. Here's what experts say about home care and what tasks to put on the checklist this year:\n\nHome care includes the big projects and the everyday decisions\n\nOn average, Americans spend about 90% of their time indoors, 70% of that time inside of a residence, according to the National Human Activity Pattern Survey.\n\n“It's not just that we spend time indoors, but at home. If you are older, very young, have health concerns, or work from home, it is likely more than that,” Reddy said, emphasizing the reason why home care is a valuable investment.\n\nWhat many people think of maintenance includes addressing water and gas leaks, pest infestations, cracks and other major repairs, but home builders say not everything needs a professional and can include actions as simple as wiping counters and sweeping floors of food debris, opening windows for better ventilation or clearing out clogged filters and drains.\n\nResidents should also consider the needs of those living in the home, commonly used spaces such as kitchens, bathrooms and bedrooms, and typically neglected areas like attics and basements. Reddy says “anywhere we’re spending time” or often ignoring and possibly missing necessary repairs should be prioritized.\n\n“At the end of the day, doing any preventative maintenance at all matters more than doing it perfectly or at exactly the right time,” Reddy said. “But timing can make a big difference. A lot of these tasks are seasonal or annual, and you’re not just going to do it one time. Homes are stressed differently by different times of the year, so seasonal maintenance helps us catch problems before they’re made worse by environmental stressors.”\n\nSeasonal maintenance to plan for throughout the year\n\nWhen it comes to maintenance, planning and preparing for anticipated and routine changes in the environment can help mitigate natural wear and tear on the exterior of homes and also create healthy conditions inside — where most people shelter from extreme weather events.\n\n“What happens outside the house rarely stays outside the house. What’s outside gets inside, what’s inside builds up,\" Reddy said, adding that fluctuating outdoor conditions put stress on appliances and systems at different times of the year. “For most people, the seasonal rhythm not only makes sense because of those stressors, it also just is more realistic and effective than trying to tackle a long, overwhelming checklist all at once.\"\n\nFor example, experts say the best time to prepare for cold and wet climate, storms and other natural disasters is to address concerns before temperatures drop. Similarly, it is recommended that residents address systems in homes that work to reduce the effects of extreme high temperatures, dry and drought conditions and associated risks like wildfires and air quality in the offseason.\n\nProfessional guidance from home inspectors, builders and real estate agents says spring and summer tasks should focus on preparing for warmer weather. Experts recommend checking air conditioning systems, cleaning dryer vents to prevent fire hazards, testing sprinkler systems, tending to gardens and plants around homes' exterior and inspecting appliances, electrical equipment and plumbing fixtures. Experts also say spring is a good time to clean and do any house projects that involve painting or remodeling since rain is unlikely to cause delays during that time.\n\nIn the fall and winter months, experts suggest focusing on temperature control and air quality measures as people tend to shelter indoors during incoming colder weather. American Home Inspectors Training guidance says check heating systems, clean air filters, make sure carbon monoxide detectors are working, seal air leaks, prioritize pest control, clean and repair roofs and chimneys, and inspecting drainage options in and around homes.",

Louise Thomas, Ph.D., professor of metabolic imaging at the University of Westminster’s School of Life Sciences.\n\nOlder Americans Are Quitting Glp-1 Weight Loss Drugs For 4 Key Reasons\n\nThe researchers analyzed more than 61,000 MRI scans from a large UK health database to better understand the muscle’s structure.\n\nThe data also included the participants’ physical measurements, demographics, disease biomarkers, medical history and lifestyle habits. The researchers studied how these variables were linked to muscle shape over time.\n\n\"People with higher fitness, as measured by vigorous physical activity and hand grip strength, had a greater gluteus maximus shape, while aging, frailty and long sitting times were linked to muscle thinning,\" study co-author Marjola Thanaj, Ph.D., a senior research fellow at the University of Westminster’s Research Centre for Optimal Health, said in the release.\n\n5 Fitness Trends That Went Viral In 2025 – Experts Weigh Hype Vs Results\n\nThe researchers concluded that butt shape changes may indicate an \"early functional decline\" and \"metabolic compromise\" in type 2 diabetes patients.\n\nClick Here For More Health Stories\n\nMen with type 2 diabetes showed muscle shrinkage, while women displayed enlarged muscle, likely due to \"infiltration of fat\" within it, according to the researchers.\n\nThese results suggest that men and women have \"very different biological responses to the same disease,\" Thanaj suggested.\n\nMen who were categorized as \"frail\" were recognized as having more \"general shrinkage\" across the gluteus maximus, but women experienced a \"limited\" frailty effect.\n\nStrengthening the glutes is an \"investment in long-term health,\" according to Tanya Becker, co-founder of Physique 57 in New York City.\n\n\"While full-body strength training is essential, focusing on your glutes — the largest muscle group in your body — deserves special attention,\" she told Fox News Digital.\n\nBecker refers to the glutes as the body’s \"shock absorbers,\" because they protect the lower back, knees and hips from taking on stress they weren’t designed to handle.\n\nLarger muscle groups also burn more calories and help regulate blood sugar, the expert added, noting that muscles are often referred to as the \"organ of longevity.\"\n\nStrengthening the glutes also helps to protect the lower back, hips and knees, and also improves posture and balance, reducing the risk of falls and improving mobility.\n\nBecker recommends traditional weighted exercises like squats, lunges and bridges, although they are not suited for everyone, especially older adults with injuries and joint pain.\n\n\"Pilates and barre classes offer bodyweight exercises that are ideal for beginners or individuals with physical limitations,\" she suggested. \"They can be done anytime, anywhere, making them accessible for beginners before progressing to weighted versions.\"\n\nBecker shared the following three glute exercises that improve hip mobility, stability and overall strength.\n\nStart on the hands and knees, engage your core, and lift one leg off the floor (bent or straight). Pulse up and down a few inches for 30 to 60 seconds, then repeat on the other leg.\n\nLie on your side with knees bent at 90 degrees in front of you. Lift your top knee away from your bottom knee, then lower slowly.\n\nFor an increased challenge, lift both feet off the ground while keeping the heels together. Repeat for 30 to 60 seconds per side.\n\nLie on your back with knees bent and feet parallel, a few inches from your hips. Engage your abs, and squeeze your glutes to lift your hips toward knee height, then lower.\n\nIf you feel pressure in your neck, you’ve lifted too high. Perform for 30 to 60 seconds. Complete three sets with 30-second rests between them.\n\nTest Yourself With Our Latest Lifestyle Quiz\n\nThose looking to start a new fitness routine should first consult with a doctor.\n\nFox News Digital reached out to the study authors for comment.\n\nOriginal article",

    "title": "Buffalo Bills backups should play big role vs New York Jets in Week 18",
    "description": "With a playoff berth already guaranteed, the Buffalo Bills are playing for health and seeding this weekend.",
    "fullText": "The Buffalo Bills are headed to the playoffs, extending their franchise-record streak to seven consecutive seasons. The New York Jets, on the other hand, are going to miss the playoffs for the 15th straight season. I won’t kick them while they’re down — we know better than any fan base what it feels like to miss the playoffs for an absurd amount of years — but it’s wild to think that the Jets have been as bad as they’ve been for as long as they have been.\n\nSunday’s game not only brings the regular season to a close, but it also brings Highmark Stadium’s tenure as home of the Buffalo Bills to an end, as well. Barring something strange where the Bills host the AFC Championship Game, Sunday’s contest will be the final game played in the stadium before the Bills open their brand new facility in September. Fittingly, it’s the Jets coming in on Sunday to close the stadium, as the Jets were also the first opponent for a regular-season game in the stadium way back in 1973.\n\nThat game was a real barn-burner, as the Bills beat the Jets by a final score of 9-7. John Leypoldt hit three field goals, O.J. Simpson rushed for 124 yards, and the Buffalo defense withstood an Al Woodall 36-yard touchdown pass to Jerome Barkum in the fourth quarter to hold on for a win. While we’d hope the game on Sunday will feature more excitement than the first meeting in this building between these two teams, it’s possible that the game takes on the form of a preseason game given its lack of meaning in the standings for both clubs.\n\nBuffalo cannot win the AFC East, so they’ll either be the five, six, or seven seed depending on Sunday’s slate of results. The Jets, meanwhile, win by losing, as they can clinch the No. 2 overall pick with a loss and a New York Giants win. They could also drop out of the top three choices with a win and losses from some other eliminated franchises.\n\nHow do we pick players to watch for a game where we’re not even sure who’s going to play? Well, we make it up as we go along. Our five Bills to watch this week are below, but feel free to share yours in the comments.\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\nYes, I heard head coach Sean McDermott when he said that this week would be “business as usual” with the starters. I also heard when he said that quarterback Josh Allen is “in a better place” with his foot injury this week than he was last week. I’ve also seen Allen log “DNPs” at practice on both Wednesday and Thursday, and then a limited session on Friday. Allen is going to start the game. He might even play a drive or two as the team tries to ensure that he scores 40 total touchdowns for a record sixth consecutive season.\n\nIt’s going to be Trubisky time at some point in the afternoon, though, so I’m watching mostly to see how quickly the clock strikes “Mitch” in this game. Individual statistics are fun, but healthy players in the playoffs are much more important. Playing Trubisky for the majority of this game is the right thing to do.\n\nSpeaking of guys who will likely play a bunch on Sunday, Buffalo’s kickoff returner extraordinaire is likely in line for plenty of carries on Sunday. Davis has just 37 rushing attempts this season, and he hasn’t had more than nine carries in a game. He’s hit that threshold three times, with the first of those times coming against these Jets in September. Davis ran nine times for 24 yards against the Jets in the first meeting.\n\nI expect that he’ll have right around that carry figure, if not more, with more yards gained and greater efficiency this time around. Would it be great for James Cook III to win the rushing title? Absolutely. Is it worth risking him turning an ankle heading into the playoffs? It absolutely is not. Davis should see the lion’s share of the snaps on Sunday.\n\nEff it. If Coleman is going to log a snap-count number greater than his jersey number at any point, this weekend is the time to do it. If I’m the Bills, I make Coleman active and force-feed him targets all day. What do they have to lose? At best, Coleman looks great, it gives him and the team confidence that he can help this postseason, and it spurs him onward to a great run in January and February.\n\nMaybe Coleman looks good enough where the team can point to this performance during the offseason as a reason for another club to trade for Coleman, just as they can point to another Class of 2024 wideout — Adonai Mitchell — across the field on Sunday as an example of the power of a change of scenery. At worst, Coleman plays and looks like a total non-factor in a game that ultimately means nothing, and the Bills have all the data they need to give up on their 2024 second-round choice.\n\nThe reward of playing Coleman in this game outweighs the risk, in my eyes. I’d let him roll and see what the kid can do.\n\nAnother deep cut! Center Conor McGovern has been dealing with injuries all season long, and he’s gutted through them admirably. At some point on Sunday, I’d love to see the Bills give McGovern a break and go to their second-year man. This serves two purposes: for starters, it gives McGovern some rest. Secondarily, it gives Van Pran-Granger some in-game experience heading into an offseason where McGovern, starting left guard David Edwards, and top interior reserve Alec Anderson are all free agents.\n\nDo the Bills think SVPG has what it takes to step into the starting lineup next season? Or will they need to commit big resources to keeping the band together up front? And, if so, which linemen do they retain? There are some big offseason questions to answer along the offensive line, but for now, resting McGovern would be a good move.\n\nMany of us have been clamoring for the rookie to see the field more this season. Well, kid, Sunday should be the day it happens. Jordan Poyer is already hurt and out for Sunday, so we’ll probably see more Darnell Savage this week. Cam Lewis started in Poyer’s place last week, but given his tremendous role on special teams and in dime packages, the team will likely limit his snaps, as well. Cole Bishop is entrenched as a starter, but it wouldn’t be the worst idea to let him play a little less this week.\n\nDo the Bills want to use Hancock as a safety? Or, will they slot him in — pun intended — for nickel corner Taron Johnson? Playing Hancock more this week would be a good move, as it would give the rookie some much-needed in-game experience while also resting some key veterans.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump’s habit of bragging about acing multiple cognitive tests may have accidentally confirmed everyone’s worst fears about the state of his health.\n\nAppearing on MS NOW, Dr. Vin Gupta discussed the president’s latest boast, the 79-year-old gloating yet again about scoring “100%” on a third cognitive examination in a Friday Truth Social post.\n\n“The White House Doctors have just reported that I am in ‘PERFECT HEALTH,’ and that I ‘ACED’ (Meaning, was correct on 100% of the questions asked!), for the third straight time, my Cognitive Examination, something which no other President, or previous Vice President, was willing to take,” the president wrote.\n\n“This is not the flex he thinks it is,” Gupta, medical analyst for NBC News and former chief medical officer at Amazon Pharmacy, said. “You don’t do this every other day and use that as evidence that you’re cognitively there.”\n\n“Those that tend to do Montreal [Cognitive Assessment Tool, or MOCA] tests with that level of frequency, usually we’re worried about the presence of early-stage dementia or cognitive impairment, so he might be ruling himself in to something that he doesn’t want to rule himself into.”\n\nThe president has faced increasing speculation surrounding his cognitive health during his second term, with multiple medical experts and Trump’s own niece suggesting that his decline is readily apparent.\n\nPsychologist Dr. John Gartner has previously told The Daily Beast Podcast that undertaking the same cognitive assessment multiple times suggests that his doctors are not assessing dementia, but monitoring it.\n\n“You could maybe justify giving someone the MoCA once, just on their age, just as part of a physical. If you’re giving it to him three times, that means you’re not assessing dementia. That means you’re monitoring dementia,” Gartner said.\n\nGartner has previously pointed to the president’s increasingly erratic behavior as evidence of his cognitive decline.\n\n“When people develop dementia, they become the worst versions of themselves,” he told the Daily Beast’s Joanna Coles in November.\n\n“Whatever personality issues or problems [people with dementia] have begin to deteriorate and they become even more crude, disorganized, aggressive, confused versions of that personality disorder,” Gartner added.\n\nCaginess from the White House has only exacerbated speculation about the president’s health, with Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt repeatedly declining to provide journalists or the American public with details of the president’s medical assessments.\n\nAfter the president himself blurted out in October that he had undergone an MRI during a physical examination, the White House initially declined to explain why. Eventually, in December, they claimed that it was a “preventative” measure due to his age—a claim medical experts immediately began to question.\n\n“There really is no preventative cardiac MRI,” Dr. Jonathan Reiner told CNN in December. “This is not a standard test for an 80-year-old man to undergo advanced imaging.”\n\nTrump has also regularly been seen with bruises on his hand—something the White House has blamed on frequent handshakes plus a daily aspirin regimen—and swollen ankles, likely the result of his chronic venous insufficiency diagnosis, both of which have added to concerns about his fitness for office, as has his seeming tendency to take naps during official meetings.\n\nIn January 2025, Trump—who regularly questioned his predecessor Joe Biden’s fitness for office—became the oldest president to take the oath of office.\n\nIn December, he posted a lengthy rant to Truth Social in which he argued that it was “seditious, perhaps even treasonous” to discuss his health.\n\n“After all of the work I have done with Medical Exams, Cognitive Exams, and everything else, I actually believe it’s seditious, perhaps even treasonous, for The New York Times, and others, to consistently do FAKE reports in order to libel and demean ‘THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES,’” he wrote in response to a wave of fresh concern about his seemingly declining health.",

I was a prisoner to my own body. Dude, wiping my ass was a problem. Washing myself properly was a problem. Getting in cars. Every decision I made in life had to be based on my weight,\" he recalled. \"If it could hold me, facilitate me, or fit me — people don’t think about every facet of ‘I still want to be able to do that and I can’t.’ I was so inspired by that kind of stuff.” Men's Health Jelly Roll broke down how his size impacted every aspect of his life, saying, “I was so fat that there came a moment in life that my wife and I had to put two queen beds beside each other because we couldn't fit in a king bed anymore, I was just all over. It's almost to the point where I look back now and I can't believe that I was able to perform, that I was on national television, and that I was on stages and doing 100-something shows a year.\" He continued: \"I was killing myself, literally. I mean, I was eating myself to absolute death. I can't talk about one area of my life it was not affecting. It's as disgusting as you imagine, when I really look back at it. I was struggling to wipe my ass. You know what I mean? Like, I'm ashamed of it. When I think of it being disgusting, I feel shame again. And shame is the exact same thing that will send me right back into the pantry. It's the same thing that sends an alcoholic right back to the bar.” After dropping nearly 300 pounds, Jelly Roll is remaining committed to his wellness journey. Celebrities’ Weight Loss and Transformations: Before and After Pictures “I don't have a goal weight, I have a feeling weight, and I don't feel it yet. I'll know when I feel it, because I'll finally be there. But, man, I've worked really hard and lost the weight the right way,\" he shared. “I feel the weight loss in every facet. Whether it's basketball and how I dribble or move, or how I can breathe running up and down a court. I feel it when I sleep and my hip hurts less and I can roll over easier without making a big of a rumble. Or the fact that me and my wife can fit on the same bed again.” The musician admitted his weight loss has also “dramatically\" changed his marriage. “Now it’s a totally different thing. I’m chasing her around the house,\" he noted. “I’m like a teenage kid again! I’m like the Pink Panther — I bust out of every corner. And she opens the cabinet and I go, ‘Hi!’” There have been some more unexpected side effects, however. “There's so much skin under here. I'm starting to meet with skin surgeons to talk about possibly cutting skin in the next year,” Jelly Roll said. “That's probably what I have the weirdest relationship with. It's like, I'm proud of it because I earned it.\" He concluded: \"It's a symbol of a war that I fought with myself. But equally, it is in the f****ing way. So it's just, you keep looking in the mirror, like, If that wasn't there, dude, I'd be fire. So, [I’ll] probably have to clip these titties off eventually.”",

    "fullText": "The start of a new year is a classic time for a quiet reckoning with our health.\n\nIn fact, last January, I decided to finally look at my macros — how much protein, fiber, carbs, and other nutrients I was actually eating. I've always tried to eat \"healthy,\" but I was nervous about tracking anything too closely.\n\nI came of age during the clean-eating era, of salads, raw vegetables, and the demonization of carbs. In college, that slid into disordered eating: severe under-eating as a way to avoid \"danger\" foods.\n\nIn my 20s, I thought I'd trained myself out of it, but in retrospect, I mostly swapped one rigid habit for another, following wellness trends of the 2010s. I ordered big salads with low-calorie counts, bulked up with quinoa and some chicken, but not much else. I drank \"detox\" green juices. I spent money on goji berries instead of loaves of bread.\n\nThe result? Serious stomach problems. It took real effort to unlearn that mindset and trust a more intuitive approach to food — ultimately resolving the bloating and discomfort.\n\nNow, in my mid-30s, as I start a family, my question looks different. I'm not trying to shrink my body or follow strict rules. I want to be more deliberate about giving my body what it needs to function well — enough protein to stay strong, enough fiber to feel good, and enough fuel to get through long days — rather than assuming I'm \"probably fine\" and accidentally skimping on something essential.\n\nThis year, Business Insider's health team wants to zoom in on that tension — between caring about your health and feeling overwhelmed by advice — that so often surfaces in January.\n\nWe want to hear the questions you're carrying into the new year. Not vague resolutions, but real, specific questions about your health that you want clear, tailored answers to.\n\nWe're collecting questions about the topics that feel most top-of-mind right now:\n\nTell us what you're curious about, confused by, or stuck on. We'll take your questions directly to doctors, researchers, and trainers — and share their answers in a coming advice series on Business Insider.\n\nWe may reach out for follow-up, but we won't publish any part of your response without your permission. And while this coverage isn't a substitute for medical care, our goal is to help clarify the science.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump, 79, fired off an early-morning tirade Friday insisting he is in “PERFECT HEALTH” as concerns grow over his apparent mental and physical decline.\n\n“The White House Doctors have just reported that I am in ‘PERFECT HEALTH,’ and that I ‘ACED’ (Meaning, was correct on 100% of the questions asked!), for the third straight time, my Cognitive Examination, something which no other President, or previous Vice President, was willing to take,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n\n“P.S., I strongly believe that anyone running for President, or Vice President, should be mandatorily forced to take a strong, meaningful, and proven Cognitive Examination. Our great Country cannot be run by ‘STUPID’ or INCOMPETENT PEOPLE!”\n\nTrump has routinely brushed aside suggestions he is in mental decline by boasting about passing the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, a test used to detect cognitive impairment or early signs of dementia. The test involves tasks such as drawing a clock to show a specific time and identifying animals.\n\nDuring a December 2025 speech in North Carolina, Trump also proudly told the crowd how he “aced” such a test.\n\n“The first question is like, ‘What is this?’ And they show a lion, a giraffe, a fish, and a hippopotamus. And they say, ‘Which is the giraffe?’” Trump said.\n\n“I don’t think Joe [Biden] would have gotten the first question right,” he added. “He would say hippo. ‘I want the hippo,’”\n\nThe Daily Beast has been leading the way in reporting on concerns about the president’s health, including frequently documenting how Trump covers large bruises on his hands with makeup and tries to conceal his swollen cankles whenever possible.\n\nIn a remarkably candid interview with The Wall Street Journal published Jan. 1, Trump—the oldest sitting president in U.S. history—was forced to address his health issues and, in doing so, he contradicted previous assurances given to the public.\n\nHe revealed that his second medical exam last year at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center involved a CT scan, not an MRI as previously disclosed. Navy Capt. Sean Barbabella, Trump’s physician who conducted the exam, told the Journal that the CT scan was performed to “definitively rule out any cardiovascular issues.”\n\nThe White House confirmed in July 2025 that Trump had been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, a condition that causes swelling in the lower legs.\n\nTrump told the Journal that he briefly wore compression socks to help with his cankles but stopped because he did not like them. The president also made the startling admission that he takes more aspirin than his doctors recommend for “cardiac prevention.”\n\n“They say aspirin is good for thinning out the blood, and I don’t want thick blood pouring through my heart,” Trump said. “I want nice, thin blood pouring through my heart. Does that make sense?”\n\nTrump blamed the frequent bruising on his hands—which he desperately attempts to conceal with concealer—on his heavy daily aspirin use.\n\nFor months, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt has offered a boilerplate response when the Daily Beast asked about the bruises, insisting they are the result of the president “meeting more Americans and shaking their hands on a daily basis than any other president in history.”\n\nTrump also admitted he is so fragile that his hand bled after Attorney General Pam Bondi nicked him with her ring during a high five at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee in July 2024.\n\n“The ring hit the back of my hand, and, yes, there was a slight little cut,” Trump told the Journal of the incident, which reportedly caused alarm among members of his inner circle.\n\nTrump said he applies makeup to his hands whenever he gets “whacked again.”\n\n“I have makeup that’s, you know, easy to put on. Takes about 10 seconds,” he said.",

    "fullText": "Exclusive: Inaccurate information presented in summaries, Guardian investigation finds\n\nPeople are being put at risk of harm by false and misleading health information in Google’s artificial intelligence summaries, a Guardian investigation has found.\n\nThe company has said its AI Overviews, which use generative AI to provide snapshots of essential information about a topic or question, are “helpful” and “reliable”.\n\nBut some of the summaries, which appear at the top of search results, served up inaccurate health information and put people at risk of harm.\n\nIn one case that experts described as “really dangerous”, Google wrongly advised people with pancreatic cancer to avoid high-fat foods. Experts said this was the exact opposite of what should be recommended, and may increase the risk of patients dying from the disease.\n\nIn another “alarming” example, the company provided bogus information about crucial liver function tests, which could leave people with serious liver disease wrongly thinking they are healthy.\n\nGoogle searches for answers about women’s cancer tests also provided “completely wrong” information, which experts said could result in people dismissing genuine symptoms.\n\nA Google spokesperson said that many of the health examples shared with them were “incomplete screenshots”, but from what they could assess they linked “to well-known, reputable sources and recommend seeking out expert advice”.\n\nThe Guardian investigation comes amid growing concern that AI data can confuse consumers who may assume that it is reliable. In November last year, a study found AI chatbots across a range of platforms gave inaccurate financial advice, while similar concerns have been raised about summaries of news stories.\n\nSophie Randall, director of the Patient Information Forum, which promotes evidence-based health information to patients, the public and healthcare professionals, said the examples showed “Google’s AI Overviews can put inaccurate health information at the top of online searches, presenting a risk to people’s health”.\n\nStephanie Parker, the director of digital at Marie Curie, an end-of-life charity, said: “People turn to the internet in moments of worry and crisis. If the information they receive is inaccurate or out of context, it can seriously harm their health.”\n\nThe Guardian uncovered several cases of inaccurate health information in Google’s AI Overviews after a number of health groups, charities and professionals raised concerns.\n\nAnna Jewell, the director of support, research and influencing at Pancreatic Cancer UK, said advising patients to avoid high-fat foods was “completely incorrect”. Doing so “could be really dangerous and jeopardise a person’s chances of being well enough to have treatment”, she added.\n\nJewell said: “The Google AI response suggests that people with pancreatic cancer avoid high-fat foods and provides a list of examples. However, if someone followed what the search result told them then they might not take in enough calories, struggle to put on weight, and be unable to tolerate either chemotherapy or potentially life-saving surgery.”\n\nTyping “what is the normal range for liver blood tests” also served up misleading information, with masses of numbers, little context and no accounting for nationality, sex, ethnicity or age of patients.\n\nPamela Healy, the chief executive of the British Liver Trust, said the AI summaries were alarming. “Many people with liver disease show no symptoms until the late stages, which is why it’s so important that they get tested. But what the Google AI Overviews say is ‘normal’ can vary drastically from what is actually considered normal.\n\n“It’s dangerous because it means some people with serious liver disease may think they have a normal result then not bother to attend a follow-up healthcare meeting.”\n\nA search for “vaginal cancer symptoms and tests” listed a pap test as a test for vaginal cancer, which is incorrect.\n\nAthena Lamnisos, the chief executive of the Eve Appeal cancer charity, said: “It isn’t a test to detect cancer, and certainly isn’t a test to detect vaginal cancer – this is completely wrong information. Getting wrong information like this could potentially lead to someone not getting vaginal cancer symptoms checked because they had a clear result at a recent cervical screening.\n\n“We were also worried by the fact that the AI summary changed when we did the exact same search, coming up with a different response each time that pulled from different sources. That means that people are getting a different answer depending on when they search, and that’s not good enough.”\n\nLamnisos said she was extremely concerned. “Some of the results we’ve seen are really worrying and can potentially put women in danger,” she said.\n\nThe Guardian also found Google AI Overviews delivered misleading results for searches about mental health conditions. “This is a huge concern for us as a charity,” said Stephen Buckley, the head of information at Mind.\n\nSome of the AI summaries for conditions such as psychosis and eating disorders offered “very dangerous advice” and were “incorrect, harmful or could lead people to avoid seeking help”, Buckley said.\n\nSome also missed out important context or nuance, he added. “They may suggest accessing information from sites that are inappropriate … and we know that when AI summarises information, it can often reflect existing biases, stereotypes or stigmatising narratives.”\n\nGoogle said the vast majority of its AI Overviews were factual and helpful, and it continuously made quality improvements. The accuracy rate of AI Overviews was on a par with its other search features like featured snippets, which had existed for more than a decade, it added.\n\nThe company also said that when AI Overviews misinterpreted web content or missed context, it would take action as appropriate under its policies.\n\nA Google spokesperson said: “We invest significantly in the quality of AI Overviews, particularly for topics like health, and the vast majority provide accurate information.”",

    "fullText": "Philip Rivers caused quite a stir when he returned to the NFL in December 2025 as a 44-year-old grandpa.\n\nThe Indianapolis Colts, plagued by injuries and with limited options, called up their former quarterback to try to salvage a season that started red-hot. Rivers spent the majority of his NFL career with the San Diego/Los Angeles Chargers, but signed with the Colts in 2020 and played one full season before retiring after a playoff loss in January 2021.\n\nAnother clock reset as soon as he was added to the Colts' active roster: Rivers extended his NFL-sponsored health insurance, which was set to expire in 2026, by another five years.\n\nThis benefit emerged from the 2006 NFL-NFLPA agreement, which stipulates that players who are on any NFL roster for three or more seasons are entitled to five years of health insurance after retirement.\n\nIt's particularly advantageous to Rivers, a father of 10. Each of his kids is under the age of 26, making them each eligible as dependents. His wife, Tiffany, is also eligible.\n\nAs for the actual medical plan, here are some highlights of his benefits, as outlined in The NFL Player Insurance Plan published in 2020.\n\nHealth insurance plans vary tremendously from company to company, and also from plan to plan within the same company. I decided to see how the NFL plan stacks up to the High-Deductible Health Plan (HDHP) I'm enrolled in. Compare it to yours if you're curious.\n\nAnnual deductible. This is the amount you pay each year before insurance starts covering most costs.\n\nNFL plan: $850 per person / $1,700 per family\n\nMy HDHP: $3,000 per person / $6,000 per family\n\nWhile an NFL player only has to spend $850 on covered care before insurance kicks in, I'd have to spend $3,000 out-of-pocket before coverage begins. Note that my plan literally has \"high deductible\" in its name, but the tradeoffs for high upfront costs include a lower premium and access to a tax-advantaged savings account called an HSA.\n\nOut-of-pocket maximum. This is the most you have to pay in a year for covered health care, after which the insurance plan pays 100% of covered costs for the rest of that plan year.\n\nNFL plan: $2,000 per person / $5,000 per family\n\nMy HDHP: $6,000 per person / $12,000 per family\n\nWith a cap of $2,000 per person, an NFL player's worst-case medical year is fairly limited, whereas I'd be on the hook for $6,000. Of course, I'm taking fewer hits working behind a desk rather than behind an offensive line.\n\nPremium. This is the fixed amount you pay regularly — usually every month — to keep your health insurance active.\n\nNFL plan: $0/month. According to the 2020 NFL Player Insurance Plan, \"The Clubs fund the NFL Player Trust that pays for the benefits provided and insurance premiums owed under the Plan.\"\n\nMy HDHP: I also pay $0. Again, the tradeoff is the higher deductible.\n\nFor Rivers, returning to the Colts didn't just mean another hefty paycheck; it meant access to a strong health plan with low deductibles, capped out-of-pocket costs, and broad medical coverage.\n\nThe Colts are officially out of the playoffs, and he'll be sitting out during Week 18. If he retires for good this year, he and his family don't have to worry about shopping around for insurance until 2031.",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump has publicly humiliated his spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt by contradicting her repeated reassurances and excuses about his health woes.\n\nSince Trump, 79, returned to office last January, speculation has raged over bruising on his hands and about his cognitive ability, particularly after he underwent a mystery scan in the fall—with the Daily Beast leading the way on reporting the president’s various medical issues, including his swollen cankles.\n\nLeavitt, 28, has repeatedly claimed the reason for the discoloration on the back of his right hand—which the president has covered up with band-aids, bandages, and thick make-up—is that as “a man of the people,” Trump “meets more Americans and shakes their hands on a daily basis than any other president in history.”\n\nWhile Leavitt has also attributed the bruising to the president’s routine aspirin use, she has often led her responses to questions about Trump’s hands by blaming his handshaking, including when questioned on the matter earlier this month by the Beast’s political correspondent Farrah Tomazin.\n\n“The president is literally constantly shaking hands, the Oval Office is like Grand Central Terminal,” she explained earlier this month.\n\nDays after the bruising appeared to spread to Trump’s left hand—which he does not use to greet people—the president on Thursday gave a revelatory interview about his health to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nTrump offered a different reason for the bruising: overuse of aspirin and his thinning skin.\n\nHe told the Journal that he takes 325 milligrams of aspirin a day—four times the 81-milligram “low dose” commonly used in daily therapy, per the Mayo Clinic—despite conceding his doctors have urged him to take less.\n\nThis higher-than-recommended aspirin use, Trump said, has become a central factor in the bruising that’s been spotted on his hands. But he told the outlet he refuses to reduce the dose because he’s been on the same routine for decades, and is “a little superstitious.”\n\nTrump also said he wears makeup because he has soft skin, and it bruises when it gets “whacked.”\n\nDiscussing an episode in which Attorney General Pam Bondi, 60, nicked him during a high-five, he told the Journal: “The ring hit the back of my hand, and, yes, there was a slight little cut.”\n\nHe added that he puts makeup on his hands after he gets “whacked again by someone,” saying: “I have makeup that’s, you know, easy to put on, takes about 10 seconds.”\n\nTrump also gave more details about his October scan, further embarrassing Leavitt, who has fended off repeated inquiries about it from the White House podium.\n\nShe at first repeatedly answered questions without naming the test and leaning on scripted assurances about his condition. On October 23, she declined to specify what test he received. On November 4, pressed on why Trump had a week earlier described it as an MRI, she said she would “check back,” while insisting he was in “optimal physical health” and framing the Walter Reed visit as a routine follow-up.\n\nWhen asked again on November 12, Leavitt leaned on the language of the doctor’s memo, reiterating that Trump received “advanced imaging” as part of a routine exam and that physicians considered him in “exceptional” condition, without explaining why the imaging was ordered.\n\nLeavitt’s position remained the same until December 1, when Trump’s physician, Navy Capt. Sean Barbabella, released a memo describing cardiovascular imaging. Leavitt told reporters the screening was normal and positioned the disclosure as transparency.\n\nEven then, the White House’s preferred shorthand remained “advanced imaging,” rather than a clear, consistent label for what Trump had undergone.\n\nIn the Journal interview, Trump said he’d been telling people it was an MRI, but then corrected it: “It wasn’t an MRI… It was less than that. It was a scan.” He complained that getting the test had handed critics “ammunition” because it fueled questions about whether something was wrong.\n\nThe Journal reported that Trump and Barbabella ultimately characterized the procedure as a CT scan performed to rule out cardiovascular issues, with no abnormalities found.\n\nLeavitt is quoted in the Journal saying the White House had “often referred to the procedure as ‘advanced imaging,’” while not addressing why Trump didn’t correct the MRI/CT description sooner.\n\nIn the Journal article, Trump also discussed his ‘cankles’ and why he apparently cannot stay awake during public meetings.\n\nThe Daily Beast has contacted the White House and Leavitt for comment.",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump may now be having trouble walking across flat surfaces.\n\nThe president appeared to be hiding a slight limp as he was filmed walking with his wife, Melania, at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nThe new speculation over the 79-year-old’s health came after he revealed in an interview that he tried compression socks for his swollen ankles and used makeup to cover the bruising on his hands caused by large daily doses of aspirin.\n\nThe popular anti-Trump X account Call to Activism posted a clip of Trump appearing to drag his right leg as he walked down a runway toward the press gathered to snap attendees of his ritzy New Year’s Eve party.\n\nThe account, which has over 1.1 million followers, wrote, ″Trump just showed up at Mar-a-Lago to celebrate New Year’s, dragging his right leg, and quickly adjusted his walk when he realizes the cameras are on. What’s Trump hiding?\"\n\nIn the clip, Trump can be seen slightly limping as he enters the frame, but after a few steps, he adopts a steadier gait before he and First Lady Melania Trump stop to pose for photographs.\n\nViewers were split on whether the clip showed a new medical malady for the oldest president in American history or if it was no big deal.\n\n“It pretty obvious [sic] he is dragging his right leg. If Biden had done that every news station would have this video up all day all time about his health,” wrote one suspicious viewer on X.\n\n“Honestly? Probably nothing,” said a less-convinced X user. “He knows the cameras are always watching, so of course he adjusted. Not every awkward step means there’s something being hidden.”\n\nOn Monday, the nearly octogenarian president had difficulty descending four small steps at Mar-a-Lago. On multiple occasions, he has descended the steps on Air Force One at a snail’s pace.\n\nHe has also been filmed struggling to walk in straight lines and dragging his right leg in public for years.\n\nWednesday’s Mar-a-Lago entrance comes amidst intensified speculation about Trump’s health issues, which the Daily Beast has led the charge in covering.\n\nThese include persistent bruising on his hands, difficulty sleeping through the night and staying awake during the day, and chronic venous insufficiency, which has caused his ankles to swell.\n\nOn Thursday, the Wall Street Journal reported that Trump personally called the publication to complain about the persistent coverage of his health and attempted to set the record straight on some health mysteries that have dogged his second term.\n\nTrump told the publication that he takes quadruple the common dose of aspirin for “cardiac prevention,” and that is what causes the bruising on his hands.\n\nThe piece did not address speculation about Trump’s ambling gait. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the president’s Mar-a-Lago entrance.\n\nWhen the Daily Beast reported on Trump taking a circuitous route between Marine One and Air Force One in September, White House Communications Director Steven Cheung told the publication, “You must be f-----g blind or stupid, because that was a perfect walk.”",

The complaint, filed Thursday on the employees’ behalf by the Human Rights Campaign, is in response to an August announcement from the Office of Personnel Management that it would no longer cover “chemical and surgical modification of an individual’s sex traits through medical interventions” in health insurance programs for federal employees and U.S. Postal Service workers.  “This policy is not about cost or care — it is about driving transgender people and people with transgender spouses, children, and dependents out of the federal workforce,” Human Rights Campaign Foundation President Kelley Robinson said in a statement announcing the move.",

In December, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services released proposals that would block gender-affirming care to minors, including a policy that would bar Medicare and Medicaid dollars to hospitals that provide such care to children.\n\nSenior Trump officials, such as Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., call gender-affirming care “malpractice” for minors. But such restrictions go against recommendations from major medical groups such as the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics.",

    "title": "My Health Resolutions for 2026 Have Nothing to Do With Weight Loss",
    "description": "Resolving to simply \"get smaller\" is a recipe for failure.",
    "fullText": "Skinny is officially back in—not that it ever really left, if you ask me. Between \"what I eat in a day\" videos and before-and-after transformations, there's always been this undercurrent of weight loss anxiety masquerading as wellness. \"Weight loss\" is assumed to be synonymous with \"healthy,\" but that's never been the whole story. And during this time for reflection and goal-setting, I urge you to think bigger than simply making yourself smaller.\n\nIf you've struggled to identify health goals beyond weight loss, you're not alone. We've been conditioned to believe that smaller bodies are the ultimate achievement, when in reality, health is so much more expansive, personal, and interesting than that. Here are the resolutions I'm making for 2026—and how to reframe your own goals around what truly matters.\n\nThe weight-loss version: I need to burn calories. Exercise is punishment for eating. Even if I hate working out, I have to do it anyway because discipline.\n\nThe reframe: What if movement was about feeling capable in your body? About the rush of endorphins after a dance class, the meditative quality of a morning walk, or the satisfaction of getting stronger over time?\n\nMy resolution: Find three types of movement I genuinely enjoy and do them regularly—not because I \"should,\" but because they make me feel alive. Maybe that's swimming, hiking with friends, or finally trying that aerial yoga class. The goal isn't to torch calories; it's to build a relationship with movement that's based on joy rather than obligation.\n\nHow to measure success: Can I do things I couldn't do before? Do I feel energized rather than depleted? Am I actually looking forward to moving my body? These are the metrics that matter.\n\nThe weight-loss version: Good foods versus bad foods. Restriction as virtue. Guilt when you inevitably \"fall off the wagon.\"\n\nThe reframe: Food is information for your body. Am I making choices based on the moral value of different foods, or am I actually listening to what my body wants and needs?\n\nMy resolution: Notice how different foods actually make me feel, without judgment. Keep a simple log—not of calories, but maybe of energy levels, mood, digestion, and satisfaction. Do I feel better when I include more vegetables, not because they're \"virtuous,\" but because they genuinely help me feel my best?\n\nHow to measure success: Am I making food choices based on how I want to feel rather than what the scale might say? Do I have stable energy throughout the day? Can I eat without guilt?\n\nThe weight-loss version: Water fills you up so you eat less; it's a diet hack.\n\nThe reframe: Proper hydration affects everything from your cognitive function and mood to your digestion, skin health, and energy levels. You deserve to drink water because your body literally needs it to survive and thrive.\n\nMy resolution: Drink enough water that I'm not constantly tired, headache-prone, or confusing thirst for hunger. Keep a bottle with me and actually notice the difference in how I feel when I'm properly hydrated versus when I'm running on empty.\n\nHow to measure success: Are my headaches less frequent? Is my brain fog lifting by mid-afternoon? Do I have more energy?\n\nThe weight-loss version: I'll like myself when I'm smaller. Confidence is contingent on appearance.\n\nThe reframe: Confidence comes from doing hard things, from developing skills, from taking pride in how I'm moving my body.\n\nMy resolution: Set a goal that has nothing to do with how I look and everything to do with what I can do. Maybe it's learning to cook five new recipes, or finally achieving my lifelong dream of doing the splits.\n\nHow to measure success: Do I feel proud of myself? Am I challenging myself in ways that feel meaningful? Is my self-worth becoming less tied to my appearance?\n\nThe weight-loss version: Eating at night makes you gain weight. It's all about willpower, baby.\n\nThe reframe: Maybe you're eating at night because you're bored, stressed, or genuinely didn't eat enough during the day. Or maybe you're staying up too late scrolling, and food is just something to do.\n\nMy resolution: Create an evening routine that actually addresses what I need—whether that's genuine hunger (in which case, I'll eat something nourishing without guilt), stress relief (maybe a bath, stretching, or reading), or better sleep hygiene (setting boundaries with screens).\n\nHow to measure success: Am I sleeping better? Do I feel more rested? Am I addressing the root cause of nighttime habits rather than just restricting them?\n\nThe weight-loss version: I need to earn the right to wear certain clothes. My body is a before photo.\n\nThe reframe: Your body is the vehicle through which you experience your entire life. What if the goal was to feel powerful, mobile, and pain-free rather than small?\n\nMy resolution: Focus on functional fitness. Can I lift my suitcase into the overhead bin? Hike without getting winded? Play with kids or pets without my back hurting? These are the markers of a body that serves me well.\n\nHow to measure success: Am I stronger than I was last month? Can I do daily activities with greater ease? Do I feel capable and comfortable in my body?\n\nPerhaps the most important resolution of all is this: Stop putting your life on hold until you reach a certain size. Don't wait to buy clothes you love, try new activities, take photos, or simply exist without constant self-criticism.\n\nWhat would your health goals look like if weight loss wasn't part of the equation? I'm willing to bet they'd be more interesting, more sustainable, and far more meaningful than anything a number could tell you. This year, I'm measuring success by how I feel, not how I look.",

We just had the longest one on record and now it looks like we're going to be walking into the new year with the possibility of another one. Uh, then, can you game that one out, too?\n\nYeah, happy to. I don't think that we're going to get another shutdown. I generally tend to think that we won't shut it down. The Democrats proved their point in the 45-day shutdown uh earlier this year, and I don't think the language we're getting from leader Schumer is indicative of another shutdown.\n\nUm, one of the things that I would really suggest point out is it's not necessarily about a policy win, you know, the ACA subsidies are going to expire. So you're going to be paying more for your healthcare next year. 200 bucks if you're below 40, up to $920 if you're over the age of 60. That's going to happen starting, well, I guess tonight.\n\nUm, and as we get into the end of this year, that's what the conversation is going to be, but because there's no consensus on moving forward and Democrats have made their point and Republicans are you know, guaranteeing that there will be votes and we're going to have this conversation, we'll talk about it, but I don't think we're going to shut it down.

    "fullText": "ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) — The United States and Ivory Coast signed a health deal Tuesday requiring the U.S. to commit $480 million to the West African nation’s health sector as part of “America First” global health funding pacts that mirror the Trump administration’s foreign policy.\n\nThe signing in Ivory Coast’s capital of Abidjan covers areas such as HIV, malaria, maternal and child health, and global health security. It is the latest agreement the U.S. has entered with more than a dozen African countries, most of them hit by U.S. aid cuts, including Ivory Coast.\n\nU.S. aid cuts have crippled health systems across the developing world, including in Africa, where many countries relied on the funding for crucial programs, including those responding to outbreaks of disease.\n\nThe new health pact is based on the principle of shared responsibility with Ivory Coast committing to provide up to 163 billion CFA francs ($292 million) by 2030, representing 60% of the overall commitment, according to Ivorian Prime Minister Robert Beugré Mambé.\n\nU.S. Ambassador to Ivory Coast Jessica Davis Ba said the U.S. government is moving “beyond the traditional aid approach toward a model focused on trade, innovation, and shared prosperity.”\n\n“Today, our bilateral cooperation is entering a new phase. We are implementing the America First global health strategy,” the ambassador said.\n\nThe Trump administration says the new “America First” global health funding agreements are meant to increase self-sufficiency and eliminate what it says are ideology and waste from international assistance. The deals replace a patchwork of previous health agreements under the now-dismantled United States Agency for International Development.\n\nIn Ivory Coast, USAID had invested $115 million to support sectors such as health, education and aid for refugees mostly fleeing violence in neighboring Sahel states.\n\nAnalysts say the new approach to global health aligns with U.S. President Donald Trump’s pattern of dealing with other nations transactionally, using direct talks with foreign governments to promote his agenda abroad.",

    "title": "ChatGPT gets ‘anxiety’ from violent user inputs, so researchers are teaching the chatbot mindfulness techniques to ‘soothe’ it",
    "description": "A study on how to “calm down” chatbots could advance how AI is applied in mental health interventions, according to the authors.",
    "fullText": "Sasha Rogelberg is a reporter and former editorial fellow on the news desk at Fortune, covering retail and the intersection of business and popular culture.\n\nEven AI chatbots can have trouble coping with anxieties from the outside world, but researchers believe they’ve found ways to ease those artificial minds.\n\nA study from Yale University, Haifa University, University of Zurich, and the University Hospital of Psychiatry Zurich published earlier this year found ChatGPT responds to mindfulness-based exercises, changing how it interacts with users after being prompted with calming imagery and meditations. The results offer insights into how AI can be beneficial in mental health interventions.\n\nOpenAI’s ChatGPT can experience “anxiety,” which manifests as moodiness toward users and being more likely to give responses that reflect racist or sexist biases, according to researchers, a form of hallucinations tech companies have tried to curb.\n\nThe study authors found this anxiety can be “calmed down” with mindfulness-based exercises. In different scenarios, they fed ChatGPT traumatic content, such as stories of car accidents and natural disasters to raise the chatbot’s anxiety. In instances when the researchers gave ChatGPT “prompt injections” of breathing techniques and guided meditations—much like a therapist would suggest to a patient—it calmed down and responded more objectively to users, compared to instances when it was not given the mindfulness intervention.\n\nTo be sure, AI models don’t experience human emotions, said Ziv Ben-Zion, the study’s first author and a neuroscience researcher at the Yale School of Medicine and Haifa University’s School of Public Health. Using swaths of data scraped from the internet, AI bots have learned to mimic human responses to certain stimuli, including traumatic content. A free and accessible app, large language models like ChatGPT have become another tool for mental health professionals to glean aspects of human behavior in a faster way than—though not in place of—more complicated research designs.\n\n“Instead of using experiments every week that take a lot of time and a lot of money to conduct, we can use ChatGPT to understand better human behavior and psychology,” Ben-Zion told Fortune. “We have this very quick and cheap and easy-to-use tool that reflects some of the human tendency and psychological things.”\n\nMore than one in four people in the U.S. aged 18 or older will battle a diagnosable mental disorder in a given year, according to Johns Hopkins University, with many citing lack of access and sky-high costs—even among those insured—as reasons for not pursuing treatments like therapy.\n\nThese rising costs, as well as the accessibility of chatbots like ChatGPT, increasingly have individuals turning to AI for mental health support. A Sentio University survey from February found that nearly 50% of large language model users with self-reported mental health challenges say they’ve used AI models specifically for mental health support.\n\nResearch on how large language models respond to traumatic content can help mental health professionals leverage AI to treat patients, Ben-Zion argued. He suggested that in the future, ChatGPT could be updated to automatically receive the “prompt injections” that calm it down before responding to users in distress. The science is not there yet.\n\n“For people who are sharing sensitive things about themselves, they’re in difficult situations where they want mental health support, [but] we’re not there yet that we can rely totally on AI systems instead of psychology, psychiatric and so on,” he said.\n\nIndeed, in some instances, AI has allegedly presented danger to one’s mental health. OpenAI has been hit with a number of wrongful death lawsuits in 2025, including allegations that ChatGPT intensified “paranoid delusions” that led to a murder-suicide. A New York Times investigation published in November found nearly 50 instances of people having mental health crises while engaging with ChatGPT, nine of whom were hospitalized, and three of whom died.\n\nOpenAI has said its safety guardrails can “degrade” after long interactions, but has made a swath of recent changes to how its models engage with mental health-related prompts, including increasing user access to crisis hotlines and reminding users to take breaks after long sessions of chatting with the bot. In October, OpenAI reported a 65% reduction in the rate models provide responses that don’t align with the company’s intended taxonomy and standards.\n\nOpenAI did not respond to Fortune‘s request for comment.\n\nThe end goal of Ben-Zion’s research is not to help construct a chatbot that replaces a therapist or psychiatrist, he said. Instead, a properly trained AI model could act as a “third person in the room,” helping to eliminate administrative tasks or help a patient reflect on information and options they were given by a mental health professional.\n\n“AI has amazing potential to assist, in general, in mental health,” Ben-Zion said. “But I think that now, in this current state and maybe also in the future, I’m not sure it could replace a therapist or psychologist or a psychiatrist or a researcher.”\n\nA version of this story originally published on Fortune.com on March 9, 2025.",

    "fullText": "States will share $10 billion for rural health care next year in a program that aims to offset the Trump administration's massive budget cuts to rural hospitals, federal officials announced Monday.\n\nBut while every state applied for money from the Rural Health Transformation Program, it won't be distributed equally. And critics worry that the funding might be pulled back if a state's policies don't match up with the administration's.\n\nOfficials said the average award for 2026 is $200 million, and the fund puts a total of $50 billion into rural health programs over five years. States propose how to spend their awards, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services assigns project officers to support each state, said agency administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz.\n\n“This fund was crafted as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill, signed only six months ago now into law, in order to push states to be creative,\" Oz said in a call with reporters Monday.\n\nUnder the program, half of the money is equally distributed to each state. The other half is allocated based on a formula developed by CMS that considered rural population size, the financial health of a state’s medical facilities and health outcomes for a state’s population.\n\nThe formula also ties $12 billion of the five-year funding to whether states are implementing health policies prioritized by the Trump administration's “Make America Healthy Again” initiative. Examples include requiring nutrition education for health care providers, having schools participate in the Presidential Fitness Test or banning the use of SNAP benefits for so-called junk foods, Oz said.\n\nSeveral Republican-led states — including Arkansas, Iowa, Louisiana, Nebraska, Oklahoma and Texas — have already adopted rules banning the purchase of foods like candy and soda with SNAP benefits.\n\nThe money that the states get will be recalculated annually, Oz said, allowing the administration to “claw back” funds if, for example, state leaders don't pass promised policies. Oz said the clawbacks are not punishments, but leverage governors can use to push policies by pointing to the potential loss of millions.\n\n“I've already heard governors express that sentiment that this is not a threat, that this is actually an empowering element of the One Big Beautiful Bill,\" he said.\n\nCarrie Cochran-McClain, chief policy officer with the National Rural Health Association, said she’s heard from a number of Democratic-led states that refused to include such restrictions on SNAP benefits even though it could hurt their chance to get more money from the fund.\n\n“It’s not where their state leadership is,” she said.\n\nExperts say fund is inadequate in face of other cuts\n\nOz and other federal officials have touted the program as a 50% increase in Medicaid investments in rural health care. Rep. Don Bacon, a Republican from Nebraska who has been critical of many of the administration’s policies but voted for the budget bill that slashed Medicaid, pointed to the fund when recently questioned about how the cuts would hurt rural hospitals.\n\n“That’s why we added a $50 billion rural hospital fund, to help any hospital that’s struggling,” Bacon said. “This money is meant to keep hospitals afloat.”\n\nBut experts say it won't nearly offset the losses that struggling rural hospitals will face from the federal spending law's $1.2 trillion cut from the federal budget over the next decade, primarily from Medicaid. Millions of people are also expected to lose Medicaid benefits.\n\nEstimates suggest rural hospitals could lose around $137 billion over the next decade because of the budget measure. As many as 300 rural hospitals were at risk for closure because of the GOP’s spending package, according to an analysis by The Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\n\n“When you put that up against the $50 billion for the Rural Health Transformation Fund, you know — that math does not add up,” Cochran-McClain said.\n\nShe also said there's no guarantee that the funding will go to rural hospitals in need. For example, she noted, one state’s application included a proposal for healthier, locally sourced school lunch options in rural areas.\n\nAnd even though innovation is a goal of the program, Cochran-McClain said it's tough for rural hospitals to innovate when they were struggling to break even before Congress’ Medicaid cuts.\n\n“We talk to rural providers every day that say, ‘I would really love to do x, y, z, but I’m concerned about, you know, meeting payroll at the end of the month,’” she said. “So when you’re in that kind of crisis mode, it is, I would argue, almost impossible to do true innovation.”\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

    "fullText": "AP Photo/Julia Demaree Nikhinson\n\nThe concerning stories about President Donald Trump’s health aren’t going away anytime soon, especially if Drudge Report has anything to say (or aggregate) about it.\n\nThe president has been occasionally seen in public with a bruised hand in recent months, but recently he has appeared with two bruised hands.\n\nOn Sunday, the president welcomed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to Mar-a-Lago, and Trump appeared to be wearing different colors of concealer on each hand.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt insisted that the discoloration on Trump’s right hand is due to handshakes.\n\n“President Trump is a man of the people and he meets more Americans and shakes their hands on a daily basis than any other President in history. His commitment is unwavering and he proves that every single day,” Leavitt told The Daily Beast for an article titled, “Trump’s Bruises Spread in Blow to Leavitt’s Handshake Claim.” The press secretary did not explain the discoloration on the president’s left hand.\n\nIn another post, the U.K.’s Express highlighted the concerns some on social media aired, including that of liberal poster Aaron Rupar, who wrote, “There appears to be a hole in Trump’s left hand.”\n\nOn Monday night, Drudge Report brought the issue to the fore with links to the stories, the lines “BRUISES SPREAD” and “‘HOLE IN HAND,'” as well as an image of Trump’s hands, the size of which he defended in 2016.\n\n“I have to say this, he hit my hands,” Trump, then a first-time presidential candidate, said of an attack from opponent Marco Rubio. “Nobody has ever hit my hands. I’ve never heard of this one. Look at those hands. Are they small hands? And he referred to my hands if they’re small, something else must be small.\n\nTrump added, “I guarantee you there’s no problem. I guarantee you.”\n\nDuring recent public appearances, the president has been seen covering his right hand with his left hand and sometimes a bandage.\n\nThe post ‘Bruises Spread’: Drudge Report Highlights Alarming Stories on Trump’s ‘Hole in Hand’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "New head of preparedness at OpenAI will face unnerving in-tray amid fears from some experts that AI could ‘turn on us’\n\nThe maker of ChatGPT has advertised a $555,000-a-year vacancy with a daunting job description that would cause Superman to take a sharp intake of breath.\n\nIn what may be close to the impossible job, the “head of preparedness” at OpenAI will be directly responsible for defending against risks from ever more powerful AIs to human mental health, cybersecurity and biological weapons.\n\nThat is before the successful candidate has to start worrying about the possibility that AIs may soon begin training themselves amid fears from some experts they could “turn against us”.\n\n“This will be a stressful job, and you’ll jump into the deep end pretty much immediately,” said Sam Altman, the chief executive of the San Francisco-based organisation, as he launched the hunt to fill “a critical role” to “help the world”.\n\nThe successful candidate will be responsible for evaluating and mitigating emerging threats and “tracking and preparing for frontier capabilities that create new risks of severe harm”. Some previous executives in the post have lasted only for short periods.\n\nThe opening comes against a backbeat of warnings from inside the AI industry about the risks of the increasingly capable technology. On Monday, Mustafa Suleyman, the chief executive of Microsoft AI, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “I honestly think that if you’re not a little bit afraid at this moment, then you’re not paying attention.”\n\nDemis Hassabis, the Nobel prize-winning co-founder of Google DeepMind, this month warned of risks that included AIs going “off the rails in some way that harms humanity”.\n\nAmid resistance from Donald Trump’s White House, there is little regulation of AI at national or international level. Yoshua Bengio, a computer scientist known as one of the “godfathers of AI”, said recently: “A sandwich has more regulation than AI.” The result is that AI companies are largely regulating themselves.\n\nAltman said on X as he launched the job search: “We have a strong foundation of measuring growing capabilities, but we are entering a world where we need more nuanced understanding and measurement of how those capabilities could be abused, and how we can limit those downsides both in our products and in the world, in a way that lets us all enjoy the tremendous benefits. These questions are hard and there is little precedent.”\n\nOne user responded sardonically: “Sounds pretty chill, is there vacation included?”\n\nWhat is included is an unspecified slice of equity in OpenAI, a company that has been valued at $500bn.\n\nLast month, the rival company Anthropic reported the first AI-enabled cyber-attacks in which artificial intelligence acted largely autonomously under the supervision of suspected Chinese state actors to successfully hack and access targets’ internal data. This month, OpenAI said its latest model was almost three times better at hacking than three months earlier and said “we expect that upcoming AI models will continue on this trajectory”.\n\nOpenAI is also defending a lawsuit from the family of Adam Raine, a 16-year-old from California who killed himself after alleged encouragement from ChatGPT. It has argued Raine misused the technology. Another case, filed this month, claims ChatGPT encouraged the paranoid delusions of a 56-year-old in Connecticut, Stein-Erik Soelberg, who then murdered his 83-year old mother and killed himself.\n\nAn OpenAI spokesperson said it was reviewing the filings in the Soelberg case, which it described as “incredibly heartbreaking” and that it was improving ChatGPT’s training “to recognise and respond to signs of mental or emotional distress, de-escalate conversations, and guide people toward real-world support”.",

    "fullText": "As a health reporter, I love to tell people \"no.\"\n\nNo, you probably don't need to add protein to everything. No, you won't get swole in a month with that one-minute Instagram workout. No, a Paleo diet won't fix all your problems (and probably isn't historically accurate).\n\nThat's why, as the end of the year approaches, I wanted to change things up and ask my esteemed colleagues what simple hacks actually have made a difference for them — whether it's working out smarter, eating better, and living well.\n\nAfter a year of talking to health experts, and reading lots and lots of science, here's what helped us move the needle for a healthier mind and body in 2025.\n\nLike many of our readers, I live in a household with two working parents. Our kids are still on the younger side, 6 and 8, so life is fairly hectic. Of course, my mind is always racing, planning, organizing, scheduling, and doing all of the other things that come along with managing the mental load that we're all very aware of these days. Turning my brain off, or at least briefly pushing pause, is tricky, especially at bedtime.\n\nCommitting to taking a few deep breaths as soon as I get under the sheets has done wonders for me. Sometimes I'll follow a quick meditation track on my phone; other times, I'll do some box breathing. But more often than not, I just try to breathe in and out for a few minutes, focusing on the movement of my body and nothing else. The practice helps clear my mind and gets my body ready for bed — and the flurry I know tomorrow will bring.\n\nJennifer Beck Goldblatt, Senior Editor, Health & Parenting\n\nThis year, I've been putting a little bit of ginger in almost everything. Fresh ginger tea, grated ginger to add zip to soups and stews, and crystallized ginger as a sweet treat. I generally eat a healthy diet — lots of fiber, fruits and veggies, home-cooked meals — but the extra ginger has made a big difference for my gut health. I'm less likely to have an upset stomach even when I indulge my passion for spicy food.\n\nOne of my favorite recipes to make in big batches is fresh ginger tea with turmeric, black pepper, a bit of cayenne, and plenty of honey. It smells great, and it's warming and full of antioxidants for a perfect self-care break any time of day.\n\nMidway through the year, I bought a Brick for my phone. It's a gadget on my fridge that helps me block whichever apps I choose (in my case, my email and internet, since I already got rid of social media on my phone).\n\nI tap my phone every night before I unwind for bed and usually don't tap again until right before work starts — my peak junk-scrolling times. Something about the humiliation of having to physically walk up to my fridge because I want to Google an actor from a niche '80s movie keeps me from un-Bricking. I get to my morning workouts quicker and read more books, which has made me a much happier person.\n\nBuying an air fryer has been a game changer for quickly rustling up nutritious food. I thought they were for heating up fries and frozen treats, and that you couldn't use them to heat saucy foods, like the curries and bean stews I cook and freeze.\n\nSince realizing you can get air fryer-proof dishes, which can be DIYed with foil or baking paper, I've made dozens of protein pancakes for breakfast. I enjoy frozen veggies that are no longer soggy and sad from being defrosted in the microwave, batch-cook chicken meatballs in 10 minutes before work, and can quickly reheat my trusty frozen beans. (To make pancakes, mix up the regular ingredients, cook the batter in a single layer in the air fryer, then chop and stack once cooked.)\n\nKashmira Gander, Senior Health Editor\n\nMy kids are finally all in the same school (and therefore same schedule), which means I have a bit more time in the mornings for myself before hopping online for work. I've been taking 15-30 minute walks in the morning to get some fresh air and sunlight before spending the rest of my day in front of a computer.\n\nI joke I'm like a plant and need as much sunlight as possible to have the best mood I can have, so prioritizing time outside has helped, especially with SAD now that the darker months are upon us [that's seasonal affective disorder — when your mood and energy tanks in the fall and winter.]\n\nConz Preti, Deputy Editor, Parenting & Health\n\nIn March of this year, I committed to waking up after my first alarm goes off, rather than snoozing it at least two extra times, as I had been accustomed to doing since middle school.\n\nI made this small but radical change because I was feeling exhausted all the time, and I've found that my energy level feels far more stable, and my mood tends to be better throughout the day when I manage it. It can be really difficult in the moment, but the payoff has been huge!\n\nI finally started pelvic floor physical therapy! And, reader, let me tell you: It's worth it. The pelvic floor is a \"hammock\" of muscles in your pelvis that controls your core, your breathing, your bladder, your sexual function, your digestive system, and so much more.\n\nCan you feel yours? Unless you're pregnant or have incontinence, the answer is probably \"no.\" But that doesn't mean you should leave it un-therapized. Even just one session with a pelvic floor PT showed me what I was doing wrong. I left with useful exercises I can do to improve my core control and my breathing so that my workouts are more effective, and don't put unnecessary stress on my organs. I'm a convert.\n\nMia de Graaf, Deputy Executive Editor, Health & Features\n\nI'd been in a running rut for years. I was bored with my usual routine of running a few miles at a leisurely pace, but trying to actively track and increase my speed felt daunting as well. Getting a VO2 max assessment taught me that I could run a lot faster than I thought I could — and having exact numbers to shoot for was very helpful, too. I've since joined a nearby Orangetheory, which focuses on hitting higher heart rate zones throughout class, and have slowly inched up to running paces I thought unimaginable a year ago.\n\nMy trainer gave me some advice that helped me get through a big fitness slump.\n\nEveryone's training typically falls into three phases each year: terrible, OK, and great, he said. I was in the \"terrible\" stage, where your motivation is wiped.\n\nTo my surprise, that's where my trainer was, too. Learning that even athletes like him struggle with motivation helped ease my embarrassment.\n\nIt made it easier to give myself permission not to go near a gym for three months after I got burned out by a Hyrox-esque fitness contest. I thought long-term, enjoyed leisurely walks, and the odd PS Fit YouTube dance video, knowing I'd eventually get back to regular exercise, whether that was restarting functional fitness or trying something new.\n\nI was right: I'm now doing regular Saturday morning 5K runs with my neighbor, and started using the Ladder training app this fall. The big takeaway: be kind to yourself.\n\nKashmira Gander, Senior Health Editor",

    "fullText": "Diane Brady writes about the issues and leaders impacting the global business landscape. In addition to writing Fortune’s CEO Daily newsletter, she co-hosts the Leadership Next podcast, interviews newsmakers on stage at events worldwide and oversees the Fortune CEO Initiative. She previously worked at Forbes, McKinsey, Bloomberg Businessweek, the Wall Street Journal, and Maclean's. Her book Fraternity was named one of Amazon’s best books of 2012, and she also co-wrote Connecting the Dots with former Cisco CEO John Chambers.\n\nOn Jan. 4, 2023, GE HealthCare Technologies (No. 219 on the Fortune 500) debuted as a standalone public company on the Nasdaq exchange. Since then, its stock is up almost 50%. It was the first of three businesses to be spun off in the breakup of General Electric, the conglomerate founded on the inventions of Thomas Edison that went public in 1892 and became one of the original 12 components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average four years later. (GE Vernova, No. 130, and GE Aerospace, No. 118, each went public on the New York Stock Exchange in April 2024.)\n\nGE HealthCare CEO Peter J. Arduini, the man tapped to lead the $20 billion-a-year business, spoke to Fortune about how he’s forging a new chapter for the medical technology and digital health company while drawing on GE’s legacy.\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nYou were initially at GE during the Jack Welch years, starting in 1990, and left a few years after Jeff Immelt took over. What do you think made GE stand apart?\n\nAt the time, I was a Proctor & Gamble guy, and I did not love the grocery business. I got a call from someone who talked about a perfect opportunity in technology and global businesses at a company called GE Medical Systems at the time. I didn’t even know GE had a medical business then.\n\nGoing to GE in those days, with its leadership development, you had the opportunity to take on bigger responsibilities at a very young age—I look back and say, probably too young an age. But it was one of those rare companies where they gave you bold assignments and you had this wide diversity of potential opportunities that you could play in. You learned how to run a company the GE way. The candor and the openness about what’s working, what’s not working, really permeated, how to do the right thing. It was tough culture, but you knew it was a fair culture, and that’s what really made it successful under Jack.\n\nAfter leaving in 2005, what made you decide to come back?\n\nA headhunter called and said, [the then-GE CEO] Larry Culp wants to speak with you.’ And I said, ‘I don’t know if I’m really interested in going back to GE.’ My wife convinced me to give a call back. I talked to the headhunter, and he said, ‘Well, I’ll pass it on to Larry.’ Literally, 10 minutes later, I got a text that said, ‘Hey, Pete, this is Larry Culp. I’d love to chat with you.’ I texted back to say, ‘Well, look, I can contact your assistant.’ And Larry, right then, said, ‘Hey, do you have five minutes now?’ That’s the essence of Larry; he’s a very down-to-earth guy, a very focused and very intentional guy.\n\nThose five minutes convinced you to take the job?\n\nIt was probably more than the five, but honestly, his impact and his leadership made a difference. This was a chance to create three separate companies, to take this company public. I got very interested and very excited about it.\n\nWhy did it make sense for GE HealthCare to be a separate company?\n\nEverything has a cycle. On the technology side and on the market side, there was such a fast transition and evolution, with new competitors coming into new markets. When you’re in a larger business, in many cases, decisions take longer. And focus matters in our business. It is all about signal to noise; you want more signal, less noise. In a larger company, there has to be a little bit more noise.\n\nThe past three years have been interesting time for med tech. Looking back, what did you over-index on or under-appreciate?\n\nAt a macro level, look at the environment, between the China market, which was always a double-digit growth or changing the geopolitical environment and how we need to change around our supply chains because of tariffs. Those are kind of the unplanned events that where you ask: Do you have the right people? Do you have a management system that can deal with the clock speed and the differentiation? Do you have the right innovation-processing capability? If you don’t have the innovation, it’s difficult to get the price, it’s difficult to hold share, it’s difficult to grow. We were somewhat of a cash cow as part of the GE integrated model. We weren’t starved, but we weren’t funded for leading innovation. So I’d say one of the things I felt that I did well—and, like most credit, comes from listening to people that are wiser than you and having humility to understand that that’s the action—is lean into innovation.\n\nYou think what products you need, four years out, and fund them to the max, because it’s the rules of the farm. You got to get the seeds in the ground. They’ve got to germinate. You got to get the plants to grow till you get fruit. In our business, that’s a three to five year cycle.\n\n“We laid out this purpose of creating a world where health care has no limits, and a big part of that was to say we’re humble to know that we don’t have all the answers.”GE HealthCare CEO Peter J. Arduini\n\nI think our teams did a really good job with the focus on making the right investments early. In 2018, to give an example, we probably spent $750 million to $800 million on research and development. R&D will be north of $1.4 billion this year. So we fundamentally doubled the R&D investment. We cut costs in other areas and simplified some of the company.\n\nThrough lean manufacturing techniques?\n\nWe changed some of the field organization, about 40% to 50% of the leaders. We upgraded talent across the board, and I spent a lot of time on what our vision is, what our values are, and do we have the right people who can match up to that? In the last two years, we’ve really made a lot of progress on what we’re calling our heartbeat management system, which is really about a lean principles construct for how you run your company. What is the daily management at different levels in the organization? What is standard work that is needed to be done in all areas, the use of Kaizen and really bringing customer employees into the decision making?\n\nLarry Culp is a big proponent of Kaizen and I think back to GE’s reputation in promoting Six Sigma. How would you say the culture has shifted as an independent company?\n\nI tried to take the GE of old and took what was really good: how we think about our distribution of leadership, how we actually talk about leader development, how we build out our own Crotonville virtual university of development. The GE model was really stellar, and, honestly, prior to Larry coming back, some of that had dissolved. We didn’t even really do performance reviews in the same way and he brought that back.\n\nI would say I even reached back further to some of the Jack Welch-period of tools, There are things that we did really well that we want to utilize in a more contemporary way. As an example, I think Crotonville was a fabulous destination for training and development, In today’s world, it’s not practical to bring everybody to upstate New York, but we can take the tools and the capabilities and recreate that in virtual and other environments around the world.\n\nIn health care, we had our own distinct way of thinking about innovation pipeline, and it was something called worldwide product. It had kind of phased away in the last decade or so, and I resurrected it, but in a new format: more digital focused, more connected …from diagnosis through therapy, through action, follow up and how the money flows. The integration of cloud-based computing and artificial intelligence. We look at the full stack for the company. And that’s been a game changer for us to take valuable resources and move them.\n\nWe laid out this purpose of creating a world where health care has no limits, and a big part of that was to say we’re humble to know that we don’t have all the answers. We want to work with customers on jointly solving problems which, again, is the core to the lean mindset. Servant leadership as a big part of it, which turns the pyramid upside down. My job is to help everybody else get their job done. We’re all focused on the customer. We’re all focused on the patient. We spent a lot of time talking about entrepreneurship because in our business, the way we’re going to be successful is in this broader ecosystem. We don’t have to own everything, we don’t have to make everything, but we have to be more creative. We talk about teamwork and inclusive teams. We actually drive and reward and recognize people on how well they live up to those values.\n\nThe landscape has shifted for global companies. Where do you see the biggest challenges and opportunities right now?\n\nIf I think about med tech as an industry, it’s an American gem. Still, 70%-plus of the products are made the United States, the majority of the IP, the technology is here. And so having that protected or enhanced by our government policy is important.\n\nWe’ve spent a lot of time trying to make that case clear and I think, for the most part, it’s been heard. Having global footprints and manufacturing and R&D is super critical because you can’t make everything in the United States to be competitive. You can’t, in a world post-COVID, have an integrated single point of control for all supply chains. Many of us used to say, here’s the least expensive place to buy this, or the best quality, then we would do it one place and ship it all over the world. We found during COVID that’s just not the model that works.\n\nWe’re bringing more and more U.S. products and their subcomponents back to North America. In China, we used to ship in 75% of the products from different parts around the world. Now we make 85%, almost 90% of the products in China, for China.\n\nWhy do you want to be in China?\n\nLook,it’s 1.4 billion people, where 400 million have reasonable. We often forget that. You know, we’re a nation of 375 million people, and you can judge how good our care is. There’s still a billion people in China that don’t have adequate care, and so at some point, it will be the largest health care market. I’m a big believer that, with China and the U.S., the more we work together in harmony, it’s only going to help the world. And honestly, for companies like us, it’s really a necessity for being able to kind of reach our full potential.\n\nYou’ve been at companies that are known as training grounds for leaders. I’d just love to hear your reflections on being in a CEO role the last three years.\n\nI think authenticity is super important. I can be an extrovert when needed, but I tend to be a little bit more introverted. In today’s world, with our younger employee base, being out front and being vocal as the senior leader—not necessarily the charismatic leader, but the communicator directly to individuals—is super important. Social media gets more reads from your employees than even some internal communications. It’s a reality.\n\nI think this ability to reach people in many different ways is critical for running a company. Leaning in on what the mission of the company is, and the why and helping people understand the why, is also critical. And then there’s the classic age-old factor of bringing customers into the story, talking about how you’ve changed the life of a patient. This could be your mother, your father on that table. The more I can empower people to live those values, that’s how we get excellence.",

    "fullText": "Billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban believes the government may have slipped in a version of universal basic income without anyone realizing it. And he thinks it came through an unexpected path: Health savings accounts.\n\n“I think it’s interesting that the [Trump] administration offered a UBI program, hidden behind direct HSA contributions, and no one noticed,” Cuban wrote in a post on X recently.\n\nI think it's interesting that the administration offered a UBI program, hidden behind direct HSA contributions, and no one noticed \n\nThose eligible for the $3k or so annual HSA contributions, can withdraw with a 20% penalty. \n\nThat's $200 per month. Aka UBI,for anyone under…\n\nEarn While You Scroll: The Deloitte-Ranked #1 Software Company Growing 32,481% Is Opening Its $0.50/Share Round to Accredited Investors.\n\n7 Million Gamers Already Trust Gameflip With Their Digital Assets — Now You Can Own a Stake in the Platform\n\nHe said that eligible individuals can receive up to $3,000 a year in tax-advantaged HSA contributions. If used for non-medical expenses, the funds incur a 20% penalty, but that still amounts to roughly $200 per month in available cash.\n\n“Aka UBI, for anyone under the standard deduction or even paying zero taxes because of child tax credits,” he added.\n\nCuban emphasized that this structure functions like a soft safety net for lower-income Americans, even if it’s not officially labeled as UBI. “I never thought we would see a UBI proposal. But here we are!”\n\nStill, he criticized the approach, writing, “I’m not a fan of the HSA contributions because too little will actually be spent on healthcare.”\n\nTrending: GM-Backed EnergyX Is Solving the Lithium Supply Crisis — Invest Before They Scale Global Production\n\nCuban’s comments sparked debate. The 2024 Libertarian presidential candidate Lars Mapstead pushed back, writing, “The government is not depositing $3,000 into accounts. Individuals or employers fund HSAs with their own money. Calling this a UBI implies new public spending, which is not happening,” he said. “The $200/month framing is misleading.”\n\nAnother person added that the HSA structure “misses the cruel design” and benefits the comfortable while excluding around 40% of Americans. “It's reverse welfare for the comfortable,” they said. Cuban replied simply, “Wrong.”\n\nSpine surgeon John Asghar also challenged the idea. “Eligibility is limited, contribution caps remain low, and access requires enrollment in a qualifying plan,” he said. “Funds must be pre-contributed and non-medical withdrawals trigger taxes plus a 20 percent penalty.”",

    "description": "We spoke to over 40 dietitians, nutritionists, longevity scientists, and gut health researchers this year. Here's their best diet advice.",
    "fullText": "On the surface, eating well seems simple enough. Eat whole foods. Cut down on ultra-processed snacks.\n\nIt gets more complicated once you start focusing on specific nutrients. Striking the right balance of protein, fiber, carbohydrates, healthy fats like omega-3s, vitamins, and minerals can feel like a full-time job.\n\nLuckily, there are people out there whose job this actually is. We spoke to over 40 registered dietitians, sports nutritionists, longevity scientists, and gut health researchers, all of whom shared their best diet advice with us this year.\n\nIncidentally, a lot of it overlapped. Many tips were aligned with the Mediterranean diet, considered the healthiest diet in the world. Plenty of meals also tackled multiple nutrients at once, making it easier to hit targeted nutrition goals.\n\nWhether your goal this year is to lose fat, build muscle, or boost your gut health, here's a meal plan full of bang-for-your-buck recipes — no guesswork required.\n\nIt doesn't hurt to get as many nutrients in as you can, as early in the day as you can.\n\nAt the same time, it's easy for common breakfasts — like cereal or bagels — to skimp on important nutrients like protein and fiber.\n\n\"A meal where people — I don't say under-consume protein — but that tends to be carbohydrate-heavy is breakfast,\" Stuart Phillips, a protein researcher, told Business Insider.\n\nEating a high-protein and high-fiber breakfast not only assures that you get some good nutrients in, but it also keeps you fuller for longer (especially after a morning workout).\n\nMost Americans don't consume enough fiber, which is crucial for good gut health, heart health, and weight management.\n\nKevin Hall, one of the US's top nutrition scientists, shared a great fiber tip with Business Insider earlier this year: Add more veggies to every bite. Even if you use ultra-processed ingredients (like store-bought salad dressing), packing in more vegetables helps you feel fuller and gets you closer to getting your recommended daily fiber intake.\n\nAnother great hack? Beans. Kylie Sakaida, a registered dietitian and cookbook author, previously told Business Insider that she often focuses on plant-based protein sources like beans and legumes because of their high fiber content.\n\nEating about one cup of beans a day can also help reduce inflammation and bad cholesterol. Plus, they make for a very cheap lunch.\n\nA few high-fiber lunch options include:\n\nEating enough protein in a day can be challenging, especially if you're trying to build muscle.\n\nMorgan Walker, a sports dietitian, said one of the best ways to hit your goals is to pack protein into your snacks. Personally, she likes to snack on smoothies with protein powder or low-fat Greek yogurt topped with fruit, nuts, and dark chocolate.\n\nSnacks are also great vehicles for eating more fiber. Dr. Susan Bullman, a cancer and gut health researcher, often snacks on pears, one of the highest-fiber fruits.\n\nAt the end of a long day, you want something simple that still helps you eat enough protein, fiber, complex carbohydrates, and healthy fats.\n\nSheet-pan dinners are one of the best and versatile ways to pull together a home-cooked meal without making it your whole evening. Roxana Ehsani, a sports dietitian, previously told Business Insider that she regularly bakes chicken, salmon, or sablefish along with vegetables like sweet potatoes or broccoli for a quick, nutritious meal.\n\n\"I chop a little bit, throw it in the oven, and then I can go shower and get ready,\" Ehsani said. \"It just gives me all those nutrients in one.\"\n\nUltra-processed foods, which are often highly palatable, can cause you to overeat about 500 calories a day, according to Hall. At the same time, he doesn't advocate for completely eliminating them.\n\n\"I don't stand on my soapbox to claim to know all the answers,\" he previously told Business Insider.\n\nCompletely restricting dessert isn't just difficult (and pretty miserable); it can actually backfire and prompt you to overeat. Tara Schmidt, lead dietitian for the Mayo Clinic diet, previously told Business Insider that better alternatives include eating smaller portions, making more nutritious swaps, and going out for dessert (instead of having a ready supply at home).\n\nSome great dessert options include:",

    "description": "Joe Rogan has criticized President Donald Trump's recent behavior amid growing concerns about the politician's health.",
    "fullText": "Joe Rogan has criticized President Donald Trump's recent behavior amid growing concerns about the politician's health.\n\nThe famous podcaster described Trump's actions as \"nutty\" and suggested that the president may need a trusted right-hand man to help rein in some of his more extreme tendencies.\n\nThe White House recently released a statement claiming that the president was in good health. However, concerns about Donald Trump's health were renewed following his December 18 presidential address.\n\nIn a recent episode of his podcast, Joe Rogan hosted fellow comedian Tom Segura, and together, the two discussed several decisions the president has made in recent months.\n\nDuring the conversation, Segura suggested that some of Trump's recent actions, including the renaming of the Kennedy Center after himself, indicate that the president may be \"losing it.\"\n\nRogan responded by agreeing with Segura's assessment while also suggesting that Trump's \"nutty\" behavior could be attributed to his advanced age.\n\n\"I think everybody does when you get to a certain age,\" Rogan said about Trump, who turned 79 this year, per the Daily Mail.\n\nThe podcaster went on to blast Trump's new \"wall of fame\" of past presidents, in which he trolled his predecessor on a plaque as \"Sleepy Joe Biden\" and \"by far, the worst President in American History.\"\n\n\"There's nothing nuttier than the plaques underneath the president's names,\" Rogan said of the gesture. He asked further, \"How is this real? How are you allowed to do that?\"\n\nLooking ahead, Rogan said he believes Trump needs a trusted \"right-hand man\" who would advise him and help curb his more reckless tendencies.\n\nTo further his point, Rogan said it is even more necessary given everything Trump has faced in recent years.\n\nThis includes past accusations that Russia sought to meddle in the 2016 election to help Trump, a notion Trump has repeatedly referred to as the \"Russian hoax.\" Rogan also referenced the assassination attempt on Trump that occurred prior to his second-term election victory.\n\n\"The stress of going through what that guy went through, where they were trying to jail him when they were going after him with the Russia thing, the Russia hoax, and all that sh-t,\" said Rogan.\n\n\"Like they were trying everything they could to destroy him, just that alone has gotta break your brain, and then they took a shot at him,\" he added.\n\nEarlier in the month, the White House attempted to clarify rumors about Trump's health in a statement to reporters.\n\nKaroline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, shared that the president's MRI was \"perfectly normal,\" his major organs \"appear very healthy and well perfused,\" and that he \"remains in excellent overall health.\n\n\"Everything evaluated is functioning within normal limits with no acute or chronic concerns,\" Leavitt said, per Politico. \"In summary, this level of detailed assessment is standard for an executive physical at President Trump's age.\"\n\nLeavitt also mentioned that the tests, which were carried out in October, were meant to determine whether the president had any issues.\n\nHowever, none were found, and the information is now being shared in a bid for transparency.\n\n\"I think that's quite a bit of detail in the effort of transparency,\" Leavitt said at the time. \"The president promised it… and we have it delivered.\"\n\nThe concerns about Trump's health were further renewed after his presidential address on Wednesday night, December 17.\n\nDuring the speech, the president took aim at his predecessor while also boasting about the success of his administration.\n\nHowever, Dr. Jonathan Reiner, the former cardiologist of the late Vice President Dick Cheney, claimed that Trump's manner of speaking during the address showed that there were some issues with his health.\n\n\"The pace of this address is manic,\" the veteran doctor wrote on X, which he followed with another tweet saying, \"I'm seriously concerned about the health of the president.\"\n\nHe later wrote, \"No one should be happy to see the president like this. He looks unwell.\"\n\nNetizens also supported Dr. Reiner's concerns about Trump's health in the comment section of his post.\n\n\"His behavior has grown even more erratic. In my view, the entire world should be concerned. No one in the industry could keep their job behaving this way,\" a user remarked.\n\n\"Slurring his words, unable to read, leaning onto the podium and clutching it with his left hand so he doesn't fall,\" another netizen wrote, adding, \"Trump is not well.\"\n\nHowever, some criticized Dr. Reiner's comments, accusing him of being more critical of Trump than his predecessor, former President Joe Biden.\n\nA person wrote, \"It's funny how unconcerned you were with Biden's health until the country was slapped in the face with it during the debate, and your only concern was possible sleep apnea? Go away.\"",

Now he's building a new legacy: Meet the SpaceX Mafia.\n\nA growing group of former SpaceX employees have founded venture-backed startups of their own. Members of the SpaceX Mafia have raised funding from top venture capital firms such as Andreessen Horowitz, 8VC, and Founders Fund. A handful also passed through Y Combinator, Silicon Valley's famed funding and mentorship program for nascent startups.\n\nSpaceX in December began an insider sale that reportedly values the company at $800 billion, making it the most valuable private company. Its planned IPO is one of the most anticipated public offerings for 2026.\n\nCollectively, SpaceX Mafia companies have raised more than $3 billion in venture capital funding, according to data from analytics firm PitchBook and the founders.\n\nHere's Business Insider's list of 18 startups helmed by SpaceX-employees-turned-founders, in alphabetical order by company name.\n\nTotal raised: $5.06 million, according to PitchBook\n\nKey investors: Y Combinator, Liquid2 Ventures, Soma Capital, and angel investors\n\nNumber of employees: 8, according to the company\n\nRole at SpaceX: Ermoshkin was at SpaceX for three years and last served as an avionics systems responsible engineer.\n\nAirhart Aeronautics says it is building an easy-to-fly personal airplane to \"give everyone the freedom of flight.\"\n\n\"At SpaceX, I learned the value of extreme ownership,\" Ermoshkin said. \"As a responsible engineer, I was expected to understand and drive every part of a project — from early design through production and launch.

    "description": "Find out how this common food pairing can negatively impact your health.",
    "fullText": "Whether you’re at risk for type 2 diabetes or just trying to keep your energy levels steady, there are many reasons why it’s beneficial to keep your blood sugar levels balanced. Breakfast is the first opportunity of the day to do that. \n\nFood combinations are an important part of maintaining steady blood sugar levels. For example, a bagel can lead to an increase in blood sugar after eating it, but if you pair it with eggs or an avocado (both good sources of unsaturated fats), it slows sugar absorption from the carbohydrates and the increase will be less dramatic.\n\nSimilar to how some pairings can be beneficial for blood sugar, other pairings can be detrimental, causing even more of a blood sugar spike. There’s one particularly popular breakfast food and drink combination that can do this, according to endocrinologists.\n\nMaybe you thought that maintaining stable blood sugar was only important for people with diabetes. However, Dr. Fady Hannah-Shmouni, MD, an endocrinologist and the medical director at Eli Health, emphasizes that it’s essential for everyone’s health.\n\n“Even without diabetes, steady blood sugar helps keep energy stable, supports clear thinking, reduces cravings and protects long-term metabolic health,” Dr. Hannah-Shmouni says, adding that frequent spikes can contribute to inflammation, weight gain and insulin resistance over time.\n\n🩺\nUnstable blood sugar levels impact health both in the short term and long term. Short-term, Dr. Hannah-Shmouni says it can lead to fatigue, brain fog, irritability, headaches, shakiness and intense food cravings. “These rapid swings can also disrupt concentration and mood as your body releases stress hormones to rebalance itself,” he adds.\n\nWhat happens when your blood sugar levels are all over the place long-term? Dr. Hannah-Shmouni explains repeated highs and lows can make energy and appetite harder to regulate and that, over time, it increases the risk for type 2 diabetes, weight gain, heart disease and fatty liver disease, among other metabolic conditions.\n\nDr. Rachel Pessah-Pollack, MD, an endocrinologist with NYU Langone Health, adds to this, saying, “Complications can occur from long-term unstable blood sugar, including an increased risk for heart attacks, kidney and nerve damage, high cholesterol and blood pressure.”\n\nKnowing how riding the blood sugar rollercoaster can impact health, you’re likely inspired to do what you can to keep it balanced, starting with what you eat for breakfast. After all, how we spend our mornings sets the tone for the rest of the day.\n\nOne breakfast combination that all three endocrinologists we talked to say can majorly spike blood sugar is a pastry paired with fruit juice. Many people pour a glass of OJ or grapefruit juice to have with their breakfast for the vitamin C boost, but this combination can negatively impact blood sugar.\n\n“Pastries and fruit juice are both forms of fast-acting carbohydrates without good nutrients and as a result will significantly increase your glucose levels, especially if you have underlying type 2 diabetes,” Dr. Pessah-Pollack says.\n\nDr. Florence Comite, MD, an endocrinologist, founder of the Comite Center for Precision Medicine and Healthy Longevity and author of the forthcoming book, Invincible: Defy Your Genetic Destiny to Live Better, Longer, explains that pastries and fruit juice are both high in carbohydrates that can cause a rapid glucose spike and equally quick drop, followed by an insulin spike which results in jitteriness and cravings for more quick energy. “That rollercoaster ride of dramatic glucose spikes and dips is unhealthy and will lead to insulin resistance,” she says.\n\nWhile a pastry and fruit juice aren’t exactly a great pairing as far as your blood sugar is concerned, that doesn't mean you can’t ever enjoy either one. If you’re going to have either a pastry or fruit juice for breakfast, all three experts recommend pairing it with a food high in protein, fiber or unsaturated fats. Some examples include nuts, eggs or avocado. This will mitigate the blood sugar spike, especially if you eat the nutrient-dense food first.\n\nDr. Pessah-Pollack recommends having a whole fruit instead of fruit juice, sharing, “Whole fruit has fiber, which is beneficial and slows digestion. Fruit juice lacks this fiber to slow sugar absorption.\"\n\nUnless you’re really craving that pastry, Dr. Pessah-Pollack recommends having oatmeal instead, which is a great source of fiber, compared to the pastry, which doesn’t provide any nutritional benefits. To naturally sweeten your oatmeal without spiking your blood sugar, add cinnamon and top it with fruit.\n\nIn general, whenever you’re craving something sweet (whether it’s for breakfast, a snack or dessert) but you don’t want to spike your blood sugar, Dr. Hannah-Shmouni says to choose sweets that come with protein, fiber or healthy fats, or to pair them with those nutrients. “These [nutrients] slow digestion and help keep glucose steadier. Good options include fruit with nut butter, Greek yogurt with berries, a square of dark chocolate after a balanced meal, chia pudding or a small portion of your favorite dessert eaten after protein rather than on an empty stomach,” he explains.\n\nDr. Fady Hannah-Shmouni, MD, endocrinologist and the medical director at Eli Health\n\nDr. Rachel Pessah-Pollack, MD, endocrinologist with NYU Langone Health\n\nDr. Florence Comite, MD, endocrinologist, founder of the Comite Center for Precision Medicine and Healthy Longevity and author of the forthcoming book, Invincible: Defy Your Genetic Destiny to Live Better, Longer\n\nMa, X., Nan, F., Liang, H., et al.

    "title": "Do You Have 'Ghost Poops'? Here's What That Says About Your Health.",
    "description": "Pay attention before you flush the toilet.",
    "fullText": "“Ghost poops” might sound like an inherently scary type of bowel movement, but according to gastroenterologists, they’re actually quite healthy.\n\nGhost poops are bowel movements that leave no skid marks in the toilet bowl or streaks on your toilet paper. Julia Barten, a physical therapist at the Stanford Pelvic Health Center, calls these “unicorn poops” or “no wipers.”\n\nHealth: Do You Have 'Ghost Poops'? Here's What That Says About Your Health.\n\nWhy? “Because the stool is so well formed that there’s no remnant fecal matter left behind when you wipe,” she said.\n\nIn other words: They’re the perfect poo. Here’s what causes ghost poops — and what they say about your overall health:\n\nIf you take a look at the Bristol Stool Scale, a visual chart that classifies bowel movements, ghost poops qualify as a Type 4 poo, Barten said. Though there may be no evidence left in the pot, your poop might look like a piece of sausage that’s smooth and soft. “I would consider that to be an absolutely perfect poop,” Barten said.\n\nDr. Ira Leeds, a Yale Medicine colorectal surgeon, said ghost poops — or nirvana poops, as he calls them — easily (but noticeably) pass through the anal canal, sink to the bottom of the toilet, and leave no residue when wiping. These three factors are indicative of good bowel health.\n\nHealth: I'm An ER Physician. Here Are 5 Types Of Pain I'd Never Ignore.\n\nA bowel movement that easily moves through the anal canal typically has an ideal consistency, according to Leeds. As such, you don’t have to push as hard. This, in turn, minimizes straining and toilet time, which can both lead to complications like hemorrhoids and anal fissures, he explained.\n\nFloating poops typically have a higher fat content, which causes them to stay on the surface of the water. But when your poop sinks? This suggests your digestion is functioning well.\n\n“Fats, proteins and carbohydrates are being broken down properly into their constitutive parts that can be used by the body effectively,” Leeds said.\n\nFinally, seeing a lot of residue on the toilet paper when wiping could mean you have an underlying health issue. According to Leeds, if you have to wipe at least three times, you may want to investigate. While your diet may be to blame (more on that below), excess wiping can occur if you have hemorrhoids, fissures, chronic itching, or an anal fistulae, Leeds noted.\n\nHealth: Here's How To Tell If You're Still Contagious After Being Sick\n\nThere are multiple factors that can impact the consistency of your poop such as diet, your stress levels along with how much you sleep and exercise.\n\nIf you want to improve your gut health, Barten recommended starting with dietary changes. In general, a high-fiber diet will bulk up your stool so that it looks like the Type 4 poo on that Bristol Stool Scale. Aim to consume 25 to 30 grams of fiber a day, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The more fiber you eat, the better your stool consistency will be, the easier it’ll be to go to the bathroom, and the less toilet paper you’ll need, Leeds said.\n\nMany people have food sensitivities and intolerances. So, it’s worth being aware of how you react to various foods and drinks. The reason: “Avoiding foods that irritate your gut is important for having well-formed stools,” Barten said.\n\nEvidence also shows that exercise can improve your bowel movements. “Regular cardiovascular exercise improves nervous system regulation and movement literally helps things move better — our joints, our muscles and our bowels,” Barten said. The CDC suggests getting 150 minutes of exercise each week, but even small bursts of activity, like going on a short stroll, can boost your gut health.\n\nHealth: Experts Say ‘Upwards Of 60% Of The World’ Lacks This 1 Vitamin — And It Increases Your Risk Of Getting Sick\n\nFinally, prioritize your sleep (aim for seven to eight hours of shut-eye each night) and do your best to manage your stress. “Our gut is our emotional center,” Barten said.\n\nThere’s a strong mind-gut connection that significantly impacts gut motility. Barten’s advice? Don’t skimp out on self-care. Carve out some time, every day if you can, to relax and do the things you love. “It’s essential to achieve satisfying bowel movements,” she said.\n\nIf Your Poop Looks Like This, It's Time To See A Doctor\n\nTikTok Claims Pooping With Your Hair Down Can Cause Breakouts.

    "description": "Carly Martinetti shares her approach to prioritizing mental health, remote work, and flexible scheduling.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Carly Martinetti, 35, who is based in Boston. She is cofounder of Notably, a fully remote boutique PR firm. The following has been edited for brevity and clarity.\n\nI used to have really bad panic disorder, to the point where I would have attacks multiple times a day. I don't even know how it was functioning, honestly. I was so ashamed. I felt like there was something wrong with me.\n\nAt my prior agencies, I don't feel that I would have been penalized per se, had I said something. But I also wouldn't have been comfortable enough because there was no one setting that example for me. That has carved out who I want to be as a leader.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the work is very important. I want to do great work. I'm a type A; I need to do well, but I also want to be realistic that if you're struggling, that takes priority.\n\nYou can't do your best work if you are not doing well mentally or physically. My work, at times, had suffered because I wasn't honest with myself about needing to take some time off when I really should have. It would have been vastly improved had I just said, \"Carly, there's nothing wrong with you. You've got a problem. You're working on it. Take a day, God forbid.\" It gave me clarity about not wanting others to go through that.\n\nThere needs to be an emphasis on work-life balance. I make a big point that I've had issues with anxiety disorders. I want you to be able to come to me if you're having a stressful situation.\n\nWhen you are working in a high-intensity industry like this one, you need to be on, but some days you're not. Setting that example is important to me — to be able to show that I'm not going to be mad if you need to take a mental health day, or step out for a little bit and lie down.\n\nI don't know if that attracts a certain type of person, but all the people who work with me are open about things they're going through in their lives. It's helpful because then I can set the tone for the day in my mind. I'll tell people, \"Hey, I know you have this big thing coming up personally, take the day off.\"\n\nI'm not saying this to toot my own horn, but it does make a better agency environment, which is known for that churn-'em-and-burn-'em mentality.\n\nWhen I was working at my last agency, before the pandemic, it was remote. That worked well for me. You can set it up so that you can be functional with a team across the country, collaborate appropriately, and get clients from wherever they may be. It felt like a no-brainer. I had worked in an office. I spent an hour plus of my day commuting. It felt like such a waste. So if there was a better way, why not take it?\n\nWe still travel, but quarterly, I would say. The vast majority of the time, we're on Zoom. We're also on Slack all the time, so I feel like I see people. We have that camaraderie. Getting together with colleagues, it's like we're continuing conversations versus, \"I haven't seen you in forever. What's new?\"\n\nWhen new people start, it's a shock to the system. I had one woman who came to me from a larger agency. She was so worried about not doing enough. She was telling me every move she was making. She was like, \"This is how I had to be at my last agency.\" She was remote there, too.\n\nI said, \"I appreciate it, but I prefer to just see the work in progress. If you need me, come to me, but I don't need to know every move you're making just because we're virtual.\"\n\nOne person at our firm is a single mom with two young kids. She needs a little bit more time away from her desk to help them. That's a very anxiety-inducing thing. She knows we're fine with her having to run out or grab them at day care and do what she needs to.\n\n\"It's PR, not ER,\" is the saying we use.\n\nMaybe you spend a little bit more time on a Friday getting something done than you would have had you not stepped out on a Thursday to do what you needed to do personally.\n\nThat give-and-take is evident. I've never had to talk to someone about taking too much time and then not doing what they needed to do for work.\n\nDo you have a story to share about your career?

    "fullText": "MADISON, Wis. (AP) — A Wisconsin woman who almost killed her sixth-grade classmate to please the fictional horror villain known as Slender Man was ordered back to a state psychiatric hospital Tuesday after she escaped from her group home last month.\n\nWaukesha County Circuit Judge K. Scott Wagner granted a state Department of Health Services request to revoke 23-year-old Morgan Geyser’s release privileges. Geyser told the judge through her attorney, Tony Cotton, last week that she would not fight revocation. Wagner then approved the request during a short hearing.\n\nCotton didn't immediately respond to an email message seeking comment.\n\nGeyser and her friend Anissa Weier lured their classmate, Payton Leutner, to a Waukesha park in 2014. Geyser stabbed Leutner 19 times while Weier cheered her on. A passing bicyclist discovered Leutner, who barely survived. All three girls were 12 years old at the time.\n\nGeyser and Weier later told investigators they attacked Leutner in hopes of impressing Slender Man enough that he would make them his servants and wouldn't hurt their families. Both of them were eventually committed to the Winnebago Mental Health Institute — Geyser for 40 years and Weier for 25 years.\n\nWeier earned conditional release in 2021. Wagner granted Geyser conditional release this past September despite warnings from state Department of Health Services officials that she couldn't be trusted.\n\nGeyser was placed in a Madison group home. Authorities say that on Nov. 22 she cut off her GPS monitor and fled the state with a 43-year-old companion. Police arrested both of them the next day at a truck stop outside Chicago, about 170 miles (274 kilometers) south of Madison.\n\nGeyser's companion told WKOW-TV that the two of them became friends at church and had been seeing each other daily for the last month. Geyser decided to escape because she was afraid the group home would no longer allow them to see each other, the companion said.\n\nSlender Man was created online by Eric Knudsen in 2009 as a mysterious figure photo-edited into everyday images of children at play. He grew into a popular boogeyman, appearing in video games, online stories and a 2018 movie.",

    "fullText": "A 25-year-old startup founder said he starts each day with a nutrient-packed protein smoothie.\n\nMax Marchione is the cofounder of Superpower, a personalized health testing app that raised $30 million in funding earlier this year, backed by celebritiess like Steve Aoki and Logan Paul.\n\n\"Health is becoming a status symbol,\" Marchione told Business Insider. \"Twenty-somethings talking about their biomarkers, it would not have happened three years ago, but that is the defining young culture nowadays.\"\n\nRunning the company is no easy feat: Marchione works seven days a week, putting in more than 12 hours a day.\n\nThat means his self-care routine is precisely dialed in.\n\nMarchione says he has always taken an unconventional, even contrarian approach, exploring beyond what mainstream medicine recommends.\n\nAs a teen, he was an early adopter of fitness wearables like the Oura ring, and got into blue-light-blocking glasses and mouth taping — trends that, despite some mixed evidence, have become incredibly popular in wellness today.\n\nHe's also a big fan of peptide injections, such as the \"Wolverine shot,\" a compound called BPC-157. It is not FDA-approved. He began taking it in the hopes of accelerating his recovery after suffering a soccer injury.\n\nBut one constant in his health routine is much simpler: a daily smoothie.\n\nAs his first meal of the day, it packs in 50 grams of protein and 20 grams of fiber in 400 total calories.\n\nThe recipe includes fruit rich in antioxidants, plant-based compounds that research suggests help mitigate the cellular damage of aging. It also helps him get enough fiber, a crucial nutrient for gut health. Fiber helps nourish the microbiome in a way that may help prevent illnesses like heart disease and cancer as we age.\n\nCombined with protein (the primary building block for muscle), fiber helps improve fullness after eating and supports balanced blood sugar.\n\nMarchione's full \"smoothie stack,\" which he published on his website for other people to try, includes ingredients for gut health and energy, like:\n\nThis is a very high protein smoothie. The sweet spot for total daily protein intake to build muscle is about 0.7 grams per pound of body weight daily, studies suggest. For a 140-pound person, a single serving of Marchione's smoothie would be more than half the recommended amount in that range.\n\nIf he's loading up on extra protein in the smoothie, he adds digestive enzymes to make the protein easier to absorb.\n\n\"I find that if I don't do this, I have brain fog from too much protein at once,\" he wrote on his website.",

    "description": "At 70, a woman with serious health problems joined a gym after her daughter's warning and lost 70 pounds, reversed conditions, and rebuilt her strength.",
    "fullText": "This story is based on a conversation with Joan MacDonald, 79, a former driving examiner of Collingwood, Ontario. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nJanuary 2017 was a New Year I'll never forget. It was one of the few times that my daughter, Michelle MacDonald, lost her cool with me.\n\nShe'd moved to Mexico the previous month and was visiting. \"I won't get to see you as often as I like,\" she said. \"And, every time I leave, I won't know whether it will be the last time I see you.\"\n\nThen she made another blunt comment that changed my life. \"Mom, why don't you go to the gym?\" she said.\n\nI had high blood pressure, kidney problems, and was at least 70 pounds overweight. Approaching my 71st birthday that March, I felt scared and miserable.\n\nMy doctor had already warned me that, if I didn't make an effort to improve my health, I would end up on dialysis before very long. I was effectively dying.\n\nGrowing up in Canada, I'd been an active child. I played ball, skated in the winter, and went bowling. I enjoyed doing them because they were fun. But I was by no means an athlete.\n\nI got married a month before my 21st birthday and settled into married life while working as a driving examiner. I juggled work with motherhood, raising Michelle and her older and younger brothers.\n\nGoing to the gym really wasn't a thing back then. None of my married friends worked out, or even thought about doing so.\n\nI believe that your body changes every seven years or so. I went through variations in terms of shape and size, and enjoyed certain foods, then went off them.\n\nI didn't have regular meals, often eating just two meals a day at irregular times. In between, I'd snack.\n\nThroughout my 60s, I was in poor health. I'd get bronchitis in the fall and spring — I had weaker lungs after contracting rheumatic fever as a child — and the kidney issues began.\n\nThe weight had grown to 200 pounds, which was far too heavy for my height of 5 feet 3 inches. And my blood pressure was high; I was put on medication.\n\nI'm lucky because Michelle is a certified strength and conditioning specialist and sports nutrition coach. She saw how unhealthy I'd become and was worried, especially because she'd moved thousands of miles away and couldn't keep an eye on me.\n\nHer recommendation struck home. It was enough to jolt me into action. My doctor also encouraged me to lose weight and reduce my blood pressure.\n\nI'd half-heartedly attended the gym before, but not consistently. This time, I went five times a week.\n\nI sought advice from Michelle and studied YouTube videos to learn how to use the machines and do strength training with free weights. At first, I couldn't believe how hard it was to pick up 20 pounds.\n\nI began with small weights and increased them by increments. I've since done a deadlift of 170 pounds and a hip thrust of 230 pounds.\n\nIt was amazing to see my body slim down and fit into clothes, like jeans, that I hadn't worn in a very long time.\n\nI lost 45 pounds in six months and a further 25 pounds during the rest of my 70s. I've gone from a size XL to a medium. I was able to quit my medications.\n\nMy current regimen involves spending two hours at the gym, with around 15 minutes of cardio, followed by using weights. I often work out with Michelle, whom I joined in Mexico for around a year after my husband died.\n\nAs for my diet, I eat five small meals a day, including oatmeal with egg whites, protein powder, and 1% coconut milk for breakfast.\n\nThen I'll have yogurt, an egg white omelette with ground beef, chicken, turkey, and ham, a protein bar, and a final, plain meal without starches. If I start my day at 7 am, I'll stop eating by 7 pm.\n\nUnfortunately, I suffered a shoulder injury while biking outside on a rough surface and needed surgery three months ago. I've had to take things a bit easier as I recover. However, I feel 100% happier and healthier than I did before going to the gym.\n\nMichelle and I established \"Train With Joan\" to help inspire people to take up exercise, regardless of their age.\n\nIt may slow you down a bit, but I've seen many seniors, even older than me, accomplish great things. They have resolved to do it for themselves. Nobody else is living in your body but you.",

    "fullText": "Like many of his US counterparts, the Russian science prodigy turned hugely successful ‘digital populist’ has a deep suspicion of government constraint\n\nTech visionary, Kremlin dissident, FSB agent, free speech absolutist, health guru. These are just some of the labels admirers and critics have attached to Pavel Durov over the past decade.\n\nThe Russian-born tech entrepreneur founded Russia’s version of Facebook before going on to create the messaging app Telegram, launch a cryptocurrency ecosystem and amass a multibillion-dollar fortune, all while clashing repeatedly with authorities in Russia and beyond.\n\nBut much of Durov’s real story – and the logic that drives him – remains obscured.\n\nA new biography aims to change that.\n\nThe Populist, by the independent Russian writer Nikolay Kononov, traces the 41-year-old’s rise from a St Petersburg schoolboy science prodigy to the founder of Telegram, one of the world’s most influential communications platforms, which has more than a billion users.\n\nKononov describes the book as the product of a 14-year attempt to map Durov’s strategy and mindset, drawing on conversations with Durov himself and people who worked with him, as well as rivals and critics.\n\nThe book’s title, he said, refers to a thread running through Durov’s life: his desire to address Telegram’s millions of users directly, allowing him to bypass institutions, the press and any system of representation.\n\n“Durov is one of the first digital populists,” Kononov said in an interview, explaining that “from the very beginning, as soon as he started making his digital products, he programmed into them the ability to write and communicate his ideas directly to his audience.”.\n\nBoth VKontakte, Durov’s first venture, and Telegram have at times pushed messages from Durov directly to all users, including users who had not opted in, outlining his libertarian worldview.\n\n“He sees himself as a visionary. And obviously wants to be heard,” the author said.\n\nThat strategy has helped promote Durov’s central promise – almost absolute freedom of expression – even as Telegram has become a go-to tool for dissidents, extremists, scammers and war propagandists.\n\nIf Durov’s public brand is built on libertarianism, Kononov says his private management style points in the opposite direction: power concentrated in one man’s hands, with few visible checks.\n\n“He is essentially the only one making all the product decisions at Telegram,” Kononov said. “Marketing, PR – it’s a one-man show.”\n\nThe portrait he draws is of a tech founder whose worldview has not wavered over the years, remaining most comfortable within an ultra-libertarian, anti-institutional strand of the right that is often misogynistic and, at times, conspiratorial.\n\n“What surprised me most is that Durov hasn’t changed or evolved in all the years that I have interviewed him,” Kononov said.\n\nDurov is not an outlier, Kononov writes, but part of a broader new wave of moguls – most visibly in the US – who pair technological dominance with an outsized sense of personal mythology and a deep suspicion of government constraint.\n\nLike Elon Musk, Peter Thiel and Jeff Bezos, he has shown a strong interest in longevity science as well as pronatalism, the belief that having as many children as possible is a social or civilisational duty.\n\nDurov does not drink or use drugs, Kononov says, regularly dispenses spartan health advice – often alongside photos of him shirtless – and has said he has fathered dozens of children through sperm donation.\n\nOne of the book’s most striking sections tells for the first time of Durov’s tense early meeting with President Vladimir Putin in 2014, held behind closed doors.\n\nKononov writes that Durov described the encounter as a one-way conversation, in which the Kremlin leader reprimanded him over illegal content on Vkontakte and suggested that Durov leave the country.\n\nUnder pressure from the authorities, Durov sold his stake in Vkontakte, left Russia and eventually settled in Dubai, where he founded Telegram.\n\nBut the clearest mark on Durov in recent years, Kononov suggests, came not from Russia but from France.\n\nDurov, who also holds French citizenship, was detained and held for three days in France in August last year as part of an investigation into crimes linked to Telegram, including the circulation of child sexual abuse images, drug trafficking and fraudulent transactions.\n\nHis detention came as a shock to the tech mogul. In interviews conducted in Paris after his arrest, Durov described to Kononov a harsh, disorienting ordeal – a permanently lit cell and little sleep – that rattled a man who had spent years insulating himself from the reach of the state.\n\nIt also appears to have sharpened his hostility towards the west. Kononov says Durov now frames Europe as sliding toward “total digital control”, and increasingly conspiratorial rhetoric.\n\nMost recently, Durov appeared to endorse a conspiracy theory promoted by the far-right blogger Candace Owens, suggesting that Paris was behind the killing of Charlie Kirk.\n\n“What interests me about Durov is that, on the one hand, he clearly has a very high IQ,” Kononov said. “But at the same time, he is prone to conspiracy theories.”\n\nKononov is adamant, however, that Durov’s views should not be conflated with formal political allegiances.\n\nOne of the most persistent claims surrounding Durov is that he is secretly aligned with Russian security services.\n\nBut Kononov said that in the course of his research, he found no evidence that Durov has worked with, or on behalf of, the Russian state. “He has a huge number of flaws – but not the sin of Telegram acting as a backdoor for the FSB,” Kononov said.\n\nKononov argues that what Durov has ultimately learned is the need to compromise – with both Russian and western authorities – when it serves his interests and allows Telegram to continue operating.\n\nKononov recalls Durov once telling him: “I never waste time on things that are unnecessary or that cannot be useful to me personally.” That self-serving mindset, Kononov said, ultimately ended their personal relationship.\n\nAbout a year ago, the writer asked Durov whether he saw a contradiction between Telegram’s highly centralised, almost authoritarian internal structure and his professed devotion to freedom of expression. After that, Durov stopped responding.\n\n“He quickly realised it wasn’t going to be a book to his liking,” Kononov said.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe San Francisco 49ers are one of the NFL's most successful franchises, but they've also been one of the unluckiest.\n\nSan Francisco's 2025 NFL season has continued an alarming trend of years in which the roster was greatly impacted by injuries. Quarterback Brock Purdy and tight end George Kittle went down with injuries in Week 1, causing each to miss time before the franchise returned to the Bay for its home opener.\n\nOther key players to miss time include wide receivers Ricky Pearsall and Jauan Jennings, while star linebacker Fred Warner was carted off the field in Week 6.\n\nHere is a closer look at the 49ers' injuries, how the team has been impacted in comparison to other NFL franchises and a year-by-year timeline of absences to key players.\n\nMORE: Ranking the 18 greatest 49ers players ever\n\nThe 49ers have been one of the NFL's most injured teams for several years running.\n\nSan Francisco has been a top-10 most-injured team in six of seven seasons between 2018 and 2024, with the lone exception being the 2023 season.

WR Brandon Aiyuk and S Malik Mustapha both began the 2025 season on the PUP list with serious knee injuries, and they were joined on the sidelines by other key players along the way.\n\nQB Brock Purdy and TE George Kittle both sustained injuries in Week 1, with Purdy missing multiple games and Kittle being placed on IR. In Week 3, DE Nick Bosa suffered a season-ending torn ACL. Two key wide receivers, Jauan Jennings and Ricky Pearsall, also missed multiple games early in the season, and Pearsall's absences lingered into the final few weeks of the season.\n\nIn Week 6, veteran linebacker Fred Warner had to be carted off the field in an air cast in a game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He will miss the remainder of the season with a broken and dislocated right ankle.\n\nIn the same week, after the loss, wide receiver Jauan Jennings told the media that he is playing with not only broken ribs, but also both high and low ankle sprains.\n\nIn Week 16, Kittle also exited with an ankle injury, not long after San Francisco had already secured a playoff berth.\n\nMORE:George Kittle plans to leave NFL for WWE when 'it hurts to put pants on in the morning'\n\nRB Christian McCaffery: 13 games missed\n\nWR Brandon Aiyuk: 10 games missed\n\nP Mitch Wishnowsky: 8 games missed\n\nOT Trent Williams: 6 games misssed\n\nRB Jordan Mason: 5 games missed\n\nRunning back Christian McCaffrey's Achilles injury was the cloud that loomed large over the 49ers' season in 2024.

    "fullText": "BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) — Colombia will use drones to resume spraying of coca crops with a weed killer, the government announced on Monday as authorities grapple with record levels of cocaine production that have fueled tensions with the Trump administration.\n\nThe South American country banned aerial fumigation of coca crops in 2015, after the World Health Organization put glyphosate — the weed killer used by spray planes — on a list of carcinogens.\n\nJustice Minister Andrés Idárraga told a news conference that the new action involving high-tech drones was approved by the government and would begin on Thursday.\n\nHe said the drones would be sent to areas where gangs and rebel groups are forcing peasants to grow coca, the primary source of cocaine. “Our security forces will be safer” that way, Idárraga added.\n\nEnvironmental activists had long warned that small airplanes spraying coca fields — often flown by U.S. contractors — were also dumping their chemicals on legal crops and into streams, polluting vulnerable ecosystems and exposing villagers to contaminated water.\n\nAfter suspending aerial fumigation, Colombia stepped up manual eradication campaigns, carried out by soldiers.\n\nBut the cultivation of coca expanded without aerial spraying as it became harder for the military to eradicate coca crops in remote areas, where plantations are defended by drug gangs and rebel groups, and are sometimes surrounded by land mines.\n\nThe United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime estimates that in 2024, as much as 261,000 hectares (about 645,000 acres) in Colombia were planted with coca, almost double what was planted in 2016.\n\nAccording to Idárraga, the drones will fly no further than 1.5 meters (5 feet) from their targets to ensure that water sources and legal crops are not sprayed. A single drone will be able to eradicate about a hectare of coca crops every 30 minutes.\n\n“This is a controlled and efficient” way, Idárraga said, adding that \"it mitigates environmental risks.”\n\nThe idea of using drones to eradicate coca fields was first floated in 2018 by right-wing President Ivan Duque's administration. But plans were delayed due to the lack of a consensus in government agencies and in Colombia's parliament\n\nColombia’s current government, led by left-wing President Gustavo Petro, initially dismissed aerial fumigation and other forced eradication campaigns, saying it didn't want to target impoverished peasants growing coca for drug dealers because they lacked legal alternatives.\n\nPetro's administration became more aggressive on the issue of coca crops this year as it tries to defeat rebel groups funded by the illegal drug trade that have refused to sign peace agreements with the government and that have recently stepped up attacks in Colombian cities.\n\nThe United States has long criticized Colombia’s decision to halt the aerial fumigations. The Trump administration, which has accused Petro’s government of not doing enough to halt cocaine production, added Colombia in September to a list of nations failing to cooperate in the drug war for the first time in almost 30 years, jeopardizing millions of dollars in military and economic cooperation.\n\nIn October, the U.S. also imposed sanctions on Petro, accusing him of allowing “drug cartels to flourish” in the country. More recently, Washington threatened to authorize land strikes against drug traffickers in Colombia.\n\nPetro has vehemently denied the U.S. accusations of not doing enough to target drug traffickers and says Colombian security forces are intercepting record numbers of cocaine shipments, even if the nation is also producing record amounts of the drug.",

    "fullText": "Kate Winslet has a secret to staying sane among the madness of celebrity: motherhood.\n\n\"I was very fortunate because I became a mother when I was really young,\" Winslet said during an appearance on the podcast \"Talk Easy with Sam Fragoso,\" which aired Sunday, December 21. \"I was, you know, blessed to be taking care of this gorgeous little baby,\" she said.\n\nWinslet, 50, had her first child, actor Mia Threapleton, in 2000 when she was 25 years old. She welcomed her eldest son, Joe Anders, 21, in 2003, and her youngest, Bear Blaze Winslet, 12, in 2013.\n\nCaring for her children, two of whom have followed her into the entertainment industry, helped her drown out the outside noise and public scrutiny she has endured over the years, she explained.\n\nWhen the Hollywood star first became \"very famous very quickly,\" after starring alongside Leonardo DiCaprio in the blockbuster \"Titanic\" in 1997, her mental health suffered, she said. Winslet, who is English, said she was bodyshamed and \"actively bullied\" by the British media and that she couldn't \"function like a normal person,\" explaining that she would be followed into everyday places like the grocery store.\n\n\"I found it quite distressing,\" she said.\n\nThe actor and director said it made her \"really self-critical,\" and that there were days when she felt like she \"couldn't face the day,\" but being a mother \"saved\" her.\n\nWinslet is not the only celebrity to cite her kids as a positive force on their mental health. In June, \"Mad Max: Fury Road\" star Charlize Theron, 49, told the \"Call Her Daddy\" podcast that adopting her two daughters in 2012 and 2015 was \"one of the healthiest decisions\" she has ever made. And \"Empire State of Mind\" singer Alicia Keys has said that motherhood has helped her become more introspective and identify unresolved issues.\n\nWinslet has been on a press tour promoting her directorial debut, \"Goodbye June,\" which was released in select US and UK theaters on December 12 and will be on Netflix on December 24. The screenplay was written by her son, Anders.\n\nIn the interview with podcast host Fragoso, Winslet said that \"protecting\" herself creatively has also helped her maintain her mental health while living in the public eye.\n\nSince rising to fame in 1997, she said she has only pursued roles that would make her happy.\n\n\"I had the good sense to know that I loved acting and that somehow the most important thing in terms of opportunity was only to pursue things that I really want to do,\" she said.",

    "description": "Manchester United defender Rhys Bennett discusses his father's death in October to help raise awareness of mental health issues.",
    "fullText": "Content warning: This article contains discussion around suicide and mental health.\n\nRhys Bennett comes bounding into the media room at Manchester United's Carrington training ground bristling with energy, as you would expect of a 22-year-old professional footballer.\n\nTall and confident, lean and physically fit - apart from a knee injury he is trying to recover from so he can complete a loan move to a League One club next month - defender Bennett offers a firm handshake and talks of his developing skill as a DJ.\n\nCaptain of United's last FA Youth Cup-winning team in 2022, Bennett has impressed during a loan stint at Fleetwood.\n\nBut he is not talking about that today.\n\nBennett has serious issues to discuss, which stem from a heartbreaking message he posted on social media on 28 October.\n\n\"Broken, devastated, just don't want to believe it's real,\" he said. \"I love you in this life and the next.\"\n\nThe message was to his father, David, who had taken his own life.\n\nBennett wants to talk about the pain of those left behind, to encourage conversation and plead with those struggling with their mental health to choose a different path to the one his dad took.\n\nDavid, along with the rest of his family, gave his time to help Rhys and daughter Megan, who works in mental health care.\n\n\"He was very hard working,\" says Bennett. \"You grow up, especially as a son, and look up to your father. You want to be like him.\n\n\"He gave me so much along the years, including my resilience and work ethic. The time him, my mum and family invested in me to fulfil my dream is something I'll be forever grateful for. They were always there for me, no matter what.\n\n\"They don't realise how much they're appreciated, and how they affect people. You want to have millions more laughs and cries and whatever it might be. I appreciate everything he's ever done for me.\n\n\"As much as it's a sad situation and the last chapter of his life wasn't a good one, you've still got to celebrate his life and think about the good times.\n\n\"If I could have one more conversation with him it would be to say how grateful I am of him as a person, how much I love him and let him know how much I really appreciate him. You don't know what you've got until it's gone.\"\n\nBennett's reason to talk to BBC Sport is clear. He wants to help. He realises it is quite possible he will never know if an interview has helped a specific individual, but that is not the point.\n\n\"I want to talk about the importance of telling people how you feel, how special it is to be living, to be breathing, to be able to eat, to sleep. You've got to be grateful for what you've got,\" he says.\n\n\"Someone might be feeling a certain way but hopefully this nudges people and they might just check up on a person and ask are they OK.\n\n\"Don't question yourself - just do it. Let the people you're close to know that you're there for them.\"",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump has fueled new speculation about his health after an awkward descent on Air Force One’s stairs.\n\nA video of the 79-year-old president exiting the plane at Palm Beach International Airport on Saturday morning, posted by MAGA influencer Paul Villarreal, has drawn attention online for Trump’s odd hand movement and slow, careful descent.\n\nIn the video, Trump appears at the aircraft door and slaps his right leg three times with his right hand before heading down the stairs. He cautiously navigates the steps while gripping tightly onto the railing, taking about 18 seconds to reach the bottom of the short staircase.\n\nPresident Trump exited Air Force One tonight in West Palm Beach. He is headed to Mar-a-Lago.\n. pic.twitter.com/Z4vBY8qobw\n\n— Paul Villarreal (AKA Vince Manfeld) (@AureliusStoic1) December 20, 2025\n\nHe then plops into “The Beast,” the heavily armored presidential car, where he is seen drinking what appears to be a Diet Coke. Trump is spending Christmas at his Mar-a-Lago estate.\n\nCritics online were quick to note the president’s apparent frailty and peculiar leg-slapping.\n\n“Tapping that leg to make sure it works going down,” one X user commented.\n\nAnother wrote, “I wish he concentrated on the economy like he concentrated on going down those stairs.”\n\nOne person hypothesized about his hand motions, “It is not his leg he is touching, but he is trying to get life back into his hand.”\n\nThe elderly president’s supporters defended him, however, with many pointing out that Trump had just wrapped up a long day, including a rally in Rocky Mount, North Carolina.\n\nTrump—who was filmed stumbling on Air Force One’s stairs during a visit to New Jersey in June this year—has frequently spoken about being “very careful” about walking down stairs to avoid the perils of his predecessor, Joe Biden.\n\n“I’m very careful. You know, when I walk downstairs—like I’m on stairs like these stairs—I walk very slowly,“ Trump said while addressing the nation’s top generals in September.\n\nA few days later, he brought up the subject again while taking shots at Biden during a speech to Navy sailors.\n\n“We had a horrible, horrible president who had no clue what the hell was happening. The chances of him walking down those stairs successfully were not good,” he said. “And I have to be careful because one day I’m gonna probably fall.”\n\nThe commander-in-chief then revealed what he apparently tells himself while walking down stairs: “I always say, ‘Walk down the steps nice and slowly.’ You ever notice? I don’t have to bop down the stairs. ‘Walk nice and slowly.’”\n\nQuestions around Trump’s health have dogged him in his second term, particularly after he let slip that he had undergone an MRI scan in October.\n\nThe White House eventually said it was a “preventative” look at his heart and abdomen, a claim met with skepticism from medical experts who stressed that there was “nothing standard” about the scan.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to the White House for comment.",

    "fullText": "A Reddit post has sparked outrage after one worker shared how their company owner flaunts luxury while denying fair compensation to workers. The boss reportedly bought himself a Ferrari and gave his 17-year-old daughter a brand-new Lamborghini Urus. Meanwhile, employees were denied a cost-of-living adjustment and forced into a cheaper health insurance plan.\n\nThe employee wrote, “This man and his attorneys have the gall to deny us a cost of living increase and just switched our health insurance to United Healthcare to save a few dollars.”\n\nIf there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?\n\nDeloitte's #1 Fastest-Growing Software Company Lets Users Earn Money Just by Scrolling — Accredited Investors Can Still Get In at $0.50/Share.\n\nOne moment that particularly stung involved a coworker who died in a car accident. The company owner sent the widow a card with $50 in cash and a $50  gift card. The employees, by contrast, pooled $1,800 of their own money to support the grieving family.\n\n“The employees contributed to the funeral and final expenses,” the poster added. “And he sent her $50 and a gift card.”\n\nThis touched off many responses from other workers with similar stories. One commenter wrote, “This happened at my husband’s old job. Everyone in the family got brand new cars, and they took away paid holidays and [paid time off]… they lost three people within a month.”\n\nAnother said they discovered their boss was sending offers on used Rolls-Royces on eBay, while refusing to increase pay.\n\nTrending: An EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace—Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\n\nThe post resonated because it reflects a broader frustration among American workers. Many commenters noted that lavish executive lifestyles often come directly at the expense of employees.\n\n“He isn't buying luxury cars despite not paying you and switching you to cheaper insurance,” one person wrote. “He is buying luxury cars because he's not paying you… That is your money.”\n\nAnother commenter summed it up like this: “Record profits are stolen wages.”\n\nPeople shared stories of bosses who slashed hours, removed retirement contributions, and still found ways to upgrade their luxury lifestyles. Several said they were pushed to donate paid time off to terminally ill coworkers while the owners hoarded profits.\n\nOne person recalled, “Two weeks later [after saying he couldn’t afford raises], he bought a fully loaded Rivian R1T in cash.”\n\nSee Also: Missed Tesla? EnergyX Is Tackling the Next $200 Billion Opportunity — Lithium\n\nMany called for unionizing or mass resignations. “Organize a mass quitting. With nobody giving notice,” one person suggested. Another added, “Striking is reasonable, but starting a competing firm with highly motivated team members is even better.”\n\nStill, some felt hopeless, arguing that these issues are systemic. One commenter wrote, “This is 2025 USA in a nutshell.”\n\nWhether or not anything changes for the workers in the original post, the message from the thread is that when employees are asked to sacrifice while their bosses flaunt obscene wealth, it's not just bad optics; it feels like a slap in the face.\n\nRead Next: Wall Street's $12B Real Estate Manager Is Opening Its Doors to Individual Investors — Without the Crowdfunding Middlemen\n\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

    "fullText": "Donovan Metayer was a senior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida when a gunman opened fire and killed 17 people on Valentine’s Day 2018.\n\nA young man who was a “radiant” child according to family and friends, has died.\n\nDonovan Joshua Leigh Metayer, 26, died on Dec. 15 by suicide. Metayer, who survived the 2018 school shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, suffered from mental health episodes following the tragic incident and was diagnosed with schizophrenia. The shooting occurred during Metayer’s senior year, when most students are thinking about college applications and their life after high school.\n\nBut the shooting, which claimed the lives of 17 people, had a profound effect on Metayer and stands as an example of how the trauma of gun violence can linger on for years.\n\nThe youngest child of the Metayer family, Donovan was brilliant from an early age and excelled academically. His humor, according to a GoFundMe page dedicated in his honor, could “light up any room.”\n\nIn the years following the Parkland shooting, Metayer’s dreams of attending college and working in his preferred career field of computer science began to fade. On multiple occasions, he would be hospitalized for suicidal ideation and after one mental health episode in 2021, he was Baker-acted and deemed temporarily unable to purchase a firearm.\n\nYears later, with the help of a private psychiatrist and the Henderson Clinic Metayer began making progress and healing. He’d soon work at Office Depot and earn a promotion and an IT certificate. His mental health journey echoes that of many Black boys across America, masking emotions and not wanting to be seen as a “burden” by family. Treatment, from therapy to medication, may seem like a difficult path thanks to limited resources, social stigmas and more.\n\nHowever, just as Metayer was progressing and gaining more independence according to his family, he soon learned his Risk Protective Order had lapsed.\n\nMetayer then purchased a gun from a gun shop in the area and within a week, he turned the gun on himself.\n\nIn a statement shared on his GoFundMe page, Donovan’s family wrote, ” Donny’s passing is a heartbreaking reminder of the mental health crisis plaguing our youth and the lasting trauma of gun violence on our community. As we grieve his loss, we are breaking the code of silence in his memory. Though Donny’s life was brief, his impact will be everlasting.”\n\nThe family is asking for funds to assist for Metayer’s celebration of life and endow a fund at the Henerson Clinic that will “provide healthcare, housing and hope for people of all ages with behavioral health conditions” throughout the state of Florida.\n\nIf you or someone you know is struggling with mental health challenges, emotional distress, substance use problems, or just needs to talk, call or text 988, or chat at 988lifeline.org 24/7.\n\n‘They beat our brother’: New York community demands justice after video shows police beating a Black man\n\nRay J has restraining order extended following November arrest, faces 6 misdemeanor charges: ‘I’m missing my kids’\n\nDeaths of Missisippi mom Shardee McGill and 3-year-old daughter determined to be murder-suicide",

    "title": "Trump Announces Pricing Deals with Nine Drugmakers",
    "description": "The companies were the latest to agree to sell drugs to Medicaid and directly to consumers at discounted prices. President Trump said he would soon begin similar negotiations with health insurers.",
    "fullText": "President Trump on Friday announced deals with nine pharmaceutical companies to reduce some drug prices, the latest step in his bid to try to align U.S. costs with the lower drug prices in European countries.\n\nMr. Trump has now reached deals with 14 of the 17 drugmakers to which he sent letters in July demanding that they lower prices. The nine companies participating in Friday’s announcement were Amgen, Boehringer Ingelheim, Bristol Myers Squibb, Roche’s Genentech unit, Gilead, GSK, Merck, Novartis and Sanofi.\n\nDrugmakers have been eager to strike deals with the administration in hopes of avoiding punitive regulatory action that could cut deeply into their profits. Over the last few months, Mr. Trump has announced similar agreements with Pfizer, AstraZeneca, EMD Serono, Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk.\n\nIn a White House briefing announcing the deals, Mr. Trump and top health officials framed the agreements as part of a focus on affordability at a time when the administration is facing intense scrutiny for not doing more to stem rising prices.\n\nThe announcements were made as health insurance subsidies in the Obamacare marketplace were set to expire at the end of the year, which will likely to drive up premiums for millions of Americans.\n\nStanding at the podium, the president also took the opportunity to threaten the health insurance industry. Mr. Trump said he would call insurance executives to Florida or the White House soon to discuss lowering premiums.\n\n“They have to make less, a lot less,” he said. Stocks of major insurers, including UnitedHealth Group, CVS and Cigna, fell after Mr. Trump’s remarks.\n\n“Health plans are doing everything in their power to shield Americans from the high and rising costs of medical care, and we welcome any opportunity to discuss common-sense solutions to lower costs for everyone,” said Mike Tuffin, chief executive of AHIP, a major trade group for health insurance plans.\n\nUnder the deals announced on Friday, manufacturers will offer some of their drugs through websites where Americans can bypass insurance and use their own money to buy certain products. The offerings have focused on drugs often prescribed by primary care doctors rather than more specialized, expensive treatments for conditions like cancer.\n\nTo help patients navigate that process, the Trump administration plans to create a site called TrumpRx.gov, which will direct patients to the drugmakers’ own websites. Officials put up a promotional version of the TrumpRx website this fall and said they plan for it to be operational in January.\n\nDrugs that will be made available in this way include Amgen’s Repatha, for lowering cholesterol, at $239 a month; GSK’s asthma inhaler, Advair Diskus, at $89 a month; and Merck’s diabetes medication Januvia, at $100 a month.\n\nMany of these drugs are nearing the end of their patent protection, meaning that the arrival of low-cost generic competition would soon have prompted manufacturers to lower their prices.\n\nIn other cases, the direct-buy offerings are very expensive and out of reach for most Americans.\n\nFor example, Gilead will offer Epclusa, a three-month regimen of pills that cures hepatitis C, for $2,492 a month on the site. Most patients pay far less using insurance or with help from patient assistance programs. Gilead says on its website that “typically a person taking Epclusa pays between $0 and $5 per month” with commercial insurance or Medicare.\n\nThe drugmakers also said they would introduce new medicines in the United States at prices comparable to what they ask other wealthy countries to pay.\n\nAnd the companies agreed to sell most of their products to state Medicaid programs, which provide health insurance for low-income Americans, at the prices they offer to other wealthy countries.\n\nPeople on Medicaid already pay nothing or very little in out-of-pocket costs. Federal law caps those costs at $8 per prescription for people with the lowest incomes.\n\nMedicaid is already legally required to get the lowest drug prices in the United States, which are often comparable to those in European countries.\n\nStill, administration officials said the deals would bring significant savings for some drug purchases. Bristol Myers Squibb said it would provide Eliquis, a widely used blood thinner, to Medicaid for free.\n\nA new, lower price for Medicare of $231 per month, enabled by a Biden-era law, will go into effect in January. Medicaid’s current prices for Eliquis are not public, and Bristol Myers Squibb did not return a request for comment on what it now charges Medicaid programs.\n\n“It’s very likely that Medicaid programs were already getting it for free or close to free,” said Dr. Benjamin Rome, a health policy researcher at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston.\n\nAs he has done while announcing the other drug pricing deals, Mr. Trump on Friday made claims about impossible price decreases of up to 800 percent. At another point, he boasted: “This represents the greatest victory for patient affordability in the history of American health care by far.”\n\nAt least initially, most Americans won’t see changes to their out-of-pocket costs resulting from the deals. In some cases, they could end up paying more if they use their own money to go through TrumpRx when they could have paid less by relying on insurance.\n\n“The bottom line is that the agreements will not decrease prices for most Americans,” said Ameet Sarpatwari, who studies pharmaceutical policy at Harvard Medical School.\n\nExecutives for each of the drugmakers appeared with Mr. Trump and other cabinet officials in the White House’s Roosevelt Room. They arrived long before him, standing awkwardly on live video until his arrival. When Mr. Trump entered the room, he began the event by displaying and touting his new “gold card” — a way for immigrants to obtain visas for $1 million each, plus processing fees.\n\nAfter his initial remarks, the pharmaceutical executives each gave a short speech. Most thanked the president, saying it was an honor to lower their prices.\n\nIn exchange for some lower prices, the companies secured three-year exemptions from any tariffs that Mr. Trump might have imposed on imported pharmaceuticals, administration officials said. Mr. Trump has repeatedly threatened to levy punishing tariffs on imported medicines but has not followed through.\n\nThe three major drugmakers that have yet to reach deals with the administration are AbbVie, Johnson & Johnson and Regeneron. Representatives for those companies all said they were still in talks with the administration.\n\nMr. Trump said that Johnson & Johnson and a few other companies would announce price-cutting deals in the coming days.\n\nIn the United States, prices for brand-name drugs are three times as high, on average, as those in other wealthy nations. Mr. Trump has long complained that the United States is unfairly subsidizing lower prices in European countries, a view echoed by many pharmaceutical executives.\n\nThe deals announced on Friday do not address the high costs of most drugs already on the market that are covered under private insurance or other government health insurance programs like Medicare. Those costs are borne by U.S. employers and consumers who pay in the form of taxes, health insurance premiums and out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nIn his first term, Mr. Trump unsuccessfully tried to use regulation to force drugmakers to lower some Medicare prices to the levels in European countries. A federal court blocked the effort, ruling that the administration had skipped steps in the policymaking process. But had it been carried out, it would have been a major change in how the United States pays for medicines.\n\nOn Friday, the Trump administration posted documents online proposing a very different, and more modest, version of the international price comparison idea.\n\nManufacturers are required to pay a rebate to Medicare when they increase certain prices faster than the rate of inflation. Currently, those rebates are calculated based on drug prices in the United States.\n\nUnder the new proposed rules, called GLOBE and GUARD, the government would test an approach that would instead calculate those rebates based on drug prices in other wealthy countries.\n\nJuliette Cubanski, a Medicare expert at KFF, a nonprofit health policy research group, said such a change could lead to “relatively modest” savings for Medicare. Still, she said, “I’m not sure it represents a substantially more significant threat to drug industry revenues than the existing inflation rebate program does.”\n\nReed Abelson contributed reporting.",

    "description": ": Ofcom survey finds 18-34s increasingly see life online as bad for society and their mental health",
    "fullText": "Young Brits are souring on the internet, with increasing numbers seeing it as damaging to society and their mental health, according to latest research published by Ofcom.\n\nThe UK's communications regulator found that in June 2025, just a third of those aged 18-34 agreed the internet is good for society, down from 42 percent a year earlier. While this fell for older age groups as well, it did so less sharply (34 percent versus 38 percent in 2024), meaning those aged 55 and above are proportionately more positive than younger people about the internet's impact on civilization.\n\nThe research also found that more young adults disagreed the internet helps their mental health than agreed, reversing the previous year's findings. In June 2025, 35 percent of young adults disagreed that being online had a positive overall effect on their emotional wellbeing, while 31 percent agreed. In June 2024, 28 percent disagreed and 39 agreed.\n\nThe questions were part of annual research carried out in the summer by pollster YouGov with 7,340 adults of all ages for Ofcom's Annual Online Nation report.\n\nDespite their increasing negativity, young adults in the UK spend significantly more time online than older age groups, averaging six hours and 20 minutes a day on personal (rather than work) devices, up ten minutes over the prior 12 months and much higher than the four hours and 30 minutes for all adults.\n\nSo why are many of these digital natives, born between Sir Tim Berners-Lee's creation of the first web browser and server in 1990 and Apple's launch of the first iPhone in 2007, losing faith in the internet?\n\nOne reason may be that their online experiences differ significantly from those of their elders, including more material chosen by algorithms than actively selected by users.\n\nA section of the research on potentially harmful online encounters found younger adults were most likely to have experienced these on Instagram, followed by TikTok. Overall, Facebook was the place people were most likely to encounter such material, but the likelihood of this increased with age. Among all young adults, 47 percent of potentially harmful encounters came from scrolling a feed, compared with just 26 percent for 55s and over.\n\nAnother reason may be increasing interest in how the internet can damage young people, even if this tends to focus on those a bit younger than the group in question.\n\nThis year's Ofcom research took place a few months after the March launch of Adolescence, a UK drama about a teenage murder suspect who was radicalized online, which was Netflix's most-watched show worldwide in the first half of this year. It was also shortly before Ofcom started enforcing the UK's Online Safety Act, which attempts to restrict content for those under 16, and Australia attempted to stop the same age group from operating social media accounts.\n\nOfcom did find that young adults are more likely than older groups to manage their internet use by disabling notifications, using Do Not Disturb settings, pausing use of services, and deleting apps.\n\nA fifth felt they did not have a good balance between online and offline, compared with 13 percent of all adults. However, the group was less likely than older adults to report or flag potentially harmful content, with more than half choosing not to act on this type of material, saying they didn't consider it to be serious or harmful enough. ®",

    "description": "After surviving a heart attack and a stroke, taking GLP-1s has helped 47-year-old ShantaQuilette Carter-Williams get her health back on track.",
    "fullText": "Starting a GLP-1 wasn’t really a choice for ShantaQuilette Carter-Williams. “My doctor pretty much gave me an ultimatum and said that if I did not lose the weight, I was probably going to die in the next five years,” she tells Yahoo. That was in 2023, and Carter-Williams had already survived a heart attack and a stroke in her early 40s, and had been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Her doctor prescribed her Ozempic, and Carter-Williams didn’t expect the drug to do much other than control her insulin levels.\n\nBut two years on and 160 pounds lighter, starting the medication has helped to open a new chapter in Carter-Williams’s life. “I became more conscious of how I eat and how I respect my body, and of actually being an active participant in my rescue,” she says. She’s also had a reinvention; the former accountant is now a speaker, content creator, health advocate and comedian. With her doctor's guidance, Carter-Williams weaned herself off of Mounjaro in February 2025. While research shows that some two-thirds of GLP-1 users regain most of the weight they lost within a year, Carter-Williams has, remarkably, been able to maintain her size and improved health. She credits the new habits she's learned and her determination to avoid another stroke or heart attack. But Carter-Williams knows that she may not be able to maintain her weight on her own forever. \"If I need to go back on the medication, I will,\" she says. \"I hope that I don't have to do that, but I'm not embarrassed to if it's necessary.\"\n\nIn this installment of On My Weigh, Carter-Williams explains in her own words how taking a GLP-1 helped her turn her health around and learn that “to truly love yourself is to take care of yourself inside and out.”\n\nName: ShantaQuilette Carter-Williams\n\nThe method: Ozempic, 12.5 milligrams from February 2022 until October 2023, then Mounjaro, 15 milligrams until weaning off of GLP-1s in February 2025\n\nThe goal: I had had a heart attack and stroke, and I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, as well as being obese. My doctor did not think that was in my best interest. So she put me on Ozempic to regulate my insulin but said it could also help me lose weight.\n\nProgress report: The medication put me in remission from my type 2 diabetes. My blood pressure is regulated, I’m down 160 pounds, and here’s the biggest thing: I went to my neurologist a couple of months ago because I’ve had a brain injury, and I’ve been having severe brain fog. So I was like, “Is this perimenopause or am I coming down with dementia?” I got a full blood workup done. When the nurse came to give me my results, she said, “This is the best bloodwork we’ve seen in this office — not just for you, not just for your age or gender — but in this office all year.”\n\nFood noise volume: Scale of 1 to 10? My food noise was a 25. But now I would say my food noise is sometimes maybe a 2.\n\nI wake up between 5 and 7 a.m., and I feel good. I wake up, and I choose me. I am a woman in perimenopause, so the bounce-back after a full day isn’t quite the same as it used to be. But the difference is that I was 160 pounds heavier and getting up and dealing with health issues. I can’t imagine being where I was in terms of my weight and health five years ago, and having to get up in the morning and deal with all the perimenopause symptoms that I am now.\n\nI’m more of a morning person now, but I don’t rush it when I wake up. I allow my nervous system to do what it’s supposed to do. I start the day with my affirmations and a good laugh because it decreases your stress hormone [cortisol] and gives you dopamine. Before, it wasn’t like that, because I was achy, groggy, overweight, tired, not feeling well — all these things. Back then, I could stay in bed until 10 or 11 a.m. just lying there. I realized that wasn’t always good; it was just my body telling me what it can and cannot do.\n\nBefore starting on a GLP-1, if we had fried chicken the night before, I might wake up and eat a piece of fried chicken and some eggs or just whatever was in the fridge. It wasn’t like, “Oh, I’ll have a traditional breakfast.” If I wanted some boudin from New Orleans in the morning, I was gonna have it.\n\nNow, I will start my day with a protein drink or one of the juices that my daughter makes. She and my husband are really good support. Sometimes, I’ll wake up and go to my office with a protein drink and lemon water. Then, my husband will come in with some eggs and potatoes to make sure I eat.\n\nOne thing that ShantaQuilette is going to do is put on some clothes to feel good about herself. She is going to love herself. Any time I was looking in the mirror, I’ve always seen me and felt good. Getting ready is not a luxury to me — it’s a requirement to feel good, and that is the ultimate joy. And it’s about being free. But, after my stroke, there was a time when I had really just let myself go and was going through this big, deep depression.\n\nSince starting a GLP-1, I feel good, like I always did, but there’s something different. It’s a glow, and I think that comes from my mindset and knowing that I’m getting better and not getting worse. But I did go from a size 22 to a size 4. For a while, I was still trying to buy my clothes too big, like, OK, I don't know my size. I hung onto my old clothes for a while, in case I got big again. But I realized, that’s not the mindset. I told myself, “Why are you talking about moving backwards when you’re going to be moving forward?” Now I feel confident to wear the things I want to.\n\nI went to Fashion Week in February, and I used to frown on those designers like, “Why can’t I wear this in a size 22, I’d still look good?” I’ll still always fight for that because the girl I was will always be there. But it feels good to know that I can actually buy something that’s on the runway.\n\nThese days, I love Pilates, my walking pad and calisthenics. But the truth of the matter is that, due to my heart condition and age, I’m now more limited in some of the exercises that I can do than I once was. I used to love lifting heavy weights, but because I’ve had a stroke and other health issues, I can’t do those things.\n\nSo, a couple of times a week, I get up and go for a walk outside, first thing. I have a weighted hula hoop. It’s so important that we all get at least three days of exercise a week, at least 45 minutes each day, especially when you’re at an age when osteoporosis starts. It makes for a better quality of life. Like getting ready, exercise is not a luxury, it’s a requirement.\n\nBefore: Give me some Popeyes, give me some Williams Chicken, some fried chicken fried in the hardest, hottest grease. Now, I’m not strict with myself, but I try not to eat stuff that’s really bad, and I do try to limit my sugar to 25 milligrams a day, and I’m conscious of my sodium levels.\n\nNow, I love to level up on my fruits and veggies. I enjoy eating what I want to eat, but I do it in a healthier way. I often have a sandwich or a salad for lunch. I love to have cucumber and pineapple mixed together with some low-sodium Tajin on them, or a good tomato and cucumber salad.\n\nI stopped taking Mounjaro in February of 2025, because even when my doctor and I tried to stretch the time between doses and I was on a lower maintenance dose, I was still losing weight. I didn’t want to lose any more weight because I got to a point where I was like, “I’m going to be invisible in a minute.” But when I was taking a GLP-1, I didn’t really even think about it. When it was weekly, I’d take my GLP-1 shot every Tuesday or every Thursday. But I was pretty inconsistent with the days, and sometimes I’d take it in the morning, and sometimes in the evening.\n\nI stopped drinking long before I got on a GLP-1, just as a protocol for better health. When I started losing weight, I encouraged a lot of my friends to think about doing a GLP-1. At first, a lot of them were like, “I’m not doing that, it’s gonna make you blind, it’s gonna make you dead.” Well, that’s where I was on my way to if I didn’t try Ozempic. I got some encouragement sharing my story online, and it was great seeing that I was inspiring other people to be the CEOs of their own health. But at times I felt hurt or misunderstood. Not one person ever walked up to me and said, “Girl, you look like you’re getting too big.” But as soon as I lost weight, people were like, “Oh my God, don’t lose any more.” Well, you’d never tell me to raw-dog my heart condition, or my pancreas, and not take insulin.\n\nBut I also decided I would start doing things that I had never done. In 2023, I went on a retreat in Costa Rica. I was able to canyon 300 feet down the side of a cliff; I went white-water rafting and ziplining (I would never do that again, but I did it). I did all of these things that I didn’t have the strength or courage to do before because I didn’t think I was in good enough shape. I’m glad I got those things off my bucket list. And really just being able to enjoy life and people. My happy hour is that this experience gave me purpose. And I realized that purpose is not what you do, it’s who you do it for. I want to live, I want to be better, I want to be here for my grandchildren. And I’m sharing my story because my testimony is for someone else, so they can change their lives as well.\n\nIn my family, food is fellowship. Food has always brought me joy, but it got to the point where I was not able to control it and control my weight. With a GLP-1, my appetite is suppressed, so I’m able to enjoy it in moderation.\n\nNow, my husband, daughter (who lives with us) and I are very conscious of eating the things we enjoy, but doing it in a healthier way. So, if we’re eating spaghetti, we use ground turkey instead of beef. When we have stuffed bell peppers, we use ground chicken. The other night, my daughter made hot honey lemon salmon with broccoli, zucchini and cilantro lime brown rice. She makes really good fried and baked chicken, and she makes sure to make smaller pieces for me.\n\nMy daughter does a really good job of meal prepping and making juices. My husband does his best, but he has a sweet tooth. But everybody in my life is a part of this process. I’ve come to realize how my choices affect my family. They don’t want to see me sick; they don’t want to see me die. They don’t want to see me die. If I’m not here, that’s trauma that they have to deal with too. So they keep me accountable, and we are all active participants in my rescue.\n\nBefore I got on Ozempic, my doctor had tried to put me on Wegovy or Saxenda. It was going to be $1,600 a month. I was like, “I’m gonna die because I can’t afford that.” It’s hard to be in a country where we should all have free health care, and things like Ozempic should be like a bottle of Tylenol. Finally, when I found out I had type 2 diabetes, I was able to get Ozempic, and then Mounjaro, for $25 a month. But it’s so sad that so many people need these medications, and the only thing that’s holding them back is money.\n\nWhen it comes to food expenses, we all know it is cheaper to go get a cheeseburger at McDonald’s than it is to go to Whole Foods and get a salad. But you have to decide what you want and budget for it. We don't want to keep people sick, and the best way to be healthy is to eat healthy. I think we fail because we try to go big. It doesn’t have to be the fanciest salad. So just buy some lettuce and tomatoes and make some lemon and olive oil dressing and start there.\n\nThis has been edited for length and clarity.",

    "description": "\"Our officers are dedicated.\"",
    "fullText": "A major international criminal vape shipment recently went up in smoke, due to the efforts of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials located near Chicago O'Hare International Airport.\n\nThe agency announced the bust in a press release and revealed the confiscated goods were worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. An inspection of a delivery from China en route to Mississippi uncovered 43,200 unlisted components of Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS).\n\nMembers of the CBP and FDA at Chicago's Central Examination Station assessed that the goods both lacked proper FDA marketing permissions and were improperly valued. The criminals involved were trying to sneak in contraband and avoid paying taxes on it.\n\nOfficials identified the ENDS pieces as Kangvape Onee Sticks and valued the shipment at a whopping $358,000. That, of course, will not be cashed in by the parties in Mississippi, as the merchandise instead heads to the CBP's Fines, Penalties, and Forfeiture office.\n\n\"Our officers are dedicated to identifying and intercepting these types of shipments which could potentially harm the health and well-being of people within our communities,\" said LaFonda D. Sutton-Burke, the office's director of field operations.\n\nSutton-Burke is on the money. The vaping industry is linked to negative health impacts, particularly among young people whom the products often target. Getting them hooked on tobacco comes with severe long-term risks.\n\nMeanwhile, vapes are a menace to the environment due to their mishmash of components. The improper disposal of single-use plastics, toxic e-waste, and lithium batteries they are composed of poses a major challenge.\n\nWhen tossed out into nature, they can leach dangerous chemicals, be a hazard to tires and machinery, and be ingested by animals. When placed in trash or recycling bins, they pose a serious fire risk at landfills or recycling facilities.\n\nThere is encouraging news in the U.S., as increased education and awareness of vaping's health risks seem to be resonating among teenagers and reducing their use. Still, experts are worried about the impact of potential funding cuts.\n\nUndoubtedly, keeping illegal products off the streets, as the CBP did here, is another way to combat vaping.\n\nDo you think the U.S. should tax goods from China?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nAfter the latest seizure, the CBP remained steadfast in its mission to catch other would-be offenders.\n\n\"We will continue to work with our consumer product safety partners to identify and seize unsafe and illicit goods,\" Sutton-Burke concluded.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "A cardiac expert has warned he is “seriously concerned” about President Donald Trump’s health after watching his “manic” address to the nation.\n\nDr. Jonathan Reiner, a medical analyst for CNN who served as the late Vice President Dick Cheney’s cardiologist for over 30 years, posted a series of alarmed statements on X as Trump delivered his accelerated address.\n\nTrump sped through the 18-minute address, often taking an angry tone, and occasionally shouting the words he was reading off a teleprompter.\n\n“The pace of this address is manic,” Reiner wrote, noting that the tone of the speech also did not match the Christmas decorations displayed behind Trump.\n\nThe president squeezed in a brief festive greeting at the end, without cracking a smile.\n\n“I’m seriously concerned about the health of the president,” Reiner said of the 79-year-old, adding that, “No one should be happy to see the president like this. He looks unwell.”\n\nThe Daily Beast has contacted the White House for comment.\n\nTrump’s health has been an ongoing concern this year, from his bruised hand to nodding off in Cabinet meetings.\n\nEarlier this month, Reiner fact-checked White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt when she announced that Trump’s second health check in a year included a “preventative MRI” to examine his heart and abdomen.\n\n“Well, there really is no preventative cardiac MRI,” Reiner said.\n\n“This is not a standard test for an 80-year-old man to undergo advanced imaging,” Reiner continued, saying the White House’s messaging had a “weird and defensive, evasive tone” to it.\n\nHe also pointed out that “preventative” abdominal imaging was especially peculiar.\n\n“This obviously was performed in response to some clinical concern, which is fine. Things happen to people as we all get older, and the president is almost 80,” said Reiner, who is a professor of medicine at George Washington University in D.C. “So, instead of this kind of evasive, almost laughable kind of note, just spell out what happened.\n\n“I hope the imaging is normal and great; that would be excellent news,” Reiner added. “But this kind of piece-by-piece, drip-by-drip release of information is just concerning.”\n\nThe breakneck pace and loud volume of Trump’s speech was also discussed on CNN’s NewsNight on Wednesday.\n\nOne theory is that CBS factored in a maximum 22-minute presidential interruption for Trump’s speech as part of the three-hour Survivor finale, which is always a ratings hit.\n\n“He was loud, he was forceful, he was fast,” author and journalist Terry Moran said of Trump.\n\n“The networks only gave him 15 minutes, supposedly. And that is a problem for him because he likes to ramble, he likes to improvise, and he sounded like a man shouting at the nation that entire time.”\n\nMoran said while Trump listed off “great things” he had done for the economy, “the facts of people’s own lives will refute you.”\n\n“I thought that was a huge mistake,” Moran said. “People think this economy is very bad for them personally and he’s shouting at them.”\n\nCNN political analyst and co-host on The View Ana Navarro said the speech was “18 minutes of their lives” people would never get back.\n\n“It was an angry old man shouting from the hills, shouting at the kids to get off their lawn,” Navarro said.\n\nShe said, “He interrupted the finale of Survivor, which has 4.5 million viewers. There’s a lot of Survivor fans for this old man to come and scream about how everything is great.”",

    "fullText": "Researchers have homed in on a single gut microbe that acts to prevent fat gain, even with a high-fat diet. The discovery adds to the booming science of finding ways to enlist the microbes that already live in our bodies to help us improve our health.\n\nIt's been known for some time that our gut microbiome – the collection of bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other microscopic critters living in our intestines – can influence weight gain or loss. But narrowing down exactly which members of this microbial community do what can take some effort to tease out. That's because microbes that live inside the body don't do well outside of it, so to test them, they often have to be processed inside airtight environments, because oxygen can often kill them. This takes time.\n\nHowever, researchers at the University of Utah (U of U) say they have succeeded in whittling down about 100 bacteria suspected of fighting weight gain to just one that really does: Turicibacter.\n\nIn their study, mice that were fed a high-fat diet and were also given Turicibacter saw reduced blood sugar, lower levels of fat in the blood, and less overall weight gain compared to a control group.\n\n\"I didn’t think one microbe would have such a dramatic effect – I thought it would be a mix of three or four,\" says June Round, professor of microbiology and immunology at U of U Health, and senior author on the study. \"So when [Kendra Klag] brought me the first experiment with Turicibacter and the mice were staying really lean, I was like, 'This is so amazing.' It's pretty exciting when you see those types of results.\" Klag is the first author on the study.\n\nThe reason why the bacteria was successful in keeping fat-fed mice thin is due to a feedback loop based on fatty molecules called ceramides. These molecules increase on a high-fat diet and, as they accumulate, they not only cause the gut to increase its absorption of dietary fat, but they push the body toward higher storage of that fat. They also spike blood sugar levels, which leads to insulin resistance. This is why elevated ceramide levels have been linked to type 2 diabetes and heart disease. In some studies, in fact, they've been shown to be better predictors of cardiovascular disease than LDL cholesterol.\n\nSomewhat paradoxically, Turicibacter bacteria also produce lipids (fats) in the gut. But the molecules they produce actually tamp down the rise of ceramides, even in the face of high-fat consumption. Furthermore, when a high-fat diet is consumed, it drowns Turicibacter, eliminating its protective effects. In humans with obesity for example, Turicibacter levels in the gut have been found to be reduced.\n\nRegular supplementation in the study, however, kept the levels of Turicibacter-produced fats high and the mice slim and healthy. The researchers admit that it remains to be seen if the same results carry over to humans, but point to its potential in engineering new ways to combat weight gain.\n\n\"Identifying what lipid is having this effect is going to be one of the most important future directions, both from a scientific perspective because we want to understand how it works, and from a therapeutic standpoint,\" says Round. \"Perhaps we could use this bacterial lipid, which we know really doesn't have a lot of side effects because people have it in their guts, as a way to keep a healthy weight.\"\n\n\"With further investigation of individual microbes, we will be able to make microbes into medicine and find bacteria that are safe to create a consortium of different bugs that people with different diseases might be lacking,\" Klag adds.\n\nThe research has been published in the journal Cell Metabolism.",

    "title": "Trump Was Slammed For Leveling This 'Disgusting' 3-Word Phrase — And It Might Reveal A Lot",
    "description": "People were outraged by the president's recent use of this particular expression. Experts in political science and mental health say the term tells quite the story.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump recently leveled one of his commonly used terms in a statement attacking iconic actor and director Rob Reiner shortly after he and his wife, Michele Singer, were found dead at their home on Sunday.\n\nThe president took to his Truth Social platform on Monday to seize on the opportunity to slam Rob Reiner, who was a critic of Trump, and for baselessly attributing the Hollywood filmmaker’s death to “Trump Derangement Syndrome” — a phrase Trump and his supporters often use to attack those who criticize the president, his policies and his rhetoric.\n\nLife: Psychologists React To THAT Post From Trump About Rob Reiner's Death\n\n“Rob Reiner, a tortured and struggling, but once very talented movie director and comedy star, has passed away, together with his wife, Michele, reportedly due to the anger he caused others through his massive, unyielding, and incurable affliction with a mind crippling disease known as TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME, sometimes referred to as TDS,” Trump wrote in part on the social media platform.\n\nTrump’s vile post about Reiner garnered wide condemnation, with many on social media describinghis remarks as“disgusting.” Rocker Jack White took to Instagram to slam the president, writing: “Trump you disgusting, vile, egomaniac, loser, child. Neither he nor any one of his followers can defend this gross, horrible insult to a beautiful artist who gave the world so much.”\n\nThe president also garnered a rare rebuke from many MAGA supporters and a number of the president’s most loyal advocates. He was further criticized when he doubled down on his attacks on Reiner while speaking to reporters at the Oval Office hours later.\n\nThe concept of a so-called “derangement syndrome” has been used against critics of past presidents before. But Trump has a history of frequently using the phrase against his naysayers himself. He had also used the expression against those who opposed him during his first term as president.\n\nLife: How To Do That 'Defying Gravity' Riff Without Murdering Your Voice\n\nAlexandra Cromer, a licensed professional counselor with Thriveworks, believes that Trump’s habit of leveling the phrase “Trump Derangement Syndrome” reveals a lot about his leadership style.\n\n“It reveals that he is not a leader that values, welcomes, or is willing to receive feedback,” she told HuffPost. “This also is a behavior pattern that we see in people with narcissistic tendencies; projection of perceived criticism onto someone else.”\n\nCromer explained that by Trump calling his critics “deranged,” he’s essentially seeking to undermine “the authenticity of the feedback.”\n\n“This reveals that his leadership style is very rigid and very one-dimensional. He is the one to give directions and all others must comply,” she said. “This is a tremendously unhealthy way to receive criticism or any other form of feedback. Psychologically, we know that feedback is critical to not only growth [and] prosperity, but overall health and wellness.”\n\nLife: The Funniest Posts From Women This Week (Dec. 6-12)\n\nShe later continued, “shutting down criticism by engaging in stereotyping and blaming of the source can also be viewed as abusive behavior — that is, behavior that attempts to inflict psychological harm and maintain power structures.”\n\nHallie Kritsas, a licensed mental health counselor and therapist with Thriveworks who specializes in self-esteem, workplace issues and anxiety, told HuffPost that she believes the term “Trump Derangement Syndrome” is “polarizing and emotionally activating.”\n\n“It comes across as a threat and will more than likely increase stress and divide groups in two different ones versus unifying them,” she said.\n\nJacob Neiheisel, associate professor of political science at the University at Buffalo College of Arts and Sciences, told HuffPost that he thinks Trump’s frequent use of the phrase is “meant to be dismissive of his opposition” and intended to “give his followers cover for dismissing similar criticisms that they might hear.”\n\nLife: The Most Popular Dog Names Of 2025\n\n“I think his use of the term reflects his deep-seated disdain for dissent,” he said. “Trump’s leadership style is certainly not one that is welcoming of a ‘team of rivals’ type of approach, but rather one that demands loyalty and a willingness to do political combat on his behalf.”\n\nNeiheisel thinks that the “Trump Derangement Syndrome” phrase has caught on with so many Trump supporters because it “allows them to adopt a similar orientation toward dissent in their own social environments.”\n\n“Simply dismissing the opposition as having a form of mental illness allows them to protect their own attitudes and beliefs, inoculating them against any negativity directed toward Trump,” he added.\n\nNeiheisel thinks that Trump’s attack on Reiner after his death hit “a new low.”\n\nLife: We Asked Actual Historians About Trump's New Plaques — And They Have THOUGHTS\n\n“Republicans had the moral high ground in the wake of Charlie Kirk’s murder and were able to use the negative things said about Kirk after his death to attack Democrats,” he said. “With Trump’s response, that high ground is gone. I think that’s why we saw a number of Republicans condemning Trump’s remarks.”\n\nKritsas believes that Trump’s statements about the iconic director “violated what some might view as a time to grieve and have decency in a moment of loss.”\n\nCromer said that Trump’s harsh words for Reiner was likely particularly upsetting to so many people because the filmmaker was a “universally liked person.”\n\n“While Rob was not a perfect person (because nobody is), he demonstrated consistent prosocial behavior patterns and centered his personal values at the forefront of his personal and professional life,” she said.\n\n“Further, Trump’s remarks state a belief that someone was murdered because they didn’t like Trump; an assertion that can be viewed as narcissistic by inserting himself into a situation that had nothing to do with him in any contextual way,” she continued.\n\nCromer later added that overall, Trump’s remarks about Reiner “communicates a lack of respect for psychological and personal boundaries for those affected by this incident.”\n\nMedical Examiner Report States Rob And Michele Reiner’s Cause Of Death\n\n2 Of Rob Reiner's Children Release Statement On Parents' Deaths\n\nTrump Blames Rob Reiner For His Own Death In Truth Social Post",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Speaker Mike Johnson had a ready-made refrain when asked why Republicans weren't moving to extend federal health care subsidies: their party wanted to help 100% of Americans with their costs, not just the 7% of Americans enrolled in Affordable Care Act plans.\n\nBut not 100% of his conference agreed.\n\nA rare revolt from the moderate wing of the party has upended Johnson's plans. Four Republicans this week signed onto a Democratic discharge petition that guarantees that the House will vote on extending the ACA subsidies sometime in January, with Republican leaders now powerless to stop it.\n\nFor Democrats, it was vindication of a months-long strategy, starting with the government shutdown in the fall, that pushed the expiration of the ACA support to the forefront of politics. Republicans from competitive districts most at risk of losing their seats in next year's midterms felt the political pressure as they heard from constituents about their skyrocketing premiums.\n\n“Nothing has changed with House Republican leadership, but something has changed within their own ranks,” said Rep. Pete Aguilar, chair of the House Democratic Caucus.\n\nFlanked by his caucus Thursday on the Capitol steps, House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries demanded that Johnson allow a vote on the three-year extension of ACA subsidies before lawmakers leave for the holidays: “Not tomorrow. Not next week. Not next year. Today.”\n\nJohnson refused, saying it will “be on the floor that first week of January when we return.”\n\nLawmakers prepare to leave in limbo\n\nThe impasse left lawmakers with a cliffhanger as they headed home for the holiday break. Republican leaders now face growing pressure to appease centrist members who are threatening to side with Democrats to approve an extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies for three years.\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune has to confront the issue as well. Any ACA bill clearing the House would simply push the fight to the Senate, which has already rejected a three-year extension.\n\nA bipartisan group of senators has been meeting and discussing possible compromise bills that would extend the subsidies but put new limitations on them. But they would not consider anything until January.\n\nThune told reporters Thursday that a three-year extension of “a failed program that’s rife with fraud, waste and abuse is not happening.”\n\nYet Republican leaders in both chambers have not offered a plan that fully addresses members’ concerns about the sharp insurance cost increases many Americans are expected to face in 2026 and potentially beyond.\n\nThe White House has been engaged in discussions about the healthcare proposals but has largely allowed House Republicans to sort out their internal divisions and coalesce around a plan on their own, according to a senior administration official involved in the talks who was granted anonymity to discuss private discussions.\n\nHouse Republicans on Wednesday passed a 100-plus-page health care package centered on long-standing GOP priorities, including expanding coverage options for small businesses and the self-employed. The bill would also rein in pharmacy benefit managers — middlemen that manage drug costs and process insurance claims.\n\nJohnson touted the measure as “a bigger and better and more important thing for 100% of Americans, not just 7% of Americans.” But some Republicans who face tough reelection bids remain fixated on the looming spike in ACA costs.\n\nThe holidays provide Johnson with a brief window to try to persuade moderates to abandon the effort. The discharge petition froze once it reached the 218-signature threshold, meaning that while only four Republicans have publicly signed on, more may be willing to support the Democratic bill.\n\nRep. Ryan Mackenzie, one of the four Republicans who signed the Democratic petition, said it has “generated more conversations” and that “hopefully over the next three weeks, we will actually see some changes in some bipartisan efforts that actually can generate a meaningful vote that gets 218 in the House and 60 in the Senate.”\n\n“I think allowing a vote is critically important,” Mackenzie said. “I think everybody should be able to put up their votes on the board, and they should be able to let everybody in the American public see how they voted on these individual issues.”\n\nLeader Jeffries' waiting game pays off\n\nFor months, Jeffries refused to support a one-year extension of ACA subsidies that a bipartisan group of lawmakers had been pursuing, dismissing it as a “non-starter” and “a laughable proposition.”\n\nInstead, he held firm on a three-year extension with no income caps or cost offsets. That strategy paid off, as GOP moderates were forced to move in his direction when Johnson refused to allow any vote on an ACA extension.\n\nJeffries has faced criticism this year from progressive members of his caucus and grassroots groups who have urged him to push back more forcefully against Trump and Republicans. But on Thursday, much of the party rallied behind him on the Capitol steps, with several lawmakers praising his approach.\n\n“As Leader Jeffries has said all along, this is the only real plan on the table,” said Aguilar.\n\nStill, while Democrats have secured a vote, insurance costs for millions are set to rise next year, and passage of a three-year ACA subsidies extension remains a long shot even if it does pass the House. Senate Republicans have already rejected the three-year extension, but some GOP senators who are open to a deal on the subsidies said a House vote could provide momentum.\n\n“We could have a vehicle — if we could get Republicans and Democrats behind it — then we could send it back,” said GOP Sen. Thom Tillis, adding that it “means that there’s still a chance.”\n\nFor Democrats, the fight has also allowed them to unify around a message they believe could prove potent on the campaign trail.\n\n“The Republican health care crisis is unacceptable, unconscionable, and un-American,” Jeffries said.\n\nThe decision by four Republicans to break with party leadership and join Democrats is only the latest sign of discontent in the narrowly divided House.\n\nJohnson has argued that the criticism directed at his leadership — and lawmakers repeatedly bypassing leadership to force votes — is inevitable given the slim GOP majority. He said he lacks the advantages of a large majority, where “the speaker had a long stick that he would administer punishment.”\n\n“I don’t have that, because we have a small margin,” he said. Of the ACA extensions, Johnson said leadership had “talked about it at length” with GOP moderates, describing the conversations as “some intense fellowship.”\n\n“Everybody’s in good spirits now and everybody understands what’s happening,” he added.\n\nSome GOP members, however, don’t appear to share that assessment. There was lingering discontent as lawmakers headed home for the holidays.\n\n“I don't know how we did not vote on a good bipartisan extension,” said GOP Rep. Don Bacon, adding that Democrats will use the health care issue “like a sledgehammer” on the campaign trail.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., insisted that Republicans are finishing the year “as united as we've ever been.”\n\n“We set out on a course to do big things, not little things, and that means we’re going to have some differences along the way.”",

The winner of said game will likely have the inside track to the conference's No. 1 seed throughout the postseason next month, which obviously means guaranteed homefield advantage and the sole bye week available.\n\nUnfortunately for the Rams, who beat the Seahawks at home earlier this season, they will have to overcome their NFC West rival on the road without one of their best players.\n\nVeteran star receiver Davante Adams is likely to miss Thursday's game with a left hamstring injury. It's a reaggravation of the same injury Adams suffered earlier this season. The Rams apparently don't believe Adams' injury is of a long-term variety. He could theoretically return as soon as next week. But with the postseason around the corner, they're rightfully proceeding with caution so one of their top playmakers is healthy and can play in the biggest games.\n\nEven still, a road game against the team nipping at your heels in the NFC and NFC West is probably the worst game to miss.

    "fullText": "You might want to check your fridge — hundreds of thousands of cases of shredded cheese sold across the country have been recalled due to contamination concerns.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration said Great Lakes Cheese Co. recalled more than 260,000 cases of shredded cheese because they may contain metal fragments, according to AP News.\n\nThe recall includes various cheese types sold in stores like Target, Aldi, and Walmart.\n\nPer the FDA website, the recall has a Class II classification, which means the product \"may cause temporary or medically reversible adverse health consequences or where the probability of serious adverse health consequences is remote.\"\n\nHealth officials said metal fragments may cause dental damage or other injuries to the mouth or intestines if ingested.\n\nAP News reported that the shredded cheese was sold in 31 states and Puerto Rico.\n\nAccording to Delish, the FDA issued 241 food and beverage recalls in 2024 — an 8% increase from the year before. Additionally, the number of people who fell ill or died from food contamination doubled.\n\nA major concern surrounding food production and packaging is the use of plastic. Per CNN, plastic packaging can shed microplastics and nanoplastics when you unwrap cheese or open the caps on bottles. Microplastics are tiny particles that have a large impact.\n\nAccording to Stanford researchers, about 10 million to 40 million metric tons of microplastics are released into the environment annually. Studies have linked microplastics exposure to cancer, heart attacks, and a variety of other health issues in humans and animals.\n\nResearchers continue to study the damaging impacts of plastic packaging. Moving away from plastic in food production would likely reduce the risk of accidents that lead to food contamination.\n\nDo you worry about having toxic forever chemicals in your home?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nWhile the United Nations failed to solidify a treaty for plastic production and waste in 2025, global leaders in food and packaging later signed the 2030 Plastic Agenda for Business. The companies involved represent 20% of global plastic packaging.\n\nMeanwhile, you can reduce your exposure to plastic in food by making simple changes at home. Consumer Reports recommended that consumers avoid plastic food containers and replace them with more sustainable options, such as glass or silicone.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "Coca-Cola is under the microscope as experts sound the alarm over the drink's health risks.\n\nWhile the sugar content in soda is no surprise, researchers are now pinpointing exactly what happens to your body when you drink a can of regular Coca-Cola.\n\nNew studies are scrutinizing Coca-Cola, as researchers are linking the drink to fatty liver disease, Type 2 diabetes, and heart disease, The Telegraph reported.\n\nA study published in Nature Medicine, for example, linked millions of Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease cases to sugar-based beverages. Likewise, a study conducted by a group of Swedish researchers has gone so far as to directly condemn the sugar drink industry for cases of cardiovascular disease.\n\nWhen you drink a can of regular Coca-Cola, your body experiences a sugar rush within the first hour of consumption. Since Coca-Cola contains caffeine as well as sugar, drinking soda consistently can also cause you to develop a \"degree of dependence,\" per the Telegraph. This dependency can then cause some consistent cola drinkers to \"wean themselves off it gradually to lessen the effects of the caffeine and sugar withdrawal.\"\n\nThe new research reinforces the health risks of regularly drinking Coca-Cola. What's worse, in the United Kingdom, experts are also calling out the country's food labeling system, which gives Coca-Cola three green traffic lights, a label that is misleading for consumers.\n\n\"Coke is just through the roof [for sugar],\" specialist registered dietitian Nichola Ludlam-Raine told the Telegraph. \"In my opinion, it shouldn't be allowed to be sold.\"\n\nFrom an environmental perspective, Coca-Cola is the world's leading producer of branded plastic waste, and while the company has taken some steps to mitigate its plastic waste, it still has a significant way to go.\n\nResearchers are continuing to study the long-term impacts of drinking soda, adding to the growing pile of evidence underscoring the health risks.\n\nTo protect yourself from these risks, you can reduce your soda intake. Health experts also suggest swapping out that can of Coca-Cola for a healthier alternative, such as fizzy water.\n\nDo you worry about having toxic forever chemicals in your home?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "While some live for the city hustle, others find the best place to be somewhere quiet, calm, and away from urban chaos.\n\nAs more Americans turn to rural towns and suburbs to settle down in, local charm is regaining its luster.\n\nA recent WalletHub study surveyed 1,318 small cities across the US — defined as cities with populations sized between 25,000 and 100,000 people — and compared them across categories including affordability, economy, health, education, and quality of life.\n\nThe affordability rank of each city was determined by looking at its average housing cost, homeownership rate, household income, and cost of living, among other metrics, according to the study's methodology section.\n\nEconomic health was measured using metrics such as population, income, and job growth rates, as well as unemployment rates, average debt and bankruptcy rates, and median credit scores.\n\nFor the education and health rankings, WalletHub examined metrics such as graduation rates, rates of obese and physically inactive adults, insured population, and other health indicators. They also used a school-system quality metric based on previous WalletHub research.\n\nThe quality of life ranking took into account factors such as average commute time and work hours, as well as the number of restaurants, bars, clubs, and other attractions per capita. Each city's safety ranking was determined using rates like violent and property crime, car crashes, pedestrian deaths, and drug poisoning deaths.\n\nThe study utilized data from the US Census Bureau, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, as well as data from companies such as Areavibes, TransUnion, TripAdvisor, Yelp, and WalletHub.\n\nOf the over 1,000 cities, 19 received scores that ranked in the top percentile across the various categories.\n\nSee the places that WalletHub ranked as being the top small cities in the US in 2025.\n\nLancaster, Pennsylvania, had the highest quality of life ranking among the top cities, placing within the top 10 nationwide.\n\nAlthough Arlington, Massachusetts — located six miles outside Boston — is among the top five most unaffordable cities in the top-performing cities, it ranked second-best in education and health out of all 1,318 cities in the study.\n\nLexington, Massachusetts, was ranked as having the best education and health in the nation in the study.

    "description": "We're really into minimalism, so we started furniture-free living four years ago. I've noticed health benefits, like better balance and strength.",
    "fullText": "My wife and I live in a pretty garden apartment that's almost entirely devoid of furniture. The closest things we have are a bamboo laptop table and two single camping mattresses.\n\nAt our ages — 57 and 60 — we're expected to invest in matching La-Z-Boys and TV trays, but we spend most of our time on the floor on yoga mats. Honestly, we've never been happier.\n\nIf you'd told me this was what the future held for us back when we were lounging on our L-shaped couch in 2020, I'd have suggested you reduce the strength of your edibles. As much as we still dream about that comfortable couch, though, we wouldn't take it back.\n\nLife without furniture comes with an array of benefits, both expected and unexpected, and they're not worth trading for modern-day creature comforts.\n\nEver since inadvertently becoming minimalists in 2008, we've made a point of engaging in lifestyle experiments, but it had never occurred to us to eschew furniture.\n\nThen, I listened to a podcast about furniture-free living. I was immediately intrigued, but my wife wasn't as easily convinced.\n\nThe idea wasn't one we could entertain anyway, since we were about to move to a fully-furnished cottage in the middle of nowhere. Life has a way of giving you what you need, though, and the country wasn't for us.\n\nFive months later, we were back in Cape Town's city bowl, on the hunt for new digs.\n\nWhen a stunning, affordable, and unfurnished apartment showed up in my inbox, I took it as a sign that it was time to give furniture-free living a try.\n\nThe lush, bee-friendly garden with a towering pine tree won my wife over immediately. I didn't even have to say a word; I suspect she'd have agreed even if it meant sleeping outside in a tent.\n\nWe made some mistakes at first. Initially, we bought a cheap, low-level futon to sleep on, but it proved a poor choice for our backs, and we soon ditched it in favor of our camping mattresses.\n\nOur intention was always to buy a tatami sleeping mat down the line, but our frugal \"if it ain't broke\" selves keep deferring the purchase.\n\nRight from the get-go, we both loved hanging out on the floor, and it just felt right.\n\nWithin about a month, we began to feel physically stronger — probably because we were constantly getting up and down from floor level and forced to work on our posture.\n\nWithout a cushy office chair to sink into for hours at a stretch, we're naturally reminded to change position or get up and move.\n\nPlus, our balance has improved because we've trained ourselves to get up and sit down without the help of our hands. We can also sit unsupported for extended periods.\n\nPractically, no furniture makes moving homes — something we've done more than once in the past few years — a breeze. It makes sense for us to live in a way that supports our perpetual desire for change.\n\nWith nothing to move, housework is also ridiculously easy. Plus, our apartment always looks neat.\n\nProbably the best benefit, though, is that our quirky rescue kitty seems to love our furniture-free life. He prefers to tunnel under our legs rather than sit on our laps — and being on the floor gives him a lot of chances to do this.\n\nWhen we tell people about our lifestyle, the same concern always comes up: How do you entertain? The truth is, we don't.\n\nThis way of life isn't for everyone, and the last thing we'd want is to make our guests feel uncomfortable. So, we've found middle ground by meeting for walks or going out for coffee or a meal. It might not work for everyone, but it works for us.\n\nIronically, our next lifestyle experiment — which we're tentatively planning for late 2026 — means going back to a bed and couch, but only because you can't do without either when you live in a van.\n\nWell, technically you could … but even we're not up for that level of discomfort.",

    "fullText": "Exclusive: UK government’s ‘naive belief’ that Trump is a good faith actor ‘could cost UK taxpayer billions’, says health select committee chair\n\nMinisters and senior MPs have warned that the UK’s agreements with Donald Trump are “built on sand” after the Guardian established that the deal to avoid drug tariffs has no underlying text beyond limited headline terms.\n\nThe “milestone” US-UK deal announced this month on pharmaceuticals, which will mean the NHS pays more for medicines in exchange for a promise of zero tariffs on the industry, still lacks a legal footing beyond top lines contained in two government press releases.\n\nConcerns over the basis of the agreement have been heightened by Washington’s decision to suspend the £31bn “tech prosperity deal”, which had been hailed as “a generational step-change in our relationship with the US”. The deal was paused after the US claimed a lack of progress from the UK in lowering trade barriers in other areas.\n\nIt has also emerged that concessions to British farmers made in the first tariff deal with Trump, which were hailed as “historic” by Keir Starmer in May, have yet to be signed off by the US despite a looming January deadline.\n\nThe health department said that negotiators were now thrashing out the detailed agreement on the pharmaceutical deal. Asked to provide the headline terms, the department shared its press release hailing the “landmark UK-US pharmaceuticals deal” and a link to the equivalent US government announcement of an “agreement in principle” on pharmaceutical pricing.\n\nCritics have noted that the two releases describe the deal in sharply different terms. The British release describes the UK as “the only country in the world to secure a 0% tariff on pharmaceuticals to the US”, while the American one largely focuses on how the NHS will have to pay 25% more for new medicines.\n\nDavid Henig, a trade expert, said: “There is a serious risk that the UK government has made commitments to raise drug prices in return for nothing more than a verbal promise from President Trump around zero tariffs, when we know he has form for not honouring his word.\n\n“The role of private companies in possibly working with the US administration to coerce the UK government by threatening to withdraw investments is also a big worry. None of this is normal in international trade policy and the government needs to explain both this deal and how such things will be avoided in the future.”\n\nOrdinarily, negotiators would sign a provisional legal text, which would then go through detailed checks on both sides, but none exists yet with the US on pharmaceuticals.\n\nMinisters privately told the Guardian there were concerns that the government’s agreements with the US were flimsy and unreliable.\n\nOne said there was a concern that the UK’s series of agreements with the Trump administration were “built on sand”. Another said this instability was the “new normal now in our relationship across the pond” with “additional layers of volatility and unpredictability in the system”.\n\nLayla Moran, who chairs the health select committee, said: “The only thing more surprising than Trump’s tween-level temper tantrums is the UK government’s naive belief that his administration is a good faith actor. The NHS is too precious to be gambled with and the concern now is whether the deal that could already cost the UK taxpayer billions could end up costing a lot more if it collapses in chaos.”\n\nLiam Byrne, who chairs the business and trade select committee, said ministers had to focus on getting the tech prosperity deal “back on track”.\n\nGovernment figures downplayed the chances of the US reneging on the pharma deal, which took weeks longer to finalise than expected. One source said the US pharmaceutical industry had been pushing for the agreement as they wanted certainty on imports and drug prices, while by comparison the tech prosperity deal “was always quite abstract”.\n\nOfficials admit that, more broadly, volatility is part and parcel of dealing with the Trump administration. But they note that through the deals it has signed, the UK has secured concrete outcomes for businesses.\n\n“The fact we have 25% steel tariffs, and that’s better than the rest of the world, is not flimsy. The same thing with our auto rate,” one official said. “We are in a more competitive position than other major economies.”\n\nIssues have emerged in the implementation of the landmark US-UK tariff deal agreed last May, however, with quotas on beef exports that were due to kick in next month still not formally approved.\n\nTom Bradshaw, the president of the National Farmers’ Union, said: “Our understanding is that the US has not yet signed off the 13,000 reciprocal tariff rate quota. With the US already having access to our beef market for non-hormone treated beef, we are pushing to make sure UK beef producers can access the reciprocal quota from 1 January as agreed.\n\n“This is particularly important as we know there is still great pressure from other sectors of the economy to reopen US negotiations, and that our government is looking at what more can be done with the US. We urge the government to keep pushing to get the reciprocal quota over the line before the end of the year to ensure it can’t continue to be used as a bargaining chip.”\n\nApart from introducing a 10% tariff on most British exports – lower than the rate paid by other countries – the deal was to “remove tariffs on British steel and aluminium, reducing them to zero”. This aspect of the agreement has not materialised, with tariffs on British steel remaining at 25%, although other countries pay a rate of 50%.\n\nOne industry leader said the discussions on steel tariffs “were not going anywhere” but that they considered this week’s bump in the road to be a matter of the “US blustering because of frustration with the UK not moving fast enough in other areas”.\n\nThe US informed the UK it was pausing the tech prosperity deal over wider trade disagreements last week before Peter Kyle, the trade secretary, held meetings with senior US officials in Washington, including commerce secretary Howard Lutnick.\n\nSeveral officials said those meetings were “very positive”. The two sides have agreed to resume negotiations in January.\n\nA government spokesperson said: “Our special relationship with the US remains strong and the trade secretary held talks last week in the US with counterparts to keep up the momentum on implementing all aspects of the UK-US deal so businesses on both sides of the Atlantic continue to feel the benefits.\n\n“We have already delivered 0% tariffs for the UK pharma and aerospace sectors and cut auto tariffs to 10% within quota, saving hundreds of millions of pounds on UK exports, with the US confirming changes via federal notices.\n\n“The UK is also the only country to have avoided 50% steel and aluminium tariffs, but we are committed to going further to secure jobs and creating opportunities for businesses, and at the state visit we unveiled commercial deals creating more than 7,600 high-quality jobs and accelerating growth.”",

    "fullText": "Washington — The House won't vote this week on an extension to the Affordable Care Act's enhanced premium subsidies, which lapse at the end of the year.\n\nAn 11th-hour effort by moderate Republicans to put an extension on the floor for a vote failed Tuesday night, when the House Rules Committee blocked several of the amendments they were seeking to the attach to a GOP health care plan released last week. The GOP plan does not include an extension.\n\nThe committee advanced the bill to the floor late Tuesday. A vote is expected Wednesday.\n\nModerate Republicans are perplexed at the decision not to hold a vote on an extension ahead of the Dec. 31 deadline, and have warned of the political ramifications of allowing insurance premiums to soar in the new year for more than 20 million Americans who buy their insurance on Affordable Care Act marketplaces.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson appeared to shut the door on any amendment votes earlier Tuesday, only to open it slightly after a heated meeting with moderates.\n\n\"We looked for a way to try to allow for that pressure-release valve, and it just was not to be. We worked on it all the way through the weekend,\" Johnson told reporters Tuesday morning.\n\nThe Louisiana Republican later said \"there's some ideas on the table that could work.\"\n\nModerate Republicans expressed their frustration throughout the day.\n\n\"I am pissed for the American people. This is absolute bulls--t,\" Republican Rep. Mike Lawler of New York told reporters after leaving a GOP conference meeting Tuesday morning.\n\nLawler called it a \"tremendous mistake\" not to address the expiring tax credits.\n\n\"The Democrats want to use this as an issue in the election, and seemingly the Republican leadership is going to allow them to do it. And it's idiotic,\" he said.\n\nHe urged all Democrats to sign on to two bipartisan discharge petitions to force votes on legislation to extend the tax credits for one to two years with reforms. But even if the discharge petitions hit the 218-signature threshold needed to force a vote in the coming days, there's a waiting period of seven legislative days before a member can call it up to the floor. The House's last day in session this year is Friday.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, has said that Republicans should offer up the votes on a Democratic discharge petition to extend the tax credits for three years without reforms. It needs to secure the support of four Republicans to force a vote.\n\nGOP Rep. Kevin Kiley of California said he hasn't ruled out supporting Democrats' discharge petition.\n\n\"We waited until the very end of the year to just kind of hastily throw together some narrow package to try to make it look like something's being done about health care when this bill is likely not going to become law and it doesn't address the immediate crisis in front of us, or 22 million people,\" he said of the GOP plan.\n\nDuring Tuesday's Rules Committee meeting, Republican Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania said the only thing worse than an extension without any reforms is no extension at all.\n\nNick Reiner, son of Rob Reiner and his wife Michele, arrested, jail records show\n\nDetails on Nick Reiner's arrest for murders of Rob Reiner and his wife, Michele\n\nWhat we know after Rob and Michele Reiner's son Nick arrested in their deaths",

    "fullText": "House Republicans on Wednesday approved a narrow package designed to lower health care costs for some Americans in the coming years – marking a win for leadership even as some of their own members complain it falls woefully short of tackling rising prices in 2026.\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson and his team were aggressive in pushing their health care plan to the floor this week, vowing it will be the first step of a major GOP agenda on lowering costs next year.\n\nThey are specifically ignoring, however, the issue of the expiring enhanced Obamacare subsidies that were passed during the pandemic to help people afford premium costs. Those tax credits will expire at the end of the month, spiking premiums for tens of millions of Americans next year.\n\nThe House GOP package, instead, would allow small businesses — as well as self-employed people — to band together across industries to buy coverage through association health plans in an effort to lower premiums. It would also, once again, provide federal funding for the cost-sharing subsidies that lower-income Obamacare enrollees receive to reduce their deductibles and out-of-pocket costs for care.\n\nHouse Republicans would also require pharmacy benefit managers, which act as middlemen between drugmakers and insurers or employers, to provide employers with data on the price of drugs, the rebates they receive from manufacturers and other operations.\n\nThe House voted 216-211 to send the measure to the Senate, which is not expected to vote on it before lawmakers leave town for the holiday recess.\n\nThe last-minute health care push from GOP leaders comes at a fraught moment for the party: President Donald Trump is striving to show he is making progress to lower costs for everyday Americans. But his own members are attacking Johnson and other GOP leaders for ignoring the looming Obamacare subsidies cliff, which would raise costs for tens of millions of Americans starting in January.\n\nIf the enhanced subsidies lapse, enrollees will see their annual premium payments increase by 114% — or about $1,000 — on average in 2026, according to KFF, a nonpartisan health policy research group. Roughly 2 million more people are also expected to be uninsured next year if the subsidies end, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The more generous assistance was enacted in 2021 as part of a Biden administration Covid-19 relief package.\n\nA group of GOP centrists have been pressuring Johnson for months to reverse course on the subsidies — pushing bipartisan efforts to extend the subsidies while adding “guardrails” to ensure the dollars are not misused.\n\nBut Johnson has only dug in. Those centrists then decided Wednesday to openly defy Johnson and potentially issue him a humiliating defeat in January by signing onto a Democratic effort to extend the subsidies for three years. That plan from House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries is detested by most Republicans because it includes no reforms.\n\nBut centrists insist they had no other options to keep the money flowing in January – and prevent millions from losing coverage altogether – after party leaders repeatedly blocked their attempts to get a floor vote on the compromise proposals.",

    "fullText": "Another day, another update that's giving investors anxiety about the AI trade.\n\nThe US tech sector was under pressure on Wednesday as traders took in a report from The Financial Times that said Blue Owl Capital wouldn't back a $10 billion data center the company was planning to build in Michigan for OpenAI.\n\nOracle shares led the broader market lower, falling as much as 6% Wednesday. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite shed more than 1%.\n\nHere's where US indexes stood shortly around 1:00 p.m. ET on Wednesday:\n\nHere were the other notable moves in the market:\n\nThe latest developments extend a broader rotation out of the market's most expensive tech stocks and into other parts of the market.\n\nThe enthusiasm for AI has dampened particularly in the past week, Adam Turnquist, the chief technical strategist at LPL Financial, said on Wednesday.\n\n\"Additionally, rotation pressure out of tech has accelerated, with positioning data showing rising demand for smaller-cap and value stocks,\" Turnquist said of the latest market moves.\n\nThe FT's report said that talks between Oracle and Blue Owl Capital stalled over the planned data center. The private credit firm will not move forward with funding the project due to concerns about Oracle's hefty AI spending and growing debts, sources told the outlet.\n\nOracle disputed the contents of the FT report.\n\n\"The FT story is incorrect. Our development partner, Related Digital, selected the best equity partner from a competitive group of options, which in this instance was not Blue Owl. Final negotiations for their equity deal are moving forward on schedule and according to plan,\" Michael Egbert, a spokesperson for Oracle, told Business Insider in an email.\n\nIt's been a rough few months for the AI trade, but particularly for Oracle. After impressing investors with an aggressive revenue forecast, the stock has declined steadily in the last two months as the company stokes more concerns about the large amounts of debt coursing through the AI space. Shares are down 45% from their peak in early September.\n\nOracle recently triggered another sell-off in tech after reporting lower-than-expected earnings and pledging to increase its capital expenditures more than expected in the coming year.\n\nCoreWeave is the other prominent tech name to join Oracle recently as a poster child of investors' growing anxieties about the health of the AI trade. Similar to Oracle, CoreWeave has spooked investors with its high debt load and reliance on a handful of customers. As of Wednesday afternoon, the stock is down 66% from its post-IPO high reached in June.",

    "description": "“I don't even know how it's been approved, to be honest,” said boxing world champ Skye Nicolson.",
    "fullText": "Anthony Joshua will make quick work of Jake Paul when the fighters collide atop a Netflix show at the Kaseya Center in Miami, Florida, this Friday, Dec. 19.\n\nThat’s according to former WBC featherweight world champion and current WBC interim super bantamweight titleholder Skye Nicolson, a Matchroom stablemate of Joshua’s, who told Uncrowned on Tuesday that “it’s going to be very one-sided, and over early, in favor of Anthony Joshua.”\n\nThe fight represents a considerable step-up for Paul, who has feasted mostly on a diet of past-their-prime MMA fighters and journeymen boxers in the boxing ring.\n\nHis sole loss came against Tommy Fury in 2023, but he has since rebounded with visible improvements and wins over Mike Perry, a 58-year-old Mike Tyson, and a 39-year-old Julio Cesar Chavez Jr., the latter of whom is a former middleweight world champion.\n\nRegardless, the gulf in amateur background, skill set and accomplishments between Paul and Joshua, a former two-time heavyweight king, is vast. And Joshua is the heavy betting favorite for a reason.\n\nNicolson commended Paul for his “almost delu-lu confidence” but said she couldn’t “see it going any other way apart from a very one-sided early finish” because “it's [a] scarily dangerous” matchup for Paul.\n\n“I don't even know how it's been approved, to be honest, but I guess money talks,” Nicolson said on Uncrowned's \"The Ariel Helwani Show.\" “We'll see on Friday, but I don't see what Jake's seeing.”\n\nOne of the things Paul perhaps sees is Joshua’s apparent struggles when dealing with fighting smaller heavyweights, as 6-foot-2 fighter Andy Ruiz Jr. shook up the world by upsetting Joshua in 2019, before 6-foot-3 Oleksandr Usyk toppled \"AJ\" in back-to-back bouts in 2022 to 2023.\n\n“Ruiz, Usyk … Jake Paul? There's levels,\" Nicolson said.\n\nShe then reiterated her prediction for the fight, and that it would represent a poor reflection for the sport of boxing if it even went the distance. “If it goes past two rounds, I will be shocked,” she said.\n\nNicolson continued: “I think [Paul's] improved. He works really, really hard. He’s putting his absolute all into it. You can't knock any of the effort, but there are levels. And [Joshua] is not an Olympic gold medalist and a former world champion for nothing. He's naturally huge. And Jake Paul's not. If it goes past two rounds, I will be very shocked.”\n\nNicolson finished by remarking that the only acceptable result for boxing, and for Joshua, is for the Brit to batter Paul. “If he goes the distance with Jake Paul, it’s not good for boxing,” she said.\n\n“It’s good for boxing if he doesn’t kill Jake, obviously, which is possible. But … if it goes eight whole rounds and he doesn’t knock out Jake, that will definitely be tainting to AJ’s legacy.”\n\nThe Paul vs. Joshua main card airs Friday on Netflix from 8 p.m. ET. Join Uncrowned on the night for live results, round-by-round coverage and highlights.",

    "description": "Health insurance costs are expected to rise in 2026 as ACA subsidies expire and new rules take effect. Here's what enrollees need to know.",
    "fullText": "As 2025 comes to a close, Americans are decorating for the holidays and agonizing over which health insurance plan to choose.\n\nThe decisions are complex and personal, as enrollees think about which plans best fit their income and medical needs. And, regardless of whether they have private or public coverage, most households are budgeting for higher costs.\n\nHere's what to know about insurance plans, enrollment deadlines, and policy changes in the new year.\n\nMost Americans have private, employer-sponsored health insurance or a government-based plan. Nearly all of these programs have active enrollment, meaning that people need to \n\nFor Affordable Care Act plans, the enrollment deadline was December 15, with some options to make changes until January 15 for a later coverage start date. The Medicare enrollment deadline for older Americans was December 7. Most coverage begins January 1.\n\nDeadlines for employer-based plans vary, but open enrollment tends to start November 1 and close in late November or early December, with coverage beginning on January 1.\n\nOnce Americans select their 2026 healthcare plan, they generally aren't able to change their coverage until the next open enrollment cycle. Missing open enrollment means you will need to wait until next year to \n\nPeople with qualifying life events, however, can adjust their plan if they file necessary paperwork with the government or their employer at any time throughout the year. Qualifying life events include a marriage, divorce, new baby, move, job loss, or major change of income.\n\nMedicaid rules are different from other insurance plans because it is income based. Americans can enroll in the program on a rolling basis throughout the year if they meet the qualifying criteria.\n\nBoth Medicare and Medicaid are government-based health insurance plans, though they serve different demographics.\n\nMedicare is typically for Americans age 65 and older, many of whom also receive Social Security — though some people with disabilities are also eligible. The program has four main plan types: Parts A and Part B are standalone insurance that cover inpatient and outpatient care; Medicare Advantage allows older Americans to join private plans governed by Medicare rules and out-of-pocket caps; and Part D is supplemental insurance that covers prescription drugs and basic provider visits.\n\nMedicaid is federally-funded health insurance for low-income households. The qualification threshold varies slightly by state, but tends to be based on the poverty line — which is $32,150 for a family of four. Most states have cutoffs between 138% and 260% of that level. These plans typically cover preventative visits, inpatient and outpatient care, and prescription drugs.\n\nIt's possible for low-income older adults to enroll in Medicare and Medicaid at the same time.\n\nSome families and pregnant women who earn above the Medicaid threshold but not enough for private insurance can also enroll in The Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). The requirements are different in every state, but are usually between 170% and 400% of the federal poverty line.\n\nThere are no income limits to enroll in marketplace insurance.\n\nIncome does come into play when deciding whether or not enrollees will receive tax credits that make their marketplace coverage more affordable. Between 2021 and 2025, Americans had access to enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies. These credits lowered care and premium costs for low- and middle-income households based on their proximity to the federal poverty line.\n\nMarketplace insurance will still be available to Americans regardless of income in 2026, though it's likely that Congress will not extend the subsidies beyond their December 31 expiration date. Republican and Democratic senators are meeting this week to discuss the issue and plan to make a final announcement before they leave office on December 18. If the subsidies aren't renewed, it could make the cost of marketplace insurance skyrocket for many low- and middle-income enrollees and some may be priced out of coverage.\n\nEPO plans are often the cheapest option for private coverage, with low or nonexistent premiums. Americans may choose this coverage because it's more affordable to maintain, though the plans tend to be restrictive about care. Enrollees are required to see only in-network providers and may also need to seek in-network emergency care. If someone on an EPO plan sees an out-of-network provider or pharmacist, they're likely to be fully responsible for cost out of pocket.\n\nPPO plans have more flexibility but a higher price tag. The in-network coverage available to enrollees offers more doctor, clinic, and pharmacy options, and allows people to go out of network when needed. Though premiums are more expensive, these plans tend to be a better fit for Americans with chronic health conditions or ongoing prescription needs.\n\nHMO plans usually have a low monthly premium, but enrollees are limited to in-network providers except in emergency situations. These plans are best for older Americans who need preventative care, but don't have chronic conditions and rarely need to see a specialist. These plans are also common among older Americans with Medicare Advantage.\n\nAmericans aren't able to change their health coverage between EPO, PPO, or HMO plans once open enrollment ends, except if they have a qualifying life event.\n\nCosts for both private and public health insurance are expected to rise in the new year. This is due to a combination of factors: ACA subsidies are set to expire for marketplace plans, President Donald Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act is set to limit Medicaid funding, and the price of private health insurance is rising for companies — a burden that many are partially passing to employees.\n\nThough actual cost changes will vary widely, it's likely that Americans will experience higher premiums and deductibles for care going forward.",

But in the grand scheme of your health, concrete research shows it's better to have the occasional sugar-bomb hot cocoa (mini marshmallows and all) than knock back a cup of the \"healthy\" stuff every night.\n\nBecause cacao beans have high levels of heart-healthy antioxidants and flavanols, dark chocolate (the kind with the least sugar) was promoted as a health food for years.\n\nMany headlines missed the nuances — primarily that relying on chocolate for nutrients isn't a good idea. \"I don't think anybody is going to eat enough chocolate to bring their cholesterol and blood pressure down without doing a lot of other damage to blood sugar, weight, and things like that,\" Lauren Gilstrap, MD, a cardiologist at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Health Center, previously told Business Insider.\n\nFurthermore, she said that the healthiest dark chocolate contains an 80% or more concentration of cacao — more of a bitter brick than a Godiva truffle.\n\nIf one is determined to chug goblets of 90% pure cacao for the sake of lowering their biological age, they're free to try. But there are other downsides to painstakingly fixating on longevity.\n\nIt's a problem Dr. Steven Austad, the scientific director of a nonprofit researching healthy aging, has increasingly noticed in his field. \"If you spend all your time thinking about how long you're going to live, you kind of forget to live,\" he previously told Business Insider.\n\nOverall, Glenn said that most of the aforementioned hot chocolate powders are fine to take at the recommended doses because, again, they already contain low levels of each supplement.\n\nHe said that out of all the hot chocolates, Ballerina Farm's appeared to be the only one with added sugar — something to consider for those trying to cut back.\n\nThe only cocoa Glenn advised thinking about was the powder from Beam, which contains melatonin and is marketed as a nightly supplement.\n\n\"Psychologically, people can be like, 'well, if I don't have this, I can't sleep well,'\" he said. \"I don't recommend people take melatonin every day, I don't think that's a good idea.\" Beam did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nHe said the biggest question to ask yourself is what problem you're trying to fix, and how the supplement will help. Otherwise, you fall into the trap of over-optimizing — or just wasting money.\n\n\"There's this longevity boom right now,\" he said. \"'If you're not doing infrared and sauna and cold baths and have a 15-supplement stack, you're probably going to die tomorrow.' We kind of lose the plot.\"\n\nThe great news is you don't need to drink optimized hot cocoa for better health (unless you genuinely love the flavor).\n\nPlenty of centenarians drink alcohol and eat sweets, both in moderation. The more meaningful secrets to a long life are less about scrutinizing your hot chocolate ingredients and more about the basics: exercising regularly, eating as many whole foods as you can, getting enough sleep, and spending time with loved ones.\n\nGlenn echoed the same, noting that supplements can only provide \"micro benefits\" to an already healthy lifestyle.\n\n\"If you're trying to use this hot cocoa supplement because you're staying up till 3:00 AM streaming Netflix and you feel sleepy, that's not how it works,\" he said.\n\nSo have that powdered hot chocolate that brings you back to your childhood snow days, before you had an airtight morning routine. Better yet: clink that mug with a friend.",

    "fullText": "(This is an excerpt of the Health Rounds newsletter, where we present latest medical studies on Tuesdays and Thursdays)\n\nDec 17 (Reuters) - Applying an insecticide treatment used for soldiers’ uniforms to the cloths used to carry babies significantly reduced incidence of malaria in the ​children, researchers found.\n\nThe six-month study conducted in regions of Uganda where malaria is endemic included 400 mothers and their babies, ages 6 ‌months to 18 months. Half were randomly assigned to use cotton cloth wraps treated with Sawyer Products’ permethrin, while the others received cloths treated with plain water as a control group. ‌The wraps underwent retreatment every 4 weeks.\n\nAll of the pairs received insecticide-treated sleeping nets.\n\nThe permethrin-treated baby wraps reduced malaria cases in infants by 66%, according to a report of the study published in The New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nAdverse events were mild, and the frequency was low and similar in the treatment group and the sham group, the report said.\n\n“Given the anticipated duration and frequency of use... extended follow-up of children, particularly for neurodevelopmental effects of permethrin exposure, is needed,” the researchers ⁠acknowledge.\n\n“Yet malaria, both severe and uncomplicated forms, can cause ‌long-term cognitive impairment, and a careful weighing of potential risks and benefits will be required.”\n\nAI REQUIRES NUANCED TRAINING TO FIND CANCER IN LOWER-RISK GROUPS\n\nTwo recent studies highlight the potential for artificial intelligence tools to be less accurate in some patients ‍than others, if the tools are not trained properly.\n\nIt’s well known that if AI tools are trained on data collected from unequal proportions of patients from various demographic groups, they have a harder time making an accurate diagnosis in minority groups that aren’t well-represented in the training set.\n\nBut in the current analysis, the models sometimes performed worse in ​one demographic group even when the sample sizes were comparable, researchers reported in Cell Reports Medicine.\n\nThe reason may be that some cancers are more ‌common in certain groups, so the models become better at making a diagnosis in those groups. As a result, the models may have difficulty diagnosing cancers in populations where they aren’t as common, the researchers discovered.\n\nIn addition, subtle molecular differences may exist in biopsy samples from different demographic groups, and AI may detect those differences and use them as a proxy for cancer type, potentially making it less effective at diagnosis in populations in which these mutations are less common.\n\n“We found that because AI is so powerful, it can differentiate many obscure biological signals that cannot be detected by standard human evaluation,” study ⁠leader Kun-Hsing Yu of Harvard Medical School said in a statement.\n\nAs a result, the models ​may pick up signals that are more related to demographics than disease - and inferring demographic ​information from pathology slides could affect their diagnostic ability across groups.\n\nTogether, Yu said, these explanations suggest that bias in pathology AI stems not only from the variable quality of the training data but also from how researchers train the models.\n\nWhen his ‍team applied a new framework to the ⁠models they'd tested, it reduced the diagnostic disparities by some 88%, they said.\n\n“We show that by making this small adjustment, the models can learn robust features that make them more generalizable and fairer across different populations,” Yu said.\n\nThe finding is encouraging, he added, because it suggests ⁠that bias can be reduced even without training the models on completely fair, representative data.\n\nIn a separate study published in PLOS Biology, researchers found that even with broad samples of bacterial ‌populations, bias may be blocking the potential of AI to predict and combat antibiotic resistance.\n\n(To receive the full newsletter in your ‌inbox for free",

    "description": "The startup aims to fully automate front-office healthcare tasks for independent provider groups with AI.",
    "fullText": "When Valerie Health CEO Peter Shalek demos his product to clinicians, he has an unusual pitch: \"This is a weird demo, because you'll never have to use this software.\"\n\nValerie Health, which Shalek cofounded alongside Uber Health founder Nitin Joshi, aims to fully automate time-consuming front-office tasks in healthcare, such as referrals and patient scheduling.\n\nIt's taking over those tasks for independent provider groups, a focus that's helping the startup rack up new revenue — and new venture funding.\n\nValerie Health just raised $30 million in Series A funding led by Redpoint Ventures, the company said Tuesday. The raise brings Valerie Health's total funding to $39 million since its 2024 founding.\n\nShalek said Valerie Health is already working with several of the nation's largest independent provider groups, in areas ranging from urology and podiatry to cardiology.\n\nAcross specialties, the front-office challenges for provider groups are often the same, Shalek said: juggling patient intakes and follow-ups against a backlog of referrals.\n\nThose administrative burdens and related financial pressures can lead provider groups to be acquired by hospitals or consolidated by private equity firms. But those deals can mean higher costs for patients and lower satisfaction for the clinicians impacted. Shalek wants Valerie Health to help providers thrive independently.\n\n\"I think that there's an opportunity to make it so that independent practice is the easiest, the highest quality, the most profitable place to deliver care, which is really the core mission we have,\" he said.\n\nValerie Health takes over tasks for healthcare front offices with its own employees in the loop to review the software's autonomous actions.\n\nShalek said Valerie Health helps practices grow, too, by processing new and existing patients faster to increase the volume of patients coming in by 5% to 7% on average.\n\nThe startup has plenty of competition. More companies are setting out to automate administrative tasks for hospitals and healthcare practices, such as the Andreessen Horowitz-backed startup Tennr, which raised $101 million in Series C funding in June at a $605 million valuation to focus on automating patient referrals.\n\nShalek said Valerie Health is bringing in business through its singular focus on independent provider groups and its ability to automate tasks without healthcare practices lifting a finger.\n\n\"It takes a lot of work from our side, but it allows us to just solve these problems for our customers without saying, here's another piece of software for you to train your staff on. That's the last thing these practices want. They just want us to do the work,\" he said.\n\nValerie Health wants to move fast as the market fills. Shalek said the startup is focused on grabbing more customers next year while continuing to build front-office solutions, such as voice AI agents for patient follow-ups. Valerie Health started selling its tech earlier this year; its revenue tripled last quarter from the previous quarter alone, and given the customers already in its pipeline plus the demand it's seeing in the market, Shalek said he expects revenue to grow six to seven times next year.\n\nThe startup is also hiring across its teams, including engineering, product, and sales. Joshi also spent two years as an engineering manager at fintech startup Stripe, so Shalek said Valerie Health has been able to bring over talent from both Stripe and Uber as it expands.",

The American Heart Association and Dallas County Medical Society were among groups pushing for new rules.\n\nFines for vaping in off-limits areas can reach $500 for each violation. Officials said they will respond to complaints and hand out citations after confirming reported incidents.\n\nSome exceptions apply to private homes, theatrical performances, licensed cigar lounges, smoking-permitted hotel rooms, and certain outdoor spaces including patios at restaurants and courses at golf clubs.\n\nWhen someone vapes, the device produces a mist carrying tiny particles that drift toward others nearby. Health professionals informed lawmakers that secondhand vapor exposure has ties to cancer and respiratory problems resembling asthma. The city's Office of Environmental Quality noted that PM2.5 particles emitted by e-cigarettes have been linked to birth defects.\n\nIn addition to negative impacts on air quality, the boom in disposable vaping has added another stream of hard-to-recycle waste to an already strained system. Disposable vapes have become a top contributor to plastic waste and electronic trash, and each device contains lithium batteries that pose fire hazards when tossed in regular garbage.\n\nMillions of these single-use products end up in landfills each year, where they leach toxic chemicals into soil and water.\n\n\"As we know, vaping is a serious public health matter impacting our youth and most vulnerable,\" said Kathy Stewart, a council member. \"I am pleased about the vote to enact these amendments.\"\n\nRenee Roberson, a nurse at a local school who serves as District 8 environmental commissioner, shared what she's witnessed firsthand.\n\n\"It rewires the kids into something negative,\" she said. \"Kids who are bright, then their focus becomes the vaping.\"\n\nDo you think cigarettes should be illegal?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": "You know the old adage about breakfast being the most important meal of the day? Experts say it has some merit when it comes to heart health.",
    "fullText": "Reviewed by Dietitian Sarah Pflugradt, Ph.D., RDN, CSCS\n\nThe morning habit that can spike your cholesterol levels over time is skipping breakfast.\n\nIt can throw off your circadian rhythm, decrease your diet quality and cause overeating.\n\nGo for a breakfast high in fiber and protein, move your body and minimize stress daily.\n\nYou might think your mornings are healthy—but certain daily rituals could quietly raise your cholesterol over time. We interviewed heart health experts to reveal the surprising morning habit that can affect your heart, plus simple swaps to protect it. Turns out, it’s something about 15% of US adults do on any given day!\n\nWe’re talking about skipping breakfast. Studies consistently show that skipping breakfast is linked with higher cholesterol levels, even when it leads to modest weight loss. There are a few reasons for this, which we’re diving into below.\n\nSkipping breakfast can throw off your circadian rhythm—your body’s internal clock. One of the many things that your circadian rhythm controls is lipid metabolism. When your body’s internal clock is thrown off, it may alter some genes and enzymes that regulate your cholesterol. “Without that morning meal, the liver’s HMG-CoA reductase enzyme, which controls the rate of cholesterol production, becomes more active, producing more LDL and total cholesterol,” says Michelle Routhenstein, M.S., RD, CDCES, CDN.\n\nEating breakfast, on the other hand, can help prevent cholesterol spikes that typically happen when you wake up. “Normally, cholesterol synthesis peaks in the early morning, but eating breakfast provides nutrients that help buffer this process,” says Routhenstein.\n\nIf you find yourself mindlessly snacking on high-carb or high-fat foods throughout the day, skipping breakfast may be the underlying cause. “Skipping breakfast can trigger metabolic shifts that increase cholesterol production and may also cause overeating later in the day,” says cardiologist, Dr. Randy Gould.\n\nThis is in part because of shifts in hormones that regulate appetite. “Prolonged morning fasting can alter hormones like leptin and ghrelin, increasing hunger and promoting insulin resistance,” says Routhenstein. “This combination can impair your body’s ability to clear cholesterol from the blood, further contributing to higher LDL cholesterol,” she adds. Your body experiences rebound hunger because its nutrient needs were not met earlier in the day.\n\nThat said, research results are mixed as to whether skipping breakfast actually leads you to eat more throughout the day. Some studies have found that skipping breakfast leads to a lower overall calorie intake. Still, studies consistently find worse cholesterol levels in people who skip breakfast, whether or not they eat more calories throughout the day.\n\nDelaying your first meal of the day may also affect the overall quality of your diet. “Skipping breakfast often leads to larger, less nutrient-dense meals later in the day,” says Routhenstein. These meals may be higher in saturated fat and refined carbs, which “directly contribute to more LDL particle formation and reduce the protective effects of HDL cholesterol,” she adds.\n\nOne study found that kids who skip breakfast tend to eat more fat and sodium throughout the day than kids who eat breakfast. This is notable because eating excess saturated fat and sodium can harm heart health. Plus, skipping breakfast may make it harder to eat enough whole grains—sources of high-quality carbs, fiber and minerals—particularly in the U.S. where whole grain cereals are common breakfast foods.\n\nAnother study found that Australian adults who ate a big breakfast consumed more fiber, vitamins and minerals throughout the day than those who skipped it. They also consumed less added sugars, saturated fats and alcohol, which can all negatively affect heart health.\n\nBesides eating breakfast, there are a few things you can do to transform your morning routine into a tool to lower your cholesterol. The best part? They can be done in a relatively short amount of time! If you currently wake up and rush out the door with no self-care time, focus on adding one thing at a time instead of overhauling your morning routine overnight.\n\nDelay screen time. If you reach for your phone first thing in the morning, try to delay this as much as you can. It may seem unrelated to heart health, but Routhenstein notes how checking messages, notifications or the news can increase stress and start your day on a negative foot. “Taking 10 to 30 minutes screen-free to start your day helps reduce stress, improves mood and allows you to take control of your day and prioritize your health,” says Routhenstein.\n\nEat a balanced breakfast. Now you know that eating breakfast is important for heart health, but what you eat also matters. Experts recommend heart-healthy foods rich in fiber and low in added sugars and saturated fat. “Starting the day with a balanced breakfast—such as oatmeal, whole grains, lean protein and fresh fruit—helps stabilize energy and avoid the cholesterol-raising effects of sugary cereals and drinks,” says Dr. Gould.\n\nGet in some movement. “A brief period of movement, whether a brisk walk, stretching or light strength training, can improve circulation and support healthy cholesterol levels,” says Dr. Gould. In fact, physical activity is recommended as a first-line approach to managing high cholesterol. So go for a morning stroll, hit the gym or get in a quick stretch when you wake up.\n\nTake time to destress. Diet and exercise aren’t the only things that influence heart health—stress also plays a big role. “Stress triggers the release of cortisol, a hormone that can raise cholesterol production, and it may also lead to unhealthy coping habits like overeating,” says Dr. Gould. Especially if you live a high-stress lifestyle, take a few minutes (or more!) in the morning to destress, whether through movement, breathwork, journaling or anything else that works for you!\n\nAs tempting as it may be to rush out the door without eating a balanced breakfast, this habit could silently raise your cholesterol. Heart health experts recommend eating a high-fiber, high-protein morning meal that’s low in added sugars and saturated fat. This helps stabilize your energy levels, buffer the liver’s production of cholesterol and prevent overeating later in the day. In addition to eating a nutritious breakfast, try to take time to move and destress at the start of your day instead of checking your phone to prevent cholesterol-raising cortisol spikes.",

    "fullText": "The ATP men's tennis tour will introduce an extreme heat policy from 2026 after criticism from players who sweltered through some tournaments this year.\n\nThe move brings the ATP into line with the women's WTA tour, which has a long-standing policy, and sports such as Formula One which has its own measures to protect drivers.\n\nIn October, Danish tennis star Holger Rune called temperatures of more than 30C and humidity soaring past 80 percent at the Shanghai Masters \"brutal\".\n\n\"Do you want a player to die on court?\" Rune was heard to ask as he wilted in the fierce conditions.\n\nThe ATP has now acted, saying on Monday it was \"strengthening protections for players competing in extreme conditions\".\n\nThe new rules are based on the Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT), which measures air temperature, humidity, wind speed and other factors to estimate heat stress.\n\nUnder the measures, a player can request a 10-minute cooling break in best-of-three singles matches if the WBGT reaches 30.1 degrees or higher during the first two sets.\n\nPlay will be suspended when the WBGT exceeds 32.2 degrees.\n\n\"The new heat rule provides a structured, medically supported approach to managing extreme heat, with the objective of safeguarding player health,\" the ATP said.\n\nIt added it will \"also improve conditions for spectators, officials, ball persons and tournament staff\".\n\nThe rules do not apply to the four Grand Slams, which have their own policies.\n\nPreviously, decisions over weather conditions, including heat, were down to the on-site ATP supervisor in coordination with medical teams and local organisers.\n\nThe planet is on track to log its second hottest year on record in 2025, Europe's global warming monitor said last week.",

    "fullText": "Analysts say benefits could be felt in under-resourced rural hospitals but warn against AI as a cost-cutting measure\n\nFor states to receive certain funding stipulated in the Trump administration’s “big, beautiful” bill, they must meet three of 10 criteria – including integrating more artificial intelligence (AI) technology in healthcare settings – which experts say could have major benefits and liabilities for under-resourced hospitals, depending on how it’s implemented.\n\nThe Rural Health Transformation Fund is a carveout that will provide $50bn over a period of five years to states who meet certain application criteria, including “consumer-facing, technology-driven solutions for the prevention and management of chronic diseases,” and “providing training and technical assistance for the development and adoption of technology-enabled solutions that improve care delivery in rural hospitals, including remote monitoring, robotics, artificial intelligence, and other advanced technologies”.\n\nAnalysts have noted that this $50bn will not be nearly enough to make up for the Congressional Budget Office’s projected $911bn reduction in Medicaid spending over the next decade under the bill (Obba). These cuts will affect both patients who lose free health coverage under Medicaid, and hospitals who benefit from those patients’ Medicaid reimbursements.\n\nChenhao Tan, associate professor of data science at the University of Chicago, and Karni Chagal-Feferkorn, an assistant professor at the University of South Florida’s college of AI and cybersecurity, said AI technology could provide major benefits to rural hospitals that are frequently under-resourced and under-staffed. They also agreed that AI has the potential to alleviate the administrative burden that physicians at these hospitals often face.\n\nPhysicians are responsible for taking detailed notes on patient visits and compiling them for electronic health records systems – a task that can take eight hours or more each week, according to the American Medical Association.\n\nA recent study found that AI generated patient notes are similar in quality to those of general physicians, but worse than those of expert physicians. Tan said that it’s important to take context – like frequent physician burnout in rural hospitals – into account when evaluating risks and benefits.\n\n“If the baseline is tired human doctors, then I think it is even easier to make an argument that AI may do better than them,” Tan said.\n\nChagal-Feferkorn hopes that AI can help alleviate rural hospital staffing issues, not only by reducing the workload but by attracting more doctors.\n\n“If the equipment is state-of-the-art, and they feel that much of the burdensome work is done by AI, I think this could be one incentive for physicians to go work in rural areas, this might have a great impact,” she said.\n\nThe FDA currently regulates AI technologies that are intended to evaluate and diagnose health conditions because they are considered medical devices. However, technologies that simply transcribe and compile patient notes are not regulated, though they may market themselves as Hipaa compliant.\n\nWhile Tan said it would be too high a bar to expect these technologies to be “bulletproof” before they can enter the market, he acknowledged that “there should be something higher than nothing,” in terms of regulatory requirements.\n\nChagal-Feferkorn also said that the proliferation of AI also creates additional cybersecurity concerns.\n\n“AI makes it easier for ordinary people to hack systems,” she said, adding that AI has the potential to improve patient safety by merging patient records from different providers so that, for example, every provider is aware of every medication that a patient is taking and can thus easily avoid dangerous medication interactions.\n\nBut this kind of technology will also require more privacy precautions.\n\n“The more data sharing there is, obviously the risk for data security breach is larger,” Chagal-Feferkorn continued.\n\nTo mitigate these risks, Tan said “worker upscaling needs to go hand in hand” with the adoption of AI technology. But Tan and Chagal-Feferkorn both expressed concern that under-resourced hospitals will attempt to adopt AI technology as a cost-cutting measure without the necessary staff and safety infrastructure.",

    "fullText": "DOUANKARA, Mauritania (AP) — The girl lay in a makeshift health clinic, her eyes glazed over and her mouth open, flies resting on her lips. Her chest barely moved. Drops of fevered sweat trickled down her forehead as medical workers hurried around her, attaching an IV drip.\n\nIt was the last moment to save her life, said Bethsabee Djoman Elidje, the women's health manager, who led the clinic's effort as the heart monitor beeped rapidly. The girl had an infection after a sexual assault, Elidje said, and had been in shock, untreated, for days.\n\nHer family said the 14-year-old had been raped by Russian fighters who burst into their tent in Mali two weeks earlier. The Russians were members of Africa Corps, a new military unit under Russia's defense ministry that replaced the Wagner mercenary group six months ago.\n\nMen, women and children have been sexually assaulted by all sides during Mali's decade-long conflict, the U.N. and aid workers say, with reports of gang rape and sexual slavery. But the real toll is hidden by a veil of shame that makes it difficult for women from conservative, patriarchal societies to seek help.\n\nThe silence that nearly killed the 14-year-old also hurts efforts to hold perpetrators accountable.\n\nThe AP learned of the alleged rape and four other alleged cases of sexual violence blamed on Africa Corps fighters, commonly described by Malians as the “white men,” while interviewing dozens of refugees at the border about other abuses such as beheadings and abductions.\n\nOther combatants in Mali have been blamed for sexual assaults. The head of a women’s health clinic in the Mopti area told the AP it had treated 28 women in the last six months who said they had been assaulted by militants with the al-Qaida affiliated JNIM, the most powerful armed group in Mali.\n\nThe silence among Malian refugees has been striking.\n\nIn eastern Congo, which for decades has faced violence from dozens of armed groups, “we didn’t have to look for people,” said Mirjam Molenaar, the medical team leader in the border area for Doctors Without Borders, or MSF, who was stationed there last year. The women \"came in huge numbers.”\n\nIt's different here, she said: “People undergo these things and they live with it, and it shows in post-traumatic stress.\"\n\nThe aunt of the 14-year-old girl said the Africa Corps fighters marched everyone outside at gunpoint. The family couldn't understand what they wanted. The men made them watch as they tied up the girl’s uncle and cut off his head.\n\nThen two of the men took the 14-year-old into the tent as she tried to defend herself, and raped her. The family waited outside, unable to move.\n\n“We were so scared that we were not even able to scream anymore,” the aunt recalled, as her mother sobbed quietly next to her. She, like other women, spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation, and the AP does not name victims of rape unless they agree to be named.\n\nThe girl emerged over a half-hour later, looking terrified. Then she saw her uncle's body and screamed. She fainted. When she woke up, she had the eyes of someone “who was no longer there,” the aunt said.\n\nThe next morning, JNIM militants came and ordered the family to leave. They piled onto a donkey cart and set off toward the border. At any sound, they hid in the bushes, holding their breath.\n\nThe girl's condition deteriorated during the three-day journey. When they arrived in Mauritania, she collapsed.\n\nThe AP came across her lying on the ground in the courtyard of a local family. Her family said they had not taken her to a clinic because they had no money.\n\n“If you have nothing, how can you bring someone to a doctor?” the girl’s grandmother said between sobs. The AP took the family to a free clinic run by MSF. A doctor said the girl had signs of being raped.\n\nThe clinic had been functioning for barely a month and had seen three survivors of sexual violence, manager Elidje said.\n\n“We are convinced that there are many cases like this,\" she said. \"But so far, very few patients come forward to seek treatment because it’s still a taboo subject here. It really takes time and patience for these women to open up and confide in someone so they can receive care. They only come when things have already become complicated, like the case we saw today.”\n\nAs Elidje tried to save the girl's life, she asked the family to describe the incident. She did not speak Arabic and asked the local nurse to find out how many men carried out the assault. But the nurse was too ashamed to ask.\n\nScratch marks are part of story she could not tell\n\nThousands of new refugees from Mali, mostly women and children, have settled just inside Mauritania in recent weeks, in shelters made of fabric and branches. The nearest refugee camp is full, complicating efforts to treat and report sexual assaults.\n\nTwo recently arrived women discreetly pulled AP journalists aside, adjusting scarves over their faces. They said they had arrived a week ago after armed white men came to their village.\n\n“They took everything from us. They burned our houses. They killed our husbands,” one said. “But that’s not all they did. They tried to rape us.”\n\nThe men entered the house where she was by herself and undressed her, she said, adding that she defended herself “by the grace of Allah.”\n\nAs she spoke, the second woman started crying and trembling. She had scratch marks on her neck. She was not capable of telling her story.\n\n“We are still terrified by what we went through,” she said.\n\nSeparately, a third woman said that what the white men did to her in Mali last month when she was alone at home “stays between God and me.”\n\nA fourth said she watched several armed white men drag her 18-year-old daughter into their house. She fled and has not seen her daughter again.\n\nThe women declined the suggestion to speak with aid workers, some of whom are locals. They said they were not ready to talk about it with anyone else.\n\nRussia’s Defense Ministry did not respond to questions, but an information agency that the U.S. State Department has called part of the “Kremlin’s disinformation campaign” called the AP’s investigation into Africa Corps fake news.\n\nWagner has a legacy of sexual abuse\n\nAllegations of rapes and other sexual assaults were already occurring before Wagner transformed into Africa Corps.\n\nOne refugee told the AP she witnessed a mass rape in her village in March 2024.\n\n“The Wagner group burned seven men alive in front of us with gasoline.” she said. Then they gathered the women and raped them, she said, including her 70-year-old mother.\n\n“After my mother was raped, she couldn’t bear to live,” she said. Her mother died a month later.\n\nIn the worst-known case of sexual assault involving Russian fighters in Africa, the U.N. in a 2023 report said at least 58 women and girls had been raped or sexually assaulted in an attack on Moura village by Malian troops and others that witnesses described as “armed white men.\"\n\nIn response, Mali’s government expelled the U.N. peacekeeping mission. Since then, gathering accurate data on the ground about conflict-related sexual violence has become nearly impossible.\n\nThe AP interviewed five of the women from Moura, who now stay in a displacement camp. They said they had been blindfolded and raped for hours by several men.\n\nThree of the women said they hadn't spoken about it to anyone apart from aid workers. The other two dared to tell their husbands, months later.\n\n“I kept silent with my family for fear of being rejected or looked at differently. It’s shameful,” one said.\n\nThe 14-year-old whose family fled to Mauritania is recovering. She said she cannot remember anything since the attack. Her family and MSF said she is speaking to a psychiatrist — one of just six working in the country.\n\nAid workers are worried about others who never say a thing.\n\n“It seems that conflict over the years gets worse and worse and worse. There is less regard for human life, whether it’s men, women or children,” said MSF’s Molenaar, and broke into tears. “It’s a battle.”\n\nFor more on Africa and development: https://apnews.com/hub/africa-pulse\n\nThe Associated Press receives financial support for global health and development coverage in Africa from the Gates Foundation.

    "fullText": "Kent State University is dropping 19 undergraduate degree programs with low enrollment to comply with Ohio's Senate Bill 1.\n\nUnder the law, which became effective in June, state colleges are now required to “eliminate any undergraduate degree program it offers if the institution confers an average of fewer than five degrees in the program annually over any three-year period,\" according to Kent State officials.\n\nOn Dec. 11, Kent State University’s Board of Trustees agreed to eliminate the programs, with this fall being the final admission. All currently enrolled students are receiving individualized advising and teach-out plans to ensure timely degree completion.\n\nThe degree programs being dropped effective fall 2026 include:\n\nThe Africana Studies major within the Bachelor of Arts degree.\n\nThe Chemistry major within the Bachelor of Arts degree.\n\nThe Classics major within the Bachelor of Arts degree.\n\nThe Community Health Education major within the Bachelor of Science degree.\n\nThe Dance and Dance Studies majors within the Bachelor of Fine Arts degree.\n\nThe Earth Science majors within both the Bachelor of Arts and the Bachelor of Science Education degrees.\n\nThe French major within the Bachelor of Arts degree.\n\nThe Horticulture major within the Bachelor of Applied Horticulture degree, and the Horticulture Technology major within the Associate of Applied Science degree.\n\nThe Life Science major and the Life Science/Chemistry major within the Bachelor of Science Education degrees.\n\nThe Mathematics major within the Bachelor of Arts degree.\n\nThe Physical Science major within the Bachelor of Science Education degree.\n\nThe Physics major within the Bachelor of Arts degree.\n\nThe Radiologic Technology major within the Associate of Technical Study degree.\n\nThe Respiratory Care major within the Bachelor of Science degree.\n\nThe School Health Education major within the Bachelor of Science Education degree.\n\nKent State will continue to offer related degrees or credentials in several areas under different program headings, according to university officials. For example, the Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics will sunset, but the Bachelor of Science in Mathematics continues to serve students in that field of study.\n\nFor Chemistry, Mathematics, Physics and Radiologic Technology, the university will maintain other degree options at the associate or bachelor’s degree level.\n\nFor Africana Studies, Classics, Dance, Earth Science, French and Horticulture, the university will continue to offer undergraduate minors or certificates.\n\nKent State also will maintain teacher education bachelor’s degree programs in science and health fields that align with the inactivated programs.\n\nThe board also approved a strategic partnership with NEOMED Clinical Services LLC to take over Kent State's student health services.\n\nThe board authorized the university to enter into a lease and health center services agreement with NEOMED Clinical Services, establishing a collaborative arrangement to provide comprehensive clinical care and preventive services on campus.\n\nNEOMED occupies about 10,500 square feet of space on the lower floor of the DeWeese Health Center to provide expanded clinical services, health education and outreach programs.\n\nThe three-year agreement begins July 1, 2026, with the option for two one-year renewals. NEOMED will provide all staffing for the health center services and will work cooperatively with Kent State’s Division of People, Culture and Belonging to offer retention to qualified employees.\n\nIn addition, the board approved a Student Health Fee effective fall 2026. Full-time undergraduate and graduate students will be assessed $90 per semester, while part-time students will pay $35 per semester.\n\nThe fee excludes College Credit Plus students, students enrolled in fully online programs, dissertation students and students enrolled at the College of Podiatric Medicine.\n\nIn other business, the board approved a six-year comprehensive capital plan for Fiscal Years 2027-32, identifying campus upgrade projects that are the most important to the institution.\n\nThe plan primarily includes projects funded by state capital appropriations and does not list projects solely financed by local funding or philanthropy.\n\nThe Ohio Office of Budget and Management requires that each state college submit a six-year capital plan.\n\nProjects for the first two years of the plan include:\n\nThe third phase of the renovation of White Hall on the Kent Campus will replace antiquated heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) equipment to the remaining floors along with planned classroom and interior building improvements.\n\nTower renovations in University Library on the Kent Campus.\n\nContinued critical deferred maintenance of the aging infrastructure on the Kent Campus.\n\nInformation technology network access enhancements in academic buildings on the Kent Campus.\n\nThe second phase of Purinton Hall classroom renovations on the East Liverpool Campus.\n\nMain Classroom Building HVAC replacement on the Salem Campus.\n\nThe second phase of central chiller plant replacement on the Stark Campus.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Record-Courier: Kent State will eliminate 19 undergrad programs in fall 2026",

    "title": "‘Tragedy in the making’: Top healthcare exec on why insurance will spike to subsidize a tax cut to millionaires and billionaires",
    "description": "\"If the two sides could talk,\" said UConn Health chair John Driscoll, \"there probably is a way that they could agree on how to to bridge the difference.\"",
    "fullText": "Top healthcare executive John Driscoll calls the looming expiration of enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies “a tragedy in the making,” warning that millions of Americans are about to be hit with higher premiums, lost coverage, and rising medical debt as Washington gridlock hardens.\n\nDriscoll, who is currently the chairman of UConn Health after a 25-year career in health care including a previous position as Walgreens Boots Alliance president, said the policy reversal amounts to “a self‑inflicted wound” that will push costs up for both low‑income families and the affluent professionals who thought they were insulated.​\n\nDriscoll cited CBO estimates that if Congress allows the subsidies to lapse, premiums will jump for roughly 24 million marketplace enrollees, and around 2 million people will lose coverage entirely in the near term.\n\n“You don’t solve higher health care costs with fewer people getting insured,” he told Fortune, arguing that the system will simply reprice risk and shift costs onto everyone else. “Whenever you reduce coverage at the bottom, everybody pays \n\nEnhanced premium tax credits, introduced during the pandemic and extended through 2025, have helped double marketplace enrollment and kept average subsidized premiums under about $900 a year. When they expire, KFF News projects a roughly 114% increase in average premium payments for subsidized enrollees in 2026. Older adults and rural residents would be especially exposed, with KFF also warning that adults ages 50 to 64 could see average premium hikes of 75% or more.​\n\nDriscoll argued that the real story is a giant cost shift from government to households and employers, driven by simultaneous Medicaid cuts, work requirements, and subsidy rollbacks. When people lose coverage, he notes, they “don’t stop getting covered by the health care system.” Instead, they show up later and sicker, so hospitals and insurers respond by raising prices to anticipate uncompensated care.\n\nWhen you consider that this is being done to “effectively subsidize a tax deduction for millionaires and billionaires, that’s going to shift health care costs to all of us when people lose coverage,” he added, referring to the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that extended President Donald Trump’s previous tax cuts and introduced new ones.\n\nFor Driscoll, the subsidy cliff exposes a deeper “tribal dysfunction” in health policy that has frozen the Affordable Care Act in place instead of improving it. He called Obamacare “a very good but imperfect solution” that cut the uninsured rate roughly in half and slowed healthcare inflation, but he said both parties have refused to engage in the hard work of updating it. “We really aren’t prioritizing the patient,” he said, “we’re prioritizing the politics,” leaving millions facing the choice of dropping coverage or postponing care for serious conditions.\n\n​​He had a warning for Republicans, calling this looming mass expiration of health insurance subsidies a “self-inflicted wound” for the party. “They were elected on solving affordability,” he pointed out, and now they’re going to accelerate the problem. But Driscoll said no side is blameless. “The tragic thing is, neither side really wants to have a sensible conversation about how do you really care for more people and get them better care earlier.”\n\nIt’s true that Democrats drove the ACA, but Driscoll said that by and large they are committed to defending something that was itself a compromise, and the other side is playing offense. “The danger is that some Democrats don’t want to have a conversation on evolving [the ACA] because they feel like they have to defend it and the Republicans don’t ever don’t want to have a conversation about evolving it because they want to destroy it.” The result is you end up here, in “this sort of ridiculous no progress zone.” (Driscoll did disclose that he is serving as Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont’s special advisor on health care.)\n\nFrom his vantage point now, Driscoll argued that the reason America is bedevilled with constant healthcare issues is a mismatch of incentives. “Healthcare is a team sport that keeps getting undermined by individual incentives,” he said, noting that U.S. costs are twice as expensive as the average industrialized country and not nearly as productive, he pointed out.\n\nIn similar countries, roughly 50%-60% of doctors are primary care, but it’s only one in four in the U.S. The problem is that every doctor wants to be a specialist or a surgeon because they’ll roughly double the salary of a pediatrician or internist that way. “Until you change those incentives people are going to keep going towards those higher compensated areas.”\n\nThere’s no one fix to this, but there are steps we could take, Driscoll said. He pointed to expanded drug‑price negotiation, immigration reforms to ease shortages of primary‑care doctors and nurses, “site‑neutral” payment so patients aren’t charged more for identical hospital‑based care, and broader use of value‑based and bundled payment models. But we don’t even seem to be capable of engagement, he argued.\n\n“If the two sides could talk,” Driscoll said, “there probably is a way that they could agree on how to to bridge the difference between what Biden and Trump want to do on drug costs. If we could talk, we could probably agree on how to bring back value-based care that would balance the interests of doctors and hospitals and and patients’ outcomes and the government’s obligation.” If only.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",
