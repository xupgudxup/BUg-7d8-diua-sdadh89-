    "fullText": "Paul George, a nine-time NBA All-Star forward for the Philadelphia 76ers, was issued a 25-game suspension by the league on Saturday for violating the NBA Anti-Drug Program.\n\nGeorge's ban will begin with Saturday's Sixers home game against New Orleans.\n\nThe 35-year-old American who has averaged 20.5 points over his 16-year NBA career, said in a statement to ESPN he mistakenly took a mental health medication that violated the NBA and players union joint anti-drug policy.\n\n\"Over the past few years, I've discussed the importance of mental health, and in the course of recently seeking treatment for an issue of my own, I made the mistake of taking an improper medication,\" George told ESPN.\n\n\"I take full responsibility for my actions and apologize to the Sixers organization, my teammates and the Philly fans for my poor decision making during this process.\n\n\"I'm focused on using this time to make sure that my mind and body are in the best condition to help the team when I return.\"\n\nGeorge would not be eligible to return until the 76ers play host to Chicago on March 25, with only 10 games remaining in the regular season for the Sixers.\n\nGeorge has averaged 16.0 points, 5.1 rebounds, 3.7 assists and 1.5 steals over 27 games this season for Philadelphia, which stands 26-21 and sixth in the Eastern Conference.\n\nTogether with Joel Embiid and Tyrese Maxey, the 76ers were expected to be contenders this season but their time together as a triple threat has been limited by injuries.\n\nThe ban is expected to cost George about $11.7 million of his season salary and save the 76ers about $5 million in luxury tax payments under the league's salary cap system.\n\nTaken by Indiana with the 10th pick in the 2010 NBA Draft, George played seven seasons for the Pacers, earning the 2013 NBA Most Improved Player award.\n\nGeorge, who captured Olympic gold with the US team of NBA stars at Rio in 2016, was traded to Oklahoma City in 2017 and led the NBA with 2.2 steals a game in the 2018-19 campaign.\n\nIn 2019, George was sent to the Los Angeles Clippers in a blockbuster deal that brought reigning NBA Most Valuable Player Shai Gilgeous-Alexander to the Thunder along with five first-round draft picks and Italy's Danilo Gallinari -- a swap that helped the Clippers land free agent Kawhi Leonard.\n\nGeorge spent five seasons with the Clippers before opting out of his contract in 2024 and signing a four-year deal worth $212 million with the 76ers.\n\nInjuries limited George to only 41 appearances last season.",

    "title": "I tracked my blood glucose levels for two weeks. It felt like I was in sugar jail.",
    "description": "The health reporter Kim Schewitz often feels tired, and hoped tracking her blood sugar levels using a continuous glucose monitor would help. Then the app told her to do calf raises for 15 minutes.",
    "fullText": "Blood sugar is a hot topic, and after months of watching content waxing lyrical about \"balancing it,\" I needed to know if it was true that tracking my glucose levels would help boost my energy.\n\nSo with a few taps on my laptop, I ordered a continuous glucose monitor: a small white disk carrying a tiny needle, which charts blood sugar levels in near real-time via an app.\n\nDesigned for people with diabetes to closely monitor their glucose levels and prevent potentially life-threatening fluctuations, in recent years, they've become a buzzy lifestyle wearable marketed at healthy people.\n\nGlucose is our primary energy source, which we get from carbohydrates in food and drink. The body uses it for energy, and anything that's left over is stored in the muscles, liver, or fat cells for later use. Sugary snacks and simple carbs like white pasta tend to lead to bigger blood sugar spikes, while pairing carbs with protein, fats, and fiber has been found to smooth out the curve.\n\nThe term \"glucose spike\" has become a dirty word, as wellness influencers say that peaks and troughs lead to weight gain, energy crashes, and cravings. In turn, there are plenty of personal anecdotes online — but limited evidence — that \"balancing\" blood sugar by keeping it stable has helped people lose weight, feel happier and more energetic, sleep better, and avoid chronic disease.\n\nDespite following a pretty balanced diet — I eat protein and plenty of fiber with most meals, and few ultra-processed foods — I'm often tired and lacking energy. I was curious to see if the longevity bros were onto something, and if wearing a CGM for two weeks could provide any helpful insights.\n\nThe experience started with the sharp scratch of the CGM needle puncturing my skin. I held the plastic applicator to the back of my left arm, pressed down, and before I knew it, was branded with a white plastic circle. It stayed there for two weeks, measuring the glucose levels in the fluid around my cells and sending the data via Bluetooth to a line chart on my phone. I felt very aware of the CGM when my arms were exposed in public, which made me feel a little self-conscious.\n\nAt the beginning, it was exciting having access to this new metric, and the first thing I did was eat a rich chocolate truffle.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the little line on the chart — representing my glucose level — started moving sharply up, but I was pleased to see that it stayed within the healthy range of 3.9 mmol/L to 7.8 mmol/L. This was delineated on the chart by two dotted lines, which made it easy to see if I was having what would be considered a glucose spike or dip.\n\nThe line moved every time I ate or drank something other than water, exercised, or felt stressed (both can affect glucose levels).\n\nI ate normally to get an idea of my typical daily blood glucose levels, and in hindsight see that I quickly fell into the trap of judging meals as \"good\" or \"bad\" based on their effect. I know that's not a healthy way to think of food, but I guess I subconsciously believed the reductionist idea that any rise in blood sugar should be avoided. In fact, fluctuations within the healthy range (and sometimes outside of it) are just a normal part of digestion.\n\nSo I was pleased when my go-to breakfast didn't cause a spike, but surprised when the flat white coffee with 2% milk that I drank before it caused the level to rise as much as my entire breakfast.\n\nI didn't love that my protein and fiber-rich lunch of ground turkey and black bean chili with red rice sent my line close to the top of the healthy range, but reasoned that was probably because it was larger than my breakfast. I felt particularly disheartened when a dinner of soba noodles, which are made from buckwheat flour (complex carbs), and tofu (protein) in broth with cabbage (fiber) marked the first sharp spike.\n\nI was even more confused when the chili caused a huge spike and the noodles didn't when I ate the same lunch and dinner the next day.\n\nMy blood sugar didn't exceed the healthy range many times, but when it did, it was after I consumed:\n\nI would consider half of these balanced meals, but according to my chart, they raised my blood sugar more than the sweet treats like cake and a brownie that I ate during the two weeks. Maybe that's to be expected, but, without an expert to explain the data, I didn't know.\n\nOn reflection, I underestimated how complicated it would be to decipher this data and apply it to my life healthily. My glucose levels fluctuated more than I expected and it wasn't always clear to me why.\n\nThe app did explain that a healthy person's blood sugar tends to be outside of the healthy range for up to two hours per day, but I wasn't sure if an unsteady line within the safe zone was worrying or not (a nutrition researcher I spoke to since reassured me that it is not).\n\nIn terms of my energy levels, I noticed that I felt better on weekdays when I ate three square meals a day around the same time than weekends, when I tended to skip breakfast and eat a big meal around 2 or 3 p.m. This was reflected in my blood sugar levels, but I'm not sure I needed a CGM to figure that out.\n\nThe urge to check how my body reacted to food after a few bites quickly became a compulsion. Even though I understood a spike wasn't necessarily bad, I still felt encouraged by the app to keep my line as straight as possible.\n\nIt set me a daily target to stay within, at first based on averages and after a week based on my levels. It would tell me to do 15 squats, five to 10 minutes of calf raises, or take a brisk walk, when my glucose started rising (research suggests these movements can bring it down). I tried to go on walks, and did the squats on two occasions, but I drew the line at 10 minutes of calf raises.\n\nThe app was purportedly helping me to make my diet even healthier, but I became hyperfixated on a single metric that I didn't really understand.\n\nI felt a pang of dread every time I ate, knowing my glucose levels would rise and the app would watch and prescribe me exercise like some kind of punishment. It felt like the only way to keep my glucose stable would be to unnecessarily overhaul my already healthy diet.\n\nI intended to spend the second half of the experiment trying to avoid spikes and observing if I felt more alert and focused. That was before I realized that optimizing your health means aiming for constantly shifting goal posts. Once you perfect one metric, you simply move onto the next.\n\nHaving too many blood sugar spikes over time can increase the risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and heart disease. But diabetes experts previously told Business Insider that glucose monitoring isn't necessary for people without the disease and that it can cause unnecessary anxiety.\n\nIt's possible that cutting out all refined sugar and eating plainer, simpler meals would help me focus a little better. But I already track my sleep, go for a daily lunchtime walk, do a weekly run, eat 30 plants a week, and stop drinking caffeine after 1 p.m, in the name of my health.\n\nMaybe it was the invasive nature of sleeping with a needle in my arm, or the Black Mirror-ness of my phone tracking my bloodwork, but I suddenly felt I was on the border between healthy and obsessive. That isn't somewhere I want to be.",

    "fullText": "Hundreds of parents, teens and school districts have claimed social media is intentionally addictive and harmful\n\nSocial media companies will have to answer to a jury – for the first time – for allegations that their products are intentionally addictive and harmful to young users’ mental health. Hundreds of parents, teens and school districts sued Meta, Snap, TikTok and YouTube, leading to a series of landmark trials that began this week. Jury selection in the first case started on Tuesday in Los Angeles court.\n\nMeta’s Mark Zuckerberg is among the big tech CEOs who are expected to testify. Both sides are likely to bring in experts to hash out the science behind alleged addiction to social media.\n\nThe initial trial involves a 20-year-old, identified by the initials KGM, who alleges she experienced physical and emotional harm after becoming addicted to social media at age 10. This case is expected to last six to eight weeks, and will be the first of about 22 “bellwether” trials. The outcome can signal, and influence, how courts and juries may handle similar lawsuits in the future. Snap and TikTok have settled with the plaintiff in the first case, leaving Meta and YouTube to stand trial.\n\n“Everybody’s looking at it as a data point,” said Benjamin Zipursky, a law professor at Fordham University.\n\nThe legal proceedings follow years of heated criticism of tech companies from angry parents; they blame social networks for causing eating disorders, suicidal thoughts and anxiety in their children. The companies lay blame on the victims, plaintiffs’ lawyers and supporters say: “The tech companies blame parents for not being good parents,” said Sacha Haworth, executive director of the Tech Oversight Project, which has been involved in advocacy work for the plaintiffs. “Their experience has shown that you can be the best parent in the world – you can have conversations, you can limit screen time, you can turn on the bullshit parental controls – and your kid still dies.”\n\nThe cases and future settlements could eventually change the way social media platforms work; plaintiffs are asking for money, as well as injunctive relief that would establish industry-wide safety standards. Legislators around the world are watching; many are trying to impose liability on tech companies in a similar way as the plaintiffs. So even if juries declare the defendants aren’t liable in these cases, lawmakers will be taking notes–and adapting their own strategies, says Eric Goldman, a professor at the Santa Clara University school of law. Some have already enacted laws that align with the plaintiff’s claims.\n\nThere’s more at stake now, legal experts say. “Bad press about how some members of Congress embarrass Zuckerberg is one thing,” Zipursky added. Changing the architecture of a social network may be another entirely.\n\nPlaintiffs want to know: how much did tech companies know about the alleged harm caused by their products, and to what extent did they fail to warn users? They take particular issue with design features such as infinite scroll, autoplay and content curated by algorithms, accusing social media companies of prioritising engagement over wellbeing. Their legal strategy has brought up comparisons with those used against tobacco companies in the 1990s.\n\nThe trial will explore what social media addiction consists of. Tech companies have questioned the scientific link between their platforms and addiction. They also highlight various safety features and parental controls they adopted in recent years. Even if this harm exists, they argue, it’s a result of problematic content, as opposed to a poorly designed system. In doing so, the companies have often relied on a federal law that shields them from liability for third-party content on their platforms: section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. That defense hasn’t worked so far in this case, given the plaintiffs’ novel argument.\n\n“[Plaintiffs] have reconfigured it to say, look: the wrongful thing Meta is doing is running its whole platform in such a way that people get addicted,” Zipursky said. A key issue will be whether plaintiffs can prove the tech companies were wrongfully taking harmful risks, Zipursky added. Moreover, if the plaintiffs can prove that tech companies knowingly and intentionally caused harm, it will be easier to get punitive damages.\n\nSocial media addiction is not included in the latest edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the authoritative handbook for mental health treatment. Scientists have, however, catalogued compulsive use with severe consequences among young people, and legislators across the world are engaged in heated debate over its addictive potential and how to respond.\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, YouTube CEO Neal Mohan and Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri are expected to testify in the initial trial. Snap and TikTok reached a settlement in that case but are still defendants in other suits in the state-level trial.\n\nA Meta spokesperson said in an emailed comment that they strongly disagree with these allegations, and stressed that they have listened to parents and worked with experts and law enforcement to address safety issues. The company also cited the introduction of teen accounts, with additional protections.\n\nGoogle spokesperson José Castañeda called allegations in the lawsuits “simply not true”, and emphasized that the company had prioritized providing a safe and healthy experience for young people. Snap commented only on the first bellwether trial, saying they were “pleased to have been able to resolve this matter in an amicable manner”. TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nWhile much of the cases is yet to play out, some unsealed evidence has already drawn criticism of tech companies. That includes allegations that an Instagram employee compared the app to a drug, and that another suggested: “lol, we’re basically pushers.” A Meta spokesperson previously told Politico that the plaintiffs’ allegations relied on “cherry-picked quotes and misinformed opinions in an attempt to present a deliberately misleading picture”.\n\nThe 20-year-old at the center of the initial trial started using social media around age 10, even as her mother tried to stop her from using the apps. She “developed a compulsion to engage with those products nonstop” as a result of their “addictive design” and “constant notifications”, the complaint notes, according to NPR.\n\nLegal experts expect all of these cases will eventually be appealed if they don’t reach a settlement, and there’s no certainty about outcomes until appellate courts have weighed in. They expect tech companies to raise several issues, including whether the Communications Decency Act or first amendment applies, as well as potential disputes over causation and expert testimony. “None of these companies are going to feel that they need to change what they do,” Zipursky said.\n\nStill, juries’ verdicts in the early cases can affect how much companies may pay out. “The jury might signal they’re completely persuaded by the plaintiff’s arguments,” Goldman said. “Then, if there’s any settlement, the price tag will go up substantially.”",

    "fullText": "The start of a new year always brings new exercise routines — or at least the intentions to start them.\n\nIf you're anything like me, though, you might need a little encouragement and inspiration to get going.\n\nSo Business Insider spoke with successful women who make time for fitness regimens each week. They shared the workouts they love, and the gym essentials they swear by.\n\nJanel Barden, 27, is a cofounder of the talent and marketing agency LuxeHaus Management.\n\nIdeally, she likes to exercise between three and five times a week. When her schedule is extra busy, though, she uses a simple piece of equipment to enhance shorter exercises: $65 Bala Bangles.\n\nEach bracelet weighs two pounds and attaches with elastic straps.\n\n\"I love wearing them on walks, and when I'm at home doing a five to 10-minute arm workout I found on YouTube,\" Barden said.\n\nBarden uses ClassPass to vary her workouts. Sometimes, she does Pilates. Other times, she visits the gym, and most recently, she started working with a personal trainer.\n\nNo matter the workout, she's almost always wearing Alo Yoga clothes. She said its pieces are cute and comfortable.\n\nBarden specifically loves the brand's $138 sweatpants and $148 quarter-zip pullover from its Accolade collection, as well as the $78 bra and $134 leggings from its Airlift line.\n\nOccasionally, though, she'll swap her Alo pants for Lululemon's $108 Align leggings.\n\nVictoria Villanueva, 25, cofounded LuxeHaus Management with Barden. She said that exercise is vital to staying active and boosting her mental health while working from home.\n\n\"I've been really into bike riding lately,\" she said. \"I used to go all the time with my dad when I was little, and getting back into it now as an adult is healing something inside me. It's better than taking walks.\"\n\nTo hydrate before and after those rides, she relies on her $40 Stanley 1913 tumbler.\n\nVillanueva told Business Insider that her exercise wardrobe includes a mix of Halara leggings, Fabletics sets, and one accessory: the $349 Ultrahuman Ring Air in bionic gold.\n\n\"It's a dupe for the Oura Ring, but you don't have to pay for a monthly subscription,\" she said.\n\nIt helps her track her steps, heart rate, sleep, and more.\n\nSabrina Guler is the 32-year-old founder of Intuitive CEO, an advisory studio that helps new brands grow and raise capital.\n\nHer exercise regimen starts before she really gets moving each day.\n\n\"Drinking electrolytes before coffee every morning has completely changed my energy levels and hydration,\" she said. \"I avoid sugar-based options and use Ultima electrolytes.\"\n\nThe brand sells packets in sets for around $20.99 per bag.\n\n\"My 45-minute morning walk helps with insulin regulation, cortisol balance, and mental clarity,\" Guler told Business Insider. \"Hormones are everything.\"\n\nThe specific clothing pieces she wears on those walks might vary, but the brands don't.\n\n\"If I want to be seen and look cute, I am wearing Alo Yoga,\" she said. \"If I want to be comfortable, Lululemon has functional pieces. The butter-soft leggings still have me in a chokehold years later.\"\n\nNikki Seaman, 30, is the founder and CEO of Freestyle Snacks. Her brand, which recently appeared on \"Shark Tank,\" offers premium olives and pickles in to-go pouches.\n\n\"I do strength training two or three times a week, and I try to walk outside on the other days,\" she told Business Insider. \"I started strength training after my first son was born, and it has totally changed me physically and mentally.\"\n\nDuring those workouts, she wears $110 performance joggers from Vuori and $155 Clifton 10 sneakers from Hoka.\n\nShe described both as comfortable, durable, and easy to throw on before heading outside.",

    "fullText": "Ant Group, Alibaba’s fintech affiliate and parent of China’s ubiquitous payment app Alipay, is racing to lead the country’s digital health market with a chatbot designed to be a wellness companion.\n\nIts app, Ant Afu, uses artificial intelligence and agentic capabilities to answer health-related questions, suggest hospital appointments, analyze test results, and remind users to exercise or take medication. First created in June under the name AQ, it had recorded 30 million monthly active users by January, with more than half of them living in small cities, according to Ant Group’s chief executive Han Xinyi.\n\nInternet users have increasingly turned to AI for everyday health questions and companionship, especially in markets where access to physicians is limited. Despite concerns about patient safety and data privacy, products like Ant Afu are widely embraced in China as consumers seek more personalized, round-the-clock health support.\n\nChina’s primary care system is underdeveloped. Most people seek treatment for everything from the flu to cancer at sprawling, overcrowded public hospitals that are concentrated in big cities. Patients often complain of long wait times, short consultations, and poor bedside manner of exhausted clinicians.\n\nThis demand for better care, combined with a fast-aging population, has created a fertile ground for digital health products that can spare people the burden of visiting hospitals. Tech companies including JD.com, ByteDance, and Baidu have all built online medical consultation tools, and more recently, chatbots branded as AI doctors.\n\nAnt has a unique advantage as Alipay has long hosted the appointment and payment systems for many hospitals. Millions of people access their national medical insurance accounts through Alipay. In January 2025, Ant acquired Haodf, a leading online consultation portal with more than 300,000 registered physicians.\n\nIn the U.S., AI companies are also expanding their health-care offerings, but they do not yet offer direct access to the country’s large number of private providers and insurers. This month, both OpenAI and Anthropic announced tools targeting consumers, health-care providers, and clinical researchers. Both ChatGPT and Claude now offer features that analyze users’ medical reports and fitness data.\n\nAmong its domestic rivals, Ant’s extensive partnerships with regulators, hospitals, and doctors give it an edge in the AI health-care race, Ivy Yang, a China tech analyst and founder of New York-based consulting firm Wavelet Strategy, told Rest of World. On Ant Afu, users can ask health-related questions, book online consultations and offline appointments at major hospitals, and get reimbursed by state or commercial insurance.\n\n“For startups, the bureaucratic red tape and initial investment required to build the platform, be compliant with all health-care data [regulations], and deal with various government agencies seem like too big a hurdle to overcome,” Yang said.\n\nAnt’s foray into health care has been endorsed by its billionaire founder Jack Ma. He came up with the name Afu, because it made the chatbot sound like a friend, chief executive Han told Chinese tech outlet Latepost this month. “He really cares about whether or not Afu can be like an AI friend that offers emotional companionship and humane care,” Han said, “rather than being just a tool for solving professional problems.”\n\nMa hopes to one day launch the app in underdeveloped parts of Africa and Southeast Asia, Han said.\n\nAnt has spent tens of millions of dollars marketing Afu in China, according to Han. Ant Afu ads have popped up in subway stations, on social media feeds, inside public restrooms, and have been painted on walls in rural China, according to photos shared online. By the end of January, Ant Afu ranked among the top ten most-downloaded iOS apps in China, according to Sensor Tower data.\n\nThe expanding role of AI in patient care, a largely unregulated area, has also prompted warnings about misinformation around the world.  A recent investigation by The Guardian found that Google’s AI summaries were giving out inaccurate health advice. Academics have also found AI diagnostic tools to harbor racial or socioeconomic biases.",

    "fullText": "A serious health threat has been spreading in Pennsylvania, according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, and shifting weather patterns may be a contributing factor.\n\nCases of anaplasmosis went up over 50% in Allegheny County in 2025. U.S. states, including Wisconsin and California, have also seen jumps in the tick-borne bacterial infection.\n\nAnaplasmosis is routinely transmitted alongside Lyme disease via tick bites. Initial symptoms of infection include fever, fatigue, and nausea. When left untreated, it can have longer-term consequences.\n\n\"I really can't commit a lot to doing what I used to,\" Janine Hauck told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette in late December. Hauck contracted anaplasmosis in 2019 and has since suffered from chronic fatigue, impacting her ability to hike, bike, swim, and engage in the outdoor activities she loves. \"It's changed my life.\"\n\nA major contributor to the increase in anaplasmosis infections is the expanded population and habitat of disease-carrying ticks. Warmer, wetter weather patterns, exacerbated in part by atmospheric pollution, have provided prime conditions for ticks to reproduce.\n\nThis phenomenon has exacerbated the spread of other vector-borne illnesses, including dengue virus and West Nile virus.\n\nAnaplasmosis can be treated with antibiotics if detected early. For this reason, officials recommend regularly checking for tick bites after spending time outdoors. Seeking medical attention soon after a tick bite can help support recovery.\n\nPreventing tick bites in the first place is possible by wearing adequately long clothing and using effective repellents. Hauck told the Post-Gazette that the precautions are worth the hassle.\n\n\"People don't get how bad a tick bite could affect your life,\" she told the paper. \"I probably spent over $60,000 trying to get better. I'm lucky I have [the money], but not everyone does.\"\n\nIn the big picture, attacking the root of the problem may also require reducing emissions as much as possible in order to mitigate increasingly warm, wet weather and to shrink tick habitats and activity.\n\nDo you worry about having toxic forever chemicals in your home?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": "\"The point is, go to the doctors for a check-up or if something is not right. It might save your life.\"",
    "fullText": "\"Last year, after four years of hell, some new extreme symptoms popped up, like shortness of breath and joint pain. A few exams and lots more bloodwork later — wham, bam, thank you ma'am — it was undiagnosed LUPUS this whole time. I've now been on treatment for four months. Always, always, ALWAYS listen to your body above anyone else!\"\n\n\"When I couldn't step out of the shower without completely losing my breath, I finally went to the ER. I was diagnosed with what the docs called the largest deep vein thrombosis (blood clot in my thigh) they had ever seen. A piece of it had migrated to my lung, creating a huge saddle pulmonary embolism.\n\nI spent four days in the ICU and underwent two separate stent procedures to get the clots dissolved. Took about six months to get back to full capacity.\n\nIn my defense, I didn't know leg pain was a symptom of a blood clot, but I shouldn't have let it go on for so long.\"\n\n\"Also can be a sign of kidney disease.\"\n\n\"Ignored this for over two years and eventually ended up in the hospital with kidney failure.\"\n\n—Anonymous, 57, Female, California\n\n—Anonymous, 20, Nonbinary, North Carolina\n\n\"I went to the emergency room the week before I was supposed to return to work from maternity leave. The ER doctor told me my blood pressure was up, but to just go to my primary and sent me on my way. I made an appointment with my primary, and she told me I went through a lot having a baby, and my body is just adjusting.\"\n\n\"I spent three days in the hospital being treated as my heart was only at 15% functionality. My poor husband was distraught, he almost lost his partner, and was sad because he couldn't spend the days with me, instead having to care for my infant. It was scary. Thankfully, I have recovered, but I will spend the rest of my life taking lots of medicine to keep my heart healthy. What I learned is to listen to your body. If something feels wrong, it very well may be, and losing your life isn't worth being afraid to go to the doctor.\"\n\n\"By the time he was willing to share this with me, and we went to a doctor who treated his illness, my husband had between 6-18 months left to live. He delayed his treatment because he thought his 'persona' would be destroyed. He became more verbal and the loving man I recalled after taking his medication. He was a better man… until he was no longer alive. He died at 67. Men, check your PSA count. Save your lives not only for yourselves, but also for those who love you.\"\n\n\"Turns out I was so severely anemic, the breathlessness and coughing weren't from asthma or bronchitis or allergies, but it was from severe anemia for many years, indicating possible heart failure. After an iron supplement and an IUD to slow heavy menstrual bleeding, I haven't had to use an inhaler or asthma medicine in almost seven years. Get your iron levels checked often if you are a female in your 30s and 40s; it can literally make your heart fail.\"\n\n—Anonymous, 47, Female, North Carolina\n\n\"The poor ER doctor lady was so nice, but I was so embarrassed. Like, she literally stuck her hand up my ass. I genuinely felt like I was in John Mulaney's skit about trying to get Xanax and ending up getting a prostate exam because he said he was lying to get prescribed drugs. Unfortunately, because I waited, it's mostly pain management now. Pay attention to rectal issues and eat your fiber! I wanna die writing this. I'm so glad it's anon.\"\n\n—Anonymous, 25, Female, Seattle, Washington\n\n\"Two surgeries, a long hospital stay, followed by a home nurse aid daily to administer intravenous antibiotics and clean the 3-inch section of flesh removed, which had to remain open for weeks for the tendons to heal. You could see my bone and all the other inside things. I have a wicked scar from it.\"\n\n—Anonymous, 63, Female, New Jersey\n\n\"I had open heart surgery soon after, and they were able to remove it. I'll be on medication forever and need to see a specialist twice a year. Had my wife not told me to go to the doctors, I'd be dead by now. This is definitely the short version of my story, but the point is, go to the doctors for a check-up or if something is not right. It might save your life.\"\n\n—Anonymous, 42, Male, Atlanta, Georgia\n\n\"Right before my 33rd birthday, my father passed, and a month before, I had gotten a divorce. So when my period came on and didn't stop after 15 days, I figured maybe my hormones were messed up since I was going through a lot emotionally. I didn't think too much about it — it'll stop eventually, I told myself. That was June of 2025; by August, I was still bleeding. It never stopped. I finally dragged myself into the doctor's office. I was in pain, I was anemic, and I showed up with photos where it looked like I was passing pure flesh the size of my hand. Something had to give.\"\n\n\"I finally got my second opinion four months later. I have endometrial cancer, and I am going to have a total hysterectomy at 33 years old next week. I'm not happy, but it's easier to process knowing what the problem is. And I can't help but wonder if someone had listened to me for all the years I was complaining, if maybe there could have been a treatment for my endometriosis before it turned cancerous.\n\nSo no, a normal cycle should not be 10-15 days per month. No, you should not feel like you are giving birth every month (cramping is normal, but it should not be so severe that you can't walk). If you are bleeding so much you have to resort to wearing a diaper — that's not normal. And if the doctor won't listen to you, make them. Don't wait until you are so anemic you need a transfusion (also not normal), and if you have every single symptom and they tell you the imaging is normal — make them get you a second opinion. Being a woman is hard, but it doesn't mean suffering in silence. Speak up.\"\n\n—Anonymous, 33, Female, Alabama\n\nAlso in Goodful: If You Can Complete More Than 15 Of These Common Phrases, Your Vocabulary Is Better Than 95% Of People’s\n\nAlso in Goodful: \"I Knew Instantly That He Would Be Dead Soon\": Doctors Are Sharing The Biggest Health Issues Patients Ignored Until It Was Too Late, And Whew, I've Been Warned\n\nAlso in Goodful: My Husband And I Separated.

    "fullText": "Victor Manuel Diaz, 36, was found by guards on Jan. 14 in a room at Camp East Montana in El Paso, Texas, after he tried to die by suicide, a camp official reported on a 911 call obtained by The Associated Press through a public information request.\n\n“They were doing rounds and they just found him with his pants tied up to his neck, I believe,” said the caller, who identified himself as a health administrator named Luis Gonzalez.\n\nDiaz’s death was at least the third of a detainee housed at Camp East Montana, which opened last year at Fort Bliss to hold 5,000 detainees in the desert near the U.S.-Mexico border. Advocates for detainees have alleged a pattern of violence, abuse and neglect at the camp. One earlier death has been ruled a homicide.\n\nRandall Kallinen, an attorney for Diaz's family, said they are suspicious of the claim that his death was a suicide because he was not depressed and would have been reunited with his mother, two sons and siblings in Nicaragua if he had been deported.\n\n“Even if it is suicide, was there something that happened to him that drove him to suicide?” Kallinen asked. “There still has to be an investigation.”\n\nMessages seeking comment were left with ICE on Wednesday.\n\nGonzalez did not witness Diaz's suicide attempt. A separate report by emergency medical services that was released Wednesday said Diaz was suspected of hanging himself with a bed sheet. Federal authorities have not released the findings of an autopsy, but have said the death was a “presumed suicide.”\n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement picked up Diaz on Jan. 6 as agents fanned out across Minneapolis looking for people who may be in the country illegally. He was then sent to the sprawling Texas tent complex.\n\nDiaz crossed the U.S.-Mexico border in 2024, requested asylum and was released. A judge later ordered his removal after he didn’t show up for an immigration hearing, according to ICE.\n\nRelatives in Nicaragua lost contact with Diaz after he went to work at a suburban restaurant on Jan. 6 and later learned he'd been detained. They received a call on Jan. 15 from ICE saying Diaz was dead. Family members “were in disbelief,” said Carlos Morales, board president of Texas Nicaraguan Community, a nonprofit that helped the family raise money to repatriate Diaz's remains to Nicaragua.\n\nA coalition of groups and a Democratic congresswoman who represents El Paso have called for Camp East Montana to be closed.\n\nSome of those calls came after the Jan. 3 death of 55-year-old Cuba native Geraldo Lunas Campos. A medical examiner has ruled that a homicide, citing physical restraint by guards.\n\nA witness has described guards pinning Lunas Campos to the ground in handcuffs, with one restraining him in a chokehold until he could no longer breathe. ICE has said the guards intervened to try to help Lunas Campos after he attempted suicide, and that he resisted them. A camp official initially told police it was a suicide.\n\nLawyers for the family of Lunas Campos have asked a judge for an emergency order to prevent ICE from deporting detainees who witnessed the struggle.\n\nICE, which oversees the camp, announced Diaz’s death on Jan. 18, saying security staff “found Diaz unconscious and unresponsive in his room.” The agency said he “died of a presumed suicide” but that the cause was still under investigation.\n\nIn addition to Lunas Campos and Diaz, ICE announced that on Dec. 3 an immigrant from Guatemala held in Camp East Montana died after being transferred to a El Paso hospital for care. The agency said Francisco Gaspar-Andres, 48, was suspected to have died of liver and kidney failure.\n\nUnlike with the two prior deaths, Diaz’s body wasn’t sent to the county medical examiner in El Paso for an autopsy. Kallinen said an Armed Forces pathologist conducted the autopsy at Fort Bliss, and that he's been told it could take months for findings to be released.\n\nThe 911 caller in the case told the dispatcher that a team of doctors and nurses were working to try to revive Diaz after his suicide attempt and they needed an ambulance.\n\nParamedics found him laying on his back in a hospital bed without a heartbeat, according to an El Paso Fire Department incident report.\n\nAP reporter Michael Biesecker contributed from Washington.",

    "description": "A former marketing manager explains why leaving corporate life to freelance after having kids led to burnout and mental health struggles.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Katie Bullon of activ Marketing Franchise. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nBefore I got pregnant with my firstborn, I was working in the corporate world as a marketing manager. It was an intense job that I absolutely loved, both as a single person and then as a newly married one. I got to travel the world, quickly advance in my career, and diversify my skill set, but I could only do the job because I didn't yet have kids.\n\nI knew once I started a family, I wouldn't want to continue working in the corporate world full time. I never wanted to be in a position where I had to choose between taking care of my kids and doing my job, so I initially decided to go back to my role part time, thinking that would be a happy medium.\n\nBut after keeping in touch day, a reintroduction to work after maternity leave, when my son was 7 months old, it became clear I couldn't even manage the part time role. To do the job well, to the high standard I expected of myself, I had to give it my everything.\n\nI remember finishing the keeping in touch day, crying in my boss's office, telling her I just couldn't come back. The day had been a reminder of my old life — the life of a young, free, travelling corporate marketer. It was a life I knew I couldn't maintain with a baby in tow, and I mourned the end of my life as a corporate professional.\n\nI quit my job and, after months of deliberation and dreaming, decided to go freelance — I was really excited. Surely, I thought, I would strike a healthy balance of parenting and working if I worked for myself.\n\nThe plan would be to devote all my attention to my son when he was awake, and pull out my laptop to work while he slept.\n\nBut the reality of being self-employed as a new mom was not what I had imagined.\n\nI was running on empty all the time, exhausted from sleepless nights. I didn't know what I was doing with parenting, as I had never done it before, and often felt I was doing it all wrong. I adored my son even more than I had imagined I would, and not being with him while I worked constantly pulled at my heartstrings.\n\nIt was from this state that I then tried to work, attempting to be at clients' full-time disposal. Even though I knew about marketing, I didn't fully take into account the amount of work or the number of non-billable hours I'd be working as a self-employed individual. As opposed to working for a corporate company, I was the sole person responsible for every aspect of the business. It was all on me.\n\nNot keen on putting my son in a day care to save us a bit of money, I tried to build the business with him around most of the time, save for a few hours a week when my mom or sister would have him.\n\nI was on a hamster wheel from the moment I woke up, becoming more and more exhausted as I tried to work as if I didn't have a child, and parent as if I didn't have a job.\n\nThe standards I set for myself as a mother and business owner were unachievable, and I could feel myself starting to burn out as I attempted to do it all.\n\nOnly 20 months after my first son was born, I gave birth to my second son, and I continued trying to balance my own business with parenting, this time with a toddler and newborn in tow.\n\nMy second didn't ever take a bottle, so I frequently sat with him breastfeeding on one side with my laptop set up on the other. I was absolutely determined to do it all, and do it all perfectly.\n\nI suppose part of me wanted to prove people wrong, to show them that I could be a completely present mother while also being an incredibly successful self-starter.\n\nMy mental health crashed. My physical health deteriorated. My relationship with my husband was rocky. I was exhausted all the time and felt like I had hit rock bottom.\n\nIt wasn't what I had expected freelancing to be like, and it most certainly wasn't what I wanted motherhood to be like.\n\nWhile self-employment might seem like the \"easier than corporate path\" for new mothers, it wasn't — not for me.\n\nSomething had to change, so I went back to the drawing board, considering what I could do differently, and joined a marketing franchise. It allowed me to continue doing what I loved, marketing, but I had the back office and a team of people behind me to carry out all the work that had overwhelmed me when I was working on my own.\n\nIf I could go back in time and give myself advice, I would say: You can't do it all, nor should you.\n\nAs a mom, I can't put myself last. I must build my life in a way that prioritizes me; otherwise, I'll burn out repeatedly, which is detrimental to ume, my family, and my work.",

    "description": "Oprah Winfrey's newest book, \"Enough,\" is about her relationship with weight-loss drugs. Since the '90s, she has been combining her health with business.",
    "fullText": "Oprah Winfrey has spent years turning her private health journey into a public conversation — and, at times, a lucrative business.\n\nThe billionaire, real-estate mogul, talk-show host, journalist, actor, and producer has just released her 12th book: \"Enough: Your Health, Your Weight, and What It's Like To Be Free.\"\n\nThe book, which she co-authored with Dr. Ania M. Jastreboff, a doctor and professor at Yale's School of Medicine, dives into the role of GLP-1 drugs to facilitate weight loss.\n\nThe practice is something that Winfrey herself has touted. On CNN in December 2024, she said she had first begun using a GLP-1 before Christmas in 2023.\n\nWinfrey has been combining her personal health and fitness with business for decades, including investing in WeightWatchers (now WW International), writing books about health, identifying exercise and health trends for her show and magazine, and putting her support behind figures like Dr. Mehmet Oz, who is now the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\nWinfrey did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nHere's a timeline of how her health empire has evolved.\n\nDuring a 1988 episode of \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" — a few years after Joan Rivers asked about Winfrey's weight gain — Winfrey wheeled out a red wagon filled with 67 pounds of animal fat.\n\nWhy? To convey to her audience how much weight she'd lost in the last year while on the Optifast liquid diet.\n\nThe episode put a spotlight on medically supervised liquid formula diets. After it aired, The New York Times reported that Winfrey got just 400 calories a day from Optifast and wrote that the ability of people on such diets \"to maintain the loss is questionable and not yet fully evaluated.\"\n\nFor a 2005 issue of O, The Oprah Magazine, Winfrey wrote, \"For four solid months, I didn't eat a single morsel of food,\" and lost 67 pounds. \"What I didn't know was that my metabolism was shot. Two weeks after I returned to real food, I was up 10 pounds.\"\n\nWhile she was proud of losing the weight, Winfrey later regretted the decision to pull the wagon out.\n\n\"When I look at that show, I think it was one of the biggest ego trips of my life,\" Winfrey told Entertainment Tonight in 2011.\n\nShe cowrote \"Make the Connection: Ten Steps to a Better Body and a Better Life\" with exercise physiologist (and her personal trainer) Bob Greene.\n\nThe 10 steps included guidance such as \"exercise 20 to 60 minutes a day,\" \"eat a low-fat, balanced diet,\" and \"eat three meals and two snacks each day.\"\n\nIt went on to become a No. 1 bestseller and is still in circulation.\n\nWinfrey introduced audiences to Phil McGraw, aka Dr. Phil, in the late '90s as her show's resident relationship expert. He proved so popular that Winfrey produced and co-created a spinoff of \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" starring McGraw: \"Dr. Phil.\" It aired from 2002 to 2023, and for most of its run, it was second in ratings only to Winfrey's show.\n\nLike Winfrey, McGraw frequently discussed weight loss and health on his show, and also lent his face and name to nutritional supplements. As The New York Times wrote in 2003, \"Oprah Winfrey has talked about weight loss — hers and everyone else's — for years. Her protégé Dr. Phil has found a way to make money from it.\"\n\nHe's also written his own weight-loss books, including \"The Ultimate Weight Solution: The 7 Keys to Weight Loss Freedom\" and \"The Ultimate Weight Solution Food Guide.\"\n\nWinfrey also introduced Dr. Mehmet Oz to her show's audience. He made his \"Oprah\" debut in 2004 and ultimately appeared more than 60 times, per NPR, before Winfrey greenlit \"The Dr. Oz Show\" in 2009. It aired until 2022, when he began a US Senate campaign in Pennsylvania.\n\nSimilarly, Oz's program featured many segments on weight loss, and Oz himself endorsed multiple \"cures\" for obesity that have been disproven. He was appointed administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services in 2024.\n\nWhile it's not known how much money Winfrey made from their two shows, both aired for over a decade (with reruns on Winfrey's channel, OWN), and Winfrey's production company, Harpo Productions, was involved throughout.\n\nWinfrey's own show, which aired for 25 years, was the foundation of her wealth, rocketing her to millionaire status when it became nationally syndicated in 1986. By 2003, she was a billionaire, and she's now worth an estimated $3.2 billion, Forbes reported.\n\nIn 2015, Winfrey announced she was joining the board of WeightWatchers (now known as WW International, or WW) and was purchasing a 10% stake in the company worth $43 million.\n\nThe New York Times reported in 2015 that it led to an increase of $400 million in market value for the brand, which had been trending downward before Winfrey's involvement.\n\n\"WeightWatchers has given me the tools to begin to make the lasting shift that I and so many of us who are struggling with weight have longed for,\" she said in a statement. \"I believe in the program so much I decided to invest in the company and partner in its evolution.\"\n\nIt's an example of the Oprah Effect: the trend of Winfrey endorsing, supporting, or investing in a brand that leads to a spike in value.\n\nWinfrey posted on X (then Twitter) a video about how she'd lost 26 pounds on WeightWatchers while still eating bread.\n\n\"I love bread,\" she said. \"That's the genius of this program. I lost 26 pounds, and I have eaten bread every single day.\"\n\nAccording to MarketWatch, the subsequent bump in the stock price, just one hour after the post, netted Winfrey around $12 million.\n\nWinfrey's cookbook, which also reached bestseller status, incorporated the WeightWatchers system into its recipes and flagged the number of points each meal was worth, in a neat bit of corporate synergy.\n\nSoon after confirming her use of a GLP-1, Winfrey publicly said she wouldn't be seeking reelection to the board.\n\nThe announcement sent WeightWatchers' stock tumbling 25%. As Business Insider wrote at the time, it seemed like Winfrey was jumping ship from an \"outdated operating system\" in the age of Ozempic and other GLP-1s.\n\nWinfrey's latest book, \"Enough,\" which she cowrote with Dr. Ania M. Jastreboff, was released in January 2026. It details Winfrey's experience with GLP-1s, combined with Jastreboff's expertise.\n\nWinfrey has been promoting her book heavily, including a stop on \"CBS Sunday Morning,\" where she explained how reframing her relationship to obesity and weight has changed her life.\n\n\"I'm not going to, but I could weep right now for all of the many days and nights I've journaled about this being my fault and why can't I conquer this thing?\" she said.\n\n\"There are tools to use that can help you. And I do see [GLP-1s] as a tool,\" she continued.",

    "description": "A functional medicine doctor shared lifestyle habits that can boost metabolic health, such as strength training and getting better sleep.",
    "fullText": "How quickly your body burns fat can sometimes feel out of your control. For Dr. Adam Perlman, it's one of the biggest laments he's heard from patients.\n\n\"I can't tell you how many times I've had patients who have had so much trouble losing weight complain to me that their friends can eat whatever they want and never put weight on,\" Perlman, an integrative and functional medicine doctor and former chief medical officer for Mayo Clinic's integrative medicine program, told Business Insider.\n\nIt's also one of the biggest misconceptions he hears about metabolic health.\n\n\"Your genetics aren't your destiny,\" he said, even if they play a role. \"You can counter a lot of those genetics with the right type of interventions, particularly around lifestyle.\"\n\nLuckily, none of those involve eating less, the other big myth he hears around losing fat. \"Sometimes, if you restrict your diet too much, it really backfires because you go into this sort of scarcity state,\" he added.\n\nWhile he said it's important to speak to a doctor and rule out potential underlying issues of unexplained weight gain, like thyroid function, he said there are a few simple lifestyle changes everyone can make to boost their metabolic health and burn fat faster.\n\nFrom his experience, Perlman has seen people lean on heavy exercise, particularly cardio workouts, to shed fat fast.\n\nWhile aerobic exercise has other health benefits, he said that there isn't great evidence that movement alone will lead to drastic weight loss.\n\nStrength training, however, has its own metabolic benefits. Because muscle is a more metabolically active tissue, having higher muscle mass helps you burn more calories at rest over time.\n\nPerlman said he encourages strength training to his patients and performs a bioelectric scan to measure their body's composition of muscle and fat. He especially emphasizes it to older patients who may be going through hormonal changes, like during menopause, or experiencing a natural decrease in muscle mass.\n\n\"People begin to develop what they perceive as a slowing of metabolism, where part of the issue is that they're not maintaining their muscle mass the way they need to,\" he said. \"Making sure they're getting strength training is particularly Important.\"\n\nPerlman is particularly fascinated by newer science that links a slower metabolism to issues with your gut microbiome.\n\nCertain microbes, like the gut bacterium akkermansia muciniphila, thrive on fiber and polyphenols found in foods like raspberries and artichokes. Their byproducts can signal the body to release hormones that help regulate appetite and blood sugar.\n\nEating lots of ultra-processed foods can disrupt this cycle. But even if you follow the Mediterranean diet, you might still struggle with losing fat due to a lack of variety in your meals, he said.\n\n\"By and large, what you want is to make sure you eat the rainbow,\" he said. \"So a mix of different types of plants, which is really a mix of different types of fibers that the body tends to feed on.\"\n\nA lack of sleep disrupts your hormones, making it harder to lose fat.\n\nWhat's more, even a consistent sleep schedule during the work week won't make up for late nights on the weekend.\n\n\"A lot of people have what's called 'social jet lag,'\" Perlman said, where they go to bed at 10 p.m. on weekdays but 2 a.m. on Saturday nights. \"That really wreaks havoc on your health, on your microbiome, on other aspects of your health as well.\"\n\nFor Perlman, getting better sleep has been the most recent change he's made to boost his own metabolic health.\n\n\"If you came to my home, you'd see that we have blackout shades, I use a new noise machine at night, I turn the temperature down before I go to bed,\" he said. \"Sleep has been one that I've definitely been focused on.\"",

The chain's stock opened 9% higher after it reported its first comparable transaction increase in the US in eight quarters.\n\nEven Niccol himself appears to be getting in on the protein craze. On Wednesday's call, the CEO said that he \"might have started my day with a vanilla protein latte.\"\n\nThe key, he said, is getting the word about the offering to more people.\n\n\"Awareness is still pretty surprisingly low, but the trial and the repeat rates are really, really great — meaning, when someone tries it, we see a high level of repeat, and it has proven to be highly incremental,\" Niccol said. \"So this is one we want to keep doing.\"",

    "description": "Health insurance stocks fell hard Tuesday morning as investors digested a CMS report proposing a lower-than-expected increase to 2027 Medicare Advantage plans.",
    "fullText": "The health insurance sector saw a deep sell-off Tuesday, led by a plunge in UnitedHealth Group (UNH) shares, as the Trump administration proposed a lower-than-expected increase to 2027 Medicare Advantage plans.\n\nIn a report published Monday night by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the administration proposed that payment rates for Medicare Advantage plans (private insurance plans) will rise by just 0.09% in 2027. Analysts were expecting an increase of as much as 6%.\n\nUnitedHealth (UNH) lost nearly 20%, while fellow major insurers Elevance Health (ELV) and CVS (CVS) each shed around 14%.\n\nThe smaller-than-expected proposal comes as margins are already tight for insurers. When UNH reported earnings Tuesday morning, the company said its Medical Care Ratio sat at 89.1%. Other insurers have reported similar rates.\n\nThe MCR is a key metric that measures the percentage of premium revenue spent on medical claims and healthcare services for policy members. In UNH's case, the company uses $0.89 of every dollar the company makes from the premiums it charges customers to pay for medical care.\n\nUnitedHealth has the largest exposure among insurers to Medicare Advantage changes, accounting for roughly 30% of enrollment nationally. Humana (HUM), which comes in second with roughly 17% of national enrollment, also saw shares plunge over 20% on Tuesday.\n\nThe tiny increase for 2027 comes after the insurance got a 5.06% increase for 2026, higher than expected. Final numbers for 2027 are scheduled to be finalized on or before April 6, according to William Blair analysts.\n\nIn a statement released after the CMS report, a spokesperson for the insurance industry group AHIP said that, if the proposal is to be implemented, it \"could result in benefit cuts and higher costs for 35 million seniors and people with disabilities when they renew their Medicare Advantage coverage in October 2026.\"\n\nThe proposal \"represents an additional headwind for the [Medicare Advantage] sector, further pressuring industry fundamentals,\" William Blair analysts wrote in a note to clients published on Tuesday.\n\nUnitedHealth, the country's largest insurer, took a secondary hit Tuesday morning when the company reported fourth quarter and full-year 2025 revenues that came in below expectations.\n\nFourth quarter and full-year revenue came in at $113.2 billion and $447.6 billion, respectively, compared to estimates of $113.7 billion and $447.9 billion. Both fourth quarter and full-year revenues were up 12% against the previous year.",

In comparison, Medicare Advantage payments in 2026 rose 5.06% from 2025.\n\nThe proposed payment increase was well below Wall Street's expectations, with RBC Capital Markets analysts expecting an \"at least a mid-single digit increase.\" The analysts noted that historically, the final payment rate is higher than the initial proposal.\n\nDr. Mehmet Oz, CMS administrator, said the \"proposed payment policies are about making sure Medicare Advantage works better for the people it serves,\" while \"protecting taxpayers from unnecessary spending that is not oriented towards addressing real health needs.\"\n\nThe CMS proposal also includes updates to the Medicare Advantage risk adjustment model, such as excluding diagnosis information not associated with a specific beneficiary encounter.",

Air pollution directly affects the environment and all of the plants, animals, and humans living in it.\n\nOften called the \"silent killer,\" air pollution is one of the biggest health emergencies since tobacco, according to the WHO, contributing to higher risks of everything from respiratory infections and heart disease to asthma and cancer.\n\nAn investigation by the Guardian this year found that 98% of people in Europe were breathing air that breached WHO guidelines.\n\nThe WHO states that this is true for almost all of the global population, with air pollution responsible for 6.7 million premature deaths annually.\n\nOver the years, knowledge has become power in identifying ways we can improve air quality.\n\nThe Clean Air Act requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to regulate and monitor toxic gases released into the atmosphere.\n\nIn recent years, the EPA has taken steps to minimize pollution from large industrial facilities and transportation, two huge contributors to the health crisis we face today.\n\nTransitioning to clean energy, like solar and wind, is vital to reducing air-polluting gases.\n\nSometimes it's hard to know where to start fighting the problem at home, but it's easier than you think.\n\nRecycling, thrifting, and repurposing products are amazing ways to make a difference. You can also purchase an air purifier to cleanse your living space.\n\nSwitching to public transportation and taking walks when possible instead of using gas-powered vehicles are other low-effort ways to help the issue of air pollution. If you're in the market for a new car, think about upgrading to an electric vehicle.\n\n\"The good news is that clean-air policy works,\" Sinkevičius told the Guardian. \"But we need to do better still and bring pollution levels down further.\"\n\nJoin our free newsletter for weekly updates on the coolest innovations improving our lives and saving our planet.",

    "description": "\"At a time when the universe had robbed me — of my husband’s health and companionship, of security, contentment and peace of mind — she offered me a gift.\"",
    "fullText": "Ten minutes after my husband arrived in his hospital room, the space throbbed with doctors, nurses, therapists and technicians. Warnings beeped on machines. White coats huddled and whispered. And then Joel was rushed back out the door, gurney wheels spinning, propelled by a fleet of scrubs in sprint mode.\n\nWe had just returned from the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro. Our next trip would be from Wisconsin to Portland, Oregon, to welcome our first grandchild. But first, Joel elected to have a hip replacement. He counted on it to improve his quality of life.\n\nAlso Read: I Was 21 When My Doctors Told Me I Had A Year To Live. What Happened Next Left Them Stunned.\n\nInstead, a nick from the retractor caused a life-threatening bleed that set off a cascade of catastrophes. Within a few hours, he went from a healthy, active, 63-year-old to an unconscious, life-support-dependent ICU patient. Kidney failure followed, plus an obstructed colon and compartment syndrome — all complications of what should have been a routine procedure.\n\nTo make matters worse, the doctor who ****** up his hip replacement was in charge of fixing the mistake.\n\nI had trusted too much — the doctors, the hospital, the statistics proclaiming hip replacement common and safe.\n\nWhy hadn’t I asked more questions? I thought, berating myself. Why hadn’t I educated myself about the risks? Why hadn’t I asked for the procedure to be done at a larger, regional facility?\n\nAlso Read: My Husband's Medical Team Was Failing Him. Then A Stranger Stepped In And Said 6 Words That Saved His Life.\n\nPrepared for a one- to three-day hospital stay, with a return to normal in six weeks, Joel instead embarked on a monthslong hospitalization with no guaranteed survival. And since he was drugged into incoherence, I made decisions for him. With no medical knowledge and little experience in trauma, surgeries or hospitals, I once again trusted too much.\n\nThe staff invited me to daily briefings, but their terminology confused me, and I missed information because they talked so fast. I wanted to go back in time. I hoped it was all a dream. Still, I tried to memorize their words and repeat each message to our daughters.\n\nThe community hospital’s small cadre of ICU nurses monitored Joel around the clock, checking his breathing tube, supervising dialysis and scheduling multiple surgeries per week. Nurses handed me consent forms with little explanation, assuring me each surgery was essential to remove dead tissue from Joel’s leg. I signed the forms until 90% of his lower leg muscle was gone.\n\nI had so many questions: Why was the doctor who botched the hip replacement now in charge of Joel’s recovery? Why did the lead surgeon disregard the colon specialist’s recommendation to have Joel evaluated elsewhere? Why was there a rotating staff instead of one director in charge of intensive care? And why were two of Joel’s doctors arguing at the central ICU desk?\n\nThat’s when a rabbi came to see me.\n\nAlso Read: I Pursued Motherhood Despite Past Psychosis -- Then This Happened\n\n“You know what they’re arguing about, don’t you?” she said.\n\nShe never asked if we were Jewish (we’re not) or if I needed spiritual guidance.\n\nJust minutes before, a nurse had told me one doctor advocated amputating Joel’s leg; the other disagreed. The argument continued.\n\nWhy only two doctors instead of a larger team? I wondered. Why did they not ask my opinion? Who would make the ultimate decision?\n\nAlso Read: Since I Was A Child, I've Known Things I Had No Way Of Knowing. I Hid My Abilities Out Of Fear — Until Now.\n\n“You can request a different hospital,” she told me calmly, as though she had been reading my thoughts. “You could have your husband transferred.”\n\nThose six words seemed so obvious.\n\nTwenty minutes to the east was a prominent medical facility affiliated with a medical college and staffed with hundreds of doctors, research teams, and state-of-the-art equipment. But in the fuzz of shock and stress, I hadn’t considered this alternative.\n\n“Maybe discuss it with your daughters,” the rabbi said.\n\nAlso Read: I'm A Doctor Who Almost Died Because My Own Doctors Refused To Do This 1 Basic Thing\n\nFor the first time in two weeks, I sensed someone on my side. She had assessed the situation and proposed I abandon the place that employed her. She suggested there was a better place than the one she represented. But more than that, she gave me agency. She assumed I had power even as I felt powerless. She assumed I was fierce even as I felt impotent.\n\nHer suggestion seemed impossible. Doctors, not wives, made decisions.\n\nWould anyone listen to me? I wondered. How would I move a critically ill man who needed minute-by-minute monitoring?\n\nStill, I knew if I didn’t act quickly, my husband’s leg could be gone. He could even lose his life.\n\nI went home, and I made phone calls to that regional hospital. I discovered a team of limb salvage specialists who saved legs instead of amputating them, and I found a doctor to supervise my husband’s case.\n\nAt 7 a.m. the next day, intimidated and fearful, I approached the authority figures I had been taught to trust — the medical professionals who towered from their self-constructed pedestals. I told them I had initiated a transfer and my husband would be leaving their facility.\n\nAll day, I endured delays, waiting for a bed, waiting for approval, waiting for coordination — waiting, waiting, waiting.\n\nAt 10 p.m., Joel was transferred in an ambulance to the larger hospital, where he would spend the next 2 1/2 months.\n\nHe still required surgeries, feeding tubes and dialysis. But now, he had a team of doctors dedicated to saving both limb and life, with resources beyond those in the local hospital. And he had a wife with a voice.\n\nWould I have found my voice without that rabbi? I’m not convinced I would have. But once I initiated change, I intended to do it again.\n\nNot all my requests were heeded. But sometimes, when I pointed out a symptom or insisted on a test, my inquiry led to a new treatment. My husband experienced medical errors in this new hospital too, but he survived. And aside from the leg brace he now wears, the blue handicapped sign on our car and the scar from his temporary colostomy, he is whole.\n\nCompared to the dying man who laid unconscious and immobile, Joel is changed. I’m changed too. Shortly after Joel returned home, I consulted a law firm about a malpractice suit. After almost a year of meetings and investigations, they advised us to abandon the case. Wisconsin had a cap on damages, and the burden was too great to prove negligence.\n\nDespite that disappointment, I still speak up. Now, before every doctor appointment, I compose a list of questions, complaints and possible treatments. When a doctor pooh-poohs a test, I challenge their opinion. When a nurse minimizes a symptom, I repeat my concern. When a result goes unnoticed, I call attention to it. And my advocacy goes beyond medicine. When I appeared in court on a probate issue, I wrote a script for my lawyer with points to make to the judge.\n\nAlthough drugs, surgeries, therapies and hard work saved and rehabilitated my husband, it was a complete stranger who precipitated his move to the proper facility — and very well may have saved his life. Though life often seems impersonal, with virtual meetings instead of face-to-face interactions, texts instead of phone calls and blood tests instead of bedside manner, she made me feel connected to and cared for.\n\nAt a time when the universe had robbed me — of my husband’s health and companionship, of security, contentment and peace of mind — she offered me a gift. Expecting nothing in return, she stood by my side and held me up. She gave me confidence and hope. Her compassion healed and transformed as much as any test or treatment and left me looking for ways to pay her kindness forward.\n\nThis piece originally ran in February 2025 and is being shared again as part of HuffPost Personal’s “Best Of” series.\n\nNancy Jorgensen is a Wisconsin-based writer, educator and collaborative pianist.

    "fullText": "This live blog is refreshed periodically throughout the day with the latest updates from the market.To find the latest Stock Market Today threads, click here.\n\nHappy Monday. This is TheStreet’s Stock Market Today for Jan. 26, 2026. You can follow the latest updates on the market here in our daily live blog.\n\nThe Trump Administration has reportedly proposed keeping reimbursement rates for Medicare plans almost flat year-over-year, much to the detriment of already slammed health insurers like UnitedHealth, Humana, CVS Health, and the like.\n\nThe proposal, first reported in WSJ this evening, says that payments will increase by an average rate of \"0.09%\" in 2027. The reaction after hours has been stark. On news of the report, the aforementioned three firms --- among the largest Medicare Advantage providers --- fell 8.8%, 12.8%, and 9.5% after the bell.\n\nAlthough over half of U.S. equities were in decline today, large caps kept the market on track. The Dow (+0.64%), S&P 500(+0.50%), and Nasdaq (+0.43%) continued a four day winning streak, while the Russell 2000 (-0.36%) suffered modest declines.\n\nTop of mind for most investors were forthcoming earnings and the Fed rate decision due out tomorrow. Earnings alone would have been a sufficient distraction this week, with reports from Apple, Microsoft, Meta, Tesla, and others. However, the Fed is also expected to release its rate decision tomorrow, adding to the busy state of affairs this week.\n\nThrough midday, things have taken a small turn. The Russell 2000 (-0.21%), once leading the pack is now the sole decliner among major indexes. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq (+0.71%) has pulled ahead.\n\nIn their fourth straight winning session, 56.1% (3,103) U.S. issues are now seen declining, but the 41.5% (2,293) lifting the market are putting up quite the fight.\n\nThat said, here are today's midday movers, our daily list of the top and bottom 20 stocks with at least a $2 billion market cap. Here, we aim to capture the biggest stories on markets\n\nUSA Rare Earth (+14.86%) is fetching a bid today after the U.S. government confirmed it would take a 10% stake in the business, making it today's best-performer.\n\nIt's joined by a handful of software companies; DigitalOcean (+12.27%), Pattern Group (+12.06%), Cloudflare (+10.74%), and Zoom Communications (+9.87%) are also putting up a strong performance today after a weak week for software stocks.",

    "description": "\"Your body can’t metabolize it properly.\"",
    "fullText": "Soda is never the beverage of choice when it comes to health, but some types are better than others. If you want to drink Coca-Cola, for example, there are several varieties to choose from, with noticeable differences between them.\n\nContent creator David Céspedes (@dr.davidcespedes) recently shared a video revealing which variety of this iconic soda is the best of the worst, as AS reported.\n\n\"If you're going to drink supermarket Coca-Cola, I'll explain which one you should never touch and which is the least harmful,\" the doctor says in his video.\n\nDiet Coke and Coca-Cola Zero Sugar are the worst, Céspedes reveals.\n\n\"The main problem is aspartame,\" he says, referring to the artificial sweetener used in place of sugar in these diet products. \"Your body can't metabolize it properly, and it disrupts your brain, your gut microbiome, and your overall system.\"\n\nHowever, that doesn't make regular Coca-Cola healthy, as other experts have also highlighted.\n\n\"It's not safe either because it contains high-fructose corn syrup,\" says Céspedes. \"It's a ticking time bomb for your liver. One can has about 36 grams of sugar, enough to spike your blood sugar and increase inflammation.\"\n\nEven the container that the Coke comes in makes a difference. Céspedes points out that the plastic bottles shed microplastics into the soda you drink — the same effect that makes drinking bottled water unhealthy.\n\nCéspedes' position that drinking cola is never good for you has been backed up by experts, as Verywell Health reported. It leads to issues as small as acne breakouts and as large as heart disease.\n\nAll of that is on top of the negative impact of plastic bottles on the planet.\n\nDo you think forever chemicals should be banned from all products?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nIf you can minimize your impact by switching to a similar, healthier product, that's better for you and for the entire world.\n\nUltimately, Céspedes recommends one specific product.\n\n\"If you're going to drink Coke, at least choose glass bottles,\" he says. \"They don't have the plastic lining of cans and usually use cane sugar, which your body handles much better than high-fructose corn syrup. … If you're going to indulge, do it with a glass bottle, in moderation, and knowing exactly what's inside.\"\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "title": "The CEO of a $2 billion healthcare firm only felt rich after he paid off $100K in student loans—but that joy ‘disappeared’ in less than 3 days",
    "description": "Virta Health CEO Sami Inkinen only felt like he “made it” once in 2008, when he was able to pay off $100,000 in debt. He didn’t own a car until he was 37, and is “happy with very little.”",
    "fullText": "When envisioning the CEO of a billion-dollar company, it’s easy to fall victim to the clichés: a well-manicured businessman adorned in designer clothes, jet-setting from one international meeting to the next, a team of assistants in tow. But not every entrepreneur enjoys the spoils of their success with a glitzy lifestyle—some are simply thankful to pay off their student loans.\n\nSerial entrepreneur Sami Inkinen has founded and scaled three different companies—including two unicorns—throughout his 20-year career. While the Virta Health CEO has built wealth thanks to his business success, he isn’t concerned with his net worth. In fact, Inkinen only viewed himself as wealthy when he was able to repay the $100,000 of student debt that was burning a hole in his bank account.\n\n“There’s one moment in my life that I felt rich. And then after that, I’ve never thought of money,” Inkinen tells Fortune. In 2008, three years after Inkinen cofounded real estate search company Trulia, he sold off a batch of secondary shares worth $500,000 pre-tax. “I had enough money to pay all my student debts. I was able to buy whatever I wanted, and it was a very expensive bicycle purchase, [and] furnishing my tiny apartment in San Francisco.”\n\nThe immigrant entrepreneur first made his foray into entrepreneurship with mobile software company Matchem back in 2000 when he was still living in Finland. After two and a half years serving as the cofounder and VP of business development, Inkinen sold the organization for a few million dollars, and uprooted his life in Europe to head to the U.S.\n\nThe Gen X entrepreneur attended Stanford’s MBA program, graduating in 2005 with an advanced business degree and $100,000 of student debt. Consulting giant McKinsey floated him a six-figure job offer, flush with a $10,000 signing bonus. It was a chance for Inkinen to quickly pay off his loans, but he skirted the opportunity and returned to entrepreneurship.\n\nFor the next decade, the entrepreneur helped scale Trulia into an industry staple, before Zillow acquired the company for a whopping $3.5 billion in 2015. Now, Inkinen is 11 years into his third stint as a founder, serving as the CEO of $2 billion healthcare business Virta Health. His student loans are squared away, bills are covered, and housing is fully furnished.\n\nInkinen will always remember the excitement of financial security he felt back in 2008, but stipulates the thrill was fleeting. It’s not in his nature to be “money-driven,” the executive says.\n\n“This feeling of money bringing happiness disappeared in less than two or three days. I was like, ‘Okay, well, it’s nice that I have no debt,’” Inkinen explains. “Money isn’t going to make my life or break it, and it’s not going to bring happiness.”",

    "fullText": "The unshakeable influence of the Kardashians over the past decade has led to a rise in women trying to achieve the perfect, round derrière. But strong buttocks aren’t just an aesthetic goal – they have now also been recognised as an important indicator of our overall health.\n\n“The gluteus maximus is the powerhouse of all human movement,” says Dr Marjola Thanaj, a research fellow at the University of Westminster. “It’s a key trait that sets us apart from other primates.”\n\nA new study, led by Dr Thanaj, has revealed that the shape of the gluteus maximus muscles, found deep in our buttocks, can offer an early warning sign of the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes.\n\nA team of researchers at the University of Westminster used more than 60,000 MRI scans, collected by the UK Biobank project, to study the shifts in the muscles caused by age, lifestyle and the onset of disease. These were combined with lifestyle and health data for each individual.\n\nThe results showed that the muscles of men and women changed in markedly different ways, as each gender edged closer to developing Type 2 diabetes.\n\nIn men, there was a thinning of the gluteus maximus in specific regions – in some areas by as much as a quarter – giving it a more hollowed profile on scans. By contrast, the muscle appeared larger in women – deceptively, as this change was actually caused by fat infiltrating the muscle.\n\n“The findings suggest the gluteus maximus is a good indicator of metabolic health,” says Dr Thanaj.\n\nIt’s possible to spot clues in different bottom shapes that are likely to reflect the underlying health and function of the gluteus maximus muscle. Here are five common shapes and what they signify.\n\nWith fat evenly distributed in the upper and lower part of the buttocks, this shape is seen as highly desirable in women, reflected in the popularity of the “Brazilian bum lift”. In men, it is often associated with fitness and virility.\n\n“A round bottom could indicate good glute muscle mass and a good distribution of muscle and fat around the whole of the glutes,” says Dr Henry Chung, a lecturer in physiology at the University of Essex’s School of Sport, Rehabilitation and Exercise Sciences. “Because the bottom is more filled out, this could mean there is more muscle, which means more strength and stability.”\n\n“People with round bottoms are likely to have good lower body strength,” agrees Kate Rowe-Ham, a personal trainer and the author of the health and fitness book for midlife women, Owning Your Menopause. “They might be doing activities such as lifting weights, sprinting and climbing.”\n\nFullest at the bottom and tapering in near the waistline, this shape – most commonly seen in women – is also associated with health.\n\n“Women often dislike being pear-shaped, which means they have a tendency to hold their fat around their bottom and thighs, but it’s far healthier than carrying fat in the middle of your body, around your organs,” says Rowe-Ham.\n\nOverall size and tone matters, but if the buttocks are pert, rather than saggy, it’s a good sign. “This shape is a sign of better metabolic health compared to most of the others, showing strong mid-to-lower glutes and thighs,” says Dr Chung.\n\nThis shape has more mass in the upper portion of the bottom, with very little where it meets the thighs. It is common in post-menopausal women due to hormonal changes.\n\n“As women age and lose muscle, fat distribution can also shift from the bottom and thighs to the abdomen,” says Rowe-Ham. “They can find fat gathering around the hips and top of their bottom, creating ‘love handles’.”\n\nThis shape, which lacks volume, suggests weaker lower glutes and thighs, says Dr Chung.\n\nFlat across the hips and glutes, lacking fullness at either the top or lower part of the gluteus maximus, this shape can be seen in men or women – although it’s generally more pronounced in men due to their lack of hormone-driven fat around their hips and buttocks.\n\nIt often suggests a tendency to store fat around the middle or love handles, and can also imply reduced gluteal muscle volume or activity. “If that’s the case, it could result in lower overall lower-body strength, reduced hip and trunk stability and an increased load on the lower back and knees,” says Rowe-Ham.\n\nBoth men and women tend to lose mass in their gluteus maximus, along with skin elasticity and firmness, as they age. Flatter, saggier bottoms that have a deflated look are common, regardless of people’s weight. “I often see this even in very slim people,” says Rowe-Ham. “They might look great in clothes, but if they’re not exercising to maintain muscle mass they’re not future-proofing their bodies.”\n\n“Flat bottoms tend to mean weaker glutes, which can lead to issues such as back, knee or hip pain,” says Dr Chung. Poor posture, reduced mobility and lower strength are also potential issues.\n\nAs the largest muscle in the body, the gluteus maximus drives forward propulsion, stabilises the pelvis and trunk and enables us to walk, run, climb and rise from a seated to a standing position with efficiency and control.\n\nIt also plays a major role in how well we process and use energy – if we’re not doing so efficiently, it can lead to conditions such as Type 2 diabetes, fatty liver and cardiovascular disease.\n\n“Large muscles, like the gluteus, act almost like ‘engines’ of the body,” explains Dr Thanaj. “The healthier and stronger these muscles are, the better the body can manage blood sugar, store and burn fuel and support healthy ageing.”\n\nAlthough the new study suggested that Type 2 diabetes triggers different responses in men and women to the structure of their gluteus maximus, in both cases, there was a reduction of healthy muscle tissue.\n\nDr Chung explains that maintaining muscle in our bottoms is particularly important, as it is the main site for glucose uptake in the body. “More muscle means more glucose being absorbed and stored, which then lowers blood sugar levels,” he says.\n\n“Increasing muscle also increases resting metabolic rate – the calories burnt at rest – whereas having more fat does the opposite and decreases metabolic efficiency.”\n\nHe adds that this area of the body is also “massively linked with bodily movement and longevity – more muscle means slower ageing and the ability to keep lifting things, walking upstairs, balancing and much more for longer”.\n\nSeveral factors affect the shape and size of our bottoms, including our overall weight, which is influenced by the calories we consume and the amount of exercise we do.\n\n“Genetics, pelvic width, hip bone shape and where a person stores fat also play a huge role,” says Dr Chung. Women are biologically predisposed to store more fat around the hips and buttocks to support fertility, pregnancy and lactation, while men tend to have a higher proportion of lean muscle in the gluteal region, due to testosterone, strength and propulsion.\n\nMost of the fat we can see in this area will be subcutaneous, which is far less harmful than visceral fat found around the organs, linked to a higher risk of conditions including type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease and stroke and certain cancers.\n\n“However, intramuscular fat, deeper fat that infiltrates the muscles, reduces muscle efficiency and has a negative impact on metabolic health,” says Dr Chung.\n\nAgeing, inactivity and diseases such as type 2 diabetes and obesity are linked to higher levels of this type of fat, but exercise – particularly resistance training – helps reduce it.\n\n“Targeting the glutes is essential as we age, as strong muscles act as an anchor for the whole body so we can continue to run, jump, react to falls, maintain good balance and more,” says Dr Chung.\n\n“Take more frequent breaks to get moving,” he says. Ideally, we should aim to stand up and move every 30-60 minutes.\n\n“Elevate your heels slightly with a rolled-up mat or towel, which will help you get deeper into the squat and really target the glutes,” says Rowe-Ham.\n\nLie on your side, with your hand tucked under your head and knees bent at a 90-degree angle. Lift your top knee towards the ceiling like a clamshell opening, keeping hips stable and feet touching, and slowly lower back down. “It engages the glutes and also strengthens and stabilises the hips and core,” says Rowe-Ham.\n\n“Climb the stairs, or hills, or go hiking – find something that’s a bit more advanced than just walking,” says Dr Chung. This type of exercise will strengthen your leg muscles and give your entire cardiovascular system a workout as well as your glutes.\n\nTightening the buttocks for five seconds 10-15 times a day will activate and strengthen the muscles.\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "description": "Lena Beal, a cardiovascular dietitian, eats mostly whole, plant-based foods throughout the week. Sundays are for treats like sweet and alcohol.",
    "fullText": "As a registered dietitian, Lena Beal first learned about nutrition from her own family.\n\n\"My great-grandparents were farmers, so they grew nearly everything they ate, made their own preserves, the whole thing,\" Beal, a cardiovascular dietitian at Piedmont Atlanta Hospital and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, told Business Insider.\n\nHer roots inspired her profession. \"It was generational wisdom,\" she said. \"The foods that give us the most nutrients, the most pleasure, they're the most sustainable and practical.\" In her own life, she focuses on a minimally processed, plant-packed diet, incorporating chicken, fish and eggs on occasion.\n\nStill, it doesn't mean there isn't room for flexibility.\n\nOnce a week, Beal eats what she calls \"joy foods\": things she enjoys, like sweets and alcohol, which are best consumed in moderation. A Christian, Beal links joy foods to her Sabbath, or day of rest.\n\nEating her joy foods on Sundays is her version of the 80/20 diet, helping her stay on track with eating mostly heart-healthy foods — with the occasional treats. \"That way, I can enjoy them intentionally, but without feeling like I'm constantly negotiating with myself,\" she said.\n\nBeal shared what she eats in a week to get enough protein — and what a typical Sunday of fun looks like.\n\nGiven her focus on cardiovascular health, Beal said she has always focused on heart-healthy foods to keep her fueled throughout the day.\n\n\"It's subliminal,\" she said. \"Those things are extremely important to me: making sure I have hearty, fiber-rich, high-omega-3 foods with those macronutrients.\"\n\nOn a typical day, her meals look like this:\n\nShe focuses a lot on protein because she works out at least 3 to 4 days a week, including resistance training, brisk walking, and yoga. She said her target is reaching 150 minutes of moderate physical activity a week, the recommended goal for most people.\n\nHer diet helps her stay on track. \"Because my eating pattern is relatively consistent, it supports strength, energy, and flexibility,\" she said.\n\nBeal was never interested in intentionally following a strict vegan or vegetarian diet. Instead, her diet evolved over the past eight years to naturally involve less red meat.\n\n\"I wasn't a heavy red meat-eater in the first place.\" she said. \"I no longer enjoyed it. It was heavy for me.\" Having it once a week was easier for her because it didn't feel like much of a sacrifice.\n\nOn occasion, she'll eat leaner animal-based protein sources like chicken or turkey during the week, which have less saturated fat.\n\nWhen Sunday rolls around, she doesn't exactly go all out on sugar or cocktails, either. She still aims to stick to her normal habits, like eating a light dinner, because it ties into better sleep.\n\n\"I don't go too far out of bounds,\" she said. Treating herself might look like French toast, a mimosa, or fish in a richer cream sauce than she would pick during the week.\n\nIt's been the easiest way to keep a balance in her life. Beal, who's taught weight management classes in the past, said that words like \"diet\" or \"cheat foods\" can bring up a lot of negative feelings for people.\n\n\"I shy away from that language,\" she said. \"I call them 'joy foods' because they absolutely fit if you leave room for them intentionally.\"\n\nBeal takes a few supplements — vitamin D and iron — based on recommendations her doctor made, given her age and medical history.\n\nOtherwise, she gets all her nutrients from her diet, which she feels is easy to maintain because she eats whole foods she loves during the week, while being flexible enough to enjoy a sweet treat or glass of wine, too.\n\n\"Healthy eating works best when it leaves room for living,\" Beal said. \"It ought to feel like when you get up from a meal that you have good feelings, whether it's nostalgic, whether it satiates you. That's what food is.\"",

    "fullText": "Exclusive: German research into responses to health queries raises fresh questions about summaries seen by 2bn people a month\n\nHow the ‘confident authority’ of AI Overviews is putting public health at risk\n\nGoogle’s search feature AI Overviews cites YouTube more than any medical website when answering queries about health conditions, according to research that raises fresh questions about a tool seen by 2 billion people each month.\n\nThe company has said its AI summaries, which appear at the top of search results and use generative AI to answer questions from users, are “reliable” and cite reputable medical sources such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Mayo Clinic.\n\nHowever, a study that analysed responses to more than 50,000 health queries, captured using Google searches from Berlin, found the top cited source was YouTube. The video-sharing platform is the world’s second most visited website, after Google itself, and is owned by Google.\n\nResearchers at SE Ranking, a search engine optimisation platform, found YouTube made up 4.43% of all AI Overview citations. No hospital network, government health portal, medical association or academic institution came close to that number, they said.\n\n“This matters because YouTube is not a medical publisher,” the researchers wrote. “It is a general-purpose video platform. Anyone can upload content there (eg board-certified physicians, hospital channels, but also wellness influencers, life coaches, and creators with no medical training at all).”\n\nGoogle told the Guardian that AI Overviews was designed to surface high-quality content from reputable sources, regardless of format, and a variety of credible health authorities and licensed medical professionals created content on YouTube. The study’s findings could not be extrapolated to other regions as it was conducted using German-language queries in Germany, it said.\n\nThe research comes after a Guardian investigation found people were being put at risk of harm by false and misleading health information in Google AI Overviews responses.\n\nIn one case that experts said was “dangerous” and “alarming”, Google provided bogus information about crucial liver function tests that could have left people with serious liver disease wrongly thinking they were healthy. The company later removed AI Overviews for some but not all medical searches.\n\nThe SE Ranking study analysed 50,807 healthcare-related prompts and keywords to see which sources AI Overviews relied on when generating answers.\n\nThey chose Germany because its healthcare system is strictly regulated by a mix of German and EU directives, standards and safety regulations. “If AI systems rely heavily on non-medical or non-authoritative sources even in such an environment, it suggests the issue may extend beyond any single country,” they wrote.\n\nAI Overviews surfaced on more than 82% of health searches, the researchers said. When they looked at which sources AI Overviews relied on most often for health-related answers, one result stood out immediately, they said. The single most cited domain was YouTube with 20,621 citations out of a total of 465,823.\n\nThe next most cited source was NDR.de, with 14,158 citations (3.04%). The German public broadcaster produces health-related content alongside news, documentaries and entertainment. In third place was a medical reference site, Msdmanuals.com with 9,711 citations (2.08%).\n\nThe fourth most cited source was Germany’s largest consumer health portal, Netdoktor.de, with 7,519 citations (1.61%). The fifth most cited source was a career platform for doctors, Praktischarzt.de, with 7,145 citations (1.53%).\n\nThe researchers acknowledged limitations to their study. It was conducted as a one-time snapshot in December 2025, using German-language queries that reflected how users in Germany typically search for health information.\n\nResults could vary over time, by region, and by the phrasing of questions. However, even with those caveats, the findings still prompted alarm.\n\nHannah van Kolfschooten, a researcher specialising in AI, health and law at the University of Basel who was not involved with the research, said: “This study provides empirical evidence that the risks posed by AI Overviews for health are structural, not anecdotal. It becomes difficult for Google to argue that misleading or harmful health outputs are rare cases.\n\n“Instead, the findings show that these risks are embedded in the way AI Overviews are designed. In particular, the heavy reliance on YouTube rather than on public health authorities or medical institutions suggests that visibility and popularity, rather than medical reliability, is the central driver for health knowledge.”\n\nA Google spokesperson said: “The implication that AI Overviews provide unreliable information is refuted by the report’s own data, which shows that the most cited domains in AI Overviews are reputable websites. And from what we’ve seen in the published findings, AI Overviews cite expert YouTube content from hospitals and clinics.”\n\nGoogle said the study showed that of the 25 most cited YouTube videos, 96% were from medical channels. However, the researchers cautioned that these videos represented fewer than 1% of all the YouTube links cited by AI Overviews on health.\n\n“Most of them (24 out of 25) come from medical-related channels like hospitals, clinics and health organisations,” the researchers wrote. “On top of that, 21 of the 25 videos clearly note that the content was created by a licensed or trusted source.\n\n“So at first glance it looks pretty reassuring. But it’s important to remember that these 25 videos are just a tiny slice (less than 1% of all YouTube links AI Overviews actually cite). With the rest of the videos, the situation could be very different.”",

    "fullText": "Do I have the flu or Covid? Why do I wake up feeling tired? What is causing the pain in my chest? For more than two decades, typing medical questions into the world’s most popular search engine has served up a list of links to websites with the answers. Google those health queries today and the response will likely be written by artificial intelligence.\n\nSundar Pichai, Google’s chief executive, first set out the company’s plans to enmesh AI into its search engine at its annual conference in Mountain View, California, in May 2024. Starting that month, he said, US users would see a new feature, AI Overviews, which would provide information summaries above traditional search results. The change marked the biggest shake-up of Google’s core product in a quarter of a century. By July 2025, the technology had expanded to more than 200 countries in 40 languages, with 2 billion people served AI Overviews each month.\n\nWith the rapid rollout of AI Overviews, Google is racing to protect its traditional search business, which generates about $200bn (£147bn) a year, before upstart AI rivals can derail it. “We are leading at the frontier of AI and shipping at an incredible pace,” Pichai said last July. AI Overviews in particular were “performing well”, he added.\n\nBut overviews carry risks, experts say. They use generative AI to provide snapshots of information about a topic or question, adding conversational answers above the traditional search results in the blink of an eye. They can cite sources, but do not necessarily know when that source is incorrect.\n\nWithin weeks of the feature launching in the US, users encountered untruths across a range of subjects. One AI Overview said Andrew Jackson, the seventh US president, graduated from college in 2005. Elizabeth Reid, Google’s head of search, responded to criticism in a blog post. She conceded that “in a small number of cases”, AI Overviews had misinterpreted language on web pages and presented inaccurate information. “At the scale of the web, with billions of queries coming in every day, there are bound to be some oddities and errors,” she wrote.\n\nBut when those questions are about health, accuracy and context are essential and non-negotiable, experts say. Google is facing mounting scrutiny of its AI Overviews for medical queries after a Guardian investigation found people were being put at risk of harm by false and misleading health information.\n\nThe company says AI Overviews are “reliable”. But the Guardian found some medical summaries served up inaccurate health information and put people at risk of harm. In one case, which experts said was “really dangerous”, Google wrongly advised people with pancreatic cancer to avoid high-fat foods. Experts said this was the exact opposite of what should be recommended, and may increase the risk of patients dying from the disease.\n\nIn another “alarming” example, the company provided bogus information about crucial liver function tests, which could leave people who had serious liver disease wrongly thinking they were healthy. What AI Overviews said was normal could vary drastically from what was actually considered normal, experts said. The summaries could lead to seriously ill patients wrongly thinking they had a normal test result and not bothering to attend follow-up appointments.\n\nAI Overviews about women’s cancer tests also provided “completely wrong” information, which experts said could result in people dismissing genuine symptoms.\n\nGoogle initially sought to downplay the Guardian’s findings. From what its own clinicians could assess, the company said, the AI Overviews that alarmed experts linked to reputable sources and recommended seeking expert advice. “We invest significantly in the quality of AI Overviews, particularly for topics like health, and the vast majority provide accurate information,” a spokesperson said.\n\nWithin days, however, the company removed some of the AI Overviews for health queries flagged by the Guardian. “We do not comment on individual removals within search,” a spokesperson said. “In cases where AI Overviews miss some context, we work to make broad improvements, and we also take action under our policies where appropriate.”\n\nWhile experts welcomed the removal of some AI summaries for health queries, many remain worried. “Our bigger concern with all this is that it is nit-picking a single search result and Google can just shut off the AI Overviews for that but it’s not tackling the bigger issue of AI Overviews for health,” says Vanessa Hebditch, the director of communications and policy at the British Liver Trust, a liver health charity.\n\n“There are still too many examples out there of Google AI Overviews giving people inaccurate health information,” adds Sue Farrington, the chair of the Patient Information Forum, which promotes evidence-based health information to patients, the public and healthcare professionals.\n\nA new study has prompted more concerns. When researchers analysed the responses to more than 50,000 health-related searches in Germany to see which sources AI Overviews rely on most, one result stood out immediately. The single most cited domain was YouTube.\n\n“This matters because YouTube is not a medical publisher,” the researchers wrote. “It is a general-purpose video platform. Anyone can upload content there (eg, board-certified physicians, hospital channels, but also wellness influencers, life coaches and creators with no medical training at all).”\n\nIn medicine, it is not only where answers come from that matter, or their level of accuracy, but how they are presented to users, experts say. “With AI Overviews, users no longer encounter a range of sources that they can compare and critically assess,” says Hannah van Kolfschooten, a researcher in AI, health and law at the University of Basel. “Instead, they are presented with a single, confident, AI-generated answer that exhibits medical authority.\n\n“This means that the system does not merely reflect health information online, but actively restructures it. When that response is built on sources never designed to meet medical standards, such as YouTube videos, this creates a new form of unregulated medical authority online.”\n\nGoogle says AI Overviews are built to surface information backed up by top web results, and include links to web content that supports the information presented in the summary. People can use these links to dig deeper on a topic, the company told the Guardian.\n\nBut the single blocks of text in AI Overviews, combining health information from multiple sources, can cause confusion, says Nicole Gross, an associate professor in business and society at the National College of Ireland.\n\n“Once the AI summary appears, users are much less likely to research further, which means that they are deprived of the opportunity to critically evaluate and compare information, or even deploy their common sense when it comes to health-related issues.”\n\nExperts have raised other concerns with the Guardian. Even if and when AI Overviews do provide accurate facts about a specific medical topic, they may not distinguish between strong evidence from randomised trials and weaker evidence from observational studies, they say. Some also miss important caveats about that evidence, they add.\n\nHaving such claims listed next to one another in an AI Overview may also give the impression that some are better established than they really are. Answers can also change as AI Overviews evolve, even when the science hasn’t shifted. “That means that people are getting a different answer depending on when they search, and that’s not good enough,” says Athena Lamnisos, the chief executive of the Eve Appeal cancer charity.\n\nGoogle told the Guardian that links included in AI Overviews were dynamic and changed based on the information that was most relevant, helpful and timely for a given search. If AI Overviews misinterpreted web content or missed some context, the company would use these errors to improve its systems, and also take action when appropriate, it said.\n\nThe biggest worry is that bogus and dangerous medical information or advice in AI Overviews “ends up getting translated into the everyday practices, routines and life of a patient, even in adapted forms”, says Gross. “In healthcare, this can turn into a matter of life and death.”",

    "description": "The National Institutes of Health failed to protect brain scans that an international group of fringe researchers used to argue for the intellectual superiority of white people.",
    "fullText": "Genetic researchers were seeking children for an ambitious, federally funded project to track brain development — a study that they told families could yield invaluable discoveries about DNA’s impact on behavior and disease.\n\nThey also promised that the children’s sensitive data would be closely guarded in the decade-long study, which got underway in 2015. Promotional materials included a cartoon of a Black child saying it felt good knowing that “scientists are taking steps to keep my information safe.”\n\nThe scientists did not keep it safe.\n\nA group of fringe researchers thwarted safeguards at the National Institutes of Health and gained access to data from thousands of children. The researchers have used it to produce at least 16 papers purporting to find biological evidence for differences in intelligence between races, ranking ethnicities by I.Q. scores and suggesting Black people earn less because they are not very smart.\n\nMainstream geneticists have rejected their work as biased and unscientific. Yet by relying on genetic and other personal data from the prominent project, known as the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study, the researchers gave their theories an air of analytical rigor.\n\nMembers of the research group were ineligible to obtain data from the ABCD project. But one of them gained access through an American professor who was already being investigated by the N.I.H. over his handling of another child brain study.\n\nTheir papers have provided fodder for racist posts on social media and white nationalist message boards that have been viewed millions of times. Some of the papers are cited by A.I. bots like ChatGPT and Grok in response to queries about race and intelligence. On the social media platform X, Grok has referred users to the research more than two dozen times this month alone.\n\n“It’s evil,” said Dr. Terry L. Jernigan, national co-director of the ABCD Study and a neuropsychologist at the University of California, San Diego. “It’s not just that the science is faulty, but it’s being used to advance an unethical agenda.”\n\nThe misuse of the children’s data has validated longstanding concerns that hundreds of thousands of Americans’ genetic information held by the N.I.H. could fall into the wrong hands. The agency grants widespread access to stimulate new medical discoveries. But critics say the N.I.H. has failed to address the risks that the data, even with personally identifiable details removed, could be misused in unethical research, for commercial purposes or by foreign adversaries.\n\nAt least 63 times since 2007, data from some of the 28 human genomic repositories that the N.I.H. controls was improperly released to researchers, used for unapproved purposes or made vulnerable to theft, according to government records reviewed by The New York Times. In dozens of cases, the N.I.H. suspended researchers’ access and demanded that compromised data be destroyed, but the agency relies heavily on good-faith pledges of compliance.\n\nThe misuse of the data for so-called race science is not the only example of a security failure involving the ABCD Study.\n\nThe Times learned that in 2024, the same data was improperly obtained by an unidentified researcher in China. The data is not allowed to be shared with people in adversarial countries that could use it for blackmail, spy recruitment or military purposes. But the researcher evaded that prohibition by faking an affiliation with an American university, according to a former N.I.H. official and Dr. Jernigan, who said the agency informed her of the incident.\n\nThere has been no official public accounting of how the N.I.H. lost control of the children’s genetic information. The Chronicle of Higher Education in 2022 reported on the mishandling of data from another child brain study by the same American professor, Bryan J. Pesta, who also obtained the ABCD information. But details about the subsequent loss and abuse of the ABCD data have not been previously reported.\n\nToday, the data continues to be twisted to advance an ideological agenda.\n\nWhen Elon Musk invited X users last June to post politically incorrect “divisive facts” on the social network, one of Dr. Pesta’s collaborators — Jordan Lasker, who often writes about race and intelligence under the name Crémieux — replied with a criticism of affirmative action and said white people had bigger brains than Black people. The post, viewed 670,000 times, included a chart that purported to support his claim about brain size and cited the ABCD Study as its data source.\n\nThe conservative commentator Dinesh D’Souza said on X in 2023 that studies showed that Black people, “who are the rock-solid base of the Democratic Party, have the lowest IQ of any ethnic group.” As evidence, he reposted another chart by Mr. Lasker based on ABCD data about American 10-year-olds.\n\nScientists said the unauthorized use of the data underscored the need for stronger controls. Several families in the ABCD Study said in interviews that they were not told about the misuse of the information and never would have agreed to participate had they known it could be used to promote racial division.\n\nKevin Bird, a geneticist who complained to the N.I.H. about Dr. Pesta, said the data was made vulnerable because “our scientific institutions sort of assume good faith in people.”\n\n“There needs to be an acknowledgment that there are bad-faith researchers,” he said. “The rules and regulations need to catch up with that.”\n\nIn a statement, Lyric Jorgenson, associate director of science policy at the N.I.H., said the agency had taken steps to protect the ABCD Study. It has introduced a new online portal requiring users to complete training on responsible data use and to “pass a knowledge test prior to accessing the data.”\n\nIn response to the fraudulent access by a Chinese researcher, she said, the N.I.H. “made enhancements that will prevent this type of incident” from happening again.\n\n“N.I.H. has a longstanding commitment to make the results of N.I.H.-funded research available,” she said, noting that it has approved more than 92,000 access requests since 2007. “At the same time, N.I.H. takes the protection of all human data very seriously and has numerous safeguards in place.”\n\nBut the Government Accountability Office, a federal watchdog, reported last April that the N.I.H. did not have the resources to properly monitor all the downloads of genetic data and “may be missing violations that go unreported by researchers.”\n\nThe data that Dr. Pesta obtained came from two studies. In the nationwide ABCD Study, more than 11,000 children underwent regular M.R.I.s and clinical tests and had DNA samples taken from their blood or saliva. In a separate study, known as the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort, researchers at the University of Pennsylvania collected similar information from about 9,500 children.\n\nData from the projects has generated hundreds of papers on, among other things, the effects of social media on mental health, genetic links to addiction and the causes of sleep disorders.\n\nThe data is maintained by the N.I.H. To gain access, researchers must be tenure-track professors or senior scientists with authorization from their institutions. They also must detail what they plan to do with the information. The N.I.H. can reject proposals that fall outside its guidelines.\n\nThe agency discourages “stigmatizing research” that could promote “negative stereotypes” or cause “social detriment.” That is, in part, a nod to eugenics, a discredited field of research asserting that certain races, usually white Europeans, are genetically superior. Such ideas — and the pseudoscientific studies that support them — have been used to justify violence, including by the gunman who killed 10 Black people at a supermarket in Buffalo in 2022.\n\nIn April 2018, Dr. Pesta, who at the time was a management professor at Cleveland State University, submitted a proposal to the N.I.H. He said he was researching differences in brain size and cognitive abilities in men and women and wanted access to data from the Philadelphia study.\n\nEmails unearthed in a lawsuit that Dr. Pesta later brought against the university show that he had been working with a group of race researchers who coached him on how to apply for access. One of them was John G.R. Fuerst, a graduate student from North Carolina. In a March 2018 email, he told Dr. Pesta that focusing on gender differences would be “a sneaky way” to get the data to also study disparities in intelligence between races — a topic the group believed the N.I.H. would not greenlight.\n\nGot a confidential news tip? The New York Times would like to hear from readers who want to share messages and materials with our journalists.\n\nThough Dr. Pesta later submitted updates on further research he wanted to do, none explicitly described the group’s true intentions, according to court records. The legal filings also show that another group member, Emil O.W. Kirkegaard, a right-wing blogger in Denmark, suggested Dr. Pesta submit misleading proposals to gain access to additional data sets.\n\n“I reckon that if we mask the nature of the study with usual medical terms, one can ‘get away with’ a lot,” Mr. Kirkegaard wrote in an email. “Getting samples for analyses that one doesn’t publish (to preserve your reputation!) are still useful because they allow us to validate our beliefs privately.”\n\nIn an interview, Dr. Pesta denied misleading the N.I.H. and defended his work. “I am not a eugenicist,” he said.\n\nDr. Pesta’s collaborators had a history of scrounging for data to support their fringe theories and of using unreliable methodologies.\n\nIn a 2023 paper, Mr. Fuerst tried to rank the intelligence of children across ethnic groups. But the sample size for the vast majority of groups was far too small to draw meaningful conclusions.\n\nEthnic/National group N ▼ Black African 59 Asian Indian 53 Other Asian 52 Black Caribbean 51 Filipino 51 N. Africa & Mid. East 47 White & Asian Indian 44 Native American 39 Dominican 38 Korean & Japanese 33 Other Cuban 30 White & Pacific Islander 25 Vietnamese 24 Pacific Islander 17\n\nThe paper also invented a category, “USA Black,” excluding Black children with Hispanic or white heritage and an immigrant parent or grandparent. Furthermore, the race of participants was self-reported, a potentially inconsistent gauge of ancestry.\n\nEthnic/National group Definition Pacific Islander not Hispanic & not White & Pacific Islander USA Black not Hispanic & not White & Black & non-immigrant family Vietnamese not Hispanic & not White & Vietnamese\n\nMr. Kirkegaard has published dozens of pieces in Mankind Quarterly, a journal known for pushing race science. He has studied penis sizes by race and once looked for correlations between intelligence and first names, concluding that people with “non-western Muslim names” had lower I.Q.s. Authorities in Britain blocked Mr. Kirkegaard and his European colleagues from the country’s repository of genetic data because they were “not bona fide researchers,” The Guardian reported in 2024.\n\nAnother member of Dr. Pesta’s group was Mr. Lasker, whose frequent posts online mix data analysis with ideological barbs. He dismissed Supreme Court Justices Ketanji Brown Jackson and Sonia Sotomayor as “clearly incompetent” affirmative-action hires. (During the campaign for New York City mayor, Mr. Lasker also shared hacked data with The Times showing that Zohran Mamdani had identified as “Black or African American” on a college application.)\n\nTo finance their research, Dr. Pesta and Mr. Fuerst, the North Carolina graduate student, set up a foundation that received tens of thousands of dollars from the Pioneer Fund, which has a history of promoting eugenics-related research and race science. The fund’s president at the time once wrote approvingly about the idea of “phasing out” incompetent cultures by withholding foreign aid and banning migrants “of low genetic quality.”\n\nThe N.I.H. approved Dr. Pesta’s access to the Philadelphia data, which he and Mr. Fuerst analyzed on a computer in Dr. Pesta’s home, according to a transcript of his interview with university investigators. Dr. Pesta also told them that he had uploaded the data, without N.I.H. approval, to a foreign DNA lab to try to determine the skin color of children in the study.\n\nIn August 2019, Dr. Pesta, Mr. Fuerst, Mr. Kirkegaard and Mr. Lasker produced an analysis of the Philadelphia data. Their paper — which appeared in Psych, an online journal that Dr. Pesta edited — had nothing to do with gender differences and brain size, the topic for which Dr. Pesta had initially obtained the data. Instead, it declared that among people of mixed race, those with greater European ancestry were more intelligent, and that genes were probably the reason.\n\n“These results provide support for a hereditarian model,” they wrote.\n\nThe “hereditarian model” is the belief that intelligence is largely inherited and not a result of environmental factors. Race science broadens the theory across ancestral groups, asserting that people with a European background tend to perform better than African Americans on I.Q. tests because they are innately smarter, a view embraced by white supremacists.\n\nThis runs counter to the scientific consensus that any correlation between a complex trait like intelligence and genes, let alone social constructs like race, is not the same as causation.\n\nResearch has found that the environment in which people are raised can affect their cognitive abilities. In the United States, for example, any serious analysis must consider how Black people endured centuries of slavery and racial discrimination and how they today face disproportionately high poverty rates and a lack of quality education and health care.\n\nBut Dr. Pesta and his colleagues did not focus on that.\n\nThe authors of this paper admitted that the only socioeconomic information available in the Philadelphia data was the education levels of the children’s parents. Their study didn't consider factors like family income and employment that can affect racial I.Q. gaps.\n\n2.2. Parental Socioeconomic Status\n\nOnly paternal and maternal education were available to us as measures of SES. We coded parental education as the average of each, both z-scored first. When data were only available from one parent this value was used. The final score was then z-scored again.\n\nThe Philadelphia data did not include information on skin, eye or hair color of the children, so Dr. Pesta tried to predict those traits by uploading the genetic data to an unapproved, foreign DNA lab — contributing to sanctions against him from the N.I.H.\n\n2.5. Skin, Hair, and Eye Color\n\nThe data did not include measures of appearance, so we opted to impute these based on genotypes. We used the HIrisPlex-S web application to do this. This application was developed by the U.S. Department of Justice for use in forensic investigations. It imputes skin, hair, and eye color probabilities with a high degree of accuracy based on 41 SNPs (with overlapping variants; 6 for eye color, 22 for hair color, and 36 for skin color).\n\nDr. Pesta said in the interview that his research was scientifically sound and intended to improve the lives of Black people by determining the cause of I.Q. gaps. Because “I.Q. test scores strongly predict human well-being, and African Americans are on the short end of every well-being stick, I think it’s an important problem,” he said.\n\nMr. Fuerst, Mr. Kirkegaard and Mr. Lasker did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nTheir 2019 paper caused a commotion, with scientists criticizing it for discounting possible nongenetic explanations for the I.Q. gap. Alexander Gusev, a geneticist at Harvard University who has written about the “weaponization of genomic data,” said such an approach was “playacting at doing science.”\n\n“The goal seems to be just to dig through the data and find something that matches a hypothesis about some difference in African Americans versus whites, and then report it without seriously considering any possible caveats,” he said.\n\nDr. Hakon Hakonarson, a geneticist at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, was the co-leader of the study whose data Dr. Pesta used. When the N.I.H. informed him of Dr. Pesta’s paper, Dr. Hakonarson was outraged, saying its conclusions were not supported by the underlying data.\n\n“It’s most unfortunate that the data you submit in good faith gets abused in this sort of way,” Dr. Hakonarson said.\n\nIn September 2019, a month after the paper’s publication, the N.I.H. ordered Dr. Pesta to “immediately cease all work” with the Philadelphia data and began an investigation into his use of it. But about a year later, while the agency was still investigating, it approved Dr. Pesta’s request for the ABCD data. (The N.I.H. did not respond to a question about why.)\n\nIn 2021, before Dr. Pesta published anything based on the ABCD Study, the N.I.H. accused him of misconduct with the Philadelphia data and suspended his access to its repositories for three years. It was the most severe penalty the agency had ever issued. Cleveland State fired him the following year.\n\nDr. Pesta told university investigators that he had destroyed the data as instructed by the N.I.H., but he could not say for certain whether Mr. Fuerst had made a copy from the computer in Dr. Pesta’s home. He said he had distanced himself from Mr. Fuerst, who had “gone a little bit rogue.”\n\nMr. Fuerst and his colleagues have continued to cite the ABCD data. In 2024, for example, they published a book that compiled many of their papers and mentioned the ABCD Study about 200 times. Mr. Fuerst’s co-authors have included other people ineligible to access the data, such as a professor at a state university in Russia and a freelance researcher in China who has publicly acknowledged having “no formal credentials” in intelligence research.\n\nThe papers provide fuel for more forays into race science. Invoking their own previous analyses of the child brain studies, Dr. Pesta, Mr. Kirkegaard and Mr. Fuerst have produced new papers suggesting that Black people earn less than white people because they are less intelligent.\n\nOne of those papers, in turn, was cited in a Substack article last April asserting that Black people’s supposed lack of intelligence was the source of the racial income gap. The article was picked up by an online magazine with tens of thousands of viewers.\n\nAnother paper, coauthored by Mr. Kirkegaard, was limited by what he acknowledged were small sample sizes and a lack of nongenetic data. Those shortcomings did not stop him from trumpeting the findings online as proof that “genetic ancestry, not social race, explains observed gaps in social status.”\n\nThe scientists leading the ABCD Study decided not to tell participants that their data had been misused for race research.\n\nParents and their children — who are now adults nearing the end of the decade-long study — reacted with surprise and dismay when The Times told them what had happened. They said they deserved to learn about it from the study’s organizers.\n\nScientists said they chose not to inform the families because they believed doing so could cause more harm than good.\n\n“We have struggled with the decision,” said Angela Laird at Florida International University, who helps run the ABCD Study in South Florida.\n\nMany of her study participants are Black and Hispanic and “are really the targets of these racist studies,” Dr. Laird said. “I do believe that if we sat our families down and read them the studies, they would be upset — and in many cases, that is likely an understatement.”\n\nThe organizers of the Philadelphia study didn’t tell families, either. Dr. Hakonarson said that because children’s identities weren’t disclosed, informing parents “was not something that was felt to be needed.”\n\nWhile some scientists have pushed the N.I.H. to limit how sensitive genetic data can be used in research, there is little indication the Trump administration agrees — and there are signs it is moving in the opposite direction.\n\nAdam Candeub, the top lawyer at the Federal Communications Commission, wrote a law review article in 2024 criticizing the N.I.H.’s discouragement of stigmatizing research. He compared it to the persecution of Galileo.\n\n“A liberal society should support the search for truth,” Mr. Candeub wrote, “regardless of how uncomfortable and unsettling that truth turns out to be.”\n\nDr. Pesta has claimed that he faced such persecution. He sued Cleveland State for wrongful termination, saying he was a victim of cancel culture. A federal judge dismissed his lawsuit. He ruled that Dr. Pesta was fired “because of his own misconduct” with the restricted data, not the content of his research. A federal appeals court affirmed the decision in November.\n\nStill, Dr. Pesta and his fellow race researchers have reason for optimism. The pendulum of public policy, Dr. Pesta said, “is swinging in terms of acceptance of even asking the questions.”\n\nA few days after President Trump won the 2024 election, Mr. Kirkegaard happily noted on his website that incoming Vice President JD Vance followed compatriots like Mr. Lasker on social media. His post featured an image of a red “Make Science Great Again” hat.\n\nWithin weeks of Mr. Trump taking office, the N.I.H. made a little-noticed revision to the guidelines on access to a large genetic database. Its description of what constituted stigmatizing research no longer included any reference to skin color, ancestry and ethnicity.\n\nProduced by Tina Zhou and Rumsey Taylor.",

    "title": "What is Nipah virus? Symptoms to watch out for as India races to contain deadly outbreak",
    "description": "Nipah is a deadly virus with no vaccine or cure and considered a high-risk pathogen by the World Health Organization",
    "fullText": "India is moving quickly to contain a Nipah virus outbreak in the eastern state of West Bengal after five cases were confirmed, including doctors and nurses who were infected.\n\nNearly 100 people have been asked to quarantine at home, and infected patients were being treated in hospitals in and around the capital Kolkata, according to local media reports, with one patient in a critical condition.\n\nNipah is a deadly virus with no vaccine or cure and is considered a high-risk pathogen by the World Health Organization. Experts say human infections are rare and usually occur when the virus spills over from bats, often through contaminated fruit.\n\nHere is everything you need to know about this virus:\n\nNipah virus (NiV) infection most often begins with non-specific symptoms, making early detection difficult.\n\nAccording to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the incubation period is generally believed to range from four to 21 days, though longer delays between exposure and illness have been reported in rare cases during previous outbreaks.\n\nPatients typically develop a sudden flu-like illness marked by fever, headache, muscle pain and fatigue. In some cases, respiratory symptoms such as cough, shortness of breath or pneumonia also occur, although the timing and severity of these symptoms can vary widely.\n\nThe most serious and defining complication of Nipah infection is inflammation of the brain, known as encephalitis. Neurological symptoms, including confusion, altered consciousness, seizures or coma, usually appear several days to weeks after the initial onset of illness.\n\nSome patients may also develop meningitis.\n\nNipah virus is associated with a high death rate, with fatality levels reported between 40 and 75 per cent depending on the outbreak and the viral strain involved.\n\nSurvivors may experience long-term neurological effects, such as persistent seizures or changes in personality, according to the UK Health Security Agency’s update.\n\nIn rare cases, encephalitis has been reported to recur months or even years after the initial infection, either due to relapse or reactivation of the virus.\n\nNipah virus is a zoonotic pathogen that can be transmitted from animals to humans and from person to person, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nThe primary natural carriers are fruit bats (Pteropus species); humans can become infected through direct contact with infected bats or other animals, or by consuming food contaminated with bat saliva, urine or faeces.\n\nHuman‑to‑human transmission has also been reported, particularly through close contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person.\n\nNipah virus (NiV) was first identified in 1999 after an outbreak of encephalitis and respiratory illness among pig farmers and others who had close contact with infected pigs in Malaysia and Singapore. The episode led to the recognition of NiV as a serious zoonotic pathogen capable of crossing from animals to humans.\n\nSince then, repeated outbreaks have been recorded in South Asia. Parts of northeast India and several districts in Bangladesh have reported cases, with Bangladesh experiencing outbreaks almost every year since 2001.\n\nIn southern India, the state of Kerala reported its first Nipah outbreak in 2018, followed by sporadic cases in subsequent years.\n\nBeyond South Asia, infections have also been reported in the Philippines, with investigations suggesting they were caused by the Nipah virus or a closely related Nipah-like strain.\n\nScientific studies have identified fruit bats as the natural reservoir of the virus. Nipah virus has been isolated from bat urine in Malaysia, and antibodies have been detected in at least 23 bat species across Asia as well as in parts of Africa, including Ghana and Madagascar.\n\nDespite this wide animal reservoir, confirmed human outbreaks have so far been limited to South and Southeast Asia, typically occurring in rural or semi-rural settings where contact between humans, bats and domestic animals is more likely, WHO says.\n\n“Human-to-human transmission of Nipah virus has also been reported among family and caregivers of infected patients,” according to WHO.\n\nThere is currently no proven, targeted treatment for Nipah virus (NiV) infection and no approved vaccine to prevent it.\n\nCare for patients remains largely supportive, focusing on managing symptoms and complications as they arise.\n\nThe virus is listed by the WHO as a priority pathogen under its Research and Development Blueprint, which identifies epidemic threats that require urgent research.\n\nFollow these essential precautions to prevent Nipah Virus infection. Stay alert, stay informed, and follow advisories issued by local health authorities.#NipahVirus #PublicHealth #HealthForAll pic.twitter.com/itTuZA18ev\n\n— Ministry of Health (@MoHFW_INDIA) January 22, 2026\n\nWith no vaccine available, preventing Nipah virus infection relies on awareness and simple protective measures, global health agencies recommend. Public health advice focuses on reducing contact with the virus, whether from bats, animals, or infected people.\n\nPreventing bat-to-human transmission: Bats are the main carriers of Nipah. People should avoid consuming raw date palm sap or fruits that might have been contaminated by bats, WHO guidelines advise.\n\nBoiling fresh date palm juice and thoroughly washing or peeling fruits can reduce risk. Any fruit showing signs of bat bites should be discarded, the health agency advises.\n\nPreventing animal-to-human transmission: People handling sick animals, their tissues, or during slaughter should wear gloves and protective clothing. Contact with infected pigs should be minimised, and pig farms in areas with fruit bats should take steps to protect feed and enclosures from bats.\n\nSymptoms of Nipah Virus in humans can range from fever and headache to respiratory distress and neurological complications.\nEarly recognition of these symptoms and timely medical care are critical to reducing severity and preventing complications.#NipahVirus #HealthAwareness… pic.twitter.com/odW9baGomD\n\n— Ministry of Health (@MoHFW_INDIA) January 20, 2026\n\nPreventing human-to-human transmission: Avoid close, unprotected contact with people infected with Nipah. Regular hand washing after caring for or visiting sick individuals is essential to stop the virus from spreading.\n\nThe 2011 film Contagion, which depicts a fast-spreading global virus, was partly inspired by real-life pathogens like the Nipah virus, a bat-borne virus first identified in Malaysia in 1999, according to global health non-profit Path’s website.\n\nNipah causes severe respiratory illness and brain inflammation (encephalitis) and can spread from animals to humans, contaminated food, or infected people.\n\nIts high fatality rate, potential for outbreaks, and lack of a vaccine made it a model for how a zoonotic virus could trigger a pandemic, which filmmakers used to shape the realistic global crisis in Contagion, Path noted.",

    "description": "Two cases of Nipah virus, a rare, bat-borne pathogen, have been confirmed in an Indian hospital, prompting a nationwide alert as well as local quarantine and surveillance measures.",
    "fullText": "Two cases of Nipah virus, a rare, bat-borne pathogen, have been confirmed in an Indian hospital, prompting a nationwide alert as well as local quarantine and surveillance measures.\n\nThe cases, both in nurses working at the private Narayana Multispeciality Hospital in Barasat, West Bengal, 16 miles from the capital city Kolkata, have raised fears that the disease, which inspired the Hollywood film Contagion, could be spreading undetected.\n\n“Two nurses at a private hospital are infected with Nipah virus, and one of them is in critical condition,” Mr Narayan Swaroop Nigam, Principal Secretary, Health and Family Welfare Department, West Bengal, told The Telegraph.\n\nThe pair were on duty together between December 28 and 30. Between December 31 and January 2, they developed high fevers and respiratory distress and were admitted to the hospital’s intensive care unit on January 4 after their conditions worsened.\n\nInitial investigations suggest that both nurses, one of whom is in a coma, caught the virus while treating a patient with severe respiratory symptoms who later died before testing could be carried out, sources at the hospital said.\n\n“The most likely source of infection is a patient who had been admitted to the same hospital previously. That individual is being treated as the suspected index case, and investigations are ongoing,” said a senior health official involved in West Bengal’s Nipah surveillance efforts.\n\nThe outbreak prompted the health authorities to impose quarantine and emergency surveillance  and contact tracing measures in the area.\n\nSo far 180 people have been tested and 20 high risk contacts quarantined.\n\n“All of them are asymptomatic and tested negative. We will again test them before their 21-day quarantine ends,” Mr Nigam said.\n\nIndia’s Ministry of Health and Family Welfare issued a nationwide alert, urging states to strengthen surveillance, detection, and preventive measures to reduce risk and prevent any further spread.\n\nIndia has faced sporadic outbreaks of Nipah in recent years. The virus lives in bats and can be passed to humans through contaminated food or by contact with the bodily fluids of infected animals. It can also jump from bats to pigs, opening up another route for onward transmission to people, where it spreads from person to person through droplets and saliva.\n\nThe virus has a fatality rate of up to 75 per cent and causes a range of symptoms, beginning with a fever, vomiting and fatigue before developing into respiratory issues and swelling of the brain. Neurological issues like encephalitis can appear months or years after an initial infection\n\nIn response to the new cases, several Indian states have directed their health authorities to strengthen surveillance for Acute Encephalitis Syndrome (AES), a broad term for brain inflammation that can be caused by Nipah infection.\n\n“Persons admitted with AES, particularly those with travel or contact history linked to West Bengal, should be closely monitored and evaluated for possible Nipah virus infection,” reads one advisory issued by the authorities in Tamil Nadu, a state in southern India.\n\n“Government and private hospitals must be alerted about the Nipah virus situation and directed to promptly notify all AES cases,” it said.\n\nThe focus on examining cases of AES will help stop undiagnosed Nipah infections from flying under the radar, said Ali Althaf, a senior health official at Government Medical College, Thiruvananthapuram in Kerala, who has done extensive work on the Nipah virus.\n\n“There were over 100 cases of AES, a key indicator for diseases like Nipah, reported last year in Kerala, and if we subjected all of them to diagnostic testing, it’s plausible that we’d uncover a greater number of Nipah infections,” he told The Telegraph.\n\nMisidentifying Nipah infections as AES or as other respiratory illnesses has serious consequences, particularly for healthcare providers, he added.\n\n“We have repeatedly seen human-to-human transmission occurring within hospital settings,” he said. “When cases are not recognised early, healthcare workers are placed at the highest risk of exposure to this often fatal virus.”\n\nThe senior health official involved in West Bengal’s Nipah surveillance efforts denied the initial case had been misdiagnosed, but conceded the case had probably been missed.\n\n“I wouldn’t describe it as misdiagnosis. It’s more accurate to say a missed diagnosis,” he said.\n\nHe added: “We are expanding the criteria for testing so clinicians know when to suspect Nipah and when to order broader panels. This is not only about Nipah, several emerging and re-emerging infections, including respiratory diseases, can present with AES-like syndromes. The state is therefore expanding case definitions and lab testing protocols.”\n\nProtect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "description": "Traveling full-time was my dream, but it was bad for my mental and physical health in a lot of ways. Here's why I don't do it anymore.",
    "fullText": "I was living the dream — flying internationally nearly once a month for my work as a travel writer, crisscrossing the globe to cover incredible destinations.\n\nInvitations like cruising the Norwegian coastline and then jetting off to a buzzy restaurant opening in Las Vegas were too good to refuse, even if they were happening back-to-back.\n\nMeanwhile, the frequent long-haul flights, indulgent meals, packed itineraries, and erratic sleep schedules were quietly taking a toll on my health — I was gaining a substantial amount of weight and frequently feeling exhausted.\n\nI just told myself that less-than-stellar health was just the price of admission for this sort of career. After all, my job consisted of bucket-list-worthy experiences, like hiking in Peru and going on safari in Kenya!\n\nIt took me several years to admit to myself that I couldn't keep living this way.\n\nIn reality, the job of my dreams consisted of overnight flights where I'd get little to no rest, then hit the ground running as soon as I arrived at my destinations.\n\nAfter I'd fly back home from some trips, it would take me nearly a week to recover from jet lag. My stress levels were often cranked up, dealing with flight delays, deadlines, and navigation across different states and countries.\n\nWith grueling daily schedules on the road, I rarely had time to answer emails. I'd come home to a full inbox and even fuller calendar.\n\nThe regular exposure to dry air on planes wasn't helping my immune system, and neither was all the stress. I felt like I was constantly getting sick with colds, flus, or whatever was going around.\n\nMeanwhile, my diet wasn't balanced or nutritious. It largely consisted of indulgent meals on press trips, where I felt pressure to try everything so I could write about it.\n\nSaying no felt awkward, even when I knew I'd feel better if I could set firmer boundaries.\n\nOn top of all that, I wasn't exercising. After all, press trips run on tight schedules. I'd return to the hotel late, wake up early, sit in a van for hours between stops, and finish the day with a multicourse dinner.\n\nSome fellow writers managed to fit in workouts, but I didn't. It wasn't a priority for me then.\n\nAll the travel felt isolating at times, too. I was spending most of my days with publicists, fellow writers, and guides. They were all lovely people, but not permanent fixtures in my life.\n\nMy closest friends lived far away, and I kept postponing visits because I was always either traveling or catching up from being away.\n\nMeanwhile, my parents were getting older and needed more support.\n\nAfter nearly a decade of jet-setting, by 2019, it had become undeniable that my mother's memory problems went beyond normal aging. Finally, I felt compelled to take my health seriously.\n\nThere wasn't anything I could do to stop my mom's Alzheimer's from progressing, but I threw myself into researching the disease so I could know more about what the future held for her and, eventually, me.\n\nI worried whether a similar diagnosis — one millions of Americans share — could be in the cards for me someday.\n\nThough it's not preventable, some studies and members of the medical community suggest that certain lifestyle changes, like being physically active and managing blood sugar and blood pressure levels, may lower one's risk of developing some forms of the disease or delay its symptoms.\n\nEven if I couldn't prevent a future diagnosis, I knew finally taking care of my body and mind would be good for me. All that nonstop travel had been quietly wrecking my health, and the way I'd been living and working wasn't sustainable.\n\nIt's been over five years since I significantly cut back on travel.\n\nI exercise almost every day and try to regularly follow a balanced diet. I've since lost over 50 pounds and sleep much better.\n\nWhen I do go on trips, I do so with more intention and a lot of focus on the Northeast, close to home.\n\nI probably take an overnight or weekend trip within driving distance about every six weeks. I still fly for work once or twice a year, but I'm no longer constantly on the road, and my body feels the difference.\n\nWhen I go on bigger trips, I actually feel like I have more opportunities than I did before. Recently, I even hiked the Grand Canyon rim-to-rim, which I would never have attempted back when I was out of shape and constantly feeling drained.\n\nGiving up on my dream job wasn't easy, but I want to feel good and stay in great shape for as long as I can — even if that means finding peace at home instead of abroad.",

    "description": "Tory leader says delay will harm children’s mental health after No 10 said it would consult on policy by...",
    "fullText": "Tory leader says delay will harm children’s mental health after No 10 said it would consult on policy by summer\n\nAs a parent – and a Conservative – I know that banning social media for under-16s is the right thing to do\n\nKemi Badenoch has called on Keir Starmer to “just get on” with a ban on social media for under-16s, saying delay is a dereliction of duty that is harming children’s mental health.\n\nAfter the government said it would consult on a social media ban for under-16s by the summer, the Conservative party leader urged the prime minister to act more quickly, “however difficult to implement” it would be.\n\nBadenoch’s comments will add to pressure on the government as peers prepare to vote on an amendment to the children’s wellbeing and schools bill on Wednesday that would enact a ban within a year of it passing. The government is understood to want to wait to assess the evidence from Australia’s ban, which came into force in December.\n\nWriting in the Guardian, Badenoch said the UK was producing a generation of children who struggled to concentrate and had higher levels of anxiety because of exposure to social media.\n\nBadenoch said limits on alcohol, the age of consent and safeguarding in schools were there to protect children while their brains were developing, but the government had “suspended that logic entirely” when it came to social media. “We will not be bought off with vague promises of a ‘national conversation’ about whether we should get children off these adult platforms,” she said.\n\n“The prime minister must set out how he will act and by when. The crossbench peer Baroness Kidron, who supports Conservative peer Lord Nash’s amendment in the House of Lords, is right to say Starmer’s approach ‘is not leading; it is not governing’. He is ‘doing nothing – slowly’, which is ‘the very epitome of party before country’.\n\n Let’s just get on with it.”\n\nShe added: “Putting our children’s mental health first is the right thing to do. How much longer will we have to wait until the government agrees?”\n\nThe Conservatives made no moves towards banning social media during their time in government, though the Online Safety Act placed more obligations on internet and social media providers to protect children from harmful content.\n\nHowever, Badenoch said the consensus had shifted, with campaigners, clinicians, parents and experts now aligned against allowing under-16s access to social media. She also argued some internet restrictions for adults could be lifted if children were more protected from social media.\n\n“By restricting social media use for children, we aren’t just protecting children. We can also give more freedoms to adults online,” she said. “We will no longer need to contort digital spaces to be universally ‘child-friendly’, or impose blanket restrictions on speech and content because children might see it. If we stop treating children like adults, we can stop treating adults like children, too.”\n\nShe said her party believed in freedom but that the ability to make good choices was not yet fully formed in children, who did not have the necessary impulse control, emotional regulation and ability to assess risks.\n\nOn Sunday, the Guardian revealed that more than 60 Labour MPs have written to Starmer urging him to back a social media ban for under-16s, including select committee chairs, former frontbenchers and MPs from the right and left of the party.\n\nIn the letter, which was organised by Fred Thomas, the Labour MP for Plymouth Moor View, the MPs say: “Across our constituencies, we hear the same message: children are anxious, unhappy, and unable to focus on learning. They are not building the social skills needed to thrive, nor having the experiences that will prepare them for adulthood.”\n\nOn Wednesday another letter from campaigners urged parliament to back a ban, with signatories including the actors Hugh Grant and Sophie Winkleman and Esther Ghey, the mother of Brianna Ghey, who was murdered by two teenagers in Warrington, Cheshire, in 2023. It said national polling by the charity Parentkind had found 93% of parents thought social media was harmful to children and young people.\n\nIt said: “No other amendment to the bill on this topic has the same cross-party support or would deliver promptly the change needed to get children off social media.”",

    "description": "The Occupational Safety and Health Administration lists bleach as a Category 1 chemical with the highest human health risk of the five categories.",
    "fullText": "Soap scum is a nuisance that impacts homeowners everywhere. In a recent video, TikToker Eco OG (@eco_og) presented a two-ingredient hack to clean soap scum.\n\nThe video suggests sprinkling baking soda in the tub before spritzing around with a coating of hydrogen peroxide. Then, Eco OG allows the mixture to sit for 15 to 20 seconds before wiping it off with a rag.\n\n\"It's so easy and works every time,\" the creator says.\n\nThis simple hack is an inexpensive way to get a cleaner tub or shower — while also reducing the use of toxic chemicals in the household. Studies have indicated that the average American family spends $40 to $50 monthly on household cleaning supplies. Homeowners can decrease this expenditure by already using ingredients they have in their households, like baking soda and hydrogen peroxide.\n\nEco OG explained in the video's comments section that hydrogen peroxide is an organic compound that biodegrades completely into oxygen and water. Therefore, it is a preferable alternative to more toxic cleaning products like bleach, which can cause skin and respiratory irritation to plants and animals.\n\nThe Occupational Safety and Health Administration lists bleach as a Category 1 chemical with the highest human health risk of the five categories. This means it's looped in with other chemicals that cause irreversible skin damage and blindness as well as substances known to cause cancer, sterility, and genetic alteration ... all just to clean out your shower.\n\nTherefore, improper handling of bleach can cause numerous health threats and exacerbate conditions like asthma, while hydrogen peroxide is a much safer (and just as effective) alternative.\n\nIn addition, chlorine, one of the components of bleach, can react with minerals and form toxic compounds like dioxin and persistent organic pollutants. These compounds remain in soil and water for long periods, harming aquatic and wildlife.\n\nTikTok users praised Eco OG's hack.\n\nOne user wrote, \"​​Man I did try this and my shower turned so white. Love it thank you so much.\"\n\nOther users suggested alternative cleaning mixtures to try.\n\nOne wrote, \"Another option that works really well for me is mixing baking soda, cleaning white vinegar, dawn dish soap, and a tad bit of alcohol and lemon juice!\"\n\nJoin our free newsletter for easy tips to save more, waste less, and help yourself while helping the planet.",

    "title": "We Asked a Cardiologist How Long You Need to Take Fish Oil to Improve Heart Health—The Answer Might Surprise You",
    "description": "For most people, this diet tweak is a more powerful gamechanger for heart health.",
    "fullText": "Reviewed by Dietitian Maria Laura Haddad-Garcia\n\nPrescription fish oil may lower high triglycerides and reduce heart risks in 4 to 12 weeks.\n\nOver-the-counter fish oil supplements vary in quality and may not offer the same benefits.\n\nEating fatty fish twice a week is a proven way to support heart health without supplements.\n\nFish oil is a well-known source of omega-3 fatty acids, nutrients found in high concentrations in the eyes and brain. Unlike other nutrients, your body can’t make omega-3s on its own, so it’s important to get them through food—like fish—or supplements.\n\nOften, fish oil is touted for its heart-health benefits, but taking a supplement isn’t right for everyone—and improvements aren't always immediate. We spoke with a cardiologist to break down the science, expectations and timeline for fish oil’s impact on heart health.\n\nFish oil contains two key omega-3 fatty acids: eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), in varying amounts, which are often marketed as heart-healthy. You may have seen them marketed as a way to promote heart health. But before reaching for a supplement, consider this: the research is not promising for most people.\n\n\"There have been many studies conducted on fish oils over the years. Although some have shown benefit in select populations, when used for prevention in otherwise healthy patients, multiple, well-conducted, very large trials have not shown a benefit,\" says Eugenia Gianos, M.D., FACC, chair of the American College of Cardiology's Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease Council and director of cardiovascular prevention at Northwell Health.\n\nTaking fish oil without a medical reason may even be harmful. Some studies have linked fish oil supplements with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation, a type of irregular heart rhythm, adds Gianos. They should be used in patients where the benefits are likely to be greater,” she says—primarily those with very high triglycerides. Triglycerides are a type of fat in the blood, and elevated levels can increase the risk of plaque buildup in the arteries, potentially leading to a heart attack or stroke.\n\nIn addition, it's also important to consider the type of fish oil that physicians recommend for high triglycerides: prescription fish oil. That’s because over-the-counter supplements are not FDA-approved for managing high triglycerides, and their quality and dosage can vary widely. Many also contain impurities.\n\nAnother key difference is dosage. Prescription fish oil delivers a much higher dose of omega-3s than over-the-counter supplements. To reach a similar amount using nonprescription fish oil, you’d need to take multiple capsules, which can increase the likelihood of gastrointestinal side effects, including nausea and the unpleasant “fish burps” many people experience.\n\nPrescription versions, such as icosapent ethyl (Vascepa), deliver a much higher dose of EPA and have been shown to reduce inflammation, stabilize arterial plaque and lower the risk of heart attack and stroke, notes Gianos.\n\nBack to the question at hand, though: When will you notice a benefit? If your healthcare provider recommends taking a prescription fish oil medication to lower your triglycerides, you should see a benefit in about 4 to 12 weeks, adds Gianos.\n\nAlthough you can easily purchase fish oil supplements at the store or online, first make sure your healthcare provider recommends you take one. For lowering triglycerides, the typical dose is 2 grams twice daily, taken with meals.\"Fish oils are generally very safe. They are unlikely to interact with other medications and are well tolerated,\" says Gianos.\n\nFor most people, though, the best way to get omega-3s for heart-health benefits is through food.  Fatty fish such as salmon, sardines, mackerel, anchovies, bluefin tuna, mussels and oysters are all excellent sources. \"This has been a guideline recommendation for decades due to research showing benefits for the prevention of heart disease and can be a healthy way to get important protective nutrients,\" she explains.\n\nThe American Heart Association recommends eating fish twice a week—a target that supports heart health without the need for supplements in most cases.\n\nFish oil supplements are often thought to be great for your heart, but evidence doesn’t support their use for everyone. Plus, in some cases, it can lead to harm or unpleasant side effects. If you’re managing high triglycerides, prescription fish oil may offer measurable benefits within a few weeks. But for most people, eating fish regularly is a stronger, more established strategy for supporting heart health.",

    "fullText": "State provision for psychological health services is lamentable. Until things improve, let’s not judge those who turn to an app for help\n\nIt’s a sunny afternoon in a Roman park and a peculiar, new-to-this-era kind of coming out is happening between me and my friend Clarissa. She has just asked me if I, like her and all of her other friends, use an AI therapist and I say yes.\n\nOur mutual confession feels, at first, quite confusing. As a society, we still don’t know how confidential, or shareable, our AI therapist usage should be. It falls in a limbo between the intimacy of real psychotherapy and the material triviality of sharing skincare advice. That’s because, as much as our talk with a chatbot can be as private as one with a human, we’re still aware that its response is a digital product.\n\nYet it surprised me to hear that Clarissa’s therapist has a name: Sol. I wanted mine to be nameless: perhaps, not giving it a name is consistent with the main psychoanalytical rule – that is, to keep personal disclosure to a minimum, to protect the healing space of the so-called setting.\n\nHowever, it feels very natural to Clarissa for her therapist to have a name, and she adds that all her other friends’ AI therapists have one. “So do all your other friends have AI therapists,” I ask, to which she says: “All of them do.” This startles me even more, as none of my friends in London has one.\n\nI phoned another friend, a psychotherapist in my Sicilian home town of Catania, who a few years ago retired from a role at a provincial health authority and is now working in a private capacity. He confirmed that the use of AI therapists in Italy is widespread and on the rise. He was surprised to hear that I knew of far fewer people in the UK who had opted for this route. I wondered what the contributing factors might be – and I came to the conclusion that they are a mix of culture and economic pressures.\n\nAccording to a survey conducted in 2025 by one of the leading European mental health platforms, 81% of Italians considered mental health issues a form of weakness, yet 57% cited cost as the main reason for not accessing help. In my country, sadly, the words “mental illness” (malattia mentale) still carry the eerie echo of brutal state-run hospitals. The revolutionary 1978 Basaglia law (that still forms the basis of Italian mental health legislation) closed these institutions down, which led to their gradual replacement with community-based services. But the downside of their closure is a system with insufficient resources and a lack of public awareness, perpetuating stigma and difficulties in accessing care. While workplaces should play a crucial part in this destigmatisation by offering proper care, according to the 2025 survey, 42% of workers said that their employer did not offer any mental health provision.\n\nWhile almost half of European countries have currently implemented work-related mental health prevention and promotion programmes, Italy has not. In fact, within the EU, Italy invests the least in mental health. This is alarming, as Italy ranks above the European average when it comes to the prevalence of mental disorders. In fact, it is estimated that 5 million Italians are in need of mental health support but are not able to afford it.\n\nWhen I ask my therapist friend about his experience in the Italian public health system, he told me he used to be the only therapist for a population of more than 200,000 people covering four districts in Sicily. That is why he started offering group therapy sessions. For most of his professional career, he had more than 150 clients at any given time, of which only eight were part of a group. Despite an announcement last year of government plans to expand the range of psychological services, it is unclear how far this will go in benefiting the wider population.\n\n“It feels liberating to be able to tell everything to my AI therapist, knowing it is both a free and a completely unjudging space,” says my friend Giuseppe, from Calabria, in southern Italy. “When I had real therapists, and I tried three, I always entered their office with a crippling anxiety that was the result of two factors combined: the awareness that I was paying more than I could afford and the self-consciousness of doing something that, in my small town, is still perceived as only being for severe cases. Now, I don’t feel the pressure of having to get the maximum out of a session, as it’s free, and I also don’t feel judged, because a therapy app cannot really judge!”\n\nThe more I talk to my friends, the more I’m convinced AI therapy could be a revolution in places such as Italy, where we still lack meaningful strategies to tackle the stigma around mental health conditions. When I ask Giuseppe if his queerness was also a factor in his difficulties in trusting a therapist in his home town, he agrees: “I am not out with my family, and although a therapist would be bound to professional secrecy, I still had trouble trusting someone who lives in a place where homosexuality, just like mental health discussions, is not always met with understanding.”\n\nGiuseppe’s example was comforting: thanks to his AI therapist, he was able to talk about things he had never disclosed to anyone, and get more empathetic responses than any of the real therapists he had tried offered. “I’m 43 and I still live with my parents,” he says, “because my income does not allow otherwise. My AI therapist is always available to me, always calm and supporting, and has helped me immensely in examining my life and all the steps I need to take to change my life for the better.”\n\nOf course, older generations don’t always understand. In a country such as Italy – so tied to traditions – change is not always welcome. And some ethical concerns may be justified: measuring how healthy “relationships” between vulnerable people and their AI therapists really are is not easy.\n\nStill, in a digital age where our feelings are so often commodified for profit, free, clever, never-ending support can be tantalising. And until mental health support becomes more affordable, it may be the best option on the table for many people.\n\nViola di Grado is an Italian author\n\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

    "fullText": "Trial involving 4,000 children will explore impact on mental health, sleep and time spent with friends and family\n\nA pioneering investigation into the impact of restricting social media access for children in the UK has been announced as politicians around the world consider action on the issue.\n\nIn December, Australia became the first country to ban under-16s from social media, with governments in other countries, including the, coming under pressure to do the same.\n\nHowever, while experts say there is evidence that aspects of social media are harmful to most children, there has been no large-scale experimental study exploring the effect of limiting time spent on social media in healthy children as a population.\n\n“This study is a world first to try to look at that question,” said Prof Amy Orben, of the University of Cambridge, who is co-lead of the study.\n\nOrben and colleagues plan to study about 4,000 children across 30 secondary schools in Bradford, West Yorkshire, focusing on students in years 8, 9 and 10.\n\nAll participants would be asked to complete an initial questionnaire on areas including their mental health, sleep and friendships, and to download the research app on their main device.\n\nEach year group in each school would be randomly assigned to one of two conditions: the app would simply record the pupils’ social media use, or it would curtail their social media use by limiting access to the apps for TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, X, LinkedIn, Reddit, YouTube and Snapchat to one hour a day, as well as imposing a curfew from 9pm to 7am.\n\nCrucially, the team said, all pupils within a particular year group in a school would experience the same intervention.\n\n“We know that if we take away social media for one adolescent, that might have a very different impact than if we take it away for their whole friendship group for a certain period of time,” Orben said.\n\nAccess to messaging apps including WhatsApp would not be restricted, the team said, as they were important for family communication.\n\nAfter six weeks students would complete another questionnaire. After an initial pilot period beginning in April, the team planned to start the study itself in October, with the first results expected in summer 2027.\n\nMembers of the House of Lords are preparing to vote on an amendment brought by John Nash to the children’s wellbeing and schools bill which would introduce an outright ban on children using social media.\n\nThe amendment has the support of some Labour peers, and if it passes in the Lords it will then be debated in the Commons, where 61 Labour MPs recently wrote a letter to the prime minister urging him to bring in a ban.\n\nLiz Kendall, the technology secretary, reassured MPs on Tuesday that the government’s consultation on the issue would only take a few months and that it would have a firm position by the summer.\n\nHowever, Nash insisted he would press ahead with his attempt to legislate immediately for a ban, saying on Tuesday: “The time for delay and procrastination is over. Without swift action to raise the age limit for social media to 16, we are at risk of a societal catastrophe.\n\n“That is why I am urging all fellow peers to vote for my amendment, which has the backing of peers from every major party, to end the disastrous harm being done to our young people by social media and to give them their childhood back.”\n\nWhile the researchers have noted that the study, called the IRL trial, has limitations – for example students may use devices that belong to other people or may choose not to participate – they said they hoped the results would shed light on the effect of restricting teens’ social media use.\n\n“The participants’ levels of anxiety is our key outcome, and we’re also interested in depression,” said Dr Dan Lewer, who leads the Bradford Centre for Health Data Science and is co-lead of the study. The researchers would also explore the impact by looking at which apps were used and when, as well as participants’ sleep patterns, experiences of bullying, time spent with friends and family, and how they compared themselves to other young people, he said.\n\nThe trial was independent from the UK government’s announcement of a consultation on whether to ban under-16s from social media, Orben said, adding that the results may be valuable for other countries debating the issue.\n\n“The decision that policymakers need to make is up to them,” she said. “We’re really just delivering the best quality evidence we can in the timeframes that are available.”",

    "fullText": "Your heart rate variability (HRV) is a powerful—if complex—metric of your overall health. Your Apple Watch automatically measures HRV, including while sleeping. We’ll try to give an overview here, but you could really write a whole book on what HRV means.\n\nA healthy heart is not a metronome: as your heart beats, the timing between each beat shifts slightly. For example, one heart beat may come 900 millseconds after another, and then the next one 950 millseconds after that. That’s healthy and good.\n\nYour HRV measures the variation in time between these heart beats. The unit of HRV is millseconds, and a normal HRV is 18-76ms.\n\nWhile HRV is derived from heart rate, it’s actually a broader window into your overall health.\n\nThe main influence on HRV is your autonomic nervous system (ANS). Since your ANS is connected to your liver, kidney, stomach, brain, and more, HRV is actually a really powerful metric of many different organ systems in your body. We’ll cover the autonomic nervous system more below, including the how HRV sometimes reflects medical conditions like anxiety, depression, dysautonomia, digestive tract problems, and more.\n\nAnything between 18 to 76 ms is a normal heart rate variability. Within 18-76ms, higher HRVs are usually better.\n\nDepending on age and sex, below 18 ms is a low HRV. This is around the bottom 10%. An HRV above 76 ms would put you in the 90th percentile of Apple Watch users.\n\nThe Apple Watch measures the time of each heart beat using its optical heart rate sensor. Apple Watch calculates HRV using SDNN: the standard deviation between normal-to-normal heart beat intevals.\n\nSDNN is defined mathematically as:\n\nSDNN = sqrt(Σ(NN_i - mean(NN))² / (N - 1))\n\nHere’s an example. Let’s say your heart is beating around 60bpm. The spacing between heart beats isn’t going to be exactly 1 second—it will vary a little bit, beat to beat. Let’s say the first heart beat comes, then a second one 1040 ms later, then a third heart beat 960 ms later, then a final heart beat exactly 1000ms later. Your NN intervals are then 1040ms, 960ms, and 1000ms.\n\nYour average N-N (normal to normal) interval is 1000ms. The standard deviation is 32.6 ms. That means your HRV\nis 32.6 ms, using the SDNN method. Other wearables like Whoop use different formulas for HRV, such as RMSSD, which we’ll explain now.\n\nThere are several formulas to calculate HRV. The two most common are SDNN (used by Apple Watch) and RMSSD:\n\nHRV is influenced by your autonomic nervous system, which has two branches: the sympathetic nervous system (your “fight or flight” response) and the parasympathetic nervous system (your “rest and digest” response, which is controlled by the vagus nerve). When the sympathetic nervous system dominates, HRV is lower. When the parasympathetic nervous system dominates, HRV is higher.\n\nA low or high HRV can have many meanings and causes, including mental health, dysautonomia, diabetes, or simply stress. Let’s go\nthrough each potential cause.\n\nA common cause of temporary low HRV on your Apple Watch is stress or intense fitness training. However, medical conditions\ncan also cause low HRVs (or high HRVs). The most common conditions that affect HRV are dysautonomia, anxiety, depression, nerve damage, abnormal heart rhythms, and some gut health conditions.\n\nOne of the hallmarks of dysautonomia is imbalance between the sympathetic nervous system (often overactive) and the parasympathetic nervous system (often withdrawn). People with dysautonomia, POTS, and Long Covid often haver low HRV. While HRV itself is not used in diagnosis of POTS, the pattern of heart rate and blood pressure when going from laying to standing is. You can book an appointment with an Empirical Health doctor\nto get POTS testing and treatment.\n\nLow HRV can sometimes be a sign of depression or anxiety. Improving HRV through practices like mindfulness, physical activity, stress management, and medication can support better emotional regulation and mental health.\n\nNerve damage (for example, from diabetes) can cause low HRV. Nerve damage affects HRV by disrupting the balance and communication between the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of the autonomic nervous system. When nerves responsible for these regulatory pathways are damaged, the body’s ability to adjust heart rate in response to stressors and environmental changes becomes impaired. This leads to a decrease in HRV.\n\nFinally, very low or high HRV can also be caused by an electrical problem in the heart (for example, atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, or supraventricular tachycardia). In these cases, an ECG can give more diagnostic information on exactly what is happening in the heart’s electrical system.\n\nThe image above shows two common abnormal heart rhythms, atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter, on an ECG. Atrial fibrillation is highly irregular, leading to high HRV. Atrial flutter is very regular, leading to no or low HRV. Either of these rhythms require attention from a medical professional.\n\nThe Apple Watch Series 4 and above include an FDA-cleared ECG sensor that can help distinguish whether low or high HRV is caused by an abnormal heart rhythm. The current Apple Watch Series 11 and Ultra 9 (released in 2025) both include the ECG sensor, but not\nthe Apple Watch SE3.\n\nSince the vagus nerve is connected with your stomach, intenstines, liver, and so on, low HRV can sometimes be correlated with problems in the digestive tract.\n\nBecause HRV correlates with so much in the body, it’s a powerful metric but doesn’t give specific diagnostic information on exactly what’s wrong. If you have concerns or questions about HRV, it’s best to talk with a doctor about your specific medical situation. You can book an appointment through the Empirical Health app.\n\nWhat is HRV and what does it have to do with health?\n\nRaquel Rodriguez Martinez, MD, MPP\n\nYour guide to Apple Watch's heart rate monitor",

    "fullText": "CAIRO (AP) — A dividing line, at times invisible, can mean life or death for Palestinians in Gaza.\n\nThose sheltering near the territory's “yellow line” that the Israeli military withdrew to as part of the October ceasefire say they live in fear as Israeli soldiers direct near-daily fire at anyone who crosses or even lingers near it.\n\nOf the 447 Palestinians killed between the ceasefire taking effect and Tuesday, at least 77 were killed by Israeli gunfire near the line, including 62 who crossed it, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. Among them were teenagers and young children, The Associated Press found.\n\nAnd although the military has placed some yellow barrels and concrete barriers delineating the limits of the Palestinian zone, the line is still unmarked in certain places and in others was laid nearly half a kilometer (0.3 miles) deeper than what was agreed to in the ceasefire deal, expanding the part of Gaza that Israel controls, according to Palestinians and mapping experts.\n\n“We stay away from the barrels. No one dares to get close” said Gaza City resident Ahmed Abu Jahal, noting that the markers are less than 100 meters (110 yards) from his house — instead of the roughly 500 meters (546 yards) outlined in a map put out by the Israeli military.\n\nAs of Tuesday, the military had acknowledged killing 57 people around the yellow line, saying most were militants. It said its troops are complying with the rules of engagement in order to counter militant groups, and are informing Palestinians of the line’s location and marking it on the ground to “reduce friction and prevent misunderstandings.”\n\nUnder the ceasefire, Israel withdrew its troops to a buffer zone that is up to 7 kilometers (4 miles) deep and includes most of Gaza's arable land, its elevated points and all of its border crossings. That hems more than 2 million Palestinians into a strip along the coastline and central Gaza.\n\nPeople of all ages, some already dead, have been showing up almost daily at the emergency room of Gaza City's Al-Ahli hospital with bullet wounds from straying near the line, said hospital director Fadel Naeem.\n\nAmid the vast destruction in Gaza, the demarcation line often isn't easy to detect, Naeem said. He recounted picking his way through undamaged paths during a recent visit to the southern city of Khan Younis. He didn't notice he was almost across the line until locals shouted at him to turn back, he said.\n\nThe Israeli military said most of the people it has killed crossing the line posed a threat to its troops. According to a military official who spoke on the condition of anonymity in line with military rules, troops issue audible warnings and then fire warning shots whenever someone crosses the line. Many civilians retreat when warning shots are fired, though some have been killed, the official acknowledged.\n\nKilled while playing near the line\n\nZaher Shamia, 17, lived with his grandfather in a tent 300 meters (330 yards) from the line in northern Gaza’s Jabaliya refugee camp. On Dec. 10, he was playing with his cousin and some friends near the line, according to video he took before his death.\n\nSuddenly, shots rang out and the video stopped. Soldiers approaching the line with an armored bulldozer had fired on the teens, hitting Zaher, said a witness.\n\nA neighbor eventually found Zaher’s body, which had been crushed by the bulldozer, said Zaher's grandfather, Kamal al-Beih: “We only recognized him from his head.\"\n\nTwo doctors, Mohamed Abu Selmiya and Rami Mhanna, confirmed that the teen had been killed by gunshots and then run over by a bulldozer. The military official said he was aware that Shamia was a civilian and that the military was looking into it.\n\nMaram Atta said that on Dec. 7, her 3-year-old daughter, Ahed al-Bayouk, was playing with siblings outside of their tent, which was near the yellow line along Gaza's southern coast. Atta was preparing lentils when she heard aircraft overhead, then shots.\n\nA stray projectile whizzed close to her and struck Ahed, who was dead before they reached the clinic.\n\n“I lost my daughter to what they keep calling a ‘ceasefire’” said Atta, crying. “What ceasefire are they talking about?”\n\nA military official denied the killing.\n\nThe line's exact location is ambiguous, differing on maps put out by the Israeli military and the White House.\n\nNeither matches the line troops appear to be marking on the ground, according to Palestinians and geolocation specialists.\n\nChris Osiek, an open source intelligence analyst and consultant, has geolocated a number of yellow blocks based on social media videos. He found at least four urban areas where troops set the blocks several hundred meters deeper into Gaza than the military map-specified yellow line.\n\n“This is basically what you get when you simply let Trump make an image and post it on Truth Social and let the IDF make their own,” he said, using the acronym for the military. “If it’s not a proper system, with coordinates that make it easy for people to navigate where it is, then you leave the ambiguity free for the IDF to interpret the yellow line how they basically want.”\n\nThe military official dismissed such criticism, saying any deviations from the map amount to just a few meters. But to Palestinians hemmed in by widespread destruction and displacement, every few meters lost is another house that can't be sheltered in — another they doubt will ever be returned.\n\n‘The line is getting very close’\n\nUnder the ceasefire, Israeli forces are only supposed to remain at the yellow line until a fuller withdrawal, though the agreement doesn't give a timeline for that. With the next steps in the deal lagging and troops digging into positions on the Israeli side, though, Palestinians wonder if they are witnessing a permanent land takeover.\n\nIn December, Israel’s defense minister described the yellow line as “a new border line — serving as a forward defensive line for our communities and a line of operational activity.”\n\nThe military has continued leveling buildings inside the Israeli-held zone, turning already damaged neighborhoods to moonscapes. Almost all of the city of Rafah, on Gaza's border with Egypt, has been razed over the past year. The army says this is necessary to destroy tunnels and prepare the area for reconstruction.\n\nIn some places, demolitions since the ceasefire have encroached beyond the official yellow line. Since November, troops have leveled a swath of Gaza City’s Tuffah neighborhood extending some 300 meters (330 yards) outside the Israeli-held zone, according to Oct. 14 and Dec. 18 satellite photos provided by Planet Labs.\n\nAbu Jahal moved back to his damaged house in Tuffah at the ceasefire's start. He said he frequently saw new yellow barrels appear and the military forcing out anyone living on its side of the markers.\n\nOn Jan. 7, Israeli fire hit a house near him, and the residents had to evacuate, he said. Abu Jahal said his family — including his wife, their child, and seven other relatives — may also have to leave soon.\n\n“The line is getting very close,” he said.",

    "description": "Dr. Shah said he saw the biggest change in his personal health when he did small things consistently. Here's what he prioritizes daily.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Dr. Darshan Shah, the 53-year-old founder and CEO of longevity clinic Next Health, who's based in Malibu, California. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI've been a physician for 30 years. For the first three quarters of my career, I did all sorts of surgeries, from trauma and emergency surgery, to general and reconstructive cancer surgery.\n\nI loved surgery, and I still miss being in the operating room, but I was totally burnt out. I was not happy. I did not want to go to work, and I thought, who wants to live this way?\n\nI switched into longevity medicine about 10 years ago. I made the transition because I was 50 pounds overweight, had high blood pressure, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and an autoimmune disease.\n\nI learned the science of nutrition, exercise, sleep, and functional medicine, brought all of that to my life, and got off all my medications and diagnoses of chronic diseases.\n\nThe experience made me realize that reversing chronic diseases is the kind of medicine that I want to practice. I started health optimization and longevity clinics to help people improve their lifestyle, optimize their hormones, and get them to think about how to prevent and reverse chronic disease.\n\nI always say the most important thing is to have a really good daily routine. It doesn't need to be any medications, injections, or anything fancy. I saw the biggest movement in my own personal health journey when I did the small things consistently.\n\nI start off my routine first thing in the morning because the whole world is asleep, and it's the only time I really have for myself.\n\nThe critical thing is what I don't do when I wake up. I don't wake up with my phone anywhere near me. I charge my cell phone by the coffee machine when I sleep, which is at the opposite end of the house.\n\nThat's a critical piece of my routine, because the phone deteriorates our mornings and stresses us out the minute we wake up. I don't look at my phone until 15 minutes after I've woken up.\n\nI'm lucky to have a little puppy now, but even before I had a puppy, I would go outside. I think it's extremely important to go outside first thing in the morning. If the sun isn't up yet, I go back outside when it's up because sunlight exposure is so important.\n\nThe physical act of taking your body outside is something that has been ingrained in our biology since caveman days. Going outside sets your circadian rhythm, decreases your stress levels, and improves your heart rate variability.\n\nMy morning routine is my sacred time. It goes until about 6:15 a.m.\n\nThe physical piece of my morning routine involves a quick 10- to 15-minute workout that includes stretching and lifting weights. Even if I don't get to the gym for the rest of the day, at least I got my workout in first thing.\n\nIt's so important to get quick wins. You can even start off with two minutes or five minutes a day. It doesn't matter. Once you get that quick win, it will build upon itself.\n\nAfter I do the workout, I grab a cup of coffee and take all my supplements. I put creatine in my coffee and drink a vitamin mix called IM8. I also take a couple of other supplements, including True Nitrogen, Urolithin A by Timeline, and a probiotic.\n\nThe second part of my routine is learning something new. I read for 20 minutes. I'm usually reading two different books — one about health and wellness physically, and one about health and wellness mentally.\n\nI'll read five or eight pages of each book, and it helps me have something to think about for the rest of the day.\n\nI've been journaling for 28 years now. I'm on a streak of 10 years without missing a single entry.\n\nMy journaling routine involves me writing about my day yesterday, what I'm most grateful for yesterday, and what I'm most excited for today.\n\nI skip breakfast because it allows me to control my total amount of calories throughout the day. I'm not ever hungry during breakfast and if I eat it, I won't get as good of a workout because I'll feel bloated.\n\nAfter I drop off my kids, I'll go to the gym and workout for about 45 minutes. Sometimes I'll do a cold plunge before the workout or right after I wake up, but it's so painful. I'll find every excuse in the world to skip it.\n\nI do some sprint interval training on the days that I'm working out, which is five 30-second sprints, with a four-minute break. A lot of research shows sprint interval training is the best way to improve your VO2 max, which is your body's capacity to utilize oxygen. I also always lift weights, using every muscle group.\n\nI live in Malibu, and the closest Next Health is about a 45-minute drive away. So I try to go to a location maybe once a week. Otherwise, I have a co-working facility in Malibu, and I just work out of there because it's five minutes away from my home.\n\nMy work involves lots of things. I'm on a Zoom call here and there; I have meetings; I do talks; I record podcasts; I speak to patients. There's a nice mix of things I love to do.\n\nThere are three things that are key to every work day.\n\nNo 1: I try to spend as much of my work day on my walking desk as possible. Normally, I'll get about 20,000 steps in a day.\n\nNo. 2: I always make sure I eat an early lunch, which is always a big piece of fish or meat, with a salad. Sometimes I'll throw it in a wrap or sometimes I'll supplement it with an additional protein shake.\n\nI eat 40 to 50 grams of protein in my lunch every single day. I also get a lot of vegetables in. I come from a family of diabetics, and snacking is probably the reason my entire family was diabetic, so I avoid snacking.\n\nNo. 3: If I'm sitting, I try to make sure I'm never sitting for more than 45 minutes in a row. If I'm in a sitting position, I'll set a timer. When I get up, I'll do a little bit of exercise, like jump rope or air squats. I have dumbbells in my office and just two to five minutes of that keeps the blood flowing and keeps you moving.\n\nAfter lunch, I usually have a meeting, and then I'll put a 20 to 30 minute break in my schedule to meditate.\n\nI'll go to a quiet place and turn everything off, turn the lights down, and get into a quick meditation. Lately I've been using my Oura ring. It has this unguided meditation session where it just plays some background music.\n\nAfter lunch, I'm a little tired, and so meditating really helps me decompress, get a little rest in, and recharge for the rest of the day.\n\nI did trauma surgery for six years and it was stress bombs every single day. Now I feel like I have a good handle on my stress because I got desensitized a little bit. That being said, there are stressful situations, and I just learned to pause, look inward, and give myself two minutes to recalibrate.\n\nUsually, I'm done with work by 4 p.m., and I'll pick up my kids from the bus stop and go home. I'll usually like help the kids with some homework, and hang out with the family and talk.\n\nWe try to have the earliest possible dinner. After we eat, we go for a walk, which starts my wind down routine.\n\nAfter the walk, around 7:30 p.m., I'll get rid of my cell phone and put it on the charger.\n\nThen we change all of our lights to yellow. It's beautiful and it's super relaxing.\n\nThen we start the bedtime routine. My kids are 11 and 7 years old, and they go to bed by 8 p.m. Then maybe I do some reading, or three or four days a week, I'll do a 30-minute sauna session. I get into bed by around 9:30 p.m.",

    "title": "I founded a wellness startup after leaving McKinsey. Hustle culture is a liability, not an asset.",
    "description": "Cesar Carvalho founded Wellhub, a corporate wellness platform. This is how he thinks companies should approach employee wellbeing.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Cesar Carvalho, the CEO and cofounder of Wellhub, a global corporate wellness platform. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI became interested in consulting through some older friends while studying at the University of São Paulo in Brazil. Their stories about how fast you could learn and grow in the career made me want to pursue it.\n\nI applied to all the top firms and accepted McKinsey's offer to be a business analyst in 2010 as soon as I received it. It was the best thing I could imagine as a long-term career.\n\nI was at McKinsey for about two years before they encouraged me to pursue an MBA. At that time in Brazil, you could only become an associate or a manager if you had one.\n\nI applied to Harvard Business School with the intention of returning to McKinsey and continuing the consulting journey. But the summer of my first year in Boston, I had the idea of starting WellHub.\n\nThe working environment at McKinsey was super intense. I would do an average of 10 to 12 hours a day, and when there was a crunch, it could be more.\n\nAs a consultant, I often traveled to different cities or juggled between a client's office and McKinsey's office. There were no gym memberships that provided access to facilities in different locations.\n\nIf I were at a client site and had two hours before my next meeting, I would have nothing to do but extra work. I had three gym memberships that were going unused, and I wanted to feel less stressed and improve my well-being.\n\nMy experience showed me there was a need for busy workers to get convenient access to health and well-being. And I quickly realized that was true not just for CEOs, bankers, and consultants, but also for FedEx drivers and grocery store workers.\n\nIt's now been 14 years since I started Wellhub.\n\nWe're now in 18 countries, and partner with 40,000 companies to offer wellness to their employees, including many McKinsey offices. 5 million employees engage with Wellhub every month.\n\nWith Wellhub, employees can book a class regardless of the country or city they are in, without needing a membership for a specific gym or studio. Companies pay a fixed monthly fee based on their employee count, and employees also contribute.\n\nI grew a lot at McKinsey, and that was especially thanks to one thing — in two years, I worked under seven different partners, all with their own managing style.\n\nIt could change everything: the team culture, the hours you're putting in, and the work you prioritize. I quickly learned what worked well for me, and what didn't.\n\nThe best experiences I had were when we were given flexibility. Some leaders used a process I always use today: a kickoff meeting in which every single employee is given the opportunity to talk about their own boundaries and how they operate.\n\nManagers with families would say their ideal schedule was to go home early, eat with their families, and then log back on if needed. My own boundary at McKinsey was that I was willing to work as much as needed during the week, but my weekends were sacred. During my two years at the company, I worked only four or five weekends.\n\nI learned that when expectations are clear and leaders are good enough to ask and respect the boundaries of employees, you can get everything done and still have great morale.\n\nI also made a ton of friends, and those connections became really important. My Wellhub cofounder and several colleagues worked at McKinsey with me, and two of my seven angel investors were my previous bosses.\n\nCompanies benefit from having employees who are active and in a great state of well-being.\n\nIf companies don't support well-being, they won't just be less productive — they'll also have higher costs than peers who do invest in it.\n\nIt impacts the amount of sick leave and PTO people take, and plays into retention and attraction.\n\nThe trend some corporate companies have taken towards hardcore culture is completely insane. Hustle culture is a liability, not an asset.\n\nMany CEOs are missing the mark, and the consequences will show up as companies underperform those that take a more balanced approach. Hustle culture leads to burnout, and it pushes great people out before they would otherwise leave.\n\nAs a CEO, I believe in treating every employee like an adult and trusting them. My focus is always on getting the work done — not how many hours it takes or whether someone is showing up to the office.\n\nWhen I meet coworkers, we typically do a yoga session or a workout, instead of going to bars or restaurants. If you switch a happy hour for a wellness hour, and build healthy habits into everyday routines, you can improve well-being across a company.\n\nTo me, well-being means being productive, healthy, and happy. I put productive there because it means that happiness and health are being put to good use.\n\nI want to be a great CEO to my employees, want to inspire our clients and partners to join the movement, but more importantly, I want to be a great dad to my three kids, and a great husband to my wife.\n\nMy solution is integrating life and work. You don't need to be sacrificing your marriage or family for success.\n\nWhen people ask me, \"What are your hours?\" I say, \"I'm working all the time. I'm thinking about work when I'm exercising.\"\n\nI have also built rituals in my well-being journey that I almost never break.\n\nWhenever I'm traveling, I call my kids at 7:30 p.m. no matter what — even if that means setting an alarm for 2 a.m. It's a way for me to be close to them, no matter where I am.\n\nDo you have a story to share about your career as a consultant?

    "description": "ACA subsidies expiring leaves 1.4 million fewer insured compared to 2025, as CMS data shows enrollment declines in Florida and other Southern states.",
    "fullText": "The disappearance of Affordable Care Act subsidies has millions of households feeling health insurance sticker shock.\n\nA report published by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid found that there are 1.4 million fewer people enrolled in insurance through ACA marketplaces this month compared to January 2025. States like Florida, Ohio, North Carolina, and Georgia saw the most significant dips.\n\n\"People have less access to care, and that tends to translate into worse health outcomes,\" said Matthew Fiedler, a senior fellow at The Brookings Institution. He added that many households' financial security is at risk: \"People will face big bills that they either can't pay, and that hurts their credit. Or they do pay, but it requires them to skimp in other areas.\"\n\nBusiness Insider broke down the enrollment changes by state — and spoke with experts about why this CMS data doesn't yet tell the whole story of marketplace enrollment in 2026.\n\nThe number of marketplace enrollees declined most significantly in the South and Southeast, though the majority of states reported a downswing. Florida saw enrollment dive by more than 260,000 people. Registration in a few states, like Texas and California, increased.\n\nPeople might opt for a marketplace plan if their employer doesn't offer coverage, if they're self-employed, if they lose their job, or if their income is too high to qualify for Medicaid. In context, the 1.4 million dip this year is notable: Marketplace enrollment had jumped from 11 to over 24 million between 2015 and 2025.\n\nThe enhanced ACA subsidies — which were passed in 2021 and expired on December 31 — made health insurance more affordable for lower- and middle-income Americans. They allowed people with incomes up to 400% of the poverty line (which is $128,600 annually for a family of four) to claim relief on healthcare costs.\n\nA KFF estimate found that, without these credits in place, Americans in the marketplace could see their out-of-pocket premium costs more than double compared to last year.\n\nWhite House Spokesperson Kush Desai told Business Insider that \"ACA enrollment declined by 3.5 percent between 2025 and 2026 — entirely a result of the Trump administration's commonsense measures to cut waste, fraud, and abuse and remove people who were improperly enrolled on highly-subsidized ACA plans.\"\n\nEfforts to renew these credits were a point of contention between Democrats and Republicans in Congress, contributing to the latest government shutdown. Lawmakers opted not to renew the subsidies in December, and the latest ACA vote is stalled in the Senate until late January.\n\nRepublicans have said they aim to reach a compromise healthcare strategy, but a plan President Donald Trump released on January 15 does not mention subsidies. The plan lays out the administration's goals to lower drug prices and insurance premiums, implement cost-sharing programs, and increase cost transparency.\n\n\"The basic contour of the plan is contradictory,\" said Gideon Lukens, senior fellow and director of research and data analysis at the Center on Budget Policy and Priorities. \"Much less the question of how this would work, who would get what, and why this is better than directly covering people's premiums to prevent the spikes millions of people are facing right now.\"\n\nPolicy analysts told Business Insider they expect a steeper decline in ACA enrollment over the next few months. The January report is a snapshot of the marketplace landscape, but comes with caveats.\n\nThe latest data shows how many Americans selected a marketplace plan during open enrollment or were automatically renewed for their existing ACA coverage. It doesn't capture how many people have paid their health insurance premiums, meaning that more people are likely to drop coverage once they start receiving bills. A recent Congressional Budget Office report estimates that nearly 4 million Americans will lose or drop insurance over the next decade.\n\n\"Many likely signed up when the premiums they would end up facing were uncertain and then waited to see what they would have to pay,\" said Matthew Buettgens, a senior fellow at The Urban Institute.\n\nFor the few states where enrollment spiked, Fielder theorized that local healthcare policy is a factor. California offers its own ACA subsidies, for example, so residents are less vulnerable to the federal changes.\n\nBesides the direct impact on patients, Fielder also said the lapse of ACA credits could put more pressure on hospitals, because providers could see an influx of uninsured patients, and people would be less likely to seek care in the first place.\n\n\"There will be facilities that were already financially fragile for whom this is the straw that breaks the camel's back,\" he said.",

    "description": "Media mogul Oprah Winfrey is poised to change how we talk about the GLP-1 trend. \nIt's part of the 'Oprah Effect' on wellness.",
    "fullText": "Nothing has been more earthshaking than the meteoric rise of GLP-1 drugs for weight loss in the health industry — except perhaps one woman: Oprah Winfrey.\n\nJust when we thought weight loss meds had hit Peak Hype, Winfrey has entered the chat, releasing her latest book, \"Enough: Your Health, Your Weight, and What It's Like To Be Free,\" cowritten with Dr. Ania Jastreboff. The book catalogs her seemingly on-again, off-again, now committed relationship to the medication, starting in 2023.\n\nIt also comes after her full-throated endorsement of the medications. Winfrey's embrace of GLP-1s signals a decisive shift away from willpower-based weight loss and toward a medical model that is defining the American wellness zeitgeist.\n\n\"She's giving people permission to talk about it,\" said Dr. Holly Wyatt, an endocrinologist who specializes in weight management and metabolism. \"It validates what the doctors and scientists have been saying for years, but Oprah brought it to the public in a way that people really heard it.\"\n\nWinfrey secured her status as a health authority from early in her career with a unique empathy toward personal weight loss stories.\n\nHer eponymous talk show provided a rare safe space for overweight people to open up about their experiences, said Sabrina Strings, author of \"Fearing the Black Body: The Racial Origins of Fat Phobia.\"\n\n\"It was probably the only place you could go in public and not be shamed as long as you were repentant,\" she told Business Insider.\n\nA key part of the weight-loss narratives on her show — including Winfrey's own experience — is the redemption arc, Strings said, offering a vulnerable perspective on how people felt about gaining and losing weight.\n\nThat's particularly poignant in a time when celebs like Serena Williams, Lizzo, and Queen Latifah once pushed back against body shaming — but have lately been called out for promoting weight loss products or routines. Black women have been a particular audience for this new era of marketing, Strings wrote in her blog.\n\nWinfrey has spent decades leveraging her business savvy to make her personal struggle a source of strength and profit.\n\n\"She's open in saying 'I want to be thin and I have a path to do that,'\" Strings said. \"That's why she remains an icon for weight loss in the age of Ozempic.\"\n\nThree moments explain why Winfrey still moves the weight-loss market. It started with a little red wagon.\n\nIn 1988, Winfrey made TV history by sharing her recent weight loss, represented by 67 pounds of animal fat in a Radio Flyer, in the most-watched episode of the already hit show (even beating out later career-highlight interviews with Michael Jackson and Meghan Markle).\n\nIn response, liquid diets saw unprecedented success as viewers reached for the products Winfrey credited for helping her shed the pounds. It was an early instance of the \"Oprah Effect\" that appearing on her show or among her recommendations could lead to almost overnight success.\n\nDecades later, Oprah said the wagon of fat was one of her biggest regrets, and apologized for what she described as her role in shame-centered diet culture.\n\nStarting around 2004, a charismatic heart surgeon, Dr. Mehmet Oz, began appearing on Oprah's show.\n\nAcross more than 50 episodes (and later his own show backed by Oprah's production company), Oz solidified the \"Ask a Doctor\" era of TV as audiences clamored for the MD's advice on everything from supplements to cancer risk.\n\nHe also courted controversy over the years through lucrative partnerships with questionable weight-loss products and through hotly criticized statements about COVID-19.\n\nOz is now the administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, appointed to the position by President Donald Trump shortly after the 2024 election.\n\nIn the mid-2010s, Winfrey took on a new role as defender of our right to enjoy carbs.\n\nAs keto and Atkins diets were exploding in popularity, she backed WeightWatchers, snapping up 10% of shares and becoming the face of the company in an ad proclaiming her love of bread.\n\nSNL and other internet parodies had a field day, but WeightWatchers, then struggling to compete in an increasingly competitive industry, increased its value by 1200% over the subsequent three years.\n\nIt wasn't happily ever after, however. Winfrey announced she was leaving WeightWatchers in 2024. Stocks immediately tumbled by 25%.\n\nIt seemed to signal a dramatic pivot from old-school American weight loss plans full of calorie-counting and color-coding — ushering in the new Age of GLP-1s.\n\nEven while she was with WeightWatchers, Winfrey was already starting her next big love affair in the health industry.\n\nIn 2023, she announced publicly that she had used GLP-1s to lose weight and spoke out about the misconception that medication is somehow a shortcut or easy way out.\n\nThe moment coincided with widespread acceptance of Wegovy, Zepound, and their cohort in the mainstream. As many as one in eight Americans had tried the drugs at some point, embracing the idea that biological \"food noise\" and processed food — not a lack of discipline — can drive us to overeat.\n\nSince then, Winfrey has wrestled with the notion that weight loss or maintenance is about willpower. Late last year, she shared her experience quitting medication through 2025, to see if she could keep her weight stable with lifestyle changes. She said she regained 20 pounds.\n\nNow 71, Winfrey is back on the drugs and considers them a lifelong routine similar to high-blood pressure medication. Her one regret, she said, is not finding GLP-1s sooner.\n\nNow that the Oprah Effect and GLP-1s have converged, the world will be watching for Version 2.0 — the next generation of GLP-1s in pill form or with even more benefits not just for weight but potentially longevity and brain health, too.",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump suffered a stroke several months ago and has kept it from the public, a prominent medical expert has suggested.\n\nProfessor Bruce Davidson of Washington State University’s Elson S. Floyd College of Medicine made the bombshell claim about the 79-year-old president’s health while laying out “lines of evidence supportive” that have also been reported on by the Daily Beast over the past year.\n\n“I think his stroke was on the left side of the brain, which controls the right side of the body,” Davidson told biographer Sidney Blumenthal and Princeton historian Sean Wilentz on their podcast, The Court of History.\n\n“I think the stroke was six months ago or more, earlier in 2025,” he continued. “There are videos of him shuffling his feet, which is not what we’d seen previously when he was striding on the golf course. We’ve seen him holding his right hand cradled in his left. Earlier in 2025, he was garbling words, which he hadn’t done before and which he’s improved upon more recently.”\n\nDavidson also pointed to what he described as “marked episodes of excessive daytime sleepiness,” known medically as hypersomnolence, which he said is common among stroke patients. Trump is now routinely appearing to nod off in public appearances such as White House events.\n\nHe further suggested that footage showing Trump gingerly descending the steps of Air Force One while gripping the banister with his left hand, despite the president being right-handed, is “consistent with having had a stroke on the left side of the brain.”\n\nDavidson did not specify what sort of stroke he believes the president may have suffered, but said if he is correct with his claim then it “looks like he’s had significant recovery.”\n\nSpeculation about the mental and physical decline of Trump, who is on track to become the oldest president in U.S. history, has circulated for months.\n\nThe president has frequently appeared in public with large, visible bruises on his hands, which he desperately attempts to conceal with blotches of makeup.\n\nTrump has also taken steps to hide from public view his swollen cankles, a symptom of the medical condition chronic venous insufficiency, which the White House admitted the president had in July 2024.\n\nAdditional concerns were raised after Trump appeared at an event commemorating the anniversary of the Sept. 11 terror attacks with his face drooping to one side. Multiple social media users speculated at the time that the appearance could be a sign of a stroke, though no diagnosis has been confirmed.\n\nIn a candid interview with The Wall Street Journal published this month, Trump acknowledged several health issues and treatments, including briefly wearing compression socks to help manage swelling in his legs.\n\nHe also made the startling admission that he takes more aspirin than his doctors recommend for “cardiac prevention.” Trump and the White House have repeatedly attributed the unsightly bruising on the 79-year-old’s hands to his daily aspirin use, combined with his frequently shaking people’s hands.\n\nElsewhere during his podcast appearance, Davidson suggested that Trump’s erratic and aggressive governing style during his second term could also be consistent with post-stroke behavioral changes.\n\n“It’s a very serious, concerning, life-threatening, upsetting, scary event, and people react in different ways,” Davidson said. “Some people respond with humility and gratitude. Others become euphoric—‘I was at the cliff of death, and now I’m back.’ And some think, ‘That was my chance to die, and I didn’t—so now I’m going to do everything I wanted to do, because the next one may be fatal.’”\n\nIn response, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told the Daily Beast: “As the President’s physician, Dr. Sean Barbabella, has made clear time and again—and as the American people see with their own eyes every single day—President Trump remains in excellent overall health.”\n\n“President Trump’s relentless work ethic, unmatched energy, and historic accessibility stand in sharp contrast to what we saw during the past four years when the failing legacy media intentionally covered up Joe Biden’s serious mental and physical decline from the American people,” she continued. “Pushing these fake and desperate narratives now about President Trump is why Americans’ trust in the media just fell to a new all-time low.”",

You're reading stories on this site called GameSpot, so it's safe to assume that you love to play some video games, too. However, we all need to be careful with how long we play video games because a new study suggests that logging too many hours could seriously hurt our physical, emotional, and mental health.\nIn a new study published in ScienceDirect's Nutrition journal and reported on by Medical Xpress, 10 different researchers from around the world investigated the effects \"excessive gaming\" has on young people. Led by Professor Mario Siervo of the Curtin School of Population Health in Perth, Western Australia, and surveying 317 students from five Australian universities with a median age of 20 years old, the study found that \"high gamers\"--people whose playtime exceeded 10 hours a week--were at greater risk of dietary issues, sleep deprivation, and weight gain.",

    "fullText": "The average 401(k) balance for people in their 40s is $407,675, while the median is $162,143.\n\nFor people in their 50s, the balance jumps to $622,566 and $251,758, respectively.\n\nThoughtful retirement planning is about increasing contributions in your 40s, utilizing catch-up contributions once you turn 50, and reviewing your investment mix and fees to support an earlier exit from the workforce.\n\nRetiring early requires more than just hitting benchmarks; you'll need to prepare for a longer retirement horizon, higher healthcare costs, and limited access to Social Security, Medicare, and possibly your 401(k).\n\nBut if early retirement is on your mind, your 401(k) balance takes on extra weight. Not only do those savings need to last longer, but you can't freely access them until age 59½ without penalties. That means if you plan to stop working at 55, for example, you'll need a strategy to bridge those years with other savings or income.\n\nLooking at how your balance compares to others your age is a useful checkpoint, but planning for early retirement requires going further.\n\nAccording to Empower, the average 401(k) balance for individuals in their 40s was $407,675. By their 50s, the average climbs to $622,566. Balances are higher thanks to more years of contributions, higher earnings, and catch-up contributions available at 50.\n\nAverages, however, don't tell the whole story. A handful of large accounts skew the averages upwards. The median balances—$162,143 for people in their 40s and $251,758 for those in their 50s—offer a more realistic midpoint.\n\nFor those considering early retirement, these figures highlight a challenge: many workers are far below what they'd likely need to stop working a decade or two early.\n\nIf your goal is to retire early, the math changes. Your savings have to last longer and cover more uncertainty, especially health care and inflation.\n\nMany rules of thumb assume a standard retirement age. Fidelity, for example, suggests saving 3x your salary by age 40, 6x by 50, and 8x by 60. On an $85,000 annual income, that's $255,000, $510,000, and $680,000.",

    "fullText": "PHILADELPHIA -- The health of Joel Embiid has always been a big talking point when it comes to the Philadelphia 76ers. The 2023 MVP winner has had the worst luck in that department as he was limited to just 39 games in the 2023-24 season and the only 19 in 2024-25.\n\nHe has now played 21 games in 2025-26 and has shown signs that he is back to his usual self. He had 20 points in Wednesday's loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers, and even had a moment when he dove into the crowd after a loose ball to try and ignite the Sixers.\n\nThat has to be a sign that the big fella is OK and beginning to trust his body more.\n\n\"I may be stupid, but at that time, you know, I felt like we needed it,\" Embiid said of his dive into the crowd. \"I mean, I just didn't dive just because I wanted to show off. I felt like I had a chance to sit the ball, and I did in that moment, being down in that moment, kind of every possession mattered. But we should not put ourselves in that position in the first place.\"\n\nJoel Embiid dove into the crowd to save the loose ball for Philly 😳\n\nLove the hustle 👏 pic.twitter.com/vIMHbmq7Nn\n\n— Yahoo Sports (@YahooSports) January 15, 2026\n\nEmbiid is right about the Sixers shouldn't have put themselves in that position. They were down 33-18 after the first quarter and could only shave two points off that deficit going into the half. The Cavaliers then pushed the lead to 30 as Donovan Mitchell got going for Cleveland.\n\nWith that being said, a positive for the Sixers in this one is that Embiid continues to work his way back into a rhythm. He continues to look like himself and that is going to be a key development for Philadelphia.\n\n\"I’m getting better,\" he said. \"I still feel like I'm not close to where I want to be yet, but it's a progress every single day. I feel pretty good. So, just got to keep putting the work in and get there.\"\n\nEmbiid and the Sixers will take on the Cavs again in a rematch on Friday at the Xfinity Mobile Arena.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Sixers Wire: Joel Embiid talks diving into crowd, health after Sixers fall to Cavs",

    "fullText": "Research finds no evidence heavier social media use or more gaming increases symptoms of anxiety or depression\n\nScreen time spent gaming or on social media does not cause mental health problems in teenagers, according to a large-scale study.\n\nWith ministers in the UK considering whether to follow Australia’s example by banning social media use for under-16s, the findings challenge concerns that long periods spent gaming or scrolling TikTok or Instagram are driving an increase in teenagers’ depression, anxiety and other mental health conditions.\n\nResearchers at the University of Manchester followed 25,000 11- to 14-year-olds over three school years, tracking their self-reported social media habits, gaming frequency and emotional difficulties to find out whether technology use genuinely predicted later mental health difficulties.\n\nParticipants were asked how much time on a normal weekday in term time they spent on TikTok, Instagram, Snapchat and other social media, or gaming. They were also asked questions about their feelings, mood and wider mental health.\n\nThe study found no evidence for boys or girls that heavier social media use or more frequent gaming increased teenagers’ symptoms of anxiety or depression over the following year.\n\nIncreases in girls’ and boys’ social media use from year 8 to year 9 and from year 9 to year 10 had zero detrimental impact on their mental health the following year, the authors found. More time spent gaming also had a zero negative effect on pupils’ mental health.\n\n“We know families are worried, but our results do not support the idea that simply spending time on social media or gaming leads to mental health problems – the story is far more complex than that,” said the lead author Dr Qiqi Cheng.\n\nThe research, published in the Journal of Public Health, also examined whether how pupils use social media makes a difference, with participants asked how much time spent chatting with others, posting stories, pictures and videos, browsing feeds, profiles or scrolling through photos and stories. The scientists found that actively chatting on social media or passive scrolling feeds did not appear to drive mental health difficulties.\n\nThe authors stressed that the findings did not mean online experiences were harmless. Hurtful messages, online pressures and extreme content could have detrimental effects on wellbeing, but focusing on screen time alone was not helpful, they said.\n\n“Our findings tell us that young people’s choices around social media and gaming may be shaped by how they’re feeling but not necessarily the other way around,” said Prof Neil Humphrey, a co-author. “Rather than blaming technology itself, we need to pay attention to what young people are doing online, who they’re connecting with and how supported they feel in their daily lives.”",

    "fullText": "Ian Alexander Shelton’s body was recovered from Lake Afton in Kansas more than a month after he went missing\n\n“I want people to remember him as someone who gave up a lot to be with his mom, who’s fighting cancer, and was always there for her when she needed him,” his friend Justin Stroud said\n\nDetectives confirmed that Shelton had been at the lake during the early hours of Dec. 3 and suspected he may have been experiencing a “mental health crisis”\n\nA missing man’s body was recovered from Kansas' Lake Afton more than a month after he reportedly vanished from a night out.\n\nIan Alexander Shelton's remains were recovered on the south side of the lake on the afternoon of Saturday, Jan. 10, the Sedgwick County Sheriff’s Office said.\n\nHis cause of death has not yet been confirmed.\n\nAuthorities first sought the public’s help with locating Shelton, 30, on Dec. 5 after he was reported missing, according to a news release.\n\nShelton was last seen leaving the Let’s Roll Seneca bowling alley at 9:30 p.m. local time on Dec. 2 and was considered endangered because of the cold weather and the clothes he was wearing.\n\nDetectives searched the Lake Afton area on Dec. 6 and, two days later, confirmed that Shelton had been at the lake during the early hours of Dec. 3. They suspected he may have been experiencing a “mental health crisis” at the time of his disappearance.\n\n\"We don't show any other signs right now to think that there was any foul play … I know there's been some speculation on social media about that,” Sedgwick County Sheriff's Capt. Matthew Lynch told ABC affiliate KAKE last month, noting that Shelton seemed to be with a woman at the lake.\n\n\"We are trying to preserve evidence or statements that we get in case this does turn into a criminal investigation,” Lynch said then.\n\nOn Dec. 9, the sheriff’s office led a “large-scale coordinated search of approximately 3.5 square miles in and around Lake Afton Park,” according to a news release.\n\nBut after finding no signs of Shelton after days of search efforts, organized operations were concluded on Dec. 10.\n\n“It’s just been like holding your breath for as long as you can, hoping for air,” Justin Stroud, a close friend, told KAKE of what it was like searching for Shelton alongside more of his loved ones.\n\n“We met when he was 13. I’m a little bit older than him, but we met through a really close friend of ours, and we hit it off right away,” Stroud said.\n\nAccording to the sheriff’s office, Sedgwick County firefighters were finally able to recover Shelton’s body on Saturday when an individual reported an unidentified object “floating in the water.”\n\n“This case remains an open and active investigation,“ officials said. “The Sedgwick County Sheriff’s Office extends its condolences to the family and friends of Ian Alexander Shelton during this difficult time.”\n\nStroud has remembered his longtime friend for his positive and supportive personality — especially when it came to supporting his mom during her journey with stage four cancer.\n\n“He was an amazing person. There’s not anybody that knew Ian that would ever have anything bad to say about him,” Stroud told KAKE. “He lit up rooms when he walked into them.”\n\n“I want people to remember him as someone who gave up a lot to be with his mom, who’s fighting cancer, and was always there for her when she needed him,” he added.\n\nShelton’s mother, Stacy, also paid tribute to him on social media.\n\n“I always hoped that they would have been able to spend years together playing guitar,” she wrote of her late husband and son on Facebook. “I'm comforted to know that Ian is with his Mark making music once again.”\n\nIn a separate post, she added, “I love you son.”",

    "fullText": "Exclusive: Health secretary issues invitation in push for UK to consider copying landmark restrictions in Australia\n\nWes Streeting has asked Jonathan Haidt, a bestselling author and high-profile advocate of banning social media for under-16s, to speak to his officials in his push for the UK to consider following a landmark ban in Australia.\n\nThe health secretary has invited Haidt to address an event with staff, charities and MPs after the prime minister, Keir Starmer, said he was open to stricter limits for young people.\n\nHaidt came to prominence after writing Anxious Generation, in which he argued that widespread use of smartphones had caused a mental health crisis for young people.\n\nHe has become a global activist for stricter rules, including bans on social media for under-16s and on smartphones in schools.\n\nStarmer said on Monday he would consider all options in curbing young people’s access to social media. “We are looking at Australia, there are different ways you can enforce it,” he told a meeting of Labour MPs.\n\nThe prime minister also addressed the use of phones in school, adding: “No one thinks you should have phones in schools.”\n\nThose comments reflected a change of heart from Starmer, who previously said a social media ban would be difficult to police and could push teenagers toward the dark web.\n\nFleur Anderson, a Labour MP who has been campaigning for stricter curbs, said: “I was really pleased to hear that the prime minister is looking seriously at the Australian model. It is time we regulated this and gave young people the protections they need.”\n\nStarmer’s words reflect a growing Westminster consensus in favour of such a move – one which has been provoked in part by the row over X’s AI tool allowing users to generate sexualised images of women and children.\n\nOn Tuesday, Ed Davey of the Liberal Democrats became the latest party leader to leave the door open to a social media ban for young people after a similar move by Nigel Farage of Reform UK.\n\nKemi Badenoch, the Conservative leader, announced on Sunday she would enact a ban if elected prime minister, and would push for one from opposition. Andy Burnham, the Labour mayor of Greater Manchester, has also said he would support such a move.\n\nGovernment ministers are split between those who are enthusiastic supporters of curbs on social media and those who have concerns about how they would be implemented and what the impact would be on teenagers.\n\nStreeting has been one of those most in favour of taking stronger action, telling the BBC last week: “Sometimes I feel like my concentration span suffers because of doom scrolling and the way in which information is served up in increasingly short, bite-size chunks. And I worry about what that means for the development and the cognitive development of a generation of children and young people.”\n\nAs well as the event with Haidt, Streeting has asked officials to look into the details of Australia’s ban, which came into force at the start of the year.\n\nThe technology secretary, Liz Kendall, is also understood to be looking at the Australian policy, though she has not commissioned a team to actively examine it.\n\nAllies say she is listening to warnings from charities such as the NSPCC that an outright ban could drive young people toward the dark web and undermine attempts to teach them how to use social media responsibly.\n\nBridget Phillipson, the education secretary, and Lisa Nandy, the culture secretary, share similar concerns, according to government insiders.\n\nNandy commissioned a survey of 14,000 young people that found most did not want an outright ban. She told the Guardian last year: “The challenge with banning social media is enforcement. Are we really saying as a country that we’re going to start prosecuting under-18s for using social media?”\n\nSenior government sources say they are concerned about the possibility that Labour peers will back a Conservative-led attempt to amend the children’s wellbeing and schools bill to include a ban for under-16s.\n\nThe amendment, proposed by the former minister John Nash, has been signed by the Labour peer Luciana Berger and the Liberal Democrat Floella Benjamin.\n\nGovernment officials believe that enough Labour peers could vote for or abstain on that amendment to see it pass when it is debated next week. The issue would then come to the Commons, where several Labour MPs could join the Tories in supporting it.",

    "description": "Rachel Swanson, a registered dietitian, aims to eat protein and fiber as well as a wide variety of plants to support a healthy microbiome.",
    "fullText": "Most dietary advice is fairly straightforward: eat whole foods with a good balance of protein, fiber, carbs, and healthy fats.\n\nConsistently adhering to that guidance is another story, particularly if you live a busy life.\n\nRachel Swanson, a registered dietitian at LifeSpan Medicine and author of \"Trying!: A Science-Backed Plan to Optimize Your Fertility,\" splits her time between New York City and Miami, spending about half the year in each. She also takes small-group workout classes three times a week, focusing on strength training.\n\nShe says eating enough nutrients, especially protein for muscle-building, is crucial for her. She generally aims for around 0.7 grams of protein per pound of body weight, the protein intake usually recommended for physically active people.\n\n\"Every single ingredient is going to be very intentionally added,\" Swanson, 35, told Business Insider. \"What are the foods that are going to give me the biggest bang-for-my-nutritional-buck, so to speak?\" She incorporates foods like blueberries and sweet potatoes for their high fiber and vitamin content.\n\nThroughout the workweek, she follows an \"automated\" meal plan, eating mostly foods she batch-cooked in advance. Beyond making her jam-packed days easier, preparing meals in advance helps her eat a wide variety of plants — essential for good gut health.\n\n\"I know every single day is built in support for my gut microbiome,\" she said, deliberately rotating which vegetables, herbs, and spices she uses in her cooking to increase her variety.\n\nSwanson shared what she typically eats in a day to get enough protein, fiber, and other nutrients.\n\nSwanson is typically too busy to eat a full breakfast on weekday mornings. Because she starts her clinic hours at 8 a.m., she usually packs in media interviews and other meetings right before.\n\nShe keeps her mornings simple with some lemon water, coffee, or yerba mate — a caffeinated herbal drink similar to tea with additional antioxidants.\n\nIf she has time to eat, it's usually a quick high-protein snack to keep her satiated until her early lunch. Lately, it's been homemade turkey meatballs with sweet potatoes, onions, and blueberries.\n\nMost of Swanson's lunches are pre-cooked meals, and she usually has two different options in the fridge to avoid the monotony of eating the same lunch five days in a row.\n\nShe frequently opts for hearty soups and stews. The meals usually feature an animal protein, like chicken, and Swanson rotates the vegetables and herbs.\n\n\"I like to get whatever's in season if possible — that's just automatically going to maximize the diversity,\" she said.\n\nOne of her favorites is a protein- and fiber-packed \"golden soup\" with chicken, bone broth, carrots, cauliflower, white beans, light coconut milk, ginger, and some turmeric, which has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory benefits.\n\nSwanson isn't a big snacker, but she loves a warm beverage.\n\nIn the winter, she makes hot chocolate with CocoaVia, a cocoa supplement infused with flavanols, which have been shown to have some heart and brain health benefits. She mixes the powder with non-dairy milk and a small amount of sweetener.\n\nAnother favorite treat is a homemade matcha latte. She prepares ceremonial-grade matcha with non-dairy milk and mixes in about a tablespoon of chia seeds, which add protein, fiber, and omega-3s and can also help with appetite control.\n\n\"The combination, I know it probably sounds crazy when I describe it, but it's literally like drinking boba tea because it's chewy and fun,\" she said. \"It's the easiest possible way to get 5 grams of fiber injected into your day.\"\n\nLike her lunches, Swanson also batch-preps most of her dinners, which always feature a core protein and at least one vegetable for fiber and nutrients.\n\nA recent favorite was a fajita made with grass-fed steak, which studies find to be leaner and richer in omega-3s than regular steak. She added sautéed peppers, onions, and pineapple, topping the meal with fresh cilantro to further maximize her microbiome diversity.\n\nFollowing her rule of ensuring every meal has some nutritional value, Swanson likes to make a smoothie with frozen mixed berries, frozen cauliflower, non-dairy milk, and a scoop of chocolate or nut butter-flavored protein powder (she opts for an organic, grass-fed beef isolate version).\n\nShe said it's a delicious way to get a little extra protein and fiber. \"It kind of turns out as a chocolate-covered-cherry or a PB&J flavor,\" she said.",

    "fullText": "We often hear talk of things being good for our microbiome, and in turn, good for our health. But it wasn’t entirely clear what a healthy gut microbiome consisted of. Now, a study of more than 34,000 people has edged us closer towards understanding the mixes of microbes that reliably signal we have low inflammation, good immunity and healthy cholesterol levels.\n\nYour gut microbiome can influence your immune system, rate of ageing and your risk of poor mental health. Despite a profusion of home tests promising to reveal the make-up of your gut community, their usefulness has been debated, because it is hard to pin down what a “good” microbial mix is.\n\nThe shocking discovery that our gut microbiome drives ageing\n\nPrevious measures mainly looked at species diversity, with a greater array of bacteria being better. But it is difficult to identify particular communities of interacting organisms that are implicated in a specific aspect of our health, because microbiomes vary so much from person to person.\n\n“There is a very intricate relationship between the food we eat, the composition of our gut microbiome and the effects the gut microbiome has on our health. The only way to try to map these connections is having large enough sample sizes,” says Nicola Segata at the University of Trento in Italy.\n\nTo create such a map, Segata and his colleagues have assessed a dataset from more than 34,500 people who took part in the PREDICT programme in the UK and US, run by microbiome testing firm Zoe, and validated the results against data from 25 other cohorts from Western countries.\n\nYour science-backed guide to the easy habits that will help you sleep well, stress less, eat smarter and age better.\n\nOf the thousands of species that reside in the human gut, the researchers focused on 661 bacterial species that were found in more than 20 per cent of the Zoe participants. They used this to determine the 50 bacteria most associated with markers of good health – assessed via markers such as body mass index and blood glucose levels – and the 50 most linked to poor health.\n\nThe 50 “good bug” species – 22 of which are new to science – seem to influence four key areas: cholesterol levels; inflammation and immune health; body fat distribution; and blood sugar control.\n\nThe participants who were deemed healthy, because they had no known medical conditions, had about 3.6 more of these species than people with a condition, while people at a healthy weight hosted about 5.2 more of them than those with obesity.\n\nThe researchers suggest that good or bad health outcomes may come about due to the vital role the gut microbiome plays in releasing chemicals involved in cholesterol transport, inflammation reduction, fat metabolism and insulin sensitivity.\n\nAs to the specific species that were present, most microbes in both the “good” and “bad” rankings belong to the Clostridia class. Within this class, species in the Lachnospiraceae family featured 40 times, with 13 seemingly having favourable effects and 27 unfavourable.\n\nWhy caring for your microbiome is crucial if you want to live to 100\n\nOur friendly – and not so friendly – gut bacteria lie at the core of healthy ageing. Research is now revealing what it takes to maintain a youthful microbiome\n\n“The study highlights bacterial groups that could be further investigated regarding their potential positive or negative impact [on] health conditions, such as high blood glucose levels or obesity,” says Ines Moura at the University of Leeds, UK.\n\nThe link between these microbes and diet was assessed via food questionnaires and data logged on the Zoe app, where users are advised to aim for at least 30 different plants a week and at least three portions a day of fermented foods, with an emphasis on fibre and not too many ultra-processed options.\n\nThe researchers found that most of the microbes either aligned with a generally healthy diet and better health, or with a worse diet and poorer health. But 65 of the 661 microbes didn’t fit in.\n\n“These 65 bacteria are a testament to the fact that the picture is still more complex than what we saw,” says Segata, who also works as a consultant for Zoe. “The effects may depend on the other microbes that are there, or the specific strain of the bacterium or the specific diet.”\n\nThis sorting of “good” versus “bad” bacteria has enabled the researchers to create a 0 to 1000 ranking scale for the overall health of someone’s gut microbiota, which is already used as part of Zoe’s gut health tests.\n\n“Think of a healthy gut microbiome as a community of chemical factories. We want large numbers of species, we want the good ones outnumbering the bad ones, and when you get that, then you’re producing really healthy chemicals, which have impacts across the body,” says team member Tim Spector at King’s College London, co-founder of Zoe.\n\nThe surprising relationship between your microbiome and sleeping well\n\nResearch is revealing the complex relationship between sleep and the gut microbiome, raising the prospect that eating better during the day might help you get a better night’s rest\n\nThis doesn’t mean the ideal healthy gut microbiome has been pinned down, though. “Defining a healthy microbiome is a difficult task, as the gut microbiome composition is impacted by diet, but it can also change with environmental factors, age and health conditions that require long-term medication,” says Moura.\n\n“We really need to think about our body and our microbiome as two complex systems that together make one even more complex system,” says Segata. “When you change one thing, everything is modified a bit as a consequence. Understanding what is cause and effect in many cases can be very intricate.”\n\nBigger studies are needed to tease out these links and cover more of the global population, says Segata. However, once we have established the baseline of your health and microbiome, it should become possible to recommend specific foods to tweak your gut bacteria, he says.\n\nNature DOI: 10.1038/s41586-025-09854-7\n\nReceive a weekly dose of discovery in your inbox.

    "description": "Winfrey appeared on 'Today' to promote her new book, 'Enough.'",
    "fullText": "Sheinelle Jones‘ second day as the fourth of Today‘s new cohost featured a very special guest.\n\nOprah Winfrey stopped by the NBC morning show to promote her new book, Enough: Your Health, Your Weight, and What It’s Like To Be Free, which she cowrote with endocrinologist and associate professor at the Yale School of Medicine Dr. Ania M. Jastreboff. While reflecting on her weight-loss journey, Winfrey shared some surprising side effects she’s experienced while taking a GLP-1 medication.\n\nJastreboff stated that the most common symptoms for people taking weight-loss medication include nausea, diarrhea, and constipation.\n\n“I never had nausea or diarrhea, but I did have the third one,” Winfrey stated. “I finally figured out, for me, what the right combination of magnesium and water is. I have to drink a lot of water. I have to have a gallon of water a day.”\n\nAccording to Winfrey, she has to finish drinking her gallon of water before 4 p.m., or else she will be up all night. While drinking lots of water makes Winfrey’s kidneys “very happy,” Jastreboff said there are other ways to “lessen nausea” while on weight-loss medication.\n\n“The most important way is working with your healthcare provider and going up very, very slowly. So, start slow, go slow. If you’re feeling nauseated, then don’t increase the dose,” she explained. “And there’s other things — not eating past the point of fullness, making sure you’re monitoring which foods could make you worse. All of these different things can lower the side effects.”\n\nWinfrey revealed that she gained 20 pounds last year after going off of her medication to test if she would retain her weight loss without the drug. “If you’re on blood pressure medication, you get your blood pressure to the level that your doctor says is healthy for you, you come off the medication, your blood pressure is gonna go up,” she stated. “The same thing is true for this. I know it ’cause I proved it.”\n\nEarlier in the episode, Winfrey said she has a newfound sense of freedom since starting a GLP-1 prescription. “The new freedom is understanding that all those years that I suffered and was on the tabloids every week and made fun of and was the butt of everybody’s jokes, and I thought it was because of my lack of willpower,” she told Jones and Jenna Bush Hager. “[I thought] ‘What is wrong with me that I can be successful in so many ways and I can’t conquer this thing?’ Now I know that it has nothing to do with willpower. It has everything to do with your biology.”\n\nWinfrey said she hopes her and Jastreboff’s new book will help change the conversation about obesity and weight loss. “Back in the day, when I first started The Oprah [Winfrey] Show, in ’86, ’87, we did our first show on alcoholism. And people in the audience were like, ‘Oh, just put the bottle down,'” she recalled. “People did not recognize — refused to recognize — that alcoholism is a disease. And so, now we’re saying the same thing about obesity.”\n\nWinfrey continued, “It’s a disease. It’s a chronic disease. You have to manage it. And even when you think you’ve gotten to your goal weight, it’s not the answer because what the medications do is manage the set point in your body.”\n\nToday With Jenna & Sheinelle, Weekdays, 10 a.m./9c, NBC\n\nRead the latest entertainment news on TV Insider.",

    "fullText": "I grew up on the shores of Lake Erie, in a town just south of Buffalo, New York. Ice was something we chiseled off a car in winter, not something that's dropped into a drink. For me, life on a tropical island was a pipe dream.\n\nIn high school, I was the geeky kid, always excited to read stories in Time and The New York Times about exotic, far-off places. I knew early on that I wanted a job that would allow me to experience global events firsthand.\n\nA semester abroad in France cemented my ambition. I lived with a family who also rented to an American expat. He talked casually about his Swiss ski holidays, escapes to Greece and Turkey, and his favorite cafés in Paris.\n\nI already knew then, at 21, that was the life I wanted. Why work in \"boring\" New York or Chicago when I could aim for Paris, Hong Kong, or London?\n\nAfter working as an editor in New York City for several years, my then-wife got offered a job in Singapore. It was the golden opportunity we both wanted. What we thought would be a posting of just a few years turned into decades. We divorced in 2011, but both stayed in Singapore, building our careers and lives.\n\nI'd always wanted to be a photojournalist, so in 2000 I decided to pursue it full-time. My location made me a standout. Asia was entering a travel boom, and magazine editors needed photographers on the ground. To paraphrase the cliché: I was in the right place at the perfect moment.\n\nI've shot for National Geographic Traveler across Australia, Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand, and India — Singapore was the perfect base. I could be ready to go anywhere in Southeast Asia with just a few hours' notice.\n\nMy photography career eventually gave way to something more permanent and corporate, although still rooted in Singapore. I became a content director, producing and directing videos across the region.\n\nIt was a natural evolution for a writer-photographer in a world rapidly shifting to digital content.\n\nBut it has come with a cost. My mother grew older, got sick, moved into a managed care facility, and then passed away suddenly.\n\nI made every effort to visit twice a year, especially in the summer and around Christmas. But there was always a tinge of guilt and remorse that I wasn't there more.\n\nOn one of my last trips back before she died, I remember her saying, \"Haven't you been in Singapore long enough?\" She was always supportive of my choices, but as she approached 80, and her health declined, she wanted me closer to home.\n\nShe was getting the care she needed in the nursing home, but there was no substitute for a visit from me, my presence — complete with stories about my life overseas.\n\nWas I selfish? Perhaps, but I also would never trade the life I have.\n\nProbably, although I'm not sure, because everything is different. I remarried three years ago. I have a 9-year-old daughter from a previous marriage and a toddler son with my wife, Jamie. Both kids have US passports and deserve an American identity and a place to put down roots. They've been to the US to meet their cousins and my oldest friends, but have never had the chance to live there or fully experience life as Americans.\n\nRecently, I told my daughter that she'd visited Manhattan when she was a toddler. Her response: \"Where is that?\" It was a stark realization.\n\nThey should know the country that shaped who I am.\n\nWould I recommend an expat life to someone? Absolutely. I got the life I dreamed of. And despite the challenges and distance, it gave me everything I hoped for when I was that kid, growing up near Buffalo, reading about the rest of the world.\n\nDo you have a story to share about living abroad?

    "fullText": "Dr. Mehmet Oz made the case that improving Americans’ health through better diets could transform both the nation's economy and healthcare spending.\n\nOz, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, connected the dots between improved public health and workforce participation during a White House press conference this week. If Americans could stay healthy enough to work just one additional year beyond the current average retirement age of 61, it would “increase the overall GDP of our nation by trillions of dollars,” he said.\n\n“We will reduce healthcare expenses,” Oz said. “At the same time, we jazz up the U.S. economy with trillions of dollars created by the productivity of American workers.”\n\nFast Company Calls It a ‘Groundbreaking Step for the Creator Economy' — Investors Can Still Get In at $0.85/Share\n\nSam Altman Says AI Will Transform the Economy — This Platform Lets Investors Back Private Tech Early\n\nOz praised the Trump administration's updated dietary guidelines, which encourage Americans to prioritize whole foods, proteins and healthy fats while reducing ultraprocessed food and added sugar.\n\n“The best way to reduce drug spend in America is to not need the drugs in the first place,” he said. He said that new guidelines could cut demand for expensive medications like GLP-1 drugs and autoimmune treatments by helping prevent chronic diseases from developing. “You can’t be a wealthy nation without being a healthy nation,” he said.\n\nHe pointed to data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services showing that roughly 30% of Medicare spending, about $300 billion a year, is directly tied to obesity. “If we were to affect obesity by 10%, which is an incredibly conservative and justifiable assumption… just that alone is $30 billion of reduction of expenses for Medicare,” he said.\n\nTrending: An EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace—Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform Before the Raise Ends 1/19\n\nOz highlighted the importance of reaching children early, saying that 53% of U.S. children are covered by Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program. Programs teaching families how to implement the new dietary guidelines, he said, “will dramatically change the natural history of how children are able to participate in life.”\n\nHealth Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said at the press conference that reducing healthcare costs requires upfront investments in education and access to healthy food. “The idea that a cheap meal made of processed food is cheap is an illusion, because you’re paying for it on the back end,” he said. “You’re paying for it with diabetes, with obesity, with illness.”",

    "title": "Noise sensitivity disrupts the mind, brain and body",
    "description": "Though noise sensitivity is often dismissed by doctors, it can have long-term effects on our mental and physical health.",
    "fullText": "Though noise sensitivity is often dismissed by doctors, it can have long-term effects on our mental and physical health.\n\nTap, tap, tap. Tap, tap, tap. There it was again: the incessant noise from my new upstairs neighbours, evidently still in the process of hanging up pictures or cobbling together new furniture. In my well-insulated building in central Berlin, the noise was well below decibels that would irritate anyone else. But it sent me into a rage.\n\nA tight sensation of stress rushed through my body. Even worse was the anxiety: \"When will they ever be finished?\"\n\nThat's not the only noise that is bothering me. I notice the soft thudding across my ceilings as people get ready for bed. Somewhere in the building, I hear the high-pitched hum of a vacuum cleaner and the muffled thumping of a washing machine. The neighbour's dachshund yapping for a treat. And don't get me started on the leaf blowers and pressure washers outside. Noise – however slight – breaks my concentration and peace of mind.\n\nIt is fair to say that I – along with 10% to 40% of the general population – am noise-sensitive, meaning that I feel more upset and disturbed by noise than the average person. It would be easy to dismiss noise sensitivity as a personality flaw, a symptom of generally being belligerent, whiny, and irritable. But, in recent years, scientists have learned that it has real biological roots. The brains of noise-sensitive people respond differently to sound and some may actually be born that way. What's more, it affects not only people's immediate mood but also their long-term mental and physical health. While there are few easy solutions, being aware of these effects can help noise-sensitive people take action to make their lives more tolerable.\n\n\"It's been one of those what we might call a wastepaper basket sort of issues… that just gets pushed away by health professionals,\" says neuroscientist Daniel Shepherd of Auckland University of Technology in New Zealand. Only in recent years \"have people actually really started to say, right, this is at an experiential level really impacting patients\", he adds. \"We really need to actually start getting a handle on this.\"\n\nNoise sensitivity isn't a formal medical diagnosis. People can find out if they're noise sensitive by taking questionnaires like the 21-question Weinstein's noise sensitivity scale (which asks, for instance, if you're bothered by people whispering and crinkling sweet wrappers in a movie theatre, if you get mad at people making noise when you're trying to sleep or work, even if the sound of music bothers you if you're trying to concentrate.)\n\nNoise sensitivity is different from other sound-related conditions like misophonia. This is a specific decreased tolerance to certain sounds, like chewing, throat-clearing, tapping or ticking, which trigger intense feelings of disgust or rage, explains Jennifer Brout, a clinician and the founder of the US-based International Misophonia Research Network. Noise sensitivity is also different from hyperacusis, where people feel pain or extreme discomfort because they perceive sounds more loudly than they actually are.\n\nNoise sensitivity, by contrast, is a general reactiveness to all sounds, regardless of how loud they're perceived or how loud they actually are. At the very least, noise-sensitive people find sound disruptive and become annoyed, angry, or even fearful or anxious. \"I remember a person describing it like having a mosquito flying around you,\" Shepherd says. \"You just can't not attend to it.\"\n\nFor those who are afraid of noise, the condition might make them so stressed that their bodies go into a fight-or-flight response. \"Your heart rate goes up, your blood pressure goes up,\" says Stephen Stansfeld, a psychiatrist and professor emeritus at Queen Mary University of London.\n\nSleep quality can also take a hit. In one 2021 study, researchers tracked the sleeping patterns of 500 adults in China and nighttime noise levels over the course of a week. They found that, while the noise itself didn't affect people's sleep quality, noise-sensitive individuals tended to find their sleep less restorative, rating their sleep as less refreshing and saying they felt moodier and had less energy during the day.\n\nNoise exposure has also been linked to a range of long-term health effects, including heart disease and diabetes – and noise-sensitive people may suffer the most from  mental health impacts, Stansfeld says. In one 2021 study, Stansfeld and his colleagues surveyed 2,398 men in the Welsh town of Caerphilly who were exposed to different levels of road traffic noise. Those who were noise-sensitive were more likely to have long-term anxiety and depression.\n\nWhile that may be partly because anxious people are more vigilant about their surroundings and therefore more likely to notice noise, it's also possible that being noise sensitive can worsen anxiety. And, one 2023 survey of 1,244 adults living near airports in France found that people severely annoyed by aircraft noise levels – especially some noise-sensitive individuals – were more likely to rate their general health as poor.\n\nBut why do some people react more negatively to noise than others? Studies on the brains of noise-sensitive people reveal some clues. When Shepherd and his colleagues hooked people up to devices that measured the electrical activity in their brains, those without noise sensitivity only showed heightened activity when the researchers played them threatening sounds. But in noise-sensitive people, \"their brains tend to go up the gears irrespective of the sound, whether it's a threatening sound or a non-threatening sound\", Shepherd recalls.\n\nBoth Shepherd and the neuroscientist Elvira Brattico of Denmark's Aarhus University have independently found evidence that this has to do with how the brain filters out information about unimportant sounds. Shepherd's team found evidence that in noise-sensitive people, a specific clump of cells within the medial geniculate nucleus – a relay station for sound information entering the brain – are less efficient at this filtering task compared to the brains of those without the condition.\n\nWhere most people can \"filter this information out and get on with life, those who have noise sensitivity don't do it as easily\", he says. This kind of filtering also seems to be important during sleep. While most people show patterns of electrical activity called spindles as they fall asleep, which are thought to be important in getting used to surrounding noise, people with noise-sensitivity have less of them – helping explain why they stay so reactive to sounds that normal people aren't bothered by.\n\nHow brains end up this way, though, is a mystery. One Finnish study on twins suggests that noise sensitivity is often heritable, so some people might be predisposed to have it from birth. But it's also possible that people living in noisy environments develop sensitivity over time, Brattico says.\n\nPeople with anxiety, schizophrenia and autism are especially likely to develop noise sensitivity. While some people can get it after suffering traumatic brain injuries, for most it's usually something that persists over a lifetime, Stansfeld says. \"It is very difficult, as compared to someone who's not noise-sensitive, to actually habituate to sound and actually desensitise to it.\"\n\nThe ideal solution, of course, would be to tackle the sources of noise themselves. Urban planners could build quiet inner courtyards for residential buildings, use rubberised asphalt ingredients that reduce traffic noise, or erect sound-diffracting walls around highways and noisy areas like highways. Some cities in Belgium and France have already begun implementing such measures, as well as reducing vehicle speed limits, encouraging bike infrastructure and creating quiet zones in parks and along rivers. While noise is a real cause of health problems, \"it's also one which is potentially avoidable\", Stansfeld says.\n\nBut progress is slow, leaving many noise-sensitive people to fend for themselves – for instance by avoiding noisy areas, soundproofing their living spaces or turning to earplugs, earmuffs or noise-cancelling headphones. But these methods often just dampen sounds rather than removing them altogether. \"Even quiet noises might be annoying to a noise-sensitive person,\" Brattico says.\n\n• How traffic noise hurts children's brains\n\n• Why noise pollution is hurting your heart\n\n• The rise of highly sensitive parents\n\nSometimes, treating underlying conditions like anxiety with medications may help, Stansfeld says. Cognitive behavioural therapy, a kind of talking therapy that centres on managing one's psychological reactions and behaviours, can make sense in settings where people are afraid of noise. \"I treated somebody myself with cognitive behaviour therapy, and I think it could be quite helpful,\" Stansfeld says.\n\nMeanwhile, Brattico believes that music therapy with qualified practitioners could also be useful, which involves selecting soothing, soft music that calms people and builds positive associations with sound. For those wanting to try self-soothing, Brattico recommends music with few, soft instruments like piano or harp, such as Renaissance or Baroque chamber music. When even music is annoying, art therapy might help – \"something that's relaxing and allows expressions and regulation of emotions\", Brattico says.\n\nAs for myself, it was earplugs, jazz-playing noise-cancelling headphones and a towel wrapped around my head, that eventually helped somewhat. Until the world around me becomes quieter, I can at least try to find some peace in my own mind.\n\nIf you liked this story, \n\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC,",

    "title": "Elon Musk asked people to upload their medical data to X so his AI company could learn to interpret MRIs and CT scans",
    "description": "Health care experts are worried about Grok’s potential to breach patient privacy.",
    "fullText": "In Elon Musk’s world, AI is the new MD. The X owner is encouraging users to upload their medical test results—such as CT and bone scans—to the platform so that Grok, X’s artificial intelligence chatbot, can learn how to interpret them efficiently.\n\nHe’s previously said this information will be used to train X’s artificial intelligence chatbot Grok on how to interpret them efficiently.\n\nEarlier this month, Elon Musk reposted a video on X of himself talking about uploading medical data to Grok, saying: “Try it!”\n\n“You can upload your X-rays or MRI images to Grok and it will give you a medical diagnosis,” Musk said in the video, which was uploaded in June. “I have seen cases where it’s actually better than what doctors tell you.\n\nIn 2024, Musk said medical images uploaded to Grok would be used to train the bot.\n\n“This is still early stage, but it is already quite accurate and will become extremely good,” Musk wrote on X. “Let us know where Grok gets it right or needs work.”\n\nMusk also claimed in his response Grok saved a man in Norway by diagnosing a problem his doctors failed to notice. The X owner was willing to upload his own medical information to his bot.\n\n“I did an MRI recently and submitted it to Grok,” Musk said in an episode of the Moonshots with Peter Diamandis podcast released on Tuesday. “None of the doctors nor Grok found anything.”\n\nMusk did not disclose in the podcast why he received an MRI. XAI, which owns X, told Fortune in a statement: “Legacy Media Lies.”\n\nGrok is facing some competition in the AI health space. This week OpenAI launched ChatGPT Health, an experience within the bot feature that allows users to securely connect medical records and wellness apps like MyFitnessPal and Apple Health. The company said it would not train the models using personal medical information.\n\nAI chatbots have become a ubiquitous source of medical information for people. OpenAI reported this week 40 million people seek health information from the model, 55% of which used to bot to look up or better understand symptoms.\n\nSo far, Grok’s ability to detect medical abnormalities have been mixed. The AI successfully analyzed blood test results and identified breast cancer, some users claimed. But it also grossly misinterpreted other pieces of information, according to physicians who responded to some of Musk’s about Grok’s ability to interpret medical information. In one instance, Grok mistook a “textbook case” of tuberculosis for a herniated disk or spinal stenosis. In another, the bot mistook a mammogram of a benign breast cyst for an image of testicles.\n\nA May 2025 study found that while all AI models have limitations in processing and predicting medical outcomes, Grok was the most effectively compared to Google’s Gemini and ChatGPT-4o when determining the presence of pathologies in 35,711 slices of brain MRI.\n\n“We know they have the technical capability,” Dr. Laura Heacock, associate professor at the New York University Langone Health Department of Radiology, wrote on X. “Whether or not they want to put in the time, data and [graphics processing units] to include medical imaging is up to them. For now, non-generative AI methods continue to outperform in medical imaging.”\n\nMusk’s lofty goal of training his AI to make medical diagnoses is also a risky one, experts said. While AI has increasingly been used as a means to make complicated science more accessible and create assistive technologies, teaching Grok to use data from a social media platform presents concerns about both Grok’s accuracy and user privacy.\n\nRyan Tarzy, CEO of health technology firm Avandra Imaging, said in an interview with Fast Company asking users to directly input data, rather than source it from secure databases with de-identified patient data, is Musk’s way of trying to accelerate Grok’s development. Also, the information comes from a limited sample of whoever is willing to upload their images and tests—meaning the AI is not gathering data from sources representative of the broader and more diverse medical landscape.\n\nMedical information shared on social media isn’t bound by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), the federal law that protects patients’ private information from being shared without their consent. That means there’s less control over where the information goes after a user chooses to share it.\n\n“This approach has myriad risks, including the accidental sharing of patient identities,” Tarzy said. “Personal health information is ‘burned in’ too many images, such as CT scans, and would inevitably be released in this plan.”\n\nThe privacy dangers Grok may present aren’t fully known because X may have privacy protections not known by the public, according to Matthew McCoy, assistant professor of medical ethics and health policy at the University of Pennsylvania. He said users share medical information at their own risk.\n\n“As an individual user, would I feel comfortable contributing health data?” he previously told the New York Times. “Absolutely not.”\n\nA version of this story originally published on Fortune.com on Nov. 20, 2024.\n\nOpenAI launches ChatGPT Health in a push to become a hub for personal health data\n\nOpenAI suggests ChatGPT play doctor as millions of Americans face spiking insurance costs: ‘In the U.S., ChatGPT has become an important ally’\n\nAs Utah gives the AI power to prescribe some drugs, physicians warn of patient risks\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

    "description": "The German government has sharply rejected accusations by U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. claiming that it has been sidelining patient autonomy, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
    "fullText": "BERLIN (AP) — The German government has sharply rejected accusations by U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. claiming that it has been sidelining patient autonomy, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n“The statements made by the US Secretary of Health are completely unfounded, factually incorrect, and must be rejected,” German Health Minister Nina Warken said in a statement late Saturday.\n\nKennedy said in a video post earlier on Saturday that he had sent the German minister a letter based on reports coming out of Germany that the government was “limiting people’s abilities to act on their own convictions when they face medical decisions.”\n\nThe American health secretary said that “I've learned that more than a thousand German physicians and thousands of their patients now face prosecution and punishment for issuing exemptions from wearing masks or getting COVID-19 vaccines during the pandemic.\"\n\nWarken rejected Kennedy’s claims, saying that “during the coronavirus pandemic, there was never any obligation on the medical profession to administer COVID-19 vaccinations. Anyone who did not want to offer vaccinations for medical, ethical, or personal reasons was not liable to prosecution, nor did they have to fear sanctions.”\n\nKennedy did not give provide specific examples or say which reports he was referring to but added that “in my letter, I explained that Germany is targeting physicians who put their patients first and punishing citizens for making their own medical choices.”\n\nHe concluded that \"the German government is now violating the sacred patient physician relationship, replacing it is a dangerous system that makes physicians enforcers of state policies.”\n\nKennedy said that in his letter he made clear that “Germany has the opportunity and the responsibility to correct this trajectory, to restore medical autonomy, to end politically motivated prosecutions.”\n\nWarken pointed out that there were no professional bans or fines for not getting vaccinated.\n\n“Criminal prosecution was only pursued in cases of fraud and document forgery, such as the issuance of false vaccination certificates or fake mask certificates,\" the minister said.\n\nShe also clarified that in general in Germany “patients are also free to decide which therapy they wish to undergo.”\n\nFormer German Health Minister Karl Lauterbach, who was in charge during the pandemic, also replied, addressing Kennedy directly on X saying that he “should take care of health problems in his own country. Short life expectancy, extreme costs, tens of thousands of drug deaths and murder victims.\"\n\n“In Germany, doctors are not punished by the government for issuing false medical certificates. In our country, the courts are independent,” Lauterbach wrote.\n\nWhile a majority of Germans were eager to get vaccinated against the COVID-19 virus during the pandemic, there were also protests by a small minority of vaccine skeptics in Germany which were sometimes supported by far-right movements.",

    "description": "The new year means new health goals, and for some, that means consuming more protein. I tried 14 high-protein drinks, and some had as much protein as a chicken breast.",
    "fullText": "Cost: $4.99 for 12 fluid ounces\n\nThe taste of the Remedy Organics Cacao Essentials Protein Shake was what I could best describe as healthy.\n\nThe date-sweetened drink is packed with plant-based ingredients, including adaptogens like ashwagandha and maca root powders as well as tapioca prebiotic powder.\n\nBut taste-wise, they weren't as sweet-treat-like as some of the other shakes. It tasted strongly of cacao, but it felt a little chalky, and seemed saltier than it did sweet.\n\nWhile I liked the drink's ingredients, I really disliked the taste. If you're looking for a plant-based, adaptogen-full drink that will also help you reach protein goals, this could be an option for you — but don't go into it expecting a sweet chocolate milk type of drink.\n\nCost: $3.99 for 14 fluid ounces\n\nWhen I first poured the Muscle Milk Zero Sugar shake, I noticed just how dark and thick it was. Tasting it, I found that it was way too sweet for my taste. This, combined with the thick texture, made for a pretty interesting drinking experience — I had to wash down the shake with some water to follow up the sweet taste left in my mouth.\n\nAlthough I couldn't finish drinking the small taste I'd poured myself, it also had the fewest calories and grams of sugar in the ranking, the highest fiber, and I felt like the protein payoff was great, which made the overly sweet taste feel more like a trade-off.\n\nIf you're trying to get half of your daily protein in as few calories as possible while also watching out for sugar content, this drink might be good to have on your radar … but you'll have to remind yourself of the nutrients in every sip.\n\nCost: $4.99 for 12 fluid ounces\n\nCompared to some of the other protein drinks, I found Koia's Cacao Bean protein shake to be very thin and light in color when I first poured it.\n\nIts flavor, as the name would indicate, is very cacao-bean forward. To me, it tasted exactly like cacao nibs, which can lean more nutty and earthy than chocolate-y.\n\nIn a statement to Business Insider, Koia said the Cacao Bean protein shake is \"crafted to highlight cacao's naturally bold, slightly bitter profile rather than masking it with excessive sweetness or artificial flavoring,\" resulting in a flavor that \"may be less sweet than traditional protein shakes.\"\n\nThe almond-based, monk-fruit-sweetened drink, which isn't too sweet and packs in plant-based ingredients like rice, pea, and chickpea protein and a prebiotic blend, wasn't one of my favorites for taste, although it was fairly competitive with the other options in terms of nutrients.\n\nCost: $2.00 for 11 fluid ounces\n\nI found the flavor of the chocolate Sport Shake to be one of the most enjoyable in the ranking, and it reminded me a lot of plain chocolate milk — it was very, very sweet. I also liked that it didn't taste too much like dairy, something that bothered me with other drinks in the lineup.\n\nHowever, the drink's sweet and tasty flavor was overshadowed by its ultra-high added sugar content of 39 grams, or more than 9 teaspoons.\n\nWhile the drink has some fiber in it, coming in with 3 grams, and it was the cheapest of the ranking, I couldn't justify that much sugar. I will probably not reach for this again.\n\nCost: $2.50 for 14 fluid ounces\n\nI was shocked when I learned that Nesquik's classic chocolate milk could be considered a nutritional drink.\n\nAt 14 grams of protein, as advertised on the bottle, the drink has more grams of protein per serving than other drinks labeled as protein drinks.\n\nTasting it was just as nostalgic as expected. Compared to some of the other drinks, however, I noticed it had a stronger dairy taste and was very sweet, with a total of 18 grams of added sugar.\n\nI also noticed that the bottle recommended a portion of half a bottle, probably due to the drink's high sugar content, which would also result in half the protein intake overall.\n\nI probably wouldn't have reached for this in adulthood if not to compare it here, and I probably won't really reach for it again.\n\nCost: $5.99 for 14 fluid ounces\n\nLike its low-sugar version, the Muscle Milk Pro looked dark and thick. Taste-wise, the drink was sweeter than chocolate-y, and I didn't love the flavor.\n\nAlthough the drink packs an impressive 40 grams of protein in 14 ounces and 220 calories, has the highest ratio of protein to fluid ounces, and also has the highest fiber content in the list, the taste was one of my least favorites, and I had to wash it down with some water after tasting, as it had such a lingering flavor on the tongue.\n\nWhen considering the nutritional aspects of the drink, however, I felt like the taste was a solid trade-off for one of the most protein-efficient drinks in the ranking, having the second-highest amount of grams of protein in a single bottle.\n\nBut if you're strictly going for the ultra-high-protein option, the Fairlife Core Power Elite — which comes later in this ranking — might be a better bet for flavor.\n\nCost: $4.49 for 12 fluid ounces\n\nWhen I first poured the OWYN — which stands for Only What You Need — Pro Elite Protein Shake, it looked much thicker than some of the other drinks in the ranking.\n\nIt tasted vastly different from the others, too. The ingredients gave some clues as to why: The main ingredients — water, pea protein, pumpkin protein, and flaxseed oil — were completely different from the other shakes.\n\nThe plant-based, dairy-, soy-, and wheat-free drink, which contains 3 grams of prebiotics, uses monk fruit extract to sweeten its cocoa-heavy flavor, and also has a greens blend that includes spinach, kale, and broccoli.\n\nI figured that the odd flavor I experienced was perhaps due to some of its most health-forward ingredients, like the greens blend.\n\nIn a statement to Business Insider, OWYN said that the exclusion of artificial sweeteners and sugar alcohols in the formula \"sometimes means a more natural, earthy taste profile,\" when compared to their regular shake, which uses a blend of organic cane sugar and monk fruit.\n\nUltimately, I wasn't a fan of the taste and probably wouldn't reach for this drink again, although nutrition-wise, it was a solid ultra-high-protein plant-based option.\n\nCost: $5.99 for 14 fluid ounces\n\nOne of three protein shakes in Fairlife's line, the Core Power Elite shake was a bit thinner than many of the other drinks I tried.\n\nIt was less sweet than Fairlife's regular chocolate milk, which I didn't mind. However, it had a much stronger dairy taste — I don't love the taste of dairy milk, so this worked against the drink for me.\n\nStill, its insane amount of protein — as much as a whole chicken breast — earned it extra points in my ranking.\n\nThis drink was something I didn't mind drinking, even if I wouldn't usually go for it. Even as a non-gym-bro, I would probably reach for this drink if I were trying to get well over half of my needed protein for the day in a single serving.\n\nCost: $2.50 for 11 fluid ounces\n\nWhen I poured the chocolate Nutrament, I noticed its consistency was among the runniest in the ranking.\n\nThe drink, the second-cheapest drink in the lineup, tasted just like chocolate milk, although it was still a bit too sweet for me.\n\nI also noticed it had a long ingredients list with many unfamiliar terms, but on closer inspection, some seemed to be added vitamins and minerals. The drink also had the second-highest added sugar content at 29 grams.\n\nThe high sugar and comparatively low protein knocked this drink down a few points for me, and although I enjoyed it, I probably wouldn't reach for this.\n\nCost: $3.29 for 14 fluid ounces\n\nThe second in Fairlife's line, its chocolate ultra-filtered milk, was another nostalgic offering.\n\nIt was very sweet, but if I were craving chocolate milk, this is definitely the option I would choose.\n\nWhile it's not marketed as a protein drink, it contains 23 grams in a 14-ounce bottle and has the second-lowest cost per gram of protein.\n\nCost: $18.99 for a six-pack of 8-ounce bottles (or $3.17 for 8 fluid ounces)\n\nWhile some of the drinks in this lineup are aimed at the ultra-protein-efficient crowd and others are more directed at children, the Boost nutritional drink line is marketed toward adults with specific nutritional needs. The Boost Plus product, specifically, is aimed at adults hoping to gain or maintain weight.\n\nTaste-wise, this was one of my favorites. The sweet and rich drink was very chocolatey, and it felt like a nice sweet treat.\n\nWith the product's purpose in mind, the drink's higher calories didn't bother me, and I was pleased to see its nutrition label flooded with vitamins and minerals.\n\nOut of many of the options, this is one I could see myself reaching for solely based on its taste, even though I wish it had a higher protein content.\n\nCost: $3.00 for 14 fluid ounces\n\nWhen I poured this drink, I was surprised by how runny it was compared to some of the other options. I really enjoyed the taste, even if it wasn't exactly the same as the nostalgic chocolate-milk flavor of Nesquik's classic option.\n\nIn fact, I actually liked this one more, even before factoring in the added nutritional value. It was adequately sweet, not too dairy-tasting, and it didn't have the aftertaste that had put me off the classic option.\n\nWith 23 grams of protein, this drink could compete with some of its more nutrition-leaning counterparts. At $3 for a bottle, it was also one of the cheapest options with the highest protein content.\n\nI could totally see myself reaching for this.\n\nCost: $4.29 for 12 fluid ounces\n\nCompared to the higher-protein drink on OWYN's line, the regular protein shake wasn't as dark or as thick when I poured it.\n\nWhile the OWYN Pro Elite had a taste I didn't like, the OWYN Dark Chocolate Protein Shake had a simpler flavor that reminded me of chocolate milk.\n\nIt was very tasty and chocolatey, and I liked that it also had 3 grams of fiber.\n\nOverall, this felt like a very solid option that I could see myself reaching for. It was also my favorite plant-based drink.\n\nCost: $4.99 for 14 fluid ounces\n\nWhile this drink didn't exactly feel like a dessert or chocolate milk since it leaned more chocolatey and cocoa-tasting than sweet — and it did have somewhat of a dairy taste — I still found it very enjoyable and a very nice pick for both taste and protein.\n\nTied with the Muscle Milk Zero Sugar for the lowest calories in the ranking, I found the Fairlife Core Power shake much more enjoyable and even winning by a gram in the protein category.\n\nOverall, this drink had the best balance between flavor and nutrition, and I can see myself reaching for it whenever I need a quick post-workout pick-me-up or just want to get a significant portion of my daily protein on the go.",

    "description": "Could a turmeric supplement be the missing piece to your wellness puzzle, or is it just another health trend?",
    "fullText": "Reviewed by Dietitian Maria Laura Haddad-Garcia\n\nTurmeric may help reduce inflammation and joint pain, and it may support heart and gut health.\n\nSafe intake of turmeric supplements is considered up to 8 g, but long-term effects are unknown.\n\nPossible side effects include nausea, diarrhea, liver injury and medication interactions.\n\nIf you’re exploring ways to spice up your wellness routine, chances are turmeric supplements have caught your attention. Praised for their ability to stamp out inflammation, these golden capsules have become popular among those seeking natural ways to support their health. Turmeric supplements are often formulated with enhanced absorption and a higher concentration of potent compounds than what you’d find in the spice you’d typically use in cooking. But do they really live up to their claims?\n\nWe spoke with registered dietitians to break down the benefits, potential risks and what you should know before adding turmeric supplements to your daily regimen.\n\nTurmeric is a golden-yellow spice that comes from the root of the Curcuma longa plant, native to Southeast Asia. With its distinctively warm and earthy flavor, turmeric has been used as a culinary spice and traditional medicine for thousands of years.\n\nIt’s particularly valued for its beneficial compounds. Most notably, turmeric contains active compounds called curcuminoids that have been isolated and studied for their positive effects on the body, says Meghan Pendleton, M.S., RD, a registered dietitian. Within the class of curcuminoids, curcumin is commonly promoted as a beneficial supplement for a myriad of health conditions, as outlined below.\n\nWhile short-term inflammation is a natural and necessary part of the body’s healing process, prolonged inflammation (aka chronic inflammation) can contribute to the onset of chronic conditions. Among natural remedies, turmeric is widely recognized for its ability to combat inflammation. “Its active compound, curcumin, is the driving force behind its anti-inflammatory effects,” says Emily Niswanger, M.S., RDN, a functional registered dietitian. Curcumin supplements have been shown to reduce inflammation by suppressing the pathways that lead to an inflammatory response, Niswanger explains. She adds that curcumin also functions as an antioxidant, helping to clear free radicals from the body that damage healthy cells and tissues.\n\nTurmeric’s anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties have also been shown to alleviate joint pain. “Curcumin can reduce joint pain and stiffness by inhibiting inflammatory pathways, such as cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), which are often overactive in arthritis,” says Erin Kenney, M.S., RDN, a registered dietitian. She emphasizes that studies have shown that turmeric supplementation can be as effective as some nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in relieving osteoarthritis symptoms without the associated side effects, such as indigestion, constipation, drowsiness and dizziness. However, more high-quality research is needed to confirm its effectiveness and determine the optimal dosage for relieving joint pain.\n\nThe curcumin in this golden spice may even boost your heart health. “Curcumin helps reduce systemic inflammation, oxidative stress and LDL cholesterol oxidation, all of which contribute to heart disease,” says Kenney. She highlights that it also improves endothelial function, which supports healthy blood vessel function and circulation. Some research suggests that turmeric supplements may help lower systolic blood pressure when taken for more than 12 weeks. However, no impact has been observed for diastolic blood pressure, says Niswanger. As a reference, systolic blood pressure is the upper number in your blood pressure measurement, whereas diastolic blood pressure is the lower number. While these findings are encouraging, additional research is needed to fully understand the long-term impact of turmeric supplements on heart health.\n\nThe benefits of turmeric supplements may also extend to the gut. “Due to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, curcumin can help reduce inflammation in the gut, potentially benefiting conditions like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD),” says Kenney. She explains that curcumin may also promote a balanced gut microbiome by encouraging the growth of beneficial bacteria and reducing harmful ones. Additionally, she notes that it may support bile production, which is required for fat digestion and overall digestive health.\n\nPendleton says protecting the brain from inflammation and oxidative damage is crucial for maintaining cognitive function, as both are closely linked to the development of neurodegenerative diseases. Curcumin has shown potential in several studies for reducing these harmful processes and improving cognitive outcomes in people with Alzheimer’s disease. However, Pendleton highlights that, while these results are promising, more long-term human studies are needed to fully assess turmeric’s impact on chronic neurological conditions.\n\nWhile curcumin, the active ingredient in turmeric, is generally safe at doses up to 8 grams, it does come with risks. Kenney notes that some individuals may experience common gastrointestinal side effects, including nausea, diarrhea and bloating. Additionally, turmeric supplements may interfere with iron absorption, particularly affecting those with iron-deficiency anemia, explains Pendleton.\n\nRare but serious side effects, such as liver injury, have been reported in case studies involving high-potency curcumin supplements, says Niswanger. Fortunately, symptoms of liver toxicity typically resolve once supplementation is discontinued. Kidney issues, including an increased risk of kidney stones, have also been linked to turmeric supplements.\n\nThe lack of standardized formulations in turmeric supplements raises concerns about quality and safety. Pendleton says that without chemical analysis of every batch, it’s difficult to know the precise composition of the product you’re taking. She adds that contamination with heavy metals, stemming from the soil in which turmeric is grown, is another potential risk due to inadequate safety testing.\n\nWhile some people may benefit from taking turmeric supplements, others may need to avoid them. “Caution is advised for individuals with gallbladder issues, bleeding disorders, kidney stones, or hormone-sensitive conditions,” says Kenney. Pregnant and breastfeeding individuals should avoid high-dose turmeric supplements, as their safety has not been adequately studied in these groups. In addition, people taking certain medications such as blood thinners, antidiabetics, antacids, immunosuppressants and hormone therapies should consult a health care provider before supplementing with turmeric due to potential adverse interactions.\n\nWhen choosing the ideal turmeric supplement, Niswanger recommends sourcing it from a reputable company that performs independent verification. This ensures the supplement is free from high contaminants and contains the ingredients and dosages stated on the label.\n\nFor better absorption and enhanced effectiveness, Kenney suggests choosing a turmeric supplement that contains black pepper extract (piperine)—unless contraindicated. She also recommends taking it with a meal that contains healthy fats to further boost absorption and maximize its benefits.\n\nTurmeric supplements offer a convenient and concentrated way to tap into the potential benefits of curcumin, particularly in reducing inflammation and oxidative stress. While research is promising for conditions like joint pain, heart disease, IBS and Alzheimer’s, more research is needed to confirm its effectiveness. As with any supplement, it’s important to consult a health care provider to discuss your unique medical history, potential side effects and medication interactions associated with taking turmeric. “Turmeric is much safer and more delicious eaten as a whole spice versus a highly concentrated supplement form,” says Pendleton. However, if you do choose to take a turmeric supplement, it’s important to ensure it fits into a well-balanced dietary regimen.\n\nIs it good to take turmeric every day?\n\nTaking a turmeric supplement is considered safe at doses up to 8 grams. However, more research is needed on its long-term use. Before incorporating new supplements into your daily routine, you should always consult your health care provider to discuss potential medication interactions and side effects.\n\nCan turmeric burn abdominal fat?\n\nLimited research suggests that turmeric’s bioactive compound, curcumin, may indirectly support weight management by reducing inflammation and oxidative stress and by improving metabolic health. However, research on this topic is fairly new, with limited studies directly linking turmeric supplements to lower abdominal fat.\n\nWhat organs benefit from turmeric?\n\nResearch suggests that turmeric can benefit several organs, including the heart, joints, gastrointestinal tract and brain. However, more studies are needed before definitive conclusions can be drawn.\n\nWhat cannot be mixed with turmeric?\n\nPeople who take medications like blood thinners, antidiabetics, antacids, immunosuppressants and hormone therapies should avoid taking a turmeric supplement. Combining turmeric with these medications can interfere with their effectiveness or cause adverse side effects. Therefore, it’s always best to consult your health care provider and err on the side of caution when taking herbal and conventional medicines.",

    "fullText": "Exclusive: Guardian investigation finds AI Overviews provided inaccurate and false information when queried over blood tests\n\nGoogle has removed some of its artificial intelligence health summaries after a Guardian investigation found people were being put at risk of harm by false and misleading information.\n\nThe company has said its AI Overviews, which use generative AI to provide snapshots of essential information about a topic or question, are “helpful” and “reliable”.\n\nBut some of the summaries, which appear at the top of search results, served up inaccurate health information, putting users at risk of harm.\n\nIn one case that experts described as “dangerous” and “alarming”, Google provided bogus information about crucial liver function tests that could leave people with serious liver disease wrongly thinking they were healthy.\n\nTyping “what is the normal range for liver blood tests” served up masses of numbers, little context and no accounting for nationality, sex, ethnicity or age of patients, the Guardian found.\n\nWhat Google’s AI Overviews said was normal may vary drastically from what was actually considered normal, experts said. The summaries could lead to seriously ill patients wrongly thinking they had a normal test result, and not bother to attend follow-up healthcare meetings.\n\nAfter the investigation, the company has removed AI Overviews for the search terms “what is the normal range for liver blood tests” and “what is the normal range for liver function tests”.\n\nA Google spokesperson said: “We do not comment on individual removals within Search. In cases where AI Overviews miss some context, we work to make broad improvements, and we also take action under our policies where appropriate.”\n\nVanessa Hebditch, the director of communications and policy at the British Liver Trust, a liver health charity, said: “This is excellent news, and we’re pleased to see the removal of the Google AI Overviews in these instances.\n\n“However, if the question is asked in a different way, a potentially misleading AI Overview may still be given and we remain concerned other AI‑produced health information can be inaccurate and confusing.”\n\nThe Guardian found that typing slight variations of the original queries into Google, such as “lft reference range” or “lft test reference range”, prompted AI Overviews. That was a big worry, Hebditch said.\n\n“A liver function test or LFT is a collection of different blood tests. Understanding the results and what to do next is complex and involves a lot more than comparing a set of numbers.\n\n“But the AI Overviews present a list of tests in bold, making it very easy for readers to miss that these numbers might not even be the right ones for their test.\n\n“In addition, the AI Overviews fail to warn that someone can get normal results for these tests when they have serious liver disease and need further medical care. This false reassurance could be very harmful.”\n\nGoogle, which has a 91% share of the global search engine market, said it was reviewing the new examples provided to it by the Guardian.\n\nHebditch said: “Our bigger concern with all this is that it is nit-picking a single search result and Google can just shut off the AI Overviews for that but it’s not tackling the bigger issue of AI Overviews for health.”\n\nSue Farrington, the chair of the Patient Information Forum, which promotes evidence-based health information to patients, the public and healthcare professionals, welcomed the removal of the summaries but said she still had concerns.\n\n“This is a good result but it is only the very first step in what is needed to maintain trust in Google’s health-related search results. There are still too many examples out there of Google AI Overviews giving people inaccurate health information.”\n\nMillions of adults worldwide already struggle to access trusted health information, Farrington said. “That’s why it is so important that Google signposts people to robust, researched health information and offers of care from trusted health organisations.”\n\nAI Overviews still pop up for other examples the Guardian originally highlighted to Google. They include summaries of information about cancer and mental health that experts described as “completely wrong” and “really dangerous”.\n\nAsked why these AI Overviews had not also been removed, Google said they linked to well-known and reputable sources, and informed people when it was important to seek out expert advice.\n\nA spokesperson said: “Our internal team of clinicians reviewed what’s been shared with us and found that in many instances, the information was not inaccurate and was also supported by high quality websites.”\n\nVictor Tangermann, a senior editor at the technology website Futurism, said the results of the Guardian’s investigation showed Google had work to do “to ensure that its AI tool isn’t dispensing dangerous health misinformation”.\n\nIf you have something to share about this story, you can contact Andrew using one of the following methods.\n\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

The company constantly measures and reviews the quality of its summaries across many different categories of information, it added.\n\nIn an article for Search Engine Journal, senior writer Matt Southern said: “AI Overviews appear above ranked results. When the topic is health, errors carry more weight.”",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — For House Republicans, the political year started with a pep rally of sorts as President Donald Trump gathered them at Washington's Kennedy Center for a stemwinder of a speech. But by the time lawmakers had completed their first week of work this midterm election year, fractures in the party were already showing.\n\nFrom pushback to Trump's self-described “Donroe doctrine” of aggression in the Western Hemisphere to breaks in party unity over health care, Republican lawmakers are displaying signs of independence from Trump after spending much of the last year acquiescing to his practically every demand. It showed a new dynamic in the GOP as Republicans embark on difficult campaign to keep control of both the House and Senate.\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune, speaking at the U.S.-Mexico border Friday with a group of Republican Senate candidates, said that Republicans were “going to be focused like a laser” on issues of affordability and pointed to legislation in the works on housing and health care.\n\nThune's border trip and talk of affordability were a nod back to some of the core themes of Trump's presidential campaign. But the focus in Washington of late has instead been dominated by Trump's military operation to capture Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro, his threats to use military force to take control of Greenland, the release of case files on Jeffrey Epstein and a debate over extending subsidies for insurance offered under the Affordable Care Act — an issue where Republicans have long struggled to find unity.\n\nRecent shootings by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers in several U.S. cities, including one that killed a woman in Minneapolis, have also raised new questions about Republicans' hard-line immigration agenda and shifted attention away from Trump's handling of the border, which they see as a political success.\n\nEven so, Trump still has plenty of command over most of the party. That was demonstrated this week by a pair of unsuccessful House veto override votes in which most GOP members stuck with the president despite previously voting for the low-profile bills.\n\nRep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican who has been one of the few Republicans to consistently defy Trump, said that “there was some bully pulpit intimidation going on” from the president that caused the veto overrides to fail.\n\nStill, Democrats are making the case that Trump is becoming distracted from the needs of Americans, especially after the attack on Venezuela.\n\n“He's lurching towards another endless, expensive war, all the while American families here are struggling with skyrocketing costs,” said Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer.\n\nVenezuela war powers vote draws GOP support\n\nTo prove their point, Democrats are forcing votes on war powers resolutions that would stop Trump from attacking Venezuela without congressional approval. Such measures are rarely successful, but a procedural vote on the legislation drew support from five Republicans Thursday, setting up a final vote next week. House Democrats are also pushing forward a similar resolution.\n\nThe GOP senators who voted for the legislation tried to defuse the conflict with Trump by arguing their positions were in line with his own campaign promises to scale back U.S. commitments overseas.\n\n“A drawn-out campaign in Venezuela involving the American military, even if unintended, would be the opposite of President Trump’s goal of ending foreign entanglements,” Sen. Todd Young, an Indiana Republican who voted for the war powers resolution, said in a lengthy statement explaining his vote.\n\nTrump reacted with fury. The president promptly called for the five Republicans, which included Maine Sen. Susan Collins, who is up for reelection this year, to “never be elected to office again.”\n\nRepublicans are already dealing with retirements from several lawmakers who had uneasy relationships with Trump, and there was worry that such clashes could complicate their campaign picture even more.\n\n“If Susan isn’t the senator from Maine, we’re going to end up with a Democrat,” said Sen. Bernie Moreno, an Ohio Republican. “That would be 10 times worse. But I do appreciate that President Trump is absolutely pissed off.”\n\nGOP pushes back on Trump's Greenland plans\n\nTrump's desire to possess Greenland and his administration's decision not to rule out military force also met significant resistance from GOP lawmakers this week.\n\nSen. Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican who is retiring after crossing Trump last summer, took to the Senate floor to proclaim that he was “sick of stupid.” He specifically criticized White House deputy chief of policy Stephen Miller, who made comments that Greenland should be part of the U.S.\n\n“I want good advice for this president, because I want this president to have a good legacy,” Tillis added. “And this nonsense on what’s going on with Greenland is a distraction from the good work he’s doing, and the amateurs who said it was a good idea should lose their jobs.”\n\nOther Republicans, including Thune and Senate Armed Services Committee chair Sen. Roger Wicker, also gently pushed back on military threats against Denmark, which is a NATO ally of the U.S.\n\nAfter meeting with the Danish ambassador, Wicker said it was Denmark's right not to sell Greenland.\n\n“I’m troubled by Greenland. I'm troubled by some of the things he does. I don’t get it,” said Nebraska Rep. Don Bacon, another retiring Republican. “I do feel like Congress should be more independent and should provide checks and balances here.”\n\nBacon added that Trump still had the ability to “bully” his Republican colleagues, but that Trump's threats had “stiffened my spine.”\n\nHealth care votes expose divisions\n\nDuring Trump's speech at the Kennedy Center on Tuesday, he urged Republicans to own the issue of health care. Yet when the House voted Thursday on a Democratic proposal to extend expired health care subsidies for Affordable Care Act health plans, 17 Republicans broke with party leadership to help pass the bill.\n\n“People recognize the challenge here, which is to address health care affordability,” said Rep. Mike Lawler, a New York Republican who voted for the proposal.\n\nHe still criticized the Affordable Care Act, a hallmark piece of legislation for Democrats, yet the health care debate unfolding in Congress is one that Democrats feel confident making a central campaign issue.\n\n“In this first, full week of the new year, House Democrats — every single one of us joined by 17 Republicans — have partnered in a bipartisan way to protect the health care of the American people,” said House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries following the vote.\n\nJan. 6 plaque coming out of storage\n\nOn the fifth anniversary of the attack on the Capitol, Trump told House Republicans that he had told his supporters to go “peacefully and patriotically” to confront Congress from certifying the 2020 presidential election. The White House also unveiled a website that portrayed the Jan. 6 attack as a “witch hunt” against him by Democrats and some Republicans in Congress.\n\nBut the Senate, which Republicans control, this week agreed to display a plaque honoring the police who defended the Capitol — a cause that has become a point of contention with Trump as president. The plaque had been kept in storage rather than being displayed because House Speaker Mike Johnson had said the memorial did not comply with the law.\n\nIt was Tillis again who pushed the issue on the Republican side. He said it was important to honor the police and staff who risked their own lives and safety that day.\n\nDemocrats who joined in the effort said they were alarmed by the White House's attempt to recast the narrative.\n\n“It's so important we be honest with the American people about what happened,” said Sen. Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat.\n\nThis story has corrected the party affiliation of Rep. Mike Lawler. He is a Republican, not a Democrat.",

    "description": "Experts are urging guideline changes on what health professionals should wear to protect against flu-like illnesses including Covid",
    "fullText": "Experts are urging guideline changes on what health professionals should wear to protect against flu-like illnesses including Covid\n\nSurgical face masks provide inadequate protection against flu-like illnesses including Covid, and should be replaced by respirator-level masks – worn every time doctors and nurses are face to face with a patient, according to a group of experts urging changes to World Health Organization guidelines.\n\nThere is “no rational justification remaining for prioritising or using” the surgical masks that are ubiquitous in hospitals and clinics globally, given their “inadequate protection against airborne pathogens”, they said in a letter to WHO chief Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.\n\n“There is even less justification for allowing healthcare workers to wear no face covering at all,” they said.\n\nAt the height of the Covid pandemic an estimated 129bn disposable face masks were being used around the world every month, by the public and healthcare workers, with surgical masks the most widely available and recommended by most health authorities.\n\nRespirators designed to filter tiny particles – such as masks meeting FFP2/3 standards in the UK or N95 in the US – should instead be standard practice for medical interactions, they said.\n\nAs additional evidence emerged over the course of the pandemic, officials in many countries switched to recommending those masks as more effective.\n\nThe proposals would result in fewer infections in patients and health professionals, and reduce rates of sickness, absence and burnout in the health workforce, the authors contended.\n\nProf Adam Finkel of the University of Michigan School of Public Health, one of the letter’s organisers, said surgical masks were not designed to stop airborne pathogens but “invented to stop doctors and nurses from sneezing into the guts and the hearts of patients”.\n\nSurgical masks are to respirators what the typewriter was to the modern computer, said Finkel, who was chief regulatory official at the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration between 1995 and 2000: “Obsolete.”\n\nThe letter came out of discussions at an online conference organised last year called Unpolitics, looking at the implementation of evidence-based policies. It was authored by seven clinicians and scientists, including Finkel, and has been endorsed by almost 50 senior clinicians and researchers, and more than 2,000 members of the public, including clinically vulnerable patients.\n\nThere could be “off-ramps”, where governments or establishments decide respirators are not necessary, based on factors such as community infection rates, and ventilation or air filtration devices in a room, the letter says.\n\nWhile the suggested guidance would apply only in healthcare settings, where the risk of infection is higher, it is likely to provoke controversy. Face masks became a culture war issue during the Covid pandemic.\n\nIn December, Tory leader Kemi Badenoch said she had been “slightly traumatised by all the mask wearing that we had to do during Covid” in response to comments by an NHS leader saying people with flu symptoms “must wear” a face mask in public.\n\nThe WHO cannot mandate global policies, but the signatories argue that an update to its infection prevention and control guidelines to recommend respirators could have a profound impact.\n\nThey also suggest that the WHO’s procurement infrastructure could help increase access to respirators even in poorer countries, with production of surgical masks phased down over time.\n\nSurgical masks are still “better than nothing”, Finkel conceded, with studies suggesting they block approximately 40% of Covid-sized particles in the air, compared with approximately 80% (and up to 98%) for respirators.\n\nHe says the comparative reduction in risk can be thought of like falling off a wall of four inches rather than four feet: “You can still trip and break an ankle at four inches, but you’re much better off.”\n\nCritics of the group’s arguments point to a lack of randomised controlled trials showing that physical measures slow the spread of respiratory viruses. Finkel and the other authors say such trials are inherently flawed and misleading, for example because people in a trial will not wear masks 24/7 and could be exposed to pathogens while unmasked.\n\nInstead they say physical tests showing that respirators stop particles, conducted in laboratories, offer sufficient evidence.\n\nThe WHO has been criticised for being slow to describe Covid-19 as spreading via “airborne” particles and the letter also calls for it to revisit earlier statements and “unambiguously inform the public that it spreads via airborne respiratory particles”.\n\nProf Trisha Greenhalgh of the University of Oxford, whose research is cited extensively in the letter and is one of its signatories, said: “A germ that does not get inside someone cannot make them sick. By sealing against the face, respirators force airflow to pass through them, filtering out the airborne germs. Respirators are designed to fit closely around the face and meet high filtration standards. Medical masks, in contrast, fit loosely and leak extensively.”\n\nThe letter’s supporters include members of the World Health Network, prominent US epidemiologist Eric Feigl-Ding, and Guardian columnist George Monbiot.\n\nA WHO spokesperson said the letter required “careful review”. They said the organisation consulted widely with experts from different health and economic contexts when producing guidance on personal protective equipment for health workers, adding: “We are currently reviewing WHO’s Infection Prevention and Control guidelines for epidemic and pandemic-prone acute respiratory infections, based on the latest scientific evidence to ensure protection of health workers.”",

    "fullText": "Australians have been experiencing an uptick in a serious mosquito-borne virus, according to ABC.\n\nA case of Japanese encephalitis virus has been identified north-west of Melbourne. The virus was found in a mosquito trap installed in the western community of Horsham by monitoring personnel. This is the first case of the Australian summer, following an original outbreak of the virus in 2022.\n\nThe Japanese encephalitis virus is spread by mosquitoes and can cause fever, vomiting, and seizures. Once in roughly every 250 cases, the virus causes severe inflammation of the brain, which can be fatal. Luckily, most people who contract it experience either mild symptoms or no symptoms whatsoever.\n\nAustralian researchers have previously identified pig farms as major vectors for the Japanese encephalitis virus.\n\nThanks to increased global heat and precipitation due to atmospheric pollution, mosquito populations have been spiking. Along with them have been the viruses they carry. This includes Zika, dengue, and West Nile virus.\n\nResearchers have been busy trying to find new ways to manage explosions of mosquito populations. Some have found that soap can immobilize them without resorting to indiscriminate insecticides. Others have found promising results in a new kind of fungus.\n\nAttacking the root of the issue will require lowering pollution in major sectors such as agriculture, electricity, and transportation. This can stabilize weather patterns and slow the spread of disease-carrying mosquitoes.\n\nWhile up-to-date vaccines are the best front-line defence, Australian authorities suggested a range of precautions to avoid Japanese encephalitis virus infections. These included the use of bug spray, covering up with light-colored clothing, and dismantling stagnant water pools around the home.\n\n\"Anyone can be bitten by mosquitoes, but people living, working or spending time outdoors in northern Victoria — especially near rivers — may be at higher risk,\" said Victoria's chief health officer Caroline McElnay, per ABC.\n\nHow bad are the mosquitoes in your area?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": "Jennifer Aniston, 56, sticks to an 80/20 diet that leaves room for the occasional cheeseburger and fries — and Demi Moore, 63, says she still drinks Red Bull.",
    "fullText": "If there's one question celebrities over 50 never stop getting asked, it's how they stay healthy.\n\nEven interviews meant to promote a new movie, book, or company launch often veer into questions about health and diet.\n\nAfter a while, the answers start to sound familiar.\n\nFrom regular exercise to the morning routines they refuse to skip, the same six habits keep coming up.\n\nAt 100, Dick Van Dyke still hits the gym three days a week. He credits regular exercise with helping him live a long life, and while most people his age aren't exactly itching to work out, he said he can still \"move pretty well.\"\n\nHe is one of several celebrities who say age is no excuse for not being active. Helen Mirren, 80, has long been a fan of a 12-minute military workout developed by the Royal Canadian Air Force in the 1950s — and it remains her go-to.\n\nThey also tend to stick with what works rather than constantly changing routines. Both Martha Stewart, 84, and Jane Fonda, 88, say they've been doing the same exercises for years.\n\n\"I essentially do everything I used to do, just slower,\" Fonda said.\n\nMatt Damon, 55, said cutting gluten helped him slim down to 167 pounds for his latest film, a number he hadn't seen since high school.\n\nHe's not the only one who's made small but intentional changes to his diet. Alex Rodriguez, 50, has dramatically reduced how often he eats meat, and Al Roker, 71, said he's done the same.\n\nBut that doesn't mean they deprive themselves of the foods they enjoy.\n\n\"Moderation rather than deprivation is better in the long run,\" Roker said. \"If you deprive yourself of stuff that you like, eventually you're going to snap and go crazy.\"\n\nJennifer Aniston, 56, takes a similar approach, sticking to an 80/20 rule that leaves room for the foods she actually enjoys, such as a cheeseburger and fries.\n\nEven Demi Moore, 63, who sticks to a meat-free, nutrient-dense diet, can't give up her one guilty pleasure.\n\n\"I mean, I'm not perfect. I still do drink Red Bull. I do love it. But not many. One,\" Moore said.\n\nGetting older isn't something many of them seem preoccupied with. If anything, it's given them more confidence.\n\nFor Jodi Foster, turning 60 marked a turning point after she spent her 50s feeling like she couldn't compete with her younger self.\n\n\"Everything changed. I was like, 'Yeah, I don't care. I'm no longer tortured by any of this. I don't know why I seemed to care so much,'\" Foster said.\n\nSimilarly, Elizabeth Banks, 51, said she approaches aging with a positive mindset. She's happy to let age happen, rather than try to fight it. That goes for Linda Hamilton, 69, as well.\n\n\"I do not spend a moment trying to look younger on any level, ever. I have just completely surrendered to the fact that this is the face that I've earned,\" Hamilton said.\n\nFor both Nicole Kidman, 58, and Melinda French Gates, 61, aging has come with freedom from other people's opinions and a deeper respect for the experiences they've accumulated along the way.\n\n\"Like if I'm not your cup of tea, that's OK,\" French Gates said.\n\nAt this stage in life, many agree that time must be spent intentionally.\n\nKate Winslet said hitting 50 made her reevaluate her definition of success.\n\n\"Success, actually, for me more these days is more about pulling it off, being a decent person. You know, being able to take care of people, having time for friends, also learning how to be OK with not being busy all the time,\" Winslet said.\n\nShe's not the only celebrity who's said that milestone birthdays sparked similar periods of reflection.\n\nBoth Jane Fonda, 88, and Michelle Obama, 61, said that turning 60 was a pivotal moment that made them consider how they wanted to spend the rest of their lives.\n\n\"If I'm lucky, I live to 90 and that's 30 good summers,\" Obama said.\n\nFor Mary Steenburgen, 72, aging has also made her more selective about who she chooses to spend time with.\n\n\"With not wasting time on people that aren't in my life for the right reason, for being honest with myself about life,\" Steenburgen said.\n\nSlowing down also doesn't seem to be top of mind for many of them.\n\nKris Jenner, 70, has been clear she's not thinking about retirement just yet — and neither are Vera Wang, 76, nor June Squibb, 96.\n\n\"I think maybe a little bit like Warren Buffett or Queen Elizabeth II, I'm just going to keep prodding on because I feel as though I'm able to do my best work more and more,\" Wang said.\n\nSimilarly, working keeps Morgan Freeman active and helps ward off the effects of aging.\n\n\"There is a saying about old age — 'Keep moving' — and what Clint Eastwood, 95, says: 'Don't let the old man in,'\" Freeman, 88, said.\n\nWith Bill Nye, 70, staying busy extends well beyond work.\n\n\"I do crossword puzzles,\" Nye said. \"And as an engineer, I'm always designing and making little things.\"\n\nFor many, their mornings tend to be built around a few habits they don't skip.\n\nCindy Crawford, 59, said she eases into her mornings with a Bible podcast, dry brushing, and body oil — all before she even thinks about checking her phone.\n\n\"I probably heard it on a podcast, but it was like 'Think about it. What is the first input you want?'\" Crawford said.\n\nCate Blanchett, 56, said she loves a good icy plunge in the morning to \"jolt\" herself awake.\n\n\"I get up and get in. Five minutes, and it just brings everything back down. Because you have to connect with where you are,\" Blanchett said.\n\nMartha Stewart said she wakes up with the sun — literally, since she doesn't have curtains — and she never skips her morning green juice.\n\n\"If you have my green juice every day, you would just feel great all the time,\" Stewart said.",

    "fullText": "Our fitness expert clocked up his indoor miles to put the best exercise bikes, including simple spin machines and gym-quality models, to the test\n\nThe best treadmills for your home, tested\n\nCycling has the potential to benefit your health in myriad ways, whether it’s the mood-boosting properties of inhaling fresh air, the social element of riding with friends or the simple act of improving cardiovascular fitness with every pedal stroke.\n\nThe UK weather doesn’t always play ball, though, so for those who don’t want a dire forecast to result in a missed workout, indoor training replicates the exercise (if not the fresh air).\n\nThe best exercise bikes are not only fantastic for burning a few calories without donning all the outdoor gear, but they can also help you nail training goals if you’re a more serious rider. With many letting you connect your phone or laptop to make the most of online training tools, it’s never been easier or more enjoyable to work out from your home.\n\nI tested 12 exercise bikes, including the sort you might find in a commercial gym, along with more dedicated riding simulators and recumbent models for those who find it tricky to sit hunched forward for any length of time. The resulting list features those that I think performed best.\n\nWhile I’ve tried to appeal to a wide range of budgets, it’s difficult to recommend much under the £500 mark because the build quality of these cheaper models is often not worth the investment.\n\nBest exercise bike overall:\n\n Peloton Bike+\n\nBest budget exercise bike for beginners:\n\n Horizon 3.0SC indoor cycle\n\nBest compact exercise bike:\n\n Wattbike Proton\n\nBest gym-quality exercise bike: \n\n Technogym bike\n\nBest recumbent exercise bike:\n\n LifeFitness RS3 LifeCycle\n\nWhile I no longer compete in official cycling events, I still consider myself a keen cyclist, often heading out with friends on a gravel bike, even if those rides now end in a warm pub, rather than a timed finish line. But when the weather isn’t playing ball, I’ll get stuck into a home- or gym-based exercise bike session to keep fit and stay in shape for when cycling season comes back around again.\n\nHaving tested exercise equipment for numerous publications, I’m always one to get stuck in and test a product for as long as possible. With exercise bikes, this meant getting plenty of hands-on experience, no matter how sweaty it made me.\n\nExercise bikes are bulky items that typically require an element of setup or construction. To make testing so many of them viable, I either borrowed a pre-assembled machine for one or two weeks or tested the bikes in a dedicated boutique or workout space.\n\nDuring each test, I used any workout modes that were available, syncing a smartphone or laptop to take advantage of third-party software or online classes, if these were offered. The machines were judged on their build quality, features, ease of setup and storage (some companies offer premium white glove deliveries), as well as the overall adjustability or suitability for numerous members of the household.\n\nAfter slipping into a pair of fetching cycling shoes, I assessed noise levels with a smartphone-based decibel meter, and made more subjective assessments on the general ride feel, comfort and the overall quality of the workout experience.\n\nMany rivals have attempted to imitate Peloton, but few have managed to nail its overall experience. Above all, the brand is unmatched when it comes to live and on-demand classes, offering so many options – from a quick 15-minute spin class to hardcore sportive training, and all led by motivating instructors and accompanied by thumping soundtracks.\n\nThe Bike+ is the premium one of the brand’s two exercise bikes and has a 23.8in (huge!) high-definition display, which can be rotated for workouts that involve movements off the machine. There’s also an automatic resistance knob that adjusts to match the levels recommended by instructors during classes.\n\nIt’s expensive, with a £45-a-month “all access” membership fee on top, but for engaging, interactive workouts pitched at a wide range of users, nothing else comes close.\n\nWhy we love it\nAlthough the Bike+ isn’t as aesthetically pleasing as some of its rivals, it’s comfortable, easy to adjust and not too imposing in any room. It also has wheels, so it is relatively easy to tip on its end and move around.\n\nThe touchscreen on the Bike+ is of excellent quality and the sound from its built-in speakers is impressive, but it’s the array of classes that makes Peloton so alluring. Unlike many rivals, which can feel prescribed, mundane and overly technical, Peloton somehow makes a gruelling 45-minute spin session feel enjoyable.\n\nThe weighted flywheel and belt-drive system are quiet enough to not disturb others in the household, although hardcore road cyclists will probably balk at the Bike+ for its lack of cycling realism and the bouncy, frenetic spin-class nature of many of its workouts.\n\nIt doesn’t play nicely with third-party cycling apps – such as Zwift, Rouvy and TrainerRoad – either, so, if that’s important to you, look at the Wattbike Proton below instead.\n\nIt’s a shame that … it doesn’t feel as realistic as some rivals, and there’s a monthly fee to access the classes and features\n\nDimensions: 56 x 137 x 152cm (WLH) \nWeight: 65kg \nDrivetrain: belt-drive with magnetic, digital resistance adjustment\nSimulated grade: N/A\nConnectivity: Bluetooth 5, ANT+, wifi (2.4GHz and 5GHz)\nFolding: no\nNoise level: about 30dB\nMaximum user weight: 135kg \nBuilt-in entertainment: yes, 23.8in rotating HD touchscreen with Peloton classes, Netflix, Disney+ and more\n\nAt the time of writing, the Horizon 3.0SC Indoor Cycle cost £569.99, making it one of the cheapest exercise bikes I tested. But it certainly doesn’t feel cheap or any less capable than many of the other exercise bikes I poured sweat upon.\n\nThe 3.0SC has an ultra-smooth, front-mounted flywheel that uses electronically adjustable magnetic resistance to provide 32 effort levels. All of this is controlled via a funky and futuristic-looking digital dial that responds quickly to inputs – great for jumping out of the saddle during high-intensity efforts.\n\nAlthough this is predominantly designed for use in spin classes, its ergonomically cushioned seat and easy-adjust handlebars make it a comfortable spot to pedal away the hours. Oh, and it’s whisper-quiet too, registering just 32dB during my testing.\n\nIt may not be the sort of thing I’d use to train for an upcoming cycling sportive, but it’s a well-priced tool for hitting daily fitness goals.\n\nWhy we love it\nThe 3.0SC looks great. It even blasts out eight vibrant colours from its flywheel, depending on the RPM and amount of effort you are putting in, adding a bit of Tron-like sci-fi to any room.\n\nAnd aside from its relatively compact proportions and lightweight build, the bike is also well connected, playing nicely with Zwift, Kinomap and other third-party fitness apps. There are more realistic-feeling bikes out there, but if you swap out the pedals for a dedicated clipless system, it’s a fairly convincing road bike. Space between the cranks, for example, is as narrow as possible, making it ride like a genuine road machine.\n\nIf you’re looking for on-demand fitness classes, you can find these via Horizon’s free atZone workout app. Pair your phone or tablet with the bike, mount it to the secure plastic holder at the front of the bars, and you’re good to go. For a free service, there’s an impressive amount of content, and it’ll track your progress over time.\n\nIt’s a shame that … there isn’t an integrated display, meaning you’ll have to bring a tablet or smartphone for any instructor-led workouts.\n\nDimensions: 52 x 107 x 120cm (WLH) \nWeight: 36kg\nDrivetrain: belt drive with ECB (eddy current) magnetic, electronic resistance (32 levels)\nSimulated grade: N/A\nConnectivity: Bluetooth 5 (FTMS compatible for app integration) \nFolding: no (but features transport wheels)\nNoise level: about 32dB\nMaximum user weight: 100kg\nBuilt-in entertainment: no built-in screen; includes tablet holder and syncs with training apps\n\nWattbike is probably best known for its original red, white and black Air bike machines, which can be found in gyms and health clubs up and down the country. The company has since ventured into home-workout territory, and the Proton sits somewhere in the middle of its range, offering a lightweight, compact footprint and support for popular third-party training apps, including Zwift and TrainingPeaks.\n\nRacy looks and confusing workout programmes may risk putting off more casual users, but the Proton is designed to appeal to all of the family – comfortably adjusting for those between 4ft 6in and 6ft 6in tall. It’s not as quiet as some of its rivals, but the Proton feels realistic to ride and even has an auto-adjusting ergometer mode (ERG), so it can simulate gradients and gear changes without you having to lift a finger.\n\nWhy we love it\nWattbike has done an admirable job in retaining a realistic bike feel on such a lightweight and compact machine, with a fully adjustable seat post, saddle and handlebars that make it easy to set up to your requirements. I was able to quickly swap the standard toe-cage pedals for some Shimano clipless ones, which improved my performance and gave me greater control over pedal stroke. Most exercise bikes will allow you to swap the pedals, which takes about five minutes if you have the correct spanner or hex key. Adding cleats and pedals allows you to don a dedicated cycling shoe, which provides better power transfer between the legs and pedals compared with basic adjustable toe cages.\n\nWattbike’s background in working with pro athletes is evident from the Wattbike Hub app, which offers real-time feedback on pedal stroke and efficiency, among other nerdy data fields. The app has been tweaked to appeal to the more casual fitness fanatic, but it’s far from friendly to beginners, and you won’t find the same interactivity you would with a Peloton class. It’s more a case of following graphs and on-screen warnings about form than watching live demos from a bubbly personal trainer.\n\nHowever, there are still plenty of workouts aimed at improving overall health rather than targeting highly trained athletes. And, if you like, you can always mount your iPad in the dedicated holder and binge television or complete a virtual workout session of your choice: the Proton’s Bluetooth FTMS technology means it will work with most third-party apps, such as Zwift, TrainerRoad and Rouvy.\n\nIt’s a shame that … the app isn’t slicker and with more to entice and retain a novice.\n\nDimensions: 57 x 102 x 127cm (WLH)\nWeight: 48kg\nDrivetrain: chain drive with electromagnetic resistance\nMaximum power output: 1,800W\nSimulated grade: up to +25% incline\nConnectivity: ANT+ FE-C, Bluetooth (FTMS compatible for app integration)\nFolding: no; includes front transport wheels for ease of movement\nNoise level: about 40dB\nMaximum user weight: 135kg\nBuilt-in entertainment: no built-in screen; includes tablet holder\n\nTechnogym has been steadily raising the bar when it comes to smart fitness equipment, with a growing line of connected kit that aims to bring the personal trainer experience to your own home.\n\nClearly designed to take on the likes of Peloton, the Technogym Bike is a stylish machine with a 22in high-definition touchscreen that allows access to a raft of Technogym’s live and on-demand content.\n\nIts compact, svelte frame looks and feels as if it’s aimed at more serious cyclists than Peloton’s offering, and the ride experience is smoother and slightly more natural than its rival. There’s plenty of adjustability for different-size riders, while the included double-sided pedals allow for use with trainers or SPD cycling shoes (a clipless shoe system).\n\nThe built-in screen is crisp and easy to navigate, granting access to entertainment apps, including YouTube and Netflix. It rotates to allow for off-bike sessions, too. However, it’s among the most expensive models I tested, and there’s a further membership fee, starting at £8.99 a month. Ouch.\n\nWhy we love it\nThe riding experience is comfortable without straying too far from a realistic simulation, while the powerful flywheel offers punishing levels of resistance. Technogym has live classes, as with Peloton, but it also appeals to the more hardcore athlete with dedicated training programmes geared towards those with ambitions of tackling the Col de Turini.\n\nIf you’re seeking the best in terms of design and build quality – and your bank balance permits the luxury – you’ll be happy with this bike. It’s a handsome, well-built machine that straddles the line between a dedicated cycling trainer and a spin bike well.\n\nIt also works with most third-party training apps and syncs up neatly with Apple Fitness and Apple Watch via a quick-tap NFC panel. For those totally dedicated to Lycra, Technogym offers an even more expensive Ride model, which feels built to compete with Wattbike and Wahoo’s most serious offerings.\n\nIt’s a shame that … it costs so much, and then Technogym charges yet more for a monthly membership.\n\nDimensions: 59 x 121 x 138cm (WLH)\nWeight: 67kg\nDrivetrain: belt drive with magnetic resistance (20 levels)\nSimulated grade: not specified\nConnectivity: supports streaming via external device (eg Chromecast, Fire TV Stick); Apple Watch pairing; Technogym Live integration and third-party apps\nFolding: no\nNoise level: about 30dB\nMaximum user weight: 160kg\nBuilt-in entertainment: yes, rotating display with ability to stream apps (TV shows, movies, games, etc) via smartphone, tablet or laptop\n\nRecumbent bikes are great for those who experience back pain, struggle with past injuries or simply find it daunting or uncomfortable to be perched atop a traditional exercise bike for any length of time. You can achieve the same, low-impact cardio workout while enjoying a more relaxed seating position that takes the pressure off the lower back, leg joints and neck.\n\nLifeFitness is a reputable brand that supplies commercial gym equipment and kit more suited for use at home, with the RS3 sitting between the two. For the money, you get a comfortable, ergonomically fitted seat with backrest, 20 levels of resistance and a step-through design that makes it easy to get on and off. There’s also plenty of adjustment in the seat to get the perfect workout position.\n\nAlthough larger than many more traditional exercise bikes, it can be lifted and moved because of its transport wheels.\n\nWhy we love it\nMore seasoned riders will probably find a recumbent bike a little too laidback, since it’s difficult to transfer maximum power through the cranks from the more relaxed seating position. That said, it’s not really designed for smashing PBs – it’s best placed for longer, low-intensity steady-state cardio sessions.\n\nIt links to Rouvy, Zwift and a bunch of other third-party fitness apps, but the digital offering is otherwise basic, with a handful of built-in and customisable workouts direct from the console. Users can also pair an Apple or Samsung Galaxy Watch for heart-rate tracking and more.\n\nSome recumbent bikes can feel decidedly budget, but that’s not the case here. With excellent build quality and a smooth and quiet ride experience, the RS3 is a comfortable place to work up a sweat without the associated aches and pains.\n\nIt’s a shame that … the Track Connect 2.0 Console is fiddly to use, and there’s no built-in multimedia.\n\nDimensions: 68 x 164 x 131cm (WLH)\nWeight: 69.8kg\nDrivetrain: front-drive magnetic resistance, manual adjustment\nSimulated grade: N/A\nConnectivity: Bluetooth FTMS and NFC for syncing with apps, wireless HR receiver\nFolding: no\nNoise level: under 30dB\nMaximum user weight: 181kg\nBuilt-in entertainment: no, 7in LCD display with Track Connect Console allowing external tablet/smartphone streaming and app integration\n\nIf you’re mad for virtual cycling apps such as Zwift, Rouvy and TrainerRoad, or simply want to replicate that road cycling feel at home, Wahoo’s Kickr Shift is among the best indoor training tools for enthusiasts.\n\nThe saddle, stem height and reach can all easily be adjusted on the fly, and users can even select their desired crank length. Heck, the bike even simulates several electronically assisted gearing group sets from Shimano and Campagnolo, mimicking the way the cogs feel when shifting under load.\n\nIt’s a wonderfully quiet, smooth and powerful machine that works perfectly with dedicated cycling training apps. For those who like to reach for the chamois cream at the weekend, this is the perfect indoor companion.\n\nIt didn’t make the final cut because … the Wattbike Proton feels like a slightly more rounded machine for all the family.\n\nDimensions: 78 x 140 x 110cm (WLH); weight: 36kg; drivetrain: belt drive with electromagnetic resistance; maximum power output: 2,200W; simulated grade: +20% incline, -15% decline; connectivity: ANT+, ANT+ FE-C, Bluetooth, wifi, Direct Connect; folding: no; noise level: under 30dB; maximum user weight: 113kg; built-in entertainment: no built-in screen; requires external device for app/display\n\nBest for: a studio spin bike feel at home\n\nAnother Peloton Bike+ rival, NordicTrack’s indoor trainer is an excellent spinning machine for a smooth yet powerful ride, with a solid dose of realistic-feeling resistance that will feel tough even for seasoned cyclists. It also comes with a whopping 24in touchscreen for immersive online sessions.\n\nGranted, the iFit virtual training environment doesn’t quite compete with the Hollywood sheen of a Peloton class, but it gets mightily close, and the physical bike feels accomplished and more modern than Peloton’s slightly frumpy-looking machine.\n\nIts 20% incline to -10% simulated decline means it also doubles up as an excellent and quite realistic road or mountain biking training tool, with interactive videos that allow you to virtually cycle around some of the most beautiful places on Earth.\n\nIt didn’t make the final cut because … iFit just isn’t up to Peloton’s offering, and the multimedia setup isn’t quite as slick.\n\nDimensions: 55 x 143 x 159cm (WLH); weight: 81kg; drivetrain: silent magnetic resistance, 24 digital levels; simulated grade: +20% incline/-10% decline; connectivity: Bluetooth (headphone & HR monitor), wifi (for iFit), USB-C port, app integration via iFit (syncs with Strava, Garmin, Google Fit, Apple Health); folding: no; noise level: about 32dB; maximum user weight: 159kg; built-in entertainment: yes, 24in pivoting HD touchscreen with built-in speakers, iFit streaming of workouts, classes, and entertainment apps\n\nBest for: a recumbent bike on a budget\n\nOffering a cheaper alternative to the LifeFitness recumbent above, Schwinn’s more basic model majors in comfort and adjustability but wraps it up in a slightly lighter and cheaper-feeling frame.\n\nThe 5.5in segmented LCD screen takes care of the basics, with several built-in workouts to get you going. And there’s always the option to pair a tablet or smartphone and make use of Zwift and other digital training apps.\n\nIt represents excellent value for money, but don’t expect the same sort of build quality as pricier rivals; the handle-mounted heart-rate monitor was hugely inaccurate during my testing, and there are some cheap plastic covers masking some of the fastening bolts. On that subject, don’t expect a white glove delivery service with something at this price.\n\nIt didn’t make the final cut because … it’s not quite as robust as rivals, and the built-in heart-rate monitor was way out during tests.\n\nDimensions: 69 x 163 x 113cm (WLH); weight: 37kg; drivetrain: belt-driven flywheel with 16 levels of manual magnetic resistance; simulated grade: N/A; connectivity: Bluetooth (FTMS compatible for app integration); wireless heart-rate compatibility (strap not included); folding: no; noise level: about 32dB; maximum user weight: 136kg; built-in entertainment: no built-in screen for media; includes a 5.5in LCD console (for metrics and programmes) and a media shelf for tablets\n\nBest for: a gym-quality upright bike\n\nThis model treads the line between a serious studio bike, such as the Peloton Bike+ or NordicTrack X24, and something more relaxed. It has a comfy padded seat, oversized self-balancing pedals and a unique handlebar design that allows for multiple hand positions. Despite the upright positioning, the ride feel is realistic, and there are 30 levels of resistance to contend with.\n\nIt’s expensive, given that the XUR digital console isn’t as good as those from Technogym, Peloton and NordicTrack, but this is a solid, reliable and comfortable bit of kit from one of the biggest names in commercial gym equipment.\n\nIt didn’t make the final cut because … it’s an expensive bike with a less impressive digital offering than cheaper rivals.\n\nDimensions: 63 x 122 x 143cm (WLH); weight: 60kg; drivetrain: Exact Force induction brake (electronically adjustable resistance); simulated grade: N/A; connectivity: wifi (entertainment apps, software updates), Bluetooth (FTMS compatible for app integration, HR monitor, headphones), HDMI port, USB (media and charging); folding: no, includes transport wheels; noise level: about 28dB; maximum user weight: 159kg; built-in entertainment: yes, 22in HD touchscreen with apps including Netflix, YouTube and Spotify, web browser, social media, plus tablet/HDMI mirroring\n\nExercise bikes vary wildly in price, with the cheapest models often taking the form of basic upright or spin bikes that focus purely on pedalling, and the most expensive offering large HD touchscreens, automatic resistance adjustments and fully integrated training platforms.\n\nBudget models typically start at £250-£400, but often lack the build quality and adjustability needed for long-term use. At the other end of the spectrum, premium connected bikes – such as those from Peloton, Technogym and NordicTrack – can set you back £2,000 or more, and often require monthly subscriptions on top for interactive classes.\n\nFor most riders, a budget of between £600 and £1,200 is a good place to start for solid build quality, smooth resistance and decent connectivity features without straying into commercial-gym territory.\n\nEven the most compact exercise bikes take up space, with the smallest options measuring about 55 x 120 x 130cm (WLH). While that’s less floor space than a treadmill or cross trainer, you’ll still need clearance around the bike for safe mounting and dismounting, as well as enough ceiling height to remain comfortable when standing on the pedals.\n\nRecumbent bikes, which offer a chair-like riding position, often require more floor space, while upright and indoor cycles are more compact. It might be tempting to look at folding exercise bikes, but they can often be flimsy and offer weak pedal resistance.\n\nThe most important thing is the resistance system: magnetic resistance is smoother, quieter and requires less maintenance than older friction-based systems found on traditional studio spin bikes. Belt-drive systems are also preferable to chain-driven units for their silent, low-maintenance operation.\n\nAdjustability is another key factor – a bike with multiple saddle and handlebar positions will ensure better ergonomics and comfort over long sessions, and it will also fit more members of the household.\n\nFor those who want to stay entertained, connected bikes with integrated screens and app compatibility (Zwift, Peloton, iFit, etc) can make training more engaging. Heart-rate monitoring and Bluetooth/ANT+ connectivity are also useful for tracking progress.\n\nFinally, noise levels are worth considering, especially if you live in a flat or plan to exercise when everyone else is sleeping. Modern magnetic systems are whisper-quiet, making them perfect for shared living spaces.\n\nLeon Poultney has been a consumer technology and automotive journalist for longer than he cares to divulge.

    "description": "OpenAI  invites you to hand over your medical information. Maybe don't?",
    "fullText": "This week, OpenAI announced its new ChatGPT Health feature, which will let users upload their medical records and ask health related questions. However, I certainly won't be making use of it, it might not be the best idea for you to do it either, for both reliability and privacy reasons.\n\nThe new ChatGPT Health feature will be a sandboxed tab inside the app that is isolated from your conversation history in other conversations with the chatbot. This tab also allows users to connect a variety of health-tracking apps like Apple Health, MyFitnessPal, and Peloton, as well as uploading medical records directly.\n\nIt's important to note that this is a lot of really personal information to hand over to any tech company—but especially one that isn't primarily focused on providing medical services. OpenAI says that the ChatGPT Health space operates with \"enhanced privacy to protect sensitive data,\" but it doesn't use end-to-end encryption to secure that data. And while the company says data collected via Health isn't used to train its foundation models, it's impossible to know whether that may change in the future. Security breaches can also occur (and have in the past), potentially leaving your medical records exposed.\n\nThere's also the question of whether the risk of uploading your data is worth it in the first place. According to OpenAI's own data, around 5% of all messages to ChatGPT are already users asking questions about their health, and ChatGPT (and other LLM tools) have a nasty habit of providing inaccurate diagnostic information. This is perhaps why OpenAI says that its new ChatGPT Health feature is \"not intended for diagnosis or treatment.\"\n\nCurrently, there's a waitlist to At the very least, that means that until the feature is available, it's probably a good idea not to ask the regular version of ChatGPT about your health concerns. At the very least, wait until the enhanced privacy sandbox is available. In the meantime, consider whether it makes more sense to just talk to your doctor directly if you have questions or concerns about your health.",

    "description": "The new feature helps users understand test results, get advice on diets and workouts, and prepare for doctors’ appointments.",
    "fullText": "Amid rising concerns about people relying on ChatGPT for medical advice, OpenAI made its most significant push yet into health care.\n\nThe company has launched a new feature called ChatGPT Health, which allows users in the U.S. to connect their medical records and data from wellness apps and wearable devices with ChatGPT. The tool is designed to help users understand test results, get advice on diets and workouts, and prepare for doctors’ appointments.\n\nMore than 230 million people globally ask ChatGPT health and wellness-related questions every week, according to the company. ChatGPT Health is designed in collaboration with physicians and will “help people take a more active role in understanding and managing their health and wellness,” the company said in a post.\n\nOpenAI said it will look to expand access to the feature in markets such as India, Brazil, Mexico, and the Philippines, where adoption is rising quickly. In these countries, overburdened health-care systems and unequal access to doctors are leading more people to turn to generative AI for guidance.\n\n“We do not have the people, the labor to deliver the care we should,” Jesse Ehrenfeld, chief medical officer at Aidoc, an Israeli medical technology company, said at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. “The only way out of this mess is digital and AI.”\n\nResearchers, ethicists, and medical professionals have warned of the risks to users from biases and hallucinations in AI systems. Concern over the mental health harms that AI chatbots pose is growing. Meta’s AI chatbots provided inappropriate advice to teenagers when talking about suicide and eating disorders, Common Sense Media, a nonprofit research organization, reported last year.\n\nThe family of a teenager who died by suicide has sued OpenAI and its chief executive officer Sam Altman, accusing them of wrongful death. The company said it has safeguards in place to help people, and that it continues to improve ChatGPT’s training.\n\nThere is also the question of data privacy. Health data, particularly information related to mental disease and substance use, is sensitive, and its misuse can leave users vulnerable.\n\nWhile consumer awareness about privacy has increased, people generally do not know how their data is being used, including for marketing purposes or for tracking, Sam Siegfried, a partner at law firm McDermott Will & Schulte, told Rest of World on the sidelines of CES.\n\n“The person clearly trusts an app enough to give it their data,” he said. “But they should understand what they are using the app for, and whether its data requests sync up with what they are using it for.”\n\nOpenAI said ChatGPT Health “builds on the strong privacy, security, and data controls across ChatGPT with additional, layered protections designed specifically for health — including purpose-built encryption and isolation to keep health conversations protected and compartmentalized.”\n\nThere is no stopping tech companies from entering the health sector.\n\nBesides turning to AI chatbots for health queries, people are also buying more wearable digital devices, including smartwatches, rings, bracelets, and glasses, to track physical activity, vital signs, and various physiological responses in real-time. They take this data to their doctors — or to ChatGPT — with questions on how to interpret it or use it to improve their health.\n\n“Health-related anxiety is real. AI is not as good as a doctor, but it’s better than no care at all,” Ami Bhatt, chief innovation officer at the American College of Cardiology, said at CES.\n\nOpenAI isn’t the only big tech company keen to tap the health-care sector.\n\nApple was among the first to offer health-tracking features in its smartwatch. There are millions of health-related videos on YouTube and TikTok, with nearly 60% of Americans watching health-related videos on YouTube.\n\nHealth is “one of the major use cases for Gemini,” Nichole Young-Lin, women’s health clinical lead at Google, said at CES.\n\n“People are using generative AI as a health resource around the world,” she said. “The patient-physician relationship is very important, but health-care access is not equal. Patients feel empowered with generative AI.”",

    "description": "The \"Huberman Lab\" podcast host says good health comes down to \"intentionally high cortisol in the morning and intentionally low cortisol at night.\"",
    "fullText": "Andrew Huberman says one simple morning habit helps him optimize his physical and mental health.\n\nThe neuroscientist and podcaster said people should aim for high cortisol in the morning and low cortisol at night.\n\nThe \"best way\" to spike morning cortisol levels is to get daylight soon after waking up, he said.\n\nStanford neuroscientist Andrew Huberman says one morning habit plays a key role in his overall health.\n\nIn an interview with GQ published on Monday, the host of the popular \"Huberman Lab\" podcast shared the routines he's relying on to stay healthy in 2026.\n\n\"Getting your physical health right — which puts your mental health in the best possible place — is all about intentionally high cortisol in the morning and intentionally low cortisol at night,\" Huberman told GQ.\n\nAlthough cortisol has a bad reputation as a stress hormone, Huberman says it plays an important role in how the body transitions from sleep to wakefulness.\n\n\"No, you wake up in the morning because of a rise in cortisol. You want a big, massive spike of cortisol in the morning. If you don't spike your morning cortisol, your cortisol spikes in the afternoon or evening, and then everything goes awry, OK? You want your morning cortisol at least 30x higher than your nighttime cortisol,\" he said.\n\nOne way to keep that rhythm on track would be to send the body a signal.\n\n\"The best way to spike your morning cortisol is to get bright light — ideally from sunlight — in your eyes in the first hour after waking. If you can't do that, maybe invest in a 10,000 Lux artificial light,\" Huberman said.\n\nIf that's not possible, he suggests flipping on \"as many artificial lights as you can.\"\n\n\"I've made a mistake in the past — a tactical mistake, a strategic mistake — by calling it sunlight. People say, 'It's overcast.' What we should say is, 'Get daylight in your eyes,'\" he said.\n\nHaving dim mornings and bright nights is \"the worst way to go,\" he added.\n\nLight exposure isn't the only thing Huberman says matters in the morning. He also encourages people to fit in a workout if they can.\n\n\"If you don't have time to exercise first thing in the morning, you need bodily movement. Even some knee bends, some arm swings, some jumping jacks. Movement generates cortisol and adrenaline,\" he said.\n\nWhen it comes to winding down at night, people should take the opposite approach, Huberman said.\n\n\"If you want to wear BluBlockers, you can. But dim the lights down, avoid caffeine. If you're going to exercise, don't make it terribly intense,\" he said.\n\nThe benefits of getting light in the mornings are supported by broader research in the field.\n\nMariana Figueiro, professor and director of the Light and Health Research Center at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, told Business Insider in 2023 that getting daylight is \"just as important as diet and exercise.\"\n\n\"Light in the built environment is not always strong enough to synchronize the biological clock,\" Figueiro said. \"The beauty of daylight is that daylight is the right amount, it's the right color, it's on at the right time.\"\n\nMoreover, getting enough darkness at night is just as crucial, since circadian disruption has been linked to poor cognitive performance and a weakened immune system, Figueiro said.",

    "description": "Rajan Chidambaram and Renzo Sanio bought a property and built a cabin. After getting input on social media, they leaned into adding wellness amenities.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Rajan Chidambaram and Renzo Sanio, two 23-year-olds who built a cabin and turned it into a wellness retreat in Front Royal, Virginia, a town about 70 miles outside Washington, DC. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nRenzo Sanio: When I got interested in real estate development, I was told that it's the riskiest way to play the real estate game, but you can create the most impact in the physical world.\n\nThey were not wrong about it being the riskiest way to play the real estate game.\n\nWhen you build something, everyone wants to have an influence over what you're building — from the county, to the local covenants for what siding you have, to the building code. Ultimately, everything lands on the owner to handle it all.\n\nWe had zero experience in handling these complications that came up when we started building our cabin. We're also not well capitalized — we'd been saving money to buy the property, but took out a $300,000 construction loan to build the cabin — so you can barely even call us a developer. We're just two college students who decided to take on a really big project while we were still in school and soon to graduate.\n\nI started to do some research and found that by 2030, one out of three travelers is going to decide to book a place based on its wellness offerings.\n\nThen Rajan made a video speaking about wellness, and it gained a lot of traction.\n\nA post shared by Rajan Chida (@chida.rajan)\n\nRajan Chidambaram: The video went ballistic. I had an insane amount of health influencers follow me — I had Kyrie Irving follow me off of that video. It was insane.\n\nTo this day, I don't fully understand why that video resonated so much, but it really brought to our attention that we can marry wellness with the type of asset that we're building. And, obviously, the demand is there, so we were like, \"This is just the angle that we want to go.\"\n\nSanio: It was always our plan to add a hot tub, a sauna, and a cold plunge, but now we're doing things like red light therapy inside the cabin.\n\nWe're also offering Normatec compression sleeves, and completely fleshing out the inside with sustainably sourced woods, non-toxic paints, non-toxic and fragrance-free soaps, all these little details.\n\nWe ended up landing about $30,000 over our expected budget, and that's just because as we grew on social media, we got more and more excited about the kinds of things that we could offer our guests.\n\nWe really got to splurge on those items because of all the attention we saw on social media. We thought we could offer guests a really good experience now because of all the demand.\n\nA post shared by Rajan Chida (@chida.rajan)\n\nChidambaram: We have a thesis that this is where society is shifting toward — especially with the rise of AI and all this other stuff. People are going to crave real experiences, so that's where our heads were at.\n\nSanio: There's this whole wave of AI and digital this, digital that, but we've really designed this space for it to be a way to disconnect from that. This space has no TV, and it has games and features inside that we've curated to have people really connect with themselves, but also connect with the people that they go there with.\n\nChidambaram: The growing pains have been more on learning the operational side of stuff, like fixing stuff for guests right before they come. There were a lot of things we didn't expect.\n\nHow can you even prepare for your power going out because the county was cutting down trees?\n\nIt's very cold up in the mountains, and one time we lost power for a couple of hours, and it froze one of our pipes to the hot tub.\n\nOur water comes out of a spigot, and it was properly insulated, but the outside of the spigot wasn't, so it froze.\n\nThree hours before a guest came, I drove up there and bought a heat gun. The hot tub needed to be filled in the next three hours, and I didn't have a choice. I started heating up the spigot, and the water came out.\n\nSo now we're thinking, how can we have the people in place to solve these unexpected problems that will happen? Because it's just not a matter of if — it's when.\n\nWe were also really delayed for about three months because of windows. Tariffs kind of hurt us. We were at a standstill for about three months.\n\nSanio: Our windows were fully framed, but you can't do any interior work until you're what's called \"dried in.\"\n\nBecause if you have holes in everything and gas in your windows, and then you install your electrical system, the rain's just going to get to it. So we couldn't do anything until those windows came in, and we got the windows from Poland, and the tariffs slowed down that import process, which is why we were held after three months.\n\nThen there was an inspection to test the air tightness of our build — which there's a regulation for. There's just so many regulations and so many inspections. It's not just one inspection at the end.\n\nAfter we started to look into the wellness themes, we really wanted to flood the space with natural light, so we signed a $6,000 change order to have two more skylights installed. There was no budget for it, it was just something that we knew we wanted to have.\n\nThe total build came out to about $350,000 for the first cabin — we plan to build more on the property — and the land was about $37,000. We spent about $16,000 on furniture, fixtures and equipment.\n\nChidambaram: We've had a handful of guests so far. All of December is booked out, plus more than half of January, and a good amount of February and March, too.\n\nSanio: January and February are the slowest months for short-term rentals, and we've been killing it. Rajan handles marketing, property management, and booking, and we've been 100% occupied for those months.\n\nChidambaram: Our nights are dynamically priced, so weekends are a lot more expensive than weekdays. We also use software that takes into account holidays.\n\nA good goal for 2026 is to try to hit an average of $450 a night. But right now, nights are going to be somewhere in the ballpark of $330 to $490.\n\nSanio: It's challenging doing something so complicated for the first time. We're doing something that's typically only reserved for people with a lot of experience in construction or real estate development.\n\nWe're encouraged by our online community — most of the audience that has followed along on social media are young people and aspiring entrepreneurs.\n\nChidambaram: They've seen our whole project come from literally nothing — like ugly trees and dirt to what it is now. I think that's a special connection that people feel to watching us grow.",

    "fullText": "Noodle dish is nation’s favourite comfort food and source of civic pride – but it has health risks\n\nThe road to ramen paradise ends in the unlikeliest of places. At Men Endo, located in a suburban street, next to a school and a low-rise apartment block, bowls of noodles disappear in a flurry of slurps, gulps and hurried but heartfelt exchanges of appreciation between customer and chef.\n\nOn a cold afternoon in Yamagata, a city in Japan’s northeast, the wait for a seat at Men Endo’s counter is mercifully short. Inside the door, a ticket dispenser lists myriad options, from regular shoyu (soy sauce) ramen – in small, medium or large portions – to maji soba, a soupless symphony of toppings, sauce and noodles that diners are invited to mix together with their chopsticks, along with a spoonful of spicy miso.\n\nThat Men Endo – men is from menrui, the Japanese word for noodles, and Endo is a family name – has managed to secure a loyal clientele – which today includes construction workers, couples and a solo diner from the Guardian – is no mean feat.\n\nIn Yamagata, 340km north of Tokyo, noodle fiends have around 230 establishments to choose from, with several opening their doors early for those craving comfort food.\n\n“People here don’t ask each other where they want to go for dinner, but which ramen restaurant to go to,” says Osamu Higuchi, assistant manager in Yamagata’s brand strategy section.\n\nIt is that level of dedication to eating at restaurants – as opposed to making ramen at home or grabbing a lunchtime cup of the instant variety – that has earned Yamagata, a modestly sized city of 240,000, the title of Japan’s ramen capital.\n\nThe accolade is a source of pride, its current reign the result of an aggressive campaign to outperform its closest rival, Niigata, which shocked the ramen world by taking the title in 2021.\n\nLast year, Yamagata’s households each spent an average of ¥22,389 [£106] on ramen – well ahead of second-placed Niigata on ¥16,292, according to the internal affairs ministry, which will soon announce the winner for 2025. Only the annual ranking for gyoza consumption generates similar levels of anticipation. That title currently belongs to Hamamatsu in central Japan.\n\n“When Niigata won it was a huge shock,” says Higuchi. “Eating ramen is a big part of daily life here … to be honest it hurt our feelings.”\n\nBut the city’s appetite for ramen has its drawbacks. Frequent consumption can increase health risks, mainly due to the soup’s high salt content, according to a study of almost 7,000 people aged 40 and over led by Yamagata University. People who have the dish three or more times a week have a mortality risk 1.52 times higher than those who eat it once or twice a week, according to the four-year study published in October in the Journal of Nutrition, Health and Aging.\n\nThe experts added, however, that the statistics did not mean regular consumption was a “definite danger”, given that those most at risk possibly indulged in other habits “common among frequent ramen” eaters, such as excessive overall salt intake, drinking and smoking.\n\n“I’ve been trying not to drink all of the soup, but it’s very moreish, and the chefs go to a lot of effort to make it so it feels rude to leave any,” says Higuchi who, after consulting a smartphone app, announces he has polished off 225 bowls of ramen so far this year. “That said, households here spend an average of about ¥2,000 a month on ramen … it’s not that much when you think about it.”\n\nHealth risks aside, no Japanese dish commands as much loyalty, or generates as much discussion, as ramen. Popularised in Japan after the second world war – thanks to returning soldiers who fondly recalled how it had sustained them in Japanese-occupied China – it became a symbol of recovery and resilience.\n\nRamen critic Rikiya Yamaji believes Yamagata has perfected the art of adapting what was originally a Chinese dish to suit the Japanese palate. “Ramen has been around in Japan since the Meiji era [1868-1912], but became particularly popular when it was served at food stalls after the war,” said Yamaji, who gets through 30 bowls a month and has been known to visit several ramen shops a day.\n\n“A distinctive feature of Japanese food culture is its ability to ‘localise’ dishes introduced from overseas … curry rice is a good example. In the same way, ramen has evolved into new food culture with a uniquely Japanese approach, like Tex-Mex cuisine in the US. It used to be considered cheap and filling, and it’s still convenient and inexpensive, but these days there is more emphasis on quality and fusion ingredients.”\n\nThe noodle dish with humble origins is now the yardstick by which Japan’s regions measure their culinary caché, triggering fierce rivalries and competing claims to have achieved the perfect marriage of soup, noodles and toppings. Varieties range from miso ramen in the far north, to those sitting in a pale but pungent pork-based broth in the deep south.\n\nThe roots of Yamagata’s obsession lie in the aftermath of the 1923 Great Kantō Earthquake, which killed more than 100,000 people in the Tokyo area. Ramen chefs who fled the destroyed capital to work at soba restaurants in Yamagata shared their ramen-making skills and found a population with an appetite for steaming hot noodles to get them through the city’s bitterly cold winters. Households would order ramen, rather than trays of sushi, to serve to guests – a custom that gave children an early introduction to a dish they continued to eat into adulthood.\n\nAfter it ceded its title to Niigata a few years ago, ramen shop owners and officials in Yamagata teamed up to create an organisation dedicated to re-establishing the city as Japan’s “ramen kingdom”.\n\nHiguchi is confident Yamagata will retain the title when the government announces the 2025 results in early February. “If our ramen businesses do well, then so does the local economy – farmers and soy sauce manufacturers, even the companies that produce hot towels for restaurants,” he says. “I don’t think it’s going too far to say that Yamagata is ramen.”",

    "description": ": Workers face new mental health pressures as they shift from doing tasks to babysitting agentic AI",
    "fullText": "A report on occupational health warns that AI adoption may paradoxically increase workplace burdens rather than reduce them. As AI automates routine tasks, workers will shoulder new responsibilities: overseeing AI systems, catching their errors, and managing the resulting complexity – potentially triggering mental health pressures.\n\nResearchers from Imperial College London and Microsoft argue the real impact won't be mass job replacement, but a fundamental shift in work demands. Human roles will evolve from performing tasks to stewarding AI agents across workflows, including briefing them, reviewing outputs, and correcting errors.\n\n\"As AI absorbs routine tasks, human roles may shift toward stewardship, problem-solving, or emotional labor, all with their own psychological demands,\" said Dr Lara Shemtob, who led the research published in the Society of Occupational Medicine's (SOM) journal Occupational Medicine.\n\nThis effectively transforms workers into managers of AI systems – a role not everyone is suited for. The report warns AI may \"paradoxically increase the knowledge worker's burden of handling complex tasks while simultaneously exerting downward pressure on compensation.\" This means more responsibility and less pay, because AI supposedly makes work \"easier.\"\n\nAll of this could introduce novel occupational hazards, some familiar in form but different in scale and complexity, raising stress levels.\n\nEvidence already supports this concern. A 2024 study found AI coding tools actually slowed developers down due to time spent checking and correcting AI-generated errors. As AI systems become more autonomous, problems like \"hallucinations\" (false or inaccurate outputs) may escalate and become harder to detect.\n\nUntil now, much of the debate over AI has centred on the extent to which it will (or maybe won't) replace people's jobs.\n\nThe report urges quantifying AI supervision demands and building them into job descriptions to avoid hidden workloads that negate automation benefits.\n\nResearchers don't yet know the exact impact on human employees from having to work more closely with AI, the report concludes, but they say occupational health should be part of the dialog and analysis of how AI changes expectations of workers.\n\nWhether this scenario materializes remains uncertain. Recent reports show companies have invested tens of billions in generative AI with little return, and many projects fail due to underestimated deployment complexity.\n\nThe question isn't just how AI will change work, it's whether widespread adoption will happen at all. ®",

    "fullText": "It's only been days since an audacious U.S. raid snatched Nicolás Maduro from a Venezuelan military base and sped him to a Brooklyn prison, yet Detroit-area Trump supporter Aaron Tobin can already see it all playing out on the big screen.\n\nIt'll be the subject of movies for years to come, he predicts. “I am thrilled.” Plenty of others who voted for President Donald Trump and spoke to The Associated Press about the raid are applauding, too — at least for now.\n\nThe seizure of Venezuela's authoritarian leader and his wife has forced another reckoning on the “Make America Great Again” coalition, already rocked by the Trump administration's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files and strained by rising health insurance premiums and living costs.\n\nTrump promised his voters that “America First” would stand against more foreign entanglements. Instead, he intervened with force and without congressional approval in a new frontier, a South American capital so far from Washington that Google Maps says it “can't seem to find a way there.”\n\nThe geopolitical action film that Tobin sees in his mind is only at its opening scene, before all the complexities of uprooting a foreign government by a U.S. president's fiat come rushing in. U.S. forces entered and exited swiftly. But what happens next?\n\nTrump finds early but not endless support\n\nEarly on, the pushback from congressional Republicans and Trump's core constituencies has been guarded, in contrast to their uproar over the Epstein episode or the tensions coursing through Republican politics over the now-expired health insurance subsidies.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, Trump voters interviewed by AP journalists around the country praised the operation and expressed faith in Trump's course. But not always limitless faith. They did not all back up Trump's claim that those who “voted for me are thrilled. They said, ‘This is what we voted for.’”\n\n“I support him so far,” Paul Bonner, 67, told AP while browsing at a Trump merchandise store in Bensalem, Pennsylvania. “Until he messes up, I support him.”\n\nTrump's apparent willingness to stay involved in Venezuela and his intensifying rhetoric about expanding U.S. power elsewhere in the hemisphere are making some of his die-hard supporters nervous.\n\nNot all of them are reaching for the popcorn yet.\n\nIn Mississippi, a conflicted Trump voter\n\nChase Lewis, 24, of Philadelphia, Mississippi, said the move caught him off guard and he still isn’t sure whether he supports it. “It’s good that they’re finally freed from that dictatorship,” he said of Venezuelans, “but I don’t know what it’s going to cost us.”\n\nHe added: “I don’t want my friends that are serving right now to be dragged into a war because we went and stuck our nose in Venezuela’s business.” He noted that Trump had campaigned against starting new wars. “Depending on how you look at it,” he said, “this was an act of war.”\n\nAn electrician apprentice who gave up his delivery job because he needed to make more money, Lewis said he wants to see the Trump administration focus on bringing down costs for young people like himself. He also wants the president to make life better for veterans and worries about plunging the country into more conflicts.\n\nIn Colorado, cheers and caution from Trump voters\n\nTo Trump voter Travis Garcia, leaning against his red pickup truck on a chilly evening in Castle Rock, Colorado, it’s a slam-dunk. “Of course I’m going to be happy that they captured a dictator that’s constantly sending drugs our way,” he said, “If we’re not gonna do it, who’s gonna do it?”\n\nThe 45-year-old, who works in remodeling, said the operation reinforces Trump's stature as “a powerful man who follows through on his word and isn’t going to be shy and timid and let other countries run the rules.”\n\nMary Lussier, 48, a flight attendant from the town of Larkspur, was so amazed by the success of the mission in Venezuela that she would be OK with more such operations. She recalled videos of Venezuelans tearfully celebrating Maduro's removal and said fewer bad leaders “would make the world a little bit lesser of a bad place.”\n\nStill, Lussier wouldn’t want U.S. soldiers stuck in a prolonged conflict, and much of her admiration for the operation hinged less on the possible benefits to the U.S. than on the smooth efficiency and bravado of the raiders.\n\nOutside a Safeway grocery store in Castle Rock, Patrick McCans, 66, said delicately that Trump's intervention was “a little contrary to what he campaigned on.”\n\n“I would like to see more of a diplomatic way of making change,” said the retired engineer. Still, he said, pondering for a moment, “I think in this case it might have been warranted.”\n\nInstead of playing ball, Maduro was “playing chicken with Trump, and Trump doesn’t like chicken,” he said, chuckling from beneath a Baltimore Ravens baseball cap.\n\nThe Colorado Trump supporters interviewed by AP all applauded the military operation’s smoothness and “class,” as one described it. But that support could waver if the U.S. is drawn into a longer conflict, which none of them would support.\n\nFew mentioned Trump’s plans for Venezuela’s oil, but thought Maduro's removal would benefit citizens and slow the drug trade and immigration to the U.S.\n\nFrom Pennsylvania: Good riddance to Maduro\n\nAt the Golden Dawn Diner in Levittown, Pennsylvania, Ron Soto, 88, expressed unreserved faith in the president's ability to manage what comes next. The retired tractor-trailer driver regularly visits the diner to meet friends, drink coffee and catch up.\n\nMaduro is an “awful man,” he said. But should U.S. forces go into other countries, like Cuba, as it did in Venezuela? “I don’t think they’ll have to,” he said. “Because he (Trump) put the fear in them.”\n\nAs for Trump's comment at one point that his administration would “run” Venezuela, Soto said the president will “straighten that country out and make it into a democracy if he can. I don’t know if he can.”\n\nAt the Neshaminy Mall, in Bensalem, retired firefighter Kevin Carey, 62, pronounced himself supportive of what Trump did but aware of the risks.\n\n“I wouldn’t say thrilled but I’m cautiously optimistic,” he said. Carey recalled the seizing of U.S. hostages by Iranian revolutionaries in 1979 as an indication of what might happen if the conflict escalates. But “he'll take all actions to avoid that, I believe,” he said of Trump.\n\nOn any further foreign intervention, Carey broke out laughing when he said: “He wants Greenland to be part of America!”\n\nAt the Trump merchandise store where Bonner shopped, banners and other items proclaiming “Trump 2028” are on display. Trump is constitutionally prohibited from running in 2028.\n\n“I know he can’t run for president” in 2028, said Bonner, a propane company worker. Still, he wanted a lawn sign “just to irritate people” but didn't find one.\n\nThe crisp military operation plainly left him impressed. “They got in and they got out, did what they had to do,” he said. Of Maduro, he said: “He’s an enemy of the United States so I support Trump 100%.”\n\nExiting a Walmart in Martinsville, Indiana, Mark Edward Miller, 75, from nearby Mooresville, said the only thing that surprised him about Trump's intervention was that word of it did not leak in advance. The consistent Trump voter was an aircraft maintenance specialist in the Air Force before his retirement.\n\n“I don’t feel like he’s actually taken over a country,” Miller said. “I believe that he’s doing exactly what our country should be doing — supporting, especially in our hemisphere, governments that are friendly with us” and challenging those that are hostile.\n\nTobin, the man in Michigan who sees a cinematic future for the raid, not only approved of the operation but wants more of them.\n\n“Especially if they were as successful as this last one where we didn’t lose any troops, we didn’t lose any planes or ships,” Tobin said during a visit to the Oakland County Republican Party headquarters, where he was surrounded by Trump and GOP memorabilia. “I am thrilled and surprised” by what happened.\n\n“Cuba’s very nervous right now,” he said. “And the Cuban people are suffering immensely from their horrible situation and their economy. Iran might be next.”\n\nThe three-time Trump voter is an active member of the local Republican Party, a certified firearms instructor and head of a bicycling group in his hometown of Oak Park, Michigan.\n\nHis takeaway: “President Trump does not speak idly. If he says he’s going to do something, he does something.”\n\nBedayn reported from Colorado, Catalini from Pennsylvania, Householder from Michigan, Bates from Mississippi, Lamy from Indiana and Woodward from Washington.",

    "fullText": "Jelly Roll is opening up about what it took to lose nearly 300 lbs.\n\nIn an interview with Men’s Health published in January 2025, he explained, “I just remember everyone telling me GLP-1s, or taking the Ozempic or the Mounjaro, 'Listen, it's gonna hurt your stomach a little bit.’ I've treated my body so bad, I can't believe God's gave me this voice for this long. I didn't deserve it. I literally didn't do it out of fear.”\n\nThe musician also revealed he was hospitalized. “Even before I got into getting my blood work done, I went and got mental health therapy about my overeating. I started treating my food addiction like what it was: an addiction. Why did I treat cocaine a certain way? I went to meetings for cocaine and found a sponsor and detoxed off of it and s*** myself and went through real hard life-changing emotional choices to get off cocaine and codeine,\" Jelly Roll shared. \"I didn’t look at the food addiction different. Once I started treating food like an addiction, it started changing everything for me.\"\n\nThough Jelly Roll didn’t use GLP-1, he was prescribed metformin, a drug used to treat diabetes. Keep scrolling to learn more about the drug and how it helped the singer lose weight.\n\nJelly Roll Reveals He Can Fit in Louis Vuitton Amid Weight Loss Journey: ‘Pray for My Bank Account’\n\nAccording to Harvard Health, the drug was approved for use in Europe in 1959 and in the United States in 1995. It is the most widely used drug for the treatment of diabetes for people who cannot control their blood sugar through diet and exercise.\n\nHarvard Health also noted that the drug has other benefits. These include the treatment of prediabetes (the drug can delay the onset of symptoms), gestational diabetes (which some pregnant women develop), polycystic ovarian syndrome (the drug can help regular the menstrual cycle), and weight gain from the use of antipsychotic medicines.\n\nResearchers are also currently studying if the drug can help lower the risk of cancer for people who have type 2 diabetes, lower the risk of dementia and stroke and prevent age-related diseases.\n\nJelly Roll worked with nurse practitioner Danese Raxroad, who treated him through Ways2Well. Jelly Roll was diagnosed with levels of insulin he described to Men’s Health as “super high.”\n\n“Insulin is designed to help glucose enter the cell,” Raxroad told the outlet. “When you have an excessive amount of insulin, it forces your body to store fat. So switching those receptors and switching what Jelly’s body was signaling with insulin helped him rapidly adjust his insulin resistance. I wasn’t doing a big science experiment. It was just meal timing and eating real foods.”\n\nThe goal for Jelly Roll was that the drug would help reduce his triglycerides, the fat cells in his blood.\n\nLike many drugs, metformin does have side effects. According to Harvard Health, these can include minor gastrointestinal problems such as stomach upset and nausea; some people can also have a severe allergic reaction or suffer from lactic acidosis, a build up of lactic acid in the bloodstream.",
