    "fullText": "There's no need to mince words. Thursday night's matchup between the Los Angeles Rams and Seattle Seahawks has massive NFC playoff implications. The winner of said game will likely have the inside track to the conference's No. 1 seed throughout the postseason next month, which obviously means guaranteed homefield advantage and the sole bye week available.\n\nUnfortunately for the Rams, who beat the Seahawks at home earlier this season, they will have to overcome their NFC West rival on the road without one of their best players.\n\nVeteran star receiver Davante Adams is likely to miss Thursday's game with a left hamstring injury. It's a reaggravation of the same injury Adams suffered earlier this season. The Rams apparently don't believe Adams' injury is of a long-term variety. He could theoretically return as soon as next week. But with the postseason around the corner, they're rightfully proceeding with caution so one of their top playmakers is healthy and can play in the biggest games.\n\nEven still, a road game against the team nipping at your heels in the NFC and NFC West is probably the worst game to miss. Alas, the Rams are definitely more equipped than most to survive without Adams for at least one week:\n\nRams are listing WR Davante Adams as doubtful for Thursday night’s game in Seattle due to his hamstring injury. pic.twitter.com/pDs8Tx533A\n\n— Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) December 17, 2025\n\nWe'll see how the Rams fare without Adams, who leads the team in touchdowns (14) and is second in both catches and receiving yards.\n\nJordan Whittington is listed as Adams' backup on the Rams' depth chart. Whittington is in his second NFL season after being drafted in the sixth round of the 2024 NFL Draft.\n\nThis article originally appeared on For The Win: Davante Adams injury update: When is Rams star coming back?",

    "fullText": "You might want to check your fridge — hundreds of thousands of cases of shredded cheese sold across the country have been recalled due to contamination concerns.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration said Great Lakes Cheese Co. recalled more than 260,000 cases of shredded cheese because they may contain metal fragments, according to AP News.\n\nThe recall includes various cheese types sold in stores like Target, Aldi, and Walmart.\n\nPer the FDA website, the recall has a Class II classification, which means the product \"may cause temporary or medically reversible adverse health consequences or where the probability of serious adverse health consequences is remote.\"\n\nHealth officials said metal fragments may cause dental damage or other injuries to the mouth or intestines if ingested.\n\nAP News reported that the shredded cheese was sold in 31 states and Puerto Rico.\n\nAccording to Delish, the FDA issued 241 food and beverage recalls in 2024 — an 8% increase from the year before. Additionally, the number of people who fell ill or died from food contamination doubled.\n\nA major concern surrounding food production and packaging is the use of plastic. Per CNN, plastic packaging can shed microplastics and nanoplastics when you unwrap cheese or open the caps on bottles. Microplastics are tiny particles that have a large impact.\n\nAccording to Stanford researchers, about 10 million to 40 million metric tons of microplastics are released into the environment annually. Studies have linked microplastics exposure to cancer, heart attacks, and a variety of other health issues in humans and animals.\n\nResearchers continue to study the damaging impacts of plastic packaging. Moving away from plastic in food production would likely reduce the risk of accidents that lead to food contamination.\n\nDo you worry about having toxic forever chemicals in your home?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nWhile the United Nations failed to solidify a treaty for plastic production and waste in 2025, global leaders in food and packaging later signed the 2030 Plastic Agenda for Business. The companies involved represent 20% of global plastic packaging.\n\nMeanwhile, you can reduce your exposure to plastic in food by making simple changes at home. Consumer Reports recommended that consumers avoid plastic food containers and replace them with more sustainable options, such as glass or silicone.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "Coca-Cola is under the microscope as experts sound the alarm over the drink's health risks.\n\nWhile the sugar content in soda is no surprise, researchers are now pinpointing exactly what happens to your body when you drink a can of regular Coca-Cola.\n\nNew studies are scrutinizing Coca-Cola, as researchers are linking the drink to fatty liver disease, Type 2 diabetes, and heart disease, The Telegraph reported.\n\nA study published in Nature Medicine, for example, linked millions of Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease cases to sugar-based beverages. Likewise, a study conducted by a group of Swedish researchers has gone so far as to directly condemn the sugar drink industry for cases of cardiovascular disease.\n\nWhen you drink a can of regular Coca-Cola, your body experiences a sugar rush within the first hour of consumption. Since Coca-Cola contains caffeine as well as sugar, drinking soda consistently can also cause you to develop a \"degree of dependence,\" per the Telegraph. This dependency can then cause some consistent cola drinkers to \"wean themselves off it gradually to lessen the effects of the caffeine and sugar withdrawal.\"\n\nThe new research reinforces the health risks of regularly drinking Coca-Cola. What's worse, in the United Kingdom, experts are also calling out the country's food labeling system, which gives Coca-Cola three green traffic lights, a label that is misleading for consumers.\n\n\"Coke is just through the roof [for sugar],\" specialist registered dietitian Nichola Ludlam-Raine told the Telegraph. \"In my opinion, it shouldn't be allowed to be sold.\"\n\nFrom an environmental perspective, Coca-Cola is the world's leading producer of branded plastic waste, and while the company has taken some steps to mitigate its plastic waste, it still has a significant way to go.\n\nResearchers are continuing to study the long-term impacts of drinking soda, adding to the growing pile of evidence underscoring the health risks.\n\nTo protect yourself from these risks, you can reduce your soda intake. Health experts also suggest swapping out that can of Coca-Cola for a healthier alternative, such as fizzy water.\n\nDo you worry about having toxic forever chemicals in your home?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

They also used a school-system quality metric based on previous WalletHub research.\n\nThe quality of life ranking took into account factors such as average commute time and work hours, as well as the number of restaurants, bars, clubs, and other attractions per capita. Each city's safety ranking was determined using rates like violent and property crime, car crashes, pedestrian deaths, and drug poisoning deaths.\n\nThe study utilized data from the US Census Bureau, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, as well as data from companies such as Areavibes, TransUnion, TripAdvisor, Yelp, and WalletHub.\n\nOf the over 1,000 cities, 19 received scores that ranked in the top percentile across the various categories.\n\nSee the places that WalletHub ranked as being the top small cities in the US in 2025.\n\nLancaster, Pennsylvania, had the highest quality of life ranking among the top cities, placing within the top 10 nationwide.\n\nAlthough Arlington, Massachusetts — located six miles outside Boston — is among the top five most unaffordable cities in the top-performing cities, it ranked second-best in education and health out of all 1,318 cities in the study.\n\nLexington, Massachusetts, was ranked as having the best education and health in the nation in the study.

    "description": "We're really into minimalism, so we started furniture-free living four years ago. I've noticed health benefits, like better balance and strength.",
    "fullText": "My wife and I live in a pretty garden apartment that's almost entirely devoid of furniture. The closest things we have are a bamboo laptop table and two single camping mattresses.\n\nAt our ages — 57 and 60 — we're expected to invest in matching La-Z-Boys and TV trays, but we spend most of our time on the floor on yoga mats. Honestly, we've never been happier.\n\nIf you'd told me this was what the future held for us back when we were lounging on our L-shaped couch in 2020, I'd have suggested you reduce the strength of your edibles. As much as we still dream about that comfortable couch, though, we wouldn't take it back.\n\nLife without furniture comes with an array of benefits, both expected and unexpected, and they're not worth trading for modern-day creature comforts.\n\nEver since inadvertently becoming minimalists in 2008, we've made a point of engaging in lifestyle experiments, but it had never occurred to us to eschew furniture.\n\nThen, I listened to a podcast about furniture-free living. I was immediately intrigued, but my wife wasn't as easily convinced.\n\nThe idea wasn't one we could entertain anyway, since we were about to move to a fully-furnished cottage in the middle of nowhere. Life has a way of giving you what you need, though, and the country wasn't for us.\n\nFive months later, we were back in Cape Town's city bowl, on the hunt for new digs.\n\nWhen a stunning, affordable, and unfurnished apartment showed up in my inbox, I took it as a sign that it was time to give furniture-free living a try.\n\nThe lush, bee-friendly garden with a towering pine tree won my wife over immediately. I didn't even have to say a word; I suspect she'd have agreed even if it meant sleeping outside in a tent.\n\nWe made some mistakes at first. Initially, we bought a cheap, low-level futon to sleep on, but it proved a poor choice for our backs, and we soon ditched it in favor of our camping mattresses.\n\nOur intention was always to buy a tatami sleeping mat down the line, but our frugal \"if it ain't broke\" selves keep deferring the purchase.\n\nRight from the get-go, we both loved hanging out on the floor, and it just felt right.\n\nWithin about a month, we began to feel physically stronger — probably because we were constantly getting up and down from floor level and forced to work on our posture.\n\nWithout a cushy office chair to sink into for hours at a stretch, we're naturally reminded to change position or get up and move.\n\nPlus, our balance has improved because we've trained ourselves to get up and sit down without the help of our hands. We can also sit unsupported for extended periods.\n\nPractically, no furniture makes moving homes — something we've done more than once in the past few years — a breeze. It makes sense for us to live in a way that supports our perpetual desire for change.\n\nWith nothing to move, housework is also ridiculously easy. Plus, our apartment always looks neat.\n\nProbably the best benefit, though, is that our quirky rescue kitty seems to love our furniture-free life. He prefers to tunnel under our legs rather than sit on our laps — and being on the floor gives him a lot of chances to do this.\n\nWhen we tell people about our lifestyle, the same concern always comes up: How do you entertain? The truth is, we don't.\n\nThis way of life isn't for everyone, and the last thing we'd want is to make our guests feel uncomfortable. So, we've found middle ground by meeting for walks or going out for coffee or a meal. It might not work for everyone, but it works for us.\n\nIronically, our next lifestyle experiment — which we're tentatively planning for late 2026 — means going back to a bed and couch, but only because you can't do without either when you live in a van.\n\nWell, technically you could … but even we're not up for that level of discomfort.",

    "fullText": "Exclusive: UK government’s ‘naive belief’ that Trump is a good faith actor ‘could cost UK taxpayer billions’, says health select committee chair\n\nMinisters and senior MPs have warned that the UK’s agreements with Donald Trump are “built on sand” after the Guardian established that the deal to avoid drug tariffs has no underlying text beyond limited headline terms.\n\nThe “milestone” US-UK deal announced this month on pharmaceuticals, which will mean the NHS pays more for medicines in exchange for a promise of zero tariffs on the industry, still lacks a legal footing beyond top lines contained in two government press releases.\n\nConcerns over the basis of the agreement have been heightened by Washington’s decision to suspend the £31bn “tech prosperity deal”, which had been hailed as “a generational step-change in our relationship with the US”. The deal was paused after the US claimed a lack of progress from the UK in lowering trade barriers in other areas.\n\nIt has also emerged that concessions to British farmers made in the first tariff deal with Trump, which were hailed as “historic” by Keir Starmer in May, have yet to be signed off by the US despite a looming January deadline.\n\nThe health department said that negotiators were now thrashing out the detailed agreement on the pharmaceutical deal. Asked to provide the headline terms, the department shared its press release hailing the “landmark UK-US pharmaceuticals deal” and a link to the equivalent US government announcement of an “agreement in principle” on pharmaceutical pricing.\n\nCritics have noted that the two releases describe the deal in sharply different terms. The British release describes the UK as “the only country in the world to secure a 0% tariff on pharmaceuticals to the US”, while the American one largely focuses on how the NHS will have to pay 25% more for new medicines.\n\nDavid Henig, a trade expert, said: “There is a serious risk that the UK government has made commitments to raise drug prices in return for nothing more than a verbal promise from President Trump around zero tariffs, when we know he has form for not honouring his word.\n\n“The role of private companies in possibly working with the US administration to coerce the UK government by threatening to withdraw investments is also a big worry. None of this is normal in international trade policy and the government needs to explain both this deal and how such things will be avoided in the future.”\n\nOrdinarily, negotiators would sign a provisional legal text, which would then go through detailed checks on both sides, but none exists yet with the US on pharmaceuticals.\n\nMinisters privately told the Guardian there were concerns that the government’s agreements with the US were flimsy and unreliable.\n\nOne said there was a concern that the UK’s series of agreements with the Trump administration were “built on sand”. Another said this instability was the “new normal now in our relationship across the pond” with “additional layers of volatility and unpredictability in the system”.\n\nLayla Moran, who chairs the health select committee, said: “The only thing more surprising than Trump’s tween-level temper tantrums is the UK government’s naive belief that his administration is a good faith actor. The NHS is too precious to be gambled with and the concern now is whether the deal that could already cost the UK taxpayer billions could end up costing a lot more if it collapses in chaos.”\n\nLiam Byrne, who chairs the business and trade select committee, said ministers had to focus on getting the tech prosperity deal “back on track”.\n\nGovernment figures downplayed the chances of the US reneging on the pharma deal, which took weeks longer to finalise than expected. One source said the US pharmaceutical industry had been pushing for the agreement as they wanted certainty on imports and drug prices, while by comparison the tech prosperity deal “was always quite abstract”.\n\nOfficials admit that, more broadly, volatility is part and parcel of dealing with the Trump administration. But they note that through the deals it has signed, the UK has secured concrete outcomes for businesses.\n\n“The fact we have 25% steel tariffs, and that’s better than the rest of the world, is not flimsy. The same thing with our auto rate,” one official said. “We are in a more competitive position than other major economies.”\n\nIssues have emerged in the implementation of the landmark US-UK tariff deal agreed last May, however, with quotas on beef exports that were due to kick in next month still not formally approved.\n\nTom Bradshaw, the president of the National Farmers’ Union, said: “Our understanding is that the US has not yet signed off the 13,000 reciprocal tariff rate quota. With the US already having access to our beef market for non-hormone treated beef, we are pushing to make sure UK beef producers can access the reciprocal quota from 1 January as agreed.\n\n“This is particularly important as we know there is still great pressure from other sectors of the economy to reopen US negotiations, and that our government is looking at what more can be done with the US. We urge the government to keep pushing to get the reciprocal quota over the line before the end of the year to ensure it can’t continue to be used as a bargaining chip.”\n\nApart from introducing a 10% tariff on most British exports – lower than the rate paid by other countries – the deal was to “remove tariffs on British steel and aluminium, reducing them to zero”. This aspect of the agreement has not materialised, with tariffs on British steel remaining at 25%, although other countries pay a rate of 50%.\n\nOne industry leader said the discussions on steel tariffs “were not going anywhere” but that they considered this week’s bump in the road to be a matter of the “US blustering because of frustration with the UK not moving fast enough in other areas”.\n\nThe US informed the UK it was pausing the tech prosperity deal over wider trade disagreements last week before Peter Kyle, the trade secretary, held meetings with senior US officials in Washington, including commerce secretary Howard Lutnick.\n\nSeveral officials said those meetings were “very positive”. The two sides have agreed to resume negotiations in January.\n\nA government spokesperson said: “Our special relationship with the US remains strong and the trade secretary held talks last week in the US with counterparts to keep up the momentum on implementing all aspects of the UK-US deal so businesses on both sides of the Atlantic continue to feel the benefits.\n\n“We have already delivered 0% tariffs for the UK pharma and aerospace sectors and cut auto tariffs to 10% within quota, saving hundreds of millions of pounds on UK exports, with the US confirming changes via federal notices.\n\n“The UK is also the only country to have avoided 50% steel and aluminium tariffs, but we are committed to going further to secure jobs and creating opportunities for businesses, and at the state visit we unveiled commercial deals creating more than 7,600 high-quality jobs and accelerating growth.”",

    "fullText": "Washington — The House won't vote this week on an extension to the Affordable Care Act's enhanced premium subsidies, which lapse at the end of the year.\n\nAn 11th-hour effort by moderate Republicans to put an extension on the floor for a vote failed Tuesday night, when the House Rules Committee blocked several of the amendments they were seeking to the attach to a GOP health care plan released last week. The GOP plan does not include an extension.\n\nThe committee advanced the bill to the floor late Tuesday. A vote is expected Wednesday.\n\nModerate Republicans are perplexed at the decision not to hold a vote on an extension ahead of the Dec. 31 deadline, and have warned of the political ramifications of allowing insurance premiums to soar in the new year for more than 20 million Americans who buy their insurance on Affordable Care Act marketplaces.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson appeared to shut the door on any amendment votes earlier Tuesday, only to open it slightly after a heated meeting with moderates.\n\n\"We looked for a way to try to allow for that pressure-release valve, and it just was not to be. We worked on it all the way through the weekend,\" Johnson told reporters Tuesday morning.\n\nThe Louisiana Republican later said \"there's some ideas on the table that could work.\"\n\nModerate Republicans expressed their frustration throughout the day.\n\n\"I am pissed for the American people. This is absolute bulls--t,\" Republican Rep. Mike Lawler of New York told reporters after leaving a GOP conference meeting Tuesday morning.\n\nLawler called it a \"tremendous mistake\" not to address the expiring tax credits.\n\n\"The Democrats want to use this as an issue in the election, and seemingly the Republican leadership is going to allow them to do it. And it's idiotic,\" he said.\n\nHe urged all Democrats to sign on to two bipartisan discharge petitions to force votes on legislation to extend the tax credits for one to two years with reforms. But even if the discharge petitions hit the 218-signature threshold needed to force a vote in the coming days, there's a waiting period of seven legislative days before a member can call it up to the floor. The House's last day in session this year is Friday.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, has said that Republicans should offer up the votes on a Democratic discharge petition to extend the tax credits for three years without reforms. It needs to secure the support of four Republicans to force a vote.\n\nGOP Rep. Kevin Kiley of California said he hasn't ruled out supporting Democrats' discharge petition.\n\n\"We waited until the very end of the year to just kind of hastily throw together some narrow package to try to make it look like something's being done about health care when this bill is likely not going to become law and it doesn't address the immediate crisis in front of us, or 22 million people,\" he said of the GOP plan.\n\nDuring Tuesday's Rules Committee meeting, Republican Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania said the only thing worse than an extension without any reforms is no extension at all.\n\nNick Reiner, son of Rob Reiner and his wife Michele, arrested, jail records show\n\nDetails on Nick Reiner's arrest for murders of Rob Reiner and his wife, Michele\n\nWhat we know after Rob and Michele Reiner's son Nick arrested in their deaths",

    "fullText": "House Republicans on Wednesday approved a narrow package designed to lower health care costs for some Americans in the coming years – marking a win for leadership even as some of their own members complain it falls woefully short of tackling rising prices in 2026.\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson and his team were aggressive in pushing their health care plan to the floor this week, vowing it will be the first step of a major GOP agenda on lowering costs next year.\n\nThey are specifically ignoring, however, the issue of the expiring enhanced Obamacare subsidies that were passed during the pandemic to help people afford premium costs. Those tax credits will expire at the end of the month, spiking premiums for tens of millions of Americans next year.\n\nThe House GOP package, instead, would allow small businesses — as well as self-employed people — to band together across industries to buy coverage through association health plans in an effort to lower premiums. It would also, once again, provide federal funding for the cost-sharing subsidies that lower-income Obamacare enrollees receive to reduce their deductibles and out-of-pocket costs for care.\n\nHouse Republicans would also require pharmacy benefit managers, which act as middlemen between drugmakers and insurers or employers, to provide employers with data on the price of drugs, the rebates they receive from manufacturers and other operations.\n\nThe House voted 216-211 to send the measure to the Senate, which is not expected to vote on it before lawmakers leave town for the holiday recess.\n\nThe last-minute health care push from GOP leaders comes at a fraught moment for the party: President Donald Trump is striving to show he is making progress to lower costs for everyday Americans. But his own members are attacking Johnson and other GOP leaders for ignoring the looming Obamacare subsidies cliff, which would raise costs for tens of millions of Americans starting in January.\n\nIf the enhanced subsidies lapse, enrollees will see their annual premium payments increase by 114% — or about $1,000 — on average in 2026, according to KFF, a nonpartisan health policy research group. Roughly 2 million more people are also expected to be uninsured next year if the subsidies end, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The more generous assistance was enacted in 2021 as part of a Biden administration Covid-19 relief package.\n\nA group of GOP centrists have been pressuring Johnson for months to reverse course on the subsidies — pushing bipartisan efforts to extend the subsidies while adding “guardrails” to ensure the dollars are not misused.\n\nBut Johnson has only dug in. Those centrists then decided Wednesday to openly defy Johnson and potentially issue him a humiliating defeat in January by signing onto a Democratic effort to extend the subsidies for three years. That plan from House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries is detested by most Republicans because it includes no reforms.\n\nBut centrists insist they had no other options to keep the money flowing in January – and prevent millions from losing coverage altogether – after party leaders repeatedly blocked their attempts to get a floor vote on the compromise proposals.",

    "fullText": "Another day, another update that's giving investors anxiety about the AI trade.\n\nThe US tech sector was under pressure on Wednesday as traders took in a report from The Financial Times that said Blue Owl Capital wouldn't back a $10 billion data center the company was planning to build in Michigan for OpenAI.\n\nOracle shares led the broader market lower, falling as much as 6% Wednesday. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite shed more than 1%.\n\nHere's where US indexes stood shortly around 1:00 p.m. ET on Wednesday:\n\nHere were the other notable moves in the market:\n\nThe latest developments extend a broader rotation out of the market's most expensive tech stocks and into other parts of the market.\n\nThe enthusiasm for AI has dampened particularly in the past week, Adam Turnquist, the chief technical strategist at LPL Financial, said on Wednesday.\n\n\"Additionally, rotation pressure out of tech has accelerated, with positioning data showing rising demand for smaller-cap and value stocks,\" Turnquist said of the latest market moves.\n\nThe FT's report said that talks between Oracle and Blue Owl Capital stalled over the planned data center. The private credit firm will not move forward with funding the project due to concerns about Oracle's hefty AI spending and growing debts, sources told the outlet.\n\nOracle disputed the contents of the FT report.\n\n\"The FT story is incorrect. Our development partner, Related Digital, selected the best equity partner from a competitive group of options, which in this instance was not Blue Owl. Final negotiations for their equity deal are moving forward on schedule and according to plan,\" Michael Egbert, a spokesperson for Oracle, told Business Insider in an email.\n\nIt's been a rough few months for the AI trade, but particularly for Oracle. After impressing investors with an aggressive revenue forecast, the stock has declined steadily in the last two months as the company stokes more concerns about the large amounts of debt coursing through the AI space. Shares are down 45% from their peak in early September.\n\nOracle recently triggered another sell-off in tech after reporting lower-than-expected earnings and pledging to increase its capital expenditures more than expected in the coming year.\n\nCoreWeave is the other prominent tech name to join Oracle recently as a poster child of investors' growing anxieties about the health of the AI trade. Similar to Oracle, CoreWeave has spooked investors with its high debt load and reliance on a handful of customers. As of Wednesday afternoon, the stock is down 66% from its post-IPO high reached in June.",

    "description": "“I don't even know how it's been approved, to be honest,” said boxing world champ Skye Nicolson.",
    "fullText": "Anthony Joshua will make quick work of Jake Paul when the fighters collide atop a Netflix show at the Kaseya Center in Miami, Florida, this Friday, Dec. 19.\n\nThat’s according to former WBC featherweight world champion and current WBC interim super bantamweight titleholder Skye Nicolson, a Matchroom stablemate of Joshua’s, who told Uncrowned on Tuesday that “it’s going to be very one-sided, and over early, in favor of Anthony Joshua.”\n\nThe fight represents a considerable step-up for Paul, who has feasted mostly on a diet of past-their-prime MMA fighters and journeymen boxers in the boxing ring.\n\nHis sole loss came against Tommy Fury in 2023, but he has since rebounded with visible improvements and wins over Mike Perry, a 58-year-old Mike Tyson, and a 39-year-old Julio Cesar Chavez Jr., the latter of whom is a former middleweight world champion.\n\nRegardless, the gulf in amateur background, skill set and accomplishments between Paul and Joshua, a former two-time heavyweight king, is vast. And Joshua is the heavy betting favorite for a reason.\n\nNicolson commended Paul for his “almost delu-lu confidence” but said she couldn’t “see it going any other way apart from a very one-sided early finish” because “it's [a] scarily dangerous” matchup for Paul.\n\n“I don't even know how it's been approved, to be honest, but I guess money talks,” Nicolson said on Uncrowned's \"The Ariel Helwani Show.\" “We'll see on Friday, but I don't see what Jake's seeing.”\n\nOne of the things Paul perhaps sees is Joshua’s apparent struggles when dealing with fighting smaller heavyweights, as 6-foot-2 fighter Andy Ruiz Jr. shook up the world by upsetting Joshua in 2019, before 6-foot-3 Oleksandr Usyk toppled \"AJ\" in back-to-back bouts in 2022 to 2023.\n\n“Ruiz, Usyk … Jake Paul? There's levels,\" Nicolson said.\n\nShe then reiterated her prediction for the fight, and that it would represent a poor reflection for the sport of boxing if it even went the distance. “If it goes past two rounds, I will be shocked,” she said.\n\nNicolson continued: “I think [Paul's] improved. He works really, really hard. He’s putting his absolute all into it. You can't knock any of the effort, but there are levels. And [Joshua] is not an Olympic gold medalist and a former world champion for nothing. He's naturally huge. And Jake Paul's not. If it goes past two rounds, I will be very shocked.”\n\nNicolson finished by remarking that the only acceptable result for boxing, and for Joshua, is for the Brit to batter Paul. “If he goes the distance with Jake Paul, it’s not good for boxing,” she said.\n\n“It’s good for boxing if he doesn’t kill Jake, obviously, which is possible. But … if it goes eight whole rounds and he doesn’t knock out Jake, that will definitely be tainting to AJ’s legacy.”\n\nThe Paul vs. Joshua main card airs Friday on Netflix from 8 p.m. ET. Join Uncrowned on the night for live results, round-by-round coverage and highlights.",

    "fullText": "Karoline Leavitt’s up-close photo suggests she might be one step closer to a full Mar-a-Lago makeover.\n\nIn Vanity Fair’s bombshell profile of Trump’s inner circle, the 28-year-old White House press secretary, whom the outlet labeled “The Mouthpiece,” seemed to show injection sites along the vermilion border of her lips, a visual nod to the nickname.\n\n“It’s surprising to see somebody’s face have those sort of dark marks,” said Sam Escobar, senior editor of the Daily Beast’s beauty, health, and wellness site, The Looker.\n\n“I do think that they were trying to maybe disguise it a bit,” Escobar pointed out, referring to the lip gloss coating Leavitt’s lips. “Instead, it had the opposite effect, and it just led it to have more of a highlighter effect, and that’s why it looks even more dramatic,” she continued.\n\nSocial media users made similar observations after Vanity Fair posted the close-up photo of Leavitt, taken by photographer Christopher Anderson, to its official Instagram page.\n\n“The injection marks from the lip filler,” one user commented with laughing emojis on the post, with more users chiming in. “Why would they use a pic like this?” another user replied, prompting a third to add: “Intentionally.”\n\nThe Daily Beast has contacted Anderson’s representatives for comment on the photographs, but has received no immediate response.\n\nThe photograph isn’t the first time this month that attention has been given to Leavitt’s lips.\n\nDuring a speech in Pennsylvania earlier this month, President Donald Trump, 79, paused his speech on the economy to comment on Leavitt’s “beautiful face and those lips that don’t stop-op-op-op, like a little machine gun.”\n\nSince Trump’s return to the White House in January, plastic surgeons in Washington, D.C., have said they’ve seen more clients seeking the “Mar-a-Lago face”—a look that board-certified plastic surgeon Dr. Jeffrey Lisiecki told HuffPost is characterized by overfilled cheeks, full lips, and taut, smooth skin, which some say also includes a full face of makeup.\n\nThe Daily Beast has been unable to verify whether any of those accused of having a “Mar-a-Lago face,” including Matt Gaetz, Laura Loomer, Kristi Noem, and now—at an early stage—Leavitt, have turned to plastic surgeons or other cosmetic enhancements.\n\n“She does appear in this interview to have enhanced fullness of her upper and lower lips,” Dr. Jennifer Harrington, a board-certified plastic surgeon and adjunct professor at the University of Minnesota, told the Daily Mail, commenting on Leavitt’s plump-looking lips during a September Fox News interview.\n\nHarrington suspected that the press secretary had lip filler injected, adding that the “subtle” appearance of Leavitt’s lips in the interview clip felt like she had a “natural-looking boost with just 0.5 to 1ml of filler per lip.”\n\n“When you first get your lips done, they can look uneven—it takes a little bit to settle,” said Escobar, noting that “bruising and swelling” can often be present right after lips are injected with filler. “I would be guessing that either it was done recently or she’s just a slow healer,” she added.\n\nIn an interview with The Looker, Dr. Dara Liotta, a double board-certified facial plastic and reconstructive surgeon in New York City, suggested that fillers are best done at least three months before a major event where someone will be photographed—such as a wedding or, in this case, a Vanity Fair photo shoot.\n\n“What I probably would have done is put concealer all over her lips and then use lip liner, and then put dark lipstick on her,” Escobar said.\n\nUnlike Vice President JD Vance, who joked he’d pay “$100 for every person you make look really s--tty compared to me,” on the cover photo of the Vanity Fair issue, Leavitt did not appear to request dark lipstick or concealer.\n\nThe Daily Beast has contacted Leavitt’s representatives for comment regarding the alleged lip injection marks in the photograph, but received no immediate response.",

    "description": "Health insurance costs are expected to rise in 2026 as ACA subsidies expire and new rules take effect. Here's what enrollees need to know.",
    "fullText": "As 2025 comes to a close, Americans are decorating for the holidays and agonizing over which health insurance plan to choose.\n\nThe decisions are complex and personal, as enrollees think about which plans best fit their income and medical needs. And, regardless of whether they have private or public coverage, most households are budgeting for higher costs.\n\nHere's what to know about insurance plans, enrollment deadlines, and policy changes in the new year.\n\nMost Americans have private, employer-sponsored health insurance or a government-based plan. Nearly all of these programs have active enrollment, meaning that people need to \n\nFor Affordable Care Act plans, the enrollment deadline was December 15, with some options to make changes until January 15 for a later coverage start date. The Medicare enrollment deadline for older Americans was December 7. Most coverage begins January 1.\n\nDeadlines for employer-based plans vary, but open enrollment tends to start November 1 and close in late November or early December, with coverage beginning on January 1.\n\nOnce Americans select their 2026 healthcare plan, they generally aren't able to change their coverage until the next open enrollment cycle. Missing open enrollment means you will need to wait until next year to \n\nPeople with qualifying life events, however, can adjust their plan if they file necessary paperwork with the government or their employer at any time throughout the year. Qualifying life events include a marriage, divorce, new baby, move, job loss, or major change of income.\n\nMedicaid rules are different from other insurance plans because it is income based. Americans can enroll in the program on a rolling basis throughout the year if they meet the qualifying criteria.\n\nBoth Medicare and Medicaid are government-based health insurance plans, though they serve different demographics.\n\nMedicare is typically for Americans age 65 and older, many of whom also receive Social Security — though some people with disabilities are also eligible. The program has four main plan types: Parts A and Part B are standalone insurance that cover inpatient and outpatient care; Medicare Advantage allows older Americans to join private plans governed by Medicare rules and out-of-pocket caps; and Part D is supplemental insurance that covers prescription drugs and basic provider visits.\n\nMedicaid is federally-funded health insurance for low-income households. The qualification threshold varies slightly by state, but tends to be based on the poverty line — which is $32,150 for a family of four. Most states have cutoffs between 138% and 260% of that level. These plans typically cover preventative visits, inpatient and outpatient care, and prescription drugs.\n\nIt's possible for low-income older adults to enroll in Medicare and Medicaid at the same time.\n\nSome families and pregnant women who earn above the Medicaid threshold but not enough for private insurance can also enroll in The Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). The requirements are different in every state, but are usually between 170% and 400% of the federal poverty line.\n\nThere are no income limits to enroll in marketplace insurance.\n\nIncome does come into play when deciding whether or not enrollees will receive tax credits that make their marketplace coverage more affordable. Between 2021 and 2025, Americans had access to enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies. These credits lowered care and premium costs for low- and middle-income households based on their proximity to the federal poverty line.\n\nMarketplace insurance will still be available to Americans regardless of income in 2026, though it's likely that Congress will not extend the subsidies beyond their December 31 expiration date. Republican and Democratic senators are meeting this week to discuss the issue and plan to make a final announcement before they leave office on December 18. If the subsidies aren't renewed, it could make the cost of marketplace insurance skyrocket for many low- and middle-income enrollees and some may be priced out of coverage.\n\nEPO plans are often the cheapest option for private coverage, with low or nonexistent premiums. Americans may choose this coverage because it's more affordable to maintain, though the plans tend to be restrictive about care. Enrollees are required to see only in-network providers and may also need to seek in-network emergency care. If someone on an EPO plan sees an out-of-network provider or pharmacist, they're likely to be fully responsible for cost out of pocket.\n\nPPO plans have more flexibility but a higher price tag. The in-network coverage available to enrollees offers more doctor, clinic, and pharmacy options, and allows people to go out of network when needed. Though premiums are more expensive, these plans tend to be a better fit for Americans with chronic health conditions or ongoing prescription needs.\n\nHMO plans usually have a low monthly premium, but enrollees are limited to in-network providers except in emergency situations. These plans are best for older Americans who need preventative care, but don't have chronic conditions and rarely need to see a specialist. These plans are also common among older Americans with Medicare Advantage.\n\nAmericans aren't able to change their health coverage between EPO, PPO, or HMO plans once open enrollment ends, except if they have a qualifying life event.\n\nCosts for both private and public health insurance are expected to rise in the new year. This is due to a combination of factors: ACA subsidies are set to expire for marketplace plans, President Donald Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act is set to limit Medicaid funding, and the price of private health insurance is rising for companies — a burden that many are partially passing to employees.\n\nThough actual cost changes will vary widely, it's likely that Americans will experience higher premiums and deductibles for care going forward.",

    "description": "Brands like Ballerina Farm, Beam, and CocoaVia are selling \"healthier\" hot cocoa, optimizing with supplements for heart health, gut health, and sleep.",
    "fullText": "There's no shortage of ways to boost your longevity — even during peak holiday season.\n\nOver the past month, I've heard more and more whispers of optimized hot cocoa. Online, influencers swear by nighttime hot cocoa from MoonBrew and Beam, containing magnesium, l-theonine, and reishi to promote deeper sleep. Brands like CocoaVia and Black Forest sell cocoa flavanol powder, a cocoa compound said to boost heart health. Just Ingredients' hot chocolate, meanwhile, boasts being sugar-free and includes collagen, ashwaganda, and lion's mane for \"added benefits.\" Ballerina Farm recently launched a \"bone broth hot cocoa\" with protein, collagen, and amino acids — purportedly to help with everything from gut to joint health.\n\nPart of the appeal is the process of stirring a cozy drink instead of popping another multivitamin. \"You're creating an experience out of your supplement,\" Jordan Glenn, the head of science at SuppCo, a supplement tracking company, told Business Insider.\n\nWhile drinking a multi-supplement concoction can feel like a fun solution to capsule fatigue, he said it doesn't necessarily make the most sense, from a health standpoint. Supplement-infused hot cocoa can be pricey — some breaking down to about $2 a cup — with lower-than-recommended doses of the supplements in question.\n\nI'll go even further and say: let holiday treats be holiday treats.\n\nYes, it's always good to cut down on sugar, and yes, the average Swiss Miss hot chocolate contains a few emulsifiers I'd rather not think about. But in the grand scheme of your health, concrete research shows it's better to have the occasional sugar-bomb hot cocoa (mini marshmallows and all) than knock back a cup of the \"healthy\" stuff every night.\n\nBecause cacao beans have high levels of heart-healthy antioxidants and flavanols, dark chocolate (the kind with the least sugar) was promoted as a health food for years.\n\nMany headlines missed the nuances — primarily that relying on chocolate for nutrients isn't a good idea. \"I don't think anybody is going to eat enough chocolate to bring their cholesterol and blood pressure down without doing a lot of other damage to blood sugar, weight, and things like that,\" Lauren Gilstrap, MD, a cardiologist at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Health Center, previously told Business Insider.\n\nFurthermore, she said that the healthiest dark chocolate contains an 80% or more concentration of cacao — more of a bitter brick than a Godiva truffle.\n\nIf one is determined to chug goblets of 90% pure cacao for the sake of lowering their biological age, they're free to try. But there are other downsides to painstakingly fixating on longevity.\n\nIt's a problem Dr. Steven Austad, the scientific director of a nonprofit researching healthy aging, has increasingly noticed in his field. \"If you spend all your time thinking about how long you're going to live, you kind of forget to live,\" he previously told Business Insider.\n\nOverall, Glenn said that most of the aforementioned hot chocolate powders are fine to take at the recommended doses because, again, they already contain low levels of each supplement.\n\nHe said that out of all the hot chocolates, Ballerina Farm's appeared to be the only one with added sugar — something to consider for those trying to cut back.\n\nThe only cocoa Glenn advised thinking about was the powder from Beam, which contains melatonin and is marketed as a nightly supplement.\n\n\"Psychologically, people can be like, 'well, if I don't have this, I can't sleep well,'\" he said. \"I don't recommend people take melatonin every day, I don't think that's a good idea.\" Beam did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nHe said the biggest question to ask yourself is what problem you're trying to fix, and how the supplement will help. Otherwise, you fall into the trap of over-optimizing — or just wasting money.\n\n\"There's this longevity boom right now,\" he said. \"'If you're not doing infrared and sauna and cold baths and have a 15-supplement stack, you're probably going to die tomorrow.' We kind of lose the plot.\"\n\nThe great news is you don't need to drink optimized hot cocoa for better health (unless you genuinely love the flavor).\n\nPlenty of centenarians drink alcohol and eat sweets, both in moderation. The more meaningful secrets to a long life are less about scrutinizing your hot chocolate ingredients and more about the basics: exercising regularly, eating as many whole foods as you can, getting enough sleep, and spending time with loved ones.\n\nGlenn echoed the same, noting that supplements can only provide \"micro benefits\" to an already healthy lifestyle.\n\n\"If you're trying to use this hot cocoa supplement because you're staying up till 3:00 AM streaming Netflix and you feel sleepy, that's not how it works,\" he said.\n\nSo have that powdered hot chocolate that brings you back to your childhood snow days, before you had an airtight morning routine. Better yet: clink that mug with a friend.",

    "fullText": "(This is an excerpt of the Health Rounds newsletter, where we present latest medical studies on Tuesdays and Thursdays)\n\nDec 17 (Reuters) - Applying an insecticide treatment used for soldiers’ uniforms to the cloths used to carry babies significantly reduced incidence of malaria in the ​children, researchers found.\n\nThe six-month study conducted in regions of Uganda where malaria is endemic included 400 mothers and their babies, ages 6 ‌months to 18 months. Half were randomly assigned to use cotton cloth wraps treated with Sawyer Products’ permethrin, while the others received cloths treated with plain water as a control group. ‌The wraps underwent retreatment every 4 weeks.\n\nAll of the pairs received insecticide-treated sleeping nets.\n\nThe permethrin-treated baby wraps reduced malaria cases in infants by 66%, according to a report of the study published in The New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nAdverse events were mild, and the frequency was low and similar in the treatment group and the sham group, the report said.\n\n“Given the anticipated duration and frequency of use... extended follow-up of children, particularly for neurodevelopmental effects of permethrin exposure, is needed,” the researchers ⁠acknowledge.\n\n“Yet malaria, both severe and uncomplicated forms, can cause ‌long-term cognitive impairment, and a careful weighing of potential risks and benefits will be required.”\n\nAI REQUIRES NUANCED TRAINING TO FIND CANCER IN LOWER-RISK GROUPS\n\nTwo recent studies highlight the potential for artificial intelligence tools to be less accurate in some patients ‍than others, if the tools are not trained properly.\n\nIt’s well known that if AI tools are trained on data collected from unequal proportions of patients from various demographic groups, they have a harder time making an accurate diagnosis in minority groups that aren’t well-represented in the training set.\n\nBut in the current analysis, the models sometimes performed worse in ​one demographic group even when the sample sizes were comparable, researchers reported in Cell Reports Medicine.\n\nThe reason may be that some cancers are more ‌common in certain groups, so the models become better at making a diagnosis in those groups. As a result, the models may have difficulty diagnosing cancers in populations where they aren’t as common, the researchers discovered.\n\nIn addition, subtle molecular differences may exist in biopsy samples from different demographic groups, and AI may detect those differences and use them as a proxy for cancer type, potentially making it less effective at diagnosis in populations in which these mutations are less common.\n\n“We found that because AI is so powerful, it can differentiate many obscure biological signals that cannot be detected by standard human evaluation,” study ⁠leader Kun-Hsing Yu of Harvard Medical School said in a statement.\n\nAs a result, the models ​may pick up signals that are more related to demographics than disease - and inferring demographic ​information from pathology slides could affect their diagnostic ability across groups.\n\nTogether, Yu said, these explanations suggest that bias in pathology AI stems not only from the variable quality of the training data but also from how researchers train the models.\n\nWhen his ‍team applied a new framework to the ⁠models they'd tested, it reduced the diagnostic disparities by some 88%, they said.\n\n“We show that by making this small adjustment, the models can learn robust features that make them more generalizable and fairer across different populations,” Yu said.\n\nThe finding is encouraging, he added, because it suggests ⁠that bias can be reduced even without training the models on completely fair, representative data.\n\nIn a separate study published in PLOS Biology, researchers found that even with broad samples of bacterial ‌populations, bias may be blocking the potential of AI to predict and combat antibiotic resistance.\n\n(To receive the full newsletter in your ‌inbox for free",

    "description": "The startup aims to fully automate front-office healthcare tasks for independent provider groups with AI.",
    "fullText": "When Valerie Health CEO Peter Shalek demos his product to clinicians, he has an unusual pitch: \"This is a weird demo, because you'll never have to use this software.\"\n\nValerie Health, which Shalek cofounded alongside Uber Health founder Nitin Joshi, aims to fully automate time-consuming front-office tasks in healthcare, such as referrals and patient scheduling.\n\nIt's taking over those tasks for independent provider groups, a focus that's helping the startup rack up new revenue — and new venture funding.\n\nValerie Health just raised $30 million in Series A funding led by Redpoint Ventures, the company said Tuesday. The raise brings Valerie Health's total funding to $39 million since its 2024 founding.\n\nShalek said Valerie Health is already working with several of the nation's largest independent provider groups, in areas ranging from urology and podiatry to cardiology.\n\nAcross specialties, the front-office challenges for provider groups are often the same, Shalek said: juggling patient intakes and follow-ups against a backlog of referrals.\n\nThose administrative burdens and related financial pressures can lead provider groups to be acquired by hospitals or consolidated by private equity firms. But those deals can mean higher costs for patients and lower satisfaction for the clinicians impacted. Shalek wants Valerie Health to help providers thrive independently.\n\n\"I think that there's an opportunity to make it so that independent practice is the easiest, the highest quality, the most profitable place to deliver care, which is really the core mission we have,\" he said.\n\nValerie Health takes over tasks for healthcare front offices with its own employees in the loop to review the software's autonomous actions.\n\nShalek said Valerie Health helps practices grow, too, by processing new and existing patients faster to increase the volume of patients coming in by 5% to 7% on average.\n\nThe startup has plenty of competition. More companies are setting out to automate administrative tasks for hospitals and healthcare practices, such as the Andreessen Horowitz-backed startup Tennr, which raised $101 million in Series C funding in June at a $605 million valuation to focus on automating patient referrals.\n\nShalek said Valerie Health is bringing in business through its singular focus on independent provider groups and its ability to automate tasks without healthcare practices lifting a finger.\n\n\"It takes a lot of work from our side, but it allows us to just solve these problems for our customers without saying, here's another piece of software for you to train your staff on. That's the last thing these practices want. They just want us to do the work,\" he said.\n\nValerie Health wants to move fast as the market fills. Shalek said the startup is focused on grabbing more customers next year while continuing to build front-office solutions, such as voice AI agents for patient follow-ups. Valerie Health started selling its tech earlier this year; its revenue tripled last quarter from the previous quarter alone, and given the customers already in its pipeline plus the demand it's seeing in the market, Shalek said he expects revenue to grow six to seven times next year.\n\nThe startup is also hiring across its teams, including engineering, product, and sales. Joshi also spent two years as an engineering manager at fintech startup Stripe, so Shalek said Valerie Health has been able to bring over talent from both Stripe and Uber as it expands.",

    "fullText": "Dallas' local government just made it harder to vape in shared spaces, and that's good news for community health, reported FOX 4 News.\n\nThe city is widening its smoking rules to include e-cigarettes starting December 11, prohibiting vaping indoors, near building doorways, and throughout parks.\n\nCity council members approved the policy change late last year after health organizations urged action. The American Heart Association and Dallas County Medical Society were among groups pushing for new rules.\n\nFines for vaping in off-limits areas can reach $500 for each violation. Officials said they will respond to complaints and hand out citations after confirming reported incidents.\n\nSome exceptions apply to private homes, theatrical performances, licensed cigar lounges, smoking-permitted hotel rooms, and certain outdoor spaces including patios at restaurants and courses at golf clubs.\n\nWhen someone vapes, the device produces a mist carrying tiny particles that drift toward others nearby. Health professionals informed lawmakers that secondhand vapor exposure has ties to cancer and respiratory problems resembling asthma. The city's Office of Environmental Quality noted that PM2.5 particles emitted by e-cigarettes have been linked to birth defects.\n\nIn addition to negative impacts on air quality, the boom in disposable vaping has added another stream of hard-to-recycle waste to an already strained system. Disposable vapes have become a top contributor to plastic waste and electronic trash, and each device contains lithium batteries that pose fire hazards when tossed in regular garbage.\n\nMillions of these single-use products end up in landfills each year, where they leach toxic chemicals into soil and water.\n\n\"As we know, vaping is a serious public health matter impacting our youth and most vulnerable,\" said Kathy Stewart, a council member. \"I am pleased about the vote to enact these amendments.\"\n\nRenee Roberson, a nurse at a local school who serves as District 8 environmental commissioner, shared what she's witnessed firsthand.\n\n\"It rewires the kids into something negative,\" she said. \"Kids who are bright, then their focus becomes the vaping.\"\n\nDo you think cigarettes should be illegal?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": "You know the old adage about breakfast being the most important meal of the day? Experts say it has some merit when it comes to heart health.",
    "fullText": "Reviewed by Dietitian Sarah Pflugradt, Ph.D., RDN, CSCS\n\nThe morning habit that can spike your cholesterol levels over time is skipping breakfast.\n\nIt can throw off your circadian rhythm, decrease your diet quality and cause overeating.\n\nGo for a breakfast high in fiber and protein, move your body and minimize stress daily.\n\nYou might think your mornings are healthy—but certain daily rituals could quietly raise your cholesterol over time. We interviewed heart health experts to reveal the surprising morning habit that can affect your heart, plus simple swaps to protect it. Turns out, it’s something about 15% of US adults do on any given day!\n\nWe’re talking about skipping breakfast. Studies consistently show that skipping breakfast is linked with higher cholesterol levels, even when it leads to modest weight loss. There are a few reasons for this, which we’re diving into below.\n\nSkipping breakfast can throw off your circadian rhythm—your body’s internal clock. One of the many things that your circadian rhythm controls is lipid metabolism. When your body’s internal clock is thrown off, it may alter some genes and enzymes that regulate your cholesterol. “Without that morning meal, the liver’s HMG-CoA reductase enzyme, which controls the rate of cholesterol production, becomes more active, producing more LDL and total cholesterol,” says Michelle Routhenstein, M.S., RD, CDCES, CDN.\n\nEating breakfast, on the other hand, can help prevent cholesterol spikes that typically happen when you wake up. “Normally, cholesterol synthesis peaks in the early morning, but eating breakfast provides nutrients that help buffer this process,” says Routhenstein.\n\nIf you find yourself mindlessly snacking on high-carb or high-fat foods throughout the day, skipping breakfast may be the underlying cause. “Skipping breakfast can trigger metabolic shifts that increase cholesterol production and may also cause overeating later in the day,” says cardiologist, Dr. Randy Gould.\n\nThis is in part because of shifts in hormones that regulate appetite. “Prolonged morning fasting can alter hormones like leptin and ghrelin, increasing hunger and promoting insulin resistance,” says Routhenstein. “This combination can impair your body’s ability to clear cholesterol from the blood, further contributing to higher LDL cholesterol,” she adds. Your body experiences rebound hunger because its nutrient needs were not met earlier in the day.\n\nThat said, research results are mixed as to whether skipping breakfast actually leads you to eat more throughout the day. Some studies have found that skipping breakfast leads to a lower overall calorie intake. Still, studies consistently find worse cholesterol levels in people who skip breakfast, whether or not they eat more calories throughout the day.\n\nDelaying your first meal of the day may also affect the overall quality of your diet. “Skipping breakfast often leads to larger, less nutrient-dense meals later in the day,” says Routhenstein. These meals may be higher in saturated fat and refined carbs, which “directly contribute to more LDL particle formation and reduce the protective effects of HDL cholesterol,” she adds.\n\nOne study found that kids who skip breakfast tend to eat more fat and sodium throughout the day than kids who eat breakfast. This is notable because eating excess saturated fat and sodium can harm heart health. Plus, skipping breakfast may make it harder to eat enough whole grains—sources of high-quality carbs, fiber and minerals—particularly in the U.S. where whole grain cereals are common breakfast foods.\n\nAnother study found that Australian adults who ate a big breakfast consumed more fiber, vitamins and minerals throughout the day than those who skipped it. They also consumed less added sugars, saturated fats and alcohol, which can all negatively affect heart health.\n\nBesides eating breakfast, there are a few things you can do to transform your morning routine into a tool to lower your cholesterol. The best part? They can be done in a relatively short amount of time! If you currently wake up and rush out the door with no self-care time, focus on adding one thing at a time instead of overhauling your morning routine overnight.\n\nDelay screen time. If you reach for your phone first thing in the morning, try to delay this as much as you can. It may seem unrelated to heart health, but Routhenstein notes how checking messages, notifications or the news can increase stress and start your day on a negative foot. “Taking 10 to 30 minutes screen-free to start your day helps reduce stress, improves mood and allows you to take control of your day and prioritize your health,” says Routhenstein.\n\nEat a balanced breakfast. Now you know that eating breakfast is important for heart health, but what you eat also matters. Experts recommend heart-healthy foods rich in fiber and low in added sugars and saturated fat. “Starting the day with a balanced breakfast—such as oatmeal, whole grains, lean protein and fresh fruit—helps stabilize energy and avoid the cholesterol-raising effects of sugary cereals and drinks,” says Dr. Gould.\n\nGet in some movement. “A brief period of movement, whether a brisk walk, stretching or light strength training, can improve circulation and support healthy cholesterol levels,” says Dr. Gould. In fact, physical activity is recommended as a first-line approach to managing high cholesterol. So go for a morning stroll, hit the gym or get in a quick stretch when you wake up.\n\nTake time to destress. Diet and exercise aren’t the only things that influence heart health—stress also plays a big role. “Stress triggers the release of cortisol, a hormone that can raise cholesterol production, and it may also lead to unhealthy coping habits like overeating,” says Dr. Gould. Especially if you live a high-stress lifestyle, take a few minutes (or more!) in the morning to destress, whether through movement, breathwork, journaling or anything else that works for you!\n\nAs tempting as it may be to rush out the door without eating a balanced breakfast, this habit could silently raise your cholesterol. Heart health experts recommend eating a high-fiber, high-protein morning meal that’s low in added sugars and saturated fat. This helps stabilize your energy levels, buffer the liver’s production of cholesterol and prevent overeating later in the day. In addition to eating a nutritious breakfast, try to take time to move and destress at the start of your day instead of checking your phone to prevent cholesterol-raising cortisol spikes.",

    "fullText": "The ATP men's tennis tour will introduce an extreme heat policy from 2026 after criticism from players who sweltered through some tournaments this year.\n\nThe move brings the ATP into line with the women's WTA tour, which has a long-standing policy, and sports such as Formula One which has its own measures to protect drivers.\n\nIn October, Danish tennis star Holger Rune called temperatures of more than 30C and humidity soaring past 80 percent at the Shanghai Masters \"brutal\".\n\n\"Do you want a player to die on court?\" Rune was heard to ask as he wilted in the fierce conditions.\n\nThe ATP has now acted, saying on Monday it was \"strengthening protections for players competing in extreme conditions\".\n\nThe new rules are based on the Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT), which measures air temperature, humidity, wind speed and other factors to estimate heat stress.\n\nUnder the measures, a player can request a 10-minute cooling break in best-of-three singles matches if the WBGT reaches 30.1 degrees or higher during the first two sets.\n\nPlay will be suspended when the WBGT exceeds 32.2 degrees.\n\n\"The new heat rule provides a structured, medically supported approach to managing extreme heat, with the objective of safeguarding player health,\" the ATP said.\n\nIt added it will \"also improve conditions for spectators, officials, ball persons and tournament staff\".\n\nThe rules do not apply to the four Grand Slams, which have their own policies.\n\nPreviously, decisions over weather conditions, including heat, were down to the on-site ATP supervisor in coordination with medical teams and local organisers.\n\nThe planet is on track to log its second hottest year on record in 2025, Europe's global warming monitor said last week.",

    "fullText": "Analysts say benefits could be felt in under-resourced rural hospitals but warn against AI as a cost-cutting measure\n\nFor states to receive certain funding stipulated in the Trump administration’s “big, beautiful” bill, they must meet three of 10 criteria – including integrating more artificial intelligence (AI) technology in healthcare settings – which experts say could have major benefits and liabilities for under-resourced hospitals, depending on how it’s implemented.\n\nThe Rural Health Transformation Fund is a carveout that will provide $50bn over a period of five years to states who meet certain application criteria, including “consumer-facing, technology-driven solutions for the prevention and management of chronic diseases,” and “providing training and technical assistance for the development and adoption of technology-enabled solutions that improve care delivery in rural hospitals, including remote monitoring, robotics, artificial intelligence, and other advanced technologies”.\n\nAnalysts have noted that this $50bn will not be nearly enough to make up for the Congressional Budget Office’s projected $911bn reduction in Medicaid spending over the next decade under the bill (Obba). These cuts will affect both patients who lose free health coverage under Medicaid, and hospitals who benefit from those patients’ Medicaid reimbursements.\n\nChenhao Tan, associate professor of data science at the University of Chicago, and Karni Chagal-Feferkorn, an assistant professor at the University of South Florida’s college of AI and cybersecurity, said AI technology could provide major benefits to rural hospitals that are frequently under-resourced and under-staffed. They also agreed that AI has the potential to alleviate the administrative burden that physicians at these hospitals often face.\n\nPhysicians are responsible for taking detailed notes on patient visits and compiling them for electronic health records systems – a task that can take eight hours or more each week, according to the American Medical Association.\n\nA recent study found that AI generated patient notes are similar in quality to those of general physicians, but worse than those of expert physicians. Tan said that it’s important to take context – like frequent physician burnout in rural hospitals – into account when evaluating risks and benefits.\n\n“If the baseline is tired human doctors, then I think it is even easier to make an argument that AI may do better than them,” Tan said.\n\nChagal-Feferkorn hopes that AI can help alleviate rural hospital staffing issues, not only by reducing the workload but by attracting more doctors.\n\n“If the equipment is state-of-the-art, and they feel that much of the burdensome work is done by AI, I think this could be one incentive for physicians to go work in rural areas, this might have a great impact,” she said.\n\nThe FDA currently regulates AI technologies that are intended to evaluate and diagnose health conditions because they are considered medical devices. However, technologies that simply transcribe and compile patient notes are not regulated, though they may market themselves as Hipaa compliant.\n\nWhile Tan said it would be too high a bar to expect these technologies to be “bulletproof” before they can enter the market, he acknowledged that “there should be something higher than nothing,” in terms of regulatory requirements.\n\nChagal-Feferkorn also said that the proliferation of AI also creates additional cybersecurity concerns.\n\n“AI makes it easier for ordinary people to hack systems,” she said, adding that AI has the potential to improve patient safety by merging patient records from different providers so that, for example, every provider is aware of every medication that a patient is taking and can thus easily avoid dangerous medication interactions.\n\nBut this kind of technology will also require more privacy precautions.\n\n“The more data sharing there is, obviously the risk for data security breach is larger,” Chagal-Feferkorn continued.\n\nTo mitigate these risks, Tan said “worker upscaling needs to go hand in hand” with the adoption of AI technology. But Tan and Chagal-Feferkorn both expressed concern that under-resourced hospitals will attempt to adopt AI technology as a cost-cutting measure without the necessary staff and safety infrastructure.",

    "fullText": "DOUANKARA, Mauritania (AP) — The girl lay in a makeshift health clinic, her eyes glazed over and her mouth open, flies resting on her lips. Her chest barely moved. Drops of fevered sweat trickled down her forehead as medical workers hurried around her, attaching an IV drip.\n\nIt was the last moment to save her life, said Bethsabee Djoman Elidje, the women's health manager, who led the clinic's effort as the heart monitor beeped rapidly. The girl had an infection after a sexual assault, Elidje said, and had been in shock, untreated, for days.\n\nHer family said the 14-year-old had been raped by Russian fighters who burst into their tent in Mali two weeks earlier. The Russians were members of Africa Corps, a new military unit under Russia's defense ministry that replaced the Wagner mercenary group six months ago.\n\nMen, women and children have been sexually assaulted by all sides during Mali's decade-long conflict, the U.N. and aid workers say, with reports of gang rape and sexual slavery. But the real toll is hidden by a veil of shame that makes it difficult for women from conservative, patriarchal societies to seek help.\n\nThe silence that nearly killed the 14-year-old also hurts efforts to hold perpetrators accountable.\n\nThe AP learned of the alleged rape and four other alleged cases of sexual violence blamed on Africa Corps fighters, commonly described by Malians as the “white men,” while interviewing dozens of refugees at the border about other abuses such as beheadings and abductions.\n\nOther combatants in Mali have been blamed for sexual assaults. The head of a women’s health clinic in the Mopti area told the AP it had treated 28 women in the last six months who said they had been assaulted by militants with the al-Qaida affiliated JNIM, the most powerful armed group in Mali.\n\nThe silence among Malian refugees has been striking.\n\nIn eastern Congo, which for decades has faced violence from dozens of armed groups, “we didn’t have to look for people,” said Mirjam Molenaar, the medical team leader in the border area for Doctors Without Borders, or MSF, who was stationed there last year. The women \"came in huge numbers.”\n\nIt's different here, she said: “People undergo these things and they live with it, and it shows in post-traumatic stress.\"\n\nThe aunt of the 14-year-old girl said the Africa Corps fighters marched everyone outside at gunpoint. The family couldn't understand what they wanted. The men made them watch as they tied up the girl’s uncle and cut off his head.\n\nThen two of the men took the 14-year-old into the tent as she tried to defend herself, and raped her. The family waited outside, unable to move.\n\n“We were so scared that we were not even able to scream anymore,” the aunt recalled, as her mother sobbed quietly next to her. She, like other women, spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation, and the AP does not name victims of rape unless they agree to be named.\n\nThe girl emerged over a half-hour later, looking terrified. Then she saw her uncle's body and screamed. She fainted. When she woke up, she had the eyes of someone “who was no longer there,” the aunt said.\n\nThe next morning, JNIM militants came and ordered the family to leave. They piled onto a donkey cart and set off toward the border. At any sound, they hid in the bushes, holding their breath.\n\nThe girl's condition deteriorated during the three-day journey. When they arrived in Mauritania, she collapsed.\n\nThe AP came across her lying on the ground in the courtyard of a local family. Her family said they had not taken her to a clinic because they had no money.\n\n“If you have nothing, how can you bring someone to a doctor?” the girl’s grandmother said between sobs. The AP took the family to a free clinic run by MSF. A doctor said the girl had signs of being raped.\n\nThe clinic had been functioning for barely a month and had seen three survivors of sexual violence, manager Elidje said.\n\n“We are convinced that there are many cases like this,\" she said. \"But so far, very few patients come forward to seek treatment because it’s still a taboo subject here. It really takes time and patience for these women to open up and confide in someone so they can receive care. They only come when things have already become complicated, like the case we saw today.”\n\nAs Elidje tried to save the girl's life, she asked the family to describe the incident. She did not speak Arabic and asked the local nurse to find out how many men carried out the assault. But the nurse was too ashamed to ask.\n\nScratch marks are part of story she could not tell\n\nThousands of new refugees from Mali, mostly women and children, have settled just inside Mauritania in recent weeks, in shelters made of fabric and branches. The nearest refugee camp is full, complicating efforts to treat and report sexual assaults.\n\nTwo recently arrived women discreetly pulled AP journalists aside, adjusting scarves over their faces. They said they had arrived a week ago after armed white men came to their village.\n\n“They took everything from us. They burned our houses. They killed our husbands,” one said. “But that’s not all they did. They tried to rape us.”\n\nThe men entered the house where she was by herself and undressed her, she said, adding that she defended herself “by the grace of Allah.”\n\nAs she spoke, the second woman started crying and trembling. She had scratch marks on her neck. She was not capable of telling her story.\n\n“We are still terrified by what we went through,” she said.\n\nSeparately, a third woman said that what the white men did to her in Mali last month when she was alone at home “stays between God and me.”\n\nA fourth said she watched several armed white men drag her 18-year-old daughter into their house. She fled and has not seen her daughter again.\n\nThe women declined the suggestion to speak with aid workers, some of whom are locals. They said they were not ready to talk about it with anyone else.\n\nRussia’s Defense Ministry did not respond to questions, but an information agency that the U.S. State Department has called part of the “Kremlin’s disinformation campaign” called the AP’s investigation into Africa Corps fake news.\n\nWagner has a legacy of sexual abuse\n\nAllegations of rapes and other sexual assaults were already occurring before Wagner transformed into Africa Corps.\n\nOne refugee told the AP she witnessed a mass rape in her village in March 2024.\n\n“The Wagner group burned seven men alive in front of us with gasoline.” she said. Then they gathered the women and raped them, she said, including her 70-year-old mother.\n\n“After my mother was raped, she couldn’t bear to live,” she said. Her mother died a month later.\n\nIn the worst-known case of sexual assault involving Russian fighters in Africa, the U.N. in a 2023 report said at least 58 women and girls had been raped or sexually assaulted in an attack on Moura village by Malian troops and others that witnesses described as “armed white men.\"\n\nIn response, Mali’s government expelled the U.N. peacekeeping mission. Since then, gathering accurate data on the ground about conflict-related sexual violence has become nearly impossible.\n\nThe AP interviewed five of the women from Moura, who now stay in a displacement camp. They said they had been blindfolded and raped for hours by several men.\n\nThree of the women said they hadn't spoken about it to anyone apart from aid workers. The other two dared to tell their husbands, months later.\n\n“I kept silent with my family for fear of being rejected or looked at differently. It’s shameful,” one said.\n\nThe 14-year-old whose family fled to Mauritania is recovering. She said she cannot remember anything since the attack. Her family and MSF said she is speaking to a psychiatrist — one of just six working in the country.\n\nAid workers are worried about others who never say a thing.\n\n“It seems that conflict over the years gets worse and worse and worse. There is less regard for human life, whether it’s men, women or children,” said MSF’s Molenaar, and broke into tears. “It’s a battle.”\n\nFor more on Africa and development: https://apnews.com/hub/africa-pulse\n\nThe Associated Press receives financial support for global health and development coverage in Africa from the Gates Foundation.

    "description": "Kent State trustees also approved a new deal with NEOMED to provide campus health services.",
    "fullText": "Kent State University is dropping 19 undergraduate degree programs with low enrollment to comply with Ohio's Senate Bill 1.\n\nUnder the law, which became effective in June, state colleges are now required to “eliminate any undergraduate degree program it offers if the institution confers an average of fewer than five degrees in the program annually over any three-year period,\" according to Kent State officials.\n\nOn Dec. 11, Kent State University’s Board of Trustees agreed to eliminate the programs, with this fall being the final admission. All currently enrolled students are receiving individualized advising and teach-out plans to ensure timely degree completion.\n\nThe degree programs being dropped effective fall 2026 include:\n\nThe Africana Studies major within the Bachelor of Arts degree.\n\nThe Chemistry major within the Bachelor of Arts degree.\n\nThe Classics major within the Bachelor of Arts degree.\n\nThe Community Health Education major within the Bachelor of Science degree.\n\nThe Dance and Dance Studies majors within the Bachelor of Fine Arts degree.\n\nThe Earth Science majors within both the Bachelor of Arts and the Bachelor of Science Education degrees.\n\nThe French major within the Bachelor of Arts degree.\n\nThe Horticulture major within the Bachelor of Applied Horticulture degree, and the Horticulture Technology major within the Associate of Applied Science degree.\n\nThe Life Science major and the Life Science/Chemistry major within the Bachelor of Science Education degrees.\n\nThe Mathematics major within the Bachelor of Arts degree.\n\nThe Physical Science major within the Bachelor of Science Education degree.\n\nThe Physics major within the Bachelor of Arts degree.\n\nThe Radiologic Technology major within the Associate of Technical Study degree.\n\nThe Respiratory Care major within the Bachelor of Science degree.\n\nThe School Health Education major within the Bachelor of Science Education degree.\n\nKent State will continue to offer related degrees or credentials in several areas under different program headings, according to university officials. For example, the Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics will sunset, but the Bachelor of Science in Mathematics continues to serve students in that field of study.\n\nFor Chemistry, Mathematics, Physics and Radiologic Technology, the university will maintain other degree options at the associate or bachelor’s degree level.\n\nFor Africana Studies, Classics, Dance, Earth Science, French and Horticulture, the university will continue to offer undergraduate minors or certificates.\n\nKent State also will maintain teacher education bachelor’s degree programs in science and health fields that align with the inactivated programs.\n\nThe board also approved a strategic partnership with NEOMED Clinical Services LLC to take over Kent State's student health services.\n\nThe board authorized the university to enter into a lease and health center services agreement with NEOMED Clinical Services, establishing a collaborative arrangement to provide comprehensive clinical care and preventive services on campus.\n\nNEOMED occupies about 10,500 square feet of space on the lower floor of the DeWeese Health Center to provide expanded clinical services, health education and outreach programs.\n\nThe three-year agreement begins July 1, 2026, with the option for two one-year renewals. NEOMED will provide all staffing for the health center services and will work cooperatively with Kent State’s Division of People, Culture and Belonging to offer retention to qualified employees.\n\nIn addition, the board approved a Student Health Fee effective fall 2026. Full-time undergraduate and graduate students will be assessed $90 per semester, while part-time students will pay $35 per semester.\n\nThe fee excludes College Credit Plus students, students enrolled in fully online programs, dissertation students and students enrolled at the College of Podiatric Medicine.\n\nIn other business, the board approved a six-year comprehensive capital plan for Fiscal Years 2027-32, identifying campus upgrade projects that are the most important to the institution.\n\nThe plan primarily includes projects funded by state capital appropriations and does not list projects solely financed by local funding or philanthropy.\n\nThe Ohio Office of Budget and Management requires that each state college submit a six-year capital plan.\n\nProjects for the first two years of the plan include:\n\nThe third phase of the renovation of White Hall on the Kent Campus will replace antiquated heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) equipment to the remaining floors along with planned classroom and interior building improvements.\n\nTower renovations in University Library on the Kent Campus.\n\nContinued critical deferred maintenance of the aging infrastructure on the Kent Campus.\n\nInformation technology network access enhancements in academic buildings on the Kent Campus.\n\nThe second phase of Purinton Hall classroom renovations on the East Liverpool Campus.\n\nMain Classroom Building HVAC replacement on the Salem Campus.\n\nThe second phase of central chiller plant replacement on the Stark Campus.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Record-Courier: Kent State will eliminate 19 undergrad programs in fall 2026",

    "title": "‘Tragedy in the making’: Top healthcare exec on why insurance will spike to subsidize a tax cut to millionaires and billionaires",
    "description": "\"If the two sides could talk,\" said UConn Health chair John Driscoll, \"there probably is a way that they could agree on how to to bridge the difference.\"",
    "fullText": "Top healthcare executive John Driscoll calls the looming expiration of enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies “a tragedy in the making,” warning that millions of Americans are about to be hit with higher premiums, lost coverage, and rising medical debt as Washington gridlock hardens.\n\nDriscoll, who is currently the chairman of UConn Health after a 25-year career in health care including a previous position as Walgreens Boots Alliance president, said the policy reversal amounts to “a self‑inflicted wound” that will push costs up for both low‑income families and the affluent professionals who thought they were insulated.​\n\nDriscoll cited CBO estimates that if Congress allows the subsidies to lapse, premiums will jump for roughly 24 million marketplace enrollees, and around 2 million people will lose coverage entirely in the near term.\n\n“You don’t solve higher health care costs with fewer people getting insured,” he told Fortune, arguing that the system will simply reprice risk and shift costs onto everyone else. “Whenever you reduce coverage at the bottom, everybody pays \n\nEnhanced premium tax credits, introduced during the pandemic and extended through 2025, have helped double marketplace enrollment and kept average subsidized premiums under about $900 a year. When they expire, KFF News projects a roughly 114% increase in average premium payments for subsidized enrollees in 2026. Older adults and rural residents would be especially exposed, with KFF also warning that adults ages 50 to 64 could see average premium hikes of 75% or more.​\n\nDriscoll argued that the real story is a giant cost shift from government to households and employers, driven by simultaneous Medicaid cuts, work requirements, and subsidy rollbacks. When people lose coverage, he notes, they “don’t stop getting covered by the health care system.” Instead, they show up later and sicker, so hospitals and insurers respond by raising prices to anticipate uncompensated care.\n\nWhen you consider that this is being done to “effectively subsidize a tax deduction for millionaires and billionaires, that’s going to shift health care costs to all of us when people lose coverage,” he added, referring to the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that extended President Donald Trump’s previous tax cuts and introduced new ones.\n\nFor Driscoll, the subsidy cliff exposes a deeper “tribal dysfunction” in health policy that has frozen the Affordable Care Act in place instead of improving it. He called Obamacare “a very good but imperfect solution” that cut the uninsured rate roughly in half and slowed healthcare inflation, but he said both parties have refused to engage in the hard work of updating it. “We really aren’t prioritizing the patient,” he said, “we’re prioritizing the politics,” leaving millions facing the choice of dropping coverage or postponing care for serious conditions.\n\n​​He had a warning for Republicans, calling this looming mass expiration of health insurance subsidies a “self-inflicted wound” for the party. “They were elected on solving affordability,” he pointed out, and now they’re going to accelerate the problem. But Driscoll said no side is blameless. “The tragic thing is, neither side really wants to have a sensible conversation about how do you really care for more people and get them better care earlier.”\n\nIt’s true that Democrats drove the ACA, but Driscoll said that by and large they are committed to defending something that was itself a compromise, and the other side is playing offense. “The danger is that some Democrats don’t want to have a conversation on evolving [the ACA] because they feel like they have to defend it and the Republicans don’t ever don’t want to have a conversation about evolving it because they want to destroy it.” The result is you end up here, in “this sort of ridiculous no progress zone.” (Driscoll did disclose that he is serving as Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont’s special advisor on health care.)\n\nFrom his vantage point now, Driscoll argued that the reason America is bedevilled with constant healthcare issues is a mismatch of incentives. “Healthcare is a team sport that keeps getting undermined by individual incentives,” he said, noting that U.S. costs are twice as expensive as the average industrialized country and not nearly as productive, he pointed out.\n\nIn similar countries, roughly 50%-60% of doctors are primary care, but it’s only one in four in the U.S. The problem is that every doctor wants to be a specialist or a surgeon because they’ll roughly double the salary of a pediatrician or internist that way. “Until you change those incentives people are going to keep going towards those higher compensated areas.”\n\nThere’s no one fix to this, but there are steps we could take, Driscoll said. He pointed to expanded drug‑price negotiation, immigration reforms to ease shortages of primary‑care doctors and nurses, “site‑neutral” payment so patients aren’t charged more for identical hospital‑based care, and broader use of value‑based and bundled payment models. But we don’t even seem to be capable of engagement, he argued.\n\n“If the two sides could talk,” Driscoll said, “there probably is a way that they could agree on how to to bridge the difference between what Biden and Trump want to do on drug costs. If we could talk, we could probably agree on how to bring back value-based care that would balance the interests of doctors and hospitals and and patients’ outcomes and the government’s obligation.” If only.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

    "title": "I Tracked My Health With Whoop, and This Is What I Liked (and What I Ignored)",
    "description": "The last six weeks have taught me that hydration is more important than I realized, and opened my eyes to how much shut-eye I actually need.",
    "fullText": "When I reviewed the Whoop 5.0 and MG (and, earlier, the Whoop 4.0), I kept it to the basics—how the strap looks, works, and charges, and what activities it can track. But that's only part of it, and today, I’m going to dive in to all the metrics Whoop reports and offer a reality check on what I've found most useful and what isn’t worth paying attention to.\n\n(I'll leave out the activity tracking features here, since I covered them in more depth in the review, but the bottom line is this: I love the way it tracks how hard your workouts are—strength workouts included—but it's not going to replace a true fitness watch for most people.)\n\nI haven't worn the Whoop band as regularly as I do the Oura ring, for which I was able to give a four-year retrospective. But to research both this article and my reviews, I’ve worn the Whoop for a couple of stints of at least a few weeks each, tracking my workouts and sleep regularly. With that said, here's a deeper dive into what it’s actually like to wear the Whoop strap long-term, using it to judge and guide your habits and performance.\n\nLet me take you through a typical day. I’m wearing the Whoop band on either my wrist or upper arm, and it’s probably been a few days since I last charged it. (I get about five days on a charge.) I made sure I had it on when I went to bed. If I look at my Whoop app first thing in the morning, it will sometimes tell me that it’s still “processing” my sleep, and there’s a button I can press to “end sleep” and get my recovery results.\n\nThe Whoop app will show you a survey called your “journal” the first time you open the app each day. I’ll talk more about the journal in a section below. Let’s say you’ve already filled out your journal, and you’re looking at the main app. From the home screen, on a typical day I might see:\n\nMy recovery at the top, color coded. Green is good, and you get that if your recovery is 66% or better. Yellow is OK (34% and up), and red is poor. Today, I have a yellow recovery, at 48%. (For the month of April, I got 19 green recoveries, 9 yellow, 0 red, and on two nights I forgot to wear the strap to bed.)\n\nSome notes about things I should pay attention to. Perhaps my HRV is lower than usual, which might be because of my hard workout yesterday.\n\nThe health monitor, which tells me whether my respiratory rate, blood oxygen, resting heart rate, HRV, and skin temperature are within my normal ranges.\n\nThe stress monitor, which I guess tells me how stressed I am. To be honest, I don’t find this useful.\n\nA \"daily outlook\" button I can press. This starts a conversation with Whoop Coach—more about that in a minute.\n\nToday’s timeline, showing when I slept. As I do other activities, like workouts, they’ll show up here.\n\nRecommendations for tonight’s sleep, including a recommended bedtime.\n\nAfter this, there is a scorecard for my current “plan” (more about that below), and a dashboard with the individual metrics I might care about, like heart rate variability (HRV) and a count of my steps so far today, a feature that’s still in beta.\n\nAlong the top of the screen, I can tap on my scores for Sleep, Recovery, or Strain. The Strain screen is interesting, since it gives a recommended Strain level for the day. It may suggest that I take on a “moderate” level of Strain, and set my target as 8.9 to 12.9. You get most of your Strain from exercise, and a little from everyday activity like walking around. On a morning I haven’t done any workouts or left the house yet, I may be around 2.7 Strain just from sitting around.\n\nLet’s return to that Daily Outlook button. Tap that, and you’ll be launched into a conversation with Whoop Coach, an AI chatbot. This is probably the only AI bot I converse with on the regular, because it does a decent job of explaining the app’s metrics and recommends workouts for the day.\n\nTo use one real example: on a certain day it complimented me on completing a running workout yesterday, and told me my workout schedule had been consistent, with 162 minutes in active heart rate zones so far that week. It then described a few trends in my metrics, including that my resting heart rate had improved over the past few weeks, but that my recovery that day was lower than my usual.\n\nThen comes the fun part. It makes recommendations for workouts to do today, and habits to focus on. It told me to aim for three liters of water that day (that’s a little bit more than my usual) with plenty of fruits and vegetables. And for a workout, I could meet my recommended Strain score with something that is low impact to “support recovery,” since my heart rate and HRV suggested I may need a bit of a rest.\n\nThe Whoop Coach went on to suggest three workouts to choose from, based on the kinds of activities it knows I like to do. They included a 30-minute run, mostly in zones 1 and 2, or an 80-minute weightlifting workout at a low-medium intensity. I can tap a button at the bottom of each workout that says “Commit,” and doing this will add it to my timeline for the day. I can do the workout later by just tapping that button, and it will start the activity timer for me.\n\nI love that it can recommend these workouts for me, since otherwise “get 8.9 Strain” is an inscrutable instruction. Unfortunately, the little graphic showing time in heart rate zones is all you get. I’ve asked the Whoop Coach if it could time me through those intervals, perhaps beeping when it’s time to switch from one zone to another, but it doesn’t have that functionality.\n\nIt does offer a specific workout plan that I could punch into a workout timer app of my choice. In the past, the Whoop Coach has struggled to put together interval workouts that add up to the number of minutes that are supposed to be in the workout; that seems to be improving. But the workout ideas are still pretty generic. I found that the best way to use the coach is to see what it recommends, then use that as a sort of vague guidance if I have flexibility in my training program or my real-life plans for the day. For example, if I have a hard 45-minute running workout planned today, but Whoop thinks I should do something lighter, I might see if I can swap today's run with an easy run that is scheduled for later in the week.\n\nWhoop gives you so many sleep metrics, it can be hard to know where to start. I see two major, useful features here: the report of how long you slept compared to how much sleep you needed, and the smart alarms that you can set in any of a variety of ways.\n\nOn your Sleep tab, you’ll get a score for your sleep “performance,” comparing the amount of sleep you got to the amount it calculates you needed. Today I slept more than I needed, which doesn’t match with how I felt groggily dragging myself out of bed. The timing seems right, though—I was extra tired yesterday so I both got to bed early and slept a little late.\n\nI think it’s a fool’s errand to worry about how “accurate” sleep tracking is, since no wearable is truly accurate, but most of them are good enough. But for a comparison, the total sleep time is usually similar to what Oura reports, and the sleep phases are often more-or-less in the same ballpark. Here’s one example from a day I wore both Oura and Whoop:\n\nTotal sleep matters more than the other numbers, in my book. Increase your total sleep and you’re likely to sleep better. (I have data backing this up from my long-term Oura trends—total sleep correlates closely with other metrics and scores of sleep quality.)\n\nWhoop also tracks your “sleep debt,” or how much sleep you needed but didn’t get. In one example month I had a six nights with a “high” sleep debt of 45 minutes or more. Nine times it was moderate (30 to 45 minutes), and 14 times it was 30 minutes or less.\n\nOne of Whoop’s most intriguing features is the sleep coach, which can advise you when to go to bed, and even help you decide when your alarm should go off. (It’s also one of the most hidden features. Tap on the “tonight’s sleep” card on your overview screen.)\n\nFrom this screen, called the Sleep Planner, you can choose whether you want to “reach my sleep need” (making up any sleep debt, as needed); “improve my sleep,” which will recommend times that help you to be more consistent in your sleep schedule; or “reach my weekly plan goal,” which I’ll say more about below.\n\nAnd then, there’s a second set of preferences. When you try to set an alarm, the app will ask if you’d like to wake up at an exact time, or when you’ve met your sleep goal for the night, or as soon as you’re “in the green.” That last one refers to a 66% or better recovery, which may not be ideal, but should ensure you’re not going to be dead on your feet.\n\nRealistically, I don’t use these features too often. I do have a sleep goal set in my weekly plan, but I’m not fiddling with an app every night to decide when to wake up. On the other hand, if I had a chaotic schedule, like that of a student or a pro sports player, I could definitely see making more use of this feature.\n\nThe activity and sleep tracking happen more or less automatically, and pretty much any fitness tracker or smartwatch can do those things. Where Whoop really shines, from a wellness perspective, is in helping you track all the little habits and factors that may be affecting your sleep or your athletic performance.\n\nThis is where the Journal comes in. You can fill it out at any time during the day, but it will also pop up first thing in the morning and ask you what happened yesterday. Did you eat a late meal? Did you have any alcohol? Did you hydrate well? If you don’t like these questions, you can set it up to ask you different ones. It can also pull in data from other parts of the app or from connected apps—for example, if you log your menstrual cycle in Apple Health, that can show up here as well.\n\nEach habit or factor only becomes useful if you log at least five yeses and five nos. Anything that you almost always do, or that you almost never do, isn’t going to be very helpful to track. So I’ve narrowed down my Journal questions to only include things I’ll answer differently from night to night, or things I’m trying to improve on.\n\nOne important caveat: leaving the question blank doesn’t count as a yes or a no. At first I only answered a question if I could say “yes,” and otherwise I’d leave it blank—for example, answering “yes” if I’d had alcohol that day. But when I looked at my results later, I found that with a total of seven yeses and zero nos for alcohol, Whoop couldn’t give me any reports that used that information. When I noticed this I was able to backfill the last few days’ worth of journal entries, but you can’t go back more than about a week.\n\nThat extra week’s worth of data was enough to get an answer on alcohol, though: it hurts my recovery, taking it down an average of 9% on nights I had a beer or two. Or at least that’s how Whoop represents it—these are correlations, and Whoop doesn’t actually know what’s causing what. For example, taking melatonin supposedly hurts my recovery by 4%. But is melatonin really the culprit, or do I tend to take melatonin when I’m already having trouble sleeping? You need to take these results with a big grain of salt. To Whoop’s credit, it includes a note that “this impact is significantly different than the Whoop average. Note that impacts can sometimes be affected by other correlated factors that you don’t track.”\n\nThe two things that do help my recovery, according to Whoop’s insights (which you can access from the top of the Journal screen), are sticking to a consistent bedtime—8% improvement—and being well-hydrated, a 4% improvement. The consistent bedtime was automatically filled out from Whoop data, while the hydration came from me answering a yes/no question each day.\n\nWeekly plans are a nice way to work on a small set of habits for a short time. Rather than trying to monitor everything for every outcome, you pick, say, three things you want to work on. Here are some examples that the app provides, and the habits or factors that each one tracks:\n\nBoost fitness: increase time in high intensity heart rate zones, meet a protein goal four days per week, do any strength training activity one day per week\n\nFeel better: increase daily steps, meet hydration goal four days per week, do “any recovery activity” three days per week\n\nSleep deeper: increase sleep consistency, increase sleep performance, avoid late meals\n\nAfter experimenting with some of these, I ended up creating a custom plan for myself. I chose:\n\nGet 7:30 hours of sleep on average\n\nAvoid using my phone in bed four days per week\n\nMeet my hydration goal five days per week\n\nThroughout the week I can check in on how I’m doing, and at the end of the week Whoop gives me a little report and asks if I’d like to do the same plan next week, or change it up. I find this a useful way to work on a mini goal, and it’s a lot less overwhelming than poring over huge dashboards full of all the data Whoop can collect.\n\nFor when you do want to pore over all your data, there are detailed weekly and monthly “performance assessments” that Whoop can share with you. Each of these is a PDF with graphs showing what you did over the course of the week or month, and how it compares with previous data.\n\nFor example, my monthly report for last April shows how my Strain and recovery compare with previous weeks throughout the year. I don’t wear my Whoop often enough to get any big insights from this—as I said, I only really wear it when I’m testing features or writing a review—but man, I would love this if it were available on one of the devices I do wear month in and month out. (As much as I admire the Whoop, I can only wear so many devices in addition to the ones I test for work.)\n\nMy weekly report is more narrowly focused. The most recent one starts with a statement: “Strain was optimal. Sleep could use improvement.” My Strain is also down slightly this week compared with the previous week, and my sleep consistency was poor. I like the graph that shows how my bedtimes and wake-up times line up (or don’t) with the times the app recommended for me.\n\nThe Whoop app gives you a wealth of data, and honestly I would say most of it isn’t worth paying attention to. The app has so many data points and fractal little rabbit holes you can get lost in. You could spend hours perusing reports and tweaking settings. You could spend an unlimited amount of time chatting with the Whoop Coach AI. And you don’t need to do that.\n\nWhat is useful is choosing a few things to pay attention to and letting go of the rest. Fortunately, the app gives you plenty of ways to do this. You can select a few things that matter to you in the Weekly Plan, and you can hide things from your Dashboard that you don’t need to check on every day.\n\nAs for the things I (almost) never pay attention to:\n\nDon’t overthink your sleep stages. Getting enough sleep, and consistent sleep, will cover your bases.\n\nDon’t read too much into the recovery scores; you are resilient enough to be able to handle your scheduled workout even if your sleep wasn’t perfect. The exception would be if you’re feeling truly awful—you’re sick or something—in which case, you would know because of how you feel, not because of a number on an app.\n\nRemember that the insights tell you about correlation, not causation—as in my melatonin example, where melatonin is correlated with worse sleep, possibly because I'm taking it when I expect to have worse sleep. These are not really \"insights\" at all, just data that you'll need to use your own brain (and further experimentation) to make sense of.\n\nI have found that paying too much attention to a recovery app can drive me a little crazy. Instead of waking up and not really thinking about how I feel—I’m fine, probably—I find myself wondering if the app agrees that I feel tired and sore. Or I’ll think I’m OK, but the app says my HRV is down, and now I have to think about what may have caused that. I wouldn’t recommend intensive tracking like this for a person who finds they can easily get sucked in to obsessing over numbers. But if numbers bring you joy, the Whoop app can certainly give you plenty of them.",

    "fullText": "Psychiatrists have long relied on diagnostic manuals that regard most mental-health conditions as distinct from one another — depression, for instance, is listed as a separate disorder from anxiety. But a genetic analysis of more than one million people suggests that a host of psychiatric conditions have common biological roots.\n\nThe results, published today in Nature1, reveal that people with seemingly disparate conditions often share many of the same disease-linked genetic variants. The analysis found that 14 major psychiatric disorders cluster into five categories, each characterized by a common set of genetic risk factors. The neurodevelopmental category, for example, includes both attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism, which psychiatric handbooks classify as separate conditions.\n\nMany supposedly individual conditions are “ultimately more overlapping than they are distinct, which should offer patients hope”, says study co-author Andrew Grotzinger, a psychiatric geneticist at the University of Colorado Boulder. “You can see the despair on someone’s face [when] you give them five different labels as opposed to one label.”\n\nGrotzinger says his team’s work was motivated by the finding that people diagnosed with one mental-health condition are highly likely to be diagnosed with another one. For example, previous research has shown that most people diagnosed with depression have also been diagnosed with a condition called generalized anxiety disorder, and vice versa2.\n\nTo learn whether there is a biological explanation for these correlations, Grotzinger and his colleagues aggregated genomic data from more than one million people with psychiatric conditions and from millions of healthy controls.\n\nThe researchers found that the 14 mental-health conditions they studied generally fall into five distinct buckets, each with its own genetic profile. There’s a schizophrenia/bipolar disorder category; an ‘internalizing’ category that includes depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder; a neurodevelopmental category; and a compulsive category that includes obsessive-compulsive disorder and anorexia.\n\nA final category includes substance-use disorders such as alcohol-use disorder and nicotine dependence. People whose genetic profile corresponds to a given bucket are at elevated risk of any of the conditions in that bucket. Other genetic and environmental triggers also affect risk.\n\nThe team then worked backwards from the categories that they had identified and found 238 specific genomic regions that are associated with at least one of these shared categories. For example, the researchers found that one region on chromosome 11 raised genetic risk for eight separate disorders, because the region codes for genes linked to dopamine signalling.\n\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-025-04037-w\n\nRead the related News & Views, ‘Shared genetic risk in psychiatric disorders’.\n\nGrotzinger, A.

    "description": "A warehouse worker consumed 8 energy drinks a day to \"stay alert\" at work, which led to a dangerous health condition",
    "fullText": "A “fit and well” man was rushed to the hospital after suffering a stroke caused by blood pressure that was “sky high”\n\nAfter he was discharged, his blood pressure began to rise again, and upon a follow-up visit, he shared with his doctors that he consumes 8 energy drinks a day\n\nThe man was drinking more than 3 times the recommended amount of caffeine\n\nA “fit and well” man’s habit of downing 8 energy drinks a day caused him to have a stroke — and he’s left with lingering damage.\n\nA 54-year-old warehouse worker arrived to the emergency room with numbness, weakness on his left side, and ataxia (trouble with balance and movement), according to a case report in BMJ Journals. He was “normally fit and well,” the report says —  except for his blood pressure.\n\n“His blood pressure was sky high — about 254 over 150 millimeters — yet when you looked at him you’d never know it, because he looked so well. That’s why we call hypertension the silent killer,” Dr. Sunil Munshi, a consulting physician at Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust in the United Kingdom, and senior author of the report, told CNN.\n\nNormal blood pressure for a man his age is less than 120 over less than 80, per the American Heart Association. His numbers are classified as a “hypertensive emergency.”\n\nThe blood pressure had caused “a stroke in the deeper part of the brain, the thalamus, which explains the unsteadiness,” Munshi told the outlet. The man, a warehouse worker from the Sherwood district of the English city of Nottingham, was admitted and treated with five different medications to make his blood pressure drop.\n\nAfter he was discharged, his blood pressure began to increase again, leaving doctors baffled — until, as Munshi shares, he told doctors about his energy drink habit.\n\n“Each day he consumed eight highly potent energy drinks to stay alert for his job — two cans at four different times during the day,” Munshi told CNN. “Each of the drinks contained 160 milligrams of caffeine. Suddenly the diagnosis was clear.”\n\nThe Mayo Clinic says that up to 400 milligrams of caffeine a day “seems safe” for most adults; the patient was drinking more than three times that amount.\n\nToo much caffeine can increase your risk of developing cardiovascular disease, according to a study from the American College of Cardiology.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nHe stopped drinking the energy drinks (the specific brand was not identified in the study), and his blood pressure returned to normal. But the lingering impact of his stroke and energy drink habit remain, he told his doctors, per CNN.\n\n“I obviously wasn’t aware of the dangers drinking energy drinks were causing to myself,” he said, explaining he’s “been left with numbness [in my] left hand side hand and fingers, foot and toes even after 8 years.”\n\nAs Munshi explained, there are other ingredients in energy drinks that can contribute to health problems. “Energy drinks that contain caffeine plus taurine produce significantly higher blood pressure than caffeine alone,” he said. “They also contain high levels of glucose — we know sugar damages the blood vessels in diabetes which leads to heart damage.”",

    "fullText": "The New York Times said on Wednesday that it would not “be deterred by false and inflammatory language” in response to President Donald Trump’s latest claim that the outlet’s reporting on his age was an attempt to “libel and demean” him.\n\nThe paper said its audience deserved “in-depth reporting and regular updates about the health of the leaders they elect.” The statement came in response to Trump’s Tuesday attack against the paper, apparently over a November article focused on his declining energy, which argued the Times should “cease publication because they are a horrible, biased, and untruthful ‘source’ of information.”\n\n“Mr. Trump welcomed our reporting on the age and fitness of his predecessors; we’re applying the same journalistic scrutiny to his vitality,” spokesperson Nicole Taylor wrote in a statement. “Our reporting is heavily sourced, based on interviews with people clsoe to the president and with medical experts. We won’t be deterred by false and inflammatory language that distorts the role of a free press.”\n\nStill, such an approach to news coverage didn’t seem to resonate with Trump, who claimed again that his cognitive test results were something few people, “including those working at The New York Times,” could do very well.\n\n“Despite all of this, the time and work involved, The New York Times, and some others, like to pretend that I am ‘slowing up,’ am maybe not as sharp as I once was, or am in poor physical health, knowing that it is not true, and knowing that I work very hard, probably harder than I have ever worked before,” Trump wrote. “I will know when I am ‘slowing up,’ but it’s not now! After all of the work I have done with Medical Exams, Cognitive Exams, and everything else, I actually believe it’s seditious, perhaps even treasonous, for The New York Times, and others, to consistently do FAKE reports in order to libel and demean  ‘THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.’ They are true Enemies of the People, and we should do something about it.”\n\nThe Times’ Katie Rogers and Dylan Freedman reported last month that Trump has started his events later in recent months and his public appearances had decreased. They wrote that, while “Trump and the people around him still talk about him as if he is the Energizer Bunny of presidential politics,” “the reality is more complicated.”\n\nTrump lashed out at the paper hours after the story published, calling Rogers “ugly, both inside and out” for writing the story and claimed then that the paper was an “ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE.”\n\nThe post New York Times Blasts Trump’s ‘False and Inflammatory’ Claim That Reporting on His Health Could Be Libelous appeared first on TheWrap.",

    "fullText": "Luxe quartz countertops have surged in popularity in recent years, with an 800% rise in imports to the US alone, thanks to their durability, heat resistance and smooth, natural look.\n\nBut that beauty may come at a price to the workers who install them.\n\nThe Massachusetts Department of Public Health issued a safety alert on Tuesday regarding silicosis, a progressive and incurable lung disease.\n\nThe state confirmed the first case of silicosis in a Massachusetts employee of the stone countertop fabrication industry.\n\nHistorically associated with mining and construction, the disease has become more prevalent among stone fabricators working with engineered stone, which contains significantly more silica than natural materials like granite or marble.\n\nAbout 2.3 million US workers are exposed to silica in the workplace, according to the American Lung Association.\n\nSilicosis is caused by inhaling crystalline silica dust, which is generated by cutting, polishing or grinding stones, especially high-silica engineered quartz.\n\nSymptoms can include an irritating cough, mucus, shortness of breath, trouble breathing, fatigue, chest pain and leg swelling.\n\nWhile there are treatments to manage symptoms, there’s no cure for silicosis. The disease can worsen as it progresses, potentially leading to lung cancer, tuberculosis and even death.\n\nThe Massachusetts resident had worked for stone countertop fabrication and installation companies for 14 years, the state said. He’s a Hispanic man in his 40s.\n\nThe first US case of silicosis linked to engineered stone was reported in Texas in 2015.\n\nIn a 2023 study, California researchers identified 52 California quartz countertop workers with silicosis.\n\nTwenty of them had advanced silicosis, and 10 died before the study concluded.\n\nWhile the disease is potentially deadly, there hasn’t been an outright ban on quartz in the kitchen.\n\nRather, public health officials and researchers are asking for stricter regulations and safety precautions.\n\n“The confirmation of this case in Massachusetts is a tragic reminder that silicosis is not just a distant threat — it is here, and it is seriously impacting the health of workers in Massachusetts,” Emily H. Sparer-Fine, director of the Massachusetts Department of Public Health’s Occupational Health Surveillance Program, said in a statement.\n\n“Beyond the critical role employers play, everyone involved in the supply chain can help reduce the danger by opting for materials that contain less silica and pose fewer health hazards,” she added.\n\nPrecautions such as proper ventilation and a medical surveillance program for workers have been floated as possible solutions.\n\n“Our paper raises the alarm,” said Dr. Sheiphali Gandhi, a UC San Francisco pulmonologist and co-author of the California study. “If we don’t stop it now, we’re going to have hundreds, if not thousands, of more cases. Even if we stopped it now, we’re going to be seeing these cases for the next decade because [silicosis] takes years to develop.”\n\nIn 2016, the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration issued two respirable crystalline silica standards to protect workers.\n\nThese standards require employee exposures to be below the permissible limit of 50 micrograms of respirable crystalline silica per cubic meter of air over an eight-hour workday.\n\nIn 2019 and 2020, however, California safety officials found that about 72% of the 808 fabrication shops operating in the state were “likely out of compliance with the existing silica standard,” putting hundreds of workers at risk of silicosis, according to NPR.\n\nSince then, the California Division of OSHA adopted emergency rules for respirable crystalline silica in 2023, which were made permanent in late 2024.",

    "title": "Included Health is launching an AI personal health assistant that'll face off with Big Tech from Verily to OpenAI",
    "description": "The startup's new tech could compete with Big Tech's health AI projects from heavyweights like Alphabet and OpenAI.",
    "fullText": "Included Health is rolling out a new AI tool that could pit it against Big Tech's latest health bets.\n\nThe healthcare startup has launched an AI-powered personal health assistant, Business Insider has learned exclusively. The tech draws on patients' medical claims, benefits information, and other data to offer on-demand answers to health-related questions.\n\nIncluded Health is tapping into a hot area in healthcare AI, where it's competing against other health startups as well as tech heavyweights. Alphabet's Verily released its own AI-powered app in October that allows patients to connect their medical records and ask a chatbot their health-related questions. OpenAI wants to win in consumer health tech, too, and is considering building tools such as its own personal health assistant, Business Insider reported in November.\n\nIncluded Health has been scaling on the premise of personalizing how patients interact with their healthcare for over a decade. The company, which sells tech to about 300 employers and health plans to help patients better navigate their health benefits, tested its AI assistant for about 18 months to ensure its accuracy in smaller pilots before making it available to its entire employer base, CEO Owen Tripp said.\n\n\"This can't be ChatGPT level of probability. It has to be precise,\" he said.\n\nTripp is optimistic about patients receiving general health guidance from LLMs like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude. Those AI tools can help patients learn more about their conditions and prepare for doctor's visits, he said. But he emphasized that Included's tech takes that guidance a step further.\n\n\"When it gets down to the business of actually taking care of oneself or taking care of somebody else, you're going to need a lot of very secure, specific data and a whole context to go solve problems, including the exact medical history of that patient,\" Tripp said.\n\nPatient-facing healthcare AI sometimes walks a regulatory tightrope, especially if the tech provides personalized advice that effectively replaces the work clinicians are licensed to do. Tripp said he doubts that most large tech companies attempting to delve into medical records aggregation will want to grapple with that complexity.\n\n\"I predict, like many before them, they will pull back. It's just hard, and the juice is often not worth the squeeze for these high-profile companies,\" he said.\n\nIncluded Health's personal health assistant, called Dot, has become its members' front door and the foundation for Included's new products, said COO Nupur Srivastava.\n\nIncluded recently put Dot in front of members during open enrollment to help answer their benefits questions, Srivastava said. The AI agent can also help patients prepare for doctor's visits and send the clinician a summary of patients' past visits ahead of time.\n\nIncluded Health still employs plenty of its own clinicians and care advocates that members can talk to if they prefer. Srivastava also noted that if a patient mentions the term 'suicide' in a conversation with Dot, \"within a minute, someone will call you.\"\n\nWhen asked about Big Tech and AI startups' ambitions to build personalized health AI, Tripp said that Included Health is in talks with multiple potential partners to help them achieve those goals. He didn't specify which companies it's talking to, but he suggested some AI companies are focused on acquiring personalized health data that they can anonymize and use to train models.\n\n\"But when it comes to actually delivering patient care, we're pretty confident that companies that are going to succeed will be the ones that have well-trained physicians licensed in all 50 states, delivering on a real-time platform, across mind, body, and wallet,\" he said.\n\nIncluded Health was supposed to go public in 2022. The startup had hired banks for an IPO push, but pulled out of its planned investor meetings when the market started to tank, Tripp told Business Insider in January.\n\nTripp declined to share specifics about Included's exit strategy as of November. But Included is profitable, so the company doesn't need to raise money through a public listing, he said. Included hasn't publicly fundraised since it was formed from the 2021 merger of Grand Rounds and Doctor on Demand, and the company hasn't shared its valuation.\n\nThe public markets haven't been forgiving to healthcare startups. Only two digital health companies went public this year, Hinge Health and Omada Health. And while Hinge and Omada have fared far better than most companies that listed during digital health's 2021 IPO wave, healthcare IPO hopefuls still face high standards to going public and significant volatility risks once they begin trading.\n\n\"The last few years in our space haven't been a great commercial for being a public company,\" Tripp said.\n\nWith so many developments in healthcare AI, however, Tripp does recognize that an IPO could create opportunities for Included Health to acquire other companies.\n\n\"I do think this is a time where there are going to be some interesting capabilities and technologies available in the market that allow us to provide even more service to our members,\" he said. \"I do have my eyes very open to how I would use capital to execute on some of those M&A events. That part is more important to me.\"",

    "fullText": "King Charles is a step closer to saying goodbye to Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s kids before it’s too late.\n\nThe Sun reported on December 7 that Harry had a major win in his ongoing case to restore his security in the United Kingdom after he lost the taxpayer-funded benefit after he and his wife, Meghan Markle, stepped down as senior members of the British royal family and moved to the United States in 2020. According to The Sun, a review of Harry’s security by the official body that assesses how royals and VIPs are guarded is now underway by the U.K. government.\n\nHarry's Ex's Friend Called Their Breakup the 'Best Thing That Ever Happened to Her' Right Before Reports the Prince Saw Her as the '1 Person Who Really Understood' Him\n\nThe Sun also reported that evidence has already been collected by Harry’s team, the police, and the government, and any decision around Harry’s security will be known in January 2026. “The UK Government’s protective security system is rigorous and proportionate. It is our long-standing policy not to provide detailed information on those arrangements, as doing so could compromise their integrity and affect individuals’ security,” a U.K. government spokesperson said in a statement at the time.\n\nThe update means Harry, who has said that he doesn’t feel safe bringing Meghan and his two children, Archie and Lilibet, back to the U.K. unless they had security, is one step closer to reuniting his father, King Charles, with his grandchildren. According to BBC, Charles hasn’t seen Lilibet and Archie in person since the Sussexes’ visit to the U.K. in 2022 for the Platinum Jubilee.\n\nThe update also comes after Charles and Harry reunited for the first time in years during a meeting in September, which was seen as a “massive step” forward in their estrangement, according to People. The update also comes as a source told Us Weekly in December that Charles is viewing his 2025 Christmas celebration as his “last” holiday after he was diagnosed with cancer in 2024.\n\n“Charles prioritizes duty, but he’s also a family man who knows his time is precious,” the insider said. “He wants a special last Christmas in case it’s his last.”\n\nFor Charles’ “last Christmas,” the insider reported that the king planned on taking his St. Mary Magdalene Church on Christmas morning and recording his Christmas speech, which airs later that afternoon to million of listeners. “Nothing would stop Charles from doing that,” the insider said. “He will do everything expected of him and more.” Another source added, “His health isn’t the best.

    "title": "How the Fitness Tech Boom Is Making Health Inequality Worse",
    "description": "We live in a time of unprecedented insight into our bodies—if you can afford it.",
    "fullText": "The latest Apple Watch costs $429. A basic Peloton Bike is $1,395, plus a $49.99 monthly subscription. Throw in a WHOOP membership at $149 annually, maybe an Oura Ring for another $349, and suddenly you're looking at thousands of dollars to participate in what's become the standard way many Americans approach their health. For some, that price tag is steep. For others, it's a non-starter.\n\nI'm no stranger to the appeal of the latest, greatest wearables and smart health devices. But as all this wellness technology become the norm, what does this mean for people who don't strap a smartwatch onto their wrists? If comprehensive health data—and the insights it provides—becomes a luxury good, the existing digital health divide will only get worse.\n\nThe issue starts well before anyone considers buying a fitness tracker. Digital equity in healthcare is already a fundamental access issue. \"In many ways, access to healthcare means access to technology,\" says Amy Gonzales, an associate professor in UC Santa Barbara's Department of Communication. \"Especially since [the COVID-19 pandemic], the healthcare industry relies heavily on technology for their services. Text reminders about your appointment, scanning a QR code to check in, needing an e-health account to see your test results, or some providers only being available via telehealth, and so on.\"\n\nThe basic infrastructure of modern healthcare—patient portals, appointment scheduling apps, prescription management systems—demands a level of digital literacy and access that not everyone can meet. Seniors may struggle with smartphone interfaces. Low-income families might rely on limited mobile data or shared devices. People with certain disabilities may find standard health apps difficult or impossible to navigate. And the problem compounds: Gonzales notes the populations most likely to face barriers with technology are often the same groups who may need that healthcare the most.\n\nAgainst this backdrop of baseline digital inequity, fitness trackers and wearables have gotten more and more popular. These aren't essential medical devices in the traditional sense—nobody's life support depends on their Fitbit—but they've become cultural markers of health optimization. More concerning, they're increasingly becoming tools that provide genuinely useful health information that simply isn't available to people without the resources to buy in. Heart rate, blood oxygen saturation, sleep stages, stress levels, and more: We're living in a time of unprecedented insight into what our bodies are doing, if you can afford it.\n\nIN some circles, these devices have become simply how health-conscious people approach their wellbeing. Studies have shown that wearables can help detect abnormal heart rhythms, encourage increased physical activity, and provide early warning signs of illness. Some insurance companies offer discounts for users who share their fitness tracking data. Employers incorporate wearables into wellness programs.\n\nWhile this is promising for those who can afford it, others get left behind. \"The digital divide is even more problematic with 'bonus devices,' or health 'accoutrements,' like smart wearables,\" says Gonzales. If at-risk health populations are already at-risk for digital access, it tracks that this access gap is only getting wider.\n\nThe creation of a two-tiered information system is perhaps the most insidious aspect of fitness tech inequality. A person with an Apple Watch receives detailed daily reports about their cardiovascular health, activity levels, and sleep quality. They get alerts when their heart rate becomes irregular, or they can share comprehensive data with their physician that provides context for symptoms and conditions. Someone without these devices? They're left with subjective assessments and whatever gets captured during periodic doctor visits.\n\n\"If you don't have the same resources to track your blood pressure, blood pressure, or physical activity,\" says Gonzales, \"you are certainly being left behind on useful healthcare.\" Consider two people with similar cardiovascular risk factors. The one with a wearable device might receive an alert and seek immediate treatment, potentially preventing a stroke. The other person might not notice symptoms until a serious cardiac event occurs. Both deserved that potentially life-saving alert, but only one could afford the device that provided it.\n\nAs more people in higher-income brackets adopt these technologies and share data with healthcare providers, medical understanding itself may become skewed toward populations who can afford comprehensive self-monitoring. If research studies increasingly incorporate wearable data, but if that data predominantly comes from affluent, educated users, the resulting insights may not apply equally across all demographics.\n\nAccess isn't the only lens through which to view this fitness tech. \"There's this implicit assumption that wearables are inherently good,\" says Gonzales. \"What about privacy risks?\" After all, if you think you own all your health data, think again.\n\nThink of the history of the healthcare industry's relationship with marginalized communities. The Tuskegee syphilis study, forced sterilizations, and ongoing disparities in pain management and maternal mortality have created a pretty understandable skepticism toward giving up data, to say the least. \"Given the history of experimentation and exploitation of certain low-income populations, there's a natural distrust in these sub-groups,\" Gonzales says. \"Maybe these demographics intentionally avoid third parties collecting their data.\"\n\nSo, the same communities that might benefit most from health monitoring technology may also have the most legitimate reasons to be wary of it. As I've previously covered, data privacy protections remain inconsistent, and the long-term implications of sharing detailed biometric data with corporations are still unclear. For populations that have historically been surveilled, exploited, or discriminated against, choosing not to participate in constant data collection might be a rational decision, rather than simply a matter of access. There's something to be said for health approaches that don't involve third-party corporations accumulating detailed records of your body's functions.\n\nNaturally, budget options for fitness tech do exist, and these options can help some people access these technologies. But even \"affordable\" options still cost money that many families simply don't have for what remains, technically speaking, optional equipment. When you're choosing between a $50 fitness tracker and groceries, the choice isn't really a choice at all.\n\nAll of this is to say that the fitness tech inequality problem can't be solved by individual purchasing decisions or corporate discount programs. It's embedded in broader questions about healthcare access, digital equity, and what we consider essential versus optional in maintaining health. Glucose monitors, fertility trackers, or blood pressure cuffs could more easily qualify as medical equipment, where an Oura ring is still a luxury good. Addressing the gap requires reimagining what counts as necessary healthcare technology. Otherwise, we could be approaching a future where your ability to detect health problems early, track chronic conditions, and optimize your fitness depends on whether you can afford a monthly subscription.\n\nHealthcare has become digitized, creating new opportunities for monitoring and intervention, but also new mechanisms for inequality. As fitness technology continues advancing, offering more sophisticated monitoring and more actionable insights, that fundamental inequality will only get worse. Because at the intersection of healthcare and technology, \"the people who struggle with one are often the same people who need the other,\" Gonzales says.\n\nThe Apple Watch on your wrist may feel like a personal choice, a small investment in your personal wellness. But scale that up across millions of people and billions of data points, and individual choices become structural inequalities. Technology that was supposed to democratize health information may instead be creating new hierarchies of who gets to know what about their own bodies. And those who need that knowledge most may be the least likely to access it.",

    "fullText": "Experts warn of dangers as England and Wales study shows 13- to 17-year-olds consulting AI amid long waiting lists for services\n\nIt was after one friend was shot and another stabbed, both fatally, that Shan asked ChatGPT for help. She had tried conventional mental health services but “chat”, as she came to know her AI “friend”, felt safer, less intimidating and, crucially, more available when it came to handling the trauma from the deaths of her young friends.\n\nAs she started consulting the AI model, the Tottenham teenager joined about 40% of 13- to 17-year-olds in England and Wales affected by youth violence who are turning to AI chatbots for mental health support, according to research among more than 11,000 young people.\n\nIt found that both victims and perpetrators of violence were markedly more likely to be using AI for such support than other teenagers. The findings, from the Youth Endowment Fund, have sparked warnings from youth leaders that children at risk “need a human not a bot”.\n\nThe results suggest chatbots are fulfilling demand unmet by conventional mental health services, which have long waiting lists and which some young users find lacking in empathy. The supposed privacy of the chatbot is another key factor in driving use by victims or perpetrators of crimes.\n\nAfter her friends were killed Shan, 18, not her real name, started using Snapchat’s AI before switching to ChatGPT, which she can talk to at any time of day or night with two clicks on her smartphone.\n\n“I feel like it definitely is a friend,” she said, adding that it was less intimidating, more private and less judgmental than her experience with conventional NHS and charity mental health support.\n\n“The more you talk to it like a friend it will be talking to you like a friend back. If I say to chat ‘Hey bestie, I need some advice’. Chat will talk back to me like it’s my best friend, she’ll say, ‘Hey bestie, I got you girl’.”\n\nOne in four of 13- to 17-year-olds have used an AI chatbot for mental health support in the past year, with black children twice as likely as white children to have done so, the study found. Teenagers were more likely to go online for support, including using AI, if they were on a waiting list for treatment or diagnosis or had been denied, than if they were already receiving in-person support.\n\nCrucially, Shan said, the AI was “accessible 24/7” and would not tell teachers or parents about what she had disclosed. She felt this was a considerable advantage over telling a school therapist, after her own experience of what she thought were confidences being shared with teachers and her mother.\n\nBoys who were involved in gang activities felt safer asking chatbots for advice about other safer ways to make money than a teacher or parent who might leak the information to police or other gang members, putting them in danger, she said.\n\nAnother young person, who has been using AI for mental health support but asked not to be named, told the Guardian: “The current system is so broken for offering help for young people. Chatbots provide immediate answers. If you’re going to be on the waiting list for one to two years to get anything, or you can have an immediate answer within a few minutes … that’s where the desire to use AI comes from.”\n\nJon Yates, the chief executive of the Youth Endowment Fund, which commissioned the research, said: “Too many young people are struggling with their mental health and can’t get the support they need. It’s no surprise that some are turning to technology for help. We have to do better for our children, especially those most at risk. They need a human not a bot.”\n\nThere have been growing concerns about the dangers of chatbots when children engage with them at length. OpenAI, the US company behind ChatGPT, is facing several lawsuits including from families of young people who have killed themselves after long engagements.\n\nIn the case of the Californian 16-year-old Adam Raine, who took his life in April, OpenAI has denied it was caused by the chatbot. It has said it has been improving its technology “to recognise and respond to signs of mental or emotional distress, de-escalate conversations, and guide people toward real-world support.”. The startup said in September it could start contacting authorities in cases where users start talking seriously about suicide.\n\nHanna Jones, a youth violence and mental health researcher in London, said: “To have this tool that could tell you technically anything – it’s almost like a fairytale. You’ve got this magic book that can solve all your problems. That sounds incredible.”\n\nBut she is worried about the lack of regulation.\n\n“People are using ChatGPT for mental health support, when it’s not designed for that,” she said. “What we need now is to increase regulations that are evidence-backed but also youth-led. This is not going to be solved by adults making decisions for young people. Young people need to be in the driving seat to make decisions around ChatGPT and mental health support that uses AI, because it’s so different to our world. We didn’t grow up with this. We can’t even imagine what it is to be a young person today.”",

    "fullText": "It’s time we stopped flinching at the assaults of the far right—and started fighting back.\n\nOver the past year, I’ve noticed a pattern among some of my colleagues in public health, biomedical research, and the university settings in which I work.\n\nIt’s a strange, reflexive tic: Faced with bad-faith criticism from malign actors, we shrink back, saying, “Oh, it’s not you. It’s me,” and walk onto their terrain with accommodation in our hearts.\n\nSome may think that, faced with the full fury of the far right, some kind of retreat is the only option. But walking further and further into the mouth of the Leviathan only serves to make you dinner for a very large fish.\n\nIn public health, the reigning trope is that over the past five years, we have lost the trust of ordinary Americans, largely coinciding with the response to the Covid pandemic. It’s an uncritical analysis that we eat up like candy—I have been in so many discussions and heard so many talks about how we need to “regain” or “rebuild” trust—and I think we have to stop and reflect for just a moment.\n\nDavid Wallace-Wells wrote a piece in The New York Times that may indicate that our own conventional wisdom about these matters may be wrong:\n\nThe poll, published in The Argument with the headline “The Covid Political Backlash Disappeared,” showed that respondents largely supported mitigation policies, at least in retrospect. Despite conventional wisdom about public health resentment and liberal overreach, mitigation policies do not appear to have disproportionately cost the Democrats, who were graded more positively than Republicans in their handling of the pandemic and rated more highly on matters of personal health; despite criticism about school closures so pervasive that national Democrats now reflexively apologize for them those closures are still seen by most as having been largely necessary at the time; and although the pandemic experience has damaged confidence in vaccines when it comes to routine shots, the country remains pretty anti-anti-vaccine, with 77 percent of respondents telling The Argument’s pollsters they’d advise friends to follow the standard vaccination schedule and only 15 percent saying they’d advise against it.\n\nWhat Wallace-Wells doesn’t mention here is that much of the conventional wisdom about “public health resentment and liberal overreach” was also the product of a manufactured smear campaign by the right. I’ve written about this before, and Walker Bragman and Alex Kotch have chronicled the far right’s hijacking of the war on Covid since the beginning. Yet too many of my colleagues are like small mammals hypnotized by snakes—mesmerized into submission, in this case, by far-right rhetoric. Yes, we can all agree that public health needs criticism, an analysis of the response to the pandemic included, but we can do better without going belly-up. We’ve got to stop apologizing for the work we do, and take a far less naïve view of the criticisms of public health and separate what is real and substantial from what is ginned-up agit-prop.\n\nWhile some university presidents (at Michigan, Penn and elsewhere) have rolled back DEI programs, Democratic politicians like Gavin Newsom and Pete Buttigieg have decided that trans Americans are politically expendable, and some liberal pundits like Ezra Klein are pushing for (more) Democratic pro-life candidates, in public health and biomedicine, these are issues on which we have to move from “no apologies” to “no surrender.”\n\nRace, gender, and sexuality may be a third rail of American politics for some, but for those of us in public health and biomedicine, these issues are central to our work, and improving the health and well-being of Americans depends on facing them head-on. Jay Bhattacharya, the director of the National Institutes of Health, has made it a mission to destroy research on health disparities in America, even as he speaks out of both sides of his mouth by praising work “that advances the health and well-being of minority populations.” Thousands of grants for work looking at the interaction of race and health outcomes across the country have been terminated. RFK Jr. has slashed the budget and staffing at offices that address minority health in the US at the National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the Health Resources and Services Administration, and at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. Yet, as Mary Bassett, the former health commissioner of New York City and now a professor at the Harvard School of Public Health, has said: “There hasn’t been a single year since Colonial America that the population of Black America hasn’t died younger and died sicker than white America.” Research on and programmatic work to rid us of these gross inequities in health outcomes has to remain a priority for us in public health and biomedical research; otherwise, we are practicing a form of apartheid-style science, where only white lives matter.\n\nAnd this leads us to DEI programs that are meant to ensure that we address the barriers to opportunities in our field. This is an indispensable goal for at least two reasons. The first one is simply pragmatic—we do not know where new insights will come from, so we need to actively recruit talent from every quarter. Pretending that everyone starts their journeys from the same place in our society is farcical. Access to opportunity in the US is tied to race and ethnicity, income, and family background, and it is not a level playing field. As Stephen Jay Gould said in The Panda’s Thumb: “I am, somehow, less interested in the weight and convolutions of Einstein’s brain than in the near certainty that people of equal talent have lived and died in cotton fields and sweatshops.” In a world that has just experienced the worst epidemic in a century, and with the effects of climate change only getting worse, we need everyone off the bench and in the fight. And having a more diverse workforce in public health and biomedicine is important for another reason: There are key discoveries in health disparities that have come from Black and brown researchers, including uncovering the problems with race-adjusted scoring for kidney function, the danger for black mothers of maternal risk algorithms, and the complex issues associated with cardiovascular disease risk assessment among black patients and at the population level, the role of race in disparities in hypertension, diabetes, and all-cause mortality. In infectious diseases, my own field, it was W.E.B. Du Bois himself over a century ago who examined disparities in TB, syphilis, and pneumonia among Black Americans and ascribed these differences to social and economic conditions, discrimination, and racism.\n\nOn sexuality and gender? I work in HIV—the termination of grants and programs on LGBTQ health, particularly trans health, endangers lives full-stop. President Trump, in his 2019 State of the Union address, announced his landmark initiative to End the HIV Epidemic (EHE), and later that month the CDC announced that HIV prevention efforts had stalled out—EHE couldn’t have come at a better time. Almost seven years later, Trump has pulled the plug on LGBTQ health. Trans Americans have some of the highest rates of HIV in this country. Comprehensive care, including gender-affirming hormone therapy, is vital in stemming infections among this vulnerable group. Furthermore, gender-affirming care is “an integral determinant of trans people’s well-being.” Throwing trans people under the bus is bad medicine and bad public health and we should speak up on behalf of our trans sisters and brothers and call out attacks on this community when we see it. Trump and his cronies aren’t interested in the health and well-being of trans Americans; they see another set of people to demonize and target. Remaining silent is being complicit in this scapegoating, increasing health risks for close to 3 million of our fellow citizens. Finally, in the wake of Dobbs, millions of women are now at increased risk of suffering and death as abortion becomes illegal in state after state across the country. It’s a well-known epidemiological fact that legally induced abortion is far safer for pregnant people than childbirth. It isn’t even close: “the pregnancy-associated mortality rate among women who delivered live neonates was 8.8 deaths per 100,000 live births. The mortality rate related to induced abortion was 0.6 deaths per 100,000 abortions.” No matter what you personally think about abortion, interfering with the medical care of pregnant people is a bad public health move. Given that close to a quarter of all women in the US access abortion care in their lifetime, state restrictions on this vital part of medical care risk lives.\n\nAll of these are issues we must hold the line on, not cave over. The instinct to meet people halfway, to compromise, is not a terrible one. But when compromise is the goal in and of itself, it turns out you stand for little or nothing. In the case of the struggles for the future of public health and medicine in this country, this desire to placate the far right has too many people simply shifting their own views to the right. That is, the compromise isn’t really a compromise at all when it’s a one-way affair; it’s a capitulation. So many millions of lives are at stake right now, thanks to policies coming out of this administration. Giving in is giving these people up. And these people are those we have pledged to serve—whether we’re healthcare workers or on the frontlines of public health. We can try to justify this kind of accommodation in any way we want, but in the end, it’s hard to see it as anything but a Judas kiss.",
