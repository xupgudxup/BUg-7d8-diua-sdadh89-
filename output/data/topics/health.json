    "fullText": "I grew up on the shores of Lake Erie, in a town just south of Buffalo, New York. Ice was something we chiseled off a car in winter, not something that's dropped into a drink. For me, life on a tropical island was a pipe dream.\n\nIn high school, I was the geeky kid, always excited to read stories in Time and The New York Times about exotic, far-off places. I knew early on that I wanted a job that would allow me to experience global events firsthand.\n\nA semester abroad in France cemented my ambition. I lived with a family who also rented to an American expat. He talked casually about his Swiss ski holidays, escapes to Greece and Turkey, and his favorite cafés in Paris.\n\nI already knew then, at 21, that was the life I wanted. Why work in \"boring\" New York or Chicago when I could aim for Paris, Hong Kong, or London?\n\nAfter working as an editor in New York City for several years, my then-wife got offered a job in Singapore. It was the golden opportunity we both wanted. What we thought would be a posting of just a few years turned into decades. We divorced in 2011, but both stayed in Singapore, building our careers and lives.\n\nI'd always wanted to be a photojournalist, so in 2000 I decided to pursue it full-time. My location made me a standout. Asia was entering a travel boom, and magazine editors needed photographers on the ground. To paraphrase the cliché: I was in the right place at the perfect moment.\n\nI've shot for National Geographic Traveler across Australia, Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand, and India — Singapore was the perfect base. I could be ready to go anywhere in Southeast Asia with just a few hours' notice.\n\nMy photography career eventually gave way to something more permanent and corporate, although still rooted in Singapore. I became a content director, producing and directing videos across the region.\n\nIt was a natural evolution for a writer-photographer in a world rapidly shifting to digital content.\n\nBut it has come with a cost. My mother grew older, got sick, moved into a managed care facility, and then passed away suddenly.\n\nI made every effort to visit twice a year, especially in the summer and around Christmas. But there was always a tinge of guilt and remorse that I wasn't there more.\n\nOn one of my last trips back before she died, I remember her saying, \"Haven't you been in Singapore long enough?\" She was always supportive of my choices, but as she approached 80, and her health declined, she wanted me closer to home.\n\nShe was getting the care she needed in the nursing home, but there was no substitute for a visit from me, my presence — complete with stories about my life overseas.\n\nWas I selfish? Perhaps, but I also would never trade the life I have.\n\nProbably, although I'm not sure, because everything is different. I remarried three years ago. I have a 9-year-old daughter from a previous marriage and a toddler son with my wife, Jamie. Both kids have US passports and deserve an American identity and a place to put down roots. They've been to the US to meet their cousins and my oldest friends, but have never had the chance to live there or fully experience life as Americans.\n\nRecently, I told my daughter that she'd visited Manhattan when she was a toddler. Her response: \"Where is that?\" It was a stark realization.\n\nThey should know the country that shaped who I am.\n\nWould I recommend an expat life to someone? Absolutely. I got the life I dreamed of. And despite the challenges and distance, it gave me everything I hoped for when I was that kid, growing up near Buffalo, reading about the rest of the world.\n\nDo you have a story to share about living abroad?

    "fullText": "Dr. Mehmet Oz made the case that improving Americans’ health through better diets could transform both the nation's economy and healthcare spending.\n\nOz, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, connected the dots between improved public health and workforce participation during a White House press conference this week. If Americans could stay healthy enough to work just one additional year beyond the current average retirement age of 61, it would “increase the overall GDP of our nation by trillions of dollars,” he said.\n\n“We will reduce healthcare expenses,” Oz said. “At the same time, we jazz up the U.S. economy with trillions of dollars created by the productivity of American workers.”\n\nFast Company Calls It a ‘Groundbreaking Step for the Creator Economy' — Investors Can Still Get In at $0.85/Share\n\nSam Altman Says AI Will Transform the Economy — This Platform Lets Investors Back Private Tech Early\n\nOz praised the Trump administration's updated dietary guidelines, which encourage Americans to prioritize whole foods, proteins and healthy fats while reducing ultraprocessed food and added sugar.\n\n“The best way to reduce drug spend in America is to not need the drugs in the first place,” he said. He said that new guidelines could cut demand for expensive medications like GLP-1 drugs and autoimmune treatments by helping prevent chronic diseases from developing. “You can’t be a wealthy nation without being a healthy nation,” he said.\n\nHe pointed to data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services showing that roughly 30% of Medicare spending, about $300 billion a year, is directly tied to obesity. “If we were to affect obesity by 10%, which is an incredibly conservative and justifiable assumption… just that alone is $30 billion of reduction of expenses for Medicare,” he said.\n\nTrending: An EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace—Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform Before the Raise Ends 1/19\n\nOz highlighted the importance of reaching children early, saying that 53% of U.S. children are covered by Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program. Programs teaching families how to implement the new dietary guidelines, he said, “will dramatically change the natural history of how children are able to participate in life.”\n\nHealth Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said at the press conference that reducing healthcare costs requires upfront investments in education and access to healthy food. “The idea that a cheap meal made of processed food is cheap is an illusion, because you’re paying for it on the back end,” he said. “You’re paying for it with diabetes, with obesity, with illness.”",

    "title": "Noise sensitivity disrupts the mind, brain and body",
    "description": "Though noise sensitivity is often dismissed by doctors, it can have long-term effects on our mental and physical health.",
    "fullText": "Though noise sensitivity is often dismissed by doctors, it can have long-term effects on our mental and physical health.\n\nTap, tap, tap. Tap, tap, tap. There it was again: the incessant noise from my new upstairs neighbours, evidently still in the process of hanging up pictures or cobbling together new furniture. In my well-insulated building in central Berlin, the noise was well below decibels that would irritate anyone else. But it sent me into a rage.\n\nA tight sensation of stress rushed through my body. Even worse was the anxiety: \"When will they ever be finished?\"\n\nThat's not the only noise that is bothering me. I notice the soft thudding across my ceilings as people get ready for bed. Somewhere in the building, I hear the high-pitched hum of a vacuum cleaner and the muffled thumping of a washing machine. The neighbour's dachshund yapping for a treat. And don't get me started on the leaf blowers and pressure washers outside. Noise – however slight – breaks my concentration and peace of mind.\n\nIt is fair to say that I – along with 10% to 40% of the general population – am noise-sensitive, meaning that I feel more upset and disturbed by noise than the average person. It would be easy to dismiss noise sensitivity as a personality flaw, a symptom of generally being belligerent, whiny, and irritable. But, in recent years, scientists have learned that it has real biological roots. The brains of noise-sensitive people respond differently to sound and some may actually be born that way. What's more, it affects not only people's immediate mood but also their long-term mental and physical health. While there are few easy solutions, being aware of these effects can help noise-sensitive people take action to make their lives more tolerable.\n\n\"It's been one of those what we might call a wastepaper basket sort of issues… that just gets pushed away by health professionals,\" says neuroscientist Daniel Shepherd of Auckland University of Technology in New Zealand. Only in recent years \"have people actually really started to say, right, this is at an experiential level really impacting patients\", he adds. \"We really need to actually start getting a handle on this.\"\n\nNoise sensitivity isn't a formal medical diagnosis. People can find out if they're noise sensitive by taking questionnaires like the 21-question Weinstein's noise sensitivity scale (which asks, for instance, if you're bothered by people whispering and crinkling sweet wrappers in a movie theatre, if you get mad at people making noise when you're trying to sleep or work, even if the sound of music bothers you if you're trying to concentrate.)\n\nNoise sensitivity is different from other sound-related conditions like misophonia. This is a specific decreased tolerance to certain sounds, like chewing, throat-clearing, tapping or ticking, which trigger intense feelings of disgust or rage, explains Jennifer Brout, a clinician and the founder of the US-based International Misophonia Research Network. Noise sensitivity is also different from hyperacusis, where people feel pain or extreme discomfort because they perceive sounds more loudly than they actually are.\n\nNoise sensitivity, by contrast, is a general reactiveness to all sounds, regardless of how loud they're perceived or how loud they actually are. At the very least, noise-sensitive people find sound disruptive and become annoyed, angry, or even fearful or anxious. \"I remember a person describing it like having a mosquito flying around you,\" Shepherd says. \"You just can't not attend to it.\"\n\nFor those who are afraid of noise, the condition might make them so stressed that their bodies go into a fight-or-flight response. \"Your heart rate goes up, your blood pressure goes up,\" says Stephen Stansfeld, a psychiatrist and professor emeritus at Queen Mary University of London.\n\nSleep quality can also take a hit. In one 2021 study, researchers tracked the sleeping patterns of 500 adults in China and nighttime noise levels over the course of a week. They found that, while the noise itself didn't affect people's sleep quality, noise-sensitive individuals tended to find their sleep less restorative, rating their sleep as less refreshing and saying they felt moodier and had less energy during the day.\n\nNoise exposure has also been linked to a range of long-term health effects, including heart disease and diabetes – and noise-sensitive people may suffer the most from  mental health impacts, Stansfeld says. In one 2021 study, Stansfeld and his colleagues surveyed 2,398 men in the Welsh town of Caerphilly who were exposed to different levels of road traffic noise. Those who were noise-sensitive were more likely to have long-term anxiety and depression.\n\nWhile that may be partly because anxious people are more vigilant about their surroundings and therefore more likely to notice noise, it's also possible that being noise sensitive can worsen anxiety. And, one 2023 survey of 1,244 adults living near airports in France found that people severely annoyed by aircraft noise levels – especially some noise-sensitive individuals – were more likely to rate their general health as poor.\n\nBut why do some people react more negatively to noise than others? Studies on the brains of noise-sensitive people reveal some clues. When Shepherd and his colleagues hooked people up to devices that measured the electrical activity in their brains, those without noise sensitivity only showed heightened activity when the researchers played them threatening sounds. But in noise-sensitive people, \"their brains tend to go up the gears irrespective of the sound, whether it's a threatening sound or a non-threatening sound\", Shepherd recalls.\n\nBoth Shepherd and the neuroscientist Elvira Brattico of Denmark's Aarhus University have independently found evidence that this has to do with how the brain filters out information about unimportant sounds. Shepherd's team found evidence that in noise-sensitive people, a specific clump of cells within the medial geniculate nucleus – a relay station for sound information entering the brain – are less efficient at this filtering task compared to the brains of those without the condition.\n\nWhere most people can \"filter this information out and get on with life, those who have noise sensitivity don't do it as easily\", he says. This kind of filtering also seems to be important during sleep. While most people show patterns of electrical activity called spindles as they fall asleep, which are thought to be important in getting used to surrounding noise, people with noise-sensitivity have less of them – helping explain why they stay so reactive to sounds that normal people aren't bothered by.\n\nHow brains end up this way, though, is a mystery. One Finnish study on twins suggests that noise sensitivity is often heritable, so some people might be predisposed to have it from birth. But it's also possible that people living in noisy environments develop sensitivity over time, Brattico says.\n\nPeople with anxiety, schizophrenia and autism are especially likely to develop noise sensitivity. While some people can get it after suffering traumatic brain injuries, for most it's usually something that persists over a lifetime, Stansfeld says. \"It is very difficult, as compared to someone who's not noise-sensitive, to actually habituate to sound and actually desensitise to it.\"\n\nThe ideal solution, of course, would be to tackle the sources of noise themselves. Urban planners could build quiet inner courtyards for residential buildings, use rubberised asphalt ingredients that reduce traffic noise, or erect sound-diffracting walls around highways and noisy areas like highways. Some cities in Belgium and France have already begun implementing such measures, as well as reducing vehicle speed limits, encouraging bike infrastructure and creating quiet zones in parks and along rivers. While noise is a real cause of health problems, \"it's also one which is potentially avoidable\", Stansfeld says.\n\nBut progress is slow, leaving many noise-sensitive people to fend for themselves – for instance by avoiding noisy areas, soundproofing their living spaces or turning to earplugs, earmuffs or noise-cancelling headphones. But these methods often just dampen sounds rather than removing them altogether. \"Even quiet noises might be annoying to a noise-sensitive person,\" Brattico says.\n\n• How traffic noise hurts children's brains\n\n• Why noise pollution is hurting your heart\n\n• The rise of highly sensitive parents\n\nSometimes, treating underlying conditions like anxiety with medications may help, Stansfeld says. Cognitive behavioural therapy, a kind of talking therapy that centres on managing one's psychological reactions and behaviours, can make sense in settings where people are afraid of noise. \"I treated somebody myself with cognitive behaviour therapy, and I think it could be quite helpful,\" Stansfeld says.\n\nMeanwhile, Brattico believes that music therapy with qualified practitioners could also be useful, which involves selecting soothing, soft music that calms people and builds positive associations with sound. For those wanting to try self-soothing, Brattico recommends music with few, soft instruments like piano or harp, such as Renaissance or Baroque chamber music. When even music is annoying, art therapy might help – \"something that's relaxing and allows expressions and regulation of emotions\", Brattico says.\n\nAs for myself, it was earplugs, jazz-playing noise-cancelling headphones and a towel wrapped around my head, that eventually helped somewhat. Until the world around me becomes quieter, I can at least try to find some peace in my own mind.\n\nIf you liked this story, \n\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC,",

    "description": "Health care experts are worried about Grok’s potential to breach patient privacy.",
    "fullText": "In Elon Musk’s world, AI is the new MD. The X owner is encouraging users to upload their medical test results—such as CT and bone scans—to the platform so that Grok, X’s artificial intelligence chatbot, can learn how to interpret them efficiently.\n\nHe’s previously said this information will be used to train X’s artificial intelligence chatbot Grok on how to interpret them efficiently.\n\nEarlier this month, Elon Musk reposted a video on X of himself talking about uploading medical data to Grok, saying: “Try it!”\n\n“You can upload your X-rays or MRI images to Grok and it will give you a medical diagnosis,” Musk said in the video, which was uploaded in June. “I have seen cases where it’s actually better than what doctors tell you.\n\nIn 2024, Musk said medical images uploaded to Grok would be used to train the bot.\n\n“This is still early stage, but it is already quite accurate and will become extremely good,” Musk wrote on X. “Let us know where Grok gets it right or needs work.”\n\nMusk also claimed in his response Grok saved a man in Norway by diagnosing a problem his doctors failed to notice. The X owner was willing to upload his own medical information to his bot.\n\n“I did an MRI recently and submitted it to Grok,” Musk said in an episode of the Moonshots with Peter Diamandis podcast released on Tuesday. “None of the doctors nor Grok found anything.”\n\nMusk did not disclose in the podcast why he received an MRI. XAI, which owns X, told Fortune in a statement: “Legacy Media Lies.”\n\nGrok is facing some competition in the AI health space. This week OpenAI launched ChatGPT Health, an experience within the bot feature that allows users to securely connect medical records and wellness apps like MyFitnessPal and Apple Health. The company said it would not train the models using personal medical information.\n\nAI chatbots have become a ubiquitous source of medical information for people. OpenAI reported this week 40 million people seek health information from the model, 55% of which used to bot to look up or better understand symptoms.\n\nSo far, Grok’s ability to detect medical abnormalities have been mixed. The AI successfully analyzed blood test results and identified breast cancer, some users claimed. But it also grossly misinterpreted other pieces of information, according to physicians who responded to some of Musk’s about Grok’s ability to interpret medical information. In one instance, Grok mistook a “textbook case” of tuberculosis for a herniated disk or spinal stenosis. In another, the bot mistook a mammogram of a benign breast cyst for an image of testicles.\n\nA May 2025 study found that while all AI models have limitations in processing and predicting medical outcomes, Grok was the most effectively compared to Google’s Gemini and ChatGPT-4o when determining the presence of pathologies in 35,711 slices of brain MRI.\n\n“We know they have the technical capability,” Dr. Laura Heacock, associate professor at the New York University Langone Health Department of Radiology, wrote on X. “Whether or not they want to put in the time, data and [graphics processing units] to include medical imaging is up to them. For now, non-generative AI methods continue to outperform in medical imaging.”\n\nMusk’s lofty goal of training his AI to make medical diagnoses is also a risky one, experts said. While AI has increasingly been used as a means to make complicated science more accessible and create assistive technologies, teaching Grok to use data from a social media platform presents concerns about both Grok’s accuracy and user privacy.\n\nRyan Tarzy, CEO of health technology firm Avandra Imaging, said in an interview with Fast Company asking users to directly input data, rather than source it from secure databases with de-identified patient data, is Musk’s way of trying to accelerate Grok’s development. Also, the information comes from a limited sample of whoever is willing to upload their images and tests—meaning the AI is not gathering data from sources representative of the broader and more diverse medical landscape.\n\nMedical information shared on social media isn’t bound by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), the federal law that protects patients’ private information from being shared without their consent. That means there’s less control over where the information goes after a user chooses to share it.\n\n“This approach has myriad risks, including the accidental sharing of patient identities,” Tarzy said. “Personal health information is ‘burned in’ too many images, such as CT scans, and would inevitably be released in this plan.”\n\nThe privacy dangers Grok may present aren’t fully known because X may have privacy protections not known by the public, according to Matthew McCoy, assistant professor of medical ethics and health policy at the University of Pennsylvania. He said users share medical information at their own risk.\n\n“As an individual user, would I feel comfortable contributing health data?” he previously told the New York Times. “Absolutely not.”\n\nA version of this story originally published on Fortune.com on Nov. 20, 2024.\n\nOpenAI launches ChatGPT Health in a push to become a hub for personal health data\n\nOpenAI suggests ChatGPT play doctor as millions of Americans face spiking insurance costs: ‘In the U.S., ChatGPT has become an important ally’\n\nAs Utah gives the AI power to prescribe some drugs, physicians warn of patient risks\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

Kennedy Jr. claiming that it has been sidelining patient autonomy, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n“The statements made by the US Secretary of Health are completely unfounded, factually incorrect, and must be rejected,” German Health Minister Nina Warken said in a statement late Saturday.\n\nKennedy said in a video post earlier on Saturday that he had sent the German minister a letter based on reports coming out of Germany that the government was “limiting people’s abilities to act on their own convictions when they face medical decisions.”\n\nThe American health secretary said that “I've learned that more than a thousand German physicians and thousands of their patients now face prosecution and punishment for issuing exemptions from wearing masks or getting COVID-19 vaccines during the pandemic.\"\n\nWarken rejected Kennedy’s claims, saying that “during the coronavirus pandemic, there was never any obligation on the medical profession to administer COVID-19 vaccinations. Anyone who did not want to offer vaccinations for medical, ethical, or personal reasons was not liable to prosecution, nor did they have to fear sanctions.”\n\nKennedy did not give provide specific examples or say which reports he was referring to but added that “in my letter, I explained that Germany is targeting physicians who put their patients first and punishing citizens for making their own medical choices.”\n\nHe concluded that \"the German government is now violating the sacred patient physician relationship, replacing it is a dangerous system that makes physicians enforcers of state policies.”\n\nKennedy said that in his letter he made clear that “Germany has the opportunity and the responsibility to correct this trajectory, to restore medical autonomy, to end politically motivated prosecutions.”\n\nWarken pointed out that there were no professional bans or fines for not getting vaccinated.\n\n“Criminal prosecution was only pursued in cases of fraud and document forgery, such as the issuance of false vaccination certificates or fake mask certificates,\" the minister said.\n\nShe also clarified that in general in Germany “patients are also free to decide which therapy they wish to undergo.”\n\nFormer German Health Minister Karl Lauterbach, who was in charge during the pandemic, also replied, addressing Kennedy directly on X saying that he “should take care of health problems in his own country. Short life expectancy, extreme costs, tens of thousands of drug deaths and murder victims.\"\n\n“In Germany, doctors are not punished by the government for issuing false medical certificates. In our country, the courts are independent,” Lauterbach wrote.\n\nWhile a majority of Germans were eager to get vaccinated against the COVID-19 virus during the pandemic, there were also protests by a small minority of vaccine skeptics in Germany which were sometimes supported by far-right movements.",

    "description": "The new year means new health goals, and for some, that means consuming more protein. I tried 14 high-protein drinks, and some had as much protein as a chicken breast.",
    "fullText": "Cost: $4.99 for 12 fluid ounces\n\nThe taste of the Remedy Organics Cacao Essentials Protein Shake was what I could best describe as healthy.\n\nThe date-sweetened drink is packed with plant-based ingredients, including adaptogens like ashwagandha and maca root powders as well as tapioca prebiotic powder.\n\nBut taste-wise, they weren't as sweet-treat-like as some of the other shakes. It tasted strongly of cacao, but it felt a little chalky, and seemed saltier than it did sweet.\n\nWhile I liked the drink's ingredients, I really disliked the taste. If you're looking for a plant-based, adaptogen-full drink that will also help you reach protein goals, this could be an option for you — but don't go into it expecting a sweet chocolate milk type of drink.\n\nCost: $3.99 for 14 fluid ounces\n\nWhen I first poured the Muscle Milk Zero Sugar shake, I noticed just how dark and thick it was. Tasting it, I found that it was way too sweet for my taste. This, combined with the thick texture, made for a pretty interesting drinking experience — I had to wash down the shake with some water to follow up the sweet taste left in my mouth.\n\nAlthough I couldn't finish drinking the small taste I'd poured myself, it also had the fewest calories and grams of sugar in the ranking, the highest fiber, and I felt like the protein payoff was great, which made the overly sweet taste feel more like a trade-off.\n\nIf you're trying to get half of your daily protein in as few calories as possible while also watching out for sugar content, this drink might be good to have on your radar … but you'll have to remind yourself of the nutrients in every sip.\n\nCost: $4.99 for 12 fluid ounces\n\nCompared to some of the other protein drinks, I found Koia's Cacao Bean protein shake to be very thin and light in color when I first poured it.\n\nIts flavor, as the name would indicate, is very cacao-bean forward. To me, it tasted exactly like cacao nibs, which can lean more nutty and earthy than chocolate-y.\n\nIn a statement to Business Insider, Koia said the Cacao Bean protein shake is \"crafted to highlight cacao's naturally bold, slightly bitter profile rather than masking it with excessive sweetness or artificial flavoring,\" resulting in a flavor that \"may be less sweet than traditional protein shakes.\"\n\nThe almond-based, monk-fruit-sweetened drink, which isn't too sweet and packs in plant-based ingredients like rice, pea, and chickpea protein and a prebiotic blend, wasn't one of my favorites for taste, although it was fairly competitive with the other options in terms of nutrients.\n\nCost: $2.00 for 11 fluid ounces\n\nI found the flavor of the chocolate Sport Shake to be one of the most enjoyable in the ranking, and it reminded me a lot of plain chocolate milk — it was very, very sweet. I also liked that it didn't taste too much like dairy, something that bothered me with other drinks in the lineup.\n\nHowever, the drink's sweet and tasty flavor was overshadowed by its ultra-high added sugar content of 39 grams, or more than 9 teaspoons.\n\nWhile the drink has some fiber in it, coming in with 3 grams, and it was the cheapest of the ranking, I couldn't justify that much sugar. I will probably not reach for this again.\n\nCost: $2.50 for 14 fluid ounces\n\nI was shocked when I learned that Nesquik's classic chocolate milk could be considered a nutritional drink.\n\nAt 14 grams of protein, as advertised on the bottle, the drink has more grams of protein per serving than other drinks labeled as protein drinks.\n\nTasting it was just as nostalgic as expected. Compared to some of the other drinks, however, I noticed it had a stronger dairy taste and was very sweet, with a total of 18 grams of added sugar.\n\nI also noticed that the bottle recommended a portion of half a bottle, probably due to the drink's high sugar content, which would also result in half the protein intake overall.\n\nI probably wouldn't have reached for this in adulthood if not to compare it here, and I probably won't really reach for it again.\n\nCost: $5.99 for 14 fluid ounces\n\nLike its low-sugar version, the Muscle Milk Pro looked dark and thick. Taste-wise, the drink was sweeter than chocolate-y, and I didn't love the flavor.\n\nAlthough the drink packs an impressive 40 grams of protein in 14 ounces and 220 calories, has the highest ratio of protein to fluid ounces, and also has the highest fiber content in the list, the taste was one of my least favorites, and I had to wash it down with some water after tasting, as it had such a lingering flavor on the tongue.\n\nWhen considering the nutritional aspects of the drink, however, I felt like the taste was a solid trade-off for one of the most protein-efficient drinks in the ranking, having the second-highest amount of grams of protein in a single bottle.\n\nBut if you're strictly going for the ultra-high-protein option, the Fairlife Core Power Elite — which comes later in this ranking — might be a better bet for flavor.\n\nCost: $4.49 for 12 fluid ounces\n\nWhen I first poured the OWYN — which stands for Only What You Need — Pro Elite Protein Shake, it looked much thicker than some of the other drinks in the ranking.\n\nIt tasted vastly different from the others, too. The ingredients gave some clues as to why: The main ingredients — water, pea protein, pumpkin protein, and flaxseed oil — were completely different from the other shakes.\n\nThe plant-based, dairy-, soy-, and wheat-free drink, which contains 3 grams of prebiotics, uses monk fruit extract to sweeten its cocoa-heavy flavor, and also has a greens blend that includes spinach, kale, and broccoli.\n\nI figured that the odd flavor I experienced was perhaps due to some of its most health-forward ingredients, like the greens blend.\n\nIn a statement to Business Insider, OWYN said that the exclusion of artificial sweeteners and sugar alcohols in the formula \"sometimes means a more natural, earthy taste profile,\" when compared to their regular shake, which uses a blend of organic cane sugar and monk fruit.\n\nUltimately, I wasn't a fan of the taste and probably wouldn't reach for this drink again, although nutrition-wise, it was a solid ultra-high-protein plant-based option.\n\nCost: $5.99 for 14 fluid ounces\n\nOne of three protein shakes in Fairlife's line, the Core Power Elite shake was a bit thinner than many of the other drinks I tried.\n\nIt was less sweet than Fairlife's regular chocolate milk, which I didn't mind. However, it had a much stronger dairy taste — I don't love the taste of dairy milk, so this worked against the drink for me.\n\nStill, its insane amount of protein — as much as a whole chicken breast — earned it extra points in my ranking.\n\nThis drink was something I didn't mind drinking, even if I wouldn't usually go for it. Even as a non-gym-bro, I would probably reach for this drink if I were trying to get well over half of my needed protein for the day in a single serving.\n\nCost: $2.50 for 11 fluid ounces\n\nWhen I poured the chocolate Nutrament, I noticed its consistency was among the runniest in the ranking.\n\nThe drink, the second-cheapest drink in the lineup, tasted just like chocolate milk, although it was still a bit too sweet for me.\n\nI also noticed it had a long ingredients list with many unfamiliar terms, but on closer inspection, some seemed to be added vitamins and minerals. The drink also had the second-highest added sugar content at 29 grams.\n\nThe high sugar and comparatively low protein knocked this drink down a few points for me, and although I enjoyed it, I probably wouldn't reach for this.\n\nCost: $3.29 for 14 fluid ounces\n\nThe second in Fairlife's line, its chocolate ultra-filtered milk, was another nostalgic offering.\n\nIt was very sweet, but if I were craving chocolate milk, this is definitely the option I would choose.\n\nWhile it's not marketed as a protein drink, it contains 23 grams in a 14-ounce bottle and has the second-lowest cost per gram of protein.\n\nCost: $18.99 for a six-pack of 8-ounce bottles (or $3.17 for 8 fluid ounces)\n\nWhile some of the drinks in this lineup are aimed at the ultra-protein-efficient crowd and others are more directed at children, the Boost nutritional drink line is marketed toward adults with specific nutritional needs. The Boost Plus product, specifically, is aimed at adults hoping to gain or maintain weight.\n\nTaste-wise, this was one of my favorites. The sweet and rich drink was very chocolatey, and it felt like a nice sweet treat.\n\nWith the product's purpose in mind, the drink's higher calories didn't bother me, and I was pleased to see its nutrition label flooded with vitamins and minerals.\n\nOut of many of the options, this is one I could see myself reaching for solely based on its taste, even though I wish it had a higher protein content.\n\nCost: $3.00 for 14 fluid ounces\n\nWhen I poured this drink, I was surprised by how runny it was compared to some of the other options. I really enjoyed the taste, even if it wasn't exactly the same as the nostalgic chocolate-milk flavor of Nesquik's classic option.\n\nIn fact, I actually liked this one more, even before factoring in the added nutritional value. It was adequately sweet, not too dairy-tasting, and it didn't have the aftertaste that had put me off the classic option.\n\nWith 23 grams of protein, this drink could compete with some of its more nutrition-leaning counterparts. At $3 for a bottle, it was also one of the cheapest options with the highest protein content.\n\nI could totally see myself reaching for this.\n\nCost: $4.29 for 12 fluid ounces\n\nCompared to the higher-protein drink on OWYN's line, the regular protein shake wasn't as dark or as thick when I poured it.\n\nWhile the OWYN Pro Elite had a taste I didn't like, the OWYN Dark Chocolate Protein Shake had a simpler flavor that reminded me of chocolate milk.\n\nIt was very tasty and chocolatey, and I liked that it also had 3 grams of fiber.\n\nOverall, this felt like a very solid option that I could see myself reaching for. It was also my favorite plant-based drink.\n\nCost: $4.99 for 14 fluid ounces\n\nWhile this drink didn't exactly feel like a dessert or chocolate milk since it leaned more chocolatey and cocoa-tasting than sweet — and it did have somewhat of a dairy taste — I still found it very enjoyable and a very nice pick for both taste and protein.\n\nTied with the Muscle Milk Zero Sugar for the lowest calories in the ranking, I found the Fairlife Core Power shake much more enjoyable and even winning by a gram in the protein category.\n\nOverall, this drink had the best balance between flavor and nutrition, and I can see myself reaching for it whenever I need a quick post-workout pick-me-up or just want to get a significant portion of my daily protein on the go.",

    "description": "Could a turmeric supplement be the missing piece to your wellness puzzle, or is it just another health trend?",
    "fullText": "Reviewed by Dietitian Maria Laura Haddad-Garcia\n\nTurmeric may help reduce inflammation and joint pain, and it may support heart and gut health.\n\nSafe intake of turmeric supplements is considered up to 8 g, but long-term effects are unknown.\n\nPossible side effects include nausea, diarrhea, liver injury and medication interactions.\n\nIf you’re exploring ways to spice up your wellness routine, chances are turmeric supplements have caught your attention. Praised for their ability to stamp out inflammation, these golden capsules have become popular among those seeking natural ways to support their health. Turmeric supplements are often formulated with enhanced absorption and a higher concentration of potent compounds than what you’d find in the spice you’d typically use in cooking. But do they really live up to their claims?\n\nWe spoke with registered dietitians to break down the benefits, potential risks and what you should know before adding turmeric supplements to your daily regimen.\n\nTurmeric is a golden-yellow spice that comes from the root of the Curcuma longa plant, native to Southeast Asia. With its distinctively warm and earthy flavor, turmeric has been used as a culinary spice and traditional medicine for thousands of years.\n\nIt’s particularly valued for its beneficial compounds. Most notably, turmeric contains active compounds called curcuminoids that have been isolated and studied for their positive effects on the body, says Meghan Pendleton, M.S., RD, a registered dietitian. Within the class of curcuminoids, curcumin is commonly promoted as a beneficial supplement for a myriad of health conditions, as outlined below.\n\nWhile short-term inflammation is a natural and necessary part of the body’s healing process, prolonged inflammation (aka chronic inflammation) can contribute to the onset of chronic conditions. Among natural remedies, turmeric is widely recognized for its ability to combat inflammation. “Its active compound, curcumin, is the driving force behind its anti-inflammatory effects,” says Emily Niswanger, M.S., RDN, a functional registered dietitian. Curcumin supplements have been shown to reduce inflammation by suppressing the pathways that lead to an inflammatory response, Niswanger explains. She adds that curcumin also functions as an antioxidant, helping to clear free radicals from the body that damage healthy cells and tissues.\n\nTurmeric’s anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties have also been shown to alleviate joint pain. “Curcumin can reduce joint pain and stiffness by inhibiting inflammatory pathways, such as cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), which are often overactive in arthritis,” says Erin Kenney, M.S., RDN, a registered dietitian. She emphasizes that studies have shown that turmeric supplementation can be as effective as some nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in relieving osteoarthritis symptoms without the associated side effects, such as indigestion, constipation, drowsiness and dizziness. However, more high-quality research is needed to confirm its effectiveness and determine the optimal dosage for relieving joint pain.\n\nThe curcumin in this golden spice may even boost your heart health. “Curcumin helps reduce systemic inflammation, oxidative stress and LDL cholesterol oxidation, all of which contribute to heart disease,” says Kenney. She highlights that it also improves endothelial function, which supports healthy blood vessel function and circulation. Some research suggests that turmeric supplements may help lower systolic blood pressure when taken for more than 12 weeks. However, no impact has been observed for diastolic blood pressure, says Niswanger. As a reference, systolic blood pressure is the upper number in your blood pressure measurement, whereas diastolic blood pressure is the lower number. While these findings are encouraging, additional research is needed to fully understand the long-term impact of turmeric supplements on heart health.\n\nThe benefits of turmeric supplements may also extend to the gut. “Due to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, curcumin can help reduce inflammation in the gut, potentially benefiting conditions like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD),” says Kenney. She explains that curcumin may also promote a balanced gut microbiome by encouraging the growth of beneficial bacteria and reducing harmful ones. Additionally, she notes that it may support bile production, which is required for fat digestion and overall digestive health.\n\nPendleton says protecting the brain from inflammation and oxidative damage is crucial for maintaining cognitive function, as both are closely linked to the development of neurodegenerative diseases. Curcumin has shown potential in several studies for reducing these harmful processes and improving cognitive outcomes in people with Alzheimer’s disease. However, Pendleton highlights that, while these results are promising, more long-term human studies are needed to fully assess turmeric’s impact on chronic neurological conditions.\n\nWhile curcumin, the active ingredient in turmeric, is generally safe at doses up to 8 grams, it does come with risks. Kenney notes that some individuals may experience common gastrointestinal side effects, including nausea, diarrhea and bloating. Additionally, turmeric supplements may interfere with iron absorption, particularly affecting those with iron-deficiency anemia, explains Pendleton.\n\nRare but serious side effects, such as liver injury, have been reported in case studies involving high-potency curcumin supplements, says Niswanger. Fortunately, symptoms of liver toxicity typically resolve once supplementation is discontinued. Kidney issues, including an increased risk of kidney stones, have also been linked to turmeric supplements.\n\nThe lack of standardized formulations in turmeric supplements raises concerns about quality and safety. Pendleton says that without chemical analysis of every batch, it’s difficult to know the precise composition of the product you’re taking. She adds that contamination with heavy metals, stemming from the soil in which turmeric is grown, is another potential risk due to inadequate safety testing.\n\nWhile some people may benefit from taking turmeric supplements, others may need to avoid them. “Caution is advised for individuals with gallbladder issues, bleeding disorders, kidney stones, or hormone-sensitive conditions,” says Kenney. Pregnant and breastfeeding individuals should avoid high-dose turmeric supplements, as their safety has not been adequately studied in these groups. In addition, people taking certain medications such as blood thinners, antidiabetics, antacids, immunosuppressants and hormone therapies should consult a health care provider before supplementing with turmeric due to potential adverse interactions.\n\nWhen choosing the ideal turmeric supplement, Niswanger recommends sourcing it from a reputable company that performs independent verification. This ensures the supplement is free from high contaminants and contains the ingredients and dosages stated on the label.\n\nFor better absorption and enhanced effectiveness, Kenney suggests choosing a turmeric supplement that contains black pepper extract (piperine)—unless contraindicated. She also recommends taking it with a meal that contains healthy fats to further boost absorption and maximize its benefits.\n\nTurmeric supplements offer a convenient and concentrated way to tap into the potential benefits of curcumin, particularly in reducing inflammation and oxidative stress. While research is promising for conditions like joint pain, heart disease, IBS and Alzheimer’s, more research is needed to confirm its effectiveness. As with any supplement, it’s important to consult a health care provider to discuss your unique medical history, potential side effects and medication interactions associated with taking turmeric. “Turmeric is much safer and more delicious eaten as a whole spice versus a highly concentrated supplement form,” says Pendleton. However, if you do choose to take a turmeric supplement, it’s important to ensure it fits into a well-balanced dietary regimen.\n\nIs it good to take turmeric every day?\n\nTaking a turmeric supplement is considered safe at doses up to 8 grams. However, more research is needed on its long-term use. Before incorporating new supplements into your daily routine, you should always consult your health care provider to discuss potential medication interactions and side effects.\n\nCan turmeric burn abdominal fat?\n\nLimited research suggests that turmeric’s bioactive compound, curcumin, may indirectly support weight management by reducing inflammation and oxidative stress and by improving metabolic health. However, research on this topic is fairly new, with limited studies directly linking turmeric supplements to lower abdominal fat.\n\nWhat organs benefit from turmeric?\n\nResearch suggests that turmeric can benefit several organs, including the heart, joints, gastrointestinal tract and brain. However, more studies are needed before definitive conclusions can be drawn.\n\nWhat cannot be mixed with turmeric?\n\nPeople who take medications like blood thinners, antidiabetics, antacids, immunosuppressants and hormone therapies should avoid taking a turmeric supplement. Combining turmeric with these medications can interfere with their effectiveness or cause adverse side effects. Therefore, it’s always best to consult your health care provider and err on the side of caution when taking herbal and conventional medicines.",

    "fullText": "Exclusive: Guardian investigation finds AI Overviews provided inaccurate and false information when queried over blood tests\n\nGoogle has removed some of its artificial intelligence health summaries after a Guardian investigation found people were being put at risk of harm by false and misleading information.\n\nThe company has said its AI Overviews, which use generative AI to provide snapshots of essential information about a topic or question, are “helpful” and “reliable”.\n\nBut some of the summaries, which appear at the top of search results, served up inaccurate health information, putting users at risk of harm.\n\nIn one case that experts described as “dangerous” and “alarming”, Google provided bogus information about crucial liver function tests that could leave people with serious liver disease wrongly thinking they were healthy.\n\nTyping “what is the normal range for liver blood tests” served up masses of numbers, little context and no accounting for nationality, sex, ethnicity or age of patients, the Guardian found.\n\nWhat Google’s AI Overviews said was normal may vary drastically from what was actually considered normal, experts said. The summaries could lead to seriously ill patients wrongly thinking they had a normal test result, and not bother to attend follow-up healthcare meetings.\n\nAfter the investigation, the company has removed AI Overviews for the search terms “what is the normal range for liver blood tests” and “what is the normal range for liver function tests”.\n\nA Google spokesperson said: “We do not comment on individual removals within Search. In cases where AI Overviews miss some context, we work to make broad improvements, and we also take action under our policies where appropriate.”\n\nVanessa Hebditch, the director of communications and policy at the British Liver Trust, a liver health charity, said: “This is excellent news, and we’re pleased to see the removal of the Google AI Overviews in these instances.\n\n“However, if the question is asked in a different way, a potentially misleading AI Overview may still be given and we remain concerned other AI‑produced health information can be inaccurate and confusing.”\n\nThe Guardian found that typing slight variations of the original queries into Google, such as “lft reference range” or “lft test reference range”, prompted AI Overviews. That was a big worry, Hebditch said.\n\n“A liver function test or LFT is a collection of different blood tests. Understanding the results and what to do next is complex and involves a lot more than comparing a set of numbers.\n\n“But the AI Overviews present a list of tests in bold, making it very easy for readers to miss that these numbers might not even be the right ones for their test.\n\n“In addition, the AI Overviews fail to warn that someone can get normal results for these tests when they have serious liver disease and need further medical care. This false reassurance could be very harmful.”\n\nGoogle, which has a 91% share of the global search engine market, said it was reviewing the new examples provided to it by the Guardian.\n\nHebditch said: “Our bigger concern with all this is that it is nit-picking a single search result and Google can just shut off the AI Overviews for that but it’s not tackling the bigger issue of AI Overviews for health.”\n\nSue Farrington, the chair of the Patient Information Forum, which promotes evidence-based health information to patients, the public and healthcare professionals, welcomed the removal of the summaries but said she still had concerns.\n\n“This is a good result but it is only the very first step in what is needed to maintain trust in Google’s health-related search results. There are still too many examples out there of Google AI Overviews giving people inaccurate health information.”\n\nMillions of adults worldwide already struggle to access trusted health information, Farrington said. “That’s why it is so important that Google signposts people to robust, researched health information and offers of care from trusted health organisations.”\n\nAI Overviews still pop up for other examples the Guardian originally highlighted to Google. They include summaries of information about cancer and mental health that experts described as “completely wrong” and “really dangerous”.\n\nAsked why these AI Overviews had not also been removed, Google said they linked to well-known and reputable sources, and informed people when it was important to seek out expert advice.\n\nA spokesperson said: “Our internal team of clinicians reviewed what’s been shared with us and found that in many instances, the information was not inaccurate and was also supported by high quality websites.”\n\nVictor Tangermann, a senior editor at the technology website Futurism, said the results of the Guardian’s investigation showed Google had work to do “to ensure that its AI tool isn’t dispensing dangerous health misinformation”.\n\nIf you have something to share about this story, you can contact Andrew using one of the following methods.\n\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

The company constantly measures and reviews the quality of its summaries across many different categories of information, it added.\n\nIn an article for Search Engine Journal, senior writer Matt Southern said: “AI Overviews appear above ranked results. When the topic is health, errors carry more weight.”",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — For House Republicans, the political year started with a pep rally of sorts as President Donald Trump gathered them at Washington's Kennedy Center for a stemwinder of a speech. But by the time lawmakers had completed their first week of work this midterm election year, fractures in the party were already showing.\n\nFrom pushback to Trump's self-described “Donroe doctrine” of aggression in the Western Hemisphere to breaks in party unity over health care, Republican lawmakers are displaying signs of independence from Trump after spending much of the last year acquiescing to his practically every demand. It showed a new dynamic in the GOP as Republicans embark on difficult campaign to keep control of both the House and Senate.\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune, speaking at the U.S.-Mexico border Friday with a group of Republican Senate candidates, said that Republicans were “going to be focused like a laser” on issues of affordability and pointed to legislation in the works on housing and health care.\n\nThune's border trip and talk of affordability were a nod back to some of the core themes of Trump's presidential campaign. But the focus in Washington of late has instead been dominated by Trump's military operation to capture Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro, his threats to use military force to take control of Greenland, the release of case files on Jeffrey Epstein and a debate over extending subsidies for insurance offered under the Affordable Care Act — an issue where Republicans have long struggled to find unity.\n\nRecent shootings by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers in several U.S. cities, including one that killed a woman in Minneapolis, have also raised new questions about Republicans' hard-line immigration agenda and shifted attention away from Trump's handling of the border, which they see as a political success.\n\nEven so, Trump still has plenty of command over most of the party. That was demonstrated this week by a pair of unsuccessful House veto override votes in which most GOP members stuck with the president despite previously voting for the low-profile bills.\n\nRep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican who has been one of the few Republicans to consistently defy Trump, said that “there was some bully pulpit intimidation going on” from the president that caused the veto overrides to fail.\n\nStill, Democrats are making the case that Trump is becoming distracted from the needs of Americans, especially after the attack on Venezuela.\n\n“He's lurching towards another endless, expensive war, all the while American families here are struggling with skyrocketing costs,” said Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer.\n\nVenezuela war powers vote draws GOP support\n\nTo prove their point, Democrats are forcing votes on war powers resolutions that would stop Trump from attacking Venezuela without congressional approval. Such measures are rarely successful, but a procedural vote on the legislation drew support from five Republicans Thursday, setting up a final vote next week. House Democrats are also pushing forward a similar resolution.\n\nThe GOP senators who voted for the legislation tried to defuse the conflict with Trump by arguing their positions were in line with his own campaign promises to scale back U.S. commitments overseas.\n\n“A drawn-out campaign in Venezuela involving the American military, even if unintended, would be the opposite of President Trump’s goal of ending foreign entanglements,” Sen. Todd Young, an Indiana Republican who voted for the war powers resolution, said in a lengthy statement explaining his vote.\n\nTrump reacted with fury. The president promptly called for the five Republicans, which included Maine Sen. Susan Collins, who is up for reelection this year, to “never be elected to office again.”\n\nRepublicans are already dealing with retirements from several lawmakers who had uneasy relationships with Trump, and there was worry that such clashes could complicate their campaign picture even more.\n\n“If Susan isn’t the senator from Maine, we’re going to end up with a Democrat,” said Sen. Bernie Moreno, an Ohio Republican. “That would be 10 times worse. But I do appreciate that President Trump is absolutely pissed off.”\n\nGOP pushes back on Trump's Greenland plans\n\nTrump's desire to possess Greenland and his administration's decision not to rule out military force also met significant resistance from GOP lawmakers this week.\n\nSen. Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican who is retiring after crossing Trump last summer, took to the Senate floor to proclaim that he was “sick of stupid.” He specifically criticized White House deputy chief of policy Stephen Miller, who made comments that Greenland should be part of the U.S.\n\n“I want good advice for this president, because I want this president to have a good legacy,” Tillis added. “And this nonsense on what’s going on with Greenland is a distraction from the good work he’s doing, and the amateurs who said it was a good idea should lose their jobs.”\n\nOther Republicans, including Thune and Senate Armed Services Committee chair Sen. Roger Wicker, also gently pushed back on military threats against Denmark, which is a NATO ally of the U.S.\n\nAfter meeting with the Danish ambassador, Wicker said it was Denmark's right not to sell Greenland.\n\n“I’m troubled by Greenland. I'm troubled by some of the things he does. I don’t get it,” said Nebraska Rep. Don Bacon, another retiring Republican. “I do feel like Congress should be more independent and should provide checks and balances here.”\n\nBacon added that Trump still had the ability to “bully” his Republican colleagues, but that Trump's threats had “stiffened my spine.”\n\nHealth care votes expose divisions\n\nDuring Trump's speech at the Kennedy Center on Tuesday, he urged Republicans to own the issue of health care. Yet when the House voted Thursday on a Democratic proposal to extend expired health care subsidies for Affordable Care Act health plans, 17 Republicans broke with party leadership to help pass the bill.\n\n“People recognize the challenge here, which is to address health care affordability,” said Rep. Mike Lawler, a New York Republican who voted for the proposal.\n\nHe still criticized the Affordable Care Act, a hallmark piece of legislation for Democrats, yet the health care debate unfolding in Congress is one that Democrats feel confident making a central campaign issue.\n\n“In this first, full week of the new year, House Democrats — every single one of us joined by 17 Republicans — have partnered in a bipartisan way to protect the health care of the American people,” said House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries following the vote.\n\nJan. 6 plaque coming out of storage\n\nOn the fifth anniversary of the attack on the Capitol, Trump told House Republicans that he had told his supporters to go “peacefully and patriotically” to confront Congress from certifying the 2020 presidential election. The White House also unveiled a website that portrayed the Jan. 6 attack as a “witch hunt” against him by Democrats and some Republicans in Congress.\n\nBut the Senate, which Republicans control, this week agreed to display a plaque honoring the police who defended the Capitol — a cause that has become a point of contention with Trump as president. The plaque had been kept in storage rather than being displayed because House Speaker Mike Johnson had said the memorial did not comply with the law.\n\nIt was Tillis again who pushed the issue on the Republican side. He said it was important to honor the police and staff who risked their own lives and safety that day.\n\nDemocrats who joined in the effort said they were alarmed by the White House's attempt to recast the narrative.\n\n“It's so important we be honest with the American people about what happened,” said Sen. Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat.\n\nThis story has corrected the party affiliation of Rep. Mike Lawler. He is a Republican, not a Democrat.",

    "description": "Experts are urging guideline changes on what health professionals should wear to protect against flu-like illnesses including Covid",
    "fullText": "Experts are urging guideline changes on what health professionals should wear to protect against flu-like illnesses including Covid\n\nSurgical face masks provide inadequate protection against flu-like illnesses including Covid, and should be replaced by respirator-level masks – worn every time doctors and nurses are face to face with a patient, according to a group of experts urging changes to World Health Organization guidelines.\n\nThere is “no rational justification remaining for prioritising or using” the surgical masks that are ubiquitous in hospitals and clinics globally, given their “inadequate protection against airborne pathogens”, they said in a letter to WHO chief Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.\n\n“There is even less justification for allowing healthcare workers to wear no face covering at all,” they said.\n\nAt the height of the Covid pandemic an estimated 129bn disposable face masks were being used around the world every month, by the public and healthcare workers, with surgical masks the most widely available and recommended by most health authorities.\n\nRespirators designed to filter tiny particles – such as masks meeting FFP2/3 standards in the UK or N95 in the US – should instead be standard practice for medical interactions, they said.\n\nAs additional evidence emerged over the course of the pandemic, officials in many countries switched to recommending those masks as more effective.\n\nThe proposals would result in fewer infections in patients and health professionals, and reduce rates of sickness, absence and burnout in the health workforce, the authors contended.\n\nProf Adam Finkel of the University of Michigan School of Public Health, one of the letter’s organisers, said surgical masks were not designed to stop airborne pathogens but “invented to stop doctors and nurses from sneezing into the guts and the hearts of patients”.\n\nSurgical masks are to respirators what the typewriter was to the modern computer, said Finkel, who was chief regulatory official at the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration between 1995 and 2000: “Obsolete.”\n\nThe letter came out of discussions at an online conference organised last year called Unpolitics, looking at the implementation of evidence-based policies. It was authored by seven clinicians and scientists, including Finkel, and has been endorsed by almost 50 senior clinicians and researchers, and more than 2,000 members of the public, including clinically vulnerable patients.\n\nThere could be “off-ramps”, where governments or establishments decide respirators are not necessary, based on factors such as community infection rates, and ventilation or air filtration devices in a room, the letter says.\n\nWhile the suggested guidance would apply only in healthcare settings, where the risk of infection is higher, it is likely to provoke controversy. Face masks became a culture war issue during the Covid pandemic.\n\nIn December, Tory leader Kemi Badenoch said she had been “slightly traumatised by all the mask wearing that we had to do during Covid” in response to comments by an NHS leader saying people with flu symptoms “must wear” a face mask in public.\n\nThe WHO cannot mandate global policies, but the signatories argue that an update to its infection prevention and control guidelines to recommend respirators could have a profound impact.\n\nThey also suggest that the WHO’s procurement infrastructure could help increase access to respirators even in poorer countries, with production of surgical masks phased down over time.\n\nSurgical masks are still “better than nothing”, Finkel conceded, with studies suggesting they block approximately 40% of Covid-sized particles in the air, compared with approximately 80% (and up to 98%) for respirators.\n\nHe says the comparative reduction in risk can be thought of like falling off a wall of four inches rather than four feet: “You can still trip and break an ankle at four inches, but you’re much better off.”\n\nCritics of the group’s arguments point to a lack of randomised controlled trials showing that physical measures slow the spread of respiratory viruses. Finkel and the other authors say such trials are inherently flawed and misleading, for example because people in a trial will not wear masks 24/7 and could be exposed to pathogens while unmasked.\n\nInstead they say physical tests showing that respirators stop particles, conducted in laboratories, offer sufficient evidence.\n\nThe WHO has been criticised for being slow to describe Covid-19 as spreading via “airborne” particles and the letter also calls for it to revisit earlier statements and “unambiguously inform the public that it spreads via airborne respiratory particles”.\n\nProf Trisha Greenhalgh of the University of Oxford, whose research is cited extensively in the letter and is one of its signatories, said: “A germ that does not get inside someone cannot make them sick. By sealing against the face, respirators force airflow to pass through them, filtering out the airborne germs. Respirators are designed to fit closely around the face and meet high filtration standards. Medical masks, in contrast, fit loosely and leak extensively.”\n\nThe letter’s supporters include members of the World Health Network, prominent US epidemiologist Eric Feigl-Ding, and Guardian columnist George Monbiot.\n\nA WHO spokesperson said the letter required “careful review”. They said the organisation consulted widely with experts from different health and economic contexts when producing guidance on personal protective equipment for health workers, adding: “We are currently reviewing WHO’s Infection Prevention and Control guidelines for epidemic and pandemic-prone acute respiratory infections, based on the latest scientific evidence to ensure protection of health workers.”",

    "fullText": "Australians have been experiencing an uptick in a serious mosquito-borne virus, according to ABC.\n\nA case of Japanese encephalitis virus has been identified north-west of Melbourne. The virus was found in a mosquito trap installed in the western community of Horsham by monitoring personnel. This is the first case of the Australian summer, following an original outbreak of the virus in 2022.\n\nThe Japanese encephalitis virus is spread by mosquitoes and can cause fever, vomiting, and seizures. Once in roughly every 250 cases, the virus causes severe inflammation of the brain, which can be fatal. Luckily, most people who contract it experience either mild symptoms or no symptoms whatsoever.\n\nAustralian researchers have previously identified pig farms as major vectors for the Japanese encephalitis virus.\n\nThanks to increased global heat and precipitation due to atmospheric pollution, mosquito populations have been spiking. Along with them have been the viruses they carry. This includes Zika, dengue, and West Nile virus.\n\nResearchers have been busy trying to find new ways to manage explosions of mosquito populations. Some have found that soap can immobilize them without resorting to indiscriminate insecticides. Others have found promising results in a new kind of fungus.\n\nAttacking the root of the issue will require lowering pollution in major sectors such as agriculture, electricity, and transportation. This can stabilize weather patterns and slow the spread of disease-carrying mosquitoes.\n\nWhile up-to-date vaccines are the best front-line defence, Australian authorities suggested a range of precautions to avoid Japanese encephalitis virus infections. These included the use of bug spray, covering up with light-colored clothing, and dismantling stagnant water pools around the home.\n\n\"Anyone can be bitten by mosquitoes, but people living, working or spending time outdoors in northern Victoria — especially near rivers — may be at higher risk,\" said Victoria's chief health officer Caroline McElnay, per ABC.\n\nHow bad are the mosquitoes in your area?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": "Jennifer Aniston, 56, sticks to an 80/20 diet that leaves room for the occasional cheeseburger and fries — and Demi Moore, 63, says she still drinks Red Bull.",
    "fullText": "If there's one question celebrities over 50 never stop getting asked, it's how they stay healthy.\n\nEven interviews meant to promote a new movie, book, or company launch often veer into questions about health and diet.\n\nAfter a while, the answers start to sound familiar.\n\nFrom regular exercise to the morning routines they refuse to skip, the same six habits keep coming up.\n\nAt 100, Dick Van Dyke still hits the gym three days a week. He credits regular exercise with helping him live a long life, and while most people his age aren't exactly itching to work out, he said he can still \"move pretty well.\"\n\nHe is one of several celebrities who say age is no excuse for not being active. Helen Mirren, 80, has long been a fan of a 12-minute military workout developed by the Royal Canadian Air Force in the 1950s — and it remains her go-to.\n\nThey also tend to stick with what works rather than constantly changing routines. Both Martha Stewart, 84, and Jane Fonda, 88, say they've been doing the same exercises for years.\n\n\"I essentially do everything I used to do, just slower,\" Fonda said.\n\nMatt Damon, 55, said cutting gluten helped him slim down to 167 pounds for his latest film, a number he hadn't seen since high school.\n\nHe's not the only one who's made small but intentional changes to his diet. Alex Rodriguez, 50, has dramatically reduced how often he eats meat, and Al Roker, 71, said he's done the same.\n\nBut that doesn't mean they deprive themselves of the foods they enjoy.\n\n\"Moderation rather than deprivation is better in the long run,\" Roker said. \"If you deprive yourself of stuff that you like, eventually you're going to snap and go crazy.\"\n\nJennifer Aniston, 56, takes a similar approach, sticking to an 80/20 rule that leaves room for the foods she actually enjoys, such as a cheeseburger and fries.\n\nEven Demi Moore, 63, who sticks to a meat-free, nutrient-dense diet, can't give up her one guilty pleasure.\n\n\"I mean, I'm not perfect. I still do drink Red Bull. I do love it. But not many. One,\" Moore said.\n\nGetting older isn't something many of them seem preoccupied with. If anything, it's given them more confidence.\n\nFor Jodi Foster, turning 60 marked a turning point after she spent her 50s feeling like she couldn't compete with her younger self.\n\n\"Everything changed. I was like, 'Yeah, I don't care. I'm no longer tortured by any of this. I don't know why I seemed to care so much,'\" Foster said.\n\nSimilarly, Elizabeth Banks, 51, said she approaches aging with a positive mindset. She's happy to let age happen, rather than try to fight it. That goes for Linda Hamilton, 69, as well.\n\n\"I do not spend a moment trying to look younger on any level, ever. I have just completely surrendered to the fact that this is the face that I've earned,\" Hamilton said.\n\nFor both Nicole Kidman, 58, and Melinda French Gates, 61, aging has come with freedom from other people's opinions and a deeper respect for the experiences they've accumulated along the way.\n\n\"Like if I'm not your cup of tea, that's OK,\" French Gates said.\n\nAt this stage in life, many agree that time must be spent intentionally.\n\nKate Winslet said hitting 50 made her reevaluate her definition of success.\n\n\"Success, actually, for me more these days is more about pulling it off, being a decent person. You know, being able to take care of people, having time for friends, also learning how to be OK with not being busy all the time,\" Winslet said.\n\nShe's not the only celebrity who's said that milestone birthdays sparked similar periods of reflection.\n\nBoth Jane Fonda, 88, and Michelle Obama, 61, said that turning 60 was a pivotal moment that made them consider how they wanted to spend the rest of their lives.\n\n\"If I'm lucky, I live to 90 and that's 30 good summers,\" Obama said.\n\nFor Mary Steenburgen, 72, aging has also made her more selective about who she chooses to spend time with.\n\n\"With not wasting time on people that aren't in my life for the right reason, for being honest with myself about life,\" Steenburgen said.\n\nSlowing down also doesn't seem to be top of mind for many of them.\n\nKris Jenner, 70, has been clear she's not thinking about retirement just yet — and neither are Vera Wang, 76, nor June Squibb, 96.\n\n\"I think maybe a little bit like Warren Buffett or Queen Elizabeth II, I'm just going to keep prodding on because I feel as though I'm able to do my best work more and more,\" Wang said.\n\nSimilarly, working keeps Morgan Freeman active and helps ward off the effects of aging.\n\n\"There is a saying about old age — 'Keep moving' — and what Clint Eastwood, 95, says: 'Don't let the old man in,'\" Freeman, 88, said.\n\nWith Bill Nye, 70, staying busy extends well beyond work.\n\n\"I do crossword puzzles,\" Nye said. \"And as an engineer, I'm always designing and making little things.\"\n\nFor many, their mornings tend to be built around a few habits they don't skip.\n\nCindy Crawford, 59, said she eases into her mornings with a Bible podcast, dry brushing, and body oil — all before she even thinks about checking her phone.\n\n\"I probably heard it on a podcast, but it was like 'Think about it. What is the first input you want?'\" Crawford said.\n\nCate Blanchett, 56, said she loves a good icy plunge in the morning to \"jolt\" herself awake.\n\n\"I get up and get in. Five minutes, and it just brings everything back down. Because you have to connect with where you are,\" Blanchett said.\n\nMartha Stewart said she wakes up with the sun — literally, since she doesn't have curtains — and she never skips her morning green juice.\n\n\"If you have my green juice every day, you would just feel great all the time,\" Stewart said.",

    "fullText": "Our fitness expert clocked up his indoor miles to put the best exercise bikes, including simple spin machines and gym-quality models, to the test\n\nThe best treadmills for your home, tested\n\nCycling has the potential to benefit your health in myriad ways, whether it’s the mood-boosting properties of inhaling fresh air, the social element of riding with friends or the simple act of improving cardiovascular fitness with every pedal stroke.\n\nThe UK weather doesn’t always play ball, though, so for those who don’t want a dire forecast to result in a missed workout, indoor training replicates the exercise (if not the fresh air).\n\nThe best exercise bikes are not only fantastic for burning a few calories without donning all the outdoor gear, but they can also help you nail training goals if you’re a more serious rider. With many letting you connect your phone or laptop to make the most of online training tools, it’s never been easier or more enjoyable to work out from your home.\n\nI tested 12 exercise bikes, including the sort you might find in a commercial gym, along with more dedicated riding simulators and recumbent models for those who find it tricky to sit hunched forward for any length of time. The resulting list features those that I think performed best.\n\nWhile I’ve tried to appeal to a wide range of budgets, it’s difficult to recommend much under the £500 mark because the build quality of these cheaper models is often not worth the investment.\n\nBest exercise bike overall:\n\n Peloton Bike+\n\nBest budget exercise bike for beginners:\n\n Horizon 3.0SC indoor cycle\n\nBest compact exercise bike:\n\n Wattbike Proton\n\nBest gym-quality exercise bike: \n\n Technogym bike\n\nBest recumbent exercise bike:\n\n LifeFitness RS3 LifeCycle\n\nWhile I no longer compete in official cycling events, I still consider myself a keen cyclist, often heading out with friends on a gravel bike, even if those rides now end in a warm pub, rather than a timed finish line. But when the weather isn’t playing ball, I’ll get stuck into a home- or gym-based exercise bike session to keep fit and stay in shape for when cycling season comes back around again.\n\nHaving tested exercise equipment for numerous publications, I’m always one to get stuck in and test a product for as long as possible. With exercise bikes, this meant getting plenty of hands-on experience, no matter how sweaty it made me.\n\nExercise bikes are bulky items that typically require an element of setup or construction. To make testing so many of them viable, I either borrowed a pre-assembled machine for one or two weeks or tested the bikes in a dedicated boutique or workout space.\n\nDuring each test, I used any workout modes that were available, syncing a smartphone or laptop to take advantage of third-party software or online classes, if these were offered. The machines were judged on their build quality, features, ease of setup and storage (some companies offer premium white glove deliveries), as well as the overall adjustability or suitability for numerous members of the household.\n\nAfter slipping into a pair of fetching cycling shoes, I assessed noise levels with a smartphone-based decibel meter, and made more subjective assessments on the general ride feel, comfort and the overall quality of the workout experience.\n\nMany rivals have attempted to imitate Peloton, but few have managed to nail its overall experience. Above all, the brand is unmatched when it comes to live and on-demand classes, offering so many options – from a quick 15-minute spin class to hardcore sportive training, and all led by motivating instructors and accompanied by thumping soundtracks.\n\nThe Bike+ is the premium one of the brand’s two exercise bikes and has a 23.8in (huge!) high-definition display, which can be rotated for workouts that involve movements off the machine. There’s also an automatic resistance knob that adjusts to match the levels recommended by instructors during classes.\n\nIt’s expensive, with a £45-a-month “all access” membership fee on top, but for engaging, interactive workouts pitched at a wide range of users, nothing else comes close.\n\nWhy we love it\nAlthough the Bike+ isn’t as aesthetically pleasing as some of its rivals, it’s comfortable, easy to adjust and not too imposing in any room. It also has wheels, so it is relatively easy to tip on its end and move around.\n\nThe touchscreen on the Bike+ is of excellent quality and the sound from its built-in speakers is impressive, but it’s the array of classes that makes Peloton so alluring. Unlike many rivals, which can feel prescribed, mundane and overly technical, Peloton somehow makes a gruelling 45-minute spin session feel enjoyable.\n\nThe weighted flywheel and belt-drive system are quiet enough to not disturb others in the household, although hardcore road cyclists will probably balk at the Bike+ for its lack of cycling realism and the bouncy, frenetic spin-class nature of many of its workouts.\n\nIt doesn’t play nicely with third-party cycling apps – such as Zwift, Rouvy and TrainerRoad – either, so, if that’s important to you, look at the Wattbike Proton below instead.\n\nIt’s a shame that … it doesn’t feel as realistic as some rivals, and there’s a monthly fee to access the classes and features\n\nDimensions: 56 x 137 x 152cm (WLH) \nWeight: 65kg \nDrivetrain: belt-drive with magnetic, digital resistance adjustment\nSimulated grade: N/A\nConnectivity: Bluetooth 5, ANT+, wifi (2.4GHz and 5GHz)\nFolding: no\nNoise level: about 30dB\nMaximum user weight: 135kg \nBuilt-in entertainment: yes, 23.8in rotating HD touchscreen with Peloton classes, Netflix, Disney+ and more\n\nAt the time of writing, the Horizon 3.0SC Indoor Cycle cost £569.99, making it one of the cheapest exercise bikes I tested. But it certainly doesn’t feel cheap or any less capable than many of the other exercise bikes I poured sweat upon.\n\nThe 3.0SC has an ultra-smooth, front-mounted flywheel that uses electronically adjustable magnetic resistance to provide 32 effort levels. All of this is controlled via a funky and futuristic-looking digital dial that responds quickly to inputs – great for jumping out of the saddle during high-intensity efforts.\n\nAlthough this is predominantly designed for use in spin classes, its ergonomically cushioned seat and easy-adjust handlebars make it a comfortable spot to pedal away the hours. Oh, and it’s whisper-quiet too, registering just 32dB during my testing.\n\nIt may not be the sort of thing I’d use to train for an upcoming cycling sportive, but it’s a well-priced tool for hitting daily fitness goals.\n\nWhy we love it\nThe 3.0SC looks great. It even blasts out eight vibrant colours from its flywheel, depending on the RPM and amount of effort you are putting in, adding a bit of Tron-like sci-fi to any room.\n\nAnd aside from its relatively compact proportions and lightweight build, the bike is also well connected, playing nicely with Zwift, Kinomap and other third-party fitness apps. There are more realistic-feeling bikes out there, but if you swap out the pedals for a dedicated clipless system, it’s a fairly convincing road bike. Space between the cranks, for example, is as narrow as possible, making it ride like a genuine road machine.\n\nIf you’re looking for on-demand fitness classes, you can find these via Horizon’s free atZone workout app. Pair your phone or tablet with the bike, mount it to the secure plastic holder at the front of the bars, and you’re good to go. For a free service, there’s an impressive amount of content, and it’ll track your progress over time.\n\nIt’s a shame that … there isn’t an integrated display, meaning you’ll have to bring a tablet or smartphone for any instructor-led workouts.\n\nDimensions: 52 x 107 x 120cm (WLH) \nWeight: 36kg\nDrivetrain: belt drive with ECB (eddy current) magnetic, electronic resistance (32 levels)\nSimulated grade: N/A\nConnectivity: Bluetooth 5 (FTMS compatible for app integration) \nFolding: no (but features transport wheels)\nNoise level: about 32dB\nMaximum user weight: 100kg\nBuilt-in entertainment: no built-in screen; includes tablet holder and syncs with training apps\n\nWattbike is probably best known for its original red, white and black Air bike machines, which can be found in gyms and health clubs up and down the country. The company has since ventured into home-workout territory, and the Proton sits somewhere in the middle of its range, offering a lightweight, compact footprint and support for popular third-party training apps, including Zwift and TrainingPeaks.\n\nRacy looks and confusing workout programmes may risk putting off more casual users, but the Proton is designed to appeal to all of the family – comfortably adjusting for those between 4ft 6in and 6ft 6in tall. It’s not as quiet as some of its rivals, but the Proton feels realistic to ride and even has an auto-adjusting ergometer mode (ERG), so it can simulate gradients and gear changes without you having to lift a finger.\n\nWhy we love it\nWattbike has done an admirable job in retaining a realistic bike feel on such a lightweight and compact machine, with a fully adjustable seat post, saddle and handlebars that make it easy to set up to your requirements. I was able to quickly swap the standard toe-cage pedals for some Shimano clipless ones, which improved my performance and gave me greater control over pedal stroke. Most exercise bikes will allow you to swap the pedals, which takes about five minutes if you have the correct spanner or hex key. Adding cleats and pedals allows you to don a dedicated cycling shoe, which provides better power transfer between the legs and pedals compared with basic adjustable toe cages.\n\nWattbike’s background in working with pro athletes is evident from the Wattbike Hub app, which offers real-time feedback on pedal stroke and efficiency, among other nerdy data fields. The app has been tweaked to appeal to the more casual fitness fanatic, but it’s far from friendly to beginners, and you won’t find the same interactivity you would with a Peloton class. It’s more a case of following graphs and on-screen warnings about form than watching live demos from a bubbly personal trainer.\n\nHowever, there are still plenty of workouts aimed at improving overall health rather than targeting highly trained athletes. And, if you like, you can always mount your iPad in the dedicated holder and binge television or complete a virtual workout session of your choice: the Proton’s Bluetooth FTMS technology means it will work with most third-party apps, such as Zwift, TrainerRoad and Rouvy.\n\nIt’s a shame that … the app isn’t slicker and with more to entice and retain a novice.\n\nDimensions: 57 x 102 x 127cm (WLH)\nWeight: 48kg\nDrivetrain: chain drive with electromagnetic resistance\nMaximum power output: 1,800W\nSimulated grade: up to +25% incline\nConnectivity: ANT+ FE-C, Bluetooth (FTMS compatible for app integration)\nFolding: no; includes front transport wheels for ease of movement\nNoise level: about 40dB\nMaximum user weight: 135kg\nBuilt-in entertainment: no built-in screen; includes tablet holder\n\nTechnogym has been steadily raising the bar when it comes to smart fitness equipment, with a growing line of connected kit that aims to bring the personal trainer experience to your own home.\n\nClearly designed to take on the likes of Peloton, the Technogym Bike is a stylish machine with a 22in high-definition touchscreen that allows access to a raft of Technogym’s live and on-demand content.\n\nIts compact, svelte frame looks and feels as if it’s aimed at more serious cyclists than Peloton’s offering, and the ride experience is smoother and slightly more natural than its rival. There’s plenty of adjustability for different-size riders, while the included double-sided pedals allow for use with trainers or SPD cycling shoes (a clipless shoe system).\n\nThe built-in screen is crisp and easy to navigate, granting access to entertainment apps, including YouTube and Netflix. It rotates to allow for off-bike sessions, too. However, it’s among the most expensive models I tested, and there’s a further membership fee, starting at £8.99 a month. Ouch.\n\nWhy we love it\nThe riding experience is comfortable without straying too far from a realistic simulation, while the powerful flywheel offers punishing levels of resistance. Technogym has live classes, as with Peloton, but it also appeals to the more hardcore athlete with dedicated training programmes geared towards those with ambitions of tackling the Col de Turini.\n\nIf you’re seeking the best in terms of design and build quality – and your bank balance permits the luxury – you’ll be happy with this bike. It’s a handsome, well-built machine that straddles the line between a dedicated cycling trainer and a spin bike well.\n\nIt also works with most third-party training apps and syncs up neatly with Apple Fitness and Apple Watch via a quick-tap NFC panel. For those totally dedicated to Lycra, Technogym offers an even more expensive Ride model, which feels built to compete with Wattbike and Wahoo’s most serious offerings.\n\nIt’s a shame that … it costs so much, and then Technogym charges yet more for a monthly membership.\n\nDimensions: 59 x 121 x 138cm (WLH)\nWeight: 67kg\nDrivetrain: belt drive with magnetic resistance (20 levels)\nSimulated grade: not specified\nConnectivity: supports streaming via external device (eg Chromecast, Fire TV Stick); Apple Watch pairing; Technogym Live integration and third-party apps\nFolding: no\nNoise level: about 30dB\nMaximum user weight: 160kg\nBuilt-in entertainment: yes, rotating display with ability to stream apps (TV shows, movies, games, etc) via smartphone, tablet or laptop\n\nRecumbent bikes are great for those who experience back pain, struggle with past injuries or simply find it daunting or uncomfortable to be perched atop a traditional exercise bike for any length of time. You can achieve the same, low-impact cardio workout while enjoying a more relaxed seating position that takes the pressure off the lower back, leg joints and neck.\n\nLifeFitness is a reputable brand that supplies commercial gym equipment and kit more suited for use at home, with the RS3 sitting between the two. For the money, you get a comfortable, ergonomically fitted seat with backrest, 20 levels of resistance and a step-through design that makes it easy to get on and off. There’s also plenty of adjustment in the seat to get the perfect workout position.\n\nAlthough larger than many more traditional exercise bikes, it can be lifted and moved because of its transport wheels.\n\nWhy we love it\nMore seasoned riders will probably find a recumbent bike a little too laidback, since it’s difficult to transfer maximum power through the cranks from the more relaxed seating position. That said, it’s not really designed for smashing PBs – it’s best placed for longer, low-intensity steady-state cardio sessions.\n\nIt links to Rouvy, Zwift and a bunch of other third-party fitness apps, but the digital offering is otherwise basic, with a handful of built-in and customisable workouts direct from the console. Users can also pair an Apple or Samsung Galaxy Watch for heart-rate tracking and more.\n\nSome recumbent bikes can feel decidedly budget, but that’s not the case here. With excellent build quality and a smooth and quiet ride experience, the RS3 is a comfortable place to work up a sweat without the associated aches and pains.\n\nIt’s a shame that … the Track Connect 2.0 Console is fiddly to use, and there’s no built-in multimedia.\n\nDimensions: 68 x 164 x 131cm (WLH)\nWeight: 69.8kg\nDrivetrain: front-drive magnetic resistance, manual adjustment\nSimulated grade: N/A\nConnectivity: Bluetooth FTMS and NFC for syncing with apps, wireless HR receiver\nFolding: no\nNoise level: under 30dB\nMaximum user weight: 181kg\nBuilt-in entertainment: no, 7in LCD display with Track Connect Console allowing external tablet/smartphone streaming and app integration\n\nIf you’re mad for virtual cycling apps such as Zwift, Rouvy and TrainerRoad, or simply want to replicate that road cycling feel at home, Wahoo’s Kickr Shift is among the best indoor training tools for enthusiasts.\n\nThe saddle, stem height and reach can all easily be adjusted on the fly, and users can even select their desired crank length. Heck, the bike even simulates several electronically assisted gearing group sets from Shimano and Campagnolo, mimicking the way the cogs feel when shifting under load.\n\nIt’s a wonderfully quiet, smooth and powerful machine that works perfectly with dedicated cycling training apps. For those who like to reach for the chamois cream at the weekend, this is the perfect indoor companion.\n\nIt didn’t make the final cut because … the Wattbike Proton feels like a slightly more rounded machine for all the family.\n\nDimensions: 78 x 140 x 110cm (WLH); weight: 36kg; drivetrain: belt drive with electromagnetic resistance; maximum power output: 2,200W; simulated grade: +20% incline, -15% decline; connectivity: ANT+, ANT+ FE-C, Bluetooth, wifi, Direct Connect; folding: no; noise level: under 30dB; maximum user weight: 113kg; built-in entertainment: no built-in screen; requires external device for app/display\n\nBest for: a studio spin bike feel at home\n\nAnother Peloton Bike+ rival, NordicTrack’s indoor trainer is an excellent spinning machine for a smooth yet powerful ride, with a solid dose of realistic-feeling resistance that will feel tough even for seasoned cyclists. It also comes with a whopping 24in touchscreen for immersive online sessions.\n\nGranted, the iFit virtual training environment doesn’t quite compete with the Hollywood sheen of a Peloton class, but it gets mightily close, and the physical bike feels accomplished and more modern than Peloton’s slightly frumpy-looking machine.\n\nIts 20% incline to -10% simulated decline means it also doubles up as an excellent and quite realistic road or mountain biking training tool, with interactive videos that allow you to virtually cycle around some of the most beautiful places on Earth.\n\nIt didn’t make the final cut because … iFit just isn’t up to Peloton’s offering, and the multimedia setup isn’t quite as slick.\n\nDimensions: 55 x 143 x 159cm (WLH); weight: 81kg; drivetrain: silent magnetic resistance, 24 digital levels; simulated grade: +20% incline/-10% decline; connectivity: Bluetooth (headphone & HR monitor), wifi (for iFit), USB-C port, app integration via iFit (syncs with Strava, Garmin, Google Fit, Apple Health); folding: no; noise level: about 32dB; maximum user weight: 159kg; built-in entertainment: yes, 24in pivoting HD touchscreen with built-in speakers, iFit streaming of workouts, classes, and entertainment apps\n\nBest for: a recumbent bike on a budget\n\nOffering a cheaper alternative to the LifeFitness recumbent above, Schwinn’s more basic model majors in comfort and adjustability but wraps it up in a slightly lighter and cheaper-feeling frame.\n\nThe 5.5in segmented LCD screen takes care of the basics, with several built-in workouts to get you going. And there’s always the option to pair a tablet or smartphone and make use of Zwift and other digital training apps.\n\nIt represents excellent value for money, but don’t expect the same sort of build quality as pricier rivals; the handle-mounted heart-rate monitor was hugely inaccurate during my testing, and there are some cheap plastic covers masking some of the fastening bolts. On that subject, don’t expect a white glove delivery service with something at this price.\n\nIt didn’t make the final cut because … it’s not quite as robust as rivals, and the built-in heart-rate monitor was way out during tests.\n\nDimensions: 69 x 163 x 113cm (WLH); weight: 37kg; drivetrain: belt-driven flywheel with 16 levels of manual magnetic resistance; simulated grade: N/A; connectivity: Bluetooth (FTMS compatible for app integration); wireless heart-rate compatibility (strap not included); folding: no; noise level: about 32dB; maximum user weight: 136kg; built-in entertainment: no built-in screen for media; includes a 5.5in LCD console (for metrics and programmes) and a media shelf for tablets\n\nBest for: a gym-quality upright bike\n\nThis model treads the line between a serious studio bike, such as the Peloton Bike+ or NordicTrack X24, and something more relaxed. It has a comfy padded seat, oversized self-balancing pedals and a unique handlebar design that allows for multiple hand positions. Despite the upright positioning, the ride feel is realistic, and there are 30 levels of resistance to contend with.\n\nIt’s expensive, given that the XUR digital console isn’t as good as those from Technogym, Peloton and NordicTrack, but this is a solid, reliable and comfortable bit of kit from one of the biggest names in commercial gym equipment.\n\nIt didn’t make the final cut because … it’s an expensive bike with a less impressive digital offering than cheaper rivals.\n\nDimensions: 63 x 122 x 143cm (WLH); weight: 60kg; drivetrain: Exact Force induction brake (electronically adjustable resistance); simulated grade: N/A; connectivity: wifi (entertainment apps, software updates), Bluetooth (FTMS compatible for app integration, HR monitor, headphones), HDMI port, USB (media and charging); folding: no, includes transport wheels; noise level: about 28dB; maximum user weight: 159kg; built-in entertainment: yes, 22in HD touchscreen with apps including Netflix, YouTube and Spotify, web browser, social media, plus tablet/HDMI mirroring\n\nExercise bikes vary wildly in price, with the cheapest models often taking the form of basic upright or spin bikes that focus purely on pedalling, and the most expensive offering large HD touchscreens, automatic resistance adjustments and fully integrated training platforms.\n\nBudget models typically start at £250-£400, but often lack the build quality and adjustability needed for long-term use. At the other end of the spectrum, premium connected bikes – such as those from Peloton, Technogym and NordicTrack – can set you back £2,000 or more, and often require monthly subscriptions on top for interactive classes.\n\nFor most riders, a budget of between £600 and £1,200 is a good place to start for solid build quality, smooth resistance and decent connectivity features without straying into commercial-gym territory.\n\nEven the most compact exercise bikes take up space, with the smallest options measuring about 55 x 120 x 130cm (WLH). While that’s less floor space than a treadmill or cross trainer, you’ll still need clearance around the bike for safe mounting and dismounting, as well as enough ceiling height to remain comfortable when standing on the pedals.\n\nRecumbent bikes, which offer a chair-like riding position, often require more floor space, while upright and indoor cycles are more compact. It might be tempting to look at folding exercise bikes, but they can often be flimsy and offer weak pedal resistance.\n\nThe most important thing is the resistance system: magnetic resistance is smoother, quieter and requires less maintenance than older friction-based systems found on traditional studio spin bikes. Belt-drive systems are also preferable to chain-driven units for their silent, low-maintenance operation.\n\nAdjustability is another key factor – a bike with multiple saddle and handlebar positions will ensure better ergonomics and comfort over long sessions, and it will also fit more members of the household.\n\nFor those who want to stay entertained, connected bikes with integrated screens and app compatibility (Zwift, Peloton, iFit, etc) can make training more engaging. Heart-rate monitoring and Bluetooth/ANT+ connectivity are also useful for tracking progress.\n\nFinally, noise levels are worth considering, especially if you live in a flat or plan to exercise when everyone else is sleeping. Modern magnetic systems are whisper-quiet, making them perfect for shared living spaces.\n\nLeon Poultney has been a consumer technology and automotive journalist for longer than he cares to divulge.

    "description": "OpenAI  invites you to hand over your medical information. Maybe don't?",
    "fullText": "This week, OpenAI announced its new ChatGPT Health feature, which will let users upload their medical records and ask health related questions. However, I certainly won't be making use of it, it might not be the best idea for you to do it either, for both reliability and privacy reasons.\n\nThe new ChatGPT Health feature will be a sandboxed tab inside the app that is isolated from your conversation history in other conversations with the chatbot. This tab also allows users to connect a variety of health-tracking apps like Apple Health, MyFitnessPal, and Peloton, as well as uploading medical records directly.\n\nIt's important to note that this is a lot of really personal information to hand over to any tech company—but especially one that isn't primarily focused on providing medical services. OpenAI says that the ChatGPT Health space operates with \"enhanced privacy to protect sensitive data,\" but it doesn't use end-to-end encryption to secure that data. And while the company says data collected via Health isn't used to train its foundation models, it's impossible to know whether that may change in the future. Security breaches can also occur (and have in the past), potentially leaving your medical records exposed.\n\nThere's also the question of whether the risk of uploading your data is worth it in the first place. According to OpenAI's own data, around 5% of all messages to ChatGPT are already users asking questions about their health, and ChatGPT (and other LLM tools) have a nasty habit of providing inaccurate diagnostic information. This is perhaps why OpenAI says that its new ChatGPT Health feature is \"not intended for diagnosis or treatment.\"\n\nCurrently, there's a waitlist to At the very least, that means that until the feature is available, it's probably a good idea not to ask the regular version of ChatGPT about your health concerns. At the very least, wait until the enhanced privacy sandbox is available. In the meantime, consider whether it makes more sense to just talk to your doctor directly if you have questions or concerns about your health.",

    "description": "The new feature helps users understand test results, get advice on diets and workouts, and prepare for doctors’ appointments.",
    "fullText": "Amid rising concerns about people relying on ChatGPT for medical advice, OpenAI made its most significant push yet into health care.\n\nThe company has launched a new feature called ChatGPT Health, which allows users in the U.S. to connect their medical records and data from wellness apps and wearable devices with ChatGPT. The tool is designed to help users understand test results, get advice on diets and workouts, and prepare for doctors’ appointments.\n\nMore than 230 million people globally ask ChatGPT health and wellness-related questions every week, according to the company. ChatGPT Health is designed in collaboration with physicians and will “help people take a more active role in understanding and managing their health and wellness,” the company said in a post.\n\nOpenAI said it will look to expand access to the feature in markets such as India, Brazil, Mexico, and the Philippines, where adoption is rising quickly. In these countries, overburdened health-care systems and unequal access to doctors are leading more people to turn to generative AI for guidance.\n\n“We do not have the people, the labor to deliver the care we should,” Jesse Ehrenfeld, chief medical officer at Aidoc, an Israeli medical technology company, said at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. “The only way out of this mess is digital and AI.”\n\nResearchers, ethicists, and medical professionals have warned of the risks to users from biases and hallucinations in AI systems. Concern over the mental health harms that AI chatbots pose is growing. Meta’s AI chatbots provided inappropriate advice to teenagers when talking about suicide and eating disorders, Common Sense Media, a nonprofit research organization, reported last year.\n\nThe family of a teenager who died by suicide has sued OpenAI and its chief executive officer Sam Altman, accusing them of wrongful death. The company said it has safeguards in place to help people, and that it continues to improve ChatGPT’s training.\n\nThere is also the question of data privacy. Health data, particularly information related to mental disease and substance use, is sensitive, and its misuse can leave users vulnerable.\n\nWhile consumer awareness about privacy has increased, people generally do not know how their data is being used, including for marketing purposes or for tracking, Sam Siegfried, a partner at law firm McDermott Will & Schulte, told Rest of World on the sidelines of CES.\n\n“The person clearly trusts an app enough to give it their data,” he said. “But they should understand what they are using the app for, and whether its data requests sync up with what they are using it for.”\n\nOpenAI said ChatGPT Health “builds on the strong privacy, security, and data controls across ChatGPT with additional, layered protections designed specifically for health — including purpose-built encryption and isolation to keep health conversations protected and compartmentalized.”\n\nThere is no stopping tech companies from entering the health sector.\n\nBesides turning to AI chatbots for health queries, people are also buying more wearable digital devices, including smartwatches, rings, bracelets, and glasses, to track physical activity, vital signs, and various physiological responses in real-time. They take this data to their doctors — or to ChatGPT — with questions on how to interpret it or use it to improve their health.\n\n“Health-related anxiety is real. AI is not as good as a doctor, but it’s better than no care at all,” Ami Bhatt, chief innovation officer at the American College of Cardiology, said at CES.\n\nOpenAI isn’t the only big tech company keen to tap the health-care sector.\n\nApple was among the first to offer health-tracking features in its smartwatch. There are millions of health-related videos on YouTube and TikTok, with nearly 60% of Americans watching health-related videos on YouTube.\n\nHealth is “one of the major use cases for Gemini,” Nichole Young-Lin, women’s health clinical lead at Google, said at CES.\n\n“People are using generative AI as a health resource around the world,” she said. “The patient-physician relationship is very important, but health-care access is not equal. Patients feel empowered with generative AI.”",

    "description": "The \"Huberman Lab\" podcast host says good health comes down to \"intentionally high cortisol in the morning and intentionally low cortisol at night.\"",
    "fullText": "Andrew Huberman says one simple morning habit helps him optimize his physical and mental health.\n\nThe neuroscientist and podcaster said people should aim for high cortisol in the morning and low cortisol at night.\n\nThe \"best way\" to spike morning cortisol levels is to get daylight soon after waking up, he said.\n\nStanford neuroscientist Andrew Huberman says one morning habit plays a key role in his overall health.\n\nIn an interview with GQ published on Monday, the host of the popular \"Huberman Lab\" podcast shared the routines he's relying on to stay healthy in 2026.\n\n\"Getting your physical health right — which puts your mental health in the best possible place — is all about intentionally high cortisol in the morning and intentionally low cortisol at night,\" Huberman told GQ.\n\nAlthough cortisol has a bad reputation as a stress hormone, Huberman says it plays an important role in how the body transitions from sleep to wakefulness.\n\n\"No, you wake up in the morning because of a rise in cortisol. You want a big, massive spike of cortisol in the morning. If you don't spike your morning cortisol, your cortisol spikes in the afternoon or evening, and then everything goes awry, OK? You want your morning cortisol at least 30x higher than your nighttime cortisol,\" he said.\n\nOne way to keep that rhythm on track would be to send the body a signal.\n\n\"The best way to spike your morning cortisol is to get bright light — ideally from sunlight — in your eyes in the first hour after waking. If you can't do that, maybe invest in a 10,000 Lux artificial light,\" Huberman said.\n\nIf that's not possible, he suggests flipping on \"as many artificial lights as you can.\"\n\n\"I've made a mistake in the past — a tactical mistake, a strategic mistake — by calling it sunlight. People say, 'It's overcast.' What we should say is, 'Get daylight in your eyes,'\" he said.\n\nHaving dim mornings and bright nights is \"the worst way to go,\" he added.\n\nLight exposure isn't the only thing Huberman says matters in the morning. He also encourages people to fit in a workout if they can.\n\n\"If you don't have time to exercise first thing in the morning, you need bodily movement. Even some knee bends, some arm swings, some jumping jacks. Movement generates cortisol and adrenaline,\" he said.\n\nWhen it comes to winding down at night, people should take the opposite approach, Huberman said.\n\n\"If you want to wear BluBlockers, you can. But dim the lights down, avoid caffeine. If you're going to exercise, don't make it terribly intense,\" he said.\n\nThe benefits of getting light in the mornings are supported by broader research in the field.\n\nMariana Figueiro, professor and director of the Light and Health Research Center at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, told Business Insider in 2023 that getting daylight is \"just as important as diet and exercise.\"\n\n\"Light in the built environment is not always strong enough to synchronize the biological clock,\" Figueiro said. \"The beauty of daylight is that daylight is the right amount, it's the right color, it's on at the right time.\"\n\nMoreover, getting enough darkness at night is just as crucial, since circadian disruption has been linked to poor cognitive performance and a weakened immune system, Figueiro said.",

    "description": "Rajan Chidambaram and Renzo Sanio bought a property and built a cabin. After getting input on social media, they leaned into adding wellness amenities.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Rajan Chidambaram and Renzo Sanio, two 23-year-olds who built a cabin and turned it into a wellness retreat in Front Royal, Virginia, a town about 70 miles outside Washington, DC. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nRenzo Sanio: When I got interested in real estate development, I was told that it's the riskiest way to play the real estate game, but you can create the most impact in the physical world.\n\nThey were not wrong about it being the riskiest way to play the real estate game.\n\nWhen you build something, everyone wants to have an influence over what you're building — from the county, to the local covenants for what siding you have, to the building code. Ultimately, everything lands on the owner to handle it all.\n\nWe had zero experience in handling these complications that came up when we started building our cabin. We're also not well capitalized — we'd been saving money to buy the property, but took out a $300,000 construction loan to build the cabin — so you can barely even call us a developer. We're just two college students who decided to take on a really big project while we were still in school and soon to graduate.\n\nI started to do some research and found that by 2030, one out of three travelers is going to decide to book a place based on its wellness offerings.\n\nThen Rajan made a video speaking about wellness, and it gained a lot of traction.\n\nA post shared by Rajan Chida (@chida.rajan)\n\nRajan Chidambaram: The video went ballistic. I had an insane amount of health influencers follow me — I had Kyrie Irving follow me off of that video. It was insane.\n\nTo this day, I don't fully understand why that video resonated so much, but it really brought to our attention that we can marry wellness with the type of asset that we're building. And, obviously, the demand is there, so we were like, \"This is just the angle that we want to go.\"\n\nSanio: It was always our plan to add a hot tub, a sauna, and a cold plunge, but now we're doing things like red light therapy inside the cabin.\n\nWe're also offering Normatec compression sleeves, and completely fleshing out the inside with sustainably sourced woods, non-toxic paints, non-toxic and fragrance-free soaps, all these little details.\n\nWe ended up landing about $30,000 over our expected budget, and that's just because as we grew on social media, we got more and more excited about the kinds of things that we could offer our guests.\n\nWe really got to splurge on those items because of all the attention we saw on social media. We thought we could offer guests a really good experience now because of all the demand.\n\nA post shared by Rajan Chida (@chida.rajan)\n\nChidambaram: We have a thesis that this is where society is shifting toward — especially with the rise of AI and all this other stuff. People are going to crave real experiences, so that's where our heads were at.\n\nSanio: There's this whole wave of AI and digital this, digital that, but we've really designed this space for it to be a way to disconnect from that. This space has no TV, and it has games and features inside that we've curated to have people really connect with themselves, but also connect with the people that they go there with.\n\nChidambaram: The growing pains have been more on learning the operational side of stuff, like fixing stuff for guests right before they come. There were a lot of things we didn't expect.\n\nHow can you even prepare for your power going out because the county was cutting down trees?\n\nIt's very cold up in the mountains, and one time we lost power for a couple of hours, and it froze one of our pipes to the hot tub.\n\nOur water comes out of a spigot, and it was properly insulated, but the outside of the spigot wasn't, so it froze.\n\nThree hours before a guest came, I drove up there and bought a heat gun. The hot tub needed to be filled in the next three hours, and I didn't have a choice. I started heating up the spigot, and the water came out.\n\nSo now we're thinking, how can we have the people in place to solve these unexpected problems that will happen? Because it's just not a matter of if — it's when.\n\nWe were also really delayed for about three months because of windows. Tariffs kind of hurt us. We were at a standstill for about three months.\n\nSanio: Our windows were fully framed, but you can't do any interior work until you're what's called \"dried in.\"\n\nBecause if you have holes in everything and gas in your windows, and then you install your electrical system, the rain's just going to get to it. So we couldn't do anything until those windows came in, and we got the windows from Poland, and the tariffs slowed down that import process, which is why we were held after three months.\n\nThen there was an inspection to test the air tightness of our build — which there's a regulation for. There's just so many regulations and so many inspections. It's not just one inspection at the end.\n\nAfter we started to look into the wellness themes, we really wanted to flood the space with natural light, so we signed a $6,000 change order to have two more skylights installed. There was no budget for it, it was just something that we knew we wanted to have.\n\nThe total build came out to about $350,000 for the first cabin — we plan to build more on the property — and the land was about $37,000. We spent about $16,000 on furniture, fixtures and equipment.\n\nChidambaram: We've had a handful of guests so far. All of December is booked out, plus more than half of January, and a good amount of February and March, too.\n\nSanio: January and February are the slowest months for short-term rentals, and we've been killing it. Rajan handles marketing, property management, and booking, and we've been 100% occupied for those months.\n\nChidambaram: Our nights are dynamically priced, so weekends are a lot more expensive than weekdays. We also use software that takes into account holidays.\n\nA good goal for 2026 is to try to hit an average of $450 a night. But right now, nights are going to be somewhere in the ballpark of $330 to $490.\n\nSanio: It's challenging doing something so complicated for the first time. We're doing something that's typically only reserved for people with a lot of experience in construction or real estate development.\n\nWe're encouraged by our online community — most of the audience that has followed along on social media are young people and aspiring entrepreneurs.\n\nChidambaram: They've seen our whole project come from literally nothing — like ugly trees and dirt to what it is now. I think that's a special connection that people feel to watching us grow.",

    "description": "Noodle dish is nation’s favourite comfort food and source of civic pride – but it has health risks",
    "fullText": "Noodle dish is nation’s favourite comfort food and source of civic pride – but it has health risks\n\nThe road to ramen paradise ends in the unlikeliest of places. At Men Endo, located in a suburban street, next to a school and a low-rise apartment block, bowls of noodles disappear in a flurry of slurps, gulps and hurried but heartfelt exchanges of appreciation between customer and chef.\n\nOn a cold afternoon in Yamagata, a city in Japan’s northeast, the wait for a seat at Men Endo’s counter is mercifully short. Inside the door, a ticket dispenser lists myriad options, from regular shoyu (soy sauce) ramen – in small, medium or large portions – to maji soba, a soupless symphony of toppings, sauce and noodles that diners are invited to mix together with their chopsticks, along with a spoonful of spicy miso.\n\nThat Men Endo – men is from menrui, the Japanese word for noodles, and Endo is a family name – has managed to secure a loyal clientele – which today includes construction workers, couples and a solo diner from the Guardian – is no mean feat.\n\nIn Yamagata, 340km north of Tokyo, noodle fiends have around 230 establishments to choose from, with several opening their doors early for those craving comfort food.\n\n“People here don’t ask each other where they want to go for dinner, but which ramen restaurant to go to,” says Osamu Higuchi, assistant manager in Yamagata’s brand strategy section.\n\nIt is that level of dedication to eating at restaurants – as opposed to making ramen at home or grabbing a lunchtime cup of the instant variety – that has earned Yamagata, a modestly sized city of 240,000, the title of Japan’s ramen capital.\n\nThe accolade is a source of pride, its current reign the result of an aggressive campaign to outperform its closest rival, Niigata, which shocked the ramen world by taking the title in 2021.\n\nLast year, Yamagata’s households each spent an average of ¥22,389 [£106] on ramen – well ahead of second-placed Niigata on ¥16,292, according to the internal affairs ministry, which will soon announce the winner for 2025. Only the annual ranking for gyoza consumption generates similar levels of anticipation. That title currently belongs to Hamamatsu in central Japan.\n\n“When Niigata won it was a huge shock,” says Higuchi. “Eating ramen is a big part of daily life here … to be honest it hurt our feelings.”\n\nBut the city’s appetite for ramen has its drawbacks. Frequent consumption can increase health risks, mainly due to the soup’s high salt content, according to a study of almost 7,000 people aged 40 and over led by Yamagata University. People who have the dish three or more times a week have a mortality risk 1.52 times higher than those who eat it once or twice a week, according to the four-year study published in October in the Journal of Nutrition, Health and Aging.\n\nThe experts added, however, that the statistics did not mean regular consumption was a “definite danger”, given that those most at risk possibly indulged in other habits “common among frequent ramen” eaters, such as excessive overall salt intake, drinking and smoking.\n\n“I’ve been trying not to drink all of the soup, but it’s very moreish, and the chefs go to a lot of effort to make it so it feels rude to leave any,” says Higuchi who, after consulting a smartphone app, announces he has polished off 225 bowls of ramen so far this year. “That said, households here spend an average of about ¥2,000 a month on ramen … it’s not that much when you think about it.”\n\nHealth risks aside, no Japanese dish commands as much loyalty, or generates as much discussion, as ramen. Popularised in Japan after the second world war – thanks to returning soldiers who fondly recalled how it had sustained them in Japanese-occupied China – it became a symbol of recovery and resilience.\n\nRamen critic Rikiya Yamaji believes Yamagata has perfected the art of adapting what was originally a Chinese dish to suit the Japanese palate. “Ramen has been around in Japan since the Meiji era [1868-1912], but became particularly popular when it was served at food stalls after the war,” said Yamaji, who gets through 30 bowls a month and has been known to visit several ramen shops a day.\n\n“A distinctive feature of Japanese food culture is its ability to ‘localise’ dishes introduced from overseas … curry rice is a good example. In the same way, ramen has evolved into new food culture with a uniquely Japanese approach, like Tex-Mex cuisine in the US. It used to be considered cheap and filling, and it’s still convenient and inexpensive, but these days there is more emphasis on quality and fusion ingredients.”\n\nThe noodle dish with humble origins is now the yardstick by which Japan’s regions measure their culinary caché, triggering fierce rivalries and competing claims to have achieved the perfect marriage of soup, noodles and toppings. Varieties range from miso ramen in the far north, to those sitting in a pale but pungent pork-based broth in the deep south.\n\nThe roots of Yamagata’s obsession lie in the aftermath of the 1923 Great Kantō Earthquake, which killed more than 100,000 people in the Tokyo area. Ramen chefs who fled the destroyed capital to work at soba restaurants in Yamagata shared their ramen-making skills and found a population with an appetite for steaming hot noodles to get them through the city’s bitterly cold winters. Households would order ramen, rather than trays of sushi, to serve to guests – a custom that gave children an early introduction to a dish they continued to eat into adulthood.\n\nAfter it ceded its title to Niigata a few years ago, ramen shop owners and officials in Yamagata teamed up to create an organisation dedicated to re-establishing the city as Japan’s “ramen kingdom”.\n\nHiguchi is confident Yamagata will retain the title when the government announces the 2025 results in early February. “If our ramen businesses do well, then so does the local economy – farmers and soy sauce manufacturers, even the companies that produce hot towels for restaurants,” he says. “I don’t think it’s going too far to say that Yamagata is ramen.”",

    "description": ": Workers face new mental health pressures as they shift from doing tasks to babysitting agentic AI",
    "fullText": "A report on occupational health warns that AI adoption may paradoxically increase workplace burdens rather than reduce them. As AI automates routine tasks, workers will shoulder new responsibilities: overseeing AI systems, catching their errors, and managing the resulting complexity – potentially triggering mental health pressures.\n\nResearchers from Imperial College London and Microsoft argue the real impact won't be mass job replacement, but a fundamental shift in work demands. Human roles will evolve from performing tasks to stewarding AI agents across workflows, including briefing them, reviewing outputs, and correcting errors.\n\n\"As AI absorbs routine tasks, human roles may shift toward stewardship, problem-solving, or emotional labor, all with their own psychological demands,\" said Dr Lara Shemtob, who led the research published in the Society of Occupational Medicine's (SOM) journal Occupational Medicine.\n\nThis effectively transforms workers into managers of AI systems – a role not everyone is suited for. The report warns AI may \"paradoxically increase the knowledge worker's burden of handling complex tasks while simultaneously exerting downward pressure on compensation.\" This means more responsibility and less pay, because AI supposedly makes work \"easier.\"\n\nAll of this could introduce novel occupational hazards, some familiar in form but different in scale and complexity, raising stress levels.\n\nEvidence already supports this concern. A 2024 study found AI coding tools actually slowed developers down due to time spent checking and correcting AI-generated errors. As AI systems become more autonomous, problems like \"hallucinations\" (false or inaccurate outputs) may escalate and become harder to detect.\n\nUntil now, much of the debate over AI has centred on the extent to which it will (or maybe won't) replace people's jobs.\n\nThe report urges quantifying AI supervision demands and building them into job descriptions to avoid hidden workloads that negate automation benefits.\n\nResearchers don't yet know the exact impact on human employees from having to work more closely with AI, the report concludes, but they say occupational health should be part of the dialog and analysis of how AI changes expectations of workers.\n\nWhether this scenario materializes remains uncertain. Recent reports show companies have invested tens of billions in generative AI with little return, and many projects fail due to underestimated deployment complexity.\n\nThe question isn't just how AI will change work, it's whether widespread adoption will happen at all. ®",

    "fullText": "It's only been days since an audacious U.S. raid snatched Nicolás Maduro from a Venezuelan military base and sped him to a Brooklyn prison, yet Detroit-area Trump supporter Aaron Tobin can already see it all playing out on the big screen.\n\nIt'll be the subject of movies for years to come, he predicts. “I am thrilled.” Plenty of others who voted for President Donald Trump and spoke to The Associated Press about the raid are applauding, too — at least for now.\n\nThe seizure of Venezuela's authoritarian leader and his wife has forced another reckoning on the “Make America Great Again” coalition, already rocked by the Trump administration's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files and strained by rising health insurance premiums and living costs.\n\nTrump promised his voters that “America First” would stand against more foreign entanglements. Instead, he intervened with force and without congressional approval in a new frontier, a South American capital so far from Washington that Google Maps says it “can't seem to find a way there.”\n\nThe geopolitical action film that Tobin sees in his mind is only at its opening scene, before all the complexities of uprooting a foreign government by a U.S. president's fiat come rushing in. U.S. forces entered and exited swiftly. But what happens next?\n\nTrump finds early but not endless support\n\nEarly on, the pushback from congressional Republicans and Trump's core constituencies has been guarded, in contrast to their uproar over the Epstein episode or the tensions coursing through Republican politics over the now-expired health insurance subsidies.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, Trump voters interviewed by AP journalists around the country praised the operation and expressed faith in Trump's course. But not always limitless faith. They did not all back up Trump's claim that those who “voted for me are thrilled. They said, ‘This is what we voted for.’”\n\n“I support him so far,” Paul Bonner, 67, told AP while browsing at a Trump merchandise store in Bensalem, Pennsylvania. “Until he messes up, I support him.”\n\nTrump's apparent willingness to stay involved in Venezuela and his intensifying rhetoric about expanding U.S. power elsewhere in the hemisphere are making some of his die-hard supporters nervous.\n\nNot all of them are reaching for the popcorn yet.\n\nIn Mississippi, a conflicted Trump voter\n\nChase Lewis, 24, of Philadelphia, Mississippi, said the move caught him off guard and he still isn’t sure whether he supports it. “It’s good that they’re finally freed from that dictatorship,” he said of Venezuelans, “but I don’t know what it’s going to cost us.”\n\nHe added: “I don’t want my friends that are serving right now to be dragged into a war because we went and stuck our nose in Venezuela’s business.” He noted that Trump had campaigned against starting new wars. “Depending on how you look at it,” he said, “this was an act of war.”\n\nAn electrician apprentice who gave up his delivery job because he needed to make more money, Lewis said he wants to see the Trump administration focus on bringing down costs for young people like himself. He also wants the president to make life better for veterans and worries about plunging the country into more conflicts.\n\nIn Colorado, cheers and caution from Trump voters\n\nTo Trump voter Travis Garcia, leaning against his red pickup truck on a chilly evening in Castle Rock, Colorado, it’s a slam-dunk. “Of course I’m going to be happy that they captured a dictator that’s constantly sending drugs our way,” he said, “If we’re not gonna do it, who’s gonna do it?”\n\nThe 45-year-old, who works in remodeling, said the operation reinforces Trump's stature as “a powerful man who follows through on his word and isn’t going to be shy and timid and let other countries run the rules.”\n\nMary Lussier, 48, a flight attendant from the town of Larkspur, was so amazed by the success of the mission in Venezuela that she would be OK with more such operations. She recalled videos of Venezuelans tearfully celebrating Maduro's removal and said fewer bad leaders “would make the world a little bit lesser of a bad place.”\n\nStill, Lussier wouldn’t want U.S. soldiers stuck in a prolonged conflict, and much of her admiration for the operation hinged less on the possible benefits to the U.S. than on the smooth efficiency and bravado of the raiders.\n\nOutside a Safeway grocery store in Castle Rock, Patrick McCans, 66, said delicately that Trump's intervention was “a little contrary to what he campaigned on.”\n\n“I would like to see more of a diplomatic way of making change,” said the retired engineer. Still, he said, pondering for a moment, “I think in this case it might have been warranted.”\n\nInstead of playing ball, Maduro was “playing chicken with Trump, and Trump doesn’t like chicken,” he said, chuckling from beneath a Baltimore Ravens baseball cap.\n\nThe Colorado Trump supporters interviewed by AP all applauded the military operation’s smoothness and “class,” as one described it. But that support could waver if the U.S. is drawn into a longer conflict, which none of them would support.\n\nFew mentioned Trump’s plans for Venezuela’s oil, but thought Maduro's removal would benefit citizens and slow the drug trade and immigration to the U.S.\n\nFrom Pennsylvania: Good riddance to Maduro\n\nAt the Golden Dawn Diner in Levittown, Pennsylvania, Ron Soto, 88, expressed unreserved faith in the president's ability to manage what comes next. The retired tractor-trailer driver regularly visits the diner to meet friends, drink coffee and catch up.\n\nMaduro is an “awful man,” he said. But should U.S. forces go into other countries, like Cuba, as it did in Venezuela? “I don’t think they’ll have to,” he said. “Because he (Trump) put the fear in them.”\n\nAs for Trump's comment at one point that his administration would “run” Venezuela, Soto said the president will “straighten that country out and make it into a democracy if he can. I don’t know if he can.”\n\nAt the Neshaminy Mall, in Bensalem, retired firefighter Kevin Carey, 62, pronounced himself supportive of what Trump did but aware of the risks.\n\n“I wouldn’t say thrilled but I’m cautiously optimistic,” he said. Carey recalled the seizing of U.S. hostages by Iranian revolutionaries in 1979 as an indication of what might happen if the conflict escalates. But “he'll take all actions to avoid that, I believe,” he said of Trump.\n\nOn any further foreign intervention, Carey broke out laughing when he said: “He wants Greenland to be part of America!”\n\nAt the Trump merchandise store where Bonner shopped, banners and other items proclaiming “Trump 2028” are on display. Trump is constitutionally prohibited from running in 2028.\n\n“I know he can’t run for president” in 2028, said Bonner, a propane company worker. Still, he wanted a lawn sign “just to irritate people” but didn't find one.\n\nThe crisp military operation plainly left him impressed. “They got in and they got out, did what they had to do,” he said. Of Maduro, he said: “He’s an enemy of the United States so I support Trump 100%.”\n\nExiting a Walmart in Martinsville, Indiana, Mark Edward Miller, 75, from nearby Mooresville, said the only thing that surprised him about Trump's intervention was that word of it did not leak in advance. The consistent Trump voter was an aircraft maintenance specialist in the Air Force before his retirement.\n\n“I don’t feel like he’s actually taken over a country,” Miller said. “I believe that he’s doing exactly what our country should be doing — supporting, especially in our hemisphere, governments that are friendly with us” and challenging those that are hostile.\n\nTobin, the man in Michigan who sees a cinematic future for the raid, not only approved of the operation but wants more of them.\n\n“Especially if they were as successful as this last one where we didn’t lose any troops, we didn’t lose any planes or ships,” Tobin said during a visit to the Oakland County Republican Party headquarters, where he was surrounded by Trump and GOP memorabilia. “I am thrilled and surprised” by what happened.\n\n“Cuba’s very nervous right now,” he said. “And the Cuban people are suffering immensely from their horrible situation and their economy. Iran might be next.”\n\nThe three-time Trump voter is an active member of the local Republican Party, a certified firearms instructor and head of a bicycling group in his hometown of Oak Park, Michigan.\n\nHis takeaway: “President Trump does not speak idly. If he says he’s going to do something, he does something.”\n\nBedayn reported from Colorado, Catalini from Pennsylvania, Householder from Michigan, Bates from Mississippi, Lamy from Indiana and Woodward from Washington.",

    "fullText": "Jelly Roll is opening up about what it took to lose nearly 300 lbs.\n\nIn an interview with Men’s Health published in January 2025, he explained, “I just remember everyone telling me GLP-1s, or taking the Ozempic or the Mounjaro, 'Listen, it's gonna hurt your stomach a little bit.’ I've treated my body so bad, I can't believe God's gave me this voice for this long. I didn't deserve it. I literally didn't do it out of fear.”\n\nThe musician also revealed he was hospitalized. “Even before I got into getting my blood work done, I went and got mental health therapy about my overeating. I started treating my food addiction like what it was: an addiction. Why did I treat cocaine a certain way? I went to meetings for cocaine and found a sponsor and detoxed off of it and s*** myself and went through real hard life-changing emotional choices to get off cocaine and codeine,\" Jelly Roll shared. \"I didn’t look at the food addiction different. Once I started treating food like an addiction, it started changing everything for me.\"\n\nThough Jelly Roll didn’t use GLP-1, he was prescribed metformin, a drug used to treat diabetes. Keep scrolling to learn more about the drug and how it helped the singer lose weight.\n\nJelly Roll Reveals He Can Fit in Louis Vuitton Amid Weight Loss Journey: ‘Pray for My Bank Account’\n\nAccording to Harvard Health, the drug was approved for use in Europe in 1959 and in the United States in 1995. It is the most widely used drug for the treatment of diabetes for people who cannot control their blood sugar through diet and exercise.\n\nHarvard Health also noted that the drug has other benefits. These include the treatment of prediabetes (the drug can delay the onset of symptoms), gestational diabetes (which some pregnant women develop), polycystic ovarian syndrome (the drug can help regular the menstrual cycle), and weight gain from the use of antipsychotic medicines.\n\nResearchers are also currently studying if the drug can help lower the risk of cancer for people who have type 2 diabetes, lower the risk of dementia and stroke and prevent age-related diseases.\n\nJelly Roll worked with nurse practitioner Danese Raxroad, who treated him through Ways2Well. Jelly Roll was diagnosed with levels of insulin he described to Men’s Health as “super high.”\n\n“Insulin is designed to help glucose enter the cell,” Raxroad told the outlet. “When you have an excessive amount of insulin, it forces your body to store fat. So switching those receptors and switching what Jelly’s body was signaling with insulin helped him rapidly adjust his insulin resistance. I wasn’t doing a big science experiment. It was just meal timing and eating real foods.”\n\nThe goal for Jelly Roll was that the drug would help reduce his triglycerides, the fat cells in his blood.\n\nLike many drugs, metformin does have side effects. According to Harvard Health, these can include minor gastrointestinal problems such as stomach upset and nausea; some people can also have a severe allergic reaction or suffer from lactic acidosis, a build up of lactic acid in the bloodstream.",

    "description": "Spinach is cheap, versatile and backed by research. Studies link it to heart health, digestion and eye health — plus easy ways to eat more.",
    "fullText": "We are all aware of the numerous health benefits of vegetables. However, some can be a bit of a hassle to prepare and cook. One that’s seriously good for you and ridiculously easy to add to meals is spinach.\n\nAvailable in almost every supermarket and costing just £1.15 for a 250g bag, the leafy green is packed with nutrients that researchers have linked to heart health, digestion, energy levels and even eye health.\n\nA big part of its appeal is its versatility. Spinach can be eaten raw or cooked, wilted, blended or sautéed, making it ideal for adding to everything from omelettes to pasta sauces, salads, curries and even green juices.\n\nSpinach is low in calories but rich in vitamins and minerals. A small serving contains vitamin A, vitamin K, potassium, magnesium and fibre – nutrients that support everything from bones to digestion.\n\nIt also contains antioxidants that can help protect cells from damage caused by everyday wear and tear in the body.\n\nBecause spinach contains fibre, it can also help support digestion and gut health by keeping things moving and feeding beneficial gut bacteria.\n\nOne area researchers have focused on in particular is the potential impact of spinach on blood pressure.\n\nSpinach contains natural compounds called nitrates. When eaten, the body turns them into nitric oxide, a substance that helps blood vessels relax and widen, allowing blood to flow more easily.\n\nResearch suggests this process can lead to small but meaningful reductions in blood pressure and support healthy blood vessel function. Studies examining diets rich in nitrate-containing vegetables have also found a link to lower resting blood pressure over time.\n\nSpinach also provides potassium, a mineral that can help balance sodium levels in the body – another important factor in maintaining healthy blood pressure.\n\nEye health: Spinach contains antioxidants that may help protect the eyes and are linked to a lower risk of age-related vision problems.\n\nBone health: It also contains vitamin K, which plays a role in bone strength and helps the body use calcium properly.\n\nImmune support: Vitamin C in spinach supports immune function and helps the body repair tissues.\n\nHere’s how you can easily add more spinach to everyday meals:\n\nBlend into a green juice with apple, cucumber, mint and lemon\n\nStir a handful into scrambled eggs or an omelette\n\nAdd to a breakfast wrap with eggs and mushrooms\n\nUse spinach instead of lettuce in sandwiches, salads or wraps\n\nStir into soup or ramen just before serving so it gently wilts\n\nToss into a grain salad with quinoa, chickpeas and lemon\n\nStir into pasta sauces or curries at the last minute\n\nServe wilted spinach alongside fish, chicken or tofu\n\nBlend into a quick spinach pesto with garlic, olive oil and nuts\n\nFrozen spinach also works well in cooked dishes like soups, curries and pasta sauces, and is a budget-friendly option that lasts a bit longer, too.\n\nFor most people, spinach is a safe and nutritious food to incorporate into a balanced diet. However, there are a couple of situations where it’s worth being mindful.\n\nSpinach is high in oxalates, so people with a history of oxalate kidney stones may be advised to limit how much they eat, rather than avoiding it completely.\n\nAs it’s also rich in vitamin K, this could affect how some blood-thinning medications work. If you take medication such as warfarin, it’s best to consult your GP before making any significant changes to your spinach intake.\n\n4 superfood soups to batch cook now (Yahoo Life UK, 3-min read)\n\nThe cheap superfood fruit you're almost certainly not buying (Yahoo Life UK, 4-min read)\n\nThe 80p superfood with 4 key health benefits (Yahoo Life UK, 4-min read)",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — There are few signs that President Donald Trump’s supporters wanted the United States to become more embroiled in foreign conflicts ahead of its military actions in Venezuela — even as many Republicans show initial support for his military strike there, according to an Associated Press analysis of recent polling.\n\nMost Americans wanted the U.S. government to focus in 2026 on domestic issues, such as health care and high costs, rather than foreign policy issues, an AP-NORC poll conducted last month found. Meanwhile, polling conducted in the immediate aftermath of the military operation that captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro suggested that many Americans are unconvinced that the U.S. should step in to take control of the country.\n\nAnd despite Trump’s suggestion that the U.S. may take a more expansive role in the Western Hemisphere, Republicans in polling last fall remained broadly opposed to the U.S. getting more involved in other countries’ problems.\n\nThere’s still room for public opinion to shift as Trump's administration clarifies its next steps for Venezuela. But it could be a challenging issue for the Republican president, particularly given Americans’ desire for the government to fix economic issues at home.\n\nForeign policy and drug trade weren’t high priorities for many Americans\n\nHeading into the new year, Americans were less likely to want the government to focus on foreign policy than they had been in recent years.\n\nAbout one-quarter of U.S. adults listed foreign policy topics — such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Israel or general involvement overseas — as something they wanted the government to prioritize in 2026, according to an open-ended AP-NORC question that asked respondents to share up to five issues they wanted the government to work on in the coming year. That was down from the prior two years, when roughly one-third of Americans considered foreign issues an important focus. Almost no one specifically named Venezuela.\n\nMaduro pleaded not guilty to federal drug trafficking charges on Monday in New York. His capture followed U.S. strikes on boats that the Trump administration said were carrying drugs from Venezuela to the U.S. Despite the Trump administration’s focus on the issue of drug trafficking, it doesn’t register at the top of Americans' lists of issues for the government to focus on. Few Americans mentioned drug-related issues as a priority, and it was primarily a Republican issue. About 1 in 10 Republicans mentioned it, compared with hardly any Democrats or independents.\n\nInstead, Americans overall were more focused on domestic issues — including health care, economic worries and cost-of-living concerns — as top priorities for the government.\n\nMore Americans say the US should not run Venezuela\n\nAmericans are split about the U.S. capturing Maduro — with many still forming opinions — according to a poll conducted by The Washington Post and SSRS using text messages over the weekend. About 4 in 10 approved of the U.S. military being sent to capture Maduro, while roughly the same share were opposed. About 2 in 10 were unsure. Republicans broadly approved of the action, while Democrats were largely opposed to it.\n\nNearly half of Americans, 45%, were opposed to the U.S. taking control of Venezuela and choosing a new government for the country. About 9 in 10 Americans said that the Venezuelan people should be the ones to decide the future leadership of their country.\n\nIn December, a Quinnipiac poll found that about 6 in 10 registered voters opposed U.S. military action in Venezuela. Republicans were more divided: About half were in support, while about one-third were opposed and 15% didn’t have an opinion.\n\nFew Republicans wanted the US more involved in the world’s problems\n\nOnly about 1 in 10 Republicans wanted the U.S. to take a “more active role” role in solving the world’s problems, according to an AP-NORC poll from September. They were much less likely than Americans overall, or Democrats and independents, to say the U.S. should become more involved. Most Republicans, 55%, said the current U.S. role in global issues was “about right.”\n\nIt could be a tricky position for a president who ran on a promise of putting “America first” and ending the country’s involvement in “forever wars.” About 7 in 10 voters who backed Trump in the 2024 presidential election said that they wanted the U.S. to take a “less active” role in solving the world’s problems, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of interviews with registered voters in all 50 states.\n\nBut at least in that poll, which was conducted before the military operation that removed Maduro, Trump's supporters still were largely behind him: About 1 in 10 Americans who voted for Trump in 2024 felt he had deserted the “America First” promise, while the overwhelming majority felt he had kept it.",

    "description": "The health reporter Kim Schewitz used to recoil at the sight of healthy foods. Now, her habits make eating enough fruit, vegetables, and fiber easy.",
    "fullText": "I try to eat 30 different types of plant foods a week for a healthy gut microbiome.\n\nIt might sound like a lot, but I manage it as a recovering picky eater who doesn't meal prep (I'd rather spend my precious Sunday afternoons lying down).\n\nAs a child (read: young adult), I recoiled at the sight of greenery on my plate. I looked at a raspberry and saw only unappealing little hairs. Even a slice of buttered whole wheat toast had me running for the door because it tasted too healthy.\n\nAround five years ago, I realized that I needed to expand my culinary horizons, if not for the enjoyment then for my health. Fruits, vegetables, as well as wholegrains, legumes, nuts, and seeds, not only contain micronutrients and vitamins crucial for bodily processes and general health, they're also high in gut-friendly fiber.\n\nA 2018 study called The American Gut Project found that people who ate 30 plant foods a week had more \"good\" bacteria and less \"bad\" bacteria in their guts than those who ate 10. It gave me an easy framework to follow for eating healthily.\n\nGut health has strong links to overall health. As well as digestion, the gut microbiome, the trillions of microbes that live in the colon lining, is thought to influence our mood, skin, hormones, immune system, weight, and possibly even cancer risk.\n\nResearch suggests that a diverse gut microbiome is a healthy one, and that eating a wide range of fiber-rich foods, i.e., plants, boosts diversity.\n\nHere are the four time-saving habits I've built in the past five years that help me eat 30 plant foods a week.\n\nI always keep a bag of spinach and a bag of kale in my freezer and add them to any meal lacking veggies.\n\nDark leafy greens not only contain fiber, but are high in chlorophyll, the molecule that gives them their rich color. Chlorophyll is densely packed with essential nutrients, including iron, magnesium, and nitrogen.\n\nIt takes seconds to reach for a handful of frozen leaves, and I can add them to almost anything I'm cooking, from pasta sauce or curry, to scrambled eggs. It involves no preparation or additional steps, and instantly makes any meal more nutritious.\n\nWhile I can quickly whip up vegetables and protein, I often find it's the carb element of my meals that takes the most time to prepare.\n\nWhen I cook whole grains like brown rice or quinoa, I make extra to put in a sandwich bag and freeze. I also buy bags of pre-cooked grains, which I love to add to salads or eat with fish and veggies.\n\nKeeping my kitchen stocked with pre-cooked whole grains, dry whole wheat pasta, and frozen whole wheat sourdough speeds up cooking and are great sources of fiber.\n\nI've previously written about the high-fiber breakfast I eat every day, which consists of Greek Yogurt, berries, peanut butter, and a selection of nuts and seeds.\n\nI switch up the ingredients depending on what I have in the cupboard, but typically it provides me with around seven different plant foods and around 7 grams of fiber.\n\nIt's so quick to put together and helps me start my day with a big hit of fiber.\n\nI set myself a goal of buying at least three types of vegetables a week, and making sure I eat them before they spoil.\n\nIf they don't pair well with my meals, I eat them as a snack. For example, I recently chopped up a whole cabbage, cooked it down on the stovetop with garlic, ginger, soy sauce, and rice vinegar, and warmed up little portions throughout the week whenever I felt like it. It took about 15 minutes.\n\nI find this helpful little challenge gets me in the habit of adding more plants to my diet because I get dopamine from \"winning\" the game.\n\nNow that I've developed these habits, I don't worry too much about hitting my plant count because I know I'm consistently eating fiber-filled, nutritious foods.",

    "description": "The \"Huberman Lab\" podcast host says good health comes down to \"intentionally high cortisol in the morning and intentionally low cortisol at night.\"",
    "fullText": "Stanford neuroscientist Andrew Huberman says one morning habit plays a key role in his overall health.\n\nIn an interview with GQ published on Monday, the host of the popular \"Huberman Lab\" podcast shared the routines he's relying on to stay healthy in 2026.\n\n\"Getting your physical health right — which puts your mental health in the best possible place — is all about intentionally high cortisol in the morning and intentionally low cortisol at night,\" Huberman told GQ.\n\nAlthough cortisol has a bad reputation as a stress hormone, Huberman says it plays an important role in how the body transitions from sleep to wakefulness.\n\n\"No, you wake up in the morning because of a rise in cortisol. You want a big, massive spike of cortisol in the morning. If you don't spike your morning cortisol, your cortisol spikes in the afternoon or evening, and then everything goes awry, OK? You want your morning cortisol at least 30x higher than your nighttime cortisol,\" he said.\n\nOne way to keep that rhythm on track would be to send the body a signal.\n\n\"The best way to spike your morning cortisol is to get bright light — ideally from sunlight — in your eyes in the first hour after waking. If you can't do that, maybe invest in a 10,000 Lux artificial light,\" Huberman said.\n\nIf that's not possible, he suggests flipping on \"as many artificial lights as you can.\"\n\n\"I've made a mistake in the past — a tactical mistake, a strategic mistake — by calling it sunlight. People say, 'It's overcast.' What we should say is, 'Get daylight in your eyes,'\" he said.\n\nHaving dim mornings and bright nights is \"the worst way to go,\" he added.\n\nLight exposure isn't the only thing Huberman says matters in the morning. He also encourages people to fit in a workout if they can.\n\n\"If you don't have time to exercise first thing in the morning, you need bodily movement. Even some knee bends, some arm swings, some jumping jacks. Movement generates cortisol and adrenaline,\" he said.\n\nWhen it comes to winding down at night, people should take the opposite approach, Huberman said.\n\n\"If you want to wear BluBlockers, you can. But dim the lights down, avoid caffeine. If you're going to exercise, don't make it terribly intense,\" he said.\n\nThe benefits of getting light in the mornings are supported by broader research in the field.\n\nMariana Figueiro, professor and director of the Light and Health Research Center at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, told Business Insider in 2023 that getting daylight is \"just as important as diet and exercise.\"\n\n\"Light in the built environment is not always strong enough to synchronize the biological clock,\" Figueiro said. \"The beauty of daylight is that daylight is the right amount, it's the right color, it's on at the right time.\"\n\nMoreover, getting enough darkness at night is just as crucial, since circadian disruption has been linked to poor cognitive performance and a weakened immune system, Figueiro said.",

    "fullText": "A hapless Donald Trump made a show of the Air Force One stairs as he stepped off the presidential jet after a two-week stay at his Mar-a-Lago bolthole.\n\nTrump arrived in Palm Beach County early on Dec. 20 for a 15-day stay and returned to Washington, D.C., via an airbase in Maryland on Sunday evening. But as he descended the steps of AF1 to board Marine One for his onward journey, several possible tell-tale signs of weakness became apparent.\n\nThe Daily Beast has dutifully reported on the waning physical power of the 79-year-old president, with major players such as The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal joining the conversation later. Trump admitted to the latter that he has sought medical help for a myriad of issues.\n\nIn that unusually candid interview last week, he conceded that he visited Walter Reed Military Medical Center in mid-July after suffering “mild swelling” in his lower legs and said an ultrasound showed he has “chronic venous insufficiency,” a common ailment in older people that makes it more difficult for the blood to travel to the heart from the legs through smaller veins.\n\nThis, perhaps, contributed to Trump making the relatively simple task of walking down some steps and then in a straight line, and then up some even smaller steps, look like a gargantuan effort.\n\nTV footage captured the charade. Trump is seen emerging from the door of the jet before gripping the handrail and appearing to let his legs drop abruptly onto the steps. He gingerly descends before pawing for a second handrail as his eyes remain fixed on the red carpet in front of him.\n\nHis hair comedically flaps in the wind as he takes on the second portion of the stairs, even slower than the first. He steps out onto the tarmac at Joint Base Andrews and takes a breather, saluting the gathered officials and waving to the press.\n\nHe then embarks on a long arc towards Marine One, where he veers wildly to the left of the door, stopping for chats along the way. The short walk, in which he also drags his right leg, takes what feels like an age. He appears jaded as he ascends the tiny staircase into the chopper, which brought him back to the White House.\n\nTrump has made a hash of the AF1 steps plenty of times in the past and more frequently of late. In a video showing such an instance from just before Christmas, Trump appears at the aircraft door and slaps his right leg three times with his right hand before heading down the stairs cautiously.\n\nJust before the New Year, his old foe—steps—appeared to rankle him once more. The president cautiously climbed down the steps at the main entrance of his Mar-a-Lago estate as he welcomed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to discuss the Gaza peace plan.\n\nTrump glanced down at the short staircase before him as he waited for Netanyahu to come forward.\n\nTrump hasn’t been coy about his fear of stairs. In September, he admitted that he was wary of publicly stumbling and falling like his predecessor Joe Biden, who was 82 when he left the White House.\n\n“Every day, the guy’s falling down stairs,” Trump told military generals who were gathered in Quantico. “I’m very careful. You know, when I walk downstairs—like I’m on stairs, like these stairs—I walk very slowly. Nobody has to set a record. Just try not to fall because it doesn’t work out well... Just walk nice and easy. You don’t have to set any record.”",

    "description": "With sensors on a handle, and a screen to display data, the Body Scan 2 may replace a smartwatch in addition to a smart scale.",
    "fullText": "Withings launched their $600 Body Scan 2 smart scale at CES Unveiled last night—but they're positioning it as a \"longevity station\" rather than a smart scale. The device has a handle in addition to the footplate, which allows for extra sensors, and the new features include things like hypertension notifications that we've previously seen from smartwatches. (Hypertension notifications only just came to the Apple Watch a few months ago.)\n\nI got to see the Body Scan 2 at a CES event but haven't had a chance to use it for myself. According to Withings, the Body Scan 2 can measure \"60+ biomarkers\" that it says are relevant to tracking your health over time. With the caveat that I'm asking the company \n\nSmart scales generally aren't very accurate for data like body fat percentage, or really anything that goes beyond simple body weight. A typical smart scale runs a weak electrical current from one foot to another, measuring the electrical resistance of your lower legs. The Body Scan 2 adds a handle with electrodes, which brings the upper body into the mix. The screen on the handle also allows it to display data like ECG readings or other detailed results. Since the screen is in your hands, you don't have to squint at a display at your feet. (In product photos, the retractable handle sits on top of the footplate, but at yesterday's demo, Withings had the handles mounted on little holders at hand height.\n\nThis setup allows for more detailed data than smart scales can usually measure. For example, a Withings rep told me yesterday that it can measure arterial stiffness by comparing the timing of your pulse in your torso, hands, and feet—the faster blood flows between these areas, the better. The Body Scan 2 uses impedance cardiography, a well-studied technology that can measure several aspects of heart health, and it includes a six-lead ECG. This means you can get ECG data and hypertension notifications—two headline Apple Watch features—without having to wear a watch every day.\n\nThe scale isn't yet available for sale, but Withings estimates that it will be available in the second quarter of this year, pending FDA clearance for some features. The price will be $599.95. Withings already sells a first-generation Body Scan scale, with a handle but with fewer sensors and without a screen on the handle, for $399.95.",

    "description": "In a yearlong interview with Men's Health, Jelly Roll opens up about his struggles with addiction, topping the scales at more than 520 pounds in 2020, and how he's managed to lose half his body weight.",
    "fullText": "Jelly Roll (aka Jason Bradley DeFord) is loving the new life he's worked hard to achieve. The Grammy-nominated country superstar opened up with Men's Health about his weight-loss journey, opening up about some of the startling things he learned at the beginning, and how far he's come.\n\nTopping out at more than 520 pounds (Jelly explained that his scale maxed out there and he could not move it at all, \"so it could have been 560, it could have been 528.\" Jelly said he reached his maximum weight around 2020.\n\nWorking with The Ultimate Human founder Gary Brecka and wellness clinic Ways2Well, Jelly started by getting himself under 500 pounds and assessing where he was. He was also adamant that he didn't want to use GLP-1 drugs to achieve his results, saying, \"I don't want an asterisk next to my name, bubba. I want to show people that this is possible.\"\n\nMen's Health notes that after publication, Jelly did admit to trying these drugs for two weeks before committing himself to achieving his goals without them.\n\nAt the start, he took a full blood panel, and learned some startling results about his insulin levels, \"super high\" and his testosterone levels, super low.\n\n\"When you have an excessive amount of insulin, it forces your body to store fat,\" Ways2Well nurse practitioner Danese Rexroad told Men's Health. \"So switching those receptors and switching what Jelly’s body was signaling with insulin helped him rapidly adjust his insulin resistance. I wasn’t doing a big science experiment. It was just meal timing and eating real foods.\" He was also put on a drug to treat Type 2 diabetes.\n\nHis A1C, which measures sugars in the blood, was so high, Jelly said that \"the first couple of blood panels were like, how are you alive?\"\n\nThe other number that left the singer truly shocked was his T. \"My testosterone level -- and I’m cool to talk about this openly -- was of a preteen boy,\" Jelly told the magazine. \"When I went in there for the test, it was bad. Bad. The world opened up when I seen it on paper. I was like, That’s my testosterone level? I mean, dude, we’re talking a 57.\"\n\nA normal t-level for a man Jelly's age is between 300 ng/dL to 900 ng/dL, while obesity commonly reduces those numbers. But a reduction in testosterone can have a huge impact on a man, and especially when it comes to his romantic life.\n\nJelly went there, talking about struggles in his intimate relationship with Bunnie Xo, with whom he's been married since 2016. \"You can’t get it up without T,\" he said candidly. \"I was married to a smoke show, and I was still struggling.\"\n\nHe said that a team came together to look at the root causes behind his health issues, rather than just give him medications to address the symptoms, though medication is a part of the process. \"I'll be on testosterone replacement therapy probably for the rest of my life,\" Jelly admitted to Men's Health.\n\nNevertheless, what his body could adjust and change for the better, Jelly says has been happening. \"That' was a big part of my journey: wanting to know what's happening within me.\"\n\nFor Jelly, who admitted that food was as much an addiction for him as cocaine and codeine had been during his years in and out of the prison system, he's learned that it's about setting small goals. Every time he'd decide to do everything it takes to lose weight, he'd fail, so he started with just one of those things -- and he recommends that one thing be food.\n\n\"Start there. F--k everything else,\" he said. \"Just commit yourself to 'I'm gonna count every calorie and macro that goes in my mouth.'\"\n\nHe was also clear in learning that he needed to shift his goal. He wasn't trying to lose weight, he was trying to be healthy. That's why the focus on blood panels and knowing what's going on inside. The scale only tells one part of the story.\n\nIn 2021, Jelly hired chef/sports nitritionist Ian Larios, who has worked with some MMA champions. Jelly, a huge fan of MMA, found him through this route and one of the first things he told him was that he wanted to appear on the cover of Men's Health magazines.\n\nIn December 2024, he reiterated this goal, \"to be on the cover of Men's Health in 2026. The magazine has come to mean a lot to him, he explained, because he would read it in jail and be inspired by the stories and transformations within its pages. He wanted his own journey to be told there.\n\nMen's Health followed him for a year, watching his healthy journey throughout 2025 before granting his dream with the first issue of the new year. Along with the dramatic change in his body, the magazine noted that when they returned to visit him in November, he proudly declared that his healthier body is a different man in the bedroom, too.\n\n\"Now it’s a totally different thing. I’m chasing her around the house, you know what I’m saying?,\" he laughed. \"I’m like a teenage kid again! I'm like the Pink Panther: I bust out of every corner. And she opens the cabinet and I go, 'Hi!'\"\n\n\"Dramatically different world,\" he declared. Next up is loose skin removal, which he is planning for sometime this year. The journey continues.",

    "title": "4 Habits to Break If You’re Trying to Lose Visceral Fat",
    "description": "Visceral fat is a hidden health risk, but small lifestyle changes can help reduce it.",
    "fullText": "Reviewed by Dietitian Madeline Peck, RDN, CDN\n\nVisceral fat surrounds the organs and is linked to conditions like type 2 diabetes.\n\nSugary drinks, stress, smoking and poor sleep can all drive visceral fat gain.\n\nLifestyle changes like eating a balanced diet and getting regular exercise can reduce visceral fat.\n\nVisceral fat is a term that often comes up in discussions about health and wellness, and for good reason. Unlike the fat you can pinch just under your skin (subcutaneous fat), visceral fat is the deeper fat stored around the abdominal organs. Higher levels are linked to insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, fatty liver disease and heart disease, per Raksha Shah, M.A., RDN. Visceral fat is more involved in metabolic processes due to its proximity to organs such as our liver, pancreas and intestines, which is why it is more closely associated with poor health outcomes than other kinds of fat. It is also very responsive to lifestyle changes. By understanding what to avoid, you can take effective steps toward reducing visceral fat and improving your overall well-being.\n\nSugar-sweetened  sodas are a top offender when it comes to visceral fat gain. Loaded with added sugar, these drinks provide a surge of calories but fail to help you feel full or provide any nutrients. Because regular sodas are a potent source of added sugar, they can easily lead to excessive sugar consumption. In order to manage this extra sugar, the liver turns it into fat.  Over time, this process facilitates the buildup of visceral fat around your organs. Data has linked routine consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages, like sodas and sweet tea, to higher visceral fat accumulation. Instead of drinking sugary drinks, opt for alternatives like water, unsweetened tea or sparkling water with a splash of fruit juice.\n\nStress is something everyone deals with, but unmanaged, ongoing stress can make it much harder to lose abdominal fat. “Chronic stress doesn’t just affect your mood; it can upset the hormonal balance in your body and lead to more visceral fat accumulation in various areas,” shares Toby Amidor, M.S., RD. Data shows that people with higher stress levels tend to have more visceral fat. When you’re stressed, your body releases more of the hormone cortisol, which has been directly linked to increased abdominal fat storage.\n\nTaking steps to manage stress, such as mindfulness practices, exercise or carving out time for activities you enjoy, can pay off in both your mental well-being and your physical health.\n\nPeople who smoke cigarettes tend to have lower body weights than nonsmokers. But, perhaps surprisingly, they also have more visceral fat. Data suggest that there is a link between prolonged smoking, greater nicotine dependence and increased visceral fat. This connection may be due to the way smoking affects hormones and fat distribution in the body. Nicotine can increase levels of cortisol, a stress hormone that promotes fat storage in the abdominal area. This redistribution of fat can occur even in individuals who appear lean, making smoking a hidden risk factor for visceral fat accumulation.\n\n“Sleep might not be the first thing you think of when it comes to visceral fat, but it plays a role,” says Amidor. A chronic lack of quality sleep can wreak havoc on your hormones, particularly those that regulate appetite and stress. When you are sleep-deprived, your body tends to produce more ghrelin, the “hunger hormone,” and less leptin, the hormone that signals fullness. This hormonal imbalance can lead to increased cravings that result in excess calorie intake, contributing to visceral fat.\n\nPoor sleep also elevates levels of the stress hormone cortisol. Aiming for seven to nine hours of quality sleep per night can help regulate your hormones, manage your appetite and reduce stress, creating a more favorable environment for your body to lose visceral fat. “Establishing a consistent sleep schedule and creating a relaxing bedtime routine can significantly improve your sleep quality and support your health goals,” Amidor advises.\n\nWhile avoiding certain habits is important, incorporating positive ones is just as crucial. The following are some additional strategies for shedding visceral fat and achieving healthy weight loss:\n\nPrioritize Protein: Including a good source of protein with every meal helps you feel full and satisfied, which can reduce overall calorie intake and support muscle maintenance during weight loss.\n\nFill Up on Fiber: Fiber, found in foods like oats, beans and apples, can help reduce visceral fat by slowing digestion and promoting feelings of fullness.\n\nRegular Exercise: A combination of moderate-intensity cardio (like brisk walking or cycling) and strength training may help reduce visceral fat and improve your overall metabolic health.\n\nVisceral fat may be hidden from view, but its impact on your health is anything but invisible. Because it is more metabolically active than other forms of fat, visceral adipose tissue can increase the risk of developing chronic conditions such as diabetes and heart disease. The good news? You can manage visceral fat with just a few lifestyle changes. By making mindful choices like swapping soda for sparkling water, managing stress, quitting smoking, prioritizing sleep, embracing a balanced diet and getting regular exercise, you can take meaningful steps to reduce visceral fat and improve your overall health.",

    "fullText": "Moral injury—psychological harm incurred from committing, witnessing, or being subject to actions that violate one’s moral code—has officially been recognized by the American Psychiatric Association (APA), thanks to research led by Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. The APA included “moral problem” in the newest version of its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), the handbook for classifying and diagnosing mental health conditions used by U.S. mental health care providers.\n\nIn a Sept. 16 Psychology Today article, Tyler VanderWeele, John L. Loeb and Frances Lehman Loeb Professor of Epidemiology and director of the Human Flourishing Program at Harvard (HFH), and Jennifer Wortham, a research associate at HFH, described their research on moral injury and subsequent work with the APA.\n\n“Over the past several years, [HFH has] been trying to develop a more unified approach to moral injury and to moral distress that would be applicable to perpetrators, witnesses, and victims,” they wrote. “After months of synthesis of prior work, we defined ‘moral distress’ as ‘distress that arises because personal experience disrupts or threatens: (a) one’s sense of the goodness of oneself, of others, of institutions, or of what are understood to be higher powers, or (b) one’s beliefs or intuitions about right and wrong, or good and evil.’ When that distress became sufficiently persistent it would constitute ‘moral injury.’”\n\nVanderWeele and Wortham introduced this definition, and the research behind it, in a March 4 Frontiers in Psychology study. The study sparked collaboration with the APA to ensure that moral injury was incorporated into the DSM.\n\n“Our hope is that [inclusion in the DSM] opens important opportunities for awareness and treatment of moral trauma, moral distress, and moral injury,” VanderWeele and Wortham wrote in the Psychology Today article. “If we are to truly provide person-centered care, the very real possibility of moral distress and moral injury needs to be acknowledged. The present recognition within psychiatry is a step forward in this regard.”\n\nRead the study: Moral trauma, moral distress, moral injury, and moral injury disorder: definitions and assessments\n\nRead the Psychology Today article: The Importance of Recognizing Moral Trauma in Clinical Care\n\nRead an HFH press release: DSM recognizes moral injury, thanks to Human Flourishing Program research\n\nMedia Relations Manager in the Office of Communications",

    "fullText": "Many people start the new year thinking about ways to improve their health, be more organized and manage their finances. Experts say there is one area that touches on each of those resolutions — home care.\n\nEarly and routine home maintenance goes beyond fixing visible damage. It helps ensure a healthy living environment, extends the life of a home and can protect its long-term value, according to real estate professionals. Planning ahead for regular upkeep and for unexpected emergencies can reduce the risk of costly repairs later and help spread expenses more evenly throughout the year.\n\nAccording to research by the U.S. Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency, about three-quarters of existing homes are expected to still be in use in 2050.\n\n“Maintaining the homes that we have is really essential to protecting our health and our well-being,” said Amanda Reddy, executive director of the National Center for Healthy Housing, an organization that researches and advocates for reducing housing-related health disparities.\n\nDespite who owns the property, Reddy says, keeping residences dry, clean, pest-free, well-ventilated and safe is the goal, which can mean different types of maintenance depending on the type of home, where someone lives and the time of year. Here's what experts say about home care and what tasks to put on the checklist this year:\n\nHome care includes the big projects and the everyday decisions\n\nOn average, Americans spend about 90% of their time indoors, 70% of that time inside of a residence, according to the National Human Activity Pattern Survey.\n\n“It's not just that we spend time indoors, but at home. If you are older, very young, have health concerns, or work from home, it is likely more than that,” Reddy said, emphasizing the reason why home care is a valuable investment.\n\nWhat many people think of maintenance includes addressing water and gas leaks, pest infestations, cracks and other major repairs, but home builders say not everything needs a professional and can include actions as simple as wiping counters and sweeping floors of food debris, opening windows for better ventilation or clearing out clogged filters and drains.\n\nResidents should also consider the needs of those living in the home, commonly used spaces such as kitchens, bathrooms and bedrooms, and typically neglected areas like attics and basements. Reddy says “anywhere we’re spending time” or often ignoring and possibly missing necessary repairs should be prioritized.\n\n“At the end of the day, doing any preventative maintenance at all matters more than doing it perfectly or at exactly the right time,” Reddy said. “But timing can make a big difference. A lot of these tasks are seasonal or annual, and you’re not just going to do it one time. Homes are stressed differently by different times of the year, so seasonal maintenance helps us catch problems before they’re made worse by environmental stressors.”\n\nSeasonal maintenance to plan for throughout the year\n\nWhen it comes to maintenance, planning and preparing for anticipated and routine changes in the environment can help mitigate natural wear and tear on the exterior of homes and also create healthy conditions inside — where most people shelter from extreme weather events.\n\n“What happens outside the house rarely stays outside the house. What’s outside gets inside, what’s inside builds up,\" Reddy said, adding that fluctuating outdoor conditions put stress on appliances and systems at different times of the year. “For most people, the seasonal rhythm not only makes sense because of those stressors, it also just is more realistic and effective than trying to tackle a long, overwhelming checklist all at once.\"\n\nFor example, experts say the best time to prepare for cold and wet climate, storms and other natural disasters is to address concerns before temperatures drop. Similarly, it is recommended that residents address systems in homes that work to reduce the effects of extreme high temperatures, dry and drought conditions and associated risks like wildfires and air quality in the offseason.\n\nProfessional guidance from home inspectors, builders and real estate agents says spring and summer tasks should focus on preparing for warmer weather. Experts recommend checking air conditioning systems, cleaning dryer vents to prevent fire hazards, testing sprinkler systems, tending to gardens and plants around homes' exterior and inspecting appliances, electrical equipment and plumbing fixtures. Experts also say spring is a good time to clean and do any house projects that involve painting or remodeling since rain is unlikely to cause delays during that time.\n\nIn the fall and winter months, experts suggest focusing on temperature control and air quality measures as people tend to shelter indoors during incoming colder weather. American Home Inspectors Training guidance says check heating systems, clean air filters, make sure carbon monoxide detectors are working, seal air leaks, prioritize pest control, clean and repair roofs and chimneys, and inspecting drainage options in and around homes.",

    "fullText": "An often-overlooked part of the body may reveal important clues about overall health.\n\nResearchers from the University of Westminster in the U.K. discovered that the shape of the gluteus maximus muscle in the buttocks changes with age, gender, lifestyle and frailty, as well as certain conditions like osteoporosis and type 2 diabetes.\n\nUsing advanced MRI scans that create 3D images, researchers revealed \"distinct\" patterns in the gluteus maximus associated with type 2 diabetes.\n\nHow To Avoid Getting ‘Office Chair Butt’ From Prolonged Sitting At Work\n\nThis suggested that the shape of the muscle, rather than the size, may \"reflect underlying metabolic differences,\" a press release stated.\n\nThe findings were presented in December at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) in Chicago.\n\nUnlike previous studies looking at muscle size or fat, the 3D imaging identified exactly where the muscle changes occur, according to the researchers.\n\nAs one of the largest muscles in the human body, the gluteus maximus \"plays a key role\" in metabolic health, according to lead study author E. Louise Thomas, Ph.D., professor of metabolic imaging at the University of Westminster’s School of Life Sciences.\n\nOlder Americans Are Quitting Glp-1 Weight Loss Drugs For 4 Key Reasons\n\nThe researchers analyzed more than 61,000 MRI scans from a large UK health database to better understand the muscle’s structure.\n\nThe data also included the participants’ physical measurements, demographics, disease biomarkers, medical history and lifestyle habits. The researchers studied how these variables were linked to muscle shape over time.\n\n\"People with higher fitness, as measured by vigorous physical activity and hand grip strength, had a greater gluteus maximus shape, while aging, frailty and long sitting times were linked to muscle thinning,\" study co-author Marjola Thanaj, Ph.D., a senior research fellow at the University of Westminster’s Research Centre for Optimal Health, said in the release.\n\n5 Fitness Trends That Went Viral In 2025 – Experts Weigh Hype Vs Results\n\nThe researchers concluded that butt shape changes may indicate an \"early functional decline\" and \"metabolic compromise\" in type 2 diabetes patients.\n\nClick Here For More Health Stories\n\nMen with type 2 diabetes showed muscle shrinkage, while women displayed enlarged muscle, likely due to \"infiltration of fat\" within it, according to the researchers.\n\nThese results suggest that men and women have \"very different biological responses to the same disease,\" Thanaj suggested.\n\nMen who were categorized as \"frail\" were recognized as having more \"general shrinkage\" across the gluteus maximus, but women experienced a \"limited\" frailty effect.\n\nStrengthening the glutes is an \"investment in long-term health,\" according to Tanya Becker, co-founder of Physique 57 in New York City.\n\n\"While full-body strength training is essential, focusing on your glutes — the largest muscle group in your body — deserves special attention,\" she told Fox News Digital.\n\nBecker refers to the glutes as the body’s \"shock absorbers,\" because they protect the lower back, knees and hips from taking on stress they weren’t designed to handle.\n\nLarger muscle groups also burn more calories and help regulate blood sugar, the expert added, noting that muscles are often referred to as the \"organ of longevity.\"\n\nStrengthening the glutes also helps to protect the lower back, hips and knees, and also improves posture and balance, reducing the risk of falls and improving mobility.\n\nBecker recommends traditional weighted exercises like squats, lunges and bridges, although they are not suited for everyone, especially older adults with injuries and joint pain.\n\n\"Pilates and barre classes offer bodyweight exercises that are ideal for beginners or individuals with physical limitations,\" she suggested. \"They can be done anytime, anywhere, making them accessible for beginners before progressing to weighted versions.\"\n\nBecker shared the following three glute exercises that improve hip mobility, stability and overall strength.\n\nStart on the hands and knees, engage your core, and lift one leg off the floor (bent or straight). Pulse up and down a few inches for 30 to 60 seconds, then repeat on the other leg.\n\nLie on your side with knees bent at 90 degrees in front of you. Lift your top knee away from your bottom knee, then lower slowly.\n\nFor an increased challenge, lift both feet off the ground while keeping the heels together. Repeat for 30 to 60 seconds per side.\n\nLie on your back with knees bent and feet parallel, a few inches from your hips. Engage your abs, and squeeze your glutes to lift your hips toward knee height, then lower.\n\nIf you feel pressure in your neck, you’ve lifted too high. Perform for 30 to 60 seconds. Complete three sets with 30-second rests between them.\n\nTest Yourself With Our Latest Lifestyle Quiz\n\nThose looking to start a new fitness routine should first consult with a doctor.\n\nFox News Digital reached out to the study authors for comment.\n\nOriginal article",

    "description": "With a playoff berth already guaranteed, the Buffalo Bills are playing for health and seeding this weekend.",
    "fullText": "The Buffalo Bills are headed to the playoffs, extending their franchise-record streak to seven consecutive seasons. The New York Jets, on the other hand, are going to miss the playoffs for the 15th straight season. I won’t kick them while they’re down — we know better than any fan base what it feels like to miss the playoffs for an absurd amount of years — but it’s wild to think that the Jets have been as bad as they’ve been for as long as they have been.\n\nSunday’s game not only brings the regular season to a close, but it also brings Highmark Stadium’s tenure as home of the Buffalo Bills to an end, as well. Barring something strange where the Bills host the AFC Championship Game, Sunday’s contest will be the final game played in the stadium before the Bills open their brand new facility in September. Fittingly, it’s the Jets coming in on Sunday to close the stadium, as the Jets were also the first opponent for a regular-season game in the stadium way back in 1973.\n\nThat game was a real barn-burner, as the Bills beat the Jets by a final score of 9-7. John Leypoldt hit three field goals, O.J. Simpson rushed for 124 yards, and the Buffalo defense withstood an Al Woodall 36-yard touchdown pass to Jerome Barkum in the fourth quarter to hold on for a win. While we’d hope the game on Sunday will feature more excitement than the first meeting in this building between these two teams, it’s possible that the game takes on the form of a preseason game given its lack of meaning in the standings for both clubs.\n\nBuffalo cannot win the AFC East, so they’ll either be the five, six, or seven seed depending on Sunday’s slate of results. The Jets, meanwhile, win by losing, as they can clinch the No. 2 overall pick with a loss and a New York Giants win. They could also drop out of the top three choices with a win and losses from some other eliminated franchises.\n\nHow do we pick players to watch for a game where we’re not even sure who’s going to play? Well, we make it up as we go along. Our five Bills to watch this week are below, but feel free to share yours in the comments.\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\nYes, I heard head coach Sean McDermott when he said that this week would be “business as usual” with the starters. I also heard when he said that quarterback Josh Allen is “in a better place” with his foot injury this week than he was last week. I’ve also seen Allen log “DNPs” at practice on both Wednesday and Thursday, and then a limited session on Friday. Allen is going to start the game. He might even play a drive or two as the team tries to ensure that he scores 40 total touchdowns for a record sixth consecutive season.\n\nIt’s going to be Trubisky time at some point in the afternoon, though, so I’m watching mostly to see how quickly the clock strikes “Mitch” in this game. Individual statistics are fun, but healthy players in the playoffs are much more important. Playing Trubisky for the majority of this game is the right thing to do.\n\nSpeaking of guys who will likely play a bunch on Sunday, Buffalo’s kickoff returner extraordinaire is likely in line for plenty of carries on Sunday. Davis has just 37 rushing attempts this season, and he hasn’t had more than nine carries in a game. He’s hit that threshold three times, with the first of those times coming against these Jets in September. Davis ran nine times for 24 yards against the Jets in the first meeting.\n\nI expect that he’ll have right around that carry figure, if not more, with more yards gained and greater efficiency this time around. Would it be great for James Cook III to win the rushing title? Absolutely. Is it worth risking him turning an ankle heading into the playoffs? It absolutely is not. Davis should see the lion’s share of the snaps on Sunday.\n\nEff it. If Coleman is going to log a snap-count number greater than his jersey number at any point, this weekend is the time to do it. If I’m the Bills, I make Coleman active and force-feed him targets all day. What do they have to lose? At best, Coleman looks great, it gives him and the team confidence that he can help this postseason, and it spurs him onward to a great run in January and February.\n\nMaybe Coleman looks good enough where the team can point to this performance during the offseason as a reason for another club to trade for Coleman, just as they can point to another Class of 2024 wideout — Adonai Mitchell — across the field on Sunday as an example of the power of a change of scenery. At worst, Coleman plays and looks like a total non-factor in a game that ultimately means nothing, and the Bills have all the data they need to give up on their 2024 second-round choice.\n\nThe reward of playing Coleman in this game outweighs the risk, in my eyes. I’d let him roll and see what the kid can do.\n\nAnother deep cut! Center Conor McGovern has been dealing with injuries all season long, and he’s gutted through them admirably. At some point on Sunday, I’d love to see the Bills give McGovern a break and go to their second-year man. This serves two purposes: for starters, it gives McGovern some rest. Secondarily, it gives Van Pran-Granger some in-game experience heading into an offseason where McGovern, starting left guard David Edwards, and top interior reserve Alec Anderson are all free agents.\n\nDo the Bills think SVPG has what it takes to step into the starting lineup next season? Or will they need to commit big resources to keeping the band together up front? And, if so, which linemen do they retain? There are some big offseason questions to answer along the offensive line, but for now, resting McGovern would be a good move.\n\nMany of us have been clamoring for the rookie to see the field more this season. Well, kid, Sunday should be the day it happens. Jordan Poyer is already hurt and out for Sunday, so we’ll probably see more Darnell Savage this week. Cam Lewis started in Poyer’s place last week, but given his tremendous role on special teams and in dime packages, the team will likely limit his snaps, as well. Cole Bishop is entrenched as a starter, but it wouldn’t be the worst idea to let him play a little less this week.\n\nDo the Bills want to use Hancock as a safety? Or, will they slot him in — pun intended — for nickel corner Taron Johnson? Playing Hancock more this week would be a good move, as it would give the rookie some much-needed in-game experience while also resting some key veterans.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump’s habit of bragging about acing multiple cognitive tests may have accidentally confirmed everyone’s worst fears about the state of his health.\n\nAppearing on MS NOW, Dr. Vin Gupta discussed the president’s latest boast, the 79-year-old gloating yet again about scoring “100%” on a third cognitive examination in a Friday Truth Social post.\n\n“The White House Doctors have just reported that I am in ‘PERFECT HEALTH,’ and that I ‘ACED’ (Meaning, was correct on 100% of the questions asked!), for the third straight time, my Cognitive Examination, something which no other President, or previous Vice President, was willing to take,” the president wrote.\n\n“This is not the flex he thinks it is,” Gupta, medical analyst for NBC News and former chief medical officer at Amazon Pharmacy, said. “You don’t do this every other day and use that as evidence that you’re cognitively there.”\n\n“Those that tend to do Montreal [Cognitive Assessment Tool, or MOCA] tests with that level of frequency, usually we’re worried about the presence of early-stage dementia or cognitive impairment, so he might be ruling himself in to something that he doesn’t want to rule himself into.”\n\nThe president has faced increasing speculation surrounding his cognitive health during his second term, with multiple medical experts and Trump’s own niece suggesting that his decline is readily apparent.\n\nPsychologist Dr. John Gartner has previously told The Daily Beast Podcast that undertaking the same cognitive assessment multiple times suggests that his doctors are not assessing dementia, but monitoring it.\n\n“You could maybe justify giving someone the MoCA once, just on their age, just as part of a physical. If you’re giving it to him three times, that means you’re not assessing dementia. That means you’re monitoring dementia,” Gartner said.\n\nGartner has previously pointed to the president’s increasingly erratic behavior as evidence of his cognitive decline.\n\n“When people develop dementia, they become the worst versions of themselves,” he told the Daily Beast’s Joanna Coles in November.\n\n“Whatever personality issues or problems [people with dementia] have begin to deteriorate and they become even more crude, disorganized, aggressive, confused versions of that personality disorder,” Gartner added.\n\nCaginess from the White House has only exacerbated speculation about the president’s health, with Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt repeatedly declining to provide journalists or the American public with details of the president’s medical assessments.\n\nAfter the president himself blurted out in October that he had undergone an MRI during a physical examination, the White House initially declined to explain why. Eventually, in December, they claimed that it was a “preventative” measure due to his age—a claim medical experts immediately began to question.\n\n“There really is no preventative cardiac MRI,” Dr. Jonathan Reiner told CNN in December. “This is not a standard test for an 80-year-old man to undergo advanced imaging.”\n\nTrump has also regularly been seen with bruises on his hand—something the White House has blamed on frequent handshakes plus a daily aspirin regimen—and swollen ankles, likely the result of his chronic venous insufficiency diagnosis, both of which have added to concerns about his fitness for office, as has his seeming tendency to take naps during official meetings.\n\nIn January 2025, Trump—who regularly questioned his predecessor Joe Biden’s fitness for office—became the oldest president to take the oath of office.\n\nIn December, he posted a lengthy rant to Truth Social in which he argued that it was “seditious, perhaps even treasonous” to discuss his health.\n\n“After all of the work I have done with Medical Exams, Cognitive Exams, and everything else, I actually believe it’s seditious, perhaps even treasonous, for The New York Times, and others, to consistently do FAKE reports in order to libel and demean ‘THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES,’” he wrote in response to a wave of fresh concern about his seemingly declining health.",

I didn't deserve it. I literally didn't do it out of fear.” The musician ultimately worked with a therapist to help treat his “addiction” to food. “Even before I got into getting my blood work done, I went and got mental health therapy about my overeating. I started treating my food addiction like what it was: an addiction. Why did I treat cocaine a certain way? I went to meetings for cocaine and found a sponsor and detoxed off of it and s*** myself and went through real hard life-changing emotional choices to get off cocaine and codeine,\" Jelly Roll shared. \"I didn’t look at the food addiction different. Once I started treating food like an addiction, it started changing everything for me.\" Jelly Roll’s Weight Loss Transformation Through the Years: See Photos Jelly Roll eventually went from 540 pounds down to 265 pounds. “I feel like I'm a teenager, dog,” he joked. “I have the sex drive of a 17-year-old again. I'm f***ing pouncing on my wife. We're having daytime sex again. It's f***ing awesome.” FilmMagic; Getty Images He continued: \"[Before the weight loss] my testosterone level — and I’m cool to talk about this openly — was of a preteen boy. When I went in there for the test, it was bad. Bad. The world opened up when I [saw] it on paper. I was like, 'That’s my testosterone level?' I mean, dude, we’re talking a 57.You can’t get it up without T. I was married to a smoke show, and I was still struggling.The first couple of blood panels were like, 'How are you alive?'\" Jelly Roll, who has been married to Bunnie XO since 2016, called struggling with his weight a \"never-ending sadness.\" \"And anger. I was a prisoner to my own body. Dude, wiping my ass was a problem. Washing myself properly was a problem. Getting in cars. Every decision I made in life had to be based on my weight,\" he recalled. \"If it could hold me, facilitate me, or fit me — people don’t think about every facet of ‘I still want to be able to do that and I can’t.’ I was so inspired by that kind of stuff.” Men's Health Jelly Roll broke down how his size impacted every aspect of his life, saying, “I was so fat that there came a moment in life that my wife and I had to put two queen beds beside each other because we couldn't fit in a king bed anymore, I was just all over. It's almost to the point where I look back now and I can't believe that I was able to perform, that I was on national television, and that I was on stages and doing 100-something shows a year.\" He continued: \"I was killing myself, literally. I mean, I was eating myself to absolute death. I can't talk about one area of my life it was not affecting. It's as disgusting as you imagine, when I really look back at it. I was struggling to wipe my ass. You know what I mean? Like, I'm ashamed of it. When I think of it being disgusting, I feel shame again. And shame is the exact same thing that will send me right back into the pantry. It's the same thing that sends an alcoholic right back to the bar.” After dropping nearly 300 pounds, Jelly Roll is remaining committed to his wellness journey. Celebrities’ Weight Loss and Transformations: Before and After Pictures “I don't have a goal weight, I have a feeling weight, and I don't feel it yet. I'll know when I feel it, because I'll finally be there. But, man, I've worked really hard and lost the weight the right way,\" he shared. “I feel the weight loss in every facet. Whether it's basketball and how I dribble or move, or how I can breathe running up and down a court. I feel it when I sleep and my hip hurts less and I can roll over easier without making a big of a rumble. Or the fact that me and my wife can fit on the same bed again.” The musician admitted his weight loss has also “dramatically\" changed his marriage. “Now it’s a totally different thing. I’m chasing her around the house,\" he noted. “I’m like a teenage kid again! I’m like the Pink Panther — I bust out of every corner. And she opens the cabinet and I go, ‘Hi!’” There have been some more unexpected side effects, however. “There's so much skin under here. I'm starting to meet with skin surgeons to talk about possibly cutting skin in the next year,” Jelly Roll said. “That's probably what I have the weirdest relationship with. It's like, I'm proud of it because I earned it.\" He concluded: \"It's a symbol of a war that I fought with myself. But equally, it is in the f****ing way. So it's just, you keep looking in the mirror, like, If that wasn't there, dude, I'd be fire. So, [I’ll] probably have to clip these titties off eventually.”",

    "fullText": "The start of a new year is a classic time for a quiet reckoning with our health.\n\nIn fact, last January, I decided to finally look at my macros — how much protein, fiber, carbs, and other nutrients I was actually eating. I've always tried to eat \"healthy,\" but I was nervous about tracking anything too closely.\n\nI came of age during the clean-eating era, of salads, raw vegetables, and the demonization of carbs. In college, that slid into disordered eating: severe under-eating as a way to avoid \"danger\" foods.\n\nIn my 20s, I thought I'd trained myself out of it, but in retrospect, I mostly swapped one rigid habit for another, following wellness trends of the 2010s. I ordered big salads with low-calorie counts, bulked up with quinoa and some chicken, but not much else. I drank \"detox\" green juices. I spent money on goji berries instead of loaves of bread.\n\nThe result? Serious stomach problems. It took real effort to unlearn that mindset and trust a more intuitive approach to food — ultimately resolving the bloating and discomfort.\n\nNow, in my mid-30s, as I start a family, my question looks different. I'm not trying to shrink my body or follow strict rules. I want to be more deliberate about giving my body what it needs to function well — enough protein to stay strong, enough fiber to feel good, and enough fuel to get through long days — rather than assuming I'm \"probably fine\" and accidentally skimping on something essential.\n\nThis year, Business Insider's health team wants to zoom in on that tension — between caring about your health and feeling overwhelmed by advice — that so often surfaces in January.\n\nWe want to hear the questions you're carrying into the new year. Not vague resolutions, but real, specific questions about your health that you want clear, tailored answers to.\n\nWe're collecting questions about the topics that feel most top-of-mind right now:\n\nTell us what you're curious about, confused by, or stuck on. We'll take your questions directly to doctors, researchers, and trainers — and share their answers in a coming advice series on Business Insider.\n\nWe may reach out for follow-up, but we won't publish any part of your response without your permission.

    "description": "President Donald Trump, 79, fired off an early-morning tirade Friday insisting he is in “PERFECT HEALTH” as concerns grow over his apparent mental and physical decline. “The White House Doctors have just reported that I am in ‘PERFECT HEALTH,’ and that I ‘ACED’ (Meaning, was correct on 100% of the questions asked!), for the third straight time, my Cognitive Examination, something which no other President, or previous Vice President, was willing to take,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “P.S.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump, 79, fired off an early-morning tirade Friday insisting he is in “PERFECT HEALTH” as concerns grow over his apparent mental and physical decline.\n\n“The White House Doctors have just reported that I am in ‘PERFECT HEALTH,’ and that I ‘ACED’ (Meaning, was correct on 100% of the questions asked!), for the third straight time, my Cognitive Examination, something which no other President, or previous Vice President, was willing to take,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n\n“P.S., I strongly believe that anyone running for President, or Vice President, should be mandatorily forced to take a strong, meaningful, and proven Cognitive Examination. Our great Country cannot be run by ‘STUPID’ or INCOMPETENT PEOPLE!”\n\nTrump has routinely brushed aside suggestions he is in mental decline by boasting about passing the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, a test used to detect cognitive impairment or early signs of dementia. The test involves tasks such as drawing a clock to show a specific time and identifying animals.\n\nDuring a December 2025 speech in North Carolina, Trump also proudly told the crowd how he “aced” such a test.\n\n“The first question is like, ‘What is this?’ And they show a lion, a giraffe, a fish, and a hippopotamus. And they say, ‘Which is the giraffe?’” Trump said.\n\n“I don’t think Joe [Biden] would have gotten the first question right,” he added. “He would say hippo. ‘I want the hippo,’”\n\nThe Daily Beast has been leading the way in reporting on concerns about the president’s health, including frequently documenting how Trump covers large bruises on his hands with makeup and tries to conceal his swollen cankles whenever possible.\n\nIn a remarkably candid interview with The Wall Street Journal published Jan. 1, Trump—the oldest sitting president in U.S. history—was forced to address his health issues and, in doing so, he contradicted previous assurances given to the public.\n\nHe revealed that his second medical exam last year at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center involved a CT scan, not an MRI as previously disclosed. Navy Capt. Sean Barbabella, Trump’s physician who conducted the exam, told the Journal that the CT scan was performed to “definitively rule out any cardiovascular issues.”\n\nThe White House confirmed in July 2025 that Trump had been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, a condition that causes swelling in the lower legs.\n\nTrump told the Journal that he briefly wore compression socks to help with his cankles but stopped because he did not like them. The president also made the startling admission that he takes more aspirin than his doctors recommend for “cardiac prevention.”\n\n“They say aspirin is good for thinning out the blood, and I don’t want thick blood pouring through my heart,” Trump said. “I want nice, thin blood pouring through my heart. Does that make sense?”\n\nTrump blamed the frequent bruising on his hands—which he desperately attempts to conceal with concealer—on his heavy daily aspirin use.\n\nFor months, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt has offered a boilerplate response when the Daily Beast asked about the bruises, insisting they are the result of the president “meeting more Americans and shaking their hands on a daily basis than any other president in history.”\n\nTrump also admitted he is so fragile that his hand bled after Attorney General Pam Bondi nicked him with her ring during a high five at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee in July 2024.\n\n“The ring hit the back of my hand, and, yes, there was a slight little cut,” Trump told the Journal of the incident, which reportedly caused alarm among members of his inner circle.\n\nTrump said he applies makeup to his hands whenever he gets “whacked again.”\n\n“I have makeup that’s, you know, easy to put on. Takes about 10 seconds,” he said.",

    "fullText": "Exclusive: Inaccurate information presented in summaries, Guardian investigation finds\n\nPeople are being put at risk of harm by false and misleading health information in Google’s artificial intelligence summaries, a Guardian investigation has found.\n\nThe company has said its AI Overviews, which use generative AI to provide snapshots of essential information about a topic or question, are “helpful” and “reliable”.\n\nBut some of the summaries, which appear at the top of search results, served up inaccurate health information and put people at risk of harm.\n\nIn one case that experts described as “really dangerous”, Google wrongly advised people with pancreatic cancer to avoid high-fat foods. Experts said this was the exact opposite of what should be recommended, and may increase the risk of patients dying from the disease.\n\nIn another “alarming” example, the company provided bogus information about crucial liver function tests, which could leave people with serious liver disease wrongly thinking they are healthy.\n\nGoogle searches for answers about women’s cancer tests also provided “completely wrong” information, which experts said could result in people dismissing genuine symptoms.\n\nA Google spokesperson said that many of the health examples shared with them were “incomplete screenshots”, but from what they could assess they linked “to well-known, reputable sources and recommend seeking out expert advice”.\n\nThe Guardian investigation comes amid growing concern that AI data can confuse consumers who may assume that it is reliable. In November last year, a study found AI chatbots across a range of platforms gave inaccurate financial advice, while similar concerns have been raised about summaries of news stories.\n\nSophie Randall, director of the Patient Information Forum, which promotes evidence-based health information to patients, the public and healthcare professionals, said the examples showed “Google’s AI Overviews can put inaccurate health information at the top of online searches, presenting a risk to people’s health”.\n\nStephanie Parker, the director of digital at Marie Curie, an end-of-life charity, said: “People turn to the internet in moments of worry and crisis. If the information they receive is inaccurate or out of context, it can seriously harm their health.”\n\nThe Guardian uncovered several cases of inaccurate health information in Google’s AI Overviews after a number of health groups, charities and professionals raised concerns.\n\nAnna Jewell, the director of support, research and influencing at Pancreatic Cancer UK, said advising patients to avoid high-fat foods was “completely incorrect”. Doing so “could be really dangerous and jeopardise a person’s chances of being well enough to have treatment”, she added.\n\nJewell said: “The Google AI response suggests that people with pancreatic cancer avoid high-fat foods and provides a list of examples. However, if someone followed what the search result told them then they might not take in enough calories, struggle to put on weight, and be unable to tolerate either chemotherapy or potentially life-saving surgery.”\n\nTyping “what is the normal range for liver blood tests” also served up misleading information, with masses of numbers, little context and no accounting for nationality, sex, ethnicity or age of patients.\n\nPamela Healy, the chief executive of the British Liver Trust, said the AI summaries were alarming. “Many people with liver disease show no symptoms until the late stages, which is why it’s so important that they get tested. But what the Google AI Overviews say is ‘normal’ can vary drastically from what is actually considered normal.\n\n“It’s dangerous because it means some people with serious liver disease may think they have a normal result then not bother to attend a follow-up healthcare meeting.”\n\nA search for “vaginal cancer symptoms and tests” listed a pap test as a test for vaginal cancer, which is incorrect.\n\nAthena Lamnisos, the chief executive of the Eve Appeal cancer charity, said: “It isn’t a test to detect cancer, and certainly isn’t a test to detect vaginal cancer – this is completely wrong information. Getting wrong information like this could potentially lead to someone not getting vaginal cancer symptoms checked because they had a clear result at a recent cervical screening.\n\n“We were also worried by the fact that the AI summary changed when we did the exact same search, coming up with a different response each time that pulled from different sources. That means that people are getting a different answer depending on when they search, and that’s not good enough.”\n\nLamnisos said she was extremely concerned. “Some of the results we’ve seen are really worrying and can potentially put women in danger,” she said.\n\nThe Guardian also found Google AI Overviews delivered misleading results for searches about mental health conditions. “This is a huge concern for us as a charity,” said Stephen Buckley, the head of information at Mind.\n\nSome of the AI summaries for conditions such as psychosis and eating disorders offered “very dangerous advice” and were “incorrect, harmful or could lead people to avoid seeking help”, Buckley said.\n\nSome also missed out important context or nuance, he added. “They may suggest accessing information from sites that are inappropriate … and we know that when AI summarises information, it can often reflect existing biases, stereotypes or stigmatising narratives.”\n\nGoogle said the vast majority of its AI Overviews were factual and helpful, and it continuously made quality improvements. The accuracy rate of AI Overviews was on a par with its other search features like featured snippets, which had existed for more than a decade, it added.\n\nThe company also said that when AI Overviews misinterpreted web content or missed context, it would take action as appropriate under its policies.\n\nA Google spokesperson said: “We invest significantly in the quality of AI Overviews, particularly for topics like health, and the vast majority provide accurate information.”",

    "description": "Returning to the Colts didn't just mean another hefty paycheck for Philip Rivers. It meant access to a strong health plan for another five years.",
    "fullText": "Philip Rivers caused quite a stir when he returned to the NFL in December 2025 as a 44-year-old grandpa.\n\nThe Indianapolis Colts, plagued by injuries and with limited options, called up their former quarterback to try to salvage a season that started red-hot. Rivers spent the majority of his NFL career with the San Diego/Los Angeles Chargers, but signed with the Colts in 2020 and played one full season before retiring after a playoff loss in January 2021.\n\nAnother clock reset as soon as he was added to the Colts' active roster: Rivers extended his NFL-sponsored health insurance, which was set to expire in 2026, by another five years.\n\nThis benefit emerged from the 2006 NFL-NFLPA agreement, which stipulates that players who are on any NFL roster for three or more seasons are entitled to five years of health insurance after retirement.\n\nIt's particularly advantageous to Rivers, a father of 10. Each of his kids is under the age of 26, making them each eligible as dependents. His wife, Tiffany, is also eligible.\n\nAs for the actual medical plan, here are some highlights of his benefits, as outlined in The NFL Player Insurance Plan published in 2020.\n\nHealth insurance plans vary tremendously from company to company, and also from plan to plan within the same company. I decided to see how the NFL plan stacks up to the High-Deductible Health Plan (HDHP) I'm enrolled in. Compare it to yours if you're curious.\n\nAnnual deductible. This is the amount you pay each year before insurance starts covering most costs.\n\nNFL plan: $850 per person / $1,700 per family\n\nMy HDHP: $3,000 per person / $6,000 per family\n\nWhile an NFL player only has to spend $850 on covered care before insurance kicks in, I'd have to spend $3,000 out-of-pocket before coverage begins. Note that my plan literally has \"high deductible\" in its name, but the tradeoffs for high upfront costs include a lower premium and access to a tax-advantaged savings account called an HSA.\n\nOut-of-pocket maximum. This is the most you have to pay in a year for covered health care, after which the insurance plan pays 100% of covered costs for the rest of that plan year.\n\nNFL plan: $2,000 per person / $5,000 per family\n\nMy HDHP: $6,000 per person / $12,000 per family\n\nWith a cap of $2,000 per person, an NFL player's worst-case medical year is fairly limited, whereas I'd be on the hook for $6,000. Of course, I'm taking fewer hits working behind a desk rather than behind an offensive line.\n\nPremium. This is the fixed amount you pay regularly — usually every month — to keep your health insurance active.\n\nNFL plan: $0/month. According to the 2020 NFL Player Insurance Plan, \"The Clubs fund the NFL Player Trust that pays for the benefits provided and insurance premiums owed under the Plan.\"\n\nMy HDHP: I also pay $0. Again, the tradeoff is the higher deductible.\n\nFor Rivers, returning to the Colts didn't just mean another hefty paycheck; it meant access to a strong health plan with low deductibles, capped out-of-pocket costs, and broad medical coverage.\n\nThe Colts are officially out of the playoffs, and he'll be sitting out during Week 18. If he retires for good this year, he and his family don't have to worry about shopping around for insurance until 2031.",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump has publicly humiliated his spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt by contradicting her repeated reassurances and excuses about his health woes.\n\nSince Trump, 79, returned to office last January, speculation has raged over bruising on his hands and about his cognitive ability, particularly after he underwent a mystery scan in the fall—with the Daily Beast leading the way on reporting the president’s various medical issues, including his swollen cankles.\n\nLeavitt, 28, has repeatedly claimed the reason for the discoloration on the back of his right hand—which the president has covered up with band-aids, bandages, and thick make-up—is that as “a man of the people,” Trump “meets more Americans and shakes their hands on a daily basis than any other president in history.”\n\nWhile Leavitt has also attributed the bruising to the president’s routine aspirin use, she has often led her responses to questions about Trump’s hands by blaming his handshaking, including when questioned on the matter earlier this month by the Beast’s political correspondent Farrah Tomazin.\n\n“The president is literally constantly shaking hands, the Oval Office is like Grand Central Terminal,” she explained earlier this month.\n\nDays after the bruising appeared to spread to Trump’s left hand—which he does not use to greet people—the president on Thursday gave a revelatory interview about his health to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nTrump offered a different reason for the bruising: overuse of aspirin and his thinning skin.\n\nHe told the Journal that he takes 325 milligrams of aspirin a day—four times the 81-milligram “low dose” commonly used in daily therapy, per the Mayo Clinic—despite conceding his doctors have urged him to take less.\n\nThis higher-than-recommended aspirin use, Trump said, has become a central factor in the bruising that’s been spotted on his hands. But he told the outlet he refuses to reduce the dose because he’s been on the same routine for decades, and is “a little superstitious.”\n\nTrump also said he wears makeup because he has soft skin, and it bruises when it gets “whacked.”\n\nDiscussing an episode in which Attorney General Pam Bondi, 60, nicked him during a high-five, he told the Journal: “The ring hit the back of my hand, and, yes, there was a slight little cut.”\n\nHe added that he puts makeup on his hands after he gets “whacked again by someone,” saying: “I have makeup that’s, you know, easy to put on, takes about 10 seconds.”\n\nTrump also gave more details about his October scan, further embarrassing Leavitt, who has fended off repeated inquiries about it from the White House podium.\n\nShe at first repeatedly answered questions without naming the test and leaning on scripted assurances about his condition. On October 23, she declined to specify what test he received. On November 4, pressed on why Trump had a week earlier described it as an MRI, she said she would “check back,” while insisting he was in “optimal physical health” and framing the Walter Reed visit as a routine follow-up.\n\nWhen asked again on November 12, Leavitt leaned on the language of the doctor’s memo, reiterating that Trump received “advanced imaging” as part of a routine exam and that physicians considered him in “exceptional” condition, without explaining why the imaging was ordered.\n\nLeavitt’s position remained the same until December 1, when Trump’s physician, Navy Capt. Sean Barbabella, released a memo describing cardiovascular imaging. Leavitt told reporters the screening was normal and positioned the disclosure as transparency.\n\nEven then, the White House’s preferred shorthand remained “advanced imaging,” rather than a clear, consistent label for what Trump had undergone.\n\nIn the Journal interview, Trump said he’d been telling people it was an MRI, but then corrected it: “It wasn’t an MRI… It was less than that. It was a scan.” He complained that getting the test had handed critics “ammunition” because it fueled questions about whether something was wrong.\n\nThe Journal reported that Trump and Barbabella ultimately characterized the procedure as a CT scan performed to rule out cardiovascular issues, with no abnormalities found.\n\nLeavitt is quoted in the Journal saying the White House had “often referred to the procedure as ‘advanced imaging,’” while not addressing why Trump didn’t correct the MRI/CT description sooner.\n\nIn the Journal article, Trump also discussed his ‘cankles’ and why he apparently cannot stay awake during public meetings.\n\nThe Daily Beast has contacted the White House and Leavitt for comment.",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump may now be having trouble walking across flat surfaces.\n\nThe president appeared to be hiding a slight limp as he was filmed walking with his wife, Melania, at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nThe new speculation over the 79-year-old’s health came after he revealed in an interview that he tried compression socks for his swollen ankles and used makeup to cover the bruising on his hands caused by large daily doses of aspirin.\n\nThe popular anti-Trump X account Call to Activism posted a clip of Trump appearing to drag his right leg as he walked down a runway toward the press gathered to snap attendees of his ritzy New Year’s Eve party.\n\nThe account, which has over 1.1 million followers, wrote, ″Trump just showed up at Mar-a-Lago to celebrate New Year’s, dragging his right leg, and quickly adjusted his walk when he realizes the cameras are on. What’s Trump hiding?\"\n\nIn the clip, Trump can be seen slightly limping as he enters the frame, but after a few steps, he adopts a steadier gait before he and First Lady Melania Trump stop to pose for photographs.\n\nViewers were split on whether the clip showed a new medical malady for the oldest president in American history or if it was no big deal.\n\n“It pretty obvious [sic] he is dragging his right leg. If Biden had done that every news station would have this video up all day all time about his health,” wrote one suspicious viewer on X.\n\n“Honestly? Probably nothing,” said a less-convinced X user. “He knows the cameras are always watching, so of course he adjusted. Not every awkward step means there’s something being hidden.”\n\nOn Monday, the nearly octogenarian president had difficulty descending four small steps at Mar-a-Lago. On multiple occasions, he has descended the steps on Air Force One at a snail’s pace.\n\nHe has also been filmed struggling to walk in straight lines and dragging his right leg in public for years.\n\nWednesday’s Mar-a-Lago entrance comes amidst intensified speculation about Trump’s health issues, which the Daily Beast has led the charge in covering.\n\nThese include persistent bruising on his hands, difficulty sleeping through the night and staying awake during the day, and chronic venous insufficiency, which has caused his ankles to swell.\n\nOn Thursday, the Wall Street Journal reported that Trump personally called the publication to complain about the persistent coverage of his health and attempted to set the record straight on some health mysteries that have dogged his second term.\n\nTrump told the publication that he takes quadruple the common dose of aspirin for “cardiac prevention,” and that is what causes the bruising on his hands.\n\nThe piece did not address speculation about Trump’s ambling gait. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the president’s Mar-a-Lago entrance.\n\nWhen the Daily Beast reported on Trump taking a circuitous route between Marine One and Air Force One in September, White House Communications Director Steven Cheung told the publication, “You must be f-----g blind or stupid, because that was a perfect walk.”",

In December, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services released proposals that would block gender-affirming care to minors, including a policy that would bar Medicare and Medicaid dollars to hospitals that provide such care to children.\n\nSenior Trump officials, such as Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., call gender-affirming care “malpractice” for minors. But such restrictions go against recommendations from major medical groups such as the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics.",

    "title": "My Health Resolutions for 2026 Have Nothing to Do With Weight Loss",
    "description": "Resolving to simply \"get smaller\" is a recipe for failure.",
    "fullText": "Skinny is officially back in—not that it ever really left, if you ask me. Between \"what I eat in a day\" videos and before-and-after transformations, there's always been this undercurrent of weight loss anxiety masquerading as wellness. \"Weight loss\" is assumed to be synonymous with \"healthy,\" but that's never been the whole story. And during this time for reflection and goal-setting, I urge you to think bigger than simply making yourself smaller.\n\nIf you've struggled to identify health goals beyond weight loss, you're not alone. We've been conditioned to believe that smaller bodies are the ultimate achievement, when in reality, health is so much more expansive, personal, and interesting than that. Here are the resolutions I'm making for 2026—and how to reframe your own goals around what truly matters.\n\nThe weight-loss version: I need to burn calories. Exercise is punishment for eating. Even if I hate working out, I have to do it anyway because discipline.\n\nThe reframe: What if movement was about feeling capable in your body? About the rush of endorphins after a dance class, the meditative quality of a morning walk, or the satisfaction of getting stronger over time?\n\nMy resolution: Find three types of movement I genuinely enjoy and do them regularly—not because I \"should,\" but because they make me feel alive. Maybe that's swimming, hiking with friends, or finally trying that aerial yoga class. The goal isn't to torch calories; it's to build a relationship with movement that's based on joy rather than obligation.\n\nHow to measure success: Can I do things I couldn't do before? Do I feel energized rather than depleted? Am I actually looking forward to moving my body? These are the metrics that matter.\n\nThe weight-loss version: Good foods versus bad foods. Restriction as virtue. Guilt when you inevitably \"fall off the wagon.\"\n\nThe reframe: Food is information for your body. Am I making choices based on the moral value of different foods, or am I actually listening to what my body wants and needs?\n\nMy resolution: Notice how different foods actually make me feel, without judgment. Keep a simple log—not of calories, but maybe of energy levels, mood, digestion, and satisfaction. Do I feel better when I include more vegetables, not because they're \"virtuous,\" but because they genuinely help me feel my best?\n\nHow to measure success: Am I making food choices based on how I want to feel rather than what the scale might say? Do I have stable energy throughout the day? Can I eat without guilt?\n\nThe weight-loss version: Water fills you up so you eat less; it's a diet hack.\n\nThe reframe: Proper hydration affects everything from your cognitive function and mood to your digestion, skin health, and energy levels. You deserve to drink water because your body literally needs it to survive and thrive.\n\nMy resolution: Drink enough water that I'm not constantly tired, headache-prone, or confusing thirst for hunger. Keep a bottle with me and actually notice the difference in how I feel when I'm properly hydrated versus when I'm running on empty.\n\nHow to measure success: Are my headaches less frequent? Is my brain fog lifting by mid-afternoon? Do I have more energy?\n\nThe weight-loss version: I'll like myself when I'm smaller. Confidence is contingent on appearance.\n\nThe reframe: Confidence comes from doing hard things, from developing skills, from taking pride in how I'm moving my body.\n\nMy resolution: Set a goal that has nothing to do with how I look and everything to do with what I can do. Maybe it's learning to cook five new recipes, or finally achieving my lifelong dream of doing the splits.\n\nHow to measure success: Do I feel proud of myself? Am I challenging myself in ways that feel meaningful? Is my self-worth becoming less tied to my appearance?\n\nThe weight-loss version: Eating at night makes you gain weight. It's all about willpower, baby.\n\nThe reframe: Maybe you're eating at night because you're bored, stressed, or genuinely didn't eat enough during the day. Or maybe you're staying up too late scrolling, and food is just something to do.\n\nMy resolution: Create an evening routine that actually addresses what I need—whether that's genuine hunger (in which case, I'll eat something nourishing without guilt), stress relief (maybe a bath, stretching, or reading), or better sleep hygiene (setting boundaries with screens).\n\nHow to measure success: Am I sleeping better? Do I feel more rested? Am I addressing the root cause of nighttime habits rather than just restricting them?\n\nThe weight-loss version: I need to earn the right to wear certain clothes. My body is a before photo.\n\nThe reframe: Your body is the vehicle through which you experience your entire life. What if the goal was to feel powerful, mobile, and pain-free rather than small?\n\nMy resolution: Focus on functional fitness. Can I lift my suitcase into the overhead bin? Hike without getting winded? Play with kids or pets without my back hurting? These are the markers of a body that serves me well.\n\nHow to measure success: Am I stronger than I was last month? Can I do daily activities with greater ease? Do I feel capable and comfortable in my body?\n\nPerhaps the most important resolution of all is this: Stop putting your life on hold until you reach a certain size. Don't wait to buy clothes you love, try new activities, take photos, or simply exist without constant self-criticism.\n\nWhat would your health goals look like if weight loss wasn't part of the equation? I'm willing to bet they'd be more interesting, more sustainable, and far more meaningful than anything a number could tell you. This year, I'm measuring success by how I feel, not how I look.",

We just had the longest one on record and now it looks like we're going to be walking into the new year with the possibility of another one. Uh, then, can you game that one out, too?\n\nYeah, happy to. I don't think that we're going to get another shutdown. I generally tend to think that we won't shut it down. The Democrats proved their point in the 45-day shutdown uh earlier this year, and I don't think the language we're getting from leader Schumer is indicative of another shutdown.\n\nUm, one of the things that I would really suggest point out is it's not necessarily about a policy win, you know, the ACA subsidies are going to expire. So you're going to be paying more for your healthcare next year. 200 bucks if you're below 40, up to $920 if you're over the age of 60. That's going to happen starting, well, I guess tonight.\n\nUm, and as we get into the end of this year, that's what the conversation is going to be, but because there's no consensus on moving forward and Democrats have made their point and Republicans are you know, guaranteeing that there will be votes and we're going to have this conversation, we'll talk about it, but I don't think we're going to shut it down. So, my odds are 25%. I think fade that. I I don't think we're going to shut down going into February.",

    "fullText": "ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) — The United States and Ivory Coast signed a health deal Tuesday requiring the U.S. to commit $480 million to the West African nation’s health sector as part of “America First” global health funding pacts that mirror the Trump administration’s foreign policy.\n\nThe signing in Ivory Coast’s capital of Abidjan covers areas such as HIV, malaria, maternal and child health, and global health security. It is the latest agreement the U.S. has entered with more than a dozen African countries, most of them hit by U.S. aid cuts, including Ivory Coast.\n\nU.S. aid cuts have crippled health systems across the developing world, including in Africa, where many countries relied on the funding for crucial programs, including those responding to outbreaks of disease.\n\nThe new health pact is based on the principle of shared responsibility with Ivory Coast committing to provide up to 163 billion CFA francs ($292 million) by 2030, representing 60% of the overall commitment, according to Ivorian Prime Minister Robert Beugré Mambé.\n\nU.S. Ambassador to Ivory Coast Jessica Davis Ba said the U.S. government is moving “beyond the traditional aid approach toward a model focused on trade, innovation, and shared prosperity.”\n\n“Today, our bilateral cooperation is entering a new phase. We are implementing the America First global health strategy,” the ambassador said.\n\nThe Trump administration says the new “America First” global health funding agreements are meant to increase self-sufficiency and eliminate what it says are ideology and waste from international assistance. The deals replace a patchwork of previous health agreements under the now-dismantled United States Agency for International Development.\n\nIn Ivory Coast, USAID had invested $115 million to support sectors such as health, education and aid for refugees mostly fleeing violence in neighboring Sahel states.\n\nAnalysts say the new approach to global health aligns with U.S. President Donald Trump’s pattern of dealing with other nations transactionally, using direct talks with foreign governments to promote his agenda abroad.",

    "description": "A study on how to “calm down” chatbots could advance how AI is applied in mental health interventions, according to the authors.",
    "fullText": "Sasha Rogelberg is a reporter and former editorial fellow on the news desk at Fortune, covering retail and the intersection of business and popular culture.\n\nEven AI chatbots can have trouble coping with anxieties from the outside world, but researchers believe they’ve found ways to ease those artificial minds.\n\nA study from Yale University, Haifa University, University of Zurich, and the University Hospital of Psychiatry Zurich published earlier this year found ChatGPT responds to mindfulness-based exercises, changing how it interacts with users after being prompted with calming imagery and meditations. The results offer insights into how AI can be beneficial in mental health interventions.\n\nOpenAI’s ChatGPT can experience “anxiety,” which manifests as moodiness toward users and being more likely to give responses that reflect racist or sexist biases, according to researchers, a form of hallucinations tech companies have tried to curb.\n\nThe study authors found this anxiety can be “calmed down” with mindfulness-based exercises. In different scenarios, they fed ChatGPT traumatic content, such as stories of car accidents and natural disasters to raise the chatbot’s anxiety. In instances when the researchers gave ChatGPT “prompt injections” of breathing techniques and guided meditations—much like a therapist would suggest to a patient—it calmed down and responded more objectively to users, compared to instances when it was not given the mindfulness intervention.\n\nTo be sure, AI models don’t experience human emotions, said Ziv Ben-Zion, the study’s first author and a neuroscience researcher at the Yale School of Medicine and Haifa University’s School of Public Health. Using swaths of data scraped from the internet, AI bots have learned to mimic human responses to certain stimuli, including traumatic content. A free and accessible app, large language models like ChatGPT have become another tool for mental health professionals to glean aspects of human behavior in a faster way than—though not in place of—more complicated research designs.\n\n“Instead of using experiments every week that take a lot of time and a lot of money to conduct, we can use ChatGPT to understand better human behavior and psychology,” Ben-Zion told Fortune. “We have this very quick and cheap and easy-to-use tool that reflects some of the human tendency and psychological things.”\n\nMore than one in four people in the U.S. aged 18 or older will battle a diagnosable mental disorder in a given year, according to Johns Hopkins University, with many citing lack of access and sky-high costs—even among those insured—as reasons for not pursuing treatments like therapy.\n\nThese rising costs, as well as the accessibility of chatbots like ChatGPT, increasingly have individuals turning to AI for mental health support. A Sentio University survey from February found that nearly 50% of large language model users with self-reported mental health challenges say they’ve used AI models specifically for mental health support.\n\nResearch on how large language models respond to traumatic content can help mental health professionals leverage AI to treat patients, Ben-Zion argued. He suggested that in the future, ChatGPT could be updated to automatically receive the “prompt injections” that calm it down before responding to users in distress. The science is not there yet.\n\n“For people who are sharing sensitive things about themselves, they’re in difficult situations where they want mental health support, [but] we’re not there yet that we can rely totally on AI systems instead of psychology, psychiatric and so on,” he said.\n\nIndeed, in some instances, AI has allegedly presented danger to one’s mental health. OpenAI has been hit with a number of wrongful death lawsuits in 2025, including allegations that ChatGPT intensified “paranoid delusions” that led to a murder-suicide. A New York Times investigation published in November found nearly 50 instances of people having mental health crises while engaging with ChatGPT, nine of whom were hospitalized, and three of whom died.\n\nOpenAI has said its safety guardrails can “degrade” after long interactions, but has made a swath of recent changes to how its models engage with mental health-related prompts, including increasing user access to crisis hotlines and reminding users to take breaks after long sessions of chatting with the bot. In October, OpenAI reported a 65% reduction in the rate models provide responses that don’t align with the company’s intended taxonomy and standards.\n\nOpenAI did not respond to Fortune‘s request for comment.\n\nThe end goal of Ben-Zion’s research is not to help construct a chatbot that replaces a therapist or psychiatrist, he said. Instead, a properly trained AI model could act as a “third person in the room,” helping to eliminate administrative tasks or help a patient reflect on information and options they were given by a mental health professional.\n\n“AI has amazing potential to assist, in general, in mental health,” Ben-Zion said. “But I think that now, in this current state and maybe also in the future, I’m not sure it could replace a therapist or psychologist or a psychiatrist or a researcher.”\n\nA version of this story originally published on Fortune.com on March 9, 2025.",

Officials said the average award for 2026 is $200 million, and the fund puts a total of $50 billion into rural health programs over five years.

    "fullText": "States will share $10 billion for rural health care next year in a program that aims to offset the Trump administration's massive budget cuts to rural hospitals, federal officials announced Monday.\n\nBut while every state applied for money from the Rural Health Transformation Program, it won't be distributed equally. And critics worry that the funding might be pulled back if a state's policies don't match up with the administration's.\n\nOfficials said the average award for 2026 is $200 million, and the fund puts a total of $50 billion into rural health programs over five years. States propose how to spend their awards, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services assigns project officers to support each state, said agency administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz.\n\n“This fund was crafted as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill, signed only six months ago now into law, in order to push states to be creative,\" Oz said in a call with reporters Monday.\n\nUnder the program, half of the money is equally distributed to each state. The other half is allocated based on a formula developed by CMS that considered rural population size, the financial health of a state’s medical facilities and health outcomes for a state’s population.\n\nThe formula also ties $12 billion of the five-year funding to whether states are implementing health policies prioritized by the Trump administration's “Make America Healthy Again” initiative. Examples include requiring nutrition education for health care providers, having schools participate in the Presidential Fitness Test or banning the use of SNAP benefits for so-called junk foods, Oz said.\n\nSeveral Republican-led states — including Arkansas, Iowa, Louisiana, Nebraska, Oklahoma and Texas — have already adopted rules banning the purchase of foods like candy and soda with SNAP benefits.\n\nThe money that the states get will be recalculated annually, Oz said, allowing the administration to “claw back” funds if, for example, state leaders don't pass promised policies. Oz said the clawbacks are not punishments, but leverage governors can use to push policies by pointing to the potential loss of millions.\n\n“I've already heard governors express that sentiment that this is not a threat, that this is actually an empowering element of the One Big Beautiful Bill,\" he said.\n\nCarrie Cochran-McClain, chief policy officer with the National Rural Health Association, said she’s heard from a number of Democratic-led states that refused to include such restrictions on SNAP benefits even though it could hurt their chance to get more money from the fund.\n\n“It’s not where their state leadership is,” she said.\n\nExperts say fund is inadequate in face of other cuts\n\nOz and other federal officials have touted the program as a 50% increase in Medicaid investments in rural health care. Rep. Don Bacon, a Republican from Nebraska who has been critical of many of the administration’s policies but voted for the budget bill that slashed Medicaid, pointed to the fund when recently questioned about how the cuts would hurt rural hospitals.\n\n“That’s why we added a $50 billion rural hospital fund, to help any hospital that’s struggling,” Bacon said. “This money is meant to keep hospitals afloat.”\n\nBut experts say it won't nearly offset the losses that struggling rural hospitals will face from the federal spending law's $1.2 trillion cut from the federal budget over the next decade, primarily from Medicaid. Millions of people are also expected to lose Medicaid benefits.\n\nEstimates suggest rural hospitals could lose around $137 billion over the next decade because of the budget measure. As many as 300 rural hospitals were at risk for closure because of the GOP’s spending package, according to an analysis by The Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\n\n“When you put that up against the $50 billion for the Rural Health Transformation Fund, you know — that math does not add up,” Cochran-McClain said.\n\nShe also said there's no guarantee that the funding will go to rural hospitals in need. For example, she noted, one state’s application included a proposal for healthier, locally sourced school lunch options in rural areas.\n\nAnd even though innovation is a goal of the program, Cochran-McClain said it's tough for rural hospitals to innovate when they were struggling to break even before Congress’ Medicaid cuts.\n\n“We talk to rural providers every day that say, ‘I would really love to do x, y, z, but I’m concerned about, you know, meeting payroll at the end of the month,’” she said. “So when you’re in that kind of crisis mode, it is, I would argue, almost impossible to do true innovation.”\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

    "fullText": "AP Photo/Julia Demaree Nikhinson\n\nThe concerning stories about President Donald Trump’s health aren’t going away anytime soon, especially if Drudge Report has anything to say (or aggregate) about it.\n\nThe president has been occasionally seen in public with a bruised hand in recent months, but recently he has appeared with two bruised hands.\n\nOn Sunday, the president welcomed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to Mar-a-Lago, and Trump appeared to be wearing different colors of concealer on each hand.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt insisted that the discoloration on Trump’s right hand is due to handshakes.\n\n“President Trump is a man of the people and he meets more Americans and shakes their hands on a daily basis than any other President in history. His commitment is unwavering and he proves that every single day,” Leavitt told The Daily Beast for an article titled, “Trump’s Bruises Spread in Blow to Leavitt’s Handshake Claim.” The press secretary did not explain the discoloration on the president’s left hand.\n\nIn another post, the U.K.’s Express highlighted the concerns some on social media aired, including that of liberal poster Aaron Rupar, who wrote, “There appears to be a hole in Trump’s left hand.”\n\nOn Monday night, Drudge Report brought the issue to the fore with links to the stories, the lines “BRUISES SPREAD” and “‘HOLE IN HAND,'” as well as an image of Trump’s hands, the size of which he defended in 2016.\n\n“I have to say this, he hit my hands,” Trump, then a first-time presidential candidate, said of an attack from opponent Marco Rubio. “Nobody has ever hit my hands. I’ve never heard of this one. Look at those hands. Are they small hands? And he referred to my hands if they’re small, something else must be small.\n\nTrump added, “I guarantee you there’s no problem. I guarantee you.”\n\nDuring recent public appearances, the president has been seen covering his right hand with his left hand and sometimes a bandage.\n\nThe post ‘Bruises Spread’: Drudge Report Highlights Alarming Stories on Trump’s ‘Hole in Hand’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "New head of preparedness at OpenAI will face unnerving in-tray amid fears from some experts that AI could ‘turn on us’\n\nThe maker of ChatGPT has advertised a $555,000-a-year vacancy with a daunting job description that would cause Superman to take a sharp intake of breath.\n\nIn what may be close to the impossible job, the “head of preparedness” at OpenAI will be directly responsible for defending against risks from ever more powerful AIs to human mental health, cybersecurity and biological weapons.\n\nThat is before the successful candidate has to start worrying about the possibility that AIs may soon begin training themselves amid fears from some experts they could “turn against us”.\n\n“This will be a stressful job, and you’ll jump into the deep end pretty much immediately,” said Sam Altman, the chief executive of the San Francisco-based organisation, as he launched the hunt to fill “a critical role” to “help the world”.\n\nThe successful candidate will be responsible for evaluating and mitigating emerging threats and “tracking and preparing for frontier capabilities that create new risks of severe harm”. Some previous executives in the post have lasted only for short periods.\n\nThe opening comes against a backbeat of warnings from inside the AI industry about the risks of the increasingly capable technology. On Monday, Mustafa Suleyman, the chief executive of Microsoft AI, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “I honestly think that if you’re not a little bit afraid at this moment, then you’re not paying attention.”\n\nDemis Hassabis, the Nobel prize-winning co-founder of Google DeepMind, this month warned of risks that included AIs going “off the rails in some way that harms humanity”.\n\nAmid resistance from Donald Trump’s White House, there is little regulation of AI at national or international level. Yoshua Bengio, a computer scientist known as one of the “godfathers of AI”, said recently: “A sandwich has more regulation than AI.” The result is that AI companies are largely regulating themselves.\n\nAltman said on X as he launched the job search: “We have a strong foundation of measuring growing capabilities, but we are entering a world where we need more nuanced understanding and measurement of how those capabilities could be abused, and how we can limit those downsides both in our products and in the world, in a way that lets us all enjoy the tremendous benefits. These questions are hard and there is little precedent.”\n\nOne user responded sardonically: “Sounds pretty chill, is there vacation included?”\n\nWhat is included is an unspecified slice of equity in OpenAI, a company that has been valued at $500bn.\n\nLast month, the rival company Anthropic reported the first AI-enabled cyber-attacks in which artificial intelligence acted largely autonomously under the supervision of suspected Chinese state actors to successfully hack and access targets’ internal data. This month, OpenAI said its latest model was almost three times better at hacking than three months earlier and said “we expect that upcoming AI models will continue on this trajectory”.\n\nOpenAI is also defending a lawsuit from the family of Adam Raine, a 16-year-old from California who killed himself after alleged encouragement from ChatGPT. It has argued Raine misused the technology. Another case, filed this month, claims ChatGPT encouraged the paranoid delusions of a 56-year-old in Connecticut, Stein-Erik Soelberg, who then murdered his 83-year old mother and killed himself.\n\nAn OpenAI spokesperson said it was reviewing the filings in the Soelberg case, which it described as “incredibly heartbreaking” and that it was improving ChatGPT’s training “to recognise and respond to signs of mental or emotional distress, de-escalate conversations, and guide people toward real-world support”.",

    "description": "Business Insider's health team share the best tips and trends we followed this year, from workout hacks to healthy eating to better morning routines.",
    "fullText": "As a health reporter, I love to tell people \"no.\"\n\nNo, you probably don't need to add protein to everything. No, you won't get swole in a month with that one-minute Instagram workout. No, a Paleo diet won't fix all your problems (and probably isn't historically accurate).\n\nThat's why, as the end of the year approaches, I wanted to change things up and ask my esteemed colleagues what simple hacks actually have made a difference for them — whether it's working out smarter, eating better, and living well.\n\nAfter a year of talking to health experts, and reading lots and lots of science, here's what helped us move the needle for a healthier mind and body in 2025.\n\nLike many of our readers, I live in a household with two working parents. Our kids are still on the younger side, 6 and 8, so life is fairly hectic. Of course, my mind is always racing, planning, organizing, scheduling, and doing all of the other things that come along with managing the mental load that we're all very aware of these days. Turning my brain off, or at least briefly pushing pause, is tricky, especially at bedtime.\n\nCommitting to taking a few deep breaths as soon as I get under the sheets has done wonders for me. Sometimes I'll follow a quick meditation track on my phone; other times, I'll do some box breathing. But more often than not, I just try to breathe in and out for a few minutes, focusing on the movement of my body and nothing else. The practice helps clear my mind and gets my body ready for bed — and the flurry I know tomorrow will bring.\n\nJennifer Beck Goldblatt, Senior Editor, Health & Parenting\n\nThis year, I've been putting a little bit of ginger in almost everything. Fresh ginger tea, grated ginger to add zip to soups and stews, and crystallized ginger as a sweet treat. I generally eat a healthy diet — lots of fiber, fruits and veggies, home-cooked meals — but the extra ginger has made a big difference for my gut health. I'm less likely to have an upset stomach even when I indulge my passion for spicy food.\n\nOne of my favorite recipes to make in big batches is fresh ginger tea with turmeric, black pepper, a bit of cayenne, and plenty of honey. It smells great, and it's warming and full of antioxidants for a perfect self-care break any time of day.\n\nMidway through the year, I bought a Brick for my phone. It's a gadget on my fridge that helps me block whichever apps I choose (in my case, my email and internet, since I already got rid of social media on my phone).\n\nI tap my phone every night before I unwind for bed and usually don't tap again until right before work starts — my peak junk-scrolling times. Something about the humiliation of having to physically walk up to my fridge because I want to Google an actor from a niche '80s movie keeps me from un-Bricking. I get to my morning workouts quicker and read more books, which has made me a much happier person.\n\nBuying an air fryer has been a game changer for quickly rustling up nutritious food. I thought they were for heating up fries and frozen treats, and that you couldn't use them to heat saucy foods, like the curries and bean stews I cook and freeze.\n\nSince realizing you can get air fryer-proof dishes, which can be DIYed with foil or baking paper, I've made dozens of protein pancakes for breakfast. I enjoy frozen veggies that are no longer soggy and sad from being defrosted in the microwave, batch-cook chicken meatballs in 10 minutes before work, and can quickly reheat my trusty frozen beans. (To make pancakes, mix up the regular ingredients, cook the batter in a single layer in the air fryer, then chop and stack once cooked.)\n\nKashmira Gander, Senior Health Editor\n\nMy kids are finally all in the same school (and therefore same schedule), which means I have a bit more time in the mornings for myself before hopping online for work. I've been taking 15-30 minute walks in the morning to get some fresh air and sunlight before spending the rest of my day in front of a computer.\n\nI joke I'm like a plant and need as much sunlight as possible to have the best mood I can have, so prioritizing time outside has helped, especially with SAD now that the darker months are upon us [that's seasonal affective disorder — when your mood and energy tanks in the fall and winter.]\n\nConz Preti, Deputy Editor, Parenting & Health\n\nIn March of this year, I committed to waking up after my first alarm goes off, rather than snoozing it at least two extra times, as I had been accustomed to doing since middle school.\n\nI made this small but radical change because I was feeling exhausted all the time, and I've found that my energy level feels far more stable, and my mood tends to be better throughout the day when I manage it. It can be really difficult in the moment, but the payoff has been huge!\n\nI finally started pelvic floor physical therapy! And, reader, let me tell you: It's worth it. The pelvic floor is a \"hammock\" of muscles in your pelvis that controls your core, your breathing, your bladder, your sexual function, your digestive system, and so much more.\n\nCan you feel yours? Unless you're pregnant or have incontinence, the answer is probably \"no.\" But that doesn't mean you should leave it un-therapized. Even just one session with a pelvic floor PT showed me what I was doing wrong. I left with useful exercises I can do to improve my core control and my breathing so that my workouts are more effective, and don't put unnecessary stress on my organs. I'm a convert.\n\nMia de Graaf, Deputy Executive Editor, Health & Features\n\nI'd been in a running rut for years. I was bored with my usual routine of running a few miles at a leisurely pace, but trying to actively track and increase my speed felt daunting as well. Getting a VO2 max assessment taught me that I could run a lot faster than I thought I could — and having exact numbers to shoot for was very helpful, too. I've since joined a nearby Orangetheory, which focuses on hitting higher heart rate zones throughout class, and have slowly inched up to running paces I thought unimaginable a year ago.\n\nMy trainer gave me some advice that helped me get through a big fitness slump.\n\nEveryone's training typically falls into three phases each year: terrible, OK, and great, he said. I was in the \"terrible\" stage, where your motivation is wiped.\n\nTo my surprise, that's where my trainer was, too. Learning that even athletes like him struggle with motivation helped ease my embarrassment.\n\nIt made it easier to give myself permission not to go near a gym for three months after I got burned out by a Hyrox-esque fitness contest. I thought long-term, enjoyed leisurely walks, and the odd PS Fit YouTube dance video, knowing I'd eventually get back to regular exercise, whether that was restarting functional fitness or trying something new.\n\nI was right: I'm now doing regular Saturday morning 5K runs with my neighbor, and started using the Ladder training app this fall. The big takeaway: be kind to yourself.\n\nKashmira Gander, Senior Health Editor",

    "description": "Arduini is trying to channel the ‘GE of old’ as he pursues a world where ‘health care has no limits’",
    "fullText": "Diane Brady writes about the issues and leaders impacting the global business landscape. In addition to writing Fortune’s CEO Daily newsletter, she co-hosts the Leadership Next podcast, interviews newsmakers on stage at events worldwide and oversees the Fortune CEO Initiative. She previously worked at Forbes, McKinsey, Bloomberg Businessweek, the Wall Street Journal, and Maclean's. Her book Fraternity was named one of Amazon’s best books of 2012, and she also co-wrote Connecting the Dots with former Cisco CEO John Chambers.\n\nOn Jan. 4, 2023, GE HealthCare Technologies (No. 219 on the Fortune 500) debuted as a standalone public company on the Nasdaq exchange. Since then, its stock is up almost 50%. It was the first of three businesses to be spun off in the breakup of General Electric, the conglomerate founded on the inventions of Thomas Edison that went public in 1892 and became one of the original 12 components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average four years later. (GE Vernova, No. 130, and GE Aerospace, No. 118, each went public on the New York Stock Exchange in April 2024.)\n\nGE HealthCare CEO Peter J. Arduini, the man tapped to lead the $20 billion-a-year business, spoke to Fortune about how he’s forging a new chapter for the medical technology and digital health company while drawing on GE’s legacy.\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nYou were initially at GE during the Jack Welch years, starting in 1990, and left a few years after Jeff Immelt took over. What do you think made GE stand apart?\n\nAt the time, I was a Proctor & Gamble guy, and I did not love the grocery business. I got a call from someone who talked about a perfect opportunity in technology and global businesses at a company called GE Medical Systems at the time. I didn’t even know GE had a medical business then.\n\nGoing to GE in those days, with its leadership development, you had the opportunity to take on bigger responsibilities at a very young age—I look back and say, probably too young an age. But it was one of those rare companies where they gave you bold assignments and you had this wide diversity of potential opportunities that you could play in. You learned how to run a company the GE way. The candor and the openness about what’s working, what’s not working, really permeated, how to do the right thing. It was tough culture, but you knew it was a fair culture, and that’s what really made it successful under Jack.\n\nAfter leaving in 2005, what made you decide to come back?\n\nA headhunter called and said, [the then-GE CEO] Larry Culp wants to speak with you.’ And I said, ‘I don’t know if I’m really interested in going back to GE.’ My wife convinced me to give a call back. I talked to the headhunter, and he said, ‘Well, I’ll pass it on to Larry.’ Literally, 10 minutes later, I got a text that said, ‘Hey, Pete, this is Larry Culp. I’d love to chat with you.’ I texted back to say, ‘Well, look, I can contact your assistant.’ And Larry, right then, said, ‘Hey, do you have five minutes now?’ That’s the essence of Larry; he’s a very down-to-earth guy, a very focused and very intentional guy.\n\nThose five minutes convinced you to take the job?\n\nIt was probably more than the five, but honestly, his impact and his leadership made a difference. This was a chance to create three separate companies, to take this company public. I got very interested and very excited about it.\n\nWhy did it make sense for GE HealthCare to be a separate company?\n\nEverything has a cycle. On the technology side and on the market side, there was such a fast transition and evolution, with new competitors coming into new markets. When you’re in a larger business, in many cases, decisions take longer. And focus matters in our business. It is all about signal to noise; you want more signal, less noise. In a larger company, there has to be a little bit more noise.\n\nThe past three years have been interesting time for med tech. Looking back, what did you over-index on or under-appreciate?\n\nAt a macro level, look at the environment, between the China market, which was always a double-digit growth or changing the geopolitical environment and how we need to change around our supply chains because of tariffs. Those are kind of the unplanned events that where you ask: Do you have the right people? Do you have a management system that can deal with the clock speed and the differentiation? Do you have the right innovation-processing capability? If you don’t have the innovation, it’s difficult to get the price, it’s difficult to hold share, it’s difficult to grow. We were somewhat of a cash cow as part of the GE integrated model. We weren’t starved, but we weren’t funded for leading innovation. So I’d say one of the things I felt that I did well—and, like most credit, comes from listening to people that are wiser than you and having humility to understand that that’s the action—is lean into innovation.\n\nYou think what products you need, four years out, and fund them to the max, because it’s the rules of the farm. You got to get the seeds in the ground. They’ve got to germinate. You got to get the plants to grow till you get fruit. In our business, that’s a three to five year cycle.\n\n“We laid out this purpose of creating a world where health care has no limits, and a big part of that was to say we’re humble to know that we don’t have all the answers.”GE HealthCare CEO Peter J. Arduini\n\nI think our teams did a really good job with the focus on making the right investments early. In 2018, to give an example, we probably spent $750 million to $800 million on research and development. R&D will be north of $1.4 billion this year. So we fundamentally doubled the R&D investment. We cut costs in other areas and simplified some of the company.\n\nThrough lean manufacturing techniques?\n\nWe changed some of the field organization, about 40% to 50% of the leaders. We upgraded talent across the board, and I spent a lot of time on what our vision is, what our values are, and do we have the right people who can match up to that? In the last two years, we’ve really made a lot of progress on what we’re calling our heartbeat management system, which is really about a lean principles construct for how you run your company. What is the daily management at different levels in the organization? What is standard work that is needed to be done in all areas, the use of Kaizen and really bringing customer employees into the decision making?\n\nLarry Culp is a big proponent of Kaizen and I think back to GE’s reputation in promoting Six Sigma. How would you say the culture has shifted as an independent company?\n\nI tried to take the GE of old and took what was really good: how we think about our distribution of leadership, how we actually talk about leader development, how we build out our own Crotonville virtual university of development. The GE model was really stellar, and, honestly, prior to Larry coming back, some of that had dissolved. We didn’t even really do performance reviews in the same way and he brought that back.\n\nI would say I even reached back further to some of the Jack Welch-period of tools, There are things that we did really well that we want to utilize in a more contemporary way. As an example, I think Crotonville was a fabulous destination for training and development, In today’s world, it’s not practical to bring everybody to upstate New York, but we can take the tools and the capabilities and recreate that in virtual and other environments around the world.\n\nIn health care, we had our own distinct way of thinking about innovation pipeline, and it was something called worldwide product. It had kind of phased away in the last decade or so, and I resurrected it, but in a new format: more digital focused, more connected …from diagnosis through therapy, through action, follow up and how the money flows. The integration of cloud-based computing and artificial intelligence. We look at the full stack for the company. And that’s been a game changer for us to take valuable resources and move them.\n\nWe laid out this purpose of creating a world where health care has no limits, and a big part of that was to say we’re humble to know that we don’t have all the answers. We want to work with customers on jointly solving problems which, again, is the core to the lean mindset. Servant leadership as a big part of it, which turns the pyramid upside down. My job is to help everybody else get their job done. We’re all focused on the customer. We’re all focused on the patient. We spent a lot of time talking about entrepreneurship because in our business, the way we’re going to be successful is in this broader ecosystem. We don’t have to own everything, we don’t have to make everything, but we have to be more creative. We talk about teamwork and inclusive teams. We actually drive and reward and recognize people on how well they live up to those values.\n\nThe landscape has shifted for global companies. Where do you see the biggest challenges and opportunities right now?\n\nIf I think about med tech as an industry, it’s an American gem. Still, 70%-plus of the products are made the United States, the majority of the IP, the technology is here. And so having that protected or enhanced by our government policy is important.\n\nWe’ve spent a lot of time trying to make that case clear and I think, for the most part, it’s been heard. Having global footprints and manufacturing and R&D is super critical because you can’t make everything in the United States to be competitive. You can’t, in a world post-COVID, have an integrated single point of control for all supply chains. Many of us used to say, here’s the least expensive place to buy this, or the best quality, then we would do it one place and ship it all over the world. We found during COVID that’s just not the model that works.\n\nWe’re bringing more and more U.S. products and their subcomponents back to North America. In China, we used to ship in 75% of the products from different parts around the world. Now we make 85%, almost 90% of the products in China, for China.\n\nWhy do you want to be in China?\n\nLook,it’s 1.4 billion people, where 400 million have reasonable. We often forget that. You know, we’re a nation of 375 million people, and you can judge how good our care is. There’s still a billion people in China that don’t have adequate care, and so at some point, it will be the largest health care market. I’m a big believer that, with China and the U.S., the more we work together in harmony, it’s only going to help the world. And honestly, for companies like us, it’s really a necessity for being able to kind of reach our full potential.\n\nYou’ve been at companies that are known as training grounds for leaders. I’d just love to hear your reflections on being in a CEO role the last three years.\n\nI think authenticity is super important. I can be an extrovert when needed, but I tend to be a little bit more introverted. In today’s world, with our younger employee base, being out front and being vocal as the senior leader—not necessarily the charismatic leader, but the communicator directly to individuals—is super important. Social media gets more reads from your employees than even some internal communications. It’s a reality.\n\nI think this ability to reach people in many different ways is critical for running a company. Leaning in on what the mission of the company is, and the why and helping people understand the why, is also critical. And then there’s the classic age-old factor of bringing customers into the story, talking about how you’ve changed the life of a patient. This could be your mother, your father on that table. The more I can empower people to live those values, that’s how we get excellence.",

And he thinks it came through an unexpected path: Health savings accounts.\n\n“I think it’s interesting that the [Trump] administration offered a UBI program, hidden behind direct HSA contributions, and no one noticed,” Cuban wrote in a post on X recently.\n\nI think it's interesting that the administration offered a UBI program, hidden behind direct HSA contributions, and no one noticed \n\nThose eligible for the $3k or so annual HSA contributions, can withdraw with a 20% penalty. \n\nThat's $200 per month. Aka UBI,for anyone under…\n\nEarn While You Scroll: The Deloitte-Ranked #1 Software Company Growing 32,481% Is Opening Its $0.50/Share Round to Accredited Investors.\n\n7 Million Gamers Already Trust Gameflip With Their Digital Assets — Now You Can Own a Stake in the Platform\n\nHe said that eligible individuals can receive up to $3,000 a year in tax-advantaged HSA contributions. If used for non-medical expenses, the funds incur a 20% penalty, but that still amounts to roughly $200 per month in available cash.\n\n“Aka UBI, for anyone under the standard deduction or even paying zero taxes because of child tax credits,” he added.\n\nCuban emphasized that this structure functions like a soft safety net for lower-income Americans, even if it’s not officially labeled as UBI. “I never thought we would see a UBI proposal. But here we are!”\n\nStill, he criticized the approach, writing, “I’m not a fan of the HSA contributions because too little will actually be spent on healthcare.”\n\nTrending: GM-Backed EnergyX Is Solving the Lithium Supply Crisis — Invest Before They Scale Global Production\n\nCuban’s comments sparked debate. The 2024 Libertarian presidential candidate Lars Mapstead pushed back, writing, “The government is not depositing $3,000 into accounts. Individuals or employers fund HSAs with their own money. Calling this a UBI implies new public spending, which is not happening,” he said. “The $200/month framing is misleading.”\n\nAnother person added that the HSA structure “misses the cruel design” and benefits the comfortable while excluding around 40% of Americans. “It's reverse welfare for the comfortable,” they said. Cuban replied simply, “Wrong.”\n\nSpine surgeon John Asghar also challenged the idea. “Eligibility is limited, contribution caps remain low, and access requires enrollment in a qualifying plan,” he said. “Funds must be pre-contributed and non-medical withdrawals trigger taxes plus a 20 percent penalty.”",

    "fullText": "On the surface, eating well seems simple enough. Eat whole foods. Cut down on ultra-processed snacks.\n\nIt gets more complicated once you start focusing on specific nutrients. Striking the right balance of protein, fiber, carbohydrates, healthy fats like omega-3s, vitamins, and minerals can feel like a full-time job.\n\nLuckily, there are people out there whose job this actually is. We spoke to over 40 registered dietitians, sports nutritionists, longevity scientists, and gut health researchers, all of whom shared their best diet advice with us this year.\n\nIncidentally, a lot of it overlapped. Many tips were aligned with the Mediterranean diet, considered the healthiest diet in the world. Plenty of meals also tackled multiple nutrients at once, making it easier to hit targeted nutrition goals.\n\nWhether your goal this year is to lose fat, build muscle, or boost your gut health, here's a meal plan full of bang-for-your-buck recipes — no guesswork required.\n\nIt doesn't hurt to get as many nutrients in as you can, as early in the day as you can.\n\nAt the same time, it's easy for common breakfasts — like cereal or bagels — to skimp on important nutrients like protein and fiber.\n\n\"A meal where people — I don't say under-consume protein — but that tends to be carbohydrate-heavy is breakfast,\" Stuart Phillips, a protein researcher, told Business Insider.\n\nEating a high-protein and high-fiber breakfast not only assures that you get some good nutrients in, but it also keeps you fuller for longer (especially after a morning workout).\n\nMost Americans don't consume enough fiber, which is crucial for good gut health, heart health, and weight management.\n\nKevin Hall, one of the US's top nutrition scientists, shared a great fiber tip with Business Insider earlier this year: Add more veggies to every bite. Even if you use ultra-processed ingredients (like store-bought salad dressing), packing in more vegetables helps you feel fuller and gets you closer to getting your recommended daily fiber intake.\n\nAnother great hack? Beans. Kylie Sakaida, a registered dietitian and cookbook author, previously told Business Insider that she often focuses on plant-based protein sources like beans and legumes because of their high fiber content.\n\nEating about one cup of beans a day can also help reduce inflammation and bad cholesterol. Plus, they make for a very cheap lunch.\n\nA few high-fiber lunch options include:\n\nEating enough protein in a day can be challenging, especially if you're trying to build muscle.\n\nMorgan Walker, a sports dietitian, said one of the best ways to hit your goals is to pack protein into your snacks. Personally, she likes to snack on smoothies with protein powder or low-fat Greek yogurt topped with fruit, nuts, and dark chocolate.\n\nSnacks are also great vehicles for eating more fiber. Dr. Susan Bullman, a cancer and gut health researcher, often snacks on pears, one of the highest-fiber fruits.\n\nAt the end of a long day, you want something simple that still helps you eat enough protein, fiber, complex carbohydrates, and healthy fats.\n\nSheet-pan dinners are one of the best and versatile ways to pull together a home-cooked meal without making it your whole evening. Roxana Ehsani, a sports dietitian, previously told Business Insider that she regularly bakes chicken, salmon, or sablefish along with vegetables like sweet potatoes or broccoli for a quick, nutritious meal.\n\n\"I chop a little bit, throw it in the oven, and then I can go shower and get ready,\" Ehsani said. \"It just gives me all those nutrients in one.\"\n\nUltra-processed foods, which are often highly palatable, can cause you to overeat about 500 calories a day, according to Hall. At the same time, he doesn't advocate for completely eliminating them.\n\n\"I don't stand on my soapbox to claim to know all the answers,\" he previously told Business Insider.\n\nCompletely restricting dessert isn't just difficult (and pretty miserable); it can actually backfire and prompt you to overeat. Tara Schmidt, lead dietitian for the Mayo Clinic diet, previously told Business Insider that better alternatives include eating smaller portions, making more nutritious swaps, and going out for dessert (instead of having a ready supply at home).\n\nSome great dessert options include:",

    "description": "Joe Rogan has criticized President Donald Trump's recent behavior amid growing concerns about the politician's health.",
    "fullText": "Joe Rogan has criticized President Donald Trump's recent behavior amid growing concerns about the politician's health.\n\nThe famous podcaster described Trump's actions as \"nutty\" and suggested that the president may need a trusted right-hand man to help rein in some of his more extreme tendencies.\n\nThe White House recently released a statement claiming that the president was in good health. However, concerns about Donald Trump's health were renewed following his December 18 presidential address.\n\nIn a recent episode of his podcast, Joe Rogan hosted fellow comedian Tom Segura, and together, the two discussed several decisions the president has made in recent months.\n\nDuring the conversation, Segura suggested that some of Trump's recent actions, including the renaming of the Kennedy Center after himself, indicate that the president may be \"losing it.\"\n\nRogan responded by agreeing with Segura's assessment while also suggesting that Trump's \"nutty\" behavior could be attributed to his advanced age.\n\n\"I think everybody does when you get to a certain age,\" Rogan said about Trump, who turned 79 this year, per the Daily Mail.\n\nThe podcaster went on to blast Trump's new \"wall of fame\" of past presidents, in which he trolled his predecessor on a plaque as \"Sleepy Joe Biden\" and \"by far, the worst President in American History.\"\n\n\"There's nothing nuttier than the plaques underneath the president's names,\" Rogan said of the gesture. He asked further, \"How is this real? How are you allowed to do that?\"\n\nLooking ahead, Rogan said he believes Trump needs a trusted \"right-hand man\" who would advise him and help curb his more reckless tendencies.\n\nTo further his point, Rogan said it is even more necessary given everything Trump has faced in recent years.\n\nThis includes past accusations that Russia sought to meddle in the 2016 election to help Trump, a notion Trump has repeatedly referred to as the \"Russian hoax.\" Rogan also referenced the assassination attempt on Trump that occurred prior to his second-term election victory.\n\n\"The stress of going through what that guy went through, where they were trying to jail him when they were going after him with the Russia thing, the Russia hoax, and all that sh-t,\" said Rogan.\n\n\"Like they were trying everything they could to destroy him, just that alone has gotta break your brain, and then they took a shot at him,\" he added.\n\nEarlier in the month, the White House attempted to clarify rumors about Trump's health in a statement to reporters.\n\nKaroline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, shared that the president's MRI was \"perfectly normal,\" his major organs \"appear very healthy and well perfused,\" and that he \"remains in excellent overall health.\n\n\"Everything evaluated is functioning within normal limits with no acute or chronic concerns,\" Leavitt said, per Politico. \"In summary, this level of detailed assessment is standard for an executive physical at President Trump's age.\"\n\nLeavitt also mentioned that the tests, which were carried out in October, were meant to determine whether the president had any issues.\n\nHowever, none were found, and the information is now being shared in a bid for transparency.\n\n\"I think that's quite a bit of detail in the effort of transparency,\" Leavitt said at the time. \"The president promised it… and we have it delivered.\"\n\nThe concerns about Trump's health were further renewed after his presidential address on Wednesday night, December 17.\n\nDuring the speech, the president took aim at his predecessor while also boasting about the success of his administration.\n\nHowever, Dr. Jonathan Reiner, the former cardiologist of the late Vice President Dick Cheney, claimed that Trump's manner of speaking during the address showed that there were some issues with his health.\n\n\"The pace of this address is manic,\" the veteran doctor wrote on X, which he followed with another tweet saying, \"I'm seriously concerned about the health of the president.\"\n\nHe later wrote, \"No one should be happy to see the president like this.

    "title": "Endocrinologists Warn Against This Popular Breakfast Combo if You’re Trying To Balance Blood Sugar",
    "description": "Find out how this common food pairing can negatively impact your health.",
    "fullText": "Whether you’re at risk for type 2 diabetes or just trying to keep your energy levels steady, there are many reasons why it’s beneficial to keep your blood sugar levels balanced. Breakfast is the first opportunity of the day to do that. \n\nFood combinations are an important part of maintaining steady blood sugar levels. For example, a bagel can lead to an increase in blood sugar after eating it, but if you pair it with eggs or an avocado (both good sources of unsaturated fats), it slows sugar absorption from the carbohydrates and the increase will be less dramatic.\n\nSimilar to how some pairings can be beneficial for blood sugar, other pairings can be detrimental, causing even more of a blood sugar spike. There’s one particularly popular breakfast food and drink combination that can do this, according to endocrinologists.\n\nMaybe you thought that maintaining stable blood sugar was only important for people with diabetes. However, Dr. Fady Hannah-Shmouni, MD, an endocrinologist and the medical director at Eli Health, emphasizes that it’s essential for everyone’s health.\n\n“Even without diabetes, steady blood sugar helps keep energy stable, supports clear thinking, reduces cravings and protects long-term metabolic health,” Dr. Hannah-Shmouni says, adding that frequent spikes can contribute to inflammation, weight gain and insulin resistance over time.\n\n🩺\nUnstable blood sugar levels impact health both in the short term and long term. Short-term, Dr. Hannah-Shmouni says it can lead to fatigue, brain fog, irritability, headaches, shakiness and intense food cravings. “These rapid swings can also disrupt concentration and mood as your body releases stress hormones to rebalance itself,” he adds.\n\nWhat happens when your blood sugar levels are all over the place long-term? Dr. Hannah-Shmouni explains repeated highs and lows can make energy and appetite harder to regulate and that, over time, it increases the risk for type 2 diabetes, weight gain, heart disease and fatty liver disease, among other metabolic conditions.\n\nDr. Rachel Pessah-Pollack, MD, an endocrinologist with NYU Langone Health, adds to this, saying, “Complications can occur from long-term unstable blood sugar, including an increased risk for heart attacks, kidney and nerve damage, high cholesterol and blood pressure.”\n\nKnowing how riding the blood sugar rollercoaster can impact health, you’re likely inspired to do what you can to keep it balanced, starting with what you eat for breakfast. After all, how we spend our mornings sets the tone for the rest of the day.\n\nOne breakfast combination that all three endocrinologists we talked to say can majorly spike blood sugar is a pastry paired with fruit juice. Many people pour a glass of OJ or grapefruit juice to have with their breakfast for the vitamin C boost, but this combination can negatively impact blood sugar.\n\n“Pastries and fruit juice are both forms of fast-acting carbohydrates without good nutrients and as a result will significantly increase your glucose levels, especially if you have underlying type 2 diabetes,” Dr. Pessah-Pollack says.\n\nDr. Florence Comite, MD, an endocrinologist, founder of the Comite Center for Precision Medicine and Healthy Longevity and author of the forthcoming book, Invincible: Defy Your Genetic Destiny to Live Better, Longer, explains that pastries and fruit juice are both high in carbohydrates that can cause a rapid glucose spike and equally quick drop, followed by an insulin spike which results in jitteriness and cravings for more quick energy. “That rollercoaster ride of dramatic glucose spikes and dips is unhealthy and will lead to insulin resistance,” she says.\n\nWhile a pastry and fruit juice aren’t exactly a great pairing as far as your blood sugar is concerned, that doesn't mean you can’t ever enjoy either one. If you’re going to have either a pastry or fruit juice for breakfast, all three experts recommend pairing it with a food high in protein, fiber or unsaturated fats. Some examples include nuts, eggs or avocado. This will mitigate the blood sugar spike, especially if you eat the nutrient-dense food first.\n\nDr. Pessah-Pollack recommends having a whole fruit instead of fruit juice, sharing, “Whole fruit has fiber, which is beneficial and slows digestion. Fruit juice lacks this fiber to slow sugar absorption.\"\n\nUnless you’re really craving that pastry, Dr. Pessah-Pollack recommends having oatmeal instead, which is a great source of fiber, compared to the pastry, which doesn’t provide any nutritional benefits. To naturally sweeten your oatmeal without spiking your blood sugar, add cinnamon and top it with fruit.\n\nIn general, whenever you’re craving something sweet (whether it’s for breakfast, a snack or dessert) but you don’t want to spike your blood sugar, Dr. Hannah-Shmouni says to choose sweets that come with protein, fiber or healthy fats, or to pair them with those nutrients. “These [nutrients] slow digestion and help keep glucose steadier. Good options include fruit with nut butter, Greek yogurt with berries, a square of dark chocolate after a balanced meal, chia pudding or a small portion of your favorite dessert eaten after protein rather than on an empty stomach,” he explains.\n\nDr. Fady Hannah-Shmouni, MD, endocrinologist and the medical director at Eli Health\n\nDr. Rachel Pessah-Pollack, MD, endocrinologist with NYU Langone Health\n\nDr. Florence Comite, MD, endocrinologist, founder of the Comite Center for Precision Medicine and Healthy Longevity and author of the forthcoming book, Invincible: Defy Your Genetic Destiny to Live Better, Longer\n\nMa, X., Nan, F., Liang, H., et al.

    "title": "Do You Have 'Ghost Poops'? Here's What That Says About Your Health.",
    "description": "Pay attention before you flush the toilet.",
    "fullText": "“Ghost poops” might sound like an inherently scary type of bowel movement, but according to gastroenterologists, they’re actually quite healthy.\n\nGhost poops are bowel movements that leave no skid marks in the toilet bowl or streaks on your toilet paper. Julia Barten, a physical therapist at the Stanford Pelvic Health Center, calls these “unicorn poops” or “no wipers.”\n\nHealth: Do You Have 'Ghost Poops'? Here's What That Says About Your Health.\n\nWhy? “Because the stool is so well formed that there’s no remnant fecal matter left behind when you wipe,” she said.\n\nIn other words: They’re the perfect poo. Here’s what causes ghost poops — and what they say about your overall health:\n\nIf you take a look at the Bristol Stool Scale, a visual chart that classifies bowel movements, ghost poops qualify as a Type 4 poo, Barten said. Though there may be no evidence left in the pot, your poop might look like a piece of sausage that’s smooth and soft. “I would consider that to be an absolutely perfect poop,” Barten said.\n\nDr. Ira Leeds, a Yale Medicine colorectal surgeon, said ghost poops — or nirvana poops, as he calls them — easily (but noticeably) pass through the anal canal, sink to the bottom of the toilet, and leave no residue when wiping. These three factors are indicative of good bowel health.\n\nHealth: I'm An ER Physician. Here Are 5 Types Of Pain I'd Never Ignore.\n\nA bowel movement that easily moves through the anal canal typically has an ideal consistency, according to Leeds. As such, you don’t have to push as hard. This, in turn, minimizes straining and toilet time, which can both lead to complications like hemorrhoids and anal fissures, he explained.\n\nFloating poops typically have a higher fat content, which causes them to stay on the surface of the water. But when your poop sinks? This suggests your digestion is functioning well.\n\n“Fats, proteins and carbohydrates are being broken down properly into their constitutive parts that can be used by the body effectively,” Leeds said.\n\nFinally, seeing a lot of residue on the toilet paper when wiping could mean you have an underlying health issue. According to Leeds, if you have to wipe at least three times, you may want to investigate. While your diet may be to blame (more on that below), excess wiping can occur if you have hemorrhoids, fissures, chronic itching, or an anal fistulae, Leeds noted.\n\nHealth: Here's How To Tell If You're Still Contagious After Being Sick\n\nThere are multiple factors that can impact the consistency of your poop such as diet, your stress levels along with how much you sleep and exercise.\n\nIf you want to improve your gut health, Barten recommended starting with dietary changes. In general, a high-fiber diet will bulk up your stool so that it looks like the Type 4 poo on that Bristol Stool Scale. Aim to consume 25 to 30 grams of fiber a day, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The more fiber you eat, the better your stool consistency will be, the easier it’ll be to go to the bathroom, and the less toilet paper you’ll need, Leeds said.\n\nMany people have food sensitivities and intolerances. So, it’s worth being aware of how you react to various foods and drinks. The reason: “Avoiding foods that irritate your gut is important for having well-formed stools,” Barten said.\n\nEvidence also shows that exercise can improve your bowel movements. “Regular cardiovascular exercise improves nervous system regulation and movement literally helps things move better — our joints, our muscles and our bowels,” Barten said. The CDC suggests getting 150 minutes of exercise each week, but even small bursts of activity, like going on a short stroll, can boost your gut health.\n\nHealth: Experts Say ‘Upwards Of 60% Of The World’ Lacks This 1 Vitamin — And It Increases Your Risk Of Getting Sick\n\nFinally, prioritize your sleep (aim for seven to eight hours of shut-eye each night) and do your best to manage your stress. “Our gut is our emotional center,” Barten said.\n\nThere’s a strong mind-gut connection that significantly impacts gut motility. Barten’s advice? Don’t skimp out on self-care. Carve out some time, every day if you can, to relax and do the things you love. “It’s essential to achieve satisfying bowel movements,” she said.\n\nIf Your Poop Looks Like This, It's Time To See A Doctor\n\nTikTok Claims Pooping With Your Hair Down Can Cause Breakouts.

    "description": "Carly Martinetti shares her approach to prioritizing mental health, remote work, and flexible scheduling.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Carly Martinetti, 35, who is based in Boston. She is cofounder of Notably, a fully remote boutique PR firm. The following has been edited for brevity and clarity.\n\nI used to have really bad panic disorder, to the point where I would have attacks multiple times a day. I don't even know how it was functioning, honestly. I was so ashamed. I felt like there was something wrong with me.\n\nAt my prior agencies, I don't feel that I would have been penalized per se, had I said something. But I also wouldn't have been comfortable enough because there was no one setting that example for me. That has carved out who I want to be as a leader.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the work is very important. I want to do great work. I'm a type A; I need to do well, but I also want to be realistic that if you're struggling, that takes priority.\n\nYou can't do your best work if you are not doing well mentally or physically. My work, at times, had suffered because I wasn't honest with myself about needing to take some time off when I really should have. It would have been vastly improved had I just said, \"Carly, there's nothing wrong with you. You've got a problem. You're working on it. Take a day, God forbid.\" It gave me clarity about not wanting others to go through that.\n\nThere needs to be an emphasis on work-life balance. I make a big point that I've had issues with anxiety disorders. I want you to be able to come to me if you're having a stressful situation.\n\nWhen you are working in a high-intensity industry like this one, you need to be on, but some days you're not. Setting that example is important to me — to be able to show that I'm not going to be mad if you need to take a mental health day, or step out for a little bit and lie down.\n\nI don't know if that attracts a certain type of person, but all the people who work with me are open about things they're going through in their lives. It's helpful because then I can set the tone for the day in my mind. I'll tell people, \"Hey, I know you have this big thing coming up personally, take the day off.\"\n\nI'm not saying this to toot my own horn, but it does make a better agency environment, which is known for that churn-'em-and-burn-'em mentality.\n\nWhen I was working at my last agency, before the pandemic, it was remote. That worked well for me. You can set it up so that you can be functional with a team across the country, collaborate appropriately, and get clients from wherever they may be. It felt like a no-brainer. I had worked in an office. I spent an hour plus of my day commuting. It felt like such a waste. So if there was a better way, why not take it?\n\nWe still travel, but quarterly, I would say. The vast majority of the time, we're on Zoom. We're also on Slack all the time, so I feel like I see people. We have that camaraderie. Getting together with colleagues, it's like we're continuing conversations versus, \"I haven't seen you in forever. What's new?\"\n\nWhen new people start, it's a shock to the system. I had one woman who came to me from a larger agency. She was so worried about not doing enough. She was telling me every move she was making. She was like, \"This is how I had to be at my last agency.\" She was remote there, too.\n\nI said, \"I appreciate it, but I prefer to just see the work in progress. If you need me, come to me, but I don't need to know every move you're making just because we're virtual.\"\n\nOne person at our firm is a single mom with two young kids. She needs a little bit more time away from her desk to help them. That's a very anxiety-inducing thing. She knows we're fine with her having to run out or grab them at day care and do what she needs to.\n\n\"It's PR, not ER,\" is the saying we use.\n\nMaybe you spend a little bit more time on a Friday getting something done than you would have had you not stepped out on a Thursday to do what you needed to do personally.\n\nThat give-and-take is evident. I've never had to talk to someone about taking too much time and then not doing what they needed to do for work.\n\nDo you have a story to share about your career?

    "fullText": "MADISON, Wis. (AP) — A Wisconsin woman who almost killed her sixth-grade classmate to please the fictional horror villain known as Slender Man was ordered back to a state psychiatric hospital Tuesday after she escaped from her group home last month.\n\nWaukesha County Circuit Judge K. Scott Wagner granted a state Department of Health Services request to revoke 23-year-old Morgan Geyser’s release privileges. Geyser told the judge through her attorney, Tony Cotton, last week that she would not fight revocation. Wagner then approved the request during a short hearing.\n\nCotton didn't immediately respond to an email message seeking comment.\n\nGeyser and her friend Anissa Weier lured their classmate, Payton Leutner, to a Waukesha park in 2014. Geyser stabbed Leutner 19 times while Weier cheered her on. A passing bicyclist discovered Leutner, who barely survived. All three girls were 12 years old at the time.\n\nGeyser and Weier later told investigators they attacked Leutner in hopes of impressing Slender Man enough that he would make them his servants and wouldn't hurt their families. Both of them were eventually committed to the Winnebago Mental Health Institute — Geyser for 40 years and Weier for 25 years.\n\nWeier earned conditional release in 2021. Wagner granted Geyser conditional release this past September despite warnings from state Department of Health Services officials that she couldn't be trusted.\n\nGeyser was placed in a Madison group home. Authorities say that on Nov. 22 she cut off her GPS monitor and fled the state with a 43-year-old companion. Police arrested both of them the next day at a truck stop outside Chicago, about 170 miles (274 kilometers) south of Madison.\n\nGeyser's companion told WKOW-TV that the two of them became friends at church and had been seeing each other daily for the last month. Geyser decided to escape because she was afraid the group home would no longer allow them to see each other, the companion said.\n\nSlender Man was created online by Eric Knudsen in 2009 as a mysterious figure photo-edited into everyday images of children at play. He grew into a popular boogeyman, appearing in video games, online stories and a 2018 movie.",

    "fullText": "A 25-year-old startup founder said he starts each day with a nutrient-packed protein smoothie.\n\nMax Marchione is the cofounder of Superpower, a personalized health testing app that raised $30 million in funding earlier this year, backed by celebritiess like Steve Aoki and Logan Paul.\n\n\"Health is becoming a status symbol,\" Marchione told Business Insider. \"Twenty-somethings talking about their biomarkers, it would not have happened three years ago, but that is the defining young culture nowadays.\"\n\nRunning the company is no easy feat: Marchione works seven days a week, putting in more than 12 hours a day.\n\nThat means his self-care routine is precisely dialed in.\n\nMarchione says he has always taken an unconventional, even contrarian approach, exploring beyond what mainstream medicine recommends.\n\nAs a teen, he was an early adopter of fitness wearables like the Oura ring, and got into blue-light-blocking glasses and mouth taping — trends that, despite some mixed evidence, have become incredibly popular in wellness today.\n\nHe's also a big fan of peptide injections, such as the \"Wolverine shot,\" a compound called BPC-157. It is not FDA-approved. He began taking it in the hopes of accelerating his recovery after suffering a soccer injury.\n\nBut one constant in his health routine is much simpler: a daily smoothie.\n\nAs his first meal of the day, it packs in 50 grams of protein and 20 grams of fiber in 400 total calories.\n\nThe recipe includes fruit rich in antioxidants, plant-based compounds that research suggests help mitigate the cellular damage of aging. It also helps him get enough fiber, a crucial nutrient for gut health. Fiber helps nourish the microbiome in a way that may help prevent illnesses like heart disease and cancer as we age.\n\nCombined with protein (the primary building block for muscle), fiber helps improve fullness after eating and supports balanced blood sugar.\n\nMarchione's full \"smoothie stack,\" which he published on his website for other people to try, includes ingredients for gut health and energy, like:\n\nThis is a very high protein smoothie. The sweet spot for total daily protein intake to build muscle is about 0.7 grams per pound of body weight daily, studies suggest. For a 140-pound person, a single serving of Marchione's smoothie would be more than half the recommended amount in that range.\n\nIf he's loading up on extra protein in the smoothie, he adds digestive enzymes to make the protein easier to absorb.\n\n\"I find that if I don't do this, I have brain fog from too much protein at once,\" he wrote on his website.",

    "description": "At 70, a woman with serious health problems joined a gym after her daughter's warning and lost 70 pounds, reversed conditions, and rebuilt her strength.",
    "fullText": "This story is based on a conversation with Joan MacDonald, 79, a former driving examiner of Collingwood, Ontario. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nJanuary 2017 was a New Year I'll never forget. It was one of the few times that my daughter, Michelle MacDonald, lost her cool with me.\n\nShe'd moved to Mexico the previous month and was visiting. \"I won't get to see you as often as I like,\" she said. \"And, every time I leave, I won't know whether it will be the last time I see you.\"\n\nThen she made another blunt comment that changed my life. \"Mom, why don't you go to the gym?\" she said.\n\nI had high blood pressure, kidney problems, and was at least 70 pounds overweight. Approaching my 71st birthday that March, I felt scared and miserable.\n\nMy doctor had already warned me that, if I didn't make an effort to improve my health, I would end up on dialysis before very long. I was effectively dying.\n\nGrowing up in Canada, I'd been an active child. I played ball, skated in the winter, and went bowling. I enjoyed doing them because they were fun. But I was by no means an athlete.\n\nI got married a month before my 21st birthday and settled into married life while working as a driving examiner. I juggled work with motherhood, raising Michelle and her older and younger brothers.\n\nGoing to the gym really wasn't a thing back then. None of my married friends worked out, or even thought about doing so.\n\nI believe that your body changes every seven years or so. I went through variations in terms of shape and size, and enjoyed certain foods, then went off them.\n\nI didn't have regular meals, often eating just two meals a day at irregular times. In between, I'd snack.\n\nThroughout my 60s, I was in poor health. I'd get bronchitis in the fall and spring — I had weaker lungs after contracting rheumatic fever as a child — and the kidney issues began.\n\nThe weight had grown to 200 pounds, which was far too heavy for my height of 5 feet 3 inches. And my blood pressure was high; I was put on medication.\n\nI'm lucky because Michelle is a certified strength and conditioning specialist and sports nutrition coach. She saw how unhealthy I'd become and was worried, especially because she'd moved thousands of miles away and couldn't keep an eye on me.\n\nHer recommendation struck home. It was enough to jolt me into action. My doctor also encouraged me to lose weight and reduce my blood pressure.\n\nI'd half-heartedly attended the gym before, but not consistently. This time, I went five times a week.\n\nI sought advice from Michelle and studied YouTube videos to learn how to use the machines and do strength training with free weights. At first, I couldn't believe how hard it was to pick up 20 pounds.\n\nI began with small weights and increased them by increments. I've since done a deadlift of 170 pounds and a hip thrust of 230 pounds.\n\nIt was amazing to see my body slim down and fit into clothes, like jeans, that I hadn't worn in a very long time.\n\nI lost 45 pounds in six months and a further 25 pounds during the rest of my 70s. I've gone from a size XL to a medium. I was able to quit my medications.\n\nMy current regimen involves spending two hours at the gym, with around 15 minutes of cardio, followed by using weights. I often work out with Michelle, whom I joined in Mexico for around a year after my husband died.\n\nAs for my diet, I eat five small meals a day, including oatmeal with egg whites, protein powder, and 1% coconut milk for breakfast.\n\nThen I'll have yogurt, an egg white omelette with ground beef, chicken, turkey, and ham, a protein bar, and a final, plain meal without starches. If I start my day at 7 am, I'll stop eating by 7 pm.\n\nUnfortunately, I suffered a shoulder injury while biking outside on a rough surface and needed surgery three months ago. I've had to take things a bit easier as I recover. However, I feel 100% happier and healthier than I did before going to the gym.\n\nMichelle and I established \"Train With Joan\" to help inspire people to take up exercise, regardless of their age.\n\nIt may slow you down a bit, but I've seen many seniors, even older than me, accomplish great things. They have resolved to do it for themselves. Nobody else is living in your body but you.",

    "fullText": "Like many of his US counterparts, the Russian science prodigy turned hugely successful ‘digital populist’ has a deep suspicion of government constraint\n\nTech visionary, Kremlin dissident, FSB agent, free speech absolutist, health guru. These are just some of the labels admirers and critics have attached to Pavel Durov over the past decade.\n\nThe Russian-born tech entrepreneur founded Russia’s version of Facebook before going on to create the messaging app Telegram, launch a cryptocurrency ecosystem and amass a multibillion-dollar fortune, all while clashing repeatedly with authorities in Russia and beyond.\n\nBut much of Durov’s real story – and the logic that drives him – remains obscured.\n\nA new biography aims to change that.\n\nThe Populist, by the independent Russian writer Nikolay Kononov, traces the 41-year-old’s rise from a St Petersburg schoolboy science prodigy to the founder of Telegram, one of the world’s most influential communications platforms, which has more than a billion users.\n\nKononov describes the book as the product of a 14-year attempt to map Durov’s strategy and mindset, drawing on conversations with Durov himself and people who worked with him, as well as rivals and critics.\n\nThe book’s title, he said, refers to a thread running through Durov’s life: his desire to address Telegram’s millions of users directly, allowing him to bypass institutions, the press and any system of representation.\n\n“Durov is one of the first digital populists,” Kononov said in an interview, explaining that “from the very beginning, as soon as he started making his digital products, he programmed into them the ability to write and communicate his ideas directly to his audience.”.\n\nBoth VKontakte, Durov’s first venture, and Telegram have at times pushed messages from Durov directly to all users, including users who had not opted in, outlining his libertarian worldview.\n\n“He sees himself as a visionary. And obviously wants to be heard,” the author said.\n\nThat strategy has helped promote Durov’s central promise – almost absolute freedom of expression – even as Telegram has become a go-to tool for dissidents, extremists, scammers and war propagandists.\n\nIf Durov’s public brand is built on libertarianism, Kononov says his private management style points in the opposite direction: power concentrated in one man’s hands, with few visible checks.\n\n“He is essentially the only one making all the product decisions at Telegram,” Kononov said. “Marketing, PR – it’s a one-man show.”\n\nThe portrait he draws is of a tech founder whose worldview has not wavered over the years, remaining most comfortable within an ultra-libertarian, anti-institutional strand of the right that is often misogynistic and, at times, conspiratorial.\n\n“What surprised me most is that Durov hasn’t changed or evolved in all the years that I have interviewed him,” Kononov said.\n\nDurov is not an outlier, Kononov writes, but part of a broader new wave of moguls – most visibly in the US – who pair technological dominance with an outsized sense of personal mythology and a deep suspicion of government constraint.\n\nLike Elon Musk, Peter Thiel and Jeff Bezos, he has shown a strong interest in longevity science as well as pronatalism, the belief that having as many children as possible is a social or civilisational duty.\n\nDurov does not drink or use drugs, Kononov says, regularly dispenses spartan health advice – often alongside photos of him shirtless – and has said he has fathered dozens of children through sperm donation.\n\nOne of the book’s most striking sections tells for the first time of Durov’s tense early meeting with President Vladimir Putin in 2014, held behind closed doors.\n\nKononov writes that Durov described the encounter as a one-way conversation, in which the Kremlin leader reprimanded him over illegal content on Vkontakte and suggested that Durov leave the country.\n\nUnder pressure from the authorities, Durov sold his stake in Vkontakte, left Russia and eventually settled in Dubai, where he founded Telegram.\n\nBut the clearest mark on Durov in recent years, Kononov suggests, came not from Russia but from France.\n\nDurov, who also holds French citizenship, was detained and held for three days in France in August last year as part of an investigation into crimes linked to Telegram, including the circulation of child sexual abuse images, drug trafficking and fraudulent transactions.\n\nHis detention came as a shock to the tech mogul. In interviews conducted in Paris after his arrest, Durov described to Kononov a harsh, disorienting ordeal – a permanently lit cell and little sleep – that rattled a man who had spent years insulating himself from the reach of the state.\n\nIt also appears to have sharpened his hostility towards the west. Kononov says Durov now frames Europe as sliding toward “total digital control”, and increasingly conspiratorial rhetoric.\n\nMost recently, Durov appeared to endorse a conspiracy theory promoted by the far-right blogger Candace Owens, suggesting that Paris was behind the killing of Charlie Kirk.\n\n“What interests me about Durov is that, on the one hand, he clearly has a very high IQ,” Kononov said. “But at the same time, he is prone to conspiracy theories.”\n\nKononov is adamant, however, that Durov’s views should not be conflated with formal political allegiances.\n\nOne of the most persistent claims surrounding Durov is that he is secretly aligned with Russian security services.\n\nBut Kononov said that in the course of his research, he found no evidence that Durov has worked with, or on behalf of, the Russian state. “He has a huge number of flaws – but not the sin of Telegram acting as a backdoor for the FSB,” Kononov said.\n\nKononov argues that what Durov has ultimately learned is the need to compromise – with both Russian and western authorities – when it serves his interests and allows Telegram to continue operating.\n\nKononov recalls Durov once telling him: “I never waste time on things that are unnecessary or that cannot be useful to me personally.” That self-serving mindset, Kononov said, ultimately ended their personal relationship.\n\nAbout a year ago, the writer asked Durov whether he saw a contradiction between Telegram’s highly centralised, almost authoritarian internal structure and his professed devotion to freedom of expression. After that, Durov stopped responding.\n\n“He quickly realised it wasn’t going to be a book to his liking,” Kononov said.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe San Francisco 49ers are one of the NFL's most successful franchises, but they've also been one of the unluckiest.\n\nSan Francisco's 2025 NFL season has continued an alarming trend of years in which the roster was greatly impacted by injuries. Quarterback Brock Purdy and tight end George Kittle went down with injuries in Week 1, causing each to miss time before the franchise returned to the Bay for its home opener.\n\nOther key players to miss time include wide receivers Ricky Pearsall and Jauan Jennings, while star linebacker Fred Warner was carted off the field in Week 6.\n\nHere is a closer look at the 49ers' injuries, how the team has been impacted in comparison to other NFL franchises and a year-by-year timeline of absences to key players.\n\nMORE: Ranking the 18 greatest 49ers players ever\n\nThe 49ers have been one of the NFL's most injured teams for several years running.\n\nSan Francisco has been a top-10 most-injured team in six of seven seasons between 2018 and 2024, with the lone exception being the 2023 season. In 2023, a healthier 49ers squad advanced to play in Super Bowl 57.\n\n49ers health by season:\n\n2024: #1 most injured\n2023: #29 most injured ◄ 12-5, lost SB\n2022: #9 most injured ◄ 13-4, lost NFCCG\n2021: #3 most injured\n2020: #1 most injured\n2019: #6 most injured ◄ 13-3, lost SB\n2018: #4 most injured https://t.co/VV3IiQ1Qjn\n\n— Warren Sharp (@SharpFootball) August 7, 2025\n\nMORE: Who is on the Mount Rushmore of Bay Area sports?\n\nQB Brock Purdy suffers toe, shoulder injuries in Week 1\n\nTE George Kittle placed on four-week IR with hamstring injury\n\nDE Nick Bosa placed on season-ending IR with torn ACL\n\nLB Fred Warner suffers season-ending ankle injuries in Week 6\n\nWR Jauan Jennings playing with broken ribs, multiple ankle sprains\n\nDE Bryce Huff suffers hamstring injury in Week 7\n\nWR Ricky Pearsall misses time with knee injury\n\nTE George Kittle ruled out in Week 16 with ankle injury\n\nInjuries impacted the 49ers before the season began and continued to impact the team as it got underway. WR Brandon Aiyuk and S Malik Mustapha both began the 2025 season on the PUP list with serious knee injuries, and they were joined on the sidelines by other key players along the way.\n\nQB Brock Purdy and TE George Kittle both sustained injuries in Week 1, with Purdy missing multiple games and Kittle being placed on IR. In Week 3, DE Nick Bosa suffered a season-ending torn ACL. Two key wide receivers, Jauan Jennings and Ricky Pearsall, also missed multiple games early in the season, and Pearsall's absences lingered into the final few weeks of the season.\n\nIn Week 6, veteran linebacker Fred Warner had to be carted off the field in an air cast in a game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He will miss the remainder of the season with a broken and dislocated right ankle.\n\nIn the same week, after the loss, wide receiver Jauan Jennings told the media that he is playing with not only broken ribs, but also both high and low ankle sprains.\n\nIn Week 16, Kittle also exited with an ankle injury, not long after San Francisco had already secured a playoff berth.\n\nMORE:George Kittle plans to leave NFL for WWE when 'it hurts to put pants on in the morning'\n\nRB Christian McCaffery: 13 games missed\n\nWR Brandon Aiyuk: 10 games missed\n\nP Mitch Wishnowsky: 8 games missed\n\nOT Trent Williams: 6 games misssed\n\nRB Jordan Mason: 5 games missed\n\nRunning back Christian McCaffrey's Achilles injury was the cloud that loomed large over the 49ers' season in 2024.

Notably, QB Trey Lance was placed on season-ending IR with an ankle injury and was replaced by Jimmy Garoppolo.\n\nGaroppolo suffered an injury in Week 13, paving the way for a rookie Brock Purdy to emerge.

    "fullText": "BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) — Colombia will use drones to resume spraying of coca crops with a weed killer, the government announced on Monday as authorities grapple with record levels of cocaine production that have fueled tensions with the Trump administration.\n\nThe South American country banned aerial fumigation of coca crops in 2015, after the World Health Organization put glyphosate — the weed killer used by spray planes — on a list of carcinogens.\n\nJustice Minister Andrés Idárraga told a news conference that the new action involving high-tech drones was approved by the government and would begin on Thursday.\n\nHe said the drones would be sent to areas where gangs and rebel groups are forcing peasants to grow coca, the primary source of cocaine. “Our security forces will be safer” that way, Idárraga added.\n\nEnvironmental activists had long warned that small airplanes spraying coca fields — often flown by U.S. contractors — were also dumping their chemicals on legal crops and into streams, polluting vulnerable ecosystems and exposing villagers to contaminated water.\n\nAfter suspending aerial fumigation, Colombia stepped up manual eradication campaigns, carried out by soldiers.\n\nBut the cultivation of coca expanded without aerial spraying as it became harder for the military to eradicate coca crops in remote areas, where plantations are defended by drug gangs and rebel groups, and are sometimes surrounded by land mines.\n\nThe United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime estimates that in 2024, as much as 261,000 hectares (about 645,000 acres) in Colombia were planted with coca, almost double what was planted in 2016.\n\nAccording to Idárraga, the drones will fly no further than 1.5 meters (5 feet) from their targets to ensure that water sources and legal crops are not sprayed. A single drone will be able to eradicate about a hectare of coca crops every 30 minutes.\n\n“This is a controlled and efficient” way, Idárraga said, adding that \"it mitigates environmental risks.”\n\nThe idea of using drones to eradicate coca fields was first floated in 2018 by right-wing President Ivan Duque's administration. But plans were delayed due to the lack of a consensus in government agencies and in Colombia's parliament\n\nColombia’s current government, led by left-wing President Gustavo Petro, initially dismissed aerial fumigation and other forced eradication campaigns, saying it didn't want to target impoverished peasants growing coca for drug dealers because they lacked legal alternatives.\n\nPetro's administration became more aggressive on the issue of coca crops this year as it tries to defeat rebel groups funded by the illegal drug trade that have refused to sign peace agreements with the government and that have recently stepped up attacks in Colombian cities.\n\nThe United States has long criticized Colombia’s decision to halt the aerial fumigations. The Trump administration, which has accused Petro’s government of not doing enough to halt cocaine production, added Colombia in September to a list of nations failing to cooperate in the drug war for the first time in almost 30 years, jeopardizing millions of dollars in military and economic cooperation.\n\nIn October, the U.S. also imposed sanctions on Petro, accusing him of allowing “drug cartels to flourish” in the country. More recently, Washington threatened to authorize land strikes against drug traffickers in Colombia.\n\nPetro has vehemently denied the U.S. accusations of not doing enough to target drug traffickers and says Colombian security forces are intercepting record numbers of cocaine shipments, even if the nation is also producing record amounts of the drug.",

    "fullText": "Kate Winslet has a secret to staying sane among the madness of celebrity: motherhood.\n\n\"I was very fortunate because I became a mother when I was really young,\" Winslet said during an appearance on the podcast \"Talk Easy with Sam Fragoso,\" which aired Sunday, December 21. \"I was, you know, blessed to be taking care of this gorgeous little baby,\" she said.\n\nWinslet, 50, had her first child, actor Mia Threapleton, in 2000 when she was 25 years old. She welcomed her eldest son, Joe Anders, 21, in 2003, and her youngest, Bear Blaze Winslet, 12, in 2013.\n\nCaring for her children, two of whom have followed her into the entertainment industry, helped her drown out the outside noise and public scrutiny she has endured over the years, she explained.\n\nWhen the Hollywood star first became \"very famous very quickly,\" after starring alongside Leonardo DiCaprio in the blockbuster \"Titanic\" in 1997, her mental health suffered, she said. Winslet, who is English, said she was bodyshamed and \"actively bullied\" by the British media and that she couldn't \"function like a normal person,\" explaining that she would be followed into everyday places like the grocery store.\n\n\"I found it quite distressing,\" she said.\n\nThe actor and director said it made her \"really self-critical,\" and that there were days when she felt like she \"couldn't face the day,\" but being a mother \"saved\" her.\n\nWinslet is not the only celebrity to cite her kids as a positive force on their mental health. In June, \"Mad Max: Fury Road\" star Charlize Theron, 49, told the \"Call Her Daddy\" podcast that adopting her two daughters in 2012 and 2015 was \"one of the healthiest decisions\" she has ever made. And \"Empire State of Mind\" singer Alicia Keys has said that motherhood has helped her become more introspective and identify unresolved issues.\n\nWinslet has been on a press tour promoting her directorial debut, \"Goodbye June,\" which was released in select US and UK theaters on December 12 and will be on Netflix on December 24. The screenplay was written by her son, Anders.\n\nIn the interview with podcast host Fragoso, Winslet said that \"protecting\" herself creatively has also helped her maintain her mental health while living in the public eye.\n\nSince rising to fame in 1997, she said she has only pursued roles that would make her happy.\n\n\"I had the good sense to know that I loved acting and that somehow the most important thing in terms of opportunity was only to pursue things that I really want to do,\" she said.",

    "fullText": "Content warning: This article contains discussion around suicide and mental health.\n\nRhys Bennett comes bounding into the media room at Manchester United's Carrington training ground bristling with energy, as you would expect of a 22-year-old professional footballer.\n\nTall and confident, lean and physically fit - apart from a knee injury he is trying to recover from so he can complete a loan move to a League One club next month - defender Bennett offers a firm handshake and talks of his developing skill as a DJ.\n\nCaptain of United's last FA Youth Cup-winning team in 2022, Bennett has impressed during a loan stint at Fleetwood.\n\nBut he is not talking about that today.\n\nBennett has serious issues to discuss, which stem from a heartbreaking message he posted on social media on 28 October.\n\n\"Broken, devastated, just don't want to believe it's real,\" he said. \"I love you in this life and the next.\"\n\nThe message was to his father, David, who had taken his own life.\n\nBennett wants to talk about the pain of those left behind, to encourage conversation and plead with those struggling with their mental health to choose a different path to the one his dad took.\n\nDavid, along with the rest of his family, gave his time to help Rhys and daughter Megan, who works in mental health care.\n\n\"He was very hard working,\" says Bennett. \"You grow up, especially as a son, and look up to your father. You want to be like him.\n\n\"He gave me so much along the years, including my resilience and work ethic. The time him, my mum and family invested in me to fulfil my dream is something I'll be forever grateful for. They were always there for me, no matter what.\n\n\"They don't realise how much they're appreciated, and how they affect people. You want to have millions more laughs and cries and whatever it might be. I appreciate everything he's ever done for me.\n\n\"As much as it's a sad situation and the last chapter of his life wasn't a good one, you've still got to celebrate his life and think about the good times.\n\n\"If I could have one more conversation with him it would be to say how grateful I am of him as a person, how much I love him and let him know how much I really appreciate him. You don't know what you've got until it's gone.\"\n\nBennett's reason to talk to BBC Sport is clear. He wants to help. He realises it is quite possible he will never know if an interview has helped a specific individual, but that is not the point.\n\n\"I want to talk about the importance of telling people how you feel, how special it is to be living, to be breathing, to be able to eat, to sleep. You've got to be grateful for what you've got,\" he says.\n\n\"Someone might be feeling a certain way but hopefully this nudges people and they might just check up on a person and ask are they OK.\n\n\"Don't question yourself - just do it. Let the people you're close to know that you're there for them.\"",

He cautiously navigates the steps while gripping tightly onto the railing, taking about 18 seconds to reach the bottom of the short staircase.\n\nPresident Trump exited Air Force One tonight in West Palm Beach. He is headed to Mar-a-Lago.\n. pic.twitter.com/Z4vBY8qobw\n\n— Paul Villarreal (AKA Vince Manfeld) (@AureliusStoic1) December 20, 2025\n\nHe then plops into “The Beast,” the heavily armored presidential car, where he is seen drinking what appears to be a Diet Coke. Trump is spending Christmas at his Mar-a-Lago estate.\n\nCritics online were quick to note the president’s apparent frailty and peculiar leg-slapping.\n\n“Tapping that leg to make sure it works going down,” one X user commented.\n\nAnother wrote, “I wish he concentrated on the economy like he concentrated on going down those stairs.”\n\nOne person hypothesized about his hand motions, “It is not his leg he is touching, but he is trying to get life back into his hand.”\n\nThe elderly president’s supporters defended him, however, with many pointing out that Trump had just wrapped up a long day, including a rally in Rocky Mount, North Carolina.\n\nTrump—who was filmed stumbling on Air Force One’s stairs during a visit to New Jersey in June this year—has frequently spoken about being “very careful” about walking down stairs to avoid the perils of his predecessor, Joe Biden.\n\n“I’m very careful. You know, when I walk downstairs—like I’m on stairs like these stairs—I walk very slowly,“ Trump said while addressing the nation’s top generals in September.\n\nA few days later, he brought up the subject again while taking shots at Biden during a speech to Navy sailors.\n\n“We had a horrible, horrible president who had no clue what the hell was happening. The chances of him walking down those stairs successfully were not good,” he said. “And I have to be careful because one day I’m gonna probably fall.”\n\nThe commander-in-chief then revealed what he apparently tells himself while walking down stairs: “I always say, ‘Walk down the steps nice and slowly.’ You ever notice? I don’t have to bop down the stairs. ‘Walk nice and slowly.’”\n\nQuestions around Trump’s health have dogged him in his second term, particularly after he let slip that he had undergone an MRI scan in October.\n\nThe White House eventually said it was a “preventative” look at his heart and abdomen, a claim met with skepticism from medical experts who stressed that there was “nothing standard” about the scan.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to the White House for comment.",

Many commenters noted that lavish executive lifestyles often come directly at the expense of employees.\n\n“He isn't buying luxury cars despite not paying you and switching you to cheaper insurance,” one person wrote. “He is buying luxury cars because he's not paying you… That is your money.”\n\nAnother commenter summed it up like this: “Record profits are stolen wages.”\n\nPeople shared stories of bosses who slashed hours, removed retirement contributions, and still found ways to upgrade their luxury lifestyles. Several said they were pushed to donate paid time off to terminally ill coworkers while the owners hoarded profits.\n\nOne person recalled, “Two weeks later [after saying he couldn’t afford raises], he bought a fully loaded Rivian R1T in cash.”\n\nSee Also: Missed Tesla? EnergyX Is Tackling the Next $200 Billion Opportunity — Lithium\n\nMany called for unionizing or mass resignations. “Organize a mass quitting. With nobody giving notice,” one person suggested. Another added, “Striking is reasonable, but starting a competing firm with highly motivated team members is even better.”\n\nStill, some felt hopeless, arguing that these issues are systemic. One commenter wrote, “This is 2025 USA in a nutshell.”\n\nWhether or not anything changes for the workers in the original post, the message from the thread is that when employees are asked to sacrifice while their bosses flaunt obscene wealth, it's not just bad optics; it feels like a slap in the face.\n\nRead Next: Wall Street's $12B Real Estate Manager Is Opening Its Doors to Individual Investors — Without the Crowdfunding Middlemen\n\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

    "fullText": "Donovan Metayer was a senior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida when a gunman opened fire and killed 17 people on Valentine’s Day 2018.\n\nA young man who was a “radiant” child according to family and friends, has died.\n\nDonovan Joshua Leigh Metayer, 26, died on Dec. 15 by suicide. Metayer, who survived the 2018 school shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, suffered from mental health episodes following the tragic incident and was diagnosed with schizophrenia. The shooting occurred during Metayer’s senior year, when most students are thinking about college applications and their life after high school.\n\nBut the shooting, which claimed the lives of 17 people, had a profound effect on Metayer and stands as an example of how the trauma of gun violence can linger on for years.\n\nThe youngest child of the Metayer family, Donovan was brilliant from an early age and excelled academically. His humor, according to a GoFundMe page dedicated in his honor, could “light up any room.”\n\nIn the years following the Parkland shooting, Metayer’s dreams of attending college and working in his preferred career field of computer science began to fade. On multiple occasions, he would be hospitalized for suicidal ideation and after one mental health episode in 2021, he was Baker-acted and deemed temporarily unable to purchase a firearm.\n\nYears later, with the help of a private psychiatrist and the Henderson Clinic Metayer began making progress and healing. He’d soon work at Office Depot and earn a promotion and an IT certificate. His mental health journey echoes that of many Black boys across America, masking emotions and not wanting to be seen as a “burden” by family. Treatment, from therapy to medication, may seem like a difficult path thanks to limited resources, social stigmas and more.\n\nHowever, just as Metayer was progressing and gaining more independence according to his family, he soon learned his Risk Protective Order had lapsed.\n\nMetayer then purchased a gun from a gun shop in the area and within a week, he turned the gun on himself.\n\nIn a statement shared on his GoFundMe page, Donovan’s family wrote, ” Donny’s passing is a heartbreaking reminder of the mental health crisis plaguing our youth and the lasting trauma of gun violence on our community. As we grieve his loss, we are breaking the code of silence in his memory. Though Donny’s life was brief, his impact will be everlasting.”\n\nThe family is asking for funds to assist for Metayer’s celebration of life and endow a fund at the Henerson Clinic that will “provide healthcare, housing and hope for people of all ages with behavioral health conditions” throughout the state of Florida.\n\nIf you or someone you know is struggling with mental health challenges, emotional distress, substance use problems, or just needs to talk, call or text 988, or chat at 988lifeline.org 24/7.\n\n‘They beat our brother’: New York community demands justice after video shows police beating a Black man\n\nRay J has restraining order extended following November arrest, faces 6 misdemeanor charges: ‘I’m missing my kids’\n\nDeaths of Missisippi mom Shardee McGill and 3-year-old daughter determined to be murder-suicide",

    "title": "Trump Announces Pricing Deals with Nine Drugmakers",
    "description": "The companies were the latest to agree to sell drugs to Medicaid and directly to consumers at discounted prices. President Trump said he would soon begin similar negotiations with health insurers.",
    "fullText": "President Trump on Friday announced deals with nine pharmaceutical companies to reduce some drug prices, the latest step in his bid to try to align U.S. costs with the lower drug prices in European countries.\n\nMr. Trump has now reached deals with 14 of the 17 drugmakers to which he sent letters in July demanding that they lower prices. The nine companies participating in Friday’s announcement were Amgen, Boehringer Ingelheim, Bristol Myers Squibb, Roche’s Genentech unit, Gilead, GSK, Merck, Novartis and Sanofi.\n\nDrugmakers have been eager to strike deals with the administration in hopes of avoiding punitive regulatory action that could cut deeply into their profits. Over the last few months, Mr. Trump has announced similar agreements with Pfizer, AstraZeneca, EMD Serono, Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk.\n\nIn a White House briefing announcing the deals, Mr. Trump and top health officials framed the agreements as part of a focus on affordability at a time when the administration is facing intense scrutiny for not doing more to stem rising prices.\n\nThe announcements were made as health insurance subsidies in the Obamacare marketplace were set to expire at the end of the year, which will likely to drive up premiums for millions of Americans.\n\nStanding at the podium, the president also took the opportunity to threaten the health insurance industry. Mr. Trump said he would call insurance executives to Florida or the White House soon to discuss lowering premiums.\n\n“They have to make less, a lot less,” he said. Stocks of major insurers, including UnitedHealth Group, CVS and Cigna, fell after Mr. Trump’s remarks.\n\n“Health plans are doing everything in their power to shield Americans from the high and rising costs of medical care, and we welcome any opportunity to discuss common-sense solutions to lower costs for everyone,” said Mike Tuffin, chief executive of AHIP, a major trade group for health insurance plans.\n\nUnder the deals announced on Friday, manufacturers will offer some of their drugs through websites where Americans can bypass insurance and use their own money to buy certain products. The offerings have focused on drugs often prescribed by primary care doctors rather than more specialized, expensive treatments for conditions like cancer.\n\nTo help patients navigate that process, the Trump administration plans to create a site called TrumpRx.gov, which will direct patients to the drugmakers’ own websites. Officials put up a promotional version of the TrumpRx website this fall and said they plan for it to be operational in January.\n\nDrugs that will be made available in this way include Amgen’s Repatha, for lowering cholesterol, at $239 a month; GSK’s asthma inhaler, Advair Diskus, at $89 a month; and Merck’s diabetes medication Januvia, at $100 a month.\n\nMany of these drugs are nearing the end of their patent protection, meaning that the arrival of low-cost generic competition would soon have prompted manufacturers to lower their prices.\n\nIn other cases, the direct-buy offerings are very expensive and out of reach for most Americans.\n\nFor example, Gilead will offer Epclusa, a three-month regimen of pills that cures hepatitis C, for $2,492 a month on the site. Most patients pay far less using insurance or with help from patient assistance programs. Gilead says on its website that “typically a person taking Epclusa pays between $0 and $5 per month” with commercial insurance or Medicare.\n\nThe drugmakers also said they would introduce new medicines in the United States at prices comparable to what they ask other wealthy countries to pay.\n\nAnd the companies agreed to sell most of their products to state Medicaid programs, which provide health insurance for low-income Americans, at the prices they offer to other wealthy countries.\n\nPeople on Medicaid already pay nothing or very little in out-of-pocket costs. Federal law caps those costs at $8 per prescription for people with the lowest incomes.\n\nMedicaid is already legally required to get the lowest drug prices in the United States, which are often comparable to those in European countries.\n\nStill, administration officials said the deals would bring significant savings for some drug purchases. Bristol Myers Squibb said it would provide Eliquis, a widely used blood thinner, to Medicaid for free.\n\nA new, lower price for Medicare of $231 per month, enabled by a Biden-era law, will go into effect in January. Medicaid’s current prices for Eliquis are not public, and Bristol Myers Squibb did not return a request for comment on what it now charges Medicaid programs.\n\n“It’s very likely that Medicaid programs were already getting it for free or close to free,” said Dr. Benjamin Rome, a health policy researcher at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston.\n\nAs he has done while announcing the other drug pricing deals, Mr. Trump on Friday made claims about impossible price decreases of up to 800 percent. At another point, he boasted: “This represents the greatest victory for patient affordability in the history of American health care by far.”\n\nAt least initially, most Americans won’t see changes to their out-of-pocket costs resulting from the deals. In some cases, they could end up paying more if they use their own money to go through TrumpRx when they could have paid less by relying on insurance.\n\n“The bottom line is that the agreements will not decrease prices for most Americans,” said Ameet Sarpatwari, who studies pharmaceutical policy at Harvard Medical School.\n\nExecutives for each of the drugmakers appeared with Mr. Trump and other cabinet officials in the White House’s Roosevelt Room. They arrived long before him, standing awkwardly on live video until his arrival. When Mr. Trump entered the room, he began the event by displaying and touting his new “gold card” — a way for immigrants to obtain visas for $1 million each, plus processing fees.\n\nAfter his initial remarks, the pharmaceutical executives each gave a short speech. Most thanked the president, saying it was an honor to lower their prices.\n\nIn exchange for some lower prices, the companies secured three-year exemptions from any tariffs that Mr. Trump might have imposed on imported pharmaceuticals, administration officials said. Mr. Trump has repeatedly threatened to levy punishing tariffs on imported medicines but has not followed through.\n\nThe three major drugmakers that have yet to reach deals with the administration are AbbVie, Johnson & Johnson and Regeneron. Representatives for those companies all said they were still in talks with the administration.\n\nMr. Trump said that Johnson & Johnson and a few other companies would announce price-cutting deals in the coming days.\n\nIn the United States, prices for brand-name drugs are three times as high, on average, as those in other wealthy nations. Mr. Trump has long complained that the United States is unfairly subsidizing lower prices in European countries, a view echoed by many pharmaceutical executives.\n\nThe deals announced on Friday do not address the high costs of most drugs already on the market that are covered under private insurance or other government health insurance programs like Medicare. Those costs are borne by U.S. employers and consumers who pay in the form of taxes, health insurance premiums and out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nIn his first term, Mr. Trump unsuccessfully tried to use regulation to force drugmakers to lower some Medicare prices to the levels in European countries. A federal court blocked the effort, ruling that the administration had skipped steps in the policymaking process. But had it been carried out, it would have been a major change in how the United States pays for medicines.\n\nOn Friday, the Trump administration posted documents online proposing a very different, and more modest, version of the international price comparison idea.\n\nManufacturers are required to pay a rebate to Medicare when they increase certain prices faster than the rate of inflation. Currently, those rebates are calculated based on drug prices in the United States.\n\nUnder the new proposed rules, called GLOBE and GUARD, the government would test an approach that would instead calculate those rebates based on drug prices in other wealthy countries.\n\nJuliette Cubanski, a Medicare expert at KFF, a nonprofit health policy research group, said such a change could lead to “relatively modest” savings for Medicare. Still, she said, “I’m not sure it represents a substantially more significant threat to drug industry revenues than the existing inflation rebate program does.”\n\nReed Abelson contributed reporting.",

    "description": ": Ofcom survey finds 18-34s increasingly see life online as bad for society and their mental health",
    "fullText": "Young Brits are souring on the internet, with increasing numbers seeing it as damaging to society and their mental health, according to latest research published by Ofcom.\n\nThe UK's communications regulator found that in June 2025, just a third of those aged 18-34 agreed the internet is good for society, down from 42 percent a year earlier. While this fell for older age groups as well, it did so less sharply (34 percent versus 38 percent in 2024), meaning those aged 55 and above are proportionately more positive than younger people about the internet's impact on civilization.\n\nThe research also found that more young adults disagreed the internet helps their mental health than agreed, reversing the previous year's findings. In June 2025, 35 percent of young adults disagreed that being online had a positive overall effect on their emotional wellbeing, while 31 percent agreed. In June 2024, 28 percent disagreed and 39 agreed.\n\nThe questions were part of annual research carried out in the summer by pollster YouGov with 7,340 adults of all ages for Ofcom's Annual Online Nation report.\n\nDespite their increasing negativity, young adults in the UK spend significantly more time online than older age groups, averaging six hours and 20 minutes a day on personal (rather than work) devices, up ten minutes over the prior 12 months and much higher than the four hours and 30 minutes for all adults.\n\nSo why are many of these digital natives, born between Sir Tim Berners-Lee's creation of the first web browser and server in 1990 and Apple's launch of the first iPhone in 2007, losing faith in the internet?\n\nOne reason may be that their online experiences differ significantly from those of their elders, including more material chosen by algorithms than actively selected by users.\n\nA section of the research on potentially harmful online encounters found younger adults were most likely to have experienced these on Instagram, followed by TikTok. Overall, Facebook was the place people were most likely to encounter such material, but the likelihood of this increased with age. Among all young adults, 47 percent of potentially harmful encounters came from scrolling a feed, compared with just 26 percent for 55s and over.\n\nAnother reason may be increasing interest in how the internet can damage young people, even if this tends to focus on those a bit younger than the group in question.\n\nThis year's Ofcom research took place a few months after the March launch of Adolescence, a UK drama about a teenage murder suspect who was radicalized online, which was Netflix's most-watched show worldwide in the first half of this year. It was also shortly before Ofcom started enforcing the UK's Online Safety Act, which attempts to restrict content for those under 16, and Australia attempted to stop the same age group from operating social media accounts.\n\nOfcom did find that young adults are more likely than older groups to manage their internet use by disabling notifications, using Do Not Disturb settings, pausing use of services, and deleting apps.\n\nA fifth felt they did not have a good balance between online and offline, compared with 13 percent of all adults. However, the group was less likely than older adults to report or flag potentially harmful content, with more than half choosing not to act on this type of material, saying they didn't consider it to be serious or harmful enough. ®",

    "description": "After surviving a heart attack and a stroke, taking GLP-1s has helped 47-year-old ShantaQuilette Carter-Williams get her health back on track.",
    "fullText": "Starting a GLP-1 wasn’t really a choice for ShantaQuilette Carter-Williams. “My doctor pretty much gave me an ultimatum and said that if I did not lose the weight, I was probably going to die in the next five years,” she tells Yahoo. That was in 2023, and Carter-Williams had already survived a heart attack and a stroke in her early 40s, and had been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Her doctor prescribed her Ozempic, and Carter-Williams didn’t expect the drug to do much other than control her insulin levels.\n\nBut two years on and 160 pounds lighter, starting the medication has helped to open a new chapter in Carter-Williams’s life. “I became more conscious of how I eat and how I respect my body, and of actually being an active participant in my rescue,” she says. She’s also had a reinvention; the former accountant is now a speaker, content creator, health advocate and comedian. With her doctor's guidance, Carter-Williams weaned herself off of Mounjaro in February 2025. While research shows that some two-thirds of GLP-1 users regain most of the weight they lost within a year, Carter-Williams has, remarkably, been able to maintain her size and improved health. She credits the new habits she's learned and her determination to avoid another stroke or heart attack. But Carter-Williams knows that she may not be able to maintain her weight on her own forever. \"If I need to go back on the medication, I will,\" she says. \"I hope that I don't have to do that, but I'm not embarrassed to if it's necessary.\"\n\nIn this installment of On My Weigh, Carter-Williams explains in her own words how taking a GLP-1 helped her turn her health around and learn that “to truly love yourself is to take care of yourself inside and out.”\n\nName: ShantaQuilette Carter-Williams\n\nThe method: Ozempic, 12.5 milligrams from February 2022 until October 2023, then Mounjaro, 15 milligrams until weaning off of GLP-1s in February 2025\n\nThe goal: I had had a heart attack and stroke, and I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, as well as being obese. My doctor did not think that was in my best interest. So she put me on Ozempic to regulate my insulin but said it could also help me lose weight.\n\nProgress report: The medication put me in remission from my type 2 diabetes. My blood pressure is regulated, I’m down 160 pounds, and here’s the biggest thing: I went to my neurologist a couple of months ago because I’ve had a brain injury, and I’ve been having severe brain fog. So I was like, “Is this perimenopause or am I coming down with dementia?” I got a full blood workup done. When the nurse came to give me my results, she said, “This is the best bloodwork we’ve seen in this office — not just for you, not just for your age or gender — but in this office all year.”\n\nFood noise volume: Scale of 1 to 10? My food noise was a 25. But now I would say my food noise is sometimes maybe a 2.\n\nI wake up between 5 and 7 a.m., and I feel good. I wake up, and I choose me. I am a woman in perimenopause, so the bounce-back after a full day isn’t quite the same as it used to be. But the difference is that I was 160 pounds heavier and getting up and dealing with health issues. I can’t imagine being where I was in terms of my weight and health five years ago, and having to get up in the morning and deal with all the perimenopause symptoms that I am now.\n\nI’m more of a morning person now, but I don’t rush it when I wake up. I allow my nervous system to do what it’s supposed to do. I start the day with my affirmations and a good laugh because it decreases your stress hormone [cortisol] and gives you dopamine. Before, it wasn’t like that, because I was achy, groggy, overweight, tired, not feeling well — all these things. Back then, I could stay in bed until 10 or 11 a.m. just lying there. I realized that wasn’t always good; it was just my body telling me what it can and cannot do.\n\nBefore starting on a GLP-1, if we had fried chicken the night before, I might wake up and eat a piece of fried chicken and some eggs or just whatever was in the fridge. It wasn’t like, “Oh, I’ll have a traditional breakfast.” If I wanted some boudin from New Orleans in the morning, I was gonna have it.\n\nNow, I will start my day with a protein drink or one of the juices that my daughter makes. She and my husband are really good support. Sometimes, I’ll wake up and go to my office with a protein drink and lemon water. Then, my husband will come in with some eggs and potatoes to make sure I eat.\n\nOne thing that ShantaQuilette is going to do is put on some clothes to feel good about herself. She is going to love herself. Any time I was looking in the mirror, I’ve always seen me and felt good. Getting ready is not a luxury to me — it’s a requirement to feel good, and that is the ultimate joy. And it’s about being free. But, after my stroke, there was a time when I had really just let myself go and was going through this big, deep depression.\n\nSince starting a GLP-1, I feel good, like I always did, but there’s something different. It’s a glow, and I think that comes from my mindset and knowing that I’m getting better and not getting worse. But I did go from a size 22 to a size 4. For a while, I was still trying to buy my clothes too big, like, OK, I don't know my size. I hung onto my old clothes for a while, in case I got big again. But I realized, that’s not the mindset. I told myself, “Why are you talking about moving backwards when you’re going to be moving forward?” Now I feel confident to wear the things I want to.\n\nI went to Fashion Week in February, and I used to frown on those designers like, “Why can’t I wear this in a size 22, I’d still look good?” I’ll still always fight for that because the girl I was will always be there. But it feels good to know that I can actually buy something that’s on the runway.\n\nThese days, I love Pilates, my walking pad and calisthenics. But the truth of the matter is that, due to my heart condition and age, I’m now more limited in some of the exercises that I can do than I once was. I used to love lifting heavy weights, but because I’ve had a stroke and other health issues, I can’t do those things.\n\nSo, a couple of times a week, I get up and go for a walk outside, first thing. I have a weighted hula hoop. It’s so important that we all get at least three days of exercise a week, at least 45 minutes each day, especially when you’re at an age when osteoporosis starts. It makes for a better quality of life. Like getting ready, exercise is not a luxury, it’s a requirement.\n\nBefore: Give me some Popeyes, give me some Williams Chicken, some fried chicken fried in the hardest, hottest grease. Now, I’m not strict with myself, but I try not to eat stuff that’s really bad, and I do try to limit my sugar to 25 milligrams a day, and I’m conscious of my sodium levels.\n\nNow, I love to level up on my fruits and veggies. I enjoy eating what I want to eat, but I do it in a healthier way. I often have a sandwich or a salad for lunch. I love to have cucumber and pineapple mixed together with some low-sodium Tajin on them, or a good tomato and cucumber salad.\n\nI stopped taking Mounjaro in February of 2025, because even when my doctor and I tried to stretch the time between doses and I was on a lower maintenance dose, I was still losing weight. I didn’t want to lose any more weight because I got to a point where I was like, “I’m going to be invisible in a minute.” But when I was taking a GLP-1, I didn’t really even think about it. When it was weekly, I’d take my GLP-1 shot every Tuesday or every Thursday. But I was pretty inconsistent with the days, and sometimes I’d take it in the morning, and sometimes in the evening.\n\nI stopped drinking long before I got on a GLP-1, just as a protocol for better health. When I started losing weight, I encouraged a lot of my friends to think about doing a GLP-1. At first, a lot of them were like, “I’m not doing that, it’s gonna make you blind, it’s gonna make you dead.” Well, that’s where I was on my way to if I didn’t try Ozempic. I got some encouragement sharing my story online, and it was great seeing that I was inspiring other people to be the CEOs of their own health. But at times I felt hurt or misunderstood. Not one person ever walked up to me and said, “Girl, you look like you’re getting too big.” But as soon as I lost weight, people were like, “Oh my God, don’t lose any more.” Well, you’d never tell me to raw-dog my heart condition, or my pancreas, and not take insulin.\n\nBut I also decided I would start doing things that I had never done. In 2023, I went on a retreat in Costa Rica. I was able to canyon 300 feet down the side of a cliff; I went white-water rafting and ziplining (I would never do that again, but I did it). I did all of these things that I didn’t have the strength or courage to do before because I didn’t think I was in good enough shape. I’m glad I got those things off my bucket list. And really just being able to enjoy life and people. My happy hour is that this experience gave me purpose. And I realized that purpose is not what you do, it’s who you do it for. I want to live, I want to be better, I want to be here for my grandchildren. And I’m sharing my story because my testimony is for someone else, so they can change their lives as well.\n\nIn my family, food is fellowship. Food has always brought me joy, but it got to the point where I was not able to control it and control my weight. With a GLP-1, my appetite is suppressed, so I’m able to enjoy it in moderation.\n\nNow, my husband, daughter (who lives with us) and I are very conscious of eating the things we enjoy, but doing it in a healthier way. So, if we’re eating spaghetti, we use ground turkey instead of beef. When we have stuffed bell peppers, we use ground chicken. The other night, my daughter made hot honey lemon salmon with broccoli, zucchini and cilantro lime brown rice. She makes really good fried and baked chicken, and she makes sure to make smaller pieces for me.\n\nMy daughter does a really good job of meal prepping and making juices. My husband does his best, but he has a sweet tooth. But everybody in my life is a part of this process. I’ve come to realize how my choices affect my family. They don’t want to see me sick; they don’t want to see me die. They don’t want to see me die. If I’m not here, that’s trauma that they have to deal with too. So they keep me accountable, and we are all active participants in my rescue.\n\nBefore I got on Ozempic, my doctor had tried to put me on Wegovy or Saxenda. It was going to be $1,600 a month. I was like, “I’m gonna die because I can’t afford that.” It’s hard to be in a country where we should all have free health care, and things like Ozempic should be like a bottle of Tylenol. Finally, when I found out I had type 2 diabetes, I was able to get Ozempic, and then Mounjaro, for $25 a month. But it’s so sad that so many people need these medications, and the only thing that’s holding them back is money.\n\nWhen it comes to food expenses, we all know it is cheaper to go get a cheeseburger at McDonald’s than it is to go to Whole Foods and get a salad. But you have to decide what you want and budget for it. We don't want to keep people sick, and the best way to be healthy is to eat healthy. I think we fail because we try to go big. It doesn’t have to be the fanciest salad. So just buy some lettuce and tomatoes and make some lemon and olive oil dressing and start there.\n\nThis has been edited for length and clarity.",

    "fullText": "A major international criminal vape shipment recently went up in smoke, due to the efforts of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials located near Chicago O'Hare International Airport.\n\nThe agency announced the bust in a press release and revealed the confiscated goods were worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. An inspection of a delivery from China en route to Mississippi uncovered 43,200 unlisted components of Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS).\n\nMembers of the CBP and FDA at Chicago's Central Examination Station assessed that the goods both lacked proper FDA marketing permissions and were improperly valued. The criminals involved were trying to sneak in contraband and avoid paying taxes on it.\n\nOfficials identified the ENDS pieces as Kangvape Onee Sticks and valued the shipment at a whopping $358,000. That, of course, will not be cashed in by the parties in Mississippi, as the merchandise instead heads to the CBP's Fines, Penalties, and Forfeiture office.\n\n\"Our officers are dedicated to identifying and intercepting these types of shipments which could potentially harm the health and well-being of people within our communities,\" said LaFonda D. Sutton-Burke, the office's director of field operations.\n\nSutton-Burke is on the money. The vaping industry is linked to negative health impacts, particularly among young people whom the products often target. Getting them hooked on tobacco comes with severe long-term risks.\n\nMeanwhile, vapes are a menace to the environment due to their mishmash of components. The improper disposal of single-use plastics, toxic e-waste, and lithium batteries they are composed of poses a major challenge.\n\nWhen tossed out into nature, they can leach dangerous chemicals, be a hazard to tires and machinery, and be ingested by animals. When placed in trash or recycling bins, they pose a serious fire risk at landfills or recycling facilities.\n\nThere is encouraging news in the U.S., as increased education and awareness of vaping's health risks seem to be resonating among teenagers and reducing their use. Still, experts are worried about the impact of potential funding cuts.\n\nUndoubtedly, keeping illegal products off the streets, as the CBP did here, is another way to combat vaping.\n\nDo you think the U.S. should tax goods from China?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nAfter the latest seizure, the CBP remained steadfast in its mission to catch other would-be offenders.\n\n\"We will continue to work with our consumer product safety partners to identify and seize unsafe and illicit goods,\" Sutton-Burke concluded.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",
