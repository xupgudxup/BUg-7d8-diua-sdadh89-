    "title": "‘Tragedy in the making’: Top healthcare exec on why insurance will spike to subsidize a tax cut to millionaires and billionaires",
    "description": "\"If the two sides could talk,\" said UConn Health chair John Driscoll, \"there probably is a way that they could agree on how to to bridge the difference.\"",
    "fullText": "Top healthcare executive John Driscoll calls the looming expiration of enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies “a tragedy in the making,” warning that millions of Americans are about to be hit with higher premiums, lost coverage, and rising medical debt as Washington gridlock hardens.\n\nDriscoll, who is currently the chairman of UConn Health after a 25-year career in health care including a previous position as Walgreens Boots Alliance president, said the policy reversal amounts to “a self‑inflicted wound” that will push costs up for both low‑income families and the affluent professionals who thought they were insulated.​\n\nDriscoll cited CBO estimates that if Congress allows the subsidies to lapse, premiums will jump for roughly 24 million marketplace enrollees, and around 2 million people will lose coverage entirely in the near term.\n\n“You don’t solve higher health care costs with fewer people getting insured,” he told Fortune, arguing that the system will simply reprice risk and shift costs onto everyone else. “Whenever you reduce coverage at the bottom, everybody pays \n\nEnhanced premium tax credits, introduced during the pandemic and extended through 2025, have helped double marketplace enrollment and kept average subsidized premiums under about $900 a year. When they expire, KFF News projects a roughly 114% increase in average premium payments for subsidized enrollees in 2026. Older adults and rural residents would be especially exposed, with KFF also warning that adults ages 50 to 64 could see average premium hikes of 75% or more.​\n\nDriscoll argued that the real story is a giant cost shift from government to households and employers, driven by simultaneous Medicaid cuts, work requirements, and subsidy rollbacks. When people lose coverage, he notes, they “don’t stop getting covered by the health care system.” Instead, they show up later and sicker, so hospitals and insurers respond by raising prices to anticipate uncompensated care.\n\nWhen you consider that this is being done to “effectively subsidize a tax deduction for millionaires and billionaires, that’s going to shift health care costs to all of us when people lose coverage,” he added, referring to the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that extended President Donald Trump’s previous tax cuts and introduced new ones.\n\nFor Driscoll, the subsidy cliff exposes a deeper “tribal dysfunction” in health policy that has frozen the Affordable Care Act in place instead of improving it. He called Obamacare “a very good but imperfect solution” that cut the uninsured rate roughly in half and slowed healthcare inflation, but he said both parties have refused to engage in the hard work of updating it. “We really aren’t prioritizing the patient,” he said, “we’re prioritizing the politics,” leaving millions facing the choice of dropping coverage or postponing care for serious conditions.\n\n​​He had a warning for Republicans, calling this looming mass expiration of health insurance subsidies a “self-inflicted wound” for the party. “They were elected on solving affordability,” he pointed out, and now they’re going to accelerate the problem. But Driscoll said no side is blameless. “The tragic thing is, neither side really wants to have a sensible conversation about how do you really care for more people and get them better care earlier.”\n\nIt’s true that Democrats drove the ACA, but Driscoll said that by and large they are committed to defending something that was itself a compromise, and the other side is playing offense. “The danger is that some Democrats don’t want to have a conversation on evolving [the ACA] because they feel like they have to defend it and the Republicans don’t ever don’t want to have a conversation about evolving it because they want to destroy it.” The result is you end up here, in “this sort of ridiculous no progress zone.” (Driscoll did disclose that he is serving as Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont’s special advisor on health care.)\n\nFrom his vantage point now, Driscoll argued that the reason America is bedevilled with constant healthcare issues is a mismatch of incentives. “Healthcare is a team sport that keeps getting undermined by individual incentives,” he said, noting that U.S. costs are twice as expensive as the average industrialized country and not nearly as productive, he pointed out.\n\nIn similar countries, roughly 50%-60% of doctors are primary care, but it’s only one in four in the U.S. The problem is that every doctor wants to be a specialist or a surgeon because they’ll roughly double the salary of a pediatrician or internist that way. “Until you change those incentives people are going to keep going towards those higher compensated areas.”\n\nThere’s no one fix to this, but there are steps we could take, Driscoll said. He pointed to expanded drug‑price negotiation, immigration reforms to ease shortages of primary‑care doctors and nurses, “site‑neutral” payment so patients aren’t charged more for identical hospital‑based care, and broader use of value‑based and bundled payment models. But we don’t even seem to be capable of engagement, he argued.\n\n“If the two sides could talk,” Driscoll said, “there probably is a way that they could agree on how to to bridge the difference between what Biden and Trump want to do on drug costs. If we could talk, we could probably agree on how to bring back value-based care that would balance the interests of doctors and hospitals and and patients’ outcomes and the government’s obligation.” If only.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

    "title": "I Tracked My Health With Whoop, and This Is What I Liked (and What I Ignored)",
    "description": "The last six weeks have taught me that hydration is more important than I realized, and opened my eyes to how much shut-eye I actually need.",
    "fullText": "When I reviewed the Whoop 5.0 and MG (and, earlier, the Whoop 4.0), I kept it to the basics—how the strap looks, works, and charges, and what activities it can track. But that's only part of it, and today, I’m going to dive in to all the metrics Whoop reports and offer a reality check on what I've found most useful and what isn’t worth paying attention to.\n\n(I'll leave out the activity tracking features here, since I covered them in more depth in the review, but the bottom line is this: I love the way it tracks how hard your workouts are—strength workouts included—but it's not going to replace a true fitness watch for most people.)\n\nI haven't worn the Whoop band as regularly as I do the Oura ring, for which I was able to give a four-year retrospective. But to research both this article and my reviews, I’ve worn the Whoop for a couple of stints of at least a few weeks each, tracking my workouts and sleep regularly. With that said, here's a deeper dive into what it’s actually like to wear the Whoop strap long-term, using it to judge and guide your habits and performance.\n\nLet me take you through a typical day. I’m wearing the Whoop band on either my wrist or upper arm, and it’s probably been a few days since I last charged it. (I get about five days on a charge.) I made sure I had it on when I went to bed. If I look at my Whoop app first thing in the morning, it will sometimes tell me that it’s still “processing” my sleep, and there’s a button I can press to “end sleep” and get my recovery results.\n\nThe Whoop app will show you a survey called your “journal” the first time you open the app each day. I’ll talk more about the journal in a section below. Let’s say you’ve already filled out your journal, and you’re looking at the main app. From the home screen, on a typical day I might see:\n\nMy recovery at the top, color coded. Green is good, and you get that if your recovery is 66% or better. Yellow is OK (34% and up), and red is poor. Today, I have a yellow recovery, at 48%. (For the month of April, I got 19 green recoveries, 9 yellow, 0 red, and on two nights I forgot to wear the strap to bed.)\n\nSome notes about things I should pay attention to. Perhaps my HRV is lower than usual, which might be because of my hard workout yesterday.\n\nThe health monitor, which tells me whether my respiratory rate, blood oxygen, resting heart rate, HRV, and skin temperature are within my normal ranges.\n\nThe stress monitor, which I guess tells me how stressed I am. To be honest, I don’t find this useful.\n\nA \"daily outlook\" button I can press. This starts a conversation with Whoop Coach—more about that in a minute.\n\nToday’s timeline, showing when I slept. As I do other activities, like workouts, they’ll show up here.\n\nRecommendations for tonight’s sleep, including a recommended bedtime.\n\nAfter this, there is a scorecard for my current “plan” (more about that below), and a dashboard with the individual metrics I might care about, like heart rate variability (HRV) and a count of my steps so far today, a feature that’s still in beta.\n\nAlong the top of the screen, I can tap on my scores for Sleep, Recovery, or Strain. The Strain screen is interesting, since it gives a recommended Strain level for the day. It may suggest that I take on a “moderate” level of Strain, and set my target as 8.9 to 12.9. You get most of your Strain from exercise, and a little from everyday activity like walking around. On a morning I haven’t done any workouts or left the house yet, I may be around 2.7 Strain just from sitting around.\n\nLet’s return to that Daily Outlook button. Tap that, and you’ll be launched into a conversation with Whoop Coach, an AI chatbot. This is probably the only AI bot I converse with on the regular, because it does a decent job of explaining the app’s metrics and recommends workouts for the day.\n\nTo use one real example: on a certain day it complimented me on completing a running workout yesterday, and told me my workout schedule had been consistent, with 162 minutes in active heart rate zones so far that week. It then described a few trends in my metrics, including that my resting heart rate had improved over the past few weeks, but that my recovery that day was lower than my usual.\n\nThen comes the fun part. It makes recommendations for workouts to do today, and habits to focus on. It told me to aim for three liters of water that day (that’s a little bit more than my usual) with plenty of fruits and vegetables. And for a workout, I could meet my recommended Strain score with something that is low impact to “support recovery,” since my heart rate and HRV suggested I may need a bit of a rest.\n\nThe Whoop Coach went on to suggest three workouts to choose from, based on the kinds of activities it knows I like to do. They included a 30-minute run, mostly in zones 1 and 2, or an 80-minute weightlifting workout at a low-medium intensity. I can tap a button at the bottom of each workout that says “Commit,” and doing this will add it to my timeline for the day. I can do the workout later by just tapping that button, and it will start the activity timer for me.\n\nI love that it can recommend these workouts for me, since otherwise “get 8.9 Strain” is an inscrutable instruction. Unfortunately, the little graphic showing time in heart rate zones is all you get. I’ve asked the Whoop Coach if it could time me through those intervals, perhaps beeping when it’s time to switch from one zone to another, but it doesn’t have that functionality.\n\nIt does offer a specific workout plan that I could punch into a workout timer app of my choice. In the past, the Whoop Coach has struggled to put together interval workouts that add up to the number of minutes that are supposed to be in the workout; that seems to be improving. But the workout ideas are still pretty generic. I found that the best way to use the coach is to see what it recommends, then use that as a sort of vague guidance if I have flexibility in my training program or my real-life plans for the day. For example, if I have a hard 45-minute running workout planned today, but Whoop thinks I should do something lighter, I might see if I can swap today's run with an easy run that is scheduled for later in the week.\n\nWhoop gives you so many sleep metrics, it can be hard to know where to start. I see two major, useful features here: the report of how long you slept compared to how much sleep you needed, and the smart alarms that you can set in any of a variety of ways.\n\nOn your Sleep tab, you’ll get a score for your sleep “performance,” comparing the amount of sleep you got to the amount it calculates you needed. Today I slept more than I needed, which doesn’t match with how I felt groggily dragging myself out of bed. The timing seems right, though—I was extra tired yesterday so I both got to bed early and slept a little late.\n\nI think it’s a fool’s errand to worry about how “accurate” sleep tracking is, since no wearable is truly accurate, but most of them are good enough. But for a comparison, the total sleep time is usually similar to what Oura reports, and the sleep phases are often more-or-less in the same ballpark. Here’s one example from a day I wore both Oura and Whoop:\n\nTotal sleep matters more than the other numbers, in my book. Increase your total sleep and you’re likely to sleep better. (I have data backing this up from my long-term Oura trends—total sleep correlates closely with other metrics and scores of sleep quality.)\n\nWhoop also tracks your “sleep debt,” or how much sleep you needed but didn’t get. In one example month I had a six nights with a “high” sleep debt of 45 minutes or more. Nine times it was moderate (30 to 45 minutes), and 14 times it was 30 minutes or less.\n\nOne of Whoop’s most intriguing features is the sleep coach, which can advise you when to go to bed, and even help you decide when your alarm should go off. (It’s also one of the most hidden features. Tap on the “tonight’s sleep” card on your overview screen.)\n\nFrom this screen, called the Sleep Planner, you can choose whether you want to “reach my sleep need” (making up any sleep debt, as needed); “improve my sleep,” which will recommend times that help you to be more consistent in your sleep schedule; or “reach my weekly plan goal,” which I’ll say more about below.\n\nAnd then, there’s a second set of preferences. When you try to set an alarm, the app will ask if you’d like to wake up at an exact time, or when you’ve met your sleep goal for the night, or as soon as you’re “in the green.” That last one refers to a 66% or better recovery, which may not be ideal, but should ensure you’re not going to be dead on your feet.\n\nRealistically, I don’t use these features too often. I do have a sleep goal set in my weekly plan, but I’m not fiddling with an app every night to decide when to wake up. On the other hand, if I had a chaotic schedule, like that of a student or a pro sports player, I could definitely see making more use of this feature.\n\nThe activity and sleep tracking happen more or less automatically, and pretty much any fitness tracker or smartwatch can do those things. Where Whoop really shines, from a wellness perspective, is in helping you track all the little habits and factors that may be affecting your sleep or your athletic performance.\n\nThis is where the Journal comes in. You can fill it out at any time during the day, but it will also pop up first thing in the morning and ask you what happened yesterday. Did you eat a late meal? Did you have any alcohol? Did you hydrate well? If you don’t like these questions, you can set it up to ask you different ones. It can also pull in data from other parts of the app or from connected apps—for example, if you log your menstrual cycle in Apple Health, that can show up here as well.\n\nEach habit or factor only becomes useful if you log at least five yeses and five nos. Anything that you almost always do, or that you almost never do, isn’t going to be very helpful to track. So I’ve narrowed down my Journal questions to only include things I’ll answer differently from night to night, or things I’m trying to improve on.\n\nOne important caveat: leaving the question blank doesn’t count as a yes or a no. At first I only answered a question if I could say “yes,” and otherwise I’d leave it blank—for example, answering “yes” if I’d had alcohol that day. But when I looked at my results later, I found that with a total of seven yeses and zero nos for alcohol, Whoop couldn’t give me any reports that used that information. When I noticed this I was able to backfill the last few days’ worth of journal entries, but you can’t go back more than about a week.\n\nThat extra week’s worth of data was enough to get an answer on alcohol, though: it hurts my recovery, taking it down an average of 9% on nights I had a beer or two. Or at least that’s how Whoop represents it—these are correlations, and Whoop doesn’t actually know what’s causing what. For example, taking melatonin supposedly hurts my recovery by 4%. But is melatonin really the culprit, or do I tend to take melatonin when I’m already having trouble sleeping? You need to take these results with a big grain of salt. To Whoop’s credit, it includes a note that “this impact is significantly different than the Whoop average. Note that impacts can sometimes be affected by other correlated factors that you don’t track.”\n\nThe two things that do help my recovery, according to Whoop’s insights (which you can access from the top of the Journal screen), are sticking to a consistent bedtime—8% improvement—and being well-hydrated, a 4% improvement. The consistent bedtime was automatically filled out from Whoop data, while the hydration came from me answering a yes/no question each day.\n\nWeekly plans are a nice way to work on a small set of habits for a short time. Rather than trying to monitor everything for every outcome, you pick, say, three things you want to work on. Here are some examples that the app provides, and the habits or factors that each one tracks:\n\nBoost fitness: increase time in high intensity heart rate zones, meet a protein goal four days per week, do any strength training activity one day per week\n\nFeel better: increase daily steps, meet hydration goal four days per week, do “any recovery activity” three days per week\n\nSleep deeper: increase sleep consistency, increase sleep performance, avoid late meals\n\nAfter experimenting with some of these, I ended up creating a custom plan for myself. I chose:\n\nGet 7:30 hours of sleep on average\n\nAvoid using my phone in bed four days per week\n\nMeet my hydration goal five days per week\n\nThroughout the week I can check in on how I’m doing, and at the end of the week Whoop gives me a little report and asks if I’d like to do the same plan next week, or change it up. I find this a useful way to work on a mini goal, and it’s a lot less overwhelming than poring over huge dashboards full of all the data Whoop can collect.\n\nFor when you do want to pore over all your data, there are detailed weekly and monthly “performance assessments” that Whoop can share with you. Each of these is a PDF with graphs showing what you did over the course of the week or month, and how it compares with previous data.\n\nFor example, my monthly report for last April shows how my Strain and recovery compare with previous weeks throughout the year. I don’t wear my Whoop often enough to get any big insights from this—as I said, I only really wear it when I’m testing features or writing a review—but man, I would love this if it were available on one of the devices I do wear month in and month out. (As much as I admire the Whoop, I can only wear so many devices in addition to the ones I test for work.)\n\nMy weekly report is more narrowly focused. The most recent one starts with a statement: “Strain was optimal. Sleep could use improvement.” My Strain is also down slightly this week compared with the previous week, and my sleep consistency was poor. I like the graph that shows how my bedtimes and wake-up times line up (or don’t) with the times the app recommended for me.\n\nThe Whoop app gives you a wealth of data, and honestly I would say most of it isn’t worth paying attention to. The app has so many data points and fractal little rabbit holes you can get lost in. You could spend hours perusing reports and tweaking settings. You could spend an unlimited amount of time chatting with the Whoop Coach AI. And you don’t need to do that.\n\nWhat is useful is choosing a few things to pay attention to and letting go of the rest. Fortunately, the app gives you plenty of ways to do this. You can select a few things that matter to you in the Weekly Plan, and you can hide things from your Dashboard that you don’t need to check on every day.\n\nAs for the things I (almost) never pay attention to:\n\nDon’t overthink your sleep stages. Getting enough sleep, and consistent sleep, will cover your bases.\n\nDon’t read too much into the recovery scores; you are resilient enough to be able to handle your scheduled workout even if your sleep wasn’t perfect. The exception would be if you’re feeling truly awful—you’re sick or something—in which case, you would know because of how you feel, not because of a number on an app.\n\nRemember that the insights tell you about correlation, not causation—as in my melatonin example, where melatonin is correlated with worse sleep, possibly because I'm taking it when I expect to have worse sleep. These are not really \"insights\" at all, just data that you'll need to use your own brain (and further experimentation) to make sense of.\n\nI have found that paying too much attention to a recovery app can drive me a little crazy. Instead of waking up and not really thinking about how I feel—I’m fine, probably—I find myself wondering if the app agrees that I feel tired and sore. Or I’ll think I’m OK, but the app says my HRV is down, and now I have to think about what may have caused that. I wouldn’t recommend intensive tracking like this for a person who finds they can easily get sucked in to obsessing over numbers. But if numbers bring you joy, the Whoop app can certainly give you plenty of them.",

    "description": "Analysis of more than one million people shows that mental-health disorders fall into five clusters, each of them linked to a specific set of genetic variants.",
    "fullText": "Psychiatrists have long relied on diagnostic manuals that regard most mental-health conditions as distinct from one another — depression, for instance, is listed as a separate disorder from anxiety. But a genetic analysis of more than one million people suggests that a host of psychiatric conditions have common biological roots.\n\nThe results, published today in Nature1, reveal that people with seemingly disparate conditions often share many of the same disease-linked genetic variants. The analysis found that 14 major psychiatric disorders cluster into five categories, each characterized by a common set of genetic risk factors. The neurodevelopmental category, for example, includes both attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism, which psychiatric handbooks classify as separate conditions.\n\nMany supposedly individual conditions are “ultimately more overlapping than they are distinct, which should offer patients hope”, says study co-author Andrew Grotzinger, a psychiatric geneticist at the University of Colorado Boulder. “You can see the despair on someone’s face [when] you give them five different labels as opposed to one label.”\n\nGrotzinger says his team’s work was motivated by the finding that people diagnosed with one mental-health condition are highly likely to be diagnosed with another one. For example, previous research has shown that most people diagnosed with depression have also been diagnosed with a condition called generalized anxiety disorder, and vice versa2.\n\nTo learn whether there is a biological explanation for these correlations, Grotzinger and his colleagues aggregated genomic data from more than one million people with psychiatric conditions and from millions of healthy controls.\n\nThe researchers found that the 14 mental-health conditions they studied generally fall into five distinct buckets, each with its own genetic profile. There’s a schizophrenia/bipolar disorder category; an ‘internalizing’ category that includes depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder; a neurodevelopmental category; and a compulsive category that includes obsessive-compulsive disorder and anorexia.\n\nA final category includes substance-use disorders such as alcohol-use disorder and nicotine dependence. People whose genetic profile corresponds to a given bucket are at elevated risk of any of the conditions in that bucket. Other genetic and environmental triggers also affect risk.\n\nThe team then worked backwards from the categories that they had identified and found 238 specific genomic regions that are associated with at least one of these shared categories. For example, the researchers found that one region on chromosome 11 raised genetic risk for eight separate disorders, because the region codes for genes linked to dopamine signalling.\n\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-025-04037-w\n\nRead the related News & Views, ‘Shared genetic risk in psychiatric disorders’.\n\nGrotzinger, A.

    "description": "A warehouse worker consumed 8 energy drinks a day to \"stay alert\" at work, which led to a dangerous health condition",
    "fullText": "A “fit and well” man was rushed to the hospital after suffering a stroke caused by blood pressure that was “sky high”\n\nAfter he was discharged, his blood pressure began to rise again, and upon a follow-up visit, he shared with his doctors that he consumes 8 energy drinks a day\n\nThe man was drinking more than 3 times the recommended amount of caffeine\n\nA “fit and well” man’s habit of downing 8 energy drinks a day caused him to have a stroke — and he’s left with lingering damage.\n\nA 54-year-old warehouse worker arrived to the emergency room with numbness, weakness on his left side, and ataxia (trouble with balance and movement), according to a case report in BMJ Journals. He was “normally fit and well,” the report says —  except for his blood pressure.\n\n“His blood pressure was sky high — about 254 over 150 millimeters — yet when you looked at him you’d never know it, because he looked so well. That’s why we call hypertension the silent killer,” Dr. Sunil Munshi, a consulting physician at Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust in the United Kingdom, and senior author of the report, told CNN.\n\nNormal blood pressure for a man his age is less than 120 over less than 80, per the American Heart Association. His numbers are classified as a “hypertensive emergency.”\n\nThe blood pressure had caused “a stroke in the deeper part of the brain, the thalamus, which explains the unsteadiness,” Munshi told the outlet. The man, a warehouse worker from the Sherwood district of the English city of Nottingham, was admitted and treated with five different medications to make his blood pressure drop.\n\nAfter he was discharged, his blood pressure began to increase again, leaving doctors baffled — until, as Munshi shares, he told doctors about his energy drink habit.\n\n“Each day he consumed eight highly potent energy drinks to stay alert for his job — two cans at four different times during the day,” Munshi told CNN. “Each of the drinks contained 160 milligrams of caffeine. Suddenly the diagnosis was clear.”\n\nThe Mayo Clinic says that up to 400 milligrams of caffeine a day “seems safe” for most adults; the patient was drinking more than three times that amount.\n\nToo much caffeine can increase your risk of developing cardiovascular disease, according to a study from the American College of Cardiology.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nHe stopped drinking the energy drinks (the specific brand was not identified in the study), and his blood pressure returned to normal. But the lingering impact of his stroke and energy drink habit remain, he told his doctors, per CNN.\n\n“I obviously wasn’t aware of the dangers drinking energy drinks were causing to myself,” he said, explaining he’s “been left with numbness [in my] left hand side hand and fingers, foot and toes even after 8 years.”\n\nAs Munshi explained, there are other ingredients in energy drinks that can contribute to health problems. “Energy drinks that contain caffeine plus taurine produce significantly higher blood pressure than caffeine alone,” he said. “They also contain high levels of glucose — we know sugar damages the blood vessels in diabetes which leads to heart damage.”",

    "description": "The New York Times said it would not “be deterred by false and inflammatory language” in response to President Donald Trump’s latest attack on the outlet for reporting on his age.",
    "fullText": "The New York Times said on Wednesday that it would not “be deterred by false and inflammatory language” in response to President Donald Trump’s latest claim that the outlet’s reporting on his age was an attempt to “libel and demean” him.\n\nThe paper said its audience deserved “in-depth reporting and regular updates about the health of the leaders they elect.” The statement came in response to Trump’s Tuesday attack against the paper, apparently over a November article focused on his declining energy, which argued the Times should “cease publication because they are a horrible, biased, and untruthful ‘source’ of information.”\n\n“Mr. Trump welcomed our reporting on the age and fitness of his predecessors; we’re applying the same journalistic scrutiny to his vitality,” spokesperson Nicole Taylor wrote in a statement. “Our reporting is heavily sourced, based on interviews with people clsoe to the president and with medical experts. We won’t be deterred by false and inflammatory language that distorts the role of a free press.”\n\nStill, such an approach to news coverage didn’t seem to resonate with Trump, who claimed again that his cognitive test results were something few people, “including those working at The New York Times,” could do very well.\n\n“Despite all of this, the time and work involved, The New York Times, and some others, like to pretend that I am ‘slowing up,’ am maybe not as sharp as I once was, or am in poor physical health, knowing that it is not true, and knowing that I work very hard, probably harder than I have ever worked before,” Trump wrote. “I will know when I am ‘slowing up,’ but it’s not now! After all of the work I have done with Medical Exams, Cognitive Exams, and everything else, I actually believe it’s seditious, perhaps even treasonous, for The New York Times, and others, to consistently do FAKE reports in order to libel and demean  ‘THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.’ They are true Enemies of the People, and we should do something about it.”\n\nThe Times’ Katie Rogers and Dylan Freedman reported last month that Trump has started his events later in recent months and his public appearances had decreased. They wrote that, while “Trump and the people around him still talk about him as if he is the Energizer Bunny of presidential politics,” “the reality is more complicated.”\n\nTrump lashed out at the paper hours after the story published, calling Rogers “ugly, both inside and out” for writing the story and claimed then that the paper was an “ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE.”\n\nThe post New York Times Blasts Trump’s ‘False and Inflammatory’ Claim That Reporting on His Health Could Be Libelous appeared first on TheWrap.",

    "fullText": "Luxe quartz countertops have surged in popularity in recent years, with an 800% rise in imports to the US alone, thanks to their durability, heat resistance and smooth, natural look.\n\nBut that beauty may come at a price to the workers who install them.\n\nThe Massachusetts Department of Public Health issued a safety alert on Tuesday regarding silicosis, a progressive and incurable lung disease.\n\nThe state confirmed the first case of silicosis in a Massachusetts employee of the stone countertop fabrication industry.\n\nHistorically associated with mining and construction, the disease has become more prevalent among stone fabricators working with engineered stone, which contains significantly more silica than natural materials like granite or marble.\n\nAbout 2.3 million US workers are exposed to silica in the workplace, according to the American Lung Association.\n\nSilicosis is caused by inhaling crystalline silica dust, which is generated by cutting, polishing or grinding stones, especially high-silica engineered quartz.\n\nSymptoms can include an irritating cough, mucus, shortness of breath, trouble breathing, fatigue, chest pain and leg swelling.\n\nWhile there are treatments to manage symptoms, there’s no cure for silicosis. The disease can worsen as it progresses, potentially leading to lung cancer, tuberculosis and even death.\n\nThe Massachusetts resident had worked for stone countertop fabrication and installation companies for 14 years, the state said. He’s a Hispanic man in his 40s.\n\nThe first US case of silicosis linked to engineered stone was reported in Texas in 2015.\n\nIn a 2023 study, California researchers identified 52 California quartz countertop workers with silicosis.\n\nTwenty of them had advanced silicosis, and 10 died before the study concluded.\n\nWhile the disease is potentially deadly, there hasn’t been an outright ban on quartz in the kitchen.\n\nRather, public health officials and researchers are asking for stricter regulations and safety precautions.\n\n“The confirmation of this case in Massachusetts is a tragic reminder that silicosis is not just a distant threat — it is here, and it is seriously impacting the health of workers in Massachusetts,” Emily H. Sparer-Fine, director of the Massachusetts Department of Public Health’s Occupational Health Surveillance Program, said in a statement.\n\n“Beyond the critical role employers play, everyone involved in the supply chain can help reduce the danger by opting for materials that contain less silica and pose fewer health hazards,” she added.\n\nPrecautions such as proper ventilation and a medical surveillance program for workers have been floated as possible solutions.\n\n“Our paper raises the alarm,” said Dr. Sheiphali Gandhi, a UC San Francisco pulmonologist and co-author of the California study. “If we don’t stop it now, we’re going to have hundreds, if not thousands, of more cases. Even if we stopped it now, we’re going to be seeing these cases for the next decade because [silicosis] takes years to develop.”\n\nIn 2016, the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration issued two respirable crystalline silica standards to protect workers.\n\nThese standards require employee exposures to be below the permissible limit of 50 micrograms of respirable crystalline silica per cubic meter of air over an eight-hour workday.\n\nIn 2019 and 2020, however, California safety officials found that about 72% of the 808 fabrication shops operating in the state were “likely out of compliance with the existing silica standard,” putting hundreds of workers at risk of silicosis, according to NPR.\n\nSince then, the California Division of OSHA adopted emergency rules for respirable crystalline silica in 2023, which were made permanent in late 2024.",

    "description": "The startup's new tech could compete with Big Tech's health AI projects from heavyweights like Alphabet and OpenAI.",
    "fullText": "Included Health is rolling out a new AI tool that could pit it against Big Tech's latest health bets.\n\nThe healthcare startup has launched an AI-powered personal health assistant, Business Insider has learned exclusively. The tech draws on patients' medical claims, benefits information, and other data to offer on-demand answers to health-related questions.\n\nIncluded Health is tapping into a hot area in healthcare AI, where it's competing against other health startups as well as tech heavyweights. Alphabet's Verily released its own AI-powered app in October that allows patients to connect their medical records and ask a chatbot their health-related questions. OpenAI wants to win in consumer health tech, too, and is considering building tools such as its own personal health assistant, Business Insider reported in November.\n\nIncluded Health has been scaling on the premise of personalizing how patients interact with their healthcare for over a decade. The company, which sells tech to about 300 employers and health plans to help patients better navigate their health benefits, tested its AI assistant for about 18 months to ensure its accuracy in smaller pilots before making it available to its entire employer base, CEO Owen Tripp said.\n\n\"This can't be ChatGPT level of probability. It has to be precise,\" he said.\n\nTripp is optimistic about patients receiving general health guidance from LLMs like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude. Those AI tools can help patients learn more about their conditions and prepare for doctor's visits, he said. But he emphasized that Included's tech takes that guidance a step further.\n\n\"When it gets down to the business of actually taking care of oneself or taking care of somebody else, you're going to need a lot of very secure, specific data and a whole context to go solve problems, including the exact medical history of that patient,\" Tripp said.\n\nPatient-facing healthcare AI sometimes walks a regulatory tightrope, especially if the tech provides personalized advice that effectively replaces the work clinicians are licensed to do. Tripp said he doubts that most large tech companies attempting to delve into medical records aggregation will want to grapple with that complexity.\n\n\"I predict, like many before them, they will pull back. It's just hard, and the juice is often not worth the squeeze for these high-profile companies,\" he said.\n\nIncluded Health's personal health assistant, called Dot, has become its members' front door and the foundation for Included's new products, said COO Nupur Srivastava.\n\nIncluded recently put Dot in front of members during open enrollment to help answer their benefits questions, Srivastava said. The AI agent can also help patients prepare for doctor's visits and send the clinician a summary of patients' past visits ahead of time.\n\nIncluded Health still employs plenty of its own clinicians and care advocates that members can talk to if they prefer. Srivastava also noted that if a patient mentions the term 'suicide' in a conversation with Dot, \"within a minute, someone will call you.\"\n\nWhen asked about Big Tech and AI startups' ambitions to build personalized health AI, Tripp said that Included Health is in talks with multiple potential partners to help them achieve those goals. He didn't specify which companies it's talking to, but he suggested some AI companies are focused on acquiring personalized health data that they can anonymize and use to train models.\n\n\"But when it comes to actually delivering patient care, we're pretty confident that companies that are going to succeed will be the ones that have well-trained physicians licensed in all 50 states, delivering on a real-time platform, across mind, body, and wallet,\" he said.\n\nIncluded Health was supposed to go public in 2022. The startup had hired banks for an IPO push, but pulled out of its planned investor meetings when the market started to tank, Tripp told Business Insider in January.\n\nTripp declined to share specifics about Included's exit strategy as of November. But Included is profitable, so the company doesn't need to raise money through a public listing, he said. Included hasn't publicly fundraised since it was formed from the 2021 merger of Grand Rounds and Doctor on Demand, and the company hasn't shared its valuation.\n\nThe public markets haven't been forgiving to healthcare startups. Only two digital health companies went public this year, Hinge Health and Omada Health. And while Hinge and Omada have fared far better than most companies that listed during digital health's 2021 IPO wave, healthcare IPO hopefuls still face high standards to going public and significant volatility risks once they begin trading.\n\n\"The last few years in our space haven't been a great commercial for being a public company,\" Tripp said.\n\nWith so many developments in healthcare AI, however, Tripp does recognize that an IPO could create opportunities for Included Health to acquire other companies.\n\n\"I do think this is a time where there are going to be some interesting capabilities and technologies available in the market that allow us to provide even more service to our members,\" he said. \"I do have my eyes very open to how I would use capital to execute on some of those M&A events. That part is more important to me.\"",

    "fullText": "King Charles is a step closer to saying goodbye to Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s kids before it’s too late.\n\nThe Sun reported on December 7 that Harry had a major win in his ongoing case to restore his security in the United Kingdom after he lost the taxpayer-funded benefit after he and his wife, Meghan Markle, stepped down as senior members of the British royal family and moved to the United States in 2020. According to The Sun, a review of Harry’s security by the official body that assesses how royals and VIPs are guarded is now underway by the U.K. government.\n\nHarry's Ex's Friend Called Their Breakup the 'Best Thing That Ever Happened to Her' Right Before Reports the Prince Saw Her as the '1 Person Who Really Understood' Him\n\nThe Sun also reported that evidence has already been collected by Harry’s team, the police, and the government, and any decision around Harry’s security will be known in January 2026. “The UK Government’s protective security system is rigorous and proportionate. It is our long-standing policy not to provide detailed information on those arrangements, as doing so could compromise their integrity and affect individuals’ security,” a U.K. government spokesperson said in a statement at the time.\n\nThe update means Harry, who has said that he doesn’t feel safe bringing Meghan and his two children, Archie and Lilibet, back to the U.K. unless they had security, is one step closer to reuniting his father, King Charles, with his grandchildren. According to BBC, Charles hasn’t seen Lilibet and Archie in person since the Sussexes’ visit to the U.K. in 2022 for the Platinum Jubilee.\n\nThe update also comes after Charles and Harry reunited for the first time in years during a meeting in September, which was seen as a “massive step” forward in their estrangement, according to People. The update also comes as a source told Us Weekly in December that Charles is viewing his 2025 Christmas celebration as his “last” holiday after he was diagnosed with cancer in 2024.\n\n“Charles prioritizes duty, but he’s also a family man who knows his time is precious,” the insider said. “He wants a special last Christmas in case it’s his last.”\n\nFor Charles’ “last Christmas,” the insider reported that the king planned on taking his St. Mary Magdalene Church on Christmas morning and recording his Christmas speech, which airs later that afternoon to million of listeners. “Nothing would stop Charles from doing that,” the insider said. “He will do everything expected of him and more.” Another source added, “His health isn’t the best. They’re taking it day by day.”\n\n25 Celebrity Couples Who Stayed Together After Cheating Scandals\n\nEvery Celebrity Who Has Hosted the Golden Globes Through the Years\n\n29 Short Celebrity Marriages That Were Over Before They Started",

    "description": "We live in a time of unprecedented insight into our bodies—if you can afford it.",
    "fullText": "The latest Apple Watch costs $429. A basic Peloton Bike is $1,395, plus a $49.99 monthly subscription. Throw in a WHOOP membership at $149 annually, maybe an Oura Ring for another $349, and suddenly you're looking at thousands of dollars to participate in what's become the standard way many Americans approach their health. For some, that price tag is steep. For others, it's a non-starter.\n\nI'm no stranger to the appeal of the latest, greatest wearables and smart health devices. But as all this wellness technology become the norm, what does this mean for people who don't strap a smartwatch onto their wrists? If comprehensive health data—and the insights it provides—becomes a luxury good, the existing digital health divide will only get worse.\n\nThe issue starts well before anyone considers buying a fitness tracker. Digital equity in healthcare is already a fundamental access issue. \"In many ways, access to healthcare means access to technology,\" says Amy Gonzales, an associate professor in UC Santa Barbara's Department of Communication. \"Especially since [the COVID-19 pandemic], the healthcare industry relies heavily on technology for their services. Text reminders about your appointment, scanning a QR code to check in, needing an e-health account to see your test results, or some providers only being available via telehealth, and so on.\"\n\nThe basic infrastructure of modern healthcare—patient portals, appointment scheduling apps, prescription management systems—demands a level of digital literacy and access that not everyone can meet. Seniors may struggle with smartphone interfaces. Low-income families might rely on limited mobile data or shared devices. People with certain disabilities may find standard health apps difficult or impossible to navigate. And the problem compounds: Gonzales notes the populations most likely to face barriers with technology are often the same groups who may need that healthcare the most.\n\nAgainst this backdrop of baseline digital inequity, fitness trackers and wearables have gotten more and more popular. These aren't essential medical devices in the traditional sense—nobody's life support depends on their Fitbit—but they've become cultural markers of health optimization. More concerning, they're increasingly becoming tools that provide genuinely useful health information that simply isn't available to people without the resources to buy in. Heart rate, blood oxygen saturation, sleep stages, stress levels, and more: We're living in a time of unprecedented insight into what our bodies are doing, if you can afford it.\n\nIN some circles, these devices have become simply how health-conscious people approach their wellbeing. Studies have shown that wearables can help detect abnormal heart rhythms, encourage increased physical activity, and provide early warning signs of illness. Some insurance companies offer discounts for users who share their fitness tracking data. Employers incorporate wearables into wellness programs.\n\nWhile this is promising for those who can afford it, others get left behind. \"The digital divide is even more problematic with 'bonus devices,' or health 'accoutrements,' like smart wearables,\" says Gonzales. If at-risk health populations are already at-risk for digital access, it tracks that this access gap is only getting wider.\n\nThe creation of a two-tiered information system is perhaps the most insidious aspect of fitness tech inequality. A person with an Apple Watch receives detailed daily reports about their cardiovascular health, activity levels, and sleep quality. They get alerts when their heart rate becomes irregular, or they can share comprehensive data with their physician that provides context for symptoms and conditions. Someone without these devices? They're left with subjective assessments and whatever gets captured during periodic doctor visits.\n\n\"If you don't have the same resources to track your blood pressure, blood pressure, or physical activity,\" says Gonzales, \"you are certainly being left behind on useful healthcare.\" Consider two people with similar cardiovascular risk factors. The one with a wearable device might receive an alert and seek immediate treatment, potentially preventing a stroke. The other person might not notice symptoms until a serious cardiac event occurs. Both deserved that potentially life-saving alert, but only one could afford the device that provided it.\n\nAs more people in higher-income brackets adopt these technologies and share data with healthcare providers, medical understanding itself may become skewed toward populations who can afford comprehensive self-monitoring. If research studies increasingly incorporate wearable data, but if that data predominantly comes from affluent, educated users, the resulting insights may not apply equally across all demographics.\n\nAccess isn't the only lens through which to view this fitness tech. \"There's this implicit assumption that wearables are inherently good,\" says Gonzales. \"What about privacy risks?\" After all, if you think you own all your health data, think again.\n\nThink of the history of the healthcare industry's relationship with marginalized communities. The Tuskegee syphilis study, forced sterilizations, and ongoing disparities in pain management and maternal mortality have created a pretty understandable skepticism toward giving up data, to say the least. \"Given the history of experimentation and exploitation of certain low-income populations, there's a natural distrust in these sub-groups,\" Gonzales says. \"Maybe these demographics intentionally avoid third parties collecting their data.\"\n\nSo, the same communities that might benefit most from health monitoring technology may also have the most legitimate reasons to be wary of it. As I've previously covered, data privacy protections remain inconsistent, and the long-term implications of sharing detailed biometric data with corporations are still unclear. For populations that have historically been surveilled, exploited, or discriminated against, choosing not to participate in constant data collection might be a rational decision, rather than simply a matter of access. There's something to be said for health approaches that don't involve third-party corporations accumulating detailed records of your body's functions.\n\nNaturally, budget options for fitness tech do exist, and these options can help some people access these technologies. But even \"affordable\" options still cost money that many families simply don't have for what remains, technically speaking, optional equipment. When you're choosing between a $50 fitness tracker and groceries, the choice isn't really a choice at all.\n\nAll of this is to say that the fitness tech inequality problem can't be solved by individual purchasing decisions or corporate discount programs. It's embedded in broader questions about healthcare access, digital equity, and what we consider essential versus optional in maintaining health. Glucose monitors, fertility trackers, or blood pressure cuffs could more easily qualify as medical equipment, where an Oura ring is still a luxury good. Addressing the gap requires reimagining what counts as necessary healthcare technology. Otherwise, we could be approaching a future where your ability to detect health problems early, track chronic conditions, and optimize your fitness depends on whether you can afford a monthly subscription.\n\nHealthcare has become digitized, creating new opportunities for monitoring and intervention, but also new mechanisms for inequality. As fitness technology continues advancing, offering more sophisticated monitoring and more actionable insights, that fundamental inequality will only get worse. Because at the intersection of healthcare and technology, \"the people who struggle with one are often the same people who need the other,\" Gonzales says.\n\nThe Apple Watch on your wrist may feel like a personal choice, a small investment in your personal wellness. But scale that up across millions of people and billions of data points, and individual choices become structural inequalities. Technology that was supposed to democratize health information may instead be creating new hierarchies of who gets to know what about their own bodies. And those who need that knowledge most may be the least likely to access it.",

    "fullText": "Experts warn of dangers as England and Wales study shows 13- to 17-year-olds consulting AI amid long waiting lists for services\n\nIt was after one friend was shot and another stabbed, both fatally, that Shan asked ChatGPT for help. She had tried conventional mental health services but “chat”, as she came to know her AI “friend”, felt safer, less intimidating and, crucially, more available when it came to handling the trauma from the deaths of her young friends.\n\nAs she started consulting the AI model, the Tottenham teenager joined about 40% of 13- to 17-year-olds in England and Wales affected by youth violence who are turning to AI chatbots for mental health support, according to research among more than 11,000 young people.\n\nIt found that both victims and perpetrators of violence were markedly more likely to be using AI for such support than other teenagers. The findings, from the Youth Endowment Fund, have sparked warnings from youth leaders that children at risk “need a human not a bot”.\n\nThe results suggest chatbots are fulfilling demand unmet by conventional mental health services, which have long waiting lists and which some young users find lacking in empathy. The supposed privacy of the chatbot is another key factor in driving use by victims or perpetrators of crimes.\n\nAfter her friends were killed Shan, 18, not her real name, started using Snapchat’s AI before switching to ChatGPT, which she can talk to at any time of day or night with two clicks on her smartphone.\n\n“I feel like it definitely is a friend,” she said, adding that it was less intimidating, more private and less judgmental than her experience with conventional NHS and charity mental health support.\n\n“The more you talk to it like a friend it will be talking to you like a friend back. If I say to chat ‘Hey bestie, I need some advice’. Chat will talk back to me like it’s my best friend, she’ll say, ‘Hey bestie, I got you girl’.”\n\nOne in four of 13- to 17-year-olds have used an AI chatbot for mental health support in the past year, with black children twice as likely as white children to have done so, the study found. Teenagers were more likely to go online for support, including using AI, if they were on a waiting list for treatment or diagnosis or had been denied, than if they were already receiving in-person support.\n\nCrucially, Shan said, the AI was “accessible 24/7” and would not tell teachers or parents about what she had disclosed. She felt this was a considerable advantage over telling a school therapist, after her own experience of what she thought were confidences being shared with teachers and her mother.\n\nBoys who were involved in gang activities felt safer asking chatbots for advice about other safer ways to make money than a teacher or parent who might leak the information to police or other gang members, putting them in danger, she said.\n\nAnother young person, who has been using AI for mental health support but asked not to be named, told the Guardian: “The current system is so broken for offering help for young people. Chatbots provide immediate answers. If you’re going to be on the waiting list for one to two years to get anything, or you can have an immediate answer within a few minutes … that’s where the desire to use AI comes from.”\n\nJon Yates, the chief executive of the Youth Endowment Fund, which commissioned the research, said: “Too many young people are struggling with their mental health and can’t get the support they need. It’s no surprise that some are turning to technology for help. We have to do better for our children, especially those most at risk. They need a human not a bot.”\n\nThere have been growing concerns about the dangers of chatbots when children engage with them at length. OpenAI, the US company behind ChatGPT, is facing several lawsuits including from families of young people who have killed themselves after long engagements.\n\nIn the case of the Californian 16-year-old Adam Raine, who took his life in April, OpenAI has denied it was caused by the chatbot. It has said it has been improving its technology “to recognise and respond to signs of mental or emotional distress, de-escalate conversations, and guide people toward real-world support.”. The startup said in September it could start contacting authorities in cases where users start talking seriously about suicide.\n\nHanna Jones, a youth violence and mental health researcher in London, said: “To have this tool that could tell you technically anything – it’s almost like a fairytale. You’ve got this magic book that can solve all your problems. That sounds incredible.”\n\nBut she is worried about the lack of regulation.\n\n“People are using ChatGPT for mental health support, when it’s not designed for that,” she said. “What we need now is to increase regulations that are evidence-backed but also youth-led. This is not going to be solved by adults making decisions for young people. Young people need to be in the driving seat to make decisions around ChatGPT and mental health support that uses AI, because it’s so different to our world. We didn’t grow up with this. We can’t even imagine what it is to be a young person today.”",

    "fullText": "It’s time we stopped flinching at the assaults of the far right—and started fighting back.\n\nOver the past year, I’ve noticed a pattern among some of my colleagues in public health, biomedical research, and the university settings in which I work.\n\nIt’s a strange, reflexive tic: Faced with bad-faith criticism from malign actors, we shrink back, saying, “Oh, it’s not you. It’s me,” and walk onto their terrain with accommodation in our hearts.\n\nSome may think that, faced with the full fury of the far right, some kind of retreat is the only option. But walking further and further into the mouth of the Leviathan only serves to make you dinner for a very large fish.\n\nIn public health, the reigning trope is that over the past five years, we have lost the trust of ordinary Americans, largely coinciding with the response to the Covid pandemic. It’s an uncritical analysis that we eat up like candy—I have been in so many discussions and heard so many talks about how we need to “regain” or “rebuild” trust—and I think we have to stop and reflect for just a moment.\n\nDavid Wallace-Wells wrote a piece in The New York Times that may indicate that our own conventional wisdom about these matters may be wrong:\n\nThe poll, published in The Argument with the headline “The Covid Political Backlash Disappeared,” showed that respondents largely supported mitigation policies, at least in retrospect. Despite conventional wisdom about public health resentment and liberal overreach, mitigation policies do not appear to have disproportionately cost the Democrats, who were graded more positively than Republicans in their handling of the pandemic and rated more highly on matters of personal health; despite criticism about school closures so pervasive that national Democrats now reflexively apologize for them those closures are still seen by most as having been largely necessary at the time; and although the pandemic experience has damaged confidence in vaccines when it comes to routine shots, the country remains pretty anti-anti-vaccine, with 77 percent of respondents telling The Argument’s pollsters they’d advise friends to follow the standard vaccination schedule and only 15 percent saying they’d advise against it.\n\nWhat Wallace-Wells doesn’t mention here is that much of the conventional wisdom about “public health resentment and liberal overreach” was also the product of a manufactured smear campaign by the right. I’ve written about this before, and Walker Bragman and Alex Kotch have chronicled the far right’s hijacking of the war on Covid since the beginning. Yet too many of my colleagues are like small mammals hypnotized by snakes—mesmerized into submission, in this case, by far-right rhetoric. Yes, we can all agree that public health needs criticism, an analysis of the response to the pandemic included, but we can do better without going belly-up. We’ve got to stop apologizing for the work we do, and take a far less naïve view of the criticisms of public health and separate what is real and substantial from what is ginned-up agit-prop.\n\nWhile some university presidents (at Michigan, Penn and elsewhere) have rolled back DEI programs, Democratic politicians like Gavin Newsom and Pete Buttigieg have decided that trans Americans are politically expendable, and some liberal pundits like Ezra Klein are pushing for (more) Democratic pro-life candidates, in public health and biomedicine, these are issues on which we have to move from “no apologies” to “no surrender.”\n\nRace, gender, and sexuality may be a third rail of American politics for some, but for those of us in public health and biomedicine, these issues are central to our work, and improving the health and well-being of Americans depends on facing them head-on. Jay Bhattacharya, the director of the National Institutes of Health, has made it a mission to destroy research on health disparities in America, even as he speaks out of both sides of his mouth by praising work “that advances the health and well-being of minority populations.” Thousands of grants for work looking at the interaction of race and health outcomes across the country have been terminated. RFK Jr. has slashed the budget and staffing at offices that address minority health in the US at the National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the Health Resources and Services Administration, and at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. Yet, as Mary Bassett, the former health commissioner of New York City and now a professor at the Harvard School of Public Health, has said: “There hasn’t been a single year since Colonial America that the population of Black America hasn’t died younger and died sicker than white America.” Research on and programmatic work to rid us of these gross inequities in health outcomes has to remain a priority for us in public health and biomedical research; otherwise, we are practicing a form of apartheid-style science, where only white lives matter.\n\nAnd this leads us to DEI programs that are meant to ensure that we address the barriers to opportunities in our field. This is an indispensable goal for at least two reasons. The first one is simply pragmatic—we do not know where new insights will come from, so we need to actively recruit talent from every quarter. Pretending that everyone starts their journeys from the same place in our society is farcical. Access to opportunity in the US is tied to race and ethnicity, income, and family background, and it is not a level playing field. As Stephen Jay Gould said in The Panda’s Thumb: “I am, somehow, less interested in the weight and convolutions of Einstein’s brain than in the near certainty that people of equal talent have lived and died in cotton fields and sweatshops.” In a world that has just experienced the worst epidemic in a century, and with the effects of climate change only getting worse, we need everyone off the bench and in the fight. And having a more diverse workforce in public health and biomedicine is important for another reason: There are key discoveries in health disparities that have come from Black and brown researchers, including uncovering the problems with race-adjusted scoring for kidney function, the danger for black mothers of maternal risk algorithms, and the complex issues associated with cardiovascular disease risk assessment among black patients and at the population level, the role of race in disparities in hypertension, diabetes, and all-cause mortality. In infectious diseases, my own field, it was W.E.B. Du Bois himself over a century ago who examined disparities in TB, syphilis, and pneumonia among Black Americans and ascribed these differences to social and economic conditions, discrimination, and racism.\n\nOn sexuality and gender? I work in HIV—the termination of grants and programs on LGBTQ health, particularly trans health, endangers lives full-stop. President Trump, in his 2019 State of the Union address, announced his landmark initiative to End the HIV Epidemic (EHE), and later that month the CDC announced that HIV prevention efforts had stalled out—EHE couldn’t have come at a better time. Almost seven years later, Trump has pulled the plug on LGBTQ health. Trans Americans have some of the highest rates of HIV in this country. Comprehensive care, including gender-affirming hormone therapy, is vital in stemming infections among this vulnerable group. Furthermore, gender-affirming care is “an integral determinant of trans people’s well-being.” Throwing trans people under the bus is bad medicine and bad public health and we should speak up on behalf of our trans sisters and brothers and call out attacks on this community when we see it. Trump and his cronies aren’t interested in the health and well-being of trans Americans; they see another set of people to demonize and target. Remaining silent is being complicit in this scapegoating, increasing health risks for close to 3 million of our fellow citizens. Finally, in the wake of Dobbs, millions of women are now at increased risk of suffering and death as abortion becomes illegal in state after state across the country. It’s a well-known epidemiological fact that legally induced abortion is far safer for pregnant people than childbirth. It isn’t even close: “the pregnancy-associated mortality rate among women who delivered live neonates was 8.8 deaths per 100,000 live births. The mortality rate related to induced abortion was 0.6 deaths per 100,000 abortions.” No matter what you personally think about abortion, interfering with the medical care of pregnant people is a bad public health move. Given that close to a quarter of all women in the US access abortion care in their lifetime, state restrictions on this vital part of medical care risk lives.\n\nAll of these are issues we must hold the line on, not cave over. The instinct to meet people halfway, to compromise, is not a terrible one. But when compromise is the goal in and of itself, it turns out you stand for little or nothing. In the case of the struggles for the future of public health and medicine in this country, this desire to placate the far right has too many people simply shifting their own views to the right. That is, the compromise isn’t really a compromise at all when it’s a one-way affair; it’s a capitulation. So many millions of lives are at stake right now, thanks to policies coming out of this administration. Giving in is giving these people up. And these people are those we have pledged to serve—whether we’re healthcare workers or on the frontlines of public health. We can try to justify this kind of accommodation in any way we want, but in the end, it’s hard to see it as anything but a Judas kiss.",

    "fullText": "U.S. health officials have issued travel advisories for Americans planning trips to certain tropical countries amid outbreaks of an untreatable mosquito-borne disease.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced Friday that it has issued Level 2 travel advisories for Cuba, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Guangdong Province in southern China, advising Americans to \"practice enhanced precautions\" when visiting these areas.\n\nHealth officials say there are currently no treatments for chikungunya, but the disease is vaccine-preventable, and vaccination is recommended for travelers to affected areas.\n\nThe most common symptoms of the virus include fever and joint pain, though patients may also experience headache, muscle pain, joint swelling or a rash, according to health officials. Symptoms typically appear three to seven days after being bitten by an infected mosquito, and most people recover within a week.\n\nCdc Reports 19Th Cruise Ship Norovirus Outbreak This Year, Affecting Passengers And Crew\n\nIn severe cases, some may experience severe joint pain lasting months or even years while others \"may require hospitalization because of the risk of organ damage and death,\" according to the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\nAccording to an Oct. 3 notice from WHO, there have been 445,000 suspected and confirmed cases of chikungunya and 155 deaths worldwide between January and September 2025.\n\nIn Bangladesh, WHO reported 700 suspected chikungunya cases in the capital, Dhaka, between January and September 2025, citing the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research.\n\nCdc Warns Of 'Enhanced' Virus Risk For Travelers Amid Outbreak Spread By Mosquitoes\n\nAs of late September, a total of 16,000 locally transmitted chikungunya cases have been confirmed in Guangdong Province, China, marking the largest documented outbreak of the disease in the country to date.\n\nBetween January and late September, 34 confirmed cases of chikungunya were reported in Cuba, and public health interventions have been implemented to contain the outbreak.\n\nIn Sri Lanka, a total of 150 confirmed chikungunya cases were reported between Jan. 1 and the second week of March 2025, WHO said, adding that cases reportedly peaked in June.\n\nThe CDC warned that Americans traveling to Brazil, Colombia, India, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Philippines and Thailand may also face an increased risk of chikungunya infection, even if no outbreak is currently reported.\n\nThe U.S. has not seen any locally acquired chikungunya cases in its states or territories since 2019.\n\nOriginal article",
