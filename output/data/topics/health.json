    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A leading U.S. health official on Sunday urged people to get inoculated against the measles at a time of outbreaks across several states and as the United States is at risk of losing its measles elimination status.\n\n“Take the vaccine, please,” said Dr. Mehmet Oz, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services administrator whose boss has raised suspicion about the safety and importance of vaccines. “We have a solution for our problem.”\n\nOz, a heart surgeon, defended some recently revised federal vaccine recommendations as well as past comments from President Donald Trump and the nation's health chief, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., about the efficacy of vaccines. From Oz, there was a clear message on the measles.\n\n“Not all illnesses are equally dangerous and not all people are equally susceptible to those illnesses,” he told CNN’s “State of the Union.” “But measles is one you should get your vaccine.”\n\nAn outbreak in South Carolina in the hundreds has surpassed the recorded case count in Texas’ 2025 outbreak, and there is also one on the Utah-Arizona border. Multiple other states have had confirmed cases this year. The outbreaks have mostly impacted children and have come as infectious disease experts warn that rising public distrust of vaccines generally may be contributing to the spread of a disease once declared eradicated by public health officials.\n\nAsked in the television interview whether people should fear the measles, Oz replied, “Oh, for sure.” He said Medicare and Medicaid will continue to cover the measles vaccine as part of the insurance programs.\n\n“There will never be a barrier to Americans get access to the measles vaccine. And it is part of the core schedule,” Oz said.\n\nBut Oz also said “we have advocated for measles vaccines all along” and that Kennedy “has been on the very front of this.”\n\nQuestions about vaccines did not come up later in a Kennedy interview on Fox News Channel's “The Sunday Briefing,” where he was asked about what kind of Super Bowl snack he might have (probably yogurt). He also he eats steak with sauerkraut in the mornings.\n\nCritics of Kennedy have argued that the health secretary's longtime skepticism of U.S. vaccine recommendations and past sympathy for the unfounded claim that vaccines may cause autism may influence official public health guidance in ways contrary to the medical consensus.\n\nOz argued that Kennedy's stance was supportive of the measles vaccine despite Kennedy's general comments about the recommended vaccine schedule.\n\n“When the first outbreak happened in Texas, he said, get your vaccines for measles, because that’s an example of an ailment that you should get vaccinated against,” Oz said.\n\nThe Republican administration last month dropped some vaccine recommendations for children, an overhaul of the traditional vaccine schedule that the Department of Health and Human Services said was in response to a request from Trump.\n\nTrump asked the agency to review how peer nations approach vaccine recommendations and consider revising U.S. guidance accordingly.\n\nStates, not the federal government, have the authority to require vaccinations for schoolchildren. While federal requirements often influence those state regulations, some states have begun creating their own alliances to counter the administration’s guidance on vaccines.\n\nU.S. vaccination rates have dropped and the share of children with exemptions has reached an all-time high, according to federal data. At the same time, rates of diseases that can be protected against with vaccines, such as measles and whooping cough, are rising across the country.\n\nKennedy's past anti-vaccine activism\n\nKennedy's past skepticism of vaccines has come under scrutiny since Trump first nominated him to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nDuring his Senate confirmation testimony last year, Kennedy told lawmakers that a closely scrutinized 2019 trip he took to Samoa, which came before a devastating measles outbreak, had “nothing to do with vaccines.”\n\nBut documents obtained by The Guardian and The Associated Press undermine that testimony. Emails sent by staffers at the U.S. Embassy and the United Nations said that Kennedy sought to meet with top Samoan officials during his trip to the Pacific island nation.\n\nSamoan officials later said Kennedy’s trip bolstered the credibility of anti-vaccine activists before the measles outbreak, which sickened thousands of people and killed 83, mostly children under age 5.\n\nMixed messaging on autism, vaccines\n\nOz's comments mark a broader pattern among administration officials of voicing discordant and at times contradictory statements about the efficacy of vaccines amid an overhaul of U.S. public health policy.\n\nOfficials have walked a fine line in criticizing past U.S. vaccine policy, often at times appearing to express sympathy for unfounded conspiracy theories from anti-vaccine activists, while also not straying too far from established science.\n\nDuring a Senate hearing Tuesday, Jay Bhattacharya, the director of the National Institutes of Health, said no single vaccine causes autism, but he did not rule out the possibility that research may find some combination of vaccines could have negative health side effects.\n\nBut Kennedy, in Senate testimony, has argued that a link between vaccines and autism has not been disproved.\n\nHe has previously claimed that some components of vaccines, like the mercury-containing preservative thimerosal, may cause childhood neurological disorders such as autism. Most vaccines for measles, mumps and rubella do not contain thimerosal. A federal vaccine advisory board overhauled by Kennedy last year voted to no longer recommend thimerosal-containing vaccines.\n\nAdministration public health officials often cite the need to restore trust in public health systems after the coronavirus pandemic, when vaccine policy and the general public health response to the deadly pandemic became a highly polarizing topic in American politics.\n\nMisinformation and conspiracy theories about the public health system also spread during the pandemic, and longtime anti-vaccine activist groups saw a swell in interest from the wider public.\n\nKennedy, who for years led the anti-vaccine activist group Children's Health Defense, has been criticized for ordering reviews of vaccines and public health guidelines that leading medical research groups have deemed settled science.\n\nPublic health experts also criticized the president for making unfounded claims about highly politicized health issues. During a September Oval Office event, Trump asserted without evidence that Tylenol and vaccines are linked to a rise in the incidence of autism in the United States.",

    "description": "Kim Kardashian's trainer explains how strength training transformed her mental health, career, and approach to fitness after immigration.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Senada Greca, founder of WeRise and cofounder of Aonic. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nAt least four times a week, I meet with Kim Kardashian for a personal training session. Today, we're focused on the upper body and core. Over our hour-and-a-half session, we'll do assisted pull-ups, hollow-body chest presses, face-pulls, and more. Kim likes to end most training sessions with a dead hang on the bar.\n\nI've been training Kim for three years now. I also help millions of other people (mostly women) through my training platform WeRise, and the fitness and nutrition videos I post on social media.\n\nStrength training is powerful, especially for women. Once you know the strength your body possesses, you'll understand how to feel good in your body, rather than feeling like you need to shrink or punish it. I know, because that's a change I've made myself.\n\nI'm the oldest of three girls, born in Albania. After the communist government was overthrown in the early 1990s, there was a lot of civil unrest. I remember the first time we heard gunshots. We hid under the bed, staying down for a long time.\n\nLuckily, my family won the green card lottery (Editor's note: The green card lottery is formally called the Diversity Visa Program, which provides up to 55,000 visas through random selection.), and we were able to immigrate to America in 1997 when I was 14. That helped set up a safer, more prosperous future for my sisters and me.\n\nAt the time, it was very challenging. I spoke with a heavy accent and dressed differently from my classmates in upstate New York, which led to a lot of bullying. Since I was the only one in the family who spoke English, I had to help my parents with legal documents, doctors' appointments, and getting my sisters into school. It was a lot.\n\nEverything in my life felt out of control. The one thing I could control was my eating, and not long after immigrating, I developed anorexia. Within a few years, I was also struggling with depression and anxiety. I was exercising, but only to punish my body.\n\nIn college, I connected with counseling and medication that helped me start getting healthy. The real turning point came when I was in my mid-20s and met a new primary care doctor. She was in her 50s, but running marathons every quarter. She taught me to think about exercise as a way to support mental health. I started running and became more physically and mentally stable.\n\nAbout 10 years ago, in my mid-30s, I started strength training. It changed my life, as I started using exercise to nourish myself.\n\nIn my immigrant family, financial security was always very important. I had a corporate job, and had never considered building something on my own — it just wasn't done.\n\nI started teaching yoga at night, and loved how my classes made people feel. In 2019, I began posting videos of my workouts, at first for myself. I was extremely consistent, which helped me grow a big following. When the pandemic happened, my following grew exponentially as people looked for workouts they could do at home.\n\nIn 2020, I launched my website and began charging for memberships. I quickly saw that my fitness business could be stable and successful. That gave me the courage to quit my corporate job to follow my passion. In the years since, my audience has only grown, and I've had amazing opportunities, like training Kim.\n\nToday, I'm in the best shape of my life — physically and mentally — at 43. I don't often talk about my age, because I feel ageless and don't want to define myself by a number. At the same time, I want to show that getting older doesn't have to mean winding down.",

    "description": "BBC health correspondent James Gallagher gets his blood analysed to understand how air pollution is killing us.",
    "fullText": "I'm in a laboratory staring at my blood under a microscope. Rather than pristine red blood cells, some of them have been tainted with black markings. I'm now one of the first people in the world to see air pollution building up inside their body.\n\nLess than an hour ago I was standing next to four lanes of busy central London traffic. It was the type of road where you can taste the air and you're left with a gritty sensation in your mouth.\n\nI had volunteered to stand there for 10 minutes; breathing in dirty air as part of an experiment to understand how air pollution is affecting our bodies and damaging our health.\n\nIn the UK, poor air quality is thought to kill 30,000 people a year, as well as harming babies in the womb and exacerbating conditions from asthma to dementia.\n\nMost of the air pollution I was breathing in came from traffic – billowing invisibly out of exhaust pipes, but also released by the wear and tear of tyres and brakes.\n\nProf Jonathan Grigg, from Queen Mary University of London, calls this spot his \"exposure chamber\".\n\nShouting over the blare of revving engines and sirens, he tells me most people incorrectly assume air pollution is all filtered out by our nose or mouth, or is trapped and then brought up out of the lungs.\n\n\"What we're looking at is whether the smallest particles are not only staying in your lung, but moving across into your bloodstream and going around your body,\" says Grigg.\n\nAfter our dose of London air, we head back to the laboratory where I have my finger pricked and a sample of blood prepared for examination.\n\nUnder the microscope, we can easily see the red disc-shaped cells that transport oxygen around our bodies.\n\nIt takes a few minutes for me to get my eyes in, but then the air pollution becomes apparent. It appears as tiny black dots stuck to the red blood cells.\n\nThese are pieces of carbon and other chemicals, like a miniature lump of coal, that come from the incomplete burning of fuel. They're known as PM 2.5, because the particles are smaller than 2.5 micrometres.\n\nI'm not surprised to see air pollution, it's why we're doing the experiment, but I can't escape a feeling of being dirtied, contaminated… sullied by it.\n\nResearcher Dr Norrice Liu has looked at more than a dozen volunteers' blood samples as part of a study.\n\nOn average, one in every two to three thousand red blood cells had picked up a hitch-hiking piece of pollution.\n\nThat might not sound like much, but scale it up to the full five litres of blood in an adult and the researchers estimate there could be 80 million red blood cells transporting pollution around our bodies.\n\n\"It's a bit upsetting to see that, isn't it?\" says Liu. \"Every time I walk by a busy road, now I'm thinking how much of this is travelling around my body… you just feel like you don't want to be out on the road much.\"\n\nI stood beside the road for just 10 minutes. It was busy, but it was not an extreme scenario. Your blood has probably looked like this too.\n\nThe team at Queen Mary University of London have shown that levels of air pollution in the blood come back down after about two hours of breathing clean air.\n\nGrigg was \"pretty shocked\" the air pollution was so visible in blood, but says the important question is where it's going.\n\nIt's not being breathed back out, he says, some may be filtered out by the kidneys and leave the body in urine. But the most likely answer is that particles of pollution are \"wiggling their way through the lining of the blood vessels and lodging in various organs\".\n\nThis research is starting to explain why air pollution has been linked to so many health problems far beyond the lungs, including in the brain and for babies still in the womb.\n\nDeposits of black carbon from air pollution have been found in the human body including in placentas analysed after birth.\n\n\"There's no reason why it's choosing one organ over another,\" says Liu, \"so chances are they're everywhere.\"\n\nAnd there are other forms of air pollution, such as nitrogen oxides, which are gases and are not visible down the microscope, but are known to cause harm.\n\nThe World Health Organization says 99% of the world population breathes in polluted air leading to seven million deaths a year. A report by the Royal College of Physicians estimates the figure for the UK is 30,000 deaths a year.\n\nSir Stephen Holgate, who led that report, said there was no doubt air pollution was damaging our health - \"it's nailed, it's game set and match\" - and the clearest evidence was coming from areas that were cutting air pollution and seeing the benefit.\n\nBut now that air pollution is \"largely invisible\", unlike the smogs of yesteryear, most of us don't realise we're breathing it in and \"don't really understand that air pollution on a daily basis is damaging\", he says.\n\nAir pollution has been linked to harms throughout our lives and throughout our bodies.\n\nThere are many ways dirty air can harm the other organs of our body, but triggering inflammation is thought to be the main one. Inflammation is our body's natural response to injury and infection, but can also affect blood vessels to make heart attacks and strokes more likely.\n\nInflammation in the lungs has been shown to wake up dormant cancerous cells, which then develop into deadly tumours. Around one in 10 lung cancers are thought to be caused by air pollution in the UK.\n\nEven while in the womb, air pollution is even thought to alter how a developing baby's DNA is functioning during critical stages of development.\n\n\"There's a very sensitive period when air pollution can cause a problem and it undoubtedly does: small lungs, small heart and some problems with brain development,\" says Sir Stephen.\n\nAt the other end of life, components of air pollution seem to be \"accelerating the process\" of dementia, he says, by helping plaques of toxic proteins form inside the brain.\n\nThere is advice on how to minimise our exposure to air pollution - including walking on quieter side streets or keeping away from the edge of the road so you're further from traffic. This is especially important for babies in buggies, who are much closer to the height of exhaust pipes.\n\nGrigg's study showed a tight-fitting FFP2 mask led to less air pollution in the blood, but \"we're not saying that everyone should wear a mask\", says Grigg, adding some clinically vulnerable people including those \"recovering from a heart attack or have chronic respiratory disease\" might benefit while in areas of high pollution.\n\nBut the tricky thing with air pollution is you're often breathing in the pollution caused by other people. It is not easy to just live somewhere else if your house is on a busy road.\n\nChanges to cars – not just sales of electric vehicles, but emissions standards on newer diesel and petrol engines – are improving air quality.\n\nBut Grigg says: \"I think the more we understand the mechanisms of how it can cause these effects, the more we can add to the pressure for policy makers to reduce exposure - because that's the answer in the end.\"\n\nInside Health was produced by Tom Bonnett",

    "fullText": "AT&T is hoping to entice parents concerned about screentime with a smartphone designed for children. Whether children will be enticed is another question.\n\nThe telecommunications company debuted the amiGO Jr. Phone on Friday. The company says it will give parents greater control over how their children interact with smartphones. The rollout also featured the new amiGO Jr. Watch 2.\n\n\"Putting customers at the center of our business means anticipating what comes next — not just responding to what already exists,\" Erin Scarborough, the senior vice president of Revenue Management & Commercialization at AT&T, said in a press release. \"As smartphones become a daily necessity, parents have made it clear they need better tools to help their children navigate the digital world safely.\"\n\nAfter purchasing the smartphone, parents can download an app that allows them to set several safety features. They include location tracking, up to 30 pre-approved contacts, established safe zones, customizable controls for each device, and \"schedules to limit distractions during school hours.\"\n\nThe app can also implement safety features on AT&T's amiGO Jr tablet, which the company released in 2024.\n\nAT&T collaborated with Samsung to build the smartphone's hardware. The smartphone costs $209.99.\n\nIn the age of smartphones, parents have raised concerns over the tech's impact on children's and teens' mental health.\n\nA 2025 study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that teenagers who had higher non-schoolwork-related screentime were more likely to have \"adverse health outcomes,\" including irregular sleep routines, depression symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and insufficient peer support.\n\nAccess to social media on smartphones is also a concern. Over a dozen attorneys general filed lawsuits against TikTok in 2024, accusing the social media platform of targeting young users with addictive algorithms and features. Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, has also faced legal action over the platform's potentially harmful impact on young users.\n\nAs a result, parents have sought different ways to navigate the complex technology landscape. Some parents have invested in products like Gabb, a kid-friendly smartphone, while others have purchased landline phones created for children. Dumb phones, which don't have social media and other advanced app functions, have emerged as another option.\n\nA growing number of young folks are also ditching smart devices as part of a movement embracing real-life connections and a healthy relationship with technology.\n\n\"I feel like I've spent so much of my early life glued to a screen. I find it particularly addicting and incredibly dangerous,\" a Gen Z woman told Business Insider in 2025. \"I think we need to be worried about the repercussions this will have on both individuals and society.\"",

    "description": "I hate when influencers are right about something.",
    "fullText": "When Owala water bottles started appearing in every influencer's \"daily essentials\" video and cluttering my Instagram feed, I rolled my eyes. I assumed this was another overhyped product that people would forget about in three months, just the latest in a long line of Stanley Cup successors.\n\nOne of my biggest personality quirks (or \"flaws,\" according to some) is that I'm a major spiller. The Stanley Cup's open straw is a non-starter for me. In fact, no water bottle technology has been stronger than my ability to spill its contents. After watching my latest bottle create yet another puddle in my bag, I caved and bought an Owala. And now, I have to admit this water bottle is officially an upgrade in my life.\n\nI'm a huge fan of the FreeSip lid—yes, that's what they call it, and yes, it lives up to the name—is genuinely brilliant in its simplicity. There's a built-in straw for when you want to sip without tilting (perfect for walking, driving, or my personal use case: lying horizontally on the couch). Flip it open a bit more, and there's a wide-mouth spout for when you want to chug. One lid, two drinking options, and crucially, a push-button lock that has saved my laptop, my physical planner, and my dignity. Seriously, I cannot emphasize this enough: I am a world-class spiller. The Owala's lock mechanism is the only thing standing between me and constant catastrophe.\n\nAt 24 ounces, it's the perfect size—big enough that I'm not refilling it every hour, small enough that it actually fits in my bag's side pocket and doesn't make me look like I'm headed out for a weekend camping trip when I'm just going to run errands. It's become my constant companion without feeling like I'm lugging around gym equipment.\n\nSometimes the influencers are onto something. And now I'm part of the problem, becoming the exact person who won't shut up about their water bottle. But when you find something that solves multiple persistent problems at once, when a product actually delivers on its promises instead of just looking good in photos, it's hard not to evangelize a little. The Owala works. I'm staying hydrated, my bag is staying dry, and I'm sipping with ease wherever I go.",

These metrics can be made visible in a project-driven dashboard, a live operating system that tracks the real-time health, velocity, and strategic alignment of a transformation portfolio.

    "description": "Scotland players tell BBC Sport their mental health suffered after they were told their contracts would end following the World Cup.",
    "fullText": "When Scotland left the pitch following their gutsy 2025 Women's Rugby World Cup quarter-final defeat by England, for some of the squad it was a moment of pride that marked how far the team had come.\n\nFor others the full-time whistle signalled the end of an emotionally damaging tournament from which some say they are still struggling to recover.\n\nReaching the last eight was the team's best performance at a World Cup in 23 years.\n\nHowever, players have since told BBC Sport that behind the scenes Scottish Rugby's management of player contracts before the tournament left them in \"probably the worst case of mental health\" they had ever had, with one saying she suffered a breakdown as a result.\n\n\"I had an actual real-life breakdown in club to one of my coaches,\" she said.\n\n\"I've been put on medication for depression because of the impact that it's had on me.\"\n\nAnother said: \"I came back from the World Cup in a hole, a shell of myself.\"\n\nIn response, Scottish Rugby said the union was \"aware of the potential challenges players faced in their mental health during this time\" and that a package of support was put in place.\n\n\"We would not question the personal experience of an individual athlete,\" the union's response continued.\n\n\"We would, however, dispute the lack of care referenced.\"\n\nBBC Sport spoke to four players involved in the World Cup and one who was in the wider Scotland training squad. Contributors wished to remain anonymous out of fear of jeopardising their future in the sport.\n\nPlayers said their contracts were due for renewal in June 2025, two months before the World Cup began in August, and that they had asked for 12-month deals beyond that to ensure job security and so they could focus on their performances at the tournament.\n\nHowever, according to those contacted, while some players in Scotland's 32-player World Cup squad were given 12-month contracts in May 2025, a quarter were told their deals would end in October, a decision one player described as a \"big shock\".\n\nAt the time, contracts ranged from £18,000 to £27,000 and in most cases were the player's main source of income. Those playing in the Premiership could also earn up to about £10,000 from their club contracts.\n\nThe players who spoke to BBC Sport said that having to compete at the World Cup knowing their jobs and international careers were potentially about to come to an end put them under huge mental strain.\n\nThey also said they were not given the proper support by Scottish Rugby to cope with the situation.\n\nSome of those who were told they would lose their funding after October had been part of the Scotland team for many years and were regularly starting international matches.\n\nOne said that \"despite clear signs\" that some were suffering with the news, \"no transitional help\" was offered by Scottish Rugby.\n\nAnother said she spent downtime between World Cup matches searching for a job.\n\nIn 2025 Scottish Rugby said it would increase the number of contracts available to players from 32 to 35 for the 2025-26 season.\n\nOne player said \"everybody understands contracts aren't going to be guaranteed every year\", before questioning why Scottish Rugby did not provide access to career advisors or psychologists for those affected.\n\nAnother added: \"It's not about contracts. It's not about resources. It's literally about treating people like human beings.\"\n\nScottish Rugby's response stated that psychological support was embedded in Scotland camps and available to all players regardless of contract status.\n\nIt said a player development manager supported players on off-field matters, including employment, and that exit meetings were held at the end of contracts to identify any potential physical or psychological support that may be needed.\n\nAsked if she felt Scottish Rugby had failed in its duty of care to players, one player responded \"without a doubt\" and referenced the death of international Siobhan Cattigan aged 26 in 2021.\n\n\"How many people need to die before you take it seriously?\" she added, addressing Scottish Rugby. \"You've clearly not learned.\"\n\nCattigan's family said undetected rugby-related brain damage caused a \"catastrophic decline\" in her health and led to her death.\n\nIn 2023 Scottish Rugby said it \"let down\" Cattigan's family and chairman John McGuigan apologised \"wholeheartedly for any anguish we caused Siobhan during her time with Scottish Rugby\".\n\nMcGuigan added at the time: \"We have listened and heeded the lessons and, in Siobhan's memory, commit to making changes to ensure we are a better organisation in the future.\"\n\nAnother player said the communication of selection decisions left her \"unbelievably unwell\", adding: \"There are loads of harsh realities of elite sport: injury and non-selection. How you manage people is more important than ever.\n\n\"You can't treat people like they're just disposable, regardless of the elite sport wheel being a forever turning one.\n\n\"We still need to have empathy. And I just didn't feel like there was much at all.\"\n\nScottish Rugby's response to this story said: \"We are very uncomfortable with this comparison to Siobhan's own tragic situation and the inference in any way that we were negligent in our support to her.\"\n\nPlayers told BBC Sport that the squad discussed boycotting one match during the 2025 Women's Six Nations - five months before the World Cup began - to try to reach a resolution with Scottish Rugby on its request for 12-month contracts.\n\nAll the players contacted say they were told contract decisions were based on performance and that they may still get a new contract should they perform well at the tournament, adding further pressure.\n\n\"It literally was a do or die lifeline,\" one player said.\n\n\"It's like I need to do everything I can on this rugby pitch, otherwise I'm not going to have a job and I'm going to struggle to pay my rent.\n\n\"When you're not sleeping, you don't have an appetite. You're just miserable most of the day. It's really hard to then put in a performance or do yourself justice.\"\n\nScottish Rugby's response said that players were told \"on a number of occasions that their standalone playing performance at the World cup was not the sole criteria for any possible change to their contract situation\".\n\nTold her contract would end in October, one player said she was on job search websites \"most nights\" during the tournament looking for jobs \"that were appropriate\" for her life as a club rugby player.\n\nShe said: \"Before you even started a job, you're trying to bargain and speak with a new employer and be like, 'Can I finish at this time?' Because I have to actually go to my other job [club rugby training].\n\n\"Then I'm going to come in tired in the morning because I've not got into bed until midnight.\"\n\nPlayers no longer on contracts can still represent Scotland, but they now fall under the country's National Team Agreement, which offers them £75 a day, not including rest days, for attending Scotland training camps.\n\nOne player said \"she can't be involved\" for that amount, adding: \"I won't be able to afford to pay my mortgage.\"\n\nAnother player said concerns over her future took \"an emotional toll\", adding: \"I didn't want to be there. I look back on it with exhaustion. It was such a big opportunity but I have nothing but negative thoughts around it.\n\n\"[After the tournament] I removed myself from social settings, any settings where people could ask me loads about rugby.\n\n\"If I did get into that environment, I would try to remove myself as quickly as possible because it made me panic and stress.\"\n\nThe player said Scotland Rugby had not been in contact about any follow-up support.\n\n\"There's been no kind of input about, 'do you need psychology?' or anything like that,\" she said.\n\nScottish Rugby detailed the steps put in place to support players:\n\nAccess to clinical psychology and a player development manager.\n\nA mandatory medical exit meeting to \"identify any potential physical or psychological support\".\n\nAn independent HR exit interview and a six-week post-contract window to access \"exit support services\" if needed.\n\nScottish Rugby said: \"From the outset of this process we recognised that players - particularly those whose contracts were due to end - would need additional support during the Rugby World Cup period and in planning their next steps.\n\n\"We believe we did deliver on our duty of care by the provision of both psychological and career guidance support throughout 2025, including in the lead-up to and during, the RWC.\n\n\"The entire playing group were out of contract in June 2025 and we made the decision to extend all contracts through to the end of October 2025 to provide a degree of stability through the RWC itself.\n\n\"The timings involved were designed to give clarity to all players as early as possible, following a timeline agreed and requested by the players themselves.\"\n\nListen to the latest Rugby Union Weekly podcast",

    "description": "The World Health Organization found that nearly 40% of cancer cases worldwide are linked to preventable causes.",
    "fullText": "A new report from the World Health Organization found that nearly 7 million cases of cancer worldwide were preventable.\n\nAnalyzing 18.7 million new cancer cases in 2022 (the most recent data available to them), researchers found that nearly 4 out of 10 cases were linked to 30 modifiable risk factors, including smoking tobacco, infections like HPV and hepatitis B, and consuming alcohol. Stomach, lung, and cervical cancer accounted for almost half of all preventable cancers in the report.\n\nThe findings are a comprehensive assessment of cancer cases globally, which vary greatly by region, so while promising, they come with limitations. \n\nThe news comes less than two weeks after it was revealed that colon cancer is now the leading cause of cancer death in people under 50.\n\nCancer can be caused by a variety of factors, including family history, genetic mutations, and environmental pollutants — all things out of our control — but some risk can be mitigated with lifestyle modifications.\n\nResearch shows that diets involving lots of ultra-processed foods (UPFs) are linked to higher cancer risk. They can increase inflammation and disrupt the gut microbiome, increasing the risk of colon and ovarian cancer.\n\nA diet rich in whole foods is the best way to go. Dr. Daniel Landau, an oncologist specializing in genitourinary cancers, previously told Business Insider that he mostly follows the Mediterranean diet, focusing on lean protein, fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, and legumes while limiting red meat (which might be carcinogenic), dairy, alcohol, sugar, and UPFs.\n\nGut-healthy foods are also important. Dr. Susan Bullman, an associate professor at MD Anderson Cancer Center who specializes in gut health and cancer research, previously told Business Insider that she eats fiber-rich foods like pears and probiotics like kefir to feed beneficial gut microbes. Eating a wide variety of plants, such as swapping out vegetable sides or sprinkling seeds on top of salads, can also improve gut health.\n\nExercise has long been associated with a reduced risk of cancer. One 2025 trial found that a strict workout regimen for preventing colon cancer resurgence than expensive treatments like chemotherapy. While scientists are still exploring the reasons why exercise is so effective at cancer prevention, they have their theories. Dr. Paul Oberstein, a medical oncologist at NYU Langone, previously told Business Insider that exercise is probably reducing inflammation, which may help slow tumor growth.\n\nDr. Sue Hwang, an oncologist who was diagnosed with breast cancer, said you should aim for 30 minutes of exercise a day, whether it's strength training or cardio.\n\nIf you can't make it to a gym every day, she said, even taking a walk or playing with your kids in a playground helps. Even vigorous daily movements, like climbing up stairs or carrying heavy groceries, can cut down cancer risk. Still, the best thing you can do is pencil in real workouts.\n\nBeing aware of early cancer symptoms, like blood in your stool for colon cancer, can help you seek screenings earlier than the recommended starting age.\n\nIt's also important to be aware of your family history, any genetic mutations like Lynch syndrome that increase risks of several cancers, or other factors like PCOS for endometrial cancer.\n\nDr. Thaïs Aliabadi, an OB-GYN who helped Olivia Munn get diagnosed with stage 1 breast cancer, said collecting data on your body, such as previous biopsies or breast density, can help you better assess your risk.",

    "description": "\"An important step toward protecting both environmental and human health.\"",
    "fullText": "Researchers are sounding the alarm after finding antibiotic resistance genes released from melting Antarctic glaciers.\n\nA study published in the journal Biocontaminant examined the effects of glacial melting on our water supply.\n\nGlaciers serve as reservoirs for antibiotic resistance genes, or ARGs, and other microbes. When they are released from the ice, they enter our water systems, posing a major health risk to people downstream.\n\nMillions of people get their water from glacier-fed rivers and lakes. ARGs are strands of DNA that make bacteria more resistant to drugs. When ARGs in meltwater make their way into our water supply, they become a global public health risk.\n\nThe study emphasizes the importance of viewing glaciers, rivers, and lakes as being part of a \"glacier continuum.\" This means they are an interconnected system rather than separate environments.\n\nFrom our gas-powered cars to overconsumption, human activity has contributed to the production of heat-trapping gases that warm the planet. Rising global temperatures have caused glaciers to rapidly melt, causing elevated sea levels and releasing ARGs.\n\nARGs from melting glaciers are worrisome because they help facilitate the spread of diseases. This threat is compounded by the fact that our growing microplastic problem is also helping antibiotic-resistant bacteria breed. As a result, medicines are being rendered less effective.\n\nOne way we can combat warming temperatures is by making more eco-friendly lifestyle choices. This might include installing solar panels, which can help you slash utility rates and cut energy-related pollution.\n\nTCD's Solar Explorer curates competitive bids from vetted installers, saving you up to $10,000 on installation. EnergySage, a TCD partner, provides a free service that helps people find installers, save thousands, and understand available incentives.\n\nOngoing research into the effects of glacial melt helps us understand and approach the problem of ARGs.\n\nWhat's the most you'd pay per month to put solar panels on your roof if there was no down payment?\n\nI'd only do it if someone else paid for it\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\n\"Climate change is reshaping microbial risks in ways we are only beginning to understand,\" study co-author Guannan Mao of Lanzhou University told The Microbiologist.\n\n\"Recognizing glaciers as part of the global antibiotic resistance landscape is an important step toward protecting both environmental and human health.\"\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

We remain focused on serving our customers,\" founder Peter Rahal wrote on X.\n\nAttia was also named among 19 new CBS News contributors just days before the emails between him and Epstein were made public. CBS editor in chief Bari Weiss has since faced public calls to cut ties with him.\n\nCBS News and David Protein could not be reached for comment.\n\nIn emails from 2015 and 2016, included in the latest release, Attia used joking and familiar language with Epstein, including references to Epstein's \"outrageous\" lifestyle and a crude sexual joke.\n\nOn Monday, Attia issued a public apology, calling some of the emails \"embarrassing, tasteless, and indefensible,\" and saying he was \"ashamed of myself for everything about this.\"\n\nAttia, 52, is a well-known antiaging and longevity expert with roughly 1.6 million Instagram followers.\n\n\"I am not asking anyone to ignore the emails or pretend they aren't ugly,\" he wrote on X. \"They simply are.\"\n\nHe said he was not involved in any criminal activity and said his interactions with Epstein had nothing to do with Epstein's sexual abuse or exploitation.\n\n\"The man I am today, roughly ten years later, would not write them and would not associate with Epstein at all,\" he said.",

    "description": "Dr. Adam Perlman prioritizes strength training, sleep, and a low-sugar diet to boost his metabolic health.",
    "fullText": "When he was first starting his physician training, Dr. Adam Perlman had a daily ritual: ordering a very sugary coffee.\n\n\"I'm from Boston, so I'd go to Dunkin' Donuts and drink my coffee with cream and three sugars,\" Perlman, 59, told Business Insider.\n\nNow an integrative and functional medicine doctor and former chief medical officer for Mayo Clinic's integrative medicine program, his habits changed as he learned more about his health.\n\n\"I went from cream and two sugars, to cream and one sugar, to artificial sweeteners, and those weren't good for you, so I learned to drink it without that,\" he said, eventually eliminating dairy creamer as well because it upset his stomach. Now, he uses a sugar-free, oat milk-based creamer. \"I made these changes over time, and I think that's really important because then they become a part of your routine, and they stick.\"\n\nEven now, he said, new research, like what we're learning about the gut microbiome's roles in metabolic health, inspires him to gradually tweak his lifestyle. \"I didn't think about probiotics as it related to metabolism up until just a few years ago,\" he said.\n\nBased on his work, he shared three habits he's worked into his daily routine to boost his metabolism and aid in fat loss.\n\nPerlman's years of research and work experience led him to think of his diet like a budget.\n\n\"Protein and vegetables, they're kind of like my mortgage and utilities,\" he said. Perlman, who strength trains and practices martial arts like Krav Maga almost every day, focuses a lot on protein, which builds muscle. He likes leaner protein sources like chicken, turkey, and lower-mercury tuna, which can help lower cholesterol compared to red meat.\n\nAs for ultra-processed foods or products with added sugar and simple carbohydrates, \"those for me are impulse purchases. Easy to overspend, and they don't necessarily pay the dividends.\" He drinks seltzer instead of sugary drinks and often snacks on frozen grapes.\n\nOver the past few years, he added a \"microbiome twist\" to his diet: making sure he also eats a wide variety of plants and fermented foods like Greek yogurt throughout the week, as good gut health is linked to metabolic health.\n\n\"I'm less about counting or tracking and more about just trying to keep things colorful, sort of eat a rainbow,\" he said. For example, he tries to buy a range of fresh produce when he shops — like sweet potatoes, sugar snap peas, and green beans — and adds raisins to his favorite broccoli slaw to include more plant diversity in his meals.\n\nIn the past few years, Perlman has made tweaks to his sleep routine, as keeping a consistent schedule helps regulate hormones and promote a healthy metabolism.\n\nHe installed blackout shades, bought a new noise machine, and cools down the temperature in his bedroom before he winds down. \"The body likes a little cooler temperature when you're falling asleep,\" he said.\n\nHe also started setting boundaries around his sleep. Sometimes, he'll watch a show with his wife and she'll ask if he wants to start another episode. If it's getting late — around 9 or 9:30 p.m. — \"It's not uncommon for me to say, 'If you don't mind, why don't we hold off?'\" Instead, he'll read in bed until he falls asleep.\n\nHis most recent change is focusing more on stress in his daily life, which can slow metabolism and promote the production of visceral fat.\n\nWhile he said his morning exercise routine certainly helps, he wanted to do more.\n\n\"I'm on day 42 of starting with some mindfulness in the morning,\" he said. He uses a guided meditation app and dedicates 10 to 15 minutes when he wakes up, wearing headphones so as not to wake his wife.\n\n\"It's newer for me,\" he said. \"I'm just kind of playing with it and seeing how that feels in my routine.\"",

    "fullText": "You wouldn't wait until your 50s to start saving for retirement — so why wait until your heart is already at risk to start protecting it?\n\nHeart disease is spiking among younger people, in part because people in their 20s, 30s, and 40s are procrastinating on their health, according to Dr. Sadiya Khan.\n\nKhan, a professor of cardiovascular epidemiology at Northwestern University, told Business Insider that changes to your diet and exercise habits now can pay big dividends as you age.\n\n\"You can't just become older and then hope to make all these changes,\" she said.\n\nThe earlier you understand your heart health, the better equipped you are to make healthy decisions for future you.\n\nRight now, most of us are behind in our investments to our cardiovascular health. The average American's heart is 4 to 7 years older than their calendar age, according to Khan's research.\n\n\"All of us are naturally driven to procrastinate,\" she said. \"You try to worry about the things that are immediately in front of you, and it's harder to prioritize and give as much attention to something that is a long-term consequence.\n\nAn online tool, developed by Khan and her team, helps forecast a person's risk of heart attack or stroke over the next 30 years by illustrating how they stack up to their peers. It shows their percentile rank for heart health: in other words, out of 100 people the same age and sex, how many have a higher or lower risk of cardiovascular disease.\n\nKhan said the new tool uniquely uses percentiles to help people manage their health by understanding their risk and making changes if needed. Patients can then prioritize which habits provide the best bang for their buck in terms of health benefits, starting with what Khan recommends most.\n\nKhan said a big challenge with heart health is that it can be highly individualized. All the factors involved — diet, exercise habits, genetics, and stress — can vary widely from person to person.\n\n\"It's not going to be a one-size-fits-all,\" she said. \"It's this overarching goal that we need to personalize how we communicate risk and how we can share that information in a way that works for each patient.\"\n\nThat makes it hard to recommend a specific game plan to boost everyone's heart health. However, there are a few strategies that can pay off for most people.\n\nFor best results, try to make small, sustainable changes that you can keep up over time.\n\n\"It depends on what works for you and what you are able to stick with,\" Khan said. \"They all matter, but you don't also need to do it all at once.\"",

    "description": "The health reporter Kim Schewitz often feels tired, and hoped tracking her blood sugar levels using a continuous glucose monitor would help. Then the app told her to do calf raises for 15 minutes.",
    "fullText": "Blood sugar is a hot topic, and after months of watching content waxing lyrical about \"balancing it,\" I needed to know if it was true that tracking my glucose levels would help boost my energy.\n\nSo with a few taps on my laptop, I ordered a continuous glucose monitor: a small white disk carrying a tiny needle, which charts blood sugar levels in near real-time via an app.\n\nDesigned for people with diabetes to closely monitor their glucose levels and prevent potentially life-threatening fluctuations, in recent years, they've become a buzzy lifestyle wearable marketed at healthy people.\n\nGlucose is our primary energy source, which we get from carbohydrates in food and drink. The body uses it for energy, and anything that's left over is stored in the muscles, liver, or fat cells for later use. Sugary snacks and simple carbs like white pasta tend to lead to bigger blood sugar spikes, while pairing carbs with protein, fats, and fiber has been found to smooth out the curve.\n\nThe term \"glucose spike\" has become a dirty word, as wellness influencers say that peaks and troughs lead to weight gain, energy crashes, and cravings. In turn, there are plenty of personal anecdotes online — but limited evidence — that \"balancing\" blood sugar by keeping it stable has helped people lose weight, feel happier and more energetic, sleep better, and avoid chronic disease.\n\nDespite following a pretty balanced diet — I eat protein and plenty of fiber with most meals, and few ultra-processed foods — I'm often tired and lacking energy. I was curious to see if the longevity bros were onto something, and if wearing a CGM for two weeks could provide any helpful insights.\n\nThe experience started with the sharp scratch of the CGM needle puncturing my skin. I held the plastic applicator to the back of my left arm, pressed down, and before I knew it, was branded with a white plastic circle. It stayed there for two weeks, measuring the glucose levels in the fluid around my cells and sending the data via Bluetooth to a line chart on my phone. I felt very aware of the CGM when my arms were exposed in public, which made me feel a little self-conscious.\n\nAt the beginning, it was exciting having access to this new metric, and the first thing I did was eat a rich chocolate truffle.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the little line on the chart — representing my glucose level — started moving sharply up, but I was pleased to see that it stayed within the healthy range of 3.9 mmol/L to 7.8 mmol/L. This was delineated on the chart by two dotted lines, which made it easy to see if I was having what would be considered a glucose spike or dip.\n\nThe line moved every time I ate or drank something other than water, exercised, or felt stressed (both can affect glucose levels).\n\nI ate normally to get an idea of my typical daily blood glucose levels, and in hindsight see that I quickly fell into the trap of judging meals as \"good\" or \"bad\" based on their effect. I know that's not a healthy way to think of food, but I guess I subconsciously believed the reductionist idea that any rise in blood sugar should be avoided. In fact, fluctuations within the healthy range (and sometimes outside of it) are just a normal part of digestion.\n\nSo I was pleased when my go-to breakfast didn't cause a spike, but surprised when the flat white coffee with 2% milk that I drank before it caused the level to rise as much as my entire breakfast.\n\nI didn't love that my protein and fiber-rich lunch of ground turkey and black bean chili with red rice sent my line close to the top of the healthy range, but reasoned that was probably because it was larger than my breakfast. I felt particularly disheartened when a dinner of soba noodles, which are made from buckwheat flour (complex carbs), and tofu (protein) in broth with cabbage (fiber) marked the first sharp spike.\n\nI was even more confused when the chili caused a huge spike and the noodles didn't when I ate the same lunch and dinner the next day.\n\nMy blood sugar didn't exceed the healthy range many times, but when it did, it was after I consumed:\n\nI would consider half of these balanced meals, but according to my chart, they raised my blood sugar more than the sweet treats like cake and a brownie that I ate during the two weeks. Maybe that's to be expected, but, without an expert to explain the data, I didn't know.\n\nOn reflection, I underestimated how complicated it would be to decipher this data and apply it to my life healthily. My glucose levels fluctuated more than I expected and it wasn't always clear to me why.\n\nThe app did explain that a healthy person's blood sugar tends to be outside of the healthy range for up to two hours per day, but I wasn't sure if an unsteady line within the safe zone was worrying or not (a nutrition researcher I spoke to since reassured me that it is not).\n\nIn terms of my energy levels, I noticed that I felt better on weekdays when I ate three square meals a day around the same time than weekends, when I tended to skip breakfast and eat a big meal around 2 or 3 p.m. This was reflected in my blood sugar levels, but I'm not sure I needed a CGM to figure that out.\n\nThe urge to check how my body reacted to food after a few bites quickly became a compulsion. Even though I understood a spike wasn't necessarily bad, I still felt encouraged by the app to keep my line as straight as possible.\n\nIt set me a daily target to stay within, at first based on averages and after a week based on my levels. It would tell me to do 15 squats, five to 10 minutes of calf raises, or take a brisk walk, when my glucose started rising (research suggests these movements can bring it down). I tried to go on walks, and did the squats on two occasions, but I drew the line at 10 minutes of calf raises.\n\nThe app was purportedly helping me to make my diet even healthier, but I became hyperfixated on a single metric that I didn't really understand.\n\nI felt a pang of dread every time I ate, knowing my glucose levels would rise and the app would watch and prescribe me exercise like some kind of punishment. It felt like the only way to keep my glucose stable would be to unnecessarily overhaul my already healthy diet.\n\nI intended to spend the second half of the experiment trying to avoid spikes and observing if I felt more alert and focused. That was before I realized that optimizing your health means aiming for constantly shifting goal posts. Once you perfect one metric, you simply move onto the next.\n\nHaving too many blood sugar spikes over time can increase the risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and heart disease. But diabetes experts previously told Business Insider that glucose monitoring isn't necessary for people without the disease and that it can cause unnecessary anxiety.\n\nIt's possible that cutting out all refined sugar and eating plainer, simpler meals would help me focus a little better. But I already track my sleep, go for a daily lunchtime walk, do a weekly run, eat 30 plants a week, and stop drinking caffeine after 1 p.m, in the name of my health.\n\nMaybe it was the invasive nature of sleeping with a needle in my arm, or the Black Mirror-ness of my phone tracking my bloodwork, but I suddenly felt I was on the border between healthy and obsessive. That isn't somewhere I want to be.",

    "fullText": "Hundreds of parents, teens and school districts have claimed social media is intentionally addictive and harmful\n\nSocial media companies will have to answer to a jury – for the first time – for allegations that their products are intentionally addictive and harmful to young users’ mental health. Hundreds of parents, teens and school districts sued Meta, Snap, TikTok and YouTube, leading to a series of landmark trials that began this week. Jury selection in the first case started on Tuesday in Los Angeles court.\n\nMeta’s Mark Zuckerberg is among the big tech CEOs who are expected to testify. Both sides are likely to bring in experts to hash out the science behind alleged addiction to social media.\n\nThe initial trial involves a 20-year-old, identified by the initials KGM, who alleges she experienced physical and emotional harm after becoming addicted to social media at age 10. This case is expected to last six to eight weeks, and will be the first of about 22 “bellwether” trials. The outcome can signal, and influence, how courts and juries may handle similar lawsuits in the future. Snap and TikTok have settled with the plaintiff in the first case, leaving Meta and YouTube to stand trial.\n\n“Everybody’s looking at it as a data point,” said Benjamin Zipursky, a law professor at Fordham University.\n\nThe legal proceedings follow years of heated criticism of tech companies from angry parents; they blame social networks for causing eating disorders, suicidal thoughts and anxiety in their children. The companies lay blame on the victims, plaintiffs’ lawyers and supporters say: “The tech companies blame parents for not being good parents,” said Sacha Haworth, executive director of the Tech Oversight Project, which has been involved in advocacy work for the plaintiffs. “Their experience has shown that you can be the best parent in the world – you can have conversations, you can limit screen time, you can turn on the bullshit parental controls – and your kid still dies.”\n\nThe cases and future settlements could eventually change the way social media platforms work; plaintiffs are asking for money, as well as injunctive relief that would establish industry-wide safety standards. Legislators around the world are watching; many are trying to impose liability on tech companies in a similar way as the plaintiffs. So even if juries declare the defendants aren’t liable in these cases, lawmakers will be taking notes–and adapting their own strategies, says Eric Goldman, a professor at the Santa Clara University school of law. Some have already enacted laws that align with the plaintiff’s claims.\n\nThere’s more at stake now, legal experts say. “Bad press about how some members of Congress embarrass Zuckerberg is one thing,” Zipursky added. Changing the architecture of a social network may be another entirely.\n\nPlaintiffs want to know: how much did tech companies know about the alleged harm caused by their products, and to what extent did they fail to warn users? They take particular issue with design features such as infinite scroll, autoplay and content curated by algorithms, accusing social media companies of prioritising engagement over wellbeing. Their legal strategy has brought up comparisons with those used against tobacco companies in the 1990s.\n\nThe trial will explore what social media addiction consists of. Tech companies have questioned the scientific link between their platforms and addiction. They also highlight various safety features and parental controls they adopted in recent years. Even if this harm exists, they argue, it’s a result of problematic content, as opposed to a poorly designed system. In doing so, the companies have often relied on a federal law that shields them from liability for third-party content on their platforms: section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. That defense hasn’t worked so far in this case, given the plaintiffs’ novel argument.\n\n“[Plaintiffs] have reconfigured it to say, look: the wrongful thing Meta is doing is running its whole platform in such a way that people get addicted,” Zipursky said. A key issue will be whether plaintiffs can prove the tech companies were wrongfully taking harmful risks, Zipursky added. Moreover, if the plaintiffs can prove that tech companies knowingly and intentionally caused harm, it will be easier to get punitive damages.\n\nSocial media addiction is not included in the latest edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the authoritative handbook for mental health treatment. Scientists have, however, catalogued compulsive use with severe consequences among young people, and legislators across the world are engaged in heated debate over its addictive potential and how to respond.\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, YouTube CEO Neal Mohan and Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri are expected to testify in the initial trial. Snap and TikTok reached a settlement in that case but are still defendants in other suits in the state-level trial.\n\nA Meta spokesperson said in an emailed comment that they strongly disagree with these allegations, and stressed that they have listened to parents and worked with experts and law enforcement to address safety issues. The company also cited the introduction of teen accounts, with additional protections.\n\nGoogle spokesperson José Castañeda called allegations in the lawsuits “simply not true”, and emphasized that the company had prioritized providing a safe and healthy experience for young people. Snap commented only on the first bellwether trial, saying they were “pleased to have been able to resolve this matter in an amicable manner”. TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nWhile much of the cases is yet to play out, some unsealed evidence has already drawn criticism of tech companies. That includes allegations that an Instagram employee compared the app to a drug, and that another suggested: “lol, we’re basically pushers.” A Meta spokesperson previously told Politico that the plaintiffs’ allegations relied on “cherry-picked quotes and misinformed opinions in an attempt to present a deliberately misleading picture”.\n\nThe 20-year-old at the center of the initial trial started using social media around age 10, even as her mother tried to stop her from using the apps. She “developed a compulsion to engage with those products nonstop” as a result of their “addictive design” and “constant notifications”, the complaint notes, according to NPR.\n\nLegal experts expect all of these cases will eventually be appealed if they don’t reach a settlement, and there’s no certainty about outcomes until appellate courts have weighed in. They expect tech companies to raise several issues, including whether the Communications Decency Act or first amendment applies, as well as potential disputes over causation and expert testimony. “None of these companies are going to feel that they need to change what they do,” Zipursky said.\n\nStill, juries’ verdicts in the early cases can affect how much companies may pay out. “The jury might signal they’re completely persuaded by the plaintiff’s arguments,” Goldman said. “Then, if there’s any settlement, the price tag will go up substantially.”",

    "fullText": "The start of a new year always brings new exercise routines — or at least the intentions to start them.\n\nIf you're anything like me, though, you might need a little encouragement and inspiration to get going.\n\nSo Business Insider spoke with successful women who make time for fitness regimens each week. They shared the workouts they love, and the gym essentials they swear by.\n\nJanel Barden, 27, is a cofounder of the talent and marketing agency LuxeHaus Management.\n\nIdeally, she likes to exercise between three and five times a week. When her schedule is extra busy, though, she uses a simple piece of equipment to enhance shorter exercises: $65 Bala Bangles.\n\nEach bracelet weighs two pounds and attaches with elastic straps.\n\n\"I love wearing them on walks, and when I'm at home doing a five to 10-minute arm workout I found on YouTube,\" Barden said.\n\nBarden uses ClassPass to vary her workouts. Sometimes, she does Pilates. Other times, she visits the gym, and most recently, she started working with a personal trainer.\n\nNo matter the workout, she's almost always wearing Alo Yoga clothes. She said its pieces are cute and comfortable.\n\nBarden specifically loves the brand's $138 sweatpants and $148 quarter-zip pullover from its Accolade collection, as well as the $78 bra and $134 leggings from its Airlift line.\n\nOccasionally, though, she'll swap her Alo pants for Lululemon's $108 Align leggings.\n\nVictoria Villanueva, 25, cofounded LuxeHaus Management with Barden. She said that exercise is vital to staying active and boosting her mental health while working from home.\n\n\"I've been really into bike riding lately,\" she said. \"I used to go all the time with my dad when I was little, and getting back into it now as an adult is healing something inside me. It's better than taking walks.\"\n\nTo hydrate before and after those rides, she relies on her $40 Stanley 1913 tumbler.\n\nVillanueva told Business Insider that her exercise wardrobe includes a mix of Halara leggings, Fabletics sets, and one accessory: the $349 Ultrahuman Ring Air in bionic gold.\n\n\"It's a dupe for the Oura Ring, but you don't have to pay for a monthly subscription,\" she said.\n\nIt helps her track her steps, heart rate, sleep, and more.\n\nSabrina Guler is the 32-year-old founder of Intuitive CEO, an advisory studio that helps new brands grow and raise capital.\n\nHer exercise regimen starts before she really gets moving each day.\n\n\"Drinking electrolytes before coffee every morning has completely changed my energy levels and hydration,\" she said. \"I avoid sugar-based options and use Ultima electrolytes.\"\n\nThe brand sells packets in sets for around $20.99 per bag.\n\n\"My 45-minute morning walk helps with insulin regulation, cortisol balance, and mental clarity,\" Guler told Business Insider. \"Hormones are everything.\"\n\nThe specific clothing pieces she wears on those walks might vary, but the brands don't.\n\n\"If I want to be seen and look cute, I am wearing Alo Yoga,\" she said. \"If I want to be comfortable, Lululemon has functional pieces. The butter-soft leggings still have me in a chokehold years later.\"\n\nNikki Seaman, 30, is the founder and CEO of Freestyle Snacks. Her brand, which recently appeared on \"Shark Tank,\" offers premium olives and pickles in to-go pouches.\n\n\"I do strength training two or three times a week, and I try to walk outside on the other days,\" she told Business Insider. \"I started strength training after my first son was born, and it has totally changed me physically and mentally.\"\n\nDuring those workouts, she wears $110 performance joggers from Vuori and $155 Clifton 10 sneakers from Hoka.\n\nShe described both as comfortable, durable, and easy to throw on before heading outside.",

    "description": "Ant’s health chatbot has become a top downloaded app in China as users seek personalized care they can’t get from the overburdened hospitals.",
    "fullText": "Ant Group, Alibaba’s fintech affiliate and parent of China’s ubiquitous payment app Alipay, is racing to lead the country’s digital health market with a chatbot designed to be a wellness companion.\n\nIts app, Ant Afu, uses artificial intelligence and agentic capabilities to answer health-related questions, suggest hospital appointments, analyze test results, and remind users to exercise or take medication. First created in June under the name AQ, it had recorded 30 million monthly active users by January, with more than half of them living in small cities, according to Ant Group’s chief executive Han Xinyi.\n\nInternet users have increasingly turned to AI for everyday health questions and companionship, especially in markets where access to physicians is limited. Despite concerns about patient safety and data privacy, products like Ant Afu are widely embraced in China as consumers seek more personalized, round-the-clock health support.\n\nChina’s primary care system is underdeveloped. Most people seek treatment for everything from the flu to cancer at sprawling, overcrowded public hospitals that are concentrated in big cities. Patients often complain of long wait times, short consultations, and poor bedside manner of exhausted clinicians.\n\nThis demand for better care, combined with a fast-aging population, has created a fertile ground for digital health products that can spare people the burden of visiting hospitals. Tech companies including JD.com, ByteDance, and Baidu have all built online medical consultation tools, and more recently, chatbots branded as AI doctors.\n\nAnt has a unique advantage as Alipay has long hosted the appointment and payment systems for many hospitals. Millions of people access their national medical insurance accounts through Alipay. In January 2025, Ant acquired Haodf, a leading online consultation portal with more than 300,000 registered physicians.\n\nIn the U.S., AI companies are also expanding their health-care offerings, but they do not yet offer direct access to the country’s large number of private providers and insurers. This month, both OpenAI and Anthropic announced tools targeting consumers, health-care providers, and clinical researchers. Both ChatGPT and Claude now offer features that analyze users’ medical reports and fitness data.\n\nAmong its domestic rivals, Ant’s extensive partnerships with regulators, hospitals, and doctors give it an edge in the AI health-care race, Ivy Yang, a China tech analyst and founder of New York-based consulting firm Wavelet Strategy, told Rest of World. On Ant Afu, users can ask health-related questions, book online consultations and offline appointments at major hospitals, and get reimbursed by state or commercial insurance.\n\n“For startups, the bureaucratic red tape and initial investment required to build the platform, be compliant with all health-care data [regulations], and deal with various government agencies seem like too big a hurdle to overcome,” Yang said.\n\nAnt’s foray into health care has been endorsed by its billionaire founder Jack Ma. He came up with the name Afu, because it made the chatbot sound like a friend, chief executive Han told Chinese tech outlet Latepost this month. “He really cares about whether or not Afu can be like an AI friend that offers emotional companionship and humane care,” Han said, “rather than being just a tool for solving professional problems.”\n\nMa hopes to one day launch the app in underdeveloped parts of Africa and Southeast Asia, Han said.\n\nAnt has spent tens of millions of dollars marketing Afu in China, according to Han. Ant Afu ads have popped up in subway stations, on social media feeds, inside public restrooms, and have been painted on walls in rural China, according to photos shared online. By the end of January, Ant Afu ranked among the top ten most-downloaded iOS apps in China, according to Sensor Tower data.\n\nThe expanding role of AI in patient care, a largely unregulated area, has also prompted warnings about misinformation around the world.  A recent investigation by The Guardian found that Google’s AI summaries were giving out inaccurate health advice. Academics have also found AI diagnostic tools to harbor racial or socioeconomic biases.",

    "fullText": "A serious health threat has been spreading in Pennsylvania, according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, and shifting weather patterns may be a contributing factor.\n\nCases of anaplasmosis went up over 50% in Allegheny County in 2025. U.S. states, including Wisconsin and California, have also seen jumps in the tick-borne bacterial infection.\n\nAnaplasmosis is routinely transmitted alongside Lyme disease via tick bites. Initial symptoms of infection include fever, fatigue, and nausea. When left untreated, it can have longer-term consequences.\n\n\"I really can't commit a lot to doing what I used to,\" Janine Hauck told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette in late December. Hauck contracted anaplasmosis in 2019 and has since suffered from chronic fatigue, impacting her ability to hike, bike, swim, and engage in the outdoor activities she loves. \"It's changed my life.\"\n\nA major contributor to the increase in anaplasmosis infections is the expanded population and habitat of disease-carrying ticks. Warmer, wetter weather patterns, exacerbated in part by atmospheric pollution, have provided prime conditions for ticks to reproduce.\n\nThis phenomenon has exacerbated the spread of other vector-borne illnesses, including dengue virus and West Nile virus.\n\nAnaplasmosis can be treated with antibiotics if detected early. For this reason, officials recommend regularly checking for tick bites after spending time outdoors. Seeking medical attention soon after a tick bite can help support recovery.\n\nPreventing tick bites in the first place is possible by wearing adequately long clothing and using effective repellents. Hauck told the Post-Gazette that the precautions are worth the hassle.\n\n\"People don't get how bad a tick bite could affect your life,\" she told the paper. \"I probably spent over $60,000 trying to get better. I'm lucky I have [the money], but not everyone does.\"\n\nIn the big picture, attacking the root of the problem may also require reducing emissions as much as possible in order to mitigate increasingly warm, wet weather and to shrink tick habitats and activity.\n\nDo you worry about having toxic forever chemicals in your home?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": "\"The point is, go to the doctors for a check-up or if something is not right. It might save your life.\"",
    "fullText": "\"Last year, after four years of hell, some new extreme symptoms popped up, like shortness of breath and joint pain. A few exams and lots more bloodwork later — wham, bam, thank you ma'am — it was undiagnosed LUPUS this whole time. I've now been on treatment for four months. Always, always, ALWAYS listen to your body above anyone else!\"\n\n\"When I couldn't step out of the shower without completely losing my breath, I finally went to the ER. I was diagnosed with what the docs called the largest deep vein thrombosis (blood clot in my thigh) they had ever seen. A piece of it had migrated to my lung, creating a huge saddle pulmonary embolism.\n\nI spent four days in the ICU and underwent two separate stent procedures to get the clots dissolved. Took about six months to get back to full capacity.\n\nIn my defense, I didn't know leg pain was a symptom of a blood clot, but I shouldn't have let it go on for so long.\"\n\n\"Also can be a sign of kidney disease.\"\n\n\"Ignored this for over two years and eventually ended up in the hospital with kidney failure.\"\n\n—Anonymous, 57, Female, California\n\n—Anonymous, 20, Nonbinary, North Carolina\n\n\"I went to the emergency room the week before I was supposed to return to work from maternity leave. The ER doctor told me my blood pressure was up, but to just go to my primary and sent me on my way. I made an appointment with my primary, and she told me I went through a lot having a baby, and my body is just adjusting.\"\n\n\"I spent three days in the hospital being treated as my heart was only at 15% functionality. My poor husband was distraught, he almost lost his partner, and was sad because he couldn't spend the days with me, instead having to care for my infant. It was scary. Thankfully, I have recovered, but I will spend the rest of my life taking lots of medicine to keep my heart healthy. What I learned is to listen to your body. If something feels wrong, it very well may be, and losing your life isn't worth being afraid to go to the doctor.\"\n\n\"By the time he was willing to share this with me, and we went to a doctor who treated his illness, my husband had between 6-18 months left to live. He delayed his treatment because he thought his 'persona' would be destroyed. He became more verbal and the loving man I recalled after taking his medication. He was a better man… until he was no longer alive. He died at 67. Men, check your PSA count. Save your lives not only for yourselves, but also for those who love you.\"\n\n\"Turns out I was so severely anemic, the breathlessness and coughing weren't from asthma or bronchitis or allergies, but it was from severe anemia for many years, indicating possible heart failure. After an iron supplement and an IUD to slow heavy menstrual bleeding, I haven't had to use an inhaler or asthma medicine in almost seven years. Get your iron levels checked often if you are a female in your 30s and 40s; it can literally make your heart fail.\"\n\n—Anonymous, 47, Female, North Carolina\n\n\"The poor ER doctor lady was so nice, but I was so embarrassed. Like, she literally stuck her hand up my ass. I genuinely felt like I was in John Mulaney's skit about trying to get Xanax and ending up getting a prostate exam because he said he was lying to get prescribed drugs. Unfortunately, because I waited, it's mostly pain management now. Pay attention to rectal issues and eat your fiber! I wanna die writing this. I'm so glad it's anon.\"\n\n—Anonymous, 25, Female, Seattle, Washington\n\n\"Two surgeries, a long hospital stay, followed by a home nurse aid daily to administer intravenous antibiotics and clean the 3-inch section of flesh removed, which had to remain open for weeks for the tendons to heal. You could see my bone and all the other inside things. I have a wicked scar from it.\"\n\n—Anonymous, 63, Female, New Jersey\n\n\"I had open heart surgery soon after, and they were able to remove it. I'll be on medication forever and need to see a specialist twice a year. Had my wife not told me to go to the doctors, I'd be dead by now. This is definitely the short version of my story, but the point is, go to the doctors for a check-up or if something is not right. It might save your life.\"\n\n—Anonymous, 42, Male, Atlanta, Georgia\n\n\"Right before my 33rd birthday, my father passed, and a month before, I had gotten a divorce. So when my period came on and didn't stop after 15 days, I figured maybe my hormones were messed up since I was going through a lot emotionally. I didn't think too much about it — it'll stop eventually, I told myself. That was June of 2025; by August, I was still bleeding. It never stopped. I finally dragged myself into the doctor's office. I was in pain, I was anemic, and I showed up with photos where it looked like I was passing pure flesh the size of my hand. Something had to give.\"\n\n\"I finally got my second opinion four months later. I have endometrial cancer, and I am going to have a total hysterectomy at 33 years old next week. I'm not happy, but it's easier to process knowing what the problem is. And I can't help but wonder if someone had listened to me for all the years I was complaining, if maybe there could have been a treatment for my endometriosis before it turned cancerous.\n\nSo no, a normal cycle should not be 10-15 days per month. No, you should not feel like you are giving birth every month (cramping is normal, but it should not be so severe that you can't walk). If you are bleeding so much you have to resort to wearing a diaper — that's not normal. And if the doctor won't listen to you, make them. Don't wait until you are so anemic you need a transfusion (also not normal), and if you have every single symptom and they tell you the imaging is normal — make them get you a second opinion. Being a woman is hard, but it doesn't mean suffering in silence. Speak up.\"\n\n—Anonymous, 33, Female, Alabama\n\nAlso in Goodful: If You Can Complete More Than 15 Of These Common Phrases, Your Vocabulary Is Better Than 95% Of People’s\n\nAlso in Goodful: \"I Knew Instantly That He Would Be Dead Soon\": Doctors Are Sharing The Biggest Health Issues Patients Ignored Until It Was Too Late, And Whew, I've Been Warned\n\nAlso in Goodful: My Husband And I Separated.

    "description": "A Nicaraguan man who died at a troubled Texas detention camp days after he was detained by immigration agents in Minnesota appeared to have died by suicide, according to a 911 call and records released Wednesday.  Victor Manuel Diaz, 36, was found by guards on Jan. 14 in a room at Camp East Montana in El Paso, Texas, after he tried to die by suicide, a camp official reported on a 911 call obtained by The Associated Press through a public information request.  “They were doing rounds and they just found him with his pants tied up to his neck, I believe,” said the caller, who identified himself as a health administrator named Luis Gonzalez.",
    "fullText": "Victor Manuel Diaz, 36, was found by guards on Jan. 14 in a room at Camp East Montana in El Paso, Texas, after he tried to die by suicide, a camp official reported on a 911 call obtained by The Associated Press through a public information request.\n\n“They were doing rounds and they just found him with his pants tied up to his neck, I believe,” said the caller, who identified himself as a health administrator named Luis Gonzalez.\n\nDiaz’s death was at least the third of a detainee housed at Camp East Montana, which opened last year at Fort Bliss to hold 5,000 detainees in the desert near the U.S.-Mexico border. Advocates for detainees have alleged a pattern of violence, abuse and neglect at the camp. One earlier death has been ruled a homicide.\n\nRandall Kallinen, an attorney for Diaz's family, said they are suspicious of the claim that his death was a suicide because he was not depressed and would have been reunited with his mother, two sons and siblings in Nicaragua if he had been deported.\n\n“Even if it is suicide, was there something that happened to him that drove him to suicide?” Kallinen asked. “There still has to be an investigation.”\n\nMessages seeking comment were left with ICE on Wednesday.\n\nGonzalez did not witness Diaz's suicide attempt. A separate report by emergency medical services that was released Wednesday said Diaz was suspected of hanging himself with a bed sheet. Federal authorities have not released the findings of an autopsy, but have said the death was a “presumed suicide.”\n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement picked up Diaz on Jan. 6 as agents fanned out across Minneapolis looking for people who may be in the country illegally. He was then sent to the sprawling Texas tent complex.\n\nDiaz crossed the U.S.-Mexico border in 2024, requested asylum and was released. A judge later ordered his removal after he didn’t show up for an immigration hearing, according to ICE.\n\nRelatives in Nicaragua lost contact with Diaz after he went to work at a suburban restaurant on Jan. 6 and later learned he'd been detained. They received a call on Jan. 15 from ICE saying Diaz was dead. Family members “were in disbelief,” said Carlos Morales, board president of Texas Nicaraguan Community, a nonprofit that helped the family raise money to repatriate Diaz's remains to Nicaragua.\n\nA coalition of groups and a Democratic congresswoman who represents El Paso have called for Camp East Montana to be closed.\n\nSome of those calls came after the Jan. 3 death of 55-year-old Cuba native Geraldo Lunas Campos. A medical examiner has ruled that a homicide, citing physical restraint by guards.\n\nA witness has described guards pinning Lunas Campos to the ground in handcuffs, with one restraining him in a chokehold until he could no longer breathe. ICE has said the guards intervened to try to help Lunas Campos after he attempted suicide, and that he resisted them. A camp official initially told police it was a suicide.\n\nLawyers for the family of Lunas Campos have asked a judge for an emergency order to prevent ICE from deporting detainees who witnessed the struggle.\n\nICE, which oversees the camp, announced Diaz’s death on Jan. 18, saying security staff “found Diaz unconscious and unresponsive in his room.” The agency said he “died of a presumed suicide” but that the cause was still under investigation.\n\nIn addition to Lunas Campos and Diaz, ICE announced that on Dec. 3 an immigrant from Guatemala held in Camp East Montana died after being transferred to a El Paso hospital for care. The agency said Francisco Gaspar-Andres, 48, was suspected to have died of liver and kidney failure.\n\nUnlike with the two prior deaths, Diaz’s body wasn’t sent to the county medical examiner in El Paso for an autopsy. Kallinen said an Armed Forces pathologist conducted the autopsy at Fort Bliss, and that he's been told it could take months for findings to be released.\n\nThe 911 caller in the case told the dispatcher that a team of doctors and nurses were working to try to revive Diaz after his suicide attempt and they needed an ambulance.\n\nParamedics found him laying on his back in a hospital bed without a heartbeat, according to an El Paso Fire Department incident report.\n\nAP reporter Michael Biesecker contributed from Washington.",

    "description": "A former marketing manager explains why leaving corporate life to freelance after having kids led to burnout and mental health struggles.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Katie Bullon of activ Marketing Franchise. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nBefore I got pregnant with my firstborn, I was working in the corporate world as a marketing manager. It was an intense job that I absolutely loved, both as a single person and then as a newly married one. I got to travel the world, quickly advance in my career, and diversify my skill set, but I could only do the job because I didn't yet have kids.\n\nI knew once I started a family, I wouldn't want to continue working in the corporate world full time. I never wanted to be in a position where I had to choose between taking care of my kids and doing my job, so I initially decided to go back to my role part time, thinking that would be a happy medium.\n\nBut after keeping in touch day, a reintroduction to work after maternity leave, when my son was 7 months old, it became clear I couldn't even manage the part time role. To do the job well, to the high standard I expected of myself, I had to give it my everything.\n\nI remember finishing the keeping in touch day, crying in my boss's office, telling her I just couldn't come back. The day had been a reminder of my old life — the life of a young, free, travelling corporate marketer. It was a life I knew I couldn't maintain with a baby in tow, and I mourned the end of my life as a corporate professional.\n\nI quit my job and, after months of deliberation and dreaming, decided to go freelance — I was really excited. Surely, I thought, I would strike a healthy balance of parenting and working if I worked for myself.\n\nThe plan would be to devote all my attention to my son when he was awake, and pull out my laptop to work while he slept.\n\nBut the reality of being self-employed as a new mom was not what I had imagined.\n\nI was running on empty all the time, exhausted from sleepless nights. I didn't know what I was doing with parenting, as I had never done it before, and often felt I was doing it all wrong. I adored my son even more than I had imagined I would, and not being with him while I worked constantly pulled at my heartstrings.\n\nIt was from this state that I then tried to work, attempting to be at clients' full-time disposal. Even though I knew about marketing, I didn't fully take into account the amount of work or the number of non-billable hours I'd be working as a self-employed individual. As opposed to working for a corporate company, I was the sole person responsible for every aspect of the business. It was all on me.\n\nNot keen on putting my son in a day care to save us a bit of money, I tried to build the business with him around most of the time, save for a few hours a week when my mom or sister would have him.\n\nI was on a hamster wheel from the moment I woke up, becoming more and more exhausted as I tried to work as if I didn't have a child, and parent as if I didn't have a job.\n\nThe standards I set for myself as a mother and business owner were unachievable, and I could feel myself starting to burn out as I attempted to do it all.\n\nOnly 20 months after my first son was born, I gave birth to my second son, and I continued trying to balance my own business with parenting, this time with a toddler and newborn in tow.\n\nMy second didn't ever take a bottle, so I frequently sat with him breastfeeding on one side with my laptop set up on the other. I was absolutely determined to do it all, and do it all perfectly.\n\nI suppose part of me wanted to prove people wrong, to show them that I could be a completely present mother while also being an incredibly successful self-starter.\n\nMy mental health crashed. My physical health deteriorated. My relationship with my husband was rocky. I was exhausted all the time and felt like I had hit rock bottom.\n\nIt wasn't what I had expected freelancing to be like, and it most certainly wasn't what I wanted motherhood to be like.\n\nWhile self-employment might seem like the \"easier than corporate path\" for new mothers, it wasn't — not for me.\n\nSomething had to change, so I went back to the drawing board, considering what I could do differently, and joined a marketing franchise. It allowed me to continue doing what I loved, marketing, but I had the back office and a team of people behind me to carry out all the work that had overwhelmed me when I was working on my own.\n\nIf I could go back in time and give myself advice, I would say: You can't do it all, nor should you.\n\nAs a mom, I can't put myself last. I must build my life in a way that prioritizes me; otherwise, I'll burn out repeatedly, which is detrimental to ume, my family, and my work.",

    "description": "Oprah Winfrey's newest book, \"Enough,\" is about her relationship with weight-loss drugs. Since the '90s, she has been combining her health with business.",
    "fullText": "Oprah Winfrey has spent years turning her private health journey into a public conversation — and, at times, a lucrative business.\n\nThe billionaire, real-estate mogul, talk-show host, journalist, actor, and producer has just released her 12th book: \"Enough: Your Health, Your Weight, and What It's Like To Be Free.\"\n\nThe book, which she co-authored with Dr. Ania M. Jastreboff, a doctor and professor at Yale's School of Medicine, dives into the role of GLP-1 drugs to facilitate weight loss.\n\nThe practice is something that Winfrey herself has touted. On CNN in December 2024, she said she had first begun using a GLP-1 before Christmas in 2023.\n\nWinfrey has been combining her personal health and fitness with business for decades, including investing in WeightWatchers (now WW International), writing books about health, identifying exercise and health trends for her show and magazine, and putting her support behind figures like Dr. Mehmet Oz, who is now the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\nWinfrey did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nHere's a timeline of how her health empire has evolved.\n\nDuring a 1988 episode of \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" — a few years after Joan Rivers asked about Winfrey's weight gain — Winfrey wheeled out a red wagon filled with 67 pounds of animal fat.\n\nWhy? To convey to her audience how much weight she'd lost in the last year while on the Optifast liquid diet.\n\nThe episode put a spotlight on medically supervised liquid formula diets. After it aired, The New York Times reported that Winfrey got just 400 calories a day from Optifast and wrote that the ability of people on such diets \"to maintain the loss is questionable and not yet fully evaluated.\"\n\nFor a 2005 issue of O, The Oprah Magazine, Winfrey wrote, \"For four solid months, I didn't eat a single morsel of food,\" and lost 67 pounds. \"What I didn't know was that my metabolism was shot. Two weeks after I returned to real food, I was up 10 pounds.\"\n\nWhile she was proud of losing the weight, Winfrey later regretted the decision to pull the wagon out.\n\n\"When I look at that show, I think it was one of the biggest ego trips of my life,\" Winfrey told Entertainment Tonight in 2011.\n\nShe cowrote \"Make the Connection: Ten Steps to a Better Body and a Better Life\" with exercise physiologist (and her personal trainer) Bob Greene.\n\nThe 10 steps included guidance such as \"exercise 20 to 60 minutes a day,\" \"eat a low-fat, balanced diet,\" and \"eat three meals and two snacks each day.\"\n\nIt went on to become a No. 1 bestseller and is still in circulation.\n\nWinfrey introduced audiences to Phil McGraw, aka Dr. Phil, in the late '90s as her show's resident relationship expert. He proved so popular that Winfrey produced and co-created a spinoff of \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" starring McGraw: \"Dr. Phil.\" It aired from 2002 to 2023, and for most of its run, it was second in ratings only to Winfrey's show.\n\nLike Winfrey, McGraw frequently discussed weight loss and health on his show, and also lent his face and name to nutritional supplements. As The New York Times wrote in 2003, \"Oprah Winfrey has talked about weight loss — hers and everyone else's — for years. Her protégé Dr. Phil has found a way to make money from it.\"\n\nHe's also written his own weight-loss books, including \"The Ultimate Weight Solution: The 7 Keys to Weight Loss Freedom\" and \"The Ultimate Weight Solution Food Guide.\"\n\nWinfrey also introduced Dr. Mehmet Oz to her show's audience. He made his \"Oprah\" debut in 2004 and ultimately appeared more than 60 times, per NPR, before Winfrey greenlit \"The Dr. Oz Show\" in 2009. It aired until 2022, when he began a US Senate campaign in Pennsylvania.\n\nSimilarly, Oz's program featured many segments on weight loss, and Oz himself endorsed multiple \"cures\" for obesity that have been disproven. He was appointed administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services in 2024.\n\nWhile it's not known how much money Winfrey made from their two shows, both aired for over a decade (with reruns on Winfrey's channel, OWN), and Winfrey's production company, Harpo Productions, was involved throughout.\n\nWinfrey's own show, which aired for 25 years, was the foundation of her wealth, rocketing her to millionaire status when it became nationally syndicated in 1986. By 2003, she was a billionaire, and she's now worth an estimated $3.2 billion, Forbes reported.\n\nIn 2015, Winfrey announced she was joining the board of WeightWatchers (now known as WW International, or WW) and was purchasing a 10% stake in the company worth $43 million.\n\nThe New York Times reported in 2015 that it led to an increase of $400 million in market value for the brand, which had been trending downward before Winfrey's involvement.\n\n\"WeightWatchers has given me the tools to begin to make the lasting shift that I and so many of us who are struggling with weight have longed for,\" she said in a statement. \"I believe in the program so much I decided to invest in the company and partner in its evolution.\"\n\nIt's an example of the Oprah Effect: the trend of Winfrey endorsing, supporting, or investing in a brand that leads to a spike in value.\n\nWinfrey posted on X (then Twitter) a video about how she'd lost 26 pounds on WeightWatchers while still eating bread.\n\n\"I love bread,\" she said. \"That's the genius of this program. I lost 26 pounds, and I have eaten bread every single day.\"\n\nAccording to MarketWatch, the subsequent bump in the stock price, just one hour after the post, netted Winfrey around $12 million.\n\nWinfrey's cookbook, which also reached bestseller status, incorporated the WeightWatchers system into its recipes and flagged the number of points each meal was worth, in a neat bit of corporate synergy.\n\nSoon after confirming her use of a GLP-1, Winfrey publicly said she wouldn't be seeking reelection to the board.\n\nThe announcement sent WeightWatchers' stock tumbling 25%. As Business Insider wrote at the time, it seemed like Winfrey was jumping ship from an \"outdated operating system\" in the age of Ozempic and other GLP-1s.\n\nWinfrey's latest book, \"Enough,\" which she cowrote with Dr. Ania M. Jastreboff, was released in January 2026. It details Winfrey's experience with GLP-1s, combined with Jastreboff's expertise.\n\nWinfrey has been promoting her book heavily, including a stop on \"CBS Sunday Morning,\" where she explained how reframing her relationship to obesity and weight has changed her life.\n\n\"I'm not going to, but I could weep right now for all of the many days and nights I've journaled about this being my fault and why can't I conquer this thing?\" she said.\n\n\"There are tools to use that can help you. And I do see [GLP-1s] as a tool,\" she continued.",

    "description": "A functional medicine doctor shared lifestyle habits that can boost metabolic health, such as strength training and getting better sleep.",
    "fullText": "How quickly your body burns fat can sometimes feel out of your control. For Dr. Adam Perlman, it's one of the biggest laments he's heard from patients.\n\n\"I can't tell you how many times I've had patients who have had so much trouble losing weight complain to me that their friends can eat whatever they want and never put weight on,\" Perlman, an integrative and functional medicine doctor and former chief medical officer for Mayo Clinic's integrative medicine program, told Business Insider.\n\nIt's also one of the biggest misconceptions he hears about metabolic health.\n\n\"Your genetics aren't your destiny,\" he said, even if they play a role. \"You can counter a lot of those genetics with the right type of interventions, particularly around lifestyle.\"\n\nLuckily, none of those involve eating less, the other big myth he hears around losing fat. \"Sometimes, if you restrict your diet too much, it really backfires because you go into this sort of scarcity state,\" he added.\n\nWhile he said it's important to speak to a doctor and rule out potential underlying issues of unexplained weight gain, like thyroid function, he said there are a few simple lifestyle changes everyone can make to boost their metabolic health and burn fat faster.\n\nFrom his experience, Perlman has seen people lean on heavy exercise, particularly cardio workouts, to shed fat fast.\n\nWhile aerobic exercise has other health benefits, he said that there isn't great evidence that movement alone will lead to drastic weight loss.\n\nStrength training, however, has its own metabolic benefits. Because muscle is a more metabolically active tissue, having higher muscle mass helps you burn more calories at rest over time.\n\nPerlman said he encourages strength training to his patients and performs a bioelectric scan to measure their body's composition of muscle and fat. He especially emphasizes it to older patients who may be going through hormonal changes, like during menopause, or experiencing a natural decrease in muscle mass.\n\n\"People begin to develop what they perceive as a slowing of metabolism, where part of the issue is that they're not maintaining their muscle mass the way they need to,\" he said. \"Making sure they're getting strength training is particularly Important.\"\n\nPerlman is particularly fascinated by newer science that links a slower metabolism to issues with your gut microbiome.\n\nCertain microbes, like the gut bacterium akkermansia muciniphila, thrive on fiber and polyphenols found in foods like raspberries and artichokes. Their byproducts can signal the body to release hormones that help regulate appetite and blood sugar.\n\nEating lots of ultra-processed foods can disrupt this cycle. But even if you follow the Mediterranean diet, you might still struggle with losing fat due to a lack of variety in your meals, he said.\n\n\"By and large, what you want is to make sure you eat the rainbow,\" he said. \"So a mix of different types of plants, which is really a mix of different types of fibers that the body tends to feed on.\"\n\nA lack of sleep disrupts your hormones, making it harder to lose fat.\n\nWhat's more, even a consistent sleep schedule during the work week won't make up for late nights on the weekend.\n\n\"A lot of people have what's called 'social jet lag,'\" Perlman said, where they go to bed at 10 p.m. on weekdays but 2 a.m. on Saturday nights. \"That really wreaks havoc on your health, on your microbiome, on other aspects of your health as well.\"\n\nFor Perlman, getting better sleep has been the most recent change he's made to boost his own metabolic health.\n\n\"If you came to my home, you'd see that we have blackout shades, I use a new noise machine at night, I turn the temperature down before I go to bed,\" he said. \"Sleep has been one that I've definitely been focused on.\"",

The chain's stock opened 9% higher after it reported its first comparable transaction increase in the US in eight quarters.\n\nEven Niccol himself appears to be getting in on the protein craze. On Wednesday's call, the CEO said that he \"might have started my day with a vanilla protein latte.\"\n\nThe key, he said, is getting the word about the offering to more people.\n\n\"Awareness is still pretty surprisingly low, but the trial and the repeat rates are really, really great — meaning, when someone tries it, we see a high level of repeat, and it has proven to be highly incremental,\" Niccol said. \"So this is one we want to keep doing.\"",

    "description": "Health insurance stocks fell hard Tuesday morning as investors digested a CMS report proposing a lower-than-expected increase to 2027 Medicare Advantage plans.",
    "fullText": "The health insurance sector saw a deep sell-off Tuesday, led by a plunge in UnitedHealth Group (UNH) shares, as the Trump administration proposed a lower-than-expected increase to 2027 Medicare Advantage plans.\n\nIn a report published Monday night by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the administration proposed that payment rates for Medicare Advantage plans (private insurance plans) will rise by just 0.09% in 2027. Analysts were expecting an increase of as much as 6%.\n\nUnitedHealth (UNH) lost nearly 20%, while fellow major insurers Elevance Health (ELV) and CVS (CVS) each shed around 14%.\n\nThe smaller-than-expected proposal comes as margins are already tight for insurers. When UNH reported earnings Tuesday morning, the company said its Medical Care Ratio sat at 89.1%. Other insurers have reported similar rates.\n\nThe MCR is a key metric that measures the percentage of premium revenue spent on medical claims and healthcare services for policy members. In UNH's case, the company uses $0.89 of every dollar the company makes from the premiums it charges customers to pay for medical care.\n\nUnitedHealth has the largest exposure among insurers to Medicare Advantage changes, accounting for roughly 30% of enrollment nationally. Humana (HUM), which comes in second with roughly 17% of national enrollment, also saw shares plunge over 20% on Tuesday.\n\nThe tiny increase for 2027 comes after the insurance got a 5.06% increase for 2026, higher than expected. Final numbers for 2027 are scheduled to be finalized on or before April 6, according to William Blair analysts.\n\nIn a statement released after the CMS report, a spokesperson for the insurance industry group AHIP said that, if the proposal is to be implemented, it \"could result in benefit cuts and higher costs for 35 million seniors and people with disabilities when they renew their Medicare Advantage coverage in October 2026.\"\n\nThe proposal \"represents an additional headwind for the [Medicare Advantage] sector, further pressuring industry fundamentals,\" William Blair analysts wrote in a note to clients published on Tuesday.\n\nUnitedHealth, the country's largest insurer, took a secondary hit Tuesday morning when the company reported fourth quarter and full-year 2025 revenues that came in below expectations.\n\nFourth quarter and full-year revenue came in at $113.2 billion and $447.6 billion, respectively, compared to estimates of $113.7 billion and $447.9 billion. Both fourth quarter and full-year revenues were up 12% against the previous year.",

The small-than-expected increase comes amid concerns about rising health costs.\n\nHere were the big movers in Tuesday's session:\n\nUnitedHealth Group released fourth-quarter earnings before Tuesday's opening bell, with RBC analysts saying the earnings print and 2026 outlook were both \"solid.\" They chalked up the big slide in the shares to the latest insurance updates from the administration.\n\nDuring the earnings call, UnitedHealthcare CEO Tim Noel called the CMS proposal \"disappointing,\" saying if finalized, \"it will mean very meaningful benefit reductions.\"\n\nThe Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services proposed a net average year-over-year payment increase of 0.09% in 2027 for Medicare Advantage members. In comparison, Medicare Advantage payments in 2026 rose 5.06% from 2025.\n\nThe proposed payment increase was well below Wall Street's expectations, with RBC Capital Markets analysts expecting an \"at least a mid-single digit increase.\" The analysts noted that historically, the final payment rate is higher than the initial proposal.\n\nDr. Mehmet Oz, CMS administrator, said the \"proposed payment policies are about making sure Medicare Advantage works better for the people it serves,\" while \"protecting taxpayers from unnecessary spending that is not oriented towards addressing real health needs.\"\n\nThe CMS proposal also includes updates to the Medicare Advantage risk adjustment model, such as excluding diagnosis information not associated with a specific beneficiary encounter.",

    "fullText": "The European Environment Agency (EEA) has named the culprit responsible for the deaths of almost half a million people in 2021 — and it's found in the very air we breathe.\n\nResearchers from the EEA largely blame fine particulates, inhalable particles known as PM2.5. Of the total, they attributed 253,000 \"early deaths\" to levels of PM2.5 that surpassed the World Health Organization's (WHO) maximum guideline limits, as reported by the Guardian.\n\nAdditional deaths were found to be caused by excessive levels of nitrogen dioxide and ozone.\n\n\"The figures released today by the EEA remind us that air pollution is still the number one environmental health problem,\" Virginijus Sinkevičius, the EU's environment commissioner, told the Guardian.\n\nMany people forget that saving the planet is also saving themselves. Air pollution directly affects the environment and all of the plants, animals, and humans living in it.\n\nOften called the \"silent killer,\" air pollution is one of the biggest health emergencies since tobacco, according to the WHO, contributing to higher risks of everything from respiratory infections and heart disease to asthma and cancer.\n\nAn investigation by the Guardian this year found that 98% of people in Europe were breathing air that breached WHO guidelines.\n\nThe WHO states that this is true for almost all of the global population, with air pollution responsible for 6.7 million premature deaths annually.\n\nOver the years, knowledge has become power in identifying ways we can improve air quality.\n\nThe Clean Air Act requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to regulate and monitor toxic gases released into the atmosphere.\n\nIn recent years, the EPA has taken steps to minimize pollution from large industrial facilities and transportation, two huge contributors to the health crisis we face today.\n\nTransitioning to clean energy, like solar and wind, is vital to reducing air-polluting gases.\n\nSometimes it's hard to know where to start fighting the problem at home, but it's easier than you think.\n\nRecycling, thrifting, and repurposing products are amazing ways to make a difference. You can also purchase an air purifier to cleanse your living space.\n\nSwitching to public transportation and taking walks when possible instead of using gas-powered vehicles are other low-effort ways to help the issue of air pollution. If you're in the market for a new car, think about upgrading to an electric vehicle.\n\n\"The good news is that clean-air policy works,\" Sinkevičius told the Guardian. \"But we need to do better still and bring pollution levels down further.\"\n\nJoin our free newsletter for weekly updates on the coolest innovations improving our lives and saving our planet.",

    "description": "\"At a time when the universe had robbed me — of my husband’s health and companionship, of security, contentment and peace of mind — she offered me a gift.\"",
    "fullText": "Ten minutes after my husband arrived in his hospital room, the space throbbed with doctors, nurses, therapists and technicians. Warnings beeped on machines. White coats huddled and whispered. And then Joel was rushed back out the door, gurney wheels spinning, propelled by a fleet of scrubs in sprint mode.\n\nWe had just returned from the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro. Our next trip would be from Wisconsin to Portland, Oregon, to welcome our first grandchild. But first, Joel elected to have a hip replacement. He counted on it to improve his quality of life.\n\nAlso Read: I Was 21 When My Doctors Told Me I Had A Year To Live. What Happened Next Left Them Stunned.\n\nInstead, a nick from the retractor caused a life-threatening bleed that set off a cascade of catastrophes. Within a few hours, he went from a healthy, active, 63-year-old to an unconscious, life-support-dependent ICU patient. Kidney failure followed, plus an obstructed colon and compartment syndrome — all complications of what should have been a routine procedure.\n\nTo make matters worse, the doctor who ****** up his hip replacement was in charge of fixing the mistake.\n\nI had trusted too much — the doctors, the hospital, the statistics proclaiming hip replacement common and safe.\n\nWhy hadn’t I asked more questions? I thought, berating myself. Why hadn’t I educated myself about the risks? Why hadn’t I asked for the procedure to be done at a larger, regional facility?\n\nAlso Read: My Husband's Medical Team Was Failing Him. Then A Stranger Stepped In And Said 6 Words That Saved His Life.\n\nPrepared for a one- to three-day hospital stay, with a return to normal in six weeks, Joel instead embarked on a monthslong hospitalization with no guaranteed survival. And since he was drugged into incoherence, I made decisions for him. With no medical knowledge and little experience in trauma, surgeries or hospitals, I once again trusted too much.\n\nThe staff invited me to daily briefings, but their terminology confused me, and I missed information because they talked so fast. I wanted to go back in time. I hoped it was all a dream. Still, I tried to memorize their words and repeat each message to our daughters.\n\nThe community hospital’s small cadre of ICU nurses monitored Joel around the clock, checking his breathing tube, supervising dialysis and scheduling multiple surgeries per week. Nurses handed me consent forms with little explanation, assuring me each surgery was essential to remove dead tissue from Joel’s leg. I signed the forms until 90% of his lower leg muscle was gone.\n\nI had so many questions: Why was the doctor who botched the hip replacement now in charge of Joel’s recovery? Why did the lead surgeon disregard the colon specialist’s recommendation to have Joel evaluated elsewhere? Why was there a rotating staff instead of one director in charge of intensive care? And why were two of Joel’s doctors arguing at the central ICU desk?\n\nThat’s when a rabbi came to see me.\n\nAlso Read: I Pursued Motherhood Despite Past Psychosis -- Then This Happened\n\n“You know what they’re arguing about, don’t you?” she said.\n\nShe never asked if we were Jewish (we’re not) or if I needed spiritual guidance.\n\nJust minutes before, a nurse had told me one doctor advocated amputating Joel’s leg; the other disagreed. The argument continued.\n\nWhy only two doctors instead of a larger team? I wondered. Why did they not ask my opinion? Who would make the ultimate decision?\n\nAlso Read: Since I Was A Child, I've Known Things I Had No Way Of Knowing. I Hid My Abilities Out Of Fear — Until Now.\n\n“You can request a different hospital,” she told me calmly, as though she had been reading my thoughts. “You could have your husband transferred.”\n\nThose six words seemed so obvious.\n\nTwenty minutes to the east was a prominent medical facility affiliated with a medical college and staffed with hundreds of doctors, research teams, and state-of-the-art equipment. But in the fuzz of shock and stress, I hadn’t considered this alternative.\n\n“Maybe discuss it with your daughters,” the rabbi said.\n\nAlso Read: I'm A Doctor Who Almost Died Because My Own Doctors Refused To Do This 1 Basic Thing\n\nFor the first time in two weeks, I sensed someone on my side. She had assessed the situation and proposed I abandon the place that employed her. She suggested there was a better place than the one she represented. But more than that, she gave me agency. She assumed I had power even as I felt powerless. She assumed I was fierce even as I felt impotent.\n\nHer suggestion seemed impossible. Doctors, not wives, made decisions.\n\nWould anyone listen to me? I wondered. How would I move a critically ill man who needed minute-by-minute monitoring?\n\nStill, I knew if I didn’t act quickly, my husband’s leg could be gone. He could even lose his life.\n\nI went home, and I made phone calls to that regional hospital. I discovered a team of limb salvage specialists who saved legs instead of amputating them, and I found a doctor to supervise my husband’s case.\n\nAt 7 a.m. the next day, intimidated and fearful, I approached the authority figures I had been taught to trust — the medical professionals who towered from their self-constructed pedestals. I told them I had initiated a transfer and my husband would be leaving their facility.\n\nAll day, I endured delays, waiting for a bed, waiting for approval, waiting for coordination — waiting, waiting, waiting.\n\nAt 10 p.m., Joel was transferred in an ambulance to the larger hospital, where he would spend the next 2 1/2 months.\n\nHe still required surgeries, feeding tubes and dialysis. But now, he had a team of doctors dedicated to saving both limb and life, with resources beyond those in the local hospital. And he had a wife with a voice.\n\nWould I have found my voice without that rabbi? I’m not convinced I would have. But once I initiated change, I intended to do it again.\n\nNot all my requests were heeded. But sometimes, when I pointed out a symptom or insisted on a test, my inquiry led to a new treatment. My husband experienced medical errors in this new hospital too, but he survived. And aside from the leg brace he now wears, the blue handicapped sign on our car and the scar from his temporary colostomy, he is whole.\n\nCompared to the dying man who laid unconscious and immobile, Joel is changed. I’m changed too. Shortly after Joel returned home, I consulted a law firm about a malpractice suit. After almost a year of meetings and investigations, they advised us to abandon the case. Wisconsin had a cap on damages, and the burden was too great to prove negligence.\n\nDespite that disappointment, I still speak up. Now, before every doctor appointment, I compose a list of questions, complaints and possible treatments. When a doctor pooh-poohs a test, I challenge their opinion. When a nurse minimizes a symptom, I repeat my concern. When a result goes unnoticed, I call attention to it. And my advocacy goes beyond medicine. When I appeared in court on a probate issue, I wrote a script for my lawyer with points to make to the judge.\n\nAlthough drugs, surgeries, therapies and hard work saved and rehabilitated my husband, it was a complete stranger who precipitated his move to the proper facility — and very well may have saved his life. Though life often seems impersonal, with virtual meetings instead of face-to-face interactions, texts instead of phone calls and blood tests instead of bedside manner, she made me feel connected to and cared for.\n\nAt a time when the universe had robbed me — of my husband’s health and companionship, of security, contentment and peace of mind — she offered me a gift. Expecting nothing in return, she stood by my side and held me up. She gave me confidence and hope. Her compassion healed and transformed as much as any test or treatment and left me looking for ways to pay her kindness forward.\n\nThis piece originally ran in February 2025 and is being shared again as part of HuffPost Personal’s “Best Of” series.\n\nNancy Jorgensen is a Wisconsin-based writer, educator and collaborative pianist.

    "fullText": "This live blog is refreshed periodically throughout the day with the latest updates from the market.To find the latest Stock Market Today threads, click here.\n\nHappy Monday. This is TheStreet’s Stock Market Today for Jan. 26, 2026. You can follow the latest updates on the market here in our daily live blog.\n\nThe Trump Administration has reportedly proposed keeping reimbursement rates for Medicare plans almost flat year-over-year, much to the detriment of already slammed health insurers like UnitedHealth, Humana, CVS Health, and the like.\n\nThe proposal, first reported in WSJ this evening, says that payments will increase by an average rate of \"0.09%\" in 2027. The reaction after hours has been stark. On news of the report, the aforementioned three firms --- among the largest Medicare Advantage providers --- fell 8.8%, 12.8%, and 9.5% after the bell.\n\nAlthough over half of U.S. equities were in decline today, large caps kept the market on track. The Dow (+0.64%), S&P 500(+0.50%), and Nasdaq (+0.43%) continued a four day winning streak, while the Russell 2000 (-0.36%) suffered modest declines.\n\nTop of mind for most investors were forthcoming earnings and the Fed rate decision due out tomorrow. Earnings alone would have been a sufficient distraction this week, with reports from Apple, Microsoft, Meta, Tesla, and others. However, the Fed is also expected to release its rate decision tomorrow, adding to the busy state of affairs this week.\n\nThrough midday, things have taken a small turn. The Russell 2000 (-0.21%), once leading the pack is now the sole decliner among major indexes. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq (+0.71%) has pulled ahead.\n\nIn their fourth straight winning session, 56.1% (3,103) U.S. issues are now seen declining, but the 41.5% (2,293) lifting the market are putting up quite the fight.\n\nThat said, here are today's midday movers, our daily list of the top and bottom 20 stocks with at least a $2 billion market cap. Here, we aim to capture the biggest stories on markets\n\nUSA Rare Earth (+14.86%) is fetching a bid today after the U.S. government confirmed it would take a 10% stake in the business, making it today's best-performer.\n\nIt's joined by a handful of software companies; DigitalOcean (+12.27%), Pattern Group (+12.06%), Cloudflare (+10.74%), and Zoom Communications (+9.87%) are also putting up a strong performance today after a weak week for software stocks.",

    "description": "\"Your body can’t metabolize it properly.\"",
    "fullText": "Soda is never the beverage of choice when it comes to health, but some types are better than others. If you want to drink Coca-Cola, for example, there are several varieties to choose from, with noticeable differences between them.\n\nContent creator David Céspedes (@dr.davidcespedes) recently shared a video revealing which variety of this iconic soda is the best of the worst, as AS reported.\n\n\"If you're going to drink supermarket Coca-Cola, I'll explain which one you should never touch and which is the least harmful,\" the doctor says in his video.\n\nDiet Coke and Coca-Cola Zero Sugar are the worst, Céspedes reveals.\n\n\"The main problem is aspartame,\" he says, referring to the artificial sweetener used in place of sugar in these diet products. \"Your body can't metabolize it properly, and it disrupts your brain, your gut microbiome, and your overall system.\"\n\nHowever, that doesn't make regular Coca-Cola healthy, as other experts have also highlighted.\n\n\"It's not safe either because it contains high-fructose corn syrup,\" says Céspedes. \"It's a ticking time bomb for your liver. One can has about 36 grams of sugar, enough to spike your blood sugar and increase inflammation.\"\n\nEven the container that the Coke comes in makes a difference. Céspedes points out that the plastic bottles shed microplastics into the soda you drink — the same effect that makes drinking bottled water unhealthy.\n\nCéspedes' position that drinking cola is never good for you has been backed up by experts, as Verywell Health reported. It leads to issues as small as acne breakouts and as large as heart disease.\n\nAll of that is on top of the negative impact of plastic bottles on the planet.\n\nDo you think forever chemicals should be banned from all products?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nIf you can minimize your impact by switching to a similar, healthier product, that's better for you and for the entire world.\n\nUltimately, Céspedes recommends one specific product.\n\n\"If you're going to drink Coke, at least choose glass bottles,\" he says. \"They don't have the plastic lining of cans and usually use cane sugar, which your body handles much better than high-fructose corn syrup. … If you're going to indulge, do it with a glass bottle, in moderation, and knowing exactly what's inside.\"\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "title": "The CEO of a $2 billion healthcare firm only felt rich after he paid off $100K in student loans—but that joy ‘disappeared’ in less than 3 days",
    "description": "Virta Health CEO Sami Inkinen only felt like he “made it” once in 2008, when he was able to pay off $100,000 in debt. He didn’t own a car until he was 37, and is “happy with very little.”",
    "fullText": "When envisioning the CEO of a billion-dollar company, it’s easy to fall victim to the clichés: a well-manicured businessman adorned in designer clothes, jet-setting from one international meeting to the next, a team of assistants in tow. But not every entrepreneur enjoys the spoils of their success with a glitzy lifestyle—some are simply thankful to pay off their student loans.\n\nSerial entrepreneur Sami Inkinen has founded and scaled three different companies—including two unicorns—throughout his 20-year career. While the Virta Health CEO has built wealth thanks to his business success, he isn’t concerned with his net worth. In fact, Inkinen only viewed himself as wealthy when he was able to repay the $100,000 of student debt that was burning a hole in his bank account.\n\n“There’s one moment in my life that I felt rich. And then after that, I’ve never thought of money,” Inkinen tells Fortune. In 2008, three years after Inkinen cofounded real estate search company Trulia, he sold off a batch of secondary shares worth $500,000 pre-tax. “I had enough money to pay all my student debts. I was able to buy whatever I wanted, and it was a very expensive bicycle purchase, [and] furnishing my tiny apartment in San Francisco.”\n\nThe immigrant entrepreneur first made his foray into entrepreneurship with mobile software company Matchem back in 2000 when he was still living in Finland. After two and a half years serving as the cofounder and VP of business development, Inkinen sold the organization for a few million dollars, and uprooted his life in Europe to head to the U.S.\n\nThe Gen X entrepreneur attended Stanford’s MBA program, graduating in 2005 with an advanced business degree and $100,000 of student debt. Consulting giant McKinsey floated him a six-figure job offer, flush with a $10,000 signing bonus. It was a chance for Inkinen to quickly pay off his loans, but he skirted the opportunity and returned to entrepreneurship.\n\nFor the next decade, the entrepreneur helped scale Trulia into an industry staple, before Zillow acquired the company for a whopping $3.5 billion in 2015. Now, Inkinen is 11 years into his third stint as a founder, serving as the CEO of $2 billion healthcare business Virta Health. His student loans are squared away, bills are covered, and housing is fully furnished.\n\nInkinen will always remember the excitement of financial security he felt back in 2008, but stipulates the thrill was fleeting. It’s not in his nature to be “money-driven,” the executive says.\n\n“This feeling of money bringing happiness disappeared in less than two or three days. I was like, ‘Okay, well, it’s nice that I have no debt,’” Inkinen explains. “Money isn’t going to make my life or break it, and it’s not going to bring happiness.”",

    "fullText": "The unshakeable influence of the Kardashians over the past decade has led to a rise in women trying to achieve the perfect, round derrière. But strong buttocks aren’t just an aesthetic goal – they have now also been recognised as an important indicator of our overall health.\n\n“The gluteus maximus is the powerhouse of all human movement,” says Dr Marjola Thanaj, a research fellow at the University of Westminster. “It’s a key trait that sets us apart from other primates.”\n\nA new study, led by Dr Thanaj, has revealed that the shape of the gluteus maximus muscles, found deep in our buttocks, can offer an early warning sign of the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes.\n\nA team of researchers at the University of Westminster used more than 60,000 MRI scans, collected by the UK Biobank project, to study the shifts in the muscles caused by age, lifestyle and the onset of disease. These were combined with lifestyle and health data for each individual.\n\nThe results showed that the muscles of men and women changed in markedly different ways, as each gender edged closer to developing Type 2 diabetes.\n\nIn men, there was a thinning of the gluteus maximus in specific regions – in some areas by as much as a quarter – giving it a more hollowed profile on scans. By contrast, the muscle appeared larger in women – deceptively, as this change was actually caused by fat infiltrating the muscle.\n\n“The findings suggest the gluteus maximus is a good indicator of metabolic health,” says Dr Thanaj.\n\nIt’s possible to spot clues in different bottom shapes that are likely to reflect the underlying health and function of the gluteus maximus muscle. Here are five common shapes and what they signify.\n\nWith fat evenly distributed in the upper and lower part of the buttocks, this shape is seen as highly desirable in women, reflected in the popularity of the “Brazilian bum lift”. In men, it is often associated with fitness and virility.\n\n“A round bottom could indicate good glute muscle mass and a good distribution of muscle and fat around the whole of the glutes,” says Dr Henry Chung, a lecturer in physiology at the University of Essex’s School of Sport, Rehabilitation and Exercise Sciences. “Because the bottom is more filled out, this could mean there is more muscle, which means more strength and stability.”\n\n“People with round bottoms are likely to have good lower body strength,” agrees Kate Rowe-Ham, a personal trainer and the author of the health and fitness book for midlife women, Owning Your Menopause. “They might be doing activities such as lifting weights, sprinting and climbing.”\n\nFullest at the bottom and tapering in near the waistline, this shape – most commonly seen in women – is also associated with health.\n\n“Women often dislike being pear-shaped, which means they have a tendency to hold their fat around their bottom and thighs, but it’s far healthier than carrying fat in the middle of your body, around your organs,” says Rowe-Ham.\n\nOverall size and tone matters, but if the buttocks are pert, rather than saggy, it’s a good sign. “This shape is a sign of better metabolic health compared to most of the others, showing strong mid-to-lower glutes and thighs,” says Dr Chung.\n\nThis shape has more mass in the upper portion of the bottom, with very little where it meets the thighs. It is common in post-menopausal women due to hormonal changes.\n\n“As women age and lose muscle, fat distribution can also shift from the bottom and thighs to the abdomen,” says Rowe-Ham. “They can find fat gathering around the hips and top of their bottom, creating ‘love handles’.”\n\nThis shape, which lacks volume, suggests weaker lower glutes and thighs, says Dr Chung.\n\nFlat across the hips and glutes, lacking fullness at either the top or lower part of the gluteus maximus, this shape can be seen in men or women – although it’s generally more pronounced in men due to their lack of hormone-driven fat around their hips and buttocks.\n\nIt often suggests a tendency to store fat around the middle or love handles, and can also imply reduced gluteal muscle volume or activity. “If that’s the case, it could result in lower overall lower-body strength, reduced hip and trunk stability and an increased load on the lower back and knees,” says Rowe-Ham.\n\nBoth men and women tend to lose mass in their gluteus maximus, along with skin elasticity and firmness, as they age. Flatter, saggier bottoms that have a deflated look are common, regardless of people’s weight. “I often see this even in very slim people,” says Rowe-Ham. “They might look great in clothes, but if they’re not exercising to maintain muscle mass they’re not future-proofing their bodies.”\n\n“Flat bottoms tend to mean weaker glutes, which can lead to issues such as back, knee or hip pain,” says Dr Chung. Poor posture, reduced mobility and lower strength are also potential issues.\n\nAs the largest muscle in the body, the gluteus maximus drives forward propulsion, stabilises the pelvis and trunk and enables us to walk, run, climb and rise from a seated to a standing position with efficiency and control.\n\nIt also plays a major role in how well we process and use energy – if we’re not doing so efficiently, it can lead to conditions such as Type 2 diabetes, fatty liver and cardiovascular disease.\n\n“Large muscles, like the gluteus, act almost like ‘engines’ of the body,” explains Dr Thanaj. “The healthier and stronger these muscles are, the better the body can manage blood sugar, store and burn fuel and support healthy ageing.”\n\nAlthough the new study suggested that Type 2 diabetes triggers different responses in men and women to the structure of their gluteus maximus, in both cases, there was a reduction of healthy muscle tissue.\n\nDr Chung explains that maintaining muscle in our bottoms is particularly important, as it is the main site for glucose uptake in the body. “More muscle means more glucose being absorbed and stored, which then lowers blood sugar levels,” he says.\n\n“Increasing muscle also increases resting metabolic rate – the calories burnt at rest – whereas having more fat does the opposite and decreases metabolic efficiency.”\n\nHe adds that this area of the body is also “massively linked with bodily movement and longevity – more muscle means slower ageing and the ability to keep lifting things, walking upstairs, balancing and much more for longer”.\n\nSeveral factors affect the shape and size of our bottoms, including our overall weight, which is influenced by the calories we consume and the amount of exercise we do.\n\n“Genetics, pelvic width, hip bone shape and where a person stores fat also play a huge role,” says Dr Chung. Women are biologically predisposed to store more fat around the hips and buttocks to support fertility, pregnancy and lactation, while men tend to have a higher proportion of lean muscle in the gluteal region, due to testosterone, strength and propulsion.\n\nMost of the fat we can see in this area will be subcutaneous, which is far less harmful than visceral fat found around the organs, linked to a higher risk of conditions including type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease and stroke and certain cancers.\n\n“However, intramuscular fat, deeper fat that infiltrates the muscles, reduces muscle efficiency and has a negative impact on metabolic health,” says Dr Chung.\n\nAgeing, inactivity and diseases such as type 2 diabetes and obesity are linked to higher levels of this type of fat, but exercise – particularly resistance training – helps reduce it.\n\n“Targeting the glutes is essential as we age, as strong muscles act as an anchor for the whole body so we can continue to run, jump, react to falls, maintain good balance and more,” says Dr Chung.\n\n“Take more frequent breaks to get moving,” he says. Ideally, we should aim to stand up and move every 30-60 minutes.\n\n“Elevate your heels slightly with a rolled-up mat or towel, which will help you get deeper into the squat and really target the glutes,” says Rowe-Ham.\n\nLie on your side, with your hand tucked under your head and knees bent at a 90-degree angle. Lift your top knee towards the ceiling like a clamshell opening, keeping hips stable and feet touching, and slowly lower back down. “It engages the glutes and also strengthens and stabilises the hips and core,” says Rowe-Ham.\n\n“Climb the stairs, or hills, or go hiking – find something that’s a bit more advanced than just walking,” says Dr Chung. This type of exercise will strengthen your leg muscles and give your entire cardiovascular system a workout as well as your glutes.\n\nTightening the buttocks for five seconds 10-15 times a day will activate and strengthen the muscles.\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "description": "Lena Beal, a cardiovascular dietitian, eats mostly whole, plant-based foods throughout the week. Sundays are for treats like sweet and alcohol.",
    "fullText": "As a registered dietitian, Lena Beal first learned about nutrition from her own family.\n\n\"My great-grandparents were farmers, so they grew nearly everything they ate, made their own preserves, the whole thing,\" Beal, a cardiovascular dietitian at Piedmont Atlanta Hospital and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, told Business Insider.\n\nHer roots inspired her profession. \"It was generational wisdom,\" she said. \"The foods that give us the most nutrients, the most pleasure, they're the most sustainable and practical.\" In her own life, she focuses on a minimally processed, plant-packed diet, incorporating chicken, fish and eggs on occasion.\n\nStill, it doesn't mean there isn't room for flexibility.\n\nOnce a week, Beal eats what she calls \"joy foods\": things she enjoys, like sweets and alcohol, which are best consumed in moderation. A Christian, Beal links joy foods to her Sabbath, or day of rest.\n\nEating her joy foods on Sundays is her version of the 80/20 diet, helping her stay on track with eating mostly heart-healthy foods — with the occasional treats. \"That way, I can enjoy them intentionally, but without feeling like I'm constantly negotiating with myself,\" she said.\n\nBeal shared what she eats in a week to get enough protein — and what a typical Sunday of fun looks like.\n\nGiven her focus on cardiovascular health, Beal said she has always focused on heart-healthy foods to keep her fueled throughout the day.\n\n\"It's subliminal,\" she said. \"Those things are extremely important to me: making sure I have hearty, fiber-rich, high-omega-3 foods with those macronutrients.\"\n\nOn a typical day, her meals look like this:\n\nShe focuses a lot on protein because she works out at least 3 to 4 days a week, including resistance training, brisk walking, and yoga. She said her target is reaching 150 minutes of moderate physical activity a week, the recommended goal for most people.\n\nHer diet helps her stay on track. \"Because my eating pattern is relatively consistent, it supports strength, energy, and flexibility,\" she said.\n\nBeal was never interested in intentionally following a strict vegan or vegetarian diet. Instead, her diet evolved over the past eight years to naturally involve less red meat.\n\n\"I wasn't a heavy red meat-eater in the first place.\" she said. \"I no longer enjoyed it. It was heavy for me.\" Having it once a week was easier for her because it didn't feel like much of a sacrifice.\n\nOn occasion, she'll eat leaner animal-based protein sources like chicken or turkey during the week, which have less saturated fat.\n\nWhen Sunday rolls around, she doesn't exactly go all out on sugar or cocktails, either. She still aims to stick to her normal habits, like eating a light dinner, because it ties into better sleep.\n\n\"I don't go too far out of bounds,\" she said. Treating herself might look like French toast, a mimosa, or fish in a richer cream sauce than she would pick during the week.\n\nIt's been the easiest way to keep a balance in her life. Beal, who's taught weight management classes in the past, said that words like \"diet\" or \"cheat foods\" can bring up a lot of negative feelings for people.\n\n\"I shy away from that language,\" she said. \"I call them 'joy foods' because they absolutely fit if you leave room for them intentionally.\"\n\nBeal takes a few supplements — vitamin D and iron — based on recommendations her doctor made, given her age and medical history.\n\nOtherwise, she gets all her nutrients from her diet, which she feels is easy to maintain because she eats whole foods she loves during the week, while being flexible enough to enjoy a sweet treat or glass of wine, too.\n\n\"Healthy eating works best when it leaves room for living,\" Beal said. \"It ought to feel like when you get up from a meal that you have good feelings, whether it's nostalgic, whether it satiates you. That's what food is.\"",

    "fullText": "Exclusive: German research into responses to health queries raises fresh questions about summaries seen by 2bn people a month\n\nHow the ‘confident authority’ of AI Overviews is putting public health at risk\n\nGoogle’s search feature AI Overviews cites YouTube more than any medical website when answering queries about health conditions, according to research that raises fresh questions about a tool seen by 2 billion people each month.\n\nThe company has said its AI summaries, which appear at the top of search results and use generative AI to answer questions from users, are “reliable” and cite reputable medical sources such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Mayo Clinic.\n\nHowever, a study that analysed responses to more than 50,000 health queries, captured using Google searches from Berlin, found the top cited source was YouTube. The video-sharing platform is the world’s second most visited website, after Google itself, and is owned by Google.\n\nResearchers at SE Ranking, a search engine optimisation platform, found YouTube made up 4.43% of all AI Overview citations. No hospital network, government health portal, medical association or academic institution came close to that number, they said.\n\n“This matters because YouTube is not a medical publisher,” the researchers wrote. “It is a general-purpose video platform. Anyone can upload content there (eg board-certified physicians, hospital channels, but also wellness influencers, life coaches, and creators with no medical training at all).”\n\nGoogle told the Guardian that AI Overviews was designed to surface high-quality content from reputable sources, regardless of format, and a variety of credible health authorities and licensed medical professionals created content on YouTube. The study’s findings could not be extrapolated to other regions as it was conducted using German-language queries in Germany, it said.\n\nThe research comes after a Guardian investigation found people were being put at risk of harm by false and misleading health information in Google AI Overviews responses.\n\nIn one case that experts said was “dangerous” and “alarming”, Google provided bogus information about crucial liver function tests that could have left people with serious liver disease wrongly thinking they were healthy. The company later removed AI Overviews for some but not all medical searches.\n\nThe SE Ranking study analysed 50,807 healthcare-related prompts and keywords to see which sources AI Overviews relied on when generating answers.\n\nThey chose Germany because its healthcare system is strictly regulated by a mix of German and EU directives, standards and safety regulations. “If AI systems rely heavily on non-medical or non-authoritative sources even in such an environment, it suggests the issue may extend beyond any single country,” they wrote.\n\nAI Overviews surfaced on more than 82% of health searches, the researchers said. When they looked at which sources AI Overviews relied on most often for health-related answers, one result stood out immediately, they said. The single most cited domain was YouTube with 20,621 citations out of a total of 465,823.\n\nThe next most cited source was NDR.de, with 14,158 citations (3.04%). The German public broadcaster produces health-related content alongside news, documentaries and entertainment. In third place was a medical reference site, Msdmanuals.com with 9,711 citations (2.08%).\n\nThe fourth most cited source was Germany’s largest consumer health portal, Netdoktor.de, with 7,519 citations (1.61%). The fifth most cited source was a career platform for doctors, Praktischarzt.de, with 7,145 citations (1.53%).\n\nThe researchers acknowledged limitations to their study. It was conducted as a one-time snapshot in December 2025, using German-language queries that reflected how users in Germany typically search for health information.\n\nResults could vary over time, by region, and by the phrasing of questions. However, even with those caveats, the findings still prompted alarm.\n\nHannah van Kolfschooten, a researcher specialising in AI, health and law at the University of Basel who was not involved with the research, said: “This study provides empirical evidence that the risks posed by AI Overviews for health are structural, not anecdotal. It becomes difficult for Google to argue that misleading or harmful health outputs are rare cases.\n\n“Instead, the findings show that these risks are embedded in the way AI Overviews are designed. In particular, the heavy reliance on YouTube rather than on public health authorities or medical institutions suggests that visibility and popularity, rather than medical reliability, is the central driver for health knowledge.”\n\nA Google spokesperson said: “The implication that AI Overviews provide unreliable information is refuted by the report’s own data, which shows that the most cited domains in AI Overviews are reputable websites. And from what we’ve seen in the published findings, AI Overviews cite expert YouTube content from hospitals and clinics.”\n\nGoogle said the study showed that of the 25 most cited YouTube videos, 96% were from medical channels. However, the researchers cautioned that these videos represented fewer than 1% of all the YouTube links cited by AI Overviews on health.\n\n“Most of them (24 out of 25) come from medical-related channels like hospitals, clinics and health organisations,” the researchers wrote. “On top of that, 21 of the 25 videos clearly note that the content was created by a licensed or trusted source.\n\n“So at first glance it looks pretty reassuring. But it’s important to remember that these 25 videos are just a tiny slice (less than 1% of all YouTube links AI Overviews actually cite). With the rest of the videos, the situation could be very different.”",

    "fullText": "Do I have the flu or Covid? Why do I wake up feeling tired? What is causing the pain in my chest? For more than two decades, typing medical questions into the world’s most popular search engine has served up a list of links to websites with the answers. Google those health queries today and the response will likely be written by artificial intelligence.\n\nSundar Pichai, Google’s chief executive, first set out the company’s plans to enmesh AI into its search engine at its annual conference in Mountain View, California, in May 2024. Starting that month, he said, US users would see a new feature, AI Overviews, which would provide information summaries above traditional search results. The change marked the biggest shake-up of Google’s core product in a quarter of a century. By July 2025, the technology had expanded to more than 200 countries in 40 languages, with 2 billion people served AI Overviews each month.\n\nWith the rapid rollout of AI Overviews, Google is racing to protect its traditional search business, which generates about $200bn (£147bn) a year, before upstart AI rivals can derail it. “We are leading at the frontier of AI and shipping at an incredible pace,” Pichai said last July. AI Overviews in particular were “performing well”, he added.\n\nBut overviews carry risks, experts say. They use generative AI to provide snapshots of information about a topic or question, adding conversational answers above the traditional search results in the blink of an eye. They can cite sources, but do not necessarily know when that source is incorrect.\n\nWithin weeks of the feature launching in the US, users encountered untruths across a range of subjects. One AI Overview said Andrew Jackson, the seventh US president, graduated from college in 2005. Elizabeth Reid, Google’s head of search, responded to criticism in a blog post. She conceded that “in a small number of cases”, AI Overviews had misinterpreted language on web pages and presented inaccurate information. “At the scale of the web, with billions of queries coming in every day, there are bound to be some oddities and errors,” she wrote.\n\nBut when those questions are about health, accuracy and context are essential and non-negotiable, experts say. Google is facing mounting scrutiny of its AI Overviews for medical queries after a Guardian investigation found people were being put at risk of harm by false and misleading health information.\n\nThe company says AI Overviews are “reliable”. But the Guardian found some medical summaries served up inaccurate health information and put people at risk of harm. In one case, which experts said was “really dangerous”, Google wrongly advised people with pancreatic cancer to avoid high-fat foods. Experts said this was the exact opposite of what should be recommended, and may increase the risk of patients dying from the disease.\n\nIn another “alarming” example, the company provided bogus information about crucial liver function tests, which could leave people who had serious liver disease wrongly thinking they were healthy. What AI Overviews said was normal could vary drastically from what was actually considered normal, experts said. The summaries could lead to seriously ill patients wrongly thinking they had a normal test result and not bothering to attend follow-up appointments.\n\nAI Overviews about women’s cancer tests also provided “completely wrong” information, which experts said could result in people dismissing genuine symptoms.\n\nGoogle initially sought to downplay the Guardian’s findings. From what its own clinicians could assess, the company said, the AI Overviews that alarmed experts linked to reputable sources and recommended seeking expert advice. “We invest significantly in the quality of AI Overviews, particularly for topics like health, and the vast majority provide accurate information,” a spokesperson said.\n\nWithin days, however, the company removed some of the AI Overviews for health queries flagged by the Guardian. “We do not comment on individual removals within search,” a spokesperson said. “In cases where AI Overviews miss some context, we work to make broad improvements, and we also take action under our policies where appropriate.”\n\nWhile experts welcomed the removal of some AI summaries for health queries, many remain worried. “Our bigger concern with all this is that it is nit-picking a single search result and Google can just shut off the AI Overviews for that but it’s not tackling the bigger issue of AI Overviews for health,” says Vanessa Hebditch, the director of communications and policy at the British Liver Trust, a liver health charity.\n\n“There are still too many examples out there of Google AI Overviews giving people inaccurate health information,” adds Sue Farrington, the chair of the Patient Information Forum, which promotes evidence-based health information to patients, the public and healthcare professionals.\n\nA new study has prompted more concerns. When researchers analysed the responses to more than 50,000 health-related searches in Germany to see which sources AI Overviews rely on most, one result stood out immediately. The single most cited domain was YouTube.\n\n“This matters because YouTube is not a medical publisher,” the researchers wrote. “It is a general-purpose video platform. Anyone can upload content there (eg, board-certified physicians, hospital channels, but also wellness influencers, life coaches and creators with no medical training at all).”\n\nIn medicine, it is not only where answers come from that matter, or their level of accuracy, but how they are presented to users, experts say. “With AI Overviews, users no longer encounter a range of sources that they can compare and critically assess,” says Hannah van Kolfschooten, a researcher in AI, health and law at the University of Basel. “Instead, they are presented with a single, confident, AI-generated answer that exhibits medical authority.\n\n“This means that the system does not merely reflect health information online, but actively restructures it. When that response is built on sources never designed to meet medical standards, such as YouTube videos, this creates a new form of unregulated medical authority online.”\n\nGoogle says AI Overviews are built to surface information backed up by top web results, and include links to web content that supports the information presented in the summary. People can use these links to dig deeper on a topic, the company told the Guardian.\n\nBut the single blocks of text in AI Overviews, combining health information from multiple sources, can cause confusion, says Nicole Gross, an associate professor in business and society at the National College of Ireland.\n\n“Once the AI summary appears, users are much less likely to research further, which means that they are deprived of the opportunity to critically evaluate and compare information, or even deploy their common sense when it comes to health-related issues.”\n\nExperts have raised other concerns with the Guardian. Even if and when AI Overviews do provide accurate facts about a specific medical topic, they may not distinguish between strong evidence from randomised trials and weaker evidence from observational studies, they say. Some also miss important caveats about that evidence, they add.\n\nHaving such claims listed next to one another in an AI Overview may also give the impression that some are better established than they really are. Answers can also change as AI Overviews evolve, even when the science hasn’t shifted. “That means that people are getting a different answer depending on when they search, and that’s not good enough,” says Athena Lamnisos, the chief executive of the Eve Appeal cancer charity.\n\nGoogle told the Guardian that links included in AI Overviews were dynamic and changed based on the information that was most relevant, helpful and timely for a given search. If AI Overviews misinterpreted web content or missed some context, the company would use these errors to improve its systems, and also take action when appropriate, it said.\n\nThe biggest worry is that bogus and dangerous medical information or advice in AI Overviews “ends up getting translated into the everyday practices, routines and life of a patient, even in adapted forms”, says Gross. “In healthcare, this can turn into a matter of life and death.”",

    "fullText": "Genetic researchers were seeking children for an ambitious, federally funded project to track brain development — a study that they told families could yield invaluable discoveries about DNA’s impact on behavior and disease.\n\nThey also promised that the children’s sensitive data would be closely guarded in the decade-long study, which got underway in 2015. Promotional materials included a cartoon of a Black child saying it felt good knowing that “scientists are taking steps to keep my information safe.”\n\nThe scientists did not keep it safe.\n\nA group of fringe researchers thwarted safeguards at the National Institutes of Health and gained access to data from thousands of children. The researchers have used it to produce at least 16 papers purporting to find biological evidence for differences in intelligence between races, ranking ethnicities by I.Q. scores and suggesting Black people earn less because they are not very smart.\n\nMainstream geneticists have rejected their work as biased and unscientific. Yet by relying on genetic and other personal data from the prominent project, known as the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study, the researchers gave their theories an air of analytical rigor.\n\nMembers of the research group were ineligible to obtain data from the ABCD project. But one of them gained access through an American professor who was already being investigated by the N.I.H. over his handling of another child brain study.\n\nTheir papers have provided fodder for racist posts on social media and white nationalist message boards that have been viewed millions of times. Some of the papers are cited by A.I. bots like ChatGPT and Grok in response to queries about race and intelligence. On the social media platform X, Grok has referred users to the research more than two dozen times this month alone.\n\n“It’s evil,” said Dr. Terry L. Jernigan, national co-director of the ABCD Study and a neuropsychologist at the University of California, San Diego. “It’s not just that the science is faulty, but it’s being used to advance an unethical agenda.”\n\nThe misuse of the children’s data has validated longstanding concerns that hundreds of thousands of Americans’ genetic information held by the N.I.H. could fall into the wrong hands. The agency grants widespread access to stimulate new medical discoveries. But critics say the N.I.H. has failed to address the risks that the data, even with personally identifiable details removed, could be misused in unethical research, for commercial purposes or by foreign adversaries.\n\nAt least 63 times since 2007, data from some of the 28 human genomic repositories that the N.I.H. controls was improperly released to researchers, used for unapproved purposes or made vulnerable to theft, according to government records reviewed by The New York Times. In dozens of cases, the N.I.H. suspended researchers’ access and demanded that compromised data be destroyed, but the agency relies heavily on good-faith pledges of compliance.\n\nThe misuse of the data for so-called race science is not the only example of a security failure involving the ABCD Study.\n\nThe Times learned that in 2024, the same data was improperly obtained by an unidentified researcher in China. The data is not allowed to be shared with people in adversarial countries that could use it for blackmail, spy recruitment or military purposes. But the researcher evaded that prohibition by faking an affiliation with an American university, according to a former N.I.H. official and Dr. Jernigan, who said the agency informed her of the incident.\n\nThere has been no official public accounting of how the N.I.H. lost control of the children’s genetic information. The Chronicle of Higher Education in 2022 reported on the mishandling of data from another child brain study by the same American professor, Bryan J. Pesta, who also obtained the ABCD information. But details about the subsequent loss and abuse of the ABCD data have not been previously reported.\n\nToday, the data continues to be twisted to advance an ideological agenda.\n\nWhen Elon Musk invited X users last June to post politically incorrect “divisive facts” on the social network, one of Dr. Pesta’s collaborators — Jordan Lasker, who often writes about race and intelligence under the name Crémieux — replied with a criticism of affirmative action and said white people had bigger brains than Black people. The post, viewed 670,000 times, included a chart that purported to support his claim about brain size and cited the ABCD Study as its data source.\n\nThe conservative commentator Dinesh D’Souza said on X in 2023 that studies showed that Black people, “who are the rock-solid base of the Democratic Party, have the lowest IQ of any ethnic group.” As evidence, he reposted another chart by Mr. Lasker based on ABCD data about American 10-year-olds.\n\nScientists said the unauthorized use of the data underscored the need for stronger controls. Several families in the ABCD Study said in interviews that they were not told about the misuse of the information and never would have agreed to participate had they known it could be used to promote racial division.\n\nKevin Bird, a geneticist who complained to the N.I.H. about Dr. Pesta, said the data was made vulnerable because “our scientific institutions sort of assume good faith in people.”\n\n“There needs to be an acknowledgment that there are bad-faith researchers,” he said. “The rules and regulations need to catch up with that.”\n\nIn a statement, Lyric Jorgenson, associate director of science policy at the N.I.H., said the agency had taken steps to protect the ABCD Study. It has introduced a new online portal requiring users to complete training on responsible data use and to “pass a knowledge test prior to accessing the data.”\n\nIn response to the fraudulent access by a Chinese researcher, she said, the N.I.H. “made enhancements that will prevent this type of incident” from happening again.\n\n“N.I.H. has a longstanding commitment to make the results of N.I.H.-funded research available,” she said, noting that it has approved more than 92,000 access requests since 2007. “At the same time, N.I.H. takes the protection of all human data very seriously and has numerous safeguards in place.”\n\nBut the Government Accountability Office, a federal watchdog, reported last April that the N.I.H. did not have the resources to properly monitor all the downloads of genetic data and “may be missing violations that go unreported by researchers.”\n\nThe data that Dr. Pesta obtained came from two studies. In the nationwide ABCD Study, more than 11,000 children underwent regular M.R.I.s and clinical tests and had DNA samples taken from their blood or saliva. In a separate study, known as the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort, researchers at the University of Pennsylvania collected similar information from about 9,500 children.\n\nData from the projects has generated hundreds of papers on, among other things, the effects of social media on mental health, genetic links to addiction and the causes of sleep disorders.\n\nThe data is maintained by the N.I.H. To gain access, researchers must be tenure-track professors or senior scientists with authorization from their institutions. They also must detail what they plan to do with the information. The N.I.H. can reject proposals that fall outside its guidelines.\n\nThe agency discourages “stigmatizing research” that could promote “negative stereotypes” or cause “social detriment.” That is, in part, a nod to eugenics, a discredited field of research asserting that certain races, usually white Europeans, are genetically superior. Such ideas — and the pseudoscientific studies that support them — have been used to justify violence, including by the gunman who killed 10 Black people at a supermarket in Buffalo in 2022.\n\nIn April 2018, Dr. Pesta, who at the time was a management professor at Cleveland State University, submitted a proposal to the N.I.H. He said he was researching differences in brain size and cognitive abilities in men and women and wanted access to data from the Philadelphia study.\n\nEmails unearthed in a lawsuit that Dr. Pesta later brought against the university show that he had been working with a group of race researchers who coached him on how to apply for access. One of them was John G.R. Fuerst, a graduate student from North Carolina. In a March 2018 email, he told Dr. Pesta that focusing on gender differences would be “a sneaky way” to get the data to also study disparities in intelligence between races — a topic the group believed the N.I.H. would not greenlight.\n\nGot a confidential news tip? The New York Times would like to hear from readers who want to share messages and materials with our journalists.\n\nThough Dr. Pesta later submitted updates on further research he wanted to do, none explicitly described the group’s true intentions, according to court records. The legal filings also show that another group member, Emil O.W. Kirkegaard, a right-wing blogger in Denmark, suggested Dr. Pesta submit misleading proposals to gain access to additional data sets.\n\n“I reckon that if we mask the nature of the study with usual medical terms, one can ‘get away with’ a lot,” Mr. Kirkegaard wrote in an email. “Getting samples for analyses that one doesn’t publish (to preserve your reputation!) are still useful because they allow us to validate our beliefs privately.”\n\nIn an interview, Dr. Pesta denied misleading the N.I.H. and defended his work. “I am not a eugenicist,” he said.\n\nDr. Pesta’s collaborators had a history of scrounging for data to support their fringe theories and of using unreliable methodologies.\n\nIn a 2023 paper, Mr. Fuerst tried to rank the intelligence of children across ethnic groups. But the sample size for the vast majority of groups was far too small to draw meaningful conclusions.\n\nEthnic/National group N ▼ Black African 59 Asian Indian 53 Other Asian 52 Black Caribbean 51 Filipino 51 N. Africa & Mid. East 47 White & Asian Indian 44 Native American 39 Dominican 38 Korean & Japanese 33 Other Cuban 30 White & Pacific Islander 25 Vietnamese 24 Pacific Islander 17\n\nThe paper also invented a category, “USA Black,” excluding Black children with Hispanic or white heritage and an immigrant parent or grandparent. Furthermore, the race of participants was self-reported, a potentially inconsistent gauge of ancestry.\n\nEthnic/National group Definition Pacific Islander not Hispanic & not White & Pacific Islander USA Black not Hispanic & not White & Black & non-immigrant family Vietnamese not Hispanic & not White & Vietnamese\n\nMr. Kirkegaard has published dozens of pieces in Mankind Quarterly, a journal known for pushing race science. He has studied penis sizes by race and once looked for correlations between intelligence and first names, concluding that people with “non-western Muslim names” had lower I.Q.s. Authorities in Britain blocked Mr. Kirkegaard and his European colleagues from the country’s repository of genetic data because they were “not bona fide researchers,” The Guardian reported in 2024.\n\nAnother member of Dr. Pesta’s group was Mr. Lasker, whose frequent posts online mix data analysis with ideological barbs. He dismissed Supreme Court Justices Ketanji Brown Jackson and Sonia Sotomayor as “clearly incompetent” affirmative-action hires. (During the campaign for New York City mayor, Mr. Lasker also shared hacked data with The Times showing that Zohran Mamdani had identified as “Black or African American” on a college application.)\n\nTo finance their research, Dr. Pesta and Mr. Fuerst, the North Carolina graduate student, set up a foundation that received tens of thousands of dollars from the Pioneer Fund, which has a history of promoting eugenics-related research and race science. The fund’s president at the time once wrote approvingly about the idea of “phasing out” incompetent cultures by withholding foreign aid and banning migrants “of low genetic quality.”\n\nThe N.I.H. approved Dr. Pesta’s access to the Philadelphia data, which he and Mr. Fuerst analyzed on a computer in Dr. Pesta’s home, according to a transcript of his interview with university investigators. Dr. Pesta also told them that he had uploaded the data, without N.I.H. approval, to a foreign DNA lab to try to determine the skin color of children in the study.\n\nIn August 2019, Dr. Pesta, Mr. Fuerst, Mr. Kirkegaard and Mr. Lasker produced an analysis of the Philadelphia data. Their paper — which appeared in Psych, an online journal that Dr. Pesta edited — had nothing to do with gender differences and brain size, the topic for which Dr. Pesta had initially obtained the data. Instead, it declared that among people of mixed race, those with greater European ancestry were more intelligent, and that genes were probably the reason.\n\n“These results provide support for a hereditarian model,” they wrote.\n\nThe “hereditarian model” is the belief that intelligence is largely inherited and not a result of environmental factors. Race science broadens the theory across ancestral groups, asserting that people with a European background tend to perform better than African Americans on I.Q. tests because they are innately smarter, a view embraced by white supremacists.\n\nThis runs counter to the scientific consensus that any correlation between a complex trait like intelligence and genes, let alone social constructs like race, is not the same as causation.\n\nResearch has found that the environment in which people are raised can affect their cognitive abilities. In the United States, for example, any serious analysis must consider how Black people endured centuries of slavery and racial discrimination and how they today face disproportionately high poverty rates and a lack of quality education and health care.\n\nBut Dr. Pesta and his colleagues did not focus on that.\n\nThe authors of this paper admitted that the only socioeconomic information available in the Philadelphia data was the education levels of the children’s parents. Their study didn't consider factors like family income and employment that can affect racial I.Q. gaps.\n\n2.2. Parental Socioeconomic Status\n\nOnly paternal and maternal education were available to us as measures of SES. We coded parental education as the average of each, both z-scored first. When data were only available from one parent this value was used. The final score was then z-scored again.\n\nThe Philadelphia data did not include information on skin, eye or hair color of the children, so Dr. Pesta tried to predict those traits by uploading the genetic data to an unapproved, foreign DNA lab — contributing to sanctions against him from the N.I.H.\n\n2.5. Skin, Hair, and Eye Color\n\nThe data did not include measures of appearance, so we opted to impute these based on genotypes. We used the HIrisPlex-S web application to do this. This application was developed by the U.S. Department of Justice for use in forensic investigations. It imputes skin, hair, and eye color probabilities with a high degree of accuracy based on 41 SNPs (with overlapping variants; 6 for eye color, 22 for hair color, and 36 for skin color).\n\nDr. Pesta said in the interview that his research was scientifically sound and intended to improve the lives of Black people by determining the cause of I.Q. gaps. Because “I.Q. test scores strongly predict human well-being, and African Americans are on the short end of every well-being stick, I think it’s an important problem,” he said.\n\nMr. Fuerst, Mr. Kirkegaard and Mr. Lasker did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nTheir 2019 paper caused a commotion, with scientists criticizing it for discounting possible nongenetic explanations for the I.Q. gap. Alexander Gusev, a geneticist at Harvard University who has written about the “weaponization of genomic data,” said such an approach was “playacting at doing science.”\n\n“The goal seems to be just to dig through the data and find something that matches a hypothesis about some difference in African Americans versus whites, and then report it without seriously considering any possible caveats,” he said.\n\nDr. Hakon Hakonarson, a geneticist at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, was the co-leader of the study whose data Dr. Pesta used. When the N.I.H. informed him of Dr. Pesta’s paper, Dr. Hakonarson was outraged, saying its conclusions were not supported by the underlying data.\n\n“It’s most unfortunate that the data you submit in good faith gets abused in this sort of way,” Dr. Hakonarson said.\n\nIn September 2019, a month after the paper’s publication, the N.I.H. ordered Dr. Pesta to “immediately cease all work” with the Philadelphia data and began an investigation into his use of it. But about a year later, while the agency was still investigating, it approved Dr. Pesta’s request for the ABCD data. (The N.I.H. did not respond to a question about why.)\n\nIn 2021, before Dr. Pesta published anything based on the ABCD Study, the N.I.H. accused him of misconduct with the Philadelphia data and suspended his access to its repositories for three years. It was the most severe penalty the agency had ever issued. Cleveland State fired him the following year.\n\nDr. Pesta told university investigators that he had destroyed the data as instructed by the N.I.H., but he could not say for certain whether Mr. Fuerst had made a copy from the computer in Dr. Pesta’s home. He said he had distanced himself from Mr. Fuerst, who had “gone a little bit rogue.”\n\nMr. Fuerst and his colleagues have continued to cite the ABCD data. In 2024, for example, they published a book that compiled many of their papers and mentioned the ABCD Study about 200 times. Mr. Fuerst’s co-authors have included other people ineligible to access the data, such as a professor at a state university in Russia and a freelance researcher in China who has publicly acknowledged having “no formal credentials” in intelligence research.\n\nThe papers provide fuel for more forays into race science. Invoking their own previous analyses of the child brain studies, Dr. Pesta, Mr. Kirkegaard and Mr. Fuerst have produced new papers suggesting that Black people earn less than white people because they are less intelligent.\n\nOne of those papers, in turn, was cited in a Substack article last April asserting that Black people’s supposed lack of intelligence was the source of the racial income gap. The article was picked up by an online magazine with tens of thousands of viewers.\n\nAnother paper, coauthored by Mr. Kirkegaard, was limited by what he acknowledged were small sample sizes and a lack of nongenetic data. Those shortcomings did not stop him from trumpeting the findings online as proof that “genetic ancestry, not social race, explains observed gaps in social status.”\n\nThe scientists leading the ABCD Study decided not to tell participants that their data had been misused for race research.\n\nParents and their children — who are now adults nearing the end of the decade-long study — reacted with surprise and dismay when The Times told them what had happened. They said they deserved to learn about it from the study’s organizers.\n\nScientists said they chose not to inform the families because they believed doing so could cause more harm than good.\n\n“We have struggled with the decision,” said Angela Laird at Florida International University, who helps run the ABCD Study in South Florida.\n\nMany of her study participants are Black and Hispanic and “are really the targets of these racist studies,” Dr. Laird said. “I do believe that if we sat our families down and read them the studies, they would be upset — and in many cases, that is likely an understatement.”\n\nThe organizers of the Philadelphia study didn’t tell families, either. Dr. Hakonarson said that because children’s identities weren’t disclosed, informing parents “was not something that was felt to be needed.”\n\nWhile some scientists have pushed the N.I.H. to limit how sensitive genetic data can be used in research, there is little indication the Trump administration agrees — and there are signs it is moving in the opposite direction.\n\nAdam Candeub, the top lawyer at the Federal Communications Commission, wrote a law review article in 2024 criticizing the N.I.H.’s discouragement of stigmatizing research. He compared it to the persecution of Galileo.\n\n“A liberal society should support the search for truth,” Mr. Candeub wrote, “regardless of how uncomfortable and unsettling that truth turns out to be.”\n\nDr. Pesta has claimed that he faced such persecution. He sued Cleveland State for wrongful termination, saying he was a victim of cancel culture. A federal judge dismissed his lawsuit. He ruled that Dr. Pesta was fired “because of his own misconduct” with the restricted data, not the content of his research. A federal appeals court affirmed the decision in November.\n\nStill, Dr. Pesta and his fellow race researchers have reason for optimism. The pendulum of public policy, Dr. Pesta said, “is swinging in terms of acceptance of even asking the questions.”\n\nA few days after President Trump won the 2024 election, Mr. Kirkegaard happily noted on his website that incoming Vice President JD Vance followed compatriots like Mr. Lasker on social media. His post featured an image of a red “Make Science Great Again” hat.\n\nWithin weeks of Mr. Trump taking office, the N.I.H. made a little-noticed revision to the guidelines on access to a large genetic database. Its description of what constituted stigmatizing research no longer included any reference to skin color, ancestry and ethnicity.\n\nProduced by Tina Zhou and Rumsey Taylor.",

    "description": "Nipah is a deadly virus with no vaccine or cure and considered a high-risk pathogen by the World Health Organization",
    "fullText": "India is moving quickly to contain a Nipah virus outbreak in the eastern state of West Bengal after five cases were confirmed, including doctors and nurses who were infected.\n\nNearly 100 people have been asked to quarantine at home, and infected patients were being treated in hospitals in and around the capital Kolkata, according to local media reports, with one patient in a critical condition.\n\nNipah is a deadly virus with no vaccine or cure and is considered a high-risk pathogen by the World Health Organization. Experts say human infections are rare and usually occur when the virus spills over from bats, often through contaminated fruit.\n\nHere is everything you need to know about this virus:\n\nNipah virus (NiV) infection most often begins with non-specific symptoms, making early detection difficult.\n\nAccording to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the incubation period is generally believed to range from four to 21 days, though longer delays between exposure and illness have been reported in rare cases during previous outbreaks.\n\nPatients typically develop a sudden flu-like illness marked by fever, headache, muscle pain and fatigue. In some cases, respiratory symptoms such as cough, shortness of breath or pneumonia also occur, although the timing and severity of these symptoms can vary widely.\n\nThe most serious and defining complication of Nipah infection is inflammation of the brain, known as encephalitis. Neurological symptoms, including confusion, altered consciousness, seizures or coma, usually appear several days to weeks after the initial onset of illness.\n\nSome patients may also develop meningitis.\n\nNipah virus is associated with a high death rate, with fatality levels reported between 40 and 75 per cent depending on the outbreak and the viral strain involved.\n\nSurvivors may experience long-term neurological effects, such as persistent seizures or changes in personality, according to the UK Health Security Agency’s update.\n\nIn rare cases, encephalitis has been reported to recur months or even years after the initial infection, either due to relapse or reactivation of the virus.\n\nNipah virus is a zoonotic pathogen that can be transmitted from animals to humans and from person to person, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nThe primary natural carriers are fruit bats (Pteropus species); humans can become infected through direct contact with infected bats or other animals, or by consuming food contaminated with bat saliva, urine or faeces.\n\nHuman‑to‑human transmission has also been reported, particularly through close contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person.\n\nNipah virus (NiV) was first identified in 1999 after an outbreak of encephalitis and respiratory illness among pig farmers and others who had close contact with infected pigs in Malaysia and Singapore. The episode led to the recognition of NiV as a serious zoonotic pathogen capable of crossing from animals to humans.\n\nSince then, repeated outbreaks have been recorded in South Asia. Parts of northeast India and several districts in Bangladesh have reported cases, with Bangladesh experiencing outbreaks almost every year since 2001.\n\nIn southern India, the state of Kerala reported its first Nipah outbreak in 2018, followed by sporadic cases in subsequent years.\n\nBeyond South Asia, infections have also been reported in the Philippines, with investigations suggesting they were caused by the Nipah virus or a closely related Nipah-like strain.\n\nScientific studies have identified fruit bats as the natural reservoir of the virus. Nipah virus has been isolated from bat urine in Malaysia, and antibodies have been detected in at least 23 bat species across Asia as well as in parts of Africa, including Ghana and Madagascar.\n\nDespite this wide animal reservoir, confirmed human outbreaks have so far been limited to South and Southeast Asia, typically occurring in rural or semi-rural settings where contact between humans, bats and domestic animals is more likely, WHO says.\n\n“Human-to-human transmission of Nipah virus has also been reported among family and caregivers of infected patients,” according to WHO.\n\nThere is currently no proven, targeted treatment for Nipah virus (NiV) infection and no approved vaccine to prevent it.\n\nCare for patients remains largely supportive, focusing on managing symptoms and complications as they arise.\n\nThe virus is listed by the WHO as a priority pathogen under its Research and Development Blueprint, which identifies epidemic threats that require urgent research.\n\nFollow these essential precautions to prevent Nipah Virus infection. Stay alert, stay informed, and follow advisories issued by local health authorities.#NipahVirus #PublicHealth #HealthForAll pic.twitter.com/itTuZA18ev\n\n— Ministry of Health (@MoHFW_INDIA) January 22, 2026\n\nWith no vaccine available, preventing Nipah virus infection relies on awareness and simple protective measures, global health agencies recommend. Public health advice focuses on reducing contact with the virus, whether from bats, animals, or infected people.\n\nPreventing bat-to-human transmission: Bats are the main carriers of Nipah. People should avoid consuming raw date palm sap or fruits that might have been contaminated by bats, WHO guidelines advise.\n\nBoiling fresh date palm juice and thoroughly washing or peeling fruits can reduce risk. Any fruit showing signs of bat bites should be discarded, the health agency advises.\n\nPreventing animal-to-human transmission: People handling sick animals, their tissues, or during slaughter should wear gloves and protective clothing. Contact with infected pigs should be minimised, and pig farms in areas with fruit bats should take steps to protect feed and enclosures from bats.\n\nSymptoms of Nipah Virus in humans can range from fever and headache to respiratory distress and neurological complications.\nEarly recognition of these symptoms and timely medical care are critical to reducing severity and preventing complications.#NipahVirus #HealthAwareness… pic.twitter.com/odW9baGomD\n\n— Ministry of Health (@MoHFW_INDIA) January 20, 2026\n\nPreventing human-to-human transmission: Avoid close, unprotected contact with people infected with Nipah. Regular hand washing after caring for or visiting sick individuals is essential to stop the virus from spreading.\n\nThe 2011 film Contagion, which depicts a fast-spreading global virus, was partly inspired by real-life pathogens like the Nipah virus, a bat-borne virus first identified in Malaysia in 1999, according to global health non-profit Path’s website.\n\nNipah causes severe respiratory illness and brain inflammation (encephalitis) and can spread from animals to humans, contaminated food, or infected people.\n\nIts high fatality rate, potential for outbreaks, and lack of a vaccine made it a model for how a zoonotic virus could trigger a pandemic, which filmmakers used to shape the realistic global crisis in Contagion, Path noted.",

    "description": "Two cases of Nipah virus, a rare, bat-borne pathogen, have been confirmed in an Indian hospital, prompting a nationwide alert as well as local quarantine and surveillance measures.",
    "fullText": "Two cases of Nipah virus, a rare, bat-borne pathogen, have been confirmed in an Indian hospital, prompting a nationwide alert as well as local quarantine and surveillance measures.\n\nThe cases, both in nurses working at the private Narayana Multispeciality Hospital in Barasat, West Bengal, 16 miles from the capital city Kolkata, have raised fears that the disease, which inspired the Hollywood film Contagion, could be spreading undetected.\n\n“Two nurses at a private hospital are infected with Nipah virus, and one of them is in critical condition,” Mr Narayan Swaroop Nigam, Principal Secretary, Health and Family Welfare Department, West Bengal, told The Telegraph.\n\nThe pair were on duty together between December 28 and 30. Between December 31 and January 2, they developed high fevers and respiratory distress and were admitted to the hospital’s intensive care unit on January 4 after their conditions worsened.\n\nInitial investigations suggest that both nurses, one of whom is in a coma, caught the virus while treating a patient with severe respiratory symptoms who later died before testing could be carried out, sources at the hospital said.\n\n“The most likely source of infection is a patient who had been admitted to the same hospital previously. That individual is being treated as the suspected index case, and investigations are ongoing,” said a senior health official involved in West Bengal’s Nipah surveillance efforts.\n\nThe outbreak prompted the health authorities to impose quarantine and emergency surveillance  and contact tracing measures in the area.\n\nSo far 180 people have been tested and 20 high risk contacts quarantined.\n\n“All of them are asymptomatic and tested negative. We will again test them before their 21-day quarantine ends,” Mr Nigam said.\n\nIndia’s Ministry of Health and Family Welfare issued a nationwide alert, urging states to strengthen surveillance, detection, and preventive measures to reduce risk and prevent any further spread.\n\nIndia has faced sporadic outbreaks of Nipah in recent years. The virus lives in bats and can be passed to humans through contaminated food or by contact with the bodily fluids of infected animals. It can also jump from bats to pigs, opening up another route for onward transmission to people, where it spreads from person to person through droplets and saliva.\n\nThe virus has a fatality rate of up to 75 per cent and causes a range of symptoms, beginning with a fever, vomiting and fatigue before developing into respiratory issues and swelling of the brain. Neurological issues like encephalitis can appear months or years after an initial infection\n\nIn response to the new cases, several Indian states have directed their health authorities to strengthen surveillance for Acute Encephalitis Syndrome (AES), a broad term for brain inflammation that can be caused by Nipah infection.\n\n“Persons admitted with AES, particularly those with travel or contact history linked to West Bengal, should be closely monitored and evaluated for possible Nipah virus infection,” reads one advisory issued by the authorities in Tamil Nadu, a state in southern India.\n\n“Government and private hospitals must be alerted about the Nipah virus situation and directed to promptly notify all AES cases,” it said.\n\nThe focus on examining cases of AES will help stop undiagnosed Nipah infections from flying under the radar, said Ali Althaf, a senior health official at Government Medical College, Thiruvananthapuram in Kerala, who has done extensive work on the Nipah virus.\n\n“There were over 100 cases of AES, a key indicator for diseases like Nipah, reported last year in Kerala, and if we subjected all of them to diagnostic testing, it’s plausible that we’d uncover a greater number of Nipah infections,” he told The Telegraph.\n\nMisidentifying Nipah infections as AES or as other respiratory illnesses has serious consequences, particularly for healthcare providers, he added.\n\n“We have repeatedly seen human-to-human transmission occurring within hospital settings,” he said. “When cases are not recognised early, healthcare workers are placed at the highest risk of exposure to this often fatal virus.”\n\nThe senior health official involved in West Bengal’s Nipah surveillance efforts denied the initial case had been misdiagnosed, but conceded the case had probably been missed.\n\n“I wouldn’t describe it as misdiagnosis. It’s more accurate to say a missed diagnosis,” he said.\n\nHe added: “We are expanding the criteria for testing so clinicians know when to suspect Nipah and when to order broader panels. This is not only about Nipah, several emerging and re-emerging infections, including respiratory diseases, can present with AES-like syndromes. The state is therefore expanding case definitions and lab testing protocols.”\n\nProtect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "description": "Traveling full-time was my dream, but it was bad for my mental and physical health in a lot of ways. Here's why I don't do it anymore.",
    "fullText": "I was living the dream — flying internationally nearly once a month for my work as a travel writer, crisscrossing the globe to cover incredible destinations.\n\nInvitations like cruising the Norwegian coastline and then jetting off to a buzzy restaurant opening in Las Vegas were too good to refuse, even if they were happening back-to-back.\n\nMeanwhile, the frequent long-haul flights, indulgent meals, packed itineraries, and erratic sleep schedules were quietly taking a toll on my health — I was gaining a substantial amount of weight and frequently feeling exhausted.\n\nI just told myself that less-than-stellar health was just the price of admission for this sort of career. After all, my job consisted of bucket-list-worthy experiences, like hiking in Peru and going on safari in Kenya!\n\nIt took me several years to admit to myself that I couldn't keep living this way.\n\nIn reality, the job of my dreams consisted of overnight flights where I'd get little to no rest, then hit the ground running as soon as I arrived at my destinations.\n\nAfter I'd fly back home from some trips, it would take me nearly a week to recover from jet lag. My stress levels were often cranked up, dealing with flight delays, deadlines, and navigation across different states and countries.\n\nWith grueling daily schedules on the road, I rarely had time to answer emails. I'd come home to a full inbox and even fuller calendar.\n\nThe regular exposure to dry air on planes wasn't helping my immune system, and neither was all the stress. I felt like I was constantly getting sick with colds, flus, or whatever was going around.\n\nMeanwhile, my diet wasn't balanced or nutritious. It largely consisted of indulgent meals on press trips, where I felt pressure to try everything so I could write about it.\n\nSaying no felt awkward, even when I knew I'd feel better if I could set firmer boundaries.\n\nOn top of all that, I wasn't exercising. After all, press trips run on tight schedules. I'd return to the hotel late, wake up early, sit in a van for hours between stops, and finish the day with a multicourse dinner.\n\nSome fellow writers managed to fit in workouts, but I didn't. It wasn't a priority for me then.\n\nAll the travel felt isolating at times, too. I was spending most of my days with publicists, fellow writers, and guides. They were all lovely people, but not permanent fixtures in my life.\n\nMy closest friends lived far away, and I kept postponing visits because I was always either traveling or catching up from being away.\n\nMeanwhile, my parents were getting older and needed more support.\n\nAfter nearly a decade of jet-setting, by 2019, it had become undeniable that my mother's memory problems went beyond normal aging. Finally, I felt compelled to take my health seriously.\n\nThere wasn't anything I could do to stop my mom's Alzheimer's from progressing, but I threw myself into researching the disease so I could know more about what the future held for her and, eventually, me.\n\nI worried whether a similar diagnosis — one millions of Americans share — could be in the cards for me someday.\n\nThough it's not preventable, some studies and members of the medical community suggest that certain lifestyle changes, like being physically active and managing blood sugar and blood pressure levels, may lower one's risk of developing some forms of the disease or delay its symptoms.\n\nEven if I couldn't prevent a future diagnosis, I knew finally taking care of my body and mind would be good for me. All that nonstop travel had been quietly wrecking my health, and the way I'd been living and working wasn't sustainable.\n\nIt's been over five years since I significantly cut back on travel.\n\nI exercise almost every day and try to regularly follow a balanced diet. I've since lost over 50 pounds and sleep much better.\n\nWhen I do go on trips, I do so with more intention and a lot of focus on the Northeast, close to home.\n\nI probably take an overnight or weekend trip within driving distance about every six weeks. I still fly for work once or twice a year, but I'm no longer constantly on the road, and my body feels the difference.\n\nWhen I go on bigger trips, I actually feel like I have more opportunities than I did before. Recently, I even hiked the Grand Canyon rim-to-rim, which I would never have attempted back when I was out of shape and constantly feeling drained.\n\nGiving up on my dream job wasn't easy, but I want to feel good and stay in great shape for as long as I can — even if that means finding peace at home instead of abroad.",

    "description": "Tory leader says delay will harm children’s mental health after No 10 said it would consult on policy by...",
    "fullText": "Tory leader says delay will harm children’s mental health after No 10 said it would consult on policy by summer\n\nAs a parent – and a Conservative – I know that banning social media for under-16s is the right thing to do\n\nKemi Badenoch has called on Keir Starmer to “just get on” with a ban on social media for under-16s, saying delay is a dereliction of duty that is harming children’s mental health.\n\nAfter the government said it would consult on a social media ban for under-16s by the summer, the Conservative party leader urged the prime minister to act more quickly, “however difficult to implement” it would be.\n\nBadenoch’s comments will add to pressure on the government as peers prepare to vote on an amendment to the children’s wellbeing and schools bill on Wednesday that would enact a ban within a year of it passing. The government is understood to want to wait to assess the evidence from Australia’s ban, which came into force in December.\n\nWriting in the Guardian, Badenoch said the UK was producing a generation of children who struggled to concentrate and had higher levels of anxiety because of exposure to social media.\n\nBadenoch said limits on alcohol, the age of consent and safeguarding in schools were there to protect children while their brains were developing, but the government had “suspended that logic entirely” when it came to social media. “We will not be bought off with vague promises of a ‘national conversation’ about whether we should get children off these adult platforms,” she said.\n\n“The prime minister must set out how he will act and by when. The crossbench peer Baroness Kidron, who supports Conservative peer Lord Nash’s amendment in the House of Lords, is right to say Starmer’s approach ‘is not leading; it is not governing’. He is ‘doing nothing – slowly’, which is ‘the very epitome of party before country’.\n\n Let’s just get on with it.”\n\nShe added: “Putting our children’s mental health first is the right thing to do. How much longer will we have to wait until the government agrees?”\n\nThe Conservatives made no moves towards banning social media during their time in government, though the Online Safety Act placed more obligations on internet and social media providers to protect children from harmful content.\n\nHowever, Badenoch said the consensus had shifted, with campaigners, clinicians, parents and experts now aligned against allowing under-16s access to social media. She also argued some internet restrictions for adults could be lifted if children were more protected from social media.\n\n“By restricting social media use for children, we aren’t just protecting children. We can also give more freedoms to adults online,” she said. “We will no longer need to contort digital spaces to be universally ‘child-friendly’, or impose blanket restrictions on speech and content because children might see it. If we stop treating children like adults, we can stop treating adults like children, too.”\n\nShe said her party believed in freedom but that the ability to make good choices was not yet fully formed in children, who did not have the necessary impulse control, emotional regulation and ability to assess risks.\n\nOn Sunday, the Guardian revealed that more than 60 Labour MPs have written to Starmer urging him to back a social media ban for under-16s, including select committee chairs, former frontbenchers and MPs from the right and left of the party.\n\nIn the letter, which was organised by Fred Thomas, the Labour MP for Plymouth Moor View, the MPs say: “Across our constituencies, we hear the same message: children are anxious, unhappy, and unable to focus on learning. They are not building the social skills needed to thrive, nor having the experiences that will prepare them for adulthood.”\n\nOn Wednesday another letter from campaigners urged parliament to back a ban, with signatories including the actors Hugh Grant and Sophie Winkleman and Esther Ghey, the mother of Brianna Ghey, who was murdered by two teenagers in Warrington, Cheshire, in 2023. It said national polling by the charity Parentkind had found 93% of parents thought social media was harmful to children and young people.\n\nIt said: “No other amendment to the bill on this topic has the same cross-party support or would deliver promptly the change needed to get children off social media.”",

    "description": "The Occupational Safety and Health Administration lists bleach as a Category 1 chemical with the highest human health risk of the five categories.",
    "fullText": "Soap scum is a nuisance that impacts homeowners everywhere. In a recent video, TikToker Eco OG (@eco_og) presented a two-ingredient hack to clean soap scum.\n\nThe video suggests sprinkling baking soda in the tub before spritzing around with a coating of hydrogen peroxide. Then, Eco OG allows the mixture to sit for 15 to 20 seconds before wiping it off with a rag.\n\n\"It's so easy and works every time,\" the creator says.\n\nThis simple hack is an inexpensive way to get a cleaner tub or shower — while also reducing the use of toxic chemicals in the household. Studies have indicated that the average American family spends $40 to $50 monthly on household cleaning supplies. Homeowners can decrease this expenditure by already using ingredients they have in their households, like baking soda and hydrogen peroxide.\n\nEco OG explained in the video's comments section that hydrogen peroxide is an organic compound that biodegrades completely into oxygen and water. Therefore, it is a preferable alternative to more toxic cleaning products like bleach, which can cause skin and respiratory irritation to plants and animals.\n\nThe Occupational Safety and Health Administration lists bleach as a Category 1 chemical with the highest human health risk of the five categories. This means it's looped in with other chemicals that cause irreversible skin damage and blindness as well as substances known to cause cancer, sterility, and genetic alteration ... all just to clean out your shower.\n\nTherefore, improper handling of bleach can cause numerous health threats and exacerbate conditions like asthma, while hydrogen peroxide is a much safer (and just as effective) alternative.\n\nIn addition, chlorine, one of the components of bleach, can react with minerals and form toxic compounds like dioxin and persistent organic pollutants. These compounds remain in soil and water for long periods, harming aquatic and wildlife.\n\nTikTok users praised Eco OG's hack.\n\nOne user wrote, \"​​Man I did try this and my shower turned so white. Love it thank you so much.\"\n\nOther users suggested alternative cleaning mixtures to try.\n\nOne wrote, \"Another option that works really well for me is mixing baking soda, cleaning white vinegar, dawn dish soap, and a tad bit of alcohol and lemon juice!\"\n\nJoin our free newsletter for easy tips to save more, waste less, and help yourself while helping the planet.",

    "description": "For most people, this diet tweak is a more powerful gamechanger for heart health.",
    "fullText": "Reviewed by Dietitian Maria Laura Haddad-Garcia\n\nPrescription fish oil may lower high triglycerides and reduce heart risks in 4 to 12 weeks.\n\nOver-the-counter fish oil supplements vary in quality and may not offer the same benefits.\n\nEating fatty fish twice a week is a proven way to support heart health without supplements.\n\nFish oil is a well-known source of omega-3 fatty acids, nutrients found in high concentrations in the eyes and brain. Unlike other nutrients, your body can’t make omega-3s on its own, so it’s important to get them through food—like fish—or supplements.\n\nOften, fish oil is touted for its heart-health benefits, but taking a supplement isn’t right for everyone—and improvements aren't always immediate. We spoke with a cardiologist to break down the science, expectations and timeline for fish oil’s impact on heart health.\n\nFish oil contains two key omega-3 fatty acids: eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), in varying amounts, which are often marketed as heart-healthy. You may have seen them marketed as a way to promote heart health. But before reaching for a supplement, consider this: the research is not promising for most people.\n\n\"There have been many studies conducted on fish oils over the years. Although some have shown benefit in select populations, when used for prevention in otherwise healthy patients, multiple, well-conducted, very large trials have not shown a benefit,\" says Eugenia Gianos, M.D., FACC, chair of the American College of Cardiology's Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease Council and director of cardiovascular prevention at Northwell Health.\n\nTaking fish oil without a medical reason may even be harmful. Some studies have linked fish oil supplements with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation, a type of irregular heart rhythm, adds Gianos. They should be used in patients where the benefits are likely to be greater,” she says—primarily those with very high triglycerides. Triglycerides are a type of fat in the blood, and elevated levels can increase the risk of plaque buildup in the arteries, potentially leading to a heart attack or stroke.\n\nIn addition, it's also important to consider the type of fish oil that physicians recommend for high triglycerides: prescription fish oil. That’s because over-the-counter supplements are not FDA-approved for managing high triglycerides, and their quality and dosage can vary widely. Many also contain impurities.\n\nAnother key difference is dosage. Prescription fish oil delivers a much higher dose of omega-3s than over-the-counter supplements. To reach a similar amount using nonprescription fish oil, you’d need to take multiple capsules, which can increase the likelihood of gastrointestinal side effects, including nausea and the unpleasant “fish burps” many people experience.\n\nPrescription versions, such as icosapent ethyl (Vascepa), deliver a much higher dose of EPA and have been shown to reduce inflammation, stabilize arterial plaque and lower the risk of heart attack and stroke, notes Gianos.\n\nBack to the question at hand, though: When will you notice a benefit? If your healthcare provider recommends taking a prescription fish oil medication to lower your triglycerides, you should see a benefit in about 4 to 12 weeks, adds Gianos.\n\nAlthough you can easily purchase fish oil supplements at the store or online, first make sure your healthcare provider recommends you take one. For lowering triglycerides, the typical dose is 2 grams twice daily, taken with meals.\"Fish oils are generally very safe. They are unlikely to interact with other medications and are well tolerated,\" says Gianos.\n\nFor most people, though, the best way to get omega-3s for heart-health benefits is through food.  Fatty fish such as salmon, sardines, mackerel, anchovies, bluefin tuna, mussels and oysters are all excellent sources. \"This has been a guideline recommendation for decades due to research showing benefits for the prevention of heart disease and can be a healthy way to get important protective nutrients,\" she explains.\n\nThe American Heart Association recommends eating fish twice a week—a target that supports heart health without the need for supplements in most cases.\n\nFish oil supplements are often thought to be great for your heart, but evidence doesn’t support their use for everyone. Plus, in some cases, it can lead to harm or unpleasant side effects. If you’re managing high triglycerides, prescription fish oil may offer measurable benefits within a few weeks. But for most people, eating fish regularly is a stronger, more established strategy for supporting heart health.",

    "fullText": "State provision for psychological health services is lamentable. Until things improve, let’s not judge those who turn to an app for help\n\nIt’s a sunny afternoon in a Roman park and a peculiar, new-to-this-era kind of coming out is happening between me and my friend Clarissa. She has just asked me if I, like her and all of her other friends, use an AI therapist and I say yes.\n\nOur mutual confession feels, at first, quite confusing. As a society, we still don’t know how confidential, or shareable, our AI therapist usage should be. It falls in a limbo between the intimacy of real psychotherapy and the material triviality of sharing skincare advice. That’s because, as much as our talk with a chatbot can be as private as one with a human, we’re still aware that its response is a digital product.\n\nYet it surprised me to hear that Clarissa’s therapist has a name: Sol. I wanted mine to be nameless: perhaps, not giving it a name is consistent with the main psychoanalytical rule – that is, to keep personal disclosure to a minimum, to protect the healing space of the so-called setting.\n\nHowever, it feels very natural to Clarissa for her therapist to have a name, and she adds that all her other friends’ AI therapists have one. “So do all your other friends have AI therapists,” I ask, to which she says: “All of them do.” This startles me even more, as none of my friends in London has one.\n\nI phoned another friend, a psychotherapist in my Sicilian home town of Catania, who a few years ago retired from a role at a provincial health authority and is now working in a private capacity. He confirmed that the use of AI therapists in Italy is widespread and on the rise. He was surprised to hear that I knew of far fewer people in the UK who had opted for this route. I wondered what the contributing factors might be – and I came to the conclusion that they are a mix of culture and economic pressures.\n\nAccording to a survey conducted in 2025 by one of the leading European mental health platforms, 81% of Italians considered mental health issues a form of weakness, yet 57% cited cost as the main reason for not accessing help. In my country, sadly, the words “mental illness” (malattia mentale) still carry the eerie echo of brutal state-run hospitals. The revolutionary 1978 Basaglia law (that still forms the basis of Italian mental health legislation) closed these institutions down, which led to their gradual replacement with community-based services. But the downside of their closure is a system with insufficient resources and a lack of public awareness, perpetuating stigma and difficulties in accessing care. While workplaces should play a crucial part in this destigmatisation by offering proper care, according to the 2025 survey, 42% of workers said that their employer did not offer any mental health provision.\n\nWhile almost half of European countries have currently implemented work-related mental health prevention and promotion programmes, Italy has not. In fact, within the EU, Italy invests the least in mental health. This is alarming, as Italy ranks above the European average when it comes to the prevalence of mental disorders. In fact, it is estimated that 5 million Italians are in need of mental health support but are not able to afford it.\n\nWhen I ask my therapist friend about his experience in the Italian public health system, he told me he used to be the only therapist for a population of more than 200,000 people covering four districts in Sicily. That is why he started offering group therapy sessions. For most of his professional career, he had more than 150 clients at any given time, of which only eight were part of a group. Despite an announcement last year of government plans to expand the range of psychological services, it is unclear how far this will go in benefiting the wider population.\n\n“It feels liberating to be able to tell everything to my AI therapist, knowing it is both a free and a completely unjudging space,” says my friend Giuseppe, from Calabria, in southern Italy. “When I had real therapists, and I tried three, I always entered their office with a crippling anxiety that was the result of two factors combined: the awareness that I was paying more than I could afford and the self-consciousness of doing something that, in my small town, is still perceived as only being for severe cases. Now, I don’t feel the pressure of having to get the maximum out of a session, as it’s free, and I also don’t feel judged, because a therapy app cannot really judge!”\n\nThe more I talk to my friends, the more I’m convinced AI therapy could be a revolution in places such as Italy, where we still lack meaningful strategies to tackle the stigma around mental health conditions. When I ask Giuseppe if his queerness was also a factor in his difficulties in trusting a therapist in his home town, he agrees: “I am not out with my family, and although a therapist would be bound to professional secrecy, I still had trouble trusting someone who lives in a place where homosexuality, just like mental health discussions, is not always met with understanding.”\n\nGiuseppe’s example was comforting: thanks to his AI therapist, he was able to talk about things he had never disclosed to anyone, and get more empathetic responses than any of the real therapists he had tried offered. “I’m 43 and I still live with my parents,” he says, “because my income does not allow otherwise. My AI therapist is always available to me, always calm and supporting, and has helped me immensely in examining my life and all the steps I need to take to change my life for the better.”\n\nOf course, older generations don’t always understand. In a country such as Italy – so tied to traditions – change is not always welcome. And some ethical concerns may be justified: measuring how healthy “relationships” between vulnerable people and their AI therapists really are is not easy.\n\nStill, in a digital age where our feelings are so often commodified for profit, free, clever, never-ending support can be tantalising. And until mental health support becomes more affordable, it may be the best option on the table for many people.\n\nViola di Grado is an Italian author\n\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

    "fullText": "Trial involving 4,000 children will explore impact on mental health, sleep and time spent with friends and family\n\nA pioneering investigation into the impact of restricting social media access for children in the UK has been announced as politicians around the world consider action on the issue.\n\nIn December, Australia became the first country to ban under-16s from social media, with governments in other countries, including the, coming under pressure to do the same.\n\nHowever, while experts say there is evidence that aspects of social media are harmful to most children, there has been no large-scale experimental study exploring the effect of limiting time spent on social media in healthy children as a population.\n\n“This study is a world first to try to look at that question,” said Prof Amy Orben, of the University of Cambridge, who is co-lead of the study.\n\nOrben and colleagues plan to study about 4,000 children across 30 secondary schools in Bradford, West Yorkshire, focusing on students in years 8, 9 and 10.\n\nAll participants would be asked to complete an initial questionnaire on areas including their mental health, sleep and friendships, and to download the research app on their main device.\n\nEach year group in each school would be randomly assigned to one of two conditions: the app would simply record the pupils’ social media use, or it would curtail their social media use by limiting access to the apps for TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, X, LinkedIn, Reddit, YouTube and Snapchat to one hour a day, as well as imposing a curfew from 9pm to 7am.\n\nCrucially, the team said, all pupils within a particular year group in a school would experience the same intervention.\n\n“We know that if we take away social media for one adolescent, that might have a very different impact than if we take it away for their whole friendship group for a certain period of time,” Orben said.\n\nAccess to messaging apps including WhatsApp would not be restricted, the team said, as they were important for family communication.\n\nAfter six weeks students would complete another questionnaire. After an initial pilot period beginning in April, the team planned to start the study itself in October, with the first results expected in summer 2027.\n\nMembers of the House of Lords are preparing to vote on an amendment brought by John Nash to the children’s wellbeing and schools bill which would introduce an outright ban on children using social media.\n\nThe amendment has the support of some Labour peers, and if it passes in the Lords it will then be debated in the Commons, where 61 Labour MPs recently wrote a letter to the prime minister urging him to bring in a ban.\n\nLiz Kendall, the technology secretary, reassured MPs on Tuesday that the government’s consultation on the issue would only take a few months and that it would have a firm position by the summer.\n\nHowever, Nash insisted he would press ahead with his attempt to legislate immediately for a ban, saying on Tuesday: “The time for delay and procrastination is over. Without swift action to raise the age limit for social media to 16, we are at risk of a societal catastrophe.\n\n“That is why I am urging all fellow peers to vote for my amendment, which has the backing of peers from every major party, to end the disastrous harm being done to our young people by social media and to give them their childhood back.”\n\nWhile the researchers have noted that the study, called the IRL trial, has limitations – for example students may use devices that belong to other people or may choose not to participate – they said they hoped the results would shed light on the effect of restricting teens’ social media use.\n\n“The participants’ levels of anxiety is our key outcome, and we’re also interested in depression,” said Dr Dan Lewer, who leads the Bradford Centre for Health Data Science and is co-lead of the study. The researchers would also explore the impact by looking at which apps were used and when, as well as participants’ sleep patterns, experiences of bullying, time spent with friends and family, and how they compared themselves to other young people, he said.\n\nThe trial was independent from the UK government’s announcement of a consultation on whether to ban under-16s from social media, Orben said, adding that the results may be valuable for other countries debating the issue.\n\n“The decision that policymakers need to make is up to them,” she said. “We’re really just delivering the best quality evidence we can in the timeframes that are available.”",

    "title": "Heart Rate Variability",
    "description": "Your heart rate variability (HRV) is a powerful metric of your overall health. HRV measures the difference in time between each heartbeat, which fluctuates slightly. High HRV is generally considered better. Low HRV can be caused by medical conditions, stress, or intense fitness training.",
    "fullText": "Your heart rate variability (HRV) is a powerful—if complex—metric of your overall health. Your Apple Watch automatically measures HRV, including while sleeping. We’ll try to give an overview here, but you could really write a whole book on what HRV means.\n\nA healthy heart is not a metronome: as your heart beats, the timing between each beat shifts slightly. For example, one heart beat may come 900 millseconds after another, and then the next one 950 millseconds after that. That’s healthy and good.\n\nYour HRV measures the variation in time between these heart beats. The unit of HRV is millseconds, and a normal HRV is 18-76ms.\n\nWhile HRV is derived from heart rate, it’s actually a broader window into your overall health.\n\nThe main influence on HRV is your autonomic nervous system (ANS). Since your ANS is connected to your liver, kidney, stomach, brain, and more, HRV is actually a really powerful metric of many different organ systems in your body. We’ll cover the autonomic nervous system more below, including the how HRV sometimes reflects medical conditions like anxiety, depression, dysautonomia, digestive tract problems, and more.\n\nAnything between 18 to 76 ms is a normal heart rate variability. Within 18-76ms, higher HRVs are usually better.\n\nDepending on age and sex, below 18 ms is a low HRV. This is around the bottom 10%. An HRV above 76 ms would put you in the 90th percentile of Apple Watch users.\n\nThe Apple Watch measures the time of each heart beat using its optical heart rate sensor. Apple Watch calculates HRV using SDNN: the standard deviation between normal-to-normal heart beat intevals.\n\nSDNN is defined mathematically as:\n\nSDNN = sqrt(Σ(NN_i - mean(NN))² / (N - 1))\n\nHere’s an example. Let’s say your heart is beating around 60bpm. The spacing between heart beats isn’t going to be exactly 1 second—it will vary a little bit, beat to beat. Let’s say the first heart beat comes, then a second one 1040 ms later, then a third heart beat 960 ms later, then a final heart beat exactly 1000ms later. Your NN intervals are then 1040ms, 960ms, and 1000ms.\n\nYour average N-N (normal to normal) interval is 1000ms. The standard deviation is 32.6 ms. That means your HRV\nis 32.6 ms, using the SDNN method. Other wearables like Whoop use different formulas for HRV, such as RMSSD, which we’ll explain now.\n\nThere are several formulas to calculate HRV. The two most common are SDNN (used by Apple Watch) and RMSSD:\n\nHRV is influenced by your autonomic nervous system, which has two branches: the sympathetic nervous system (your “fight or flight” response) and the parasympathetic nervous system (your “rest and digest” response, which is controlled by the vagus nerve). When the sympathetic nervous system dominates, HRV is lower. When the parasympathetic nervous system dominates, HRV is higher.\n\nA low or high HRV can have many meanings and causes, including mental health, dysautonomia, diabetes, or simply stress. Let’s go\nthrough each potential cause.\n\nA common cause of temporary low HRV on your Apple Watch is stress or intense fitness training. However, medical conditions\ncan also cause low HRVs (or high HRVs). The most common conditions that affect HRV are dysautonomia, anxiety, depression, nerve damage, abnormal heart rhythms, and some gut health conditions.\n\nOne of the hallmarks of dysautonomia is imbalance between the sympathetic nervous system (often overactive) and the parasympathetic nervous system (often withdrawn). People with dysautonomia, POTS, and Long Covid often haver low HRV. While HRV itself is not used in diagnosis of POTS, the pattern of heart rate and blood pressure when going from laying to standing is. You can book an appointment with an Empirical Health doctor\nto get POTS testing and treatment.\n\nLow HRV can sometimes be a sign of depression or anxiety. Improving HRV through practices like mindfulness, physical activity, stress management, and medication can support better emotional regulation and mental health.\n\nNerve damage (for example, from diabetes) can cause low HRV. Nerve damage affects HRV by disrupting the balance and communication between the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of the autonomic nervous system. When nerves responsible for these regulatory pathways are damaged, the body’s ability to adjust heart rate in response to stressors and environmental changes becomes impaired. This leads to a decrease in HRV.\n\nFinally, very low or high HRV can also be caused by an electrical problem in the heart (for example, atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, or supraventricular tachycardia). In these cases, an ECG can give more diagnostic information on exactly what is happening in the heart’s electrical system.\n\nThe image above shows two common abnormal heart rhythms, atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter, on an ECG. Atrial fibrillation is highly irregular, leading to high HRV. Atrial flutter is very regular, leading to no or low HRV. Either of these rhythms require attention from a medical professional.\n\nThe Apple Watch Series 4 and above include an FDA-cleared ECG sensor that can help distinguish whether low or high HRV is caused by an abnormal heart rhythm. The current Apple Watch Series 11 and Ultra 9 (released in 2025) both include the ECG sensor, but not\nthe Apple Watch SE3.\n\nSince the vagus nerve is connected with your stomach, intenstines, liver, and so on, low HRV can sometimes be correlated with problems in the digestive tract.\n\nBecause HRV correlates with so much in the body, it’s a powerful metric but doesn’t give specific diagnostic information on exactly what’s wrong. If you have concerns or questions about HRV, it’s best to talk with a doctor about your specific medical situation. You can book an appointment through the Empirical Health app.\n\nWhat is HRV and what does it have to do with health?\n\nRaquel Rodriguez Martinez, MD, MPP\n\nYour guide to Apple Watch's heart rate monitor",

No one dares to get close” said Gaza City resident Ahmed Abu Jahal, noting that the markers are less than 100 meters (110 yards) from his house — instead of the roughly 500 meters (546 yards) outlined in a map put out by the Israeli military.\n\nAs of Tuesday, the military had acknowledged killing 57 people around the yellow line, saying most were militants. It said its troops are complying with the rules of engagement in order to counter militant groups, and are informing Palestinians of the line’s location and marking it on the ground to “reduce friction and prevent misunderstandings.”\n\nUnder the ceasefire, Israel withdrew its troops to a buffer zone that is up to 7 kilometers (4 miles) deep and includes most of Gaza's arable land, its elevated points and all of its border crossings. That hems more than 2 million Palestinians into a strip along the coastline and central Gaza.\n\nPeople of all ages, some already dead, have been showing up almost daily at the emergency room of Gaza City's Al-Ahli hospital with bullet wounds from straying near the line, said hospital director Fadel Naeem.\n\nAmid the vast destruction in Gaza, the demarcation line often isn't easy to detect, Naeem said. He recounted picking his way through undamaged paths during a recent visit to the southern city of Khan Younis. He didn't notice he was almost across the line until locals shouted at him to turn back, he said.\n\nThe Israeli military said most of the people it has killed crossing the line posed a threat to its troops. According to a military official who spoke on the condition of anonymity in line with military rules, troops issue audible warnings and then fire warning shots whenever someone crosses the line. Many civilians retreat when warning shots are fired, though some have been killed, the official acknowledged.\n\nKilled while playing near the line\n\nZaher Shamia, 17, lived with his grandfather in a tent 300 meters (330 yards) from the line in northern Gaza’s Jabaliya refugee camp. On Dec. 10, he was playing with his cousin and some friends near the line, according to video he took before his death.\n\nSuddenly, shots rang out and the video stopped. Soldiers approaching the line with an armored bulldozer had fired on the teens, hitting Zaher, said a witness.\n\nA neighbor eventually found Zaher’s body, which had been crushed by the bulldozer, said Zaher's grandfather, Kamal al-Beih: “We only recognized him from his head.\"\n\nTwo doctors, Mohamed Abu Selmiya and Rami Mhanna, confirmed that the teen had been killed by gunshots and then run over by a bulldozer. The military official said he was aware that Shamia was a civilian and that the military was looking into it.\n\nMaram Atta said that on Dec. 7, her 3-year-old daughter, Ahed al-Bayouk, was playing with siblings outside of their tent, which was near the yellow line along Gaza's southern coast. Atta was preparing lentils when she heard aircraft overhead, then shots.\n\nA stray projectile whizzed close to her and struck Ahed, who was dead before they reached the clinic.\n\n“I lost my daughter to what they keep calling a ‘ceasefire’” said Atta, crying. “What ceasefire are they talking about?”\n\nA military official denied the killing.\n\nThe line's exact location is ambiguous, differing on maps put out by the Israeli military and the White House.\n\nNeither matches the line troops appear to be marking on the ground, according to Palestinians and geolocation specialists.\n\nChris Osiek, an open source intelligence analyst and consultant, has geolocated a number of yellow blocks based on social media videos. He found at least four urban areas where troops set the blocks several hundred meters deeper into Gaza than the military map-specified yellow line.\n\n“This is basically what you get when you simply let Trump make an image and post it on Truth Social and let the IDF make their own,” he said, using the acronym for the military. “If it’s not a proper system, with coordinates that make it easy for people to navigate where it is, then you leave the ambiguity free for the IDF to interpret the yellow line how they basically want.”\n\nThe military official dismissed such criticism, saying any deviations from the map amount to just a few meters. But to Palestinians hemmed in by widespread destruction and displacement, every few meters lost is another house that can't be sheltered in — another they doubt will ever be returned.\n\n‘The line is getting very close’\n\nUnder the ceasefire, Israeli forces are only supposed to remain at the yellow line until a fuller withdrawal, though the agreement doesn't give a timeline for that. With the next steps in the deal lagging and troops digging into positions on the Israeli side, though, Palestinians wonder if they are witnessing a permanent land takeover.\n\nIn December, Israel’s defense minister described the yellow line as “a new border line — serving as a forward defensive line for our communities and a line of operational activity.”\n\nThe military has continued leveling buildings inside the Israeli-held zone, turning already damaged neighborhoods to moonscapes. Almost all of the city of Rafah, on Gaza's border with Egypt, has been razed over the past year. The army says this is necessary to destroy tunnels and prepare the area for reconstruction.\n\nIn some places, demolitions since the ceasefire have encroached beyond the official yellow line. Since November, troops have leveled a swath of Gaza City’s Tuffah neighborhood extending some 300 meters (330 yards) outside the Israeli-held zone, according to Oct. 14 and Dec. 18 satellite photos provided by Planet Labs.\n\nAbu Jahal moved back to his damaged house in Tuffah at the ceasefire's start. He said he frequently saw new yellow barrels appear and the military forcing out anyone living on its side of the markers.\n\nOn Jan. 7, Israeli fire hit a house near him, and the residents had to evacuate, he said. Abu Jahal said his family — including his wife, their child, and seven other relatives — may also have to leave soon.\n\n“The line is getting very close,” he said.",

    "description": "Dr. Shah said he saw the biggest change in his personal health when he did small things consistently. Here's what he prioritizes daily.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Dr. Darshan Shah, the 53-year-old founder and CEO of longevity clinic Next Health, who's based in Malibu, California. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI've been a physician for 30 years. For the first three quarters of my career, I did all sorts of surgeries, from trauma and emergency surgery, to general and reconstructive cancer surgery.\n\nI loved surgery, and I still miss being in the operating room, but I was totally burnt out. I was not happy. I did not want to go to work, and I thought, who wants to live this way?\n\nI switched into longevity medicine about 10 years ago. I made the transition because I was 50 pounds overweight, had high blood pressure, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and an autoimmune disease.\n\nI learned the science of nutrition, exercise, sleep, and functional medicine, brought all of that to my life, and got off all my medications and diagnoses of chronic diseases.\n\nThe experience made me realize that reversing chronic diseases is the kind of medicine that I want to practice. I started health optimization and longevity clinics to help people improve their lifestyle, optimize their hormones, and get them to think about how to prevent and reverse chronic disease.\n\nI always say the most important thing is to have a really good daily routine. It doesn't need to be any medications, injections, or anything fancy. I saw the biggest movement in my own personal health journey when I did the small things consistently.\n\nI start off my routine first thing in the morning because the whole world is asleep, and it's the only time I really have for myself.\n\nThe critical thing is what I don't do when I wake up. I don't wake up with my phone anywhere near me. I charge my cell phone by the coffee machine when I sleep, which is at the opposite end of the house.\n\nThat's a critical piece of my routine, because the phone deteriorates our mornings and stresses us out the minute we wake up. I don't look at my phone until 15 minutes after I've woken up.\n\nI'm lucky to have a little puppy now, but even before I had a puppy, I would go outside. I think it's extremely important to go outside first thing in the morning. If the sun isn't up yet, I go back outside when it's up because sunlight exposure is so important.\n\nThe physical act of taking your body outside is something that has been ingrained in our biology since caveman days. Going outside sets your circadian rhythm, decreases your stress levels, and improves your heart rate variability.\n\nMy morning routine is my sacred time. It goes until about 6:15 a.m.\n\nThe physical piece of my morning routine involves a quick 10- to 15-minute workout that includes stretching and lifting weights. Even if I don't get to the gym for the rest of the day, at least I got my workout in first thing.\n\nIt's so important to get quick wins. You can even start off with two minutes or five minutes a day. It doesn't matter. Once you get that quick win, it will build upon itself.\n\nAfter I do the workout, I grab a cup of coffee and take all my supplements. I put creatine in my coffee and drink a vitamin mix called IM8. I also take a couple of other supplements, including True Nitrogen, Urolithin A by Timeline, and a probiotic.\n\nThe second part of my routine is learning something new. I read for 20 minutes. I'm usually reading two different books — one about health and wellness physically, and one about health and wellness mentally.\n\nI'll read five or eight pages of each book, and it helps me have something to think about for the rest of the day.\n\nI've been journaling for 28 years now. I'm on a streak of 10 years without missing a single entry.\n\nMy journaling routine involves me writing about my day yesterday, what I'm most grateful for yesterday, and what I'm most excited for today.\n\nI skip breakfast because it allows me to control my total amount of calories throughout the day. I'm not ever hungry during breakfast and if I eat it, I won't get as good of a workout because I'll feel bloated.\n\nAfter I drop off my kids, I'll go to the gym and workout for about 45 minutes. Sometimes I'll do a cold plunge before the workout or right after I wake up, but it's so painful. I'll find every excuse in the world to skip it.\n\nI do some sprint interval training on the days that I'm working out, which is five 30-second sprints, with a four-minute break. A lot of research shows sprint interval training is the best way to improve your VO2 max, which is your body's capacity to utilize oxygen. I also always lift weights, using every muscle group.\n\nI live in Malibu, and the closest Next Health is about a 45-minute drive away. So I try to go to a location maybe once a week. Otherwise, I have a co-working facility in Malibu, and I just work out of there because it's five minutes away from my home.\n\nMy work involves lots of things. I'm on a Zoom call here and there; I have meetings; I do talks; I record podcasts; I speak to patients. There's a nice mix of things I love to do.\n\nThere are three things that are key to every work day.\n\nNo 1: I try to spend as much of my work day on my walking desk as possible. Normally, I'll get about 20,000 steps in a day.\n\nNo. 2: I always make sure I eat an early lunch, which is always a big piece of fish or meat, with a salad. Sometimes I'll throw it in a wrap or sometimes I'll supplement it with an additional protein shake.\n\nI eat 40 to 50 grams of protein in my lunch every single day. I also get a lot of vegetables in. I come from a family of diabetics, and snacking is probably the reason my entire family was diabetic, so I avoid snacking.\n\nNo. 3: If I'm sitting, I try to make sure I'm never sitting for more than 45 minutes in a row. If I'm in a sitting position, I'll set a timer. When I get up, I'll do a little bit of exercise, like jump rope or air squats. I have dumbbells in my office and just two to five minutes of that keeps the blood flowing and keeps you moving.\n\nAfter lunch, I usually have a meeting, and then I'll put a 20 to 30 minute break in my schedule to meditate.\n\nI'll go to a quiet place and turn everything off, turn the lights down, and get into a quick meditation. Lately I've been using my Oura ring. It has this unguided meditation session where it just plays some background music.\n\nAfter lunch, I'm a little tired, and so meditating really helps me decompress, get a little rest in, and recharge for the rest of the day.\n\nI did trauma surgery for six years and it was stress bombs every single day. Now I feel like I have a good handle on my stress because I got desensitized a little bit. That being said, there are stressful situations, and I just learned to pause, look inward, and give myself two minutes to recalibrate.\n\nUsually, I'm done with work by 4 p.m., and I'll pick up my kids from the bus stop and go home. I'll usually like help the kids with some homework, and hang out with the family and talk.\n\nWe try to have the earliest possible dinner. After we eat, we go for a walk, which starts my wind down routine.\n\nAfter the walk, around 7:30 p.m., I'll get rid of my cell phone and put it on the charger.\n\nThen we change all of our lights to yellow. It's beautiful and it's super relaxing.\n\nThen we start the bedtime routine. My kids are 11 and 7 years old, and they go to bed by 8 p.m. Then maybe I do some reading, or three or four days a week, I'll do a 30-minute sauna session. I get into bed by around 9:30 p.m.",

    "description": "Cesar Carvalho founded Wellhub, a corporate wellness platform. This is how he thinks companies should approach employee wellbeing.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Cesar Carvalho, the CEO and cofounder of Wellhub, a global corporate wellness platform. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI became interested in consulting through some older friends while studying at the University of São Paulo in Brazil. Their stories about how fast you could learn and grow in the career made me want to pursue it.\n\nI applied to all the top firms and accepted McKinsey's offer to be a business analyst in 2010 as soon as I received it. It was the best thing I could imagine as a long-term career.\n\nI was at McKinsey for about two years before they encouraged me to pursue an MBA. At that time in Brazil, you could only become an associate or a manager if you had one.\n\nI applied to Harvard Business School with the intention of returning to McKinsey and continuing the consulting journey. But the summer of my first year in Boston, I had the idea of starting WellHub.\n\nThe working environment at McKinsey was super intense. I would do an average of 10 to 12 hours a day, and when there was a crunch, it could be more.\n\nAs a consultant, I often traveled to different cities or juggled between a client's office and McKinsey's office. There were no gym memberships that provided access to facilities in different locations.\n\nIf I were at a client site and had two hours before my next meeting, I would have nothing to do but extra work. I had three gym memberships that were going unused, and I wanted to feel less stressed and improve my well-being.\n\nMy experience showed me there was a need for busy workers to get convenient access to health and well-being. And I quickly realized that was true not just for CEOs, bankers, and consultants, but also for FedEx drivers and grocery store workers.\n\nIt's now been 14 years since I started Wellhub.\n\nWe're now in 18 countries, and partner with 40,000 companies to offer wellness to their employees, including many McKinsey offices. 5 million employees engage with Wellhub every month.\n\nWith Wellhub, employees can book a class regardless of the country or city they are in, without needing a membership for a specific gym or studio. Companies pay a fixed monthly fee based on their employee count, and employees also contribute.\n\nI grew a lot at McKinsey, and that was especially thanks to one thing — in two years, I worked under seven different partners, all with their own managing style.\n\nIt could change everything: the team culture, the hours you're putting in, and the work you prioritize. I quickly learned what worked well for me, and what didn't.\n\nThe best experiences I had were when we were given flexibility. Some leaders used a process I always use today: a kickoff meeting in which every single employee is given the opportunity to talk about their own boundaries and how they operate.\n\nManagers with families would say their ideal schedule was to go home early, eat with their families, and then log back on if needed. My own boundary at McKinsey was that I was willing to work as much as needed during the week, but my weekends were sacred. During my two years at the company, I worked only four or five weekends.\n\nI learned that when expectations are clear and leaders are good enough to ask and respect the boundaries of employees, you can get everything done and still have great morale.\n\nI also made a ton of friends, and those connections became really important. My Wellhub cofounder and several colleagues worked at McKinsey with me, and two of my seven angel investors were my previous bosses.\n\nCompanies benefit from having employees who are active and in a great state of well-being.\n\nIf companies don't support well-being, they won't just be less productive — they'll also have higher costs than peers who do invest in it.\n\nIt impacts the amount of sick leave and PTO people take, and plays into retention and attraction.\n\nThe trend some corporate companies have taken towards hardcore culture is completely insane. Hustle culture is a liability, not an asset.\n\nMany CEOs are missing the mark, and the consequences will show up as companies underperform those that take a more balanced approach. Hustle culture leads to burnout, and it pushes great people out before they would otherwise leave.\n\nAs a CEO, I believe in treating every employee like an adult and trusting them. My focus is always on getting the work done — not how many hours it takes or whether someone is showing up to the office.\n\nWhen I meet coworkers, we typically do a yoga session or a workout, instead of going to bars or restaurants. If you switch a happy hour for a wellness hour, and build healthy habits into everyday routines, you can improve well-being across a company.\n\nTo me, well-being means being productive, healthy, and happy. I put productive there because it means that happiness and health are being put to good use.\n\nI want to be a great CEO to my employees, want to inspire our clients and partners to join the movement, but more importantly, I want to be a great dad to my three kids, and a great husband to my wife.\n\nMy solution is integrating life and work. You don't need to be sacrificing your marriage or family for success.\n\nWhen people ask me, \"What are your hours?\" I say, \"I'm working all the time. I'm thinking about work when I'm exercising.\"\n\nI have also built rituals in my well-being journey that I almost never break.\n\nWhenever I'm traveling, I call my kids at 7:30 p.m. no matter what — even if that means setting an alarm for 2 a.m. It's a way for me to be close to them, no matter where I am.\n\nDo you have a story to share about your career as a consultant?

    "description": "ACA subsidies expiring leaves 1.4 million fewer insured compared to 2025, as CMS data shows enrollment declines in Florida and other Southern states.",
    "fullText": "The disappearance of Affordable Care Act subsidies has millions of households feeling health insurance sticker shock.\n\nA report published by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid found that there are 1.4 million fewer people enrolled in insurance through ACA marketplaces this month compared to January 2025. States like Florida, Ohio, North Carolina, and Georgia saw the most significant dips.\n\n\"People have less access to care, and that tends to translate into worse health outcomes,\" said Matthew Fiedler, a senior fellow at The Brookings Institution. He added that many households' financial security is at risk: \"People will face big bills that they either can't pay, and that hurts their credit. Or they do pay, but it requires them to skimp in other areas.\"\n\nBusiness Insider broke down the enrollment changes by state — and spoke with experts about why this CMS data doesn't yet tell the whole story of marketplace enrollment in 2026.\n\nThe number of marketplace enrollees declined most significantly in the South and Southeast, though the majority of states reported a downswing. Florida saw enrollment dive by more than 260,000 people. Registration in a few states, like Texas and California, increased.\n\nPeople might opt for a marketplace plan if their employer doesn't offer coverage, if they're self-employed, if they lose their job, or if their income is too high to qualify for Medicaid. In context, the 1.4 million dip this year is notable: Marketplace enrollment had jumped from 11 to over 24 million between 2015 and 2025.\n\nThe enhanced ACA subsidies — which were passed in 2021 and expired on December 31 — made health insurance more affordable for lower- and middle-income Americans. They allowed people with incomes up to 400% of the poverty line (which is $128,600 annually for a family of four) to claim relief on healthcare costs.\n\nA KFF estimate found that, without these credits in place, Americans in the marketplace could see their out-of-pocket premium costs more than double compared to last year.\n\nWhite House Spokesperson Kush Desai told Business Insider that \"ACA enrollment declined by 3.5 percent between 2025 and 2026 — entirely a result of the Trump administration's commonsense measures to cut waste, fraud, and abuse and remove people who were improperly enrolled on highly-subsidized ACA plans.\"\n\nEfforts to renew these credits were a point of contention between Democrats and Republicans in Congress, contributing to the latest government shutdown. Lawmakers opted not to renew the subsidies in December, and the latest ACA vote is stalled in the Senate until late January.\n\nRepublicans have said they aim to reach a compromise healthcare strategy, but a plan President Donald Trump released on January 15 does not mention subsidies. The plan lays out the administration's goals to lower drug prices and insurance premiums, implement cost-sharing programs, and increase cost transparency.\n\n\"The basic contour of the plan is contradictory,\" said Gideon Lukens, senior fellow and director of research and data analysis at the Center on Budget Policy and Priorities. \"Much less the question of how this would work, who would get what, and why this is better than directly covering people's premiums to prevent the spikes millions of people are facing right now.\"\n\nPolicy analysts told Business Insider they expect a steeper decline in ACA enrollment over the next few months. The January report is a snapshot of the marketplace landscape, but comes with caveats.\n\nThe latest data shows how many Americans selected a marketplace plan during open enrollment or were automatically renewed for their existing ACA coverage. It doesn't capture how many people have paid their health insurance premiums, meaning that more people are likely to drop coverage once they start receiving bills. A recent Congressional Budget Office report estimates that nearly 4 million Americans will lose or drop insurance over the next decade.\n\n\"Many likely signed up when the premiums they would end up facing were uncertain and then waited to see what they would have to pay,\" said Matthew Buettgens, a senior fellow at The Urban Institute.\n\nFor the few states where enrollment spiked, Fielder theorized that local healthcare policy is a factor. California offers its own ACA subsidies, for example, so residents are less vulnerable to the federal changes.\n\nBesides the direct impact on patients, Fielder also said the lapse of ACA credits could put more pressure on hospitals, because providers could see an influx of uninsured patients, and people would be less likely to seek care in the first place.\n\n\"There will be facilities that were already financially fragile for whom this is the straw that breaks the camel's back,\" he said.",

    "description": "Media mogul Oprah Winfrey is poised to change how we talk about the GLP-1 trend. \nIt's part of the 'Oprah Effect' on wellness.",
    "fullText": "Nothing has been more earthshaking than the meteoric rise of GLP-1 drugs for weight loss in the health industry — except perhaps one woman: Oprah Winfrey.\n\nJust when we thought weight loss meds had hit Peak Hype, Winfrey has entered the chat, releasing her latest book, \"Enough: Your Health, Your Weight, and What It's Like To Be Free,\" cowritten with Dr. Ania Jastreboff. The book catalogs her seemingly on-again, off-again, now committed relationship to the medication, starting in 2023.\n\nIt also comes after her full-throated endorsement of the medications. Winfrey's embrace of GLP-1s signals a decisive shift away from willpower-based weight loss and toward a medical model that is defining the American wellness zeitgeist.\n\n\"She's giving people permission to talk about it,\" said Dr. Holly Wyatt, an endocrinologist who specializes in weight management and metabolism. \"It validates what the doctors and scientists have been saying for years, but Oprah brought it to the public in a way that people really heard it.\"\n\nWinfrey secured her status as a health authority from early in her career with a unique empathy toward personal weight loss stories.\n\nHer eponymous talk show provided a rare safe space for overweight people to open up about their experiences, said Sabrina Strings, author of \"Fearing the Black Body: The Racial Origins of Fat Phobia.\"\n\n\"It was probably the only place you could go in public and not be shamed as long as you were repentant,\" she told Business Insider.\n\nA key part of the weight-loss narratives on her show — including Winfrey's own experience — is the redemption arc, Strings said, offering a vulnerable perspective on how people felt about gaining and losing weight.\n\nThat's particularly poignant in a time when celebs like Serena Williams, Lizzo, and Queen Latifah once pushed back against body shaming — but have lately been called out for promoting weight loss products or routines. Black women have been a particular audience for this new era of marketing, Strings wrote in her blog.\n\nWinfrey has spent decades leveraging her business savvy to make her personal struggle a source of strength and profit.\n\n\"She's open in saying 'I want to be thin and I have a path to do that,'\" Strings said. \"That's why she remains an icon for weight loss in the age of Ozempic.\"\n\nThree moments explain why Winfrey still moves the weight-loss market. It started with a little red wagon.\n\nIn 1988, Winfrey made TV history by sharing her recent weight loss, represented by 67 pounds of animal fat in a Radio Flyer, in the most-watched episode of the already hit show (even beating out later career-highlight interviews with Michael Jackson and Meghan Markle).\n\nIn response, liquid diets saw unprecedented success as viewers reached for the products Winfrey credited for helping her shed the pounds. It was an early instance of the \"Oprah Effect\" that appearing on her show or among her recommendations could lead to almost overnight success.\n\nDecades later, Oprah said the wagon of fat was one of her biggest regrets, and apologized for what she described as her role in shame-centered diet culture.\n\nStarting around 2004, a charismatic heart surgeon, Dr. Mehmet Oz, began appearing on Oprah's show.\n\nAcross more than 50 episodes (and later his own show backed by Oprah's production company), Oz solidified the \"Ask a Doctor\" era of TV as audiences clamored for the MD's advice on everything from supplements to cancer risk.\n\nHe also courted controversy over the years through lucrative partnerships with questionable weight-loss products and through hotly criticized statements about COVID-19.\n\nOz is now the administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, appointed to the position by President Donald Trump shortly after the 2024 election.\n\nIn the mid-2010s, Winfrey took on a new role as defender of our right to enjoy carbs.\n\nAs keto and Atkins diets were exploding in popularity, she backed WeightWatchers, snapping up 10% of shares and becoming the face of the company in an ad proclaiming her love of bread.\n\nSNL and other internet parodies had a field day, but WeightWatchers, then struggling to compete in an increasingly competitive industry, increased its value by 1200% over the subsequent three years.\n\nIt wasn't happily ever after, however. Winfrey announced she was leaving WeightWatchers in 2024. Stocks immediately tumbled by 25%.\n\nIt seemed to signal a dramatic pivot from old-school American weight loss plans full of calorie-counting and color-coding — ushering in the new Age of GLP-1s.\n\nEven while she was with WeightWatchers, Winfrey was already starting her next big love affair in the health industry.\n\nIn 2023, she announced publicly that she had used GLP-1s to lose weight and spoke out about the misconception that medication is somehow a shortcut or easy way out.\n\nThe moment coincided with widespread acceptance of Wegovy, Zepound, and their cohort in the mainstream. As many as one in eight Americans had tried the drugs at some point, embracing the idea that biological \"food noise\" and processed food — not a lack of discipline — can drive us to overeat.\n\nSince then, Winfrey has wrestled with the notion that weight loss or maintenance is about willpower. Late last year, she shared her experience quitting medication through 2025, to see if she could keep her weight stable with lifestyle changes. She said she regained 20 pounds.\n\nNow 71, Winfrey is back on the drugs and considers them a lifelong routine similar to high-blood pressure medication. Her one regret, she said, is not finding GLP-1s sooner.\n\nNow that the Oprah Effect and GLP-1s have converged, the world will be watching for Version 2.0 — the next generation of GLP-1s in pill form or with even more benefits not just for weight but potentially longevity and brain health, too.",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump suffered a stroke several months ago and has kept it from the public, a prominent medical expert has suggested.\n\nProfessor Bruce Davidson of Washington State University’s Elson S. Floyd College of Medicine made the bombshell claim about the 79-year-old president’s health while laying out “lines of evidence supportive” that have also been reported on by the Daily Beast over the past year.\n\n“I think his stroke was on the left side of the brain, which controls the right side of the body,” Davidson told biographer Sidney Blumenthal and Princeton historian Sean Wilentz on their podcast, The Court of History.\n\n“I think the stroke was six months ago or more, earlier in 2025,” he continued. “There are videos of him shuffling his feet, which is not what we’d seen previously when he was striding on the golf course. We’ve seen him holding his right hand cradled in his left. Earlier in 2025, he was garbling words, which he hadn’t done before and which he’s improved upon more recently.”\n\nDavidson also pointed to what he described as “marked episodes of excessive daytime sleepiness,” known medically as hypersomnolence, which he said is common among stroke patients. Trump is now routinely appearing to nod off in public appearances such as White House events.\n\nHe further suggested that footage showing Trump gingerly descending the steps of Air Force One while gripping the banister with his left hand, despite the president being right-handed, is “consistent with having had a stroke on the left side of the brain.”\n\nDavidson did not specify what sort of stroke he believes the president may have suffered, but said if he is correct with his claim then it “looks like he’s had significant recovery.”\n\nSpeculation about the mental and physical decline of Trump, who is on track to become the oldest president in U.S. history, has circulated for months.\n\nThe president has frequently appeared in public with large, visible bruises on his hands, which he desperately attempts to conceal with blotches of makeup.\n\nTrump has also taken steps to hide from public view his swollen cankles, a symptom of the medical condition chronic venous insufficiency, which the White House admitted the president had in July 2024.\n\nAdditional concerns were raised after Trump appeared at an event commemorating the anniversary of the Sept. 11 terror attacks with his face drooping to one side. Multiple social media users speculated at the time that the appearance could be a sign of a stroke, though no diagnosis has been confirmed.\n\nIn a candid interview with The Wall Street Journal published this month, Trump acknowledged several health issues and treatments, including briefly wearing compression socks to help manage swelling in his legs.\n\nHe also made the startling admission that he takes more aspirin than his doctors recommend for “cardiac prevention.” Trump and the White House have repeatedly attributed the unsightly bruising on the 79-year-old’s hands to his daily aspirin use, combined with his frequently shaking people’s hands.\n\nElsewhere during his podcast appearance, Davidson suggested that Trump’s erratic and aggressive governing style during his second term could also be consistent with post-stroke behavioral changes.\n\n“It’s a very serious, concerning, life-threatening, upsetting, scary event, and people react in different ways,” Davidson said. “Some people respond with humility and gratitude. Others become euphoric—‘I was at the cliff of death, and now I’m back.’ And some think, ‘That was my chance to die, and I didn’t—so now I’m going to do everything I wanted to do, because the next one may be fatal.’”\n\nIn response, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told the Daily Beast: “As the President’s physician, Dr. Sean Barbabella, has made clear time and again—and as the American people see with their own eyes every single day—President Trump remains in excellent overall health.”\n\n“President Trump’s relentless work ethic, unmatched energy, and historic accessibility stand in sharp contrast to what we saw during the past four years when the failing legacy media intentionally covered up Joe Biden’s serious mental and physical decline from the American people,” she continued. “Pushing these fake and desperate narratives now about President Trump is why Americans’ trust in the media just fell to a new all-time low.”",

You're reading stories on this site called GameSpot, so it's safe to assume that you love to play some video games, too. However, we all need to be careful with how long we play video games because a new study suggests that logging too many hours could seriously hurt our physical, emotional, and mental health.\nIn a new study published in ScienceDirect's Nutrition journal and reported on by Medical Xpress, 10 different researchers from around the world investigated the effects \"excessive gaming\" has on young people. Led by Professor Mario Siervo of the Curtin School of Population Health in Perth, Western Australia, and surveying 317 students from five Australian universities with a median age of 20 years old, the study found that \"high gamers\"--people whose playtime exceeded 10 hours a week--were at greater risk of dietary issues, sleep deprivation, and weight gain.",

    "description": "Discover how 401(k) balances in your 40s and 50s stack up and learn smart strategies to grow savings, such as catch-up contributions and Health Savings Accounts (HSAs).",
    "fullText": "The average 401(k) balance for people in their 40s is $407,675, while the median is $162,143.\n\nFor people in their 50s, the balance jumps to $622,566 and $251,758, respectively.\n\nThoughtful retirement planning is about increasing contributions in your 40s, utilizing catch-up contributions once you turn 50, and reviewing your investment mix and fees to support an earlier exit from the workforce.\n\nRetiring early requires more than just hitting benchmarks; you'll need to prepare for a longer retirement horizon, higher healthcare costs, and limited access to Social Security, Medicare, and possibly your 401(k).\n\nBut if early retirement is on your mind, your 401(k) balance takes on extra weight. Not only do those savings need to last longer, but you can't freely access them until age 59½ without penalties. That means if you plan to stop working at 55, for example, you'll need a strategy to bridge those years with other savings or income.\n\nLooking at how your balance compares to others your age is a useful checkpoint, but planning for early retirement requires going further.\n\nAccording to Empower, the average 401(k) balance for individuals in their 40s was $407,675. By their 50s, the average climbs to $622,566. Balances are higher thanks to more years of contributions, higher earnings, and catch-up contributions available at 50.\n\nAverages, however, don't tell the whole story. A handful of large accounts skew the averages upwards. The median balances—$162,143 for people in their 40s and $251,758 for those in their 50s—offer a more realistic midpoint.\n\nFor those considering early retirement, these figures highlight a challenge: many workers are far below what they'd likely need to stop working a decade or two early.\n\nIf your goal is to retire early, the math changes. Your savings have to last longer and cover more uncertainty, especially health care and inflation.\n\nMany rules of thumb assume a standard retirement age. Fidelity, for example, suggests saving 3x your salary by age 40, 6x by 50, and 8x by 60. On an $85,000 annual income, that's $255,000, $510,000, and $680,000.",

    "fullText": "PHILADELPHIA -- The health of Joel Embiid has always been a big talking point when it comes to the Philadelphia 76ers. The 2023 MVP winner has had the worst luck in that department as he was limited to just 39 games in the 2023-24 season and the only 19 in 2024-25.\n\nHe has now played 21 games in 2025-26 and has shown signs that he is back to his usual self. He had 20 points in Wednesday's loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers, and even had a moment when he dove into the crowd after a loose ball to try and ignite the Sixers.\n\nThat has to be a sign that the big fella is OK and beginning to trust his body more.\n\n\"I may be stupid, but at that time, you know, I felt like we needed it,\" Embiid said of his dive into the crowd. \"I mean, I just didn't dive just because I wanted to show off. I felt like I had a chance to sit the ball, and I did in that moment, being down in that moment, kind of every possession mattered. But we should not put ourselves in that position in the first place.\"\n\nJoel Embiid dove into the crowd to save the loose ball for Philly 😳\n\nLove the hustle 👏 pic.twitter.com/vIMHbmq7Nn\n\n— Yahoo Sports (@YahooSports) January 15, 2026\n\nEmbiid is right about the Sixers shouldn't have put themselves in that position. They were down 33-18 after the first quarter and could only shave two points off that deficit going into the half. The Cavaliers then pushed the lead to 30 as Donovan Mitchell got going for Cleveland.\n\nWith that being said, a positive for the Sixers in this one is that Embiid continues to work his way back into a rhythm. He continues to look like himself and that is going to be a key development for Philadelphia.\n\n\"I’m getting better,\" he said. \"I still feel like I'm not close to where I want to be yet, but it's a progress every single day. I feel pretty good. So, just got to keep putting the work in and get there.\"\n\nEmbiid and the Sixers will take on the Cavs again in a rematch on Friday at the Xfinity Mobile Arena.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Sixers Wire: Joel Embiid talks diving into crowd, health after Sixers fall to Cavs",

    "fullText": "Research finds no evidence heavier social media use or more gaming increases symptoms of anxiety or depression\n\nScreen time spent gaming or on social media does not cause mental health problems in teenagers, according to a large-scale study.\n\nWith ministers in the UK considering whether to follow Australia’s example by banning social media use for under-16s, the findings challenge concerns that long periods spent gaming or scrolling TikTok or Instagram are driving an increase in teenagers’ depression, anxiety and other mental health conditions.\n\nResearchers at the University of Manchester followed 25,000 11- to 14-year-olds over three school years, tracking their self-reported social media habits, gaming frequency and emotional difficulties to find out whether technology use genuinely predicted later mental health difficulties.\n\nParticipants were asked how much time on a normal weekday in term time they spent on TikTok, Instagram, Snapchat and other social media, or gaming. They were also asked questions about their feelings, mood and wider mental health.\n\nThe study found no evidence for boys or girls that heavier social media use or more frequent gaming increased teenagers’ symptoms of anxiety or depression over the following year.\n\nIncreases in girls’ and boys’ social media use from year 8 to year 9 and from year 9 to year 10 had zero detrimental impact on their mental health the following year, the authors found. More time spent gaming also had a zero negative effect on pupils’ mental health.\n\n“We know families are worried, but our results do not support the idea that simply spending time on social media or gaming leads to mental health problems – the story is far more complex than that,” said the lead author Dr Qiqi Cheng.\n\nThe research, published in the Journal of Public Health, also examined whether how pupils use social media makes a difference, with participants asked how much time spent chatting with others, posting stories, pictures and videos, browsing feeds, profiles or scrolling through photos and stories. The scientists found that actively chatting on social media or passive scrolling feeds did not appear to drive mental health difficulties.\n\nThe authors stressed that the findings did not mean online experiences were harmless. Hurtful messages, online pressures and extreme content could have detrimental effects on wellbeing, but focusing on screen time alone was not helpful, they said.\n\n“Our findings tell us that young people’s choices around social media and gaming may be shaped by how they’re feeling but not necessarily the other way around,” said Prof Neil Humphrey, a co-author. “Rather than blaming technology itself, we need to pay attention to what young people are doing online, who they’re connecting with and how supported they feel in their daily lives.”",

    "fullText": "Ian Alexander Shelton’s body was recovered from Lake Afton in Kansas more than a month after he went missing\n\n“I want people to remember him as someone who gave up a lot to be with his mom, who’s fighting cancer, and was always there for her when she needed him,” his friend Justin Stroud said\n\nDetectives confirmed that Shelton had been at the lake during the early hours of Dec. 3 and suspected he may have been experiencing a “mental health crisis”\n\nA missing man’s body was recovered from Kansas' Lake Afton more than a month after he reportedly vanished from a night out.\n\nIan Alexander Shelton's remains were recovered on the south side of the lake on the afternoon of Saturday, Jan. 10, the Sedgwick County Sheriff’s Office said.\n\nHis cause of death has not yet been confirmed.\n\nAuthorities first sought the public’s help with locating Shelton, 30, on Dec. 5 after he was reported missing, according to a news release.\n\nShelton was last seen leaving the Let’s Roll Seneca bowling alley at 9:30 p.m. local time on Dec. 2 and was considered endangered because of the cold weather and the clothes he was wearing.\n\nDetectives searched the Lake Afton area on Dec. 6 and, two days later, confirmed that Shelton had been at the lake during the early hours of Dec. 3. They suspected he may have been experiencing a “mental health crisis” at the time of his disappearance.\n\n\"We don't show any other signs right now to think that there was any foul play … I know there's been some speculation on social media about that,” Sedgwick County Sheriff's Capt. Matthew Lynch told ABC affiliate KAKE last month, noting that Shelton seemed to be with a woman at the lake.\n\n\"We are trying to preserve evidence or statements that we get in case this does turn into a criminal investigation,” Lynch said then.\n\nOn Dec. 9, the sheriff’s office led a “large-scale coordinated search of approximately 3.5 square miles in and around Lake Afton Park,” according to a news release.\n\nBut after finding no signs of Shelton after days of search efforts, organized operations were concluded on Dec. 10.\n\n“It’s just been like holding your breath for as long as you can, hoping for air,” Justin Stroud, a close friend, told KAKE of what it was like searching for Shelton alongside more of his loved ones.\n\n“We met when he was 13. I’m a little bit older than him, but we met through a really close friend of ours, and we hit it off right away,” Stroud said.\n\nAccording to the sheriff’s office, Sedgwick County firefighters were finally able to recover Shelton’s body on Saturday when an individual reported an unidentified object “floating in the water.”\n\n“This case remains an open and active investigation,“ officials said. “The Sedgwick County Sheriff’s Office extends its condolences to the family and friends of Ian Alexander Shelton during this difficult time.”\n\nStroud has remembered his longtime friend for his positive and supportive personality — especially when it came to supporting his mom during her journey with stage four cancer.\n\n“He was an amazing person. There’s not anybody that knew Ian that would ever have anything bad to say about him,” Stroud told KAKE. “He lit up rooms when he walked into them.”\n\n“I want people to remember him as someone who gave up a lot to be with his mom, who’s fighting cancer, and was always there for her when she needed him,” he added.\n\nShelton’s mother, Stacy, also paid tribute to him on social media.\n\n“I always hoped that they would have been able to spend years together playing guitar,” she wrote of her late husband and son on Facebook. “I'm comforted to know that Ian is with his Mark making music once again.”\n\nIn a separate post, she added, “I love you son.”",

    "fullText": "Exclusive: Health secretary issues invitation in push for UK to consider copying landmark restrictions in Australia\n\nWes Streeting has asked Jonathan Haidt, a bestselling author and high-profile advocate of banning social media for under-16s, to speak to his officials in his push for the UK to consider following a landmark ban in Australia.\n\nThe health secretary has invited Haidt to address an event with staff, charities and MPs after the prime minister, Keir Starmer, said he was open to stricter limits for young people.\n\nHaidt came to prominence after writing Anxious Generation, in which he argued that widespread use of smartphones had caused a mental health crisis for young people.\n\nHe has become a global activist for stricter rules, including bans on social media for under-16s and on smartphones in schools.\n\nStarmer said on Monday he would consider all options in curbing young people’s access to social media. “We are looking at Australia, there are different ways you can enforce it,” he told a meeting of Labour MPs.\n\nThe prime minister also addressed the use of phones in school, adding: “No one thinks you should have phones in schools.”\n\nThose comments reflected a change of heart from Starmer, who previously said a social media ban would be difficult to police and could push teenagers toward the dark web.\n\nFleur Anderson, a Labour MP who has been campaigning for stricter curbs, said: “I was really pleased to hear that the prime minister is looking seriously at the Australian model. It is time we regulated this and gave young people the protections they need.”\n\nStarmer’s words reflect a growing Westminster consensus in favour of such a move – one which has been provoked in part by the row over X’s AI tool allowing users to generate sexualised images of women and children.\n\nOn Tuesday, Ed Davey of the Liberal Democrats became the latest party leader to leave the door open to a social media ban for young people after a similar move by Nigel Farage of Reform UK.\n\nKemi Badenoch, the Conservative leader, announced on Sunday she would enact a ban if elected prime minister, and would push for one from opposition. Andy Burnham, the Labour mayor of Greater Manchester, has also said he would support such a move.\n\nGovernment ministers are split between those who are enthusiastic supporters of curbs on social media and those who have concerns about how they would be implemented and what the impact would be on teenagers.\n\nStreeting has been one of those most in favour of taking stronger action, telling the BBC last week: “Sometimes I feel like my concentration span suffers because of doom scrolling and the way in which information is served up in increasingly short, bite-size chunks. And I worry about what that means for the development and the cognitive development of a generation of children and young people.”\n\nAs well as the event with Haidt, Streeting has asked officials to look into the details of Australia’s ban, which came into force at the start of the year.\n\nThe technology secretary, Liz Kendall, is also understood to be looking at the Australian policy, though she has not commissioned a team to actively examine it.\n\nAllies say she is listening to warnings from charities such as the NSPCC that an outright ban could drive young people toward the dark web and undermine attempts to teach them how to use social media responsibly.\n\nBridget Phillipson, the education secretary, and Lisa Nandy, the culture secretary, share similar concerns, according to government insiders.\n\nNandy commissioned a survey of 14,000 young people that found most did not want an outright ban. She told the Guardian last year: “The challenge with banning social media is enforcement. Are we really saying as a country that we’re going to start prosecuting under-18s for using social media?”\n\nSenior government sources say they are concerned about the possibility that Labour peers will back a Conservative-led attempt to amend the children’s wellbeing and schools bill to include a ban for under-16s.\n\nThe amendment, proposed by the former minister John Nash, has been signed by the Labour peer Luciana Berger and the Liberal Democrat Floella Benjamin.\n\nGovernment officials believe that enough Labour peers could vote for or abstain on that amendment to see it pass when it is debated next week. The issue would then come to the Commons, where several Labour MPs could join the Tories in supporting it.",

    "description": "Rachel Swanson, a registered dietitian, aims to eat protein and fiber as well as a wide variety of plants to support a healthy microbiome.",
    "fullText": "Most dietary advice is fairly straightforward: eat whole foods with a good balance of protein, fiber, carbs, and healthy fats.\n\nConsistently adhering to that guidance is another story, particularly if you live a busy life.\n\nRachel Swanson, a registered dietitian at LifeSpan Medicine and author of \"Trying!: A Science-Backed Plan to Optimize Your Fertility,\" splits her time between New York City and Miami, spending about half the year in each. She also takes small-group workout classes three times a week, focusing on strength training.\n\nShe says eating enough nutrients, especially protein for muscle-building, is crucial for her. She generally aims for around 0.7 grams of protein per pound of body weight, the protein intake usually recommended for physically active people.\n\n\"Every single ingredient is going to be very intentionally added,\" Swanson, 35, told Business Insider. \"What are the foods that are going to give me the biggest bang-for-my-nutritional-buck, so to speak?\" She incorporates foods like blueberries and sweet potatoes for their high fiber and vitamin content.\n\nThroughout the workweek, she follows an \"automated\" meal plan, eating mostly foods she batch-cooked in advance. Beyond making her jam-packed days easier, preparing meals in advance helps her eat a wide variety of plants — essential for good gut health.\n\n\"I know every single day is built in support for my gut microbiome,\" she said, deliberately rotating which vegetables, herbs, and spices she uses in her cooking to increase her variety.\n\nSwanson shared what she typically eats in a day to get enough protein, fiber, and other nutrients.\n\nSwanson is typically too busy to eat a full breakfast on weekday mornings. Because she starts her clinic hours at 8 a.m., she usually packs in media interviews and other meetings right before.\n\nShe keeps her mornings simple with some lemon water, coffee, or yerba mate — a caffeinated herbal drink similar to tea with additional antioxidants.\n\nIf she has time to eat, it's usually a quick high-protein snack to keep her satiated until her early lunch. Lately, it's been homemade turkey meatballs with sweet potatoes, onions, and blueberries.\n\nMost of Swanson's lunches are pre-cooked meals, and she usually has two different options in the fridge to avoid the monotony of eating the same lunch five days in a row.\n\nShe frequently opts for hearty soups and stews. The meals usually feature an animal protein, like chicken, and Swanson rotates the vegetables and herbs.\n\n\"I like to get whatever's in season if possible — that's just automatically going to maximize the diversity,\" she said.\n\nOne of her favorites is a protein- and fiber-packed \"golden soup\" with chicken, bone broth, carrots, cauliflower, white beans, light coconut milk, ginger, and some turmeric, which has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory benefits.\n\nSwanson isn't a big snacker, but she loves a warm beverage.\n\nIn the winter, she makes hot chocolate with CocoaVia, a cocoa supplement infused with flavanols, which have been shown to have some heart and brain health benefits. She mixes the powder with non-dairy milk and a small amount of sweetener.\n\nAnother favorite treat is a homemade matcha latte. She prepares ceremonial-grade matcha with non-dairy milk and mixes in about a tablespoon of chia seeds, which add protein, fiber, and omega-3s and can also help with appetite control.\n\n\"The combination, I know it probably sounds crazy when I describe it, but it's literally like drinking boba tea because it's chewy and fun,\" she said. \"It's the easiest possible way to get 5 grams of fiber injected into your day.\"\n\nLike her lunches, Swanson also batch-preps most of her dinners, which always feature a core protein and at least one vegetable for fiber and nutrients.\n\nA recent favorite was a fajita made with grass-fed steak, which studies find to be leaner and richer in omega-3s than regular steak. She added sautéed peppers, onions, and pineapple, topping the meal with fresh cilantro to further maximize her microbiome diversity.\n\nFollowing her rule of ensuring every meal has some nutritional value, Swanson likes to make a smoothie with frozen mixed berries, frozen cauliflower, non-dairy milk, and a scoop of chocolate or nut butter-flavored protein powder (she opts for an organic, grass-fed beef isolate version).\n\nShe said it's a delicious way to get a little extra protein and fiber. \"It kind of turns out as a chocolate-covered-cherry or a PB&J flavor,\" she said.",

    "description": "Our gut microbiome has a huge influence on our overall health, but we haven't been clear on the specific bacteria with good versus bad effects. Now, a study of more than 34,000 people is shedding light on what a healthy gut microbiome actually consists of",
    "fullText": "We often hear talk of things being good for our microbiome, and in turn, good for our health. But it wasn’t entirely clear what a healthy gut microbiome consisted of. Now, a study of more than 34,000 people has edged us closer towards understanding the mixes of microbes that reliably signal we have low inflammation, good immunity and healthy cholesterol levels.\n\nYour gut microbiome can influence your immune system, rate of ageing and your risk of poor mental health. Despite a profusion of home tests promising to reveal the make-up of your gut community, their usefulness has been debated, because it is hard to pin down what a “good” microbial mix is.\n\nThe shocking discovery that our gut microbiome drives ageing\n\nPrevious measures mainly looked at species diversity, with a greater array of bacteria being better. But it is difficult to identify particular communities of interacting organisms that are implicated in a specific aspect of our health, because microbiomes vary so much from person to person.\n\n“There is a very intricate relationship between the food we eat, the composition of our gut microbiome and the effects the gut microbiome has on our health. The only way to try to map these connections is having large enough sample sizes,” says Nicola Segata at the University of Trento in Italy.\n\nTo create such a map, Segata and his colleagues have assessed a dataset from more than 34,500 people who took part in the PREDICT programme in the UK and US, run by microbiome testing firm Zoe, and validated the results against data from 25 other cohorts from Western countries.\n\nYour science-backed guide to the easy habits that will help you sleep well, stress less, eat smarter and age better.\n\nOf the thousands of species that reside in the human gut, the researchers focused on 661 bacterial species that were found in more than 20 per cent of the Zoe participants. They used this to determine the 50 bacteria most associated with markers of good health – assessed via markers such as body mass index and blood glucose levels – and the 50 most linked to poor health.\n\nThe 50 “good bug” species – 22 of which are new to science – seem to influence four key areas: cholesterol levels; inflammation and immune health; body fat distribution; and blood sugar control.\n\nThe participants who were deemed healthy, because they had no known medical conditions, had about 3.6 more of these species than people with a condition, while people at a healthy weight hosted about 5.2 more of them than those with obesity.\n\nThe researchers suggest that good or bad health outcomes may come about due to the vital role the gut microbiome plays in releasing chemicals involved in cholesterol transport, inflammation reduction, fat metabolism and insulin sensitivity.\n\nAs to the specific species that were present, most microbes in both the “good” and “bad” rankings belong to the Clostridia class. Within this class, species in the Lachnospiraceae family featured 40 times, with 13 seemingly having favourable effects and 27 unfavourable.\n\nWhy caring for your microbiome is crucial if you want to live to 100\n\nOur friendly – and not so friendly – gut bacteria lie at the core of healthy ageing. Research is now revealing what it takes to maintain a youthful microbiome\n\n“The study highlights bacterial groups that could be further investigated regarding their potential positive or negative impact [on] health conditions, such as high blood glucose levels or obesity,” says Ines Moura at the University of Leeds, UK.\n\nThe link between these microbes and diet was assessed via food questionnaires and data logged on the Zoe app, where users are advised to aim for at least 30 different plants a week and at least three portions a day of fermented foods, with an emphasis on fibre and not too many ultra-processed options.\n\nThe researchers found that most of the microbes either aligned with a generally healthy diet and better health, or with a worse diet and poorer health. But 65 of the 661 microbes didn’t fit in.\n\n“These 65 bacteria are a testament to the fact that the picture is still more complex than what we saw,” says Segata, who also works as a consultant for Zoe. “The effects may depend on the other microbes that are there, or the specific strain of the bacterium or the specific diet.”\n\nThis sorting of “good” versus “bad” bacteria has enabled the researchers to create a 0 to 1000 ranking scale for the overall health of someone’s gut microbiota, which is already used as part of Zoe’s gut health tests.\n\n“Think of a healthy gut microbiome as a community of chemical factories. We want large numbers of species, we want the good ones outnumbering the bad ones, and when you get that, then you’re producing really healthy chemicals, which have impacts across the body,” says team member Tim Spector at King’s College London, co-founder of Zoe.\n\nThe surprising relationship between your microbiome and sleeping well\n\nResearch is revealing the complex relationship between sleep and the gut microbiome, raising the prospect that eating better during the day might help you get a better night’s rest\n\nThis doesn’t mean the ideal healthy gut microbiome has been pinned down, though. “Defining a healthy microbiome is a difficult task, as the gut microbiome composition is impacted by diet, but it can also change with environmental factors, age and health conditions that require long-term medication,” says Moura.\n\n“We really need to think about our body and our microbiome as two complex systems that together make one even more complex system,” says Segata. “When you change one thing, everything is modified a bit as a consequence. Understanding what is cause and effect in many cases can be very intricate.”\n\nBigger studies are needed to tease out these links and cover more of the global population, says Segata. However, once we have established the baseline of your health and microbiome, it should become possible to recommend specific foods to tweak your gut bacteria, he says.\n\nNature DOI: 10.1038/s41586-025-09854-7\n\nReceive a weekly dose of discovery in your inbox.

    "description": "Winfrey appeared on 'Today' to promote her new book, 'Enough.'",
    "fullText": "Sheinelle Jones‘ second day as the fourth of Today‘s new cohost featured a very special guest.\n\nOprah Winfrey stopped by the NBC morning show to promote her new book, Enough: Your Health, Your Weight, and What It’s Like To Be Free, which she cowrote with endocrinologist and associate professor at the Yale School of Medicine Dr. Ania M. Jastreboff. While reflecting on her weight-loss journey, Winfrey shared some surprising side effects she’s experienced while taking a GLP-1 medication.\n\nJastreboff stated that the most common symptoms for people taking weight-loss medication include nausea, diarrhea, and constipation.\n\n“I never had nausea or diarrhea, but I did have the third one,” Winfrey stated. “I finally figured out, for me, what the right combination of magnesium and water is. I have to drink a lot of water. I have to have a gallon of water a day.”\n\nAccording to Winfrey, she has to finish drinking her gallon of water before 4 p.m., or else she will be up all night. While drinking lots of water makes Winfrey’s kidneys “very happy,” Jastreboff said there are other ways to “lessen nausea” while on weight-loss medication.\n\n“The most important way is working with your healthcare provider and going up very, very slowly. So, start slow, go slow. If you’re feeling nauseated, then don’t increase the dose,” she explained. “And there’s other things — not eating past the point of fullness, making sure you’re monitoring which foods could make you worse. All of these different things can lower the side effects.”\n\nWinfrey revealed that she gained 20 pounds last year after going off of her medication to test if she would retain her weight loss without the drug. “If you’re on blood pressure medication, you get your blood pressure to the level that your doctor says is healthy for you, you come off the medication, your blood pressure is gonna go up,” she stated. “The same thing is true for this. I know it ’cause I proved it.”\n\nEarlier in the episode, Winfrey said she has a newfound sense of freedom since starting a GLP-1 prescription. “The new freedom is understanding that all those years that I suffered and was on the tabloids every week and made fun of and was the butt of everybody’s jokes, and I thought it was because of my lack of willpower,” she told Jones and Jenna Bush Hager. “[I thought] ‘What is wrong with me that I can be successful in so many ways and I can’t conquer this thing?’ Now I know that it has nothing to do with willpower. It has everything to do with your biology.”\n\nWinfrey said she hopes her and Jastreboff’s new book will help change the conversation about obesity and weight loss. “Back in the day, when I first started The Oprah [Winfrey] Show, in ’86, ’87, we did our first show on alcoholism. And people in the audience were like, ‘Oh, just put the bottle down,'” she recalled. “People did not recognize — refused to recognize — that alcoholism is a disease. And so, now we’re saying the same thing about obesity.”\n\nWinfrey continued, “It’s a disease. It’s a chronic disease. You have to manage it. And even when you think you’ve gotten to your goal weight, it’s not the answer because what the medications do is manage the set point in your body.”\n\nToday With Jenna & Sheinelle, Weekdays, 10 a.m./9c, NBC\n\nRead the latest entertainment news on TV Insider.",

    "description": "When Kris LeBoutillier's mom got older and her health declined, she wanted him closer to home. \"Haven't you been in Singapore long enough?,\" she asked him.",
    "fullText": "I grew up on the shores of Lake Erie, in a town just south of Buffalo, New York. Ice was something we chiseled off a car in winter, not something that's dropped into a drink. For me, life on a tropical island was a pipe dream.\n\nIn high school, I was the geeky kid, always excited to read stories in Time and The New York Times about exotic, far-off places. I knew early on that I wanted a job that would allow me to experience global events firsthand.\n\nA semester abroad in France cemented my ambition. I lived with a family who also rented to an American expat. He talked casually about his Swiss ski holidays, escapes to Greece and Turkey, and his favorite cafés in Paris.\n\nI already knew then, at 21, that was the life I wanted. Why work in \"boring\" New York or Chicago when I could aim for Paris, Hong Kong, or London?\n\nAfter working as an editor in New York City for several years, my then-wife got offered a job in Singapore. It was the golden opportunity we both wanted. What we thought would be a posting of just a few years turned into decades. We divorced in 2011, but both stayed in Singapore, building our careers and lives.\n\nI'd always wanted to be a photojournalist, so in 2000 I decided to pursue it full-time. My location made me a standout. Asia was entering a travel boom, and magazine editors needed photographers on the ground. To paraphrase the cliché: I was in the right place at the perfect moment.\n\nI've shot for National Geographic Traveler across Australia, Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand, and India — Singapore was the perfect base. I could be ready to go anywhere in Southeast Asia with just a few hours' notice.\n\nMy photography career eventually gave way to something more permanent and corporate, although still rooted in Singapore. I became a content director, producing and directing videos across the region.\n\nIt was a natural evolution for a writer-photographer in a world rapidly shifting to digital content.\n\nBut it has come with a cost. My mother grew older, got sick, moved into a managed care facility, and then passed away suddenly.\n\nI made every effort to visit twice a year, especially in the summer and around Christmas. But there was always a tinge of guilt and remorse that I wasn't there more.\n\nOn one of my last trips back before she died, I remember her saying, \"Haven't you been in Singapore long enough?\" She was always supportive of my choices, but as she approached 80, and her health declined, she wanted me closer to home.\n\nShe was getting the care she needed in the nursing home, but there was no substitute for a visit from me, my presence — complete with stories about my life overseas.\n\nWas I selfish? Perhaps, but I also would never trade the life I have.\n\nProbably, although I'm not sure, because everything is different. I remarried three years ago. I have a 9-year-old daughter from a previous marriage and a toddler son with my wife, Jamie. Both kids have US passports and deserve an American identity and a place to put down roots. They've been to the US to meet their cousins and my oldest friends, but have never had the chance to live there or fully experience life as Americans.\n\nRecently, I told my daughter that she'd visited Manhattan when she was a toddler. Her response: \"Where is that?\" It was a stark realization.\n\nThey should know the country that shaped who I am.\n\nWould I recommend an expat life to someone? Absolutely. I got the life I dreamed of. And despite the challenges and distance, it gave me everything I hoped for when I was that kid, growing up near Buffalo, reading about the rest of the world.\n\nDo you have a story to share about living abroad?

    "fullText": "Dr. Mehmet Oz made the case that improving Americans’ health through better diets could transform both the nation's economy and healthcare spending.\n\nOz, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, connected the dots between improved public health and workforce participation during a White House press conference this week. If Americans could stay healthy enough to work just one additional year beyond the current average retirement age of 61, it would “increase the overall GDP of our nation by trillions of dollars,” he said.\n\n“We will reduce healthcare expenses,” Oz said. “At the same time, we jazz up the U.S. economy with trillions of dollars created by the productivity of American workers.”\n\nFast Company Calls It a ‘Groundbreaking Step for the Creator Economy' — Investors Can Still Get In at $0.85/Share\n\nSam Altman Says AI Will Transform the Economy — This Platform Lets Investors Back Private Tech Early\n\nOz praised the Trump administration's updated dietary guidelines, which encourage Americans to prioritize whole foods, proteins and healthy fats while reducing ultraprocessed food and added sugar.\n\n“The best way to reduce drug spend in America is to not need the drugs in the first place,” he said. He said that new guidelines could cut demand for expensive medications like GLP-1 drugs and autoimmune treatments by helping prevent chronic diseases from developing. “You can’t be a wealthy nation without being a healthy nation,” he said.\n\nHe pointed to data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services showing that roughly 30% of Medicare spending, about $300 billion a year, is directly tied to obesity. “If we were to affect obesity by 10%, which is an incredibly conservative and justifiable assumption… just that alone is $30 billion of reduction of expenses for Medicare,” he said.\n\nTrending: An EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace—Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform Before the Raise Ends 1/19\n\nOz highlighted the importance of reaching children early, saying that 53% of U.S. children are covered by Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program. Programs teaching families how to implement the new dietary guidelines, he said, “will dramatically change the natural history of how children are able to participate in life.”\n\nHealth Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said at the press conference that reducing healthcare costs requires upfront investments in education and access to healthy food. “The idea that a cheap meal made of processed food is cheap is an illusion, because you’re paying for it on the back end,” he said. “You’re paying for it with diabetes, with obesity, with illness.”",

    "title": "Noise sensitivity disrupts the mind, brain and body",
    "description": "Though noise sensitivity is often dismissed by doctors, it can have long-term effects on our mental and physical health.",
    "fullText": "Though noise sensitivity is often dismissed by doctors, it can have long-term effects on our mental and physical health.\n\nTap, tap, tap. Tap, tap, tap. There it was again: the incessant noise from my new upstairs neighbours, evidently still in the process of hanging up pictures or cobbling together new furniture. In my well-insulated building in central Berlin, the noise was well below decibels that would irritate anyone else. But it sent me into a rage.\n\nA tight sensation of stress rushed through my body. Even worse was the anxiety: \"When will they ever be finished?\"\n\nThat's not the only noise that is bothering me. I notice the soft thudding across my ceilings as people get ready for bed. Somewhere in the building, I hear the high-pitched hum of a vacuum cleaner and the muffled thumping of a washing machine. The neighbour's dachshund yapping for a treat. And don't get me started on the leaf blowers and pressure washers outside. Noise – however slight – breaks my concentration and peace of mind.\n\nIt is fair to say that I – along with 10% to 40% of the general population – am noise-sensitive, meaning that I feel more upset and disturbed by noise than the average person. It would be easy to dismiss noise sensitivity as a personality flaw, a symptom of generally being belligerent, whiny, and irritable. But, in recent years, scientists have learned that it has real biological roots. The brains of noise-sensitive people respond differently to sound and some may actually be born that way. What's more, it affects not only people's immediate mood but also their long-term mental and physical health. While there are few easy solutions, being aware of these effects can help noise-sensitive people take action to make their lives more tolerable.\n\n\"It's been one of those what we might call a wastepaper basket sort of issues… that just gets pushed away by health professionals,\" says neuroscientist Daniel Shepherd of Auckland University of Technology in New Zealand. Only in recent years \"have people actually really started to say, right, this is at an experiential level really impacting patients\", he adds. \"We really need to actually start getting a handle on this.\"\n\nNoise sensitivity isn't a formal medical diagnosis. People can find out if they're noise sensitive by taking questionnaires like the 21-question Weinstein's noise sensitivity scale (which asks, for instance, if you're bothered by people whispering and crinkling sweet wrappers in a movie theatre, if you get mad at people making noise when you're trying to sleep or work, even if the sound of music bothers you if you're trying to concentrate.)\n\nNoise sensitivity is different from other sound-related conditions like misophonia. This is a specific decreased tolerance to certain sounds, like chewing, throat-clearing, tapping or ticking, which trigger intense feelings of disgust or rage, explains Jennifer Brout, a clinician and the founder of the US-based International Misophonia Research Network. Noise sensitivity is also different from hyperacusis, where people feel pain or extreme discomfort because they perceive sounds more loudly than they actually are.\n\nNoise sensitivity, by contrast, is a general reactiveness to all sounds, regardless of how loud they're perceived or how loud they actually are. At the very least, noise-sensitive people find sound disruptive and become annoyed, angry, or even fearful or anxious. \"I remember a person describing it like having a mosquito flying around you,\" Shepherd says. \"You just can't not attend to it.\"\n\nFor those who are afraid of noise, the condition might make them so stressed that their bodies go into a fight-or-flight response. \"Your heart rate goes up, your blood pressure goes up,\" says Stephen Stansfeld, a psychiatrist and professor emeritus at Queen Mary University of London.\n\nSleep quality can also take a hit. In one 2021 study, researchers tracked the sleeping patterns of 500 adults in China and nighttime noise levels over the course of a week. They found that, while the noise itself didn't affect people's sleep quality, noise-sensitive individuals tended to find their sleep less restorative, rating their sleep as less refreshing and saying they felt moodier and had less energy during the day.\n\nNoise exposure has also been linked to a range of long-term health effects, including heart disease and diabetes – and noise-sensitive people may suffer the most from  mental health impacts, Stansfeld says. In one 2021 study, Stansfeld and his colleagues surveyed 2,398 men in the Welsh town of Caerphilly who were exposed to different levels of road traffic noise. Those who were noise-sensitive were more likely to have long-term anxiety and depression.\n\nWhile that may be partly because anxious people are more vigilant about their surroundings and therefore more likely to notice noise, it's also possible that being noise sensitive can worsen anxiety. And, one 2023 survey of 1,244 adults living near airports in France found that people severely annoyed by aircraft noise levels – especially some noise-sensitive individuals – were more likely to rate their general health as poor.\n\nBut why do some people react more negatively to noise than others? Studies on the brains of noise-sensitive people reveal some clues. When Shepherd and his colleagues hooked people up to devices that measured the electrical activity in their brains, those without noise sensitivity only showed heightened activity when the researchers played them threatening sounds. But in noise-sensitive people, \"their brains tend to go up the gears irrespective of the sound, whether it's a threatening sound or a non-threatening sound\", Shepherd recalls.\n\nBoth Shepherd and the neuroscientist Elvira Brattico of Denmark's Aarhus University have independently found evidence that this has to do with how the brain filters out information about unimportant sounds. Shepherd's team found evidence that in noise-sensitive people, a specific clump of cells within the medial geniculate nucleus – a relay station for sound information entering the brain – are less efficient at this filtering task compared to the brains of those without the condition.\n\nWhere most people can \"filter this information out and get on with life, those who have noise sensitivity don't do it as easily\", he says. This kind of filtering also seems to be important during sleep. While most people show patterns of electrical activity called spindles as they fall asleep, which are thought to be important in getting used to surrounding noise, people with noise-sensitivity have less of them – helping explain why they stay so reactive to sounds that normal people aren't bothered by.\n\nHow brains end up this way, though, is a mystery. One Finnish study on twins suggests that noise sensitivity is often heritable, so some people might be predisposed to have it from birth. But it's also possible that people living in noisy environments develop sensitivity over time, Brattico says.\n\nPeople with anxiety, schizophrenia and autism are especially likely to develop noise sensitivity. While some people can get it after suffering traumatic brain injuries, for most it's usually something that persists over a lifetime, Stansfeld says. \"It is very difficult, as compared to someone who's not noise-sensitive, to actually habituate to sound and actually desensitise to it.\"\n\nThe ideal solution, of course, would be to tackle the sources of noise themselves. Urban planners could build quiet inner courtyards for residential buildings, use rubberised asphalt ingredients that reduce traffic noise, or erect sound-diffracting walls around highways and noisy areas like highways. Some cities in Belgium and France have already begun implementing such measures, as well as reducing vehicle speed limits, encouraging bike infrastructure and creating quiet zones in parks and along rivers. While noise is a real cause of health problems, \"it's also one which is potentially avoidable\", Stansfeld says.\n\nBut progress is slow, leaving many noise-sensitive people to fend for themselves – for instance by avoiding noisy areas, soundproofing their living spaces or turning to earplugs, earmuffs or noise-cancelling headphones. But these methods often just dampen sounds rather than removing them altogether. \"Even quiet noises might be annoying to a noise-sensitive person,\" Brattico says.\n\n• How traffic noise hurts children's brains\n\n• Why noise pollution is hurting your heart\n\n• The rise of highly sensitive parents\n\nSometimes, treating underlying conditions like anxiety with medications may help, Stansfeld says. Cognitive behavioural therapy, a kind of talking therapy that centres on managing one's psychological reactions and behaviours, can make sense in settings where people are afraid of noise. \"I treated somebody myself with cognitive behaviour therapy, and I think it could be quite helpful,\" Stansfeld says.\n\nMeanwhile, Brattico believes that music therapy with qualified practitioners could also be useful, which involves selecting soothing, soft music that calms people and builds positive associations with sound. For those wanting to try self-soothing, Brattico recommends music with few, soft instruments like piano or harp, such as Renaissance or Baroque chamber music. When even music is annoying, art therapy might help – \"something that's relaxing and allows expressions and regulation of emotions\", Brattico says.\n\nAs for myself, it was earplugs, jazz-playing noise-cancelling headphones and a towel wrapped around my head, that eventually helped somewhat. Until the world around me becomes quieter, I can at least try to find some peace in my own mind.\n\nIf you liked this story, \n\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC,",

    "description": "Health care experts are worried about Grok’s potential to breach patient privacy.",
    "fullText": "In Elon Musk’s world, AI is the new MD. The X owner is encouraging users to upload their medical test results—such as CT and bone scans—to the platform so that Grok, X’s artificial intelligence chatbot, can learn how to interpret them efficiently.\n\nHe’s previously said this information will be used to train X’s artificial intelligence chatbot Grok on how to interpret them efficiently.\n\nEarlier this month, Elon Musk reposted a video on X of himself talking about uploading medical data to Grok, saying: “Try it!”\n\n“You can upload your X-rays or MRI images to Grok and it will give you a medical diagnosis,” Musk said in the video, which was uploaded in June. “I have seen cases where it’s actually better than what doctors tell you.\n\nIn 2024, Musk said medical images uploaded to Grok would be used to train the bot.\n\n“This is still early stage, but it is already quite accurate and will become extremely good,” Musk wrote on X. “Let us know where Grok gets it right or needs work.”\n\nMusk also claimed in his response Grok saved a man in Norway by diagnosing a problem his doctors failed to notice. The X owner was willing to upload his own medical information to his bot.\n\n“I did an MRI recently and submitted it to Grok,” Musk said in an episode of the Moonshots with Peter Diamandis podcast released on Tuesday. “None of the doctors nor Grok found anything.”\n\nMusk did not disclose in the podcast why he received an MRI. XAI, which owns X, told Fortune in a statement: “Legacy Media Lies.”\n\nGrok is facing some competition in the AI health space. This week OpenAI launched ChatGPT Health, an experience within the bot feature that allows users to securely connect medical records and wellness apps like MyFitnessPal and Apple Health. The company said it would not train the models using personal medical information.\n\nAI chatbots have become a ubiquitous source of medical information for people. OpenAI reported this week 40 million people seek health information from the model, 55% of which used to bot to look up or better understand symptoms.\n\nSo far, Grok’s ability to detect medical abnormalities have been mixed. The AI successfully analyzed blood test results and identified breast cancer, some users claimed. But it also grossly misinterpreted other pieces of information, according to physicians who responded to some of Musk’s about Grok’s ability to interpret medical information. In one instance, Grok mistook a “textbook case” of tuberculosis for a herniated disk or spinal stenosis. In another, the bot mistook a mammogram of a benign breast cyst for an image of testicles.\n\nA May 2025 study found that while all AI models have limitations in processing and predicting medical outcomes, Grok was the most effectively compared to Google’s Gemini and ChatGPT-4o when determining the presence of pathologies in 35,711 slices of brain MRI.\n\n“We know they have the technical capability,” Dr. Laura Heacock, associate professor at the New York University Langone Health Department of Radiology, wrote on X. “Whether or not they want to put in the time, data and [graphics processing units] to include medical imaging is up to them. For now, non-generative AI methods continue to outperform in medical imaging.”\n\nMusk’s lofty goal of training his AI to make medical diagnoses is also a risky one, experts said. While AI has increasingly been used as a means to make complicated science more accessible and create assistive technologies, teaching Grok to use data from a social media platform presents concerns about both Grok’s accuracy and user privacy.\n\nRyan Tarzy, CEO of health technology firm Avandra Imaging, said in an interview with Fast Company asking users to directly input data, rather than source it from secure databases with de-identified patient data, is Musk’s way of trying to accelerate Grok’s development. Also, the information comes from a limited sample of whoever is willing to upload their images and tests—meaning the AI is not gathering data from sources representative of the broader and more diverse medical landscape.\n\nMedical information shared on social media isn’t bound by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), the federal law that protects patients’ private information from being shared without their consent. That means there’s less control over where the information goes after a user chooses to share it.\n\n“This approach has myriad risks, including the accidental sharing of patient identities,” Tarzy said. “Personal health information is ‘burned in’ too many images, such as CT scans, and would inevitably be released in this plan.”\n\nThe privacy dangers Grok may present aren’t fully known because X may have privacy protections not known by the public, according to Matthew McCoy, assistant professor of medical ethics and health policy at the University of Pennsylvania. He said users share medical information at their own risk.\n\n“As an individual user, would I feel comfortable contributing health data?” he previously told the New York Times. “Absolutely not.”\n\nA version of this story originally published on Fortune.com on Nov. 20, 2024.\n\nOpenAI launches ChatGPT Health in a push to become a hub for personal health data\n\nOpenAI suggests ChatGPT play doctor as millions of Americans face spiking insurance costs: ‘In the U.S., ChatGPT has become an important ally’\n\nAs Utah gives the AI power to prescribe some drugs, physicians warn of patient risks\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

    "fullText": "BERLIN (AP) — The German government has sharply rejected accusations by U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. claiming that it has been sidelining patient autonomy, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n“The statements made by the US Secretary of Health are completely unfounded, factually incorrect, and must be rejected,” German Health Minister Nina Warken said in a statement late Saturday.\n\nKennedy said in a video post earlier on Saturday that he had sent the German minister a letter based on reports coming out of Germany that the government was “limiting people’s abilities to act on their own convictions when they face medical decisions.”\n\nThe American health secretary said that “I've learned that more than a thousand German physicians and thousands of their patients now face prosecution and punishment for issuing exemptions from wearing masks or getting COVID-19 vaccines during the pandemic.\"\n\nWarken rejected Kennedy’s claims, saying that “during the coronavirus pandemic, there was never any obligation on the medical profession to administer COVID-19 vaccinations. Anyone who did not want to offer vaccinations for medical, ethical, or personal reasons was not liable to prosecution, nor did they have to fear sanctions.”\n\nKennedy did not give provide specific examples or say which reports he was referring to but added that “in my letter, I explained that Germany is targeting physicians who put their patients first and punishing citizens for making their own medical choices.”\n\nHe concluded that \"the German government is now violating the sacred patient physician relationship, replacing it is a dangerous system that makes physicians enforcers of state policies.”\n\nKennedy said that in his letter he made clear that “Germany has the opportunity and the responsibility to correct this trajectory, to restore medical autonomy, to end politically motivated prosecutions.”\n\nWarken pointed out that there were no professional bans or fines for not getting vaccinated.\n\n“Criminal prosecution was only pursued in cases of fraud and document forgery, such as the issuance of false vaccination certificates or fake mask certificates,\" the minister said.\n\nShe also clarified that in general in Germany “patients are also free to decide which therapy they wish to undergo.”\n\nFormer German Health Minister Karl Lauterbach, who was in charge during the pandemic, also replied, addressing Kennedy directly on X saying that he “should take care of health problems in his own country. Short life expectancy, extreme costs, tens of thousands of drug deaths and murder victims.\"\n\n“In Germany, doctors are not punished by the government for issuing false medical certificates. In our country, the courts are independent,” Lauterbach wrote.\n\nWhile a majority of Germans were eager to get vaccinated against the COVID-19 virus during the pandemic, there were also protests by a small minority of vaccine skeptics in Germany which were sometimes supported by far-right movements.",
