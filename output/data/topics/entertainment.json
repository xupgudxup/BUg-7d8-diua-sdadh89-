    "fullText": "PC, Nintendo Switch/Switch 2, PlayStation 4/5, Xbox; Bitmap Bureau/Reef Entertainment\nArcade specialists Bitmap Bureau ply their craft in this retro remake of James Cameron’s action film. But Terminator 2D is at its strongest when colouring outside the director’s lines\n\nLike Arnie’s pulverised cyborg at the end of T2, the Terminator franchise has lumbered on long past the point of being properly functional. Every film since Judgment Day has been a disappointment or an outright disaster, and its video game spinoffs haven’t fared much better. While some half-decent ones have emerged, such as 2019’s Terminator: Resistance, there hasn’t been a great Terminator game in about 30 years.\n\nSo it makes perfect sense for Terminator 2D: No Fate to attempt to fix our broken future by travelling back to the past. Developer Bitmap Bureau appeals to the series’ heyday by retelling the story of Judgment Day through a medley of retro 80s and 90s playstyles. The result is a charming and frequently thrilling action throwback, though ironically it is at its strongest when it strays furthest from James Cameron’s film.\n\nTerminator 2D begins several years before the events of the film, charting Sarah Connor’s doomed attempt to sabotage Cyberdyne systems before her incarceration at Pescadero Hospital. These early levels, which see Sarah running and gunning her way through a gang of outlaws, police, and hazmat-wearing researchers, are among the game’s best. Bitmap Bureau does a remarkable job capturing Linda Hamilton’s gritty performance in a handful of pixels, while the scenarios eke impressive variety from simple arcade fundamentals.\n\nThe momentum carries on into the future, where you spend a couple of levels fighting the armies of Skynet as adult John Connor in nuclear-blasted LA. Terminator 2D ramps up the spectacle here, with laser weapons and incendiary grenades deployed against Chrome-plated T-800s and several enormous mini-bosses. The section culminates in a thrilling boss fight against a flying Hunter-Killer drone, at which Bitmap Bureau throws all the fireworks its 16-bit aesthetic allows.\n\nNo Fate loses some of its thrust once it catches up with Judgment Day. The midsection replicates key scenes from the film in playable form, such as the chase sequences that bookend the story. But these feel overly constrained by the game’s self-imposed limitations and aren’t very exciting to play. Better served are Arnie’s bar-fight scene and Sarah Connor’s escape from Pescadero, which employ beat ’em up principles and stealth respectively. While stylish and capably designed, these ideas deserve more room to breathe.\n\nT2D regains its earlier verve in its concluding levels, though the story reaches its denouement quicker than the actual film. Fortunately, as is always the case in Terminator, the end is not really the end. Like its arcade forebears, No Fate places heavy emphasis on replay value. Not only do its harder modes challenge you with adjusted enemy placements, completing the story mode unlocks new pathways that explore alternate futures hinging on Sarah’s choices.\n\nWhile No Fate doesn’t move the needle for Terminator games as much as I’d like, it succeeds in resetting the clock for the series’ interactive arm. It’s a pointed reminder that Terminator has gaming greatness within it.\n\nTerminator 2D: No Fate is out now; £24.99",

    "fullText": "Game developer, who was also involved in Medal of Honor and Titanfall, was killed in a car crash\n\nVince Zampella, the co-creator of the Call of Duty video game series, has died aged 55.\n\nThe head of the video game developer Respawn Entertainment and the co-founder of Infinity Ward was killed in a car crash in California, NBC Los Angeles reported.\n\nZampella led the creation of the bestselling video game series Call of Duty at Infinity Ward, and at his various studios he was involved in several highly successful game series from Medal of Honor to Titanfall.\n\nHe is reported to have died in a single-car accident on the Angeles Crest Highway, which was reported to the California highway patrol at 12.45pm on Sunday. The vehicle’s driver died at the scene, and a passenger died later in hospital.\n\nZampella began his career in video games in the mid-1990s. Most recently, he had been promoted to head of the Battlefield military shooter series of video games at EA Games – Battlefield 6 was released in October to critical acclaim.\n\nPreviously, in 2010, he founded Respawn Entertainment under EA, which created the Titanfall series of mech shooters and the popular multiplayer game Apex Legends.\n\nZampella is best known for his time in the 2000s at Infinity Ward, a studio he co-founded with Grant Collier and Jason West in 2002. There, he co-created the Call of Duty video game series and some of its most acclaimed entries, including Modern Warfare (2007) and Modern Warfare 2 (2009).\n\nThe Call of Duty games have gone on to sell more than 500m copies. In 2010, he was involved with other former Infinity Ward staff in a lawsuit against the series’ publisher, Activision, over unpaid royalties.\n\nIn a statement on Monday night, EA said: “This is an unimaginable loss, and our hearts are with Vince’s family, his loved ones, and all those touched by his work.\n\n“Vince’s influence on the video game industry was profound and far-reaching. A friend, colleague, leader and visionary creator, his work helped shape modern interactive entertainment and inspired millions of players and developers around the world. His legacy will continue to shape how games are made and how players connect for generations to come.”",

There was also the relative newcomer Dan Da Dan, which saw its second theatrical adaptation with Evil Eye.\n\nThe rankings also show a shift away from single launch moments toward steady output. According to Fandom's study, Roblox's top placement reflects how fans now prefer platforms with constant updates and community-created content. Smaller Roblox games, such as Dandy’s World and Grow a Garden, ranked higher than well-established worlds like Minecraft and Disney by focusing on frequent events and active, niche communities.\n\nThe same pattern appeared elsewhere with franchises such as Dungeons and Dragons and Cookie Run Kingdom performed well by releasing content regularly, showing that consistency mattered more than occasional peaks in attention.",
