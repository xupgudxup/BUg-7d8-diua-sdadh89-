    "description": "In this Saturday edition of Business Insider Today, our entertainment team discusses who they think will take home a golden statuette.",
    "fullText": "After covering the Grammy Awards for nearly two decades, there are a few moments I know will happen on music's biggest night: Someone will go home happy, and someone will go home sad.\n\nEither way, we'll get Trevor Noah as the host for his sixth and final time, performances you'll text about, and candid moments between our favorite singers seated inside LA's Crypto.com Arena on Sunday. It'll all air on CBS.\n\nKendrick Lamar leads with nine nominations, including in the major categories such as Record, Album, and Song of the Year, followed by Lady Gaga and producers Cirkut and Jack Antonoff with seven. We'll also be watching Super Bowl performer Bad Bunny, Sabrina Carpenter, and my personal favorite, Leon Thomas, to see if they go home with trophies after nabbing six nods.\n\nI asked Business Insider's entertainment team who they thought would go home with a small, 24K gold-plated gramophone. Here's what they're betting on:\n\nJason Guerrasio, Entertainment correspondent: Tucked away in the midst of the 90-plus Grammy categories is Best Album Cover. I hope it goes to Perfume Genius' \"Glory\" cover. Google it. It's instantly eye-catching.\n\nSamantha Rollins, deputy editor of Entertainment: When \"Mayhem\" single \"Abracadabra\" debuted during a commercial break at last year's Grammys, many posited that Lady Gaga's newest album would take a back-to-basics approach to the edgy electropop that made her famous. What emerged instead was far more interesting. Lady Gaga's \"Mayhem\" is an invigorating return to form that proves one of pop's most famous shape-shifters can still keep us guessing. She'll take it for Album of the Year.\n\nCallie Ahlgrim, senior pop culture writer: Record of the Year is supposed to honor the most superb blend of production and performance, but since it tends to favor ubiquity, I have to give the edge to the global pop smash \"APT.\" Bruno Mars has the cross-generational appeal that Grammy voters can't resist, and Rosé would make history as the first K-pop star to win in a competitive category.",

    "fullText": "The American television drama Heated Rivalry - about two male professional ice hockey players in a secret relationship - has become the first viral show of 2026.\n\nFor most viewers, it is entertainment to be talked about at work or online. For Jesse Kortuem, it hit deeper.\n\nBorn, raised and still living in Minneapolis, he grew up with skates on his feet and loved ice hockey - but stepped away from the sport at 17 as he felt he would not be accepted because of his sexuality.\n\nMore than two decades later, watching Heated Rivalry inspired Kortuem to come out as gay, believing it shows attitudes within the sport have shifted for the better.\n\nHis Instagram post has since gone viral, leading to a \"very surreal\" start to the year.\n\n\"I'm just so grateful for where my life has ended up,\" he tells BBC Sport. \"To finally have that relief... to bring 110% of myself into the locker room. Something was speaking to me through the show - I had to let something out.\n\n\"Then that release was shared with the entire world. For the first couple of days, it was shocking, but now it is humbling - people have reached out to say it inspired them to have the conversation with their parents. I'm honestly speechless.\"\n\nKortuem played ice hockey in local leagues in Minneapolis during his teenage years, and occasionally dipped back into the amateur game as an adult.\n\nIt was not until he joined Cutting Edges, an LGBT-inclusive team who play across North America, in 2017 that he re-engaged with the sport - and it was only this year that he felt comfortable to be open about his sexuality with the wider hockey community.\n\nNow 40, Kortuem says he had to \"edit\" himself in hockey - and life - to fit in.\n\nBut seeing the show, in which two athletes enter a loving relationship, stirred repressed feelings.\n\n\"I had to hide, and looking back now it was tough,\" he says. \"It was still a place of comfort, but a place I had to edit myself.\n\n\"It was time to put a real face to what this story has done for athletes, to get it out there. And it took off!\"",

    "fullText": "As kids, there was always that one place we begged our parents to take us to, or got excited about visiting for a birthday party or a school field trip.\n\nAfter all, kids' fixations are simple: Give them pizza and entertainment, and they'll happily stay occupied for hours. When a business offers both, it often becomes a welcome break for parents as well.\n\nEveryone has their own version of that place, whether it's Chuck E. Cheese, Dave & Buster's, or Main Event. Over the years, these spots have become go-to destinations for families across the country. In Texas, however, one chain has long stood apart as a source of Lone Star pride.\n\nMr Gatti's Pizza began in 1964 as a small restaurant called \"The Pizza Place\" in Stephenville, Texas. Five years later, it relocated to Austin and was renamed Mr Gatti's, in honor of the founder's wife's maiden name.\n\nDuring the 1970s, the Mr Gatti's brand expanded into a chain and introduced buffet-style dining, an innovation that helped distinguish it from competitors.\n\nAlthough the Austin restaurant predated the first Chuck E. Cheese location (which opened in San Jose, California, in 1977), Mr Gatti's didn't really jump onto the entertainment-plus-pizza trend until the 1980s. The concept quickly won over families, and today Mr Gatti's Pizza operates more than 200 locations across Texas and the southeastern U.S.\n\nIndustry experts say this hybrid model has become increasingly valuable as traditional casual dining struggles to compete for consumers. According to a 2025 McKinsey & Company survey, 45% of surveyed consumers have reduced their spending at pizza restaurants.\n\n\"When there's good entertainment and good experiences, check averages go up,\" Downtown Restaurant Investments President and BYOD CEO Dave Dittenber told Restaurant Dive.\n\nDittenber added that entertainment only works when paired with strong service and quality food.\n\nMr Gatti's Pizza has sold a majority stake in its business to OneRyan Global LLC, the family office of businessman and philanthropist G. Brint Ryan, according to a press release. The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.\n\nOneRyan has been a franchisee of Mr Gatti's Pizza since 2022, but its involvement with the brand has steadily expanded.\n\nIn September 2025, OneRyan acquired a minority stake in the company and, a month later, purchased a corporate-owned restaurant at South Park Meadows in Austin. That transaction completed Mr Gatti's Pizza's transition to a fully franchised system and concluded the re-franchising of all company-owned locations.",

In this video, Jacobs can be seen walking on the beach with their hands joined together. However, this video went viral, which sparked rumors that Jacobs is in a relationship.\n\nAsh Kaash and Packers RB Josh Jacobs are reportedly dating\n pic.twitter.com/oymQmQm2F8\n\n— FearBuck (@FearedBuck) January 22, 2026\n\nNeither Jacobs nor Kash has made any public comments regarding their relationship.\n\nMost people who shared their opinions on social media had negative views about the video.\n\nOne such comment read, “I don’t get some athletes, maybe that’s why they are so good. Bittersweet life.” Another comment was, “There are grad schools all over America full of good women aged 24-42. These athletes are overreacting.”\n\nSome also asked how well they knew each other. For instance, someone commented, “NBA and NFL players love to date the same people.” There was also a joke about Jacobs’ performance. The joke was, “So this is why he’s been playing poorly. She drained his powers.”\n\nAnother comment referenced the dating lives of athletes in general. “Athletes are the easiest targets,” a woman wrote. A man commented that he would find a suitable, humble person with the amount of money he would have, and made fun of Kash.\n\nJacobs has been to two Pro Bowls and has been one of the best running backs in the NFL over the past few years. Jacobs currently plays for the Green Bay Packers, signing in 2024 after six years in Las Vegas. Ash Kash, also known as Ashaley, is a popular Instagram and TikTok personality.\n\nThe alleged couple has not commented on the rumors.\n\nThe post Josh Jacobs Sparks Dating Rumors With Ash Kash After Posting Beach Video Holding Hands appeared first on Where Is The Buzz | Breaking News, Entertainment, Exclusive Interviews & More.",

    "description": "Guggenheim Brothers Media and Abu Dhabi's EIH formed a fund for media, entertainment, and creator economy investments.",
    "fullText": "A new $50 million fund is targeting media, entertainment, and creator economy startups, tapping into Hollywood networks and the UAE's growing appetite for cultural investment.\n\nUS investment firm Guggenheim Brothers Media is launching the fund with backing from Abu Dhabi-based Ethmar International Holding.\n\nThe firm is led by Dillon Lawson-Johnston and Criswell Fiordalis, who are looking to write checks of $2 million to $5 million, targeting 10 to 15 companies. They plan to seek other investors as well and hope to grow the fund to as much as $75 million.\n\nThe pair brings extensive entertainment and cultural ties. Lawson-Johnston is the great-great-grandson of Solomon R. Guggenheim, founder of New York City's famed Guggenheim Museum, and has experience from UTA, Sugar23, Untitled Entertainment, and Anonymous Content. Fiordalis has had roles at Lionsgate, MRC, Hello Sunshine, and Webtoon. The two had previously invested in Stapleview, a comedy platform, and The Lighthouse, Whalar Group's campus for creators.\n\nEIH is an investment holding company that's led by a prominent member of a UAE ruling family. The UAE, like other Gulf nations, has been pouring money into US media and entertainment as it tries to diversify away from oil. One UAE government project, Creators HQ, aims to get 10,000 creators to relocate to the country. Lawson-Johnston's family is set to open the Guggenheim Abu Dhabi in 2026.\n\n\"We're investing in creativity and culture, and we're looking to leverage this amazing museum that's being built,\" Lawson-Johnston said.\n\nHe and Fiordalis want to deploy the fund mainly in the US, where the creator economy is more mature. The Interactive Advertising Bureau estimated that advertisers would spend $37 billion with creators in 2025, a sum that it says is growing four times faster than overall media spending.\n\nHere are four trends the new fund is betting on:\n\nInvestors tend to shy away from backing individual creators because of the risk of overdependence on a single person, also called \"key man risk.\" That's why some big names like Steven Bartlett and Alex Cooper are building networks of complementary creators (and attracting millions of dollars in the process).\n\nFiordalis and Lawson-Johnston are interested in creators who are looking beyond themselves when building talent-related businesses.\n\nThey'll also look at companies that develop creators through talent management or other services. One example is their earlier investment in Stapleview, which manages social media-born comedians and produces with them.\n\nTraditional media companies have a lot of intellectual property that they want to give new life to in digital media. It's why Disney did a deal that'll open its vault of famous characters to OpenAI.\n\nFiordalis and Lawson-Johnston, both of whom have spent time at legacy media companies, envision a mutually beneficial way for creators and Hollywood to collaborate in this area and aim to facilitate this process.\n\n\"If you're SpongeBob SquarePants, what do you do other than taking SpongeBob and slapping it on YouTube and saying, 'Oh, we now have a digital presence?'\" Lawson-Johnston said.\n\nBrands are clamoring to get their message out using creators, leveraging influencers' built-in distribution and popularity among younger consumers. The IAB found in November that brands were most eager to work with mid-tier creators — those with between 50,000 and 500,000 followers — because of their ability to drive sales and awareness.\n\nFiordalis and Lawson-Johnston see an opportunity to back platforms that connect such influencers with brands using a mix of people and technology. They pointed to the platform Kyra, which raised $15 million in 2022, as one they admire.\n\n\"There's a lot of, not top creators, but downstream creators that have way more engagement and can drive a lot more value to said brand,\" Fiordalis said.\n\nAs more brands shift their budgets to creators, they face increasing pressure to prove that their spending has paid off. Brands have gone from just caring about a creator's follower count to looking at other ways to prove efficacy.\n\nFiordalis and Lawson-Johnston are interested in companies trying to standardize how creators are measured.\n\n\"Who's standardizing the definition of value across these platforms and across pieces of content?\" Fiordalis said. \"I think the industry is getting to a point where it needs that.\"",

Former Far Cry lead Dan Hay is said to be leading the project.

    "fullText": "on January 6, 2026 at 9:27PM PST\n\nGameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n\nPlenty of games have come out in the years since Unknown Worlds Entertainment released Subnautica that aim to offer a similar experience to the survival title. However, only a handful of games are truly like Subnautica enough where you get some of the same feelings while playing them as you did while roaming the open ocean of Planet 4546B for the first time. While few games can totally replicate the complete experience of Subnautica, some are great alternatives that expand upon the gameplay elements or mechanics present in the underwater adventure.\n\nToday, we'll be listing 16 games to play if you're a fan of Subnautica and looking for something else to scratch that survival/horror itch. Of course, there are other elements to Subnautica, including a robust crafting system, vast exploration, and a unique setting, and some of the entries on the list will prominently feature those aspects instead of simply being another survival game with horror elements.\n\nNaturally, we have to kick off this list with the successor to the original Subnautica. Subnautica: Below Zero is a direct sequel to the first game and takes place on the same planet, but in a completely different area. You also play as a new protagonist, a scientist who has come to the planet along with dozens of others to study its fascinating flora and fauna. Below Zero offers more of a story than the original, but your overall goal is still to explore every inch of the ocean and surface. While you'll see some familiar creatures, plants, and craftable structures, Below Zero offers new leviathans and other deadly creatures as well as brand new objects to craft at your base.\n\nOne of the biggest changes in Below Zero is more of an emphasis on land travel, and there's even a new vehicle you can craft to traverse the icy landscapes that are above the ocean. If you loved the original Subnautica, you'll love Below Zero, but we must warn you, the horror elements have been cranked up slightly in the sequel.\n\nFanatical and GameSpot are both owned by Fandom.\n\nThe Planet Crafter doesn't feature too many water elements like Subnautica, and it doesn't have many formidable creatures to avoid. However, it does allow you to completely terraform an entire planet from the ground up, giving you the chance to dictate every part of how the planet is designed. At the start of the game, your goal is to simply survive the harsh conditions of the planet and build a small base to start the terraforming process. Over time, though, you can begin to tone down the weather conditions and form the planet in whatever image you want. You're able to go through different stages of terraforming, which include creating sustainable resources, to even terraforming insects, plants, and animals. The world is your oyster in The Planet Crafter, and while there are survival elements present, your main job is to transform your planet into a livable environment. It's great for any Subnautica player who enjoyed the base building or perhaps wanted to change certain parts about how the ocean is laid out.\n\nWe've talked about games that take place in the water and on the surfaces of a planet, so how about we combine those settings? No Man's Sky is a game that allows you to explore an entire universe. It gives you a spaceship, some tools to gather resources, and then tells you to head out and explore a nearly infinite, procedurally-generated universe. The universe has more planets than you could ever hope to explore, and though the planets aren't all that different from one another, it's what you can accomplish on the planets that matters.\n\nRecent updates in No Man's Sky give you the chance to create an entire space station on a planet, head underwater into the depths of oceans, and even mine for prehistoric fossils that you can use to further expand your journey. When you're not spending time on a planet, you can meet other players in a central hub and customize your spaceship. It's a fantastic experience that truly never ends if you don't want it to.\n\nRaft is a natural choice for players who are hoping to find a similar experience to Subnautica. Raft is another survival game where you, or you and some friends, are stuck on a small raft in the middle of a vast ocean. Your goal is to survive and expand your raft so you can avoid the perils of the ocean and everything that calls it home, including great white sharks. Over time, you'll eventually scavenge resources to be able to build a large, wooden houseboat that houses different crafting stations to aid your survival. Eventually, you'll even be able to reach different land masses and explore those as well.\n\nWhile Raft places more of an emphasis on staying out of the water than exploring it, you still need to head underwater to secure the resources you need to build more structures on your raft. Sharks and other creatures are lurking nearby, but you're used to that feeling if you've played any Subnautica.\n\nGrounded 2 is the sequel to the hit survival game of the same name, both of which are developed by Obsidian Entertainment, the studio behind The Outer Worlds and Fallout: New Vegas. The sequel to Grounded takes much of the same gameplay design from the original, as you still play as characters that have been shrunken down to the size of a grain of sand. However, Grounded 2 features an entirely new map, fresh content to unlock, and a much more rewarding gameplay loop. You'll fight bosses, explore for new research that can be turned into gear, and build a staggering base to keep out all of those pesky insects.\n\nWe don't have to spend a lot of time on this entry. Minecraft is the game that paved the way for most modern survival games, crafting a blueprint for the genre that has been followed and altered since 2009. While there aren't too many horror elements of Minecraft that might attract leviathan-loving Subnautica fans, everything else is a survival player's dream. You have a randomly generated map that goes on far beyond what you're able to explore, hundreds of crafting resources, and the ability to build whatever kind of base your mind can dream up. If you want a different kind of Minecraft experience, you can also access thousands of mods or custom servers that completely change the gameplay.\n\nAstroneer is another survival game that allows you to terraform planets, but on a much larger scale. Instead of getting a single planet to manage, you can bounce between five different planets, changing each one the way you see fit. Each planet houses various resources for you to gather that unlock new crafting recipes that you can use to upgrade your base or increase the production of other resources. In addition to base building and terraforming, Astroneer also offers expansive exploration, with planets housing several different environments and secret locations to discover.\n\nPerhaps the most noticeable aspect of Astroneer, though, is its graphics; the visuals are extremely vibrant and feature a distinct art style that looks like everything on your screen was hand-painted. Astroneer is an experience similar to Subnautica in some ways, but it offers much \n\nStranded Deep offers an extremely similar premise to Subnautica. It starts off with you being the survivor of a plane crash and stranded in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. You need to find a way to survive the ocean's elements and creatures before eventually finding land, which comes with its own challenges. Luckily, Stranded Deep offers a skills system that allows you to upgrade your character in various ways as you progress. This gives you the chance to unlock fresh crafting recipes to use on your base or even different vehicles that allow you to explore more areas of the map, which is procedurally generated.\n\nIn addition to the basic survival and base-building gameplay loops, Stranded Deep also offers a robust combat system. You can eventually challenge three different bosses to earn uber-important rewards. There are also a slew of other creatures you can hunt for food or sport. Stranded Deep offers perhaps the closest experience to Subnautica on this list, but it does offer \n\nForever Skies is a recent game that takes clear inspiration from the Subnautica series, but does add several of its own twists. The game is set on a post-apocalyptic Earth that has been ravaged ecologically, leaving you with very little in terms of resources to gather. Fortunately, you're able to construct a massive airship that can travel across the map so you can find new areas to explore. Your airship acts as your main base, and you can place different crafting stations and structures on board that help you survive. When you're not flying high above the clouds, you can also head underneath the various bodies of water on the map, which house important resources, but massive leviathans as well. There are also large enemies on land as well, but Forever Skies equips you with some weapons to fight off these foes. It's an interesting spin on the Subnautica style of survival games, and it's worth checking out for the airship aspect alone.\n\nIf you particularly enjoy the horror elements of Subnautica, then Sons of the Forest might be the perfect game to follow it up. However, Sons of the Forest cranks the survival and horror aspects to another level. The game begins with you and a companion named Kelvin crash-landing on a seemingly deserted island. You, along with your now deaf companion Kelvin, need to find a way to stay alive and figure out exactly where you are. As you explore the island in Sons of the Forest, you'll quickly learn you're not alone. There are monsters everywhere you turn, and the only way to survive is by venturing into dark caverns and other locations to find the tools and gear you need.\n\nJump-scares are a common sight in Sons of the Forest, but when you're not exploring the dangerous caverns of the island, you can construct a decent-sized base and craft a number of other objects. This includes weapons and even vehicles, making exploration much easier and safer. Sons of the Forest is able to match the sheer terror of Subnautica while also maintaining the same sense of exploration and harsh survival scenarios.\n\nOuter Wilds has perhaps the most compelling premise and gameplay loop out of any game on this list. It's another space exploration survival game, but instead of maintaining a persistent base and inventory of resources, you have a completely different goal than to simply survive. Instead, Outer Wilds forces you to explore several unique planets, all of which house secrets and dangerous environments. The game's twist is that you're caught in a time loop, which only gives you a set amount of time to explore before you're sent back to your original starting point. When you start over, you have to go out and explore everything again. However, every time you venture out on a new journey, you're armed with the knowledge you gained from the previous explorations. It's a totally different experience from Subnautica, but one that still matches the same sense of wonder you get from exploring Planet 4546B's ocean.\n\nValheim is widely regarded as one of the best modern survival games. Like Subnautica, Valheim has inspired a number of recent survival titles. While Valheim and Subnautica mainly share a survival aspect, both games offer extremely difficult elements that need to be constantly managed in order to stay alive. In Valheim, you play as a banished Viking who needs to prove their worth to escape banishment. Your primary task is to defeat five bosses, who are located in five different zones across the map. In order to progress to each boss, you need to fully explore every subsequent zone, unlocking the specific crafting resources each one offers. With those crafting resources, you have to make tools and weapons to defeat the zone's boss.\n\nValheim offers a randomly-generated map, architecturally-sound base building, and excellent combat that makes you think about every move you make. You can also cross oceans and encounter some large enemies along the way if you're really craving some Subnautica-like gameplay.\n\nGreen Hell is a survival game that was likely inspired by the original The Forest. However, there are Subnautica elements present that will appeal to fans. Green Hell is set in the Amazon rainforest and tasks you with simply surviving the harsh elements of South America. The game features some of the most difficult survival elements in any game on this list, as you have to contend with constant weather conditions, lethal inhabitants, and various animals that all want you dead. Fortunately, Green Hell offers expansive base-building and crafting systems, giving you the ability to construct a fortress in the jungle complete with defenses and stations to make new objects.\n\nWhile Green Hell takes place on land, its map is just as dangerous as Subnautica's ocean. You have to carefully wade into every new zone in the Amazon, or else you risk dying to a new threat.\n\nArk: Survival Evolved is one of the longer-running survival games, and it has built up quite a massive player base since its release in 2015. Ark takes place on land and in the water, where you have to contend with prehistoric dinosaurs at every turn. Most of the dinos you encounter can be tamed, but you'll be running from them or fighting them the majority of the time. When you're not taming or fighting a prehistoric creature, you spend your time exploring a huge map that houses dozens of points of interest and places to build a base. You need to scavenge for resources to unlock an arsenal of weapons that can be used to fight against dinosaurs or other players if you join a PvP server.\n\nThe bases that are possible to build in Ark, along with the amount of flora and fauna you can encounter, are truly staggering. It's one of the largest-scale survival games on the market, and can easily match the thrills of Subnautica, especially if you're a fan of the leviathans.\n\nThe Long Dark is another decade-old survival game that features some of the most realistic survival elements out of any game in the genre. It's a truly solo experience that places a massive emphasis on strategizing exactly how to survive in the Canadian wilderness. You won't encounter too many enemies to fight or people to talk to; all you have is your mind and abilities. The Long Dark forces you to carefully manage hunger, thirst, stamina, and warmth while trying to scavenge for the resources to keep yourself healthy. You're able to stumble across tools and gear that make survival easier, but you'll never truly be safe from Mother Nature.\n\nYou won't take part in any base building in The Long Dark, but you will find a true sense of exploration and the terror of failing to survive. The Long Dark features permadeath in the survival mode, meaning if you die, you're dead for good.\n\nYou can think of Breathedge as like Subnautica, but in space. Breathedge places you, a character simply known as \"The Man,\" in the center of a galaxy after your spaceship breaks down while on the way to a funeral. Don't fret, though, as you have an immortal chicken by your side and plenty of items to scavenge from the various space stations in your vicinity. You'll be able to find and drive vehicles, craft new gear, and uncover some hidden truths about the galaxy around you. While Breathedge doesn't feature the heart-pounding exploration that Subnautica does, it's still a game that's begging to be explored and offers hours of seamless gameplay.",

    "fullText": "The demolition of Hawai’i’s Aloha Stadium is finally underway after several delays.\n\nOnce home to the NFL Pro Bowl, college football’s Hawaiʻi Bowl and University of Hawaiʻi football, Aloha Stadium is transitioning into a new scaled-down stadium with an accompanying entertainment district.\n\nAs part of the New Aloha Stadium Entertainment District (NASED) project, the new stadium is set for a projected grand opening in March 2029, and is expected to have a seating capacity of 22,500, less than half of the previous 50,000 seats it held.\n\n“The demolition/dismantling of Aloha Stadium has begun,” Aloha Stadium Authority chairman Eric Fujimoto said at the NASED monthly meeting on Dec. 18. The removal of furnishings and the subsequent dismantling of the facility are expected to take approximately 10 months.\n\nThe beginning of the demolition process marks a major milestone for a plan that has been repeatedly delayed. The reopening of the stadium was initially scheduled to be on time for the Rainbow Warriors’ football season in 2028, but was pushed back to 2029 in August of this year.\n\nBefore its final closing after years of maintenance issues, Aloha Stadium was an innovative steel-constructed venue with movable seating sections for different sports and events.\n\nHowever, the stadium, also known as the Metal Mecca, met its downfall because of that very design structure.\n\nThe steel structure was not a good match for Hawai’i’s humid climate, which led to severe, damaging rust that required frequent repairs.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the stadium with a costly history was put to rest.\n\nWith the demolition now in full swing, attention turns to the broader vision of the NASED project. The construction of the new, smaller stadium and the surrounding entertainment district is expected to cost the state $350 million.\n\nThe new Aloha Stadium’s entertainment district is expected to include 4,000 to 4,500 housing units, multiple hotels, retail and dining spaces and cultural attractions. Residential construction is projected to take place shortly after the opening of the newly renovated Aloha Stadium, as early as 2029 or 2030.\n\nDiego Rivera - The Sporting Tribune\n\nThe University of Hawai'i Rainbow Warriors celebrate linebacker Jalen Smith's (3) fumble recovery during an NCAA football game against the Utah State Aggies, Saturday, October 11, 2025.\n\nAfter playing its home games at the Clarence T.C. Ching Athletics Complex since the closing of Aloha Stadium, University of Hawai’i football is set to move back into the new facility in 2029 under a license agreement negotiated with Hawai’i Athletics Director Matt Elliott.\n\n“While there is still much work ahead, the progress being made gives all of us reason to be optimistic,” Elliott said in a September press release. “We are excited to see momentum building and remain committed to doing our part to bring this long-awaited vision to life.”\n\nAs demolition progresses and construction plans take shape, the NASED project ushers in a new era for Hawai’i sports.",

    "fullText": "PC, Nintendo Switch/Switch 2, PlayStation 4/5, Xbox; Bitmap Bureau/Reef Entertainment\nArcade specialists Bitmap Bureau ply their craft in this retro remake of James Cameron’s action film. But Terminator 2D is at its strongest when colouring outside the director’s lines\n\nLike Arnie’s pulverised cyborg at the end of T2, the Terminator franchise has lumbered on long past the point of being properly functional. Every film since Judgment Day has been a disappointment or an outright disaster, and its video game spinoffs haven’t fared much better. While some half-decent ones have emerged, such as 2019’s Terminator: Resistance, there hasn’t been a great Terminator game in about 30 years.\n\nSo it makes perfect sense for Terminator 2D: No Fate to attempt to fix our broken future by travelling back to the past. Developer Bitmap Bureau appeals to the series’ heyday by retelling the story of Judgment Day through a medley of retro 80s and 90s playstyles. The result is a charming and frequently thrilling action throwback, though ironically it is at its strongest when it strays furthest from James Cameron’s film.\n\nTerminator 2D begins several years before the events of the film, charting Sarah Connor’s doomed attempt to sabotage Cyberdyne systems before her incarceration at Pescadero Hospital. These early levels, which see Sarah running and gunning her way through a gang of outlaws, police, and hazmat-wearing researchers, are among the game’s best. Bitmap Bureau does a remarkable job capturing Linda Hamilton’s gritty performance in a handful of pixels, while the scenarios eke impressive variety from simple arcade fundamentals.\n\nThe momentum carries on into the future, where you spend a couple of levels fighting the armies of Skynet as adult John Connor in nuclear-blasted LA. Terminator 2D ramps up the spectacle here, with laser weapons and incendiary grenades deployed against Chrome-plated T-800s and several enormous mini-bosses. The section culminates in a thrilling boss fight against a flying Hunter-Killer drone, at which Bitmap Bureau throws all the fireworks its 16-bit aesthetic allows.\n\nNo Fate loses some of its thrust once it catches up with Judgment Day. The midsection replicates key scenes from the film in playable form, such as the chase sequences that bookend the story. But these feel overly constrained by the game’s self-imposed limitations and aren’t very exciting to play. Better served are Arnie’s bar-fight scene and Sarah Connor’s escape from Pescadero, which employ beat ’em up principles and stealth respectively. While stylish and capably designed, these ideas deserve more room to breathe.\n\nT2D regains its earlier verve in its concluding levels, though the story reaches its denouement quicker than the actual film. Fortunately, as is always the case in Terminator, the end is not really the end. Like its arcade forebears, No Fate places heavy emphasis on replay value. Not only do its harder modes challenge you with adjusted enemy placements, completing the story mode unlocks new pathways that explore alternate futures hinging on Sarah’s choices.\n\nWhile No Fate doesn’t move the needle for Terminator games as much as I’d like, it succeeds in resetting the clock for the series’ interactive arm. It’s a pointed reminder that Terminator has gaming greatness within it.\n\nTerminator 2D: No Fate is out now; £24.99",

The vehicle’s driver died at the scene, and a passenger died later in hospital.\n\nZampella began his career in video games in the mid-1990s. Most recently, he had been promoted to head of the Battlefield military shooter series of video games at EA Games – Battlefield 6 was released in October to critical acclaim.\n\nPreviously, in 2010, he founded Respawn Entertainment under EA, which created the Titanfall series of mech shooters and the popular multiplayer game Apex Legends.\n\nZampella is best known for his time in the 2000s at Infinity Ward, a studio he co-founded with Grant Collier and Jason West in 2002. There, he co-created the Call of Duty video game series and some of its most acclaimed entries, including Modern Warfare (2007) and Modern Warfare 2 (2009).\n\nThe Call of Duty games have gone on to sell more than 500m copies. In 2010, he was involved with other former Infinity Ward staff in a lawsuit against the series’ publisher, Activision, over unpaid royalties.\n\nIn a statement on Monday night, EA said: “This is an unimaginable loss, and our hearts are with Vince’s family, his loved ones, and all those touched by his work.\n\n“Vince’s influence on the video game industry was profound and far-reaching. A friend, colleague, leader and visionary creator, his work helped shape modern interactive entertainment and inspired millions of players and developers around the world. His legacy will continue to shape how games are made and how players connect for generations to come.”",

There was also the relative newcomer Dan Da Dan, which saw its second theatrical adaptation with Evil Eye.\n\nThe rankings also show a shift away from single launch moments toward steady output. According to Fandom's study, Roblox's top placement reflects how fans now prefer platforms with constant updates and community-created content. Smaller Roblox games, such as Dandy’s World and Grow a Garden, ranked higher than well-established worlds like Minecraft and Disney by focusing on frequent events and active, niche communities.\n\nThe same pattern appeared elsewhere with franchises such as Dungeons and Dragons and Cookie Run Kingdom performed well by releasing content regularly, showing that consistency mattered more than occasional peaks in attention.",
