    "description": "A/B testing, once heralded as the gold standard for data-driven decision-making, often slows companies down due to an overemphasis on statistical significance. Traditional approaches require waiting for weeks, leading to missed opportunities, and delayed growth. This caution, while appropriate for fields like drug development, is misaligned with business needs, where the real cost is often the opportunity lost rather than the risk of a small mistake. A new framework prioritizes minimizing worst-case expected loss in business terms such as dollars or conversions, rather than abstract probabilities. It enables faster, more strategic decisions by recommending action whenever the estimated impact is positive and the deployment cost is justified.",
