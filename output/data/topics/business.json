    "fullText": "A Trump administration official credited the president with making small business owners “excited” to pay their taxes thanks to tax cuts and less regulation.\n\nKelly Loeffler, administrator of the Small Business Administration, told Fox News’s Sunday Morning Futures that “small business optimism is above its 52-year average.”\n\nLoeffler said a lot of the optimism is due to the Working Families Tax Cut in Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill.”\n\n“Small businesses finally have certainty about what their tax rate’s going to be,” Loeffler said. “That 20% pass-through deduction, now the 179 expensing that means higher limits on the ability to expense immediately for purchases they make in capital equipment, and also R&D expensing.”\n\nThose factors, according to Loeffler, actually have small business owners jazzed about writing a check to Uncle Sam.\n\n“I don’t think small business owners have ever been so excited to pay their taxes thanks to President Trump!” Loeffler said. “He brought us the blue collar boom in his first term, and now he’s going to add to that the small business boom.”\n\nHost Cheryl Casone, in for Maria Bartiromo, asked Loeffler about “those onerous federal regulations under the Biden administration,” and whether removing them “could be another way to boost the health of small business.”\n\n“Absolutely. Regulation is a tax on a small business, and under President Trump in his first year, about $200 billion in regulations have been cut,” Loeffler said.\n\nThe SBA’s goal for 2026 is “to make sure that small businesses are able to have relief after four very active years of regulating under Joe Biden that heaped trillions of dollars on the backs of small businesses,” Loeffler said. “So, we’re leading a strike force at the SBA to roll back even more regulations.”\n\nLoeffler has been criticized for aggressively cutting staff at the SBA, and for rolling back Biden administration changes “aimed at easing access to credit for the smallest enterprises,” The New York Times reported.\n\n“The changes are especially problematic for Black, Hispanic and immigrant entrepreneurs,” the report continued. “In the name of eradicating diversity, equity and inclusion practices, the Small Business Administration is shedding programs aimed at helping disadvantaged businesses, including those run by women.”\n\nWatch above via Sunday Morning Futures on Fox News.\n\nThe post Trump Official Brags On Fox News: ‘I Don’t Think Small Business Owners Have Ever Been So Excited to Pay Their Taxes!’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "Tiffany Chng and Olivia Yiong were work besties. Both were laid off, so during the pandemic, they ditched corporate and launched an athleisure brand.",
    "fullText": "Tiffany Chng and Olivia Yiong said they went from being work besties to regular besties and then work besties again.\n\nThe duo, both 31, met in 2018 and became inseparable while working at GuavaPass, a fitness app. Yiong was laid off when Guavapass was acquired by ClassPass in 2019.\n\nTwo years later, during the pandemic, Chng was laid off from her marketing job. The duo reunited to launch an athleisure brand, then called Butter, despite having no experience in fashion or entrepreneurship.\n\nChng's retrenchment and the pandemic lockdown gave them the push they needed to start the brand.\n\n\"At that point, we had nothing to lose,\" Yiong said.\n\nThey started with online sales, and in October this year, they opened their first retail store in Singapore's upscale ION Orchard mall, in the heart of the city's luxury shopping district.\n\nBuilding a brand during the pandemic in an already saturated market and for a conservative audience was not easy.\n\nExercise and sports have always been a big part of the founders' lives.\n\nYiong was an F45 trainer, has practiced yoga, pilates, and Muay Thai, and is now training for her first Hyrox. Chng was part of a national team representing Singapore at the 2011 Touch Rugby World Cup and has also dabbled in cheerleading, pilates, yoga, and HIIT.\n\nWhen Chng was laid off from ClassPass in 2020, they decided to go all in on an athleisure clothing line, which started off with the name \"Butter.\" They invested 20,000 Singapore dollars in 2020 into the brand.\n\nHalf came from Yiong's savings, and the other half came from Chng's severance pay.\n\nThey started product design in March 2020 and found suppliers in China. They launched in October that year with just two products in two colors: a longline sports bra and a pair of leggings.\n\nCOVID lockdowns that pushed everyone online helped them gain visibility. About 500 people joined an online workout they hosted in March 2021.\n\nIn 2022, they sold the brand to Love, Bonito, a Singaporean women's wear brand. Afterward, they changed the brand's name to Cheak.\n\nLaunching an athleisure brand in Singapore came with a unique set of challenges.\n\nWomen in Singapore and Southeast Asia place a high value on modesty and require padding in the bust, the duo said.\n\n\"A lot of overseas brands don't have padding. In Singapore, you need padding; it's non-negotiable. One of the most commonly asked questions we get is, 'Does it have padding?'\" Chng said.\n\n\"But padding changes the construction completely for the product — it requires so many more stitches, and it makes it difficult to have a very clean bind,\" she added.\n\nAnother issue was the sheerness of the fabric.\n\n\"Overseas brands don't double line their lighter colors because I think the women are a bit more comfortable with a slight sheerness, but in Singapore, that's not acceptable,\" she said.\n\n\"But when you double-line a garment, it becomes very thick. So, we spent about a year changing the fabric and reducing its thickness so that when we double-lined it, it would still be comfortable,\" Chng added.\n\nDesigning clothes for a customer base that likes to play it safe requires a good deal of restraint, the founders said. They said there was plenty they wanted to experiment with, but had to tone down.\n\n\"A lot of brands that are quite popular internationally are quite sexy and crazy nowadays,\" Yiong said. \"So we take that idea, and tweak it to what will work for our audience.\"\n\nSingapore is becoming a competitive space for athleisure brands. Alo Yoga, the athleisure brand worn by Kendall Jenner and Hailey Bieber, opened its first store in the city's Marina Bay Sands mall in September.\n\nIn ION Orchard, the mall where Cheak is located, shoppers can also find Lululemon, Cotton On Body, and Adidas.\n\nTo stand out, Cheak focuses on making clothes for Asian women — and that doesn't just mean making them more petite.\n\n\"The bust shape is different, our waists are smaller, our hips are slightly wider, and the femur is also a little bit shorter,\" Yiong said.\n\nSizing is different for Asian women, too, she added.\n\n\"We don't necessarily grow taller as we get bigger; we grow width-wise,\" Yiong said.\n\nShe also said that international brands do not suitably cater to the hot and humid climate that Southeast Asia is known for.\n\n\"Fresh international brands, let's say Alo, for example, they come in bringing winter season clothes,\" she said. \"There's no winter; we only have one season, so the fabric needs to be cooling.\"\n\nCheak's prices are slightly lower than those of its foreign competitors. One of Cheak's bestselling sports bras costs 55 Singapore dollars, or about $42, while a similar-looking piece from Lululemon costs S$58.\n\nThe business has yet to come between the founders.\n\n\"Outside of work, we don't talk about work,\" Chng said. \"We see each other on weekends, and our partners hang out together, but we never talk about work.\"\n\nOn the flipside, at work, they don't talk about other things, helping to distinguish their \"work personality and friend personality.\"\n\nYiong handles the backend work, while Chng handles the creative and customer-facing parts of the work.\n\nBut work and life inevitably collide, like when they go on holiday together and fire up their laptops to solve a crisis.\n\n\"Our partners see that as their cue to go do their own thing,\" Yiong joked.\n\nRunning their business comes with many perks. Chng, who just had a baby, said she loves having a flexible schedule and working in a hybrid setting.\n\nBut that doesn't mean it's less stressful than a corporate job.\n\n\"I think a lot of people glamorize what being a founder or starting your own business is,\" she said. \"You have to be able to give up everything, your time, your money, your brain power, your emotions into the business because if you don't do it, no one else is going to.\"\n\nShe added, \"It takes a different kind of resilience to handle it, but at the same time, I wouldn't trade it for anything.\"",

    "description": "Sridhar Ramaswamy told Business Insider that while \"meetings are like bureaucracies,\" he depends on them to make decisions.",
    "fullText": "Many CEOs see meetings as the pinnacle of corporate bureaucracy — and have been on a tear to minimize them.\n\nSnowflake CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy is no exception. Business Insider previously reported that Snowflake has tracked the number of phone calls and in-person meetings as it pushes for greater efficiency. Ramaswamy told Business Insider that \"meetings are like bureaucracies,\" and that \"all of us hate bureaucracies except our own.\"\n\nRamaswamy, who joined the cloud data-warehousing company in 2023, said he doesn't make product or company decisions one-on-one with anyone, and expects published notes about them before and after.\n\nTo ensure that meetings are an effective use of everyone's time, the CEO said he still tries to stick to clear principles. Here are the four requirements he has for all meetings:\n\nRamaswamy's first requirement is to share an agenda prior to the meeting.\n\n\"I will not go to meetings whose agendas and materials are not published in advance,\" the CEO said.\n\nHe said he's an early riser and he spends every morning from 5 a.m. to 7 a.m. prepping for the various meetings he's going to that day. In addition to receiving an agenda before, he said he also expects notes after every meeting.\n\nRamaswamy said he doesn't hold meetings just to check a box. Instead, the CEO said he's a \"huge fan\" of making sure meetings are run well — with the right people in the room and a clear point of view on the topic being discussed.\n\n\"Meetings should not become something for prestige or for being in the loop,\" Ramaswamy said.\n\nRamaswamy said he uses meetings as a place to push for open conversation instead of repeating facts.\n\n\"Facts can be read offline. It is more efficient,\" the CEO said.\n\nRamaswamy said he makes an effort to ensure there's a diverse range of viewpoints in his meetings. He said sometimes he attends sessions where one or two people take over — and he tries to steer the group away from those dynamics.\n\n\"If I am in any any meeting and I see that happen, I see that as my job to make sure that there is a fair distribution of time and people feel like their voices are indeed being heard,\" Ramaswamy said.\n\nRamaswamy said he feels generally \"itchy in meetings\" and wants to get things done quickly. He said if he ends a meeting with achieving \"glorious success,\" he suggests everyone exits it on the spot.\n\n\"We should all leave quietly right now, in case we just create more problems for ourselves,\" Ramaswamy said he tells employees.",

    "description": "Business Insider's health team share the best tips and trends we followed this year, from workout hacks to healthy eating to better morning routines.",
    "fullText": "As a health reporter, I love to tell people \"no.\"\n\nNo, you probably don't need to add protein to everything. No, you won't get swole in a month with that one-minute Instagram workout. No, a Paleo diet won't fix all your problems (and probably isn't historically accurate).\n\nThat's why, as the end of the year approaches, I wanted to change things up and ask my esteemed colleagues what simple hacks actually have made a difference for them — whether it's working out smarter, eating better, and living well.\n\nAfter a year of talking to health experts, and reading lots and lots of science, here's what helped us move the needle for a healthier mind and body in 2025.\n\nLike many of our readers, I live in a household with two working parents. Our kids are still on the younger side, 6 and 8, so life is fairly hectic. Of course, my mind is always racing, planning, organizing, scheduling, and doing all of the other things that come along with managing the mental load that we're all very aware of these days. Turning my brain off, or at least briefly pushing pause, is tricky, especially at bedtime.\n\nCommitting to taking a few deep breaths as soon as I get under the sheets has done wonders for me. Sometimes I'll follow a quick meditation track on my phone; other times, I'll do some box breathing. But more often than not, I just try to breathe in and out for a few minutes, focusing on the movement of my body and nothing else. The practice helps clear my mind and gets my body ready for bed — and the flurry I know tomorrow will bring.\n\nJennifer Beck Goldblatt, Senior Editor, Health & Parenting\n\nThis year, I've been putting a little bit of ginger in almost everything. Fresh ginger tea, grated ginger to add zip to soups and stews, and crystallized ginger as a sweet treat. I generally eat a healthy diet — lots of fiber, fruits and veggies, home-cooked meals — but the extra ginger has made a big difference for my gut health. I'm less likely to have an upset stomach even when I indulge my passion for spicy food.\n\nOne of my favorite recipes to make in big batches is fresh ginger tea with turmeric, black pepper, a bit of cayenne, and plenty of honey. It smells great, and it's warming and full of antioxidants for a perfect self-care break any time of day.\n\nMidway through the year, I bought a Brick for my phone. It's a gadget on my fridge that helps me block whichever apps I choose (in my case, my email and internet, since I already got rid of social media on my phone).\n\nI tap my phone every night before I unwind for bed and usually don't tap again until right before work starts — my peak junk-scrolling times. Something about the humiliation of having to physically walk up to my fridge because I want to Google an actor from a niche '80s movie keeps me from un-Bricking. I get to my morning workouts quicker and read more books, which has made me a much happier person.\n\nBuying an air fryer has been a game changer for quickly rustling up nutritious food. I thought they were for heating up fries and frozen treats, and that you couldn't use them to heat saucy foods, like the curries and bean stews I cook and freeze.\n\nSince realizing you can get air fryer-proof dishes, which can be DIYed with foil or baking paper, I've made dozens of protein pancakes for breakfast. I enjoy frozen veggies that are no longer soggy and sad from being defrosted in the microwave, batch-cook chicken meatballs in 10 minutes before work, and can quickly reheat my trusty frozen beans. (To make pancakes, mix up the regular ingredients, cook the batter in a single layer in the air fryer, then chop and stack once cooked.)\n\nKashmira Gander, Senior Health Editor\n\nMy kids are finally all in the same school (and therefore same schedule), which means I have a bit more time in the mornings for myself before hopping online for work. I've been taking 15-30 minute walks in the morning to get some fresh air and sunlight before spending the rest of my day in front of a computer.\n\nI joke I'm like a plant and need as much sunlight as possible to have the best mood I can have, so prioritizing time outside has helped, especially with SAD now that the darker months are upon us [that's seasonal affective disorder — when your mood and energy tanks in the fall and winter.]\n\nConz Preti, Deputy Editor, Parenting & Health\n\nIn March of this year, I committed to waking up after my first alarm goes off, rather than snoozing it at least two extra times, as I had been accustomed to doing since middle school.\n\nI made this small but radical change because I was feeling exhausted all the time, and I've found that my energy level feels far more stable, and my mood tends to be better throughout the day when I manage it. It can be really difficult in the moment, but the payoff has been huge!\n\nI finally started pelvic floor physical therapy! And, reader, let me tell you: It's worth it. The pelvic floor is a \"hammock\" of muscles in your pelvis that controls your core, your breathing, your bladder, your sexual function, your digestive system, and so much more.\n\nCan you feel yours? Unless you're pregnant or have incontinence, the answer is probably \"no.\" But that doesn't mean you should leave it un-therapized. Even just one session with a pelvic floor PT showed me what I was doing wrong. I left with useful exercises I can do to improve my core control and my breathing so that my workouts are more effective, and don't put unnecessary stress on my organs. I'm a convert.\n\nMia de Graaf, Deputy Executive Editor, Health & Features\n\nI'd been in a running rut for years. I was bored with my usual routine of running a few miles at a leisurely pace, but trying to actively track and increase my speed felt daunting as well. Getting a VO2 max assessment taught me that I could run a lot faster than I thought I could — and having exact numbers to shoot for was very helpful, too. I've since joined a nearby Orangetheory, which focuses on hitting higher heart rate zones throughout class, and have slowly inched up to running paces I thought unimaginable a year ago.\n\nMy trainer gave me some advice that helped me get through a big fitness slump.\n\nEveryone's training typically falls into three phases each year: terrible, OK, and great, he said. I was in the \"terrible\" stage, where your motivation is wiped.\n\nTo my surprise, that's where my trainer was, too. Learning that even athletes like him struggle with motivation helped ease my embarrassment.\n\nIt made it easier to give myself permission not to go near a gym for three months after I got burned out by a Hyrox-esque fitness contest. I thought long-term, enjoyed leisurely walks, and the odd PS Fit YouTube dance video, knowing I'd eventually get back to regular exercise, whether that was restarting functional fitness or trying something new.\n\nI was right: I'm now doing regular Saturday morning 5K runs with my neighbor, and started using the Ladder training app this fall. The big takeaway: be kind to yourself.\n\nKashmira Gander, Senior Health Editor",

    "fullText": "Diane Brady writes about the issues and leaders impacting the global business landscape. In addition to writing Fortune’s CEO Daily newsletter, she co-hosts the Leadership Next podcast, interviews newsmakers on stage at events worldwide and oversees the Fortune CEO Initiative. She previously worked at Forbes, McKinsey, Bloomberg Businessweek, the Wall Street Journal, and Maclean's. Her book Fraternity was named one of Amazon’s best books of 2012, and she also co-wrote Connecting the Dots with former Cisco CEO John Chambers.\n\nOn Jan. 4, 2023, GE HealthCare Technologies (No. 219 on the Fortune 500) debuted as a standalone public company on the Nasdaq exchange. Since then, its stock is up almost 50%. It was the first of three businesses to be spun off in the breakup of General Electric, the conglomerate founded on the inventions of Thomas Edison that went public in 1892 and became one of the original 12 components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average four years later. (GE Vernova, No. 130, and GE Aerospace, No. 118, each went public on the New York Stock Exchange in April 2024.)\n\nGE HealthCare CEO Peter J. Arduini, the man tapped to lead the $20 billion-a-year business, spoke to Fortune about how he’s forging a new chapter for the medical technology and digital health company while drawing on GE’s legacy.\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nYou were initially at GE during the Jack Welch years, starting in 1990, and left a few years after Jeff Immelt took over. What do you think made GE stand apart?\n\nAt the time, I was a Proctor & Gamble guy, and I did not love the grocery business. I got a call from someone who talked about a perfect opportunity in technology and global businesses at a company called GE Medical Systems at the time. I didn’t even know GE had a medical business then.\n\nGoing to GE in those days, with its leadership development, you had the opportunity to take on bigger responsibilities at a very young age—I look back and say, probably too young an age. But it was one of those rare companies where they gave you bold assignments and you had this wide diversity of potential opportunities that you could play in. You learned how to run a company the GE way. The candor and the openness about what’s working, what’s not working, really permeated, how to do the right thing. It was tough culture, but you knew it was a fair culture, and that’s what really made it successful under Jack.\n\nAfter leaving in 2005, what made you decide to come back?\n\nA headhunter called and said, [the then-GE CEO] Larry Culp wants to speak with you.’ And I said, ‘I don’t know if I’m really interested in going back to GE.’ My wife convinced me to give a call back. I talked to the headhunter, and he said, ‘Well, I’ll pass it on to Larry.’ Literally, 10 minutes later, I got a text that said, ‘Hey, Pete, this is Larry Culp. I’d love to chat with you.’ I texted back to say, ‘Well, look, I can contact your assistant.’ And Larry, right then, said, ‘Hey, do you have five minutes now?’ That’s the essence of Larry; he’s a very down-to-earth guy, a very focused and very intentional guy.\n\nThose five minutes convinced you to take the job?\n\nIt was probably more than the five, but honestly, his impact and his leadership made a difference. This was a chance to create three separate companies, to take this company public. I got very interested and very excited about it.\n\nWhy did it make sense for GE HealthCare to be a separate company?\n\nEverything has a cycle. On the technology side and on the market side, there was such a fast transition and evolution, with new competitors coming into new markets. When you’re in a larger business, in many cases, decisions take longer. And focus matters in our business. It is all about signal to noise; you want more signal, less noise. In a larger company, there has to be a little bit more noise.\n\nThe past three years have been interesting time for med tech. Looking back, what did you over-index on or under-appreciate?\n\nAt a macro level, look at the environment, between the China market, which was always a double-digit growth or changing the geopolitical environment and how we need to change around our supply chains because of tariffs. Those are kind of the unplanned events that where you ask: Do you have the right people? Do you have a management system that can deal with the clock speed and the differentiation? Do you have the right innovation-processing capability? If you don’t have the innovation, it’s difficult to get the price, it’s difficult to hold share, it’s difficult to grow. We were somewhat of a cash cow as part of the GE integrated model. We weren’t starved, but we weren’t funded for leading innovation. So I’d say one of the things I felt that I did well—and, like most credit, comes from listening to people that are wiser than you and having humility to understand that that’s the action—is lean into innovation.\n\nYou think what products you need, four years out, and fund them to the max, because it’s the rules of the farm. You got to get the seeds in the ground. They’ve got to germinate. You got to get the plants to grow till you get fruit. In our business, that’s a three to five year cycle.\n\n“We laid out this purpose of creating a world where health care has no limits, and a big part of that was to say we’re humble to know that we don’t have all the answers.”GE HealthCare CEO Peter J. Arduini\n\nI think our teams did a really good job with the focus on making the right investments early. In 2018, to give an example, we probably spent $750 million to $800 million on research and development. R&D will be north of $1.4 billion this year. So we fundamentally doubled the R&D investment. We cut costs in other areas and simplified some of the company.\n\nThrough lean manufacturing techniques?\n\nWe changed some of the field organization, about 40% to 50% of the leaders. We upgraded talent across the board, and I spent a lot of time on what our vision is, what our values are, and do we have the right people who can match up to that? In the last two years, we’ve really made a lot of progress on what we’re calling our heartbeat management system, which is really about a lean principles construct for how you run your company. What is the daily management at different levels in the organization? What is standard work that is needed to be done in all areas, the use of Kaizen and really bringing customer employees into the decision making?\n\nLarry Culp is a big proponent of Kaizen and I think back to GE’s reputation in promoting Six Sigma. How would you say the culture has shifted as an independent company?\n\nI tried to take the GE of old and took what was really good: how we think about our distribution of leadership, how we actually talk about leader development, how we build out our own Crotonville virtual university of development. The GE model was really stellar, and, honestly, prior to Larry coming back, some of that had dissolved. We didn’t even really do performance reviews in the same way and he brought that back.\n\nI would say I even reached back further to some of the Jack Welch-period of tools, There are things that we did really well that we want to utilize in a more contemporary way. As an example, I think Crotonville was a fabulous destination for training and development, In today’s world, it’s not practical to bring everybody to upstate New York, but we can take the tools and the capabilities and recreate that in virtual and other environments around the world.\n\nIn health care, we had our own distinct way of thinking about innovation pipeline, and it was something called worldwide product. It had kind of phased away in the last decade or so, and I resurrected it, but in a new format: more digital focused, more connected …from diagnosis through therapy, through action, follow up and how the money flows. The integration of cloud-based computing and artificial intelligence. We look at the full stack for the company. And that’s been a game changer for us to take valuable resources and move them.\n\nWe laid out this purpose of creating a world where health care has no limits, and a big part of that was to say we’re humble to know that we don’t have all the answers. We want to work with customers on jointly solving problems which, again, is the core to the lean mindset. Servant leadership as a big part of it, which turns the pyramid upside down. My job is to help everybody else get their job done. We’re all focused on the customer. We’re all focused on the patient. We spent a lot of time talking about entrepreneurship because in our business, the way we’re going to be successful is in this broader ecosystem. We don’t have to own everything, we don’t have to make everything, but we have to be more creative. We talk about teamwork and inclusive teams. We actually drive and reward and recognize people on how well they live up to those values.\n\nThe landscape has shifted for global companies. Where do you see the biggest challenges and opportunities right now?\n\nIf I think about med tech as an industry, it’s an American gem. Still, 70%-plus of the products are made the United States, the majority of the IP, the technology is here. And so having that protected or enhanced by our government policy is important.\n\nWe’ve spent a lot of time trying to make that case clear and I think, for the most part, it’s been heard. Having global footprints and manufacturing and R&D is super critical because you can’t make everything in the United States to be competitive. You can’t, in a world post-COVID, have an integrated single point of control for all supply chains. Many of us used to say, here’s the least expensive place to buy this, or the best quality, then we would do it one place and ship it all over the world. We found during COVID that’s just not the model that works.\n\nWe’re bringing more and more U.S. products and their subcomponents back to North America. In China, we used to ship in 75% of the products from different parts around the world. Now we make 85%, almost 90% of the products in China, for China.\n\nWhy do you want to be in China?\n\nLook,it’s 1.4 billion people, where 400 million have reasonable. We often forget that. You know, we’re a nation of 375 million people, and you can judge how good our care is. There’s still a billion people in China that don’t have adequate care, and so at some point, it will be the largest health care market. I’m a big believer that, with China and the U.S., the more we work together in harmony, it’s only going to help the world. And honestly, for companies like us, it’s really a necessity for being able to kind of reach our full potential.\n\nYou’ve been at companies that are known as training grounds for leaders. I’d just love to hear your reflections on being in a CEO role the last three years.\n\nI think authenticity is super important. I can be an extrovert when needed, but I tend to be a little bit more introverted. In today’s world, with our younger employee base, being out front and being vocal as the senior leader—not necessarily the charismatic leader, but the communicator directly to individuals—is super important. Social media gets more reads from your employees than even some internal communications. It’s a reality.\n\nI think this ability to reach people in many different ways is critical for running a company. Leaning in on what the mission of the company is, and the why and helping people understand the why, is also critical. And then there’s the classic age-old factor of bringing customers into the story, talking about how you’ve changed the life of a patient. This could be your mother, your father on that table. The more I can empower people to live those values, that’s how we get excellence.",

    "description": "14-year-old Alby Churven founded Clovr. He told Business Insider his age gave him a \"wow factor\" but limits his \"legitimacy.\"",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Alby Churven, the 14-year-old founder of Clovr, who lives in Wollongong, Australia. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhen I was younger, I started an e-commerce grip socks brand called Alpha Grips. It failed, but that's what got me interested in business. I was 12.\n\nA lot of kids' first businesses is always something to do with e-commerce, like drop-shipping or clothing brands. Social media does saturate you with that \"get rich quick\" idea with drop-shipping or crypto. Although 90% of the time it's a scam, it still ignites an interest.\n\nThen I came up with the idea of Finkel, the startup I applied to Y Combinator with. I sent a cold email to Frank Greeff who's a pretty big founder here. He recommended I started building in public on social media, so I started doing that. X is full of startups.\n\nSocial media played a big role, seeing other people building brands and businesses. That's what got me into it. I used to do code camps when I was younger, so I've always been interested in tech and entrepreneurship.\n\nI applied to YC. Apparently I wasn't supposed to do this big video with all the editing. It's supposed to be, you sit down and turn on the webcam and talk. I didn't actually read the instructions when I did it, but I guess that's what made it pretty viral.\n\nMy application video for Y Combinator.\n\nJust applied to @ycombinator as a 14 year old founder. pic.twitter.com/hB44OvbbXh\n\nThere's a new social media ban in Australia for people under 16. All these great things have happened for me with it, but the social media ban is taking that away. I don't agree with it, but it is what it is.\n\nI'm young. I think my advantage being a teenage entrepreneur is I've got time. My goal right now is to build as many things as possible, learn as much as possible, and see where it goes.\n\nYou decide you want to do maybe when you're 18 or 16. But I know what I want to do. I want to be in startups and tech.\n\nThe benefits of starting young is that you don't have as much pressure on you financially, so you can just build things.\n\nIn the future, I'll have had experience. It's about learning. I have time on my hands, and I enjoy it.\n\nThe younger generation thinks a bit differently. Some older people may not even know how to use AI.\n\nI'm in the US right now, and I've been meeting with a lot of really cool people. When you're young, you can utilize your age to make a lot of connections. It's more rare. It's crazy you're doing it this young.\n\nMy age is a wow factor, but it also limits legitimacy.\n\nIt also can be a negative. People might not take you seriously if you're really trying to pursue something. All the things I'm building are bootstrapped, because it's impossible to raise funding when you're young.\n\nI'm getting to stages in my projects where I do need some money. I've applied to these accelerators. I had a very low expectation for Y Combinator. I got an interview about my other startup, Clovr, but then I got rejected.\n\nI've heard you have to get in the system early, so when I'm older and I apply, I'll already be in the system and have experience with how the process works.\n\nI do think grants are a really good opportunity. You won't raise nearly as much, but you're not giving away any equity. I think giving away equity young is not a good decision. It gives pressure to perform and deliver, and when you're young, you want to build stuff.",

    "description": "A trio of traders who rose to fame betting against the US housing market told Business Insider they see a continuation of debasement trade in 2026.",
    "fullText": "Michael Burry gets a lot of attention these days, but there were a handful of other traders who also saw the collapse of US housing market coming from a mile away.\n\nThree of them told Business Insider recently that they're all betting on the same macro development in 2026.\n\nAmong the traders who rose to fame during the subprime mortgage crisis were the members of a small investing firm called FrontPoint Partners. They included Danny Moses, Vinny Daniel, and Porter Collins. All three have left the company and now collaborate on a Substack and podcast titled What Are We Doing?, on which they discuss contrarian investment takes.\n\nBusiness Insider recently asked all three traders about their highest conviction calls heading into 2026, and each had a similar answer.\n\nIn short, the trio highlighted a slow-burning macro shift that they see putting pressure on the US dollar.\n\nThe stock market has enjoyed a year of mostly upward momentum in 2025, primarily benefitting from the AI trade, an area Moses has expressed some skepticism about. But the three traders are maintaining a fairly cautious outlook as they prepare for the coming year.\n\nMoses told Business Insider that if he had to express his high conviction macro view for 2026 through one trade, it would be betting on gold, a cornerstone of his investing strategy for several years.\n\nHe believes that even after gold's breakout year, the precious metal is poised for more growth as the dollar's standing as the world's reserve currency wanes. He noted that he doesn't see anything ahead that could derail gold's rally.\n\n\"Between the geopolitics and the sovereign debt levels, I think it just continues to move higher,\" he said. \"To me, gold is the thing that people should watch as an indication for economic stability or macroeconomic stability, including the US dollar.\"\n\nMoses highlighted a weakened US dollar, noting that a decline in the US currency tends to coincide with strong gold prices.\n\nVincent Daniel, now the co-founder of investment firm Seawolf Capital, also saw a continuation of the debasement trade in 2026. \n\n\"Even though it's been an incredible trade, we think it's going to continue, albeit maybe with a little bit more fits and starts, but we think it'll outperform the S&P,\" he stated.\n\nDaniel said that his firm sees significant growth potential in emerging markets, specifically China and Brazil. He added that while many business-friendly governments have come to power in Latin America recently, Brazil has high interest rates and real rates of return, in addition to attractively priced stocks.\n\nCollins, a portfolio manager at Seawolf Capital, initially hesitated to express one high-conviction macro trade for 2026. However, like Moses, he pointed to the US dollar's ongoing decline, adding that he sees it losing its value against precious metals, naming gold as a key example.\n\n\"I don't know if I have a high conviction around it, but I have a general view that's going to occur,\" he said.\n\nThat said, Collins added that gold prices look stretched and he isn't ruling out a pullback in early 2026.",

    "description": "\"I use it, despite the fact that I think it's going to destroy us,\" one Democratic senator told Business Insider.",
    "fullText": "As recently as June, Sen. Elizabeth Warren was one of several lawmakers who resisted using AI, owing to a skepticism of the technology's ability to deliver accurate information.\n\n\"Yeah, that's changed,\" the Massachusetts Democrat said with a laugh this month, explaining that she now finds ChatGPT to be \"really valuable\" for basic research questions, even if she still catches the occasional hallucination.\n\nWarren said that she began using ChatGPT more after seeing her daughter use it. She says she doesn't \"rely\" on the technology, but uses it to \"start to approach a problem.\"\n\n\"Like, I'm in the middle of reading something, and I think: How many people are there in Mississippi? And what's the breakdown of little children, and people over 65?\" Warren said. \"I pop that into ChatGPT and get an answer that's better than a straight Google answer. I can get more detail, and more ways to slice and dice the numbers.\"\n\nOther skeptics are tiptoeing their way into using the technology, including some who are otherwise major critics of the AI industry.\n\n\"The other day, I decided, you know what, maybe after doing all these hearings on ChatGPT, I should at least see how it works,\" Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri told Business Insider, saying he asked a \"very nerdy historical question\" to ChatGPT about the Puritans in the 1630s. \"I will say that it returned a lot of good information.\"\n\n\"I use it, despite the fact that I think it's going to destroy us,\" Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut told Business Insider.\n\nAt the highest levels of the American government, personal AI adoption remains spotty. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters in November that she doesn't think President Donald Trump uses the technology himself.\n\n\"I've never witnessed it,\" she said. \"So I can't attest to that.\"\n\nVice President JD Vance, meanwhile, declared himself a \"Grok guy\" in an interview with Fox News's Sean Hannity in November.\n\n\"I think it's the best,\" Vance said of the Elon Musk-owned AI chatbot. \"It's also the least woke.\"\n\nBut House Speaker Mike Johnson said that he hasn't used AI himself, saying on the Katie Miller podcast that he simply hasn't had the \"luxury of time\" to get into it.\n\n\"I just haven't gotten into it yet. My life is not normal right now, okay?\" Johnson said. \"And AI has really been — it's become in popular use really during the term of my speakerhip, for the last two years. And so I just haven't had time to engage.\"\n\nAs lawmakers have begun working more with AI, some have had strange experiences. Democratic Rep. Jared Huffman of California told Business Insider that at one point, he tried to use Microsoft Copilot to look up what was inscribed on the bullet casings of Charlie Kirk's alleged murder suspect.\n\nInstead, Huffman says he ended up in an argument, and that Copilot insisted that Kirk was still alive despite the congressman prompting the AI with information to the contrary.\n\n\"It continued to fight with me, insisting that the whole assassination was a conspiracy theory,\" Huffman said. \"It was freaking weird.\"\n\nMost lawmakers who spoke with Business Insider said that they use ChatGPT.\n\nBut at least one — Democratic Rep. Don Beyer of Virginia — said he preferred to use Anthropic's Claude, owing to the company's focus on safety and ethics in AI.\n\n\"I was very impressed with the fact that they actually put together their own Constitution on the ethical use,\" Beyer said. \"They seem to be — at least they're positioned as — more enlightened.\"",

    "title": "'We made 25 jars at a time with six pans on the go - now our business boasts a world's best marmalade'",
    "description": "Nicola Elliott is founder of Single Variety Co, an award-winning premium preserves brand that’s challenging the way food businesses grow.",
    "fullText": "There couldn’t have been any better validation for Nicola Elliott to launch her food business in 2016 than winning a gold award just one month after producing her first ever batch of Seville marmalade. “It gave me the confidence to go forward if the marmalade was that good,” recalls Elliott, founder of Single Variety Co.\n\nShe went one better this year. At the same World Marmalade Awards, her Amalfi lemon marmalade went to the final round of tasting and then scooped double gold and top accolade in an emotional moment for the British entrepreneur. “To do it at the scale that we are making it says we are doing everything right,” says Elliott.\n\nIn the early throes of her single-fruit preserves startup, Elliott was making 25 jars at a time with six pans going simultaneously and two part-time staff, as well as family and friends helping out.\n\nFrom selling her jams on a Balham market stall to owning her production facility, having shunned mass supermarket listings to retain independent quality, Single Variety Co now produces 5,000 jars per week and is set for latest annual revenues of £1.7m.\n\nIt is all a far cry from seven years ago when Elliott received her first export order to Germany for 8,000 jars of raspberry preserve. “I said ‘yes’ thinking I would be making 25 jars at a time. Somehow we did it over six weeks. We didn’t make any money on the order but it was the turning point for us.”\n\nThe business lesson led to Elliott reluctantly outsourcing production for a few years until her husband — a “people person”, former personal trainer and tennis coach — joined the business and the couple moved to Bristol and a £200,000 outlay to set up their jam factory five years ago.\n\nIn her former career as a fresh foods product developer at the likes of Sainsbury’s, Elliott cut a frustrated figure in a role she admits was cost-focussed and in which quality wasn’t a priority. She left her supermarket career to set her sights on a short shelf-life product.\n\n“When you mass-produce, quality has to give way. I was determined to make the quality what we aimed for,” she admits.\n\nAt the time, Elliott noticed that premium jams had champagne added to the strawberries or bay leaves to blackberries and “no one was making just great-tasting strawberry jam.”\n\nIt hasn’t all gone according to plan. Elliott once purchased the wrong second-hand jam kettle, at £12,000, instead of an electric kettle, which her husband still reminds the working mother of today.\n\nNow with a staff of 12, she works directly with UK fruit farmers for her products. These include seasonal limited edition jams such as traditional rhubarb from Yorkshire, which grows in the dark and is picked by candlelight.",

    "fullText": "In banking, telecom, and payments, reliability is not a nice to have. It is table stakes. The most reliable systems I have worked on reduce entire classes of bugs before the code even runs. Functional programming and Algebraic Data Types (ADTs) let you push correctness into the type system, so illegal states cannot be constructed in the first place.\n\nMost production incidents are not due to complex algorithms. They are due to the code entering a state that should never have been possible. If you have been on call, you have seen variants of these:\n\nFunctional programming helps by modeling the domain with types that make invalid states unrepresentable. Pure functions and immutability keep behavior predictable and testable.\n\nProduct types combine fields, think \"and\". Sum types choose one of several cases, think \"or\". Together they model your domain rules.\n\nWith this shape, \"paypal\" cannot exist as a Payment. The compiler refuses the value.\n\nWhen you pattern match on a sum type, the compiler can force you to handle every variant. If you later add a new case, every non exhaustive match becomes a compilation error or warning. This is how refactors become safe by default.\n\nAdd a new Crypto method and both code bases will point out every place you must update.\n\nIncident story\n\nA payout worker retries on network timeouts and calls settle() twice. The table allows pending = false and settled = true twice with the same ledger id. Reconciliation finds duplicates and accounting needs a manual fix.\n\nWhy it happened\n\nState is spread across booleans and strings. The database does not express the lifecycle. The application code does, but only by convention and tests.\n\nTransitions become total functions. You can return a Result when a transition is not allowed.\n\nNow the illegal transitions are blocked by construction. Test coverage still matters, but the shape of the model prevents a class of bugs.\n\nRefactor safety\n\nWhen product adds Chargeback, the compiler highlights every match that ignores it. You cannot ship with a half handled lifecycle.\n\nEvery switch on TxnState now requires a chargeback branch. This is free guidance from the compiler.\n\nIncident story\n\nThe call detail record pipeline generates billing events whenever it sees a Connected event. Under jitter and retries, some sessions never receive Completed. The billing system charges based on the wrong boundary and customers complain.\n\nWhy it happened\n\nThe call lifecycle is implicit across many services. A connected session with no end was still billable because there was no type that separated non billable states from billable ones.\n\nNow a connected but never completed call cannot produce a billable duration. The shape forbids the bug.\n\nIncident story\n\nA cache TTL is stored in an environment variable. Someone sets CACHE_TTL_SECS=30s. In JavaScript, Number(\"30s\") yields NaN and your code treats it as zero, disabling caching in production.\n\nThe ambiguity disappears. The code must handle absence and parse errors explicitly.\n\nDo not use null to mean \"maybe\". Do not throw exceptions for expected errors.\n\nThese types make the happy path and the error path equally explicit.\n\nMutable shared state is a common source of heisenbugs under concurrency. Prefer immutable data and pure functions. When you need to update, create a new value.\n\nYour tests become simple. Given the same inputs, the function returns the same output.\n\nNumbers are not self describing. Create types that carry meaning.\n\nYou stop mixing milliseconds with seconds or dollars with cents by accident.\n\nKeep the domain logic pure and push IO to the edges. This makes unit tests cheap and fast.\n\nStart small and make continuous progress. Here is a practical order for a team new to these ideas.\n\nReplace pairs of booleans with a sum type\n\nReplace string enums with discriminated unions\n\nReplace nullable fields with Option\n\nReplace thrown control flow with Result\n\nIntroduce newtypes or branded types for units and ids\n\nPattern matching compiles to simple branches. Discriminated unions in TypeScript are just plain objects. The main cost you will feel is validation at the boundaries in smart constructors. This is a trade worth making. The compiler then protects the interior of the system.\n\nReliability is designed. With Algebraic Data Types, pattern matching, Option and Result, immutability, and smart constructors, you encode domain rules directly in your types. Illegal states cannot compile. This is why industries that cannot afford failure, such as banking and telecom, gravitate to functional ideas.\n\nIf you work on code that touches money, minutes, or public availability, adopt these patterns now.\n\nYour on call shifts will be quieter, and your users will notice the difference.",

    "fullText": "SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Jeffrey R. Holland, a high-ranking official in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints who was next in line to become the faith's president, has died. He was 85.\n\nHolland died early Saturday morning from complications associated with kidney disease, the church announced on its website.\n\nHolland, who died in Salt Lake City, led a governing body called the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, which helps set church policy while overseeing the many business interests of what is known widely as the Mormon church.\n\nHe was the longest-tenured member of the Quorum of the Twelve after President Dallin H. Oaks, making him next in line to lead the church under a long-established succession plan. Oaks, 93, became president of the church and its more than 17 million-strong global membership in October.\n\nHenry B. Eyring, who is 92 and one of Oaks' two top counselors, is now next in line for the presidency.\n\nHolland had been hospitalized during the Christmas holiday for ongoing health complications, the church said. Experts on the faith pointed to his declining health in October when Oaks did not select Holland as a counselor.\n\nHis death leaves a vacancy in the Quorum of the Twelve that Oaks will fill in coming months, likely by calling a new apostle from a lower-tier leadership council. Apostles are all men in accordance with the church’s all-male priesthood.\n\nHolland grew up in St. George, Utah, and worked for many years in education administration before his call to join the ranks of church leadership. He served as the ninth president of Brigham Young University, the Utah-based faith's flagship school, from 1980 to 1989 and was a commissioner of the church’s global education system.\n\nUnder his leadership, the Provo university worked to improve interfaith relations and established a satellite campus in Jerusalem. The Anti-Defamation League later honored Holland with its “Torch of Liberty” award for helping foster greater understanding between Christian and Jewish communities.\n\nOaks, also a former BYU president, reflected Saturday on his more than 50 years of friendship and service with Holland, calling their relationship “long and loving.”\n\n“Over the last three decades as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, he lifted the weary, encouraged the faithful and bore a powerful witness of the Savior — even through seasons of significant personal trials,” Oaks said.\n\nHolland was known as a dynamic orator whose sermons combined scholarship with tenderness. In 2013 he spoke to church members about supporting loved ones with depression and other mental illnesses, sharing openly about times when he felt “like a broken vessel.”\n\nHolland is widely remembered for a 2021 speech in which he called on church members to take up metaphorical muskets in defense of the faith's teachings against same-sex marriage. The talk, known colloquially as “the musket fire speech,” became required reading for BYU freshmen in 2024, raising concern among LGBTQ+ students and advocates.\n\nUtah Gov. Spencer Cox, a Latter-day Saint, said no church leader has had a more profound impact on his faith than Holland.\n\n“His words had a way of penetrating my soul like no other,” Cox said. “In times of trial or darkness, I would return to them over and over again and feel the light and peace I needed.”\n\nHolland was preceded in death by his wife, Patricia Terry Holland. He is survived by their three children, 13 grandchildren and several great-grandchildren.\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Holland was preceded in death by his wife.",

It became unpopular after the Great Recession especially, and best practice dictated layoff plans would occur at times other than the holidays,” Challenger wrote.\n\nSometimes, however, companies have no choice, and employees of Circle Furniture, a New England chain that's more than 70 years old, learned that their company would be closing \"Till further notice,\" according to the company's web page on Dec 23.\n\nThat made for an unexpected near Christmas Eve layoff for workers.]\n\n“This is a concept dreamed up in the fiery pits of HR and consulting hell. Anyone who has been through the experience would never do that to another human,” Kelly Smith, a partner and lead consultant at brand strategy and creative agency Thinkhaus Idea Factory, wrote on LinkedIn.\n\nCircle Furniture employees received word about store closures via a companywide email on Dec. 19 and got another email on Dec. 23 revealing that they are being laid off, according to a report from The Boston Globe.\n\n“With a heavy heart, circumstances have gone against the business, and we can no longer afford to continue operations; therefore, all employees are being let go, including your position, effective Dec. 23,” read the layoff email.\n\nThe company's website noted the shutdown, but has the caveat that the closure may not be permanent.\n\nBefore Christmas 2025 – Employees were informed via a company-wide email that Circle Furniture would be closing all store locations “until further notice,” indicating major operational changes ahead, according to Furniture Today.\n\nDecember 23, 2025: Employees received another email confirming layoffs effective Dec. 23, wstatingthat the company “can no longer afford to continue operations,” reported Patch.\n\nLate December 2025 (around Dec. 23-24): All eight Circle Furniture stores across Massachusetts and New Hampshire were abruptly closed, with the official website stating “All Circle Furniture locations are CLOSED till further notice,” shared NBC Boston.",

    "title": "Immigration lawyers say the H-1B chaos is forcing tough business calls",
    "description": "H-1B visa policy shifts in 2025 cause firms to reconsider staffing, use alternative visas, and update HR travel guidance.",
    "fullText": "Since September, the H-1B visa program has been caught in a whirlwind of changes.\n\nAs a result, companies nationwide are scrambling to determine their next steps, rewriting travel guidance for foreign workers, and lining up backup staffing plans, including shifting some work overseas, according to five immigration attorneys who spoke with Business Insider.\n\n\"Unpredictability is one of the number one enemies for business,\" said Rohit Srinivasa, an immigration attorney based in Los Angeles who works with startups and medium-sized tech companies.\n\nFirst came a $100,000 fee on new applications in September. Then came social media vetting requirements that left visa holders stranded abroad during the holidays. Now, a wage-based lottery system will favor the highest-paid applicants by giving them more chances in the annual H-1B lottery.\n\nImmigration lawyers say the constant policy shifts have companies tightening sponsorship guidelines, re-budgeting for higher costs, and gaming out contingency plans for a program that keeps changing shape.\n\nCompanies are taking a more calculated approach to who they sponsor for work visas and how they do so, attorneys told Business Insider.\n\nDivij Kishore, an immigration attorney at New York-based Flagship Law, which represents clients across various sectors, including tech, healthcare, and energy, told Business Insider that he has seen a 40% to 50% drop in H-1B sponsorship inquiries compared to previous years.\n\nTypically, by this time of the year, clients reach out with lists of employees they'd like to sponsor for the spring lottery, Kishore said.\n\n\"This year, that's not been the case because employers are just not sure what the costs are,\" Kishore said.\n\nOn the other hand, K. Edward Raleigh, a partner at immigration firm Fragomen, which represents some of Silicon Valley's largest tech companies, including Apple and Nvidia, told Business Insider that he hasn't seen a material slowdown in H-1B filings overall, as most are renewals for existing workers.\n\nStill, companies are \"tightening up their sponsorship guidelines\" and \"proceeding with caution, understanding that various things could trigger the fee,\" he said.\n\nThis recalculation is occurring despite the $100,000 fee having a narrow scope. It applies to new visa petitions for workers living abroad and does not apply to the vast majority of cases, such as foreign students already in the US switching from an academic visa to a work visa or existing H-1B holders changing employers.\n\n\"One of the main attributes of this administration is that they keep people guessing,\" said Ted Chiappari, who leads the immigration practice at law firm Duane Morris. \"Just because things are one way on Monday doesn't mean they're going to be the same way on Tuesday, and they won't switch back to things on Wednesday.\"\n\nFewer H-1B visas have been issued to Indian IT consulting firms, according to data from the National Foundation for American Policy, an Arlington-based nonprofit research organization focused on immigration and international trade.\n\nInstead, for the first time in the program's history, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and Google occupied the top four spots for H-1B approvals in fiscal year 2025, a shift that began before the recent policy upheaval. The trend suggests companies were already reassessing tech hiring strategies before the recent policy changes.\n\nDespite the turmoil, Srinivasa believes the H-1B will endure, saying the program is \"so baked in\" to the US economy, he said, that it's undergoing overhaul rather than replacement.\n\nSome sectors saw more impact than others. Universities and nonprofit healthcare organizations that have historically recruited professors and medical workers from abroad have largely stopped filing petitions subject to the fee, Chiappari said. Unlike for-profit companies, these institutions can hire H-1B workers throughout the year without going through the annual lottery.\n\n\"That pipeline is now dried up,\" Chiappari said.\n\nRather than abandoning H-1B sponsorship, companies are exploring alternative pathways and backup strategies.\n\nSrinivasa said interest in O-1 visas for workers with \"extraordinary ability\" has surged, though not everyone qualifies. To qualify, applicants typically need to demonstrate a track record of impact and achievements in their field as evidenced by patents, awards, membership in select associations, and media coverage about them.\n\nSome founders from countries with US trade treaties are turning to E-2 investor visas, which also provide work authorization for spouses. Others are using the EB-1C path, where companies send managers abroad for a year before bringing them back to the US.\n\nCompanies are also increasingly establishing international offices and using L-1 visas to transfer employees to the US, or opting for services like Deel and Rippling that serve as the official employer, handling immigration paperwork on behalf of client companies.\n\nBig Tech, as well as Wall Street firms such as JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs, have been expanding their operations in Indian cities like Bengaluru and Hyderabad.\n\nKishore said some clients are preemptively reaching out to offshore providers to ramp up staffing capacity in case they are unable to bring workers to the US as planned.\n\n\"If they can't spend that same hundred dollars within the US next year, they will spend a hundred dollars outside the US,\" he added.\n\nStarting with the 2026 lottery, visa applications will be weighted based on salary level. Workers offered the highest wages will get four entries in the lottery, while those at the lowest tier get just one. The administration says this will ensure visas are awarded to the most skilled workers.\n\nRaleigh said companies are already thinking about how this will affect their recruitment strategy, \"without the exact terms of how those rules are going to work.\"\n\nThe change will likely benefit large tech companies that can afford to place workers in top salary bands, while creating challenges for smaller companies, nonprofits, and early-stage startups.\n\n\"Often the best startup founders forgo being paid a living wage because they're so dedicated to the mission,\" said Sophie Alcorn, a Bay Area immigration attorney who focuses on startups and entrepreneurs. \"Those same startups may be the ones that have the most difficulty in getting the right people through this future system.\"\n\nKishore said that a higher salary doesn't always mean more skill. A first-year associate at a major law firm might make $225,000, while an equally qualified associate at a smaller firm makes significantly less. Under the new system, the big-firm lawyer would have much better lottery chances, he said.\n\nSome attorneys are advising clients not to artificially inflate salaries to game the system. Chiappari said the spread between wage levels is typically $20,000 to $30,000 — far less than the $100,000 fee — and companies aren't rushing to increase compensation anyway.\n\nImmigration attorneys previously thought that the $100,000 fee might improve the chances for foreign students already studying in the US by increasing their chances if fewer companies enter candidates in the lottery. Now, the wage-based lottery means that it might not happen.\n\n\"That logic's been turned on its head,\" said Kishore, adding that students, who typically enter the workforce at lower salaries, will get fewer chances at the lottery.\n\nBeyond policy changes, companies are also recalibrating their compliance strategies to avoid triggering fees or violating new rules.\n\nRaleigh said that ensuring workers maintain valid immigration status has become even more critical, as any lapse could force someone to leave the country and return on a new H-1B visa, potentially triggering the $10,000 fee.\n\nCompanies are updating their HR policies, including guidance on social media presence for foreign hires, in response to new vetting requirements, Srinivasa said. Some are advising employees to avoid international travel altogether, even when technically permitted.\n\nChiappari said he still gets constant questions from worried H-1B holders about whether it's safe to travel internationally.\n\n\"Even if I write a three-page affidavit explaining how they're not going to have any trouble coming back to the United States, they're just not going to believe it, and they're staying here,\" Chiappari said. \"They're just not traveling.\"\n\nThe human cost is real: postponed weddings, skipped vacations, and delayed work travel.\n\n\"Employers,\" Kishore said, \"need to be prepared and agile for what's coming in the next few months.\"",

    "description": "Joshua Nelken-Zitser, a senior reporter at Business Insider,  balanced his job with writing his first book. Consistency and celebrating small wins were key.",
    "fullText": "When I got my book deal with HarperCollins UK, I was thrilled that a childhood dream of becoming an author was coming true.\n\nThen, reality hit. I had less than a year to research and write an 80,000-word book.\n\nI had never taken on anything this big before, and certainly not alongside a full-time job. The prospect of juggling a 9-to-5 as a journalist with such a time-consuming passion project felt terrifying.\n\nBut by being intentional with my time and relying on a few key productivity habits, I've ended up with a book I'm proud of, all without losing sleep.\n\nI asked a couple of author friends how they balanced their day job with writing a book. One said he wrote in the twilight hours; the other woke up at the crack of dawn.\n\nI also looked for clues from people I interviewed at work, like 21-year-old Nathaneo Johnson, who ran a startup while studying at Yale and told me he often put in 18-hour days.\n\nIt became clear they found time for their passion projects by eating into their sleep. But sacrificing precious shut-eye was not something I was prepared to do.\n\nWhile some people are able to get by on less than the recommended seven to nine hours of sleep, I'm not wired that way. When I'm sleep-deprived, I am not my best self, nor my second or third best. I tend to get grouchy, lose focus more easily, and become more prone to getting sick.\n\nIf sleep was non-negotiable, I knew that I needed to carve out time elsewhere.\n\nMy free hours after finishing work and at weekends seemed like the most obvious place to claw back some time to write my book. Normally, those slots would be filled with episodes of \"Below Deck,\" reading fiction, or meals with friends.\n\nI worked out that freeing up roughly two hours on workdays and a sensible eight hours on weekends, by cutting down on my favourite activities for almost a year, would be manageable. Although it doesn't sound like much, the hours add up.\n\nOver a month, it would give me more than 100 hours to work with.\nAcross the eleven months between signing my deal and my deadline, that would come to almost 1,000 potential hours — the equivalent of 45 straight days of work without sleep.\n\nI didn't know how many hours it would take to finish my book, but the math showed that the workload would be feasible if I chipped away at it steadily, rather than cramming the writing into an impossible final stretch.\n\nIn the end, I doubt I racked up anywhere close to 1,000 hours (I took days off to relax, socialize, and vacation), yet I still managed to finish my first draft several weeks ahead of schedule.\n\nWhile writing a book is a creative process, I approached my schedule with scientific precision.\n\nI built a basic Google Sheet template to track my progress and created a formula that took into account my total word count target and the number of days I had left. This gave me a total number of words I needed to write each day to stay on track. I updated it after every writing session.\n\nWatching the total word count climb and the daily target shrink gamified the process, which was both motivating and reassuring. It also helped me judge when I was ahead of schedule and could therefore say \"yes\" to social plans.\n\nI saw how my incremental efforts were adding up. Consistency, I learned early on, was the only way to tackle such a project.\n\nI didn't follow my schedule perfectly: there were impromptu reporting trips, days I was too exhausted to work, and social plans I didn't want to turn down. But being consistent on average gave me enough wiggle room that these interruptions didn't derail my entire schedule.\n\nThroughout the process, I tried not to become a recluse. I didn't want to lose friends or my sanity along the way, so I made sure to have at least one thing each week to look forward to, whether it was hanging out with family or simply taking a long walk and enjoying a chai latte with friends.\n\nMarking milestones mattered, too. At a third, halfway, and two-thirds of the book, my husband and I either went out for dinner or popped open a bottle of Prosecco. And when I finally handed in my manuscript, we went on vacation.\n\nCelebrating the small wins gave me concrete, near-term rewards to work toward, which kept me motivated and protected my mental health. I locked in time for the gym, where I'd watch reality TV on the elliptical, to make sure that I was staying happy and healthy.\n\nI tried to adopt a \"work smart, not hard\" mindset, occasionally using online tools to make my life easier. Instead of wasting time formatting or tidying my chaotic notes, I'd prompt ChatGPT to turn them into clear, bullet-point summaries. I also used AI transcription software to write up interviews.\n\nSimple shortcuts like these saved me from tedious admin and freed up time for the stuff that actually mattered, like research and writing.\n\nI didn't get everything right. Some days I was well ahead of schedule, but pushed myself to work anyway, out of guilt for feeling lazy. A couple of times that brought me close to burnout and forced me to take a few days off from writing to recuperate. I should have listened to my body and paced myself.\n\nI also recognize that I had some advantages: I don't have kids or other caregiving responsibilities, my husband kindly took on more than his fair share of household chores, and my workplace allowed me a short period of unpaid leave to focus on my book.\n\nStill, being intentional with my time made juggling a full-time job and a book far more manageable than I could have ever imagined.\n\nI learned that I didn't need to sacrifice sleep to live out a lifelong dream, as long as I used my waking hours wisely.\n\nNow, with all that work behind me. I can simply look forward to Trauma Bonds being published in January 2027.",

    "fullText": "Indiana's Curt Cignetti scoffs at idea of bye week favoritism before Rose Bowl vs. Alabama originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nIndiana Hoosiers coach Curt Cignetti doesn't make the rules regarding the College Football Playoff. He just plays by them.\n\nThe Hoosiers earned the No. 1 seed in the 12-team field after beating the Ohio State Buckeyes in the Big Ten title game Dec. 6 in Indianapolis, which guaranteed the defending national champions wouldn't finish the season undefeated regardless of when it ends.\n\nGiven the Hoosiers' recent football history, a bye week is uncharted waters for Cignetti. But it's nothing his team can't handle, he told reporters Monday.\n\n“Would I prefer to play earlier? Yeah, I probably would, to be quite honest with you. But that’s not the case, so,\" Cignetti said. “We’re excited about playing. We’re off to a good start. And, it’ll be a tremendous challenge.”\n\nWith the Crimson Tide's road win against the Oklahoma Sooners this past Friday, Cignetti said Indiana didn't feel pressure to take its foot off the gas even though the result (an eventual 34-24 slugfest) was unknown.\n\n\"Well, you know, it is what it is, so you make the most of it,” Cignetti said. “The way we approached it until we knew the opponent? We treated it like two bye weeks, and now we have almost two weeks to prepare for the opponent.”\n\nThe game will likely come down to whoever is the most efficient quarterback between Fernando Mendoza and Ty Simpson, which should make for a potentially thrilling shootout in Pasadena, Calif.\n\nKickoff is set for 4 p.m. ET, as the winner extends the season.",

    "description": "President Trump’s trade policy, inflation and climbing stock prices shaped business and the economy this year.",
    "fullText": "In recent years, macroeconomic tides have ebbed and flowed, but one thing has remained unchanged: Americans’ dim views of the economy.\n\nIn 2023, pundits warned of the “vibecession.” In 2024, concerns about the economy and inflation were top of mind for voters in the presidential race.\n\nThis year, economic pessimism has persisted, as President Trump’s sweeping economic proposals, from his wide-ranging tariffs to his plan to remake the Federal Reserve, have raised uncertainty to new highs. And the economic data is sending mixed, and muddled, signals.\n\nHere are 14 charts that illustrate how uncertainty has unfolded in the economy and markets over the last year, and how it might affect the next.\n\nPresident Trump’s trade war has been one of the biggest sources of economic uncertainty this year. During his campaign, Trump repeatedly cited tariffs as a way to spur American manufacturing, create new jobs and lower U.S. trade deficits.\n\nNearly every country has seen import duties rise.\n\nThe tariffs have made progress toward some of the administration’s stated goals: They have brought the trade deficit down, as exports grew more than imports.\n\nAnd they have made money: Tariff revenues are now at record highs.\n\nBut there is another kind of deficit on investors’ minds: the federal budget deficit. Tariff revenues remain a small share of total government revenues.\n\nHere’s another way in which the effects of tariffs are showing up: higher prices for goods.\n\nConsumer prices started to accelerate in June, and the prices of products most exposed to tariffs notched some of the highest gains.\n\nAnd in recent months, prices for goods continued to rise, contributing more to inflation.\n\nInflation unexpectedly slowed to 2.7 percent in November, according to data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics this week. But economists have advised taking this data with a grain of salt, because of disruptions in the bureau’s data collection efforts during the 43-day federal government shutdown.\n\nIt’s still unclear whether tariffs will cause just a temporary increase in prices or if they will feed into more persistent inflation.\n\nAt this month’s DealBook Summit, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent pushed back against the notion that tariffs had contributed to inflation, saying that they had caused a “one-time price adjustment,” not a “generalized price increase.”\n\nThe chair of the Federal Reserve, Jerome H. Powell, has also said that the Fed expected tariffs to cause a “one-time shift in the price level.” But he has stressed that the increase could be drawn out over several quarters. And at a news conference after last week’s Fed meeting he acknowledged the risk of tariff inflation becoming “more and more persistent.”\n\nIn the first full jobs report since the federal shutdown, the B.L.S. reported that the unemployment rate rose to 4.6 percent last month, a four-year high. Wage growth slowed to its lowest level since 2021. As with inflation, the shutdown affected the data collection for these measures, and the agency said ahead of the release that its estimates of the unemployment rate and other measures would be subject to more uncertainty than usual.\n\nThe average job gain over the last three months\n\nThe average job gain over the last three months\n\nThere was a silver lining: Employers added 64,000 jobs in November, driven largely by gains in the health care sector. But that only partly offset a decline in October.\n\nThe federal government shed 168,000 jobs in October and November, as workers who accepted the Trump administration’s “deferred resignation” offer came off the payroll.\n\nAnd the jobs numbers do not reflect a big downward revision that is expected early next year.\n\n(Revisions to jobs figures are commonplace, but they dominated headlines earlier this year when downward adjustments led Trump to fire the commissioner of the B.L.S., Erika McEntarfer, claiming, without evidence, that the data was “rigged.”)\n\nThe lowest-paid workers have felt the strain of the cooling labor market the most. As the economy started to recover from the pandemic, demand for labor far outstripped supply in the lowest-paid industries, such as leisure and hospitality.\n\nToday, that is no longer the case, and hourly wages are rising most slowly for the lowest earners.\n\nLast year, voters consistently told pollsters that they trusted Donald Trump over Joe Biden and later, Kamala Harris, to do a better job on the economy.\n\nNow, Trump is the one feeling the pressure, as views of his handling of the economy have soured since the summer.\n\nThe risks posed by inflation and a softening labor market have also put the Fed in a tough position. Last week, the central bank decided to cut interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point for a third meeting in a row. But the decision was highly contentious, with three of 12 policymakers voting against it.\n\nPowell said he could have made the case either way for the Fed to cut interest rates or pause reductions, given the competing risks to unemployment and inflation.\n\n“You’ve got one tool,” he said. “You can’t do two things at once.”\n\nTrump, for his part, has made no secret of his desire for lower rates. Next year, he will select a new Fed chair.\n\nAfter a dip earlier this year, most notably amid the chaotic “Liberation Day” tariff rollout, the stock market has, on the whole, kept on going up. The S&P 500 reached a record high just last week, for the 37th time this year.\n\nArguably, company earnings, and their expectations for earnings are the most important factor driving the market movements.\n\nIn fact, earnings expectations have moved in tandem with the S&P 500 price index over the course of this year (again, with the exception of the early months of the year).\n\nOf course, the S&P 500 is driven in large part by big tech companies, which are intertwined with the A.I. boom.\n\nThat has been cause for concern for some investors, who see a parallel between this moment and the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s and early 2000s. But unlike companies leading the stock rally during the dot-com bubble, the public companies with the steepest valuation gains today are earning more as the market goes up.\n\nThe outlook for earnings continues to be bullish in 2026, though there could be weak links in the A.I. chain.\n\nThe crypto boom that Trump’s re-election ushered in is on pause for now.\n\nAfter surging for most of the year, the price of Bitcoin and Ether, along with dozens of other coins, started to plummet on Oct. 10, following Trump’s announcement that he would impose a new tariff on China.\n\n(The stock market on that day also saw the biggest one-day plunge since April, though it has since rebounded and hit a record high.)\n\nFor some, the crypto sell-off has underscored the fact that crypto remains a volatile investment, even as it has entered a new level of mainstream acceptance. Amid a high-stakes lobbying campaign by the crypto industry, Trump ended a regulatory crackdown on crypto and signed legislation outlining the first federal rules for stablecoins, digital tokens tied to assets like the U.S. dollar.\n\nOthers worry that a crypto crash could bleed over to the wider market.\n\nAmid all this uncertainty, people might be looking to pop culture as a form of escape. They haven’t necessarily been finding it at the movies, if ticket sales are any indication.\n\nSummer is a crucial season for Hollywood, accounting for the lion’s share of annual box office revenue. This year, fantasies, science-fiction sequels and superhero flicks were on offer. But moviegoers, for the most part, didn’t bite: It was the worst summer for domestic ticket sales since 1981, after adjusting for inflation and excluding the pandemic years.\n\nThe fall was filled with star-studded flicks, but none of them constituted box office hits.\n\nCan the holiday season help Hollywood make a comeback? “Zootopia 2” and “Wicked: For Good” have gotten it off to a good start.\n\nBut broader concerns abound. Warner Bros. Discovery has struck a deal with Netflix for the Warner Bros. studio and its sibling streaming service, HBO Max, while it has fended off, for the time being, a hostile takeover offer from Paramount.\n\nRegardless of how it all ends, it feels like a moment of loss for cinephiles. Corporate consolidation, after all, is not likely to bode well for the future of the Silver Screen.",

    "description": "Jane Newman says it's been easy to meet new people in Seoul, including through a fan group for a Korean actor she likes.",
    "fullText": "Jane Newman spent her evenings watching K-dramas on her recliner during the pandemic lockdowns. She didn't expect they'd spark a curiosity about South Korea that would eventually lead her to move there and start over.\n\nIn 2023, Newman was working for a consulting firm in Brisbane, Australia. As a manager, her heavy workload didn't let up even as the world began to return to normal.\n\nAfter months of long hours spent in front of a screen, she was burned out and beginning to feel the strain.\n\n\"I started out with a whole lot of shoulder and back pain, and then it developed into arm pain, and I couldn't use my mouse,\" Newman, now 60, told Business Insider.\n\nStanding desks and different chairs fixed little, so she took a sabbatical.\n\nNewman had first visited South Korea the previous year, curious about the country she'd only seen on TV. Remembering how much she had enjoyed that trip, she decided to return for a two-month break.\n\nWhen she went back to work, the symptoms didn't take long to resurface. This time, Newman found herself struggling mentally and emotionally, too.\n\n\"I found it more and more difficult to do my work,\" she said. By July 2024, she and her employer agreed it was best for her to step away from the company.\n\n\"I knew that South Korea was a place that I loved, and it made me feel good,\" Newman said. \"So I made the decision to go back and stay for a few months to see how it felt.\"\n\nFor three months, she lived in an Airbnb in Gwacheon, a city just outside Seoul. Newman lived with her host, a local woman who had invited her to participate in the community events.\n\nThere, she joined a group supporting former US military \"comfort women,\" as well as two English clubs where members met to discuss news, read English fiction together, and give weekly presentations on various topics.\n\n\"I met the most wonderful people, and they really invited me into their conversations. And I got to know a lot more about Korea itself, and its history,\" she said.\n\n\"All of those things made me feel really welcomed, and at home, and part of a community, which is what I was really lacking back in Australia,\" Newman added.\n\nIn Brisbane, her social life largely revolved around people she knew at work, or old friends she'd kept in touch with from her years living in the UK when her daughters were young. She was part of a bushwalking community and a social dining community, but most of those groups faded after the pandemic.\n\nAs Newman considered her next career steps, she found herself drawn toward public speaking and coaching to help people navigate the pressures of modern society and technology.\n\nThat focus also eventually led her to begin developing a tech startup in South Korea aimed at helping young people struggling with social isolation.\n\nShe said her Gen Z daughters weren't surprised by her decision since they already knew how much she loved South Korea. Both had already taken trips to visit her there.\n\nWhen it was time for Newman to look for an apartment, she wanted a place that was close to public transport, with separate spaces for living and sleeping, and a good view.\n\nIt took her about two weeks to find a place. She now lives in Dongdaemun, a popular neighborhood, where her two-bedroom apartment costs 1.43 million Korean won, or about $1,000, a month.\n\nSouth Korea has become an increasingly popular choice for foreigners in recent years.\n\nData from the Ministry of Justice showed that the number of foreigners living in South Korea at the end of 2024 stood at 2.65 million, a 5.7% increase from the year before.\n\nFor Newman, building friendships in Seoul came more naturally than she expected.\n\n\"I've found that every time I've come to Korea, I've made new friends,\" Newman said, adding that this included people she met through a fan group for a Korean actor she admired.\n\nThese days, Newman's routine is a mix of work and settling into life in Seoul.\n\nShe starts her mornings with a coffee from the Starbucks across the street before diving into her coaching sessions and working on getting her startup off the ground.\n\nCompared to her previous job, where working 60 hours a week was common, Newman says she now works around 20 to 30 hours a week.\n\nWith the more flexible schedule, she has time to exercise, meet people, and sometimes work from libraries or cafés.\n\n\"But I do make sure I get out once a day to go out and enjoy this beautiful place I'm living in,\" she said.\n\nDo you have a story to share about relocating to a new city?

    "description": "The trading card business is so big, the ecosystem has created specialized markets within it. Collectors can chase a specific team, or stick to vintage cards, among other options.",
    "fullText": "Trading sports cards is a game of negotiation for Greg Petikyan. Within seconds, he talked to multiple vendors at Frank and Son Collectible Show last month offering the same card: a 2025 Panini Donruss Saquon Barkley Downtown.\n\nThe first deal consisted of a 3-for-1 exchange, with an additional couple of hundred dollars to sweeten the deal or a straight purchase for $460. As the vendor looked through his phone for the value of the cards he asked for, Petikyan told him he’ll circle back.\n\nInstead, the entrepreneur offered it to Eric Mitchel, another booth owner, across the aisle and sold it. A rectangular cardboard collectible with the Super Bowl-winning running back in front of the Philadelphia skyline sold for $300.\n\n“Too late,” Petikyan said. “I’ll still buy those cards I asked for.”\n\nNothing personal, just business.\n\nTrading and collecting cards, an industry valued at $14.9 billion in 2024, is estimated to reach $52.1 billion within the next decade, according to Market Decipher report. The sports memorabilia business, as a whole, is estimated to reach a value of $271.2 billion by 2034.\n\nE-commerce platforms like Fanatics Live and Whatnot have turned business transactions involving the cards of sports legends into entertainment and helped grow the market. Heritage Auctions sold the most expensive card in August. The collectible known as the \"holy grail\" by basketball collectors was a 2007-08 Upper Deck Exquisite Collection Dual Logoman Autographs Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant card.\n\nThe one-of-one sold for $12.932 million, a sum that topped a Mickey Mantle card that went for $12.6 million in August 2022. The Jordan-Bryant card is the second-most expensive sports collectible of all time, trailing Babe Ruth's 1932 World Series Jersey, which he wore when he called his shot, that cost $24.12 million.\n\nLast Friday, Heritage Auctions set a sales record for the year by crossing the $2 billion mark. The cards sold that day included a 2003 Upper Deck Exquisite Collection Dual Logoman Jordan-Bryant card for $3,172,000 — this one was not autographed.\n\nThe trading card business has grown so much, the ecosystem has created specialized markets within it. Collectors can chase a specific team; stick to vintage cards; complete a set of prints with mistakes; chase specific relics of their favorite team; or even just buy cards to resell them for the sole purpose of buying more to flip.\n\n\"I know for a fact, a lot of men like to show off their collection,\" Adam Campbell, sports cards specialist with Heritage Auction, said. \"People love to have good, cool collections,\" he added.\n\nThe type of chase can change the direction of a business transaction, said George Peña, 53, another booth owner at Frank and Son, an old Sam's Club that now houses more than 200 vendors selling and showcasing collectible merchandise three days a week.\n\nKids go into his booth and negotiate with him. Most of the time he doesn’t necessarily need a card from them but engages with them to give them the experience.\n\n“Family members get all excited for them,” Peña said.\n\nBut when dealing with people like Petikyan, the stakes change.\n\n“Negotiations are a little different with those kinds of people because they want to make money and we want to make money,” he said as he quipped with Petikyan.\n\nSome collectors have turned into investors because the value of cards is so volatile. It changes in real time — it's fast, unpredictable and relentless. The moment Dodgers designated hitter and pitcher Shohei Ohtani hit three home runs and struck out 10 batters in Game 4 of the 2025 NLCS, the value of his cards went up. But it cuts both ways — the moment Cleveland Guardians pitcher Emmanuel Clase was indicted on federal charges for wire fraud conspiracy and bribery, the value of his cards dipped.\n\n“The value of cards is not based on anything else, whatsoever, except for hype and buzz” Campbell said. “[It's] entirely arbitrary.”\n\nCollecting trading cards has been a part of the culture since Goodwin Tobacco Company released the first set of individual players’ baseball cards in 1886. The N167 Old Judge sets were inserted into tiny cigarette boxes to increase sales and to make sure the cards were not damaged in transit.\n\nSince the tobacco industry started the trade, sports cards have endured changes through generations, each defined by specific characteristics.\n\nThe vintage era, before the 1980s, ushered in simpler designs, lower print runs and sets featuring the legends of all the sports. Then came the junk wax period, marked by mass overproduction that devalued the product. The current ultra modern era evolved the market into investments, scarcity, and digitized the business with websites like Arena Club, which repackages pre-graded cards as slab packs.\n\nNo matter the changes, there remains a common thread within collectors throughout the years: opening packages and feeling a bump of euphoria when a chase card, a sought-after item, appears.\n\n“It’s the best feeling ever, imagine getting a $1,000 card for like 20, 30 bucks?” Petikyan said. “It’s like hitting a lotto ticket, but better, because it could go up in value depending on the player.”\n\nPetikyan, 27 from Montebello, runs a page called Strictly Pullz on the shopping app Whatnot where he opens boxes and auctions the items within them. Any card pulled from a team that's purchased by the individual will be shipped to them. On occasion, he inserts a card with higher value to hype a specific set.\n\nTo some, the business is intertwined with collecting.\n\n“I’ll use some of the money that I am able to make on the business side, to add to my personal collection,” Mitchel said. “Finding items for the personal collection, I wouldn’t find if I wasn’t out for the business part of it.”\n\nRegardless of motivation, pulling a card worth more than the price paid for will remain priceless.\n\n“I just bought a pack and I pulled a card worth $1,000,” Campbell said, speaking as a collector. “It can change your whole day, and maybe your whole week, maybe a whole month or even a whole year every time you open a pack.”\n\nBut, collecting cards is more than just the value of each, Campbell said.\n\n“Do this because you like sports, do this because you love collecting.”\n\nGet the best, most interesting and strangest stories of the day from the L.A. sports scene and beyond from our newsletter The Sports Report.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "fullText": "Conor McDermott-Mostowy would like to compete at the Milano Cortina Winter Olympic Games. And he certainly has the talent, desire and ambition to do so.\n\n“You could definitely reach six figures,” David McFarland, McDermott-Mostowy’s agent, said of what the speedskater needs annually to live and train while chasing his Olympic dream.\n\nIn the last year, finding that money has been increasingly difficult because McDermott-Mostowy is gay. Since President Trump returned to the White House in January, bringing with him an agenda that is hostile to diversity, equity and inclusion, sponsors who once embraced LGBTQ+ athletes and initiatives have turned away from the likes of McDermott-Mostowy, with devastating effect.\n\n“There’s definitely been a noticeable shift,” said McFarland, who for decades has represented straight and gay athletes in a number of sports, from the NFL and NBA to professional soccer. “Many brands and speaking opportunities that previously highlighted LGBTQ athletes are now being pulled back or completely going away.”\n\n“And these aren’t just symbolic partnerships,” he added. “They’re vital income opportunities that help athletes fund training, fund their competition and their livelihoods.”\n\nThe impact is being felt across a wide range of sports where sponsorship dollars often make the difference between winning and not being able to compete. But it’s especially acute in individual sports where the athletes are the brand and their unique traits — their size, appearance, achievements and even their gender preferences — become the things that attract or repel fans and financial backers.\n\n“What’s most frustrating is that these decisions are rarely about performance,” McFarland said. “They’re about perceptions in the LGBTQ community. And that kind of fear-driven retreat harms everyone involved because, beyond the human costs, it’s also very short-sighted. The LGBTQ community and its allies represent a multitrillion-dollar global market with immense buying power.”\n\nTravis Shumake, the only openly gay driver on the NHRA circuit, ran a career-high five events in 2022 and said he once had deals with major brands such as Mission Foods, Procter & Gamble and Kroger while using a rainbow-colored parachute to slow his dragster.\n\nKroger is the only one whose support has yet to shrink and as a result, Shumake had to keep his car in its trailer for the final eight months of the year.\n\nAnd when he did race, his parachute was black.\n\n“It was looking very optimistic and bright,” said Shumake, who spends about $60,000 for an engine and as much as $25,000 for each run down the dragstrip. “Being the only LGBTQ driver would have been very profitable. I ended last season with plans to run six to eight races. Great conversations were happening with big, big companies. And now it’s, I did one race, completely based on funding.”\n\n“When you’re asking for a $100,000 check,” he added, “it’s very tough for these brands to take that risk for a weekend when there could be a large backlash because of my sexual identity.”\n\nA sponsorship manager for a Fortune 500 company that had previously backed Shumake said he was not authorized to discuss the decision to end its relationship with the driver.\n\nDaniel T. Durbin, director of the Institute of Sports, Media and Society at the USC Annenberg school, said there could be several reasons for that. A shrinking economy has tightened sponsorship budgets, for example. But there’s no doubt the messaging from the White House has had a chilling effect.\n\n“It certainly makes the atmosphere around the issue more difficult because advertising and promotion tied to social change has come under fire by the Trump administration,” Durbin said.\n\nIn addition, corporate sponsors that once rallied behind diversity, whether out of conviction or convenience, saw the election results partly as a repudiation of that.\n\n“We may be pissing off 50% of the population if we go down this path. Do we really want to do that with our brand?” Durbin said of the conversations corporations are having.\n\nBacking away from causes such as LGBTQ+ rights doesn’t necessarily mean those corporations were once progressive and are now hypocritical. For many, the only color of the rainbow they care about is green.\n\n“You’re trying to give people a philosophy who don’t have a philosophy,” Durbin said. “And even if they believe in causes, they’re not going to self-destruct their company by taking up a cause they believe in. They’re going to take it up in part because they think it’s positive for the bottom line.\n\nAs a result, others have had to step up to try to help fill the funding gap. The Out Athlete Fund, a 501(c)(3) organization, was recently created to provide financial assistance and other support to LGBTQ+ athletes. McDermott-Mostowy was the first to get a check, after a November event in West Hollywood raised more than $15,000.\n\n“We’re here to help cover their costs because a lot of other people aren’t doing it,” said Cyd Zeigler, a founding board member of the group and co-founder of OutSports, a sports-news website focused on LGBTQ+ issues.\n\nThat kind of retrenching, from deep-pocketed corporate sponsors to individuals giving their spare change, is threatening to derail the careers of athletes  such as McDermott-Mostowy, who relies on his family and a modest U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Committee stipend for most of his living and training expenses. And since he’ll turn 27 before the Milano Cortina Olympic Games open in February, he may not be able to wait for the pendulum to swing back to have another chance at being an Olympian.\n\n“I’m 99% sure I qualify for [food] stamps,” said McDermott-Mostowy, who medaled in the 1,500- and 500-meter events in October’s national championships, making him a strong contender for the U.S. heading into the Olympic long track trials Jan. 2-5 in Milwaukee. “What really saves us every year is when we travel. Almost all of our expenses are paid when we’re coming [with] the team.\n\n“If I didn’t make the World Cup one year, I would be ruined.”\n\nMcDermott-Mostowy’s past success and his Olympic potential are what he pitches to sponsors, not that he’s gay. But that’s what makes him stand out; if he qualifies for Milano Cortina, he would be one of the few gay athletes on the U.S. team.\n\n“I have always been very open about my sexuality. So that wasn’t really a debate,” he said.\n\n“I have definitely heard from my agent that, behind closed doors, a lot of people are like ‘Oh, we’d love to support queer athletes. But it’s just not a good time to be having that as our public face.'”\n\nThe debate isn’t a new one, although it has evolved over the years. Figure skater Amber Glenn, who last year became the first out queer woman to win the U.S. championship, remembers gender preferences being a big topic of discussion ahead of the 2014 Games in Russia, where public support for LGBTQ+ expression is banned.\n\n“At that point I wasn’t out, but I was thinking, ‘What would I do? What would I say?’” Glenn said. “Moving forward I hope that we can make it where people can compete as who they are and not have to worry about anything.\n\n“Figure skating is unique. We have more acceptance and more of a community in the queer space. That’s not the case for all sports. We’re definitely making progress, but we still have a long way to go.”\n\nIn the meantime, athletes such as McDermott-Mostowy and Shumake may have to find ways to re-present themselves to find new sources of support.\n\n“It’s not like I’m going back in the closet,” said Shumake, who has decided to rent out his dragster to straight drivers next year rather than leave it parked and face bankruptcy. “It’s just that maybe it’s not the main storyline at the moment. I’m trying a bunch of different ways to tell the story, to rebrand.”\n\n“It’s been weird to watch,” added Shumake, who once billed himself as the fastest gay guy on Earth. “I know it will swing back. I also fear, did I make the right choices when I had a partnership with Grindr and I had rainbow parachutes? Like did I come on too strong?\n\n“I’ve chosen to go the gay race car driver route and it’s just a little bit of a slowdown. I don’t think I need to blame myself. It’s just a fear people are having at the moment.”\n\nA fear that’s proving costly to the athletes who can least afford to pay.\n\nGet the best, most interesting and strangest stories of the day from the L.A. sports scene and beyond from our newsletter The Sports Report.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "description": "Xu Bo, the founder of one of China’s largest mobile gaming companies, is looking to have “50 high-quality sons” in the U.S. to take over his billion-dollar empire.",
    "fullText": "Billionaires like Telegram founder Pavel Durov and Tesla CEO Elon Musk have fathered legions of children who are slated to inherit their empires. Now, an ultra-wealthy Chinese businessman is doing the same in the U.S., in hopes of producing around 20 U.S.-born children to inherit his video game fortune.\n\nXu Bo is the founder and chairman of Guangzhou Duoyi Network: one of China’s largest mobile gaming companies. Despite the 48-year-old entrepreneur growing his company in Guangzhou, he’s not looking to pass down his $1.1 billion fortune to a child born in his home country. A Wall Street Journal investigation into Xu’s surrogacy history in the U.S. found that the Chinese billionaire was seeking parental rights to at least four unborn children, and had previously fathered and was actively fathering at least eight more surrogacy kids. There could be dozens more.\n\nThe billionaire’s video game company had also reportedly stated that Xu has more than 100 children born through surrogates based in the U.S., according to WSJ reporting. He was allegedly seeking “50 high-quality sons,” according to accounts linked to Xu on Chinese microblogging website Weibo, and said that “having more children can solve all problems.” During a 2023 court hearing, Xu also said he hoped to have around 20 U.S.-born children to one day take over his business, according to WSJ. He also fantasized about his American kids marrying Musk’s children in the future. Last month, Xu’s ex-girlfriend also alleged that he had 300 children living around the world—a claim his company denied.\n\nXu’s Duoyi Network has since made a statement against the Journal, stating the publication had “deliberately confused the facts and fabricated false information,” and that only 12 of the alleged 100-plus children were born in the U.S.\n\nXu is among a growing number of ultra-rich men parenting dozens of children to shepherd their companies and expand their legacies. And just like Xu, the video game billionaire, Telegram founder Pavel Durvo has helped conceive over 100 babies across 12 countries.\n\nOfficially, the entrepreneur worth $14.2 billion has six “official” children with three different partners. In addition to this parentage, Durov has also been donating to a sperm clinic for the past 15 years, which told him has led to more than 100 pregnancies.\n\n“I wrote my will very recently,” Durov told French publication Le Point in an interview this June. “I make no difference between my children: There are those who were conceived naturally and those who come from my sperm donations. They are all my children and will all have the same rights! I don’t want them to tear each other apart after my death.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

    "title": "Major food chains are reinventing themselves. We ranked their efforts to see who's winning the Great Restaurant Reset.",
    "description": "Many restaurant chains have been undergoing rebranding efforts this year. Business Insider ranked each effort in order of effectiveness.",
    "fullText": "It has been a big year for rebranding efforts among major restaurant chains.\n\nAs consumer tastes change — with value and experiential dining increasingly at the forefront — restaurant brands are seizing the moment to reinvent themselves: launching new logos, upgrading locations, and exploring new strategies to win over customers.\n\nBusiness Insider ranked each effort based on available financial performance and commentary from branding experts. Here's which rebrand is winning the Great Restaurant Reset so far.\n\nCracker Barrel launched a $700 million \"strategic transformation\" plan in 2025 aimed at updating stores, menus, and improving the brand's relevance.\n\nHowever, financial results showed essentially flat revenue in 2025 — a third straight sluggish year.\n\nThe most visible part of the refresh — its logo and brand redesign — backfired badly, with intense backlash forcing them to scrap the new logo. Management in September projected an 8% traffic drop for Q1 FY 2026, tied to the controversy.\n\nStock for Cracker Barrel was down more than 52% this year.\n\nOver the past year, Pizza Hut has quietly rolled out a refreshed logo and shaken up its menu and value strategy, launching new deals and limited-time items (like budget-friendly personal-pizza options) designed to win back customers amid sagging same-store sales.\n\nYum! Brands, the parent company of Pizza Hut, is openly exploring a sale of all or part of the brand — that's about as loud a vote of \"this turnaround isn't working yet\" as it gets.\n\nUS same-store sales and system sales have been in negative territory, facing a 5% drop in both Q1 and Q2, a 7% decline in Q3 at US locations, and its operating profit was down 8% in Q3.\n\nStock for Yum, which also includes other fast food titans like Taco Bell and KFC, was up more than 15% year-to-date.\n\nParent company Bloomin' Brands announced in November a $75 million, multi-year turnaround plan for Outback Steakhouse, aimed at restoring the chain to its steakhouse roots by improving food quality, updating its restaurants and service, and refining the overall guest experience.\n\nAs its rebrand effort is in its earliest stages, as tracked by Business Insider, it hasn't had the same runway that other brands have. Still, the chain has been struggling for two years, with the recent quarter showing only flat comparable store sales growth.\n\nAs part of a cost-cutting overhaul, they have abruptly closed 21 restaurants, with more closures planned.\n\nThere is a clear, funded strategy and some sequential improvement, but the brand is still closing units and lagging key steakhouse competitors, so the revitalization isn't yet taking root.\n\nBloomin' Brands' stock was down more than 46% year-to-date.\n\nDespite its long run as a growth darling, Chipotle logged two straight quarters of negative same-store sales in 2025 (Q1 and Q2), followed by a flat outlook for the rest of the year.\n\nManagement is repositioning itself around chicken, tweaking menu innovation and marketing, and opening new units at a rapid pace — a pragmatic, multi-front effort to adapt to a changing market.\n\nSo far, this approach appears to be buying time, but it hasn't yet produced a dramatic rebound; instead, it seems more like an attempt at stabilization, setting the stage for a potential recovery if consumer traffic returns.\n\nChipotle stock is down more than 37% year-to-date.\n\nSince emerging from bankruptcy in late 2024 under its new private-equity-backed owner, RL Investor Holdings, and new CEO Damola Adamolekun, Red Lobster has launched a leaner, value-driven, and experience-focused turnaround.\n\nThe overhaul includes ditching the \"Endless Shrimp\" all-you-can-eat deal, simplifying the menu, reviving fan favorites (like hush puppies and popcorn shrimp), and adding new dishes — including their viral seafood boils — to appeal to younger diners.\n\nAs the only private company on the list, Red Lobster's financial situation is murkier than the others ranked by Business Insider.\n\nHowever, foot traffic data from Placer.ai shows that the company's restaurants in June began seeing consistently positive trends in the monthly average visits per location for the first time in over 18 months. And, although its financial performance is still below 2023 levels, Consumer Edge credit and debit card data indicate that Red Lobster posted sales growth of 20% in 2025 Q3, and its average transaction size increased by 10% year-over-year, far outpacing the 1% growth seen for the overall casual dining sector.\n\nMike Perry, the founder of the creative agency Tavern, which has worked on rebranding efforts with companies including Budweiser and Burger King, told Business Insider that Red Lobster's rebranding effort lands squarely in the middle range: not as catastrophic as Cracker Barrel, but not as innovative as others like Starbucks.\n\n\"I think so far they've played it safe, like 'we'll clean it up, we'll package it up and resell it,' which, frankly, it's private equity money anyway, so they're doing the PE playbook appropriately, and it'll work for them, but it's not going to have staying power. It's certainly not going to make you an icon,\" Perry said.\n\nKFC launched its Kentucky Fried Comeback campaign in mid-July, as sales in recent years have been weak enough that the legacy chicken chain has lost share to competitors like Raising Cane's and Wingstop.\n\nRecent quarters have shown US same-store sales down around 5%, which has dragged down parent company Yum's results. Globally, though, KFC has strung together 11 consecutive quarters of same-store sales growth, with about 8% systemwide sales growth internationally.\n\n\"The category remains fiercely competitive, and a true comeback will ultimately require more substantial enhancements to its menu, marketing, and real estate strategies,\" R.J. Hottovy, head of analytical research at the location intelligence and foot traffic data software firm, Placer.ai, told Business Insider when KFC's comeback campaign launched.\n\nFor now, the US rebrand is clearly not \"fixed,\" but internationally the brand refresh is working, and the marketing reboot is resonating — so it ranks slightly above the chains that are still sliding across the board.\n\nUnder its new leadership, Starbucks launched the \"Back to Starbucks\" plan in late 2024, focusing on re-centering the company on its core identity as a neighborhood coffeehouse rather than a discount-driven chain.\n\nThe plan was intended to deliver 7-9% comparable store sales growth; instead, same-store sales remain under pressure, and the most recent updates indicate flat US comparable store sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025, and a modest uptick globally, with CEO Brian Niccol acknowledging it as a slow and steady recovery.\n\nWhile foot traffic and comps are not roaring back like Chili's, you can see the reinvention beginning to stabilize Starbucks' business. The scale of investment and early green shoots justify calling the turnaround moderately effective — especially versus peers that are still in full decline.\n\nStarbucks' stock was down more than 7% year-to-date as of December 24.\n\nApplebee's has rolled out a renovation and modernization program called its \"Lookin' Good\" program — updating the menu, remodeling dining rooms to update décor, modernizing interior design, and streamlining kitchens for off-premises and delivery business.\n\nAfter two years of declining traffic, Applebee's delivered a 4.9% same-store sales increase in Q2 2025, driven primarily by traffic growth — the first traffic increase in roughly two years.\n\nDine Brands credits the improvement to menu innovation as well as well-messaged value. The company is now focusing on a 2025 plan that emphasizes marketing and remodels to reinforce its brand repositioning.\n\nThe re-emphasis on \"neighborhood\" value and refreshed menus is clearly translating into positive comps and traffic — a textbook sign of an effective revitalization taking hold.\n\nStock for Dine Brands Global, Applebee's' parent company, is up more than 8% year-to-date.\n\nChili's, with its newly simplified menu, streamlined operations, and restaurant refurbishment, has become a case study in turnaround success. Early quarters in 2025 showed 31% same-store sales growth, propelled by a nearly 21% increase in traffic.\n\nAnalysts have called it one of the best turnarounds \"of all time\" in the casual dining sector, crediting a multi-year strategy focused on simplifying the menu, sharpening value, and operational execution, rather than relying on flashy stunts.\n\n\"If you look at what Chili's has done, its last two years have been maybe the most extraordinary thing I've seen in the business in 20 years,\" Restaurant Business editor in chief Jonathan Maze told Business Insider.\n\nChili's is the clearest example where a planned revitalization has delivered outsize traffic and sales gains, shifted category share, and won over both guests and Wall Street. On a pure rebrand effectiveness basis, it's the standout winner in recent memory.\n\nStock for Chili's parent company, Brinker International, was up more than 14% year-to-date as of December 19.",

    "description": "Justin Pines, the CEO of the Jewish Broadcasting Service, initially took a \"safe\" career path in corporate law, before becoming a rabbi.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Justin Pines, 42, the CEO of the Jewish Broadcasting Service, who lives in New Jersey. His education and former and current employment have been verified by Business Insider. This piece has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI always wanted my job to involve sharing Jewish ideas with a large audience, but I also felt I needed a safety net. So, I took the \"safe\" career path of becoming a corporate attorney.\n\nAfter about three years as an attorney, I left law to train as a rabbi. It led to me becoming the director of character development at a Jewish middle school, which I did for three years between 2016 and 2019.\n\nI loved it, but I pivoted again at 40 when I realized how hard it was to support my family that way. Now, I'm the CEO of the Jewish Broadcasting Service, a role that enables me to do what I'd always hoped.\n\nWith all of these changes, I learned about how to find a job that's the perfect fit.\n\nWhen I was 13, around the time of my Bar Mitzvah, I became very taken with Judaism. I started observing Shabbat and became interested in learning more about the religion. The more involved I became, the happier I felt.\n\nTo try to bring Judaism to the world, ideally through making movies, I studied communications for my undergraduate degree.\n\nToward the end of my degree, which I started in 2001, making it in Hollywood felt overwhelming and unrealistic. So, I went to Harvard Law School, deferring for a year to study at a Jewish educational institution in Israel. People assured me law school would set me up for any job I wanted.\n\nI began the program in 2006 and remember thinking a 30-year-old legal case in one of my first criminal law classes felt a little empty in comparison to the 2,000-year-old texts I had been reading, which felt divine and inspired.\n\nOverall, though, studying for my JD law degree was great. It made my brain feel super sharp, I made some amazing friends, and it set me up well for my legal career.\n\nDuring the summer of 2008, the year before I graduated from Harvard, I interned at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison. The company was full of excellent, smart, and kind people, so I accepted a full-time position that would start after I graduated.\n\nFrom 2009, I spent two years on rotation across different corporate departments at the firm. I had the opportunity to work on interesting projects and do some impactful pro bono work.\n\nIn the short term, it was great: I worked hard and played hard, could afford my own apartment in New York City, and liked my colleagues. But, I struggled with my long-term prospects.\n\nAs is the case at many corporate law firms, everything felt like an emergency, and partners would often receive work at the worst possible times, like on Friday afternoons or right before Thanksgiving weekend. It became clear that's what would be waiting for me if I ever made partner.\n\nI also had questions over whether it was meaningful work or the type of job where, no matter how senior you are, you'd be at the whim of others. I thought it might be time for something new.\n\nIn my third year at the law firm, when I was 29, I considered my career options. I made a chart with a list of six potential industries, including venture capital, real estate, Jewish non-profits, and becoming a rabbi. I interviewed people in each career about what their job was like and listed the pros and cons.\n\nI decided that more than anything else, I wanted to learn about Judaism. I was already studying the Talmud — the central text of Rabbinic Judaism — multiple times a week on the way to work. But I felt that I couldn't leave my high-paying job in law to study for the pursuit of knowledge and nothing more. I concluded that I needed another piece of paper, in addition to my BA and JD, which led me to a three-year vocational course at rabbinical school.\n\nAt the time, I thought I could make do with the significant pay cut I'd take if I became a rabbi.\n\nShortly after I became a rabbi at 33 in 2016, I became the head of character development at a Jewish middle school in New York's Upper East Side.\n\nIn a perfect world, I'd teach kids about Judaism all day, every day, forever. It breaks my heart to say, but it's hard to support a family doing that, and I have a wife and children.\n\nI wish educators were paid better, so more people felt inspired to get into the field. I have the utmost respect for those making it work, because it was a struggle. Personally, I needed a shift.\n\nAfter three years in Jewish education, I went to work at a Jewish think tank. Through that job, I was a guest on the Jewish Broadcasting Service, a broadcast network available through US TV providers and streaming services. In late 2023, they told me they were looking for a new CEO.\n\nI had studied communications at college, I wanted to share Judaism far and wide, and I had corporate experience: it felt like the role was the perfect fusion of my skills and interests. I joined as CEO at the start of 2024, at age 40.\n\nAt JBS, we broadcast shows that feature rabbis, artists, writers, and academics of all political and religious persuasions.\n\nI have a show where I typically interview leading Jewish thinkers. I can hardly believe it's my job to sit with my heroes for an hour, asking them whatever I want. I'm constantly pinching myself.\n\nPeople often treat their careers as ladders to climb rather than journeys with a North Star and lots to learn along the way. There was certainly a version of my life where I chose to stay in a lucrative career, in which I could have drawn meaning from things outside of work, like family or my volleyball team.\n\nFor much of my career, the challenge was achieving a balance between finding meaning, but not only from my job, and financial stability while doing something I love, among other things.\n\nI think I have found balance now. I feel blessed to love what I'm doing.",

    "description": "Tahmina Watson's law firm assists with employment visas. She advises all visa holders with a valid stamp to return to the US immediately.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Tahmina Watson, a business immigration lawyer in Seattle. Business Insider has verified Watson's employment history with documentation. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI'm a business immigration lawyer, and in my day-to-day work with clients, I'm seeing immigration disruptions with immediate consequences, including H-1B visa holders who are outside the US being uncertain if they can return.\n\n​​My law firm, Watson Immigration Law, assists founders and businesses in navigating the employment visa application process. It appears that, at this time, the administration is coordinating the rescheduling and delay of immigration appointments.\n\nNon-immigrant visas generally must be scheduled at a US embassy or consulate in the person's country of nationality or residence. From my experience, many employees accrue their holiday time and schedule immigration appointments during this period because they're already planning to leave the country, allowing them to easily visit their designated US embassy or consulate.\n\nThese employees are now getting stuck, having already left the US, with their appointments getting rescheduled for June, July, or August 2026, and beyond.\n\nMajor tech companies, including Google, Apple, and Microsoft, sent memos out to their employees in the past week, warning visa-holding employees to avoid international travel amid long delays at US consulates. These policies are coming one after another, and they all intersect with each other.\n\nIf somebody is outside the country, what are employers supposed to do? Right now, my advice to clients outside the country is that if they have a valid visa stamp, they should return to the US as soon as possible.\n\nFor someone who has left the country to obtain a new visa stamp, I'm not sure there's a clear path to return. This includes individuals on F-1 student visas who traveled to visit family and were planning to re-enter the US. They will need that visa stamp from a consulate.\n\nEnsure your employment is still active and consider whether remote work is an option. If an employer decides they cannot keep someone on the books, even an appointment months from now will not help if there's no job waiting.\n\nIt's tough to know how things will unfold. What we're seeing is a confluence of policies coming in at the same time. For example, the Department of Homeland Security has just announced that it is replacing the lottery system for H-1B work visas, which randomly selects who receives a visa. The system is now set to prioritize higher-paid, higher-skilled workers.\n\nSocial media disclosure is being expanded from F-1 visa holders, which began during the student visa crisis, to now include H-1B workers. These applicants are required to change all social media privacy settings to public.\n\nIt could easily expand to other visa categories. The government has not provided clear guidance on what they are reviewing. By casting an overly broad net under the banner of national security, without clear standards or transparency, the administration is creating uncertainty that will ripple across families, employers, and the US economy.\n\nClients should limit what they post online.\n\nIn 2024, I was already anticipating these issues with traveling and returning to the US. We've also seen issues affecting green card holders with past criminal convictions.\n\nThere are many stories of people who have lived in the US for decades, suddenly facing deportation proceedings. This is a highly precarious time for immigrants, and limiting travel is critical.\n\nIt feels like a fire hose of policies. Everyone in the immigrant ecosystem is on high alert: Immigration lawyers, immigrants, employers, investors, founders, and employees.",

    "description": "Larry and David Ellison didn’t always have a close relationship. Now they’re one of the most intriguing partnerships in business.",
    "fullText": "Theodore Schleifer writes about billionaires in America.\n\nWhen David Ellison became a teenager, his father, Larry, bought him a gift not usually bestowed on a 13th birthday: his own Katana stunt plane. The two had spent little meaningful time together. But with their own aircraft, the father and son could bond in the air, practicing aerobatic flips and ruling the skies together.\n\nNow, Larry Ellison is trying to help buy his son a media empire so they can rule Hollywood and news together.\n\nWhat was once a relatively weak father-and-son relationship has transformed into one of modern media’s most intriguing business partnerships. Towering behind almost every move made by David Ellison, now 42 and the chief executive of Paramount, is his swaggering 81-year-old father, the billionaire co-founder of the software giant Oracle.\n\nThe two have formed an unusual tag team in their pursuit of major media deals, according to more than two dozen people with knowledge of their interactions. They bought Paramount this summer, and now they are hunting Warner Bros. Discovery with a $108 billion hostile bid.\n\nOn Monday, David Ellison made it clearer than ever that his father is the centerpiece of this bid, telling Warner Bros. that Larry Ellison personally guaranteed $40.4 billion for Paramount’s offer. David Ellison has referred to the deal as something “we” — or “the Ellison family” — were pursuing. Both have sought to arm-twist Warner executives.\n\nFather and son speak about five times a week — sometimes about their tennis matches or their joint philanthropy at the University of Oxford. But these days, often the topic is deal-making. David Ellison consults his father at length on every deal-related decision, one person with knowledge of their interactions said.\n\nThey discuss how to navigate President Trump, whose administration must approve any major acquisition. Larry Ellison has taken the lead in making the case to the president for why Paramount and not Netflix, its rival bidder, should win control of Warner Bros., two of the people said. Mr. Trump has pledged to be “involved” in any decision about whether to approve a deal.\n\nA Silicon Valley celebrity for decades, Mr. Ellison co-founded Oracle five decades ago and turned it into a $252 billion personal fortune. He has been deferential to his son on this year’s deal talks, a person close to the process said.\n\nWhen talking about the hostile bid for Warner Bros., he has often referred to his history of hostile acquisitions during the 1990s and 2000s, two people with knowledge of the discussions said. His son, who interned at Oracle for two summers during that time, watched him work through some deals, the people said.\n\nIf the Ellisons prevail, their business empire could range from CNN to Warner Bros. to TikTok. That could have enormous consequences for the news and entertainment industries, perhaps making the Ellisons as influential as the Murdochs, whose media dynasty operates Fox News, The Wall Street Journal and other major outlets.\n\nMr. Trump has privately said Larry Ellison assured him that he would turn CBS News, which the Ellisons took over when they bought Paramount, into a more conservative outlet, two people with knowledge of the president’s comments said.\n\nOn Sunday night, a “60 Minutes” correspondent accused David Ellison’s handpicked editor in chief of CBS News, Bari Weiss, of making a “political” decision to hold a story about Venezuelan men deported by the Trump administration. Ms. Weiss told colleagues on a call on Monday that she had held the segment because it “wasn’t ready.”\n\nDavid Ellison, born in 1983, was largely raised in Woodside, a town in Silicon Valley, by his father’s third wife, Barbara. She and Larry Ellison maintained a warm relationship after their divorce in 1986, several people close to the family say, but he was not a day-to-day presence in his son’s life. Oracle colleagues did not hear him talk often about David, who, when he was 23, said there had been “gaps” in their relationship growing up.\n\nIt wasn’t until the two began taking flight lessons together that they grew close. “I’m afraid I must have passed on the risk-taking gene,” Larry Ellison said about their shared daredevil interest in 2006.\n\nDavid Ellison dropped out of the University of Southern California’s film school and started an acting career. His father heavily financed his first major movie as an actor, “Flyboys,” which was widely considered a flop.\n\nLarry Ellison was relieved when his son left acting and entered the business side of entertainment, two people said. Their relationship grew warmer as David Ellison achieved professional success, they said. Larry Ellison has always considered himself wise about Hollywood, and one of his best friends, Steve Jobs, mentored the son about the business as well.\n\nLarry Ellison was initially skeptical of Skydance, the Hollywood company that his son started and that bought Paramount. But he has told friends in recent years that he considers his son to be one of the smartest people in the business world, trusts his judgment and tends to agree with him on corporate matters, several people with knowledge of the Ellisons said.\n\n“Larry is one of the smartest people I’ve ever met, but I honestly think David may be even smarter,” said Marc Benioff, the chief executive of Salesforce and a mentee of Larry Ellison who said he had known David since he was 3.\n\nIn recent years, Larry Ellison has invited his close circle of friends to join his son for Saturday dinners at his beachside spread on Carbon Beach in Malibu, Calif., often followed by a movie, a person with knowledge of the activities said. And David Ellison, in turn, has sought out personal and medical advice from his father, who considers himself knowledgeable about health care. A few years ago, he called his father for help on how to handle a friend’s medical emergency during a tennis match, people with knowledge of the incident recalled.\n\nLarry Ellison mostly stayed behind the scenes at Skydance. He invested an undisclosed amount in the company as early as 2006, his son has said, and even more during a $150 million fund-raising round in 2010 that made him the largest shareholder.\n\n“He gave me an incredible opportunity by believing in me in the beginning,” David Ellison said in an interview in 2022. “I could not be more grateful for that. And we definitely talk about work constantly and work together constantly.”\n\nToday, Paramount’s board — David Ellison’s bosses — includes the head of his family office, Paul Marinelli, and Oracle’s former chief executive Safra Catz.\n\nLarry Ellison’s experiences with the press have had him, too, thinking about the news business. He was often frustrated by what he saw as sensationalized coverage about him and his personal life, several people close to him said. He only really respected publications like The Financial Times or The Economist. (Oracle often advertised on the back page of The Economist.) In more recent years, he became more antagonistic about the press.\n\nHis son appears to share some of those same feelings. He has told people privately that CBS News could improve its finances if it was perceived as less liberal. He hired Ms. Weiss, the founder of The Free Press, an upstart digital news site, and a regular critic of traditional news organizations, to lead CBS News.\n\nThose criticisms of CBS News also line up with those lodged by Mr. Trump, who has forged a close relationship with Larry Ellison. Mr. Ellison was once a stalwart Clinton-era Democrat, but he has gravitated toward Mr. Trump in large part because of the president’s support for Israel, several people who have spoken to him said. (Both Ellisons are close to Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister of Israel, who one associate described as like an uncle figure to David Ellison.)\n\nDavid Ellison is still leaning hard on his father to help him with Mr. Trump, who could spoil his father’s generosity.\n\nMr. Trump and Larry Ellison speak frequently, people close to Mr. Trump and Mr. Ellison’s operations said. Mr. Ellison has been frustrated at times this year by Mr. Trump’s trade policies, but in recent conversations with the president he has been obsequious, one of the people said.\n\nA White House official said Mr. Trump’s conversations with Mr. Ellison were being mischaracterized. The official declined to be named or elaborate.\n\nThe Paramount deal team only occasionally discusses how to take advantage of the relationship with Mr. Trump, according to a person close to Larry Ellison. But Larry spoke to the president about Warner Bros. Discovery after Netflix announced its deal to buy the company, according to a White House official and a person close to Mr. Trump.\n\nSo far, though, the efforts by the father and son do not necessarily seem to be having the desired effect.\n\n“For those people that think I am close with the new owners of CBS, please understand that 60 Minutes has treated me far worse since the so-called “takeover,” than they have ever treated me before,” Mr. Trump wrote on social media last week. “If they are friends, I’d hate to see my enemies!”\n\nTyler Pager contributed reporting.",

    "title": "Taiwan is getting plenty of missiles and drones from the US. A top business leader says the arsenal is out of balance.",
    "description": "Recent US weapons packages to Taiwan have largely been asymmetric capabilities, but Taiwan needs more advanced systems as well, an official said.",
    "fullText": "The US has sent Taiwan a growing number of asymmetric weapons intended to help deter and defeat a potential Chinese invasion.\n\nTaiwan needs a more balanced arsenal of systems to counter other conflict scenarios, such as a sustained blockade, the president of the US-Taiwan Business Council recently argued.\n\nAsymmetric warfare, which relies on large numbers of relatively inexpensive, mobile, and difficult-to-target systems like drones, missiles, and dispersed units, offers Taiwan an advantage against the military might of China.\n\nBut more conventional capabilities, such as those needed to sustain operations, defend sea lanes, and maintain air and missile defense over time, are still necessary should China attempt to blockade the island. In recent years, US military support has skewed away from those needs.\n\nAt a Hudson Institute think tank event earlier this month, Rupert Hammond-Chambers, the president of the US-Taiwan Business Council, described the state of US military aid to Taiwan as out of balance.\n\nHammond-Chambers said that US arms sales have \"swung from one extreme\" — the weapons deals years ago for MQ-9 Reaper drones, M1A2 Abrams tanks, and F-16 Fighting Falcon fighter jets — \"to the other extreme where we're only doing asymmetric,\" a shift he warned leaves potential vulnerabilities.\n\nOver the last five years, the US has sold and delivered large quantities of missiles, drones, command-and-control upgrades, ammunition, software, and spare parts, marking a shift away from the higher-profile platforms like tanks and fighter jets.\n\nUS officials have argued that survivable, distributed, and networked systems are better suited to helping Taiwan counter China's daily gray-zone pressure, as well as complicating Beijing's plans in a crisis or blockade.\n\nTaiwan's focus has been on building a network of asymmetric capabilities to deter and defend against a full-scale invasion, what some have referred to as a \"D-Day scenario.\"\n\nHammond-Chambers said military support and sales have been aligned with countering that, \"but we are not doing every day, and there needs to be a swing back and more of a balance.\"\n\nJust this month, the US announced a massive $11 billion arms sale to Taiwan that included High-Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, Army Tactical Missile Systems, Javelin missiles, howitzers, and drones. Many of those systems are designed to be mobile, dispersed, and survivable, reinforcing Washington's emphasis on asymmetric and precision-strike capabilities.\n\nTaiwan's defense ministry said the US \"continues to assist Taiwan in maintaining sufficient self-defense capabilities and in rapidly building strong deterrent power and leveraging asymmetric warfare advantages, which form the foundation for maintaining regional peace and stability.\"\n\nTaiwan's government has also proposed billions of dollars in supplemental funding for asymmetric capabilities and an island-wide air defense system called Taiwan Dome or T-Dome.\n\nTaiwan's domestic investment in these weapons raises a key question: \"Will American security assistance adjust given that Taiwan is putting an enormous amount of money further down for this so-called asymmetric approach and allow for consideration of other platforms and systems?\" Hammond-Chambers said.\n\nOne of the most complicated challenges facing Taiwan is how it can develop and stockpile its own weapons systems should a blockade prevent assistance from the US and other allies and partners. The simple answer, retired admiral and former chief of the general staff for Taiwan's defense ministry Lee Hsi-Min said at the event, is to make weapons at scale on the island, rather than relying primarily on co-production or foreign supply.\n\nExperts and officials have long pointed to the need for a stronger local defense supply chain, including spare parts, munitions, and sustainment capabilities, so that Taiwan can remain operational if outside support is delayed or disrupted.\n\nWhile Taiwan's domestic defense industry can continue to develop its own weapons, \"the fastest way to production is to license American and Ukrainian and European designs and to produce on island,\" Betsy Shieh, former senior commercial officer with the US Department of Commerce, said at the event.\n\nThat approach, while not without political and logistical hurdles, could allow Taiwan to scale production more quickly. Taiwanese companies will learn to innovate as that goes on, she said, \"but the short term is license, license, license, build on island.\"\n\nTaiwan's government budgets for defense have increased substantially, and it continues to assess what types of weapons and capabilities are most needed for the different ways China could attempt to seize the island.\n\nAt this moment, some of its domestic companies have been going all-in on drone production, and a government-created national drone team is focused on bringing together firms from across Taiwan's industrial base to help build those systems at scale, but more engagement may be necessary to realize its potential.",

    "title": "The AI bubble debate: 17 business leaders, from Sam Altman to Bill Gates to Peter Thiel, weigh in",
    "description": "OpenAI's Sam Altman sparked fears of an AI bubble. Business leaders like Bill Gates, Mark Cuban, and Jensen Huang disagree over whether one exists.",
    "fullText": "The AI boom shows no sign of slowing down. Some top business leaders are concerned that a bubble is about to burst.\n\nIn August, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman gave voice to those fears about the future of AI. Since then, other CEOs, including Nvidia's Jensen Huang, have dismissed concerns of an AI bubble. Wall Street is also worried about the increasing circular nature of Big Tech's spending spree.\n\nHere's what leading tech CEOs and business leaders are saying about what's ahead.\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that the AI market is in a bubble.\n\n\"When bubbles happen, smart people get overexcited about a kernel of truth,\" Altman recently told reporters, per The Verge.\n\nAltman said this describes the state of play.\n\n\"Are we in a phase where investors as a whole are overexcited about AI? My opinion is yes. Is AI the most important thing to happen in a very long time? My opinion is also yes,\" he said.\n\nMicrosoft cofounder Bill Gates says AI is in a bubble — just not to the extent of Danish tulips.\n\n\"The value is extremely high, just like creating the internet ended up being, in net, very valuable,\" Gates told CNBC in late October. \"But you have a frenzy. And some of these companies will be glad they spent all this money. Some of them, you know, they'll commit to data centers whose electricity is too expensive.\"\n\nGates said that the situation reminds him of dot-com bubble when overvalued internet companies sparked a crash.\n\n\"Absolutely, there are a ton of these investments that will be dead ends,\" he said.\n\nStill, the billionaire said that AI remains a major breakthrough, calling it \"the biggest technical thing ever in my lifetime.\"\n\nMark Cuban, who famously sold Broadcast.com just before the dot-com bubble burst, said he doesn't see similarities to the current situation.\n\n\"There were people creating companies with just a website and going public. That's a bubble where there's no intrinsic value at all,\" Cuban told podcaster Lex Fridman in 2024. '\"People aren't even trying to make operating cap profits, they're just trying to leverage the frothiness of the stock market, that's a bubble. You don't see that right now. \"\n\nCuban took particular notice of the quality of AI companies going public.\n\n\"We're not seeing funky AI companies just go public,\" he said. \"If all of a sudden we see a rush of companies who are skins on other people's models or just creating models to create models that are going public, then yeah, that's probably the start of a bubble.\"\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said AI could become a bubble, but there will only be a crash if companies fail to keep making advancements.\n\n\"If the models keep on growing in capability year-over-year and demand keeps growing, then maybe there is no collapse,\" Zuckerberg told the \"Access\" podcast in September.\n\nZuckerberg said there are risks that the AI boom becomes like the dot-com bubble.\n\n\"There's definitely a possibility, at least empirically, based on past large infrastructure buildouts and how they led to bubbles, that something like that would happen here.\"\n\nFor Meta, Zuckerberg said the real risk is not spending enough.\n\n\"The risk, at least for a company like Meta, is probably in not being aggressive enough rather than being somewhat too aggressive,\" he said.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang doesn't see a bubble.\n\n\"I don't believe we're in an AI bubble,\" Huang told Bloomberg TV.\n\nHuang said that instead of overspeculation, AI is part of a transition from an old way of computing.\n\n\"We're going through a natural transition from an old computing model based on general purpose computing to accelerated computing,\" he said. \"We also know that AI has become good enough because of reasoning capability, and research capability, its ability to think — it's now generating tokens and intelligence that is worth paying for.\"\n\nNvidia is skyrocketing amid AI-fueled hope. In late October, the chipmaker became the world's first $5 trillion market cap company.\n\nHuang said Nvidia is happy to pay for AI for its employees, name-checking Cursor, an AI coding agent, as one of many services for which his company pays.\n\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai said there is some \"irrationality\" in the AI boom. He also cautioned that if a bubble were to burst, its blast radius would extend across the private sector.\n\n\"I think no company is going to be immune, including us,\" Pichai told the BBC in November.\n\nComparing the current moment to the Dotcom era, Pichai said that sometimes investment cycles can \"overshoot.\"\n\n\"I expect AI to be the same,\" he said. \"So I think it's both rational and there are elements of irrationality through a moment like this.\"\n\nAmazon founder Jeff Bezos says AI is in a bubble, but not in the way everyone might think.\n\nBezos called the current situation an \"industrial bubble.\" The world's third-richest person said there are similarities now, including the frenzy of investments.\n\n\"The good ideas and the bad ideas. And investors have a hard time in the middle of this excitement, distinguishing between the good ideas and the bad ideas,\" he said in October during a conference in Italy. \"And that's also probably happening today.\"\n\nBezos said that hoopla shouldn't overshadow the reality that \"AI is real\" and will change society.\n\n\"The [bubbles] that are industrial are not nearly as bad,\" Bezos said. \"It can even be good, because when the dust settles and you see who are the winners. Societies benefit from those inventions.\"\n\nJPMorgan Vice Chairman Daniel Pinto said he sees a correction coming.\n\n\"There is probably a correction there,\" Pinto said at a Bloomberg event in November.\n\nPinto said the market is pushing valuations beyond current justifications.\n\n\"In order to justify these valuations, you are considering a level of productivity that, it will happen, but it may not happen as fast as the market is pricing now,\" he said.\n\nLike Altman, OpenAI chairman Bret Taylor says we're in an AI bubble.\n\n\"I think it is both true that AI will transform the economy, and I think it will, like the internet, create huge amounts of economic value in the future,\" Taylor told The Verge in September. \"I think we're also in a bubble, and a lot of people will lose a lot of money.\"\n\nTaylor, who is also CEO of Sierra, also sees some similarities to the dot-com bubble. He also said that some of the internet companies that failed in the 90s were just ahead of their time.\n\n\"Even things like Webvan, there's now, as the internet became more distributed, really healthy businesses like Instacart and DoorDash and others that were built now that the smartphone and the scale of the internet has matured,\" he said. \"So even some of the specific ideas were actually not that bad, but maybe a little early.\"\n\nFormer Google CEO Eric Schmidt said just because it looks like a bubble doesn't mean that it is.\n\n\"I think it's unlikely, based on my experience, that this is a bubble,\" Schmidt said in July during an appearance at the RAISE Summit in Paris. \"It's much more likely that you're seeing a whole new industrial structure.\"\n\nSchmidt said it takes solace in where the hardware and chips markets stand.\n\n\"You have these massive data centers, and Nvidia is quite happy to sell them all the chips,\" he said. \"I've never seen a situation where hardware capacity was not taken up by software.\"\n\nFormer Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger says AI is in a bubble, but it won't pop for \"several years.\"\n\n\"Are we in an AI bubble? Of course. Of course we are,\" Gelsinger told CNBC in October. \"I mean, we're hyped. We're accelerating. We're putting enormous leverage into the system.\"\n\nGelsinger said that businesses are just beginning to reap the benefits of AI.\n\n\"As Jensen (Huang) talked about, and I agree with this, you know that businesses are yet to really start materially benefiting from it,\" he said. \"We're displacing all of the internet and the service provider industry as we think about it today — we have a long way to go.\"\n\nAlibaba cofounder Joe Tsai has voiced concerns about the scramble for data centers needed to help power the next generation of AI models.\n\n\"I start to see the beginning of some kind of bubble,\" Tsai told the HSBC Global Investment Summit in March, Bloomberg News reported.\n\nTsai said he's worried the building rush might outpace demand.\n\n\"I start to get worried when people are building data centers on spec,\" he said. \"There are a number of people coming up, funds coming out, to raise billions or millions of capital.\"\n\nHedge fund icon Ray Dalio voiced concerns about a bubble earlier this year, when DeepSeek's rollout led analysts to rethink AI's outlook.\n\n\"Where we are in the cycle right now is very similar to where we were between 1998 or 1999,\" Dalio told the Financial Times in January. \"There's a major new technology that certainly will change the world and be successful. But some people are confusing that with the investments being successful.\"\n\nAt the time, Dalio cited high stock prices and high interest rates. The good news is that Wall Street widely expects the Federal Reserve to cut rates during its September meeting.\n\nBillionaire tech CEO Thomas Siebel said there is \"absolutely\" an AI bubble and that it's \"huge.\"\n\n\"So we have this similar thing going on with generative AI that we've seen with previous technologies,\" Siebel told Fortune in January. \"The market is way, way overvaluing.\"\n\nSiebel, who leads C3.ai, singled out OpenAI in terms of overevaluations.\n\n\"If it disappeared, it wouldn't make any difference in the world,\" he said. \"Nothing would change. I mean, nobody's life would change. No company would change. Microsoft would find something else to power Copilot. There's like 10 other products available that would do it equally as good.\"\n\nAMD CEO Lisa Su says the bubble talk \"is completely wrong.\"\n\n\"For those who are talking about a 'bubble,' I think they're being too narrow in their thinking of, what is the return on investment today or over the next six months,\" Su told Time Magazine in 2024. \"I think you have to look at this technology arc for AI over the next five years, and how does it fundamentally change everything that we do? And I really believe that AI has that potential.\"\n\nNicolai Tangen, who runs the world's biggest sovereign wealth fund, said if AI is a bubble, \"it may not be such a bad bubble.\"\n\nSpeaking to the Financial Times in November, the CEO of Norway's $2 trillion sovereign wealth fund said that AI is a \"pretty hot space\" right now, fueled by hype and a wave of capital. As the technology marks a sweeping societal shift, traditional valuations can be difficult to determine.\n\nTangen said overvaluation isn't entirely negative. The sheer volume of capital rushing into AI will ultimately fund technologies that boost long-term productivity — from automation to data processing to new types of AI models.\n\nThe hard part for investors is telling real breakthroughs apart from noise in a landscape still dominated by a few powerful platform companies, he added.\n\nPeter Thiel, the billionaire venture capitalist who cofounded PayPal, indicated recently that he's skeptical of the notion of an AI bubble.\n\n\"My macroeconomic placeholder is that it's going to keep going,\" Thiel said in a December interview with The Spectator, referring to the economic growth driven by the technology.\n\nThiel also said that he's been asked about an AI bubble frequently by people in Europe, which is \"how you know that they're not going to build a lot of AI in Europe.\"\n\n\"There is no other vector of growth in our society, we would be out of our minds not to take it,\" Thiel said. \"I don't think it's big enough to solve the budget deficit, but if the US embraces AI and Europe rejects it, I think the US is in somewhat better shape than Europe is.\"\n\nDespite his projections of future growth, Thiel also said that there are \"all sorts of things that I don't particularly like about the AI revolution,\" including that it's concentrated in a handful of large companies and that AI is \"probably more of a substitute than a complement\" to human labor.\n\n\"It will have a zero-sum feel to a lot of people,\" Thiel said.",

    "fullText": "The holiday season is in full swing, and while Serie A may be pausing for a few days, the transfer rumor mill is raging on unabated. Although a few new names have been added to the mix, the Italian press continues to focus on Roma’s pursuit of Manchester United forward Joshua Zirkzee and Atletico Madrid midfielder Giacomo Raspadori.\n\nWhile they bring different traits to the table, Zirkzee and Raspadori have followed similar career arcs, parlaying success in Italy into megamillion moves to larger European clubs. However, with only 586 combined league minutes between them, life outside of Italy hasn’t been kind to these former Serie A standouts.\n\nFortunately, there may be hope on the horizon for these two talented attackers in the form of a curmudgeonly calcio genius. According to multiple sources in Italy, Gian Piero Gasperini has identified Zirkzee and Raspadori as the ideal salves for his wounded attack.\n\nRecent reports from Italy indicate that Roma will acquire both players on loan with options to buy (€40M for Zirkzee, €18M for Raspadori) that become obligations if certain objectives are met, including the club qualifying for the Champions League next season. This would represent a significant investment for the club and may require the corresponding sales or loan cancellations of players like Evan Ferguson, Leon Bailey, and Artem Dovbyk.\n\nThis is all speculation, of course, but the depth and breadth of these rumors suggest that Roma and Gasperini have clearly established priorities for the January transfer market. All that remains is to push the deals over the finish line, which is no easy feat with this many moving pieces.",

    "fullText": "Managing a business is challenging, even in the best circumstances. In today's uncertain economy, marked by slowing consumer spending and shifting retail habits, it becomes even tougher.\n\nFor one retail chain, the difficulty has been compounded by years of financial strain, two Chapter 11 bankruptcies, and hundreds of store closures nationwide.\n\nOnce an iconic mall staple known for its affordable jewelry, colorful hair accessories, and quirky novelties, Claire's is again facing serious financial setbacks. A new revelation has raised doubts about the long-term survival of the 64-year-old brand, which once played a significant role in the lives of countless teens and tweens.\n\nAs it works to emerge from its second bankruptcy under new ownership by the private equity firm Ames Watson, Claire's is confronting additional pressures from its supply chain. Several Asian suppliers allege they are owed millions of dollars in unpaid debts, according to claims filed in Hong Kong and reported by CNBC.\n\nThe disputed orders were for holiday merchandise placed before Claire's second bankruptcy filing, when Elliott Management still owned the company. Suppliers were reportedly aware of the retailer's financial instability at the time the orders were made. However, by the time production was completed, Claire's had already filed for bankruptcy.\n\nAfter Ames Watson acquired the brand, some suppliers claimed they were still owed payment, but agreed to continue doing business with Claire's. Others chose to pursue legal action against Claire's Hong Kong-based sourcing office, RSI International.\n\nAs a major American retail chain, Claire's is a prominent customer for many of these Asian suppliers. This is why, despite outstanding balances, several vendors continued to fulfill orders out of fear that refusing to do so could jeopardize their business relationship with the retailer.\n\nDuring its latest acquisition process, RSI International notified creditors that they had 30 days to file claims to recover unpaid debts, liabilities that under Hong Kong Law do not transfer to new owners.\n\nIn a statement to CNBC, Ames Watson emphasized it was \"not involved in the operation or purchasing decisions made prior to the acquisition.\"\n\n\"Since then, we have focused on responsibly stewarding the business and engaging suppliers in good faith as we strengthen Claire's for the long term,\" said Ames Watson. \"We are excited about the company’s direction in 2026.\"\n\nClaire's first filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2018, emerging later that year under the new ownership of Elliott Management Corp. and Monarch Alternative Capital.",

    "description": "Cassi Zheng spent her 30th birthday alone in Tokyo. It gave her a chance to stop focusing on what was missing.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Cassi Zheng, 31, the founder of Aurawell, an aromatherapy brand. Her words have been edited for length and clarity.\n\nAs a brand director at a sports-drink startup in Shanghai, I spoke to more than 30 people a day — from members of the sports community to suppliers and colleagues seeking sign-offs.\n\nI was drained. I felt chronic pain, constant fatigue, and even had panic attacks.\n\nIn February 2023, at 29, I quit. I wanted to head into my 30s with a clearer sense of purpose. I didn't tell my parents, but my friends and colleagues were supportive.\n\nSuddenly, I had nothing to do, and that early idleness felt panic-inducing. I was so used to running around, talking to people, and being needed. I felt completely lost for a few days.\n\nThen I started trying different things. I biked across the city from one end to the other, covering more than 10 kilometers. Another time, I biked 30 kilometers just to go kayaking.\n\nI felt exhausted, but also energized.\n\nI spent the first year traveling across Asia. Because I'd been practicing Reiki, Japan felt like a natural first stop.\n\nOn a trip to Tokyo and Kyoto with friends, temples and traditional inns sparked something within me. I knew I wanted to go back again on my own.\n\nI kept moving. Bangkok's flea markets and Chinatown reminded me of Guangzhou, where I grew up, in the '90s.\n\nIn South Korea, I rang in the new year on Jeju Island with old friends, racing to find a taxi minutes before midnight.\n\nOn New Year's Day, I flew to Kyoto for my first true solo trip. I'd lived on my own before — college and grad school in the US, travel through Mexico, Kenya, Nepal — but Japan felt different. It was the perfect place to be an introvert.\n\nI spent my birthday alone in Tokyo, sick with the flu, wandering the Nezu Museum's gardens. The quiet design reminded me to notice what's present, instead of what's missing.\n\nI returned to Japan twice more that year, spending days meditating alone in the mountains.\n\nA year and a half after quitting, I spent three weeks in Europe. On a hike in Sicily, I met a man climbing beside me. He spoke Italian, I spoke English, but we managed. He told me his father had paved the mountain road. Afterward, I visited his café.\n\nSicily felt open and passionate — a contrast to Shanghai's intensity.\n\nI began crying without knowing why and felt ashamed. I tried to step away, but the teacher told me I didn't need to hide. With an East Asian upbringing, that was incredibly freeing. I cried for two days, overwhelmed by release.\n\nI'd long relied on external validation from bosses, parents, and goal-driven metrics. My gap year loosened that grip. I could count the trips or the solo days, but none of that defines me.\n\nOn my 30th birthday, I finally told my parents about my gap year and the aromatherapy brand I was starting with a friend. They were shocked — it was far outside their comfort zone — but showing them my business plan and prototypes helped. Even now, when I visit them a few hours outside Shanghai, they enjoy talking about metrics and the future of my company.\n\nMy friend and I launched Aurawell in May 2024, just over a year after I left my job. I first got the word out by leading a public meditation in an underground performance space.\n\nTaking a gap year was one of the wisest decisions I've made. It gave me time to slow down, reflect on my choices, and discover what I actually enjoy, without pressure from the outside world.\n\nDo you have a story about taking a gap year that you want to share?

    "title": "The Atlanta Braves have done a lot this offseason — have they done enough to bounce back in 2026?",
    "description": "With Opening Day three months away, the Braves seem pretty much finished with offseason business.",
    "fullText": "For the Atlanta Braves, 2025 was an avalanche of disappointment.\n\nEntering the season on a seven-year postseason streak, the Braves were considered championship contenders, the National League’s best chance at unseating the juggernaut Dodgers. With a strong core of experienced position players, the NL’s reigning Cy Young in Chris Sale and a pair of superstars coming back from injury in Ronald Acuña Jr. and Spencer Strider, Atlanta began the season with 93.4% playoff odds, according to FanGraphs.\n\nInstead, a depleted, injury-plagued Braves club trudged to a shocking 76-86 record and a fourth-place finish in a down NL East.\n\nThankfully, the autopsy is pretty straightforward. Sale and key rotation piece Spencer Schwellenbach both spent long stretches on the IL. The same was true for third baseman Austin Riley, who underperformed when available. Strider looked rusty and out of sync upon his return from Tommy John. Stalwarts such as Ozzie Albies, Michael Harris II, Marcel Ozuna and Sean Murphy all struggled offensively. The emergence of NL Rookie of the Year Drake Baldwin was an invigorating development, but it wasn’t enough to overcome the simple fact that too many important players spent too much time watching baseball instead of playing it.\n\nBut the future, at Truist Park, is not lost.\n\nBecause as disappointing as last season was for Atlanta, the club’s front office has conducted business this winter like a team fully expecting to contend in 2026. President of baseball operations Alex Anthopoulos is clearly treating 2025 as a blip, an aberration, a fluke. With the new year still a week away, Atlanta’s head honcho has arguably done more to reinforce his roster than any other exec.\n\nThe Braves have signed six MLB free agents, a tally that ranks second so far this offseason behind the Cubs. To that sextet, Atlanta has guaranteed more than $106 million, the fifth-largest outlay as of Tuesday. The spending itself is not particularly shocking — the Braves have always run a top-10 payroll under Anthopoulos — but the team’s unflinching aggression is a reminder that the Braves are still a formidable presence in the National League.\n\nTo be fair, none of Atlanta’s additions was significant enough to warrant an in-person, jersey-unveiling press conference. But the Braves are undoubtedly a better, more complete and deeper team now than they were two months ago.\n\n[Get more Atlanta news: Braves team feed]\n\nFormer Padres closer Robert Suárez was probably the newsiest acquisition, with the soon-to-be 35-year-old flamethrower joining on a three-year, $45 million contract. It’s a long commitment for a reliever approaching his baseball golden years, but Suárez still throws absolute gas and has been one of the league’s most reliable closers over the past few years. His 76 saves since the start of 2024 are the most in baseball.\n\nBut don’t expect that number to rise much higher, as Suárez won’t begin the year as Atlanta’s closer. That’s because the Braves also re-signed Raisel Iglesias, their longtime closer, on a one-year, $16 million deal. He’ll continue to handle the ninth, and new skipper Walt Weiss will deploy Suárez in the Swiss Army knife, fireman role. Veterans Joel Payamps and Danny Young were also brought in on one-year deals to bolster a bullpen that finished 19th in baseball with a 4.19 ERA in 2025.\n\nAnthopoulos and Co. have been busy refurbishing the offensive side as well. Back in November, Atlanta  swung a one-for-one deal with Houston, acquiring utilityman Mauricio Dubón in exchange for defensive wizard Nick Allen. Dubón isn’t a particularly good hitter, but he provides a lot of defensive versatility and is a perfectly capable bat. The Braves followed that deal with a pair of more needle-moving signings in shortstop Ha-Seong Kim and outfielder Mike Yastrzemski.\n\nKim spent the final month of 2025 with the Braves after the club claimed him off waivers from the Tampa Bay Rays. That move was motivated by the hope that Kim wouldn’t activate his opt-out and Atlanta would have itself an every-day shortstop for 2026. Instead, the Korean glovesmith decided to test free agency, a smart decision as it turned out. Kim, who was set to receive $16 million, ended up back in Atlanta on a one-year, $20 million deal.\n\nThat’s a hefty investment for a player who was both hurt and bad in 2025, but Kim has been an average big-league hitter for most of his career while providing ample value at the game’s most difficult infield spot. For the Braves, whose shortstops finished dead last in baseball a year ago, with a putrid 56 wRC+, it’s a price worth paying.\n\nYastrzemski, who joined on a two-year, $23 million deal, is an unspectacular yet remarkably consistent corner outfielder. The 35-year-old has been worth at least 2.0 bWAR in every one of his seven big-league seasons and has a career .809 OPS against right-handed pitching. Although he’ll likely sit against most lefty starters, Yaz will provide depth in the corners behind Acuña and Jurickson Profar while mixing in at designated hitter.\n\nThat Atlanta has DH at-bats to dole out is a development in its own right. Since Opening Day 2023, Marcell Ozuna has started 445 of Atlanta’s 502 games, postseason included. Now a free agent for the first time in his career, Ozuna usually hit enough to justify clogging up the Braves’ DH spot. But at this point, a reunion feels unlikely, as the Braves can use that space to cycle through Yastrzemski, Profar and whoever isn’t catching that day (Murphy or Baldwin).\n\nWith Opening Day still three months away, the Braves seem pretty much finished with offseason business. Anthopoulos added a pair of every-day bats, a valuable utility guy, two high-leverage relievers and some potentially useful pitching depth. Atlanta could enter the season with its current assortment of ballplayers, and prognosticators and projection systems alike would consider this a playoff team.\n\nBut if the Braves want to push the issue, there’s still one more area ripe for a splash: the starting rotation. Sale, now fully healthy, will lead the line as he prepares to hit free agency at season’s end. Behind him, there’s Strider (looking to recapture his pre-surgery form), Schwellenbach (missed the last few months of ‘25 due to a fractured elbow), Reynaldo Lopez (made just one start in ‘25 before undergoing shoulder surgery) and youngster Hurston Waldrep (impressed in a nine-start sample but remains unproven). Grant Holmes, Bryce Elder and Didier Fuentes follow as depth options.\n\nIf things break right, that’s a really interesting group with tons of upside. It’s also a group that has shown to be particularly susceptible to the injury bug. That’s what derailed Atlanta’s plans last season, and the same thing could easily happen again.\n\nTo lessen that possibility, the Braves could add one more impact starter to the group. Such a move, given the organization’s middling farm system, would probably have to come via free agency. Atlanta is already over the luxury tax by around $6 million, according to Spotrac. Cashing out for a big arm such as Zac Gallen, Tatsuya Imai or Framber Valdez would push the Braves well over the tax, something the organization is wary of doing.\n\nBut money is just money, and the Braves cannot afford another disappointing season. They’ve done a good job, so far this winter, of avoiding a replay of 2025, but one more big swing could make them quite a formidable character in 2026.",

    "fullText": "Business Insider's Pranav Dixit has been covering Meta for a year now. He recently reported on the company's \"year of intensity\" with colleague Jyoti Mann. I asked Pranav for his take on a turbulent 12 months.\n\nQ: You've been covering Meta for a year now. What has that been like?\n\n\"Intense\" is the only way to describe it — exactly what Mark Zuckerberg promised employees. I joined BI a day before Meta scrapped third-party fact-checking, and almost immediately the culture shifted: DEI rollbacks, an embrace of \"masculine\" energy, and moves that seemed more aligned with the Trump administration. Then came thousands of layoffs of people labeled low performers and a noticeable spike in performance pressure.\n\nThe second half of the year brought a very different pivot. Meta effectively admitted Llama hadn't lived up to the hype and reset around a new mission: building \"personal superintelligence.\" That meant hiring Alexandr Wang, reorganizing AI under Meta Superintelligence Labs, and aggressively poaching talent while high-profile figures — including Yann LeCun — departed. It felt like covering a company reinventing its business, values, and culture all at once.\n\nQ: What stood out most from your reporting with Jyoti Mann on this \"year of intensity\"?\n\nA pervasive survival mindset. Over and over, employees told us the goal wasn't to do great work — it was to avoid landing in the bottom performance tier. Some people left on principle, saying Meta no longer resembled the company they joined. Yet others insisted this is the best job in tech: great product challenges, unmatched scale, exceptional pay. Those two realities sit side by side — one group bracing for impact, another thriving.\n\nQ: Your reporting found managers sometimes hiring people just to fill low-performance slots. How does that work?\n\nMeta's forced ranking requires a set percentage of \"low performers.\" Some managers gamed the system. Some told us they avoided backfilling roles; others hired into fuzzy positions with near-impossible expectations so they didn't have to put existing trusted team members in the bottom bucket. (Meta didn't respond to specific questions on this.)\n\nQ: What will you be watching for in 2026?\n\nThe big question is whether Meta's massive AI spend becomes a durable business or an expensive experiment. Will Meta AI become a distinct, everyday product? Will the capex binge translate into real revenue and profit? And can the culture stabilize enough to keep the AI talent Meta is betting the company on? Meta can execute — history proves that — but \"intensity\" can't last forever. 2026 will show whether the trade-offs were worth it.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

These leaders make choices every day about which customers to prioritize, which capabilities to build, where to allocate resources, and which longstanding activities and processes to evolve.

    "fullText": "Climbing the corporate ladder isn't the only way to increase your earnings.\n\nThroughout 2025, Business Insider spoke to a handful of entrepreneurs and side hustlers who found inventive ways to make money, from firing up 3D printers to propagating rare houseplants.\n\nHere are three of the most creative money-making strategies we heard all year.\n\nMichael Satterlee learned about 3D printing and CAD (computer-aided design) modeling in a class he took his freshman year of high school. He took the skill and ran with it, printing a variety of products, including clog accessories, that he listed and sold on Etsy.\n\nIn 2025, he created a coozie spin-off that he calls a \"tactical reload can holder\" — and the internet can't get enough of it.\n\nPartly thanks to viral videos of the can holder in action, the 18-year-old's company, Cruise Cup, generated $300,000 in sales in November alone. His goal in 2026 is to transition to manufacturing his product in stainless steel, as his 130 printers can barely keep up with demand.\n\nE-commerce entrepreneurs are tapping into a new strategy to move product: Live selling, which combines livestreaming and e-commerce. Sellers are hosting live \"shows\" and chatting with their audience in real time, while viewers are buying directly from the stream without leaving the app.\n\nIt can be incredibly lucrative if you can find the right niche. Top sellers are earning five and six figures in a single livestream.\n\nHarry Luu is one of those sellers. He brought in $42,000 in one day by selling two rare plants — one for $26,000 and the other for $16,000 — on Palmstreet, a live shopping app specifically for rare plants and other unique goods.\n\nThe former mathematician, who left academia in 2024 to cultivate and sell plants full-time, is all in on the \"new age QVC\" strategy.\n\n\"It gives you the convenience of being at home, but also allows the buyer the flexibility of actually interacting and clarifying before they pull the trigger,\" he said. \"And I think that is one of the greatest advantages of live selling.\"\n\nTraditional rental real estate remains a tried-and-true wealth-building strategy, but buying a property, finding renters, and then managing the property and tenants is time-consuming. Property investors like Carl and Mindy Jensen, who have accumulated substantial savings, are adopting a more passive approach: private money lending.\n\nHere's how it works in a nutshell: The Jensens lend money to other investors to rehab a house, for example, and earn interest on the loan. They're essentially acting as the bank.\n\n\"We set the rate. There are some rules around it. For example, the rate can't be super cheap or else the IRS considers it a gift,\" the couple explained, referring to the applicable federal rate (AFR), which is the minimum interest rate the IRS allows for private loans, published monthly.\n\nVetting the borrower and the deal they're pursuing is essential — and time-consuming — but after the upfront due diligence, the ongoing involvement is minimal.\n\nThe neat thing about this money-making strategy? It's a \"win-win\" for both the lender and the borrower, confirmed investor Mike Gorius, who prefers working with private money lenders over traditional lenders: \"Things can just move a lot quicker. It's what allows us to buy properties in a matter of days versus a matter of weeks.\"",

    "fullText": "I missed Hanukkah, and I'm cutting it close on Christmas, but I've finally got my holiday wish list in order.\n\nI'm not looking for new sneakers or some cool electronics. This year's requests focus on the business world. (Santa Claus is a BI Today subscriber, obviously.)\n\nROI for AI. I'm legally required to start every 2025 recap or 2026 look-ahead by mentioning artificial intelligence. This isn't about bashing or praising AI, though. I just want to see some noticeable returns on all these massive AI projects. I'm not screaming about an AI bubble, but my palms get a little sweaty thinking about the ever-growing tech budgets. So, give us all some relief by showing that these AI tools are going to generate revenue.\n\nA solution to Wall Street's recruiting cycle. The worst thing that could happen to a junior banker is finding out their favorite Murray Hill brunch spot has shut down. The second-worst thing happened this year when big banks fought back against PE's early recruitment of them. The result upended a Wall Street tradition aspiring financiers had spent years preparing for. I was never a fan of the process, but the change left us in a weird no-man's land where none of the rules are apparent.\n\nPrediction markets predict their future. With a string of recent media partnerships, we're going to see a lot more data from prediction markets in 2026. Meanwhile, some state regulators aren't so pleased with their rise. So let's settle the debate. I'd like prediction markets to set a market speculating on their own future. Let the people decide!\n\nNo more media blackouts, please. I can't go through another two weeks of no sports because of carriage disputes. I know how this story ends (the customer paying more), and I also know there's nothing I can do about it. So just rip the bandage off, and let's avoid the grandstanding going forward.\n\nProtein, chill out. No food group is on a hotter run than the muscle-building nutrient. But it's flying too close to the sun. We've got protein in hot cocoa now?? I'm a self-admitted gym bro, and I know my whey around a protein shake (I hate myself for that joke), but even I need to put my foot down. Besides, overconsumption of protein could have a painful conclusion for some of us: kidney stones.\n\nThe New York Knicks to reach the NBA finals. I'm not even asking for a title!\n\nThe New York Jets to play a meaningful game in December. Even Santa has his limits",

    "fullText": "WICHITA, Kan. (KSNW) – Being a Kansas City Chiefs fan is often about loyalty and emotional commitment. But with the Chiefs announcing Monday that they would leave the historic Arrowhead Stadium in Missouri and move into a not-yet-built $3 billion stadium on the Kansas side of Kansas City, Kansas-based fans soon won’t need to root for their team across state lines.\n\n“That creates energy that I don’t think we really understand or really appreciate until it starts happening, until the stadium gets built, they play their first game, they play their first season,” Kevin Jenks, the president and CEO of the Wichita Sports Commission, said.\n\nThe Chiefs spent more than five decades playing at Arrowhead. They intend to build their new stadium in Wyandotte County, in the same area as Kansas Speedway and the Legends retail district.\n\n‘I just love Arrowhead’: Some Chiefs super fans not sold on move to Kansas\n\nEven though Wichita will be a few hours away from the new field, the hope is that the team’s presence can strengthen the area’s sports identity. Wichita Sports Commission hopes that includes strengthening ongoing partnerships with the franchise.\n\n“The Chiefs have been big proponents of getting flag football into high schools, and we were a part of that locally with some Wichita schools,” Jenks said. “We are still continuing to promote and be a part of that process.”\n\nDr. Larry Straub, an associate professor of business management at Newman University, says the Chiefs’ presence is likely to improve Kansas’ national image. However, he’s skeptical that the financial boom that comes with a major sports team moving in will echo around the state.\n\n“From an economics standpoint, I think the closer you are to Kansas City, the more benefits you’re going to have,” Straub said.\n\nFor more Kansas news, click here.

Hundreds of families may be forced to pack up and leave the town of 11,000, heading east to Omaha or Iowa, or south to the meatpacking towns of Kansas or beyond, causing spinoff layoffs in Lexington's restaurants, barbershops, grocers, convenience stores and taco trucks.  “Losing 3,000 jobs in a city of 10,000 to 12,000 people is as big a closing event as we’ve seen virtually for decades,” said Michael Hicks, director of the Center for Business and Economic Research at Indiana's Ball State University.",
    "fullText": "LEXINGTON, Neb. (AP) — On a frigid day after Mass at St. Ann’s Catholic Church in rural Nebraska, worshippers shuffled into the basement and sat on folding chairs, their faces barely masking the fear gripping their town.\n\nA pall hung over the room just as it hung over the holiday season in Lexington, Nebraska.\n\n“Suddenly they tell us that there’s no more work. Your world closes in on you,” said Alejandra Gutierrez.\n\nShe and the others work at Tyson Foods' beef plant and are among the 3,200 people who will lose their jobs when Lexington's biggest employer closes the plant next month after more than two decades of operation.\n\nHundreds of families may be forced to pack up and leave the town of 11,000, heading east to Omaha or Iowa, or south to the meatpacking towns of Kansas or beyond, causing spinoff layoffs in Lexington's restaurants, barbershops, grocers, convenience stores and taco trucks.\n\n“Losing 3,000 jobs in a city of 10,000 to 12,000 people is as big a closing event as we’ve seen virtually for decades,” said Michael Hicks, director of the Center for Business and Economic Research at Indiana's Ball State University. It will be “close to the poster child for hard times.”\n\nAll told, the job losses are expected to reach 7,000, largely in Lexington and the surrounding counties, according to estimates from University of Nebraska, Lincoln, shared with The Associated Press. Tyson employees alone will lose an estimated $241 million in pay and benefits annually.\n\nTyson says it's closing the plant to “right-size” its beef business after a historically low cattle herd in the U.S. and the company’s expected loss of $600 million on beef production next fiscal year.\n\nThe plant's closure threatens to unravel a Great Plains town where the American Dream was still attainable, where immigrants who didn't speak English and never graduated high school bought homes, raised children in a safe community and sent them to college.\n\nNow, those symbols of economic progress — mortgages and car payments, property taxes and tuition costs — are bills that thousands of Tyson workers won't have an income to pay.\n\nAt St. Ann's church, Gutierrez sat between her daughters and recalled being told of the plant closure just before Thanksgiving while she visited a college campus with her high school senior, Kimberly.\n\n“At that moment, my daughter said she no longer wanted to study,” Gutierrez said. “Because where would we get the money to pay for college?”\n\nA tear slipped down Kimberly's cheek as she looked at her mother and then down at her hands.\n\nIf you threw a dart at a map of the United States, Lexington — called “Lex” by locals — would be just about bullseye.\n\nIt's easy to miss driving down Interstate 80, half hidden by barren hackberry trees, corn fields and pastures of Black Angus cattle, but a driver can spy the plant's hulking industrial buildings pumping steam.\n\nThe plant opened in 1990 and was bought by Tyson 11 years later, attracting thousands of workers and nearly doubling the town's population within a decade.\n\nMany came from Los Angeles, then stricken by recession, including Lizeth Yanes, who initially hated what she called “a little ghost town.\"\n\nBut soon Lexington flourished, with suburbs sprouting among bur oak and American elm trees. The downtown, a strip of cobblestone streets and brick buildings, has a Somali grocer that abuts a Hispanic bakery; locals attend over a dozen churches and several city recreation centers.\n\nTo this day, the plant creates the town's rhythm as workers roll on and off the daily A, B and C shifts and fill restaurants, school pickup lines and the one-screen movie theater showing “Polar Express.”\n\n“It took a long time for me to actually enjoy this little place,” said Yanes. “Now that I enjoy it, now I have to leave.”\n\nThe atmosphere inside the Tyson plant, where workers process as many as 5,000 head of cattle a day, laboring on slaughter floors, cleaning crews or trimming cuts of meat, feels “like a funeral,” she said.\n\n“Tyson was our motherland,\" said plant worker Arab Adan. The Kenyan immigrant sat in his car with his two energetic sons, who asked him a question he has no answer to: “Which state are we gonna go, daddy?”\n\nThe only thing Adan is set on is that his kids finish the school year in Lexington, where school officials say nearly half of students have a parent working for Tyson.\n\nThe school district, where at least 20 languages and dialects are spoken, has higher high school graduation and college attendance rates than the state and national average, and one of Nebraska's biggest marching bands. Residents are proud of the diversity and the tightknit community, where young people return to raise families.\n\nDuring Mass at St. Ann's, parishioners gave the cash in their pockets to a fund for families in financial need, despite knowing they'll be out of work next month. Afterward, Francisco Antonio ran through his future employment options with a sad smile.\n\nAfter the plant closes on Jan. 20, the 52-year-old father of four said he'll stay a few months in Lexington and look for work, though “now there's no future.\" He took off his glasses, paused, apologized and tried to explain his emotions.\n\n“It’s home mostly, not the job,” he said, replacing his glasses with an embarrassed smile.\n\n“We need another opportunity, job, here in Lex,” he said. “Otherwise Lex is gonna disappear.”\n\nThe domino effect could go something like this: If 1,000 families skip town, said economist Hicks — who wouldn't be surprised if it were double that — seats would be left empty in schools, leading to teacher layoffs; there would be far fewer customers in restaurants, shops and other businesses.\n\nMost of the customers at Los Jalapenos, a Mexican restaurant down the street from the plant, are Tyson workers. They fill booths after work and are greeted by owner Armando Martinez’s mustachioed grin and bellow of “Hola, amigo!”\n\nMartinez’s grandson once told his grandfather that when he grows up he wants to work at Tyson. The child's fifth-grade sister recently gathered with classmates to talk about the changes happening with their parents. Some were headed to California, others to Kansas. All were in tears.\n\nIf he can't keep up with bills, the restaurant will close, but “there’s just nowhere we can go,\" said Martinez, who undergoes dialysis for diabetes, has an amputated foot and prays for a miracle: that Tyson will change its mind.\n\nHe knows it's unlikely. Asked by The Associated Press for comment about plans for the site, Tyson said in a statement that it “is currently assessing how we can repurpose the facility within our own production network.” It did not provide details, or say whether it plans to offer support to the community through the plant closure.\n\nMany, including City Manager Joe Pepplitsch, are hoping Tyson puts the plant up for sale and a new company comes in bringing jobs. That isn't a quick fix, requiring time, negotiations, renovations and no guarantee of comparable jobs.\n\n“Tyson owes this community a debt. I think they have a responsibility here to help ease some of the impact,” he said, noting Tyson doesn't pay city taxes due to a deal negotiated decades ago.\n\n‘It’s not easy, at our age, to go back and start over’\n\nNear the plant, at the Dawson County Fairgrounds, Tyson workers recently filled a long hall as state agencies — responding with the urgency of a natural disaster — offered information on retraining, writing a resume, filing for unemployment and avoiding scammers when selling homes.\n\nAttendees' faces were subdued, like listening to a doctor’s prognosis. “Your financial health is going to change,\" they were told. “Don’t ignore the bank, they will not go away.”\n\nMany of the older workers don’t speak English, haven’t graduated high school and aren’t computer savvy. The last application some filled out was decades ago.\n\n“We know only working in meat for Tyson, we don’t have any other experience,” said Adan, the Kenyan immigrant.\n\nBack at St. Ann's, workers echoed that concern.\n\n“They only want young people now,” said Juventino Castro, who's worked at Tyson for a quarter-century. “I don’t know what’s going to happen in the time I have left.”\n\nLupe Ceja said she's saved a little money, but it won’t last long. Luz Alvidrez has a cleaning gig that will sustain her for awhile. Others might return to Mexico for a time. Nobody has a clear plan.\n\n“It won’t be easy,” said Fernando Sanchez, a Tyson worker for 35 years who sat with his wife. “We started here from scratch and it’s time to start from scratch again.\"\n\nTears rolled down his wife's cheeks and he squeezed her hand.",

    "description": "Finance pros tell Business Insider about the most annoying investing questions they have to field from family around holidays.",
    "fullText": "For finance professionals, the holidays bring festive cheer and optimism for the new year that we all enjoy. For them, it also brings requests for investing advice and stock picks that sources tell Business Insider they'd rather not have to deal with.\n\nFor many investors, advisors, and others who navigate markets for a living, seeing their relatives during the holiday season often means being asked the same question: What stocks should I buy?\n\nThere's no easy answer, as the stock market is unpredictable and everyone has different risk tolerance, investment horizons, and goals.\n\nColin Sahagun, the founder and CEO of Stelrix, a fintech startup that recently launched an investment-backed spending card, says the question often amounts to, \"How do I get rich quick?\"\n\n\"Every year, someone asks, 'Tell me the next 20 high-growth stocks I should buy,'\" he recalls. \"I will have older relatives asking for 'the next Oklo under 10 dollars' or 'the next Vertiv at fourteen.' They want moonshot ideas and total reassurance at the same time.\"\n\nOklo and Vertiv are two stocks that have enjoyed big runs in 2025. Vertiv has jumped 44%, while Oklo is up a whopping 280%.\n\nSteven Rick, chief economist at financial services firm TruStage, says he's routinely asked for the next hot stock when visiting family for the holidays.\n\nHe notes that a common question is something like: \"Why didn't you tell me to buy Nvidia stock two years ago?\"\n\n\"This is annoying because 'hindsight bias' occurs when family members perceive a past massive rise in a stock price as more predictable than it actually was.\"\n\nAnthony Rasotto, CEO of wealth management firm ARC Wealth, echoed that sentiment, adding that requests for advice on the direction of the market are among the most irritating.\n\n\"The most annoying question is, 'Which way is the market going in the next few months?' It's usually from an uncle near or at retirement,\" he said. \"I always answer: 'I don't know.' If I could predict the market, I wouldn't need to work at all.\"\n\nPeople who work in crytpo also get bombared for advice at the holidays. Adrian Fritz, CIO of digital asset brokerage platform 21Shares, told Business Insider that while he's often asked about the best time to buy bitcoin, he's sometimes asked to name the best asset to buy in the coming year.\n\n\"It assumes there's a single 'best' asset for everyone, as if I've been hiding a secret Christmas stock pick all year waiting to unveil it at dinner,\" he said. \"The reality is a lot less cinematic: good investing depends on personal circumstances, not holiday fortune-telling.\"\n\nFinance pros stress that there is never a clear answer to the annoying stock market questions they receive from relatives. Anthony Termini, a former hedge fund CIO turned investment analyst and commentator, highlighted why many people don't want to discuss these topics in depth.\n\n\"The answer is always, 'who knows?'\" he said. \"More importantly, who cares? Whatever the answer is, it may never be an asset class or security that is appropriate or suitable.\"",

Using nationally representative household consumption surveys from 23 countries that together account for 50% of the world’s poor, we estimate that reducing the poverty rate to 1% (from a baseline of 12% at the time of last survey) would cost $170B nominal per year. This is 5.5 times the corresponding reduction in the aggregate poverty gap, but only 19% of the cost of universal basic income.

    "description": "Karen Gilchrist jokes that her \"maternal instincts kicked in late,\" but by 2024 she and her husband, Pablo Slough, decided to prioritize family over climbing the corporate ladder.",
    "fullText": "Over two decades of working in demanding roles managing teams around the world had taken a toll.\n\n\"I worked straight out of college, and then it was one job to the other job,\" Slough, 53, told Business Insider. \"It was always fast-paced, high stress.\"\n\nFor Gilchrist, turning 50 last summer drove her to reflect about how she'd spent her time and what she wanted to do moving forward.\n\n\"I joke sometimes that my maternal instincts kicked in late,\" Gilchrist told Business Insider. \"But it felt like the right moment to dedicate more time to my family than to work and climbing the corporate ladder.\"\n\nTheir oldest son, Luka, 18, is in his senior year and plans to head off to college in the fall. The other two, Mateo, 15, and Joaquin, 12, aren't far behind.\n\nTaking a gap year would give the couple a chance to step away from work, travel with their kids, and figure out their next steps.\n\nBut they didn't jump in immediately. The couple, based in Boulder, Colorado, hired a financial advisor a year in advance to make sure the plan was financially feasible.\n\n\"We also decided that we're going to rent our house out while we're traveling, so we could get some income,\" Slough said.\n\nAs their plans to quit became more concrete, the couple talked through everything with their kids. Funnily enough, it was their sons who seemed unsure at first.\n\n\"We were a bit surprised that our parents would actually do it because they have always been very focused on their careers,\" their second son, Mateo, told Business Insider.\n\nBut one of the reasons the couple wanted to do this was to show their kids that life isn't just about work, Gilchrist said.\n\n\"It's about life. It's about balancing things. It's about family,\" she said, adding that they hoped the experience would show their kids that life doesn't always have to follow a fixed path.\n\nThe couple considered it a career break, but the plan was not to travel the whole time.\n\n\"We didn't want to disrupt school,\" Slough said. \"So we just thought we'll come back for school, and then whatever free time we have, we'll travel.\"\n\nThe family spent the summer of 2024 traveling around Europe, a trip planned around their eldest son's three-week business course at a university in Barcelona.\n\nTheir travels began in Turkey, before they hopped on a cruise through Greece, Croatia, Malta, and Montenegro. After dropping their son off for his program, they explored Spain and Portugal before reuniting and heading to Colombia. They were back in Colorado a week before school started.\n\nThis year, their summer took them to Asia, with stops in Hong Kong, several cities in Thailand, Vietnam, China, and finally Japan.\n\n\"We all wanted to go to Asia, so we were really excited about it,\" Luka, their oldest son, told Business Insider.\n\nTo budget for their trips, the couple created an Excel sheet to track their daily expenses.\n\n\"We had an average spend per day that we wanted to aim for. It meant that in some places, we splurged because we wanted a really nice hotel. And in other places, we were a little bit more frugal,\" Gilchrist said, adding that they would update their expenses in real time to see if they were within their budget.\n\nLooking back on the trips, the family says they loved every moment.\n\n\"It felt like our parents were more present and flexible with us,\" Joaquin, their youngest, told Business Insider. \"We also learned more about each other's preferences, from the experiences and foods we enjoy to how each of us likes to spend our free time.\"\n\nDuring the months they weren't traveling, the couple spent their time at home doing things they rarely had time for before, such as exercising together, reading, and going to the movies every week.\n\n\"Now, we have this objective of cooking something completely new every day,\" Gilchrist said.\n\nThe couple says they feel less stressed, sleep better, and have genuinely enjoyed spending more time together.\n\n\"We're like, 'OK, we're going to be together all day long. What is that going to look like?' And truthfully, I think it's been amazing,\" Gilchrist said.\n\nBut the biggest benefit of taking time away from work has been having the space to reflect on what they wanted to do next, Slough said. He started teaching three days a week at a local university.\n\n\"It's something I've always wanted to do,\" Slough said. \"And then it just happened to come my way.\"\n\nHad he been working full-time, taking up this offer would have been out of the question, he said.\n\nThey also realized they didn't have to return to their corporate jobs to live comfortably. They could earn a portion of what they once made and still maintain their lifestyle.\n\nWorking with a financial advisor helped them identify areas where they were overspending and set a goal to cut their regular expenses by 30%. Before that, the couple had never closely tracked their finances.\n\n\"We were spending so much that we thought we needed really high-paying jobs to be able to continue,\" Slough said.\n\nKyle D. Dennehy, a financial advisor at California Financial Advisor who wasn't involved in the couple's planning, told Business Insider that the first step in preparing for a career break is to create a detailed budget that outlines all income sources, expenses, and savings goals.\n\n\"Once you have your 'normal' budget, estimate how each specific category will shift during an adult gap year, but keep your long-term goal savings like retirement contributions included in the gap year budget,\" Dennehy said.\n\nOnce the difference between the regular and new budgets is clear, a plan can be created to regularly contribute toward the updated savings goal, Dennehy said.\n\nNow, the couple is exploring whether to buy and run a small local business rather than slip back into corporate jobs. Gilchrist said they might never have considered entrepreneurship without the break.\n\n\"We joke, and we say that this time has also been a research and development phase for us on, 'OK, what does being productive over the next 10, 20 years look like?'\" Gilchrist said.\n\nOf course, there are risks that come with taking an extended career break, but careful financial planning has helped them manage those uncertainties.\n\n\"Plan it properly. It can't just be like, 'Oh, I quit my job this weekend, and we're going to travel for a year.' It will not work,\" Slough said.\n\nDo you have a story to share about taking a career break?

    "description": "Lee Wan Yu, a former Disneyland parade dancer, shares a behind-the-scenes look at the audition process and what she learned from Disney's magic.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Lee Wan Yu, 30, a Hong Kong Disneyland parade dancer turned freelance dance artist, teacher, and choreographer. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI started dancing when I was three years old, after asking my mom for ballet lessons as we walked past a studio.\n\nFrom then on, all I wanted to do was dance. That love eventually led me somewhere I, as an introvert, never expected: Hong Kong Disneyland.\n\nIt started in 2017, when Hong Kong Disneyland held an audition at the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts in Singapore, where I was studying for my diploma in dance.\n\nI went with a friend who didn't want to go alone. I had no expectations and just wanted to see how a professional audition works.\n\nAbout 50 dancers from the region participated in the audition.\n\nThey gave us a short jazz combination and had us perform it in small groups, cutting dancers until about 20 of us were left. They took our photos, measured our height, and recorded our body measurements.\n\nMonths later, while I was studying for my fine arts degree in New York, I was offered a standard one-year contract as a parade dancer at Hong Kong Disneyland.\n\nWhen I arrived in May 2018, I realized I was the only Singaporean parade dancer at the time. The team included dancers from Hong Kong, Japan, the Philippines, Russia, Taiwan, and Thailand.\n\nA typical day started around 11 a.m. We had a warm-up class, followed by makeup and costumes.\n\nWe typically performed two parades a day, one in the afternoon and one at night, for about 30 minutes each. During festive seasons like Christmas, we could have up to four parades a day.\n\nIn the middle of each parade, we would stop in front of the castle for a short \"show stop\" to interact with guests.\n\nRehearsals for the Halloween parades sometimes ended around 2 a.m. because they took place after the park closed for the night.\n\nThe Hong Kong heat can be terrible, and the night-parade costumes had lights wired through and batteries attached. You could feel the weight pressing on your shoulders.\n\nSometimes I felt homesick or lonely, but once you're in costume, you have to bring your full energy.\n\nWhen you step into Disneyland, you should feel like you're transported to a different world — a place where you can disconnect, forget your problems for a while, and just be happy.\n\nThis is why guests would never see dancers working out during breaks, because Disney wanted to keep the illusion. We were also not allowed to take any backstage photos or videos.\n\nThe magic is the reason some guests come to every parade. There were adults who followed the route, taking photos, and kids who waved at us every day. I remember a teenage boy who came almost every weekend, dancing beside the route the whole time.\n\nSome of them recognized us outside the park without our costumes. Others gave us prints of photos they had taken of us.\n\nIt was more than just branding and the experience.\n\nAt Hong Kong Disneyland, everyone, from the dancers to the sound crew, respected one another. Even when people were tired, they were still polite. That attitude really stuck with me.\n\nI learned that how I treat people — not just the audience, but also my colleagues, the costume team, and the stage managers — really affects how smoothly everything runs and whether people want to be around you.\n\nOn the other side, Disney valued its performers. It was very serious about safety and well-being. We had good medical insurance, which is important for dancers.\n\nAfter one year, I decided not to re-audition for contract renewal. I wanted to explore new challenges.\n\nI'm now a freelance dancer, teacher, and choreographer in Singapore, where I try to infuse Disney's spirit of \"magic\" into my work.\n\nDance training can be stressful for kids, especially during exams or competitions, so I try to keep that sense of fun alive and create an environment where my students feel safe and excited to learn.\n\nThe magic is about creating that little moment in class where someone feels proud or inspired.\n\nI also try to bring that same magic into my choreography. AI plays a small part in helping me express my ideas.\n\nAs a choreographer, I often have to write synopses for school performances or competitions, and that part is difficult because dancers think in movement, not in sentences.\n\nRecently, I started using ChatGPT to help organize my ideas. I don't let it write for me, but I use it to structure what I already have and express my thoughts more clearly.\n\nI'm also open to trying AI software for large-scale productions with apps that can help with pinpoint formations, map things out, and visualise spacing.\n\nOver the past two years, I was a choreographer for Singapore's National Day Parade performances, overseeing close to 600 students for one of them. I remember spending weeks figuring out formations by hand, staying up until 3 a.m. or 4 a.m., moving people around in Excel.\n\nIf AI could help with that, it would save so much time.\n\nBut technology can only assist — the emotion behind the movement still has to come from people.",

    "fullText": "PHOENIX (AP) — When Turning Point USA's annual AmericaFest convention reached its halfway point, Erika Kirk tried to put a smiling face on things.\n\n“Say what you want about AmFest, but it’s definitely not boring,” said Kirk, who has led the influential conservative organization since her husband Charlie was assassinated in September. “Feels like a Thanksgiving dinner where your family’s hashing out the family business.”\n\nSome of the biggest names in conservative media took turns torching each other on the main stage, spending more time targeting right-wing rivals than their left-wing opponents.\n\nThe feuds could ultimately define the boundaries of the Republican Party and determine the future of President Donald Trump's fractious coalition, which appears primed for more schisms in the months and years ahead.\n\nHere are some of the most notable moments from the four-day conference.\n\nBen Shapiro, co-founder of the conservative media outlet Daily Wire, set the tone with the first speech after Erika Kirk opened the convention. He attacked fellow commentators in deeply personal terms, saying some of the right's most popular figures are morally bankrupt.\n\nCandace Owens “has been vomiting all sorts of hideous and conspiratorial nonsense into the public square for years,” he said.\n\nMegyn Kelly is “guilty of cowardice\" because she's refused to condemn Owens for spreading unsubstantiated theories about Kirk's death.\n\nAnd Tucker Carlson's decision to host antisemite Nick Fuentes on his podcast was “an act of moral imbecility.”\n\nBarely an hour later, Carlson took the same stage and mocked Shapiro’s attempt to “deplatform and denounce” people who disagree with him.\n\n“I watched it,” he said. “I laughed.”\n\nOthers had their chance the next night.\n\n“Ben Shapiro is like a cancer, and that cancer spreads,” said Steve Bannon, a former Trump adviser.\n\nKelly belittled Shapiro as a marginal figure in the conservative movement and said their friendship is over.\n\n“I resent that he thinks he’s in a position to decide who must say what, to whom, and when,” Kelly said.\n\nOwens, who has spread unsubstantiated conspiracy theories about Charlie Kirk's death, wasn't welcome at the convention. But she responded on her podcast, calling Shapiro a “miserable imp.\"\n\nA schism over Israel and antisemitism\n\nIsrael came up repeatedly during the conference.\n\nSome on the right have questioned whether the Republican Party's historically steadfast support for Israel conflicts with Trump's “America First” platform. Carlson criticized civilian deaths in Gaza in remarks that wouldn't have been out of place in progressive circles.\n\nSome attendees dug deep into history, highlighting Israel's attack on the USS Liberty off the Sinai Peninsula in 1967. Israel said it mistook the ship for an Egyptian vessel during the Six Day War, while critics have argued that it was a deliberate strike.\n\nBannon accused Shapiro, who is Jewish, and others who staunchly support Israel of being part of “the Israel first crowd.” Kelly said criticism from Shapiro and Bari Weiss, the newly installed head of CBS News, “is about Israel.\"\n\nVance gets a helpful endorsement\n\nErika Kirk pledged Turning Point’s support for Vice President JD Vance to be the next Republican presidential nominee.\n\n“We are going to get my husband’s friend JD Vance elected for 48 in the most resounding way possible,” she said on the first night of the convention. Vance would be the 48th president if he takes office after Trump.\n\nTurning Point is a major force on the right, with a massive volunteer network around the country that can be especially helpful in early primary states.\n\nVance was close with Charlie Kirk, whose backing helped enable his rapid political rise. The vice president is scheduled to close out the convention as the final speaker on Sunday.\n\nThe Make America Healthy Again movement had a big presence at Turning Point, signaling its quick rise in the right-wing ecosystem.\n\nMAHA is spearheaded by Robert F. Kennedy, who leads the Department of Health and Human Services. However, there has been friction with other parts of the Make America Great Again coalition, particularly when it comes to rolling back environmental regulations.\n\nWellness influencer Alex Clark, whose podcast is sponsored by Turning Point, asked the crowd whether the Environmental Protection Agency is “with us or against us?”\n\n“Big chemical, big ag and big food are trying to split MAGA from MAHA so things can go back to business as usual, but we don’t want that, do we?” Clark said.\n\nClark and others have asked for Trump to fire EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, who responded by reaching out to MAHA activists. The EPA also said it would release a MAHA agenda for the agency.\n\n“The Trump EPA wants to partner with the MAHA community and make sure everyone has a seat at the table,” EPA press secretary Carolyn Holran said in response to Clark's speech.",

It riffs on everything from Ken Burns-style narration, including an abrupt firing of Burns himself in favor of some \"pizzazz,\" to execs dancing their way through \"Dirty Dancing\"-style choreography.\n\nExecutives portraying the firm's mid-life crisis include one who wears a nose ring and others who want to buy sports teams or Ferrari (the company). Cameos include actor Danny DeVito pitching jargon-filled investment products, as well as Goldman Sachs CEO (and side-hustling DJ) David Solomon.\n\nThe seven-and-a-half-minute video concludes with Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman and President Jon Gray in a parody of the \"Back to the Future\" movie.\n\nBlackstone is no stranger to quirky holiday videos. In fact, this was their 8th in a row (see where this year's video lands in BI's power ranking).\n\nYou might be wondering: Why does Blackstone spend so much time, effort, and money on such a thing, especially when few other financial firms do? Apollo produced its own holiday video in 2022, but this year the private-equity firm appears to have pivoted to publishing.\n\nBlackstone produced its first holiday video in 2018 as a replacement for its New York holiday party, as the firm had grown too large. Earlier this month, at a conference, Gray said the video was a way for the world's largest private investor to \"make fun of ourselves.\"\n\nBlackstone's video ends on a poignant note in memory of Wesley LePatner, a Blackstone executive who was killed in the tragic summer shooting at the firm's NYC headquarters.

    "title": "The mayor of a New York City suburb says building apartments on parking lots near train and bus stations is a key to reining in rent",
    "description": "New Rochelle Mayor Yadira Ramos-Herbert talked with Business Insider about how her NYC suburb is building lots of new housing and keeping costs down.",
    "fullText": "In a year full of abundance discourse, New Rochelle Mayor Yadira Ramos-Herbert is living the abundance agenda.\n\nThe skyline of her Westchester County city, just 20 miles north of Manhattan, is barely recognizable from a decade ago. New apartment and condo towers have shot up, the city's population is booming, and rents and home prices haven't risen nearly as fast as in other cities in the region and across the US.\n\nThe city plans to fulfill its goal of adding 11,000 units in about 32 buildings in several years, growing the city's housing stock by 37%, according to the Wall Street Journal. The mayor told Business Insider the city is about two-thirds of the way to its goal.\n\nAnd the efforts are showing signs of success. Median rents in New Rochelle rose by just 7% between 2017 and 2023, according to a Pew analysis of Apartment List data. That's compared to a 31% median rent increase nationwide.\n\nOver the last decade, the city has supercharged housing construction by overhauling zoning laws, streamlining environmental review, and offering new tax breaks to developers. The city has focused on revitalizing its downtown by building homes on underutilized commercial and parking lots near rail and bus stations.\n\n\"We weren't tearing down homes. We weren't tearing down existing apartment buildings,\" Ramos-Herbert said in an interview this fall with Business Insider. \"We were just leveraging underutilized sites and catalyzing them through the development.\"\n\nThe new homes don't just impact New Rochelle's 85,000 residents. They have implications for the entire region, which is suffering from one of the most severe housing shortages in the country. New York City relies on its suburbs to house a big portion of its workers and absorb a steady stream of people leaving the five boroughs.\n\nWhile the Big Apple builds less housing per capita than most other major cities in the US, many of its suburbs have an even more dismal record. Between 2010 and 2021, the New York suburbs approved just 13 new homes for every 1,000 residents — about half the rate of the Big Apple.\n\nThere's been some opposition to all the new construction in New Rochelle among locals. There are concerns about traffic, lack of parking, and noise from construction sites. But her constituents also worry that the shiny towers are being filled with transplants, rather than New Rochelle locals in need of affordable housing.\n\nThe mayor said that gentrification concerns are overblown. She noted that 22% of the residents in the new housing are from New Rochelle, and 21% are from surrounding towns in Westchester County. That's compared to 33% who've come from New York City. The new units have given locals a smaller home to downsize to, or a way to shorten their commute by living within walking distance of an Amtrak and Metro-North rail station, she said.\n\n\"These are not strangers. These are our friends. These are your kids' friends,\" she said. \"These are your parents.\"\n\nThe city has been hailed as a model for communities that need to boost housing production amid severe affordability challenges. New Rochelle isn't alone in the region — Jersey City has also built housing at a rapid clip in recent years, becoming another model for YIMBYs to point to.\n\nRamos-Herbert's advice to other cities and communities: start by building transit-oriented development on underutilized commercial plots.\n\nShe also touted the critical income the new housing and residents bring in for the city through property taxes and sales tax, allowing it to invest in infrastructure and programs that benefit everyone. She pointed to the $100 million renovation of the city's train station and the transformation of a highway that divides a historically Black neighborhood into a linear park and local road.\n\n\"You can only tax so much,\" she said. \"We have to kind of create, ensure, proactive creation of alternative revenue streams to support us.\"",

    "title": "'Every day something's coming down the pipe': How the CEO of Booking Holdings responds to a crisis",
    "description": "Booking Holdings CEO Glenn Fogel told Business Insider that the company's experience navigating crises helps it respond to new challenges.",
    "fullText": "Many companies have navigated recent economic and geopolitical uncertainties — but the CEO of travel conglomerate Booking Holdings has faced a steady stream of crises over the last two decades.\n\nTo name a few: the dot-com bubble, 9/11, the 2008 market crash, SARS-1, volcanoes, tsunamis, the pandemic, tariffs, and various wars. CEO Glenn Fogel told Business Insider there's something happening in the world every day.\n\n\"Every day something's coming down the pipe,\" Fogel said.\n\nPart of dealing with a crisis involves planning in advance whenever possible. For example, Fogel explained that when tensions started to heat up between Russia and Ukraine, a region where the company operates, they began to prepare contingency plans \"just in case.\"\n\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine became public just hours after the company's earnings call in February 2022. As the situation developed, Booking Holdings supported employees abroad and navigated expected sanctions. That led to the company's decision to suspend travel services in Russia and Belarus in March 2022, the company said.\n\nFogel, who's been with the company for over 25 years, isn't a stranger to navigating complicated situations. He outlined his crisis response approach, starting with the people he keeps on speed dial to how he manages stress.\n\nWhen a crisis arises, Fogel said the first people he contacts are the company's executive officers, including the general counsel, chief financial officer, and chief HR officer.\n\nNext, he works to identify the problem and which part of the business it affects. As a global travel conglomerate, Fogel said issues can impact different regions in different ways.\n\nThe CEO added that the company's long history of navigating challenges has helped it respond effectively when new problems arise. He said he reminds himself that there is an end to every crisis. For example, with COVID, he said he didn't know when a vaccine would come out, but he knew one eventually would.\n\n\"It helps you've already been through a lot before,\" Fogel said. \"It's not the first rodeo.\"\n\nWhen it comes to managing the stress of the job, Fogel said he practices meditation.\n\n\"I'd like to do it every day,\" Fogel said.\n\nHe said his other non-negotiable is exercise, which he always does before work nearly every day. Fogel does light weightlifting year-round and swims in the summer.\n\nEven when he's traveling — which is more often than he's home, he said — he makes time for a workout at his hotel, squeezing in email responses during lower-intensity sessions.",

    "description": "Corporate types are waiting weeks for — and spending big on — alloClae, which cuts out the recovery time typically associated with body enhancements.",
    "fullText": "In his plush Upper East Side office earlier this year, Dr. Sachin Shridharani was at work on a patient's breasts: applying a local anesthesia, making an incision, ensuring the final result sat just right.\n\nThrough it all, his patient — an executive — had her AirPods in. She was on a conference call with a client, Shridharani told Business Insider. Less than two hours after she walked in, she popped up, checked out her new physique, and dashed off to her office.\n\nAs recently as a year ago, a typical boob job would have involved general anesthesia and a multiday recovery.\n\nBut Shridharani was using alloClae, a new product from manufacturer Tiger Aesthetics that's becoming increasingly popular with patients eager to look their best in the boardroom without undergoing general anesthesia or taking days off for recovery.\n\nRather than relying on an implant or a patient's own body fat to add volume to hips or augment breasts, alloClae — which can cost as much as $100,000 per procedure — uses donor fat from a cadaver as a first-of-its-kind body filler.\n\n\"People are paying for the convenience,\" Shridharani, who has done more than 50 procedures with alloClae and was part of its trial, said. \"It's about not having the downtime, not needing more aggressive procedures, not having an anesthetic.\"\n\nBusiness Insider spoke to a half dozen plastic surgeons, largely based in New York and California, who, together, have completed around 75 procedures with alloClae since it became available earlier this year. They described wealthy executives and corporate types clamoring for the product, booking 6 a.m. visits so they could make it to work by 7, and using the filler to look better in their suits — work, not swim, that is. Demand for alloClae has outpaced supply, resulting in a shortage and backlog of appointments.\n\nWhile many of their alloClae patients are high-ranking professionals looking for a quick zhuzh, there are several other reasons people opt for the product. Some lack sufficient body fat for a typical transfer collected through liposuction. Others don't want the loose skin that can be associated with lipo. Some simply don't want to deal with anesthesia.\n\nTake Gretchen Seal, the 57-year-old CFO at global telecommunications company Convo Relay, who got alloClae in September to smooth out the edge of a breast implant and used extra product to fill out hip dips. The numbing took longer than the procedure itself, which clocked in under 40 minutes, she said.\n\n\"I got in my car, and I drove straight home from the procedure, and I went to work,\" Seal said.\n\nEven with the hip enhancement, she spent the afternoon sitting comfortably at her desk.\n\nThe rise in GLP-1s has contributed to the alloClae fervor. It's not only Ozempic face — it's deflated Ozempic boobs, hips, butt.\n\nShridharani has male patients who have lost weight on the likes of Ozempic, only to find they don't quite fill out their suits the way they used to.\n\n\"In their own words, 'I've got no ass,'\" he said. \"'My trousers look like they're falling off.'\"\n\nIn a workforce that prioritizes appearances — studies have shown more attractive people get paid more — alloClae is becoming the C-suite's secret weapon.\n\nalloClae is part of a larger boom in less-invasive cosmetic procedures.\n\nThe annual number of minimally invasive procedures, from Botox to lip fillers, is growing faster than surgical cosmetic procedures, reaching over 28 million last year, according to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.\n\n\"It was all about the lunchtime Botox procedure,\" Caroline Van Hove, the president of Tiger Aesthetics, said. \"That is still the appeal of medically aesthetic products that are minimally invasive, meaning you have little downtime.\"\n\nTiger Aesthetics, which also provides implants and traditional fillers, began offering alloClae to a select group of doctors in the fall of 2024, followed by a soft rollout to a few hundred surgeons this past spring, and a full launch that's planned early next year, Van Hove said. The company didn't disclose how many patients have used the product.\n\nWhile alloClae comes from a cadaver, the product is less macabre than you may think, and even patients who may be turned off by the whole dead body thing typically come around to it, Dr. Bob Basu, the president of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, said.\n\nWhen individuals donate their bodies for science, such as organ donations, tissue banks often collect abdominal fat cells. Tiger Aesthetics purchases that fat, screens it for diseases, purifies it, and processes it. By the end, it looks like clumpy butter in a syringe.\n\nThe process means Tiger Aesthetics is \"at the mercy of donated tissue,\" Van Hove said. The company aims to increase its intake of donor fat as it expands its manufacturing facilities and is exploring ways to improve tissue yields, she said.\n\n\"As of the beginning of 2026, we'll be producing a ton more alloClae so that we can service the real demand that's out there,\" Van Hove said.\n\nalloClae is regulated by the FDA. Van Hove said the approval process differs from that of implants or medications like Botox, as it's sold under a different designation.\n\nWhile other products that use donor fat exist, alloClae is unique in its composition and the volume in which it is administered. Most patients use between 50 and 100 CCs, Van Hove said, though doctors that Business Insider spoke with have used as much as 550 CCs on a patient. By comparison, Renuva, a donor fat product made by MTF Biologics, is typically dispensed in much smaller quantities and used on the face. (alloClae is not recommended for the face.)\n\nalloClae's convenience comes at a cost, depending on how much donor fat you want.\n\nDoctors said the procedures, including the doctor's fees and the price of the alloClae itself, can cost a customer between $10,000 and $100,000. If a patient gets 100 or 200 CCs — enough for a slight contour of the hip or filling out of the breast — the cost is pretty much in line with the cost of a typical fat transfer, Shridharani said. More than that, the steep cost of alloClae quickly adds up.\n\nWhere a typical breast augmentation with an implant at an upscale office like Shridharani's would start at $15,000, a minor breast adjustment using alloClae starts at $12,000 and could exceed $30,000 depending on the desired volume.\n\n\"The thing that shocks me a little bit is just how expensive the product is, but still the willingness of patients to pay for it,\" said San Francisco-based plastic surgeon Dr. David Sieber, who hasn't yet injected alloClae but has patients waiting for the product.\n\nThat willingness comes even without long-term, proven results.\n\nSo far, the doctors who spoke with Business Insider have said the initial results are promising, but as Basu said, there's been no three- or five-year follow-up yet.\n\nThe procedures he has done with alloClae are all \"subtle refinements,\" he said. \"It is not go big or go home.\"\n\nDouglas Steinbrech, who has medical practices for men in New York City, Beverly Hills, and Chicago, has a term he uses at the office: \"C-level surgery.\" C as in C-suite — and among that crowd, alloClae has been graded A+.\n\n\"The CEOs, COOs, CCOs that don't want to be away from the boardroom,\" Steinbrech told Business Insider. He has primarily had men get alloClae put in their shoulders and chests.\n\n\"They have to go to a lot of meetings that just pop up, and they cannot control when they're going to happen. They can't just clear their schedule to recover for a surgery,\" he added.\n\nOften, patients return to the office the same day as their procedure, or get the injection in the afternoon and go back the next morning.\n\nFor Seal, the CFO, liposuction was never a viable option because she doesn't have enough fat to transfer. When she learned that a breast lift surgery to fix her implant would necessitate weeks without getting on a plane to avoid blood clots, she knew it would never work with her job.\n\n\"My schedule changes so much,\" she said. \"I hop on planes to Silicon Valley, I go to New York, Washington.\"\n\nThat's when her plastic surgeon suggested alloClae. If she could bear the monthlong wait, she could get 100 CCs of the product — and none of the downtime.\n\n\"It worked beautifully,\" she said. \"I feel much more confident.\"\n\nDoctors say patients now come in asking for it by name — though it can be hard to find. Van Hove said the product is sold out until the end of January.\n\nBut good things come to those who wait. Dr. Adam Schaffner, who has had dozens of patients express interest in alloClae, was celebrating on the day he spoke to Business Insider — 400 CCs of the product had just been delivered to his New York City office.",

    "description": "Baz Costello, 48, plans to start his own company after struggling to find a tech job. He said one employer said he was \"too senior.\"",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Baz Costello, 48, who lives in Brighton and Hove, UK. He recently decided to start his own company after growing frustrated with his job search. The following has been edited for brevity and clarity.\n\nI was a consultant for a big digital consultancy up until November last year. I worked there as both a product lead and was also the chair of the neurodiversity employee resource group.\n\nAt the start of this year, I went back to contracting, and then I learned I had prostate cancer. It was stage one, and I was on active monitoring for six months. I did some more contracting up until July, when I was told I needed to have treatment. So, I had treatment, and all the signs were good. In August, I thought, \"OK, I can start looking to go back to work.\"\n\nI spoke to some recruitment agencies and public-sector IT consultancies I had worked with before, and one of the things I picked up from that — and from searching on job boards — was that the number of roles had decreased.\n\nWhen it comes to looking for work, LinkedIn becomes your daily go-to tool. For someone with ADHD, it's a double-edged sword. You can set up filters and get told when new jobs are coming up. But it's also this meandering pathway of links that you can disappear down for hours and hours. It can become another doomscrolling mechanism. I'm guilty of doing a lot of that.\n\nI noticed a slow but steady increase in posts about \"I've been out of work for six months\" and \"I'm going to have to sell my house. I don't know how I'm going to look after my kids.\" The negativity — it impacts you.\n\nAt one point, I got a message on LinkedIn from a recruiter who worked for a digital-transformation company who said, \"We think you'd be suited for this role.\" It was for a senior project manager. I had two video interviews. Both went really well, but one of the things I noticed was that executives were a lot younger than me.\n\nI then got an email back asking to meet for 30 minutes with the practice lead. It felt like a check for cultural fit. She seemed to be a bit younger than me. We seemed to hit off pretty well. We talked about what I wanted from the role and what I could offer. Then, a couple of days later, the company said, \"You're too senior.\"\n\nYou cannot discriminate against someone because of their age, but it happens in myriad ways. \"Too senior\" is one of them. So is \"too much experience.\" I asked for feedback and was told, \"I wasn't sure that this would be fulfilling for you.\" I thought, \"How condescending. You approached me about this role, and I've read the job description, and we spoke at length about the role with three people. Not once have I said, 'This is beneath me.'\"\n\nAgeism is hidden in things like \"This is a dynamic, fast-paced work environment\" or \"This is a work-hard, play-hard environment.\" You take that to mean that on Friday afternoon, when we finish early, and all go down the pub, we don't want people who have to go pick up their kids. It's hidden, but it's still there.\n\nI'm 48. The problem is I look older. I'm Father Christmas in training. It's gotten to the point where I've had interviews and thought, \"Should I dye my hair? Should I wear a hat? Should I do something to try to look younger? Experience shouldn't be something you have to hide.\n\nI'm going to start my own thing. I have a concept for an app. I've been speaking with some non-executive directors and entrepreneurial advisors, getting advice and putting a strategy together. I have a background in product and technology. I can just bloody do this myself.\n\nI'm coming off LinkedIn because I need a bit more positivity. The promise I've made to myself is that the day I return, my first post will be, \"I am the founder of this thing, and I've come back to recruit. If you're too old, I want your experience. If you're too neurodiverse, I want your alternative perspective.\"\n\nDo you have a story to share about your job search? Contact this reporter at tparadis@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "TikTok's new US joint venture will hand over national-security related tasks to its partners, while ByteDance holds onto key business lines.",
    "fullText": "Is TikTok really selling its US business? Kind of.\n\nTikTok has reached an agreement that would give it a new set of owners in the US as part of a joint-venture agreement. Larry Ellison's Oracle, Abu Dhabi investment firm MGX, and private-equity firm Silver Lake are all coming on as managing investors in the US spin-off.\n\nBut how much influence will these investors have over the money-making side of the business? Not much, according to an internal memo TikTok CEO Shou Chew sent to employees on Thursday, viewed by Business Insider.\n\nThe new investors will focus on national security-related tasks, such as data management and algorithm training, while TikTok's current owner, ByteDance, will remain in charge of key business lines, including e-commerce and advertising.\n\nHere's what Chew told staff about the arrangement:\n\nAs laid out by Chew, TikTok's new investors aren't going to be in the driver's seat on core business lines like TikTok Shop or ad sales, even if they may still participate in the profits of the business. TikTok global, which will remain under ByteDance, will still run the show.\n\n\"Advertisers will continue to connect with global audiences with no impact,\" Chew also wrote in the memo.\n\nThe setup, which focuses a lot more on national security-related concerns than business tasks, may be why the White House said in September the deal would be valued at $14 billion, far lower than the $50 billion estimate from Morningstar analysts in June. My colleague Peter Kafka previously dug into the TikTok valuation question.\n\nIn the proposed structure of the deal, which Chew said should close in late January, Oracle, Silver Lake, and MGX will get a combined 45% stake in the US joint venture. Affiliates of existing ByteDance investors will grab around 30% ownership, and an unnamed group of new investors will take 5%.\n\nByteDance will maintain ownership of just under 20% of the US business, but retain oversight of the rest of the world and manage TikTok US's e-commerce, advertising, and marketing strategies.\n\nThat sounds like a pretty good setup for a company that spent much of 2024 and 2025 fighting to keep its US business alive after Congress passed a law forcing it to sell its US app or face a potential ban.\n\nThe question of who will actually be in charge of different parts of the business is paramount to employees at TikTok and ByteDance. Will they get a new boss or organizational structure after an agreement closes?\n\n\"Even though there's a deal, it doesn't say concretely yet what it means for us,\" one TikTok staffer said. They added that they weren't anticipating much change.\n\nTikTok, ByteDance, and MGX did not respond to requests for comment. Oracle and Silver Lake declined to comment.",

    "description": "London Business School professor Ekaterina Abramova said that rapid AI disruption could outpace institutions and destabilize societies.",
    "fullText": "A historic labor shock may be about to hit the job market.\n\nThat's according to London Business School professor Ekaterina Abramova.\n\nShe said AI is advancing so quickly that it could trigger mass layoffs long before new jobs emerge to replace them — a mismatch that has historically fueled social unrest.\n\nAbramova, who studies technology-driven economic transitions, said the past three years of AI advances mark a sharp break from earlier waves of mechanization.\n\nIn past eras — from 18th-century textile automation to late-20th-century manufacturing decline — the impact was mostly gradual and largely contained to individual sectors, she said.\n\nBut AI is different: \"A single AI model can displace thousands of cognitive jobs across multiple industries overnight,\" she told Business Insider.\n\nAbramova expects layoffs to outstrip new job creation over the next five to 10 years, especially without aggressive retraining efforts.\n\nWhile the exact number of AI-related layoffs is unknown, several major companies have already cited AI as a reason to reduce head count or to announce job cuts.\n\nNew AI-related roles often require skills or credentials that many displaced workers lack, Abramova said, and entry-level positions — such as junior developers, analysts, and customer support staff — are already among the most vulnerable.\n\nPeter Orszag, CEO of Lazard and former director of the Office of Management and Budget under President Obama, sees a similar risk.\n\nSpeaking on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" this week, Orszag said that if AI delivers on its promise, there's likely to be a jobs crisis.\n\n\"Labor markets deal well with small problems that happen fast or big problems that happen slow. They do not deal well with big shocks that happen quickly,\" he said.\n\nAbramova said that the social risks extend far beyond unemployment numbers.\n\n\"History shows social strain emerges when the pace of economic change overtakes institutions' capacity to support displaced workers,\" she said.\n\nShe pointed to the UK's Enclosure Acts, which displaced tens of thousands of small farmers from common land, sparking riots and mass migration, and to the 1980s coal pit closures, which wiped out mining communities almost overnight and triggered years of strikes and political upheaval.\n\nBusiness leaders are divided over AI's impact on jobs, with Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei and Ford CEO Jim Farley warning of widespread white-collar displacement, while Elon Musk, JP Morgan's Jamie Dimon, and OpenAI's Sam Altman have predicted varying outcomes, ranging from significant disruption to long-term prosperity.\n\nOthers, such as Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Yann LeCun — Meta's outgoing chief AI scientist — say AI will transform work rather than erase it.\n\n\"It's very likely that the companies that use AI first, that use robotics technology first, will be the most successful first, and they will end up hiring more people,\" Huang said in late October.\n\n\"You're going to lose your job not to somebody — not to a robot, you're going to lose your job to somebody who uses a robot. You're going to lose your job to somebody who uses AI,\" he added.\n\nIf governments and employers fail to prepare, Abramova said she expects widening inequality, persistent unemployment, falling consumer demand, rising political anger, and even expanding surveillance as leaders try to contain discontent.\n\nIn extreme cases, she warned, democratic norms can erode.\n\nBut she also said that the worst outcomes aren't inevitable.\n\nThe alternative is worker-augmenting AI: systems where machines handle data-intensive tasks while humans retain judgment, ethics, and client relationships. That shift will require regulatory incentives that reward firms for responsible oversight, not just rapid headcount reduction.\n\n\"Without major support,\" Orszag said, \"many displaced workers risk long-term underemployment.\"",

    "fullText": "AI is pushing consultants to their biggest-ever talent overhaul.\n\nAs firms shift from slide decks and advisory work to multi-year AI-driven transformation projects, the profile of the ideal consultant at firms like Boston Consulting Group, McKinsey, and PwC is changing.\n\n\"Going to a client and purely proposing an army of consultants doesn't really work anymore,\" Gert De Geyter, a former AI lead at Deloitte US, told Business Insider.\n\nInstead of the \"pure traditional consultant,\" firms are now looking for a blend of \"generalists and technical experts,\" said De Geyter, who left the firm in July to join AI startup Teragonia.\n\nBusiness Insider spoke to nine executives and industry insiders to understand how consulting firms are hiring, retraining, and redefining their workforces to meet the moment.\n\nThe work that consultants do is changing. Straight advisory projects are being replaced with building, implementing, and maintaining tools for companies, requiring technology expertise over research skills.\n\nHiring data reveals how aggressively top firms have been expanding their technologist ranks. Accenture's latest annual report shows it added nearly 40,000 AI and data professionals in the last two years. They now account for roughly 10% of its global head count. EY has added 61,000 technologists since 2023, according to its latest annual report.\n\nAt McKinsey, the \"AI engineer\" is the fastest-growing non-entry-level role, followed by procurement officer, data scientist, and software engineer, according to workforce intelligence company Revelio Labs.\n\nAt Boston Consulting Group, software engineers, frontend developers, and Python developers are the fastest-growing entry-level roles.\n\nBCG, which brought on 1,000 employees last year, has ramped up hiring technologists since launching its tech and AI arm, BCG X, in late 2022.\n\n\"We're essentially building a tech company inside a consulting firm,\" said Sylvain Duranton, Global Leader of BCG X. \"Our job has always been to help companies transform. But tech has become so critical to transformation that we needed to have a grip on it ourselves.\"\n\nIts regular consulting division is also adopting a more tech-centric mentality.\n\nScott Wilder, a BCG partner and managing director, told Business Insider that a new team, called \"forward deployed consultants,\" is rising through the ranks. It takes inspiration from a software engineering role popularized by Palantir, Wilder said.\n\nThese consultants are vibe-coding and building tools on client projects, he said. When one of these tools is a hit, it goes back to the R&D team and becomes a broader tool that everyone can use.\n\nFor firms like McKinsey and BCG, the must-have hire in the AI era isn't a pure engineer or a pure consultant — it's someone who can move between both worlds.\n\n\"What we want to be able to do is find those people that actually have a propensity to either be this great McKinsey consultant, and or a great technologist, and then groom them to be both,\" Alex Singla, a senior partner at McKinsey who co-leads its AI arm, QuantumBlack, told Business Insider.\n\nHe added that candidates also want hybrid roles: Many don't want to spend years building products for a cloud company like AWS, nor do they want to be traditional consultants.\n\nSingla said McKinsey is looking for \"5Xers — they're deep in one thing, but can do three or four different things well.\"\n\nQuantumBlack, with its 1,700-person team, drives all of McKinsey's AI initiatives, which account for 40% of the firm's work, but McKinsey's technical talent isn't limited to that group, Singla said. There are about 3,500 people building internal technology for McKinsey, and another 4,000 to 5,000 consultants who are leading the technical work from the business side, but don't necessarily have technical expertise.\n\nThe consulting talent landscape has been in flux since the pandemic, when a surge in demand prompted top firms to aggressively staff up. As that boom faded and demand for advisory work slowed, many firms found themselves overstaffed, triggering layoffs and a more selective approach to hiring.\n\nAmid the shifting market, the traditional pyramid model — built on large cohorts of junior consultants — started to recalibrate as firms focused on roles that deliver value over manpower. That focus has only sharpened with the rise of AI, prompting firms to invest heavily in upskilling their existing workforces.\n\n\"Everyone is reckoning with the fact that AI has exploded onto the scene,\" Saurabh Sarbaliya, PwC's AI Lead, told Business Insider.\n\n\"The demand for people who can make AI work in the enterprise is only going to grow — but there just aren't enough experts. So you have to focus on upskilling your existing workforce,\" he said.\n\nAt KPMG, Sam Gloede, the firm's global trusted AI leader, said it is prioritizing upskilling over hiring.\n\n\"There is not a massive change in our workforce,\" Gloede said. \"It's just a focus on upskilling, literacy, and learning.\"\n\nEY is taking a similar approach and prioritizing the AI capabilities of its employees, Imgard Naudin ten Cate, EY's global leader of talent acquisition, told Business Insider.\n\nIn October, EY held a two-week learning event to teach employees to build AI agents for use in their day-to-day work. The firm has also rolled out 15-hour courses on topics including AI engineering, applied AI, and AI compliance.\n\nNearly 100,000 employees — roughly a quarter of the workforce — have earned a digital \"AI badge\" for completing one of the courses, said Simon Brown, EY's global learning and development leader. The initiative has been \"a phenomenal way at scale to build deep AI knowledge,\" he added.\n\nTechnologist roles are in high demand, but don't expect a team of hoodie-wearing Silicon Valley types when your company hires consultants. Most in the industry are still generalists with strong problem-solving and communication skills — and they'll likely show up in a suit.\n\nEven as firms hire more technologists, most consulting work still doesn't require deep engineering expertise. Traditional consulting roles at top firms are still on the rise, growing from 250,000 globally in 2022 to 340,000 in 2024, according to Revelio Labs.\n\n\"A lot of the clients are still just dipping their toes in the AI pond, so over-engineering solutions for them doesn't work,\" said de Geyter, the former AI lead at Deloitte US. \"It's a lot more helpful that someone supports them with setting up the right data governance so they can get ready for AI solutions down the line.\"\n\nA senior software engineer at Deloitte, who requested anonymity as they are not permitted to speak to the media, told Business Insider that the technical literacy of most employees is improving, but remains in a \"very nascent state.\"\n\n\"They're looking less for people who know the inners of how these black box models work or could train one themselves, and more at people who can quickly leverage them for a specific solution set,\" the person said.\n\nStill, they warned that the current skill level poses a strategic risk: \"We can't let it continue for too long.\"\n\nJim Rowan, head of AI at Deloitte US, told Business Insider that its employees have \"the latest technologies and certifications to effectively work with machines and unlock even more impactful business outcomes for clients.\" Deloitte is not just hiring more data engineers and technologists, but \"actively investing\" in upskilling its workforce, Rowan said.\n\nSeveral leaders told Business Insider that soft skills are becoming more relevant now that AI can perform specific quantitative tasks.\n\n\"When we get asked a question of what we are looking for when we recruit, the core fundamental thing is actually attitude,\" Niale Cleobury, KPMG's AI workforce lead, said. Communication, collaboration, and agile learning — \"the sort of things AI can't really do\" — are the standout qualities, he said.\n\nMcKinsey is still active on college campuses recruiting undergraduates, MBAs, and PhDs, said Kate Smaje, McKinsey's global leader of technology and AI.\n\nIn its screening process, McKinsey emphasizes elements of judgment and conceptual thinking in problem-solving, resilience, and the ability to learn quickly.\n\nThe ability to build relationships and the core EQ leadership qualities can be \"fairy dust\" on top of what you can do analytically that will now set you apart, said Smaje.\n\n\"What we really hire for is voracious learners, people who are curious about the world and have the ability to learn, unlearn, and relearn,\" she said. \"Those are the people we really want.\"\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "A source in the Security Service of Ukraine told Business Insider that the attack was carried out more than 1,240 miles away.",
    "fullText": "Ukrainian forces used long-range drones to strike an oil tanker said to be part of Russia's \"shadow fleet\" in the Mediterranean Sea for the first time, a security source told Business Insider on Friday.\n\nThe attack, carried out over 1,240 miles from Ukrainian territory, represents a dramatic expansion of Kyiv's push to target Russia's vast energy sector, a key source of revenue fueling its war machine.\n\nUkraine had previously limited its attacks to land-based targets, such as oil refineries and port infrastructure. In recent weeks, though, it has begun striking tankers in the Black Sea and facilities in the Caspian Sea — and now it's hitting targets in the Mediterranean.\n\nA source in the Security Service of Ukraine, the SBU, called the drone attack an \"unprecedented special operation\" that targeted and critically damaged the tanker Qendil. The source was only authorized to speak on the condition of anonymity to discuss military developments.\n\nThe SBU source said the Qendil wasn't carrying any oil cargo at the time of the attack, so there isn't any risk to the environment. Footage shows several explosions on the exterior of the tanker.\n\nPublicly available ship-tracking data show that the Qendil was sailing under the flag of Oman. It's unclear when the attack took place; the vessel last reported its location on Friday sailing off the coast of Libya in the eastern Mediterranean.\n\nNeither Russia's defense ministry nor its US embassy immediately responded to a request for comment on the attack.\n\nUkraine has attacked at least four tankers, including the Qendil, that have been identified as belonging to the \"shadow fleet\" since late November. There are hundreds of vessels in the fleet, which Moscow relies on to transport oil and circumvent sanctions on its energy exports.\n\nRussia used the Qendil \"to circumvent sanctions and earn money that went to the war against Ukraine,\" the SBU source said in translated remarks shared with Business Insider, calling the ship a \"legitimate target\" for the SBU.\n\nThe enemy must understand that Ukraine will not stop and will beat him anywhere in the world, wherever he is,\" they added.\n\nSince August, Ukraine has stepped up its use of long-range drone strikes to target Russian energy infrastructure in an effort to squeeze a key source of revenue for Moscow. While the campaign initially focused on land-based facilities, Kyiv has recently expanded it to maritime targets, hitting oil tankers in the Black and Mediterranean seas and striking three oil platforms in the Caspian Sea.\n\nThe expansion to maritime targets appears to reflect a shift in Kyiv's strategy as it continues to press its international partners to be more aggressive in clamping down on Russian oil exports.\n\nUkrainian officials have described the ongoing deep-strike campaign as \"long-range\" sanctions against Moscow. These operations have been a bright spot for Kyiv as it faces incremental — but costly — Russian gains on the battlefield.",

    "description": "TikTok has reached a deal to sell parts of its US business. Oracle, Silver Lake, and MGX are part of the consortium of new investors.",
    "fullText": "Who's grabbing control of TikTok's US assets?\n\nOn Thursday, TikTok told staffers it had signed a deal to form a joint venture for its US business with a group of investors, according to an internal memo sent by CEO Shou Chew, which was viewed by Business Insider. The company expects the deal to close in late January, per the memo.\n\nThree managing investors will each hold a 15% stake in the new venture: Oracle, private equity firm Silver Lake, and Abu Dhabi-based investment firm MGX.\n\nFive percent of the US company will go to an unnamed group of new investors, while ByteDance, TikTok's owner, will maintain a 19.9% minority stake — the maximum allowed by the divest-or-ban law that spurred TikTok's sale. The remaining 30.1% will be controlled by an undisclosed group of existing ByteDance investors, according to the memo.\n\nIn September, President Donald Trump said Larry Ellison and his company, Oracle, would be involved in a $14 billion deal to buy TikTok's US business. At the time, Trump mentioned billionaires Rupert Murdoch and Michael Dell would also play a role, but it is unclear if they are involved in the current deal.\n\nOracle, which currently works with TikTok on data security, is expected to continue to be its \"trusted security partner\" tasked with safeguarding \"sensitive US user data,\" Chew wrote in his memo to staffers.\n\nTikTok's new US owners will retrain the content recommendation algorithm on US user data \"to ensure the content feed is free from outside manipulation,\" per the memo.\n\nTikTok did not respond to requests for comment. The White House referred Business Insider to TikTok. A spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry, when asked about the deal, referred press to \"competent authorities for anything specific,\" noting that \"China's position on TikTok is consistent and clear.\"\n\nHere are the key players in TikTok's US business going forward:\n\nSoftware giant Oracle will take a 15% stake in TikTok's US joint venture, according to the memo viewed by Business Insider.\n\nPrior to the recent deal, Oracle was already working closely with TikTok's US Data Security division (USDS). Oracle has stored US TikTok users' data for years as a safeguard for potential data leaks.\n\nLarry Ellison, who is also a financial participant in a bidding war for Warner Bros. Discovery's business, is the chairman and cofounder of Oracle and a longtime Trump ally.\n\nMGX is a state-owned investment firm in Abu Dhabi.\n\nAccording to the internal memo, it will also take a 15% stake in the new TikTok entity as one of three managing investors.\n\nSheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, a member of Abu Dhabi's royal ruling family, is the firm's chairman. The fund participated in OpenAI's $6.6 billion investment round in 2024.\n\nMGX did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nSilver Lake is a tech-focused private equity firm.\n\nThe firm will take a 15% stake in the new TikTok entity, per the internal memo.\n\nIts current investments include Klarna, Carta, Dell Technologies, Genies, and Waymo, per the firm's website. Previous investments include Airbnb, Twitter, and Tesla.\n\nEgon Durban and Greg Mondre both act as co-CEO and managing partner at the private equity firm.\n\nSilver Lake declined to comment.\n\nAccording to the memo, \"affiliates of certain existing investors\" in ByteDance will hold a combined 30.1% of the new entity.\n\nPrivate equity giant KKR and venture capital firms, such as Sequoia Capital and SoftBank, have previously invested in ByteDance. It's not yet clear which of these investors will retain shares in the new US entity.\n\nSequoia Capital did not respond to a request for comment. KKR and SoftBank declined to comment.\n\nWhile 95% of ownership in the new TikTok US joint venture will fall under Oracle, Silver Lake, MGX, ByteDance, and its earlier investors, the remaining 5% stake will pass to an unnamed group of \"new investors,\" per TikTok's memo.\n\nTrump previously said that billionaires Michael Dell and Rupert Murdoch may be involved in the TikTok deal, so it's possible that they could fall within this mystery investor set.",

    "description": "Allyson Lopez had been hoping for business to bounce back at her dress shop in Chicago's Little Village neighborhood, which specializes in ballgowns for",
    "fullText": "CHICAGO, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Allyson Lopez had been hoping for business to bounce back at her dress shop in Chicago's Little Village neighborhood, which specializes in ballgowns for quinceaneras, a coming-of-age ritual in many Latino communities celebrating a girl's 15th birthday. Instead, this week brought the return of the federal immigration raids that have emptied the normally vibrant streets.\n\nThe first phase of the Department of Homeland Security deportation campaign, named \"Operation ​Midway Blitz,\" racked up over 4,200 arrests across the city in under three months. The operation rattled Chicago, but for Little Village, the working-class Mexican neighborhood that was repeatedly targeted, the effect has been catastrophic.\n\nThe return of roving U.S. ‌Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino on Tuesday in a large convoy of agents in camouflage, some with assault rifles peeking through car windows, was met by jeers and whistles from dozens of protesters who livestreamed the encounters on social media.\n\nAt Estela's Bridal, a second-generation family business, Lopez specializes in custom designs, which sell for ‌an average of $1,000. It can take 16 hours to make a dress, fitting the shimmering fabrics to size, and adding embroidered flowers, rhinestones and sequins. She said she lost 90% of her clients during the first wave of arrests as people decided to stay home out of fear of immigration agents.\n\nBUSINESS STRUGGLES TO MAKE RENT\n\n\"We’re going to suffer again as businesses,\" Lopez said. “We didn’t even make the rent this month, so it’s scary.\"\n\nA DHS spokesperson did not respond when asked about the impact of the raids on businesses.\n\nEven before Bovino's return, Little Village had been deflated by the raids.\n\nThe tourists who came to the \"Mexican Capital of the Midwest\" to eat tacos, sweet bread and tamales and to shop for quinceanera dresses, pinatas and Mexican chiles disappeared. Dozens of neighborhood residents were detained or deported, community leaders said. Others went ⁠into hiding.\n\n\"It's like those old Western movies where all you see is tumbleweeds blowing in ‌the breeze,” said Roxana, a 42-year-old hair salon owner from Guatemala. She declined to share her last name or immigration status out of fear of retaliation from immigration agents.\n\nIn her empty hair salon, with half the chairs wrapped in plastic, Roxana pulled back her neatly styled bangs to reveal patches of thinning hair, which she said started falling out from the stress of an 80% drop in revenue since ‍the start of the immigration enforcement campaign.\n\nAs the Border Patrol convoy descended on Little Village again this week, Roxana shuddered. The salon was open, but devoid of customers.\n\n\"They've broken into the neighborhood again,\" she said. \"It's definitely shocked and devastated us because it wasn't something that we were expecting.\"\n\nA NEIGHBORHOOD'S COMMERCIAL HEART\n\nRoxana's salon sits near the stucco arch that marks the beginning of 26th Street, a two-mile-long strip of shops, bakeries and restaurants that has become the second-most profitable shopping corridor in the city, according to the Little Village Chamber of Commerce. Many business owners said their savings dwindled ​after customers, including people who are in the U.S. legally, stopped visiting for fear of immigration officers.\n\nBefore the immigration crackdown, the shops selling elaborate ballgowns, glittering tiaras and satin flower bouquets, were joyous places, where girls giggled and twirled in their dresses ‌to the satisfaction of their mothers, shop owners said.\n\nBut anxiety over venturing outside – as well as fears that big parties could become targets for immigration enforcement – have hit Little Village’s quinceanera shops hard.\n\nTwo shop owners said they lost 90% of their revenue to the initial stages of Midway Blitz.\n\nEvelyn Flores, the owner of the Alborada quinceanera store, said she laid off seven staff members. “I can't sleep at night right now, and during the day I'm always freaking out.”\n\nMaria Ortiz, who owns a shop selling party supplies, said there are days when nobody walks into her store.\n\nFor one family, the aftershocks of the fall raids have lingered for weeks. Kamila, 15, said she has been afraid to leave her apartment other than to go to school after her cousin was detained by immigration agents in November while on his way to a job as a rug installer. He had been living in the U.S. for 18 years without legal status.\n\n“I’m scared. We can’t step outside because they might be waiting for us,\" she said.\n\nAsked for ⁠comment, Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, said: “There’s no reason to be afraid of law enforcement, unless you are breaking ​the law.\"\n\nThe cousin’s small apartment sits mostly as he left it - the bed unmade and his fluffy cream-colored dog, Peluchin, scampering through the apartment. Every day ​since his owner was detained, Peluchin pushes the dusty window blinds aside with his small snout to stare for hours at the street, waiting for him to return, a neighbor who comes by to walk him said.\n\n“All his dreams, all his effort, all his work – it’s here, empty,” said Sofia, Kamila’s mother and a 47-year-old housekeeper.\n\n“My daughter is 15 years old, she shouldn’t be living like this,” said Sofia, who came ‍to the U.S. from Mexico without legal status and is considering ⁠self-deporting. “There’s not a life here.”\n\nOn a recent afternoon, the Little Village Community Council hummed with overlapping voices as people coordinated school pick-ups, shared videos, and called family members of people who were detained.\n\nThe LVCC president, Baltazar Enriquez, has led local resistance to immigration enforcement, organizing patrols for federal agents and distributing plastic whistles now used across the city to warn of immigration agents in the area.\n\nThe tight-knit nature of “La Villita,” the Spanish name for Little Village, has given residents an ⁠organizing edge as they take to WhatsApp, Facebook and Signal groups to coordinate. Though Little Village has long struggled with bouts of gun violence and has the highest number of gang-related crimes in the city, residents said they felt safe before federal agents came to town.\n\nOther forms of resistance have been quieter – like Vicky Martinez, ‌a 55-year-old resident, who drops off groceries for friends and neighbors who are too scared to go to the store.\n\n\"It just feels like you're in prison. We don't even know what they're gonna throw at us,” ‌Martinez said.",

(AP) — A business jet crashed Thursday while trying to return to a North Carolina airport shortly after takeoff, killing all seven people aboard, including retired NASCAR driver Greg Biffle and his family, authorities said.\n\nThe Cessna C550 erupted into a large fire when it hit the ground. It had departed Statesville Regional Airport, about 45 miles (72 kilometers) north of Charlotte, but soon crashed while trying to return and land, the North Carolina State Highway Patrol said.\n\nFlight records show the plane was registered to a company run by Biffle. The cause of the crash wasn't immediately known, nor was the reason for the plane's return to the airport in drizzle and cloudy conditions.\n\nFederal Aviation Administration records show Biffle was rated to fly helicopters and single and multi-engine planes. It wasn't clear if Biffle was piloting the plane at the time of the crash.\n\nBiffle was on the plane with his wife, Cristina, and children Ryder, 5, and Emma, 14, according to the highway patrol and a family statement. Others on the plane were identified as Dennis Dutton, his son Jack, and Craig Wadsworth.\n\n“Each of them meant everything to us, and their absence leaves an immeasurable void in our lives,” the joint family statement said.\n\nBiffle, 55, won more than 50 races across NASCAR’s three circuits, including 19 at the Cup Series level. He also won the Trucks Series championship in 2000 and the Xfinity Series title in 2002.\n\nNASCAR said it was devastated by the news.\n\n“Greg was more than a champion driver; he was a beloved member of the NASCAR community, a fierce competitor, and a friend to so many,” NASCAR said. “His passion for racing, his integrity, and his commitment to fans and fellow competitors alike made a lasting impact on the sport.”\n\nThe plane, bound for Florida, took off from the Statesville airport shortly after 10 a.m., according to tracking data posted by FlightAware.com.\n\nGolfers playing next to the airport were shocked as they witnessed the disaster, even dropping to the ground at the Lakewood Golf Club while the plane was overhead. The ninth hole was covered with debris.\n\n“We were like, ‘Oh my gosh! That’s way too low,’” said Joshua Green of Mooresville. “It was scary.”\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board and the Federal Aviation Administration were investigating.\n\nThe Cessna plane, built in 1981, is a popular mid-sized business jet with an excellent reputation, aviation safety expert Jeff Guzzetti said. It has two engines and typically seats six to eight passengers and two pilots.\n\nIn 2024, Biffle was honored for his humanitarian efforts after Hurricane Helene struck the U.S., even using his personal helicopter to deliver aid to flooded, remote western North Carolina.\n\n“The last time I spoke with Cristina, just a couple of weeks ago, she reached out to ask how she could help with relief efforts in Jamaica. That’s who the Biffles were,\" U.S. Rep. Richard Hudson, a Republican from North Carolina, said.\n\nWadsworth was Biffle's friend and helped him with odd jobs, including delivering supplies to places hit by Hurricane Helene, roommate Benito Howell said.\n\n“He didn’t know how to say no,” Howell said of Wadsworth, who had worked for several NASCAR teams. “He loved everybody. He always tried to help everybody.”\n\nThe joint family statement also spoke about Dutton and his son Jack, saying they were \"deeply loved as well, and their loss is felt by all who knew them.\"\n\nWith 2025 almost over, there have been 1,331 U.S. crashes this year investigated by the NTSB, from two-seat planes to commercial aircraft, compared to a total of 1,482 in 2024.\n\nMajor air disasters around the world in 2025 include the plane-helicopter collision that killed 67 in Washington, the Air India crash that killed 260 in India, and a crash in Russia’s Far East that claimed 48 lives. Fourteen people, including 11 on the ground, died in a UPS cargo plane crash in Kentucky.\n\nRobertson reported from Raleigh, North Carolina.

    "fullText": "Deal will allow app to continue operating in US as Elizabeth Warren condemns Trump and his ‘billionaire buddies’\n\nTikTok has signed a deal to sell its US business to three American investors – Oracle, Silver Lake and MGX – ensuring the popular social video platform can continue operating in the United States.\n\nThe deal is expected to close on 22 January, according to an internal memo seen by he Associated Press and Reuters. The TikTok chief executive officer, Shou Zi Chew, said in the memo that ByteDance and TikTok have signed binding agreements with the three investors.\n\nThe new TikTok US joint venture will be 50% held by a consortium of new investors, including Oracle, Silver Lake and Abu Dhabi-based MGX with 15% each. Another 30.1% will be held by affiliates of existing ByteDance investors and 19.9% will be retained by ByteDance, according to the memo.\n\nWhite House officials have said Oracle, which was co-founded by Donald Trump’s supporter Larry Ellison, will license a copy of TikTok’s recommendation algorithm as part of the deal, in a partnership that will expand on Oracle’s existing management of TikTok’s trove of data collected about its US users.\n\nEllison’s role in the new ownership of the most popular social media platform in the US has raised concerns about the decreasing share of media firms not under the control of pro-Trump billionaires, with Ellison’s son David now driving wholesale changes at CBS, Elon Musk in control of X, formerly known as Twitter, Mark Zuckerberg overseeing both Instagram and Facebook, and Jeff Bezos owning the Washington Post.\n\n“First Paramount/CBS and now TikTok,” Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic senator from Massachusetts, wrote on Bluesky in response to the news. “Trump wants to hand over even more control of what you watch to his billionaire buddies. Americans deserve to know if the president struck another backdoor deal for this billionaire takeover of TikTok.”\n\nRush Doshi, who coordinated US government policy on China and Taiwan as a Biden National Security Council official, noted that there were “still some questions about who controls the algorithm. They say it will be trained on US data. Great, but has the algorithm been transferred, licensed, or is it still owned and controlled by Beijing – with Oracle merely providing ‘monitoring?’”\n\nThe agreement comes after a long delay. Trump said in September that he had spoken with China’s president over the phone about the deal and he had “a very good talk with president Xi” and “he gave us the go ahead”.\n\nIn October, the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, announced that the US and China had “reached a final deal on TikTok”.\n\nIn 2020, during his first presidency, Trump had threatened to ban TikTok in retaliation for China’s handling of Covid.\n\nCongress later passed a ban of the app over security concerns that was signed into law in April 2024 by Joe Biden. The ban was set to go into effect on 20 January 2025 but implementation was pushed back multiple times by Trump while his administration worked to develop a deal to transfer ownership.\n\nThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.\n\nIf you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.\n\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\n\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Shortly after takeoff, the jet turned back toward the airport and crashed while attempting to land, according to tracking data posted by FlightAware.com.\n\nVideo from WSOC-TV showed first responders rushing onto the runway, where flames burned near scattered wreckage.\n\nInvestigators have said it is too early to determine what caused the crash. There was some drizzle and clouds at the time, according to AccuWeather.\n\nStatesville Regional Airport offers corporate aviation facilities for Fortune 500 companies and several NASCAR teams, according to its website.\n\nAccording to a joint statement released by the victims' families, there were seven people aboard the plane, including Greg Biffle; his wife, Cristina Grossu Biffle; their son, Ryder; and Greg Biffle's daughter, Emma.\n\nThe statement identified the other victims as Craig Wadsworth, Dennis Dutton and Dutton's son, Jack, all “beloved by many in the NASCAR community.”\n\n“Each of them meant everything to us, and their absence leaves an immeasurable void in our lives,” the statement said.\n\nBiffle, 55, won more than 50 races across NASCAR’s three circuits, including 19 at the Cup Series level.

    "fullText": "TikTok reached a deal with a group of investors to form a new joint venture for its US business, according to an internal memo viewed by Business Insider.\n\nThe deal, which TikTok expects to close in January, comes more than a year after Congress passed a law that forced its owner, ByteDance, to divest from its US operations or face a ban, because TikTok was deemed a \"foreign adversary-controlled\" company.\n\nThe new US joint venture will operate independently in areas like US data protection and training its content recommendation algorithm while still connecting to TikTok's global product and business lines like e-commerce and advertising, per the memo from company CEO Shou Chew.\n\nThe announcement is the culmination of a lengthy battle for survival by TikTok, which briefly went dark in the US in January to comply with the divest-or-ban law.\n\nTikTok and ByteDance had sought recourse through the courts, arguing that the law — the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act — violated the First Amendment. In January, the Supreme Court ruled against TikTok and upheld the divest-or-ban law.\n\nSince then, TikTok has been facing a looming deadline to find a US buyer. The app's future remained in limbo for months as the White House repeatedly extended the deadline and administration officials sought to work out a deal.\n\nIn September, President Donald Trump signed an executive order that approved the sale of TikTok's US operation for around $14 billion.\n\nTrump said at the time that Oracle and Larry Ellison would be part of the deal, and Michael Dell and Rupert Murdoch may also be involved. Vice President JD Vance said the buyer group would include \"four or five world-class investors.\"\n\nTikTok did not respond to a request for comment. The White House referred Business Insider to TikTok.",

    "description": "I rode in business class on the Amtrak NextGen Acela train from NYC to Washington, DC, for $180. It was a great experience, but not worth the price.",
    "fullText": "The Amtrak Acela is an express service between Boston and Washington, DC. The train line introduced a new fleet on the route in August 2025, known as NextGen Acela.\n\nIn addition to being the fastest Amtrak train with a top speed of 160 miles per hour, the NextGen Acela has modern interiors and high-tech amenities.\n\nThe Amtrak Acela trains only have two classes — business and first. I booked my business-class ticket for $180.\n\nOut of curiosity, I looked at the pricing for coach seating on the regional Amtrak train, which is 30 minutes slower than the Acela. It was $40.\n\nMy train was scheduled to leave at 10 a.m., but there was a 90-minute delay. Since I was stuck at the station for longer than anticipated, I briefly considered going to the Metropolitan Lounge, an elevated space overlooking the train hall with cozy seating and complimentary refreshments.\n\nFirst-class passengers and those traveling in sleeper accommodations can get into the lounge for free, but other Amtrak riders have to pay $50 to access it.\n\nSince I'd already splurged on the business-class ticket, I decided to skip the lounge and head to the standard waiting room instead, but it was full. I finally settled for a seat on the floor against the wall until it was time to board.\n\nWhen I got in line to board, I was reminded that business class is just a standard ticket on the Amtrak Acela. Unlike business-class rides I've taken that also had coach seating, this trip didn't include the perk of priority boarding.\n\nSoft, cushy, spacious, supportive — these are the words that popped into my head when I settled into my business-class seat. A reclining function and footrest made the ride even more comfortable.\n\nPower outlets, USB ports, and a reading light were all conveniently located on the side of the seat. In front of me was a tray table and a fold-out cupholder.\n\nMost Amtrak trains I've been on have had WiFi, but in my experience, the connection has typically been too weak for much more than a Google search.\n\nI was stoked when the NextGen Acela's 5G WiFi was fast enough to stream YouTube videos without any issues. I passed the time by watching live sessions of my favorite bands.\n\nI've learned to set the bar low for train bathrooms. Stocked toilet paper, soap, and paper towels are not a given. Cleanliness and extra space aren't either. In my experience, some business-class bathrooms are no different from those in coach.\n\nSo I was ecstatic when I stepped inside the lavatory on the NextGen Acela. The automatic door opened into a spotless space that felt big enough for two people to do jumping jacks simultaneously.\n\nI found it aesthetically pleasing too, with bold red accents and trendy touches, from the shelf to the mirror.\n\nI also appreciated the touchless water, soap, and dryer functions on the sink.\n\n\"Amtrak travelers always have their preference,\" an Amtrak representative wrote in an email to Business Insider. \"If they want to experience these premium trains with enhanced amenities, they can. Or, if they prefer convenient and affordable downtown-to-downtown service up and down the Northeast Corridor, Northeast Regional trains offer a comfortable and enjoyable way to travel throughout the Northeast Corridor and points beyond.\"\n\nThe next time I take an Amtrak train, I'll miss the cozy seat, elevated bathroom, high-speed WiFi, and shorter travel time. Still, these perks weren't enough for me to consider Acela's business class to be worth more than quadruple the price of a coach ticket.",

Meta denies he left over politics.\n\nBut these days it's all sunshine and rainbows cruise missiles and drones for Luckey.\n\nPalmer Luckey might be the face of defense tech, but he's got plenty of competition.\n\nFirst and foremost, there's more money than ever in the space thanks to the Trump administration leaning into defense spending.\n\nThe latest era of modern warfare is also creating new opportunities. The increased prominence of drones, as evident in the war in Ukraine, has given startups a chance to step up to the plate. It has created an interesting dynamic, with young, agile startups competing with traditional defense contractors.\n\nThe increased competition is largely viewed as a positive for the government, which can benefit from better pricing. The new players and cutting-edge tech are also speeding up processes.\n\nThe Navy said a Palantir-powered AI system for shipbuilding cut a 160-hour job to just 10 minutes. The Army is also enacting a \"fail fast\" approach to weapon development.\n\nMoving at such speed, a staple of Silicon Valley, comes with risks when dealing with such powerful and dangerous tech. A new watchdog report said the US military needs to improve its weapons testing processes.",

    "fullText": "YouTuber MrBeast loves giving away piles of cash. Now he wants to teach his millions of viewers how to spend it responsibly.\n\nThe world's top YouTube creator, whose real name is Jimmy Donaldson, said he wants to make videos \"educating people on investing and showing them what is a Roth IRA.\" The content would probably live on a separate YouTube channel, Donaldson said, speaking to creator Jon Youshaei in an interview posted Monday.\n\nThe move into personal finance content may seem out of left field for a YouTuber who amassed hundreds of millions of subscribers by posting stunt videos like burying himself alive. However, money is a common theme in MrBeast videos, whether Donaldson is asking 100 identical twins to battle it out for $250,000 or locking contestants in a bunker for 100 days to potentially win a $500,000 cash prize.\n\nFinancial content \"just feels like a nice fit for us because we do so much with money,\" Donaldson said during the conversation.\n\nMrBeast gave away $10 million to the winner of the first season of his Amazon Prime Video competition show, \"Beast Games.\" Cash giveaways were so prevalent in that series that my colleague Katie Notopoulous felt obliged to explain to her elementary-aged son that money in the real world isn't just an \"object to build into pyramids or toss around in bags.\"\n\nLaunching a YouTube channel focused on expanding financial literacy could also serve as a marketing vehicle for one of Donaldson's next ventures: MrBeast Financial.\n\nThe CEO of the YouTuber's company confirmed earlier this month that the team plans to launch a financial services product as one of its next business lines.\n\nWhile the MrBeast team has been quiet on specifics, an investor deck from earlier this year, viewed by Business Insider, listed a variety of potential services for the business, including student loans and insurance.

Its results came from four practical moves: tightening energy-intensive processes, turning traceability into market access, designing products that reduce customers’ fuel use, and rethinking short-haul logistics with electric autonomy. The company’s experience shows that when sustainability is pursued as a source of performance, not a trade-off, even cost-constrained manufacturers can reduce emissions, win customers, and strengthen returns.",

    "title": "Starbucks is doubling down on its free bachelor's degree program as enrollment surges 60%",
    "description": "Starbucks' Chief People Officer Sara Kelly spoke to Business Insider about the company's increasingly popular free college program.",
    "fullText": "Starbucks receives more than a million job applications a year, the company's Chief People Officer says one reason is a quietly powerful lure: the promise of a fully-funded bachelor's degree from Arizona State University.\n\nFor Brea Yancey, a barista in Washington state who has worked at the company for eight years, that benefit hasn't just reshaped her future — it reshaped her family's. She enrolled, then inspired her mother, a Starbucks store manager, to join her, turning a workplace perk into a two-generation push toward a goal neither woman thought was financially in reach.\n\n\"I didn't think college was going to be an option because of how much it costs with loans and things like that,\" Yancey, who celebrated her graduation on Monday, told Business Insider. \"I know it's going to make all the difference in the world not having to worry about that.\"\n\nYancey pursued a degree in interdisciplinary arts and performance, with the goal of becoming a music teacher. Her mother graduated last semester with a degree in interdisciplinary studies, concentrating in sales, marketing, and project management.\n\n\"I'm glad that she got to finish school, because that's all she ever wanted, and she stopped originally because she got pregnant with me, but now we finished it together,\" Yancey said.\n\nAs college costs have soared, so has enrollment in Starbucks' College Achievement Plan (SCAP) program, Chief People Officer Sara Kelly told Business Insider. The program, which began in 2014, offers eligible employees 100% upfront tuition coverage for their first bachelor's degree, facilitated through online classes at ASU.\n\n\"Over the last five years, we've seen a 60% increase in participation,\" Kelly said. \"We have 13% of our partners participating as scholars today.\"\n\nThat represents at least one enrolled Starbucks staff member at about 90% of its coffeehouses, Kelly added.\n\nStarbucks isn't the only retail or Fortune 500 employer offering education benefits. Amazon, Walmart, and Chipotle also offer similar programs. However, compared to most programs in the US retail sector, Starbucks doesn't require reimbursement of tuition payments or require students to stay with the company for a certain amount of time after graduation.\n\nYounger students are increasingly questioning the value of a college degree. A May 2024 Deloitte survey found that a third of Gen Z and millennials chose to skip higher education due to rising costs, and the average price of attendance for a student living on campus at an in-state public 4-year institution is $108,584 over 4 years, according to Educationdata — so you can't beat free.\n\n\"This started over 10 years ago, all in service of creating access to education, and the importance of creating access to education,\" Kelly said. \"College is incredibly costly, and so how do we create access to that education for all of our partners? So we're really proud, because we see this as one of the most powerful expressions of our investment in our partners.\"\n\nStarbucks has expanded the SCAP program in recent years, offering access to more than 150 degree pathways, providing enrolled students with a broader range of fields to pursue than in the program's early years. They've also added a \"Pathway to Admission\" support route for partners who don't initially qualify for university admission, allowing them to take preparatory courses and earn their way into ASU. Additionally, a \"plus-one\" benefit is available for eligible military and veteran partners, extending SCAP to a qualifying family member.\n\nThis year, Starbucks introduced new study abroad and coffee education opportunities, offering a hands-on sustainability immersion at Hacienda Alsacia in Costa Rica, where scholars study climate, agronomy, and the future of coffee at their global research and development farm.\n\nOf course, the students aren't the only ones benefiting. The program is a significant retention win for Starbucks. Turnover is at record lows, Kelly said, and baristas who have spoken to Business Insider frequently cite the SCAP program as a reason they've stayed with the company.\n\nThe program also helps to strengthen Starbucks' talent pipeline, as the company has committed to a 90% internal hire rate or fill rate for its retail leadership roles.\n\n\"Our Starbucks college achievement plan partners are part of our pipeline for those management roles, and we're very excited about that,\" Kelly said. \"But do they have to stay with Starbucks? No.\"\n\nStarbucks has never considered adding a retention requirement to the program, Kelly said, because the company wants \"to offer access to education that people can take with them on their journey, no matter where it takes them.\"\n\nFor Yancey, her Starbucks journey is winding down, but it's not over. She continues to work part-time as a barista and has a second job as a music instructor, while planning her next career moves.\n\n\"They find a way to make it work for whoever wants to go into the university through the SCAP program; they find a way for you to complete it,\" Yancey said. \"I don't think finances or learning ability should hold anybody back, and they really delivered on that.\"",

    "fullText": "In a much-anticipated showdown between 5A contenders on Wednesday night — a rematch in fact of last year’s semifinal — it took Bountiful a bit to get going, but once it did it never looked back.\n\nBountiful coach Joel Burton thought his players looked a bit fatigued in the opening minutes perhaps due to a game against Skyline the night before, but they settled in quick building a nine-point lead by the end of the quarter and never looked back on their way to the 56-46 win at Wasatch.\n\n“I felt like our legs were tired as we started the game, and just took us a little while to kind of get into the flow of what we like to do. And just to see us kind of loosen up … and then the shots started dropping. And so it was just nice seeing our kids get flowing again last—there tonight,” said Burton.\n\nBountiful used balanced scoring to secure the win, with Ute signee Milika Satuala leading the way with 15 points, followed by Maleah Nelson with a dozen, Maile Murdock with 11 and Brynna Castleton with 10.\n\n“I’ll take that every game if I can get it. We’ve got some young kids that are definitely growing up and starting to take a little bit of the pressure off of that starting five, thank goodness. So it’s nice to see Miley and Peyton (Orchard) really starting to fill that role, and among many others that are starting to just get confident playing at the varsity level,” said Burton.\n\n“We knew that was going to be the issue coming into the year was finding that group behind the first —behind our starting five, and we’re starting to figure that out.\"\n\nMuch of Bountiful’s damage was done in the first half, as it opened up a 16-7 lead after the first quarter and then stretched it to 21-7 at the 5:54 mark of the second quarter on a corner 3-pointer from the freshman Murdock, her third of the game.\n\nWasatch finally halted the Redhawks’ fast start to cut the lead to 10 by halftime.\n\nWasatch’s press caused some turnover issues late in the game for Bountiful, which saw its lead whittle to seven points in the final minute, but the Wasps ran out of time to cut into the lead another further as it fell to 10-2 on the season.\n\nThe win pushes three-time defending state champion Bountiful’s record to 8-1 on the season.",

    "fullText": "Many electric vehicle drivers have experienced disturbing incidents at charging stations when others maliciously unplug the cables or even cut the cords. Surveillance footage and personal confrontations often reveal that vandals disrupt EV charging out of spite or hatred towards people who own and drive clean-energy vehicles.\n\nHowever, even business owners and store managers sometimes unplug EVs on their property, much to the dismay of drivers who rely on public charging stations.\n\nIn a Reddit post to r/TeslaModelY, one driver shared details about a frustrating encounter while charging at a local grocery store.\n\nThe OP explained they began charging their EV at a grocery store and went into the store's Starbucks to work while it was charging. The store manager told the OP that he unplugged the car because those stations are only for customers.\n\nHowever, the OP was actually a customer who bought a drink and was working inside the store's coffee shop. The encounter made the OP feel \"extremely uncomfortable,\" so they packed up their belongings and left.\n\n\"I'm bummed as this used to be the grocery store I would get my groceries at, and it was always nice to be able to charge my car while shopping, but I don't want to ever go back there knowing that the store manager is a creep who follows customers on their cameras and will, without hesitation, unplug their cars while charging,\" the OP shared.\n\nThis situation is unfortunate because it prevented an EV driver from charging their EV. It also created anxiety for the OP by eliminating a reliable charging source while out running errands.\n\nUnfortunately, EV driver harassment is a widespread problem worldwide. Not only do unplugging vehicles and other threatening behaviors create unnecessary tension between EV and non-EV owners, but they also slow the broader adoption of clean-energy driving.\n\nThose who have yet to learn about the impressive technological advancements and benefits of EVs may rely on outdated information or anti-EV propaganda to justify their actions.\n\nIt's true that EV production does use some natural resources and generates some pollution. However, EVs are still far cleaner and more sustainable than gas-powered vehicles, which release tailpipe fumes wherever they go.\n\nHow long would you be willing to wait for an EV to charge?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nWhen you embrace highly efficient electric vehicle driving, you help sustain breathable air and contribute less to overheating the planet. You can also save significantly on vehicle ownership costs by avoiding the need to buy gas and the routine maintenance costs of traditional cars.\n\nIn response to the OP's post, Reddit users offered their advice about how to handle the situation.\n\n\"You should definitely use one of those charging locks next time you go,\" one Redditor recommended.\n\n\"I would complain to corporate or his boss,\" someone else suggested.\n\n\"Report them for tampering with a customer's car,\" another Redditor wrote.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "As SpaceX (SPAX.PVT) eyes going public via an IPO in 2026, what would such a move mean for the space economy, which for the longest time has been dominated by private companies?\n\nSpace Capital founder and CEO Chad Anderson comes on Market Catalysts to elaborate on the spark this could give the space industry and how it could influence more private operators to go public.\n\nAnderson is also the author of The Space Economy: Capitalize on the Greatest Business Opportunity of Our Lifetime.\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Catalysts.\n\nFor more on what a potential SpaceX IPO means for other space companies looking to go public, as well as just a general landscape for next year, I'm joined here on set by Chad Anderson, Space Capital founder and CEO. He's also the author of The Space Economy. Good to see you.\n\nSo, I'm so curious about SpaceX and kind of like whether it sucks the air out of the room for other types of space investment or creates more of a halo effect for space investment.\n\nI think it's definitely the ladder. Um this is really exciting news. It's still uncertain, but we'll see what happens. But if they do, I mean, this is, I think this is going to um uh set a new benchmark. It's going to reprice um a lot of assets throughout the category. I think it's going to show what can be done. And I think it's going to kick off a wave of new listings. So this could be really exciting. And then from our perspective as private market investors in early companies, uh we're really excited to see what happens when these founders get some liquidity, who own stock options and shares, and they go on now and they're freed from the shackles of working at um big companies, they can go and, you know, um think about what they want to do, start their own thing. So we expect that this is going to um uh increase the SpaceX mafia. I mean, a few years ago it was, you know, we were tracking 45 companies or something like that of SpaceX alumni that had gone on and done founded new companies. It's now up to, I don't know, closer to 200, and we'll see what happens with with this um uh liquidity event. But for us, I mean, this is um uh SpaceX is the Apex player. They're 10 years ahead of anybody else. They've been setting the benchmark all along. Uh now this sort of moment, um we'll see what happens, but it could really catalyze a lot of activity.\n\nI mean, on the flip side, if they are so far ahead of everyone else, and then their numbers are public, does that then um mean that some of the other players, particularly in the public markets who also their numbers are public, like that that they're disadvantaged if they're not in the same place as SpaceX is.\n\nHmm, well, that's um that's a really interesting point. So I think SpaceX has stayed private for so long and they've been so in demand. Um, uh this is the hottest stock in the private markets. Everyone is vying to get access to SpaceX. Um and I think it's really sort of difficult, um when you've got that much interest and that many investors, um to sort of keep things quiet. So, you know, you see throughout the the the news that there's a lot of information that's out there\n\non what their performance looks like, right? So um it's no um so that sort of cat's out of the bag already.\n\nSo it wouldn't necessarily change the dynamic.\n\nYeah, I think so. And so you see like um what are the numbers, you know, um uh 13 last year, 15 this year. You start to think like the the growth is not parabolic um in uh uh their their growth is not parabolic. They but they are cash flow positive and they've been buying back shares, right? So I think what um this would do is really give them sort of uh a large cash infusion to go after some of their long-term missions to get to Mars, to um uh build data centers in orbit, uh to fund that and really have a big cash infusion to basically speed things up and go faster.\n\nUm and one of those is also what Starship is one of the projects that they're working on. Um so how important is that and what what's the timeline for something like that?\n\nSuper important. So Starship is a next generation massive vehicle. Um we've never had anything of this size. So if 2025 was the year of launch frequency, we were basically, we started launching, we launched almost every day, one launch per day, right? And that launch cadence is increasing. 2026 is going to be about mass. Um Starship is a massive vehicle. It is going to be fully reusable, which means that both the first stage of the rocket and the second stage both can land and be refueled and stacked and launched again. More like operational commercial airlines, which is really exciting because that is going to um it promises to deliver another step change in the order of magnitude, further reduction in launch cost, which really um will do a lot to again, to the halo effect, you know, comment to really stimulate growth in in this category. Um but at the same time, that vehicle is is necessary to launch these next generation Starlink satellites, the V3 satellites that they already um that they have already designed and they're just waiting for a vehicle that can carry them. Their data centers in orbit that they're now talking about in conjunction with this um potential IPO, uh requires Starship to be able to launch these things, right? So, this um is uh a lynchpin. It's it's critical to their strategy and it's also um critical um to to take the space economy to the next level.\n\nUm another thing that you're watching closely going into next year is what? geo intelligence and defense. Those are kind of some themes within space. So what should we be watching for there?\n\nYeah, I kind of just thinking about the convergence of AI and space in totality, right? So we talked a little bit about orbital data centers. Everyone seems to be talking about that now. Um Starship is and and Blue Origin's next generation vehicles too are going to allow us to launch new infrastructure that, you know, we couldn't do before like orbital data centers and some other things. So that's really interesting on the AI front. And also, um with regards to, you know, geospatial intelligence. So, um if GPS is the dot on the map, geospatial intelligence is the map. This is um uh digital information layered on top of the physical world. A lot of that comes from the global intelligence comes from satellites, um and different sensor types that are feeding into this really robust rich data set about what's going on on the surface of our planet. That's too much data for humans to comb through. So, um uh AI has come along at just the right time to basically help us parse through that and make sense of that, drive useful insights from that. And this is a huge area of growth. We're seeing um what what we call world models. So, everyone's familiar with LLMs and what's going on there, but those aren't really good at helping us to understand and navigate the physical world. So there's a lot of work going on right now um in geospatial embeddings, basically embedding the data to have the right geospatial information, coordinates, positioning data, rich layers of of data to basically help you now use AI to make sense of the physical world, right? Not just language. So, this is a huge area of opportunity. Um a lot of demand is being driven by defense and intelligence communities, but then also there's massive consumer and enterprise applications as well.\n\nVery cool. All right, Chad, we got to leave it there. Thank you so much. Appreciate it.",

    "title": "Mystery solved: Amazon is the prospective tenant in talks with data center developer rocked by stock plunge",
    "description": "\"The lead negotiator for Amazon called me on Thursday,\" Fermi CEO Toby Neugebauer told Business Insider. The deal would pay more than $20 billion over the next 20 years, he said.",
    "fullText": "Amazon is the prospective tenant that withdrew funding from Fermi America's massive data-center project, sending the developer's stock plummeting earlier this month, Business Insider has learned.\n\nIn September, Fermi, which is developing an 11-gigawatt data-center campus in the Texas Panhandle, said it had agreed to a nonbinding letter of intent with an investment-grade tenant to anchor the project. The tenant would take the first gigawatt of power across 12 facilities.\n\nOn Friday, December 12, Fermi's stock plunged by nearly half after a securities filing said an unnamed prospective partner had canceled a $150 million advance to begin construction, known as an Advance in Aid of Construction Agreement, or AICA. The cancellation followed the end of an exclusivity period.\n\nAmazon is that tenant, Toby Neugebauer, Fermi's billionaire CEO, confirmed in a December 15 phone call with Business Insider, discussing the talks that led to the cancellation. The tech giant has been negotiating the deal, which would pay more than $20 billion over the next 20 years, Neugebauer said.\n\n\"The lead negotiator for Amazon called me on Thursday,\" Neugebauer said.\n\nNeugebauer said the talks between Fermi and the tenant remain constructive, and that the ending of the AICA didn't indicate any breakdown in conversation.\n\n\"It's just a normal negotiation,\" he said. \"Their issue was spending money after the exclusive period had ended.\"\n\nNeugebauer said he wasn't worried about the talks taking too long. \"It's a big deal,\" he said. \"Big deals take longer.\"\n\nLisa Levandowski, a spokesperson for Amazon, declined to comment.\n\nFermi America's Panhandle project ranks among the most ambitious attempts yet to meet the surging energy demands of the data centers fueling the AI boom. The company intends to bring 11 gigawatts of new power online over the next decade-plus with a mix of power from the grid, natural gas, and nuclear sources.\n\nThe company went public in September, pricing its shares at $21 to raise more than $680 million.\n\nDubbed Project Matador, the development relies on a 99-year ground lease with the Texas Tech University System. That agreement is dependent on a signed letter of intent between Fermi America and a tenant.\n\nThe December 12 filing said that none of the $150 million construction advance had been used and that the negotiations were ongoing. The letter of intent remains in force.\n\nAnalysts at Cantor Fitzgerald said in a note published December 12 that they had spoken to Fermi America's management and learned that, per the company, the anchor tenant \"tried to make last-minute changes to the agreement pricing that were unacceptable to\" Fermi.\n\nAmazon is the second company to be linked to the project. In October, Neugebauer told the Amarillo City Council that Palantir, the software company known for its police and government contracts, had taken an interest in the site.\n\n\"I just finished with Palantir, which is our nation's tip of the spear in the AI war,\" Neugebauer said during the October 28 meeting. \"They'll be here Thursday.\"\n\nThe Cantor Fitzgerald analysts said in their note that management indicated that they were \"active\" with two additional tenants, and in dialogue with another four.\n\nFermi America was founded less than a year ago by Neugebauer, former Energy Secretary Rick Perry, and Perry's son Griffin. The IPO valued the company at nearly $14 billion.\n\nA recent slump in the company's shares has brought its valuation to below $6 billion.\n\nHave a tip?

    "title": "Strategic CISO: Timing Your Security Assessment for Executive Impact",
    "description": "Whether you’re presenting to your board, executive leadership team, or quarterly business review, transform your penetration testing from a compliance checkbox to your strategic advantage.",
    "fullText": "Welcome to the second installment of our Strategic CISO Series—a collection of guides focused on turning operational security work into strategic wins. Read Part 0 Before the Test — When Your Startup is Really Ready for Penetration Testing.\n\nWhile most security leaders schedule assessments around audit deadlines, the timing of your security testing creates opportunities to demonstrate proactive leadership, present measurable improvements, and position security as a business enabler rather than a cost center.\n\nYour executive leadership review is eight weeks away, scheduled for 15 minutes between the CFO’s budget presentation and lunch. You know you need to talk about security, but leading with “we’re compliant” sounds like you’re just checking boxes, and you definitely can’t lead with “here are all our vulnerabilities.”\n\nThis is a tightrope every security leader walks. You need to discuss security in a way that demonstrates both vigilance and value, without creating panic or appearing reactive.\n\nThe timing of your penetration test is just as strategic as the test itself.\n\nA well-timed pen test validates your security posture, creates a narrative of proactive leadership, provides concrete metrics to present, and positions you as strategic rather than operational.\n\nA poorly timed test leaves you scrambling to explain findings without a remediation story, or, worse, presenting stale data that makes the board question what you’re doing with your time.\n\nEvery penetration test delivers technical findings. Strategic penetration tests deliver business outcomes.\n\nThe difference isn’t in the testing methodology or even expertise - it’s in when you test and what you do with the results. Testing six weeks before a board meeting gives you time to remediate findings and walk into that meeting with a complete narrative of proactive security leadership. Testing two weeks before forces you to either hide findings or present problems without solutions.\n\nStrategic timing enables you to:\n\nSecurity leaders who master timing use their penetration tests to manufacture strategic wins. Those who don’t find themselves constantly explaining why they’re behind.\n\nStrategic play: Commission a penetration test that completes 6-8 weeks before your key stakeholder presentation—whether that’s your board, executive leadership team, quarterly business review, or audit committee—giving you time to remediate critical findings and present a complete narrative of proactive security management.\n\nWhat you can say to stakeholders:\n\n“We proactively commissioned an independent security assessment to validate our security posture”\n\n“We identified and remediated X vulnerabilities before they could be exploited”\n\n“Our security controls are performing as designed, with only minor findings that have been addressed”\n\nWhy the timing works: You’re controlling the narrative. You found the problems. You fixed the problems. You’re demonstrating maturity and proactive risk management. The leadership team sees leadership, not firefighting.\n\nCritical consideration: This only works if your vendor can deliver a report quickly and your team has the bandwidth to remediate. If the report sits for three weeks before anyone looks at it, you’re losing your window.\n\nWhen evaluating vendors, ask: “What’s your turnaround time from test completion to report delivery?” Anything over 5-7 business days will compress your remediation timeline.\n\nWhat you need from your vendor to make this work\n\nSecurity Assessment Results - Q4 2024\n\nAll critical and high-severity findings identified in our independent security assessment have been remediated and retested. This validates that our security investments are working as designed.\n\nThis demonstrates proactive risk management. This is strategic security leadership.\n\nThe strategic play: When a major breach hits your industry or a critical vulnerability affects your tech stack, commission a targeted assessment.\n\nBusiness context: Your leadership team just read about a competitor getting breached, or a major CVE dropped that affects the technology you use. They’re wondering: “Are we vulnerable to this?” Strategic security leaders answer that question before it’s asked.\n\nTriaging whether these things affect your business is a larger conversation. A key consideration for urgency is whether the vulnerability is currently being exploited with publicly released tools, whether you understand your control maturity and attack surface, and the impacts of a compromised affected system. Undergoing security analyses, control audits, purple team partnerships, penetration tests, or red team engagements can help illuminate this uncertainty.\n\nWhat you can present to the executives:\n\nWhy this timing works: Speed and specificity. You’re not waiting for the leadership team to ask the question—you’re answering it before they think of it. This is the difference between reactive and responsive. Reactive is “oh yeah, we should probably check on that.” Responsive is “I’ve already validated our posture and here’s what we found.”\n\nReal-world example: When Log4Shell dropped in December 2021, the CISOs who immediately commissioned targeted pen tests focused on Log4j exploitation were able to report with confidence: “We identified 3 instances, patched them within 48 hours, and validated through penetration testing that we’re no longer vulnerable. No publicly accessible services are vulnerable”\n\nSecurity leaders who didn’t test were left saying “we think we patched everything”—which is not what leadership wants to hear in crisis moments.\n\nWhat you need from your vendor to make this work:\n\nIndustry response timing requires a partner who can mobilize quickly (again, days, not weeks), brings specialized expertise in emergent threats, and provides real-time communication during testing. If they find something critical, you need to know immediately.\n\nSlide that demonstrates responsive leadership\n\nDemonstrate security operations excellence aligned with business velocity.\n\nThe play: Schedule your pen test 90-120 days before your compliance audit (SOC 2, ISO 27001, PCI, HIPAA, etc.), giving you time to remediate findings before auditors arrive.\n\nThe strategic advantage: Many companies schedule penetration tests to coincide with audit requirements, meaning the auditor sees findings around the same time you do. Strategic security leaders validate controls before audits, transforming potential stressors into demonstrations of security maturity.\n\nWhat you can say to your stakeholders (and auditors):\n\nWhy this timing works: Auditors love controls that are already validated. If your pen test is complete, findings are remediated, and you walk into the audit with clean documentation, you’ve just turned a potential stressor into a demonstration of maturity. Plus, if the pen test does find something gnarly, you have time to fix it before the auditor asks about it.\n\nThe awkward scenario this avoids: Your SOC 2 audit is scheduled for October. You commission your pen test in September “to have fresh results for the audit.” The pen test finds a critical SQL injection vulnerability. Now you’re in remediation mode during the audit, explaining to both the auditor and your board why this exists. Even if you fix it quickly, it’s going in the audit report as “finding identified during audit period.”\n\nCompare that to strategic timing: Penetration test in July. Finding discovered and remediated in August. Retested clean in September. Auditor arrives in October and you present a complete package: “Here’s our penetration test from Q3, here’s the remediation, here’s the retest validation.” Clean audit. Confident leadership team.\n\nAsk your vendor to include retesting so you can show “finding closed” before the audit.\n\nThe slide that demonstrates readiness\n\nStrategic planning, not last-minute scrambling.\n\nThe strategic play: Test new products, major features, or infrastructure changes before they go live and before they attract attacker attention.\n\nBusiness context: You’re launching a new product, exposing a new API, or making significant architectural changes. Your engineering team is focused on features and performance. Strategic security leaders integrate testing into the launch process rather than treating security as a launch-day concern.\n\nWhat you can say to the leadership team:\n\nWhy this works: “Shift left” is the mantra, but most companies still treat security as a launch-day or post-launch concern. If you can demonstrate that security testing happened before launch, you’re showing mature DevSecOps practices.\n\nThe strategic value: This also creates internal credibility with your engineering team. If you find issues pre-launch and help them fix it before customers are affected, you’re a partner. If you’re constantly pointing out problems in production, you’re a blocker. The perception shapes your ability to influence future projects.\n\nWhat you need from your vendor to make this work:\n\nStrategic security leaders track penetration test results year-over-year and present trends that prove security program effectiveness.\n\nIf you’re testing annually (and you should be), the compelling story isn’t “we had fewer findings this year.” It’s “here’s how our security posture has measurably improved.”\n\nSlide demonstrating strategic security leadership‍\n\nThat is strategic. That’s budget justification. This proves your security program delivers measurable business value.\n\nWhat you need from your vendor to make this work:\n\nChoose the timing window that best serves your strategic goals:\n\nChoose Window 1 (Pre-Executive Showcase) if:\n\nChoose Window 2 (Industry Response) if:\n\nChoose Window 3 (Compliance Preemptive Strike) if:\n\nChoose Window 4 (Product Security Story) if:\n\nMost strategic approach: Combine windows 3 and 4 on a predictable cadence, and use windows 1 and 2 opportunistically.\n\nThis gives you a drumbeat of security validation, predictable testing cadence, and strategic moments to showcase your program’s effectiveness.\n\nUnderstanding common timing mistakes helps you plan more effectively:\n\nInsufficient remediation window: You commission a pen test two weeks before your executive meeting. When the report comes back with critical findings, you have no time to remediate. You walk into the leadership meeting and either:\n\nTesting during product launches: You test right before a major product launch. Pen test finds a critical issue. Now you’re choosing between:\n\nTesting during audits: You test during your audit. Findings emerge mid-audit. Auditor documents them as “control failures identified during assessment.” Even if you fix them immediately, they’re in the audit report, creating customer concerns and remediation requirements.\n\nInconsistent testing methodologies: Changing the testing scope drastically or switching vendors every six months makes trend analysis difficult, since you can’t demonstrate improvement when the methodology changes. Strategic planning maintains consistent testing approaches that enable year-over-year comparison.\n\nAll of these are avoidable with better timing.\n\nStrategic timing only works when your security testing partner understands both technical depth and business context. Key capabilities that enable strategic timing:\n\n1. Fast report turnaround: Reports delivered within 5-7 business days, so you control your timeline and have adequate remediation windows. Ask: “From test completion to report delivery, what’s your timeline?”\n\n2. Built-in retesting: Validate remediation before presentations. Retest hours should be included in every engagement, not sold separately or requiring additional procurement cycles.\n\n3. Collaborative approach: Testing partners who work alongside your team during remediation, not vendors who deliver reports and disappear. Some findings need clarification; having testers available accelerates remediation.\n\n4. Real-time critical escalation: If they find something severe, you should know during testing, not in a report weeks later. Ask: “If you find a critical vulnerability, what’s your escalation process?”\n\n5. Flexible scheduling: Strategic windows sometimes have tight timelines. Can they start in 2 weeks? Or is their lead time 8+ weeks?\n\n6. Executive reporting capability: Technical reports are necessary; executive summaries are strategic. If appropriate for the assessment, make sure they provide executive-ready documentation, not just technical findings.\n\nStrategic timing transforms security testing from an operational necessity into a controlled narrative.\n\nA penetration test itself takes 80 hours. The strategic value comes from when you test and what you do with the results.\n\nA little planning around timing makes your penetration test 10x more valuable to your career and your company. Testing aligned with executive meetings demonstrates proactive leadership. Testing before audits de-risks compliance. Testing before product launches integrates security into development. Testing after major CVEs demonstrates responsive operations.\n\nThe technical findings do matter. But the business outcomes matter more.\n\nSecurity leaders who master timing use their penetration tests to prove program effectiveness, justify security investments, and position security as a business enabler. Those who treat testing as a compliance checkbox miss the strategic opportunity.\n\nStrategic timing turns security testing into strategic advantage.\n\nSchedule a consultation to discuss aligning your security assessments with stakeholder presentations, compliance deadlines, and product launches.

    "fullText": "Universities risk surrendering their intellectual autonomy to Silicon Valley's influence as they rush to adopt AI, one professor says.\n\nIn an essay for the Civics of Technology Project — an education platform analyzing technology's societal impact — Bruna Damiana Heinsfeld, an assistant professor of learning technologies at the University of Minnesota, said that colleges are allowing Big Tech to reshape what counts as knowledge, truth, and academic value.\n\nFrom multimillion-dollar partnerships with AI vendors to classrooms infused with corporate branding, she said, universities are shifting toward a model where technological tools are bundled with the identity of the companies behind them.\n\nAs academic leaders scramble to look \"AI-ready,\" Heinsfeld warned that the sector is drifting from critical inquiry toward compliance, risking a future in which Silicon Valley, not educators, sets the terms of learning.\n\nHeinsfeld said AI tools promote a worldview where efficiency is presumed to be a virtue, scale is inherently desirable, and data becomes the default language of truth.\n\nUniversities adopting these systems without critical examination risk teaching students that the logic of Big Tech is not merely useful but inevitable, she added.\n\nHeinsfeld pointed to California State University as an example of that shift on full display.\n\nThe university signed a $16.9 million contract in February to roll out ChatGPT Edu across 23 campuses, providing more than 460,000 students and 63,000 faculty and staff with access to the tool through mid-2026.\n\nIt hosted an AWS-powered \"AI camp\" in the summer, where students arrived to find Amazon branding everywhere, including corporate slogans, AWS notebooks, and promotional swag.\n\nAnother academic said the problem is already playing out in the day-to-day mechanics of learning.\n\nKimberley Hardcastle, a business and marketing professor at Northumbria University in the UK, told Business Insider that universities must overhaul how they design assessments now that students' \"epistemic mediators\" — the tools that help them make sense of the world — have fundamentally changed.\n\nHardcastle advocates requiring students to demonstrate their reasoning: how they arrived at a conclusion, which sources they consulted beyond AI, and how they verified information against primary evidence, she said.\n\nShe said students also need deliberate \"epistemic checkpoints,\" moments designed into coursework where they must pause and ask: \"Am I using this tool to enhance my thinking or replace it? Have I engaged with the underlying concepts or just the AI's summary? Do I understand, or am I just recalling information?\"\n\nFor Heinsfeld, the risk is that corporations will dictate what constitutes legitimate knowledge. For Hardcastle, it's that students will no longer understand how to assess truth for themselves.\n\nBoth say universities must remain the space where students are taught to think, not just how to operate tools.\n\n\"Education should remain the space where we confront the architectures of our tools,\" Heinsfeld wrote. Otherwise, \"it risks becoming the laboratory of the very systems it should critique.\"\n\nHardcastle made a similar point, adding that this future will be shaped not only by institutional decisions but by every moment a student accepts an AI-generated answer without knowing how to question it.",

The original poster summed up their frustration: “Previous generations of middle age professionals could be basic admin level talents that sent the same daily reports, forwarded the same couple tickets and did the same vlookup for years on end to secure a stable middle class life.”\n\nThey asked others, “Do you feel cheated out of corporate loserdom as a Millennial?”\n\nFast Company Calls It a ‘Groundbreaking Step for the Creator Economy' — Investors Can Still Get In at $0.85/Share\n\n7 Million Gamers Already Trust Gameflip With Their Digital Assets — Now You Can Own a Stake in the Platform\n\nThe OP compared older workers who spent decades in cushy roles doing routine tasks to today's pressured professionals. “Now our generation has to be deep specialists in seven functional areas and have very good soft skills to barely [eke] out a middle class life,” they wrote.\n\nAnother person chimed in: “Saying yes and pushing paper used to get you somewhere.”\n\nOne commenter said 90s slacker movies led them to believe a “meaningless” but secure career was once easily within reach. “We didn’t even get the luxury of that being an option,” they wrote.\n\nOthers noted how older employees still coast on tenure. “You can tell [they] used to have it very easy and are just skating by now,” one person said.\n\nTrending: Earn While You Scroll: The Deloitte-Ranked #1 Software Company Growing 32,481% Is Opening Its $0.50/Share Round to Accredited Investors.\n\nToday's workers face a different reality. One millennial shared: “Everything I do is timed or measured and compared. If I do better, I get a firm handshake and nothing else. If I do worse than [key performance indicators], I risk losing my job.”\n\nAnother commenter said, “Work is actually challenging nowadays.” They described feeling judged by younger coworkers despite constantly upskilling just to stay above water.\n\nSeveral millennials agreed that having just one job isn’t enough. “We’re hustling in all aspects of work life, main job PLUS side hustles,” one person noted. “I feel like we should have an additional name for that double effort.”\n\nOne person who created detailed standard operating procedure manuals for a corporate role recalled being laid off after their position was outsourced. “They took them and the role, offshored it to India and laid me off. That set the tone for me forever.”\n\nSee Also: GM-Backed EnergyX Is Solving the Lithium Supply Crisis — Invest Before They Scale Global Production\n\nWhile many expressed burnout and resignation, a few found less stressful paths.

    "fullText": "Fernando Mendoza returns home with the Heisman and unfinished business originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nFernando Mendoza brought the Heisman Trophy back to Bloomington but made it clear the season’s most important work still lies ahead.\n\nFernando Mendoza arrived at the podium with the Heisman Trophy at his side. Its presence was heavy and unmistakable, a reflection of where Indiana football now stands.\n\nIndiana is 13–0. A Big Ten champion. Home to a Heisman winner. And yet nothing about Mendoza’s message sounded like a victory lap. This was not a moment to linger in. It was one to acknowledge, honor, and then move past.\n\n“This page is folded,” Mendoza said. “Our focus right now is winning the College Football Playoff.”\n\nThat balance defined the afternoon. Mendoza spoke about responsibility and humility, about the fraternity of Heisman winners and how the weight of the trophy only grows with time. He also spoke with emotion about family, heritage, and why it mattered to him to address his grandparents in Spanish on college football’s biggest stage.\n\n“All four of my grandparents were born and raised in Cuba,” Mendoza said. “They emigrated to the United States and sacrificed so much to support my parents and then my parents to support myself.”\n\nFor Mendoza, the moment extended beyond his own family. He referenced fellow Heisman finalist Diego Pavia, the Vanderbilt quarterback, and the sight of an entire family showing up together, something that resonated deeply.\n\n“You see like Diego Pavia’s family, he had like 100 people there too,” Mendoza said. “That’s just how the Hispanic culture is. The Hispanic family is so prideful and supportive of one another.”\n\nMORE: Jeff Monken struggles to put words to Army’s heartbreaking loss to Navy\n\nThat connection made the moment bigger than an individual award.\n\n“I thought saying something in Spanish would mean a lot to them,” Mendoza said. “And also for the Hispanic community out there, because I know there’s a lot of Hispanic football fans.”\n\nHe acknowledged the responsibility that comes with visibility, especially for young players who may not see themselves reflected in college football’s most celebrated moments.\n\n“It’s something that I’m looking forward to represent,” Mendoza said.\n\nFernando described himself as a different player than the one who arrived in spring, a transformation he said even his teammates did not foresee. Once a two star recruit committed to Yale, he now stands as the face of the most accomplished season in Indiana football history. He did not frame it as destiny. He framed it as preparation, accountability, and trust in the people around him.\n\nMORE: College Football Playoff expansion proposals that could have changed everything for Notre Dame and BYU\n\nThe Heisman Trophy mattered. The symbolism mattered. Indiana football changed in that room. But Mendoza made one thing clear. The season’s meaning will not be defined by what sits on a podium.\n\nIndiana will face the winner of Alabama and Oklahoma on New Year’s Day at the Rose Bowl with a path to the national championship now fully in view.\n\nBrian Hartline sends a message to Chris Henry Jr. after choosing Ohio State\n\nDeion Sanders expected to lose key staff member to Group of Five school\n\nTavita Pritchard comes home to Stanford with a message of ‘belief and brotherhood’",

    "description": "The biggest open source stories in 2025 clustered around AI, licensing/governance, security and the shift in the “commercial open source” business model.",
    "fullText": "AI was big in 2025, but so were many other developments and worries.\n\nThe biggest open source stories in 2025 clustered around AI, licensing/governance, security and the shift in the “commercial open source” business model. Let’s start, shall we?\n\nWhile most of the money went to proprietary models, open source AI datasets, orchestration frameworks, evaluation tools and guardrail stacks have all seen gains.\n\nSuch open source AI efforts as Common Corpus, along with the  dozens of AI projects hosted by the Linux Foundation’s AI & Data group are enabling us to use community infrastructure for generative AI rather than relying solely on proprietary APIs, making open AI stacks a serious option for businesses and users.\n\nWhile the open source AI definition remains controversial, and very few AI projects fully qualify as open source by the strict requirements of the Open Source Initiative (OSI) AI definition, AI remains built on a foundation of open source software. The debate over open weights, data and training code will continue, but even the most proprietary large language models (LLMs) couldn’t exist without open source programs.\n\nAgentic AI, owes everything to open source. To orchestrate our latest generation of AI agents, we’re using several programs.\n\nThe most important of these, at this early stage of the game, appears to be the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This is an open standard and open source implementation for uniformly connecting agents to tools, files, databases and other systems.\n\nMCP is increasingly the “plumbing layer” under many agents and IDE assistants, and there are numerous open source MCP servers and toolkits that let any compatible agent framework plug into the same tools.\n\nMCP isn’t the only agentic AI middleware that’s speeding up:\n\nA Linux Foundation report released in August showed that venture capital‑backed commercial open source companies have outperformed comparable closed‑source vendors over the last 25 years.\n\nThat report, alongside open source adoption data from an April OSI survey, which from 96% of organizations are maintaining or increasing open source software use, has cemented commercial open source as the default way to build software.\n\nTogether, these reports are driving more funding, more mergers and acquisitions, and more “open core plus services” strategies around critical open source projects.\n\nOf course, we knew that. After all, a 2024 Harvard Business School study already showed that  96% of commercial programs rely on open source and that the total value of open source code comes to a cool $8.8 trillion. That still doesn’t stop companies that made the mistake of confusing open source as a software development model with a business model; it never was. It never will be.\n\nSo it is that in 2025, we saw more companies move from open source to fauxpen source. For example, the ScyllaDBteam announced in December 2024 that it would move to a single “ScyllaDB Enterprise” stream under a source‑available license.\n\nAt the library level, there have been high‑profile examples of previously permissive projects switching quietly to source‑available, paid‑for‑commercial‑use terms, such as the Fluent Assertions .NET testing library moving, this past January, from Apache‑2.0 to a proprietary source‑available license with per‑developer fees.\n\nThen, there’s the DevOps program Puppet. Although Puppet’s core codebase is still under the Apache 2.0 open source license, its commercial parent company, Perforce, has changed how official builds are distributed and licensed.\n\nWhat changed is that new “hardened” binaries and packages built by Puppet/Perforce are now shipped from a private repository. The Puppet Core End User License Agreement (EULA) offers a free tier capped at 25 nodes, with commercial licensing required for additional nodes. Effectively, this makes Puppet a source-available program, even though the code is technically still open.\n\nThe result in Puppet’s case is the same as we’ve seen in other such attempts to close once open source projects: Unhappy programmers have forked the project. The fork is known as OpenVox.\n\nThese forked projects, which include Elasticsearch with its fork OpenSearch, Redis with the Valkey fork, and Terraform with the OpenTofu fork, have been somewhat successful. All four forks have achieved meaningful traction, but at different scales and under different definitions of  “success.”\n\nOpenSearch appears to be the most successful. It reports strong growth, including double‑digit, 78%, year‑over‑year download increases and a roster of major members such as Amazon Web Services, Canonical, SAP and Uber.\n\nValkey has also proven to be popular. The latest release, Valkey 9, is reported to be far faster than the newest version of Redis. In particular, Valkey users report that it’s consistently ahead of comparable Redis releases on raw throughput, especially on larger, memory‑heavy workloads where Valkey’s multithreaded I/O and cache‑prefetching kick in.\n\nWhile OpenSearch and Valkey have both advanced beyond their parent projects, Terraform vs. OpenTofu is another story. People still see OpenTofu and Terraform as differing only in their licenses. Over the last few months, though, that’s been changing as OpenTofu, which joined the Cloud Native Computing Foundation in April, steers more of its own course. Latest releases now include state encryption, a feature the Terraform community has wanted for years, and early variable evaluation.\n\nFinally, OpenVox continues to present itself as a “soft fork.” Its directors want it to stay 100% compatible with Puppet so it can serve as a drop-in replacement for Puppet deployments. That, however, appears to no longer be possible, as Gene Liverman, the leader of OpenVox, wrote, “We can no longer guarantee that our modules will work with Puppet Core or Puppet Enterprise.”\n\nFrom the project maintainers’ viewpoint, Perforce is breaking compatibility. For now, though, OpenVox is essentially a healthy, community lifeboat rather than a full‑scale Puppet replacement ship.\n\nDespite the simple fact that we all depend on open source, all too many projects remain underfunded. Others, such as NET 6, are still popular, but their maintainers have quit supporting them. What’s a user to do?\n\nThis isn’t a new problem. Back in 2021, Tidelift, a security company that also financially supported open source maintainers, found that 46% of open source project maintainers received no pay at all. Almost as bad, even those who were paid, a mere 26% earn more than $1,000 per year for their work.\n\nThings have not improved. In fact, they’ve gotten worse. In 2024, Tidelift’s latest results showed that now 60% of open source maintainers are unpaid.\n\nAs  an open letter signed by 10 open source foundations  and published in September pointed out, “Most of these [open source] systems operate under a dangerously fragile premise: They are often maintained, operated, and funded in ways that rely on goodwill, rather than mechanisms that align responsibility with usage.”\n\nSo it is that, according to the open letter, “a small number of organizations absorb the majority of infrastructure costs, while the overwhelming majority of large-scale users, including commercial entities that generate demand and extract economic value, consume these services without contributing to their sustainability.”\n\nA specific example that I’ve been covering is how FFMpeg, which is used by everyone who watches videos over the Internet, is horribly underfunded, even as major companies such as Amazon, Google and Netflix depend on its code. There are many other such projects. This can not continue.\n\nThe answer is that companies must — Must — start financially supporting mission-critical open source projects. The cost to do this is minute compared to the damage they’d suffer if these projects folded or were hit by a major security problem.\n\nIn 2024, the xz data compression library code, which had been deliberately infected with malware, came close to inserting a backdoor into Fedora, Red Hat’s community Linux. Had it been successful, it might have ended up in Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and its clones.\n\nThis would have led to the greatest Linux security disaster to date. We dodged a bullet.\n\nUnfortunately, the open source software supply chain security is under sustained, high-volume attack, with npm- and PyPI-focused campaigns escalating.\n\nSeveral high-impact campaigns in 2025 centered on compromising open source package ecosystems, especially npm.\n\nIn November, researchers from Wiz, Aikido, and others detailed a “Shai-Hulud 2.0” wave of trojanized npm packages that exfiltrated developer and CI/CD credentials from environments using popular libraries tied to major Software as a Service and cloud tooling.\n\nTens of thousands of malicious repos were spun up as part of the campaign. GitLab’s vulnerability research team also reported a separate widespread npm supply chain attack that harvested credentials for GitHub, npm, and major clouds and propagated by infecting additional packages owned by victims.\n\nThese are not one-off instances. Industry threat reports in 2025 describe a surge in software supply chain attacks overall, with October setting a new monthly record, and open source ecosystems featuring prominently among the targets.\n\nAnalysis from Palo Alto Networks’ Unit 42 and other research teams notes that attackers increasingly prefer compromising maintainer accounts and publish pipelines rather than core source repos, because this path can silently poison trusted packages at scale.\n\nA study by ReversingLabs, released in March, reported that, while observed open source malware packages have declined somewhat, the risk has shifted toward leaked developer secrets and build-time exposures.\n\nResearchers examining popular npm, PyPI, and RubyGems components continue to find hard-coded credentials, weak application hardening, and exposed data inside widely used binaries deployed in enterprises. That kind of mistake was stupid back in the ’80s, when I first encountered it in production software, and it’s unforgivable today.\n\nMaking matters worse, security companies such as JFrog and Veracode report that exploding dependency graphs, faster release cycles, and heavy reuse of open source libraries mean a single malicious or vulnerable package can ripple through thousands of downstream applications in days.\n\nThis dense interconnection makes the blast radius of attacks like the npm-focused campaigns in 2025 significantly larger than that of many earlier open source incidents, especially when the target libraries appear in 20 to 30% of scanned cloud environments.\n\nWhat can we do about it? We must more broadly adopt software bills of materials (SBOMs), Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts (SLSA)-style attestations, and tools from the Open Source Software Foundation ecosystem to track provenance and integrity of open source components.\n\nOpenSSF and its partners highlight initiatives such as Sigstore for keyless signing, Scorecard for automated project risk assessment, and the Open Source Project Security Baseline, which aim to give both maintainers and consumers clearer security expectations.\n\nEvery year, I tell people that they must take security more seriously. Lately, as open source supply chain violations become ever more common, I’ve been saying you must ensure the code in your supply chain is both safe and written by someone trustworthy.\n\nLooking ahead, I can only redouble these warnings. Now we’ve already had serious security breaches in the last few years. You remember: Solarwinds, JetBrains TeamCity, and Apache Log4j should all come to mind quickly. As bad as those were, worse security disasters lie ahead if we don’t take open source supply chain security much more seriously.",
