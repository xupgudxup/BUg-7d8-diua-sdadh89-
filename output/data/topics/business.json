    "fullText": "It's a new year! And at Business Insider, we're already diving in.\n\nWe've always been the place for innovators, and AI's arrival is creating a renaissance for entrepreneurs of all stripes. It's led to whole new industries — from legal AI to chatbot training to vibe coding to the data center boom. Everyone is learning as they go, and we are here to help you generate ideas, trade notes, and get smarter. We'll chronicle highs and lows — there will for sure be both.\n\nAt larger firms, leaders will be sizing up which AI experiments are working, at what costs, and with what benefits. How fast AI helps companies' bottom lines will determine whether we're in bubble times in the markets. We're all over that in our new First Trade newsletter.\n\nAI is a big story line on Wall Street, but it's not the only one. This past year showed dents in basic assumptions about capitalism in the US — principles that have underscored the \"stocks for the long run\" thinking that has proven sound for investors. International markets are getting more of a look, especially with rearmament in Europe and AI as a global tailwind.\n\nBetween Washington's investments in business, Zohran Mamdani's rise in the nation's financial capital, and surveys showing eroding confidence in capitalism, that mindset is no longer the given it once was. We are launching a series this week, \"The Future of Capitalism,\" and what it means for your work and wealth. Take our survey, and watch Monday for our first piece!\n\nMeanwhile, in workplaces, capitalism is alive and well. The \"anti-woke workplace\" is increasingly in fashion, and we will help you navigate an era in which many managers, in a sharp shift, are more focused on employee performance than employee policies.\n\nOur obsession with side hustles is still a full-time job for us, whether your thing is real estate, brand influencing, Uber driving, or renting your clothing. And as our reporting showed this past year, a strong side hustle can not only be fun, but also crucial if white-collar layoffs snag you.\n\nSpeaking about clothing, you've made clear you care about how to show up to succeed at work. We're exploring the cost of that, and whether that cost is sometimes too high — for your wallet or your heart. We've also got you covered on style and status, from show-off golf shirts and luxury handbags to viral hoodies, coveted watches, and Wall Street's favorite $1,100 shoes.\n\nAll of which is to say, we're pumped to cover all that's ahead — in words, video, audio, newsletters, online and IRL events, and every way that works for you! As always, please stay in touch! Email me at eic@businessinsider.com.\n\nThe BI Today team: Jamie Heller, editor in chief, in New York. Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York.

    "title": "After getting laid off from a corporate job, I started bartending — and it changed my approach to office work",
    "description": "Marketing veteran Julie Levin briefly turned to bartending after being laid off. The experience changed her approach to corporate work.",
    "fullText": "After getting laid off in 2023, marketing veteran Julie Levin worked part time as a bartender for about six months as she considered her next steps. Levin is now the head of brand partnerships at Two Things, a New York City consultancy specializing in business transformations. The following has been edited for brevity and clarity.\n\nI moved across the country from LA to the New York area in 2022 for a really exciting job that I thought would mark the next phase of my career. But in 2023, there was a lot going on in the marketing industry, and I was laid off.\n\nIt was a setback I hadn't anticipated. It really called into question what was next for me. It's a scary place to be.\n\nI started doing some consulting, but I also wanted to be thoughtful and take time to calibrate. That's why I added bartending, which I'd done in college, into the mix. I thought it would be a way to have fun during a stressful time and make some extra money. It taught more lessons than I bargained for, in the best of ways.\n\nI had bartended at this place during the summer in college, when it was a dive. It's now fine dining with proper mixology. That meant it wasn't pouring beers and shots and easy high-balls. It was complex drinks. Not only did we have to follow the recipe for them at a high volume, but we were expected to create drinks.\n\nThere's nothing more humbling than getting behind the bar, because my corporate success wasn't relevant. The idea of not hiding behind a title was illuminating.\n\nI've always had a good work ethic, but bartending is next level. It's not just physical. There is an emotional element to it. Being behind that bar, engaging with people, and stripping away any artifice and pretense — it's a really cool thing.\n\nThere is this expectation, when you hear about people who bartend at a place like that, that you're going to walk out with 1,500 bucks every time. That's not true. It's really hard in the service industry. Bartending also shows you how good you have it in the corporate world.\n\nWhen I was bartending, there was an \"aha\" moment, and it was completely attitudinal. It's about getting more flies with honey. I think I was a late-bloomer in this sense — it didn't really dawn on me until I was behind the bar.\n\nThere were people who were full-time bartenders. When they were in a bad mood, they brought it with them. Meanwhile, you're this customer paying $20-plus a cocktail, just looking to have a nice time. You've got this surly bartender who acts like they're doing you a favor.\n\nInitially, I wanted to be part of things, and I'd complain alongside them. Then I was like, \"Wait a second. This is ridiculous. Put a smile on your face.\"\n\nIt's not that easy to stand there for eight hours and sling complicated drinks. But be pleasant; be happy — that's not that heavy of a lift. The second I did that, everything changed. It actually became the fun experience I thought it would be.\n\nAll of a sudden, I set this new tone, and it was transformational. That is something I try to carry with me. Bring a good attitude, even if you don't feel like you want to, and the circumstances suck, and your manager is the worst.\n\nPeople would be like, \"You're such a good bartender.\" The truth is, I wasn't that great. I was serviceable. Maybe, in time, I could have become amazing. But the attitude shift was infectious, and it made a huge difference.\n\nAfter bartending, I brought that spirit back to my team, and I got shout-outs all the time — not for the work I did, which I thought was pretty significant.\n\nThe praise largely came because I brought a positive attitude and a cheery spirit. No one would have said that about me for the first 20 years of my career. They would have said, \"She's really capable, really smart, but sometimes demanding and intense.\"\n\nPeople who lack the ability to roll up their sleeves and get in the weeds and also be nice to people — regardless of their title, or if they can do something for them — are going to have a really hard time.\n\nBartending forced me to rethink everything and see things that I wouldn't have seen, and enjoy every step of it, challenging and otherwise.\n\nIt teaches you the resilience and problem-solving capabilities to challenge yourself and be fearless. If you don't have those skill sets today, it's going to be hard for you to be successful.\n\nDo you have a story to share about your career? Contact this reporter at tparadis@businessinsider.com.",

    "fullText": "A group of about 20 US investors is already planning to travel to Venezuela in March, following Saturday's news that the country's president, Nicolás Maduro, had been taken into US custody.\n\nCharles Myers, the chairman of the political risk advisory firm Signum Global Advisors and a former vice-chairman of the investment advisory firm Evercore, told Business Insider that the mood among investors he has spoken to is one of \"cautious optimism\" following news of Maduro's ouster.\n\n\"I think the centerpiece of Venezuela's success, looking out 12 months or even 24 months, is foreign investment,\" Myers said. \"A big part of the Venezuela story, starting today, is foreign investment, especially in oil and gas, which is pretty straightforward, but there are massive opportunities in construction, in tourism.\"\n\nMyers said it's not the responsibility of his firm to take a \"moral position\" on whether it was right or wrong for the US to involve itself in Venezuela's government, but rather to help the firm's clients anticipate investment opportunities or mitigate risk due to geopolitical events.\n\nHowever, he added, his firm \"very much expected\" the situation in Venezuela would unfold as it has, and has been preparing investor groups to be ready to travel to the country when the opportunity presents itself. Signum previously hosted similar trips for asset managers and hedge funds to visit Syria and Ukraine.\n\n\"People have seen this coming, especially very smart investors, and many of them have actually bought bonds in anticipation of this,\" Myers said. \"But there's a very strong degree of cautious optimism, even more so than we saw with Syria, just because this is a United States-directed action.\"\n\n\"The United States will play a pivotal role in everything, especially the Venezuelan economy, starting today,\" Myers added, \"So, I think the reaction has been more enthusiastic than perhaps other situations like this.\"",

    "description": "Financial firms are planning trips to Venezuela to scout out new investment opportunities. Bill Ackman praised the move as \"good for America.\"",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump on Saturday announced that the US had conducted a raid on Venezuela, resulting in the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, and big names in business and foreign policy have been reacting as the aftermath unfolds.\n\nHere's what they've been saying:\n\nMyers, chairman of political risk consulting firm Signum Global Advisors, told Business Insider that foreign investment in oil, tourism, and construction will be the \"centerpiece\" of Venezuela's financial recovery going forward, adding that he expects the country's economy will grow \"faster over the next two years than people anticipate because of the extent or scale of foreign investment.\"\n\nMyers, also a former head of investment advisory firm Evercore, is planning a trip of 15-20 investors to visit Venezuela in March to identify investment opportunities. Signum Global Advisors has hosted similar trips for investor groups in Syria and Ukraine.\n\nBremmer, founder of the political risk research and consulting firm, Eurasia Group, in a post on LinkedIn, wrote that the \"US presumption is next Venezuelan leaders will now do what the Americans want because they've just seen the 'or else.'\"\n\nAccompanying the post was a photo of a drawing of a horse. The hindquarters of the horse were drawn in intricate detail, and labeled \"SOF operation to capture Maduro,\" referencing the special operations forces mission that was executed early Saturday. The horse's head was depicted as a rudimentary children's drawing, captioned \"plans for future of Venezuela.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't exactly call it a plan,\" Bremmer added.\n\nIn a separate post, he wrote: \"The law of the jungle is dangerous. What applies to your enemies one day can apply to you the next. Make no mistake where the world is heading here.\"\n\nThe billionaire hedge fund manager wrote in a post on X that \"The removal of Maduro will lower oil prices, which is good for America and very bad for Russia. A weaker Russian economy will increase the probability that the war in Ukraine ends sooner and on more favorable terms for Ukraine. And Putin will be sleeping in his safe room from this point going forward.\"\n\nGao is a senior fellow at the Center for International Governance Innovation and a law professor at Singapore Management University. In a series of posts on X, he said the raid on Caracas ushered in \"the brave new world of international law.\"\n\n\"Maduro's capture has triggered the biggest revival of international law since Grotius — and overnight turned everyone on X into an international law wonk, eager to compare Venezuela to Taiwan,\" he wrote.\n\n\"But China has never treated the Taiwan issue as a matter of international law,\" he continued. \"It has always been framed as an internal affair, with Taiwan regarded as a renegade province. The reason China has not acted is not because it lacks legal justification, but because it lacks the capability. Thus, US ops in Venezuela provide China with no additional legal justification.\"\n\nThe Democratic senator from Massachusetts is a former Harvard Law professor who holds deep expertise in bankruptcy and consumer finance. In a post on X, she wrote that Trump's action to seize Maduro, \"no matter how terrible a dictator he is — is unconstitutional and threatens to drag the US into further conflicts in the region.\"\n\n\"What does it mean that the US will 'run' Venezuela, and what will Trump do next around the world?\" Warren wrote. \"The American people voted for lower costs, not for Trump's dangerous military adventurism overseas that won't make the American people safer.\"\n\nThe Tesla and SpaceX CEO spent most of Saturday posting praise for the Trump administration and the military operations in Venezuela, posting that it was \"heartwarming to see so many Venezuelans celebrating their country freed from a brutal tyrant.\"\n\nIn another post, Musk retweeted a White House image of Maduro aboard the USS Iwo Jima after being apprehended, with the caption \"Congratulations, President Trump! This is a win for the world and a clear message to evil dictators everywhere.\"\n\nMusk and Trump have had a tumultuous relationship over the years, alternating between appearing to be close allies and trading sharp criticisms in the media.",

    "fullText": "New satellite imagery shows damage at a military facility in Caracas after the US carried out strikes as part of a surprise operation to capture Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.\n\nThe new imagery, captured on Saturday by the US spatial intelligence firm Vantor and obtained by Business Insider, shows damage around the Venezuelan military complex at Fuerte Tiuna in the southern part of Caracas.\n\nFuerte Tiuna is a critical military installation in Venezuela. It houses defense ministries and major commands, official residences, and other major strategic infrastructure. It was a primary target of the US mission.\n\nThe new imagery reveals significant damage to military storage buildings and equipment at the complex, including several vehicles, as well as destroyed security buildings at a gate to the facility.\n\nPresident Donald Trump revealed earlier on Saturday that the US carried out a highly complex raid to capture Maduro and extract him from the country to face drug-related charges in New York. The White House in August had placed a $50 million bounty on his head.\n\nThe bold operation began late Friday night and continued into the early hours of the next day, with US military aircraft — including fighter jets, surveillance planes, bombers, and drones — striking Venezuela's air defenses to clear a path for apprehension forces to locate Maduro.\n\nVenezuela's government said US forces targeted military and civilian areas and strongly condemned the strikes. Video footage shared on social media showed helicopters above Caracas, with large explosions and plumes of smoke rising from the city.\n\nDan Caine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters in Florida that the apprehension team, which included US law enforcement officers, broke into Maduro's fortified compound under heavy fire and took the Venezuelan president and his wife into custody.\n\nSeveral American personnel were injured in the raid, Trump revealed, and one helicopter took a hit. However, no one was killed, he said, and the US didn't lose any equipment. Maduro was flown to the US Navy amphibious assault ship USS Iwo Jima ahead of his transfer to New York.\n\nThe mission — dubbed \"Operation Absolute Resolve\" — followed months of escalating tensions between Trump and the Maduro regime and dozens of US military strikes against alleged narcotics-smuggling boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific.\n\nPrior to the mission, the US had established a large military presence around the Caribbean, and Trump had repeatedly threatened to pursue targets in Venezuela.\n\nCaine said that the audacious operation involved months of meticulous planning and rehearsal. That included building a replica of Maduro's compound, similar to what US special operations forces did ahead of the 2011 Osama bin Laden raid.\n\nThe operation on Saturday marks a significant escalation in the Trump administration's pressure campaign, which also saw the US seize Venezuela-linked oil tankers while imposing a naval blockade targeting sanctioned vessels.\n\nThe strikes raise questions about the future of Venezuela's leadership. Trump said the US will run the country\" until it can ensure a safe transition of power, although it's unclear how Washington will do that.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, has been encouraging American oil companies to become involved in the Venezuelan oil industry.\n\nSome world leaders have reacted strongly to the operation, including some from countries near Venezuela, who criticized the mission. They were joined by some Democratic US lawmakers. Many Republicans voiced their support.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio explained to reporters in Florida on Saturday that the Trump administration did not notify Congress ahead of the operation and only informed members afterward. The president defended the decision.",

    "fullText": "Critical Role's chief creative officer, Matthew Mercer, had been spearheading his eight-member crew's relentless push into the big leagues of nerdworld for 10 years.\n\nThat was until this July, when he announced that he'd be giving up control of one of the crew's biggest priorities, their long-running \"Dungeons & Dragons\" Twitch livestream.\n\nIn an August appearance on the podcast \"Crispy's Tavern: Tales and Tea,\" Mercer said he'd felt the threat of burnout and thought he needed a break. He said he'd started to feel a \"continuous need to produce creatively,\" which was \"a very draining and very scary thing.\"\n\nTo be sure, Mercer and his seven cofounders still have a full slate of projects to work on. That includes an ongoing sold-out arena tour, as well as two Amazon-backed animated series on Prime Video. Mercer also has a key role in the team's game publishing arm, Darrington Press, home to \"Daggerheart,\" their flagship game and their answer to \"D&D.\"\n\nStill, Mercer says, it's important to be able to admit when you're done, and to give yourself permission to step away from the work for as long as you need to.\n\n\"My biggest advice for burnout is to acknowledge when you're at the edge and take every opportunity you can to step away and replenish your cup,\" Mercer told Business Insider.\n\nBrennan Lee Mulligan of \"Dimension 20\" fame, Mercer's longtime friend and collaborator, is the game master for Campaign Four, the team's ongoing \"D&D\" stream. Mulligan taking over the main stream means Mercer is no longer solely in charge of captaining the team's regular episodes, which often run to the four-hour mark.\n\n\"There's this concept, the idea that just pushing through and sometimes necessity requires you to do that to a certain point,\" Mercer said.\n\n\"But I find walking away and taking some time to enrich your creative input means that whatever time you lost beating your head against the wall will be more than made up for when you can return from a place of genuine inspiration and renewal,\" Mercer added.\n\nCampaign Four airs on Beacon, Critical Role's in-house streaming platform, as well as on Twitch and YouTube.",

    "fullText": "Aviation investigators are continuing to examine the cause of a deadly private jet crash that killed retired NASCAR driver Greg Biffle, his immediate family, and three others earlier this month in North Carolina.\n\nThe crash occurred around 10:15 a.m. on December 18, when a Cessna Citation 550 business jet owned by Biffle went down near Statesville Regional Airport shortly after takeoff. Seven people were killed, including Biffle, his wife Cristina, their children Emma and Ryder, family friends Craig Wadsworth and Dennis Dutton, and Dutton’s son, Jack.\n\nAccording to accounts from people familiar with the flight, the jet experienced a serious problem almost immediately after leaving the runway. Witnesses described a loud popping sound during takeoff, followed by the aircraft circling back toward the airport. Public flight data later showed the plane climbing sharply before turning back, with speed and altitude fluctuating as conditions worsened in low clouds and drizzle.\n\nThe aircraft ultimately struck light poles, clipped trees, and exploded less than a mile from the runway. No distress call was reported before the crash.\n\nFormer NASCAR driver Kenny Wallace, a close friend of Biffle, later shared his personal theory while acknowledging the investigation is ongoing. Wallace suggested the aircraft may have lost one engine during takeoff, creating excessive drag that prevented the pilots from maintaining control despite applying maximum power to the remaining engine.\n\nFederal officials confirmed the jet crashed while attempting to land, and both the Federal Aviation Administration and National Transportation Safety Board are investigating. The cockpit voice recorder has been recovered, though final conclusions could take many months.\n\nWeather conditions at the time included poor visibility, fog, and light drizzle. Aviation experts reviewing flight data have pointed to a possible single-engine failure combined with challenging visual conditions during the attempted return.\n\nDutton, one of the pilots, was a recently retired Delta Air Lines captain with four decades of aviation experience. His son Jack, an Auburn University student, had recently earned his FAA instrument rating and aspired to become a professional pilot.\n\nFamily members later revealed the group had been traveling to Florida for a birthday trip. The tragedy has deeply shaken the racing and aviation communities as investigators work to determine what went wrong in the flight’s final minutes.",

    "description": "Tesla's stock has hit record highs over its robotaxi rollout, but the company's EV business is struggling.",
    "fullText": "Tesla ended a roller coaster year with its sales going into reverse.\n\nElon Musk's automaker said on Friday that it sold 418,227 electric vehicles in the fourth quarter, down by 15.6% from the same period in 2024.\n\nIt means Tesla's annual sales have declined for the second consecutive year, and that Chinese rival BYD has surpassed Tesla for the first time in annual sales of battery-electric vehicles.\n\nWall Street analysts were expecting the company to sell around 441,000 EVs, per data compiled by Bloomberg, while Tesla released its own, more pessimistic, analyst consensus forecast of 422,850 units in an unusual move earlier this week.\n\nBYD said on Thursday that sales of its battery-powered cars rose nearly 28% to 2.26 million units in 2025. Tesla said it delivered about 1.64 million vehicles for the year.\n\nTesla recorded its first-ever annual sales decline in 2024, after years of explosive growth. The latest figures suggest the company has been hit hard by the demise of the $7,500 tax credit for new EVs in September.\n\nThe looming deadline saw US buyers race to snap up electric vehicles, driving record sales for Tesla and other automakers.\n\nOnce the tax credit ended, however, EV sales dropped across the board, including at Tesla's rivals Ford, Hyundai, and Kia.\n\nThe slump saw Tesla's sales hit their lowest level since 2022 in November, despite the brand rolling out cheaper versions of its bestselling Model 3 and Y vehicles a month before.\n\nTesla has also faced difficulties this year in Europe and China, two of its biggest international markets.\n\nIn China, the EV giant has faced fierce competition from local rivals offering high-tech electric models at rock-bottom prices.\n\nTesla's sales have plummeted in Europe amid backlash over CEO Musk's endorsement of far-right German party AfD, with December registrations dropping 66% year-over-year in France and 44% in Spain, according to national auto association data.\n\nAnalysts previously told Business Insider that Tesla is also suffering from a stale product lineup. The company has not launched a new vehicle since the Cybertruck in 2023, and the divisive pickup has been a sales disappointment.\n\nDespite these headwinds, Tesla's stock price hit a record high in December as investors expressed optimism over the automaker's robotaxi rollout.\n\nTesla launched a robotaxi service in Austin in June and has ambitious plans to expand autonomous ride-hailing to multiple cities in the US this year.\n\nMusk has said the company's future lies in its robotaxi and Optimus robot initiatives, and the Austin-based automaker is preparing to begin mass production in April of its Cybercab robotaxi, which does not have a steering wheel or pedals.\n\nIn an earnings call in October, Musk said that the looming launch of Tesla's \"unsupervised\" Full Self-Driving software would boost demand for the company's vehicles, and told investors that the robotaxi service in Austin would operate without safety monitors by the end of 2025.\n\nMusk said on December 24 that he took a ride around Austin without a safety driver, but as of Wednesday, they were still sitting inside vehicles available to the public.",

    "title": "We asked you to vote on a $120K remote or $240K in-office job. The results were closer than we expected.",
    "description": "Respondents to Business Insider's survey were split between in-person and virtual work. The virtual option won out by one vote.",
    "fullText": "We asked: Would you prefer a $240,000 in-office job or a $120,000 remote one?\n\nThe Business Insider readers who responded were split down the middle, with the lower-paying virtual job narrowly winning out by just one vote.\n\n365 readers answered Business Insider's informal survey following the debate's TikTok virality. 183 answered that they would choose the $120,000 remote gig, while 182 chose to go five days in-person for double the salary.\n\nIn follow-up conversations, eight respondents — four on each side — explained to Business Insider why they made their choices.\n\nWhile the reader survey isn't scientific, the results, and the reasons people gave us for why they voted the way they did, offer insight into how workers today view the tradeoffs.\n\nIn 2018, Arlton Lowry packed a bag and traveled from Little Rock, Arkansas, to Bali.\n\nThe 44-year-old owner of a digital product design agency spent seven weeks working remotely, waking up at 1 a.m. and scootering through paddy fields to a coworking space where he clocked in on Central Time.\n\nLowry voted for the remote option. That trip wouldn't be possible if his company wasn't remote-first, he said, and the flexibility is a benefit for his employees as well.\n\n\"If it wasn't for remote-based work, we probably wouldn't be able to attract and retain the talent that we have,\" he said.\n\nRespondents who chose the lower-salary remote option prized flexibility and the absence of a rigid corporate culture. It's about more than doing your laundry or squeezing in a workout, they said; it's about freedom.\n\nBetty Chen said she was tired of dealing with other people's egos. After corporate jobs at Autodesk and Cisco, Chen decided to go freelance before the pandemic. Now, the 49-year-old San Francisco resident does contract UX design and boards dogs in her home.\n\n\"I'm so much happier,\" Chen said. \"I did better working with animals, not doomscrolling. Touch grass.\"\n\nChen also enjoys not having to put on makeup. \"As a woman going into the office, there's another half hour of maintenance,\" she said.\n\nThose who chose the in-person option say that flexibility comes at the cost of organizational performance. American Edge Project CEO Doug Kelly said that there was a \"chemistry\" to bringing people together.\n\n\"I would rather pay people more to be on-site working with me,\" the 60-year-old Columbus, Ohio resident said. \"It increases the product that the company is making and the creativity overall.\"\n\nDominic Sharlette agreed: \"You have to be in the office to get great products made.\"\n\nSharlette is a 59-year-old health tech worker based in New York. He works five days in-person, and said he is happy that way. Jobs like customer service could be done remotely, he said, but work that's \"pushing innovation\" must be done face-to-face.\n\nThen there's the salary question. The prompt offered double the pay — $240,000 compared to $120,000 — for in-person attendance. For some, the money was enough.\n\nJennifer Rasmussen, a 44-year-old logistics worker from Fargo, North Dakota, likes her fully remote job. As she called me, her golden retrievers lay next to her. But the perks of $240,000 were too strong not to influence her vote.\n\n\"The quality of life for my entire family would improve with a salary at that level,\" she said.\n\nRasmussen's kids are still young. The money would help her family travel internationally or hire childcare and cleaning help. She could also save more money for retirement, she said.\n\nAmy Leonard, a 42-year-old community college teacher from San Jose, California, said she would choose the virtual job so she could move elsewhere. The Bay Area has a notoriously high cost of living. Leonard said that most of her money now went to basic expenses, such as gas and food.\n\n\"I could definitely take that, move somewhere else, and probably own a house instead of having to rent,\" Leonard said.\n\nIn her debate-sparking TikTok, influencer Tinx said that she could immediately guess the generation of the individual consider the half-salary remote option: Gen Z.\n\nIn the video, Tinx said that time in the office could do Gen Z some good. \"It'll make you all less weird,\" she said.\n\nPriya Chaudhari, a 20-year-old student at the University of Georgia, said that much of her generation actually preferred to be in-person. The in-office push was a \"rebound\" from an adolescence on screens, she said. Chaudhari and some of her friends have chosen to get off social media.\n\nChaudhari said she would opt for the $240,000 salary, citing the pay difference and her own extroversion. \"I really thrive off working with other people,\" she said.\n\nPedro Ochoa posed the question to his four-person team. The 45-year-old manager of business intelligence said the team was split generationally, with the younger colleagues opting for higher pay and the older colleagues choosing the remote work role.\n\nYounger workers see \"very hard outcomes for their careers,\" the Dallas resident said, so they want to claim as much income and experience as they can while they're still employed. Older workers care more about raising their families, he said.\n\nOchoa put himself in the latter camp. He'd take the remote option.",

    "title": "5 of the most popular stories from Business Insider's year-long series on America's oldest workers",
    "description": "Check out five of Business Insider's most popular stories from its year-long series on America's oldest workers, titled 80 Over 80.",
    "fullText": "A 90-year-old working as a cook at a convenience store. A 93-year-old applying for jobs. An 81-year-old who had to leave her Home Depot job early because she struggled to breathe. These are among the most impactful stories of Business Insider's 80 over 80 series.\n\nBusiness Insider spent most of 2025 interviewing Americans in their 80s and beyond who are still working. We followed hundreds of older workers across the country as they navigated rising costs, health challenges, perceived ageism, and changing ideas about what work and retirement are supposed to look like.\n\nReaders responded strongly to these stories, and we received hundreds of notes from people of all ages sharing their perspectives on the issues the series explored. Many shared their own experiences with working late into their careers, highlighting the value of work and the challenges of clocking in each day. Others who were much younger shared that the stories gave them a new perspective on aging and preparing for retirement.\n\nHere are five of the stories that resonated the most — ones readers spent the most time with and shared widely. Together, they offer a revealing look at what readers were most eager to learn about when it comes to working late in life.\n\nLydia Hinds, now 82, wrote to me back in 2024 about how she worked part-time at Home Depot after a series of mistakes and unfortunate events. Her business closed at the start of the pandemic, and much of her and her husband's money never came back after the 2008 recession. She also said she had heart failure, which made her job much more challenging. Lydia's daughter doesn't speak with her, and they had no other people to rely on financially.\n\nOver the course of a few months, I got to know Lydia and her husband, Bill, before making the three-hour trip to central Connecticut, where I spent two days with them. I shadowed Lydia at work and spoke with her coworkers, ate dinner with them at their home, and drove with Bill to a doctor's appointment. I was joined by a photographer, who captured them in their moments of vulnerability, joy, and uncertainty.\n\nThe story resonated far and wide. Leading experts in the aging and retirement space reached out to share their praise, calling the story \"magnificent\" and \"heartbreaking.\" Dozens of workers in similar situations shared their stories candidly. Younger readers wrote to me that they hoped to never be in her situation.\n\nSince the article came out, Lydia stopped working for Home Depot as her condition worsened and has invested most of her time in founding an online business selling funny gift cards, bags, and clothes.\n\nI first connected with Patricia Willson, now 94, in August. Over multiple phone calls, we spoke for hours about her life in Eureka Springs, Arkansas, a small tourist town in the Ozark Mountains. I visited her for two days in September with a photographer so I could see how she lived, what applying to jobs looked like at 93, and how work and severe health challenges intermingled.\n\nPoignant scenes from that trip — her having her leg wrapped by her nurse, sitting at her computer editing her cover letter, and showing me her mother's bible — illustrated Willson's fight to stay as healthy as she could while trying to find another income source.\n\nThe article resonated with readers who were themselves struggling with health issues while traversing the difficult job market. Willson's story, along with a half dozen others featured in the article, sparked discussions online about what went wrong such that people in their 80s and 90s have to work while battling cancer, lymphedema, back issues, or heart failure. This story was particularly popular among readers in their 50s and 60s, some of whom feared they would face similar challenges.\n\nThis popular story was our main foray into data analysis for the series. For the first time in the media, we broke down the demographics of America's oldest workers, along with the industries and occupations they work in. The results were somewhat surprising — working at schools was the most common industry, though construction was second. Thousands of workers were truck drivers, retail salespeople, personal care aides, and farmers.\n\nThis oldest workforce, which continues to grow, is very diverse, and many readers were shocked by the number of workers still going into their 80s and 90s. Some readers remarked that the data suggested older workers were much more valuable in certain industries than they may have imagined. Many also remarked that it will be less rare in a few years to see people working at 85.\n\nThis was the most popular story of the series, written as a personal essay as told to a reporter. Richard Smith, 81, had reached out to share his story about \"work camping,\" which is when people take on work while living in RVs or campers. In Smith's case, he found work at a campsite in New Hampshire for half the year; the other half of the year, he lives in Florida. He supplements his income by driving for DoorDash.\n\nSmith was able to follow his passions while needing to work for financial reasons. The lifestyle in many ways is cheaper than the daily costs of living in a house, but in some ways, it was a forced decision, as he didn't save enough for retirement.\n\nMany readers were surprised that at 81, Smith was working seven days a week and living out of his motor coach. Some readers applauded his creativity and his nontraditional living situation, with some writing that they would consider work camping for themselves. Others said his story put them at ease, as he was able to make life work with limited assets. A few readers commented that they viewed his optimism as inspiring, as he had many options if his health or finances went further south.\n\nThis story on Vince Scidone, now 91, blew up in the days after it was posted in early September. Scidone, a former carpenter, works part-time for a convenience store chain in Oklahoma, earning $14.90 an hour as a cook. He is on his feet for much of the day in the job, which was one of the only ones he could find when he started looking last year after months of rejections.\n\nWhat readers grasped onto about Scidone's story was how, at 89, he began applying for jobs after his wife got sick. Since she could no longer work, Scidone said the extra income was necessary for helping them stay afloat after a recent home purchase. His health hasn't interfered too much with his job.\n\nReaders found it compelling that Scidone was so positive about his situation, even though he wishes he could retire and never have to worry about money. Some were heartbroken by how he felt guilty for not having a lot of money to pass down to their children and grandchildren. As with many readers, Scidone spoke about his situation while in a state of limbo, where he plays every day by ear. His uncertainty, and his grit, stayed with readers, as some attested to in emails.",

    "fullText": "The must-read story in the $5 trillion hedge fund industry used to be about who made the biggest trade or launched the biggest fund. Now it's about who made the biggest hire or got the biggest guaranteed payout.\n\nAs the increasingly institutional space has veered away from star funds run by a single genius to sprawling investment platforms with dozens of investing teams, the industry has grappled with a shortage of talent.\n\nIt's now such a finite resource that top portfolio managers are commanding deals that resemble those of professional athletes, and top managers accustomed to poaching their choice of talent by paying top dollar are now developing more talent in-house to cut expenses.\n\nBusiness Insider has closely covered the evolution of hedge funds. See our stories below on the state of play, how the industry is changing, and who the new stars are as a result.\n\nThe numbers are staggering, with guaranteed nine-figure payouts and yearslong non-compete clauses, but the anecdotes of what it's like inside the biggest funds are just as startling.\n\nBig-name funds churn through underperformers, giving PMs \"moment-by-moment paranoia,\" according to one former investor. Firms dangle potential relocation to tax havens like Puerto Rico and Dubai to entice top traders. Recruiters are being pushed into ethical gray areas to determine the truth about potential hires.\n\nWhenever this much money is flowing, there's bound to be ripple effects. Within hedge funds, this means the introduction of both new industry players and new roles within the largest firms.\n\nAs with any gold rush, people are picking up an ax in the hopes of carving out a little piece for themselves. It's up to the powers-that-be of the industry to decide what's real and what's fool's gold.\n\nOne subset of the industry that has been thrust into the spotlight during the talent is the individuals who find top PMs.\n\nRecruiters and business development professionals at the industry's biggest managers have seen their own worth soar in recent years. With a steady flow of fresh capital into hedge funds, this cohort is likely to remain in demand for years to come.",

    "title": "Inside BCG's AI product assembly line: 'Every company has to become a tech company'",
    "description": "Scott Wilder, a partner at BCG, went in-depth with Business Insider on how the firm is shifting from services to AI-driven products.",
    "fullText": "When it comes to creating AI tools, Boston Consulting Group is \"all in,\" Scott Wilder, a Dallas-based partner at the firm, told Business Insider.\n\nAbout 15 months ago, the firm launched an internal research and development lab — one of several ways in which it is developing new AI-based technology to facilitate its work.\n\n\"Every company has to become a tech company,\" he said. \"BCG is no exception.\"\n\nEver since OpenAI unveiled ChatGPT in 2022, generative AI has become the shiny object companies can't ignore. And consulting firms from McKinsey to BCG — once known for their strategy and advisory services — are shifting more toward building, implementing, and maintaining AI tools for clients.\n\nWilder, who studied computer science at the University of Texas - Austin, said that \"as a computer scientist, it's fascinating to see a services firm shift this way.\"\n\nAt BCG, generative AI innovation now happens at three levels, Wilder said.\n\nFirst, there's the data level, which is driven by data engineers. \"We're in a phase where we're really starting to leverage our internal proprietary data,\" Wilder said.\n\nWilder said BCG is building MCP servers and agents on top of its internal and selected public data sources so AI tools can automatically pull the right information at the right time — a shift he sees as the future of AI, where model intelligence is increasingly tied to knowing which data to use and when.\n\nThen there is a \"middle layer\" of innovation that comes from consultants building tools and agents for client projects, Wilder said. When one of these tools is a hit, it goes back to the R&D team, which integrates them into a central marketplace for the rest of the firm to use.\n\nLastly, there's a top layer of executives developing firm-wide tools.\n\nThese include Deckster, a slideshow editor trained on 800 to 900 slide templates that helps consultants quickly create presentations, which also has its own development team. There's also Ava, an internal help tool for IT issues, HR questions, and other internal requests. There's also GENE, a conversational chatbot the firm uses for presentations, podcasts, and publicity initiatives.\n\nWilder said the firm has about seven or eight tools at the top level.\n\nThe firm also has a team of \"forward-deployed consultants\" — a role inspired by the forward-deployed engineers popularized by Palantir — who are vibe-coding and building tools for clients, Wilder said.\n\n\"We put our best of the best globally on cases, and they build reusable things. That then goes back to the R&D team,\" he said. \"So we're seeing a lot of innovation happen from that. A lot of it has to happen at the rock face, on the case teams, versus centrally.\"\n\nThese consultants rely on a mix of external coding platforms and internal resources to build tools, including OpenAI's ChatGPT. BCG bills itself as the No. 1 creator of custom GPTs globally, and has created about 36,000 so far, Wilder said.\n\nSimultaneously, the firm's new R&D team works on disseminating these innovations internally.\n\nWhen the R&D team launched about 15 months ago, its mandate was to build knowledge graphs from the firm's slide decks, transcripts, and other internal documents. Knowledge graphs are typically used to organize and connect data across multiple sources. So, with a meeting transcript, for example, the R&D team would aim to extract not just words, but also concepts and sentiments, Wilder said.\n\nNow, the team works on fleshing out ideas that consultants working with clients on the front lines generate.\n\nWilder said that new tools are also screened by BCG's red teaming team, which simulates adversarial exercises to address a tool's security vulnerabilities. It is also reviewed by the data protection office to ensure compliance with data privacy laws, undergoes a legal review, and is assessed for information security.\n\nOnce it's ready, it's passed on to the firm's marketplace team, which integrates it into a central repository of tools for the rest of the firm to use, Wilder said. \"There's actually an agent,\" he said. \"This orchestration agent, basically, helps people understand what are the best tools and data within BCG to use.\"\n\nWilder said the firm prides itself on a \"bottom-up\" approach to innovation. \"Probably 80% of our custom GPTs come from the front line,\" he said.\n\nThe new ideas also surface through the firm's \"enablement network.\" This is a team of about a thousand people from every department, from human resources to legal, that functions like learning and development coordinators, training the rest of the firm on AI.\n\nThey also double as \"our eyes and ears,\" Wilder said.\n\nThe team meets monthly to share ideas and insights they've gathered through their work with various teams.\n\nBCG now operates much like a traditional product organization, Wilder said.\n\nBetween its dedicated product teams and a \"UX Center of Excellence,\" which constantly evaluates what's working and identifies which agents still need to be built through frontline user research, BCG feeds those insights back to product owners, who then funnel the feedback into a centralized crowdsourcing pipeline.\n\n\"In short,\" Wilder said, \"we're doing all the things you'd expect a product organization to do.\"",

    "title": "The proposals NYC business leaders say they can live with under Zohran Mamdani, according to his CEO whisperer",
    "description": "Yasser Salem has built a business council to advise Mamdani if he wins. The McKinsey alum explains that bosses are open to free childcare.",
    "fullText": "Editor's note: This piece originally ran on November 4, 2025, ahead of Zohran Mamdani's electoral win. We are resharing the story on January 1, when he will be sworn in as mayor of New York City.\n\nIf you read the tabloids, the eve of a potential Zohran Mamdani mayorality has turned Billionaire's Row into 1975 Saigon, with everyone looking to hitch the last flight to Palm Beach.\n\nTo put it more bluntly, the city's wealthiest and most powerful business leaders have some qualms with Mamdani's socialist platform.\n\nHowever, the story is not so simple, says Yasser Salem, a former McKinsey executive building a business council to advise Mamdani if he wins the mayoral election. Sure, the word socialism can cause some tension, Salem, the head of OneNYC, a pro-Mamdani PAC, said, but there are some surprising areas of overlap.\n\nSome, like Jamie Dimon, have softened their message in public as they've gotten to know the candidate. Similarly, in conversations with more than 70 CEOs, Salem told Business Insider that some platform planks, such as universal childcare, are acceptable to many in the city's business community.\n\n\"Some of them have said from the beginning that they understand policies like free childcare as a way to lower the burden of worry, concern, and issues that their employees have that prevent them from being productive at work,\" Salem said. Others took more time, but the affordability crisis is unavoidable.\n\nAccording to a recent study of public data released by his PAC, the average New York family spends over 25% of its income on care for just one child. The group proposes several public-private models for childcare, including some where the costs are shared by the government and the employer — an idea, Salem said, that has \"widespread support.\"\n\nBusiness leaders' main concerns aren't surprising: Mamdani's public safety plans will make the city less safe, and housing proposals will exacerbate the city's housing crisis.\n\nHowever, even in housing, there are areas of agreement, Salem said.\n\nBusiness leaders criticized Mamdani's plan to freeze the rent for rent-stabilized apartments, arguing it would worsen shortages, noting that Mayor de Blasio had tried rent freezes that failed to address the long-term crisis.\n\nStill, both sides agree the long-term fix is boosting supply, Salem said.\n\nThe difference between the business community and Mamdani is in their time horizon. Mamdani's rent-freeze message could help lower rents now and satisfy voters, while his plans for zoning reform and building 200,000 \"truly-affordable\" apartments can solve the deeper problem over time.\n\n\"Are we solving for rent prices going down in four years? Are we solving for rent prices going down today?\" said Salem. \"Because if you're solving for rent prices going down today, supply is not going to do it.\"\n\nAs far as public safety, Salem said the announcement that Mamdani would seek to keep Jessica Tisch on as NYPD commissioner has helped alleviate fears that the city would become more dangerous under Mayor Mamdani.\n\nBusiness leaders also wanted to know how Mamdani's new Department of Community Safety, which would deploy civilian mental health responders to subway stations and to answer some emergency calls, would work.\n\n\"For example, a McDonald's owner in a tough neighborhood gets somebody coming in causing trouble,\" Salem said. \"Do they call 911 and get a mental health worker rather than a police officer?\"\n\nThe answer, Salem told Business Insider, is that these changes will be \"additive\" and that mental health workers will join \"alongside, not replacing the officers on the scene.\"\n\nSurprisingly, he said, taxes don't come up as a big fear. CEOs told them they're willing to pay more if they \"feel that New York is a better place to live as a result.\"\n\nThe announcement that Tisch was staying on helped alleviate some of the more intangible fears of the city's business elite, too, said Salem, such as Mamdani's inexperience or his ideological commitments to socialism, or to the pro-Palestine cause.\n\nAnd Salem, who doesn't consider himself a socialist but instead a \"pro-responsible capitalist,\" also said that he would try to get CEOs to focus on their specific disagreements with Mamdani's policies, rather than focusing on \"labels\" like socialism.\n\nSalem tells CEOs that Mamdani is looking to expand the social safety net, not expropriate their wealth.\"He's not saying we're going to go from the corporate tax rate being 25% to being 75%,\" Salem said.",

    "title": "How Google, Microsoft, Walmart, and other corporate giants are preparing for an aging workforce",
    "description": "Business Insider reached out to more than 75 major employers, including Walmart and Google, about their efforts to support aging workers.",
    "fullText": "Corporate America is facing a silver tsunami — and some companies are better prepared than others.\n\nWalmart is redesigning jobs to keep older workers on the payroll. Microsoft is offering what it calls \"wraparound care\" to support healthy aging. Google is coaching its employees to prepare for retirement. Some smaller companies have introduced chief longevity officers to help workers navigate health, wellness, and the transition into retirement.\n\nThese are some of the initiatives companies shared with Business Insider, after we contacted more than 75 major employers about their efforts to support aging workers.\n\nFifteen responded and shared policies that address healthcare and well-being, career longevity, flexible work arrangements, and retention. Many of the companies contacted employ thousands of people working past retirement age. Most didn't respond or declined to comment.\n\nAt Walmart, the largest private employer in the US, about 13.3% of the workforce — or over 200,000 employees — is over 60 years old, and more than 300,000 employees have a tenure of more than 10 years.\n\n\"We want to be a great place to work during every stage of life,\" a spokesperson said. \"People come here for a first job or a second career, and we have associates from 16 to 100.\"\n\nThomas Magnuson, 83, has worked as a yard driver at a Walmart facility in Wisconsin since 1999. A few years ago, he transitioned to an asset protection position, where he monitors fire systems and recertifies employees who use certain equipment. Magnuson said he doesn't have enough savings to retire. He described the work, which pays low six figures, as fulfilling.\n\nRuth Finkelstein, a professor of public health at Hunter College, said employers should provide mentorship and flexibility to workers of all ages.\n\n\"People reach their peak earnings in their 50s and then gradually decrease after that until they abruptly decrease after retirement,\" Finkelstein said. \"We should have retirement security adequate to meet people's needs without them having to work for their whole lives, and we should have legislation that's much stronger than that against employment discrimination.\"\n\nSome of the biggest names in the retail, entertainment, and food sectors have proposed age-friendly policies and initiatives to support older workers.\n\nCVS Health has developed programs to attract mature workers and develop their skills. Many of Disney's employees are in their second or third career, said Tami Garcia, executive vice president of people and culture at Disney Experiences. The company gives out the Walt Disney Legacy Award and holds service anniversary ceremonies.\n\n\"For many, having a role at one of our Disney parks is a second or even third career, and we deeply value the experience, wisdom, and mentorship that can bring,\" Garcia said. \"From celebrating milestone anniversaries — including 50+ years of service — to honoring those who embody Walt Disney's legacy through our recognition programs, we showcase respect, care, and appreciation for our Cast Members.\"\n\nSome companies have prioritized certain accommodations, such as flexible work schedules. A Starbucks spokesperson told Business Insider that the company's \"Back to Starbucks\" strategy has invested over $500 million in operational improvements and the workplace experience, which could benefit older workers looking for more flexibility. The spokesperson said that 85% of employees receive their preferred shifts.\n\nEllen Ernst Kossek, a professor at Purdue University who studies work-life relationships, said companies should consider reducing the workloads of older employees, helping these workers adapt to new technologies, and finding ways to challenge age-related stereotypes.\n\n\"There's a stereotype that older workers are not as current, but just as you would train new workers or encourage people to get a certificate, they could adapt their strategies to look for people with AI skills and encourage people to keep their skills up,\" Kossek said.\n\nSome companies told Business Insider that they've adopted certain benefits, such as greater access to medical care, which may help older workers stay healthy and avoid early retirement due to medical issues.\n\nThis can be beneficial to both companies and their workers. Older workers can increase corporate healthcare costs, since the majority of people aged 65 and older have a chronic disease, said Dr. Susan Mueller, senior director of health equity and well-being at global advisory firm WTW.\n\nWalgreens offers benefits for \"balancing work with caregiving responsibilities, preparing for retirement, or seeking proactive health and financial well-being support,\" a spokesperson said. UnitedHealth Group provides legal services for estate planning and family law, and supports workers navigating menopause or cancer diagnoses.\n\nA Google spokesperson said the company gives employees access to financial coaching for retirement and personalized assistance for managing caregiving. The company offers benefits such as cancer testing and support, no-cost medical second opinions, and no-cost virtual primary care.\n\nA Microsoft spokesperson emphasized the company's paid time off for caregiving for loved ones with a serious illness and wraparound care to support healthy aging.\n\nFedEx has launched comprehensive medical benefits and support networks, such as its Choose Well Care Connect advocacy program, which guides members through life-altering diagnoses. FedEx launched a Fast Pass in certain markets to guarantee members a primary care appointment within 10 days or less. The company's corporate responsibility report notes that FedEx is testing home health capabilities in areas with limited healthcare opportunities.\n\nTopics like AI and climate change are garnering more attention in corporate America than the aging workforce, according to a Business Insider analysis of earnings calls, 10-Ks, and interviews.\n\nThat's a concern to some experts on aging, who say companies need to be doing more to prepare for shifting demographics.\n\nMueller said companies should develop programs that control costs for employees needing medical assistance; establish internal guidelines to help employees navigate the healthcare system; add virtual primary care; and hire external companies specializing in common medical conditions.\n\nMadonna Harrington Meyer, a sociology professor at Syracuse University, said that during economically hard times, older workers are often the first to be laid off and the last to be rehired.\n\nHarrington Meyer said companies should focus on accessibility and safety. They should arrange parking spots near office entrances, ensure good lighting and soundproofing for sensory needs, and maintain functional elevators.\n\nGraham Pearce, global defined benefit segment leader at the consulting firm Mercer, said some companies will need to confront an\"unconscious bias\" against older workers — often seen as less adaptable or more prone to illness. Progress may require legislative action, he said.\n\nThe bipartisan Protect Older Job Applicants Act was introduced in September to prohibit age-based applicant sorting for employers, ensure \"disparate impact\" protections apply to employees and applicants, and require government oversight on age discrimination claims.\n\nRep. Bobby Scott, a Democrat from Virginia who co-led the bill, told Business Insider that he hopes age discrimination will be considered \"as illegal as discrimination based on race, color, creed, national origin, or sex.\" He added that if more people have employment opportunities later in life, it could stimulate the economy and help people age with dignity.\n\nIn September, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, a Democrat from New York, introduced the bipartisan Protecting Older Americans Act, which would end forced arbitration clauses prohibiting victims of age discrimination from suing their employer.\n\n\"We know that forced arbitration often discriminates against the plaintiff, and for a lot of older Americans, they don't have the resources to mount significant litigations against an employer who discriminates against them,\" Gillibrand told Business Insider. \"We believe that if you have the right of the Constitution to go to a trial and to be judged by your peers, older Americans would do better in these lawsuits.\"\n\nIn a statement to Business Insider, Sen. Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat from Wisconsin, said that the separate Protecting Older Workers Against Discrimination Act would help level the playing field for older workers and combat age discrimination.\n\n\"We need to do more to make sure that every American can plan and save for a secure retirement, but as more and more of our neighbors are forced to work later in life just to make ends meet, we need to make sure everyone — regardless of their age — has protections and dignity in the workplace,\" Baldwin said.",

    "description": "Among the flood of advice I've received, read, and reported on in 2025, here's what stuck with me the most.",
    "fullText": "There's an overwhelming amount of business advice out there.\n\nI hear a lot of it, by nature of my reporting and asking successful entrepreneurs what they wished they'd done differently, or what they'd tell prospective founders. Ever since starting my own business selling pickleball paddles — inspired by the plethora of Amazon sellers I interview — I hear even more (often unsolicited) advice. Everyone has something to say.\n\nAmong the flood of advice I've received, read, and reported on in 2025, here's what stuck with me the most.\n\nI know it sounds clichéd to \"follow your passion,\" but if you're starting a business — especially as a side hustle — you don't want it to feel like work. You don't want it to feel like a pesky chore, because it's what you'll be doing at the end of your workday on a Wednesday night, or at the start of your weekend on a Saturday morning.\n\nEven when you're not dedicating time to the business, it has a way of seeping into your shower thoughts or preventing you from falling asleep at night. If something is going to take up so much space, it might as well be something you care about.\n\nMy business partner and I weren't always going to sell pickleball paddles. That idea came from a conversation with a top Amazon seller, whom we consulted in the ideation stage. He encouraged us to think about our interests and how we generally spend our time. \"What do you like? What are you good at?\" he asked us. \"Start there.\"\n\nAs former collegiate tennis players, it seemed obvious that we should incorporate racket sports in our e-commerce business — and I'm so glad we did, because if we were selling kitchen utensils or candles or something we didn't know anything about or care much for, I doubt we'd still be plugging away after a year of learning lessons and lackluster sales. But we are. We believe in our product, and we're having fun trying to move inventory. Rather than feeling burned out, we feel energized.\n\nFigure out what you want, identify someone who already has it, and ask them — politely — for a bit of their time. Then, ask questions. Get curious. This is good, general life and business advice that frequently comes up in interviews with people across all industries. I never tire of it.\n\nWhy try to do everything on your own when you can potentially learn from someone else's mistakes and fast-track your path to success?\n\nIn addition to seeking out mentors, put yourself in the same room — virtual or physical — as people with similar goals. I've heard it over and over again: Who you hang around matters.\n\n\"Networking event\" or \"conference\" doesn't sound particularly fun or exciting, especially to an introvert. Despite reporting on the benefits of attending such events, I had never bought in — until earlier this year, when I spent 10 hours at a conference for real estate investors pursuing financial independence.\n\nI wrote about what it was like being in a room with hundreds of like-minded investors, describing it as \"powerful,\" and mentioning three main takeaways:\n\nOne, you learn — from people who are more successful than you.\n\nTwo, you connect — with people who could become your business partner, mentor, or client.\n\nThree, you gain momentum — perhaps just enough to inspire a key pivot, or take your first step into business, or simply keep the fire burning.\n\nI love an underdog story. Who doesn't? I appreciate grit, and I also believe the underrated, chip-on-your-shoulder mindset can be an asset. Just look at Stephen Curry, who was largely overlooked at the college level before blossoming into an NBA MVP.\n\nOr, to keep things more relevant, consider Kyle Ray. He's a college dropout I spoke with earlier this year who turned his window cleaning side hustle into a six-figure business that services hundreds of clients across Texas.\n\nHe told me that he didn't do great in school and, from a young age, his teachers tried to convince him that \"the best you can hope for is to be a manager of a restaurant.\" Rather than capitulating, he used their declaration as fuel. \"That's just been an internal driver, like, 'I'm going to prove this person wrong.'\"\n\nPeople will tell you that your idea is bad or that it won't work. \"The pickleball space is too competitive,\" one naysayer told me. \"I wouldn't want to be in your shoes!\" said another.\n\nRather than letting unproductive feedback discourage you, use it as motivation. It's fun being an underdog with something to prove. It's also really difficult. Underdog status or not, building a profitable, lasting business takes time, effort, and perhaps even a stroke of luck or two. It's often a series of many small steps over the course of many months and years that lead to success worthy of a feature in a news publication.\n\nI'm hyper-aware that for every successful entrepreneur I interview, there are 100 who have failed. But I'm also aware that you won't have a chance if you don't at least try.",

    "fullText": "Along with the sudden shutdowns of commercial airlines including Play and Blue Islands, a number of charter and fractional carriers also filed for bankruptcy in 2025.\n\nFlorida-based Verijet and Montana charter carrier Corporate Air both initiated bankruptcy proceedings at the same time in October, while Alaska-based Kenai Aviation followed just a few weeks later with a total shutdown of operations in November.\n\nThe charter airline connected hubs like Anchorage and Fairbanks with smaller communities in Kenai, Homer, and Seward.\n\n\"We need capital, we need partners, we need a lifeline,\" owner Joel Caldwell wrote in November. \"That investor is out there, we just need to find them.\"\n\nThe latest airline to submit a Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing is Greensboro-based Jet It. Although the carrier once running charter and fractional flights has not operated since shutting down all operations in 2023, the Dec. 24 filing in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware is a final step in a story that ultimately ends in liquidation.\n\nContrary to a Chapter 11 filing with intent to restructure, a Chapter 7 bankruptcy asks a judge to skip that step and go straight to liquidation. The filing shows that the airline, which launched in 2022 by selling fractional ownership to HondaJet flights, ran up more than $36.2 million in liabilities, including $9.7 million in unsecured claims.\n\nA fractional airline operates by selling shares to a private jet. These are doled out by giving customers a set number of hours they can use to request flights run by the airline's crew.\n\nAt the time it launched, Jet It advertised rates of $1,600 an hour while operating more than 18,000 flight hours a year. Despite the airline once being the 12th-largest private jet operator in the U.S., Jet It also ran up significant debts, given the high cost of jet fuel and a customer base that petered out over time.\n\nThe largest creditor remains World Fuel Services, to which Jet It owes $735,695, according to the filing. American Express is owed over $600,000, while smaller creditors include PIC Card Services LLC and Jetex Flight Services.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway unit FlightSafety claims it was never paid $400,981 for pilot training services enlisted by the airline.\n\nMajor airline launches surprising flight between Las Vegas and Paris\n\nUnited Airlines CEO gives stark warning on Olympic Games\n\nThe highest rooftop in Barcelona is in a surprising place\n\nUS government issues sudden warning on Switzerland travel",

    "fullText": "A major Groq investor said data center development was \"speculative\" and would put \"stress on the system.\"\n\nAlex Davis, the CEO of Austin-based investment company Disruptive Tech, sounded an alarm about the US data center market in an end-of-year letter to investors on Monday.\n\nHe said he was concerned about landlords who were building data centers based on speculation about future demand.\n\n\"I am also deeply concerned about the 'speculative' data center market,\" Davis wrote in his letter. \"The 'build it and they will come' strategy is a trap. If you are a hyperscaler, you will own your own data centers.\"\n\nHe said he predicted a \"significant financing crisis in 2027-2028 for speculative landlords.\"\n\n\"We want to back the owner/users, not the speculative landlords, and we are quite concerned for their stress on the system,\" Davis added.\n\nIn a similar letter on LinkedIn, Davis also talked about data centers, and said AI has spurred \"too many business models with no realistic margin expansion.\"\n\n\"This will not end well,\" he added on LinkedIn.\n\nDisruptive Tech has backed Groq, an AI hardware startup. In a press release in September in which it announced a $750 million capital raise, Groq said Disruptive Tech had invested nearly $350 million in the company.\n\nThe release also said that Disruptive Tech had invested in Airbnb, Spotify, and Slack, as well as AI-forward companies like Shield AI, Palantir, and Databricks.\n\nThis funding round took place shortly before Groq signed a $20 billion licensing deal with Nvidia in November.\n\nDavis's comments about data centers come as tech companies are spending billions of dollars on their construction.\n\nA Business Insider investigation into the US's data centers in June showed that at the end of 2024, companies had filed permits for 1,240 existing or planned data centers. This was nearly four times the number of permits in 2010.\n\nThese centers, which store, process, and distribute large amounts of data, use massive amounts of land, water, and electricity. Cities give companies tax incentives to build data centers, spurring the rate of their construction.",

    "description": "Bill Ackman, Palmer Luckey, Garry Tan, and more are sharing their opinions on a California billionaire tax proposal.",
    "fullText": "Some of the biggest names in business are speaking up about California's billionaire tax proposal.\n\nThe measure proposed a one-time 5% tax for California residents whose assets exceed $1 billion. If the proposal receives enough signatures, it would appear on the state ballot in November.\n\nIf the proposal passes, the tax would apply retroactively to all California residents as of January 1, 2026.\n\nProposed by the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West labor union, the bill attempts to fill a projected multibillion-dollar state budget deficit.\n\nCalifornia is home to some of the biggest companies — in both value and prestige — in the US. The state boasts Hollywood and Silicon Valley, although some of the industries' key players have relocated.\n\nIn a letter to Gov. Gavin Newsom obtained by Business Insider, attorney Alex Spiro wrote that his clients would \"permanently relocate\" if the tax becomes law. Spiro has previously represented billionaires and celebrities.\n\nHere's how several business leaders and politicians have reacted to the tax proposal:\n\nThe billionaire CEO of Pershing Square Holdings wrote Monday on X that he was \"opposed to wealth taxes because they effectively represent an expropriation of private property,\" which can have \"unintended and negative consequences.\"\n\nHowever, he said he's in favor of a \"fairer tax system.\"\n\nFor example, Ackman wrote that an individual who had amassed a billion dollars or \n\n\"One shouldn't be able to live and spend like a billionaire and pay no tax,\" Ackman wrote.\n\nAs for California's \"budget problems,\" Ackman wrote that the issue wasn't a lack of tax revenue — it was about \"how the money is being spent.\"\n\nThe White House AI and crypto czar took aim at California's government in an X post on Sunday.\n\nRed states like Texas and Florida don't employ state income taxes, let alone wealth taxes, Sacks wrote. \"Democrats steal everything, then blame job creators for their 'greed,'\" he wrote.\n\nSacks said in an October episode of the \"All-In\" podcast, which he cohosts, that a wealth tax \"always backfires,\" because tax benefits are outweighed by wealthy residents leaving.\n\nSacks threatened to leave the state, analogizing steady tax increases to boiling a frog on the podcast.\n\n\"I'm going to have to jump out of the pot with this,\" he said.\n\nThe Congressman for California's 17th district, which covers much of Silicon Valley, said that the proposal was \"good for American innovation.\"\n\nAfter receiving thousands of comments on a Friday post bidding a sarcastic goodbye to those threatening to leave the state, Khanna explained his support in a seven-paragraph X post on Saturday.\n\nHe wrote that Nvidia would be built all over again, even with the wealth tax.\n\n\"Jensen [Huang] wasn't thinking I won't start this company because I may have to one day pay a 1% tax on my billions,\" Khanna wrote. \"He built here because the talent is here.\"\n\nKhanna argued that innovation would be further stifled by the \"political dysfunction and social unrest\" that comes with wide wealth gaps.\n\nIn a statement to Business Insider, Sarah Drory, a spokesperson for Rep. Khanna, wrote that the representative has \"always supported a modest wealth tax on billionaires to deal with staggering inequality and to make sure people have healthcare.\"\n\n\"He has advocated for common sense workarounds for startup founders whose companies are not profitable and who have illiquid stock,\" Drory wrote.\n\nThe Oculus founder and Anduril cofounder wrote in a Sunday X post that the tax would force founders to \"sell huge chunks of our companies.\"\n\nLuckey wrote that he made money from Oculus — which he sold to Facebook in 2014 — and paid millions in taxes on it. Then he used the \"remainder\" to start Anduril, he wrote.\n\n\"Now me and my cofounders have to somehow come up with billions of dollars in cash,\" Luckey wrote.\n\nLuckey also wrote that the policy made no provision for companies that funnel revenue back to research and development, rather than paying cash incomes sizable enough to cover the tax.\n\n\"You are effectively forcing companies to immediately pivot into profit obsession over mission or long-term sustainability,\" he wrote.\n\nThe CEO of startup accelerator Y Combinator wrote in a Saturday X post that the tax would \"kill little tech in California.\"\n\nUnicorn startup founders become a \"paper billionaire\" — as in, having cash on hand — around the $5 billion valuation point, Tan wrote.\n\nThe proposed tax is on unrealized gains, meaning founders would be put on the line even before their wealth is liquid, Tan wrote.\n\nIf the tax passed, Tan wrote that Y Combinator would consider opening Austin or Cambridge programs.\n\nThe Vermont senator has long been a proponent of taxes on the wealthy, introducing a bill in 2019 that aimed to halve the wealth of billionaires over a 15-year period.\n\nWhile Sanders didn't explicitly comment on the California proposal, he posted Monday on X broadly supporting wealth taxes.\n\n\"We can respect innovation & entrepreneurship, but we cannot respect the extraordinary greed that now exists,\" Sanders wrote. \"We need a wealth tax.\"\n\nThe Tesla CEO reposted another user's X post that commented on the tax, saying that his stocks weren't wealth.\n\nMusk wrote in his Tuesday post that his \"wealth\" was mostly tied up in Tesla and SpaceX shares.\n\n\"This means my 'wealth' can only increase due to producing more products and services for the public,\" he wrote.\n\nWhile not directly commenting on the California tax, Musk wrote that he was a \"maker,\" unlike \"taker\" politicians like Sanders.\n\nMusk said in 2020 that he had moved from California to Texas.\n\nThe governor of California has spoken against the wealth tax. At The New York Times' Dealbook conference in December, Newsom said that California had to stay competitive with other states.\n\n\"People of that status, they already have two or three homes outside the state,\" he said. \"You've got to be pragmatic about it.\"\n\nIf the tax passes as a ballot measure, Newsom would not have the ability to veto it.",

    "description": "Rodin Roohipour is a 15-year-old interested in tech and venture capital. To learn about the industry, he cold emails business leaders for advice.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Rodin Roohipour, a 15-year-old from Los Angeles. It's been edited for length and clarity. Business Insider verified the email correspondences mentioned.\n\nI've wanted to start a company since I was 12.\n\nWhen I was younger, at 8, I loved building things. I started coding very early. Then I turned 12, I did this entrepreneurship program, and I got really into it. I kept trying to build these companies, these little side projects, but nothing took off.\n\nEventually, I realized a really important thing you need to have is knowledge. I knew nothing about tech or venture capital. I decided to learn everything the best way I could, which is by talking to the most knowledgeable people.\n\nThat led me to all these cold emails.\n\nThe biggest names were Alfred Lin from Sequoia Capital, Mark Cuban, Paul Graham. They've given so much good advice.\n\nWhen I emailed Alfred Lin, I had to follow up three times. I asked him what his issues were in venture capital.\n\nI emailed Julia Lipton from Awesome People Ventures, and she responded three weeks after my follow-up and seemed happy to chat. She was the first big person I ever called with.\n\nWhen I emailed Mark Cuban, I really had to personalize it. This guy gets like 500 emails a day. You have to stand out. I said: \"I'm currently a high school student who uses Al a LOT and went to your bootcamp a while back.\" That captured his attention.\n\nA lot of people are like, \"Can you get on a meeting?\" You need to go in with no expectations. You should just share your story and say, \"One sentence of advice would help.\"\n\nA lot of people hide the interesting parts about themselves because they think that it'll scare people off. In my first few emails, I talked like a salesman. It sounds super professional, but the problem with that is, it sounds like a sales pitch. It'll go to your promotions folder.\n\nYou need to use the extreme or unusual attributes around you.\n\nI view an email as two parts: the subject and the body. The subject is what you're using to get someone to open it. You don't need to explain anything. You don't need to introduce yourself.\n\nThe subject line I've been using a lot is: \"writing this email to you while in my high school math class.\" It's a bit generic, so if you're emailing someone like Mark Cuban, you would change it. But it works really well. (I don't actually write the emails in my math class. I just schedule them for the morning.)\n\nIt's a pattern break. If all your emails are like \"I'm going to fix this\" or \"I'm going to do that,\" nobody cares. That subject line captures your eye. A 14-to-18-year-old? What's he doing in my inbox? Math class reinforces that.\n\nThe body of the email is where everything else happens. You present your real argument, why the person you're emailing is relevant, and why helping you makes sense for them.\n\nA clever subject line can't save a bad email. You'll have 500 opens but two replies.\n\nPaul Graham was one of the biggest emails I got. I told him, \"I'm Rodin, 14 y/o and super interested in VC and startups. I'm building a product that is a trust platform for VCs / founders. I would love to chat with you about your story and some problems you face. Even 10 mins would mean a lot.\"\n\nHe gave me a blunt reply, but it was nice. He told me: \"This is a mistake. You are much better off focusing on learning math and programming. Build your own LLM.\"\n\nEven if these people don't give you big replies, it's important that you're in their network. It builds a slight connection.",

    "description": "Warren Buffett became a meme, built a cash mountain, and rocked the business world by announcing his retirement in 2025.",
    "fullText": "Warren Buffett sent shockwaves through the business world in 2025 when he revealed it would be his final year as Berkshire Hathaway CEO — ending a six-decade run in which he transformed the failing textile mill into a vast conglomerate worth over $1 trillion.\n\nThe legendary investor also penned two of his iconic shareholder letters, briefly became a meme, built Berkshire's cash pile to more than $350 billion, took a stake in Alphabet, and rolled out the biggest changes to his company's leadership in decades.\n\nBuffett penned his yearly shareholder letter in February, foreshadowing his departure by talking up two of his planned successors, Greg Abel and Todd Combs.\n\nHe hailed Abel, Berkshire's non-insurance boss and his pick for Berkshire's next CEO, for his honesty and decisiveness. He praised Geico CEO Todd Combs — also one of Buffett's two investment managers, hired to eventually take over Berkshire's portfolio — for swinging the auto insurer from a pre-tax underwriting loss of $1.9 billion in 2022 to a $7.8 billion profit in 2024.\n\n\"Geico was a long-held gem that needed major repolishing,\" Buffett wrote, hailing the improvement under Combs as \"spectacular.\"\n\nBuffett touted Berkshire's tax payments during his tenure, noting the company had gone from paying zero income tax to almost $27 billion in 2024, the most of any US company in history.\n\nHe urged the federal government to \"spend it wisely,\" saying it should go toward helping people who \"get the short straws in life.\"\n\nBuffett went viral during the market correction in March, as followers lauded his prescience in reducing core positions such as Apple and Bank of America and amassing a record cash pile before stocks slumped.\n\nSocial media was filled with people parroting Buffett's advice to \"be greedy when others are fearful,\" and sharing memes about him celebrating or being nonchalant about the sell-off.\n\nTens of thousands of people descended on Buffett's hometown of Omaha in May for Berkshire's shareholder weekend, not knowing they were about to witness history.\n\nAs usual, Buffett held court for hours in an arena filled with his followers. He hailed Geico's turnaround, defended Berkshire's cash hoard, advocated for free trade, warned AI investments could temper returns, and voiced his confidence in Berkshire and America.\n\nIn the closing minutes of the Q&A, Buffett revealed he would step down.\n\n\"I think the time has arrived where Greg should become the chief executive officer of the company at year-end,\" he said.\n\nBuffett said he would continue to \"hang around\" at Berkshire and might be useful on occasion, but the \"final word would be what Greg said — in operations, in capital deployment, whatever it might be.\"\n\nAfter a lengthy standing ovation, Buffett quipped that his shareholders were either applauding his contributions to Berkshire or celebrating his departure.\n\n\"The enthusiasm shown by the audience's response can be interpreted in two ways,\" he said. \"But I'll take it as positive. Thank you.\"\n\nBuffett turned his Thanksgiving message into a love letter to Omaha, in which he reflected on how lucky he's been in life, and thanked the many people who helped him succeed.\n\nThe billionaire gifted Berkshire shares worth about $1.4 billion in total to four of his family's foundations, and said he would accelerate his giving as he wanted his children, now in their 60s and 70s, to distribute virtually his entire fortune.\n\nBuffett hailed Abel as a worthy successor, saying he couldn't think of anyone better to \"handle your savings and mine.\" He also encouraged readers to learn from their mistakes, choose good role models, live up to their desired obituaries, and care for others.\n\n\"When you help someone in any of thousands of ways, you help the world,\" he wrote. \"Kindness is costless but also priceless.\"\n\nBuffett and his team struggled to find bargains once again in 2025 as stocks marched to record highs.\n\nBerkshire sold a net $11 billion of stocks in the first nine months of the year, marking 12 straight quarters as a net seller. It has skipped buybacks for five quarters in a row as well.\n\nThe stock sales and lack of spending helped increase its cash pile, after substracting payables for Treasury purchases, to a record $358 billion as of September 30.\n\nBuffett and his team made several tweaks to Berkshire's stock portfolio. They continued paring Apple and Bank of America, exited Citigroup, and boosted their Occidental Petroleum stake.\n\nThey also unexpectedly built a position in Google-parent Alphabet worth $4.3 billion as of September 30, after placing billion-dollar bets on Constellation Brands and UnitedHealth.\n\nAhead of Buffett's departure as CEO, Berkshire announced sweeping changes to its management team.\n\nThe conglomerate revealed that Combs had resigned to lead a new investment unit at JPMorgan and advise CEO Jamie Dimon.\n\nBerkshire also appointed its first general counsel, announced finance chief Marc Hamburg would retire in June 2027 after 40 years at the company, and disclosed that Abel would be delegating responsibility for more than 30 businesses to NetJets CEO Adam Johnson, in a new role as a divisional president.\n\nBusiness Insider obtained a copy of Combs' farewell letter to Geico employees, which can be read here.",

    "description": "Business Insider researched over 20 new dating apps that want to help you find love.",
    "fullText": "Dating app fatigue has gone mainstream, with many people growing tired of swiping, ghosting, being ghosted, and generally treading water while searching for the right fish in the sea.\n\nLuckily, there's a barrage of new apps on the market aiming to help you find the love of your life, a friend with benefits, or both.\n\nSome apps, like Sitch and Ditto, use AI to narrow the dating pool, limiting matches or skipping the app interface entirely in favor of text messages. Other apps match users through mutual connections. For singles who are sick of algorithms altogether, there are startups betting on the in-person meet-cute, hosting dinners, or ticketed events.\n\nThe dating startups aim to disrupt the industry's incumbent power players — Tinder, Hinge, Bumble, and Grindr — which defined a generation of online dating, but have since seen their stock values tumble.\n\nThat means opportunity, and investors are pouring money into the space. Dating startups raised $121 million last year, according to PitchBook data.\n\nStill, it's a tough industry to break into. A dating app needs wide adoption — aka enough potential matches — to be a hit.\n\nSo where can you turn to right now to find love, sex, or new relationships of any kind? We've researched 24 apps that have launched in the US since 2020 and could be new alternatives for your doom-swiping.\n\nFinding the one is all about finding the right one — something which can take a lot of work in the old-school apps. With AI matchmaker chatbots and AI-powered algorithms promising better matches, these apps hope to make that a whole lot easier.\n\nThese apps seek to address one common complaint among app daters — the lack of actual dates. Endless flirtations often fizzle before anyone actually meets for drinks or coffee. With location-based features and rewards for getting off the app and into a bar, a handful of new entrants hope to change that.\n\nNot everyone is interested in dating strangers. A handful of apps are trying to build tools that help people narrow their dating pool to people they have mutual friends (or hobbies) with.\n\nThere's a grab bag of apps looking to refine their user bases by specific affinities or matching principles — and prove they're better dating environments than the main apps. Daters are now matching based on astrology, their Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, or different relationship styles.",

It redefines the true meaning of ARR and analyzes how the revenue structure of many AI companies resembles a brokerage or reseller model rather than SaaS. Using the analogy of investors who only inflate transaction volume, it presents—from a consulting perspective—why repeatability, margins, and control are far more critical than the magnitude of the numbers.",
    "fullText": "In recent feeds and headlines covering AI startups, a certain phrase repeats with exhausting frequency:\n\"Reached $X million ARR in just n months.\"\n\nAt first, it is impressive.\nThe second time, it invites skepticism.\n\nThis is not merely a matter of accounting tricks or semantic hair-splitting.\nIt is a fundamental question about the structure of AI businesses, their sustainability, and how we ought to interpret the numbers presented to us.\n\nARR stands for Annual Recurring Revenue.\nThe two operative words here carry weight.\n\nThese are run-rates.\nARR is not a prediction; it is a result verified by time.\n\nFundamentally,\nFor a company less than a year old to claim ARR is, conceptually, a contradiction.\n\nThe year has not passed.\nThe recurrence has not been proven.\n\nARR is the lingua franca of SaaS.\nAnd the language of SaaS invariably connotes:\n\nThus, many AI companies,\neven those far from reaching that stage,\nborrow the term ARR to describe their finances.\n\nThe problem begins exactly there.\n\nPeer slightly beneath the surface of many AI startup revenue structures, and a pattern emerges.\n\nIn this structure, the portion the company actually retains is but a fraction of the total payment.\n\nHere, the correct concept is GMV (Gross Merchandise Value).\n\nGMV represents the total value of merchandise sold through a platform.\nThe critical distinction is this:\n\nIf a platform mediates a transaction and takes a commission,\nGMV ≠ Revenue.\n\nThe illusion specific to the AI industry arises here.\n\nOn the surface, it mimics SaaS perfectly.\n\nIn this structure, calling GMV \"ARR\" is,\nAn act of consuming an unproven future as a present achievement.\n\nTo put it more bluntly,\nit borders on a bluff designed to induce a financing illusion.\n\n\"Model costs are dropping, so even if margins are thin now, they will improve.\"\n\nThis statement is only half true.\n\nTechnology costs do decrease.\nHowever, demand always migrates to the newest, most powerful models.\n\nOf course, low-cost models have their place—simple tasks, non-competitive domains.\n\nBut the question remains:\nIs the product you are building truly that kind of product?\n\nWe are cognitively greedy.\nGiven the same time and money, we desire the smarter brain.\n\nUltimately, the discussion boils down to one thing.\n\nNeither is inherently right or wrong.\nBut how they are valued must be completely different.\n\nA large GMV does not equate to a solid foundation.\n\nThe spectacle of GMV-first growth often reminds me of a familiar scene.\n\nThe investor with $10,000 of capital,\nwho trades dozens of times a day,\nboasting, \"I moved millions in transaction volume this month.\"\n\nThe trades are many.\nThe numbers are large.\nBut what actually remains?\n\nMostly transaction fees paid to the exchange.\nThe volume swells, but the asset base barely moves.\n\nAI startups obsessed with GMV are not so different.\n\nBut the vast majority of that flow\npasses through to model providers and infrastructure giants,\nleaking straight out of the building.\n\nTo discuss GMV as if it were ARR in this context is\nnot a demonstration of capital control,\nbut rather an attempt to prove competence via the sheer volume of money that passed through one's hands.\n\nFrom a consulting perspective, the questions are simple.\n\nARR is not a marketing slogan.\nIt is a report card proving that a financial structure has withstood the test of time.\n\nGMV can be a signal of growth.\nBut it is, at best, a process metric.\nIt cannot substitute for the foundation.\n\nIn the AI era, numbers have become larger and faster.\nThat is precisely why we must be more honest with our terminology.\n\nThe moment you slap the label of ARR onto GMV,\nthe business begins to look solid,\nbut in reality, it is being built on sand.\n\nTime will eventually reveal the truth.\nWhether you were a company that made many trades,\nor a company that accumulated value.\n\nTime always distinguishes the two.",

    "fullText": "Arby’s has been around for more than 60 years now slinging hot roast beef sandwiches to the masses, but it looks like there will be a few less spots to get that fix in the coming year.\n\nBecause, according to multiple reports, the fast-food chain has “quietly closed” more than a dozen restaurants across the country over the past several months.\n\nMaybe it was the steak nuggets because, no matter the number of positive reviews you might read folks, those things are gross.\n\nBut seriously, Arby’s shuttering locations is a big deal, and if you don’t believe it just take a look at the share of the market that the chain owns. Per QSR magazine, Arby’s was third in 2024 in the United States market for sandwich sales, placing behind Subway and Panera.\n\nAnd its parent company, Inspire Brands, reported that Arby’s did $29.5 billion in sales in 2024.\n\nSo, why is the chain now shutting down shop on so many locations?\n\nWell, per The Independent, despite the impressive numbers, Arby’s saw a 6.3% drop in sales overall last year. The outlet said Arby’s has also been battling rising costs and lower consumer spending, which led to the dip in overall sales.\n\nGood news for fans of the roast beef giant in Pennsylvania is that, so far, none of the shuttered locations have come in the Keystone State. But, per The Street, at least 14 locations have closed including one in Laurel, Maryland and another in Audubon, New Jersey.\n\nTennessee has been hardest hit with four locations closing, including three which shutdown in October.",

    "fullText": "A gathering of roughly 500 teens at Atlantic Station escalated from fireworks to actual gunfire.\n\nA nearby Thai restaurant was struck by a bullet, forcing diners to the floor as approximately 30 shots were fired.\n\nFive juveniles were detained, but police have not yet announced any formal charges.\n\nATLANTA - Atlanta police say nearly 500 teenagers caused a massive disturbance at Atlantic Station Saturday night, launching fireworks into crowds and eventually drawing real gunfire outside the district.\n\nAtlanta police originally responded to the shopping center after 7 p.m. following reports of shots fired. While investigators quickly determined the sounds were actually fireworks being ignited by a large crowd of \"unruly\" juveniles, the situation turned more dangerous as the crowd was dispersed.\n\n\"It can escalate from firecrackers to now its guns to life being taken. That’s something we don’t want,\" said John Williams, who was visiting the area.\n\nAs officers cleared the mall, a group of teenagers allegedly began firing actual guns near Spring Street NW and 17th Street.\n\nThe gunfire sent patrons at Nan Thai Fine Dining ducking for cover.\n\n\"Definitely about 30 shots,\" said Jedi Niyomkul, the restaurant's general manager. \"I’m making sure everyone is on the ground because we do have a lot of glass.\"\n\nNiyomkul said the restaurant was hit by at least one bullet. He expressed frustration that the crowd was pushed out of the mall but not adequately monitored once they crossed into the surrounding city streets.\n\n\"Once they got them across the bridge, there was no patrol over on this side to make sure that they dispersed,\" Niyomkul said. \"Literally at 17th and Spring, right there, 100 to 150 kids just sitting all around the corner, doing absolutely nothing, just looking for trouble.\"\n\nThe disturbance occurred despite Atlantic Station's strict codes of conduct. The district enforces a 3 p.m. curfew for anyone under 18, requiring them to be with a parent or guardian. Additionally, no one under 21 is allowed on the property after 9 p.m.\n\nAtlanta City Council member Michael Julian Bond said the city must find a more consistent way to manage large groups of youth.\n\n\"We again manage this population policy-wise, more than any other segment than our society, so we all got to step up year-round in how we manage that population,\" Bond said.\n\nInformation in this article came from Atlanta police and FOX 5's Annie Mapp speaking with Jedi Niyomkul and Michael Julian Bond.",

    "fullText": "Uber is hiring people as it tries to become a \"super app.\" So how much is it paying them?\n\nYou're probably familiar with the millions of gig workers who drive you to the airport or deliver your food. Now, Uber is looking to expand those services — with self-driving cars, for example — as well as offer customers targeted offers.\n\n\"We're slowly moving towards a super app of sorts,\" CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said.\n\nSome of the people whom Uber has hired as it tries to make that vision a reality have come from outside the US via H-1B visas.\n\nCompanies are required to submit this work visa data, which includes salary information, to the US Department of Labor for all foreign hires. However, the compensation figures don't include equity or other benefits that employees can receive in addition to their base pay. The filings also include industry average pay rates for US workers.\n\nThe process for obtaining an H-1B visa, however, is changing.\n\nIn September, President Donald Trump instituted a $100,000 fee for the visa. And proposed changes to H-1B visa rules would tilt the already competitive visa lottery in favor of the highest-paid applicants, lawyers told Business Insider.\n\nUber filed to hire 945 workers through the H-1B visa program during the 2025 federal fiscal year, which ended on September 30, according to filings with the US Department of Labor. That's more than the 778 filings that Uber made during 2024.\n\nHere's a look at the jobs that Uber disclosed salaries for:\n\nStaff Software Engineer: $225,200 to $258,800\n\nManager, Engineering: $231,700 to $287,000\n\nManager, Applications Development: $195,600 to $210,500\n\nSenior Manager: $234,100 to $299,700\n\nStaff Software Engineer, TLM: $242,000 to $249,300\n\nSenior Director, Engineering: $360,000 to $410,000\n\nScientist, Tech: $111,966 to $176,400\n\nSenior Scientist, Tech: $151,700 to $207,200\n\nSenior Applied Scientist: $186,307 to $208,062\n\nStaff Scientist, Tech: $219,100 to $250,000\n\nApplied Scientist: $133,100 to $179,100\n\nData Scientist: $125,950 to $153,700\n\nData Scientist, Tech: $129,750 to $160,700\n\nData Scientist III: $150,000 to $175,019\n\nData Analyst: $156,600 to $161,000\n\nData Analyst, Tech: $116,750 to $162,200\n\nSenior Data Scientist: $150,400 to $164,300\n\nProduct Manager: $158,700 to $197,000\n\nSenior Technical Program Manager: $202,500 to $231,400\n\nSenior Program Manager: $144,500 to $170,100\n\nBusiness Analyst - Operations II: $110,075 to $117,554\n\nScientist, Tech: $149,650 to $174,900\n\nSenior Scientist, Tech: $169,800 to $185,300\n\nSenior Operations and Logistics Manager: $135,600 to $142,850\n\nRegional Operations Manager: $101,300 to $140,950\n\nManager, Sales Operations: $157,400 to $166,900\n\nManager, Central Operations: $157,100 to $161,900\n\nSenior Program Manager: $143,000 to $178,800\n\nStrategic Operations Manager: $111,900 to $166,600\n\nMachine Learning Engineer: $178,900 to $198,500\n\nSenior Machine Learning Engineer: $219,900 to $235,500\n\nSoftware Engineer: $98,516 to $198,500\n\nSoftware Engineer II: $113,308 to $135,005\n\nSoftware Engineer III: $131,003 to $188,084\n\nStaff Software Engineer: $207,800 to $273,000\n\nStaff Software Engineer, TLM: $246,400 to $263,000\n\nSenior Staff Engineer: $260,400 to $312,700\n\nSenior Software Engineer: $151,819 to $242,000\n\nStaff Applications Developer: $225,100 to $251,100\n\nSenior Applications Developer: $179,500 to $209,700\n\nManager, Technical Accounting: $164,600 to $166,900\n\nManager, Strategy and Planning: $155,000 to $173,600\n\nSenior Manager, Strategic Finance: $192,300 to $206,000\n\nManager, Central Operations: $140,900 to $160,200\n\nProduct Designer: $157,100 to $174,600\n\nBusiness Insider has been collecting pay data for tech companies.

    "fullText": "Cybersecurity experts reveal what they do for high-profile clients targeted by hackers such as Scattered Spider\n\nThey call it “stopping the bleeding”: the vital window to prevent an entire database from being ransacked by criminals or a production line grinding to a halt.\n\nWhen a call comes into the cybersecurity firm S-RM, headquartered on Whitechapel High Street in east London, a hacked business or institution may have just minutes to protect themselves.\n\nS-RM, which helped a high-profile retail client recover from a Scattered Spider cyber-attack has become a quiet, often word-of-mouth, success.\n\nMany of the company’s senior workers are multilingual and have a minimal online footprint, which reveals scant but impressive CVs suggestive of corporate or government intelligence-based careers.\n\nS-RM now claims the UK’s largest cyber-incident response team. Its first-responder service is comprised of about 150 experts worldwide. It has clients who keep it on retainer, victims referred by insurers, and “walk-ins”: people who suddenly realise their business is under attack and call the first few results on their search engines.\n\nIn the case of the Scattered Spider victim, which the Guardian understands was not Marks & Spencer or the Co-op – two retailers that were attacked in 2025 – a 30-minute Teams call with a retailer became “a 24-hour call with a rotating cast of experts”, says Ted Cowell, the director of S-RM’s cyber business arm.\n\n“On average we’re getting back to clients within six minutes. Which is critical because often the first hours of a cyber incident can be the biggest chance window to determine the outcome of a case and its impact,” he says. “What can start as a network intrusion can then metastasise into a full-blown malware or ransomware scenario.”\n\nCowell, a Cambridge-educated Russian speaker, says that getting a handle on the attack during a “reconnaissance” period can result in a radically different outcome, compared with a slow response. Criminals often need time after their first penetration of a businesses’ systems to work out what is of most value. This short spell of time can therefore allow experts to prevent the most operationally painful of attacks. “Exfiltration” – the theft of critical data – and encryption, whereby businesses can be locked out of their own systems, can be the most damaging.\n\n“Sometimes we can stop it from going boom,” Cowell says. Teams focus on “stopping the bleeding” by limiting or cutting the attacker’s access to systems. This is what S-RM’s team was able to do with the Scattered Spider victim: stopping the detonation of malware across systems.\n\nBusiness is good as the cybercrime industry grows, but that comes with ethical challenges. S-RM and its industry peers have faced criticism for helping to facilitate the payment of ransoms to criminals who hijack businesses for money.\n\n“Extortion support” is an important part of S-RM’s work. This means its specialists are in the room when ransoms are negotiated, sometimes doing the negotiation itself on behalf of a client. Cowell appears keen to avoid criticisms of feeding organised crime by helping businesses to pay ransoms, or by acting for insurers that sell policies covering ransom payments.\n\n“We’re instructed by the policyholder, by the insured,” he says.\n\n“Our ambition is to guide ‘no payment’ decisions wherever and whenever possible,” he continues, adding that businesses are increasingly taking that approach and not paying ransoms.\n\n“Our role is to facilitate strategic thinking,” he says. “Give clients some structure to order their thoughts. They’ve probably not been in a situation like this before.\n\n“The businesses’ decision as to what they do is their own. We just offer the template of a crisis, how things play out based on our experience.\n\n“Why should we pay these criminals?” is a challenge Cowell says his team puts to top staff at affected businesses. “One of the things that we often educate boards on is that ransomware is an organised criminal enterprise.”\n\nThese nefarious groups have, he explains, “brands to uphold”. Established ransomware groups, typically speaking, will honour a settlement. S-RM also has an increasingly detailed picture of how these groups have behaved in previous negotiations.\n\nThe more established the group, the more likely they are to honour whatever settlement is agreed either by deleting stolen data or providing keys to decrypt critical files. S-RM offers a rundown of who’s who in terms of reliability, negotiating patterns, behaviours, even extending to sanctions concerns.\n\nThe latter rarely applies, however. Trying to impose sanctions on state-linked groups is a game of “whack-a-mole”, Cowell says. If so-called “threat actors” do appear on sanctions lists they tend to disband and reform in a new guise. The risk of putting money, albeit indirectly, into state-enemy hands is therefore another consideration for firms facing a cyber-attack.\n\nStill, businesses do sometimes decide to pay up. It can be rational for their company’s circumstances, and ultimately “it’s always their decision”, Cowell says.\n\nAs the corporate moral code of paying ransoms matures, and decisions not to fund organised crime become more common, restoration and recovery services have become a bigger part of the cybersecurity response market. Increasingly it is a priority to just get systems back up and running as soon as possible with the forensic analysis of how someone got into a system becoming secondary.\n\nIn recent years, the UK government’s cyber-intelligence role has also shifted significantly. The National Cyber Security Centre “over the last four or five years has hugely transformed”, Cowell says. The NCSC has caught up with its Nordic equivalents and now proactively reaches out to victims, telling them they may be targeted based on intelligence.\n\n“It was more of an information taker,” asking the likes of S-RM for information, which they would willingly provide with client consent, Cowell says.\n\n“[Now] they are playing a more robust role, getting on the front foot and getting people together to facilitate information sharing. We saw the impact of that with the Scattered Spider attacks.,” he adds.",

He began his career as a researcher at IBM before joining Meta, where he advanced from researcher to manager in just three years, according to his LinkedIn profile. He then held director positions at Square and Snacphat, and was vice president of engineering at HubSpot, before he joined HeyGen, a visual storytelling platform, in 2024.\n\nOver the years, he said he has noticed that those he has mentored can make themselves miserable when they strive for a promotion.\n\n\"Don't do that,\" he said. \"When you start to get into that mindset, you start to count your happiness or your career growth toward something that you don't have full control over.\"\n\nIt's better to control the things you can control. \"Learn how to adjust, and you'll be a better self afterward,\" he said.\n\nFor those still determined to seek a promotion, however, timing matters.\n\nExecutive coach Andrea Wasserman previously told Business Insider that it's best to put yourself in your manager's shoes and think about what's happening across the team or company. Ask yourself, \"Will this timing make it easier or harder for me to get a 'yes?'\"",

    "fullText": "A Trump administration official credited the president with making small business owners “excited” to pay their taxes thanks to tax cuts and less regulation.\n\nKelly Loeffler, administrator of the Small Business Administration, told Fox News’s Sunday Morning Futures that “small business optimism is above its 52-year average.”\n\nLoeffler said a lot of the optimism is due to the Working Families Tax Cut in Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill.”\n\n“Small businesses finally have certainty about what their tax rate’s going to be,” Loeffler said. “That 20% pass-through deduction, now the 179 expensing that means higher limits on the ability to expense immediately for purchases they make in capital equipment, and also R&D expensing.”\n\nThose factors, according to Loeffler, actually have small business owners jazzed about writing a check to Uncle Sam.\n\n“I don’t think small business owners have ever been so excited to pay their taxes thanks to President Trump!” Loeffler said. “He brought us the blue collar boom in his first term, and now he’s going to add to that the small business boom.”\n\nHost Cheryl Casone, in for Maria Bartiromo, asked Loeffler about “those onerous federal regulations under the Biden administration,” and whether removing them “could be another way to boost the health of small business.”\n\n“Absolutely. Regulation is a tax on a small business, and under President Trump in his first year, about $200 billion in regulations have been cut,” Loeffler said.\n\nThe SBA’s goal for 2026 is “to make sure that small businesses are able to have relief after four very active years of regulating under Joe Biden that heaped trillions of dollars on the backs of small businesses,” Loeffler said. “So, we’re leading a strike force at the SBA to roll back even more regulations.”\n\nLoeffler has been criticized for aggressively cutting staff at the SBA, and for rolling back Biden administration changes “aimed at easing access to credit for the smallest enterprises,” The New York Times reported.\n\n“The changes are especially problematic for Black, Hispanic and immigrant entrepreneurs,” the report continued. “In the name of eradicating diversity, equity and inclusion practices, the Small Business Administration is shedding programs aimed at helping disadvantaged businesses, including those run by women.”\n\nWatch above via Sunday Morning Futures on Fox News.\n\nThe post Trump Official Brags On Fox News: ‘I Don’t Think Small Business Owners Have Ever Been So Excited to Pay Their Taxes!’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "Tiffany Chng and Olivia Yiong were work besties. Both were laid off, so during the pandemic, they ditched corporate and launched an athleisure brand.",
    "fullText": "Tiffany Chng and Olivia Yiong said they went from being work besties to regular besties and then work besties again.\n\nThe duo, both 31, met in 2018 and became inseparable while working at GuavaPass, a fitness app. Yiong was laid off when Guavapass was acquired by ClassPass in 2019.\n\nTwo years later, during the pandemic, Chng was laid off from her marketing job. The duo reunited to launch an athleisure brand, then called Butter, despite having no experience in fashion or entrepreneurship.\n\nChng's retrenchment and the pandemic lockdown gave them the push they needed to start the brand.\n\n\"At that point, we had nothing to lose,\" Yiong said.\n\nThey started with online sales, and in October this year, they opened their first retail store in Singapore's upscale ION Orchard mall, in the heart of the city's luxury shopping district.\n\nBuilding a brand during the pandemic in an already saturated market and for a conservative audience was not easy.\n\nExercise and sports have always been a big part of the founders' lives.\n\nYiong was an F45 trainer, has practiced yoga, pilates, and Muay Thai, and is now training for her first Hyrox. Chng was part of a national team representing Singapore at the 2011 Touch Rugby World Cup and has also dabbled in cheerleading, pilates, yoga, and HIIT.\n\nWhen Chng was laid off from ClassPass in 2020, they decided to go all in on an athleisure clothing line, which started off with the name \"Butter.\" They invested 20,000 Singapore dollars in 2020 into the brand.\n\nHalf came from Yiong's savings, and the other half came from Chng's severance pay.\n\nThey started product design in March 2020 and found suppliers in China. They launched in October that year with just two products in two colors: a longline sports bra and a pair of leggings.\n\nCOVID lockdowns that pushed everyone online helped them gain visibility. About 500 people joined an online workout they hosted in March 2021.\n\nIn 2022, they sold the brand to Love, Bonito, a Singaporean women's wear brand. Afterward, they changed the brand's name to Cheak.\n\nLaunching an athleisure brand in Singapore came with a unique set of challenges.\n\nWomen in Singapore and Southeast Asia place a high value on modesty and require padding in the bust, the duo said.\n\n\"A lot of overseas brands don't have padding. In Singapore, you need padding; it's non-negotiable. One of the most commonly asked questions we get is, 'Does it have padding?'\" Chng said.\n\n\"But padding changes the construction completely for the product — it requires so many more stitches, and it makes it difficult to have a very clean bind,\" she added.\n\nAnother issue was the sheerness of the fabric.\n\n\"Overseas brands don't double line their lighter colors because I think the women are a bit more comfortable with a slight sheerness, but in Singapore, that's not acceptable,\" she said.\n\n\"But when you double-line a garment, it becomes very thick. So, we spent about a year changing the fabric and reducing its thickness so that when we double-lined it, it would still be comfortable,\" Chng added.\n\nDesigning clothes for a customer base that likes to play it safe requires a good deal of restraint, the founders said. They said there was plenty they wanted to experiment with, but had to tone down.\n\n\"A lot of brands that are quite popular internationally are quite sexy and crazy nowadays,\" Yiong said. \"So we take that idea, and tweak it to what will work for our audience.\"\n\nSingapore is becoming a competitive space for athleisure brands. Alo Yoga, the athleisure brand worn by Kendall Jenner and Hailey Bieber, opened its first store in the city's Marina Bay Sands mall in September.\n\nIn ION Orchard, the mall where Cheak is located, shoppers can also find Lululemon, Cotton On Body, and Adidas.\n\nTo stand out, Cheak focuses on making clothes for Asian women — and that doesn't just mean making them more petite.\n\n\"The bust shape is different, our waists are smaller, our hips are slightly wider, and the femur is also a little bit shorter,\" Yiong said.\n\nSizing is different for Asian women, too, she added.\n\n\"We don't necessarily grow taller as we get bigger; we grow width-wise,\" Yiong said.\n\nShe also said that international brands do not suitably cater to the hot and humid climate that Southeast Asia is known for.\n\n\"Fresh international brands, let's say Alo, for example, they come in bringing winter season clothes,\" she said. \"There's no winter; we only have one season, so the fabric needs to be cooling.\"\n\nCheak's prices are slightly lower than those of its foreign competitors. One of Cheak's bestselling sports bras costs 55 Singapore dollars, or about $42, while a similar-looking piece from Lululemon costs S$58.\n\nThe business has yet to come between the founders.\n\n\"Outside of work, we don't talk about work,\" Chng said. \"We see each other on weekends, and our partners hang out together, but we never talk about work.\"\n\nOn the flipside, at work, they don't talk about other things, helping to distinguish their \"work personality and friend personality.\"\n\nYiong handles the backend work, while Chng handles the creative and customer-facing parts of the work.\n\nBut work and life inevitably collide, like when they go on holiday together and fire up their laptops to solve a crisis.\n\n\"Our partners see that as their cue to go do their own thing,\" Yiong joked.\n\nRunning their business comes with many perks. Chng, who just had a baby, said she loves having a flexible schedule and working in a hybrid setting.\n\nBut that doesn't mean it's less stressful than a corporate job.\n\n\"I think a lot of people glamorize what being a founder or starting your own business is,\" she said. \"You have to be able to give up everything, your time, your money, your brain power, your emotions into the business because if you don't do it, no one else is going to.\"\n\nShe added, \"It takes a different kind of resilience to handle it, but at the same time, I wouldn't trade it for anything.\"",

    "fullText": "Many CEOs see meetings as the pinnacle of corporate bureaucracy — and have been on a tear to minimize them.\n\nSnowflake CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy is no exception. Business Insider previously reported that Snowflake has tracked the number of phone calls and in-person meetings as it pushes for greater efficiency. Ramaswamy told Business Insider that \"meetings are like bureaucracies,\" and that \"all of us hate bureaucracies except our own.\"\n\nRamaswamy, who joined the cloud data-warehousing company in 2023, said he doesn't make product or company decisions one-on-one with anyone, and expects published notes about them before and after.\n\nTo ensure that meetings are an effective use of everyone's time, the CEO said he still tries to stick to clear principles. Here are the four requirements he has for all meetings:\n\nRamaswamy's first requirement is to share an agenda prior to the meeting.\n\n\"I will not go to meetings whose agendas and materials are not published in advance,\" the CEO said.\n\nHe said he's an early riser and he spends every morning from 5 a.m. to 7 a.m. prepping for the various meetings he's going to that day. In addition to receiving an agenda before, he said he also expects notes after every meeting.\n\nRamaswamy said he doesn't hold meetings just to check a box. Instead, the CEO said he's a \"huge fan\" of making sure meetings are run well — with the right people in the room and a clear point of view on the topic being discussed.\n\n\"Meetings should not become something for prestige or for being in the loop,\" Ramaswamy said.\n\nRamaswamy said he uses meetings as a place to push for open conversation instead of repeating facts.\n\n\"Facts can be read offline. It is more efficient,\" the CEO said.\n\nRamaswamy said he makes an effort to ensure there's a diverse range of viewpoints in his meetings. He said sometimes he attends sessions where one or two people take over — and he tries to steer the group away from those dynamics.\n\n\"If I am in any any meeting and I see that happen, I see that as my job to make sure that there is a fair distribution of time and people feel like their voices are indeed being heard,\" Ramaswamy said.\n\nRamaswamy said he feels generally \"itchy in meetings\" and wants to get things done quickly. He said if he ends a meeting with achieving \"glorious success,\" he suggests everyone exits it on the spot.\n\n\"We should all leave quietly right now, in case we just create more problems for ourselves,\" Ramaswamy said he tells employees.",

    "description": "Business Insider's health team share the best tips and trends we followed this year, from workout hacks to healthy eating to better morning routines.",
    "fullText": "As a health reporter, I love to tell people \"no.\"\n\nNo, you probably don't need to add protein to everything. No, you won't get swole in a month with that one-minute Instagram workout. No, a Paleo diet won't fix all your problems (and probably isn't historically accurate).\n\nThat's why, as the end of the year approaches, I wanted to change things up and ask my esteemed colleagues what simple hacks actually have made a difference for them — whether it's working out smarter, eating better, and living well.\n\nAfter a year of talking to health experts, and reading lots and lots of science, here's what helped us move the needle for a healthier mind and body in 2025.\n\nLike many of our readers, I live in a household with two working parents. Our kids are still on the younger side, 6 and 8, so life is fairly hectic. Of course, my mind is always racing, planning, organizing, scheduling, and doing all of the other things that come along with managing the mental load that we're all very aware of these days. Turning my brain off, or at least briefly pushing pause, is tricky, especially at bedtime.\n\nCommitting to taking a few deep breaths as soon as I get under the sheets has done wonders for me. Sometimes I'll follow a quick meditation track on my phone; other times, I'll do some box breathing. But more often than not, I just try to breathe in and out for a few minutes, focusing on the movement of my body and nothing else. The practice helps clear my mind and gets my body ready for bed — and the flurry I know tomorrow will bring.\n\nJennifer Beck Goldblatt, Senior Editor, Health & Parenting\n\nThis year, I've been putting a little bit of ginger in almost everything. Fresh ginger tea, grated ginger to add zip to soups and stews, and crystallized ginger as a sweet treat. I generally eat a healthy diet — lots of fiber, fruits and veggies, home-cooked meals — but the extra ginger has made a big difference for my gut health. I'm less likely to have an upset stomach even when I indulge my passion for spicy food.\n\nOne of my favorite recipes to make in big batches is fresh ginger tea with turmeric, black pepper, a bit of cayenne, and plenty of honey. It smells great, and it's warming and full of antioxidants for a perfect self-care break any time of day.\n\nMidway through the year, I bought a Brick for my phone. It's a gadget on my fridge that helps me block whichever apps I choose (in my case, my email and internet, since I already got rid of social media on my phone).\n\nI tap my phone every night before I unwind for bed and usually don't tap again until right before work starts — my peak junk-scrolling times. Something about the humiliation of having to physically walk up to my fridge because I want to Google an actor from a niche '80s movie keeps me from un-Bricking. I get to my morning workouts quicker and read more books, which has made me a much happier person.\n\nBuying an air fryer has been a game changer for quickly rustling up nutritious food. I thought they were for heating up fries and frozen treats, and that you couldn't use them to heat saucy foods, like the curries and bean stews I cook and freeze.\n\nSince realizing you can get air fryer-proof dishes, which can be DIYed with foil or baking paper, I've made dozens of protein pancakes for breakfast. I enjoy frozen veggies that are no longer soggy and sad from being defrosted in the microwave, batch-cook chicken meatballs in 10 minutes before work, and can quickly reheat my trusty frozen beans. (To make pancakes, mix up the regular ingredients, cook the batter in a single layer in the air fryer, then chop and stack once cooked.)\n\nKashmira Gander, Senior Health Editor\n\nMy kids are finally all in the same school (and therefore same schedule), which means I have a bit more time in the mornings for myself before hopping online for work. I've been taking 15-30 minute walks in the morning to get some fresh air and sunlight before spending the rest of my day in front of a computer.\n\nI joke I'm like a plant and need as much sunlight as possible to have the best mood I can have, so prioritizing time outside has helped, especially with SAD now that the darker months are upon us [that's seasonal affective disorder — when your mood and energy tanks in the fall and winter.]\n\nConz Preti, Deputy Editor, Parenting & Health\n\nIn March of this year, I committed to waking up after my first alarm goes off, rather than snoozing it at least two extra times, as I had been accustomed to doing since middle school.\n\nI made this small but radical change because I was feeling exhausted all the time, and I've found that my energy level feels far more stable, and my mood tends to be better throughout the day when I manage it. It can be really difficult in the moment, but the payoff has been huge!\n\nI finally started pelvic floor physical therapy! And, reader, let me tell you: It's worth it. The pelvic floor is a \"hammock\" of muscles in your pelvis that controls your core, your breathing, your bladder, your sexual function, your digestive system, and so much more.\n\nCan you feel yours? Unless you're pregnant or have incontinence, the answer is probably \"no.\" But that doesn't mean you should leave it un-therapized. Even just one session with a pelvic floor PT showed me what I was doing wrong. I left with useful exercises I can do to improve my core control and my breathing so that my workouts are more effective, and don't put unnecessary stress on my organs. I'm a convert.\n\nMia de Graaf, Deputy Executive Editor, Health & Features\n\nI'd been in a running rut for years. I was bored with my usual routine of running a few miles at a leisurely pace, but trying to actively track and increase my speed felt daunting as well. Getting a VO2 max assessment taught me that I could run a lot faster than I thought I could — and having exact numbers to shoot for was very helpful, too. I've since joined a nearby Orangetheory, which focuses on hitting higher heart rate zones throughout class, and have slowly inched up to running paces I thought unimaginable a year ago.\n\nMy trainer gave me some advice that helped me get through a big fitness slump.\n\nEveryone's training typically falls into three phases each year: terrible, OK, and great, he said. I was in the \"terrible\" stage, where your motivation is wiped.\n\nTo my surprise, that's where my trainer was, too. Learning that even athletes like him struggle with motivation helped ease my embarrassment.\n\nIt made it easier to give myself permission not to go near a gym for three months after I got burned out by a Hyrox-esque fitness contest. I thought long-term, enjoyed leisurely walks, and the odd PS Fit YouTube dance video, knowing I'd eventually get back to regular exercise, whether that was restarting functional fitness or trying something new.\n\nI was right: I'm now doing regular Saturday morning 5K runs with my neighbor, and started using the Ladder training app this fall. The big takeaway: be kind to yourself.\n\nKashmira Gander, Senior Health Editor",

Arduini, the man tapped to lead the $20 billion-a-year business, spoke to Fortune about how he’s forging a new chapter for the medical technology and digital health company while drawing on GE’s legacy.\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nYou were initially at GE during the Jack Welch years, starting in 1990, and left a few years after Jeff Immelt took over. What do you think made GE stand apart?\n\nAt the time, I was a Proctor & Gamble guy, and I did not love the grocery business. I got a call from someone who talked about a perfect opportunity in technology and global businesses at a company called GE Medical Systems at the time. I didn’t even know GE had a medical business then.\n\nGoing to GE in those days, with its leadership development, you had the opportunity to take on bigger responsibilities at a very young age—I look back and say, probably too young an age. But it was one of those rare companies where they gave you bold assignments and you had this wide diversity of potential opportunities that you could play in. You learned how to run a company the GE way. The candor and the openness about what’s working, what’s not working, really permeated, how to do the right thing. It was tough culture, but you knew it was a fair culture, and that’s what really made it successful under Jack.\n\nAfter leaving in 2005, what made you decide to come back?\n\nA headhunter called and said, [the then-GE CEO] Larry Culp wants to speak with you.’ And I said, ‘I don’t know if I’m really interested in going back to GE.’ My wife convinced me to give a call back. I talked to the headhunter, and he said, ‘Well, I’ll pass it on to Larry.’ Literally, 10 minutes later, I got a text that said, ‘Hey, Pete, this is Larry Culp. I’d love to chat with you.’ I texted back to say, ‘Well, look, I can contact your assistant.’ And Larry, right then, said, ‘Hey, do you have five minutes now?’ That’s the essence of Larry; he’s a very down-to-earth guy, a very focused and very intentional guy.\n\nThose five minutes convinced you to take the job?\n\nIt was probably more than the five, but honestly, his impact and his leadership made a difference. This was a chance to create three separate companies, to take this company public. I got very interested and very excited about it.\n\nWhy did it make sense for GE HealthCare to be a separate company?\n\nEverything has a cycle. On the technology side and on the market side, there was such a fast transition and evolution, with new competitors coming into new markets. When you’re in a larger business, in many cases, decisions take longer. And focus matters in our business. It is all about signal to noise; you want more signal, less noise. In a larger company, there has to be a little bit more noise.\n\nThe past three years have been interesting time for med tech. Looking back, what did you over-index on or under-appreciate?\n\nAt a macro level, look at the environment, between the China market, which was always a double-digit growth or changing the geopolitical environment and how we need to change around our supply chains because of tariffs. Those are kind of the unplanned events that where you ask: Do you have the right people? Do you have a management system that can deal with the clock speed and the differentiation? Do you have the right innovation-processing capability? If you don’t have the innovation, it’s difficult to get the price, it’s difficult to hold share, it’s difficult to grow. We were somewhat of a cash cow as part of the GE integrated model. We weren’t starved, but we weren’t funded for leading innovation. So I’d say one of the things I felt that I did well—and, like most credit, comes from listening to people that are wiser than you and having humility to understand that that’s the action—is lean into innovation.\n\nYou think what products you need, four years out, and fund them to the max, because it’s the rules of the farm. You got to get the seeds in the ground. They’ve got to germinate. You got to get the plants to grow till you get fruit. In our business, that’s a three to five year cycle.\n\n“We laid out this purpose of creating a world where health care has no limits, and a big part of that was to say we’re humble to know that we don’t have all the answers.”GE HealthCare CEO Peter J. Arduini\n\nI think our teams did a really good job with the focus on making the right investments early. In 2018, to give an example, we probably spent $750 million to $800 million on research and development. R&D will be north of $1.4 billion this year. So we fundamentally doubled the R&D investment. We cut costs in other areas and simplified some of the company.\n\nThrough lean manufacturing techniques?\n\nWe changed some of the field organization, about 40% to 50% of the leaders. We upgraded talent across the board, and I spent a lot of time on what our vision is, what our values are, and do we have the right people who can match up to that? In the last two years, we’ve really made a lot of progress on what we’re calling our heartbeat management system, which is really about a lean principles construct for how you run your company. What is the daily management at different levels in the organization? What is standard work that is needed to be done in all areas, the use of Kaizen and really bringing customer employees into the decision making?\n\nLarry Culp is a big proponent of Kaizen and I think back to GE’s reputation in promoting Six Sigma. How would you say the culture has shifted as an independent company?\n\nI tried to take the GE of old and took what was really good: how we think about our distribution of leadership, how we actually talk about leader development, how we build out our own Crotonville virtual university of development. The GE model was really stellar, and, honestly, prior to Larry coming back, some of that had dissolved. We didn’t even really do performance reviews in the same way and he brought that back.\n\nI would say I even reached back further to some of the Jack Welch-period of tools, There are things that we did really well that we want to utilize in a more contemporary way. As an example, I think Crotonville was a fabulous destination for training and development, In today’s world, it’s not practical to bring everybody to upstate New York, but we can take the tools and the capabilities and recreate that in virtual and other environments around the world.\n\nIn health care, we had our own distinct way of thinking about innovation pipeline, and it was something called worldwide product. It had kind of phased away in the last decade or so, and I resurrected it, but in a new format: more digital focused, more connected …from diagnosis through therapy, through action, follow up and how the money flows. The integration of cloud-based computing and artificial intelligence. We look at the full stack for the company. And that’s been a game changer for us to take valuable resources and move them.\n\nWe laid out this purpose of creating a world where health care has no limits, and a big part of that was to say we’re humble to know that we don’t have all the answers. We want to work with customers on jointly solving problems which, again, is the core to the lean mindset. Servant leadership as a big part of it, which turns the pyramid upside down. My job is to help everybody else get their job done. We’re all focused on the customer. We’re all focused on the patient. We spent a lot of time talking about entrepreneurship because in our business, the way we’re going to be successful is in this broader ecosystem. We don’t have to own everything, we don’t have to make everything, but we have to be more creative. We talk about teamwork and inclusive teams. We actually drive and reward and recognize people on how well they live up to those values.\n\nThe landscape has shifted for global companies. Where do you see the biggest challenges and opportunities right now?\n\nIf I think about med tech as an industry, it’s an American gem. Still, 70%-plus of the products are made the United States, the majority of the IP, the technology is here. And so having that protected or enhanced by our government policy is important.\n\nWe’ve spent a lot of time trying to make that case clear and I think, for the most part, it’s been heard. Having global footprints and manufacturing and R&D is super critical because you can’t make everything in the United States to be competitive. You can’t, in a world post-COVID, have an integrated single point of control for all supply chains. Many of us used to say, here’s the least expensive place to buy this, or the best quality, then we would do it one place and ship it all over the world. We found during COVID that’s just not the model that works.\n\nWe’re bringing more and more U.S. products and their subcomponents back to North America. In China, we used to ship in 75% of the products from different parts around the world. Now we make 85%, almost 90% of the products in China, for China.\n\nWhy do you want to be in China?\n\nLook,it’s 1.4 billion people, where 400 million have reasonable. We often forget that. You know, we’re a nation of 375 million people, and you can judge how good our care is. There’s still a billion people in China that don’t have adequate care, and so at some point, it will be the largest health care market. I’m a big believer that, with China and the U.S., the more we work together in harmony, it’s only going to help the world. And honestly, for companies like us, it’s really a necessity for being able to kind of reach our full potential.\n\nYou’ve been at companies that are known as training grounds for leaders. I’d just love to hear your reflections on being in a CEO role the last three years.\n\nI think authenticity is super important. I can be an extrovert when needed, but I tend to be a little bit more introverted. In today’s world, with our younger employee base, being out front and being vocal as the senior leader—not necessarily the charismatic leader, but the communicator directly to individuals—is super important. Social media gets more reads from your employees than even some internal communications. It’s a reality.\n\nI think this ability to reach people in many different ways is critical for running a company. Leaning in on what the mission of the company is, and the why and helping people understand the why, is also critical. And then there’s the classic age-old factor of bringing customers into the story, talking about how you’ve changed the life of a patient. This could be your mother, your father on that table. The more I can empower people to live those values, that’s how we get excellence.",

    "description": "14-year-old Alby Churven founded Clovr. He told Business Insider his age gave him a \"wow factor\" but limits his \"legitimacy.\"",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Alby Churven, the 14-year-old founder of Clovr, who lives in Wollongong, Australia. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhen I was younger, I started an e-commerce grip socks brand called Alpha Grips. It failed, but that's what got me interested in business. I was 12.\n\nA lot of kids' first businesses is always something to do with e-commerce, like drop-shipping or clothing brands. Social media does saturate you with that \"get rich quick\" idea with drop-shipping or crypto. Although 90% of the time it's a scam, it still ignites an interest.\n\nThen I came up with the idea of Finkel, the startup I applied to Y Combinator with. I sent a cold email to Frank Greeff who's a pretty big founder here. He recommended I started building in public on social media, so I started doing that. X is full of startups.\n\nSocial media played a big role, seeing other people building brands and businesses. That's what got me into it. I used to do code camps when I was younger, so I've always been interested in tech and entrepreneurship.\n\nI applied to YC. Apparently I wasn't supposed to do this big video with all the editing. It's supposed to be, you sit down and turn on the webcam and talk. I didn't actually read the instructions when I did it, but I guess that's what made it pretty viral.\n\nMy application video for Y Combinator.\n\nJust applied to @ycombinator as a 14 year old founder. pic.twitter.com/hB44OvbbXh\n\nThere's a new social media ban in Australia for people under 16. All these great things have happened for me with it, but the social media ban is taking that away. I don't agree with it, but it is what it is.\n\nI'm young. I think my advantage being a teenage entrepreneur is I've got time. My goal right now is to build as many things as possible, learn as much as possible, and see where it goes.\n\nYou decide you want to do maybe when you're 18 or 16. But I know what I want to do. I want to be in startups and tech.\n\nThe benefits of starting young is that you don't have as much pressure on you financially, so you can just build things.\n\nIn the future, I'll have had experience. It's about learning. I have time on my hands, and I enjoy it.\n\nThe younger generation thinks a bit differently. Some older people may not even know how to use AI.\n\nI'm in the US right now, and I've been meeting with a lot of really cool people. When you're young, you can utilize your age to make a lot of connections. It's more rare. It's crazy you're doing it this young.\n\nMy age is a wow factor, but it also limits legitimacy.\n\nIt also can be a negative. People might not take you seriously if you're really trying to pursue something. All the things I'm building are bootstrapped, because it's impossible to raise funding when you're young.\n\nI'm getting to stages in my projects where I do need some money. I've applied to these accelerators. I had a very low expectation for Y Combinator. I got an interview about my other startup, Clovr, but then I got rejected.\n\nI've heard you have to get in the system early, so when I'm older and I apply, I'll already be in the system and have experience with how the process works.\n\nI do think grants are a really good opportunity. You won't raise nearly as much, but you're not giving away any equity. I think giving away equity young is not a good decision. It gives pressure to perform and deliver, and when you're young, you want to build stuff.",

    "description": "A trio of traders who rose to fame betting against the US housing market told Business Insider they see a continuation of debasement trade in 2026.",
    "fullText": "Michael Burry gets a lot of attention these days, but there were a handful of other traders who also saw the collapse of US housing market coming from a mile away.\n\nThree of them told Business Insider recently that they're all betting on the same macro development in 2026.\n\nAmong the traders who rose to fame during the subprime mortgage crisis were the members of a small investing firm called FrontPoint Partners. They included Danny Moses, Vinny Daniel, and Porter Collins. All three have left the company and now collaborate on a Substack and podcast titled What Are We Doing?, on which they discuss contrarian investment takes.\n\nBusiness Insider recently asked all three traders about their highest conviction calls heading into 2026, and each had a similar answer.\n\nIn short, the trio highlighted a slow-burning macro shift that they see putting pressure on the US dollar.\n\nThe stock market has enjoyed a year of mostly upward momentum in 2025, primarily benefitting from the AI trade, an area Moses has expressed some skepticism about. But the three traders are maintaining a fairly cautious outlook as they prepare for the coming year.\n\nMoses told Business Insider that if he had to express his high conviction macro view for 2026 through one trade, it would be betting on gold, a cornerstone of his investing strategy for several years.\n\nHe believes that even after gold's breakout year, the precious metal is poised for more growth as the dollar's standing as the world's reserve currency wanes. He noted that he doesn't see anything ahead that could derail gold's rally.\n\n\"Between the geopolitics and the sovereign debt levels, I think it just continues to move higher,\" he said. \"To me, gold is the thing that people should watch as an indication for economic stability or macroeconomic stability, including the US dollar.\"\n\nMoses highlighted a weakened US dollar, noting that a decline in the US currency tends to coincide with strong gold prices.\n\nVincent Daniel, now the co-founder of investment firm Seawolf Capital, also saw a continuation of the debasement trade in 2026. \n\n\"Even though it's been an incredible trade, we think it's going to continue, albeit maybe with a little bit more fits and starts, but we think it'll outperform the S&P,\" he stated.\n\nDaniel said that his firm sees significant growth potential in emerging markets, specifically China and Brazil. He added that while many business-friendly governments have come to power in Latin America recently, Brazil has high interest rates and real rates of return, in addition to attractively priced stocks.\n\nCollins, a portfolio manager at Seawolf Capital, initially hesitated to express one high-conviction macro trade for 2026. However, like Moses, he pointed to the US dollar's ongoing decline, adding that he sees it losing its value against precious metals, naming gold as a key example.\n\n\"I don't know if I have a high conviction around it, but I have a general view that's going to occur,\" he said.\n\nThat said, Collins added that gold prices look stretched and he isn't ruling out a pullback in early 2026.",

    "description": "\"I use it, despite the fact that I think it's going to destroy us,\" one Democratic senator told Business Insider.",
    "fullText": "As recently as June, Sen. Elizabeth Warren was one of several lawmakers who resisted using AI, owing to a skepticism of the technology's ability to deliver accurate information.\n\n\"Yeah, that's changed,\" the Massachusetts Democrat said with a laugh this month, explaining that she now finds ChatGPT to be \"really valuable\" for basic research questions, even if she still catches the occasional hallucination.\n\nWarren said that she began using ChatGPT more after seeing her daughter use it. She says she doesn't \"rely\" on the technology, but uses it to \"start to approach a problem.\"\n\n\"Like, I'm in the middle of reading something, and I think: How many people are there in Mississippi? And what's the breakdown of little children, and people over 65?\" Warren said. \"I pop that into ChatGPT and get an answer that's better than a straight Google answer. I can get more detail, and more ways to slice and dice the numbers.\"\n\nOther skeptics are tiptoeing their way into using the technology, including some who are otherwise major critics of the AI industry.\n\n\"The other day, I decided, you know what, maybe after doing all these hearings on ChatGPT, I should at least see how it works,\" Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri told Business Insider, saying he asked a \"very nerdy historical question\" to ChatGPT about the Puritans in the 1630s. \"I will say that it returned a lot of good information.\"\n\n\"I use it, despite the fact that I think it's going to destroy us,\" Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut told Business Insider.\n\nAt the highest levels of the American government, personal AI adoption remains spotty. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters in November that she doesn't think President Donald Trump uses the technology himself.\n\n\"I've never witnessed it,\" she said. \"So I can't attest to that.\"\n\nVice President JD Vance, meanwhile, declared himself a \"Grok guy\" in an interview with Fox News's Sean Hannity in November.\n\n\"I think it's the best,\" Vance said of the Elon Musk-owned AI chatbot. \"It's also the least woke.\"\n\nBut House Speaker Mike Johnson said that he hasn't used AI himself, saying on the Katie Miller podcast that he simply hasn't had the \"luxury of time\" to get into it.\n\n\"I just haven't gotten into it yet. My life is not normal right now, okay?\" Johnson said. \"And AI has really been — it's become in popular use really during the term of my speakerhip, for the last two years. And so I just haven't had time to engage.\"\n\nAs lawmakers have begun working more with AI, some have had strange experiences. Democratic Rep. Jared Huffman of California told Business Insider that at one point, he tried to use Microsoft Copilot to look up what was inscribed on the bullet casings of Charlie Kirk's alleged murder suspect.\n\nInstead, Huffman says he ended up in an argument, and that Copilot insisted that Kirk was still alive despite the congressman prompting the AI with information to the contrary.\n\n\"It continued to fight with me, insisting that the whole assassination was a conspiracy theory,\" Huffman said. \"It was freaking weird.\"\n\nMost lawmakers who spoke with Business Insider said that they use ChatGPT.\n\nBut at least one — Democratic Rep. Don Beyer of Virginia — said he preferred to use Anthropic's Claude, owing to the company's focus on safety and ethics in AI.\n\n\"I was very impressed with the fact that they actually put together their own Constitution on the ethical use,\" Beyer said. \"They seem to be — at least they're positioned as — more enlightened.\"",

    "title": "'We made 25 jars at a time with six pans on the go - now our business boasts a world's best marmalade'",
    "description": "Nicola Elliott is founder of Single Variety Co, an award-winning premium preserves brand that’s challenging the way food businesses grow.",
    "fullText": "There couldn’t have been any better validation for Nicola Elliott to launch her food business in 2016 than winning a gold award just one month after producing her first ever batch of Seville marmalade. “It gave me the confidence to go forward if the marmalade was that good,” recalls Elliott, founder of Single Variety Co.\n\nShe went one better this year. At the same World Marmalade Awards, her Amalfi lemon marmalade went to the final round of tasting and then scooped double gold and top accolade in an emotional moment for the British entrepreneur. “To do it at the scale that we are making it says we are doing everything right,” says Elliott.\n\nIn the early throes of her single-fruit preserves startup, Elliott was making 25 jars at a time with six pans going simultaneously and two part-time staff, as well as family and friends helping out.\n\nFrom selling her jams on a Balham market stall to owning her production facility, having shunned mass supermarket listings to retain independent quality, Single Variety Co now produces 5,000 jars per week and is set for latest annual revenues of £1.7m.\n\nIt is all a far cry from seven years ago when Elliott received her first export order to Germany for 8,000 jars of raspberry preserve. “I said ‘yes’ thinking I would be making 25 jars at a time. Somehow we did it over six weeks. We didn’t make any money on the order but it was the turning point for us.”\n\nThe business lesson led to Elliott reluctantly outsourcing production for a few years until her husband — a “people person”, former personal trainer and tennis coach — joined the business and the couple moved to Bristol and a £200,000 outlay to set up their jam factory five years ago.\n\nIn her former career as a fresh foods product developer at the likes of Sainsbury’s, Elliott cut a frustrated figure in a role she admits was cost-focussed and in which quality wasn’t a priority.

    "fullText": "In banking, telecom, and payments, reliability is not a nice to have. It is table stakes. The most reliable systems I have worked on reduce entire classes of bugs before the code even runs. Functional programming and Algebraic Data Types (ADTs) let you push correctness into the type system, so illegal states cannot be constructed in the first place.\n\nMost production incidents are not due to complex algorithms. They are due to the code entering a state that should never have been possible. If you have been on call, you have seen variants of these:\n\nFunctional programming helps by modeling the domain with types that make invalid states unrepresentable. Pure functions and immutability keep behavior predictable and testable.\n\nProduct types combine fields, think \"and\". Sum types choose one of several cases, think \"or\". Together they model your domain rules.\n\nWith this shape, \"paypal\" cannot exist as a Payment. The compiler refuses the value.\n\nWhen you pattern match on a sum type, the compiler can force you to handle every variant. If you later add a new case, every non exhaustive match becomes a compilation error or warning. This is how refactors become safe by default.\n\nAdd a new Crypto method and both code bases will point out every place you must update.\n\nIncident story\n\nA payout worker retries on network timeouts and calls settle() twice. The table allows pending = false and settled = true twice with the same ledger id. Reconciliation finds duplicates and accounting needs a manual fix.\n\nWhy it happened\n\nState is spread across booleans and strings. The database does not express the lifecycle. The application code does, but only by convention and tests.\n\nTransitions become total functions. You can return a Result when a transition is not allowed.\n\nNow the illegal transitions are blocked by construction. Test coverage still matters, but the shape of the model prevents a class of bugs.\n\nRefactor safety\n\nWhen product adds Chargeback, the compiler highlights every match that ignores it. You cannot ship with a half handled lifecycle.\n\nEvery switch on TxnState now requires a chargeback branch. This is free guidance from the compiler.\n\nIncident story\n\nThe call detail record pipeline generates billing events whenever it sees a Connected event. Under jitter and retries, some sessions never receive Completed. The billing system charges based on the wrong boundary and customers complain.\n\nWhy it happened\n\nThe call lifecycle is implicit across many services. A connected session with no end was still billable because there was no type that separated non billable states from billable ones.\n\nNow a connected but never completed call cannot produce a billable duration. The shape forbids the bug.\n\nIncident story\n\nA cache TTL is stored in an environment variable. Someone sets CACHE_TTL_SECS=30s. In JavaScript, Number(\"30s\") yields NaN and your code treats it as zero, disabling caching in production.\n\nThe ambiguity disappears. The code must handle absence and parse errors explicitly.\n\nDo not use null to mean \"maybe\". Do not throw exceptions for expected errors.\n\nThese types make the happy path and the error path equally explicit.\n\nMutable shared state is a common source of heisenbugs under concurrency. Prefer immutable data and pure functions. When you need to update, create a new value.\n\nYour tests become simple. Given the same inputs, the function returns the same output.\n\nNumbers are not self describing. Create types that carry meaning.\n\nYou stop mixing milliseconds with seconds or dollars with cents by accident.\n\nKeep the domain logic pure and push IO to the edges. This makes unit tests cheap and fast.\n\nStart small and make continuous progress. Here is a practical order for a team new to these ideas.\n\nReplace pairs of booleans with a sum type\n\nReplace string enums with discriminated unions\n\nReplace nullable fields with Option\n\nReplace thrown control flow with Result\n\nIntroduce newtypes or branded types for units and ids\n\nPattern matching compiles to simple branches. Discriminated unions in TypeScript are just plain objects. The main cost you will feel is validation at the boundaries in smart constructors. This is a trade worth making. The compiler then protects the interior of the system.\n\nReliability is designed. With Algebraic Data Types, pattern matching, Option and Result, immutability, and smart constructors, you encode domain rules directly in your types. Illegal states cannot compile. This is why industries that cannot afford failure, such as banking and telecom, gravitate to functional ideas.\n\nIf you work on code that touches money, minutes, or public availability, adopt these patterns now.\n\nYour on call shifts will be quieter, and your users will notice the difference.",

    "fullText": "SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Jeffrey R. Holland, a high-ranking official in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints who was next in line to become the faith's president, has died. He was 85.\n\nHolland died early Saturday morning from complications associated with kidney disease, the church announced on its website.\n\nHolland, who died in Salt Lake City, led a governing body called the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, which helps set church policy while overseeing the many business interests of what is known widely as the Mormon church.\n\nHe was the longest-tenured member of the Quorum of the Twelve after President Dallin H. Oaks, making him next in line to lead the church under a long-established succession plan. Oaks, 93, became president of the church and its more than 17 million-strong global membership in October.\n\nHenry B. Eyring, who is 92 and one of Oaks' two top counselors, is now next in line for the presidency.\n\nHolland had been hospitalized during the Christmas holiday for ongoing health complications, the church said. Experts on the faith pointed to his declining health in October when Oaks did not select Holland as a counselor.\n\nHis death leaves a vacancy in the Quorum of the Twelve that Oaks will fill in coming months, likely by calling a new apostle from a lower-tier leadership council. Apostles are all men in accordance with the church’s all-male priesthood.\n\nHolland grew up in St. George, Utah, and worked for many years in education administration before his call to join the ranks of church leadership. He served as the ninth president of Brigham Young University, the Utah-based faith's flagship school, from 1980 to 1989 and was a commissioner of the church’s global education system.\n\nUnder his leadership, the Provo university worked to improve interfaith relations and established a satellite campus in Jerusalem. The Anti-Defamation League later honored Holland with its “Torch of Liberty” award for helping foster greater understanding between Christian and Jewish communities.\n\nOaks, also a former BYU president, reflected Saturday on his more than 50 years of friendship and service with Holland, calling their relationship “long and loving.”\n\n“Over the last three decades as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, he lifted the weary, encouraged the faithful and bore a powerful witness of the Savior — even through seasons of significant personal trials,” Oaks said.\n\nHolland was known as a dynamic orator whose sermons combined scholarship with tenderness. In 2013 he spoke to church members about supporting loved ones with depression and other mental illnesses, sharing openly about times when he felt “like a broken vessel.”\n\nHolland is widely remembered for a 2021 speech in which he called on church members to take up metaphorical muskets in defense of the faith's teachings against same-sex marriage. The talk, known colloquially as “the musket fire speech,” became required reading for BYU freshmen in 2024, raising concern among LGBTQ+ students and advocates.\n\nUtah Gov. Spencer Cox, a Latter-day Saint, said no church leader has had a more profound impact on his faith than Holland.\n\n“His words had a way of penetrating my soul like no other,” Cox said. “In times of trial or darkness, I would return to them over and over again and feel the light and peace I needed.”\n\nHolland was preceded in death by his wife, Patricia Terry Holland. He is survived by their three children, 13 grandchildren and several great-grandchildren.\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Holland was preceded in death by his wife.",

    "title": "Immigration lawyers say the H-1B chaos is forcing tough business calls",
    "description": "H-1B visa policy shifts in 2025 cause firms to reconsider staffing, use alternative visas, and update HR travel guidance.",
    "fullText": "Since September, the H-1B visa program has been caught in a whirlwind of changes.\n\nAs a result, companies nationwide are scrambling to determine their next steps, rewriting travel guidance for foreign workers, and lining up backup staffing plans, including shifting some work overseas, according to five immigration attorneys who spoke with Business Insider.\n\n\"Unpredictability is one of the number one enemies for business,\" said Rohit Srinivasa, an immigration attorney based in Los Angeles who works with startups and medium-sized tech companies.\n\nFirst came a $100,000 fee on new applications in September. Then came social media vetting requirements that left visa holders stranded abroad during the holidays. Now, a wage-based lottery system will favor the highest-paid applicants by giving them more chances in the annual H-1B lottery.\n\nImmigration lawyers say the constant policy shifts have companies tightening sponsorship guidelines, re-budgeting for higher costs, and gaming out contingency plans for a program that keeps changing shape.\n\nCompanies are taking a more calculated approach to who they sponsor for work visas and how they do so, attorneys told Business Insider.\n\nDivij Kishore, an immigration attorney at New York-based Flagship Law, which represents clients across various sectors, including tech, healthcare, and energy, told Business Insider that he has seen a 40% to 50% drop in H-1B sponsorship inquiries compared to previous years.\n\nTypically, by this time of the year, clients reach out with lists of employees they'd like to sponsor for the spring lottery, Kishore said.\n\n\"This year, that's not been the case because employers are just not sure what the costs are,\" Kishore said.\n\nOn the other hand, K. Edward Raleigh, a partner at immigration firm Fragomen, which represents some of Silicon Valley's largest tech companies, including Apple and Nvidia, told Business Insider that he hasn't seen a material slowdown in H-1B filings overall, as most are renewals for existing workers.\n\nStill, companies are \"tightening up their sponsorship guidelines\" and \"proceeding with caution, understanding that various things could trigger the fee,\" he said.\n\nThis recalculation is occurring despite the $100,000 fee having a narrow scope. It applies to new visa petitions for workers living abroad and does not apply to the vast majority of cases, such as foreign students already in the US switching from an academic visa to a work visa or existing H-1B holders changing employers.\n\n\"One of the main attributes of this administration is that they keep people guessing,\" said Ted Chiappari, who leads the immigration practice at law firm Duane Morris. \"Just because things are one way on Monday doesn't mean they're going to be the same way on Tuesday, and they won't switch back to things on Wednesday.\"\n\nFewer H-1B visas have been issued to Indian IT consulting firms, according to data from the National Foundation for American Policy, an Arlington-based nonprofit research organization focused on immigration and international trade.\n\nInstead, for the first time in the program's history, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and Google occupied the top four spots for H-1B approvals in fiscal year 2025, a shift that began before the recent policy upheaval. The trend suggests companies were already reassessing tech hiring strategies before the recent policy changes.\n\nDespite the turmoil, Srinivasa believes the H-1B will endure, saying the program is \"so baked in\" to the US economy, he said, that it's undergoing overhaul rather than replacement.\n\nSome sectors saw more impact than others. Universities and nonprofit healthcare organizations that have historically recruited professors and medical workers from abroad have largely stopped filing petitions subject to the fee, Chiappari said. Unlike for-profit companies, these institutions can hire H-1B workers throughout the year without going through the annual lottery.\n\n\"That pipeline is now dried up,\" Chiappari said.\n\nRather than abandoning H-1B sponsorship, companies are exploring alternative pathways and backup strategies.\n\nSrinivasa said interest in O-1 visas for workers with \"extraordinary ability\" has surged, though not everyone qualifies. To qualify, applicants typically need to demonstrate a track record of impact and achievements in their field as evidenced by patents, awards, membership in select associations, and media coverage about them.\n\nSome founders from countries with US trade treaties are turning to E-2 investor visas, which also provide work authorization for spouses. Others are using the EB-1C path, where companies send managers abroad for a year before bringing them back to the US.\n\nCompanies are also increasingly establishing international offices and using L-1 visas to transfer employees to the US, or opting for services like Deel and Rippling that serve as the official employer, handling immigration paperwork on behalf of client companies.\n\nBig Tech, as well as Wall Street firms such as JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs, have been expanding their operations in Indian cities like Bengaluru and Hyderabad.\n\nKishore said some clients are preemptively reaching out to offshore providers to ramp up staffing capacity in case they are unable to bring workers to the US as planned.\n\n\"If they can't spend that same hundred dollars within the US next year, they will spend a hundred dollars outside the US,\" he added.\n\nStarting with the 2026 lottery, visa applications will be weighted based on salary level. Workers offered the highest wages will get four entries in the lottery, while those at the lowest tier get just one. The administration says this will ensure visas are awarded to the most skilled workers.\n\nRaleigh said companies are already thinking about how this will affect their recruitment strategy, \"without the exact terms of how those rules are going to work.\"\n\nThe change will likely benefit large tech companies that can afford to place workers in top salary bands, while creating challenges for smaller companies, nonprofits, and early-stage startups.\n\n\"Often the best startup founders forgo being paid a living wage because they're so dedicated to the mission,\" said Sophie Alcorn, a Bay Area immigration attorney who focuses on startups and entrepreneurs. \"Those same startups may be the ones that have the most difficulty in getting the right people through this future system.\"\n\nKishore said that a higher salary doesn't always mean more skill. A first-year associate at a major law firm might make $225,000, while an equally qualified associate at a smaller firm makes significantly less. Under the new system, the big-firm lawyer would have much better lottery chances, he said.\n\nSome attorneys are advising clients not to artificially inflate salaries to game the system. Chiappari said the spread between wage levels is typically $20,000 to $30,000 — far less than the $100,000 fee — and companies aren't rushing to increase compensation anyway.\n\nImmigration attorneys previously thought that the $100,000 fee might improve the chances for foreign students already studying in the US by increasing their chances if fewer companies enter candidates in the lottery. Now, the wage-based lottery means that it might not happen.\n\n\"That logic's been turned on its head,\" said Kishore, adding that students, who typically enter the workforce at lower salaries, will get fewer chances at the lottery.\n\nBeyond policy changes, companies are also recalibrating their compliance strategies to avoid triggering fees or violating new rules.\n\nRaleigh said that ensuring workers maintain valid immigration status has become even more critical, as any lapse could force someone to leave the country and return on a new H-1B visa, potentially triggering the $10,000 fee.\n\nCompanies are updating their HR policies, including guidance on social media presence for foreign hires, in response to new vetting requirements, Srinivasa said. Some are advising employees to avoid international travel altogether, even when technically permitted.\n\nChiappari said he still gets constant questions from worried H-1B holders about whether it's safe to travel internationally.\n\n\"Even if I write a three-page affidavit explaining how they're not going to have any trouble coming back to the United States, they're just not going to believe it, and they're staying here,\" Chiappari said. \"They're just not traveling.\"\n\nThe human cost is real: postponed weddings, skipped vacations, and delayed work travel.\n\n\"Employers,\" Kishore said, \"need to be prepared and agile for what's coming in the next few months.\"",

    "description": "Joshua Nelken-Zitser, a senior reporter at Business Insider,  balanced his job with writing his first book. Consistency and celebrating small wins were key.",
    "fullText": "When I got my book deal with HarperCollins UK, I was thrilled that a childhood dream of becoming an author was coming true.\n\nThen, reality hit. I had less than a year to research and write an 80,000-word book.\n\nI had never taken on anything this big before, and certainly not alongside a full-time job. The prospect of juggling a 9-to-5 as a journalist with such a time-consuming passion project felt terrifying.\n\nBut by being intentional with my time and relying on a few key productivity habits, I've ended up with a book I'm proud of, all without losing sleep.\n\nI asked a couple of author friends how they balanced their day job with writing a book. One said he wrote in the twilight hours; the other woke up at the crack of dawn.\n\nI also looked for clues from people I interviewed at work, like 21-year-old Nathaneo Johnson, who ran a startup while studying at Yale and told me he often put in 18-hour days.\n\nIt became clear they found time for their passion projects by eating into their sleep. But sacrificing precious shut-eye was not something I was prepared to do.\n\nWhile some people are able to get by on less than the recommended seven to nine hours of sleep, I'm not wired that way. When I'm sleep-deprived, I am not my best self, nor my second or third best. I tend to get grouchy, lose focus more easily, and become more prone to getting sick.\n\nIf sleep was non-negotiable, I knew that I needed to carve out time elsewhere.\n\nMy free hours after finishing work and at weekends seemed like the most obvious place to claw back some time to write my book. Normally, those slots would be filled with episodes of \"Below Deck,\" reading fiction, or meals with friends.\n\nI worked out that freeing up roughly two hours on workdays and a sensible eight hours on weekends, by cutting down on my favourite activities for almost a year, would be manageable. Although it doesn't sound like much, the hours add up.\n\nOver a month, it would give me more than 100 hours to work with.\nAcross the eleven months between signing my deal and my deadline, that would come to almost 1,000 potential hours — the equivalent of 45 straight days of work without sleep.\n\nI didn't know how many hours it would take to finish my book, but the math showed that the workload would be feasible if I chipped away at it steadily, rather than cramming the writing into an impossible final stretch.\n\nIn the end, I doubt I racked up anywhere close to 1,000 hours (I took days off to relax, socialize, and vacation), yet I still managed to finish my first draft several weeks ahead of schedule.\n\nWhile writing a book is a creative process, I approached my schedule with scientific precision.\n\nI built a basic Google Sheet template to track my progress and created a formula that took into account my total word count target and the number of days I had left. This gave me a total number of words I needed to write each day to stay on track. I updated it after every writing session.\n\nWatching the total word count climb and the daily target shrink gamified the process, which was both motivating and reassuring. It also helped me judge when I was ahead of schedule and could therefore say \"yes\" to social plans.\n\nI saw how my incremental efforts were adding up. Consistency, I learned early on, was the only way to tackle such a project.\n\nI didn't follow my schedule perfectly: there were impromptu reporting trips, days I was too exhausted to work, and social plans I didn't want to turn down. But being consistent on average gave me enough wiggle room that these interruptions didn't derail my entire schedule.\n\nThroughout the process, I tried not to become a recluse. I didn't want to lose friends or my sanity along the way, so I made sure to have at least one thing each week to look forward to, whether it was hanging out with family or simply taking a long walk and enjoying a chai latte with friends.\n\nMarking milestones mattered, too. At a third, halfway, and two-thirds of the book, my husband and I either went out for dinner or popped open a bottle of Prosecco. And when I finally handed in my manuscript, we went on vacation.\n\nCelebrating the small wins gave me concrete, near-term rewards to work toward, which kept me motivated and protected my mental health. I locked in time for the gym, where I'd watch reality TV on the elliptical, to make sure that I was staying happy and healthy.\n\nI tried to adopt a \"work smart, not hard\" mindset, occasionally using online tools to make my life easier. Instead of wasting time formatting or tidying my chaotic notes, I'd prompt ChatGPT to turn them into clear, bullet-point summaries. I also used AI transcription software to write up interviews.\n\nSimple shortcuts like these saved me from tedious admin and freed up time for the stuff that actually mattered, like research and writing.\n\nI didn't get everything right. Some days I was well ahead of schedule, but pushed myself to work anyway, out of guilt for feeling lazy. A couple of times that brought me close to burnout and forced me to take a few days off from writing to recuperate. I should have listened to my body and paced myself.\n\nI also recognize that I had some advantages: I don't have kids or other caregiving responsibilities, my husband kindly took on more than his fair share of household chores, and my workplace allowed me a short period of unpaid leave to focus on my book.\n\nStill, being intentional with my time made juggling a full-time job and a book far more manageable than I could have ever imagined.\n\nI learned that I didn't need to sacrifice sleep to live out a lifelong dream, as long as I used my waking hours wisely.\n\nNow, with all that work behind me. I can simply look forward to Trauma Bonds being published in January 2027.",

    "fullText": "Indiana's Curt Cignetti scoffs at idea of bye week favoritism before Rose Bowl vs. Alabama originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nIndiana Hoosiers coach Curt Cignetti doesn't make the rules regarding the College Football Playoff. He just plays by them.\n\nThe Hoosiers earned the No. 1 seed in the 12-team field after beating the Ohio State Buckeyes in the Big Ten title game Dec. 6 in Indianapolis, which guaranteed the defending national champions wouldn't finish the season undefeated regardless of when it ends.\n\nGiven the Hoosiers' recent football history, a bye week is uncharted waters for Cignetti. But it's nothing his team can't handle, he told reporters Monday.\n\n“Would I prefer to play earlier? Yeah, I probably would, to be quite honest with you. But that’s not the case, so,\" Cignetti said. “We’re excited about playing. We’re off to a good start. And, it’ll be a tremendous challenge.”\n\nWith the Crimson Tide's road win against the Oklahoma Sooners this past Friday, Cignetti said Indiana didn't feel pressure to take its foot off the gas even though the result (an eventual 34-24 slugfest) was unknown.\n\n\"Well, you know, it is what it is, so you make the most of it,” Cignetti said. “The way we approached it until we knew the opponent? We treated it like two bye weeks, and now we have almost two weeks to prepare for the opponent.”\n\nThe game will likely come down to whoever is the most efficient quarterback between Fernando Mendoza and Ty Simpson, which should make for a potentially thrilling shootout in Pasadena, Calif.\n\nKickoff is set for 4 p.m. ET, as the winner extends the season.",

    "description": "President Trump’s trade policy, inflation and climbing stock prices shaped business and the economy this year.",
    "fullText": "In recent years, macroeconomic tides have ebbed and flowed, but one thing has remained unchanged: Americans’ dim views of the economy.\n\nIn 2023, pundits warned of the “vibecession.” In 2024, concerns about the economy and inflation were top of mind for voters in the presidential race.\n\nThis year, economic pessimism has persisted, as President Trump’s sweeping economic proposals, from his wide-ranging tariffs to his plan to remake the Federal Reserve, have raised uncertainty to new highs. And the economic data is sending mixed, and muddled, signals.\n\nHere are 14 charts that illustrate how uncertainty has unfolded in the economy and markets over the last year, and how it might affect the next.\n\nPresident Trump’s trade war has been one of the biggest sources of economic uncertainty this year. During his campaign, Trump repeatedly cited tariffs as a way to spur American manufacturing, create new jobs and lower U.S. trade deficits.\n\nNearly every country has seen import duties rise.\n\nThe tariffs have made progress toward some of the administration’s stated goals: They have brought the trade deficit down, as exports grew more than imports.\n\nAnd they have made money: Tariff revenues are now at record highs.\n\nBut there is another kind of deficit on investors’ minds: the federal budget deficit. Tariff revenues remain a small share of total government revenues.\n\nHere’s another way in which the effects of tariffs are showing up: higher prices for goods.\n\nConsumer prices started to accelerate in June, and the prices of products most exposed to tariffs notched some of the highest gains.\n\nAnd in recent months, prices for goods continued to rise, contributing more to inflation.\n\nInflation unexpectedly slowed to 2.7 percent in November, according to data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics this week. But economists have advised taking this data with a grain of salt, because of disruptions in the bureau’s data collection efforts during the 43-day federal government shutdown.\n\nIt’s still unclear whether tariffs will cause just a temporary increase in prices or if they will feed into more persistent inflation.\n\nAt this month’s DealBook Summit, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent pushed back against the notion that tariffs had contributed to inflation, saying that they had caused a “one-time price adjustment,” not a “generalized price increase.”\n\nThe chair of the Federal Reserve, Jerome H. Powell, has also said that the Fed expected tariffs to cause a “one-time shift in the price level.” But he has stressed that the increase could be drawn out over several quarters. And at a news conference after last week’s Fed meeting he acknowledged the risk of tariff inflation becoming “more and more persistent.”\n\nIn the first full jobs report since the federal shutdown, the B.L.S. reported that the unemployment rate rose to 4.6 percent last month, a four-year high. Wage growth slowed to its lowest level since 2021. As with inflation, the shutdown affected the data collection for these measures, and the agency said ahead of the release that its estimates of the unemployment rate and other measures would be subject to more uncertainty than usual.\n\nThe average job gain over the last three months\n\nThe average job gain over the last three months\n\nThere was a silver lining: Employers added 64,000 jobs in November, driven largely by gains in the health care sector. But that only partly offset a decline in October.\n\nThe federal government shed 168,000 jobs in October and November, as workers who accepted the Trump administration’s “deferred resignation” offer came off the payroll.\n\nAnd the jobs numbers do not reflect a big downward revision that is expected early next year.\n\n(Revisions to jobs figures are commonplace, but they dominated headlines earlier this year when downward adjustments led Trump to fire the commissioner of the B.L.S., Erika McEntarfer, claiming, without evidence, that the data was “rigged.”)\n\nThe lowest-paid workers have felt the strain of the cooling labor market the most. As the economy started to recover from the pandemic, demand for labor far outstripped supply in the lowest-paid industries, such as leisure and hospitality.\n\nToday, that is no longer the case, and hourly wages are rising most slowly for the lowest earners.\n\nLast year, voters consistently told pollsters that they trusted Donald Trump over Joe Biden and later, Kamala Harris, to do a better job on the economy.\n\nNow, Trump is the one feeling the pressure, as views of his handling of the economy have soured since the summer.\n\nThe risks posed by inflation and a softening labor market have also put the Fed in a tough position. Last week, the central bank decided to cut interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point for a third meeting in a row. But the decision was highly contentious, with three of 12 policymakers voting against it.\n\nPowell said he could have made the case either way for the Fed to cut interest rates or pause reductions, given the competing risks to unemployment and inflation.\n\n“You’ve got one tool,” he said. “You can’t do two things at once.”\n\nTrump, for his part, has made no secret of his desire for lower rates. Next year, he will select a new Fed chair.\n\nAfter a dip earlier this year, most notably amid the chaotic “Liberation Day” tariff rollout, the stock market has, on the whole, kept on going up. The S&P 500 reached a record high just last week, for the 37th time this year.\n\nArguably, company earnings, and their expectations for earnings are the most important factor driving the market movements.\n\nIn fact, earnings expectations have moved in tandem with the S&P 500 price index over the course of this year (again, with the exception of the early months of the year).\n\nOf course, the S&P 500 is driven in large part by big tech companies, which are intertwined with the A.I. boom.\n\nThat has been cause for concern for some investors, who see a parallel between this moment and the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s and early 2000s. But unlike companies leading the stock rally during the dot-com bubble, the public companies with the steepest valuation gains today are earning more as the market goes up.\n\nThe outlook for earnings continues to be bullish in 2026, though there could be weak links in the A.I. chain.\n\nThe crypto boom that Trump’s re-election ushered in is on pause for now.\n\nAfter surging for most of the year, the price of Bitcoin and Ether, along with dozens of other coins, started to plummet on Oct. 10, following Trump’s announcement that he would impose a new tariff on China.\n\n(The stock market on that day also saw the biggest one-day plunge since April, though it has since rebounded and hit a record high.)\n\nFor some, the crypto sell-off has underscored the fact that crypto remains a volatile investment, even as it has entered a new level of mainstream acceptance. Amid a high-stakes lobbying campaign by the crypto industry, Trump ended a regulatory crackdown on crypto and signed legislation outlining the first federal rules for stablecoins, digital tokens tied to assets like the U.S. dollar.\n\nOthers worry that a crypto crash could bleed over to the wider market.\n\nAmid all this uncertainty, people might be looking to pop culture as a form of escape. They haven’t necessarily been finding it at the movies, if ticket sales are any indication.\n\nSummer is a crucial season for Hollywood, accounting for the lion’s share of annual box office revenue. This year, fantasies, science-fiction sequels and superhero flicks were on offer. But moviegoers, for the most part, didn’t bite: It was the worst summer for domestic ticket sales since 1981, after adjusting for inflation and excluding the pandemic years.\n\nThe fall was filled with star-studded flicks, but none of them constituted box office hits.\n\nCan the holiday season help Hollywood make a comeback? “Zootopia 2” and “Wicked: For Good” have gotten it off to a good start.\n\nBut broader concerns abound. Warner Bros. Discovery has struck a deal with Netflix for the Warner Bros. studio and its sibling streaming service, HBO Max, while it has fended off, for the time being, a hostile takeover offer from Paramount.\n\nRegardless of how it all ends, it feels like a moment of loss for cinephiles. Corporate consolidation, after all, is not likely to bode well for the future of the Silver Screen.",

    "description": "Jane Newman says it's been easy to meet new people in Seoul, including through a fan group for a Korean actor she likes.",
    "fullText": "Jane Newman spent her evenings watching K-dramas on her recliner during the pandemic lockdowns. She didn't expect they'd spark a curiosity about South Korea that would eventually lead her to move there and start over.\n\nIn 2023, Newman was working for a consulting firm in Brisbane, Australia. As a manager, her heavy workload didn't let up even as the world began to return to normal.\n\nAfter months of long hours spent in front of a screen, she was burned out and beginning to feel the strain.\n\n\"I started out with a whole lot of shoulder and back pain, and then it developed into arm pain, and I couldn't use my mouse,\" Newman, now 60, told Business Insider.\n\nStanding desks and different chairs fixed little, so she took a sabbatical.\n\nNewman had first visited South Korea the previous year, curious about the country she'd only seen on TV. Remembering how much she had enjoyed that trip, she decided to return for a two-month break.\n\nWhen she went back to work, the symptoms didn't take long to resurface. This time, Newman found herself struggling mentally and emotionally, too.\n\n\"I found it more and more difficult to do my work,\" she said. By July 2024, she and her employer agreed it was best for her to step away from the company.\n\n\"I knew that South Korea was a place that I loved, and it made me feel good,\" Newman said. \"So I made the decision to go back and stay for a few months to see how it felt.\"\n\nFor three months, she lived in an Airbnb in Gwacheon, a city just outside Seoul. Newman lived with her host, a local woman who had invited her to participate in the community events.\n\nThere, she joined a group supporting former US military \"comfort women,\" as well as two English clubs where members met to discuss news, read English fiction together, and give weekly presentations on various topics.\n\n\"I met the most wonderful people, and they really invited me into their conversations. And I got to know a lot more about Korea itself, and its history,\" she said.\n\n\"All of those things made me feel really welcomed, and at home, and part of a community, which is what I was really lacking back in Australia,\" Newman added.\n\nIn Brisbane, her social life largely revolved around people she knew at work, or old friends she'd kept in touch with from her years living in the UK when her daughters were young. She was part of a bushwalking community and a social dining community, but most of those groups faded after the pandemic.\n\nAs Newman considered her next career steps, she found herself drawn toward public speaking and coaching to help people navigate the pressures of modern society and technology.\n\nThat focus also eventually led her to begin developing a tech startup in South Korea aimed at helping young people struggling with social isolation.\n\nShe said her Gen Z daughters weren't surprised by her decision since they already knew how much she loved South Korea. Both had already taken trips to visit her there.\n\nWhen it was time for Newman to look for an apartment, she wanted a place that was close to public transport, with separate spaces for living and sleeping, and a good view.\n\nIt took her about two weeks to find a place. She now lives in Dongdaemun, a popular neighborhood, where her two-bedroom apartment costs 1.43 million Korean won, or about $1,000, a month.\n\nSouth Korea has become an increasingly popular choice for foreigners in recent years.\n\nData from the Ministry of Justice showed that the number of foreigners living in South Korea at the end of 2024 stood at 2.65 million, a 5.7% increase from the year before.\n\nFor Newman, building friendships in Seoul came more naturally than she expected.\n\n\"I've found that every time I've come to Korea, I've made new friends,\" Newman said, adding that this included people she met through a fan group for a Korean actor she admired.\n\nThese days, Newman's routine is a mix of work and settling into life in Seoul.\n\nShe starts her mornings with a coffee from the Starbucks across the street before diving into her coaching sessions and working on getting her startup off the ground.\n\nCompared to her previous job, where working 60 hours a week was common, Newman says she now works around 20 to 30 hours a week.\n\nWith the more flexible schedule, she has time to exercise, meet people, and sometimes work from libraries or cafés.\n\n\"But I do make sure I get out once a day to go out and enjoy this beautiful place I'm living in,\" she said.\n\nDo you have a story to share about relocating to a new city?

    "title": "'Like hitting a lotto ticket.' Why sports memorabilia collectors pursue chase cards",
    "description": "The trading card business is so big, the ecosystem has created specialized markets within it. Collectors can chase a specific team, or stick to vintage cards, among other options.",
    "fullText": "Trading sports cards is a game of negotiation for Greg Petikyan. Within seconds, he talked to multiple vendors at Frank and Son Collectible Show last month offering the same card: a 2025 Panini Donruss Saquon Barkley Downtown.\n\nThe first deal consisted of a 3-for-1 exchange, with an additional couple of hundred dollars to sweeten the deal or a straight purchase for $460. As the vendor looked through his phone for the value of the cards he asked for, Petikyan told him he’ll circle back.\n\nInstead, the entrepreneur offered it to Eric Mitchel, another booth owner, across the aisle and sold it. A rectangular cardboard collectible with the Super Bowl-winning running back in front of the Philadelphia skyline sold for $300.\n\n“Too late,” Petikyan said. “I’ll still buy those cards I asked for.”\n\nNothing personal, just business.\n\nTrading and collecting cards, an industry valued at $14.9 billion in 2024, is estimated to reach $52.1 billion within the next decade, according to Market Decipher report. The sports memorabilia business, as a whole, is estimated to reach a value of $271.2 billion by 2034.\n\nE-commerce platforms like Fanatics Live and Whatnot have turned business transactions involving the cards of sports legends into entertainment and helped grow the market. Heritage Auctions sold the most expensive card in August. The collectible known as the \"holy grail\" by basketball collectors was a 2007-08 Upper Deck Exquisite Collection Dual Logoman Autographs Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant card.\n\nThe one-of-one sold for $12.932 million, a sum that topped a Mickey Mantle card that went for $12.6 million in August 2022. The Jordan-Bryant card is the second-most expensive sports collectible of all time, trailing Babe Ruth's 1932 World Series Jersey, which he wore when he called his shot, that cost $24.12 million.\n\nLast Friday, Heritage Auctions set a sales record for the year by crossing the $2 billion mark. The cards sold that day included a 2003 Upper Deck Exquisite Collection Dual Logoman Jordan-Bryant card for $3,172,000 — this one was not autographed.\n\nThe trading card business has grown so much, the ecosystem has created specialized markets within it. Collectors can chase a specific team; stick to vintage cards; complete a set of prints with mistakes; chase specific relics of their favorite team; or even just buy cards to resell them for the sole purpose of buying more to flip.\n\n\"I know for a fact, a lot of men like to show off their collection,\" Adam Campbell, sports cards specialist with Heritage Auction, said. \"People love to have good, cool collections,\" he added.\n\nThe type of chase can change the direction of a business transaction, said George Peña, 53, another booth owner at Frank and Son, an old Sam's Club that now houses more than 200 vendors selling and showcasing collectible merchandise three days a week.\n\nKids go into his booth and negotiate with him. Most of the time he doesn’t necessarily need a card from them but engages with them to give them the experience.\n\n“Family members get all excited for them,” Peña said.\n\nBut when dealing with people like Petikyan, the stakes change.\n\n“Negotiations are a little different with those kinds of people because they want to make money and we want to make money,” he said as he quipped with Petikyan.\n\nSome collectors have turned into investors because the value of cards is so volatile. It changes in real time — it's fast, unpredictable and relentless. The moment Dodgers designated hitter and pitcher Shohei Ohtani hit three home runs and struck out 10 batters in Game 4 of the 2025 NLCS, the value of his cards went up. But it cuts both ways — the moment Cleveland Guardians pitcher Emmanuel Clase was indicted on federal charges for wire fraud conspiracy and bribery, the value of his cards dipped.\n\n“The value of cards is not based on anything else, whatsoever, except for hype and buzz” Campbell said. “[It's] entirely arbitrary.”\n\nCollecting trading cards has been a part of the culture since Goodwin Tobacco Company released the first set of individual players’ baseball cards in 1886. The N167 Old Judge sets were inserted into tiny cigarette boxes to increase sales and to make sure the cards were not damaged in transit.\n\nSince the tobacco industry started the trade, sports cards have endured changes through generations, each defined by specific characteristics.\n\nThe vintage era, before the 1980s, ushered in simpler designs, lower print runs and sets featuring the legends of all the sports. Then came the junk wax period, marked by mass overproduction that devalued the product. The current ultra modern era evolved the market into investments, scarcity, and digitized the business with websites like Arena Club, which repackages pre-graded cards as slab packs.\n\nNo matter the changes, there remains a common thread within collectors throughout the years: opening packages and feeling a bump of euphoria when a chase card, a sought-after item, appears.\n\n“It’s the best feeling ever, imagine getting a $1,000 card for like 20, 30 bucks?” Petikyan said. “It’s like hitting a lotto ticket, but better, because it could go up in value depending on the player.”\n\nPetikyan, 27 from Montebello, runs a page called Strictly Pullz on the shopping app Whatnot where he opens boxes and auctions the items within them. Any card pulled from a team that's purchased by the individual will be shipped to them. On occasion, he inserts a card with higher value to hype a specific set.\n\nTo some, the business is intertwined with collecting.\n\n“I’ll use some of the money that I am able to make on the business side, to add to my personal collection,” Mitchel said. “Finding items for the personal collection, I wouldn’t find if I wasn’t out for the business part of it.”\n\nRegardless of motivation, pulling a card worth more than the price paid for will remain priceless.\n\n“I just bought a pack and I pulled a card worth $1,000,” Campbell said, speaking as a collector. “It can change your whole day, and maybe your whole week, maybe a whole month or even a whole year every time you open a pack.”\n\nBut, collecting cards is more than just the value of each, Campbell said.\n\n“Do this because you like sports, do this because you love collecting.”\n\nGet the best, most interesting and strangest stories of the day from the L.A. sports scene and beyond from our newsletter The Sports Report.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "title": "American LGBTQ+ athletes struggle to find money in current social, political climate",
    "description": "LGBTQ+ athletes are finding it increasingly difficult to land corporate sponsorships and endorsement deals amid the political climate in the United States.",
    "fullText": "Conor McDermott-Mostowy would like to compete at the Milano Cortina Winter Olympic Games. And he certainly has the talent, desire and ambition to do so.\n\n“You could definitely reach six figures,” David McFarland, McDermott-Mostowy’s agent, said of what the speedskater needs annually to live and train while chasing his Olympic dream.\n\nIn the last year, finding that money has been increasingly difficult because McDermott-Mostowy is gay. Since President Trump returned to the White House in January, bringing with him an agenda that is hostile to diversity, equity and inclusion, sponsors who once embraced LGBTQ+ athletes and initiatives have turned away from the likes of McDermott-Mostowy, with devastating effect.\n\n“There’s definitely been a noticeable shift,” said McFarland, who for decades has represented straight and gay athletes in a number of sports, from the NFL and NBA to professional soccer. “Many brands and speaking opportunities that previously highlighted LGBTQ athletes are now being pulled back or completely going away.”\n\n“And these aren’t just symbolic partnerships,” he added. “They’re vital income opportunities that help athletes fund training, fund their competition and their livelihoods.”\n\nThe impact is being felt across a wide range of sports where sponsorship dollars often make the difference between winning and not being able to compete. But it’s especially acute in individual sports where the athletes are the brand and their unique traits — their size, appearance, achievements and even their gender preferences — become the things that attract or repel fans and financial backers.\n\n“What’s most frustrating is that these decisions are rarely about performance,” McFarland said. “They’re about perceptions in the LGBTQ community. And that kind of fear-driven retreat harms everyone involved because, beyond the human costs, it’s also very short-sighted. The LGBTQ community and its allies represent a multitrillion-dollar global market with immense buying power.”\n\nTravis Shumake, the only openly gay driver on the NHRA circuit, ran a career-high five events in 2022 and said he once had deals with major brands such as Mission Foods, Procter & Gamble and Kroger while using a rainbow-colored parachute to slow his dragster.\n\nKroger is the only one whose support has yet to shrink and as a result, Shumake had to keep his car in its trailer for the final eight months of the year.\n\nAnd when he did race, his parachute was black.\n\n“It was looking very optimistic and bright,” said Shumake, who spends about $60,000 for an engine and as much as $25,000 for each run down the dragstrip. “Being the only LGBTQ driver would have been very profitable. I ended last season with plans to run six to eight races. Great conversations were happening with big, big companies. And now it’s, I did one race, completely based on funding.”\n\n“When you’re asking for a $100,000 check,” he added, “it’s very tough for these brands to take that risk for a weekend when there could be a large backlash because of my sexual identity.”\n\nA sponsorship manager for a Fortune 500 company that had previously backed Shumake said he was not authorized to discuss the decision to end its relationship with the driver.\n\nDaniel T. Durbin, director of the Institute of Sports, Media and Society at the USC Annenberg school, said there could be several reasons for that. A shrinking economy has tightened sponsorship budgets, for example. But there’s no doubt the messaging from the White House has had a chilling effect.\n\n“It certainly makes the atmosphere around the issue more difficult because advertising and promotion tied to social change has come under fire by the Trump administration,” Durbin said.\n\nIn addition, corporate sponsors that once rallied behind diversity, whether out of conviction or convenience, saw the election results partly as a repudiation of that.\n\n“We may be pissing off 50% of the population if we go down this path. Do we really want to do that with our brand?” Durbin said of the conversations corporations are having.\n\nBacking away from causes such as LGBTQ+ rights doesn’t necessarily mean those corporations were once progressive and are now hypocritical. For many, the only color of the rainbow they care about is green.\n\n“You’re trying to give people a philosophy who don’t have a philosophy,” Durbin said. “And even if they believe in causes, they’re not going to self-destruct their company by taking up a cause they believe in. They’re going to take it up in part because they think it’s positive for the bottom line.\n\nAs a result, others have had to step up to try to help fill the funding gap. The Out Athlete Fund, a 501(c)(3) organization, was recently created to provide financial assistance and other support to LGBTQ+ athletes. McDermott-Mostowy was the first to get a check, after a November event in West Hollywood raised more than $15,000.\n\n“We’re here to help cover their costs because a lot of other people aren’t doing it,” said Cyd Zeigler, a founding board member of the group and co-founder of OutSports, a sports-news website focused on LGBTQ+ issues.\n\nThat kind of retrenching, from deep-pocketed corporate sponsors to individuals giving their spare change, is threatening to derail the careers of athletes  such as McDermott-Mostowy, who relies on his family and a modest U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Committee stipend for most of his living and training expenses. And since he’ll turn 27 before the Milano Cortina Olympic Games open in February, he may not be able to wait for the pendulum to swing back to have another chance at being an Olympian.\n\n“I’m 99% sure I qualify for [food] stamps,” said McDermott-Mostowy, who medaled in the 1,500- and 500-meter events in October’s national championships, making him a strong contender for the U.S. heading into the Olympic long track trials Jan. 2-5 in Milwaukee. “What really saves us every year is when we travel. Almost all of our expenses are paid when we’re coming [with] the team.\n\n“If I didn’t make the World Cup one year, I would be ruined.”\n\nMcDermott-Mostowy’s past success and his Olympic potential are what he pitches to sponsors, not that he’s gay. But that’s what makes him stand out; if he qualifies for Milano Cortina, he would be one of the few gay athletes on the U.S. team.\n\n“I have always been very open about my sexuality. So that wasn’t really a debate,” he said.\n\n“I have definitely heard from my agent that, behind closed doors, a lot of people are like ‘Oh, we’d love to support queer athletes. But it’s just not a good time to be having that as our public face.'”\n\nThe debate isn’t a new one, although it has evolved over the years. Figure skater Amber Glenn, who last year became the first out queer woman to win the U.S. championship, remembers gender preferences being a big topic of discussion ahead of the 2014 Games in Russia, where public support for LGBTQ+ expression is banned.\n\n“At that point I wasn’t out, but I was thinking, ‘What would I do? What would I say?’” Glenn said. “Moving forward I hope that we can make it where people can compete as who they are and not have to worry about anything.\n\n“Figure skating is unique. We have more acceptance and more of a community in the queer space. That’s not the case for all sports. We’re definitely making progress, but we still have a long way to go.”\n\nIn the meantime, athletes such as McDermott-Mostowy and Shumake may have to find ways to re-present themselves to find new sources of support.\n\n“It’s not like I’m going back in the closet,” said Shumake, who has decided to rent out his dragster to straight drivers next year rather than leave it parked and face bankruptcy. “It’s just that maybe it’s not the main storyline at the moment. I’m trying a bunch of different ways to tell the story, to rebrand.”\n\n“It’s been weird to watch,” added Shumake, who once billed himself as the fastest gay guy on Earth. “I know it will swing back. I also fear, did I make the right choices when I had a partnership with Grindr and I had rainbow parachutes? Like did I come on too strong?\n\n“I’ve chosen to go the gay race car driver route and it’s just a little bit of a slowdown. I don’t think I need to blame myself. It’s just a fear people are having at the moment.”\n\nA fear that’s proving costly to the athletes who can least afford to pay.\n\nGet the best, most interesting and strangest stories of the day from the L.A. sports scene and beyond from our newsletter The Sports Report.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "title": "Chinese billionaire who has fathered more than 100 children hopes to have dozens of U.S.-born boys to one day take over his business",
    "description": "Xu Bo, the founder of one of China’s largest mobile gaming companies, is looking to have “50 high-quality sons” in the U.S. to take over his billion-dollar empire.",
    "fullText": "Billionaires like Telegram founder Pavel Durov and Tesla CEO Elon Musk have fathered legions of children who are slated to inherit their empires. Now, an ultra-wealthy Chinese businessman is doing the same in the U.S., in hopes of producing around 20 U.S.-born children to inherit his video game fortune.\n\nXu Bo is the founder and chairman of Guangzhou Duoyi Network: one of China’s largest mobile gaming companies. Despite the 48-year-old entrepreneur growing his company in Guangzhou, he’s not looking to pass down his $1.1 billion fortune to a child born in his home country. A Wall Street Journal investigation into Xu’s surrogacy history in the U.S. found that the Chinese billionaire was seeking parental rights to at least four unborn children, and had previously fathered and was actively fathering at least eight more surrogacy kids. There could be dozens more.\n\nThe billionaire’s video game company had also reportedly stated that Xu has more than 100 children born through surrogates based in the U.S., according to WSJ reporting. He was allegedly seeking “50 high-quality sons,” according to accounts linked to Xu on Chinese microblogging website Weibo, and said that “having more children can solve all problems.” During a 2023 court hearing, Xu also said he hoped to have around 20 U.S.-born children to one day take over his business, according to WSJ. He also fantasized about his American kids marrying Musk’s children in the future. Last month, Xu’s ex-girlfriend also alleged that he had 300 children living around the world—a claim his company denied.\n\nXu’s Duoyi Network has since made a statement against the Journal, stating the publication had “deliberately confused the facts and fabricated false information,” and that only 12 of the alleged 100-plus children were born in the U.S.\n\nXu is among a growing number of ultra-rich men parenting dozens of children to shepherd their companies and expand their legacies. And just like Xu, the video game billionaire, Telegram founder Pavel Durvo has helped conceive over 100 babies across 12 countries.\n\nOfficially, the entrepreneur worth $14.2 billion has six “official” children with three different partners. In addition to this parentage, Durov has also been donating to a sperm clinic for the past 15 years, which told him has led to more than 100 pregnancies.\n\n“I wrote my will very recently,” Durov told French publication Le Point in an interview this June. “I make no difference between my children: There are those who were conceived naturally and those who come from my sperm donations. They are all my children and will all have the same rights! I don’t want them to tear each other apart after my death.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

    "title": "Major food chains are reinventing themselves. We ranked their efforts to see who's winning the Great Restaurant Reset.",
    "description": "Many restaurant chains have been undergoing rebranding efforts this year. Business Insider ranked each effort in order of effectiveness.",
    "fullText": "It has been a big year for rebranding efforts among major restaurant chains.\n\nAs consumer tastes change — with value and experiential dining increasingly at the forefront — restaurant brands are seizing the moment to reinvent themselves: launching new logos, upgrading locations, and exploring new strategies to win over customers.\n\nBusiness Insider ranked each effort based on available financial performance and commentary from branding experts. Here's which rebrand is winning the Great Restaurant Reset so far.\n\nCracker Barrel launched a $700 million \"strategic transformation\" plan in 2025 aimed at updating stores, menus, and improving the brand's relevance.\n\nHowever, financial results showed essentially flat revenue in 2025 — a third straight sluggish year.\n\nThe most visible part of the refresh — its logo and brand redesign — backfired badly, with intense backlash forcing them to scrap the new logo. Management in September projected an 8% traffic drop for Q1 FY 2026, tied to the controversy.\n\nStock for Cracker Barrel was down more than 52% this year.\n\nOver the past year, Pizza Hut has quietly rolled out a refreshed logo and shaken up its menu and value strategy, launching new deals and limited-time items (like budget-friendly personal-pizza options) designed to win back customers amid sagging same-store sales.\n\nYum! Brands, the parent company of Pizza Hut, is openly exploring a sale of all or part of the brand — that's about as loud a vote of \"this turnaround isn't working yet\" as it gets.\n\nUS same-store sales and system sales have been in negative territory, facing a 5% drop in both Q1 and Q2, a 7% decline in Q3 at US locations, and its operating profit was down 8% in Q3.\n\nStock for Yum, which also includes other fast food titans like Taco Bell and KFC, was up more than 15% year-to-date.\n\nParent company Bloomin' Brands announced in November a $75 million, multi-year turnaround plan for Outback Steakhouse, aimed at restoring the chain to its steakhouse roots by improving food quality, updating its restaurants and service, and refining the overall guest experience.\n\nAs its rebrand effort is in its earliest stages, as tracked by Business Insider, it hasn't had the same runway that other brands have. Still, the chain has been struggling for two years, with the recent quarter showing only flat comparable store sales growth.\n\nAs part of a cost-cutting overhaul, they have abruptly closed 21 restaurants, with more closures planned.\n\nThere is a clear, funded strategy and some sequential improvement, but the brand is still closing units and lagging key steakhouse competitors, so the revitalization isn't yet taking root.\n\nBloomin' Brands' stock was down more than 46% year-to-date.\n\nDespite its long run as a growth darling, Chipotle logged two straight quarters of negative same-store sales in 2025 (Q1 and Q2), followed by a flat outlook for the rest of the year.\n\nManagement is repositioning itself around chicken, tweaking menu innovation and marketing, and opening new units at a rapid pace — a pragmatic, multi-front effort to adapt to a changing market.\n\nSo far, this approach appears to be buying time, but it hasn't yet produced a dramatic rebound; instead, it seems more like an attempt at stabilization, setting the stage for a potential recovery if consumer traffic returns.\n\nChipotle stock is down more than 37% year-to-date.\n\nSince emerging from bankruptcy in late 2024 under its new private-equity-backed owner, RL Investor Holdings, and new CEO Damola Adamolekun, Red Lobster has launched a leaner, value-driven, and experience-focused turnaround.\n\nThe overhaul includes ditching the \"Endless Shrimp\" all-you-can-eat deal, simplifying the menu, reviving fan favorites (like hush puppies and popcorn shrimp), and adding new dishes — including their viral seafood boils — to appeal to younger diners.\n\nAs the only private company on the list, Red Lobster's financial situation is murkier than the others ranked by Business Insider.\n\nHowever, foot traffic data from Placer.ai shows that the company's restaurants in June began seeing consistently positive trends in the monthly average visits per location for the first time in over 18 months. And, although its financial performance is still below 2023 levels, Consumer Edge credit and debit card data indicate that Red Lobster posted sales growth of 20% in 2025 Q3, and its average transaction size increased by 10% year-over-year, far outpacing the 1% growth seen for the overall casual dining sector.\n\nMike Perry, the founder of the creative agency Tavern, which has worked on rebranding efforts with companies including Budweiser and Burger King, told Business Insider that Red Lobster's rebranding effort lands squarely in the middle range: not as catastrophic as Cracker Barrel, but not as innovative as others like Starbucks.\n\n\"I think so far they've played it safe, like 'we'll clean it up, we'll package it up and resell it,' which, frankly, it's private equity money anyway, so they're doing the PE playbook appropriately, and it'll work for them, but it's not going to have staying power. It's certainly not going to make you an icon,\" Perry said.\n\nKFC launched its Kentucky Fried Comeback campaign in mid-July, as sales in recent years have been weak enough that the legacy chicken chain has lost share to competitors like Raising Cane's and Wingstop.\n\nRecent quarters have shown US same-store sales down around 5%, which has dragged down parent company Yum's results. Globally, though, KFC has strung together 11 consecutive quarters of same-store sales growth, with about 8% systemwide sales growth internationally.\n\n\"The category remains fiercely competitive, and a true comeback will ultimately require more substantial enhancements to its menu, marketing, and real estate strategies,\" R.J. Hottovy, head of analytical research at the location intelligence and foot traffic data software firm, Placer.ai, told Business Insider when KFC's comeback campaign launched.\n\nFor now, the US rebrand is clearly not \"fixed,\" but internationally the brand refresh is working, and the marketing reboot is resonating — so it ranks slightly above the chains that are still sliding across the board.\n\nUnder its new leadership, Starbucks launched the \"Back to Starbucks\" plan in late 2024, focusing on re-centering the company on its core identity as a neighborhood coffeehouse rather than a discount-driven chain.\n\nThe plan was intended to deliver 7-9% comparable store sales growth; instead, same-store sales remain under pressure, and the most recent updates indicate flat US comparable store sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025, and a modest uptick globally, with CEO Brian Niccol acknowledging it as a slow and steady recovery.\n\nWhile foot traffic and comps are not roaring back like Chili's, you can see the reinvention beginning to stabilize Starbucks' business. The scale of investment and early green shoots justify calling the turnaround moderately effective — especially versus peers that are still in full decline.\n\nStarbucks' stock was down more than 7% year-to-date as of December 24.\n\nApplebee's has rolled out a renovation and modernization program called its \"Lookin' Good\" program — updating the menu, remodeling dining rooms to update décor, modernizing interior design, and streamlining kitchens for off-premises and delivery business.\n\nAfter two years of declining traffic, Applebee's delivered a 4.9% same-store sales increase in Q2 2025, driven primarily by traffic growth — the first traffic increase in roughly two years.\n\nDine Brands credits the improvement to menu innovation as well as well-messaged value. The company is now focusing on a 2025 plan that emphasizes marketing and remodels to reinforce its brand repositioning.\n\nThe re-emphasis on \"neighborhood\" value and refreshed menus is clearly translating into positive comps and traffic — a textbook sign of an effective revitalization taking hold.\n\nStock for Dine Brands Global, Applebee's' parent company, is up more than 8% year-to-date.\n\nChili's, with its newly simplified menu, streamlined operations, and restaurant refurbishment, has become a case study in turnaround success. Early quarters in 2025 showed 31% same-store sales growth, propelled by a nearly 21% increase in traffic.\n\nAnalysts have called it one of the best turnarounds \"of all time\" in the casual dining sector, crediting a multi-year strategy focused on simplifying the menu, sharpening value, and operational execution, rather than relying on flashy stunts.\n\n\"If you look at what Chili's has done, its last two years have been maybe the most extraordinary thing I've seen in the business in 20 years,\" Restaurant Business editor in chief Jonathan Maze told Business Insider.\n\nChili's is the clearest example where a planned revitalization has delivered outsize traffic and sales gains, shifted category share, and won over both guests and Wall Street. On a pure rebrand effectiveness basis, it's the standout winner in recent memory.\n\nStock for Chili's parent company, Brinker International, was up more than 14% year-to-date as of December 19.",

    "description": "Justin Pines, the CEO of the Jewish Broadcasting Service, initially took a \"safe\" career path in corporate law, before becoming a rabbi.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Justin Pines, 42, the CEO of the Jewish Broadcasting Service, who lives in New Jersey. His education and former and current employment have been verified by Business Insider. This piece has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI always wanted my job to involve sharing Jewish ideas with a large audience, but I also felt I needed a safety net. So, I took the \"safe\" career path of becoming a corporate attorney.\n\nAfter about three years as an attorney, I left law to train as a rabbi. It led to me becoming the director of character development at a Jewish middle school, which I did for three years between 2016 and 2019.\n\nI loved it, but I pivoted again at 40 when I realized how hard it was to support my family that way. Now, I'm the CEO of the Jewish Broadcasting Service, a role that enables me to do what I'd always hoped.\n\nWith all of these changes, I learned about how to find a job that's the perfect fit.\n\nWhen I was 13, around the time of my Bar Mitzvah, I became very taken with Judaism. I started observing Shabbat and became interested in learning more about the religion. The more involved I became, the happier I felt.\n\nTo try to bring Judaism to the world, ideally through making movies, I studied communications for my undergraduate degree.\n\nToward the end of my degree, which I started in 2001, making it in Hollywood felt overwhelming and unrealistic. So, I went to Harvard Law School, deferring for a year to study at a Jewish educational institution in Israel. People assured me law school would set me up for any job I wanted.\n\nI began the program in 2006 and remember thinking a 30-year-old legal case in one of my first criminal law classes felt a little empty in comparison to the 2,000-year-old texts I had been reading, which felt divine and inspired.\n\nOverall, though, studying for my JD law degree was great. It made my brain feel super sharp, I made some amazing friends, and it set me up well for my legal career.\n\nDuring the summer of 2008, the year before I graduated from Harvard, I interned at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison. The company was full of excellent, smart, and kind people, so I accepted a full-time position that would start after I graduated.\n\nFrom 2009, I spent two years on rotation across different corporate departments at the firm. I had the opportunity to work on interesting projects and do some impactful pro bono work.\n\nIn the short term, it was great: I worked hard and played hard, could afford my own apartment in New York City, and liked my colleagues. But, I struggled with my long-term prospects.\n\nAs is the case at many corporate law firms, everything felt like an emergency, and partners would often receive work at the worst possible times, like on Friday afternoons or right before Thanksgiving weekend. It became clear that's what would be waiting for me if I ever made partner.\n\nI also had questions over whether it was meaningful work or the type of job where, no matter how senior you are, you'd be at the whim of others. I thought it might be time for something new.\n\nIn my third year at the law firm, when I was 29, I considered my career options. I made a chart with a list of six potential industries, including venture capital, real estate, Jewish non-profits, and becoming a rabbi. I interviewed people in each career about what their job was like and listed the pros and cons.\n\nI decided that more than anything else, I wanted to learn about Judaism. I was already studying the Talmud — the central text of Rabbinic Judaism — multiple times a week on the way to work. But I felt that I couldn't leave my high-paying job in law to study for the pursuit of knowledge and nothing more. I concluded that I needed another piece of paper, in addition to my BA and JD, which led me to a three-year vocational course at rabbinical school.\n\nAt the time, I thought I could make do with the significant pay cut I'd take if I became a rabbi.\n\nShortly after I became a rabbi at 33 in 2016, I became the head of character development at a Jewish middle school in New York's Upper East Side.\n\nIn a perfect world, I'd teach kids about Judaism all day, every day, forever. It breaks my heart to say, but it's hard to support a family doing that, and I have a wife and children.\n\nI wish educators were paid better, so more people felt inspired to get into the field. I have the utmost respect for those making it work, because it was a struggle. Personally, I needed a shift.\n\nAfter three years in Jewish education, I went to work at a Jewish think tank. Through that job, I was a guest on the Jewish Broadcasting Service, a broadcast network available through US TV providers and streaming services. In late 2023, they told me they were looking for a new CEO.\n\nI had studied communications at college, I wanted to share Judaism far and wide, and I had corporate experience: it felt like the role was the perfect fusion of my skills and interests. I joined as CEO at the start of 2024, at age 40.\n\nAt JBS, we broadcast shows that feature rabbis, artists, writers, and academics of all political and religious persuasions.\n\nI have a show where I typically interview leading Jewish thinkers. I can hardly believe it's my job to sit with my heroes for an hour, asking them whatever I want. I'm constantly pinching myself.\n\nPeople often treat their careers as ladders to climb rather than journeys with a North Star and lots to learn along the way. There was certainly a version of my life where I chose to stay in a lucrative career, in which I could have drawn meaning from things outside of work, like family or my volleyball team.\n\nFor much of my career, the challenge was achieving a balance between finding meaning, but not only from my job, and financial stability while doing something I love, among other things.\n\nI think I have found balance now. I feel blessed to love what I'm doing.",

    "description": "Tahmina Watson's law firm assists with employment visas. She advises all visa holders with a valid stamp to return to the US immediately.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Tahmina Watson, a business immigration lawyer in Seattle. Business Insider has verified Watson's employment history with documentation. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI'm a business immigration lawyer, and in my day-to-day work with clients, I'm seeing immigration disruptions with immediate consequences, including H-1B visa holders who are outside the US being uncertain if they can return.\n\n​​My law firm, Watson Immigration Law, assists founders and businesses in navigating the employment visa application process. It appears that, at this time, the administration is coordinating the rescheduling and delay of immigration appointments.\n\nNon-immigrant visas generally must be scheduled at a US embassy or consulate in the person's country of nationality or residence. From my experience, many employees accrue their holiday time and schedule immigration appointments during this period because they're already planning to leave the country, allowing them to easily visit their designated US embassy or consulate.\n\nThese employees are now getting stuck, having already left the US, with their appointments getting rescheduled for June, July, or August 2026, and beyond.\n\nMajor tech companies, including Google, Apple, and Microsoft, sent memos out to their employees in the past week, warning visa-holding employees to avoid international travel amid long delays at US consulates. These policies are coming one after another, and they all intersect with each other.\n\nIf somebody is outside the country, what are employers supposed to do? Right now, my advice to clients outside the country is that if they have a valid visa stamp, they should return to the US as soon as possible.\n\nFor someone who has left the country to obtain a new visa stamp, I'm not sure there's a clear path to return. This includes individuals on F-1 student visas who traveled to visit family and were planning to re-enter the US. They will need that visa stamp from a consulate.\n\nEnsure your employment is still active and consider whether remote work is an option. If an employer decides they cannot keep someone on the books, even an appointment months from now will not help if there's no job waiting.\n\nIt's tough to know how things will unfold. What we're seeing is a confluence of policies coming in at the same time. For example, the Department of Homeland Security has just announced that it is replacing the lottery system for H-1B work visas, which randomly selects who receives a visa. The system is now set to prioritize higher-paid, higher-skilled workers.\n\nSocial media disclosure is being expanded from F-1 visa holders, which began during the student visa crisis, to now include H-1B workers. These applicants are required to change all social media privacy settings to public.\n\nIt could easily expand to other visa categories. The government has not provided clear guidance on what they are reviewing. By casting an overly broad net under the banner of national security, without clear standards or transparency, the administration is creating uncertainty that will ripple across families, employers, and the US economy.\n\nClients should limit what they post online.\n\nIn 2024, I was already anticipating these issues with traveling and returning to the US. We've also seen issues affecting green card holders with past criminal convictions.\n\nThere are many stories of people who have lived in the US for decades, suddenly facing deportation proceedings. This is a highly precarious time for immigrants, and limiting travel is critical.\n\nIt feels like a fire hose of policies. Everyone in the immigrant ecosystem is on high alert: Immigration lawyers, immigrants, employers, investors, founders, and employees.",

    "description": "Larry and David Ellison didn’t always have a close relationship. Now they’re one of the most intriguing partnerships in business.",
    "fullText": "Theodore Schleifer writes about billionaires in America.\n\nWhen David Ellison became a teenager, his father, Larry, bought him a gift not usually bestowed on a 13th birthday: his own Katana stunt plane. The two had spent little meaningful time together. But with their own aircraft, the father and son could bond in the air, practicing aerobatic flips and ruling the skies together.\n\nNow, Larry Ellison is trying to help buy his son a media empire so they can rule Hollywood and news together.\n\nWhat was once a relatively weak father-and-son relationship has transformed into one of modern media’s most intriguing business partnerships. Towering behind almost every move made by David Ellison, now 42 and the chief executive of Paramount, is his swaggering 81-year-old father, the billionaire co-founder of the software giant Oracle.\n\nThe two have formed an unusual tag team in their pursuit of major media deals, according to more than two dozen people with knowledge of their interactions. They bought Paramount this summer, and now they are hunting Warner Bros. Discovery with a $108 billion hostile bid.\n\nOn Monday, David Ellison made it clearer than ever that his father is the centerpiece of this bid, telling Warner Bros. that Larry Ellison personally guaranteed $40.4 billion for Paramount’s offer. David Ellison has referred to the deal as something “we” — or “the Ellison family” — were pursuing. Both have sought to arm-twist Warner executives.\n\nFather and son speak about five times a week — sometimes about their tennis matches or their joint philanthropy at the University of Oxford. But these days, often the topic is deal-making. David Ellison consults his father at length on every deal-related decision, one person with knowledge of their interactions said.\n\nThey discuss how to navigate President Trump, whose administration must approve any major acquisition. Larry Ellison has taken the lead in making the case to the president for why Paramount and not Netflix, its rival bidder, should win control of Warner Bros., two of the people said. Mr. Trump has pledged to be “involved” in any decision about whether to approve a deal.\n\nA Silicon Valley celebrity for decades, Mr. Ellison co-founded Oracle five decades ago and turned it into a $252 billion personal fortune. He has been deferential to his son on this year’s deal talks, a person close to the process said.\n\nWhen talking about the hostile bid for Warner Bros., he has often referred to his history of hostile acquisitions during the 1990s and 2000s, two people with knowledge of the discussions said. His son, who interned at Oracle for two summers during that time, watched him work through some deals, the people said.\n\nIf the Ellisons prevail, their business empire could range from CNN to Warner Bros. to TikTok. That could have enormous consequences for the news and entertainment industries, perhaps making the Ellisons as influential as the Murdochs, whose media dynasty operates Fox News, The Wall Street Journal and other major outlets.\n\nMr. Trump has privately said Larry Ellison assured him that he would turn CBS News, which the Ellisons took over when they bought Paramount, into a more conservative outlet, two people with knowledge of the president’s comments said.\n\nOn Sunday night, a “60 Minutes” correspondent accused David Ellison’s handpicked editor in chief of CBS News, Bari Weiss, of making a “political” decision to hold a story about Venezuelan men deported by the Trump administration. Ms. Weiss told colleagues on a call on Monday that she had held the segment because it “wasn’t ready.”\n\nDavid Ellison, born in 1983, was largely raised in Woodside, a town in Silicon Valley, by his father’s third wife, Barbara. She and Larry Ellison maintained a warm relationship after their divorce in 1986, several people close to the family say, but he was not a day-to-day presence in his son’s life. Oracle colleagues did not hear him talk often about David, who, when he was 23, said there had been “gaps” in their relationship growing up.\n\nIt wasn’t until the two began taking flight lessons together that they grew close. “I’m afraid I must have passed on the risk-taking gene,” Larry Ellison said about their shared daredevil interest in 2006.\n\nDavid Ellison dropped out of the University of Southern California’s film school and started an acting career. His father heavily financed his first major movie as an actor, “Flyboys,” which was widely considered a flop.\n\nLarry Ellison was relieved when his son left acting and entered the business side of entertainment, two people said. Their relationship grew warmer as David Ellison achieved professional success, they said. Larry Ellison has always considered himself wise about Hollywood, and one of his best friends, Steve Jobs, mentored the son about the business as well.\n\nLarry Ellison was initially skeptical of Skydance, the Hollywood company that his son started and that bought Paramount. But he has told friends in recent years that he considers his son to be one of the smartest people in the business world, trusts his judgment and tends to agree with him on corporate matters, several people with knowledge of the Ellisons said.\n\n“Larry is one of the smartest people I’ve ever met, but I honestly think David may be even smarter,” said Marc Benioff, the chief executive of Salesforce and a mentee of Larry Ellison who said he had known David since he was 3.\n\nIn recent years, Larry Ellison has invited his close circle of friends to join his son for Saturday dinners at his beachside spread on Carbon Beach in Malibu, Calif., often followed by a movie, a person with knowledge of the activities said. And David Ellison, in turn, has sought out personal and medical advice from his father, who considers himself knowledgeable about health care. A few years ago, he called his father for help on how to handle a friend’s medical emergency during a tennis match, people with knowledge of the incident recalled.\n\nLarry Ellison mostly stayed behind the scenes at Skydance. He invested an undisclosed amount in the company as early as 2006, his son has said, and even more during a $150 million fund-raising round in 2010 that made him the largest shareholder.\n\n“He gave me an incredible opportunity by believing in me in the beginning,” David Ellison said in an interview in 2022. “I could not be more grateful for that. And we definitely talk about work constantly and work together constantly.”\n\nToday, Paramount’s board — David Ellison’s bosses — includes the head of his family office, Paul Marinelli, and Oracle’s former chief executive Safra Catz.\n\nLarry Ellison’s experiences with the press have had him, too, thinking about the news business. He was often frustrated by what he saw as sensationalized coverage about him and his personal life, several people close to him said. He only really respected publications like The Financial Times or The Economist. (Oracle often advertised on the back page of The Economist.) In more recent years, he became more antagonistic about the press.\n\nHis son appears to share some of those same feelings. He has told people privately that CBS News could improve its finances if it was perceived as less liberal. He hired Ms. Weiss, the founder of The Free Press, an upstart digital news site, and a regular critic of traditional news organizations, to lead CBS News.\n\nThose criticisms of CBS News also line up with those lodged by Mr. Trump, who has forged a close relationship with Larry Ellison. Mr. Ellison was once a stalwart Clinton-era Democrat, but he has gravitated toward Mr. Trump in large part because of the president’s support for Israel, several people who have spoken to him said. (Both Ellisons are close to Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister of Israel, who one associate described as like an uncle figure to David Ellison.)\n\nDavid Ellison is still leaning hard on his father to help him with Mr. Trump, who could spoil his father’s generosity.\n\nMr. Trump and Larry Ellison speak frequently, people close to Mr. Trump and Mr. Ellison’s operations said. Mr. Ellison has been frustrated at times this year by Mr. Trump’s trade policies, but in recent conversations with the president he has been obsequious, one of the people said.\n\nA White House official said Mr. Trump’s conversations with Mr. Ellison were being mischaracterized. The official declined to be named or elaborate.\n\nThe Paramount deal team only occasionally discusses how to take advantage of the relationship with Mr. Trump, according to a person close to Larry Ellison. But Larry spoke to the president about Warner Bros. Discovery after Netflix announced its deal to buy the company, according to a White House official and a person close to Mr. Trump.\n\nSo far, though, the efforts by the father and son do not necessarily seem to be having the desired effect.\n\n“For those people that think I am close with the new owners of CBS, please understand that 60 Minutes has treated me far worse since the so-called “takeover,” than they have ever treated me before,” Mr. Trump wrote on social media last week. “If they are friends, I’d hate to see my enemies!”\n\nTyler Pager contributed reporting.",

    "title": "Taiwan is getting plenty of missiles and drones from the US. A top business leader says the arsenal is out of balance.",
    "description": "Recent US weapons packages to Taiwan have largely been asymmetric capabilities, but Taiwan needs more advanced systems as well, an official said.",
    "fullText": "The US has sent Taiwan a growing number of asymmetric weapons intended to help deter and defeat a potential Chinese invasion.\n\nTaiwan needs a more balanced arsenal of systems to counter other conflict scenarios, such as a sustained blockade, the president of the US-Taiwan Business Council recently argued.\n\nAsymmetric warfare, which relies on large numbers of relatively inexpensive, mobile, and difficult-to-target systems like drones, missiles, and dispersed units, offers Taiwan an advantage against the military might of China.\n\nBut more conventional capabilities, such as those needed to sustain operations, defend sea lanes, and maintain air and missile defense over time, are still necessary should China attempt to blockade the island. In recent years, US military support has skewed away from those needs.\n\nAt a Hudson Institute think tank event earlier this month, Rupert Hammond-Chambers, the president of the US-Taiwan Business Council, described the state of US military aid to Taiwan as out of balance.\n\nHammond-Chambers said that US arms sales have \"swung from one extreme\" — the weapons deals years ago for MQ-9 Reaper drones, M1A2 Abrams tanks, and F-16 Fighting Falcon fighter jets — \"to the other extreme where we're only doing asymmetric,\" a shift he warned leaves potential vulnerabilities.\n\nOver the last five years, the US has sold and delivered large quantities of missiles, drones, command-and-control upgrades, ammunition, software, and spare parts, marking a shift away from the higher-profile platforms like tanks and fighter jets.\n\nUS officials have argued that survivable, distributed, and networked systems are better suited to helping Taiwan counter China's daily gray-zone pressure, as well as complicating Beijing's plans in a crisis or blockade.\n\nTaiwan's focus has been on building a network of asymmetric capabilities to deter and defend against a full-scale invasion, what some have referred to as a \"D-Day scenario.\"\n\nHammond-Chambers said military support and sales have been aligned with countering that, \"but we are not doing every day, and there needs to be a swing back and more of a balance.\"\n\nJust this month, the US announced a massive $11 billion arms sale to Taiwan that included High-Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, Army Tactical Missile Systems, Javelin missiles, howitzers, and drones. Many of those systems are designed to be mobile, dispersed, and survivable, reinforcing Washington's emphasis on asymmetric and precision-strike capabilities.\n\nTaiwan's defense ministry said the US \"continues to assist Taiwan in maintaining sufficient self-defense capabilities and in rapidly building strong deterrent power and leveraging asymmetric warfare advantages, which form the foundation for maintaining regional peace and stability.\"\n\nTaiwan's government has also proposed billions of dollars in supplemental funding for asymmetric capabilities and an island-wide air defense system called Taiwan Dome or T-Dome.\n\nTaiwan's domestic investment in these weapons raises a key question: \"Will American security assistance adjust given that Taiwan is putting an enormous amount of money further down for this so-called asymmetric approach and allow for consideration of other platforms and systems?\" Hammond-Chambers said.\n\nOne of the most complicated challenges facing Taiwan is how it can develop and stockpile its own weapons systems should a blockade prevent assistance from the US and other allies and partners. The simple answer, retired admiral and former chief of the general staff for Taiwan's defense ministry Lee Hsi-Min said at the event, is to make weapons at scale on the island, rather than relying primarily on co-production or foreign supply.\n\nExperts and officials have long pointed to the need for a stronger local defense supply chain, including spare parts, munitions, and sustainment capabilities, so that Taiwan can remain operational if outside support is delayed or disrupted.\n\nWhile Taiwan's domestic defense industry can continue to develop its own weapons, \"the fastest way to production is to license American and Ukrainian and European designs and to produce on island,\" Betsy Shieh, former senior commercial officer with the US Department of Commerce, said at the event.\n\nThat approach, while not without political and logistical hurdles, could allow Taiwan to scale production more quickly. Taiwanese companies will learn to innovate as that goes on, she said, \"but the short term is license, license, license, build on island.\"\n\nTaiwan's government budgets for defense have increased substantially, and it continues to assess what types of weapons and capabilities are most needed for the different ways China could attempt to seize the island.\n\nAt this moment, some of its domestic companies have been going all-in on drone production, and a government-created national drone team is focused on bringing together firms from across Taiwan's industrial base to help build those systems at scale, but more engagement may be necessary to realize its potential.",

    "title": "The AI bubble debate: 17 business leaders, from Sam Altman to Bill Gates to Peter Thiel, weigh in",
    "description": "OpenAI's Sam Altman sparked fears of an AI bubble. Business leaders like Bill Gates, Mark Cuban, and Jensen Huang disagree over whether one exists.",
    "fullText": "The AI boom shows no sign of slowing down. Some top business leaders are concerned that a bubble is about to burst.\n\nIn August, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman gave voice to those fears about the future of AI. Since then, other CEOs, including Nvidia's Jensen Huang, have dismissed concerns of an AI bubble. Wall Street is also worried about the increasing circular nature of Big Tech's spending spree.\n\nHere's what leading tech CEOs and business leaders are saying about what's ahead.\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that the AI market is in a bubble.\n\n\"When bubbles happen, smart people get overexcited about a kernel of truth,\" Altman recently told reporters, per The Verge.\n\nAltman said this describes the state of play.\n\n\"Are we in a phase where investors as a whole are overexcited about AI? My opinion is yes. Is AI the most important thing to happen in a very long time? My opinion is also yes,\" he said.\n\nMicrosoft cofounder Bill Gates says AI is in a bubble — just not to the extent of Danish tulips.\n\n\"The value is extremely high, just like creating the internet ended up being, in net, very valuable,\" Gates told CNBC in late October. \"But you have a frenzy. And some of these companies will be glad they spent all this money. Some of them, you know, they'll commit to data centers whose electricity is too expensive.\"\n\nGates said that the situation reminds him of dot-com bubble when overvalued internet companies sparked a crash.\n\n\"Absolutely, there are a ton of these investments that will be dead ends,\" he said.\n\nStill, the billionaire said that AI remains a major breakthrough, calling it \"the biggest technical thing ever in my lifetime.\"\n\nMark Cuban, who famously sold Broadcast.com just before the dot-com bubble burst, said he doesn't see similarities to the current situation.\n\n\"There were people creating companies with just a website and going public. That's a bubble where there's no intrinsic value at all,\" Cuban told podcaster Lex Fridman in 2024. '\"People aren't even trying to make operating cap profits, they're just trying to leverage the frothiness of the stock market, that's a bubble. You don't see that right now. \"\n\nCuban took particular notice of the quality of AI companies going public.\n\n\"We're not seeing funky AI companies just go public,\" he said. \"If all of a sudden we see a rush of companies who are skins on other people's models or just creating models to create models that are going public, then yeah, that's probably the start of a bubble.\"\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said AI could become a bubble, but there will only be a crash if companies fail to keep making advancements.\n\n\"If the models keep on growing in capability year-over-year and demand keeps growing, then maybe there is no collapse,\" Zuckerberg told the \"Access\" podcast in September.\n\nZuckerberg said there are risks that the AI boom becomes like the dot-com bubble.\n\n\"There's definitely a possibility, at least empirically, based on past large infrastructure buildouts and how they led to bubbles, that something like that would happen here.\"\n\nFor Meta, Zuckerberg said the real risk is not spending enough.\n\n\"The risk, at least for a company like Meta, is probably in not being aggressive enough rather than being somewhat too aggressive,\" he said.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang doesn't see a bubble.\n\n\"I don't believe we're in an AI bubble,\" Huang told Bloomberg TV.\n\nHuang said that instead of overspeculation, AI is part of a transition from an old way of computing.\n\n\"We're going through a natural transition from an old computing model based on general purpose computing to accelerated computing,\" he said. \"We also know that AI has become good enough because of reasoning capability, and research capability, its ability to think — it's now generating tokens and intelligence that is worth paying for.\"\n\nNvidia is skyrocketing amid AI-fueled hope. In late October, the chipmaker became the world's first $5 trillion market cap company.\n\nHuang said Nvidia is happy to pay for AI for its employees, name-checking Cursor, an AI coding agent, as one of many services for which his company pays.\n\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai said there is some \"irrationality\" in the AI boom. He also cautioned that if a bubble were to burst, its blast radius would extend across the private sector.\n\n\"I think no company is going to be immune, including us,\" Pichai told the BBC in November.\n\nComparing the current moment to the Dotcom era, Pichai said that sometimes investment cycles can \"overshoot.\"\n\n\"I expect AI to be the same,\" he said. \"So I think it's both rational and there are elements of irrationality through a moment like this.\"\n\nAmazon founder Jeff Bezos says AI is in a bubble, but not in the way everyone might think.\n\nBezos called the current situation an \"industrial bubble.\" The world's third-richest person said there are similarities now, including the frenzy of investments.\n\n\"The good ideas and the bad ideas. And investors have a hard time in the middle of this excitement, distinguishing between the good ideas and the bad ideas,\" he said in October during a conference in Italy. \"And that's also probably happening today.\"\n\nBezos said that hoopla shouldn't overshadow the reality that \"AI is real\" and will change society.\n\n\"The [bubbles] that are industrial are not nearly as bad,\" Bezos said. \"It can even be good, because when the dust settles and you see who are the winners. Societies benefit from those inventions.\"\n\nJPMorgan Vice Chairman Daniel Pinto said he sees a correction coming.\n\n\"There is probably a correction there,\" Pinto said at a Bloomberg event in November.\n\nPinto said the market is pushing valuations beyond current justifications.\n\n\"In order to justify these valuations, you are considering a level of productivity that, it will happen, but it may not happen as fast as the market is pricing now,\" he said.\n\nLike Altman, OpenAI chairman Bret Taylor says we're in an AI bubble.\n\n\"I think it is both true that AI will transform the economy, and I think it will, like the internet, create huge amounts of economic value in the future,\" Taylor told The Verge in September. \"I think we're also in a bubble, and a lot of people will lose a lot of money.\"\n\nTaylor, who is also CEO of Sierra, also sees some similarities to the dot-com bubble. He also said that some of the internet companies that failed in the 90s were just ahead of their time.\n\n\"Even things like Webvan, there's now, as the internet became more distributed, really healthy businesses like Instacart and DoorDash and others that were built now that the smartphone and the scale of the internet has matured,\" he said. \"So even some of the specific ideas were actually not that bad, but maybe a little early.\"\n\nFormer Google CEO Eric Schmidt said just because it looks like a bubble doesn't mean that it is.\n\n\"I think it's unlikely, based on my experience, that this is a bubble,\" Schmidt said in July during an appearance at the RAISE Summit in Paris. \"It's much more likely that you're seeing a whole new industrial structure.\"\n\nSchmidt said it takes solace in where the hardware and chips markets stand.\n\n\"You have these massive data centers, and Nvidia is quite happy to sell them all the chips,\" he said. \"I've never seen a situation where hardware capacity was not taken up by software.\"\n\nFormer Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger says AI is in a bubble, but it won't pop for \"several years.\"\n\n\"Are we in an AI bubble? Of course. Of course we are,\" Gelsinger told CNBC in October. \"I mean, we're hyped. We're accelerating. We're putting enormous leverage into the system.\"\n\nGelsinger said that businesses are just beginning to reap the benefits of AI.\n\n\"As Jensen (Huang) talked about, and I agree with this, you know that businesses are yet to really start materially benefiting from it,\" he said. \"We're displacing all of the internet and the service provider industry as we think about it today — we have a long way to go.\"\n\nAlibaba cofounder Joe Tsai has voiced concerns about the scramble for data centers needed to help power the next generation of AI models.\n\n\"I start to see the beginning of some kind of bubble,\" Tsai told the HSBC Global Investment Summit in March, Bloomberg News reported.\n\nTsai said he's worried the building rush might outpace demand.\n\n\"I start to get worried when people are building data centers on spec,\" he said. \"There are a number of people coming up, funds coming out, to raise billions or millions of capital.\"\n\nHedge fund icon Ray Dalio voiced concerns about a bubble earlier this year, when DeepSeek's rollout led analysts to rethink AI's outlook.\n\n\"Where we are in the cycle right now is very similar to where we were between 1998 or 1999,\" Dalio told the Financial Times in January. \"There's a major new technology that certainly will change the world and be successful. But some people are confusing that with the investments being successful.\"\n\nAt the time, Dalio cited high stock prices and high interest rates. The good news is that Wall Street widely expects the Federal Reserve to cut rates during its September meeting.\n\nBillionaire tech CEO Thomas Siebel said there is \"absolutely\" an AI bubble and that it's \"huge.\"\n\n\"So we have this similar thing going on with generative AI that we've seen with previous technologies,\" Siebel told Fortune in January. \"The market is way, way overvaluing.\"\n\nSiebel, who leads C3.ai, singled out OpenAI in terms of overevaluations.\n\n\"If it disappeared, it wouldn't make any difference in the world,\" he said. \"Nothing would change. I mean, nobody's life would change. No company would change. Microsoft would find something else to power Copilot. There's like 10 other products available that would do it equally as good.\"\n\nAMD CEO Lisa Su says the bubble talk \"is completely wrong.\"\n\n\"For those who are talking about a 'bubble,' I think they're being too narrow in their thinking of, what is the return on investment today or over the next six months,\" Su told Time Magazine in 2024. \"I think you have to look at this technology arc for AI over the next five years, and how does it fundamentally change everything that we do? And I really believe that AI has that potential.\"\n\nNicolai Tangen, who runs the world's biggest sovereign wealth fund, said if AI is a bubble, \"it may not be such a bad bubble.\"\n\nSpeaking to the Financial Times in November, the CEO of Norway's $2 trillion sovereign wealth fund said that AI is a \"pretty hot space\" right now, fueled by hype and a wave of capital. As the technology marks a sweeping societal shift, traditional valuations can be difficult to determine.\n\nTangen said overvaluation isn't entirely negative. The sheer volume of capital rushing into AI will ultimately fund technologies that boost long-term productivity — from automation to data processing to new types of AI models.\n\nThe hard part for investors is telling real breakthroughs apart from noise in a landscape still dominated by a few powerful platform companies, he added.\n\nPeter Thiel, the billionaire venture capitalist who cofounded PayPal, indicated recently that he's skeptical of the notion of an AI bubble.\n\n\"My macroeconomic placeholder is that it's going to keep going,\" Thiel said in a December interview with The Spectator, referring to the economic growth driven by the technology.\n\nThiel also said that he's been asked about an AI bubble frequently by people in Europe, which is \"how you know that they're not going to build a lot of AI in Europe.\"\n\n\"There is no other vector of growth in our society, we would be out of our minds not to take it,\" Thiel said. \"I don't think it's big enough to solve the budget deficit, but if the US embraces AI and Europe rejects it, I think the US is in somewhat better shape than Europe is.\"\n\nDespite his projections of future growth, Thiel also said that there are \"all sorts of things that I don't particularly like about the AI revolution,\" including that it's concentrated in a handful of large companies and that AI is \"probably more of a substitute than a complement\" to human labor.\n\n\"It will have a zero-sum feel to a lot of people,\" Thiel said.",

    "description": "Roma ramp up January business as talks progress for Joshua Zirkzee and Giacomo Raspadori to bolster Gasperini’s attack.",
    "fullText": "The holiday season is in full swing, and while Serie A may be pausing for a few days, the transfer rumor mill is raging on unabated. Although a few new names have been added to the mix, the Italian press continues to focus on Roma’s pursuit of Manchester United forward Joshua Zirkzee and Atletico Madrid midfielder Giacomo Raspadori.\n\nWhile they bring different traits to the table, Zirkzee and Raspadori have followed similar career arcs, parlaying success in Italy into megamillion moves to larger European clubs. However, with only 586 combined league minutes between them, life outside of Italy hasn’t been kind to these former Serie A standouts.\n\nFortunately, there may be hope on the horizon for these two talented attackers in the form of a curmudgeonly calcio genius. According to multiple sources in Italy, Gian Piero Gasperini has identified Zirkzee and Raspadori as the ideal salves for his wounded attack.\n\nRecent reports from Italy indicate that Roma will acquire both players on loan with options to buy (€40M for Zirkzee, €18M for Raspadori) that become obligations if certain objectives are met, including the club qualifying for the Champions League next season. This would represent a significant investment for the club and may require the corresponding sales or loan cancellations of players like Evan Ferguson, Leon Bailey, and Artem Dovbyk.\n\nThis is all speculation, of course, but the depth and breadth of these rumors suggest that Roma and Gasperini have clearly established priorities for the January transfer market. All that remains is to push the deals over the finish line, which is no easy feat with this many moving pieces.",

    "fullText": "Managing a business is challenging, even in the best circumstances. In today's uncertain economy, marked by slowing consumer spending and shifting retail habits, it becomes even tougher.\n\nFor one retail chain, the difficulty has been compounded by years of financial strain, two Chapter 11 bankruptcies, and hundreds of store closures nationwide.\n\nOnce an iconic mall staple known for its affordable jewelry, colorful hair accessories, and quirky novelties, Claire's is again facing serious financial setbacks. A new revelation has raised doubts about the long-term survival of the 64-year-old brand, which once played a significant role in the lives of countless teens and tweens.\n\nAs it works to emerge from its second bankruptcy under new ownership by the private equity firm Ames Watson, Claire's is confronting additional pressures from its supply chain. Several Asian suppliers allege they are owed millions of dollars in unpaid debts, according to claims filed in Hong Kong and reported by CNBC.\n\nThe disputed orders were for holiday merchandise placed before Claire's second bankruptcy filing, when Elliott Management still owned the company. Suppliers were reportedly aware of the retailer's financial instability at the time the orders were made. However, by the time production was completed, Claire's had already filed for bankruptcy.\n\nAfter Ames Watson acquired the brand, some suppliers claimed they were still owed payment, but agreed to continue doing business with Claire's. Others chose to pursue legal action against Claire's Hong Kong-based sourcing office, RSI International.\n\nAs a major American retail chain, Claire's is a prominent customer for many of these Asian suppliers. This is why, despite outstanding balances, several vendors continued to fulfill orders out of fear that refusing to do so could jeopardize their business relationship with the retailer.\n\nDuring its latest acquisition process, RSI International notified creditors that they had 30 days to file claims to recover unpaid debts, liabilities that under Hong Kong Law do not transfer to new owners.\n\nIn a statement to CNBC, Ames Watson emphasized it was \"not involved in the operation or purchasing decisions made prior to the acquisition.\"\n\n\"Since then, we have focused on responsibly stewarding the business and engaging suppliers in good faith as we strengthen Claire's for the long term,\" said Ames Watson. \"We are excited about the company’s direction in 2026.\"\n\nClaire's first filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2018, emerging later that year under the new ownership of Elliott Management Corp. and Monarch Alternative Capital.",

    "description": "Cassi Zheng spent her 30th birthday alone in Tokyo. It gave her a chance to stop focusing on what was missing.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Cassi Zheng, 31, the founder of Aurawell, an aromatherapy brand. Her words have been edited for length and clarity.\n\nAs a brand director at a sports-drink startup in Shanghai, I spoke to more than 30 people a day — from members of the sports community to suppliers and colleagues seeking sign-offs.\n\nI was drained. I felt chronic pain, constant fatigue, and even had panic attacks.\n\nIn February 2023, at 29, I quit. I wanted to head into my 30s with a clearer sense of purpose. I didn't tell my parents, but my friends and colleagues were supportive.\n\nSuddenly, I had nothing to do, and that early idleness felt panic-inducing. I was so used to running around, talking to people, and being needed. I felt completely lost for a few days.\n\nThen I started trying different things. I biked across the city from one end to the other, covering more than 10 kilometers. Another time, I biked 30 kilometers just to go kayaking.\n\nI felt exhausted, but also energized.\n\nI spent the first year traveling across Asia. Because I'd been practicing Reiki, Japan felt like a natural first stop.\n\nOn a trip to Tokyo and Kyoto with friends, temples and traditional inns sparked something within me. I knew I wanted to go back again on my own.\n\nI kept moving. Bangkok's flea markets and Chinatown reminded me of Guangzhou, where I grew up, in the '90s.\n\nIn South Korea, I rang in the new year on Jeju Island with old friends, racing to find a taxi minutes before midnight.\n\nOn New Year's Day, I flew to Kyoto for my first true solo trip. I'd lived on my own before — college and grad school in the US, travel through Mexico, Kenya, Nepal — but Japan felt different. It was the perfect place to be an introvert.\n\nI spent my birthday alone in Tokyo, sick with the flu, wandering the Nezu Museum's gardens. The quiet design reminded me to notice what's present, instead of what's missing.\n\nI returned to Japan twice more that year, spending days meditating alone in the mountains.\n\nA year and a half after quitting, I spent three weeks in Europe. On a hike in Sicily, I met a man climbing beside me. He spoke Italian, I spoke English, but we managed. He told me his father had paved the mountain road. Afterward, I visited his café.\n\nSicily felt open and passionate — a contrast to Shanghai's intensity.\n\nI began crying without knowing why and felt ashamed. I tried to step away, but the teacher told me I didn't need to hide. With an East Asian upbringing, that was incredibly freeing. I cried for two days, overwhelmed by release.\n\nI'd long relied on external validation from bosses, parents, and goal-driven metrics. My gap year loosened that grip. I could count the trips or the solo days, but none of that defines me.\n\nOn my 30th birthday, I finally told my parents about my gap year and the aromatherapy brand I was starting with a friend. They were shocked — it was far outside their comfort zone — but showing them my business plan and prototypes helped. Even now, when I visit them a few hours outside Shanghai, they enjoy talking about metrics and the future of my company.\n\nMy friend and I launched Aurawell in May 2024, just over a year after I left my job. I first got the word out by leading a public meditation in an underground performance space.\n\nTaking a gap year was one of the wisest decisions I've made. It gave me time to slow down, reflect on my choices, and discover what I actually enjoy, without pressure from the outside world.\n\nDo you have a story about taking a gap year that you want to share?

    "title": "The Atlanta Braves have done a lot this offseason — have they done enough to bounce back in 2026?",
    "description": "With Opening Day three months away, the Braves seem pretty much finished with offseason business.",
    "fullText": "For the Atlanta Braves, 2025 was an avalanche of disappointment.\n\nEntering the season on a seven-year postseason streak, the Braves were considered championship contenders, the National League’s best chance at unseating the juggernaut Dodgers. With a strong core of experienced position players, the NL’s reigning Cy Young in Chris Sale and a pair of superstars coming back from injury in Ronald Acuña Jr. and Spencer Strider, Atlanta began the season with 93.4% playoff odds, according to FanGraphs.\n\nInstead, a depleted, injury-plagued Braves club trudged to a shocking 76-86 record and a fourth-place finish in a down NL East.\n\nThankfully, the autopsy is pretty straightforward. Sale and key rotation piece Spencer Schwellenbach both spent long stretches on the IL. The same was true for third baseman Austin Riley, who underperformed when available. Strider looked rusty and out of sync upon his return from Tommy John. Stalwarts such as Ozzie Albies, Michael Harris II, Marcel Ozuna and Sean Murphy all struggled offensively. The emergence of NL Rookie of the Year Drake Baldwin was an invigorating development, but it wasn’t enough to overcome the simple fact that too many important players spent too much time watching baseball instead of playing it.\n\nBut the future, at Truist Park, is not lost.\n\nBecause as disappointing as last season was for Atlanta, the club’s front office has conducted business this winter like a team fully expecting to contend in 2026. President of baseball operations Alex Anthopoulos is clearly treating 2025 as a blip, an aberration, a fluke. With the new year still a week away, Atlanta’s head honcho has arguably done more to reinforce his roster than any other exec.\n\nThe Braves have signed six MLB free agents, a tally that ranks second so far this offseason behind the Cubs. To that sextet, Atlanta has guaranteed more than $106 million, the fifth-largest outlay as of Tuesday. The spending itself is not particularly shocking — the Braves have always run a top-10 payroll under Anthopoulos — but the team’s unflinching aggression is a reminder that the Braves are still a formidable presence in the National League.\n\nTo be fair, none of Atlanta’s additions was significant enough to warrant an in-person, jersey-unveiling press conference. But the Braves are undoubtedly a better, more complete and deeper team now than they were two months ago.\n\n[Get more Atlanta news: Braves team feed]\n\nFormer Padres closer Robert Suárez was probably the newsiest acquisition, with the soon-to-be 35-year-old flamethrower joining on a three-year, $45 million contract. It’s a long commitment for a reliever approaching his baseball golden years, but Suárez still throws absolute gas and has been one of the league’s most reliable closers over the past few years. His 76 saves since the start of 2024 are the most in baseball.\n\nBut don’t expect that number to rise much higher, as Suárez won’t begin the year as Atlanta’s closer. That’s because the Braves also re-signed Raisel Iglesias, their longtime closer, on a one-year, $16 million deal. He’ll continue to handle the ninth, and new skipper Walt Weiss will deploy Suárez in the Swiss Army knife, fireman role. Veterans Joel Payamps and Danny Young were also brought in on one-year deals to bolster a bullpen that finished 19th in baseball with a 4.19 ERA in 2025.\n\nAnthopoulos and Co. have been busy refurbishing the offensive side as well. Back in November, Atlanta  swung a one-for-one deal with Houston, acquiring utilityman Mauricio Dubón in exchange for defensive wizard Nick Allen. Dubón isn’t a particularly good hitter, but he provides a lot of defensive versatility and is a perfectly capable bat. The Braves followed that deal with a pair of more needle-moving signings in shortstop Ha-Seong Kim and outfielder Mike Yastrzemski.\n\nKim spent the final month of 2025 with the Braves after the club claimed him off waivers from the Tampa Bay Rays. That move was motivated by the hope that Kim wouldn’t activate his opt-out and Atlanta would have itself an every-day shortstop for 2026. Instead, the Korean glovesmith decided to test free agency, a smart decision as it turned out. Kim, who was set to receive $16 million, ended up back in Atlanta on a one-year, $20 million deal.\n\nThat’s a hefty investment for a player who was both hurt and bad in 2025, but Kim has been an average big-league hitter for most of his career while providing ample value at the game’s most difficult infield spot. For the Braves, whose shortstops finished dead last in baseball a year ago, with a putrid 56 wRC+, it’s a price worth paying.\n\nYastrzemski, who joined on a two-year, $23 million deal, is an unspectacular yet remarkably consistent corner outfielder. The 35-year-old has been worth at least 2.0 bWAR in every one of his seven big-league seasons and has a career .809 OPS against right-handed pitching. Although he’ll likely sit against most lefty starters, Yaz will provide depth in the corners behind Acuña and Jurickson Profar while mixing in at designated hitter.\n\nThat Atlanta has DH at-bats to dole out is a development in its own right. Since Opening Day 2023, Marcell Ozuna has started 445 of Atlanta’s 502 games, postseason included. Now a free agent for the first time in his career, Ozuna usually hit enough to justify clogging up the Braves’ DH spot. But at this point, a reunion feels unlikely, as the Braves can use that space to cycle through Yastrzemski, Profar and whoever isn’t catching that day (Murphy or Baldwin).\n\nWith Opening Day still three months away, the Braves seem pretty much finished with offseason business. Anthopoulos added a pair of every-day bats, a valuable utility guy, two high-leverage relievers and some potentially useful pitching depth. Atlanta could enter the season with its current assortment of ballplayers, and prognosticators and projection systems alike would consider this a playoff team.\n\nBut if the Braves want to push the issue, there’s still one more area ripe for a splash: the starting rotation. Sale, now fully healthy, will lead the line as he prepares to hit free agency at season’s end. Behind him, there’s Strider (looking to recapture his pre-surgery form), Schwellenbach (missed the last few months of ‘25 due to a fractured elbow), Reynaldo Lopez (made just one start in ‘25 before undergoing shoulder surgery) and youngster Hurston Waldrep (impressed in a nine-start sample but remains unproven). Grant Holmes, Bryce Elder and Didier Fuentes follow as depth options.\n\nIf things break right, that’s a really interesting group with tons of upside. It’s also a group that has shown to be particularly susceptible to the injury bug. That’s what derailed Atlanta’s plans last season, and the same thing could easily happen again.\n\nTo lessen that possibility, the Braves could add one more impact starter to the group. Such a move, given the organization’s middling farm system, would probably have to come via free agency. Atlanta is already over the luxury tax by around $6 million, according to Spotrac. Cashing out for a big arm such as Zac Gallen, Tatsuya Imai or Framber Valdez would push the Braves well over the tax, something the organization is wary of doing.\n\nBut money is just money, and the Braves cannot afford another disappointing season. They’ve done a good job, so far this winter, of avoiding a replay of 2025, but one more big swing could make them quite a formidable character in 2026.",

    "fullText": "Business Insider's Pranav Dixit has been covering Meta for a year now. He recently reported on the company's \"year of intensity\" with colleague Jyoti Mann. I asked Pranav for his take on a turbulent 12 months.\n\nQ: You've been covering Meta for a year now. What has that been like?\n\n\"Intense\" is the only way to describe it — exactly what Mark Zuckerberg promised employees. I joined BI a day before Meta scrapped third-party fact-checking, and almost immediately the culture shifted: DEI rollbacks, an embrace of \"masculine\" energy, and moves that seemed more aligned with the Trump administration. Then came thousands of layoffs of people labeled low performers and a noticeable spike in performance pressure.\n\nThe second half of the year brought a very different pivot. Meta effectively admitted Llama hadn't lived up to the hype and reset around a new mission: building \"personal superintelligence.\" That meant hiring Alexandr Wang, reorganizing AI under Meta Superintelligence Labs, and aggressively poaching talent while high-profile figures — including Yann LeCun — departed. It felt like covering a company reinventing its business, values, and culture all at once.\n\nQ: What stood out most from your reporting with Jyoti Mann on this \"year of intensity\"?\n\nA pervasive survival mindset. Over and over, employees told us the goal wasn't to do great work — it was to avoid landing in the bottom performance tier. Some people left on principle, saying Meta no longer resembled the company they joined. Yet others insisted this is the best job in tech: great product challenges, unmatched scale, exceptional pay. Those two realities sit side by side — one group bracing for impact, another thriving.\n\nQ: Your reporting found managers sometimes hiring people just to fill low-performance slots. How does that work?\n\nMeta's forced ranking requires a set percentage of \"low performers.\" Some managers gamed the system. Some told us they avoided backfilling roles; others hired into fuzzy positions with near-impossible expectations so they didn't have to put existing trusted team members in the bottom bucket. (Meta didn't respond to specific questions on this.)\n\nQ: What will you be watching for in 2026?\n\nThe big question is whether Meta's massive AI spend becomes a durable business or an expensive experiment. Will Meta AI become a distinct, everyday product? Will the capex binge translate into real revenue and profit? And can the culture stabilize enough to keep the AI talent Meta is betting the company on? Meta can execute — history proves that — but \"intensity\" can't last forever. 2026 will show whether the trade-offs were worth it.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

These leaders make choices every day about which customers to prioritize, which capabilities to build, where to allocate resources, and which longstanding activities and processes to evolve.

    "fullText": "Climbing the corporate ladder isn't the only way to increase your earnings.\n\nThroughout 2025, Business Insider spoke to a handful of entrepreneurs and side hustlers who found inventive ways to make money, from firing up 3D printers to propagating rare houseplants.\n\nHere are three of the most creative money-making strategies we heard all year.\n\nMichael Satterlee learned about 3D printing and CAD (computer-aided design) modeling in a class he took his freshman year of high school. He took the skill and ran with it, printing a variety of products, including clog accessories, that he listed and sold on Etsy.\n\nIn 2025, he created a coozie spin-off that he calls a \"tactical reload can holder\" — and the internet can't get enough of it.\n\nPartly thanks to viral videos of the can holder in action, the 18-year-old's company, Cruise Cup, generated $300,000 in sales in November alone. His goal in 2026 is to transition to manufacturing his product in stainless steel, as his 130 printers can barely keep up with demand.\n\nE-commerce entrepreneurs are tapping into a new strategy to move product: Live selling, which combines livestreaming and e-commerce. Sellers are hosting live \"shows\" and chatting with their audience in real time, while viewers are buying directly from the stream without leaving the app.\n\nIt can be incredibly lucrative if you can find the right niche. Top sellers are earning five and six figures in a single livestream.\n\nHarry Luu is one of those sellers. He brought in $42,000 in one day by selling two rare plants — one for $26,000 and the other for $16,000 — on Palmstreet, a live shopping app specifically for rare plants and other unique goods.\n\nThe former mathematician, who left academia in 2024 to cultivate and sell plants full-time, is all in on the \"new age QVC\" strategy.\n\n\"It gives you the convenience of being at home, but also allows the buyer the flexibility of actually interacting and clarifying before they pull the trigger,\" he said. \"And I think that is one of the greatest advantages of live selling.\"\n\nTraditional rental real estate remains a tried-and-true wealth-building strategy, but buying a property, finding renters, and then managing the property and tenants is time-consuming. Property investors like Carl and Mindy Jensen, who have accumulated substantial savings, are adopting a more passive approach: private money lending.\n\nHere's how it works in a nutshell: The Jensens lend money to other investors to rehab a house, for example, and earn interest on the loan. They're essentially acting as the bank.\n\n\"We set the rate. There are some rules around it. For example, the rate can't be super cheap or else the IRS considers it a gift,\" the couple explained, referring to the applicable federal rate (AFR), which is the minimum interest rate the IRS allows for private loans, published monthly.\n\nVetting the borrower and the deal they're pursuing is essential — and time-consuming — but after the upfront due diligence, the ongoing involvement is minimal.\n\nThe neat thing about this money-making strategy? It's a \"win-win\" for both the lender and the borrower, confirmed investor Mike Gorius, who prefers working with private money lenders over traditional lenders: \"Things can just move a lot quicker. It's what allows us to buy properties in a matter of days versus a matter of weeks.\"",

    "fullText": "I missed Hanukkah, and I'm cutting it close on Christmas, but I've finally got my holiday wish list in order.\n\nI'm not looking for new sneakers or some cool electronics. This year's requests focus on the business world. (Santa Claus is a BI Today subscriber, obviously.)\n\nROI for AI. I'm legally required to start every 2025 recap or 2026 look-ahead by mentioning artificial intelligence. This isn't about bashing or praising AI, though. I just want to see some noticeable returns on all these massive AI projects. I'm not screaming about an AI bubble, but my palms get a little sweaty thinking about the ever-growing tech budgets. So, give us all some relief by showing that these AI tools are going to generate revenue.\n\nA solution to Wall Street's recruiting cycle. The worst thing that could happen to a junior banker is finding out their favorite Murray Hill brunch spot has shut down. The second-worst thing happened this year when big banks fought back against PE's early recruitment of them. The result upended a Wall Street tradition aspiring financiers had spent years preparing for. I was never a fan of the process, but the change left us in a weird no-man's land where none of the rules are apparent.\n\nPrediction markets predict their future. With a string of recent media partnerships, we're going to see a lot more data from prediction markets in 2026. Meanwhile, some state regulators aren't so pleased with their rise. So let's settle the debate. I'd like prediction markets to set a market speculating on their own future. Let the people decide!\n\nNo more media blackouts, please. I can't go through another two weeks of no sports because of carriage disputes. I know how this story ends (the customer paying more), and I also know there's nothing I can do about it. So just rip the bandage off, and let's avoid the grandstanding going forward.\n\nProtein, chill out. No food group is on a hotter run than the muscle-building nutrient. But it's flying too close to the sun. We've got protein in hot cocoa now?? I'm a self-admitted gym bro, and I know my whey around a protein shake (I hate myself for that joke), but even I need to put my foot down. Besides, overconsumption of protein could have a painful conclusion for some of us: kidney stones.\n\nThe New York Knicks to reach the NBA finals. I'm not even asking for a title!\n\nThe New York Jets to play a meaningful game in December. Even Santa has his limits",

    "fullText": "WICHITA, Kan. (KSNW) – Being a Kansas City Chiefs fan is often about loyalty and emotional commitment. But with the Chiefs announcing Monday that they would leave the historic Arrowhead Stadium in Missouri and move into a not-yet-built $3 billion stadium on the Kansas side of Kansas City, Kansas-based fans soon won’t need to root for their team across state lines.\n\n“That creates energy that I don’t think we really understand or really appreciate until it starts happening, until the stadium gets built, they play their first game, they play their first season,” Kevin Jenks, the president and CEO of the Wichita Sports Commission, said.\n\nThe Chiefs spent more than five decades playing at Arrowhead. They intend to build their new stadium in Wyandotte County, in the same area as Kansas Speedway and the Legends retail district.\n\n‘I just love Arrowhead’: Some Chiefs super fans not sold on move to Kansas\n\nEven though Wichita will be a few hours away from the new field, the hope is that the team’s presence can strengthen the area’s sports identity. Wichita Sports Commission hopes that includes strengthening ongoing partnerships with the franchise.\n\n“The Chiefs have been big proponents of getting flag football into high schools, and we were a part of that locally with some Wichita schools,” Jenks said. “We are still continuing to promote and be a part of that process.”\n\nDr. Larry Straub, an associate professor of business management at Newman University, says the Chiefs’ presence is likely to improve Kansas’ national image. However, he’s skeptical that the financial boom that comes with a major sports team moving in will echo around the state.\n\n“From an economics standpoint, I think the closer you are to Kansas City, the more benefits you’re going to have,” Straub said.\n\nFor more Kansas news, click here.

Hundreds of families may be forced to pack up and leave the town of 11,000, heading east to Omaha or Iowa, or south to the meatpacking towns of Kansas or beyond, causing spinoff layoffs in Lexington's restaurants, barbershops, grocers, convenience stores and taco trucks.  “Losing 3,000 jobs in a city of 10,000 to 12,000 people is as big a closing event as we’ve seen virtually for decades,” said Michael Hicks, director of the Center for Business and Economic Research at Indiana's Ball State University.",
    "fullText": "LEXINGTON, Neb. (AP) — On a frigid day after Mass at St. Ann’s Catholic Church in rural Nebraska, worshippers shuffled into the basement and sat on folding chairs, their faces barely masking the fear gripping their town.\n\nA pall hung over the room just as it hung over the holiday season in Lexington, Nebraska.\n\n“Suddenly they tell us that there’s no more work. Your world closes in on you,” said Alejandra Gutierrez.\n\nShe and the others work at Tyson Foods' beef plant and are among the 3,200 people who will lose their jobs when Lexington's biggest employer closes the plant next month after more than two decades of operation.\n\nHundreds of families may be forced to pack up and leave the town of 11,000, heading east to Omaha or Iowa, or south to the meatpacking towns of Kansas or beyond, causing spinoff layoffs in Lexington's restaurants, barbershops, grocers, convenience stores and taco trucks.\n\n“Losing 3,000 jobs in a city of 10,000 to 12,000 people is as big a closing event as we’ve seen virtually for decades,” said Michael Hicks, director of the Center for Business and Economic Research at Indiana's Ball State University. It will be “close to the poster child for hard times.”\n\nAll told, the job losses are expected to reach 7,000, largely in Lexington and the surrounding counties, according to estimates from University of Nebraska, Lincoln, shared with The Associated Press. Tyson employees alone will lose an estimated $241 million in pay and benefits annually.\n\nTyson says it's closing the plant to “right-size” its beef business after a historically low cattle herd in the U.S. and the company’s expected loss of $600 million on beef production next fiscal year.\n\nThe plant's closure threatens to unravel a Great Plains town where the American Dream was still attainable, where immigrants who didn't speak English and never graduated high school bought homes, raised children in a safe community and sent them to college.\n\nNow, those symbols of economic progress — mortgages and car payments, property taxes and tuition costs — are bills that thousands of Tyson workers won't have an income to pay.\n\nAt St. Ann's church, Gutierrez sat between her daughters and recalled being told of the plant closure just before Thanksgiving while she visited a college campus with her high school senior, Kimberly.\n\n“At that moment, my daughter said she no longer wanted to study,” Gutierrez said. “Because where would we get the money to pay for college?”\n\nA tear slipped down Kimberly's cheek as she looked at her mother and then down at her hands.\n\nIf you threw a dart at a map of the United States, Lexington — called “Lex” by locals — would be just about bullseye.\n\nIt's easy to miss driving down Interstate 80, half hidden by barren hackberry trees, corn fields and pastures of Black Angus cattle, but a driver can spy the plant's hulking industrial buildings pumping steam.\n\nThe plant opened in 1990 and was bought by Tyson 11 years later, attracting thousands of workers and nearly doubling the town's population within a decade.\n\nMany came from Los Angeles, then stricken by recession, including Lizeth Yanes, who initially hated what she called “a little ghost town.\"\n\nBut soon Lexington flourished, with suburbs sprouting among bur oak and American elm trees. The downtown, a strip of cobblestone streets and brick buildings, has a Somali grocer that abuts a Hispanic bakery; locals attend over a dozen churches and several city recreation centers.\n\nTo this day, the plant creates the town's rhythm as workers roll on and off the daily A, B and C shifts and fill restaurants, school pickup lines and the one-screen movie theater showing “Polar Express.”\n\n“It took a long time for me to actually enjoy this little place,” said Yanes. “Now that I enjoy it, now I have to leave.”\n\nThe atmosphere inside the Tyson plant, where workers process as many as 5,000 head of cattle a day, laboring on slaughter floors, cleaning crews or trimming cuts of meat, feels “like a funeral,” she said.\n\n“Tyson was our motherland,\" said plant worker Arab Adan. The Kenyan immigrant sat in his car with his two energetic sons, who asked him a question he has no answer to: “Which state are we gonna go, daddy?”\n\nThe only thing Adan is set on is that his kids finish the school year in Lexington, where school officials say nearly half of students have a parent working for Tyson.\n\nThe school district, where at least 20 languages and dialects are spoken, has higher high school graduation and college attendance rates than the state and national average, and one of Nebraska's biggest marching bands. Residents are proud of the diversity and the tightknit community, where young people return to raise families.\n\nDuring Mass at St. Ann's, parishioners gave the cash in their pockets to a fund for families in financial need, despite knowing they'll be out of work next month. Afterward, Francisco Antonio ran through his future employment options with a sad smile.\n\nAfter the plant closes on Jan. 20, the 52-year-old father of four said he'll stay a few months in Lexington and look for work, though “now there's no future.\" He took off his glasses, paused, apologized and tried to explain his emotions.\n\n“It’s home mostly, not the job,” he said, replacing his glasses with an embarrassed smile.\n\n“We need another opportunity, job, here in Lex,” he said. “Otherwise Lex is gonna disappear.”\n\nThe domino effect could go something like this: If 1,000 families skip town, said economist Hicks — who wouldn't be surprised if it were double that — seats would be left empty in schools, leading to teacher layoffs; there would be far fewer customers in restaurants, shops and other businesses.\n\nMost of the customers at Los Jalapenos, a Mexican restaurant down the street from the plant, are Tyson workers. They fill booths after work and are greeted by owner Armando Martinez’s mustachioed grin and bellow of “Hola, amigo!”\n\nMartinez’s grandson once told his grandfather that when he grows up he wants to work at Tyson. The child's fifth-grade sister recently gathered with classmates to talk about the changes happening with their parents. Some were headed to California, others to Kansas. All were in tears.\n\nIf he can't keep up with bills, the restaurant will close, but “there’s just nowhere we can go,\" said Martinez, who undergoes dialysis for diabetes, has an amputated foot and prays for a miracle: that Tyson will change its mind.\n\nHe knows it's unlikely. Asked by The Associated Press for comment about plans for the site, Tyson said in a statement that it “is currently assessing how we can repurpose the facility within our own production network.” It did not provide details, or say whether it plans to offer support to the community through the plant closure.\n\nMany, including City Manager Joe Pepplitsch, are hoping Tyson puts the plant up for sale and a new company comes in bringing jobs. That isn't a quick fix, requiring time, negotiations, renovations and no guarantee of comparable jobs.\n\n“Tyson owes this community a debt. I think they have a responsibility here to help ease some of the impact,” he said, noting Tyson doesn't pay city taxes due to a deal negotiated decades ago.\n\n‘It’s not easy, at our age, to go back and start over’\n\nNear the plant, at the Dawson County Fairgrounds, Tyson workers recently filled a long hall as state agencies — responding with the urgency of a natural disaster — offered information on retraining, writing a resume, filing for unemployment and avoiding scammers when selling homes.\n\nAttendees' faces were subdued, like listening to a doctor’s prognosis. “Your financial health is going to change,\" they were told. “Don’t ignore the bank, they will not go away.”\n\nMany of the older workers don’t speak English, haven’t graduated high school and aren’t computer savvy. The last application some filled out was decades ago.\n\n“We know only working in meat for Tyson, we don’t have any other experience,” said Adan, the Kenyan immigrant.\n\nBack at St. Ann's, workers echoed that concern.\n\n“They only want young people now,” said Juventino Castro, who's worked at Tyson for a quarter-century. “I don’t know what’s going to happen in the time I have left.”\n\nLupe Ceja said she's saved a little money, but it won’t last long. Luz Alvidrez has a cleaning gig that will sustain her for awhile. Others might return to Mexico for a time. Nobody has a clear plan.\n\n“It won’t be easy,” said Fernando Sanchez, a Tyson worker for 35 years who sat with his wife. “We started here from scratch and it’s time to start from scratch again.\"\n\nTears rolled down his wife's cheeks and he squeezed her hand.",

    "description": "Finance pros tell Business Insider about the most annoying investing questions they have to field from family around holidays.",
    "fullText": "For finance professionals, the holidays bring festive cheer and optimism for the new year that we all enjoy. For them, it also brings requests for investing advice and stock picks that sources tell Business Insider they'd rather not have to deal with.\n\nFor many investors, advisors, and others who navigate markets for a living, seeing their relatives during the holiday season often means being asked the same question: What stocks should I buy?\n\nThere's no easy answer, as the stock market is unpredictable and everyone has different risk tolerance, investment horizons, and goals.\n\nColin Sahagun, the founder and CEO of Stelrix, a fintech startup that recently launched an investment-backed spending card, says the question often amounts to, \"How do I get rich quick?\"\n\n\"Every year, someone asks, 'Tell me the next 20 high-growth stocks I should buy,'\" he recalls. \"I will have older relatives asking for 'the next Oklo under 10 dollars' or 'the next Vertiv at fourteen.' They want moonshot ideas and total reassurance at the same time.\"\n\nOklo and Vertiv are two stocks that have enjoyed big runs in 2025. Vertiv has jumped 44%, while Oklo is up a whopping 280%.\n\nSteven Rick, chief economist at financial services firm TruStage, says he's routinely asked for the next hot stock when visiting family for the holidays.\n\nHe notes that a common question is something like: \"Why didn't you tell me to buy Nvidia stock two years ago?\"\n\n\"This is annoying because 'hindsight bias' occurs when family members perceive a past massive rise in a stock price as more predictable than it actually was.\"\n\nAnthony Rasotto, CEO of wealth management firm ARC Wealth, echoed that sentiment, adding that requests for advice on the direction of the market are among the most irritating.\n\n\"The most annoying question is, 'Which way is the market going in the next few months?' It's usually from an uncle near or at retirement,\" he said. \"I always answer: 'I don't know.' If I could predict the market, I wouldn't need to work at all.\"\n\nPeople who work in crytpo also get bombared for advice at the holidays. Adrian Fritz, CIO of digital asset brokerage platform 21Shares, told Business Insider that while he's often asked about the best time to buy bitcoin, he's sometimes asked to name the best asset to buy in the coming year.\n\n\"It assumes there's a single 'best' asset for everyone, as if I've been hiding a secret Christmas stock pick all year waiting to unveil it at dinner,\" he said. \"The reality is a lot less cinematic: good investing depends on personal circumstances, not holiday fortune-telling.\"\n\nFinance pros stress that there is never a clear answer to the annoying stock market questions they receive from relatives. Anthony Termini, a former hedge fund CIO turned investment analyst and commentator, highlighted why many people don't want to discuss these topics in depth.\n\n\"The answer is always, 'who knows?'\" he said. \"More importantly, who cares? Whatever the answer is, it may never be an asset class or security that is appropriate or suitable.\"",

Using nationally representative household consumption surveys from 23 countries that together account for 50% of the world’s poor, we estimate that reducing the poverty rate to 1% (from a baseline of 12% at the time of last survey) would cost $170B nominal per year. This is 5.5 times the corresponding reduction in the aggregate poverty gap, but only 19% of the cost of universal basic income.

    "description": "Karen Gilchrist jokes that her \"maternal instincts kicked in late,\" but by 2024 she and her husband, Pablo Slough, decided to prioritize family over climbing the corporate ladder.",
    "fullText": "Over two decades of working in demanding roles managing teams around the world had taken a toll.\n\n\"I worked straight out of college, and then it was one job to the other job,\" Slough, 53, told Business Insider. \"It was always fast-paced, high stress.\"\n\nFor Gilchrist, turning 50 last summer drove her to reflect about how she'd spent her time and what she wanted to do moving forward.\n\n\"I joke sometimes that my maternal instincts kicked in late,\" Gilchrist told Business Insider. \"But it felt like the right moment to dedicate more time to my family than to work and climbing the corporate ladder.\"\n\nTheir oldest son, Luka, 18, is in his senior year and plans to head off to college in the fall. The other two, Mateo, 15, and Joaquin, 12, aren't far behind.\n\nTaking a gap year would give the couple a chance to step away from work, travel with their kids, and figure out their next steps.\n\nBut they didn't jump in immediately. The couple, based in Boulder, Colorado, hired a financial advisor a year in advance to make sure the plan was financially feasible.\n\n\"We also decided that we're going to rent our house out while we're traveling, so we could get some income,\" Slough said.\n\nAs their plans to quit became more concrete, the couple talked through everything with their kids. Funnily enough, it was their sons who seemed unsure at first.\n\n\"We were a bit surprised that our parents would actually do it because they have always been very focused on their careers,\" their second son, Mateo, told Business Insider.\n\nBut one of the reasons the couple wanted to do this was to show their kids that life isn't just about work, Gilchrist said.\n\n\"It's about life. It's about balancing things. It's about family,\" she said, adding that they hoped the experience would show their kids that life doesn't always have to follow a fixed path.\n\nThe couple considered it a career break, but the plan was not to travel the whole time.\n\n\"We didn't want to disrupt school,\" Slough said. \"So we just thought we'll come back for school, and then whatever free time we have, we'll travel.\"\n\nThe family spent the summer of 2024 traveling around Europe, a trip planned around their eldest son's three-week business course at a university in Barcelona.\n\nTheir travels began in Turkey, before they hopped on a cruise through Greece, Croatia, Malta, and Montenegro. After dropping their son off for his program, they explored Spain and Portugal before reuniting and heading to Colombia. They were back in Colorado a week before school started.\n\nThis year, their summer took them to Asia, with stops in Hong Kong, several cities in Thailand, Vietnam, China, and finally Japan.\n\n\"We all wanted to go to Asia, so we were really excited about it,\" Luka, their oldest son, told Business Insider.\n\nTo budget for their trips, the couple created an Excel sheet to track their daily expenses.\n\n\"We had an average spend per day that we wanted to aim for. It meant that in some places, we splurged because we wanted a really nice hotel. And in other places, we were a little bit more frugal,\" Gilchrist said, adding that they would update their expenses in real time to see if they were within their budget.\n\nLooking back on the trips, the family says they loved every moment.\n\n\"It felt like our parents were more present and flexible with us,\" Joaquin, their youngest, told Business Insider. \"We also learned more about each other's preferences, from the experiences and foods we enjoy to how each of us likes to spend our free time.\"\n\nDuring the months they weren't traveling, the couple spent their time at home doing things they rarely had time for before, such as exercising together, reading, and going to the movies every week.\n\n\"Now, we have this objective of cooking something completely new every day,\" Gilchrist said.\n\nThe couple says they feel less stressed, sleep better, and have genuinely enjoyed spending more time together.\n\n\"We're like, 'OK, we're going to be together all day long. What is that going to look like?' And truthfully, I think it's been amazing,\" Gilchrist said.\n\nBut the biggest benefit of taking time away from work has been having the space to reflect on what they wanted to do next, Slough said. He started teaching three days a week at a local university.\n\n\"It's something I've always wanted to do,\" Slough said. \"And then it just happened to come my way.\"\n\nHad he been working full-time, taking up this offer would have been out of the question, he said.\n\nThey also realized they didn't have to return to their corporate jobs to live comfortably. They could earn a portion of what they once made and still maintain their lifestyle.\n\nWorking with a financial advisor helped them identify areas where they were overspending and set a goal to cut their regular expenses by 30%. Before that, the couple had never closely tracked their finances.\n\n\"We were spending so much that we thought we needed really high-paying jobs to be able to continue,\" Slough said.\n\nKyle D. Dennehy, a financial advisor at California Financial Advisor who wasn't involved in the couple's planning, told Business Insider that the first step in preparing for a career break is to create a detailed budget that outlines all income sources, expenses, and savings goals.\n\n\"Once you have your 'normal' budget, estimate how each specific category will shift during an adult gap year, but keep your long-term goal savings like retirement contributions included in the gap year budget,\" Dennehy said.\n\nOnce the difference between the regular and new budgets is clear, a plan can be created to regularly contribute toward the updated savings goal, Dennehy said.\n\nNow, the couple is exploring whether to buy and run a small local business rather than slip back into corporate jobs. Gilchrist said they might never have considered entrepreneurship without the break.\n\n\"We joke, and we say that this time has also been a research and development phase for us on, 'OK, what does being productive over the next 10, 20 years look like?'\" Gilchrist said.\n\nOf course, there are risks that come with taking an extended career break, but careful financial planning has helped them manage those uncertainties.\n\n\"Plan it properly. It can't just be like, 'Oh, I quit my job this weekend, and we're going to travel for a year.' It will not work,\" Slough said.\n\nDo you have a story to share about taking a career break?

    "description": "Lee Wan Yu, a former Disneyland parade dancer, shares a behind-the-scenes look at the audition process and what she learned from Disney's magic.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Lee Wan Yu, 30, a Hong Kong Disneyland parade dancer turned freelance dance artist, teacher, and choreographer. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI started dancing when I was three years old, after asking my mom for ballet lessons as we walked past a studio.\n\nFrom then on, all I wanted to do was dance. That love eventually led me somewhere I, as an introvert, never expected: Hong Kong Disneyland.\n\nIt started in 2017, when Hong Kong Disneyland held an audition at the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts in Singapore, where I was studying for my diploma in dance.\n\nI went with a friend who didn't want to go alone. I had no expectations and just wanted to see how a professional audition works.\n\nAbout 50 dancers from the region participated in the audition.\n\nThey gave us a short jazz combination and had us perform it in small groups, cutting dancers until about 20 of us were left. They took our photos, measured our height, and recorded our body measurements.\n\nMonths later, while I was studying for my fine arts degree in New York, I was offered a standard one-year contract as a parade dancer at Hong Kong Disneyland.\n\nWhen I arrived in May 2018, I realized I was the only Singaporean parade dancer at the time. The team included dancers from Hong Kong, Japan, the Philippines, Russia, Taiwan, and Thailand.\n\nA typical day started around 11 a.m. We had a warm-up class, followed by makeup and costumes.\n\nWe typically performed two parades a day, one in the afternoon and one at night, for about 30 minutes each. During festive seasons like Christmas, we could have up to four parades a day.\n\nIn the middle of each parade, we would stop in front of the castle for a short \"show stop\" to interact with guests.\n\nRehearsals for the Halloween parades sometimes ended around 2 a.m. because they took place after the park closed for the night.\n\nThe Hong Kong heat can be terrible, and the night-parade costumes had lights wired through and batteries attached. You could feel the weight pressing on your shoulders.\n\nSometimes I felt homesick or lonely, but once you're in costume, you have to bring your full energy.\n\nWhen you step into Disneyland, you should feel like you're transported to a different world — a place where you can disconnect, forget your problems for a while, and just be happy.\n\nThis is why guests would never see dancers working out during breaks, because Disney wanted to keep the illusion. We were also not allowed to take any backstage photos or videos.\n\nThe magic is the reason some guests come to every parade. There were adults who followed the route, taking photos, and kids who waved at us every day. I remember a teenage boy who came almost every weekend, dancing beside the route the whole time.\n\nSome of them recognized us outside the park without our costumes. Others gave us prints of photos they had taken of us.\n\nIt was more than just branding and the experience.\n\nAt Hong Kong Disneyland, everyone, from the dancers to the sound crew, respected one another. Even when people were tired, they were still polite. That attitude really stuck with me.\n\nI learned that how I treat people — not just the audience, but also my colleagues, the costume team, and the stage managers — really affects how smoothly everything runs and whether people want to be around you.\n\nOn the other side, Disney valued its performers. It was very serious about safety and well-being. We had good medical insurance, which is important for dancers.\n\nAfter one year, I decided not to re-audition for contract renewal. I wanted to explore new challenges.\n\nI'm now a freelance dancer, teacher, and choreographer in Singapore, where I try to infuse Disney's spirit of \"magic\" into my work.\n\nDance training can be stressful for kids, especially during exams or competitions, so I try to keep that sense of fun alive and create an environment where my students feel safe and excited to learn.\n\nThe magic is about creating that little moment in class where someone feels proud or inspired.\n\nI also try to bring that same magic into my choreography. AI plays a small part in helping me express my ideas.\n\nAs a choreographer, I often have to write synopses for school performances or competitions, and that part is difficult because dancers think in movement, not in sentences.\n\nRecently, I started using ChatGPT to help organize my ideas. I don't let it write for me, but I use it to structure what I already have and express my thoughts more clearly.\n\nI'm also open to trying AI software for large-scale productions with apps that can help with pinpoint formations, map things out, and visualise spacing.\n\nOver the past two years, I was a choreographer for Singapore's National Day Parade performances, overseeing close to 600 students for one of them. I remember spending weeks figuring out formations by hand, staying up until 3 a.m. or 4 a.m., moving people around in Excel.\n\nIf AI could help with that, it would save so much time.\n\nBut technology can only assist — the emotion behind the movement still has to come from people.",

    "fullText": "PHOENIX (AP) — When Turning Point USA's annual AmericaFest convention reached its halfway point, Erika Kirk tried to put a smiling face on things.\n\n“Say what you want about AmFest, but it’s definitely not boring,” said Kirk, who has led the influential conservative organization since her husband Charlie was assassinated in September. “Feels like a Thanksgiving dinner where your family’s hashing out the family business.”\n\nSome of the biggest names in conservative media took turns torching each other on the main stage, spending more time targeting right-wing rivals than their left-wing opponents.\n\nThe feuds could ultimately define the boundaries of the Republican Party and determine the future of President Donald Trump's fractious coalition, which appears primed for more schisms in the months and years ahead.\n\nHere are some of the most notable moments from the four-day conference.\n\nBen Shapiro, co-founder of the conservative media outlet Daily Wire, set the tone with the first speech after Erika Kirk opened the convention. He attacked fellow commentators in deeply personal terms, saying some of the right's most popular figures are morally bankrupt.\n\nCandace Owens “has been vomiting all sorts of hideous and conspiratorial nonsense into the public square for years,” he said.\n\nMegyn Kelly is “guilty of cowardice\" because she's refused to condemn Owens for spreading unsubstantiated theories about Kirk's death.\n\nAnd Tucker Carlson's decision to host antisemite Nick Fuentes on his podcast was “an act of moral imbecility.”\n\nBarely an hour later, Carlson took the same stage and mocked Shapiro’s attempt to “deplatform and denounce” people who disagree with him.\n\n“I watched it,” he said. “I laughed.”\n\nOthers had their chance the next night.\n\n“Ben Shapiro is like a cancer, and that cancer spreads,” said Steve Bannon, a former Trump adviser.\n\nKelly belittled Shapiro as a marginal figure in the conservative movement and said their friendship is over.\n\n“I resent that he thinks he’s in a position to decide who must say what, to whom, and when,” Kelly said.\n\nOwens, who has spread unsubstantiated conspiracy theories about Charlie Kirk's death, wasn't welcome at the convention. But she responded on her podcast, calling Shapiro a “miserable imp.\"\n\nA schism over Israel and antisemitism\n\nIsrael came up repeatedly during the conference.\n\nSome on the right have questioned whether the Republican Party's historically steadfast support for Israel conflicts with Trump's “America First” platform. Carlson criticized civilian deaths in Gaza in remarks that wouldn't have been out of place in progressive circles.\n\nSome attendees dug deep into history, highlighting Israel's attack on the USS Liberty off the Sinai Peninsula in 1967. Israel said it mistook the ship for an Egyptian vessel during the Six Day War, while critics have argued that it was a deliberate strike.\n\nBannon accused Shapiro, who is Jewish, and others who staunchly support Israel of being part of “the Israel first crowd.” Kelly said criticism from Shapiro and Bari Weiss, the newly installed head of CBS News, “is about Israel.\"\n\nVance gets a helpful endorsement\n\nErika Kirk pledged Turning Point’s support for Vice President JD Vance to be the next Republican presidential nominee.\n\n“We are going to get my husband’s friend JD Vance elected for 48 in the most resounding way possible,” she said on the first night of the convention. Vance would be the 48th president if he takes office after Trump.\n\nTurning Point is a major force on the right, with a massive volunteer network around the country that can be especially helpful in early primary states.\n\nVance was close with Charlie Kirk, whose backing helped enable his rapid political rise. The vice president is scheduled to close out the convention as the final speaker on Sunday.\n\nThe Make America Healthy Again movement had a big presence at Turning Point, signaling its quick rise in the right-wing ecosystem.\n\nMAHA is spearheaded by Robert F. Kennedy, who leads the Department of Health and Human Services. However, there has been friction with other parts of the Make America Great Again coalition, particularly when it comes to rolling back environmental regulations.\n\nWellness influencer Alex Clark, whose podcast is sponsored by Turning Point, asked the crowd whether the Environmental Protection Agency is “with us or against us?”\n\n“Big chemical, big ag and big food are trying to split MAGA from MAHA so things can go back to business as usual, but we don’t want that, do we?” Clark said.\n\nClark and others have asked for Trump to fire EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, who responded by reaching out to MAHA activists. The EPA also said it would release a MAHA agenda for the agency.\n\n“The Trump EPA wants to partner with the MAHA community and make sure everyone has a seat at the table,” EPA press secretary Carolyn Holran said in response to Clark's speech.",

It riffs on everything from Ken Burns-style narration, including an abrupt firing of Burns himself in favor of some \"pizzazz,\" to execs dancing their way through \"Dirty Dancing\"-style choreography.\n\nExecutives portraying the firm's mid-life crisis include one who wears a nose ring and others who want to buy sports teams or Ferrari (the company). Cameos include actor Danny DeVito pitching jargon-filled investment products, as well as Goldman Sachs CEO (and side-hustling DJ) David Solomon.\n\nThe seven-and-a-half-minute video concludes with Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman and President Jon Gray in a parody of the \"Back to the Future\" movie.\n\nBlackstone is no stranger to quirky holiday videos. In fact, this was their 8th in a row (see where this year's video lands in BI's power ranking).\n\nYou might be wondering: Why does Blackstone spend so much time, effort, and money on such a thing, especially when few other financial firms do? Apollo produced its own holiday video in 2022, but this year the private-equity firm appears to have pivoted to publishing.\n\nBlackstone produced its first holiday video in 2018 as a replacement for its New York holiday party, as the firm had grown too large. Earlier this month, at a conference, Gray said the video was a way for the world's largest private investor to \"make fun of ourselves.\"\n\nBlackstone's video ends on a poignant note in memory of Wesley LePatner, a Blackstone executive who was killed in the tragic summer shooting at the firm's NYC headquarters. The video said she \"always made us smile.\"",

    "title": "The mayor of a New York City suburb says building apartments on parking lots near train and bus stations is a key to reining in rent",
    "description": "New Rochelle Mayor Yadira Ramos-Herbert talked with Business Insider about how her NYC suburb is building lots of new housing and keeping costs down.",
    "fullText": "In a year full of abundance discourse, New Rochelle Mayor Yadira Ramos-Herbert is living the abundance agenda.\n\nThe skyline of her Westchester County city, just 20 miles north of Manhattan, is barely recognizable from a decade ago. New apartment and condo towers have shot up, the city's population is booming, and rents and home prices haven't risen nearly as fast as in other cities in the region and across the US.\n\nThe city plans to fulfill its goal of adding 11,000 units in about 32 buildings in several years, growing the city's housing stock by 37%, according to the Wall Street Journal. The mayor told Business Insider the city is about two-thirds of the way to its goal.\n\nAnd the efforts are showing signs of success. Median rents in New Rochelle rose by just 7% between 2017 and 2023, according to a Pew analysis of Apartment List data. That's compared to a 31% median rent increase nationwide.\n\nOver the last decade, the city has supercharged housing construction by overhauling zoning laws, streamlining environmental review, and offering new tax breaks to developers. The city has focused on revitalizing its downtown by building homes on underutilized commercial and parking lots near rail and bus stations.\n\n\"We weren't tearing down homes. We weren't tearing down existing apartment buildings,\" Ramos-Herbert said in an interview this fall with Business Insider. \"We were just leveraging underutilized sites and catalyzing them through the development.\"\n\nThe new homes don't just impact New Rochelle's 85,000 residents. They have implications for the entire region, which is suffering from one of the most severe housing shortages in the country. New York City relies on its suburbs to house a big portion of its workers and absorb a steady stream of people leaving the five boroughs.\n\nWhile the Big Apple builds less housing per capita than most other major cities in the US, many of its suburbs have an even more dismal record. Between 2010 and 2021, the New York suburbs approved just 13 new homes for every 1,000 residents — about half the rate of the Big Apple.\n\nThere's been some opposition to all the new construction in New Rochelle among locals. There are concerns about traffic, lack of parking, and noise from construction sites. But her constituents also worry that the shiny towers are being filled with transplants, rather than New Rochelle locals in need of affordable housing.\n\nThe mayor said that gentrification concerns are overblown. She noted that 22% of the residents in the new housing are from New Rochelle, and 21% are from surrounding towns in Westchester County. That's compared to 33% who've come from New York City. The new units have given locals a smaller home to downsize to, or a way to shorten their commute by living within walking distance of an Amtrak and Metro-North rail station, she said.\n\n\"These are not strangers. These are our friends. These are your kids' friends,\" she said. \"These are your parents.\"\n\nThe city has been hailed as a model for communities that need to boost housing production amid severe affordability challenges. New Rochelle isn't alone in the region — Jersey City has also built housing at a rapid clip in recent years, becoming another model for YIMBYs to point to.\n\nRamos-Herbert's advice to other cities and communities: start by building transit-oriented development on underutilized commercial plots.\n\nShe also touted the critical income the new housing and residents bring in for the city through property taxes and sales tax, allowing it to invest in infrastructure and programs that benefit everyone. She pointed to the $100 million renovation of the city's train station and the transformation of a highway that divides a historically Black neighborhood into a linear park and local road.\n\n\"You can only tax so much,\" she said. \"We have to kind of create, ensure, proactive creation of alternative revenue streams to support us.\"",

For example, Fogel explained that when tensions started to heat up between Russia and Ukraine, a region where the company operates, they began to prepare contingency plans \"just in case.\"\n\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine became public just hours after the company's earnings call in February 2022. As the situation developed, Booking Holdings supported employees abroad and navigated expected sanctions. That led to the company's decision to suspend travel services in Russia and Belarus in March 2022, the company said.\n\nFogel, who's been with the company for over 25 years, isn't a stranger to navigating complicated situations. He outlined his crisis response approach, starting with the people he keeps on speed dial to how he manages stress.\n\nWhen a crisis arises, Fogel said the first people he contacts are the company's executive officers, including the general counsel, chief financial officer, and chief HR officer.\n\nNext, he works to identify the problem and which part of the business it affects. As a global travel conglomerate, Fogel said issues can impact different regions in different ways.\n\nThe CEO added that the company's long history of navigating challenges has helped it respond effectively when new problems arise. He said he reminds himself that there is an end to every crisis. For example, with COVID, he said he didn't know when a vaccine would come out, but he knew one eventually would.\n\n\"It helps you've already been through a lot before,\" Fogel said. \"It's not the first rodeo.\"\n\nWhen it comes to managing the stress of the job, Fogel said he practices meditation.\n\n\"I'd like to do it every day,\" Fogel said.\n\nHe said his other non-negotiable is exercise, which he always does before work nearly every day. Fogel does light weightlifting year-round and swims in the summer.\n\nEven when he's traveling — which is more often than he's home, he said — he makes time for a workout at his hotel, squeezing in email responses during lower-intensity sessions.",

    "fullText": "I am not taking any time off during the next two weeks. I'm not trying to win a hustle trophy. I actually don't believe in hustle culture. Instead, I'm punting my time off to January so my team can spend time with loved ones during the holiday season.\n\nMany in corporate culture settings vacillate between \"let me get this one thing done before the New Year\" and \"please leave me alone until 2026.\" I have reframed the last two weeks of the year — not to work harder, but to work differently.\n\nFor the past week, I've asked myself how I can use these next two weeks to be intentional about setting 2026 up for success. So here's how I'm taking advantage of the last two weeks of the year, which I'm calling auto-reply season:\n\nFor anyone still working, remember the reason for the season — it's a time to enjoy community, whatever that looks like for you. You actually don't need to sprint to the finish line. A stroll will do.",
