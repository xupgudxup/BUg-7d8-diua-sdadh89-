    "title": "The mayor of a New York City suburb says building apartments on parking lots near train and bus stations is a key to reining in rent",
    "description": "New Rochelle Mayor Yadira Ramos-Herbert talked with Business Insider about how her NYC suburb is building lots of new housing and keeping costs down.",
    "fullText": "In a year full of abundance discourse, New Rochelle Mayor Yadira Ramos-Herbert is living the abundance agenda.\n\nThe skyline of her Westchester County city, just 20 miles north of Manhattan, is barely recognizable from a decade ago. New apartment and condo towers have shot up, the city's population is booming, and rents and home prices haven't risen nearly as fast as in other cities in the region and across the US.\n\nThe city plans to fulfill its goal of adding 11,000 units in about 32 buildings in several years, growing the city's housing stock by 37%, according to the Wall Street Journal. The mayor told Business Insider the city is about two-thirds of the way to its goal.\n\nAnd the efforts are showing signs of success. Median rents in New Rochelle rose by just 7% between 2017 and 2023, according to a Pew analysis of Apartment List data. That's compared to a 31% median rent increase nationwide.\n\nOver the last decade, the city has supercharged housing construction by overhauling zoning laws, streamlining environmental review, and offering new tax breaks to developers. The city has focused on revitalizing its downtown by building homes on underutilized commercial and parking lots near rail and bus stations.\n\n\"We weren't tearing down homes. We weren't tearing down existing apartment buildings,\" Ramos-Herbert said in an interview this fall with Business Insider. \"We were just leveraging underutilized sites and catalyzing them through the development.\"\n\nThe new homes don't just impact New Rochelle's 85,000 residents. They have implications for the entire region, which is suffering from one of the most severe housing shortages in the country. New York City relies on its suburbs to house a big portion of its workers and absorb a steady stream of people leaving the five boroughs.\n\nWhile the Big Apple builds less housing per capita than most other major cities in the US, many of its suburbs have an even more dismal record. Between 2010 and 2021, the New York suburbs approved just 13 new homes for every 1,000 residents — about half the rate of the Big Apple.\n\nThere's been some opposition to all the new construction in New Rochelle among locals. There are concerns about traffic, lack of parking, and noise from construction sites. But her constituents also worry that the shiny towers are being filled with transplants, rather than New Rochelle locals in need of affordable housing.\n\nThe mayor said that gentrification concerns are overblown. She noted that 22% of the residents in the new housing are from New Rochelle, and 21% are from surrounding towns in Westchester County. That's compared to 33% who've come from New York City. The new units have given locals a smaller home to downsize to, or a way to shorten their commute by living within walking distance of an Amtrak and Metro-North rail station, she said.\n\n\"These are not strangers. These are our friends. These are your kids' friends,\" she said. \"These are your parents.\"\n\nThe city has been hailed as a model for communities that need to boost housing production amid severe affordability challenges. New Rochelle isn't alone in the region — Jersey City has also built housing at a rapid clip in recent years, becoming another model for YIMBYs to point to.\n\nRamos-Herbert's advice to other cities and communities: start by building transit-oriented development on underutilized commercial plots.\n\nShe also touted the critical income the new housing and residents bring in for the city through property taxes and sales tax, allowing it to invest in infrastructure and programs that benefit everyone. She pointed to the $100 million renovation of the city's train station and the transformation of a highway that divides a historically Black neighborhood into a linear park and local road.\n\n\"You can only tax so much,\" she said. \"We have to kind of create, ensure, proactive creation of alternative revenue streams to support us.\"",

    "title": "'Every day something's coming down the pipe': How the CEO of Booking Holdings responds to a crisis",
    "description": "Booking Holdings CEO Glenn Fogel told Business Insider that the company's experience navigating crises helps it respond to new challenges.",
    "fullText": "Many companies have navigated recent economic and geopolitical uncertainties — but the CEO of travel conglomerate Booking Holdings has faced a steady stream of crises over the last two decades.\n\nTo name a few: the dot-com bubble, 9/11, the 2008 market crash, SARS-1, volcanoes, tsunamis, the pandemic, tariffs, and various wars. CEO Glenn Fogel told Business Insider there's something happening in the world every day.\n\n\"Every day something's coming down the pipe,\" Fogel said.\n\nPart of dealing with a crisis involves planning in advance whenever possible. For example, Fogel explained that when tensions started to heat up between Russia and Ukraine, a region where the company operates, they began to prepare contingency plans \"just in case.\"\n\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine became public just hours after the company's earnings call in February 2022. As the situation developed, Booking Holdings supported employees abroad and navigated expected sanctions. That led to the company's decision to suspend travel services in Russia and Belarus in March 2022, the company said.\n\nFogel, who's been with the company for over 25 years, isn't a stranger to navigating complicated situations. He outlined his crisis response approach, starting with the people he keeps on speed dial to how he manages stress.\n\nWhen a crisis arises, Fogel said the first people he contacts are the company's executive officers, including the general counsel, chief financial officer, and chief HR officer.\n\nNext, he works to identify the problem and which part of the business it affects. As a global travel conglomerate, Fogel said issues can impact different regions in different ways.\n\nThe CEO added that the company's long history of navigating challenges has helped it respond effectively when new problems arise. He said he reminds himself that there is an end to every crisis. For example, with COVID, he said he didn't know when a vaccine would come out, but he knew one eventually would.\n\n\"It helps you've already been through a lot before,\" Fogel said. \"It's not the first rodeo.\"\n\nWhen it comes to managing the stress of the job, Fogel said he practices meditation.\n\n\"I'd like to do it every day,\" Fogel said.\n\nHe said his other non-negotiable is exercise, which he always does before work nearly every day. Fogel does light weightlifting year-round and swims in the summer.\n\nEven when he's traveling — which is more often than he's home, he said — he makes time for a workout at his hotel, squeezing in email responses during lower-intensity sessions.",

    "title": "Corporate types are clamoring for a new kind of plastic surgery using dead people's fat",
    "description": "Corporate types are waiting weeks for — and spending big on — alloClae, which cuts out the recovery time typically associated with body enhancements.",
    "fullText": "In his plush Upper East Side office earlier this year, Dr. Sachin Shridharani was at work on a patient's breasts: applying a local anesthesia, making an incision, ensuring the final result sat just right.\n\nThrough it all, his patient — an executive — had her AirPods in. She was on a conference call with a client, Shridharani told Business Insider. Less than two hours after she walked in, she popped up, checked out her new physique, and dashed off to her office.\n\nAs recently as a year ago, a typical boob job would have involved general anesthesia and a multiday recovery.\n\nBut Shridharani was using alloClae, a new product from manufacturer Tiger Aesthetics that's becoming increasingly popular with patients eager to look their best in the boardroom without undergoing general anesthesia or taking days off for recovery.\n\nRather than relying on an implant or a patient's own body fat to add volume to hips or augment breasts, alloClae — which can cost as much as $100,000 per procedure — uses donor fat from a cadaver as a first-of-its-kind body filler.\n\n\"People are paying for the convenience,\" Shridharani, who has done more than 50 procedures with alloClae and was part of its trial, said. \"It's about not having the downtime, not needing more aggressive procedures, not having an anesthetic.\"\n\nBusiness Insider spoke to a half dozen plastic surgeons, largely based in New York and California, who, together, have completed around 75 procedures with alloClae since it became available earlier this year. They described wealthy executives and corporate types clamoring for the product, booking 6 a.m. visits so they could make it to work by 7, and using the filler to look better in their suits — work, not swim, that is. Demand for alloClae has outpaced supply, resulting in a shortage and backlog of appointments.\n\nWhile many of their alloClae patients are high-ranking professionals looking for a quick zhuzh, there are several other reasons people opt for the product. Some lack sufficient body fat for a typical transfer collected through liposuction. Others don't want the loose skin that can be associated with lipo. Some simply don't want to deal with anesthesia.\n\nTake Gretchen Seal, the 57-year-old CFO at global telecommunications company Convo Relay, who got alloClae in September to smooth out the edge of a breast implant and used extra product to fill out hip dips. The numbing took longer than the procedure itself, which clocked in under 40 minutes, she said.\n\n\"I got in my car, and I drove straight home from the procedure, and I went to work,\" Seal said.\n\nEven with the hip enhancement, she spent the afternoon sitting comfortably at her desk.\n\nThe rise in GLP-1s has contributed to the alloClae fervor. It's not only Ozempic face — it's deflated Ozempic boobs, hips, butt.\n\nShridharani has male patients who have lost weight on the likes of Ozempic, only to find they don't quite fill out their suits the way they used to.\n\n\"In their own words, 'I've got no ass,'\" he said. \"'My trousers look like they're falling off.'\"\n\nIn a workforce that prioritizes appearances — studies have shown more attractive people get paid more — alloClae is becoming the C-suite's secret weapon.\n\nalloClae is part of a larger boom in less-invasive cosmetic procedures.\n\nThe annual number of minimally invasive procedures, from Botox to lip fillers, is growing faster than surgical cosmetic procedures, reaching over 28 million last year, according to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.\n\n\"It was all about the lunchtime Botox procedure,\" Caroline Van Hove, the president of Tiger Aesthetics, said. \"That is still the appeal of medically aesthetic products that are minimally invasive, meaning you have little downtime.\"\n\nTiger Aesthetics, which also provides implants and traditional fillers, began offering alloClae to a select group of doctors in the fall of 2024, followed by a soft rollout to a few hundred surgeons this past spring, and a full launch that's planned early next year, Van Hove said. The company didn't disclose how many patients have used the product.\n\nWhile alloClae comes from a cadaver, the product is less macabre than you may think, and even patients who may be turned off by the whole dead body thing typically come around to it, Dr. Bob Basu, the president of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, said.\n\nWhen individuals donate their bodies for science, such as organ donations, tissue banks often collect abdominal fat cells. Tiger Aesthetics purchases that fat, screens it for diseases, purifies it, and processes it. By the end, it looks like clumpy butter in a syringe.\n\nThe process means Tiger Aesthetics is \"at the mercy of donated tissue,\" Van Hove said. The company aims to increase its intake of donor fat as it expands its manufacturing facilities and is exploring ways to improve tissue yields, she said.\n\n\"As of the beginning of 2026, we'll be producing a ton more alloClae so that we can service the real demand that's out there,\" Van Hove said.\n\nalloClae is regulated by the FDA. Van Hove said the approval process differs from that of implants or medications like Botox, as it's sold under a different designation.\n\nWhile other products that use donor fat exist, alloClae is unique in its composition and the volume in which it is administered. Most patients use between 50 and 100 CCs, Van Hove said, though doctors that Business Insider spoke with have used as much as 550 CCs on a patient. By comparison, Renuva, a donor fat product made by MTF Biologics, is typically dispensed in much smaller quantities and used on the face. (alloClae is not recommended for the face.)\n\nalloClae's convenience comes at a cost, depending on how much donor fat you want.\n\nDoctors said the procedures, including the doctor's fees and the price of the alloClae itself, can cost a customer between $10,000 and $100,000. If a patient gets 100 or 200 CCs — enough for a slight contour of the hip or filling out of the breast — the cost is pretty much in line with the cost of a typical fat transfer, Shridharani said. More than that, the steep cost of alloClae quickly adds up.\n\nWhere a typical breast augmentation with an implant at an upscale office like Shridharani's would start at $15,000, a minor breast adjustment using alloClae starts at $12,000 and could exceed $30,000 depending on the desired volume.\n\n\"The thing that shocks me a little bit is just how expensive the product is, but still the willingness of patients to pay for it,\" said San Francisco-based plastic surgeon Dr. David Sieber, who hasn't yet injected alloClae but has patients waiting for the product.\n\nThat willingness comes even without long-term, proven results.\n\nSo far, the doctors who spoke with Business Insider have said the initial results are promising, but as Basu said, there's been no three- or five-year follow-up yet.\n\nThe procedures he has done with alloClae are all \"subtle refinements,\" he said. \"It is not go big or go home.\"\n\nDouglas Steinbrech, who has medical practices for men in New York City, Beverly Hills, and Chicago, has a term he uses at the office: \"C-level surgery.\" C as in C-suite — and among that crowd, alloClae has been graded A+.\n\n\"The CEOs, COOs, CCOs that don't want to be away from the boardroom,\" Steinbrech told Business Insider. He has primarily had men get alloClae put in their shoulders and chests.\n\n\"They have to go to a lot of meetings that just pop up, and they cannot control when they're going to happen. They can't just clear their schedule to recover for a surgery,\" he added.\n\nOften, patients return to the office the same day as their procedure, or get the injection in the afternoon and go back the next morning.\n\nFor Seal, the CFO, liposuction was never a viable option because she doesn't have enough fat to transfer. When she learned that a breast lift surgery to fix her implant would necessitate weeks without getting on a plane to avoid blood clots, she knew it would never work with her job.\n\n\"My schedule changes so much,\" she said. \"I hop on planes to Silicon Valley, I go to New York, Washington.\"\n\nThat's when her plastic surgeon suggested alloClae. If she could bear the monthlong wait, she could get 100 CCs of the product — and none of the downtime.\n\n\"It worked beautifully,\" she said. \"I feel much more confident.\"\n\nDoctors say patients now come in asking for it by name — though it can be hard to find. Van Hove said the product is sold out until the end of January.\n\nBut good things come to those who wait. Dr. Adam Schaffner, who has had dozens of patients express interest in alloClae, was celebrating on the day he spoke to Business Insider — 400 CCs of the product had just been delivered to his New York City office.",

    "description": "Baz Costello, 48, plans to start his own company after struggling to find a tech job. He said one employer said he was \"too senior.\"",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Baz Costello, 48, who lives in Brighton and Hove, UK. He recently decided to start his own company after growing frustrated with his job search. The following has been edited for brevity and clarity.\n\nI was a consultant for a big digital consultancy up until November last year. I worked there as both a product lead and was also the chair of the neurodiversity employee resource group.\n\nAt the start of this year, I went back to contracting, and then I learned I had prostate cancer. It was stage one, and I was on active monitoring for six months. I did some more contracting up until July, when I was told I needed to have treatment. So, I had treatment, and all the signs were good. In August, I thought, \"OK, I can start looking to go back to work.\"\n\nI spoke to some recruitment agencies and public-sector IT consultancies I had worked with before, and one of the things I picked up from that — and from searching on job boards — was that the number of roles had decreased.\n\nWhen it comes to looking for work, LinkedIn becomes your daily go-to tool. For someone with ADHD, it's a double-edged sword. You can set up filters and get told when new jobs are coming up. But it's also this meandering pathway of links that you can disappear down for hours and hours. It can become another doomscrolling mechanism. I'm guilty of doing a lot of that.\n\nI noticed a slow but steady increase in posts about \"I've been out of work for six months\" and \"I'm going to have to sell my house. I don't know how I'm going to look after my kids.\" The negativity — it impacts you.\n\nAt one point, I got a message on LinkedIn from a recruiter who worked for a digital-transformation company who said, \"We think you'd be suited for this role.\" It was for a senior project manager. I had two video interviews. Both went really well, but one of the things I noticed was that executives were a lot younger than me.\n\nI then got an email back asking to meet for 30 minutes with the practice lead. It felt like a check for cultural fit. She seemed to be a bit younger than me. We seemed to hit off pretty well. We talked about what I wanted from the role and what I could offer. Then, a couple of days later, the company said, \"You're too senior.\"\n\nYou cannot discriminate against someone because of their age, but it happens in myriad ways. \"Too senior\" is one of them. So is \"too much experience.\" I asked for feedback and was told, \"I wasn't sure that this would be fulfilling for you.\" I thought, \"How condescending. You approached me about this role, and I've read the job description, and we spoke at length about the role with three people. Not once have I said, 'This is beneath me.'\"\n\nAgeism is hidden in things like \"This is a dynamic, fast-paced work environment\" or \"This is a work-hard, play-hard environment.\" You take that to mean that on Friday afternoon, when we finish early, and all go down the pub, we don't want people who have to go pick up their kids. It's hidden, but it's still there.\n\nI'm 48. The problem is I look older. I'm Father Christmas in training. It's gotten to the point where I've had interviews and thought, \"Should I dye my hair? Should I wear a hat? Should I do something to try to look younger? Experience shouldn't be something you have to hide.\n\nI'm going to start my own thing. I have a concept for an app. I've been speaking with some non-executive directors and entrepreneurial advisors, getting advice and putting a strategy together. I have a background in product and technology. I can just bloody do this myself.\n\nI'm coming off LinkedIn because I need a bit more positivity. The promise I've made to myself is that the day I return, my first post will be, \"I am the founder of this thing, and I've come back to recruit. If you're too old, I want your experience. If you're too neurodiverse, I want your alternative perspective.\"\n\nDo you have a story to share about your job search? Contact this reporter at tparadis@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "TikTok's new US joint venture will hand over national-security related tasks to its partners, while ByteDance holds onto key business lines.",
    "fullText": "Is TikTok really selling its US business? Kind of.\n\nTikTok has reached an agreement that would give it a new set of owners in the US as part of a joint-venture agreement. Larry Ellison's Oracle, Abu Dhabi investment firm MGX, and private-equity firm Silver Lake are all coming on as managing investors in the US spin-off.\n\nBut how much influence will these investors have over the money-making side of the business? Not much, according to an internal memo TikTok CEO Shou Chew sent to employees on Thursday, viewed by Business Insider.\n\nThe new investors will focus on national security-related tasks, such as data management and algorithm training, while TikTok's current owner, ByteDance, will remain in charge of key business lines, including e-commerce and advertising.\n\nHere's what Chew told staff about the arrangement:\n\nAs laid out by Chew, TikTok's new investors aren't going to be in the driver's seat on core business lines like TikTok Shop or ad sales, even if they may still participate in the profits of the business. TikTok global, which will remain under ByteDance, will still run the show.\n\n\"Advertisers will continue to connect with global audiences with no impact,\" Chew also wrote in the memo.\n\nThe setup, which focuses a lot more on national security-related concerns than business tasks, may be why the White House said in September the deal would be valued at $14 billion, far lower than the $50 billion estimate from Morningstar analysts in June. My colleague Peter Kafka previously dug into the TikTok valuation question.\n\nIn the proposed structure of the deal, which Chew said should close in late January, Oracle, Silver Lake, and MGX will get a combined 45% stake in the US joint venture. Affiliates of existing ByteDance investors will grab around 30% ownership, and an unnamed group of new investors will take 5%.\n\nByteDance will maintain ownership of just under 20% of the US business, but retain oversight of the rest of the world and manage TikTok US's e-commerce, advertising, and marketing strategies.\n\nThat sounds like a pretty good setup for a company that spent much of 2024 and 2025 fighting to keep its US business alive after Congress passed a law forcing it to sell its US app or face a potential ban.\n\nThe question of who will actually be in charge of different parts of the business is paramount to employees at TikTok and ByteDance. Will they get a new boss or organizational structure after an agreement closes?\n\n\"Even though there's a deal, it doesn't say concretely yet what it means for us,\" one TikTok staffer said. They added that they weren't anticipating much change.\n\nTikTok, ByteDance, and MGX did not respond to requests for comment. Oracle and Silver Lake declined to comment.",

    "title": "AI layoffs could far outpace new jobs — past economic shocks reveal how fast that can fuel unrest, professor says",
    "description": "London Business School professor Ekaterina Abramova said that rapid AI disruption could outpace institutions and destabilize societies.",
    "fullText": "A historic labor shock may be about to hit the job market.\n\nThat's according to London Business School professor Ekaterina Abramova.\n\nShe said AI is advancing so quickly that it could trigger mass layoffs long before new jobs emerge to replace them — a mismatch that has historically fueled social unrest.\n\nAbramova, who studies technology-driven economic transitions, said the past three years of AI advances mark a sharp break from earlier waves of mechanization.\n\nIn past eras — from 18th-century textile automation to late-20th-century manufacturing decline — the impact was mostly gradual and largely contained to individual sectors, she said.\n\nBut AI is different: \"A single AI model can displace thousands of cognitive jobs across multiple industries overnight,\" she told Business Insider.\n\nAbramova expects layoffs to outstrip new job creation over the next five to 10 years, especially without aggressive retraining efforts.\n\nWhile the exact number of AI-related layoffs is unknown, several major companies have already cited AI as a reason to reduce head count or to announce job cuts.\n\nNew AI-related roles often require skills or credentials that many displaced workers lack, Abramova said, and entry-level positions — such as junior developers, analysts, and customer support staff — are already among the most vulnerable.\n\nPeter Orszag, CEO of Lazard and former director of the Office of Management and Budget under President Obama, sees a similar risk.\n\nSpeaking on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" this week, Orszag said that if AI delivers on its promise, there's likely to be a jobs crisis.\n\n\"Labor markets deal well with small problems that happen fast or big problems that happen slow. They do not deal well with big shocks that happen quickly,\" he said.\n\nAbramova said that the social risks extend far beyond unemployment numbers.\n\n\"History shows social strain emerges when the pace of economic change overtakes institutions' capacity to support displaced workers,\" she said.\n\nShe pointed to the UK's Enclosure Acts, which displaced tens of thousands of small farmers from common land, sparking riots and mass migration, and to the 1980s coal pit closures, which wiped out mining communities almost overnight and triggered years of strikes and political upheaval.\n\nBusiness leaders are divided over AI's impact on jobs, with Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei and Ford CEO Jim Farley warning of widespread white-collar displacement, while Elon Musk, JP Morgan's Jamie Dimon, and OpenAI's Sam Altman have predicted varying outcomes, ranging from significant disruption to long-term prosperity.\n\nOthers, such as Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Yann LeCun — Meta's outgoing chief AI scientist — say AI will transform work rather than erase it.\n\n\"It's very likely that the companies that use AI first, that use robotics technology first, will be the most successful first, and they will end up hiring more people,\" Huang said in late October.\n\n\"You're going to lose your job not to somebody — not to a robot, you're going to lose your job to somebody who uses a robot. You're going to lose your job to somebody who uses AI,\" he added.\n\nIf governments and employers fail to prepare, Abramova said she expects widening inequality, persistent unemployment, falling consumer demand, rising political anger, and even expanding surveillance as leaders try to contain discontent.\n\nIn extreme cases, she warned, democratic norms can erode.\n\nBut she also said that the worst outcomes aren't inevitable.\n\nThe alternative is worker-augmenting AI: systems where machines handle data-intensive tasks while humans retain judgment, ethics, and client relationships. That shift will require regulatory incentives that reward firms for responsible oversight, not just rapid headcount reduction.\n\n\"Without major support,\" Orszag said, \"many displaced workers risk long-term underemployment.\"",

    "title": "From McKinsey to PwC, here's how elite consulting firms are racing to hire engineers — and train everyone else in AI",
    "description": "Business Insider spoke to nine executives and industry insiders about how consulting's talent recruitment is changing.",
    "fullText": "AI is pushing consultants to their biggest-ever talent overhaul.\n\nAs firms shift from slide decks and advisory work to multi-year AI-driven transformation projects, the profile of the ideal consultant at firms like Boston Consulting Group, McKinsey, and PwC is changing.\n\n\"Going to a client and purely proposing an army of consultants doesn't really work anymore,\" Gert De Geyter, a former AI lead at Deloitte US, told Business Insider.\n\nInstead of the \"pure traditional consultant,\" firms are now looking for a blend of \"generalists and technical experts,\" said De Geyter, who left the firm in July to join AI startup Teragonia.\n\nBusiness Insider spoke to nine executives and industry insiders to understand how consulting firms are hiring, retraining, and redefining their workforces to meet the moment.\n\nThe work that consultants do is changing. Straight advisory projects are being replaced with building, implementing, and maintaining tools for companies, requiring technology expertise over research skills.\n\nHiring data reveals how aggressively top firms have been expanding their technologist ranks. Accenture's latest annual report shows it added nearly 40,000 AI and data professionals in the last two years. They now account for roughly 10% of its global head count. EY has added 61,000 technologists since 2023, according to its latest annual report.\n\nAt McKinsey, the \"AI engineer\" is the fastest-growing non-entry-level role, followed by procurement officer, data scientist, and software engineer, according to workforce intelligence company Revelio Labs.\n\nAt Boston Consulting Group, software engineers, frontend developers, and Python developers are the fastest-growing entry-level roles.\n\nBCG, which brought on 1,000 employees last year, has ramped up hiring technologists since launching its tech and AI arm, BCG X, in late 2022.\n\n\"We're essentially building a tech company inside a consulting firm,\" said Sylvain Duranton, Global Leader of BCG X. \"Our job has always been to help companies transform. But tech has become so critical to transformation that we needed to have a grip on it ourselves.\"\n\nIts regular consulting division is also adopting a more tech-centric mentality.\n\nScott Wilder, a BCG partner and managing director, told Business Insider that a new team, called \"forward deployed consultants,\" is rising through the ranks. It takes inspiration from a software engineering role popularized by Palantir, Wilder said.\n\nThese consultants are vibe-coding and building tools on client projects, he said. When one of these tools is a hit, it goes back to the R&D team and becomes a broader tool that everyone can use.\n\nFor firms like McKinsey and BCG, the must-have hire in the AI era isn't a pure engineer or a pure consultant — it's someone who can move between both worlds.\n\n\"What we want to be able to do is find those people that actually have a propensity to either be this great McKinsey consultant, and or a great technologist, and then groom them to be both,\" Alex Singla, a senior partner at McKinsey who co-leads its AI arm, QuantumBlack, told Business Insider.\n\nHe added that candidates also want hybrid roles: Many don't want to spend years building products for a cloud company like AWS, nor do they want to be traditional consultants.\n\nSingla said McKinsey is looking for \"5Xers — they're deep in one thing, but can do three or four different things well.\"\n\nQuantumBlack, with its 1,700-person team, drives all of McKinsey's AI initiatives, which account for 40% of the firm's work, but McKinsey's technical talent isn't limited to that group, Singla said. There are about 3,500 people building internal technology for McKinsey, and another 4,000 to 5,000 consultants who are leading the technical work from the business side, but don't necessarily have technical expertise.\n\nThe consulting talent landscape has been in flux since the pandemic, when a surge in demand prompted top firms to aggressively staff up. As that boom faded and demand for advisory work slowed, many firms found themselves overstaffed, triggering layoffs and a more selective approach to hiring.\n\nAmid the shifting market, the traditional pyramid model — built on large cohorts of junior consultants — started to recalibrate as firms focused on roles that deliver value over manpower. That focus has only sharpened with the rise of AI, prompting firms to invest heavily in upskilling their existing workforces.\n\n\"Everyone is reckoning with the fact that AI has exploded onto the scene,\" Saurabh Sarbaliya, PwC's AI Lead, told Business Insider.\n\n\"The demand for people who can make AI work in the enterprise is only going to grow — but there just aren't enough experts. So you have to focus on upskilling your existing workforce,\" he said.\n\nAt KPMG, Sam Gloede, the firm's global trusted AI leader, said it is prioritizing upskilling over hiring.\n\n\"There is not a massive change in our workforce,\" Gloede said. \"It's just a focus on upskilling, literacy, and learning.\"\n\nEY is taking a similar approach and prioritizing the AI capabilities of its employees, Imgard Naudin ten Cate, EY's global leader of talent acquisition, told Business Insider.\n\nIn October, EY held a two-week learning event to teach employees to build AI agents for use in their day-to-day work. The firm has also rolled out 15-hour courses on topics including AI engineering, applied AI, and AI compliance.\n\nNearly 100,000 employees — roughly a quarter of the workforce — have earned a digital \"AI badge\" for completing one of the courses, said Simon Brown, EY's global learning and development leader. The initiative has been \"a phenomenal way at scale to build deep AI knowledge,\" he added.\n\nTechnologist roles are in high demand, but don't expect a team of hoodie-wearing Silicon Valley types when your company hires consultants. Most in the industry are still generalists with strong problem-solving and communication skills — and they'll likely show up in a suit.\n\nEven as firms hire more technologists, most consulting work still doesn't require deep engineering expertise. Traditional consulting roles at top firms are still on the rise, growing from 250,000 globally in 2022 to 340,000 in 2024, according to Revelio Labs.\n\n\"A lot of the clients are still just dipping their toes in the AI pond, so over-engineering solutions for them doesn't work,\" said de Geyter, the former AI lead at Deloitte US. \"It's a lot more helpful that someone supports them with setting up the right data governance so they can get ready for AI solutions down the line.\"\n\nA senior software engineer at Deloitte, who requested anonymity as they are not permitted to speak to the media, told Business Insider that the technical literacy of most employees is improving, but remains in a \"very nascent state.\"\n\n\"They're looking less for people who know the inners of how these black box models work or could train one themselves, and more at people who can quickly leverage them for a specific solution set,\" the person said.\n\nStill, they warned that the current skill level poses a strategic risk: \"We can't let it continue for too long.\"\n\nJim Rowan, head of AI at Deloitte US, told Business Insider that its employees have \"the latest technologies and certifications to effectively work with machines and unlock even more impactful business outcomes for clients.\" Deloitte is not just hiring more data engineers and technologists, but \"actively investing\" in upskilling its workforce, Rowan said.\n\nSeveral leaders told Business Insider that soft skills are becoming more relevant now that AI can perform specific quantitative tasks.\n\n\"When we get asked a question of what we are looking for when we recruit, the core fundamental thing is actually attitude,\" Niale Cleobury, KPMG's AI workforce lead, said. Communication, collaboration, and agile learning — \"the sort of things AI can't really do\" — are the standout qualities, he said.\n\nMcKinsey is still active on college campuses recruiting undergraduates, MBAs, and PhDs, said Kate Smaje, McKinsey's global leader of technology and AI.\n\nIn its screening process, McKinsey emphasizes elements of judgment and conceptual thinking in problem-solving, resilience, and the ability to learn quickly.\n\nThe ability to build relationships and the core EQ leadership qualities can be \"fairy dust\" on top of what you can do analytically that will now set you apart, said Smaje.\n\n\"What we really hire for is voracious learners, people who are curious about the world and have the ability to learn, unlearn, and relearn,\" she said. \"Those are the people we really want.\"\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "A source in the Security Service of Ukraine told Business Insider that the attack was carried out more than 1,240 miles away.",
    "fullText": "Ukrainian forces used long-range drones to strike an oil tanker said to be part of Russia's \"shadow fleet\" in the Mediterranean Sea for the first time, a security source told Business Insider on Friday.\n\nThe attack, carried out over 1,240 miles from Ukrainian territory, represents a dramatic expansion of Kyiv's push to target Russia's vast energy sector, a key source of revenue fueling its war machine.\n\nUkraine had previously limited its attacks to land-based targets, such as oil refineries and port infrastructure. In recent weeks, though, it has begun striking tankers in the Black Sea and facilities in the Caspian Sea — and now it's hitting targets in the Mediterranean.\n\nA source in the Security Service of Ukraine, the SBU, called the drone attack an \"unprecedented special operation\" that targeted and critically damaged the tanker Qendil. The source was only authorized to speak on the condition of anonymity to discuss military developments.\n\nThe SBU source said the Qendil wasn't carrying any oil cargo at the time of the attack, so there isn't any risk to the environment. Footage shows several explosions on the exterior of the tanker.\n\nPublicly available ship-tracking data show that the Qendil was sailing under the flag of Oman. It's unclear when the attack took place; the vessel last reported its location on Friday sailing off the coast of Libya in the eastern Mediterranean.\n\nNeither Russia's defense ministry nor its US embassy immediately responded to a request for comment on the attack.\n\nUkraine has attacked at least four tankers, including the Qendil, that have been identified as belonging to the \"shadow fleet\" since late November. There are hundreds of vessels in the fleet, which Moscow relies on to transport oil and circumvent sanctions on its energy exports.\n\nRussia used the Qendil \"to circumvent sanctions and earn money that went to the war against Ukraine,\" the SBU source said in translated remarks shared with Business Insider, calling the ship a \"legitimate target\" for the SBU.\n\nThe enemy must understand that Ukraine will not stop and will beat him anywhere in the world, wherever he is,\" they added.\n\nSince August, Ukraine has stepped up its use of long-range drone strikes to target Russian energy infrastructure in an effort to squeeze a key source of revenue for Moscow. While the campaign initially focused on land-based facilities, Kyiv has recently expanded it to maritime targets, hitting oil tankers in the Black and Mediterranean seas and striking three oil platforms in the Caspian Sea.\n\nThe expansion to maritime targets appears to reflect a shift in Kyiv's strategy as it continues to press its international partners to be more aggressive in clamping down on Russian oil exports.\n\nUkrainian officials have described the ongoing deep-strike campaign as \"long-range\" sanctions against Moscow. These operations have been a bright spot for Kyiv as it faces incremental — but costly — Russian gains on the battlefield.",

    "fullText": "Who's grabbing control of TikTok's US assets?\n\nOn Thursday, TikTok told staffers it had signed a deal to form a joint venture for its US business with a group of investors, according to an internal memo sent by CEO Shou Chew, which was viewed by Business Insider. The company expects the deal to close in late January, per the memo.\n\nThree managing investors will each hold a 15% stake in the new venture: Oracle, private equity firm Silver Lake, and Abu Dhabi-based investment firm MGX.\n\nFive percent of the US company will go to an unnamed group of new investors, while ByteDance, TikTok's owner, will maintain a 19.9% minority stake — the maximum allowed by the divest-or-ban law that spurred TikTok's sale. The remaining 30.1% will be controlled by an undisclosed group of existing ByteDance investors, according to the memo.\n\nIn September, President Donald Trump said Larry Ellison and his company, Oracle, would be involved in a $14 billion deal to buy TikTok's US business. At the time, Trump mentioned billionaires Rupert Murdoch and Michael Dell would also play a role, but it is unclear if they are involved in the current deal.\n\nOracle, which currently works with TikTok on data security, is expected to continue to be its \"trusted security partner\" tasked with safeguarding \"sensitive US user data,\" Chew wrote in his memo to staffers.\n\nTikTok's new US owners will retrain the content recommendation algorithm on US user data \"to ensure the content feed is free from outside manipulation,\" per the memo.\n\nTikTok did not respond to requests for comment. The White House referred Business Insider to TikTok. A spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry, when asked about the deal, referred press to \"competent authorities for anything specific,\" noting that \"China's position on TikTok is consistent and clear.\"\n\nHere are the key players in TikTok's US business going forward:\n\nSoftware giant Oracle will take a 15% stake in TikTok's US joint venture, according to the memo viewed by Business Insider.\n\nPrior to the recent deal, Oracle was already working closely with TikTok's US Data Security division (USDS). Oracle has stored US TikTok users' data for years as a safeguard for potential data leaks.\n\nLarry Ellison, who is also a financial participant in a bidding war for Warner Bros. Discovery's business, is the chairman and cofounder of Oracle and a longtime Trump ally.\n\nMGX is a state-owned investment firm in Abu Dhabi.\n\nAccording to the internal memo, it will also take a 15% stake in the new TikTok entity as one of three managing investors.\n\nSheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, a member of Abu Dhabi's royal ruling family, is the firm's chairman. The fund participated in OpenAI's $6.6 billion investment round in 2024.\n\nMGX did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nSilver Lake is a tech-focused private equity firm.\n\nThe firm will take a 15% stake in the new TikTok entity, per the internal memo.\n\nIts current investments include Klarna, Carta, Dell Technologies, Genies, and Waymo, per the firm's website. Previous investments include Airbnb, Twitter, and Tesla.\n\nEgon Durban and Greg Mondre both act as co-CEO and managing partner at the private equity firm.\n\nSilver Lake declined to comment.\n\nAccording to the memo, \"affiliates of certain existing investors\" in ByteDance will hold a combined 30.1% of the new entity.\n\nPrivate equity giant KKR and venture capital firms, such as Sequoia Capital and SoftBank, have previously invested in ByteDance. It's not yet clear which of these investors will retain shares in the new US entity.\n\nSequoia Capital did not respond to a request for comment. KKR and SoftBank declined to comment.\n\nWhile 95% of ownership in the new TikTok US joint venture will fall under Oracle, Silver Lake, MGX, ByteDance, and its earlier investors, the remaining 5% stake will pass to an unnamed group of \"new investors,\" per TikTok's memo.\n\nTrump previously said that billionaires Michael Dell and Rupert Murdoch may be involved in the TikTok deal, so it's possible that they could fall within this mystery investor set.",

    "description": "Allyson Lopez had been hoping for business to bounce back at her dress shop in Chicago's Little Village neighborhood, which specializes in ballgowns for",
    "fullText": "CHICAGO, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Allyson Lopez had been hoping for business to bounce back at her dress shop in Chicago's Little Village neighborhood, which specializes in ballgowns for quinceaneras, a coming-of-age ritual in many Latino communities celebrating a girl's 15th birthday. Instead, this week brought the return of the federal immigration raids that have emptied the normally vibrant streets.\n\nThe first phase of the Department of Homeland Security deportation campaign, named \"Operation ​Midway Blitz,\" racked up over 4,200 arrests across the city in under three months. The operation rattled Chicago, but for Little Village, the working-class Mexican neighborhood that was repeatedly targeted, the effect has been catastrophic.\n\nThe return of roving U.S. ‌Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino on Tuesday in a large convoy of agents in camouflage, some with assault rifles peeking through car windows, was met by jeers and whistles from dozens of protesters who livestreamed the encounters on social media.\n\nAt Estela's Bridal, a second-generation family business, Lopez specializes in custom designs, which sell for ‌an average of $1,000. It can take 16 hours to make a dress, fitting the shimmering fabrics to size, and adding embroidered flowers, rhinestones and sequins. She said she lost 90% of her clients during the first wave of arrests as people decided to stay home out of fear of immigration agents.\n\nBUSINESS STRUGGLES TO MAKE RENT\n\n\"We’re going to suffer again as businesses,\" Lopez said. “We didn’t even make the rent this month, so it’s scary.\"\n\nA DHS spokesperson did not respond when asked about the impact of the raids on businesses.\n\nEven before Bovino's return, Little Village had been deflated by the raids.\n\nThe tourists who came to the \"Mexican Capital of the Midwest\" to eat tacos, sweet bread and tamales and to shop for quinceanera dresses, pinatas and Mexican chiles disappeared. Dozens of neighborhood residents were detained or deported, community leaders said. Others went ⁠into hiding.\n\n\"It's like those old Western movies where all you see is tumbleweeds blowing in ‌the breeze,” said Roxana, a 42-year-old hair salon owner from Guatemala. She declined to share her last name or immigration status out of fear of retaliation from immigration agents.\n\nIn her empty hair salon, with half the chairs wrapped in plastic, Roxana pulled back her neatly styled bangs to reveal patches of thinning hair, which she said started falling out from the stress of an 80% drop in revenue since ‍the start of the immigration enforcement campaign.\n\nAs the Border Patrol convoy descended on Little Village again this week, Roxana shuddered. The salon was open, but devoid of customers.\n\n\"They've broken into the neighborhood again,\" she said. \"It's definitely shocked and devastated us because it wasn't something that we were expecting.\"\n\nA NEIGHBORHOOD'S COMMERCIAL HEART\n\nRoxana's salon sits near the stucco arch that marks the beginning of 26th Street, a two-mile-long strip of shops, bakeries and restaurants that has become the second-most profitable shopping corridor in the city, according to the Little Village Chamber of Commerce. Many business owners said their savings dwindled ​after customers, including people who are in the U.S. legally, stopped visiting for fear of immigration officers.\n\nBefore the immigration crackdown, the shops selling elaborate ballgowns, glittering tiaras and satin flower bouquets, were joyous places, where girls giggled and twirled in their dresses ‌to the satisfaction of their mothers, shop owners said.\n\nBut anxiety over venturing outside – as well as fears that big parties could become targets for immigration enforcement – have hit Little Village’s quinceanera shops hard.\n\nTwo shop owners said they lost 90% of their revenue to the initial stages of Midway Blitz.\n\nEvelyn Flores, the owner of the Alborada quinceanera store, said she laid off seven staff members. “I can't sleep at night right now, and during the day I'm always freaking out.”\n\nMaria Ortiz, who owns a shop selling party supplies, said there are days when nobody walks into her store.\n\nFor one family, the aftershocks of the fall raids have lingered for weeks. Kamila, 15, said she has been afraid to leave her apartment other than to go to school after her cousin was detained by immigration agents in November while on his way to a job as a rug installer. He had been living in the U.S. for 18 years without legal status.\n\n“I’m scared. We can’t step outside because they might be waiting for us,\" she said.\n\nAsked for ⁠comment, Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, said: “There’s no reason to be afraid of law enforcement, unless you are breaking ​the law.\"\n\nThe cousin’s small apartment sits mostly as he left it - the bed unmade and his fluffy cream-colored dog, Peluchin, scampering through the apartment. Every day ​since his owner was detained, Peluchin pushes the dusty window blinds aside with his small snout to stare for hours at the street, waiting for him to return, a neighbor who comes by to walk him said.\n\n“All his dreams, all his effort, all his work – it’s here, empty,” said Sofia, Kamila’s mother and a 47-year-old housekeeper.\n\n“My daughter is 15 years old, she shouldn’t be living like this,” said Sofia, who came ‍to the U.S. from Mexico without legal status and is considering ⁠self-deporting. “There’s not a life here.”\n\nOn a recent afternoon, the Little Village Community Council hummed with overlapping voices as people coordinated school pick-ups, shared videos, and called family members of people who were detained.\n\nThe LVCC president, Baltazar Enriquez, has led local resistance to immigration enforcement, organizing patrols for federal agents and distributing plastic whistles now used across the city to warn of immigration agents in the area.\n\nThe tight-knit nature of “La Villita,” the Spanish name for Little Village, has given residents an ⁠organizing edge as they take to WhatsApp, Facebook and Signal groups to coordinate. Though Little Village has long struggled with bouts of gun violence and has the highest number of gang-related crimes in the city, residents said they felt safe before federal agents came to town.\n\nOther forms of resistance have been quieter – like Vicky Martinez, ‌a 55-year-old resident, who drops off groceries for friends and neighbors who are too scared to go to the store.\n\n\"It just feels like you're in prison. We don't even know what they're gonna throw at us,” ‌Martinez said.",

    "fullText": "Dec 19 (Reuters) - The Chinese unit of Netherlands-based Nexperia has locked in supplies of silicon wafers from local firms to cover its entire 2026 production for one type of power chip, a document showed, after the Dutch firm ​stopped supplying the raw material in a corporate dispute.\n\nThe development will allow the Chinese unit, which declared itself independent of ‌Nexperia's European management two months ago, to continue manufacturing Insulated-Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBT) power chips and modules, switches that regulate current in electric vehicles and industrial equipment.\n\nThe dispute began ‌when the Dutch government took control of Nexperia from its Chinese parent Wingtech in September, citing governance issues. In late October, it suspended supplies of wafers to the Chinese unit, while a Dutch court ordered Wingtech's founder be removed as Nexperia CEO.\n\nBeijing responded by halting exports of Nexperia's finished products, triggering chip shortages for global automakers.\n\nBoth governments relaxed their measures last month, but court fights and an internal battle continue over control ⁠of Nexperia, with China and Wingtech both warning ‌that disruptions could resume without a long-term resolution.\n\nIn a letter sent to its distributors earlier this month and seen by Reuters, Nexperia's China unit said it had locked in wafer production capacity for IGBT products with ‍local suppliers for 2026 and was accelerating verification of wafers from Wingtech's foundry Wingsky Semi to ensure \"abundant supply.\"\n\nThe previously unreported move marks a further supply-chain separation between Nexperia China and its Dutch parent that could lead to a complete split.\n\nNexperia told Reuters that it was not in communication with its Chinese ​subsidiary and the unit showed \"no intention to negotiate a short-term solution to restore the flow of chips to customers.\"\n\nThe company said that ‌IGBT products accounted for about 0.1% of Nexperia total revenue in 2024.\n\nNexperia China did not immediately reply to a request for comment.\n\nBeijing last week called on the Dutch government to implement the consensus they reached on encouraging negotiations between Nexperia and Wingtech and to urge the chipmaker to send representatives to China as soon as possible for talks.\n\nNexperia China has told local distributors wafer inventory at its factory in Dongguan in southern China's Guangdong province is low as supply from the Netherlands is not expected to resume soon, a ⁠person familiar with the matter said.",

    "fullText": "STATESVILLE, N.C. (AP) — A business jet crashed Thursday while trying to return to a North Carolina airport shortly after takeoff, killing all seven people aboard, including retired NASCAR driver Greg Biffle and his family, authorities said.\n\nThe Cessna C550 erupted into a large fire when it hit the ground. It had departed Statesville Regional Airport, about 45 miles (72 kilometers) north of Charlotte, but soon crashed while trying to return and land, the North Carolina State Highway Patrol said.\n\nFlight records show the plane was registered to a company run by Biffle. The cause of the crash wasn't immediately known, nor was the reason for the plane's return to the airport in drizzle and cloudy conditions.\n\nFederal Aviation Administration records show Biffle was rated to fly helicopters and single and multi-engine planes. It wasn't clear if Biffle was piloting the plane at the time of the crash.\n\nBiffle was on the plane with his wife, Cristina, and children Ryder, 5, and Emma, 14, according to the highway patrol and a family statement. Others on the plane were identified as Dennis Dutton, his son Jack, and Craig Wadsworth.\n\n“Each of them meant everything to us, and their absence leaves an immeasurable void in our lives,” the joint family statement said.\n\nBiffle, 55, won more than 50 races across NASCAR’s three circuits, including 19 at the Cup Series level. He also won the Trucks Series championship in 2000 and the Xfinity Series title in 2002.\n\nNASCAR said it was devastated by the news.\n\n“Greg was more than a champion driver; he was a beloved member of the NASCAR community, a fierce competitor, and a friend to so many,” NASCAR said. “His passion for racing, his integrity, and his commitment to fans and fellow competitors alike made a lasting impact on the sport.”\n\nThe plane, bound for Florida, took off from the Statesville airport shortly after 10 a.m., according to tracking data posted by FlightAware.com.\n\nGolfers playing next to the airport were shocked as they witnessed the disaster, even dropping to the ground at the Lakewood Golf Club while the plane was overhead. The ninth hole was covered with debris.\n\n“We were like, ‘Oh my gosh! That’s way too low,’” said Joshua Green of Mooresville. “It was scary.”\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board and the Federal Aviation Administration were investigating.\n\nThe Cessna plane, built in 1981, is a popular mid-sized business jet with an excellent reputation, aviation safety expert Jeff Guzzetti said. It has two engines and typically seats six to eight passengers and two pilots.\n\nIn 2024, Biffle was honored for his humanitarian efforts after Hurricane Helene struck the U.S., even using his personal helicopter to deliver aid to flooded, remote western North Carolina.\n\n“The last time I spoke with Cristina, just a couple of weeks ago, she reached out to ask how she could help with relief efforts in Jamaica. That’s who the Biffles were,\" U.S. Rep. Richard Hudson, a Republican from North Carolina, said.\n\nWadsworth was Biffle's friend and helped him with odd jobs, including delivering supplies to places hit by Hurricane Helene, roommate Benito Howell said.\n\n“He didn’t know how to say no,” Howell said of Wadsworth, who had worked for several NASCAR teams. “He loved everybody. He always tried to help everybody.”\n\nThe joint family statement also spoke about Dutton and his son Jack, saying they were \"deeply loved as well, and their loss is felt by all who knew them.\"\n\nWith 2025 almost over, there have been 1,331 U.S. crashes this year investigated by the NTSB, from two-seat planes to commercial aircraft, compared to a total of 1,482 in 2024.\n\nMajor air disasters around the world in 2025 include the plane-helicopter collision that killed 67 in Washington, the Air India crash that killed 260 in India, and a crash in Russia’s Far East that claimed 48 lives. Fourteen people, including 11 on the ground, died in a UPS cargo plane crash in Kentucky.\n\nRobertson reported from Raleigh, North Carolina. Associated Press writers John Seewer in Toledo, Ohio; Jenna Fryer in Charlotte, North Carolina; Josh Funk in Omaha, Nebraska; Ed White in Detroit; and Sarah Brumfield in Washington contributed to this story.",

    "fullText": "Deal will allow app to continue operating in US as Elizabeth Warren condemns Trump and his ‘billionaire buddies’\n\nTikTok has signed a deal to sell its US business to three American investors – Oracle, Silver Lake and MGX – ensuring the popular social video platform can continue operating in the United States.\n\nThe deal is expected to close on 22 January, according to an internal memo seen by he Associated Press and Reuters. The TikTok chief executive officer, Shou Zi Chew, said in the memo that ByteDance and TikTok have signed binding agreements with the three investors.\n\nThe new TikTok US joint venture will be 50% held by a consortium of new investors, including Oracle, Silver Lake and Abu Dhabi-based MGX with 15% each. Another 30.1% will be held by affiliates of existing ByteDance investors and 19.9% will be retained by ByteDance, according to the memo.\n\nWhite House officials have said Oracle, which was co-founded by Donald Trump’s supporter Larry Ellison, will license a copy of TikTok’s recommendation algorithm as part of the deal, in a partnership that will expand on Oracle’s existing management of TikTok’s trove of data collected about its US users.\n\nEllison’s role in the new ownership of the most popular social media platform in the US has raised concerns about the decreasing share of media firms not under the control of pro-Trump billionaires, with Ellison’s son David now driving wholesale changes at CBS, Elon Musk in control of X, formerly known as Twitter, Mark Zuckerberg overseeing both Instagram and Facebook, and Jeff Bezos owning the Washington Post.\n\n“First Paramount/CBS and now TikTok,” Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic senator from Massachusetts, wrote on Bluesky in response to the news. “Trump wants to hand over even more control of what you watch to his billionaire buddies. Americans deserve to know if the president struck another backdoor deal for this billionaire takeover of TikTok.”\n\nRush Doshi, who coordinated US government policy on China and Taiwan as a Biden National Security Council official, noted that there were “still some questions about who controls the algorithm. They say it will be trained on US data. Great, but has the algorithm been transferred, licensed, or is it still owned and controlled by Beijing – with Oracle merely providing ‘monitoring?’”\n\nThe agreement comes after a long delay. Trump said in September that he had spoken with China’s president over the phone about the deal and he had “a very good talk with president Xi” and “he gave us the go ahead”.\n\nIn October, the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, announced that the US and China had “reached a final deal on TikTok”.\n\nIn 2020, during his first presidency, Trump had threatened to ban TikTok in retaliation for China’s handling of Covid.\n\nCongress later passed a ban of the app over security concerns that was signed into law in April 2024 by Joe Biden. The ban was set to go into effect on 20 January 2025 but implementation was pushed back multiple times by Trump while his administration worked to develop a deal to transfer ownership.\n\nThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.\n\nIf you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.\n\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\n\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

    "fullText": "TikTok reached a deal with a group of investors to form a new joint venture for its US business, according to an internal memo viewed by Business Insider.\n\nThe deal, which TikTok expects to close in January, comes more than a year after Congress passed a law that forced its owner, ByteDance, to divest from its US operations or face a ban, because TikTok was deemed a \"foreign adversary-controlled\" company.\n\nThe new US joint venture will operate independently in areas like US data protection and training its content recommendation algorithm while still connecting to TikTok's global product and business lines like e-commerce and advertising, per the memo from company CEO Shou Chew.\n\nThe announcement is the culmination of a lengthy battle for survival by TikTok, which briefly went dark in the US in January to comply with the divest-or-ban law.\n\nTikTok and ByteDance had sought recourse through the courts, arguing that the law — the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act — violated the First Amendment. In January, the Supreme Court ruled against TikTok and upheld the divest-or-ban law.\n\nSince then, TikTok has been facing a looming deadline to find a US buyer. The app's future remained in limbo for months as the White House repeatedly extended the deadline and administration officials sought to work out a deal.\n\nIn September, President Donald Trump signed an executive order that approved the sale of TikTok's US operation for around $14 billion.\n\nTrump said at the time that Oracle and Larry Ellison would be part of the deal, and Michael Dell and Rupert Murdoch may also be involved. Vice President JD Vance said the buyer group would include \"four or five world-class investors.\"\n\nTikTok did not respond to a request for comment. The White House referred Business Insider to TikTok.",

I booked my business-class ticket for $180.\n\nOut of curiosity, I looked at the pricing for coach seating on the regional Amtrak train, which is 30 minutes slower than the Acela. It was $40.\n\nMy train was scheduled to leave at 10 a.m., but there was a 90-minute delay. Since I was stuck at the station for longer than anticipated, I briefly considered going to the Metropolitan Lounge, an elevated space overlooking the train hall with cozy seating and complimentary refreshments.\n\nFirst-class passengers and those traveling in sleeper accommodations can get into the lounge for free, but other Amtrak riders have to pay $50 to access it.\n\nSince I'd already splurged on the business-class ticket, I decided to skip the lounge and head to the standard waiting room instead, but it was full. I finally settled for a seat on the floor against the wall until it was time to board.\n\nWhen I got in line to board, I was reminded that business class is just a standard ticket on the Amtrak Acela. Unlike business-class rides I've taken that also had coach seating, this trip didn't include the perk of priority boarding.\n\nSoft, cushy, spacious, supportive — these are the words that popped into my head when I settled into my business-class seat. A reclining function and footrest made the ride even more comfortable.\n\nPower outlets, USB ports, and a reading light were all conveniently located on the side of the seat. In front of me was a tray table and a fold-out cupholder.\n\nMost Amtrak trains I've been on have had WiFi, but in my experience, the connection has typically been too weak for much more than a Google search.\n\nI was stoked when the NextGen Acela's 5G WiFi was fast enough to stream YouTube videos without any issues. I passed the time by watching live sessions of my favorite bands.\n\nI've learned to set the bar low for train bathrooms. Stocked toilet paper, soap, and paper towels are not a given. Cleanliness and extra space aren't either. In my experience, some business-class bathrooms are no different from those in coach.\n\nSo I was ecstatic when I stepped inside the lavatory on the NextGen Acela. The automatic door opened into a spotless space that felt big enough for two people to do jumping jacks simultaneously.\n\nI found it aesthetically pleasing too, with bold red accents and trendy touches, from the shelf to the mirror.\n\nI also appreciated the touchless water, soap, and dryer functions on the sink.\n\n\"Amtrak travelers always have their preference,\" an Amtrak representative wrote in an email to Business Insider. \"If they want to experience these premium trains with enhanced amenities, they can. Or, if they prefer convenient and affordable downtown-to-downtown service up and down the Northeast Corridor, Northeast Regional trains offer a comfortable and enjoyable way to travel throughout the Northeast Corridor and points beyond.\"\n\nThe next time I take an Amtrak train, I'll miss the cozy seat, elevated bathroom, high-speed WiFi, and shorter travel time. Still, these perks weren't enough for me to consider Acela's business class to be worth more than quadruple the price of a coach ticket.",

    "fullText": "Palmer Luckey wants you to know he was right all along.\n\nThe outspoken billionaire and new-age god of war is making a fortune selling weapons. His reach extends beyond the range of his powerful artillery though, as he has shifted the narrative around what working in defense tech means.\n\nOnce a somewhat taboo corner of the business world, the success of Luckey's Anduril Industries, along with his no-holds-barred approach to … just about everything, has made him the poster child for tech's new love affair with the military, writes BI's Julia Hornstein.\n\nLuckey's now on a victory lap of sorts as he shepherds the US into a new era where one of the biggest business battlefields is the literal battlefield.\n\nPart of Luckey's appeal in tech circles might be his authenticity.\n\nWhether you love him or hate him, the 33-year-old has stuck to his guns over the years. That's unlike most of his tech peers, who have shifted their businesses and policies to favor whichever political party is in power. (Luckey once said he wrote President Donald Trump a letter when he was 15, encouraging him to run for president.)\n\nAt times, that dedication has come at a cost. Luckey has long claimed he was fired from Meta in 2017 for supporting Trump. Meta denies he left over politics.\n\nBut these days it's all sunshine and rainbows cruise missiles and drones for Luckey.\n\nPalmer Luckey might be the face of defense tech, but he's got plenty of competition.\n\nFirst and foremost, there's more money than ever in the space thanks to the Trump administration leaning into defense spending.\n\nThe latest era of modern warfare is also creating new opportunities. The increased prominence of drones, as evident in the war in Ukraine, has given startups a chance to step up to the plate. It has created an interesting dynamic, with young, agile startups competing with traditional defense contractors.\n\nThe increased competition is largely viewed as a positive for the government, which can benefit from better pricing. The new players and cutting-edge tech are also speeding up processes.\n\nThe Navy said a Palantir-powered AI system for shipbuilding cut a 160-hour job to just 10 minutes. The Army is also enacting a \"fail fast\" approach to weapon development.\n\nMoving at such speed, a staple of Silicon Valley, comes with risks when dealing with such powerful and dangerous tech. A new watchdog report said the US military needs to improve its weapons testing processes.",

    "title": "Starbucks is doubling down on its free bachelor's degree program as enrollment surges 60%",
    "description": "Starbucks' Chief People Officer Sara Kelly spoke to Business Insider about the company's increasingly popular free college program.",
    "fullText": "Starbucks receives more than a million job applications a year, the company's Chief People Officer says one reason is a quietly powerful lure: the promise of a fully-funded bachelor's degree from Arizona State University.\n\nFor Brea Yancey, a barista in Washington state who has worked at the company for eight years, that benefit hasn't just reshaped her future — it reshaped her family's. She enrolled, then inspired her mother, a Starbucks store manager, to join her, turning a workplace perk into a two-generation push toward a goal neither woman thought was financially in reach.\n\n\"I didn't think college was going to be an option because of how much it costs with loans and things like that,\" Yancey, who celebrated her graduation on Monday, told Business Insider. \"I know it's going to make all the difference in the world not having to worry about that.\"\n\nYancey pursued a degree in interdisciplinary arts and performance, with the goal of becoming a music teacher. Her mother graduated last semester with a degree in interdisciplinary studies, concentrating in sales, marketing, and project management.\n\n\"I'm glad that she got to finish school, because that's all she ever wanted, and she stopped originally because she got pregnant with me, but now we finished it together,\" Yancey said.\n\nAs college costs have soared, so has enrollment in Starbucks' College Achievement Plan (SCAP) program, Chief People Officer Sara Kelly told Business Insider. The program, which began in 2014, offers eligible employees 100% upfront tuition coverage for their first bachelor's degree, facilitated through online classes at ASU.\n\n\"Over the last five years, we've seen a 60% increase in participation,\" Kelly said. \"We have 13% of our partners participating as scholars today.\"\n\nThat represents at least one enrolled Starbucks staff member at about 90% of its coffeehouses, Kelly added.\n\nStarbucks isn't the only retail or Fortune 500 employer offering education benefits. Amazon, Walmart, and Chipotle also offer similar programs. However, compared to most programs in the US retail sector, Starbucks doesn't require reimbursement of tuition payments or require students to stay with the company for a certain amount of time after graduation.\n\nYounger students are increasingly questioning the value of a college degree. A May 2024 Deloitte survey found that a third of Gen Z and millennials chose to skip higher education due to rising costs, and the average price of attendance for a student living on campus at an in-state public 4-year institution is $108,584 over 4 years, according to Educationdata — so you can't beat free.\n\n\"This started over 10 years ago, all in service of creating access to education, and the importance of creating access to education,\" Kelly said. \"College is incredibly costly, and so how do we create access to that education for all of our partners? So we're really proud, because we see this as one of the most powerful expressions of our investment in our partners.\"\n\nStarbucks has expanded the SCAP program in recent years, offering access to more than 150 degree pathways, providing enrolled students with a broader range of fields to pursue than in the program's early years. They've also added a \"Pathway to Admission\" support route for partners who don't initially qualify for university admission, allowing them to take preparatory courses and earn their way into ASU. Additionally, a \"plus-one\" benefit is available for eligible military and veteran partners, extending SCAP to a qualifying family member.\n\nThis year, Starbucks introduced new study abroad and coffee education opportunities, offering a hands-on sustainability immersion at Hacienda Alsacia in Costa Rica, where scholars study climate, agronomy, and the future of coffee at their global research and development farm.\n\nOf course, the students aren't the only ones benefiting. The program is a significant retention win for Starbucks. Turnover is at record lows, Kelly said, and baristas who have spoken to Business Insider frequently cite the SCAP program as a reason they've stayed with the company.\n\nThe program also helps to strengthen Starbucks' talent pipeline, as the company has committed to a 90% internal hire rate or fill rate for its retail leadership roles.\n\n\"Our Starbucks college achievement plan partners are part of our pipeline for those management roles, and we're very excited about that,\" Kelly said. \"But do they have to stay with Starbucks? No.\"\n\nStarbucks has never considered adding a retention requirement to the program, Kelly said, because the company wants \"to offer access to education that people can take with them on their journey, no matter where it takes them.\"\n\nFor Yancey, her Starbucks journey is winding down, but it's not over. She continues to work part-time as a barista and has a second job as a music instructor, while planning her next career moves.\n\n\"They find a way to make it work for whoever wants to go into the university through the SCAP program; they find a way for you to complete it,\" Yancey said. \"I don't think finances or learning ability should hold anybody back, and they really delivered on that.\"",

    "fullText": "In a much-anticipated showdown between 5A contenders on Wednesday night — a rematch in fact of last year’s semifinal — it took Bountiful a bit to get going, but once it did it never looked back.\n\nBountiful coach Joel Burton thought his players looked a bit fatigued in the opening minutes perhaps due to a game against Skyline the night before, but they settled in quick building a nine-point lead by the end of the quarter and never looked back on their way to the 56-46 win at Wasatch.\n\n“I felt like our legs were tired as we started the game, and just took us a little while to kind of get into the flow of what we like to do. And just to see us kind of loosen up … and then the shots started dropping. And so it was just nice seeing our kids get flowing again last—there tonight,” said Burton.\n\nBountiful used balanced scoring to secure the win, with Ute signee Milika Satuala leading the way with 15 points, followed by Maleah Nelson with a dozen, Maile Murdock with 11 and Brynna Castleton with 10.\n\n“I’ll take that every game if I can get it. We’ve got some young kids that are definitely growing up and starting to take a little bit of the pressure off of that starting five, thank goodness. So it’s nice to see Miley and Peyton (Orchard) really starting to fill that role, and among many others that are starting to just get confident playing at the varsity level,” said Burton.\n\n“We knew that was going to be the issue coming into the year was finding that group behind the first —behind our starting five, and we’re starting to figure that out.\"\n\nMuch of Bountiful’s damage was done in the first half, as it opened up a 16-7 lead after the first quarter and then stretched it to 21-7 at the 5:54 mark of the second quarter on a corner 3-pointer from the freshman Murdock, her third of the game.\n\nWasatch finally halted the Redhawks’ fast start to cut the lead to 10 by halftime.\n\nWasatch’s press caused some turnover issues late in the game for Bountiful, which saw its lead whittle to seven points in the final minute, but the Wasps ran out of time to cut into the lead another further as it fell to 10-2 on the season.\n\nThe win pushes three-time defending state champion Bountiful’s record to 8-1 on the season.",

    "fullText": "Many electric vehicle drivers have experienced disturbing incidents at charging stations when others maliciously unplug the cables or even cut the cords. Surveillance footage and personal confrontations often reveal that vandals disrupt EV charging out of spite or hatred towards people who own and drive clean-energy vehicles.\n\nHowever, even business owners and store managers sometimes unplug EVs on their property, much to the dismay of drivers who rely on public charging stations.\n\nIn a Reddit post to r/TeslaModelY, one driver shared details about a frustrating encounter while charging at a local grocery store.\n\nThe OP explained they began charging their EV at a grocery store and went into the store's Starbucks to work while it was charging. The store manager told the OP that he unplugged the car because those stations are only for customers.\n\nHowever, the OP was actually a customer who bought a drink and was working inside the store's coffee shop. The encounter made the OP feel \"extremely uncomfortable,\" so they packed up their belongings and left.\n\n\"I'm bummed as this used to be the grocery store I would get my groceries at, and it was always nice to be able to charge my car while shopping, but I don't want to ever go back there knowing that the store manager is a creep who follows customers on their cameras and will, without hesitation, unplug their cars while charging,\" the OP shared.\n\nThis situation is unfortunate because it prevented an EV driver from charging their EV. It also created anxiety for the OP by eliminating a reliable charging source while out running errands.\n\nUnfortunately, EV driver harassment is a widespread problem worldwide. Not only do unplugging vehicles and other threatening behaviors create unnecessary tension between EV and non-EV owners, but they also slow the broader adoption of clean-energy driving.\n\nThose who have yet to learn about the impressive technological advancements and benefits of EVs may rely on outdated information or anti-EV propaganda to justify their actions.\n\nIt's true that EV production does use some natural resources and generates some pollution. However, EVs are still far cleaner and more sustainable than gas-powered vehicles, which release tailpipe fumes wherever they go.\n\nHow long would you be willing to wait for an EV to charge?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nWhen you embrace highly efficient electric vehicle driving, you help sustain breathable air and contribute less to overheating the planet. You can also save significantly on vehicle ownership costs by avoiding the need to buy gas and the routine maintenance costs of traditional cars.\n\nIn response to the OP's post, Reddit users offered their advice about how to handle the situation.\n\n\"You should definitely use one of those charging locks next time you go,\" one Redditor recommended.\n\n\"I would complain to corporate or his boss,\" someone else suggested.\n\n\"Report them for tampering with a customer's car,\" another Redditor wrote.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

He's also the author of The Space Economy. Good to see you.\n\nSo, I'm so curious about SpaceX and kind of like whether it sucks the air out of the room for other types of space investment or creates more of a halo effect for space investment.\n\nI think it's definitely the ladder. Um this is really exciting news. It's still uncertain, but we'll see what happens. But if they do, I mean, this is, I think this is going to um uh set a new benchmark. It's going to reprice um a lot of assets throughout the category. I think it's going to show what can be done. And I think it's going to kick off a wave of new listings. So this could be really exciting. And then from our perspective as private market investors in early companies, uh we're really excited to see what happens when these founders get some liquidity, who own stock options and shares, and they go on now and they're freed from the shackles of working at um big companies, they can go and, you know, um think about what they want to do, start their own thing. So we expect that this is going to um uh increase the SpaceX mafia. I mean, a few years ago it was, you know, we were tracking 45 companies or something like that of SpaceX alumni that had gone on and done founded new companies. It's now up to, I don't know, closer to 200, and we'll see what happens with with this um uh liquidity event. But for us, I mean, this is um uh SpaceX is the Apex player. They're 10 years ahead of anybody else. They've been setting the benchmark all along. Uh now this sort of moment, um we'll see what happens, but it could really catalyze a lot of activity.\n\nI mean, on the flip side, if they are so far ahead of everyone else, and then their numbers are public, does that then um mean that some of the other players, particularly in the public markets who also their numbers are public, like that that they're disadvantaged if they're not in the same place as SpaceX is.\n\nHmm, well, that's um that's a really interesting point. So I think SpaceX has stayed private for so long and they've been so in demand. Um, uh this is the hottest stock in the private markets. Everyone is vying to get access to SpaceX. Um and I think it's really sort of difficult, um when you've got that much interest and that many investors, um to sort of keep things quiet. So, you know, you see throughout the the the news that there's a lot of information that's out there\n\non what their performance looks like, right? So um it's no um so that sort of cat's out of the bag already.\n\nSo it wouldn't necessarily change the dynamic.\n\nYeah, I think so. And so you see like um what are the numbers, you know, um uh 13 last year, 15 this year. You start to think like the the growth is not parabolic um in uh uh their their growth is not parabolic. They but they are cash flow positive and they've been buying back shares, right? So I think what um this would do is really give them sort of uh a large cash infusion to go after some of their long-term missions to get to Mars, to um uh build data centers in orbit, uh to fund that and really have a big cash infusion to basically speed things up and go faster.\n\nUm and one of those is also what Starship is one of the projects that they're working on. Um so how important is that and what what's the timeline for something like that?\n\nSuper important. So Starship is a next generation massive vehicle. Um we've never had anything of this size. So if 2025 was the year of launch frequency, we were basically, we started launching, we launched almost every day, one launch per day, right? And that launch cadence is increasing. 2026 is going to be about mass. Um Starship is a massive vehicle. It is going to be fully reusable, which means that both the first stage of the rocket and the second stage both can land and be refueled and stacked and launched again. More like operational commercial airlines, which is really exciting because that is going to um it promises to deliver another step change in the order of magnitude, further reduction in launch cost, which really um will do a lot to again, to the halo effect, you know, comment to really stimulate growth in in this category. Um but at the same time, that vehicle is is necessary to launch these next generation Starlink satellites, the V3 satellites that they already um that they have already designed and they're just waiting for a vehicle that can carry them. Their data centers in orbit that they're now talking about in conjunction with this um potential IPO, uh requires Starship to be able to launch these things, right? So, this um is uh a lynchpin. It's it's critical to their strategy and it's also um critical um to to take the space economy to the next level.\n\nUm another thing that you're watching closely going into next year is what? geo intelligence and defense. Those are kind of some themes within space. So what should we be watching for there?\n\nYeah, I kind of just thinking about the convergence of AI and space in totality, right? So we talked a little bit about orbital data centers. Everyone seems to be talking about that now. Um Starship is and and Blue Origin's next generation vehicles too are going to allow us to launch new infrastructure that, you know, we couldn't do before like orbital data centers and some other things. So that's really interesting on the AI front. And also, um with regards to, you know, geospatial intelligence. So, um if GPS is the dot on the map, geospatial intelligence is the map. This is um uh digital information layered on top of the physical world. A lot of that comes from the global intelligence comes from satellites, um and different sensor types that are feeding into this really robust rich data set about what's going on on the surface of our planet. That's too much data for humans to comb through. So, um uh AI has come along at just the right time to basically help us parse through that and make sense of that, drive useful insights from that. And this is a huge area of growth. We're seeing um what what we call world models. So, everyone's familiar with LLMs and what's going on there, but those aren't really good at helping us to understand and navigate the physical world. So there's a lot of work going on right now um in geospatial embeddings, basically embedding the data to have the right geospatial information, coordinates, positioning data, rich layers of of data to basically help you now use AI to make sense of the physical world, right? Not just language. So, this is a huge area of opportunity. Um a lot of demand is being driven by defense and intelligence communities, but then also there's massive consumer and enterprise applications as well.\n\nVery cool. All right, Chad, we got to leave it there. Thank you so much. Appreciate it.",

    "description": "\"The lead negotiator for Amazon called me on Thursday,\" Fermi CEO Toby Neugebauer told Business Insider. The deal would pay more than $20 billion over the next 20 years, he said.",
    "fullText": "Amazon is the prospective tenant that withdrew funding from Fermi America's massive data-center project, sending the developer's stock plummeting earlier this month, Business Insider has learned.\n\nIn September, Fermi, which is developing an 11-gigawatt data-center campus in the Texas Panhandle, said it had agreed to a nonbinding letter of intent with an investment-grade tenant to anchor the project. The tenant would take the first gigawatt of power across 12 facilities.\n\nOn Friday, December 12, Fermi's stock plunged by nearly half after a securities filing said an unnamed prospective partner had canceled a $150 million advance to begin construction, known as an Advance in Aid of Construction Agreement, or AICA. The cancellation followed the end of an exclusivity period.\n\nAmazon is that tenant, Toby Neugebauer, Fermi's billionaire CEO, confirmed in a December 15 phone call with Business Insider, discussing the talks that led to the cancellation. The tech giant has been negotiating the deal, which would pay more than $20 billion over the next 20 years, Neugebauer said.\n\n\"The lead negotiator for Amazon called me on Thursday,\" Neugebauer said.\n\nNeugebauer said the talks between Fermi and the tenant remain constructive, and that the ending of the AICA didn't indicate any breakdown in conversation.\n\n\"It's just a normal negotiation,\" he said. \"Their issue was spending money after the exclusive period had ended.\"\n\nNeugebauer said he wasn't worried about the talks taking too long. \"It's a big deal,\" he said. \"Big deals take longer.\"\n\nLisa Levandowski, a spokesperson for Amazon, declined to comment.\n\nFermi America's Panhandle project ranks among the most ambitious attempts yet to meet the surging energy demands of the data centers fueling the AI boom. The company intends to bring 11 gigawatts of new power online over the next decade-plus with a mix of power from the grid, natural gas, and nuclear sources.\n\nThe company went public in September, pricing its shares at $21 to raise more than $680 million.\n\nDubbed Project Matador, the development relies on a 99-year ground lease with the Texas Tech University System. That agreement is dependent on a signed letter of intent between Fermi America and a tenant.\n\nThe December 12 filing said that none of the $150 million construction advance had been used and that the negotiations were ongoing. The letter of intent remains in force.\n\nAnalysts at Cantor Fitzgerald said in a note published December 12 that they had spoken to Fermi America's management and learned that, per the company, the anchor tenant \"tried to make last-minute changes to the agreement pricing that were unacceptable to\" Fermi.\n\nAmazon is the second company to be linked to the project. In October, Neugebauer told the Amarillo City Council that Palantir, the software company known for its police and government contracts, had taken an interest in the site.\n\n\"I just finished with Palantir, which is our nation's tip of the spear in the AI war,\" Neugebauer said during the October 28 meeting. \"They'll be here Thursday.\"\n\nThe Cantor Fitzgerald analysts said in their note that management indicated that they were \"active\" with two additional tenants, and in dialogue with another four.\n\nFermi America was founded less than a year ago by Neugebauer, former Energy Secretary Rick Perry, and Perry's son Griffin. The IPO valued the company at nearly $14 billion.\n\nA recent slump in the company's shares has brought its valuation to below $6 billion.\n\nHave a tip?

    "title": "Strategic CISO: Timing Your Security Assessment for Executive Impact",
    "description": "Whether you’re presenting to your board, executive leadership team, or quarterly business review, transform your penetration testing from a compliance checkbox to your strategic advantage.",
    "fullText": "Welcome to the second installment of our Strategic CISO Series—a collection of guides focused on turning operational security work into strategic wins. Read Part 0 Before the Test — When Your Startup is Really Ready for Penetration Testing.\n\nWhile most security leaders schedule assessments around audit deadlines, the timing of your security testing creates opportunities to demonstrate proactive leadership, present measurable improvements, and position security as a business enabler rather than a cost center.\n\nYour executive leadership review is eight weeks away, scheduled for 15 minutes between the CFO’s budget presentation and lunch. You know you need to talk about security, but leading with “we’re compliant” sounds like you’re just checking boxes, and you definitely can’t lead with “here are all our vulnerabilities.”\n\nThis is a tightrope every security leader walks. You need to discuss security in a way that demonstrates both vigilance and value, without creating panic or appearing reactive.\n\nThe timing of your penetration test is just as strategic as the test itself.\n\nA well-timed pen test validates your security posture, creates a narrative of proactive leadership, provides concrete metrics to present, and positions you as strategic rather than operational.\n\nA poorly timed test leaves you scrambling to explain findings without a remediation story, or, worse, presenting stale data that makes the board question what you’re doing with your time.\n\nEvery penetration test delivers technical findings. Strategic penetration tests deliver business outcomes.\n\nThe difference isn’t in the testing methodology or even expertise - it’s in when you test and what you do with the results. Testing six weeks before a board meeting gives you time to remediate findings and walk into that meeting with a complete narrative of proactive security leadership. Testing two weeks before forces you to either hide findings or present problems without solutions.\n\nStrategic timing enables you to:\n\nSecurity leaders who master timing use their penetration tests to manufacture strategic wins. Those who don’t find themselves constantly explaining why they’re behind.\n\nStrategic play: Commission a penetration test that completes 6-8 weeks before your key stakeholder presentation—whether that’s your board, executive leadership team, quarterly business review, or audit committee—giving you time to remediate critical findings and present a complete narrative of proactive security management.\n\nWhat you can say to stakeholders:\n\n“We proactively commissioned an independent security assessment to validate our security posture”\n\n“We identified and remediated X vulnerabilities before they could be exploited”\n\n“Our security controls are performing as designed, with only minor findings that have been addressed”\n\nWhy the timing works: You’re controlling the narrative. You found the problems. You fixed the problems. You’re demonstrating maturity and proactive risk management. The leadership team sees leadership, not firefighting.\n\nCritical consideration: This only works if your vendor can deliver a report quickly and your team has the bandwidth to remediate. If the report sits for three weeks before anyone looks at it, you’re losing your window.\n\nWhen evaluating vendors, ask: “What’s your turnaround time from test completion to report delivery?” Anything over 5-7 business days will compress your remediation timeline.\n\nWhat you need from your vendor to make this work\n\nSecurity Assessment Results - Q4 2024\n\nAll critical and high-severity findings identified in our independent security assessment have been remediated and retested. This validates that our security investments are working as designed.\n\nThis demonstrates proactive risk management. This is strategic security leadership.\n\nThe strategic play: When a major breach hits your industry or a critical vulnerability affects your tech stack, commission a targeted assessment.\n\nBusiness context: Your leadership team just read about a competitor getting breached, or a major CVE dropped that affects the technology you use. They’re wondering: “Are we vulnerable to this?” Strategic security leaders answer that question before it’s asked.\n\nTriaging whether these things affect your business is a larger conversation. A key consideration for urgency is whether the vulnerability is currently being exploited with publicly released tools, whether you understand your control maturity and attack surface, and the impacts of a compromised affected system. Undergoing security analyses, control audits, purple team partnerships, penetration tests, or red team engagements can help illuminate this uncertainty.\n\nWhat you can present to the executives:\n\nWhy this timing works: Speed and specificity. You’re not waiting for the leadership team to ask the question—you’re answering it before they think of it. This is the difference between reactive and responsive. Reactive is “oh yeah, we should probably check on that.” Responsive is “I’ve already validated our posture and here’s what we found.”\n\nReal-world example: When Log4Shell dropped in December 2021, the CISOs who immediately commissioned targeted pen tests focused on Log4j exploitation were able to report with confidence: “We identified 3 instances, patched them within 48 hours, and validated through penetration testing that we’re no longer vulnerable. No publicly accessible services are vulnerable”\n\nSecurity leaders who didn’t test were left saying “we think we patched everything”—which is not what leadership wants to hear in crisis moments.\n\nWhat you need from your vendor to make this work:\n\nIndustry response timing requires a partner who can mobilize quickly (again, days, not weeks), brings specialized expertise in emergent threats, and provides real-time communication during testing. If they find something critical, you need to know immediately.\n\nSlide that demonstrates responsive leadership\n\nDemonstrate security operations excellence aligned with business velocity.\n\nThe play: Schedule your pen test 90-120 days before your compliance audit (SOC 2, ISO 27001, PCI, HIPAA, etc.), giving you time to remediate findings before auditors arrive.\n\nThe strategic advantage: Many companies schedule penetration tests to coincide with audit requirements, meaning the auditor sees findings around the same time you do. Strategic security leaders validate controls before audits, transforming potential stressors into demonstrations of security maturity.\n\nWhat you can say to your stakeholders (and auditors):\n\nWhy this timing works: Auditors love controls that are already validated. If your pen test is complete, findings are remediated, and you walk into the audit with clean documentation, you’ve just turned a potential stressor into a demonstration of maturity. Plus, if the pen test does find something gnarly, you have time to fix it before the auditor asks about it.\n\nThe awkward scenario this avoids: Your SOC 2 audit is scheduled for October. You commission your pen test in September “to have fresh results for the audit.” The pen test finds a critical SQL injection vulnerability. Now you’re in remediation mode during the audit, explaining to both the auditor and your board why this exists. Even if you fix it quickly, it’s going in the audit report as “finding identified during audit period.”\n\nCompare that to strategic timing: Penetration test in July. Finding discovered and remediated in August. Retested clean in September. Auditor arrives in October and you present a complete package: “Here’s our penetration test from Q3, here’s the remediation, here’s the retest validation.” Clean audit. Confident leadership team.\n\nAsk your vendor to include retesting so you can show “finding closed” before the audit.\n\nThe slide that demonstrates readiness\n\nStrategic planning, not last-minute scrambling.\n\nThe strategic play: Test new products, major features, or infrastructure changes before they go live and before they attract attacker attention.\n\nBusiness context: You’re launching a new product, exposing a new API, or making significant architectural changes. Your engineering team is focused on features and performance. Strategic security leaders integrate testing into the launch process rather than treating security as a launch-day concern.\n\nWhat you can say to the leadership team:\n\nWhy this works: “Shift left” is the mantra, but most companies still treat security as a launch-day or post-launch concern. If you can demonstrate that security testing happened before launch, you’re showing mature DevSecOps practices.\n\nThe strategic value: This also creates internal credibility with your engineering team. If you find issues pre-launch and help them fix it before customers are affected, you’re a partner. If you’re constantly pointing out problems in production, you’re a blocker. The perception shapes your ability to influence future projects.\n\nWhat you need from your vendor to make this work:\n\nStrategic security leaders track penetration test results year-over-year and present trends that prove security program effectiveness.\n\nIf you’re testing annually (and you should be), the compelling story isn’t “we had fewer findings this year.” It’s “here’s how our security posture has measurably improved.”\n\nSlide demonstrating strategic security leadership‍\n\nThat is strategic. That’s budget justification. This proves your security program delivers measurable business value.\n\nWhat you need from your vendor to make this work:\n\nChoose the timing window that best serves your strategic goals:\n\nChoose Window 1 (Pre-Executive Showcase) if:\n\nChoose Window 2 (Industry Response) if:\n\nChoose Window 3 (Compliance Preemptive Strike) if:\n\nChoose Window 4 (Product Security Story) if:\n\nMost strategic approach: Combine windows 3 and 4 on a predictable cadence, and use windows 1 and 2 opportunistically.\n\nThis gives you a drumbeat of security validation, predictable testing cadence, and strategic moments to showcase your program’s effectiveness.\n\nUnderstanding common timing mistakes helps you plan more effectively:\n\nInsufficient remediation window: You commission a pen test two weeks before your executive meeting. When the report comes back with critical findings, you have no time to remediate. You walk into the leadership meeting and either:\n\nTesting during product launches: You test right before a major product launch. Pen test finds a critical issue. Now you’re choosing between:\n\nTesting during audits: You test during your audit. Findings emerge mid-audit. Auditor documents them as “control failures identified during assessment.” Even if you fix them immediately, they’re in the audit report, creating customer concerns and remediation requirements.\n\nInconsistent testing methodologies: Changing the testing scope drastically or switching vendors every six months makes trend analysis difficult, since you can’t demonstrate improvement when the methodology changes. Strategic planning maintains consistent testing approaches that enable year-over-year comparison.\n\nAll of these are avoidable with better timing.\n\nStrategic timing only works when your security testing partner understands both technical depth and business context. Key capabilities that enable strategic timing:\n\n1. Fast report turnaround: Reports delivered within 5-7 business days, so you control your timeline and have adequate remediation windows. Ask: “From test completion to report delivery, what’s your timeline?”\n\n2. Built-in retesting: Validate remediation before presentations. Retest hours should be included in every engagement, not sold separately or requiring additional procurement cycles.\n\n3. Collaborative approach: Testing partners who work alongside your team during remediation, not vendors who deliver reports and disappear. Some findings need clarification; having testers available accelerates remediation.\n\n4. Real-time critical escalation: If they find something severe, you should know during testing, not in a report weeks later. Ask: “If you find a critical vulnerability, what’s your escalation process?”\n\n5. Flexible scheduling: Strategic windows sometimes have tight timelines. Can they start in 2 weeks? Or is their lead time 8+ weeks?\n\n6. Executive reporting capability: Technical reports are necessary; executive summaries are strategic. If appropriate for the assessment, make sure they provide executive-ready documentation, not just technical findings.\n\nStrategic timing transforms security testing from an operational necessity into a controlled narrative.\n\nA penetration test itself takes 80 hours. The strategic value comes from when you test and what you do with the results.\n\nA little planning around timing makes your penetration test 10x more valuable to your career and your company. Testing aligned with executive meetings demonstrates proactive leadership. Testing before audits de-risks compliance. Testing before product launches integrates security into development. Testing after major CVEs demonstrates responsive operations.\n\nThe technical findings do matter. But the business outcomes matter more.\n\nSecurity leaders who master timing use their penetration tests to prove program effectiveness, justify security investments, and position security as a business enabler. Those who treat testing as a compliance checkbox miss the strategic opportunity.\n\nStrategic timing turns security testing into strategic advantage.\n\nSchedule a consultation to discuss aligning your security assessments with stakeholder presentations, compliance deadlines, and product launches.

    "description": "A professor says colleges risk losing autonomy as AI deals and corporate agendas shape teaching, assessment, and how students learn to think.",
    "fullText": "Universities risk surrendering their intellectual autonomy to Silicon Valley's influence as they rush to adopt AI, one professor says.\n\nIn an essay for the Civics of Technology Project — an education platform analyzing technology's societal impact — Bruna Damiana Heinsfeld, an assistant professor of learning technologies at the University of Minnesota, said that colleges are allowing Big Tech to reshape what counts as knowledge, truth, and academic value.\n\nFrom multimillion-dollar partnerships with AI vendors to classrooms infused with corporate branding, she said, universities are shifting toward a model where technological tools are bundled with the identity of the companies behind them.\n\nAs academic leaders scramble to look \"AI-ready,\" Heinsfeld warned that the sector is drifting from critical inquiry toward compliance, risking a future in which Silicon Valley, not educators, sets the terms of learning.\n\nHeinsfeld said AI tools promote a worldview where efficiency is presumed to be a virtue, scale is inherently desirable, and data becomes the default language of truth.\n\nUniversities adopting these systems without critical examination risk teaching students that the logic of Big Tech is not merely useful but inevitable, she added.\n\nHeinsfeld pointed to California State University as an example of that shift on full display.\n\nThe university signed a $16.9 million contract in February to roll out ChatGPT Edu across 23 campuses, providing more than 460,000 students and 63,000 faculty and staff with access to the tool through mid-2026.\n\nIt hosted an AWS-powered \"AI camp\" in the summer, where students arrived to find Amazon branding everywhere, including corporate slogans, AWS notebooks, and promotional swag.\n\nAnother academic said the problem is already playing out in the day-to-day mechanics of learning.\n\nKimberley Hardcastle, a business and marketing professor at Northumbria University in the UK, told Business Insider that universities must overhaul how they design assessments now that students' \"epistemic mediators\" — the tools that help them make sense of the world — have fundamentally changed.\n\nHardcastle advocates requiring students to demonstrate their reasoning: how they arrived at a conclusion, which sources they consulted beyond AI, and how they verified information against primary evidence, she said.\n\nShe said students also need deliberate \"epistemic checkpoints,\" moments designed into coursework where they must pause and ask: \"Am I using this tool to enhance my thinking or replace it? Have I engaged with the underlying concepts or just the AI's summary? Do I understand, or am I just recalling information?\"\n\nFor Heinsfeld, the risk is that corporations will dictate what constitutes legitimate knowledge. For Hardcastle, it's that students will no longer understand how to assess truth for themselves.\n\nBoth say universities must remain the space where students are taught to think, not just how to operate tools.\n\n\"Education should remain the space where we confront the architectures of our tools,\" Heinsfeld wrote. Otherwise, \"it risks becoming the laboratory of the very systems it should critique.\"\n\nHardcastle made a similar point, adding that this future will be shaped not only by institutional decisions but by every moment a student accepts an AI-generated answer without knowing how to question it.",

    "fullText": "Fernando Mendoza returns home with the Heisman and unfinished business originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nFernando Mendoza brought the Heisman Trophy back to Bloomington but made it clear the season’s most important work still lies ahead.\n\nFernando Mendoza arrived at the podium with the Heisman Trophy at his side. Its presence was heavy and unmistakable, a reflection of where Indiana football now stands.\n\nIndiana is 13–0. A Big Ten champion. Home to a Heisman winner. And yet nothing about Mendoza’s message sounded like a victory lap. This was not a moment to linger in. It was one to acknowledge, honor, and then move past.\n\n“This page is folded,” Mendoza said. “Our focus right now is winning the College Football Playoff.”\n\nThat balance defined the afternoon. Mendoza spoke about responsibility and humility, about the fraternity of Heisman winners and how the weight of the trophy only grows with time. He also spoke with emotion about family, heritage, and why it mattered to him to address his grandparents in Spanish on college football’s biggest stage.\n\n“All four of my grandparents were born and raised in Cuba,” Mendoza said. “They emigrated to the United States and sacrificed so much to support my parents and then my parents to support myself.”\n\nFor Mendoza, the moment extended beyond his own family. He referenced fellow Heisman finalist Diego Pavia, the Vanderbilt quarterback, and the sight of an entire family showing up together, something that resonated deeply.\n\n“You see like Diego Pavia’s family, he had like 100 people there too,” Mendoza said. “That’s just how the Hispanic culture is. The Hispanic family is so prideful and supportive of one another.”\n\nMORE: Jeff Monken struggles to put words to Army’s heartbreaking loss to Navy\n\nThat connection made the moment bigger than an individual award.\n\n“I thought saying something in Spanish would mean a lot to them,” Mendoza said. “And also for the Hispanic community out there, because I know there’s a lot of Hispanic football fans.”\n\nHe acknowledged the responsibility that comes with visibility, especially for young players who may not see themselves reflected in college football’s most celebrated moments.\n\n“It’s something that I’m looking forward to represent,” Mendoza said.\n\nFernando described himself as a different player than the one who arrived in spring, a transformation he said even his teammates did not foresee. Once a two star recruit committed to Yale, he now stands as the face of the most accomplished season in Indiana football history. He did not frame it as destiny. He framed it as preparation, accountability, and trust in the people around him.\n\nMORE: College Football Playoff expansion proposals that could have changed everything for Notre Dame and BYU\n\nThe Heisman Trophy mattered. The symbolism mattered. Indiana football changed in that room. But Mendoza made one thing clear. The season’s meaning will not be defined by what sits on a podium.\n\nIndiana will face the winner of Alabama and Oklahoma on New Year’s Day at the Rose Bowl with a path to the national championship now fully in view.\n\nBrian Hartline sends a message to Chris Henry Jr. after choosing Ohio State\n\nDeion Sanders expected to lose key staff member to Group of Five school\n\nTavita Pritchard comes home to Stanford with a message of ‘belief and brotherhood’",

    "description": "The biggest open source stories in 2025 clustered around AI, licensing/governance, security and the shift in the “commercial open source” business model.",
    "fullText": "AI was big in 2025, but so were many other developments and worries.\n\nThe biggest open source stories in 2025 clustered around AI, licensing/governance, security and the shift in the “commercial open source” business model. Let’s start, shall we?\n\nWhile most of the money went to proprietary models, open source AI datasets, orchestration frameworks, evaluation tools and guardrail stacks have all seen gains.\n\nSuch open source AI efforts as Common Corpus, along with the  dozens of AI projects hosted by the Linux Foundation’s AI & Data group are enabling us to use community infrastructure for generative AI rather than relying solely on proprietary APIs, making open AI stacks a serious option for businesses and users.\n\nWhile the open source AI definition remains controversial, and very few AI projects fully qualify as open source by the strict requirements of the Open Source Initiative (OSI) AI definition, AI remains built on a foundation of open source software. The debate over open weights, data and training code will continue, but even the most proprietary large language models (LLMs) couldn’t exist without open source programs.\n\nAgentic AI, owes everything to open source. To orchestrate our latest generation of AI agents, we’re using several programs.\n\nThe most important of these, at this early stage of the game, appears to be the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This is an open standard and open source implementation for uniformly connecting agents to tools, files, databases and other systems.\n\nMCP is increasingly the “plumbing layer” under many agents and IDE assistants, and there are numerous open source MCP servers and toolkits that let any compatible agent framework plug into the same tools.\n\nMCP isn’t the only agentic AI middleware that’s speeding up:\n\nA Linux Foundation report released in August showed that venture capital‑backed commercial open source companies have outperformed comparable closed‑source vendors over the last 25 years.\n\nThat report, alongside open source adoption data from an April OSI survey, which from 96% of organizations are maintaining or increasing open source software use, has cemented commercial open source as the default way to build software.\n\nTogether, these reports are driving more funding, more mergers and acquisitions, and more “open core plus services” strategies around critical open source projects.\n\nOf course, we knew that. After all, a 2024 Harvard Business School study already showed that  96% of commercial programs rely on open source and that the total value of open source code comes to a cool $8.8 trillion. That still doesn’t stop companies that made the mistake of confusing open source as a software development model with a business model; it never was. It never will be.\n\nSo it is that in 2025, we saw more companies move from open source to fauxpen source. For example, the ScyllaDBteam announced in December 2024 that it would move to a single “ScyllaDB Enterprise” stream under a source‑available license.\n\nAt the library level, there have been high‑profile examples of previously permissive projects switching quietly to source‑available, paid‑for‑commercial‑use terms, such as the Fluent Assertions .NET testing library moving, this past January, from Apache‑2.0 to a proprietary source‑available license with per‑developer fees.\n\nThen, there’s the DevOps program Puppet. Although Puppet’s core codebase is still under the Apache 2.0 open source license, its commercial parent company, Perforce, has changed how official builds are distributed and licensed.\n\nWhat changed is that new “hardened” binaries and packages built by Puppet/Perforce are now shipped from a private repository. The Puppet Core End User License Agreement (EULA) offers a free tier capped at 25 nodes, with commercial licensing required for additional nodes. Effectively, this makes Puppet a source-available program, even though the code is technically still open.\n\nThe result in Puppet’s case is the same as we’ve seen in other such attempts to close once open source projects: Unhappy programmers have forked the project. The fork is known as OpenVox.\n\nThese forked projects, which include Elasticsearch with its fork OpenSearch, Redis with the Valkey fork, and Terraform with the OpenTofu fork, have been somewhat successful. All four forks have achieved meaningful traction, but at different scales and under different definitions of  “success.”\n\nOpenSearch appears to be the most successful. It reports strong growth, including double‑digit, 78%, year‑over‑year download increases and a roster of major members such as Amazon Web Services, Canonical, SAP and Uber.\n\nValkey has also proven to be popular. The latest release, Valkey 9, is reported to be far faster than the newest version of Redis. In particular, Valkey users report that it’s consistently ahead of comparable Redis releases on raw throughput, especially on larger, memory‑heavy workloads where Valkey’s multithreaded I/O and cache‑prefetching kick in.\n\nWhile OpenSearch and Valkey have both advanced beyond their parent projects, Terraform vs. OpenTofu is another story. People still see OpenTofu and Terraform as differing only in their licenses. Over the last few months, though, that’s been changing as OpenTofu, which joined the Cloud Native Computing Foundation in April, steers more of its own course. Latest releases now include state encryption, a feature the Terraform community has wanted for years, and early variable evaluation.\n\nFinally, OpenVox continues to present itself as a “soft fork.” Its directors want it to stay 100% compatible with Puppet so it can serve as a drop-in replacement for Puppet deployments. That, however, appears to no longer be possible, as Gene Liverman, the leader of OpenVox, wrote, “We can no longer guarantee that our modules will work with Puppet Core or Puppet Enterprise.”\n\nFrom the project maintainers’ viewpoint, Perforce is breaking compatibility. For now, though, OpenVox is essentially a healthy, community lifeboat rather than a full‑scale Puppet replacement ship.\n\nDespite the simple fact that we all depend on open source, all too many projects remain underfunded. Others, such as NET 6, are still popular, but their maintainers have quit supporting them. What’s a user to do?\n\nThis isn’t a new problem. Back in 2021, Tidelift, a security company that also financially supported open source maintainers, found that 46% of open source project maintainers received no pay at all. Almost as bad, even those who were paid, a mere 26% earn more than $1,000 per year for their work.\n\nThings have not improved. In fact, they’ve gotten worse. In 2024, Tidelift’s latest results showed that now 60% of open source maintainers are unpaid.\n\nAs  an open letter signed by 10 open source foundations  and published in September pointed out, “Most of these [open source] systems operate under a dangerously fragile premise: They are often maintained, operated, and funded in ways that rely on goodwill, rather than mechanisms that align responsibility with usage.”\n\nSo it is that, according to the open letter, “a small number of organizations absorb the majority of infrastructure costs, while the overwhelming majority of large-scale users, including commercial entities that generate demand and extract economic value, consume these services without contributing to their sustainability.”\n\nA specific example that I’ve been covering is how FFMpeg, which is used by everyone who watches videos over the Internet, is horribly underfunded, even as major companies such as Amazon, Google and Netflix depend on its code. There are many other such projects. This can not continue.\n\nThe answer is that companies must — Must — start financially supporting mission-critical open source projects. The cost to do this is minute compared to the damage they’d suffer if these projects folded or were hit by a major security problem.\n\nIn 2024, the xz data compression library code, which had been deliberately infected with malware, came close to inserting a backdoor into Fedora, Red Hat’s community Linux. Had it been successful, it might have ended up in Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and its clones.\n\nThis would have led to the greatest Linux security disaster to date. We dodged a bullet.\n\nUnfortunately, the open source software supply chain security is under sustained, high-volume attack, with npm- and PyPI-focused campaigns escalating.\n\nSeveral high-impact campaigns in 2025 centered on compromising open source package ecosystems, especially npm.\n\nIn November, researchers from Wiz, Aikido, and others detailed a “Shai-Hulud 2.0” wave of trojanized npm packages that exfiltrated developer and CI/CD credentials from environments using popular libraries tied to major Software as a Service and cloud tooling.\n\nTens of thousands of malicious repos were spun up as part of the campaign. GitLab’s vulnerability research team also reported a separate widespread npm supply chain attack that harvested credentials for GitHub, npm, and major clouds and propagated by infecting additional packages owned by victims.\n\nThese are not one-off instances. Industry threat reports in 2025 describe a surge in software supply chain attacks overall, with October setting a new monthly record, and open source ecosystems featuring prominently among the targets.\n\nAnalysis from Palo Alto Networks’ Unit 42 and other research teams notes that attackers increasingly prefer compromising maintainer accounts and publish pipelines rather than core source repos, because this path can silently poison trusted packages at scale.\n\nA study by ReversingLabs, released in March, reported that, while observed open source malware packages have declined somewhat, the risk has shifted toward leaked developer secrets and build-time exposures.\n\nResearchers examining popular npm, PyPI, and RubyGems components continue to find hard-coded credentials, weak application hardening, and exposed data inside widely used binaries deployed in enterprises. That kind of mistake was stupid back in the ’80s, when I first encountered it in production software, and it’s unforgivable today.\n\nMaking matters worse, security companies such as JFrog and Veracode report that exploding dependency graphs, faster release cycles, and heavy reuse of open source libraries mean a single malicious or vulnerable package can ripple through thousands of downstream applications in days.\n\nThis dense interconnection makes the blast radius of attacks like the npm-focused campaigns in 2025 significantly larger than that of many earlier open source incidents, especially when the target libraries appear in 20 to 30% of scanned cloud environments.\n\nWhat can we do about it? We must more broadly adopt software bills of materials (SBOMs), Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts (SLSA)-style attestations, and tools from the Open Source Software Foundation ecosystem to track provenance and integrity of open source components.\n\nOpenSSF and its partners highlight initiatives such as Sigstore for keyless signing, Scorecard for automated project risk assessment, and the Open Source Project Security Baseline, which aim to give both maintainers and consumers clearer security expectations.\n\nEvery year, I tell people that they must take security more seriously. Lately, as open source supply chain violations become ever more common, I’ve been saying you must ensure the code in your supply chain is both safe and written by someone trustworthy.\n\nLooking ahead, I can only redouble these warnings. Now we’ve already had serious security breaches in the last few years. You remember: Solarwinds, JetBrains TeamCity, and Apache Log4j should all come to mind quickly. As bad as those were, worse security disasters lie ahead if we don’t take open source supply chain security much more seriously.",

    "fullText": "Google has been in the AI chip game for more than a decade. Now its custom hardware is moving markets.\n\nShares of Nvidia and other chipmakers tumbled last month following a report that Meta — one of Nvidia's largest customers — was exploring a deal to use Google's AI chips, known as Tensor Processing Units, or TPUs.\n\nGoogle has primarily used its TPUs for internal use, but it also leases them to external customers through the cloud. Nvidia, meanwhile, has become the dominant provider of AI chips with its graphics processing units, or GPUs.\n\nGoogle has a potential blockbuster business to unlock. In a research note sent December 2, Morgan Stanley projected that 5 million of Google's TPUs will be purchased in 2027 and about 7 million in 2028, significantly increasing its prior projections.\n\nHere's a breakdown of everything you need to know about TPUs, what they're used for, and when they might become a more prominent threat to Nvidia's chip dominance.\n\nOver a decade ago, Google needed more powerful and specialized compute power for the type of AI work it wanted to do. A team led by the now-CEO of Groq, Jonathan Ross, designed a new chip based on a specific type of integrated circuit for machine learning. The TPU was born.\n\nGoogle has continued to improve and refine its TPUs over the years, making them more effective at both training models and inference, the process where a trained model answers a question or performs a task. As large language models have grown in size, Google has also increased the memory bandwidth of later TPUs to handle these bigger workloads.\n\nGoogle says its latest \"Ironwood\" TPU, which the company is making widely available, is more than four times better than its predecessor for both training and inference.\n\nNvidia's GPU cards, which launched in 1999, were originally designed for gaming, not AI. When researchers later discovered that the chips were useful for tasks such as training neural networks, Nvidia doubled down on the AI market.\n\nGoogle's TPUs, on the other hand, were designed for AI from the get-go. Being more specialized means they're more efficient than Nvidia's chips at some tasks, and faster for running select AI models. They have something called a systolic array, which lets a more constant stream of data pass through the chip, rather than having to keep fetching more from memory.\n\nWhere Google's TPUs have a big edge is in cost at scale. It's possible to have thousands of TPUs working in tandem in a single \"pod.\" Because they are faster at some calculations than GPUs, running many TPUs at once can sometimes be more cost-efficient.\n\nThat may become more important as companies increase investments at the inference stage, which Google says its latest TPU is especially good at. That could save companies money.\n\nOne advantage that Nvidia has over Google is its CUDA software, which makes it possible for regular applications to use GPUs for general computing tasks — not just for graphics. CUDA also only works with Nvidia chips, one of the biggest points of friction stopping companies from switching to Google's chips.\n\nGoogle is trying to change that. For example, there is a lot of industry demand to have TPUs better support Pytorch, a popular tool for building AI applications that was created inside Meta. Google is allocating more resources and attention to better supporting Pytorch, which data suggests is seeing much more demand than Google's own Tensorflow software, according to Google employees and industry experts.\n\nWhen it comes to TPUs, Google remains its own biggest customer. It uses the chips across the company to power products like Search and Maps. Its latest Gemini 3 model was trained on TPUs.\n\nWhile Google has prioritized its own needs, it has leased its TPUs to other customers. Apple used TPUs to train its in-house AI model, Business Insider previously reported. In October, Anthropic announced a blockbuster deal with Google that it says will see it using up to 1 million TPUs. Broadcom, which helps build the TPU chips for Google, revealed in its Q4 earnings call this week that it has received a total of $21 billion in orders from Anthropic for Google's Ironwood TPUs.\n\nMeta is also in early testing of Google's TPUs, according to a person familiar with the matter, although it's not clear if it will result in a long-term deal.\n\nGoogle's TPU business could be poised to explode in the coming years. In a research note this month, Morgan Stanley wrote that every 500,000 TPU chips sold could potentially add around $13 billion in revenue to Google's balance sheet in 2027.\n\nHaving TPUs isn't just a potential revenue boost for Google. It also gets a feedback loop in using TPUs to run and train its AI models, learning from them, and changing how it develops its next chips to be better at the things Google needs.\n\nNvidia's GPU is still very much the chip du jour, but other tech giants are increasingly pouring resources into their own custom chips. Amazon just announced its new Trainium3 custom AI chip, which the company says can cut the cost of training and powering AI models in half compared with a GPU.\n\nMany TPU buyers are also Nvidia customers, and some industry insiders told Business Insider that it's more likely that the rise of more specialized chips will see companies and labs diversify the chips they use, rather than going all in on one provider.\n\nThat could still hurt Nvidia, which could lose pricing power as a result of a more diverse market.\n\nHowever, even if Google's TPU business finds more momentum, it doesn't mean Nvidia will suddenly crumble overnight. Jordan Nanos, member of technical staff of research firm SemiAnalysis, said his firm believes companies, including Nvidia, Google, and Amazon, will all \"sell lots\" of chips in the future.\n\n\"We don't see TPU as a significant threat to Nvidia's business, but it has been a real player in the market for many years,\" said Nanos. \"It is possible that Google sells TPU servers externally in the future, to many more customers. Right now, they are very selective.\"\n\nHave something to share? Contact this reporter via email at hlangley@businessinsider.com or Signal at hughlangley.01.

    "fullText": "Our Delta One tickets got us access to the expansive Delta Sky Club at LAX.\n\nAlong with two large buffet areas and a bar, the space had many comfortable seating zones and private bathrooms with showers.\n\nIt was fun having so many complimentary food options — including vegan ones — but we tried not to overdo it as we had already pre-selected meals for our flight.\n\nWhen it was time to board the plane, we walked over to our gate and were among the first passengers welcomed.\n\nAs we settled into our seats, the friendly flight attendants offered us drinks and snacks right away.\n\nSince the plane had a staggered layout and my husband and I both wanted window seats, my \"suite\" was one row behind his.\n\nThat meant we couldn't hold hands, as we usually do, during takeoff. But rather than feeling nervous, I felt safely cocooned in my personal space.\n\nThe suite had a door to slide shut for privacy and side buttons for adjusting the seat's angle and lighting.\n\nThe blanket and pillow were cozy, and the travel kit had some useful amenities, like slippers, lip balm, hand cream, and an eye mask.\n\nI was hoping for a pair of pajamas, but those weren't offered on our 8 p.m. flight.\n\nOnce we leveled off, I was able to fully recline in the Delta One lie-flat seats. It was such a relief.\n\nMore than anything, the ability to lie down flat made the biggest difference in how much I enjoyed the long flight.\n\nI was even able to fall asleep off and on — something I'm never able to do on a plane\n\nUnlike me, my husband doesn't mind flying — he just doesn't like the lack of space on most plane seats. At over 6 feet tall with a burly build and size-14 shoes, he's always hoping for more legroom.\n\nFortunately, the Delta One suite delivered with its roomy seat and foot cubby.\n\nMy husband was so comfortable that he didn't even bother taking off his shoes or fully reclining during the entire flight.\n\nOur overnight flight included a three-course dinner and next-day breakfast, plus plenty of snacks and drinks.\n\nWe had ordered vegan options and were pleasantly surprised at how tasty the food was, from grain bowls to salads to plates with hummus and veggies.\n\nThe retractable table I ate on felt roomy and sturdy, and eating with real silverware, porcelain dishes, and cloth napkins elevated the experience.\n\nWatching TV on the nicely sized screen in front of me helped me forget I was in a flying metal tube thousands of feet above the ground.\n\nThough Delta offered plenty of new movies and shows for me to stream, I ended up turning to old favorites like \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" and listening to soothing music.\n\nMeanwhile, my husband was rocking out to a famous Bruce Springsteen concert from 1979.\n\nAll in all, our pricey flight was so enjoyable that I almost wished it lasted longer.\n\nWhen we landed at Heathrow Airport the following afternoon, we didn't even have jet lag. We just felt ready to take on the day.\n\nSplurging isn't always possible, but we're keeping our options open for future flights. As they say, it's not about the destination, it's about the journey.",

    "fullText": "When it comes to regrets, Michael Burry has a few.\n\nThe investor of \"The Big Short\" fame, who bet on GameStop years before it became a meme, explained why he sold the stock before it skyrocketed in a Substack post on Monday night.\n\nBurry, who recently pivoted from hedge fund manager to online writer, first invested in GameStop in the summer of 2018. The video-game retailer's stock looked undervalued to him, and he saw an array of catalysts that could send it higher, he wrote.\n\nThey included a console refresh in 2020, the possibility of a buyout, the potential sale of the Spring Mobile business, and strong cash flows and a large cash pile offering scope for a \"very big and consequential buyback,\" Burry wrote.\n\nHe exited the position in the second quarter of 2019 after the stock failed to budge. But he reinvested in July 2019, buying the stock \"with both hands\" and making it one of his larger holdings, in part because high short interest presented a fresh catalyst, he wrote.\n\n\"I visited a GameStop store to make sure I was not crazy,\" Burry wrote. \"It did not work. Even the stuff that was not on sale looked like it should be on sale.\"\n\nBurry wrote to GameStop's board to push for changes at the company. He shared that his public activism drew emails from Keith \"Roaring Kitty\" Gill, a retail investor who would become the face of the GameStop meme mania, and Chewy cofounder Ryan Cohen, who would go on to become GameStop's CEO.\n\nBurry said he bought into GameStop the second time at a split-adjusted average price of 83 cents, or less than 1/26 of the current $22 stock price.\n\nHe purchased an almost 5% stake and held it for more than 16 months. \"Most of that time, I lent my shares out at very good rates — high double digits — which was lucrative and a big part of the trade,\" he wrote.\n\nBurry cashed out by the end of November 2020, selling his shares for an average of $3.38 each, or more than four times what he paid.\n\nWeeks later, retail investors on forums such as r/WallStreetBets executed a historic squeeze on GameStop short sellers, sending the stock to an intraday high of over $120 on January 28, 2021.\n\n\"At the peak my yearslong investment might have turned $12 million into $1 billion, but that was never a possibility,\" Burry wrote, noting that he would have sold long before that point.\n\nBurry — best known for predicting and profiting from the housing crash that preceded the 2008 financial crisis, a story told in the book and movie \"The Big Short\" — reflected on whether he should have played his hand differently.\n\n\"I could have analyzed that situation better,\" he said. \"I knew GameStop inside and out, and I thought I understood the volume, short interest, and other dynamics. However, I was blinded by what I saw as execution risk.\"\n\nHe'd also lost faith in a huge stock rebound. \"As well, I am human,\" he wrote, adding that large-scale buybacks, board changes, and the sale of Spring Mobile had been \"home run/slam dunk activist successes with concrete results but zero impact on price or short interest.\"\n\nBurry seized the chance to close out his bet after GameStop shares spiked following Cohen's disclosure of his stake.\n\n\"I had no idea what was coming,\" he wrote. \"I had no idea that a Roaring Kitty existed.\"\n\n\"And I had no idea that a widely distributed gamma squeeze would thread the needle to become the one and only legal market corner,\" he added.\n\nAround 50 days after he exited, that \"ignominious crappy business\" had become the \"belle of the ball,\" Burry wrote. \"The entire world could not take their eyes off her. And neither could I.\"\n\nBurry said he had mixed feelings about the meme-stock mania of early 2021: \"It was spectacular. It was hilarious. It was tragic in turn.\"\n\nBut he decided it was \"less fun\" by the middle of 2021, when non-fungible tokens (NFTs) were soaring in value along with \"watches, shoes, just about everything.\"\n\nBurry said he feared retail investors would be \"shredded on this meme thing,\" and warned them to watch out. He spoke out because \"if there is one thing I wish I could have done, it was to have effectively warned or spoken about what was happening in 2005-2007,\" he wrote.\n\nThe deep-value investor, who moonlighted as an investment blogger in medical school, also teased an upcoming post that will be a \"breakdown of GameStop as an investment today.\"\n\n\"As a melting ice cube and a capital structure with some optionality, GameStop is roughly as I approached it in 2018, except it is only 16% shorted, all the numbers are 10 times bigger and Ryan is running it, for better or worse,\" he wrote.",

    "title": "Use the Eight Elements of the ‘Flow State’ to Be More Productive",
    "description": "Being in a \"flow state\" is way more than just some corporate lingo.",
    "fullText": "You hear people talk about working in a “flow state,” but what does that even mean? before you start thinking of it as one of those corporate jargon phrases that gets tossed around so much it loses any meaning it ever had, it's worth knowing that it's a \"real\" thing, backed up by a whole lot of psychological research. In essence, being in a flow state enables you to work more efficiently and effectively at whatever you're focused on.\n\nPsychologist Mihály Csíkszentmihályi came up with this theory in 1970, suggesting a flow state is similar to when someone is floating along, being carried by water: Their brains are working so efficiently they’re moving straight ahead on a task with no issues, almost as if they are being propelled forward.\n\nHe spent his time interviewing artists and athletes at the top of their game to understand when and how they performed optimally—and how everyday people can tap into a “flow” state, too. He wrote several books on the topic, but for our purposes here, you don't need to ingest all of them. What's most important is to understand the eight main traits of flow theory.\n\nCsíkszentmihályi’s work ultimately describes eight clear characteristics of being in flow:\n\nYou’re completely concentrated on your task.\n\nYou have clarity around goals in your mind and can get immediate feedback.\n\nTime feels like it's transforming, either speeding up or slowing down.\n\nThe work is intrinsically rewarding.\n\nThere is a sense of effortlessness or ease.\n\nThe work is challenging, but you have the skills for it.\n\nYou are not self-conscious; actions and awareness are working together.\n\nYou feel you have control over the task.\n\nThis may remind you of the concept of “deep work,” which is author/professor Cal Newport’s definition of doing demanding tasks when you’re fully engrossed in them and not distracted. The two concepts are similar, but to achieve either, there are a few things you need to do. It’s clear from the list of flow characteristics above that mastery and resources play a big role in whether you'll feel you’re in a flow state when you're working. Obviously you’ll likely only hit this state if you’re doing something you’re completely prepared for, so don’t aim for it if you’re going to be doing something that requires contributions from other people, resources you don’t have, or skills you don’t possess. You can be ripped from it quickly if, say, you're waiting around for a colleague to email you something you need for the project, which can destabilize your whole day. (For a better understanding of that, it's worth familiarizing yourself with the difference between downtime and idle time.)\n\nWhen you are trying to hit a flow state, plan around when you need to do a major, demanding task. For instance, when planning your 1-3-5 to-do list for the day, your one big task should be one you’re fully prepared and have all the resources for. Keep Carlson’s Law—the idea that any work you attempt to do while distracted will be suboptimal—in mind, too; you can’t work, let alone flow, if you’re being pulled in multiple directions, so schedule the time you’re going to take on your big task to coincide with a time when you have nothing else going on and can give it your full attention. Use timeboxing to allocate this time in your schedule, minute by minute, and, if you can, make your calendar publicly visible so people in your organization know you’re not available.\n\nWhen I explored adopting this mindset in my own life, I found that my biggest blocker was dealing with distractions, especially from my phone (no surprise there). Almost counterintuitively, I found two apps to be helpful: Steppin, which blocks my access to distracting apps unless I trade time I've banked by walking around in the real world; and Focus Pomo, which blocks all other apps whenever I'm in a \"focus session.\"\n\nSo, if you’re working hard on something but don’t feel like you’re achieving any kind of flow state, refer back to the list of characteristics to see what’s missing. Are you distracted? Do you not have the option to get immediate feedback? Are you lacking a necessary resource? Is the work too challenging for your skills or maybe even not challenging enough to keep your attention? Identifying which characteristic you’re lacking most will help you fix the problem and get you closer to flowing your way to major productivity.",

    "fullText": "Region struggling with drought now threatened by energy-hungry facilities – but some residents are fighting back\n\nThe sign outside Tom Hermes’s farmyard in Perkins Township in Ohio, a short drive south of the shores of Lake Erie, proudly claims that his family have farmed the land here since 1900. Today, he raises 130 head of cattle and grows corn, wheat, grass and soybeans on 1,200 acres of land.\n\nFor his family, his animals and wider business, water is life.\n\nSo when, in May 2024, the Texas-based Aligned Data Centers broke ground on its NEO-01, four-building, 200,000 sq ft data center on a brownfield site that abuts farmland that Hermes rents, he was concerned.\n\n“We have city water here. That’s going to reduce the pressure if they are sucking all the water,” he says of the data center.\n\n“They’re not good, I know that.”\n\nTwo years ago, the company said it would invest about $202m on a “hyperscale” data center that would employ 18 people and dozens \n\nAll the while, a 10-minute drive north, the shoreline of Lake Erie hasn’t been this low in years.\n\nWater levels across all five Great Lakes have begun to drop in recent months as part of a long-term fall. Since 2019, the Great Lakes have seen water-level decreases of two to four feet. While experts say this is a natural decrease given the record highs the lakes have experienced since 2020, it’s happening at a time when a huge new consumer of water has appeared on the horizon: data centers.\n\nThe source of the largest single deposit of freshwater on the planet, the Great Lakes, in particular Lake Erie, are already struggling with the fallout of drought and warmer water temperatures that, at this time of year, fuel major lake-effect snowstorms, and greater than normal levels of evaporation due to the absence of ice cover.\n\nWith major cities such as Chicago, Toronto, Detroit and Pittsburgh all within a few hundred miles of each other, small, under-resourced communities around the Great Lakes have become hugely attractive for data-center companies.\n\nIn Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin, Microsoft is building what it calls the “world’s most-powerful AI data center” that is set to open early next year and expected to use up to 8.4bn gallons of municipal water from the city of Racine every year. Racine gets its water from Lake Michigan. Similar stories are playing out in Hobart, Indiana, where AWS is planning to build a data center two miles from Lake Michigan’s shoreline, and in Port Washington, Wisconsin.\n\nIn Benton Harbor, Michigan, locals are concerned that a proposed $3bn data center would contribute to environmental pollution and traffic.\n\nForty miles west of Aligned’s under-construction data center in Ohio, in Woodville Township, hundreds of people showed up to a public meeting last October to voice concern about another proposed data center project in their rural community.\n\n“The Great Lakes region, especially in states such as Illinois and Ohio, [is] among the most data-center dense states in the region. In addition to the high volumes of water used on site for cooling, our recent research found that even more water may be consumed to generate electricity to power data centers’ energy needs,” says Kirsten James, senior program director for water at Ceres, a nonprofit headquartered in Boston.\n\n“These impacts can conflict with communities’ water-resource planning efforts.”\n\nThe Great Lakes Compact, a 2005 accord signed by the governors of eight US states and two Canadian provinces, means that Great Lakes Water must only be used within the regional basin.\n\nResearch by Purdue University found that data centers on average consume about 300,000 gallons of water a day. Water used by data centers is warmed significantly and for those that do not use a closed loop system, that heated effluent water, just 20% of the initial amount, is often discharged back into local wastewater systems or the environment, with potentially serious consequences for flora, fauna and human consumers. Even closed-loop systems that reuse the same water repeatedly need millions of gallons of water.\n\nWhile many new data centers are drawing water from local municipalities that, in turn, get their water from groundwater, much of that supply comes from the Great Lakes watersheds.\n\nSome communities are fighting back. Last month, residents of Fife Lake, Michigan, were overjoyed after hearing a plan for a data center in their town of 471 residents would be scrapped due to local opposition.\n\nSimilar stories of successful opposition have played out in Indiana and elsewhere.\n\nBut the data centers are fighting back.\n\nPrivate firms representing data center companies have often successfully sued community authorities, accusing them of illegally excluding certain types of developments, making small towns powerless in the battle to keep out giant water-guzzling corporations.\n\nIn Michigan’s Saline Township, a community of about 400 people outside Ann Arbor, OpenAI and Oracle used a representative company to successfully sue the local authority to overcome opposition and build a massive facility that would use 1.4 gigawatts of electricity – roughly the equivalent of powering 1.4 million homes.\n\nThe Detroit Free Press editorial board assailed the move, calling it a “a fait accompli, hammered into this tiny Washtenaw county community over the objections of residents, the elected board that represents them, and Michigan’s attorney general, absent expert or outside testimony save a cursory public hearing held over Microsoft Teams”.\n\nData companies and their backers, however, say their presence is a net gain for Great Lakes communities by providing jobs and investment over the course of years.\n\nAligned has paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to Perkins Township, the local school system and a career center. In return, it gets a 15-year tax exemption from local authorities. A representative declined to respond to questions from the Guardian asking how much water it intends to use at the data center and from where it originates.\n\nLocal municipalities that support these facilities claim that the data centers will increase tax revenue and help rebuild ageing infrastructure such as water delivery systems that, in some places, are in significant need of upgrading. Calls, emails and messages left with Erie county commissioners asking if local authorities plan to supply the Perkins Township data center with water were not responded to.\n\nSome Perkins Township residents say a number of local companies have been hired during the construction phase, bringing work to the area.\n\nBut many argue those investments are not worth the long-term price the community may pay.\n\nAmanda Voegle, who works at a heating business now directly facing the data center, is concerned about water and many other issues.\n\n“A couple of years ago, there was a water pollution issue at the site. I’m very concerned. Is this [water] going back into the lake?”\n\nTwo years ago, the construction site upon which the data center is being built was found to be the source of contamination of a river that flows into Lake Erie, with the remediation company responsible cited by the Ohio EPA for unauthorized discharges into state waters.\n\n“I don’t understand why they built it so close to the street, because it’s an eyesore,” says Voegle.\n\nShe says there have been other unusual incidents at her workplace recently, including power surges.\n\n“I don’t know if it’s related [to the data center]. It’s probably almost weekly that we lose power and have to fully reboot everything. There was a couple of things we actually had to replace because [the power surge] fried it.”",

    "description": "David Chung shares how his mother's immigrant journey inspired him to build a multimillion-dollar beauty business from the ground up.",
    "fullText": "David Chung is a serial entrepreneur and CEO of multiple beauty brands.\n\nFarmacy Beauty, which he founded in 2015, was acquired by Procter & Gamble for $350 million.\n\nHe isn't driven by money, and at 66, he can't envision retiring, he says.\n\nThis as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with David Chung, owner and chairman of Amare Global. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI couldn't believe there was a banana just sitting on the kitchen table. In Korea, having a banana was a big deal, but when I immigrated to New York City at 12, we had fruit and even M&Ms. Everything was so luxurious.\n\nMy mother immigrated to the US in 1963 with less than $100. When she arrived in New York, she started a small, mom-and-pop gift shop. She grew the business through and eventually got her green card. I joined her about eight years later, in the middle of a New York winter. I didn't speak the language, but I felt lucky to be in the US.\n\nMy mother continued to grow her store, expanding into a drugstore and pharmacy. By the early 2000s, she had a business worth tens of millions.\n\nShe was very, very entrepreneurial. Watching her journey inspired me and has carried over even today. I have a lot of her DNA when it comes to business. Now that I'm 66, I'll think, \"I'm just like my mother!\" It's scary.\n\nMy mom's business set the stage for mine. Working in her shop, I saw that beauty products provided a great business opportunity. The products are small, which reduces warehousing and shipping costs. They're consumable, so customers return again and again. And even if the economy is bad, people don't give up on their skin.\n\nI went to college, but I found it difficult to concentrate because I was always thinking about starting my business. Even today, I don't drive much because I get so distracted thinking about running my companies (instead, I use a driver). Eventually, I graduated with a degree in engineering.\n\nRight next to my school, there was a small video rental store. These were the days before Blockbuster. I bought that store when I was 23, and expanded it slowly to sell gifts and cosmetics.\n\nThat was my start in business. Other than my mom, I've never worked for anyone else. That meant I had to learn hard lessons about business structure, processes, and systems on my own.\n\nOver time, I pivoted from retail to research, design, and manufacturing. In 2018, I sold my shares in one company for $53.7 million. In 2021, I sold my company, Farmacy Beauty, for hundreds of millions (I'm not allowed to share the specific amount). I remember being at my computer on December 31st, watching the funds being deposited into my account. I didn't feel anything. I didn't think \"I'm rich now.\" I didn't even go out to dinner to celebrate.\n\nEntrepreneurship has never been about money for me. It's more about the accomplishment and excitement of building something. I remember the first time I was in a room with people who had more credentials than me. I came up with an idea they hadn't considered. That's the first time I realized that I had a different way of thinking about things.\n\nI have a huge amount of money now — I could never spend it all. And yet, when those funds hit my account, I didn't buy a Rolex or a fancy car. I went out and bought another company to run.\n\nRecently, I told an employee that I'm going to retire in three years. She laughed and said I told her the same thing 15 years ago.\n\nI don't think I will ever retire fully. God has given me a talent for being business-minded and good at what I'm doing. I want to utilize that as long as I'm able to.\n\nMy mother was very passionate about giving back, particularly to the Korean American community. I figure the more money I make, the more I can give back. So, why not use this skill?",

    "fullText": "The sudden deaths Sunday of legendary director Rob Reiner and his wife, Michele Singer Reiner, reverberated through Hollywood. Now, the arrest of Reiner's son Nick on Monday on a murder charge in connection with his parents' deaths is shedding new light on the internal struggles of the famous family.\n\nBusiness Insider spoke with Nick Reiner and Rob Reiner in 2016 while attending the Toronto International Film Festival, where the pair were premiering their movie \"Being Charlie,\" which is based on Nick's experiences with drug abuse.\n\nThe movie focuses on 18-year-old Charlie (Nick Robinson) as he struggles with addiction to heroin and cocaine. As Charlie jumps in and out of rehab, the aggravation of his actor-turned-politician father (\"Princess Bride\" star Cary Elwes) grows, as he struggles to figure out how to help his son.\n\nNick began working on the script with a fellow addict, Matt Elisofon, while spending four years at a Los Angeles rehab facility. After the script was rejected as a TV series, Nick and Elisofon turned to Rob to come on and direct it as a feature film.\n\nNick told Business Insider at the time that working with his father on a film about his struggles with addiction and their relationship as a family was complicated but healing.\n\n\"It was a real corrective emotional experience,\" Nick told Business Insider in 2016 of watching his movie premiere at TIFF.\n\n\"I relied on him,\" Rob said of his son. \"He's the heart and soul of the film.\"\n\nThe movie had a blink-and-you-miss-it release, playing in four theaters for one week in May 2016.\n\n\"We were healing as we were going along,\" Nick said in 2016. \"And it all doesn't happen overnight. Certain things we hadn't dealt with for a while, but we were able to through this movie. It didn't fix everything, but it really tapped into — \"\n\nNick paused to find the words, then his father, sitting across from Nick, finished for him.\n\n\"It forced me to really have to understand what he had been going through for a long time,\" Rob said.",

    "title": "3 holiday shopping rules I swear by after two decades investing in small businesses",
    "description": "Skip the one-day shipping. A small-business expert shares how shoppers can help small brands grow through slower spending and thoughtful purchases.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with KK Hart, a 40-year-old multi-entrepreneur and business acquisition expert based in Dallas. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nFor the past 20 years of my career, I've supported small businesses. First as a consultant and then, through an unexpected journey, in business acquisition. As a non-institutional investor — which means I use my own money to invest and am not part of a fund or organization — I've purchased and led 10 small businesses, from brick-and-mortar fitness studios to skincare brands such as Ghost Democracy, my most recent acquisition.\n\nAs someone who has seen the inner workings of many businesses, I can say there's a mismatch between what consumers think small businesses need during this time of year and what they actually want. My passion is helping consumers understand how they can improve a small brand's profit margin and long-term viability during the holiday season and beyond.\n\nHere are three high-impact shopping strategies to try.\n\nShoppers have been trained to value speed and low cost, but small brands generally can't match that. When you look for the free or one-day shipping, you're asking a small business to compete on money — often at a loss, especially when you consider that logistics costs went up this year for small businesses.\n\nInstead, I like to encourage people to think of intentionality as the new convenience and prioritize slower shopping. I like to start planning what I might buy for the holiday season at the beginning of the year, so that I can shop more slowly in Q3 and Q4.\n\nWhen consumers slow down their purchasing and think more carefully about what they're buying, it leads to less friction and fewer returns, which are a massive cost for retailers. If you go slower, you have a week or two to ask the brand questions, like about their formulation or how they stack up to a competitive brand, and ensure you're making the best purchase for you. People are always surprised to find that small businesses actually respond honestly.\n\nIf you've missed a shipping deadline for a small business this year, go for gift cards. Gift cards are 100% cash flow for a small business, minimize returns, and allow your gift recipient to choose what they actually want.\n\nThe heart of this season is about giving and joy. I can tell you that business owners would like to have a lot of joy year-round — not just during the holiday season.\n\nYes, that can mean buying throughout the year and being a repeat customer to the brands you love. The post-holiday rush in January is a cash flow desert for many businesses.\n\nSupport can also look like leaving a review. While there's a lot of emphasis on the dollar amount going to small businesses, feedback can matter just as much. Your purchase in December and your review shortly thereafter could fuel purchases in July and August when things aren't as exciting. That creates more than money in the moment — it gives us a marketing asset all year long.\n\nFinally, think beyond the items you want to own and focus on how you can make an impact. When you consider what you really want from a product and purchase, you think differently than what's the lowest cost and the most convenient.\n\nAnytime I spend money, even as a consumer, I like to think about who I'm investing in. It's impactful to put your money into a small business, where it goes directly into a family's pocket and could impact their business for generations to come. When you invest in a brand in this way, you give them more than just your immediate gratification.\n\nAdditionally, it's also good to purchase items on first-party platforms, or a business's direct website, which places the marketplace commission back into the owner's hands. This is often overlooked, but a truly tangible way to make an impact.\n\nEssentially, you want to go from being a customer to thinking like a capital owner. That was my journey — realizing that the real impact is not in what you buy, but what you can help create with the money you spend.",

    "description": "A Business Insider reporter taste-tested Ina Garten and Martha Stewart's latke recipes for Hanukkah to compare the two celebrity chefs' recipes.",
    "fullText": "The recipe lists potatoes, an egg, flour, salt, and pepper.\n\nI was surprised to find that the recipe called for frying the latkes in clarified butter, rather than oil. Eating foods fried in oil is part of Hanukkah tradition, so I was a bit skeptical about this change.\n\nI managed to cut myself almost immediately. Grate with caution.\n\nThe resulting batter had the consistency of oatmeal.\n\nThe recipe includes instructions for how to make clarified butter. You can also just buy ghee at a grocery store and skip this step.\n\nThe process reminded me of skimming the fat off the top of chicken soup. It was easy, but it took extra time waiting for the solids to settle.\n\nGarten's recipe instructs using a tablespoon of the potato mixture for each latke.\n\nI also loved that frying the latkes in butter didn't make my entire apartment and person smell like oil. It's a strong scent that tends to linger. These just smelled mildly like melted butter, which was amazing.\n\nSince no additional ingredients were added to the batter, the potato flavor shone through, and the buttery crust was delicious.\n\nIt didn't have the oily taste of a traditional latke, but I actually preferred the milder taste of butter.\n\nStewart's recipe involved twice the amount of potatoes and eggs that were in Garten's, as well as additions like grated onion and beer.\n\nStewart's recipe says to reserve this potato juice, let the milky starch sink to the bottom, and pour off the liquid — similar to the clarified butter I made for Garten's recipe.\n\nGrated onions are standard in latke recipes — beer, not as much. I was curious to see how it would affect the flavor and texture.\n\nThe larger latkes took much longer to fry than Garten's, and they were a little more unruly to flip. I'm still trying to get a resulting oil splash out of my favorite jeans.\n\nI could already tell that these latkes were going to be the more traditional of the two.\n\nI couldn't taste the beer, but the grated onion and the crispy, oily goodness created a sharper flavor that screamed Hanukkah to me.\n\nEven though they're not fried in oil — which is kind of the point of eating them on this holiday — I enjoyed Garten's latkes more because they were easier and faster to make, and they had a mild, buttery flavor that I loved. Stewart's recipe, however, is perfect for traditionalists.",

Managers of collateralized loan obligations are banking on falling borrowing costs, rekindled M&A activity and looming debt maturities to fuel demand for the debt, which private equity firms and other buyers often use for leveraged buyouts and mergers. That’s even as a mismatch in supply and demand, and tightening spreads on leveraged loans have made returns challenging.",

    "description": "Andrew Left is headed for a big legal fight in 2026. Business Insider viewed his conversation with Claude to see how he's prepping for the case.",
    "fullText": "Famed short-seller Andrew Left is in the legal fight of his life, set to stand trial in March on allegations of market manipulation and making false and misleading social-media posts about his trading plans.\n\nAs he prepares to battle the feds, one of the places he's gone to for help is Claude. No, that's not the name of his defense lawyer. Claude, in this case, is Anthropic's popular AI chatbot.\n\nBusiness Insider recently got a look at how Left is using artificial intelligence in connection with his criminal case when he included a chat log during an email exchange with us.\n\nIt showed Left peppering Claude with questions and even asking it to draft a letter that his human legal team could, hypothetically, send to the Department of Justice.\n\nIt started with a simple but important question from the outspoken investor behind Citron Research: \"is this good or bad for andrew left\".\n\nLeft, who said he didn't mean to send the chat log to Business Insider, later explained he had uploaded to Claude a document related to his case and wanted a quick, easy-to-understand analysis.\n\n\"If you're ever in a court case, you just get something from the DOJ — instead of reading eight pages, you just put it into AI,\" he said after Business Insider asked him about the log. \"You go, 'What does this mean?'\"\n\nLeft, 55, became something of a market celebrity a decade ago after he raised serious claims about the business practices of Valeant Pharmaceuticals, which was later investigated by federal prosecutors, regulators, and Congress.\n\nHe has also predicted the business woes of companies like Nikola and Hertz, which gave his research reports market-moving sway.\n\nIn filing criminal charges last year, federal prosecutors alleged that Left took trading positions contrary to those market moves in order to reap quick profits. They say he manipulated prices over roughly five years across at least 23 different stocks and made false statements to regulators about coordinating his trades with hedge funds.\n\nThe docket for his case shows seven attorneys who previously or currently represent Left. But Claude, which has been gaining traction with lawyers, apparently came in handy one day last month.\n\nEric Rosen, a partner at Dynamis LLP, one of the firms representing Left, told Business Insider that AI can be valuable as a tool for understanding complex legal materials but cautioned against relying on it too much.\n\n\"It gives you a lot of feedback that you want to hear,\" he said. \"But, you don't know how a judge is going to react to some of these arguments.\"\n\nAlthough Business Insider only saw a portion of Left's conversation with Claude, it was clear that the document he uploaded had something to do with Nvidia. That made sense since the federal indictment alleges Left took a bullish position in the chipmaker's stock in November 2018, tweeted a lofty price target for it, then sold shares hours later, after they spiked.\n\nIn an answer to Left's query about the document, Claude had what sounded like good news, saying it revealed \"critical weaknesses\" in the government's case that was \"potentially very good\" for him.\n\nIt then listed four \"major problems\" with the Justice Department case and offered four \"best defenses\":\n\nLeft volleyed back at the chatbot, playfully patting himself on the back — and Claude gave him positive reinforcement.\n\nThe chatbot then singled out a specific thing that Left had tweeted, that Nvidia would reach \"$165 before $120.\" (It was at about $144 at the time.) Claude pointed out that the stock actually bottomed out at $124 in December before rising to $160 by June 2019.\n\n\"You were spectacularly right at a critical inflection point,\" the chatbot reassured Left.\n\nIn the same response, Claude broke down what it sees as the \"real issue\":\n\nLeft's next two prompts dealt with a stock split announced by Nvidia. The end goal of his inquiries was to show that — factoring in splits — he was directionally correct with his bullish price target on Nvidia stock.\n\nAfter Claude laid out an analysis reassuring Left that his Nvidia forecast was ultimately correct, he followed up with:\n\nAnd then here's what Claude said about the \"legal implication\":\n\n(Note that the supposed 1,300% gain is based on an incorrectly calculated current stock price for Nvidia. It is trading at around $176 a share, not the split-adjusted $1,931 used by Claude.)\n\nLeft wasn't done. He asked Claude to put all his responses into a letter addressed to the DOJ from his attorney. His only suggestion was to make it \"not AI sounding.\"\n\nAfter it returned a roughly 250-word block of text, Left had another edit:\n\nThat got it down to about 150 words. What next?\n\nEver-obedient, Claude spat out this:\n\nMatthew Cain, whose name surfaced when Claude analyzed the document, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nLeft said that for him, the AI served as a kind of thought partner.\n\n\"I was writing because I wanted to figure out, as we were going into this case and my attorneys met with the Department of Justice, how to try and explain it,\" he told Business Insider.\n\nLeft noted that he'd seen the AI misinterpret the law, but he does not worry about the chatbot's hallucinations.\n\n\"I run all ideas to just see the other side of the argument,\" he said. \"It definitely opens your mind up, but you cannot rely on it for matters of law.\"\n\nAnthropic, the makers of the Claude chatbot, did not respond to Business Insider's request for a comment. The Justice Department also did not comment.\n\nIt's not clear if Claude's text for a letter ever made its way to Left's defense team or to prosecutors, but he didn't sell it short to us. In fact, he told Business Insider that Claude is his favorite AI.",

    "description": "David Chung shares how his mother's immigrant journey inspired him to build a multimillion-dollar beauty business from the ground up.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with David Chung, owner and chairman of Amare Global. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI couldn't believe there was a banana just sitting on the kitchen table. In Korea, having a banana was a big deal, but when I immigrated to New York City at 12, we had fruit and even M&Ms. Everything was so luxurious.\n\nMy mother immigrated to the US in 1963 with less than $100. When she arrived in New York, she started a small, mom-and-pop gift shop. She grew the business through and eventually got her green card. I joined her about eight years later, in the middle of a New York winter. I didn't speak the language, but I felt lucky to be in the US.\n\nMy mother continued to grow her store, expanding into a drugstore and pharmacy. By the early 2000s, she had a business worth tens of millions.\n\nShe was very, very entrepreneurial. Watching her journey inspired me and has carried over even today. I have a lot of her DNA when it comes to business. Now that I'm 66, I'll think, \"I'm just like my mother!\" It's scary.\n\nMy mom's business set the stage for mine. Working in her shop, I saw that beauty products provided a great business opportunity. The products are small, which reduces warehousing and shipping costs. They're consumable, so customers return again and again. And even if the economy is bad, people don't give up on their skin.\n\nI went to college, but I found it difficult to concentrate because I was always thinking about starting my business. Even today, I don't drive much because I get so distracted thinking about running my companies (instead, I use a driver). Eventually, I graduated with a degree in engineering.\n\nRight next to my school, there was a small video rental store. These were the days before Blockbuster. I bought that store when I was 23, and expanded it slowly to sell gifts and cosmetics.\n\nThat was my start in business. Other than my mom, I've never worked for anyone else. That meant I had to learn hard lessons about business structure, processes, and systems on my own.\n\nOver time, I pivoted from retail to research, design, and manufacturing. In 2018, I sold my shares in one company for $53.7 million. In 2021, I sold my company, Farmacy Beauty, for hundreds of millions (I'm not allowed to share the specific amount). I remember being at my computer on December 31st, watching the funds being deposited into my account. I didn't feel anything. I didn't think \"I'm rich now.\" I didn't even go out to dinner to celebrate.\n\nEntrepreneurship has never been about money for me. It's more about the accomplishment and excitement of building something. I remember the first time I was in a room with people who had more credentials than me. I came up with an idea they hadn't considered. That's the first time I realized that I had a different way of thinking about things.\n\nI have a huge amount of money now — I could never spend it all. And yet, when those funds hit my account, I didn't buy a Rolex or a fancy car. I went out and bought another company to run.\n\nRecently, I told an employee that I'm going to retire in three years. She laughed and said I told her the same thing 15 years ago.\n\nI don't think I will ever retire fully. God has given me a talent for being business-minded and good at what I'm doing. I want to utilize that as long as I'm able to.\n\nMy mother was very passionate about giving back, particularly to the Korean American community. I figure the more money I make, the more I can give back. So, why not use this skill?",

    "fullText": "Dec 14 (Reuters) - iRobot (IRBT), the maker of the Roomba vacuum cleaner, filed for bankruptcy protection on Sunday, saying that it would go private after being bought by Picea Robotics, its primary ​manufacturer.\n\nThe company, which raised concerns about staying in business in March, filed for Chapter 11 protection ‌in Delaware bankruptcy court as it grapples with increased competition from lower-priced rivals and new U.S. tariffs.\n\niRobot generated about $682 million in total ‌revenue in 2024, but its profits have been eroded by competition from Chinese rivals like Ecovacs Robotics. iRobot remains dominant in key markets like the U.S. and Japan, but competition forced it to lower its prices and make substantial investments in technological upgrades, according to bankruptcy court filings.\n\nNew U.S. tariffs have also harmed the company, especially a 46% ⁠levy on imports from Vietnam, where ‌iRobot manufactures vacuum cleaners for the U.S. market. The tariffs raised the company’s costs by $23 million in 2025, while making it more difficult to plan for the future, according ‍to iRobot's court filings.\n\nThe company, which was the target of a thwarted $1.4 billion buyout by Amazon.com, has about $190 million in debt.\n\nThe debt stems from a 2023 loan that iRobot used to refinance its operations while a European competition investigation stalled the ​Amazon (AMZN) deal.\n\nAfter the Amazon deal fell apart and iRobot fell behind on payments to Picea, the China-based ‌manufacturer acquired iRobot's debt from a group of investment funds managed by the Carlyle Group, according to court documents.\n\nThe stock fell 83% during premarket trading on Monday.\n\nUnder iRobot's bankruptcy plan, Picea will take 100% of the company's equity and cancel the $190 million remaining on the 2023 loan, as well as an additional $74 million debt that iRobot owes to Picea under the companies' manufacturing agreement.\n\nOther creditors and suppliers will be paid in full, according to iRobot's bankruptcy court filings.\n\niRobot said the bankruptcy ⁠is not expected to disrupt its app functionality, customer programs, global ​partners, supply chain relationships or product support.\n\nThe loss-making company was valued ​at $3.56 billion in 2021, driven by pandemic-fueled demand, but it is now worth around $140 million, according to data compiled by LSEG.\n\niRobot was founded in 1990 by three Massachusetts Institute ‍of Technology roboticists. It initially ⁠focused on defense and space work before debuting the Roomba robotic vacuum in 2002.\n\nThe Roomba was an immediate success and it holds about 42% of the U.S. market share and 65% of the Japanese ⁠market share for robotic vacuum cleaners, according to the company.",

    "description": "American has axed first class for a single business cabin with beds and doors. The plane is overall chic and modern, but there's a row I'd avoid.",
    "fullText": "Out with the old and in with the new: American Airlines' niche cross-country Airbus jet is getting a major upgrade.\n\nOn Thursday, I toured American's first-ever Airbus A321XLR — a stretched narrowbody that can fly up to 5,400 miles (11 hours) nonstop thanks to an extra fuel tank. It's the first among US carriers.\n\nAmerican's A321XLR will replace roughly a dozen of its aging A321T jets that fly select domestic routes. The \"T\" stands for transcontinental, and the specific aircraft type is an Airbus A321-200.\n\nFor about a decade, the A321T has shuttled high-paying business and first-class passengers across the US as American's bi-coastal workhorse.\n\nThe modern A321XLR, which will launch its first cross-country route from New York to Los Angeles on December 18, retains the A321T's signature three-class layout and enhanced meal and drink service.\n\nBut the most premium cabins will feature a distinctly different design. There's no more first class; instead, a single front business cabin in a 1x1 configuration will give travelers direct aisle access.\n\nThere is also a premium economy cabin. And the coach cabin has been fine-tuned with more comfortable seats, USB-C outlets, and Bluetooth-compatible seatback screens.\n\nFares on New York—Los Angeles flights hover around $200 round-trip in economy, $1,000 in premium economy, and $2,000 in business in early 2026, rising during the busier spring break, summer, and holiday seasons.\n\nUnlike the A321T, the A321XLR will also fly transatlantic routes, beginning with New York to Edinburgh in March and eventually expanding to other European destinations. Tickets start at $600 in coach, $2,700 in premium economy, and $3,700 in business before peak-season increases.\n\nTransatlantic flying is central to the A321XLR's appeal: its range makes longer routes viable and opens access to far-flung cities that can't support a widebody (e.g., a Boeing 767 or an Airbus A330) or are out of reach for older narrowbodies. Think New York to West Africa or Florida to Northern Italy.\n\nAmerican sees the A321XLR as an opportunity to tap into this growing market for long, thin transatlantic routes while rebuilding a long-haul footprint to catch up to Delta and United, which have recovered and expanded faster post-COVID.\n\nStill, it also marks the end of an era for the A321T. But I think most customers will likely welcome the upgrades — particularly business class' sliding doors and easier bathroom access.\n\nThough there are a few asterisks: American said the doors won't be usable for a couple of months, and economy passengers in row 25 should expect a windowless view.\n\nAmerican has abandoned its A321T Flagship First for a single Flagship Business cabin with 20 private pod-like suites.\n\nThere are also 12 premium economy recliners, and 123 regular economy seats. This is down from the 190 on the A321T\n\nAmerican designed the A321XLR to cater to high-paying business and leisure passengers who want added space and comforts at 39,000 feet, and the dated A321T was no longer cutting it.\n\nFitting a suite-style business seat onto a narrowbody jet is a careful game of Tetris to ensure every foot of cabin real-estate is making money.\n\nAnd American packed in a lot: a bed, a large tray table, a Bluetooth-capable screen, a remote control, charging ports, and storage space.\n\nI liked all the amenities and found the cabin to be chic, modern, and spacious overall.\n\nThe A321XLR suites are arranged in a 1x1 layout — a major upgrade from the A321T's 2x2 business configuration that essentially trapped window-seat passengers whenever their neighbor went lie-flat.\n\nNow, every A321XLR business-class passenger gets direct aisle access. The A321T's first class is 1×1.\n\nAmong the biggest comfort requests from premium travelers worldwide is better privacy in business class.\n\nThe A321XLR achieves this with a redesigned layout and sliding doors that give it the feel of a flying mini-hotel.\n\nThe bulkier business seats narrow the cabin's single aisle to the point where there's barely any room to squeeze by another person. That tight space could create bottlenecks near the lavatory or make the aisle impassable during meal service.\n\nAnother caveat: an American spokesperson told Business Insider that the new sliding door can't be used until the airline secures certification for the feature, which they said is expected in the \"coming months.\"\n\nJetBlue Airways offers a two-passenger front-row \"Mint Studio\" on its A321LR (the A321XLR's predecessor). It's a conference-style setup that allows the airline to charge a premium for the extra space.\n\nAmerican's A321XLR lacks this suite, meaning it can't capture the potential extra revenue, but it preserves lucrative cabin real estate.\n\nUnlike the A321T, American's A321XLR will have a dedicated premium economy section.\n\nThe 2×2 cabin features winged recliners, adjustable leg and footrests, elevated food and beverage options, 37 inches of pitch, and an amenity kit. Customers also get priority check-in and boarding.\n\nAlthough the recliners do not offer the same bedroom-like experience as those at the front of the plane, they are sometimes hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars more expensive than coach.\n\nCustomers can expect the standard seatback screen, adjustable headrests, 31-inch pitch seats, and food already offered on American's A321T and most transatlantic flights.\n\nExtra legroom seats make up the first few coach rows and are distinguished by their brown headrests.

    "description": "In this Sunday edition of Business Insider Today, we're talking about the founders under 27 who are starting their own tech companies.",
    "fullText": "Welcome back to our Sunday edition, where we round up some of our top stories and take you inside our newsroom. Burnout is common. For $130,000 a week, this burnout clinic treats CEOs, founders, and ultra-high-net-worth individuals who require discreet and private care. Included: medical treatments, a midday IV, a personal trainer, and a private chef.\n\nBut first: The new wave of leaders is young.\n\nIf this was forwarded to you, Download Business Insider's app here.\n\nForget big lecture halls, dream internships, or comfy full-time jobs.\n\nThere's a growing cohort of young professionals who are approaching their careers differently. They're torching the traditional playbook and doing things their own way in an effort to reshape industries and solve global challenges.\n\nWe've spent the past year interviewing \"young geniuses\" — the next wave of leaders, innovators, and builders who are taking unconventional approaches to work, some as early as high school.\n\nThese folks aren't just making a living, either. They're earning serious dough at a young age by building AI tools, moving fast, and raising money from investors willing to bet big on the AI race.\n\nBusiness Insider spoke to 16 young founders this year who have collectively raised over $100 million. They're under the age of 27. Many are even teenagers.\n\nHere are some of their stories and advice for others.\n\nZach Yadegari sold his first app at 16 and cofounded an AI-powered nutrition app while he was still in high school. It's generating around $30 million annually. \"My advice to anyone would be to get started. Ignore the noise, ignore the people telling you that it's impossible to do it at a young age, and ignore the people trying to push you down a specific path to accomplish your goals.\"\n\nChristine Zhang turned down an internship to spend two months building an AI startup with her college roommate. By the end of the summer, they raised $1 million. She's taking a gap year from Harvard to focus on the startup. \"I had to delete my Instagram during the first week of classes so I wouldn't get FOMO. However, I don't regret my decision, and the feeling of missing out has definitely improved over time.\"\n\nArlan Rakhmetzhanov dropped out of high school to launch an AI coding agent startup that's raised $6.2 million. Both of his parents are entrepreneurs. He taught himself to code and founded his first company at the age of 15. \"Being young gives you a head start. There's still time if you fail, which is why young people try crazy things.\"\n\nAre you a young genius? In awe of what the kids are doing these days? Drop me a line and let me know what you think — srussolillo@businessinsider.com\n\nWhat are the values that define America? Liberty, patriotism — and thievery, as it turns out. From petty shoplifting to return fraud, everyday Americans are becoming small-time scammers.\n\nThey're not stealing from everyone — just the companies they deem big enough to weather the loss, or those they think are making money off their backs. But too much Robin Hood-ing could have unintended consequences for small businesses … and the rest of us who are still paying for things.\n\nWhile much of the broader labor market has been marked by slow hiring, it's also been cushioned by low levels of firing. That's not the case for the tech industry, though.\n\nUS tech companies have announced roughly 154,000 layoffs through November, according to Challenger. That's a 17% increase from the prior year and the most of any private-sector industry. These cuts have fueled fierce competition for roles. BI spoke to more than 20 tech professionals who are struggling to find work.\n\n\"It feels like recruiters are looking for Superman.\"\n\nWhen a jury returned an $11.5 million verdict to a former SHRM employee who sued for racial discrimination, CEO Johnny Taylor sent a clear message: The fight isn't over yet.\n\nIn a video seen by Business Insider, Taylor said the case lacked merit and would go down as \"just a blip in the history of SHRM.\" The company said in a LinkedIn post that it planned to appeal the decision.\n\nWhen Sima Sistani left her role as CEO at WeightWatchers, she called Oprah for advice. She told Sistani to take a year to say no to everything. Now, Sistani is an adjunct professor at Duke University, teaching a course on women's leadership.\n\nFor BI's Power Hours series, Sistani shared what a typical day in her life looks like — from reading a physical newspaper and prepping talking points for her class, to ending the day with a romance fantasy novel.\n\nDaily affirmations and less time on phones.\n\n\"It's a zero-sum game they're losing, and it's only going to get worse.\"\n\n— Doug Shapiro, a media analyst and senior advisor at BCG, on media companies struggling to get people to engage with their content following Disney's deal with OpenAI.\n\nBI rode a Rivian spin-off e-bike around New York City\n\nBike fanatic and BI correspondent Jack Newsham took Also's TM-B e-bike for a spin around the city. Here's what happened.\n\nExclusive: Meta plans price hike for its virtual reality devices, internal memo shows.\n\nThe BI Today team: Steve Russolillo, chief news editor, in New York.

    "description": "Rivian's autonomy chief James Philbin told Business Insider that the cost of lidar, a sensor that can be found in robotaxis, is no longer expensive.",
    "fullText": "For Rivian's chief of autonomy, the decision to put in lidar for the EV company's coming R2 SUV was obvious.\n\nJames Philbin, Rivian's VP of autonomy and AI, told Business Insider that the price of lidar has decreased significantly enough in recent years to be able to put the sensor inside a personally-owned, mass-production vehicle.\n\n\"It's been on this incredible cost curve, where 10 years ago, it would be just unimaginable that you could put a lidar on a consumer vehicle. And now it's getting into that price point, kind of in the range of a radar,\" Philbin said. Radar, a sensor that uses radio waves, is commonly seen in modern cars that have an advanced driver-assistance system (ADAS) or blind spot detection.\n\nLidar is a sensor that uses laser light to measure depth. While it's historically been used for topography, the sensor has gained more visibility in the automotive world with the advent of self-driving cars.\n\nMost notably, Waymo's robotaxis have multiple lidar sensors, including the spinning lidar on the roof of the vehicle. Waymo has said that lidar provides additional safety to the vehicle's AI driver.\n\nOn Thursday, Rivian announced a road map to fully autonomous driving, which includes building an in-house chip and installing a lidar sensor in the company's coming SUV, the R2.\n\nPhilbin, who previously worked at Zoox and Waymo, told Business Insider that lidar makes an autonomous system \"more robust\" and can help the company get to its self-driving goal \"faster.\"\n\n\"It's very affordable,\" he said. \"The performance it gives you for that cost is really amazing. And so to me, it's kind of a no-brainer that you would want more sensors and more modalities for something that's so safety critical.\"\n\nUsing lidar diverges from the strategy of Rivian's main EV competitor, Tesla, which has taken a strong stance on pursuing self-driving with cameras only.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk once called lidar an expensive \"crutch.\"\n\nIn the late 2000s, during the days of the Google Self-Driving Car Project, a single lidar unit could come with a five-figure price tag. Today, industry leaders say a similar unit could cost a few hundred dollars.\n\nRivian employees, including Philbin, did not disclose the cost of the lidar unit in the R2 when asked by Business Insider.\n\nR2 will first be launched without the sensor in early 2026. It's slated to be Rivian's cheapest car to date, with a starting price of $45,000. The company aims to launch an R2 with lidar in late 2026.\n\nWhen asked what the cost difference was to put a lidar in the R2, Philbin declined to comment but said that it was \"not a significant consideration.\"",

    "fullText": "A manager at a successful small business was stunned to receive what looked like a phishing email: a request to Venmo $100 to the company president. The supposed reason? A group gift for the owner. But it wasn’t a scam. It was real. And, apparently, not optional.\n\nThe Reddit post, shared under r/smallbusiness, came from an employee who had only been at the 80-person company for less than a year. The business brings in around $50 million in revenue and has no debt. Despite being happy in the role overall, the manager was taken aback by the unexpected demand.\n\nThe AI Marketing Platform Backed by Insiders from Google, Meta, and Amazon — Invest at $0.85/Share\n\nDeloitte's #1 Fastest-Growing Software Company Lets Users Earn Money Just by Scrolling — Accredited Investors Can Still Get In at $0.50/Share.\n\n“Each person's contribution is $100. Please Venmo me when you have a chance,” the email read. It was sent to 17 managers, totaling a $1,700 contribution to cover a luxury fish subscription for the company owner. The message came from the president, who also happens to be the owner’s nephew and is reportedly being groomed to take over the business.\n\n“My first instinct was to report the email as phishing because I thought there’s no way this guy is asking us all to Venmo him $100,” the original poster wrote. But upon closer inspection, it was legit: “Head of HR and IT were both on the To line.”\n\nThe tone of the email didn’t make the contribution sound optional, and the employee questioned the whole premise. “Can’t we just get the guy a tie? Isn’t our gift to him the labor we put in to make him his several million dollar salary?”\n\nTrending: 7 Million Gamers Already Trust Gameflip With Their Digital Assets — Now You Can Own a Stake in the Platform\n\nCommenters flooded in, and the consensus was apparent. Most business owners said they’d be horrified if their staff gave them an expensive gift. “This is batsh*t unhinged behavior,” one owner wrote. “Gifts flow down, not up,” another said. Several owners said they prefer to give holiday bonuses and thoughtful gifts to their employees, not the other way around.\n\nOne commenter summed it up: “I would be beyond pissed at whoever arranged this and I would pay everyone back.”\n\nThere was also concern about power dynamics. “The fact that it’s a family member in a superior position to all of those he is collecting $100 from seems strange,” another wrote. Some even speculated the nephew was setting a precedent for his own leadership style, or worse, trying to pocket the money.",

    "description": "As McDonald's prices have soared in recent years, the chain's corporate leadership plans a change that could affect how much a meal at the restaurant costs.",
    "fullText": "About 95% of McDonald's locations across the globe are operated by franchisees, who normally set their restaurants' pricing. But soon, McDonald's corporate office will start judging how well those franchisees' prices attract and retain customers. \"Effective January 1, 2026, we are enhancing our global franchising standards across all Segments to reinforce accountability for value leadership,\" Andrew Gregory, McDonald's senior vice president of global franchising, development, and delivery, stated in a memo, per CNBC. Those new standards will give McDonald's franchisees \"greater clarity ... to ensure every restaurant delivers consistent, reliable value across the full customer experience,\" Gregory explained.\n\nAs part of this effort, the corporation will offer company-backed \"pricing consultants, tools, and other levels that support informed choices and elevate the overall guest experience across all order points,\" Mason Smoot, McDonald's USA chief restaurant officer said in another memo to franchisees, according to CNBC. Restaurant operators will be graded on how well they use these tools and adhere to guidelines. McDonald's will penalize franchisees who don't live up to the new standards with penalties that range from being forbidden to expand to the termination of the current agreement.\n\nMcDonald's is making its latest standard enhancement move at a time when the restaurant industry continues to struggle with rising food and labor costs. As a result, restaurant prices have gone up 34% since 2019 across the nation, CNN reported in April 2025, a pace that's much faster than the overall growth of inflation. And that trend has caused people already dealing with price jumps for essential household items to eat at casual and fast-food dining spots less often.\n\nMcDonald's franchisees have increased prices by about 40% since 2019, according to Restaurant Business. To keep affordable options on its menu, the corporate office has launched extra value meal (EVM) plans in September 2025. And while sales grew globally by about 3.6% in third quarter of 2025, they were still below Wall Street expectations, CNBC reported. A big reason for that is traffic from lower-income customers fell by \"nearly double digits in the third quarter, a trend that's persisted for nearly two years,\" Christopher Kempczinski, McDonald's chairman and CEO said in a November 2025 earnings call, per Seeking Alpha. And the only way to solve that is to fix customers' \"value perceptions\" on the meals the restaurants offer. \"We heard our customers loud and clear on the need to deliver everyday value and affordability across their favorite items on our menu board,\" Kempczinski said.",

    "title": "Dell's computer prices are about to rise for corporate clients. Here's what to expect, and what it's telling sales staff.",
    "description": "Dell is increasing its prices on December 17 amid a global memory chip supply crisis. Business Insider obtained a list of price changes.",
    "fullText": "Your company's Dell laptops are about to cost more.\n\nStarting December 17, the computer maker is set to hike prices across its commercial product lines, according to an internal list of upcoming price changes sent to staff on December 9 and seen by Business Insider.\n\nThe list outlines price hikes for Dell's commercial business — meaning its sales to corporate clients rather than individual consumers. The commercial business accounts for about 85% of Dell's annual revenue in the Client Solutions Group (CSG), the division that sells laptops and PCs, according to its latest annual results.\n\nThe company is one of the leading providers of computer hardware to US companies, and prices aren't just rising at Dell. An industry-wide shortage of memory and storage chips is driving up costs across the PC industry, affecting competitors like Lenovo and HP as well.\n\nThe soaring demand for AI infrastructure has tech companies snapping up enormous quantities of memory and storage chips, increasing competition for consumer devices.\n\nA Dell spokesperson told Business Insider that \"like others in the industry, Dell takes targeted pricing action, when necessary, while maintaining supply continuity and its commitment to customer value.\"\n\n\"Our supply chain is resilient and globally diverse. It's designed to offer the needed flexibility when navigating macroeconomic, regulatory and trade dynamics,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nHow much more expensive a laptop at Dell will be next week depends on how much memory and storage you require.\n\nThe global shortages are hitting two key types of chips that are essential components in most user devices: DRAM and NAND.\n\nWhen you buy a laptop, DRAM — dynamic random-access memory — is the memory, usually 8GB to 32GB for an average customer. NAND — non-volatile flash memory — is used for SSD storage, typically around 512GB or 1TB.\n\nFrom next week, Dell Pro and Pro Max notebooks and desktops with 32GB of memory will cost between $130 and $230 more, according to the list of price changes seen by Business Insider. If opting for the top-of-the-range 128GB memory, the price is set to rise by between $520 and $765 per device.\n\nSelecting a laptop with 1 TB of storage will add to the overall cost by between $55 and $135.\n\nAn employee at Dell who works in sales said the percentage increase would be \"between 10% and 30%\" depending on the contract. They asked to remain anonymous as they are not permitted to speak publicly, but Business Insider has verified their employment.\n\nThe price list also includes price hikes for AI laptops containing Nvidia Blackwell GPUs and individual monitors. For example, a Dell Pro 55 Plus 4K Monitor, currently listed on Dell's website at $1,349.99, will be $150 more expensive, according to the price list.\n\nAI laptops containing an Nvidia RTX PRO 500 Blackwell GPU with 6GB will become $66 more expensive, and a 24GB GPU will cost $530 more, the pricing chart shows.\n\n\"It's impacting everyone, and there's no way around it currently, so customers will just have to pay more if they want the products,\" the sales employee said.\n\nHigher prices make for a tougher sell, already a challenge for sales teams amid today's tariff-weary consumers and enterprises.\n\nDell sent an email to its \"go-to-market\" (GTM) sales staff on November 25, which Business Insider has seen, outlining the \"critical next steps\" sellers should take to prepare ahead of the increase.\n\n\"Global memory and storage supply are tightening fast,\" Dell warned GTM team members.\n\nThe price of contracts for DRAM and NAND chips has \"already risen significantly this quarter, and suppliers are signaling further increases and allocation constraints driven by AI demand,\" Dell said in the email.\n\nThe company told its sellers to \"move decisively\" ahead of the price increases to \"protect value for our customers and for Dell.\"\n\nThe email advised teams to engage with top accounts in the coming week, close deals, and plan significant opportunities and multi-quarter deals to protect the sales pipeline.\n\n\"Ordering today for future delivery DOES NOT lock in current pricing,\" Dell warned, but said that acting now would help customers stay ahead of \"significant anticipated memory increase.\"\n\nThe Dell sales employee said that there had been an initial rush to help customers buy remaining inventory, but now the situation is largely viewed as \"out of our control.\"\n\nThe employee said Dell was also absorbing some of the costs internally, through hits to margins and limiting discounts that sales staff can offer.\n\nIn the company's third-quarter earnings call on November 25, Jeff Clarke, Dell's COO and vice chairman, said the market's price increases were \"unprecedented.\"\n\n\"We have not seen costs move at the rate that we've seen,\" Clarke said. \"Demand is way ahead of supply. And as we wade our way through that, we're going to lean on the things that we've always done.\"\n\nTech companies are buying massive amounts of DRAM and NAND to power AI models and cloud services, leaving fewer chips for consumer devices.\n\nCombined with global supply-chain tensions, the explosion in demand has prompted the three companies that dominate the DRAM market — Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron — to raise their prices.\n\nDRAM prices are expected to rise 30% in the final quarter of 2025, having already increased by 50% so far this year, according to Counterpoint, a global technology market research firm.\n\n\"The entire supply chain simply can't meet the demand that is now required and that inevitably leads to these kinds of challenges,\" Bob O'Donnell, the president and chief analyst at Technalysis Research, told Business Insider.\n\nThese price increases will \"likely have a noticeable impact for all types of PCs from every PC vendor,\" said O'Donnell, adding that the supply shortage is expected to continue throughout 2026.\n\nHave a tip?

    "title": "Nvidia staffer called Microsoft's cooling system for Blackwell GPUs 'wasteful,' internal email shows",
    "description": "An internal memo, obtained by Business Insider, assessed Microsoft's deployment of cutting-edge GPUs.",
    "fullText": "As Nvidia works to install some of its newest chips in Microsoft data centers, an employee at the GPU giant observed in early fall that Microsoft's cooling approach at one facility seemed \"wasteful.\"\n\nNvidia has been deploying its GB200 Blackwell architecture at Microsoft and other tech giants as demand for compute to train and run AI models surges.\n\nBlackwell, announced in March 2024, is roughly twice as powerful as its predecessor, Hopper, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said at launch. GB200 is part of an earlier wave of Blackwell deployments, with the GB300 generation now available.\n\nIn early fall, an internal email sent by a staffer on the Nvidia Infrastructure Specialists (NVIS) team described one Blackwell installation of server racks for OpenAI, which Microsoft supports as its cloud partner and largest investor.\n\nThe email described the setup of two GB200 NVL72 racks, each of which houses 72 Nvidia GPUs. The setup uses liquid cooling technology, given the heat generated by multiple GPUs operating closely in tandem.\n\nThe staffer wrote that Microsoft's \"cooling system and data center cooling approach for their GB200 deployment seems wasteful due to the size and lack of facility water use, but does provide a lot of flexibility and fault tolerance,\" according to the memo.\n\nWhile liquid cooling is used for the servers, data centers also use a second, building-level system to expel heat from the facility, according to Shaolei Ren, an associate professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of California.\n\nThe Nvidia employee may have been referring to a building-level system that uses air-cooling instead of water, explained Ren, who studies how data centers use water and other resources.\n\n\"This type of cooling system tends to be using more energy,\" he said, \"but it doesn't use water.\"\n\nA Microsoft spokesperson described a cooling setup consistent with Ren's two-phase explanation.\n\n\"Microsoft's liquid cooling heat exchanger unit is a closed-loop system that we deploy in existing air-cooled data centers to enhance cooling capacity on first and third-party platforms,\" the Microsoft spokesperson told Business Insider in a statement.\n\n\"These systems ensure we maximize our existing global data center footprint for scale while promoting efficient heat dissipation and optimizing power delivery to meet the demands of AI and hyperscale systems,\" the spokesperson added.\n\nAs AI infrastructure expands, energy and water use in data-center cooling have become flashpoints globally, prompting pushback in some regions where new facilities are being built.\n\nRen noted that because data centers can use air cooling, water cooling, or a hybrid system at the building level, \"there's a trade-off\" between resources.\n\nAir cooling requires more energy, but can \"address some of the public concerns with water consumption — because water is something people can really see,\" he said.\n\n\"These companies are profit-driven,\" he added, \"they weigh in the water cost, the energy cost, and also the publicity cost.\"\n\nMicrosoft, for its part, said it intends to be \"carbon negative, water positive, and zero waste\" by 2030.\n\n\"We've also announced a zero water cooling design for our next-generation data centers and breakthroughs in on-chip cooling,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nThe internal email from the Nvidia staffer described some logistical hiccups that occurred during the Blackwell installation in early fall, which can be typical in the early deployment of new data center hardware.\n\n\"Onsite support for this activity was a necessity,\" the staffer wrote. \"Many hours were spent creating the validation process documentation as well as vetting the steps worked and made sense to those less familiar with how cluster and system validation is usually performed.\"\n\nAdditionally, the handover processes between Nvidia and Microsoft \"required a lot more solidification than what was performed before arrival.\"\n\nStill, the memo suggested Blackwell's production hardware quality had improved compared to early samples.\n\nThe email said GB200 NVL72 production hardware \"has good quality\" compared to the qualified samples sent to customers for early testing. Both racks had a 100% pass rate on certain compute performance tests.\n\nAn Nvidia spokesperson told Business Insider that its Blackwell systems \"deliver exceptional performance, reliability, and energy efficiency for a wide variety of computing applications.\"\n\n\"Our customers, including Microsoft, have successfully deployed hundreds of thousands of Blackwell GB200 and GB300 NVL72 systems to meet the world's growing need for artificial intelligence,\" the spokesperson said.",

    "description": "From making real estate investing more attainable to developing 500-square-foot homes to fit in your backyard, here's why these rising stars of real estate are the ones to watch in 2025.",
    "fullText": "Brick-and-mortar business has long been the foundation of real estate — figuratively and literally. But as the industry adapts to new technologies and rapidly changing market conditions, new leaders are stepping in to meet unique new challenges.\n\nEach year, Business Insider highlights up-and-coming agents, architects, founders, and other figures making an outsize impact in real estate. The process starts with nominations from CEOs, company presidents, and managing partners. To be considered, nominees must be US-based, under 40, and stand out from their peers. Business Insider's editors make the final selections.\n\nThis year's class of rising stars comes from a wide array of backgrounds, with prior expertise in everything from construction and marketing to private equity. From making real estate investing more attainable to developing 500-square-foot homes to fit in your backyard, they're addressing some of the industry's biggest challenges head-on.\n\nMeet Business Insider's 18 Rising Stars of Real Estate for 2025.\n\nTarek Afifi said his secret to success is his deep belief in the American dream.\n\nThe 28-year-old, who serves as the corporate finance and investor relations manager at Better Home & Finance, said he gets satisfaction from shaping investors' perception of the online mortgage lender — and helping the company's hard work get reflected in its stock price.\n\nHe attributes his success to how deeply he believes in Better's mission, and said the idea of helping Americans buy a home brings him satisfaction.\n\n\"Everyone wants to own equity in a home that they can live in, but also, build wealth off of,\" he said. \"What really attracted me to it, I think, is the fact that it really is applicable to all walks of life,\" he said of buying a home.\n\nBetter shares have soared more than 400% since April of last year, around the time Afifi joined the company. That's due to investor optimism on the company's future earnings growth, as well as a surge of interest in the stock after the hedge funder Eric Jackson made a high-profile bet on the company.\n\nBetter reported a net loss of $27 million in the second quarter, down from a $40 million net loss in the first quarter. Its funded loan volume for the quarter also rose to $1.2 billion, up 38% for the quarter.\n\nAfifi is optimistic about the direction of the residential real estate market over the next year. He expects refinance and mortgage activity to bloom in 2026 as the Fed continues to cut interest rates.\n\n\"Everyone's kind of positioning themselves for the refi rally,\" he said. \"So it's a symbiotic relationship and I think that it's something we're all looking forward to seeing.\"\n\nThe rate of Hispanic homeownership rose to a record 49.5% in 2023. Maria Barrios wants to make that statistic even higher.\n\nAs the executive director of operations and chief financial officer of the National Association of Hispanic Real Estate Professionals (NAHREP), Barrios is central to the nonprofit's mission to promote homeownership and expand access to credit in the Hispanic community through education and advocacy. As of 2025, the organization has 85 chapters nationwide, with an additional 30 in development and nearly 58,000 active members.\n\n\"While our mission is to promote sustainable Hispanic homeownership, we're about much more than that,\" Barrios told Business Insider. \"We understand that homeownership isn't the end goal for Hispanics; it's just the beginning of their financial journey.\"\n\nBarrios has played a key role in expanding the organization's reach, assisting with the launch of the AVANCE Global Conference, a business and media platform, and expanding internationally with AVANCE España in January 2026. She also supported the launch of the National Hispanic Construction Alliance (NHCA) and AVANCE Sports.\n\nOverall, Barrios has driven consistent 30% year-over-year revenue growth for the organization and helped launch an average of 10 new NAHREP chapters annually.\n\n\"The real estate industry faced a challenging market this year, but our biggest accomplishment was growing despite these difficulties,\" Barrios said.\n\nDerek Fitzgerald is the poster child for company loyalty. He's been at McCarthy, a national commercial construction company, since he left college 12 years ago, climbing the ranks to become the senior vice president of operations for the builder's San Francisco office.\n\nIt's a career he came to after finding a passion for the \"built environment\" while studying civil and environmental engineering at UC Berkeley.\n\nSince then, Fitzgerald has been part of a wide range of projects, from the renovation of a 350,000-square-foot naval hangar to the construction of a lab that produced the antiviral drug Remdesivir. The work is varied, and marries his varied set of skills.\n\n\"I didn't necessarily want to focus on the design part of it,\" Fitzgerald said. \"But I found this commercial real estate and construction environment that allowed me to merge my technical background with this passion that I have for people and bringing people together.\"\n\nFor most founders, selling their company marks the end of a journey. For Nick Friedman, it was the beginning of another chapter.\n\nFriedman's first chapter began at 19, when he dropped out of Williams College and set out to start a company that would \"change the world.\" After joining the famed Y Combinator program with Adam Pollack, the two launched lending startup Accept.inc in 2019. In 2022, they sold the company to the real estate technology company HomeLight.\n\nA lot of founders would've ridden into the sunset. Friedman stayed on board.\n\n\"I think that I told the CEO of HomeLight, 'I'm probably going to be your worst employee of all time,'\" Friedman told Business Insider. \"I am not going to listen to you. I'm going to want to do my own thing. I'm going to want to figure out how to grow this thing on my own. That's just who I am. And I don't think I'm going to last very long.\"\n\nThree years later, he's HomeLight's president of home equity, overseeing sales, operations, products, and compliance with everything associated with HomeLight's core lending product, Buy Before You Sell, which allows users to purchase their next home before selling their existing one.\n\nFriedman describes himself as an old soul, and said his willingness to get out and talk to people — instead of relying on social media or sending emails — has helped him connect with the right people and grow his career.\n\n\"We're not shy,\" he said. \"I think the reason a lot of younger founders today don't make it is because they are very shy.\"\n\nReal estate investment is often considered the easiest way to gain wealth in the US. But high barriers to entry prevent unseasoned investors or people with less capital from getting started.\n\nFractional real-estate investing, which allows people to invest in a portion of property instead of buying it outright, makes it easier for non-accredited investors to get started — a fact Mogul Club cofounder Joey Gumataotao recognized early on.\n\n\"My partner and I actually purchased our home right out of college with what very, very little savings we had from jobs that we worked in college and ended up renting out two of our bedrooms to two of my colleagues at Goldman,\" Gumataotao told BI. \"This is a real way to build wealth that wasn't there before.\"\n\nGumataotao started Mogul Club in 2022 alongside his cofounder Alex Blackwood, who he met while they were both working at Goldman Sachs. Blackwood was on the investment banking side, and Gumataotao was in real-estate investing on the private equity side.\n\nThey both wanted to make real-estate investing more accessible to everyone.\n\n\"Even as someone who was working for a large institution, I actually didn't have a ton of opportunity to invest in these lucrative multifamily, large multimillion-dollar investments myself,\" Gumataotao said.\n\nMogul Club allows investors from all financial backgrounds to invest as little as $250 toward a property in markets like Mesa, Arizona, or Ramsey, New Jersey.\n\nAs COO, Gumataotao still handles people management and fundraising responsibilities — Mogul Club is still in its seed-extension round — but he also gets his hands dirty working on the acquisition and supply side of the business.\n\n\"No matter how much we grow, I'll always prefer to be hands-on,\" he said. \"Real estate's my passion.\"\n\nZoe Heyman's role at Basis defies a simple job description. As vice president of investor relations at Basis, a commercial real estate investment firm, the 31-year-old oversees all marketing and investor communications, leads the publication of the company's annual Corporate Responsibility Report, and recently spearheaded the implementation of new technology to better track deals and streamline operations across the company.\n\nHer efforts aren't solely focused on the company's bottom line. As a leader on the People, Planet, Policy Committee, Heyman also organizes environmental-justice fundraisers and community cleanup activities for the firm's employees. Through her involvement in Basis' Capital Connect Initiative, Heyman also works to promote minority-led institutions and direct capital to underserved communities.\n\n\"Zoe Heyman brings a fresh perspective, a modern approach, and an unparalleled level of resourcefulness and initiative to her leadership role,\" said Leigh Roumila, head of investor relations at Basis.\n\nOnly two-and-a-half years into working in residential real estate, Jed Miciak knows it's his calling.\n\nMiciak is the senior vice president of marketing and revenue at Landing, a company that provides a collection of furnished apartments for shorter-term rentals. It's a job with some similarities to the decade he spent working at Hilton, where he helped grow the data analytics team and worked in global pricing.\n\nThis year, Miciak has helped grow Landing's portfolio of properties to about 500 nationally, up from 100 last year. He's also built AI models that use machine learning to identify potential problems, launched Landing's rebrand, and grown the company's online travel agency business while working with companies like Airbnb and Marriott.\n\nOver the next year, Miciak hopes to continue to grow supply and drive marketing efficiency higher — in addition to working toward an IPO down the line. He's motivated by all he's learned from being in the room with longtime real estate pros.\n\n\"I was able to be in these rooms with executives who have been in the space for a long time,\" Miciak said. \"I sat there and provided data at the time; it didn't really seem that valuable for my career. Now, looking back, seeing how these executives face the tough problems solves a lot of the issues running this global powerhouse. It's super helpful.\"\n\nJames Murray is tackling one of architecture's most challenging tasks: designing small spaces that are functional and stylish.\n\nMurray is the director of design at Samara, a modular startup spun out of Airbnb's research and development team. The California-based company's first product, Backyard, is an accessory dwelling unit, or ADU — a compact backyard home that can serve as an in-law suite, home office, or short-term rental.\n\nSamara is growing at a pivotal moment in real estate, as high housing costs prompt many homeowners across the country to stay put and find creative ways to expand their living space.\n\n\"ADU is an acronym that's been spreading across the US for some time, but in California specifically, it's become a very common type of home, one that's now almost ubiquitous as a solution for many people,\" Murray told Business Insider.\n\nSamara offers a suite of backyard ADUs, ranging from compact studios to XL models, measuring between 420 and 950 square feet. For each design, Murray applies a philosophy he calls \"empathetic affordances\" — the idea of creating spaces that respond to how people actually live and move through them.\n\n\"We're always aware of how we engage in a space,\" Murray said. \"Think about the size of a dining table or a bed in a bedroom. It's also about the right balance of space in that perfect kitchen triangle, where you can cook a meal while staying close to the refrigerator, stovetop, and sink.\"\n\nMurray's thoughtful designs have been integral to the company's success, helping Samara book more than $100 million in project value in California over the past year.\n\nWith the abundance of TikToks and Instagram Reels showcasing listings and giving homeownership advice, it's not hard to see the connection between real estate professionals and content creators today.\n\nBut when Griffin O'Brien launched his real-estate media company Estate Media in 2023, it took some time to convince others it was a good idea for a business.\n\n\"There was absolutely a challenge from day one,\" O'Brien told Business Insider of convincing major realtors and talent that being featured in Estate's content would be good for their brands and businesses.\n\nO'Brien, whose background in media spans consulting for Snapchat and working in content acquisition at Roku and Amazon's Prime Video, founded Estate Media with Andrew Shanfeld and \"Million Dollar Listing\" star Josh Flagg as a consulting firm, talent agency, and content-creation machine with a talent-focused approach to creating original content for the real estate industry.\n\nO'Brien said that Estate Media reaches close to 35 million people through its podcasts, newsletters, and shows on a number of social media platforms.\n\n\"We really did see an opportunity between the traditional publications — largely news-based publications — covering real estate and reality television to create content right around these leading voices,\" O'Brien said.\n\nMichael O'Connor has worked nonstop in real estate since he was 21. He has no intentions of changing that.\n\nO'Connor started in luxury real estate with Douglas Elliman, where he's been for nearly a decade. Now a sales associate for The Exclusive Group, a boutique real estate advisory group under Douglas Elliman, O'Connor specializes in South Florida luxury real estate, selling over $1 billion in properties alongside his business partner Nicholas Malinosky. The group was ranked number one in Florida and number two in the country for sales volume for medium-sized teams by The Wall Street Journal.\n\n\"That right there goes to show how hard we work for our clients and production,\" O'Connor said. \"That's definitely the greatest accomplishment over any one particular sale.\"\n\nOne of O'Connor's proudest transactions was for two contiguous oceanfront lots in Delray Beach that sold for a combined $44 million. He and Malinosky have done about 30 transactions a year, though they prioritize sales volume.\n\nBecause many of the buyers and sellers O'Connor works with are \"extremely sophisticated\" and \"typically the best at what they do,\" they want someone who will go above and beyond in guiding them through the process.\n\n\"T​​he phone is always going and you're always getting emails, so it starts early and it goes late,\" O'Connor said.\n\nThere was a time when Alex Redfearn thought things wouldn't work out.\n\nIn 2014, at the age of 25, he launched Redfearn Capital, a private equity firm specializing in commercial real estate, based in South Florida. At the time, he had no experience beyond a college case study he completed at his alma mater, the University of Miami.\n\nRedfearn told Business Insider that during the early years of building his business, he often considered walking away and starting over.\n\n\"I almost quit after the third year,\" he said. \"I tried to, but my wife wouldn't let me. I wanted to get a cabin and move to New York, but we stuck it out.\"\n\nTurns out, his wife was right. Since founding the company, Redfearn has built a portfolio exceeding $800 million in assets under management, spanning industrial real estate including small-bay, manufacturing, and logistics warehouses. Despite challenging economic conditions, such as tighter lending standards and higher interest rates, his firm continues to grow. In 2024, the company acquired 13 properties, generating a total revenue of $125 million.\n\nReflecting on his career, Redfearn said his company's success comes down to persistence — a quality he believes is essential for every young real estate entrepreneur.\n\n\"Do what you say you're going to do,\" Redfearn said. \"I think in my line of business, people often commit to something but don't always follow through. Success really comes down to doing what you said you were going to do.\"\n\nAlexis Rivas believed traditional homebuilding methods were outdated and sought to build homes with the same precision, speed, and cost efficiency as vehicles.\n\nSo in 2014, while still in school, Rivas and his fellow Cooper Union classmate Jemuel Joseph co-founded Cover, a prefab homebuilding company. In 2018, they designed and constructed their first accessory dwelling unit (ADU) — a compact, 500-square-foot, customizable backyard home.\n\n\"There's a huge housing shortage in the United States, and the problem is getting worse,\" Rivas told Business Insider. \"Our approach to solving this is by building homes in a factory with the same repeatability, quality, and scale as cars.\"\n\nLos Angeles-based Cover handles the permitting, design, and engineering process for its customers. Like automobile manufacturing, the company produces every component — from framing to doors and windows — on automotive-style production lines in its factory before assembling the home on-site. The production and installation process of their steel homes, which range from 150 to 1,200 square feet, typically takes 1-2 months, depending on size. ​​\n\nIn 2025, Cover expanded into full-size custom homes, and in October, it announced it was nearing completion of a rebuild of a house destroyed in the Pacific Palisades fires.\n\n\"Cover was always more than a backyard home company,\" Rivas said. \"Expanding to full homes feels like our original ambition becoming visible.\"\n\nA rural farm town in Northwest New Jersey might not be where you'd expect to find the architect responsible for some of the most exciting projects on the East Coast. But in Gensler's case, that's where they found JJ Rivers.\n\nRivers, who has already notched 10 years at global architecture firm Gensler at age 34, had an early appreciation for how things are built.\n\n\"I come from a pretty blue-collar family, so I've got a lot of aunts and uncles in different trades,\" Rivers told Business Insider. \"Growing up, I always had my hands on building things, whether it was at my childhood home or at my relative's home.\"\n\nToday, he's a principal and studio director in Gensler's DC office, and he also runs mixed-use development for the Southeast region. He manages a team of about 60 people, so his fingerprints are all over a number of projects on the East Coast, like Under Armour's new global headquarters in Baltimore.\n\nBecause of the diverse differences in architecture up and down the coast, Rivers is always encountering new challenges. Not that he minds.\n\n\"It just provides you different opportunities,\" he said.\n\nA lot has changed since Luke Robinson joined WeWork more than a decade ago, when the coworking firm was in startup mode and had only a handful of buildings.\n\nOverseeing the firm's sales, Robinson helped launch and scale WeWork's enterprise business, a major component of its growth over the years. Later, when COVID-19 and the work-from-home trend upended the commercial real estate market, he also led the charge to help its businesses bounce back in New York.\n\nRobinson told Business Insider that being as transparent as possible with clients during difficult times has been key.\n\n\"We saw all the extremes. We saw people come back immediately. We saw people fully go remote,\" he said of the pandemic. \"We were able to, number one, hopefully provide solutions, but also provide some perspective.\"\n\nRobinson, who is now WeWork's regional president of North America, said the firm's recent restructuring to slash its $4 billion debt has been challenging.\n\n\"Everything, to a degree, is challenging about that process. I really made a huge effort to be extremely transparent with our landlords and our members throughout the whole process.\"\n\nRobinson said he expects the commercial real estate market to pick up steam next year as the RTO push continues, and he's focused on continuing the company's efforts to refresh its properties and widen its offerings to customers.\n\n\"We've talked about return to office for five years at this point,\" he said. \"I feel very confident in saying that this phase over the past year has been by far the strongest.\"\n\nLaunching a small business at 27 during the pandemic would have been a risk for anyone, but Amy Rossetti was confident that the strong relationships she built wouldn't fail her. Now, after celebrating her company's fifth anniversary, she's planning for many more years of success.\n\nRossetti's company, R[AR]E Public Relations, is a boutique agency with a five-person staff that handles the public relations needs of 22 real estate clients. Since launching in Beverly Hills in 2020, the company has opened a New York office, and Rossetti plans to establish a bigger presence in South Florida and potentially international markets in 2026.\n\nThough Rossetti's clientele is mainly focused around the luxury real estate market, R[AR]E has opened its services to all who need them — from architects to investors to startups.\n\n\"I'm really adamant that I think R[AR]E can be and will be, if it's not too bold to say, the No. 1 real estate PR firm in the country within the next five years,\" she said. \"That's what I'm gunning for.\"\n\nErik Rutter cofounded the real estate development firm Oak Row Equities with every intention of dividing his efforts between Miami and his hometown of New York City. Almost eight years after the 2018 launch, though, he and his firm remain laser-focused on South Florida.\n\nThat choice has proven to be a winning strategy. With Rutter and his cofounder, David Weitz, at the helm, the company has amassed a $3.9 billion portfolio of office, retail, and multifamily space, luring big-name tenants such as Spotify and Amazon along the way.\n\nRutter, 33, started the company with the firm belief that South Florida's quality of life would eventually draw a wave of top employers, who in turn would demand top-tier office space and ample housing for their workers. The COVID-19 pandemic \"certainly accelerated our thesis,\" Rutter said, but he still sees plenty of runway.\n\n\"We're continuing to see great firms take large swaths of space in the Miami market,\" Rutter said. \"And that's not really slowing down.\"\n\nErica Sachse was on a founding spree early in her career.\n\nAfter spending five years in Australia, Sachse noticed that the US real estate market was lagging in its adoption of technology. She set out to fix that.\n\n\"Australia is very far ahead in the utilization of technology and 21st-century marketing techniques for real estate,\" she said. \"I learned how to harness the data being created in the digital space for high-quality lead generation, ultra-targeted campaigns, lead nurture, really strong automation, and data profiling for prospective buyers and renters.\"\n\nShe founded the property marketing company Snaplistings at the end of 2019, then started her own marketing and sales brokerage, Powered by DMT, in 2021.\n\nBeing ahead of the curve has its benefits.\n\n\"Our clients are just so happy to finally be able to make data-driven decisions,\" Sachse said. \"That's really what our focus is and what my passion is.\"\n\nRaised in Paraguay, Sofia Zavala developed an early passion for art and design, as well as a clear sense of their socioecological impact on daily life. This perspective now guides her architectural work.\n\nZavala specializes in large-scale urban projects, and her portfolio encompasses a range of interior corporate work in New York, as well as mixed-use, corporate, and commercial developments across San Francisco and Texas.\n\n\"Large-scale projects have a big impact on the cities they're in,\" Zavala told Business Insider. \"I'm involved in a couple of projects in San Francisco and in Texas, and they're all meant to make a meaningful difference in communities and create beautiful spaces for people to engage.\"\n\nZavala is currently a senior associate at Connecticut-based Pickard Chilton. She's the architectural firm's youngest employee at that rank and the youngest woman on its senior leadership team.\n\n\"I'm very proud of that and grateful for the confidence that the firm has placed in me,\" Zavala said. \"Being in this role motivates me to keep raising the bar and to support younger designers as they grow into leadership roles and find their own voice.\"\n\nZavala has plenty to be proud of. In 2024, she was a project designer on 530 Howard, an 840-foot luxury residential tower in San Francisco — the city's largest residential building. In 2025, she will also serve as the design team leader for the recently announced Ritz-Carlton Houston, which is projected to be the downtown area's second-tallest building at more than 600 feet.\n\n\"The most rewarding part of my job is knowing that the projects we do at Pickard Chilton aren't just buildings — they're future landmarks that help shape the skyline,\" Zavala said. \"That's the really exciting part of what I do here.\"",

    "description": "Ukrainian special operators described to Business Insider how they came under Russian fire driving buggies near the front lines.",
    "fullText": "Ukraine's elite special operators rely on light buggies to swiftly move along the front lines, banking on their speed and maneuverability to execute high-stakes missions.\n\nThese run-and-gun vehicles don't come with much in the way of external protection, leaving them exposed and vulnerable to Russian drone strikes, but that's the tradeoff for flexibility in combat.\n\nTwo soldiers in Ukraine's 4th Ranger Regiment, a special operations unit modeled after its US Army counterparts, talked to Business Insider about how they found themselves under Russian drone fire near the front lines while riding in the buggies.\n\nBoth attacks, which were carried out in Ukraine's northeastern Sumy region in recent months, left soldiers injured, the two special operators said. They could only be identified by their call signs for security reasons.\n\nIn September, Khyzhak and two other operators were driving back to base from a mission when a Russian first-person-view (FPV) drone appeared behind their buggy and started chasing the vehicle.\n\nKhyzhak said that his driver skillfully maneuvered away from the Russian drone at the last second, which detonated a few feet away on the side of the road. The Ukrainians, having narrowly survived, jumped out of the buggy. One of the operators landed awkwardly and broke his leg.\n\nThe 4th @SOF_UKR Regiment Rangers skillfully maneuver away from an enemy FPV while returning from the frontline to the base. Video from the ranger's action camera of the 2nd Battalion, the Northern-Slobozhanskyi direction. Ukrainian SOF: Always Beyond! pic.twitter.com/i7tN5PQsSZ\n\nTwo months earlier, in July, Drago and several other operators were out in a buggy when they were attacked by a massive swarm of Russian FPV drones — so many, in fact, that he described how their tiny propellers made the whole sky sound \"noisy.\"\n\nDrago said his buggy was struck and shrapnel from the explosion injured his left hand and pelvis. Then, another Ukrainian buggy that went to help came under drone fire. Multiple operators from the 4th Ranger Regiment found themselves caught in the large attack.\n\nKhyzhak speculated that the Russian drone pilots may be intentionally targeting the Ukrainian buggies because these vehicles are known to carry elite troops, forces that tend to stir up trouble behind enemy lines.\n\nIn his case, the Russian drone didn't react to any other vehicles in the vicinity, he said. However, Drago said that when he was struck, the concentration of Russian drones was so high that pilots attacked anything they could, including ATVs and armored personnel carriers.\n\nAlthough several buggies were caught in the attack, Drago said that it's hard to say whether they were priority targets.\n\nIt's unclear to what extent the targeting of buggies may reflect a broader trend. The Russian defense ministry and its embassy in the US did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nThe buggy is a four-wheel car with virtually no external protection. It is one of the lightweight vehicles used in the conflict for infantry assaults, rapid movement, and other specialized missions, alongside quad bikes, motorcycles, and even electric scooters.\n\nThese buggies can also run logistics missions — hauling ammunition to the front or evacuating wounded troops. Ukraine's defense industry has signaled it intends to mass-produce them.\n\nThe US Army is notably interested in something very similar, the Infantry Squad Vehicle, a lightweight buggy-style combat asset that comes as the service and soldiers look to prioritize speed and flexibility over cumbersome heavy armor.\n\nUnlike armored vehicles, which have hardened exteriors, the buggies used in Ukraine look more like militarized golf carts. However, their main advantages are speed, maneuverability, and off-road capabilities that allow access to areas other vehicles can't reach and a shot at dodging drones, though these can be tough to evade.\n\nThese characteristics are particularly useful for special operators, who try to keep a low profile during their missions.\n\nKhyzhak, who joined Ukraine's special operators forces nearly two years ago and commands a small unit, said that he faced the threat of Russian drones earlier in the war while riding in US-made High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles (Humvees) or Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicles.\n\nThe September near-miss, though, was the first time he experienced a Russian drone attack while riding in a buggy.\n\nUkrainian officials have said that attack drones are destroying most battlefield targets now, making large mechanized assaults with armored vehicles far harder for both sides.\n\nThe increasing threat of drones has pushed Ukraine and Russia to acquire and field smaller, lighter, and faster vehicles as alternatives to more traditional — often slower, less flexible, and more easily spotted — systems, such as tanks and heavy armor.\n\nAt least 14,000 tanks and armored vehicles have been destroyed in this conflict, according to the open-source intelligence platform Oryx, which tracks equipment losses on both sides. Many systems have been taken out by drones.\n\nThe expanded use of light vehicles for combat and logistics missions underscores how Ukraine and Russia are adapting to the threat of drones, which dominate the battlefield all along the front line.",

    "description": "Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi says robotaxis are a \"trillion-dollar-plus\" business and he expects Asia to drive the wave of autonomous expansion.",
    "fullText": "Uber is preparing for a robotaxi surge, and its CEO says one market will drive it.\n\nDara Khosrowshahi said in an interview with Bloomberg Television published Friday that robotaxis are a \"trillion-dollar-plus\" opportunity and Asia is a huge growth market for the ride-hailing giant.\n\n\"I expect to be in 10-plus markets by next year. And we want those markets to be in the Asia-Pacific region as well,\" Khosrowshahi said. Uber has self-driving vehicles in the US and the Middle East.\n\nAnalysts have long touted autonomous mobility as one of the biggest bets in the transportation industry. In 2023, McKinsey estimated that if robotaxis and roboshuttles scale, the shared-mobility market could reach $1 trillion by 2030.\n\nKhosrowshahi said Japan has \"great potential\" for its robotaxi push, despite being behind in regulation.\n\n\"With an aging population, there's a real need for transportation, not just in the large cities but in the rural areas,\" he added. He also pointed to Hong Kong and Australia as potential key markets for its robotaxi services.\n\nKhosrowshahi said Uber now works with more than 20 autonomous-vehicle partners — including China's Baidu, WeRide, and Pony.ai, as well as Waymo in the US.\n\n\"We will have access to autonomous technologies in the large cities and markets that really count,\" he added.\n\nWith a market that large, Khosrowshahi said autonomous driving is unlikely to be a \"winner-take-all\" industry.\n\n\"It's an exciting technology, but there are many players getting to the finish line,\" he said.\n\n\"We just have to make sure that the players that we work with are safe and that again, we're working with the regulators in a constructive manner,\" he added.\n\nUber has been leaning hard into autonomous driving. During its third-quarter earnings call in November, Khosrowshahi said the company is already seeing signs that robotaxis can boost demand.\n\n\"The biggest scale operations that we've got are with Waymo in Austin and Atlanta,\" Khosrowshahi said. \"And what we are seeing is that those markets are growing faster than other US markets,\" he added.\n\nOther industry leaders have also been hyping the sector.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk has repeatedly said that robotaxis will power the company's growth. In May, Musk said in an interview with CNBC that Tesla would hit one million self-driving cars by the end of next year, a claim he also made in 2019 that did not materialize.\n\nThe path to profitability remains murky. HSBC analysts warned in July that the robotaxi market has been \"widely overestimated,\" and said it could be years before fleets make real money.\n\nEven the most advanced players are burning cash. Alphabet's \"Other Bets\" division — which includes Waymo, as well as other subsidiaries — lost $1.42 billion in the third quarter.\n\nThe cost of an autonomous driving vehicle is steep. Analysts estimate that each Waymo vehicle costs about $150,000 to produce. The high costs have squeezed some companies out of the robotaxi market, including Ford and General Motors.",

    "fullText": "Wolves got their transfer business \"wrong\" in the summer, says technical director Matt Jackson - while under-fire executive chairman Jeff Shi insists he can empathise with protesting fans.\n\nRob Edwards' side are bottom of the Premier League with just two points and have not won in the top flight since April, while their current eight-game losing run has equalled a club record set in 1981-82.\n\nIt comes after a summer in which Matheus Cunha and Rayan Ait-Nouri were sold to Manchester United and Manchester City for a combined £92.5m, and captain Nelson Semedo left on a free transfer.\n\nDuring that time, Wolves signed six players - Fer Lopez, Jhon Arias, Tolu Arokodare, David Moller Wolfe, Jackson Tchatchoua and Ladislav Krejci - without Premier League experience.\n\n\"The players who were brought in were brought in for the right reasons, but when you have a return of two points at this stage you have to say it's wrong because whatever starting XI we have put out has not been good enough,\" said Jackson, who also said Wolves will not give up on Premier League survival.\n\n\"We have a great belief in those players developing. The ability and will to improve has been excellent - but you want immediate returns.\n\n\"For the way we can go into the market for our players, it's tough.

    "title": "Interceptor drones are taking over in Ukraine, but soldiers are still using machine guns to battle Russian threats",
    "description": "The drones are still in limited supply and are not always the ideal interception method, Ukrainian soldiers and an official told Business Insider.",
    "fullText": "Ukrainian forces are still using decades-old machine guns and small arms to defend against Russian air attacks, even as cheap interceptor drones surge in popularity.\n\nInterceptor drones, which are armed with small warheads and fly directly into their targets or explode nearby to destroy them midair, have become a crucial tool for Ukraine as it struggles to defend against worsening Russian bombardments.\n\nHowever, Ukraine still doesn't have enough of these drones, and they aren't always the best tool for every intercept, making guns a practical fallback, Ukrainian soldiers and an official familiar with the security situation told Business Insider.\n\nOleksiy, the deputy commander of a Ukrainian Territorial Defense Forces mobile air defense unit who could only be identified by his first name for security reasons, said his troops are training to use new interceptor drones to strengthen their arsenal.\n\nOleksiy's unit, tasked with protecting Irpin, a city on the outskirts of Ukraine's capital Kyiv, has historically used the .50 caliber M2 Browning machine gun mounted on the bed of a pickup truck to battle the Russian one-way attack drones that are regularly launched at Ukraine.\n\nEarlier this year, though, Russia started modifying its drones to fly faster and at higher altitudes, beyond the range of the Browning, a popular US-made heavy weapon designed around the end of World War I.\n\nOleksiy said his unit is still using the Browning, but it hasn't scored any hits recently because the Russian drones are beyond its capabilities. He said that other Ukrainian air defenders also rely on the machine gun, which has decades of combat experience.\n\nOleksiy argued that guns will likely continue to have a role in air defense. Ultimately, soldiers will decide which weapon best suits their needs in the moment.\n\n\"Defense forces always use all available means of deterrence, and a machine gun is currently one of the cheapest means if there are enemy air targets in its range,\" he said.\n\nA special operator in Ukraine's 4th Ranger Regiment, who previously worked with the Browning in an air defense sub-unit, said the gun is a reliable weapon troops can master in just a few days.\n\nRussian drones don't always maintain a consistent altitude in flight; sometimes they fly closer to the ground, where they become vulnerable to the Browning, said Drago, who could only be identified by his call sign for security reasons.\n\nOfficials, however, would like to see a shift toward the newer capabilities. Yehor Cherniev, the deputy chairman of the Ukrainian parliamentary committee on national security, defense, and intelligence, told Business Insider that air defenders still largely use \"outdated weapons,\" including guns, to battle Russian drones.\n\nCherniev said Ukraine is replacing these weapons with interceptor drones at a rapid pace, describing them as \"far more effective.\"\n\nHe said that \"due to a lack of funding and limited assistance from our partners, we have not yet been able to implement the use of interceptor drones everywhere and on the necessary scale.\" Limits on these capabilities leave crews dependent on older options that are useful but not always well-suited for the threat.\n\nInterceptor drones emerged earlier this year as a top defense priority for Ukraine because these systems are inexpensive and can be manufactured in large quantities. They are among the latest battlefield innovations and crucial technology as Kyiv faces growing Russian investment in its long-range drone operations and ever-expanding nightly attacks.\n\nSome Ukrainian interceptor drones are worth as little as $2,500; by comparison, Russia's one-way attack drones are estimated to cost $35,000 on the low end. Officials stress that it's crucial to be on the right end of the cost curve.\n\nUkraine's defense industry is now producing hundreds of interceptor drones daily, and the military frequently shares footage showing them downing Russian attack and reconnaissance drones.\n\nWestern military officials and Ukrainian organizations have said that interceptor drones are responsible for taking down thousands of Russian drones in combat.\n\nMeanwhile, NATO is taking note of the success of interceptor drones in Ukraine. Some allies have purchased and are deploying their own systems, recognizing the value as a low-cost air defense solution that doesn't necessarily require extensive training.\n\nOleksiy's unit began training on the new interceptor drones earlier in the fall, and they expect to wrap up soon. While he acknowledged that there is a bit of a learning curve, he said that it \"doesn't scare us.\"",

New England fishermen, especially those from Maine, used to catch millions of pounds of small pink shrimp in the winter, but the business has been under a fishing moratorium since 2014.

    "fullText": "PORTLAND, Maine (AP) — Regulators voted Thursday to extend a shutdown preventing New England fishermen from catching shrimp, a historic industry that has recently fallen victim to warming oceans.\n\nNew England fishermen, especially those from Maine, used to catch millions of pounds of small pink shrimp in the winter, but the business has been under a fishing moratorium since 2014. Rising temperatures have created an inhospitable environment for the shrimp, and their population is too low to fish sustainably, scientists have said.\n\nAn arm of the regulatory Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission voted Thursday to shut down the fishery for at least another three years. Abundance of the shrimp remained “poor” this year despite slightly improved environmental conditions, the Atlantic States said in documents.\n\nThe decision came after shrimp harvesters were allowed to catch a small number of shrimp as part of an industry-funded sampling and data collection program. The fishermen, who battled some rough weather, caught only 70 shrimp totaling less than 3 pounds.\n\nHowever, \"even with the bad weather, exceptionally low catch levels observed throughout the program reinforce concerns about the viability of the northern shrimp stock in the Gulf of Maine,” the documents state.\n\nNew England shrimp were a winter delicacy when the fishery was active, and fishermen sometimes caught more than 10 million pounds (4,536 kilograms) of them in a year. The small pink shrimp were a small part of the country's large wild caught shrimp industry, which catches some of the most valuable seafood in the world.\n\nMaine's catch of shrimp cratered in 2013, when fishermen caught less than 600,000 pounds (272,155 kilograms) of the crustaceans after hauling more than eight times that the previous year. Fishing groups have sometimes lobbied for the shrimping industry to be reopened on a smaller scale basis, but most former Maine shrimpers have moved on to other species.",

    "title": "The key to a happy RTO? Romanticizing your commute.",
    "description": "Amid the recent return-to-office push in corporate America, young workers are romanticizing their commutes in a new TikTok trend.",
    "fullText": "When Danielle Pogue hits the pavement each morning for the cross-borough trek to her office in Brooklyn, she relies on two essentials to propel her forward: a perfectly curated Spotify playlist and the mental power to romanticize each step.\n\n\"I have perfected the New York City strut,\" Pogue told me.\n\nPogue, 27, graduated from college in 2020 and entered the labor force at the height of the pandemic, when working remotely was more necessary than trendy. After moving to New York the following year, she jumped at the chance to work in the office at both postgrad jobs she's held in digital marketing. Part of the reason was the commute.\n\n\"It definitely is something that I look forward to now,\" Pogue said of her 25-minute journey to the office. \"I think of the alternative, which would be living really close to my office, maybe having it just be around the corner — and for some reason, that doesn't feel as appealing to me anymore. A lot of that has to do with the routine that I've made for myself.\"\n\nThat routine is a kind of portable daydream: As she navigates her way through foot traffic and train platforms, Pogue might imagine herself as a high-powered executive or a trendy young professional in a movie montage, having her main character moment.\n\nIn October, Pogue posted a video of her daily strut on TikTok set to KT Tunstall's \"Suddenly I See,\" the song that memorably plays during the opening credits of 2006 movie \"The Devil Wears Prada.\" Pogue captioned the post, \"hot tip: romanticize your commute to work by listening to this song & acting like you're in a '90s romcom.\" It's amassed over 70,000 views and counting.\n\nfirst video I made abt this went viral but I feel some people need a reminder 🫂 comment ‘Spotify’ if you want the link to my full 90’s romcom playlist\n\n\"Clearly, it's something that people resonate with, and also want to replicate in their own morning routine,\" Pogue said of why she thinks her post gained traction. After all, romanticizing an existing routine is easy, accessible, and free of charge — perfect for inspiring the online masses.\n\nPogue isn't the only woman with a go-getter protagonist like Anne Hathaway's Andy Sachs on her digital mood board. Videos similar to Pogue's are littered across my For You Page on TikTok, with captions like \"being employed means getting to act mysterious and romanticize my morning commute,\" or \"romanticizing the commute I dreamed of when I was younger.\" They're often paired with nostalgic tunes or cinematic pop songs, including \"What a Wonderful World\" by Louis Armstrong, \"Young and Beautiful\" by Lana Del Rey, and, of course, \"Everything Is Romantic\" by Charli XCX.\n\nWhile the call to \"romanticize your life\" on TikTok can sometimes lean aspirational, as much of the internet does, devotees reject the implication that romanticizing your life requires buying new things. Rather, the goal is to appreciate what's already in reach.\n\nBrianna Paruolo, a licensed mental health therapist and founder of On Par Therapy, said that while showing off for strangers online can be a \"slippery slope\" if it leads to a craving for more validation, romanticizing can be a positive way to reframe mundanity.\n\n\"When we romanticize, we take notice in the small moments of beauty,\" Paruolo said. \"When you film your morning coffee routine or walk to the subway, you are using your digital lens to train your mental lens to scan for positive experiences rather than functioning on autopilot.\"\n\nFor Pogue, that holds true. \"It kind of just sets my day up for success,\" she said of why she romanticizes her commute, online and otherwise. \"If you're dreading your morning commute, you're dreading getting to the office, and then everything that happens after that is more likely to feel a little bit negative.\"\n\nAlthough TikTok has been awash in videos about romanticizing everyday life since the early pandemic, videos about romanticizing your commute are part of a newer subgenre whose rise coincides with the recent return-to-office push in corporate America.\n\nData from Placer.ai, a leading foot-traffic analytics firm, found that office visits nationwide were up about 10% in 2024 compared with 2023. Other stats paint an even starker picture: A McKinsey survey of over 8,000 people across 15 industries found the number of employees working mostly in person, as opposed to mostly remote or hybrid, doubled in 2024 compared to the previous year.\n\nEarly indicators suggest these figures continued to grow in 2025. As Business Insider previously reported, July set a post-pandemic record high for office attendance, up 10.7% from July 2024. In September, the so-called \"hybrid creep\" continued to ramp up, with more and more companies enacting strict RTO policies, including Intel, NBCUniversal, and Starbucks. Earlier this month, Instagram's chief, Adam Mosseri, announced that most US staff would be expected to return to the office five days a week starting in February.\n\nAndrea Yamhure Sepúlveda, 25, started her corporate consulting job in January 2023. About two years later, her company began asking employees to spend 60% of their workweek in the office; lately, managers have been sending quarterly reports to recap their employees' in-person stats.\n\nNew York-based Sepúlveda, who's also a content creator in her spare time, has taken this sea change in stride. She enjoys filming the morning minutiae — her first cup of tea, the sunrise glow over the Manhattan skyline — and sharing the clips on TikTok like a public gratitude journal.\n\n\"It's like, you're going to have to do this anyway, so you might as well find the positive,\" she said. \"If I dread the fact that I have to wake up at 5 a.m. and travel, then it's gonna suck. And then I'm going to have to do it next Monday, and the next Monday.\"\n\nMaria Lysy, a 25-year-old marketing professional in the Washington, DC, metro area, agreed that casting her commute in a positive light helps boost her morale for the workday ahead.\n\nLysy said her commuting routine lately has involved listening to pop singer Audrey Hobert, especially her songs \"Phoebe\" and \"Sex and the City,\" and reminding herself that her younger self would be proud of where she is today. She described this process as \"finding the extraordinary in the ordinary.\"\n\n\"It sounds so simple, but I've always dreamed of going to my 'big girl job,'\" Lysy said. \"I feel like it's so easy to take a negative approach on a lot of things, but it's just as easy just romanticize the littlest things you do. It totally changes your perspective.\"",

    "fullText": "Another long-standing Mexican restaurant chain has closed nearly all of its locations, bringing to a halt years of family dinners, weekly happy hours, and a loyal customer base. Due to an unexpected event, a more severe crisis has now affected the business: the sudden loss of many employees.\n\nMexican restaurants across the U.S. have been struggling with rising labor and food costs fueled by inflation, higher interest rates on their debt obligations, and more cautious consumer spending. This beloved Arizona chain was no exception.\n\nFounded in 2008 by two brothers as a single restaurant in Tucson, the Mexican restaurant chain is known for its authentic Sonoran- and Tampico-style Mexican cuisine, with a focus on seafood dishes. It has also become a popular hangout spot due to its wide range of Michelada drinks and fun cocktails.\n\nHowever, after 17 years of building a strong community across Arizona and Mexico, its future is now uncertain, not only because of the economic challenges facing the broader industry, but also due to far more serious legal issues.\n\nTaco Giro has confirmed that seven of its restaurants will remain closed until further notice. The sudden closures follow multiple ICE raids across various locations, in which 46 kitchen workers, making up 10% of its staff, were arrested on December 5, as reported by KGUN9.\n\nAfter the raids occurred, Taco Giro closed all nine of its Arizona restaurants while keeping its Mexico location open, all of which are still listed on its website. The chain also took to its social media platforms, posting updates in both English and Spanish to notify customers of the shutdowns.\n\n\"Our restaurant will be temporarily closed while we take a short pause to make a few necessary adjustments so we can continue offering the warm service and unique flavors you love,\" wrote Taco Giro in a social media post. \"We'll be ready to welcome you back very soon with the same love, passion, and flavors that always make you feel at home.\"\n\nSince then, Taco Giro has slowly reopened its locations, with three currently operating. The chain has also revealed that it may close two additional underperforming restaurants, which were already part of its plans before the raids.\n\nBelow are all the current statuses of Taco Giro location, according to Google Maps as of December 10.\n\n8320 N. Thornydale Rd., Tucson: Permanently closed\n\n2097 E. Fry Blvd, Sierra Vista: Open\n\n1402 S. Craycroft Rd., Tucson: Listed as open but not confirmed\n\n13160 E. Colossal Cave Rd. #100, Vail: Permanently closed\n\n77 E. Paseo De Golf, Green Valley: Temporarily closed\n\n139 W. Cottonwood Ln., Casa Grande: Open\n\n610 N. Grande Ave., Tucson: Temporarily closed\n\n2750 W. Valencia Rd., Tucson: Open\n\n1520 Apache Trail, Apache Junction: Temporarily closed\n\nBlvd. El Greco 70, Plaza Cumbres, 84066 Heroica Nogales, Sonora, Mexico: Open",

    "title": "Teens discovered my 57-year-old cheese shop on TikTok — and transformed my business",
    "description": "Dominick DiBartolomeo, who owns the Cheese Store of Beverly Hills, told Business Insider that TikTok virality drew in waves of younger customers.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Dominick DiBartolomeo, owner of the Cheese Store of Beverly Hills. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhen I bought the Cheese Store of Beverly Hills, my goal was to honor its legacy while making it feel fresh and relevant.\n\nThe shop has been around since 1967 and already had decades of goodwill, but I wanted to create something familiar and new, so we added sandwiches, salads, cheese boards, and wines by the glass.\n\nI didn't expect the flood of teenagers.\n\nMy daughter is 16, and I like to say her generation arrived armed with Instagram. They started filming everything — and some of those videos went viral.\n\nSuddenly, we had crowds of teens lining up for a place that had historically catered to adults, chefs, and longtime Beverly Hills locals. It completely changed the energy of the shop.\n\nPeople know our products are premium, but they don't see how volatile the economics have become.\n\nWe import directly from Europe, mainly Italy. At the beginning of the year, tariffs were 10%, and we absorbed as much of that as we could. However, the Euro then jumped from around $1.04 to about $1.17 or $1.18 — a 13% swing. As a result, the same products suddenly cost 23% more before they even reach our shores.\n\nThen there are the Chinese tariffs, which people rarely think about, but almost all takeout packaging comes from China. Between packaging tariffs and ingredient tariffs, some costs have risen 50%, 60%, and even 70%. When that happens across your entire supply chain, the math stops making sense.\n\nWe tried everything before raising prices, from asking suppliers to share some of the tariff load to switching products, and eventually accepting lower margins. However, at a certain point, you can't absorb the costs.\n\nOur sales are up this year, but our margins are down because our costs are so much higher. That's the reality for a lot of small specialty food businesses right now.\n\nOur customers are still buying, but the middle is getting squeezed. The under-$25 customer remains rock solid, and diners spending $100 or more are also doing fine. It's the middle that's struggling, and that's where a lot of restaurants and gifting budgets live.\n\nWhen we moved into our new location a couple of years back, I knew I had to take care of the older clientele who built this brand — but I also believed that if the shop didn't evolve, it would die.\n\nAdding sandwiches and salads wasn't just about giving people something to eat while they browsed. It was a way to create a full experience. While customers wait for their sandwiches, they can try different cheeses in line. The whole place feels alive.\n\nThen the influencers started showing up.\n\nI didn't know who most of them were — I had to ask my daughter who people were after they left — but our Instagram following grew from 6,000 to around 280,000 in about a year and a half.\n\nPeople now walk in and say, \"I came here because you showed up on my feed.\" We even had a couple from Australia tell us this was their first stop off the plane for their honeymoon because we popped up on their TikTok feed.\n\nThe most exciting part is that the virality around the sandwiches has turned into virality around the cheese, too. Because of the way our line bends through the store, people waiting for sandwiches are sampling cheeses the whole time — and they film that. Now, young customers come in for a buzzy sandwich, discover a type of cheese they've never tried, and suddenly they're coming back for parties, holidays, or simply because they want something special.\n\nWe even launched a merch line because we noticed how many younger customers wanted something to take home. Seeing a longtime customer who's been coming in for 40 or 50 years standing next to a teenager in a Cheese Store hoodie is one of the coolest things I've ever experienced. It feels like we've made cheese buying cool again.\n\nWhat's happened is that this new generation has completely renewed the life cycle of the business. At the same time, our longtime loyal customers remain the backbone of who we are. Now the two groups stand shoulder to shoulder in the shop. It's a full-circle moment — we've managed to grow without losing our core.\n\nI met my wife at the Cheese Store, where I was working while I couldn't afford a phone and was taking the bus to work. She supported me through everything — from raising money to buying the business and surviving the pandemic. Now we have 40 to 50 employees. All of their families rely on us.\n\nThat responsibility changes you. So does the joy of seeing the store full, watching our products show up in incredible restaurants, and witnessing teens discover a 57-year-old Beverly Hills cheese shop on social media.",

    "fullText": "Ukrainian forces used naval drones packed with explosives to attack an oil tanker identified as part of Russia's \"shadow fleet\" in the Black Sea on Wednesday, a security source told Business Insider.\n\nThe naval drone strike on the tanker, Dashan, marks the third such attack in less than two weeks as Ukraine ramps up its long-range strike campaign against Russia's energy sector, increasingly gunning for ships at sea in addition to land-based oil facilities.\n\nSea Baby naval drones hit the tanker and caused \"critical damage\" to the vessel, with early indications indicating that the strike completely disabled the vessel, the source in the Security Service of Ukraine, the country's main internal security agency, revealed on Wednesday.\n\nThe SBU source, only authorized to speak anonymously to discuss sensitive military developments, said the Dashan was flying the Comoros flag and moving through Ukraine's exclusive economic zone in the direction of Novorossiysk, a Russian port city and major oil terminal.\n\nPublicly available ship-tracking data last showed the Dashan in the middle of the Black Sea.\n\nThe tanker was sailing at maximum speed with its transponder turned off, the security source said. They added that the attack was carried out in cooperation with the Ukrainian navy and shared footage captured by the Sea Baby drones showing multiple hits on the ship.\n\nSeveral Western countries and the European Union have sanctioned the $30 million tanker, which has been used for Russian oil exports and is known to sail with its transponder switched off, Ukraine's HUR military intelligence agency said.\n\nBusiness Insider could not independently verify the extent of the damage. Russia's defense ministry and its embassy in the US did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe attack on Wednesday appears to mark the third time in the last two weeks that Ukraine has disabled a tanker belonging to the \"shadow fleet.\" In late November, the SBU used naval drones to strike and damage two vessels before they loaded at Novorossiysk.\n\nThe \"shadow fleet\" is a collection of hundreds of vessels that Moscow uses to transport oil and circumvent sanctions on its energy exports, a major source of revenue. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has repeatedly urged Kyiv's international partners to do more to prevent the ships from operating.\n\n\"The SBU continues to take active measures to reduce the receipt of petrodollars to the budget of the Russian Federation,\" the security source said on Wednesday, according to a translation of their remarks shared with Business Insider.\n\nUkraine has been stepping up its attacks against the Russian energy sector, the revenue from which fuels its war efforts, in recent months. Kyiv has used long-range drones to strike oil refineries and other facilities and infrastructure across the country.\n\nThe three tanker attacks appear to reflect a new shift for Ukraine — one that now increasingly attacks ships at sea rather than just land targets.",

    "fullText": "Meta is planning to raise prices for its virtual reality devices, executives said in an internal memo seen by Business Insider.\n\nMetaverse leaders Gabriel Aul and Ryan Cairns told employees that the company must \"make a shift\" in its business model to ensure long-term sustainability. This will include measures such as price increases, accounting for new costs like tariffs, and extending the replacement cycle of its in-market devices, per the memo.\n\n\"Our devices will be more premium in price going forward, but we'll have a healthier business to anchor on and free ourselves from feeling existential about any singular device's success,\" Aul and Cairns wrote in the memo, shared with staff on December 4.\n\nThey also called for delivering high-quality software experiences to customers that can match the \"excellence\" of its devices, adding that this may mean \"we ship new hardware at a slower cadence going forward.\"\n\nMeta did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nThe company's flagship virtual reality (VR) headset, the Meta Quest 3, retails for $499.99, while its entry-level model retails at $299.99.\n\nThe move comes as Meta pushed back the release of its new mixed reality glasses, codenamed \"Phoenix,\" from the second half of 2026 to the first half of 2027, as outlined in a product strategy note to staff that Business Insider previously reported.\n\nThe memo announcing the price increases from Aul and Cairns did not refer to its mixed reality glasses. The document outlined three major themes derived from a recent Reality Labs strategy meeting with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and CTO Andrew Bosworth. They included how Meta can build a sustainable VR business for the long term, how it can build \"world-class\" software experiences, and how it can accelerate its pace on mobile.\n\nThey also sought to reassure staffers that it remains focused on VR. Earlier this month, Bloomberg reported that Meta plans to make budget cuts of up to 30% to Reality Labs, the division responsible for Meta's hardware.\n\n\"We're committed to VR for the long-haul so we need to align our business model and roadmap to an approach that will make this possible,\" they wrote in the memo. \"We've been working hard to bend the curve and accelerate ahead of the category's natural growth rate, which means running multiple programs in parallel as well as carrying costs like tariffs and subsidies for content, GTM, and devices.\"\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "Here's the \"boring\" path to riches that doesn't involve starting a business, investing in real estate or inheriting the money.",
    "fullText": "You may be surprised to find out that about 18% of Americans are millionaires, translating to roughly 25 million individuals, according to a report by Wealth Management USA. And while there are plenty of ways to accumulate a seven-digit net worth, some avenues are more common than others.\n\nFind Out: 6 Money Moves Wealthy People Always Make Before New Year’s\n\nFor You: 6 Subtly Genius Moves All Wealthy People Make With Their Money\n\nMany millionaires start their own business or invest in real estate to earn their riches, while others imply inherit the money. But the number one way that Americans become millionaires is actually within reach of average workers, provided they start early and stick to their plan.\n\nHere’s the “boring” path to riches that doesn’t involve starting a business, investing in real estate or inheriting the money.\n\nWant the “easy” way to a million dollars? Continually investing regularly is the best way to build wealth.\n\nAccording to a report from Morningstar, investors who have $1 million or \n\nTrending Now: Here’s the Minimum Net Worth Considered To Be Upper Class in Your 70s\n\nThere are several reasons why consistent investing is the “easy” path to $1 million. First, regularly adding money to your investments regardless of the market environment ensures that you’ll get an average price. You’ll be buying more stock when prices are low and less when prices are high. You won’t be putting all your money in either at the absolute bottom or at the peak, but since the long-term trend of the market is up, getting that “average” price provides a significant return.\n\nSecond, by consistently investing in “boring” options like mutual funds, 401(k) funds or high-quality stocks, you won’t be taking on excess risk. With automated contributions coming out of your paycheck or bank account, you won’t get tempted to chase the latest investment fad, a mistake that costs many novice investors their entire bankroll. As preservation of capital is half the battle when it comes to building wealth, automatically contributing to relatively “boring” investments can help protect your bankroll over the long run.\n\nThe third reason why consistent investing works is a simple one. If you continually add money to your account, you’ll have more money in it. If you simply invest $30,000 and watch it grow, you may end up with $60,000, $120,000 or even $240,000 in your account, depending on how long you keep it invested. But if you regularly add $1,000 per month to your account for 40 years, you’ll have contributed $480,000. A simple double of your money over time would be nearly enough to reach that $1 million level.",

So far in 2025, numerous developers lost their jobs, Microsoft canceled games, and the industry further consolidated with EA announcing plans to sell itself to Saudi Arabia.\nSpeaking to The Game Business, Keighley said the introduction of the Game Changer award in 2024 was an initial attempt to address this.
