    "title": "This 24-year-old founded a sneaker wholesale company that made $40 million in sales revenue last year — here's how he did it",
    "description": "Oscar Rachmansky, 24, was selling sneakers as a side hustle when he spotted a business opportunity that would become a multimillion-dollar company.",
    "fullText": "Whenever an idea pops into Oscar Rachmansky's head, he whips out a notebook or whatever scrap of paper is closest and writes it down. It's a habit you might expect from a Gen Xer or elder millennial clinging to analog comfort. Rachmansky is neither.\n\nHe's 24, and the company he founded about five years ago generated $40 million in sales revenue in 2025 (confirmed from documents reviewed by Business Insider).\n\nGoing against the grain is kind of Rachmansky's thing.\n\nWhen he was 4, he opened a sunflower seed stand while the other kids sold lemonade. As a teenager, he dropped out of college to pursue a business opportunity that he's since developed into a multimillion-dollar company.\n\nRachmansky launched OS Group in 2019, before he'd turned 20. The company is a B2B wholesaler of branded footwear and streetwear that he bootstrapped from the ground up, he said.\n\nWhat started with sneaker sales out of his bedroom has turned into a team of 30 employees distributing about 25,000 items a month from a large New Jersey warehouse. Rachmansky says he always thought he'd run his own business someday. He just didn't expect it to involve so many sneakers.\n\nGrowing up, Rachmansky was a sports kid who imagined himself running a sports agency one day. \"I certainly wasn't at all interested in fashion, sneakers, or anything of the sort,\" he told Business Insider.\n\nStill, he began buying and selling sneakers in high school as a side hustle. As he learned the resale market, one thing stood out. \"No one was paying attention to the B2B side of this industry,\" he said. \"And that's what powers the entire market.\"\n\nHe launched his B2B company shortly after enrolling at McGill University. His first resale client quickly revealed how fragmented the supply chain was, with retailers jumping through hoops just to source inventory, he said. The inefficiency was obvious. So was the scale.\n\nThen COVID-19 hit. The resale market froze. Rachmansky said he wasn't making any money and briefly considered walking away. \"I was like, well, maybe it wasn't meant to be, maybe I should just keep studying and figure out what happens.\"\n\nCollege, however, never felt like the long-term plan. Within his first month at McGill, he said he opened his notebook and wrote a prediction: \"This is going to be my first and last year of college.\"\n\nRachmansky dropped out of McGill and reinvested the roughly $30,000 he'd earned from his sneaker side hustle into expanding OscarSoles — now OS Group. \"I knew that the industry was growing, and I just wanted to go all in,\" he said.\n\nAt first, the company operated with more hustle than infrastructure.\n\n\"The first warehouse that we had, we didn't even have offices,\" said Isaac Murov, one of OS Group's original employees, who joined the company in 2021. \"We actually made cubicles out of Nike Air Force boxes, so we could have a little bit of privacy,\" he added.\n\nMurov met Rachmansky through a mutual friend, and the two hit it off quickly. \"He was always a very bright individual, and I think I gravitated toward him for that exact reason,\" Murov said.\n\nEven as the resale market cooled after the pandemic, OS Group continued to grow. Rachmansky credits his team above all else. \"We've been really, really intentional with our hiring,\" he said, focusing on people with good attitudes who are coachable and fast.\n\nThat growth came with its own learning curve, though. For the first several years, Rachmansky said, he worked 15-hour days. \"I've always kind of associated output with input — more hours equals better output,\" he said. Eventually, however, he learned that working harder wasn't always the same as working smarter. An early focus on hiring people who added value and growth to the team helped him see that.\n\nThe company's hustle culture was also shaped early on by Rachmansky's willingness to do whatever the job required. \"He always led by example,\" Murov said. \"Whether that was packing boxes in the back, he was never really above that.\"\n\nToday, Rachmansky wants to take OS Group beyond footwear and past pure transaction volume. His goal is to turn the company into a long-term operating partner, offering services like financing, logistics, and software using the infrastructure OS Group has already built internally. \"We really see ourselves as growing into a real operating partner for this industry,\" he said, with the ambition of building \"the entire B2B ecosystem.\"\n\nRachmansky no longer works 15-hour days and says he has a better work-life balance. \"A fear that motivates me is not being able to do everything that I want to do with my life,\" Rachmansky said, adding that he hopes to travel",

    "description": "President Donald Trump said he'll impose a 25% tariff on any country doing business with Iran, effective immediately.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump said Monday that he'll impose a tariff of 25% on any country that does business with Iran.\n\n\"Effective immediately, any Country doing business with the Islamic Republic of Iran will pay a Tariff of 25% on any and all business being done with the United States of America,\" Trump said in a post on Truth Social.\n\nIt's unclear how the tariff will be implemented or which countries could be affected. The White House did not provide additional information when reached by Business Insider.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, China and the United Arab Emirates are Iran's major trading partners.\n\nThe Trump administration has been trying to reach a trade deal with China after both countries backed down from a tariff war in 2025. According to China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the trade volume between China and Iran reached $13.37 billion in 2024, with China exporting $8.93 billion worth of goods to Iran and importing around $4.44 billion from the country. More recent data from the Observatory of Economic Complexity shows that China exported $456 million and imported $208 million from Iran in October 2025.\n\nTrump's targeting of Iran comes as the country is experiencing mass protests against its government. Iran's crackdown on protesters has left hundreds dead and thousands arrested, the Human Rights Activists News Agency said.\n\nTrump has expressed support for the protesters and threatened the possibility of US involvement.\n\n\"Iran is looking at FREEDOM, perhaps like never before,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social on Saturday. \"The USA stands ready to help!!!\"\n\nTrump's announcement also comes as the Supreme Court is expected to rule this week on the legality of the tariffs his administration has imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, a 1970s-era law typically used by the President to impose sanctions.\n\nScott Bessent, Secretary of the Treasury, said in a petition to SCOTUS that the federal government could be on the hook to refund $1 trillion in tariffs to American businesses should the duties be ruled unconstitutional.\n\nTrump also wrote in a post on Truth Social on Monday morning that \"if the Supreme Court rules against the United States of America on this National Security bonanza, WE'RE SCREWED.\"",

    "title": "A value-conscious shift in customer behavior is rocking the restaurant world. Brands are grappling with these 8 questions.",
    "description": "The restaurant industry is grappling with big questions about consumer behavior, efficiency, and labor this year, analysts told Business Insider.",
    "fullText": "The restaurant industry is grappling with big questions this year.\n\nDiners these days are more value-conscious, more selective, and more willing to stay home; and costs, along with competition, continue to rise for operators.\n\nAs big chains and local independents try to protect sales or regain their footing, analysts who spoke to Business Insider said the year ahead will come down to whether restaurants can do more with less, without losing what made people want to dine out in the first place.\n\nThese are the biggest questions shaping the restaurant industry's next chapter.\n\n\"Consumers are looking for value, but they're also cutting back on frequency — restaurants across the spectrum have to improve quality and the dining experience while controlling costs to maintain all-important same-store sales metrics,\" Asit Sharma, analyst for The Motley Fool, said. \"That's a difficult challenge against a backdrop of food and wage inflation.\"\n\nOperators are trying to understand their customers' restaurant and dining behaviors better in order to determine what they value most, and adjust their strategy accordingly, Michael Della Penna, the chief strategy officer at the digital advertising research firm InMarket, said.\n\n\"Restaurants think their biggest competition is the restaurant down the street,\" Della Penna said. \"In reality, competition today is far broader and more fragmented. Consumers aren't just choosing between restaurants anymore — they're deciding whether to eat out at all.\"\n\nMany brands are using limited-time offers or collectible promotions to drive repeat visits, app downloads, and loyalty program sign-ups, in attempts to connect more deeply with their customers, Evert Gruyaert, the restaurants and food service leader at Deloitte US, told Business Insider.\n\nStarbucks' viral collectible Bearista cup and Chipotle's protein snack cup launch are prime examples.\n\nHowever, Gruyaert said, the question is bigger than a simple limited-time offer. Restaurant operators are trying to identify why their brand resonates with consumers, which means aligning with a broader mission.\n\n\"Something that remains always relevant is: how do we do the right thing around, for instance, sustainability? How do we source more of our ingredients locally?\" he said. \"Because that has a cost efficiency, but it also plays into some expectations from our consumers.\"\n\n\"Restaurants are very hesitant to increase menu prices much more than they feel is reasonable,\" Moutray said. \"However, they still have to make the math work, right?\"\n\nSo, whether restaurants are adopting more technology — be it AI or other automation — or seeking alternative solutions to reduce costs, Moutray said efficiency is an \"ongoing battle\" for the industry.\n\nAI has become a buzzword in the restaurant space, but it remains an integral part of the conversation, Moutray said.\n\n\"You're seeing a lot of new technologies that are helping to speed up service, and make life a little bit more efficient, and hopefully improve the bottom line well,\" Moutray said.\n\nVoice AI integration is being continuously implemented at drive-thrus, and back-end systems are being overhauled for inventory and staffing purposes. New consumer-facing tech stacks are being rolled out, but it's not yet clear what the gold standards across the industry will be.\n\n\"Five years from today, whether it's a Michelin-starred restaurant with a single location, or a burgeoning brand capitalizing on the latest food trend, the average restaurant will be much more analytics-driven versus today,\" Sharma said.\n\n\"Labor, labor, labor,\" is top of mind for restaurants because of the industry's high turnover, Gruyaert said.\n\nExpectations from talent are also changing, Gruyaert said. The minimum wage continues to increase, and workers are seeking more flexibility in their jobs, which creates more competition among restaurants.\n\n\"So, the question is: how do you keep funneling that pipeline of talent and keep people close to you as a brand?\" Gruyaert said.\n\nMoutray said the industry will likely continue to see more consolidation this year as companies look to cut costs.\n\nSharma said smaller steakhouse chains with high fixed costs and operational inefficiencies are most at risk for closures and consolidations due to relentless beef inflation, coupled with their lack of purchasing power with suppliers, which he said \"creates a profit real headwind, and these models will get sorely tested in 2026.\"\n\nIt's not all doom and gloom. Some brands, such as Jollibee, are looking to go public — and more may be on the horizon.\n\n\"You still have a lot of focus on closures, but the reality is that we still have a lot of folks who are opening, as well,\" Moutray said.\n\nWith high labor, food, and packaging costs, many restaurant brands are closely monitoring their bottom lines while investing in upgrades.\n\n\"Slimmer profit margins are translating into lower free cash flow, but whether it's upgraded point of sales systems with rich data analytics for independent restaurants, or kitchen automation for chains, it's clear that technology investments will be critical for improving restaurant-level and overhead margins in the coming years,\" Sharma said.\n\nSharma said fast casual chains that can monitor inventory levels at restaurants in real time, and react quickly and efficiently through centralized ingredient kitchens, like Cava, have \"a real edge in this cost environment.\"\n\nSimilarly, quick-service restaurants with consistent, simple menus like Chick-fil-A, along with comfort food concepts that have low overhead and tech stacks purpose-built to accommodate digital orders, like Wingstop, are likely to see financial gains this year, Sharma said.\n\nUltimately, the questions facing the industry boil down to one key issue: growth.\n\nEach of the analysts who spoke to Business Insider said that's the core issue facing restaurants this year, as consumer tastes change, food and labor prices increase, and technology continues to advance.\n\n\"The No. 1 thing it's all about is how do you drive growth in this environment?\" Gruyaert said. \"That's the big question.\"",

The highly positive perspectives of these leaders on AI may suggest that the party can go on—high valuations of AI vendors, rising stock prices, a boom in data center construction, and initiatives to transform organizations around AI’s capabilities.

    "fullText": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said late Sunday that the central bank had received grand jury subpoenas from the Department of Justice. He described the move as a part of a broader effort to pressure the central bank on monetary policy.\n\nProminent economists and business leaders are reacting as the news hit markets at the start of the trading week. They weighed in on how the DOJ move affects the Fed's independence, a question also raised by Sen. Thom Tillis. On Sunday, the Republican said he would oppose nominees for the Fed.\n\n\"If there were any remaining doubt about whether advisers within the Trump Administration are actively pushing to end the independence of the Federal Reserve, there should now be none,\" Tillis said in a statement.\n\nHere's what leaders in economics and business are saying:\n\nProminent economist Mohamed El-Erian called for Powell's resignation months ago to protect the Fed's independence amid the feud with Trump.\n\nOn Sunday, El-Erian wrote on X that the inquiry into Powell is damaging for the US central bank.\n\n\"For those of us who value the operational autonomy of central banks, the risk is that this situation could expose deeper issues — further undermining the credibility of a Fed whose public standing is already fragile,\" wrote El-Erian, who is a former co-chief investment officer at Pimco.\n\nLinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman raised concerns about the Fed's independence.\n\n\"Question to all those who said Trump would be better for the economy: is attacking the Fed's independence what you had in mind?\" wrote the prominent Democratic donor on X.\n\nPeter Schiff, the chief economist at Euro Pacific Asset Management, attributed the gold price surge to fresh record highs on Sunday evening to the investigation into Powell.\n\n\"I am not a fan of Powell, but I agree with him on Trump's motivation,\" Schiff, whose firm managed $1.4 billion last year, wrote on X.\n\nIn April, Schiff said Trump's next Fed Chair pick would be a \"loyal soldier.\"\n\nMichael A. Gayed, a renowned investment manager, said direct action against a sitting Fed Chair is \"without modern precedent,\" in an edition of his Lead-Lag substack report published on Sunday evening.\n\nThe inquiry into Powell raises questions about whether the long-standing boundaries between fiscal power, prosecutorial authority, and monetary independence are beginning to blur, Gayed said. The concern was less about any single case and more about the future precedent it may establish.\n\n\"Should investors conclude that future Fed officials could face legal consequences for policy decisions that conflict with political priorities, the incentive structure governing monetary policy could change,\" said Gayed.\n\nThat shift could increase inflation risk premiums and weaken confidence in long-duration financial assets tied to stable policy expectations, he added.",

    "description": "Michael Burry, the investor from \"The Big Short,\" said return on invested capital is the \"measure to beat all measures\" when looking at AI companies.",
    "fullText": "Michael Burry, the investor made famous by \"The Big Short,\" says the era of Big Tech turning relatively small investments into huge profits is ending.\n\nIn a recent Substack exchange with tech podcaster Dwarkesh Patel, Burry said the most important metric AI industry investors should be watching isn't revenue growth, hiring, or even market size, but return on invested capital, or ROIC.\n\nROIC is a measure of how efficiently a company turns the money it puts into its business into profit.\n\n\"The measure to beat all measures is return on invested capital (ROIC), and ROIC was very high at these software companies. Now that they are becoming capital-intensive hardware companies, ROIC is sure to fall, and this will pressure shares in the long run,\" Burry wrote.\n\nAI, Burry said, is pushing companies like Microsoft, Google, and Meta away from their historically asset-light software models and toward a far more capital-intensive future defined by data centers, chips, and energy.\n\nEven if AI expands Big Tech's addressable market, he said, falling ROIC could pressure stock prices for years to come.\n\nBurry rose to fame after his bet against the mid-2000s housing boom was chronicled in \"The Big Short.\" Outside the occasional cryptic social media post, Burry, for a long time, spoke publicly only rarely.\n\nThat changed late last year when he closed his hedge fund to outside cash and began writing financial analysis on Substack.\n\nPerhaps most notably, he has recently compared the AI boom to the late-1990s dot-com bubble, calling OpenAI the \"Netscape of our time.\" Netscape's IPO marked the beginning of dot-com hype in 1995. Five years later, the bubble burst.\n\nBurry's hedge fund, Scion Asset Management, has made large bets against Nvidia and Palantir Technologies, two darlings of the AI era, according to a regulatory filing released in September last year.\n\nLeading AI companies, like OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and Meta, are spending big to build out the infrastructure they need to support their energy- and data-intensive chatbots and other AI applications. Debt and equity investors have lined up to back these projects.\n\nSo far, however, those companies have not shown significant profit returns on their AI products, leading investors like Burry to sound the alarm that AI is a bubble on the verge of bursting.\n\nAgreed. And still, return on investment will continue to fall, almost all AI companies will go bankrupt, and much of the AI spending will be written off. Will it be the Panic of 2026? 2027? Does not have to be. https://t.co/VBWjh26vnc\n\n\"At some point, this spending on the AI buildout has to have a return on investment higher than the cost of that investment, or there is just no economic value added,\" Burry wrote in the Substack post.",

    "description": "167 software engineers responded to Business Insider's vibe-coding survey. Over 45% reported \"keeping up\" with AI tools. Almost 17% feel behind.",
    "fullText": "AI has radically changed what coding looks like. We asked software engineers how they felt about it.\n\nAndrej Karpathy coined the term \"vibe-coding,\" or the creation of code using AI. The term has since gained traction among developers worldwide and was named Collins Dictionary's Word of the Year for 2025.\n\nLess than a year after his post, Karpathy wrote that he had \"never felt this much behind as a programmer.\"\n\nWe asked developers: When it comes to vibe-coding, do you feel ahead, behind, or like you're keeping pace?\n\n167 software engineers responded to our survey. The biggest cohort — 75 engineers, or 46.9% — said that they were \"keeping up.\" 30 engineers said they felt ahead of the curve, while 27 felt behind.\n\n28 engineers (or 17.5% of respondents) said that they were opting out of using AI code editing tools entirely. These engineers wrote that the tools weren't advanced enough, or that they took too long to learn how to use. None of the 28 agreed to speak on the record after Business Insider reached out.\n\nWhile the survey isn't scientific, the results offer insight into how software engineers are feeling about their rapidly changing industry.\n\nIn follow-up conversations, eight engineers told Business Insider how they feel about AI code editors. All found them helpful in some form, though their usages ranged from one-off tools to lifesavers.\n\nRyan Shah sometimes wonders: \"Did I really need to learn how to write code?\"\n\nThe 23-year-old AI consultant from Atlanta recently graduated with a degree in computer information technology. Now he uses Cursor and Google's Antigravity, paired with Claude Opus 4.5, which he said was at \"midlevel engineer status.\"\n\nShah said he doesn't regret his software engineering courses, though. They taught him to \"read\" code, he said, a skill that, coupled with his vibe-coding proficiencies, keeps him from being \"the first one laid off.\"\n\nJavanie Campbell swung the other way: He warned that over-reliance on vibe-coding tools will put your career in danger.\n\n\"For people who turn to the LLM as the God or the expert, they will be replaced,\" said the 35-year-old CEO of DevDaysAtWork, who is based in Jamaica.\n\nAmong software engineers, there's a debate brewing: Just how bad will the effects of AI code editors be on jobs? Some say they will shrink the industry's workforce; others call them tools, not replacements for engineers.\n\nThe first time Ryan Clinton tried vibe-coding, he got scared for his job. He's not fearful anymore, he said.\n\nClinton's engineering level won't be affected, said the 46-year-old software developer from Nashville. More experienced engineers work on \"architecture and design,\" he said, while more junior staffers code. At this point of AI coding, human intervention is also still routinely necessary.\n\n\"You want to make sure it makes sense,\" he said. \"Only an idiot would randomly click 'yes' and commit it.\"\n\nBarry Fruitman is more worried — but not for himself. At 56, the Android developer from Toronto doesn't think the job market will feel the effect until five to 10 years out.\n\n\"Today, I think the threat is overstated, and hopefully it will stay that way until I retire,\" he said.\n\nEd Gaile said AI tools have doubled, if not tripled, his productivity.\n\nThe 55-year-old Appfire principal solutions architect from Atlanta was impressed by the decrease in context switching that vibe-coding tools brought.\n\n\"I wish I had this 15 years ago,\" he said.\n\nFor AI code editors, the word \"productivity\" still looms large. Many people feel that they're saving time by using these tools. Others cite the additional time spent reviewing and correcting lines of code.\n\nA July METR study added fuel to the fire.\n\nThe study asked experienced developers to complete a series of tasks. Study participants working without AI's help spent 10% more time coding — but those with AI assistance spent 20% more time reviewing AI outputs, prompting AI, waiting on AI, or being idle. Ultimately, the study found that the AI-assisted developers were less productive.\n\nShawn Gay, a 54-year-old R&D manager from El Paso, Texas, spends time keeping up with the industry's changes. He said he felt behind the curve.\n\n\"I have decades of experience, so I feel like it's a huge effort to try to change the way my brain thinks about software,\" Gay told Business Insider.\n\nGus De Souza said that he saved time on coding, but spent more time reviewing the AI-generated code. The real productivity gains were in troubleshooting, said the 48-year-old software architect from Kitchener, Ontario.\n\nWhat even is a vibe-coder? While the term has grown to encompass most forms of AI-assisted coding, Karpathy's X post first defined it as when developers \"fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists.\"\n\nLara Fraser, a data analyst and epidemiologist from Sarasota, Florida, doesn't consider herself a vibe-coder.\n\nFraser codes in R and uses tools like ChatGPT and Claude to assist. She's tried other tools, but found high rates of hallucination. The model generation also matters, Fraser said: GPT 5.1 was great, but 5.2 was a \"disaster.\"\n\nFor Fraser, vibe-coding depends on the programmer's skill. Anyone can create an app, but not everyone can maintain it.\n\n\"Inevitably, something's going to break,\" she said. \"Can you fix it? If you can't, you're a vibe-coder.\"",

The article has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nBefore the full-scale war, I was a software engineer, working for companies in San Francisco, New Zealand, and Germany.\n\nToday, I lead a team of five to six Ukrainian drone operators. Our task is to use high-flying drones to provide reconnaissance data to our troops and commanders.\n\nWith our intelligence, artillery such as HIMARS and drone strike teams can target Russian equipment and soldiers, often before they can even reach the front lines.\n\nWe were redeployed to the Pokrovsk area in August because the fighting there had become so intense. Because drone operators are priority targets in the war, we would spend our dayslong rotations in houses and underground bunkers outside the city.\n\nWhen we first arrived, the weather was sunny and ideal for flying.\n\nBut the end of October was a disaster for us. Ukraine turns foggy in the autumn, with thick and low clouds that can stack from 100 meters to 300 meters above the ground.\n\nThese are so thick that no infrared camera or thermal camera can see through them, and caused many days to be completely no-go for flying for our types of drones.\n\nAt the time, the Russians took advantage of the clouds, using them to cover their advance on foot and in vehicles. Given the weather, the number of personnel they sacrificed to take the city, and our limited resources, there was eventually no viable way for us to defend Pokrovsk forever.\n\nUkraine is dependent on drone warfare. It has carried us through the terrible and scary times of these Russian assaults, and it has changed the face of war. For the entire summer of 2025, for example, I saw a tank only twice on the battlefield.\n\nDrones are cheap and effective, and if we had an infinite number of drones, we would have been working 24/7 to fight the Russians in Pokrovsk.\n\nBut we don't have infinite drones, so in the meantime, we need other strike tools and resources, such as more artillery fire and troops. War is complex, and drones cannot be its only solution.\n\nIn normal conditions, we fly our drones four times a day, with each flight lasting about three to four hours and sometimes into the night. It's tiring, but worth it, because you can make an enormous difference for Ukrainian defenders. We can spot where Russian forces are moving, denying them the element of surprise, and scout for assets such as air defenses and artillery for commanders to strike.\n\nRecon drone operators like us rely heavily on visual navigation. We study Pokrovsk so closely that, even when our drone is being spoofed, we can determine our flying location simply by the shape of the terrain or landmarks.\n\nWhen the foggy season comes, we try to make the most of any good visibility. Sometimes, you can get lucky and perform five flights in a five-day rotation.\n\nHowever, there were days when we found ourselves sitting in a house, just waiting for the weather to clear.\n\nYou can try to fly under the clouds, but going low means our bulky drones are more easily spotted and destroyed. Since we have limited tools, we try to preserve them and not use them recklessly.\n\nStill, on days with strong winds, there's a chance that the clouds may break slightly and give you glimpses of the battlefield. Sometimes, when visibility is bad but not impossible to work with, we must risk flying in such weather, especially if our troops are defending against a major assault.\n\nIn late summer, the situation in Pokrovsk was becoming increasingly problematic, both on the ground and in the sky. Back in the day, we would help long-range artillery focus on the Russian rear.\n\nI began to notice that Russia's tactics were making an impact around September.\n\nAcross the warzone, their strategy is to find our limit and overwhelm it with the smallest number of soldiers needed to seize our positions.\n\nIt is simple mathematics. Initially, they would send around 10 soldiers. If that wasn't enough, they would send 20. Then they would try 30.\n\nDay by day, they increase the number of troops and equipment. Their goal is to create a situation where we don't have enough drones to counter the amount of attacking infantry.\n\nTo eliminate an assault of 50 guys, all spread out, we'd need at least 150 drones and artillery, which is difficult for us to organize with our limited resources.\n\nWhen we were working in Pokrovsk, there were already areas of the city where the Russians had advanced, so the fighting area was porous and undefined.\n\nIf we had more troops, we could have held out for much longer and performed more aggressive maneuvers.\n\nIf we had more recon drones, our team could have flown over Pokrovsk nonstop, working despite the clouds.\n\nWith more first-person-view strike drones, our pilots could continue to find and attack the Russians closer to the ground.\n\nBut we don't have enough. So, we need other strike tools besides FPV drones, even though they account for about 80% of our kills on Russians.\n\nIronically, some of these tools have disappeared because warfare has changed so much. Mortars might have helped, but we mostly stopped using them — the battlefield is now so transparent that it is a suicide mission to ride around close to the front line in your pickup truck with a mortar.\n\nWhat we definitely need is artillery ammunition.

We would find them a target, and they would say: \"We don't have any more for today.

    "description": "In this Sunday edition of Business Insider Today, we're discussing the proposed tax on billionaires that's dividing the tech elite.",
    "fullText": "California's billionaires are at a crossroads.\n\nOne of the biggest business stories kicking off the year is the proposed wealth tax in California. The state's rich and powerful, worth more than $1 billion, would face a one-time 5% tax on their assets if the plan gets approved.\n\nThe proposal, which aims to address a projected multibillion-dollar state budget deficit, has prompted plenty of grumbling among the California elite.\n\nAs Business Insider first reported, some have already taken action, including Google cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin.\n\nPage converted his secretive family office out of California in late December and incorporated it in Delaware, according to my colleague Hugh Langley's exclusive reporting. Page also recently incorporated other entities in Delaware, including a vehicle used to fund influenza research and another used for his flying car ventures. He lists principal office addresses outside of California for those entities.\n\nSeparately, an entity tied to both Brin and Page moved out of California at the end of 2025.\n\nThe timing of these moves is crucial. If the ballot measure is approved in November, it would take effect retroactively for residents living in California as of January 1, 2026. Hence, the rush to move assets before the end of the year.\n\nBrin and Page are two of the richest people on the planet, with a combined net worth north of half a trillion dollars, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang struck a very different tone. He said he's \"perfectly fine\" with the tax and gave no indication he plans to leave Silicon Valley, even if it costs him.\n\nOthers are more pessimistic. LinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman called the proposal \"horrendous\" for innovation, warning that poorly designed wealth taxes don't raise reliable revenue — they push money and talent elsewhere.\n\nAlex Spiro, the celebrity lawyer who represents several billionaires, sent a letter to Gov. Gavin Newsom last month warning that the tax would drive capital and innovation out of California.\n\nEarlier this month, White House AI Czar David Sacks predicted Austin would overtake San Francisco as the American tech hub. His social media post ricocheted throughout tech and venture circles, drawing cheers from anti-coastal contrarians and sharp pushback from traditionalists.\n\nWhere do you stand on the proposed billionaire's tax in California?

    "description": "Why Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) is on investors’ radar today Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) is drawing attention as investors reassess its recent share performance, business mix, and current valuation signals, using the latest financial metrics as a fresh reference point. See our latest analysis for Berkshire Hathaway. At a share price of US$499.",
    "fullText": "Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) is drawing attention as investors reassess its recent share performance, business mix, and current valuation signals, using the latest financial metrics as a fresh reference point.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Berkshire Hathaway.\n\nAt a share price of US$499.10, Berkshire Hathaway’s short term share price return has been relatively steady, while a 1 year total shareholder return of 12.75% and 5 year total shareholder return of 113.76% point to momentum that has built up over time.\n\nIf Berkshire’s mix of insurance, rail and utilities has you thinking about portfolio balance, it could be a good moment to broaden your watchlist with fast growing stocks with high insider ownership.\n\nWith Berkshire trading at US$499.10, showing a 36% intrinsic discount estimate and sitting only slightly below analyst targets, you have to ask: is there still mispricing here, or is the market already banking on future growth?\n\nBerkshire Hathaway is trading on a P/E of 16x at a last close of US$499.10, which points to a valuation that sits below several reference points investors often watch.\n\nThe P/E ratio compares the current share price with earnings per share, so you are essentially seeing how many dollars the market is paying for each dollar of recent earnings. For a diversified group like Berkshire, with insurance, rail and utilities alongside a wide spread of operating businesses, P/E is a quick way to stack its earnings price tag against peers and against an estimated fair level.\n\nOn one side, Berkshire screens as good value versus a peer average P/E of 26.9x and an estimated fair P/E of 18.7x. This suggests the current 16x multiple sits below levels the market could move towards. On the other side, it shows as slightly expensive relative to the broader US diversified financials industry on 15x, which hints that investors are paying a small premium to that industry for Berkshire’s earnings profile despite the recent drop in profit margins from 28.9% to 18.1% and a low 9.7% return on equity.\n\nCompared with the sector, that mix is important. The 16x P/E undercuts peers on 26.9x quite sharply, yet it still edges above the 15x industry average. This frames Berkshire as cheaper than similar companies used in the peer set but somewhat dearer than the wider diversified financials group.\n\nExplore the SWS fair ratio for Berkshire Hathaway\n\nResult: Price-to-Earnings of 16x (UNDERVALUED)\n\nHowever, weaker net income growth, lower profit margins, and a modest 9.7% return on equity could challenge the idea that Berkshire’s current P/E offers clear value.",

    "description": "From Davos and the Super Bowl to Burning Man and St. Barts, see the predictable social calendar billionaires follow and how much it all costs.",
    "fullText": "Like wildebeest migrating across the plains of East Africa or monarch butterflies flying thousands of miles south every winter, billionaires are a remarkably predictable breed.\n\nThe world's nearly 3,000 billionaires follow a familiar annual circuit: cruising between vacation spots on superyachts, jetting to marquee sporting events, and suiting up for the same closed-door business conferences.\n\n\"Birds of a feather flock together,\" Doug Gollan, the founder of Private Jet Card Comparison, told Business Insider.\n\nEach year, private jets congregate at events like The Masters or Super Bowl, he said.\n\n2026 is no different. There will be the Davos and Sun Valley conferences, the FIFA World Cup, and the Monaco yacht show. In between, some billionaires may attend Art Basel or the Oscars.\n\nHere's a look at the 2026 billionaire calendar — and how much it would cost to join them.\n\nBusiness leaders and politicians gather at the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, to kick off their year with policy discussions, networking, and, if time allows, some ski runs.\n\nThis year's summit, which runs from January 19 to 23, is themed \"A Spirit of Dialogue.\" While speakers have not been announced, regular attendees include BlackRock CEO Larry Fink (a cochair of the WEF), Bridgewater founder Ray Dalio, and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff.\n\nAccess to the invite-only event can cost tens of thousands of dollars, and most of Davos' luxury hotels, such as the Steigenberger Grandhotel Belvédère and AlpenGold, are closed to the public.\n\nApartment rental rates typically jump during the event, with nearby units commanding at least four figures a night. The surge pricing also applies to food. With most of the restaurants booked up for conference events, you may be left paying $43 for a hot dog.\n\nNFL teams are popular toys of the ultrarich: Walmart's Rob Walton has the Broncos, hedge fund manager David Tepper owns the Panthers, Clark Hunt and his siblings control the Chiefs, and so on.\n\nThese billionaire owners — as well as billionaire fans and friends — flock to the Super Bowl, and this year's game on February 8 in Santa Clara, California, will be no exception.\n\n\"The Super Bowl is always a draw. It's an excuse to see the best of the best in terms of sports, parties, and entertainment,\" Elisabeth Brown, client manager at travel and lifestyle concierge company Knightsbridge Circle, told Business Insider.\n\nHost committees and travel agencies curate luxury experiences for the wealthiest football fans, which can cost six figures and include chartered jets, five-star accommodations, and access to the field after the game. Throughout the weekend, there are VIP parties featuring celebrity guests and billionaire hosts, like Fanatics CEO Michael Rubin, who's become known for his star-studded annual Super Bowl bash.\n\nThe most exclusive celebration of them all, though, is in the winning team's locker room. Just ask billionaire Jeffrey Lurie, whose Philadelphia Eagles snagged the trophy last year.\n\nAs Hollywood and the tech world become increasingly intertwined, the Academy Awards and the various events surrounding it have become a magnet for billionaires.\n\nOprah Winfrey took the stage at last year's ceremony to honor Quincy Jones, and the Vanity Fair Oscars Party drew Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez Bezos — Amazon produced nominee \"The Nickel Boys\" — as well as Alphabet cofounder Sergey Brin and Skims cofounder Kim Kardashian. Two other billionaires, Jay-Z and Beyoncé, typically throw a rival after-party at Chateau Marmont.\n\nThis year's Oscars, which will be held on March 15, are likely to draw a similarly monied crowd. Larry Ellison, whose son David Ellison leads the storied movie studio Paramount, may make an appearance, as may billionaires Steven Spielberg, who produced in Best Picture hopeful \"Hamnet,\" and James Cameron, director of \"Avatar: Fire and Ash.\"\n\nThe Masters Tournament, taking place from April 9 to 12 this year, kicks off the run of major professional golf championships and signals the start of spring for billionaires.\n\nEach year, hundreds of private aircraft land at the airports around Augusta. In past years, billionaires like former Nike CEO Phil Knight, hotelier Robert Rowling, and investor Herbert Allen Jr. have had their planes touch down. So has Tiger Woods, the only billionaire winner of The Masters.\n\nThe tournament's venue, the famously exclusive Augusta National Golf Club in Georgia, counts a number of billionaires among its members.\n\nWarren Buffett, Bill Gates, Warren Stephens, David Ziff, and Stanley Druckenmiller have belonged to the club, Bloomberg reported in 2015. It's invite-only, and new members can only join when existing ones leave.\n\nThe general public can spectate alongside some of the biggest names in business. Tickets for the Masters are available through a lottery system.\n\nEvery year, the Milken Institute, a think tank founded by billionaire investor Michael Milken, hosts the Milken Global Conference in Los Angeles.\n\nDubbed the Davos of the West Coast, Milken launched the summit in 1998 as a forum for discussions on economic and policy matters.\n\nWhile the program for this year's conference, running from May 3 to 6, has not been announced, last year, Henry Kravis, Bill Ackman, and Jensen Huang were among the billionaire speakers.\n\nThe event isn't technically invite-only; members of the public can pay $35,000 to support the Institute as a council member and receive complimentary admission.\n\nWhile billionaires tend to spend June in the Hamptons or on yachts crisscrossing the Mediterranean, this year, many are expected to head to arenas across North America for the FIFA World Cup.\n\n\"The big, big, big thing everybody's talking about and getting tickets for right now is the World Cup,\" Charlie Garcia, the founder of centimillionaire membership club R360, told Business Insider.\n\nThe soccer competition, which takes place every four years, starts in June and runs through early July. Tickets for the final at MetLife Stadium start at over $9,000 on the resale market.\n\nWhile the tournament organizes teams by country, many star players are signed to clubs owned by billionaires, including Todd Boehly and Mark Walter's Chelsea, Stan Kroenke's Arsenal, and John Henry's Liverpool.\n\nThere will likely be at least one billionaire on the field: Cristiano Ronaldo, who is set to play for Portugal.\n\nPrivate jets descend on the small town of Hailey, Idaho, every July for the Allen & Company Sun Valley Conference.\n\nSince 1983, boutique investment bank Allen & Co. — its president, Herbert Allen, is a billionaire himself — has hosted the event, which attracts the biggest and richest names in business, such as Jeff Bezos, Sam Altman, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, and Warren Buffett.\n\nThe conference has become known for the deals struck in between rounds of golf, guided hikes, and tennis matches. It's where Jeff Bezos snagged The Washington Post for $250 million in 2013 and where the seed for Disney's $19 billion acquisition of ABC was planted in 1995.\n\nLast year was no exception. David Ellison, the scion of billionaire Larry Ellison, met with Bari Weiss at the conference to discuss Paramount Skydance's potential purchase of The Free Press, The New York Times reported. In October, the $150 million deal was announced.\n\nThe vacation-cum-business-meeting is invite-only and pretty much restricted to masters of the universe. Security is strict, with even the press walled off from most of the wheeling and dealing.\n\nBurning Man — the anticapitalist art and music festival in the Nevada desert — has been a rite of passage for the tech elite for decades.\n\nGoogle cofounders Sergey Brin and Larry Page are longtime Burners — the festival inspired the very first Google Doodle — as is Eric Schmidt, Google's former CEO. Facebook cofounders Dustin Moskowitz and Mark Zuckerberg, and Uber cofounder Garrett Camp have also attended. Even Ray Dalio, the billionaire hedge fund manager, joined in 2019.\n\nLast year's festival, marked by storms in Black Rock City, drew fewer billionaires than in previous years.\n\nStill, hundreds of private planes flew into Burning Man's temporary airport during the festival. The starting price to charter a plane through Burner Express Air was $18,000, one way.\n\nThis year's festival runs from August 30 to September 7, with planning already underway by the Burning Man Project.\n\nThe coastline of Monte Carlo, already a haven for the ultrawealthy, becomes crowded with superyachts at the end of September for the Monaco Yacht Show, where billionaires scope out their new toys.\n\nThe 120-plus superyachts on display feature elevators, bars, spas, pools, gyms, hot tubs, and helipads, and were worth a combined $5 billion last year. Jet Skis and submersibles are popular add-ons.\n\nLast year's yacht show featured yachts owned by the likes of billionaires Denis O'Brien and Paul Fireman. The largest of them, Mar, is still listed for sale with an asking price of $230 million.\n\nIn the past, yachts owned by billionaires such as Paul Allen, Steve Wynn, and Sergey Brin have been exhibited at the show.\n\nThe Monaco Yacht Show is open to the public, with one-day passes starting at about $800.\n\nOctober presents numerous opportunities for the affluent to expand their art collections.\n\nFirst, the Frieze Art Fair and nearby Frieze Masters, held annually in London, focus on contemporary art and pre-21st-century art, respectively. In years past, collectors like Point72's Steve Cohen and Diamond titan Laurence Graff have been spotted there.\n\nShortly after, across the English Channel, is Art Basel Paris, a relatively new addition to the art fair circuit.\n\nLast year's fair drew James Murdoch, an investor in Art Basel's parent company, as well as Delphine Arnault, the daughter of Bernard, and billionaire art collector J. Tomilson Hill.\n\nA painting by Gerhard Richter marked the fair's biggest sale, fetching $23 million, and several works sold for seven-figure sums. Exactly which moneyed collectors are behind specific purchases tends to be kept under wraps.\n\nWhile the VIP previews, when most billionaires are spotted, are invite-only, anyone can buy tickets to these shows themselves, which begin on October 14 with the Frieze fairs.\n\nFormula 1 has become a passion for billionaires over the past couple of decades.\n\nThe racing business itself is owned by John Malone's Liberty Media, and nearly all of the teams are connected to billionaires through their ownership structures.\n\nThe various Grand Prix attract these wealthy owners and fans thanks to the races and parties. Monaco maybe a marquee of the F1 calendar, but newer events like the Las Vegas Grand Prix increasingly draw big names.\n\nLast year's race drew billionaires, including Beyoncé and Jay-Z, Magic Johnson, Fanatics founder and CEO Michael Rubin, and Aston Martin Team owner Laurence Stroll.\n\nThree-day passes for the Sin City heat, which runs from November 19 to 21 this year, started at $400 for general admission last year but rose considerably for various seating and package options.\n\nWhile Aspen and Vail remain billionaire favorites over the holidays, no destination is as popular as St. Barts when it comes to ringing in the new year.\n\nLast year, superyachts owned by the likes of David Geffen, Jerry Jones, and Eric Schmidt were moored off the Caribbean island's coast. Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez Bezos were seen partying at a beach club.\n\nFor those who don't stay on yachts, rooms at popular luxury hotels like Eden Rock and Cheval Blanc, owned by Bernard Arnault's LVMH, cost upward of $7,000 a night.\n\n\"There is nothing mass-market about it,\" Winston Chesterfield, the founder of Barton, a consulting firm focused on luxury and the wealthy, told Business Insider. \"It's impossible to be there unless you are really wealthy.\"",

    "description": "You can bet on anything from sports to Labubus now, but prediction markets are also a valuable tool for investors, Danny Moses told Business Insider.",
    "fullText": "You can bet on pretty much anything these days. From sports to the weather to the price of a Labubu, platforms like Polymarket and Kalshi have offered people a new way to gamble.\n\nAccording to Danny Moses, one of the investors from \"The Big Short,\" they've also offered investors a useful tool to help navigate markets.\n\nMoses, who was among the investors betting against the US housing market ahead of the 2008 crash, isn't surprised by the prediction-market boom, and he thinks investors need to be watching these markets closely to stay on top of their game.\n\n\"I think it's great to scan through all the prediction markets out there, certainly economics and business-related, because it actually will get you thinking about things you might have been missing,\" he told Business Insider in an interview before the new year.\n\nMoses isn't too focused on short opportunities these days, despite being famous for his role in Michael Lewis's now-iconic saga of the housing crash. But he thinks that prediction markets can serve to provide valuable info for bullish and bearish investors alike.\n\nHe pointed to the recent example of popular fintech stock SoFi Technologies being listed as having a 38% chance of being added to the benchmark index in 2026, something that could be a likely catalyst for the stock, which is up 93% in the last year.\n\n\"If you're short SoFi and you weren't thinking about the possibility of it being added to the S&P 500, like we just saw happen to Carvana recently, that's something you need to be aware of,\" Moses said.\n\nThat's not the only way prediction markets could help investors make smarter decisions. Moses said he thinks there may be circumstances where they can offer a more appealing risk-reward than investors might get from traditional derivatives. He cited crypto as an example.\n\n\"Will bitcoin trade below $70,000 in the first quarter of 2026?\" he mused. \"Well, if I own bitcoin, and it's a much cheaper way to bet, if it's an eight cent possibility, so call it twelve to one, I might be getting a better market, or I might want to buy that rather than buying a put option on crypto.\"\n\nIn his view, it's early days for prediction markets. Their usefulness will grow as a predictive tool for hedging traditional investments as well as gauging the likelihood of market-moving events. And as they grow, expect more prominent players to participate, he said.\n\n\"I think institutions are going to start using prediction markets more, and as institutions use it, you're going to see a lot more activity,\" he said.",

    "fullText": "Global Ripple Effects of Corporate Tax Reforms\n\n Sebastian Dyrda, \n\n Guangbin Hong, \n\n Muhammad Ali Sajid \n\n & Joseph B. Steinberg \n\n Working Paper 34627\n\n DOI 10.3386/w34627\n\n Issue Date January 2026\n\nWe study international spillovers of corporate tax reforms in a fragmented global tax regime. Using firm-level evidence on the 2017 U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) and a quantitative general-equilibrium model, we illustrate how multinational enterprises (MNEs) propagate local policy shocks throughout the global economy. Our framework emphasizes two key intrinsic properties of intangible capital: non-rivalry and mobile ownership. We find the TCJA generated positive outward spillovers: First, it boosted U.S. MNEs’ intangible investment, raising their foreign subsidiaries’ output. Second, it increased tangible investment of foreign MNEs’ U.S. subsidiaries, incentivizing them to expand intangible investment at home. Conversely, a Global Minimum Tax (GMT) implemented by the rest of the world generates negative inward spillovers for the United States, even if U.S.-parented MNEs are exempt. These findings illustrate that there is no such thing as a purely domestic corporate tax policy.\n\n Acknowledgements and Disclosures\n\nWe are grateful to the International Tax Policy Forum for financial support of this project.

Another popular chain, Fresh Choice launched in California in 1986.\n\nI remember the beginning of the salad dining craze in the early 1980s, as I dined at a casual restaurant called The Salad Bar along Sacramento's K Street mall in 1982.\n\nUnfortunately, the restaurant did not last long, but other restaurants chains with salad bars, such as Sizzler and Wendy's, filled the void until the industry prospered.\n\nSouper Salad had expanded to over 150 locations by the early 2000s, but industry headwinds and a downturn in consumer confidence led to a 2011 bankruptcy filing and continued restaurant closings, according to Nation's Restaurant News.\n\nThe restaurant chain only has three locations today in Lubbock, Pasadena, and El Paso, Texas.\n\n6703 Slide Road, Lubbock, Texas\n\n5822 Fairmont Parkway, Pasadena, Texas\n\n8900 Viscount Blvd., El Paso, Texas Source\n\nFresh Choice filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy on July 24, 2012, according to PacerMonitor, and shut down its 20 remaining locations in December 2012.\n\nSweet Tomatoes and Souplantation's owner filed Chapter 11 in 2016, and then four years later, the buffet restaurant chain filed for Chapter 7 liquidation and permanently closed down its 97 locations, after the Covid-19 pandemic had forced a shut down, according to Nation's Restaurant News.\n\nSweet Tomatoes announced a comeback in 2025, as new owners ST Three LLC said they would open new locations in Tucson, Ariz., and Fort Myers, Fla., Gulfshore Business reported.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic devastated the salad bar/buffet dining concept in 2020, as buffet-style restaurants shut down across the nation as the pandemic forced strict health requirements upon restaurants and consumers became frightened of the thought of eating at such establishments.\n\nAfter Fresh Choice disappeared in 2012, another salad restaurant concept launched in Gilbert, Ariz., in 2013 — Salad and Go's fast-food drive-thru chain that rose to over 140 restaurant locations by May 2025.",

    "description": "Vince McMahon's wrestling business model may be monopolistic, but according to this WWE Hall of Famer, the McMahons' tactics were just good for business.",
    "fullText": "For many years, WWE was the definition of a professional wrestling monopoly, with its complete dominance of the professional wrestling market, industry-shaping practices, and strict closed-door policy to outside promotions. While the wrestling scene has since diversified, some may argue that the McMahon dynasty's ruthless business practices were a good thing — one of those advocates being WWE Hall of Famer Dory Funk Jr.\n\nFunk Jr. was interviewed on a recent episode of News4Jax's \"Going Ringside,\" and amidst questions about his decades-long career in the professional wrestling business, Funk Jr. was asked about Vince McMahon's total takeover of the professional wrestling business. Funk Jr., coming from a pre-WWE era of several, individual, fragmented promotions, praised McMahon's business tactics.\n\n\"Yeah, Vince bought everything. It was good for the business,\" Funk Jr. admitted.\n\nWhile Funk Jr. approved of McMahon's business model, he did not dismiss the importance of rival promotions to the professional wrestling ecosystem. While he did not name any specific competitors, Funk Jr. reasoned that the emergence of new companies — both those working with and against WWE — broaden the professional wrestling world, and contribute to its overall success.\n\n\"And then, other, new companies would come along, and be working with Vince, or working against him. It was good for the wrestling business,\" Funk Jr. elaborated.\n\nFunk Jr. confirmed he keeps up with professional wrestling in the present day, though to what extent the Hall of Famer follows the current product is unclear. He applauded modern wrestling as \"good business,\" and praised today's talents for their work ethic.\n\n\"Everybody works hard to give the fans what they would like to see,\" Funk Jr. concluded. \"And...I see the fans very, very eager to get behind professional wrestling.\"\n\nWhile Funk Jr. is advanced in his years, he still contributes to the professional wrestling world through limited in-ring activities and his wrestling school.\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

    "description": "Linda Kemp, 84, works at her son's law firm and lives below the poverty line. She recently moved to be closer to her son and can't retire.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Linda Kemp, 84, who mails letters at her son's law firm in Florida. Kemp said the work helps her stay current on her bills, and she is grateful to her son for the opportunity to hold a job. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nMost of my life I've been a caregiver to my children. I've had seven children, and they're now all over the planet. I have one in Australia, three in California, one in Hawaii, one in Ohio, and one here in Florida. My first marriage, I had four children, and the second marriage — which was only a common law marriage — I had three.\n\nWith my second husband, we built a house. When we split up, I freaked out a little.\n\nMy husband paid all the bills and gave me money to do the grocery shopping. I wasn't the main breadwinner, and I wasn't bringing in any money aside from selling some art that I made, which doesn't add up to enough to raise my children. We didn't live in luxury, but we were able to live comfortably. When he left, he gave the house to me.\n\nI managed to buy a house with the money I got from the house we built, but it was too big. I invested and reinvested in property, and each time I did that, I made more money. It helped me keep going once the kids had grown up. Today, they call it flipping. I managed to live comfortably, and I don't care about gold or fancy clothes.\n\nI designed a small, one-story house just for me. When I got older, I had four solar panels installed.\n\nPeople always have arguments over money. It's the downfall of man. Forget the darn money and be happy.\n\nI went back to school and got a degree in graphic design, which was the closest thing to art where I can make a living. I have always been an artist. I became computer literate and then got a job as a graphic designer. I worked at that company for a few years, designing software. I was in my 50s when that job ended.\n\nI made my lifestyle very economical. I'm an environmentalist, so I like to leave a very small footprint on the planet. It got to the point that it was just too much to handle taking care of five acres of farm with fruit trees, so I decided to sell the house.\n\nIn my retirement years, I was a chair of the Sierra Club where I lived and got involved in a lot of community affairs and historic preservation projects. I had friends who would go kayaking every week, and it was a very lovely and economical way to live.\n\nI moved to a home near Jacksonville just a few weeks ago. It's a little over 100 miles from where I was. It's not by the ocean, and it's in an area that blew up with developments everywhere. It's in a development where my son had lived in a golf club. He bought a bigger house in the same golf club about a mile up the road from where I am. It's a bit of a transition, and I'm not yet comfortable with everything here yet.\n\nMy son is an attorney, and so is his wife. They have three kids, and maybe five years ago, he asked me if I wanted to work for him by doing the mail. I was retired at the time. I figured it was a job I could do at home on a computer.\n\nWhen my son's dad left, he was 15 years old, and it was just us two left at home. At that point, it was us against the world. My job as a graphic designer helped him through college. since we introduced the job above He stood on his own after that and stayed in school to get a law degree.\n\nI was doing okay on my own after that and lived a conscious life of simplicity. At my age 84, it felt good that my son wanted to keep a close eye on how I was doing in my old age and for me to move closer to him. The decision was based on my 5-year-old granddaughter running up to hug me whenever I saw her. Who could want any more than that?\n\nI go online in the morning, and I have a line from the sheriff's office sending out a list of all the bookings from the night before. So they send out the names and addresses of all the people who have been booked. He does mainly DUI cases. I send them all a letter my son made asking them if they need an attorney. I address the envelopes, stamp them, and get them in the mail before the post office closes.\n\nI would probably do it for nothing if he asked me to because I enjoy it. It keeps me active, keeps my hands moving on the typewriter every day, and makes me get up and do something. I live by myself and have no male friends. I've had a few women friends, but lately they've all drifted away. I was pretty active in my past community because I'm an artist and involved with art gallery events, and I'm hoping I can become active in my new community.\n\nMondays are very busy because it's three days worth of bookings from the weekend. I probably work from around 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Mondays. On Tuesdays, I may work for six hours, Wednesday for three or four hours, and Thursday and Friday for two or three hours. I do basically 20 hours a week.\n\nI'm not paying any rent at this house, as it belongs to my son. I pay the utilities, and I'll need to pay for someone to cut the grass and shrubs because you can't have any weeds in the neighborhood. My whole income comes from what my son pays me and Social Security.\n\nMy son's my landlord, so he's not going to kick me out. He wants me here, and he doesn't ask for anything except that I work. He had only one request for me, which was to watch my grandchildren once a month so he and his wife could go out on a date. I said, \"Once a month? Why don't you go out once a week?\"\n\nI recently injured myself unexpectedly. I had a vein in my right wrist blow out, which has affected my hand. Still, I'm in pretty good health, although I take seven pills every day. Whatever the doctors tell me, I do it. You can't fight Mother Nature. I'm not wasting my life in the gym either.\n\nI look pretty good for my age. When I tell them how old I am, they think I was 60. My mother lived to be 93, and I'm going for 100.\n\nI haven't quite landed on what I'm going to focus on in the future. I just need to assess the situation around me. I think working 20 hours a week is very comfortable for me because that gives me half the time to be a creative person. I've done all kinds of painting, printmaking, and jewelry making. Whatever I do next, it probably will be some kind of entrepreneur job where I'm my own boss, if I still have the energy to do that.\n\nIt's just like starting all over again. It feels like I just graduated from college.",

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Michelle Hu, a 30-year-old business owner based in New York City. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nMy first business died as quickly as it started.\n\nIn 2017, I was working as an investment banking analyst at Citi when I launched Mei, a beauty app where users could filter through and book appointments with makeup artists, hair stylists, and more. It was a one-year process of trying to scale and pouring in about $30,000 in the process, but we ultimately never launched.\n\nIn the meantime, I was selling handmade acrylic makeup holders online under the brand name Étoile. Mei failed, but I saw Étoile gaining traction on its own. I realized it could take off — and it did.\n\nTwo years later, I quit my job and went all in on Étoile. I transformed it into a world for beauty enthusiasts, crafting accessories that elevate daily rituals. We made over $9 million in revenue last year and recently launched our products in nearly 30 Anthropologie stores across the US.\n\nHere's what I learned from my failed business that helped me the second time around.\n\nI was so in love with the beauty industry that I jumped right in with Mei, but I had no tech background and no idea what really went into building an app. I remember thinking the idea of creating this techy business app sounded cool, but it just wasn't a fit for my skill set or interests. I had no business creating an app.\n\nWhen time's got hard, and the app required more time, energy, and money than I bargained for, I didn't have the passion for my product to drive me. Starting Étoile, a consumer product business, felt a lot more aligned with me.\n\nI learned it's important to start a business in an industry you love, because when things get difficult, you need the passion to fuel you. I'm not passionate about tech, but I am passionate about designing products. That passion fuels me to work through the hurdles.\n\nI now realize that I never had product-market fit with Mei. Most people text or DM to book makeup artists or hairstylists, and I learned the hard way that it's difficult to change consumer behavior.\n\nMy initial vision for Étoile was for it to be an \"everything store\" for beauty, featuring items such as ring lights and vanity tables. However, our customer base was fragmented.\n\nThat's when I took what I learned from Mei and scaled back on items that weren't driving a significant amount of revenue, focusing on what worked: our travel range of products. Since then, we've developed a strong customer base that's excited about our product. I can feel the difference between having headwinds in the business versus having tailwinds.\n\nWhen we hit that product-market fit magic, everything seemed to move a lot more efficiently in the business.\n\nI think the biggest financial mistake I made was not vetting the people we chose to build the app. It sounds silly because it seems so obvious, but I think I was just so new to the world of business and thought, \"If they've made one app before, then they can make any app.\"\n\nWe hired college students from around the world and basically threw money at them without meeting them or vetting them. We couldn't afford people with a strong portfolio, so we just filtered through others who were just as scrappy as us. I didn't realize there was such a big scope of different app developers.\n\nI've always lived by the saying, \"move fast and break things,\" but when you're spending so much money to hire people, do more research.\n\nI think hiring is still a tricky one. The thing that helps is that we have a much bigger budget than we did with Mei. The people we choose to work with have a strong portfolio of brands that they've previously worked with. I think bigger budgets have allowed for better opportunities.\n\nWhen I shut down Mei, I had to admit that things weren't working and even learn to be OK with failure.\n\nAt the start of Étoile, I held onto our product strategy so tightly, even when it wasn't working. My thought process was that we had our products ready to go, stored in a warehouse, and marketed to our audience, so I thought it would be a bad look to pull back on them, even when they weren't working.\n\nWhen I finally made the shift and pulled back on items like mirrors and tables, the business made a complete 180. It reaffirmed that it's important to admit when things aren't working and not to have so much pride when it comes to my business.\n\nDo you have a story to share about lessons learned from a failed business?

    "description": "Chrissy Traore and her husband Ben started a bakery in New York. When they needed more space, they turned to shipping containers as the solution.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Chrissy Traore, 41, who opened See & Be Kitchen with her husband Ben Salif Traore in Cairo, New York, about 40 miles from Albany, New York. When their business expanded quickly, they began running parts of it out of shipping containers on their property. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nBen and I met while I was a chef and he was a baker. We worked at the same restaurant — they had a bakery and a restaurant right next door, and I was their pizza chef and he was their head baker. I had to mix my pizza dough in his mixer and that's kind of how we met.\n\nBefore, I worked on Madison Avenue in marketing and brand strategy, and in 2008, the economy crashed and my job crashed too. When that happened, I moved into food. I took a job on an ice cream truck and just fell in love with food work.\n\nI was in the food industry in various ways in New York City from about 2008 until 2017.\n\nWhile working in the industry, I was unhappy with the way that they treated employees. I was in management at the time, so I could see the full round numbers.\n\nI thought, \"There has to be a better way, but it's not my job to change this business owner or this business.\"\n\nBen and I talked a lot about it, and we were going upstate frequently — I was working at a place upstate as their first chef.\n\nI said, \"We should really move upstate.\" It's more our speed. We like the outdoors. We like having space. The quality of life is better. We love farming and being close to what's happening on the ground, literally. In 2017 we said, let's get out of the city.\n\nWe didn't have a ton of money, and we had to be scrappy and thoughtful about how we deployed the resources that we had saved. We wanted a place where we could live and work, so we wanted property and land — that was important to us.\n\nWe found a property in Cairo, New York, and it had been a bar and a hotel, so it was already grandfathered in on DOH, and had some structures there. We have 11 acres, and the house was practically falling apart, so we could afford it. We paid $189,900, and that was it. We went all in.\n\nWe knew we wanted to open our own place and we were trying to discover what that was. We knew it would involve Ben's bread and my cooking.\n\nWe started renovating the property and doing farmers markets, and that's how we got to know the community that we were in.\n\nWe came in quietly, like, \"Let's see what's already here and get to know people before we just bash them over the head with what we do.\" Let's see what they want, because ultimately we're entering a community that's not necessarily ours yet.\n\nWe were moving from Bed-Stuy in Brooklyn, and part of the reason we moved out was we saw that happening. People were moving in and they would say, \"We need to fix this. This is broken.\" And I'm like, \"What is broken? This is a wonderful community. Please stop.\"\n\nSometime in 2018, we turned into See & Be. Then, from there, we really got some traction at farmers markets.\n\nWe were doing porch pickups — people could pick up their orders at a local massage therapist's house — so we had started operating, but we didn't have a physical space yet.\n\nWe were still building out the cafe in the very small already existing structure on our property. We had one oven, with one proofer, a little cooktop that I would do the sandwiches on, and a coffee station with this beautiful wooden bar that people could sit at. And we opened that in February of 2019. Ben baked everything; I ran the front of house.\n\nWe had a five-year plan and it went into overdrive. Soon, we needed more space, and I could not get a building up fast enough. With traditional buildings, we looked at it and we thought it was going to take a year and a half to two years. We couldn't do that. We needed space like tomorrow.\n\nI had worked for a company while in Brooklyn that was actually my first shipping container job. That was at the DeKalb Market, and it was all built out of shipping containers.\n\nI realized there was no way to get a building through the planning board and everything quickly enough — but I could get a shipping container.\n\nI looked at Ben and I said, \"The fastest way we can do this is to get a shipping container.\" And he said, \"Are you kidding?\" I said, \"No.\"\n\nWe really bootstrapped our business from day one. We had a $10,000 investment in building out the space over time. We costed it out, and we could afford it with what we had already made in the business.\n\nWe got our approval and I was so excited. I posted it on our Facebook page and we got over 4,000 interactions. We couldn't not open.\n\nOur first shipping container was a regular shipping container — a 40' by 20' high cube. We placed it on wooden rail ties, which was not great — those degraded over the years, especially with heavy usage.\n\nWe thought of ourselves as scrappy: \"Well, we did the cafe, we can do this ourselves. So why would I pay to have a spray foam? We'll do that ourselves.\" That was terrible idea.\n\nI think we bought every spray foam insulation canister in a 200-mile radius of here from Home Depot and Lowe's. We didn't know what we were doing. We were just trying to figure it out. The walls were uneven and it worked, but it wasn't a great solution.\n\nThen we pushed out of that shipping container and needed even more space. At that point, we needed more cold storage. I started doing more research into shipping containers and came across decommissioned reefers.\n\nThey're pre-insulated and have steel walls. And unlike a regular shipping container that has a wood floor, this has a steel flat floor. So it's already food-ready.\n\nWe bought the first container for $6,000 painted and delivered. And then we spent another couple thousand dollars in spray foam. God only knows how much the labor was, because we did it ourselves and that took forever.\n\nWe have running water and electric in the containers, but most of the mixing happens in our original building.\n\nThat following year, as our business grew and began to quickly scale, we kept outgrowing our space and needing more and more room. Once we saw how quickly we could get a shipping container in place — about a month — it was easy to go, \"OK, well, gee, trucks can double my space in a month.\"\n\nThe second container was much faster and easier to set up. I bought that directly through a broker at the port. We paid $8,500 for that one.\n\nWhen we installed the second container, we leveled the ground, put in concrete pillars, and the cranes came in and moved the original container and did that whole process. Then, with the third container, it was very easy to attach it because the ground was already graded and leveled.\n\nIt cost about $7,500 to $15,000 per container at the end of the day, because we had to get the crane to get them moved, and we had to get them welded together.\n\nIt's always funny when someone comes up to the building for the first time, and they're just like, \"What is this? Where is the bakery?\" And then they knock on a shipping container door.\n\nPeople are always shook to see that it's a real production. They think we're winging this or pretending because there's these shipping containers. But when you walk in, you forget you're in a shipping container.",

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Sam Bail, a data engineer and the founder of the alcohol-free pop-up event company, Bright Nights Social. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nThree years ago, I had the idea to open an alcohol-free bar in New York City.\n\nI don't drink, but I still wanted nightlife — dancing, music, meeting new people, getting out of the house on a Friday or Saturday night. What I didn't want was another alcohol-free space that was centered on wellness, meditation, or yoga. I wanted something that still felt like real nightlife, just without booze being the main event.\n\nInstead of signing a lease, I started testing the idea by hosting pop-up events. I'd take over coffee shops or other venues at night and turn them into alcohol-free bars for the evening.\n\nWhat started as an experiment quickly took on a life of its own.\n\nOver the past three years, I've collaborated with tons of venues, experimented with a variety of new formats, and thousands of people have come through our doors. That's been the most surprising part of all of this: the demand.\n\nWhat's even more interesting? Most of the people who attend my events aren't even sober.\n\nWhen people hear \"alcohol-free event,\" they often assume the crowd is made up entirely of sober or sober-curious people. That hasn't been my experience at all. Based on conversations with guests, I estimate that at least 75% of the people who attend my events don't identify as sober or even sober-curious.\n\nThey're mostly in their mid-20s to early 30s — older Gen Z and very young millennials. Gender splits depend on the event, but many of my parties are close to 50-50 men and women. What they have in common is that they want to go out, socialize, and have fun without making drinking the center of their entire social life.\n\nI'm 40, so I'm an elder millennial who's already done the heavy partying phase and is over it. But many of the people who come to Bright Nights Social are younger than me and feel the same way. They'll tell me things like, \"I still drink sometimes, I just don't want to do it every time I go out,\" or \"Alcohol makes me feel terrible the next day.\"\n\nThey're not abstaining out of moral opposition to alcohol or because of addiction. They're opting out because they don't like the cost, the hangovers, or the way drinking dominates social life in cities like New York.\n\nWhat I see aligns with a broader shift happening right now, especially among younger people. There's a growing focus on experiences rather than just going to a bar and spending money on drinks. In New York City, you can see it everywhere: pottery classes, cooking classes, rug tufting, late-night library events, group reading clubs.\n\nSome of my favorites have been hosting cooking classes and our crafting events, like rug-making. Coming up this month, we have a tea bar, a bagel-making (and eating!) class, and a full-on dance party, complete with DJs and a full non-alcoholic bar, to close out Dry January.\n\nPeople want to do something. They want to make memories. They just don't want to wake up feeling awful the next day.\n\nCost is also a big factor. When cocktails are $15 or $20 each, it doesn't take long for a casual night out to become extremely expensive. A lot of people tell me they'd rather spend their money on an experience than on alcohol that doesn't even make them feel good.\n\nThat doesn't mean Gen Z isn't drinking at all. In fact, some recent data suggests younger people are actually drinking more now than they were a year or two ago. I think part of that is a post-pandemic catch-up effect — many Gen Zers reached legal drinking age during lockdowns and simply didn't have the chance to go out.\n\nWhat I see on the ground is moderation. People might have one drink at dinner and then switch to a nonalcoholic beer. Or they'll alternate between alcoholic and nonalcoholic drinks throughout the night — what some people call \"zebra striping.\" They're being much more intentional about how and when they drink.\n\nAnother huge shift I'm seeing is the role of legal THC. I don't serve THC products at my events, but I don't stop anyone from having one before they come, and I hear about them constantly from guests and friends who work at nonalcoholic bottle shops. THC drinks are some of the best-selling products in those stores.\n\nPeople understand what THC does. They say it helps with social anxiety, takes the edge off, and feels more manageable than alcohol when used in moderation. Compared to that, there's still skepticism around functional or adaptogenic drinks — things with nootropics, ashwagandha, or functional mushrooms. Many people aren't convinced that those drinks actually do anything beyond being a placebo.\n\nThat said, I think we're still early. As people learn what works for their own bodies — whether that's L-theanine, lion's mane, or something else — those functional beverages may gain more traction.\n\nAt the same time, I'm also seeing conversations online about people pulling back from THC after overdoing it, so I think we'll see a similar trend as people try to find nightlife events that best suit their needs.\n\nI don't think most people want to be completely sober forever, but they are actively experimenting with what moderation looks like.\n\nThe biggest misconception about alcohol-free nightlife is that it's boring or restrictive. What I've learned is that people don't want to be told what not to do — they just want more options.\n\nBright Nights Social isn't about sobriety as an identity. It's about creating a space where alcohol isn't the default. You can still dance, flirt, meet strangers, and stay out late. The only difference is that you're not expected to drink to participate.\n\nThe fact that so many non-sober people show up tells me this isn't a niche idea anymore. Alcohol-free nightlife isn't just for people who've quit drinking entirely. It's for anyone who wants to go out — and wake up the next day feeling like themselves.\n\nDo you host or attend alternative nightlife events? Contact this reporter at ktl@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "We took a long, international flight on Singapore Airlines' business class. For my family, the best part was the food, but I had issues with the seat.",
    "fullText": "When I booked a family trip from Copenhagen to Singapore, I knew we were facing a 13-hour overnight flight.\n\nFlying with my husband and our 7-year-old son meant comfort wasn't just a luxury — it was a necessity. So, we splurged on business class, using points to bring the cost down to something we could justify.\n\nHere's what it was like — the highs, the lows, and the key thing that made it worthwhile.\n\nA deal popped up on discount search engine seats.aero that seemed too good to pass up: Singapore Airlines business-class seats from Copenhagen to Singapore, bookable through Air Canada's Aeroplan program, for just 80,000 points per person.\n\nSingapore Airlines has a reputation for having one of the best business-class experiences in the world, and the thought of spending 13 hours in lie-flat comfort — especially with a child — was incredibly appealing.\n\nWe transferred our American Express points to Air Canada and booked the seats, paying only about $100 per person in taxes and fees.\n\nThat flight, which could easily cost over $15,000 for three passengers, cost us just over $300 out of pocket.\n\nWhen we boarded the Airbus A350-900, the first thing I noticed was how wide the seats looked. At about 28 inches wide, there was plenty of room for my husband and me, and our son could stretch out without feeling cramped.\n\nEven better, the seats were equipped with numerous compartments — small storage areas for headphones, snacks, books, and charging devices.\n\nAs a parent, I loved being able to keep things organized instead of digging through one overflowing bag the entire flight.\n\nI loved that you could control the seatback setup either directly on the screen or with a pull-out remote. That flexibility made it simple for all of us to watch what we wanted.\n\nThe complimentary noise-canceling headphones were another highlight. They blocked out the hum of the cabin, allowing me actually to enjoy a movie without distraction.\n\nThe food turned out to be one of the highlights of the flight. I started with stuffed chicken paired with potatoes and mushrooms — a flavorful and surprisingly restaurant-quality dish.\n\nWe also tried the oriental-style braised beef cheek, which was tender and rich.\n\nBeyond the formal meal service, there was also an \"anytime\" menu. At any point during the flight, you could order a sandwich, a bowl of egg-noodle soup, or a variety of small snacks.\n\nWe didn't lean on it this time, but as a parent, I loved knowing it was there in case my son got hungry outside of meal times.\n\nAnother unexpected perk: I was able to order a proper latte in the morning. Usually, I avoid airplane coffee altogether, but this was actually good — smooth, not burnt-tasting, and served with a bit of flair in a real mug.\n\nIt felt like a small luxury, but after hours in the air, it made a big difference.\n\nFor me, one downside was the way the seat converted into a bed.\n\nInstead of just reclining with a button, we had to stand up and have the flight attendant flip our seats over. Not great when you're already half-asleep.\n\nAnd once it was a bed, the surface felt surprisingly firm. Since I have back problems, this was not ideal, and it was challenging to find a comfortable position.\n\nHowever, it was certainly better than sleeping upright.\n\nThe lie-flat seat sort of forces your legs into a diagonal position, which can make it difficult to relax during such a long flight.\n\nMy husband and I both found ourselves shifting around trying to get comfortable.\n\nFor our son, though, it was perfect. The smaller frame of a 7-year-old fit right into the angled nook, and he slept soundly while we tossed and turned.\n\nWould I pay cash for this flight? Probably not — the angled footwell and hard bed weren't quite worth the usual five-figure price tag.\n\nHowever, this flight was absolutely worth spending points on.\n\nThe wide seats, smart storage, strong entertainment system, tasty meals, and polished service all combined to make the journey manageable — especially with a child in tow.\n\nAnd arriving in Singapore rested enough to start exploring right away was the ultimate payoff.",

    "title": "Trump calls to ban Wall Street from buying homes, but industry insiders say the business model has already moved on",
    "description": "Industry insiders say Trump's call to ban big investors is out of sync with how those players actually buy homes.",
    "fullText": "Trump's pledge to upend Wall Street's 15-year push into the market for single-family American homes raised alarms across the real estate investment industry — and skepticism.\n\n\"I'm not concerned about it,\" said Todd Henderson, the head of real estate for the Americas at DWS, an investment firm that has purchased single-family rental homes.\n\nWhile details of Trump's proposal are unknown, Henderson expects that it will eventually exclude institutional buyers who have purchased newly built homes, which have become the focus of much of the single-family rental (SFR) industry.\n\n\"The fear is that large investors are buying single-family homes and that it's taking out of the sales pool and driving up the cost of housing — that's what is driving this discussion,\" Henderson said. \"We're building this stuff and adding it to supply.\"\n\nIn a message on his social media platform Truth Social on Wednesday, Trump said that he was \"immediately taking steps to ban large institutional investors from buying more single-family homes.\"\n\n\"People live in homes, not corporations,\" Trump wrote.\n\nSome analysts, however, suggested that that view was out of step with the institutional SFR industry's contemporary business model, which has shifted away from the inefficient — and politically sensitive practice — of competing against everyday homebuyers to scoop up properties one by one.\n\nInvitation Homes, a public company that is one of the largest owners of SFR homes, \"has almost exclusively moved to acquiring homes from homebuilders rather than on the MLS,\" according to a research note from RBC.\n\n\"AMH's external growth comes from development rather than acquisitions,\" Barclays wrote in a report, referring to American Homes 4 Rent, another large SFR owner.\n\nTrump's announcement caused shares of Invitation Homes and American Homes 4 Rent to fall by about 7% and 9% respectively, according to KBW.\n\nOther major investors, including Blackstone, also saw an impact on share prices. Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust, a non-trade REIT managed by the firm, holds about $11 billion worth of SFR investments totaling about 9% of its portfolio.\n\nJade Rahmani, an analyst at KBW, wrote that the market reaction \"seems excessive and could present a buying opportunity\" in a Wednesday report on the potential ban.\n\nDetails were scant about how Trump's prohibition on Wall Street homebuying would work.\n\nTrump said that he would be \"calling on Congress to codify it\" and that he would \"discuss this topic\" during \"my speech in Davos in two weeks.\"\n\nTrump has walked back policies, such as his tariffs, due to disruptions to the economy and investor concerns.\n\nThe likely need for congressional approval could insert more complexity — and uncertainty — over the process of formalizing an SFR ban.\n\nA Mizuho report said that Republican Sen. Bernie Moreno had proposed a bill to codify Trump's SFR ban, but that it \"doesn't believe\" it will progress \"anytime soon.\"\n\nHenderson said he believes that any rules imposed on the SFR industry would exempt both builders and buyers of new SFR homes and would allow major investors to sell existing portfolios freely. Such caveats would leave the SFR industry basically unchanged.\n\n\"I think it will increase the value of the purpose-built SFR homes and make that strategy even more valuable,\" Henderson said.\n\nThe SFR industry has pointed out that its investors own a comparatively small share of the roughly 80 million single-family homes in the country.\n\nIn October 2023, Parcl Labs found that investors who own 10 residential units or more held about 3.4% of all single-family homes, and that larger investors with at least 1,000 units controlled just 0.73% of the inventory.\n\n\"Professional single-family housing providers represent a small segment of the overall housing market, and the single-family rental industry remains focused on supporting renters while also supporting pathways to homeownership,\" said a spokeswoman for National Rental Home Council, an industry group that represents SFR owners.",

    "fullText": "America’s distilleries have faced a perfect storm of economic and market headwinds that has pushed many out of business in recent years.\n\nFirst, many Americans are drinking less, especially younger ones.\n\n\"Young adults in the U.S. have become progressively less likely to use alcohol over the past two decades, with the percentages of 18- to 34-year-olds saying they ever drink, that they drank in the past week and that they sometimes drink more than they shouldall lower today. At the same time, drinking on all three metrics has trended up among older Americans while holding fairly steady among middle-aged adults,\" according to a Gallup poll.\n\n62% of adults under age 35 say they drink, down from 72% two decades ago.\n\nConversely, drinking has increased among adults aged 55 and older.\n\nYoung adults are also drinking less frequently and are less likely to drink to excess.\n\nIn addition, distilleries continue to feel the effects of tariffs imposed during President Donald Trump’s administration, which have increased production costs and contributed to a sharp drop in U.S. whiskey exports to key markets like the EU.\n\n“We’re very worried about what tariffs could do to our industry,” said Eric Gregory, president of the Kentucky Distillers Association, reported WKYT.\n\nTake those two challenges together, and it's not surprising that American distilleries, including Artisan Distillery & Craft Bar, have decided to close their doors.\n\nThose impacts are already being felt.\n\nAmerican Whiskey exports to the EU, the U.S. spirits industry’s largest export market, have tumbled by 33% and cost $300 million since the EU’s 25% retaliatory tariff went into effect on June 22, 2018, according to a new report released by the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States on the two-year anniversary.\n\nThe EU levied the destructive tariff in response to U.S. tariffs on EU steel and aluminum.\n\n“American distillers enjoyed two decades of unparalleled growth in the EU prior to the implementation of these retaliatory tariffs,” said Chris Swonger, CEO of the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States (DISCUS). “This report makes clear that these tariffs took the wind out of the sails for American Whiskey exports to our top export market, which has resulted in a loss of more than a quarter of a billion dollars of sales.”\n\nArtisan Distillery & Craft Bar became famous for its Spike Vodka, a spirit made with nopal instead of the traditional fermented cereal grains or potatoes. Later, the distillery added gin, whisky, moonshine, and a tequila-like agave liquor and branched out to brewing beer.",

    "description": "I sampled first and business class on the Amtrak NextGen Acela. From the seats to the food and lounge access, here's how the two experiences compared.",
    "fullText": "I spent six hours and $630 on the fastest train in America.\n\nThe Amtrak Acela is the express option for travelers in the Northeast with only business and first-class seating. In August 2025, the route got a fresh new fleet called the NextGen Acela. In addition to a futuristic look and modern amenities, the train has a top speed of 160 miles per hour, making it the fastest train in the US.\n\nIn September 2025, I booked round-trip tickets between my home in New York City and Washington, DC, on the NextGen Acela. I got a taste of both classes.\n\nSince the Acela doesn't have coach seating, business class is the standard ticket.\n\nMy first-class ticket included a meal, priority boarding, attendant service, and lounge access at the train station.\n\nI waited for my business-class train to Washington, DC, on the floor of NYC's Penn Station. The waiting room was full, and it would have cost me $50 to access the Metropolitan Lounge, which is complimentary for first-class passengers.\n\nSince I held a first-class ticket for my ride home from Washington, DC, I had access to the Metropolitan Lounge at Union Station. Other passengers can pay $35 to enter the space.\n\nThe lounge was quiet and calm. There were couches, comfy chairs, tables, and colorful works of art on the walls. I especially appreciated the espresso and beverage station, snack bins stocked with a variety of treats — all of which were complimentary — and the clean bathroom.\n\nAfter relaxing in the lounge, I waltzed into the priority boarding lane for my first-class ride to New York. There were fewer than a dozen people in front of me.\n\nUnlike when I rode in business class, where I was toward the back of a long line, I had several minutes to get situated on board before the train departed.\n\nAboard the Acela train, I quickly caught on that blue meant business class and red meant first class. From the headrests to the bathroom doors, the matching colors made it easy to tell which car I was in.\n\nAnother key difference was the layout. There were two rows of seats on either side of the aisle in business class, while first class had a single row of seats on one side of the aisle.\n\nDuring my business-class ride, I grabbed a bite in the café car, where passengers can purchase grab-and-go meals from a self-service station, as well as snacks, drinks, and quick hot meals prepared by an attendant. I ordered a breakfast sandwich, which I thought tasted pretty decent for a microwaved meal, and brought it back to my seat.\n\nIn first class, I received attendant service and had a menu of complimentary meals to choose from.\n\nI selected the chicken dish, which consisted of a charred thigh paired with roasted squash, verde sauce, a hard roll, and a Key-lime pie in a jar.\n\nIt was the most delicious and satisfying meal I'd ever had on an Amtrak train.\n\nSave for the color of the door, the bathrooms in each class are the same, an Amtrak representative told Business Insider. I was impressed by how clean, spacious, and high-tech they were.\n\nThese bathrooms featured automatic doors, lights to indicate when the space was in use, and ample room to stretch. I also appreciated the touch-free faucets, soap dispensers, and hand dryers.\n\nAfter my back-to-back three-hour journeys on the Amtrak NextGen Acela train, I expected to be thrilled to get off the rails. But my experiences were so comfortable that I was in no rush to exit. When we pulled into NYC's Penn Station, I let other passengers get off first while I soaked up a few more minutes in my first-class seat.",

    "fullText": "Two US Navy destroyers helped American forces chase down, board, and ultimately seize a Russian-flagged oil tanker in the North Atlantic after a weekslong chase across the ocean, a defense official told Business Insider on Thursday.\n\nThe Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyers USS Bulkeley and USS Paul Ignatius \"supported\" the operations to seize the vessel, initially called Bella 1, on Wednesday, the official said.\n\nThe official declined to provide additional details about the warships' role in the seizure, citing operational security concerns.\n\nThe destroyers' involvement in the mission, which also included the Coast Guard and special operations forces, highlights the scale of the US military's efforts to capture the oil tanker, on the run since it evaded a naval blockade. Flight-tracking data showed various aircraft were airborne either shortly before or during the operation.\n\nThe UK government said it supported the operation with a tanker and Royal Air Force surveillance aircraft. A NATO official told Business Insider that the alliance's standing naval forces were not involved.\n\nBella 1, which has been described by the Trump administration as a \"dark fleet\" tanker operating in violation of sanctions, evaded a US naval blockade of sanctioned vessels near Venezuela last month and avoided attempts by the American military to board the vessel.\n\nThe tanker, sailing under the flag of Guyana, then fled north into the Atlantic, reflagged as a Russian vessel, and changed its name to the Marinera. On the run, the crew even painted the country's tricolor on the hull.\n\nThe Coast Guard pursued the tanker for weeks. The unusual chase ended on Wednesday when American forces seized the vessel in waters about halfway between the UK and Iceland.\n\nKaroline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, told reporters that because the vessel had a judicial seizure order, the ship's crew is \"subject to prosecution for any applicable violation of federal law, and they will be brought to the United States for such prosecution if necessary.\"\n\nRussia's foreign ministry condemned the seizure and said that threats to prosecute the tanker's crew \"are entirely unacceptable,\" the state-owned news agency Tass reported on Thursday.\n\nSeparately, the US military said that it seized another sanctioned tanker — M/T Sophia — near the Caribbean Sea on Wednesday after it was \"conducting illicit activities\" in the region.\n\nThe back-to-back interdictions mark the latest in a string of vessel seizures that have occurred since the US announced last month that a naval blockade on sanctioned oil tankers trying to enter or leave Venezuela was going into effect.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the two tankers that were seized on Wednesday had either \"last docked\" in Venezuela or were sailing to the country.\n\n\"The United States continues to enforce the blockade against all dark fleet vessels illegally transporting Venezuelan oil to finance illicit activity, stealing from the Venezuelan people,\" Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said on Wednesday after the operations. \"Only legitimate and lawful energy commerce — as determined by the US — will be permitted.\"\n\nThe US naval blockade was set up as part of a pressure campaign against Venezuela's former president, Nicolás Maduro, whom the US had long accused of facilitating drug trafficking and other criminal activity, allegations he denies.\n\nThe campaign also included a massive US military buildup in the Caribbean that began in August. American forces carried out dozens of airstrikes on alleged drug boats over the following months, as President Donald Trump threatened to take action against Venezuela.\n\nTensions between Trump and Maduro culminated over the weekend, when the US staged a dramatic surprise operation to capture Maduro. American forces who raided his compound in Caracas were supported by more than 150 military aircraft.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump has threatened additional action against other countries near Venezuela, including Colombia, Cuba, and Mexico.",

    "description": "Trump targeted two sectors in his latest attacks: single-family homes and defense contractors.",
    "fullText": "Home is where the heart is, but not where the institutional investors are.\n\nAt least, that's President Donald Trump's proposed plan. In a post on Truth Social, he said he's \"immediately\" taking steps to ban large institutional investors from buying single-family homes.\n\n\"People live in homes, not corporations,\" Trump wrote.\n\nIt was one of two attacks the president issued on the business world. The other targeted a group familiar with crosshairs: defense contractors.\n\nTrump said he would \"not permit\" defense companies to issue dividends or do stock buybacks until they sped up production. He also criticized industry executives' \"exorbitant and unjustifiable\" compensation packages.\n\nBlackstone, a large institutional investor in residential real estate, and defense contractors Northrop Grumman and Raytheon Technologies were among the companies that saw their share prices immediately drop following the posts.\n\nFor Trump, it's in line with a new form of capitalism he's ushered in during his second term. One with more government involvement in the private sector, including taking individual stakes in companies, as BI's Emily Stewart previously covered. (You can also see my ugly mug discussing the idea here.)\n\nIt's a topic we're focusing on this year at BI with our series, \"The Future of Capitalism.\"\n\nThe intention behind Trump's latest attacks seems squarely focused on his biggest opponent these days: affordability.\n\nFrom houses to groceries to everything in between, rising prices have been a real thorn in Trump's side. The president has maintained he inherited these problems from his predecessor, but that hasn't softened the blow for some Americans.\n\nOn paper, going after institutional investors in the housing market is the perfect antidote. The real-estate market has been a mess the past few years, and frustrated home buyers love to blame Wall Street.\n\nIn reality, it's not that clear-cut, as BI's James Rodriguez has previously reported.\n\nOne analysis from October 2023 found investors with at least 1,000 units in their portfolio owned just 0.73% of all single-family homes in the US. However, regions like the southeast have a more concentrated number of institutional investors.\n\nStill, the housing shortage is more likely the reason you can't find, or afford, your dream home. Trump didn't mention anything about institutional investors having to sell the houses they already own. And even if you want to, you can't really yell at boomers to start selling theirs.",

    "description": "Moving to Europe was life-changing for Natalie Lynch. While her move has been mostly positive, it has come with a couple of downsides.",
    "fullText": "Like many Americans, Natalie Lynch had a wake-up call during the pandemic. She'd been working since she was 15, and after decades in real estate — first as a home stager and later as an agent — she was burned out, lonely, and desperate for a change.\n\nIn 2021, she sold her home in Oakland, California. A few years later, she sold the home-staging business she'd owned for 24 years. But the high cost of living in the Bay Area was still draining her savings, and she was unsatisfied.\n\n\"I honestly never thought that I would leave,\" Lynch, 56, told Business Insider. But after four decades, she did. \"I just didn't find it sustainable anymore.\"\n\nIn 2024, Lynch traded the American dream for Europe, packing up her life and moving with her dog, Enzo, to Italy. They spent a couple of months traveling the coast before heading to Spain, and ultimately settled in Audenge, a small town in southwestern France near Arcachon Bay, along the Bordeaux coast.\n\n\"It was a huge leap to push myself out of my comfort zone,\" Lynch said. \"I had owned my home for 17 years and was surrounded by a great support system of friends and neighbors, but I was in search of a new life.\"\n\nHere are Lynch's five pros and cons of starting a new life in a foreign country.\n\nAfter selling her Oakland home, Lynch was renting a 1,000-square-foot 1980s condo for $3,000 a month in California. Now in Audenge, she's renting a fully furnished duplex that comes with a small pool for €1,200 a month, which is about $1,400, including utilities.\n\nShe said her monthly budget in Audenge for food and other day-to-day expenses is about $1,000. Roughly $600 goes toward recurring costs, including car insurance, storage for her belongings in Antwerp, Belgium, and services like her phone plan and Netflix.\n\n\"Life is definitely more affordable here compared to California,\" she said.\n\nUnlike couples who move abroad together, Lynch doesn't have a built-in companion other than Enzo.\n\nShe has to go out of her way to make connections, whether through expat groups on social media or simply by walking to her local café or restaurant.\n\n\"It's definitely doable, but in the beginning, it's definitely lonely by yourself,\" she said. \"I think it's because I haven't settled anywhere yet.\"\n\n\"I think it's the same with any move to any place,\" she added. \"You need to get established and start meeting people. I've definitely made some great friends in my travels, but they're just not all in one place.\"\n\nLynch said Europeans rely far less on credit, aren't flashy with luxury cars, and tend to be more modest about their appearance.\n\n\"People here are less focused on the small stuff, and more focused on quality of life and living within their means,\" she said.\n\n\"In California, I was surrounded by Teslas. I was getting my hair dyed every four weeks, getting gel nails, and spending an obligatory $300 every time I went to Target,\" she added. \"Here, women are aging gracefully, and it's a relief. You see a lot more silver hair and little to no fillers.\"\n\nShe said it has made it easier to be intentional about how she spends her money.\n\nA big challenge for many expats or migrants is navigating another country's bureaucracy. Imagine going to the DMV in a place where you don't speak the language — or trying to apply for residency or health coverage without knowing where to go or who to talk to.\n\n\"A lot of people, including French people, say the bureaucracy is especially complicated here,\" Lynch said. \"I haven't had too much experience with it, except when I tried to register my dog, Enzo.\"\n\nShe said she accidentally left out required documents for Enzo's registration and got a curt email from the official processing the paperwork, which left a bad taste in her mouth.\n\nBack in California, Lynch's typical day running her home-staging business began around 8 a.m. with calls about problems she needed to solve, and it sometimes ended around 10 p.m. with more phone calls.\n\n\"When you work at a certain stress level — and a lot of people do — it just becomes normal,\" she said. \"You deal with it, but it's not good for our nervous systems at all. Being in Europe, in general, has reset my nervous system back to baseline.\"\n\nWith lower living costs and no job, Lynch said she no longer feels like she's working just to survive. These days, she can wake up when she wants, and she often spends her free time taking Enzo on small day trips to nearby towns.\n\n\"I feel way less stressed,\" she said. Her biggest worries now are taking care of Enzo and figuring out where she'll live next when her lease is up.",

    "title": "Tailwind lays off 75% of its 4-person engineering team, citing 'brutal impact AI has had on our business'",
    "description": "Tailwind's CEO said that while AI made the web tool more popular, it also led to cratering revenue and difficulty converting paid users.",
    "fullText": "Tailwind laid off 75% of the startup's engineering staff on Monday — and its CEO blames AI.\n\n\"75% of the people on our engineering team lost their jobs here yesterday because of the brutal impact AI has had on our business,\" CEO Adam Wathan wrote in a GitHub comment that has made waves in the tech community.\n\nTailwind, like many startups, has a small head count. In a podcast posted on X, Wathan said that the company had four engineers on staff. Now, there's one.\n\nWathan's post highlights the challenges that startups, which already face tough odds of success, can encounter as AI models grow more capable.\n\nThe CEO founded the web developer tool in 2017. Tailwind's model is free and open-source, with a paid \"pro\" tier driving the company's revenue. In his GitHub comment, Wathan wrote that AI was making Tailwind more popular, but slimming its base of paid customers.\n\nTraffic to Tailwind's online documentation has seen a 40% decrease, Wathan wrote. Those resources were where people learned about the paid tier, the CEO wrote, crushing its ability to make money. Revenue is down 80%, he added.\n\nThe remaining team after the layoffs is the three owners, one engineer, and one part-time employee, the CEO said. \"That's all the resources we have,\" he said.\n\n🎧 Recorded a new morning walk this morning, hard one to share because I'm sure people will want to roast me for it but have been transparent up until now so publishing it anyways. pic.twitter.com/lslaLp2gtf\n\nWathan said he spent the holidays forecasting revenue and realized that the situation was \"significantly worse than I realized.\" The decline in revenue has occurred over several years, Wathan said, but it was gradual. If nothing changed, Wathan said his forecasting showed that Tailwind would not be able to meet payroll in six months.\n\nThe layoffs were a \"brutal decision,\" Wathan said. \"If we didn't do it now, then we we not be able to give people generous severance packages,\" he said.\n\n\"I feel like a failure for having to do it,\" Wathan said. \"It's not good.\"\n\nTailwind is popular among developers, and Wathan's post sparked reactions from the tech community on social media, some of which blamed the CEO for the company's revenue decline.\n\nOne X user wrote that they had only received five promotional emails from Tailwind in 2025. \"We don't send enough email,\" Wathan responded. \"Definitely need to get better at it.\"\n\nAnother X user wrote that Tailwind relied on a business model of selling UI components, while free and AI-generated equivalents grew.\n\n\"Still to this day don't know what we should be pivoting to, so in the mean time it's only made sense to do what's at least working a little,\" Wathan responded.\n\nIn his podcast, Wathan said that 90% of people understood and didn't \"pile on,\" but others did. He carried the burden that, as an employer, the world \"hates you and thinks you're evil,\" he said.\n\nOthers voiced their support online. Dropbox and Groupon alum Josh Puckett called the podcast an \"incredibly raw, honest take from one of our industry's best on the realities of running a business in the midst of the creative destruction AI is bringing.\"\n\nAI's ability to summarize and extract information, sometimes without directing users to specific sites or documents, is threatening many businesses reliant on online traffic. The media industry is well aware of this, as a crop of startups has formed around the concept of \"Google Zero.\"\n\nThat's basically what happened to Tailwind. It needed traffic to convert free users into paying customers, its CEO said, and AI effectively crushed that traffic. Still, Wathan remains hopeful for the company's future.\n\n\"I'm still optimistic,\" he said in his podcast. \"My job requires me to be optimistic.\"",

    "fullText": "Izzy Englander's Millennium, which recently sold off a 15% stake of the firm, has just lost its head of corporate strategy.\n\nAlexander Campbell, Millennium's head of corporate strategy since 2017, is exiting the firm, according to two people familiar with the move. Millennium declined to comment, while Campbell did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nCampbell joined the hedge fund in 2015 and held a strategy role throughout his entire career at Millennium, joining the firm when it managed $27 billion in assets and leaving when it had more than $83 billion. A person close to the manager described his role as working on various projects related to the organization's priorities at any given time.\n\nMillennium has undergone tremendous growth over the past decade. In November, it hit a unique milestone for a hedge fund by selling a 15% stake of the firm to investors in a sale that valued the firm at $14 billion. The firm has also made plans to launch private market funds and continues to add teams globally.\n\nA graduate of the University of Pennsylvania, Campbell worked at Vanguard before going to business school at the University of Chicago and then joining BCG for five years, according to his LinkedIn profile.\n\nHe is a part of the growing group of professionals who work at the biggest hedge funds but do not manage any money. As firms like Millennium have become more institutional, the non-investing side of the business has expanded its headcounts.\n\nRegulatory filings show that a majority of Millennium's 6,000-plus employees do not work in an investing role. These non-investing roles include technologists, recruiters, fundraisers, compliance officers, lawyers, and other staff, such as strategy and operations personnel.\n\nBusiness Insider mapped the dozens of executives who make up Englander's management web in 2024 (Campbell was not among them) and detailed how alums from the executive ranks of the biggest managers, such as Millennium, Citadel, and Point72, are building the next wave of hedge funds.",

    "description": "The NC-13 strike company's commander told Business Insider that the drone's primary objective was to suppress Russian troops from advancing for weeks.",
    "fullText": "A Ukrainian commander said his troops used a single remote-controlled vehicle with a machine gun to hold frontline areas for nearly six straight weeks.\n\nDetails about the 45-day combat mission were provided exclusively to Business Insider by the NC-13 Strike Company, a unit within Ukraine's Third Army Corps that specializes in uncrewed ground vehicles, or UGVs.\n\n\"Only the UGV system was present at the position,\" said NC-13's commander, Mykola \"Makar\" Zinkevych. \"This was the core concept — robots do not bleed.\"\n\nA lone ground drone deployed so extensively signals both how quickly the technology is evolving in Ukraine and how Kyiv may soon look to deploy such vehicles at scale in combat. UGVs, although still seeing limited use compared to flying attack drones, are gaining popularity for their potential to replace human soldiers in holding frontline areas, which is one of the war's most dangerous tasks.\n\nThe gun-wielding drone used by Zinkevych's troops was the Droid TW 12.7, developed by the Ukrainian company DevDroid. It is a remote-controlled tracked buggy equipped with a .50-caliber M2 Browning.\n\nZinkevych said the Droid TW 12.7 was deployed to multiple positions during its 45-day combat duty, each time at the request of a command and observation post in the local fighting area.\n\n\"Requests were received regularly,\" the commander said.\n\nThe drone's primary objective was to \"deliver fire damage and fire suppression against the enemy,\" to discourage Russian troops from trying to advance in areas held by Ukraine, said Zinkevych.\n\nThe Droid TW 12.7 would briefly leave its post every two days to be serviced, Zinkevych said, by a Ukrainian drone crew sheltering about 4 kilometers, or 2.4 miles, away from the line of contact.\n\nAccording to the commander, technical maintenance took about four hours each time, including weapons servicing, restocking the drone's ammo, and recharging its battery.\n\n\"To speed up the inspection process, over time we purchased additional battery packs at our own expense, which reduced the maintenance time to 2 hours,\" Zinkevych said. Ukrainian troops regularly spend their own salaries or savings on matériel.\n\nDevDroid says that its Droid TW 12.7 has an operational range of up to 15 miles and is controlled via a radio signal, but that the drone can use artificial intelligence to set its own course automatically. The extent to which it can autonomously navigate the battlefield and engage in combat is still unclear.\n\nThe Third Army Corps posted a video in December of the drone firing at an off-camera target.\n\nTwo versions of the ground drone with grenade launchers — the Mk-19 and AGL-53 40mm — were also approved last month by Ukraine for official military use.\n\nZinkevych said that his company, created in September 2025 under the Third Assault Brigade, is focusing this year on the \"maximum involvement\" and wider-scale use of UGVs in combat for both defensive and assault missions.\n\n\"The demand for these systems is indeed high,\" he said.\n\nBut Zinkevych said the process will be resource-intensive, and that his company runs a crowdfunding effort to continue developing its ground drones for combat.\n\n\"Today, we believe this is the most cost-effective investment,\" he added.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump took a big swing at business on Wednesday — saying he would put a stop to practices he deemed undesirable at defense firms and large housing investors.\n\nIn a series of posts on Truth Social, the president said he wants to ban \"large institutional investors\" from buying single-family homes in the US. He also criticized defense firms' issuing dividends, stock buybacks, and \"exorbitant\" pay packages — and called out Raytheon by name. The market reacted quickly: Shares for private equity firm Blackstone and defense stocks dropped immediately following Trump's posts.\n\nWednesday evening, Trump issued an executive order aimed at defense firms, stating, \"Effective immediately, they are not permitted in any way, shape, or form to pay dividends or buy back stock, until such time as they are able to produce a superior product, on time and on budget.\"\n\nIt's the latest example of Trump taking steps to insert himself into business, having taken equity stakes in several companies over the last year. (See Business Insider's new series on \"The Future of Capitalism.)\n\nMany housing economists agree that banning large investors from buying or owning single-family homes would likely do little nationally to improve housing affordability, which has deteriorated in large part because of a shortage of homes. \n\n\"If we actually wanted to solve that problem, bringing down the cost of home ownership, what we should be doing is increasing the supply of housing,\" Daryl Fairweather, the chief economist at Redfin, told Business Insider.\n\nBusiness Insider's James Rodriguez has reported that, despite being the \"villains\" of the housing market, large investors don't actually own a significant portion of America's homes.\n\nIn October 2023, Parcl Labs found that investors with at least 10 units in their portfolio owned roughly 3.4% of all single-family homes in the country. Big investors with at least 1,000 units — a group that includes major companies such as AMH Homes, Invitation Homes, Tricon Residential, and Pretium — owned just 0.73% of units.\n\nThat share is much higher in certain housing markets, particularly in the southeast.\n\nIt's unclear if Trump will be able to stop future payouts from defense firms. The one he singled out, Raytheon, for example, announced a $10 billion buyback plan in 2023, and said it has paid a dividend every year since 1936.\n\nIn his posts, Trump said Raytheon \"has been the least responsive,\" \"the slowest,\" and the \"most aggressive spending on their Shareholders rather than the needs and demands of the United States Military.\"\n\nOf defense firms overall, he said that until they build \"NEW and MODERN Production Plants\" their executives' pay should be capped at $5 million.",

    "description": "Amazon updates its performance review system to require corporate employees share specific work achievements.",
    "fullText": "Amazon has a new question for its corporate workforce: What did you get done last year?\n\nAs part of this year's performance review process, known internally as Forte, Amazon is asking corporate employees to submit three to five \"accomplishments\" that best reflect their work, according to people familiar with the matter and an internal guideline obtained by Business Insider.\n\nEmployees are required to provide \"specific examples\" of what they delivered, along with actions they plan to take to continue growing at the company, the guideline added.\n\n\"Accomplishments are specific projects, goals, initiatives, or process improvements that show the impact of your work,\" the internal guideline states. \"Consider situations where you took risks or innovated, even if it didn't lead to the results you hoped for.\"\n\nThis marks the first time Amazon has explicitly formalized Forte around individual accomplishments, according to the people. They asked not to be identified discussing internal matters.\n\nWhile the company has long included a self-assessment component, past reviews asked employees broader questions about their \"super powers,\" areas of interest, and questions like, \"When you're at your best, how do you contribute?\" An Amazon spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nForte is a key driver of employee compensation. Managers also consider peer feedback, adherence to Amazon's Leadership Principles, and job-specific skills to assign an \"Overall Value\" rating, which determines annual pay.\n\nThe move reflects Amazon CEO Andy Jassy's continued push to build a more disciplined workforce and a more unified corporate culture. Last year, he enforced a full return-to-office policy, cut management layers, and overhauled Amazon's pay model and performance review process to more clearly reward top performers.\n\nThis is part of a broader change in how tech companies treat employees. After years of mollycoddling talent, the industry has become tougher. Elon Musk started this in 2022, by demanding to know what Twitter employees accomplished each week. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg followed suit with his year of intensity. Even Google has toughened up.\n\nSome teams at Amazon, including the advertising and the IMDb video units, began pilot-testing a similar Forte question a few years ago. At the time, advertising chief Paul Kotas told employees that sharing specific accomplishments \"helps facilitate a more productive\" conversation with managers.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump singled out Raytheon on Wednesday in his sweeping criticism of the defense industry, threatening to cut the company's government contracts if it didn't invest \n\nTrump called out Raytheon by name after earlier saying he wouldn't allow defense firms to do buybacks or pay dividends until they speed up production. The president said Raytheon has been \"the least responsive\" to the government's needs, slow in increasing volume, and has prioritized returning capital to shareholders over the military's priorities.\n\n\"Either Raytheon steps up, and starts investing in more upfront Investment like Plants and Equipment, or they will no longer be doing business with\" the government, Trump said in a Truth Social post.\n\nA spokesperson for RTX Corporation, formerly known as Raytheon, did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. The company rebranded as RTX in 2023 following a merger with United Technologies Corporation.\n\nEarlier in the day, Trump fired a broadside at the entire defense industry, posting on Truth Social that he would \"not permit\" further stock buybacks or dividends to be issued to shareholders. Trump also said that until defense companies build \"NEW and MODERN Production Plants\" their executives' pay should be capped at $5 million.\n\nLike its competitors, shares of RTX dropped after Trump's initial post about the industry. RTX rebounded in early after-hours trading, trending up more than 3% as of 6 p.m. ET.\n\nIt's unclear why Trump singled out Raytheon in particular. The company has a history of returning capital to shareholders. Raytheon announced a $10 billion buyback plan in 2023 and says it has paid a dividend every year since 1936.\n\nLast year, the company paid out a dividend in March. It's unclear if Trump's statement will affect those plans or even the extent to which a president could prohibit a publicly traded company from fulfilling its previously declared financial obligations.\n\nTrump has frequently used the presidential bully pulpit to criticize companies and their CEOs. In August 2025, Trump called for Intel to fire its CEO Lip-Bu Tan, only to later change his stance after the US government acquired a roughly 10% stake in the chipmaker.\n\nIt is less common for Trump to directly threaten a company's government contracts, although he has done so as well.\n\nIn July 2025, Trump threatened to cut off Elon Musk's companies from government contracts during a heated back-and-forth with the world's richest person. Since then, Trump has reconciled with the billionaire.",

    "description": "Ethan Spibey, 33, quit his director-level job in London to move to Barcelona, where he runs his own business. He asked himself: \"if not now, when?\"",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Ethan Spibey, 33, a consultant who lives in Barcelona. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nTwice a month, I commute from Barcelona to London: landing at around 10 a.m. on Tuesday morning and catching the 6 p.m. flight back on Wednesday.\n\nIt sounds like a hassle, but waking up in one of the world's most amazing cities instead of an unremarkable London suburb is worth an extra hour or two of commuting each month.\n\nI spent a year in Barcelona in 2013 while studying economics and Spanish as part of my four-year degree in the UK. I loved everything about the city: the food, the culture, the beaches. Plus, it's relatively affordable, the people are beautiful, and the weather is amazing. I knew it was only a matter of time before I went back.\n\nAfter I graduated in 2014 and started my career in London, I returned to Barcelona almost every year.\n\nIt showed me how easy the journeys were and that commuting between the UK and Spain was viable. There were multiple flights a day, and return tickets typically cost around £60 ($80) compared to £130 ($174) for my monthly railcard in London.\n\nLife is also much better value in Barcelona than in London. At the restaurant beneath our apartment, it is hard to spend more than £35 on a meal for two, and coffees cost roughly half what we paid in London.\n\nBut years passed, and I still hadn't made the move.\n\nI don't plan to have children, so I didn't have the usual excuses for choosing stability over risk.\n\nAside from my husband and family, striving for independence was the thing that mattered to me most. Relocating to another country felt like the single most independent — and thrilling — thing I could do with my life.\n\nIn the summer of 2024, my husband and I committed to moving to Barcelona.\n\nThen came the question of what to do about work.\n\nAs a self-employed stock trader, my husband could work from anywhere. I knew I couldn't move to Barcelona with my job because of their policies and the tax implications. That left me with two options: finding a new role with a Spanish employer or starting my own business.\n\nQuitting my job and launching a UK-based consultancy while living mostly in Spain felt exciting and made the most sense, because I could still leverage my UK-based network.\n\nAt the end of 2024, I left my job and launched Born Advisory, a communications business that provides bespoke training to CEOs to help them connect more effectively with people through interviews and public speaking. I named it Born Advisory, after my favourite neighbourhood in Barcelona, El Born.\n\nGetting a visa was slow but straightforward because I'm married to a German and therefore qualified for a spousal visa. Because Germany and Spain are both in the European Union, citizens can live and work freely across member states. Without that route, I would have needed an entrepreneurial or digital nomad visa, both of which are harder to secure.\n\nMy visa was approved in 2025 after more than six months of waiting.\n\nWhen I travel to London for meetings, I usually stay with friends, but I can also book a budget hotel room for about £100 when necessary. As a business expense, it's negligible.\n\nThe mental health benefits far outweigh any cost or inconvenience. The opportunity to recalibrate my life was far more important to me than the stability and predictability of a job.\n\nMy clients say they are very happy with me, and I think that's because I'm so much more personally invested in my work than I was when I was just taking home a salary.\n\nUltimately, in 2024, I asked myself, \"If not now, when?\" You can make excuses for years, but life is short. I'm glad I eventually made the decision to relocate.\n\nThis is the first time I've taken absolute responsibility for what I want to do with my life — and it has turned out to be the most refreshing and invigorating decision I've ever made.",

    "description": "McKinsey chief Bob Sternfels said AI had led to a shift in its workforce, with half the business adding jobs and the other half shrinking.",
    "fullText": "McKinsey's top executive shared some hard numbers on how AI is reshaping the consulting giant's workforce.\n\nBob Sternfels, McKinsey's global managing partner, appeared at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas on Tuesday for a live taping of the \"All-In\" podcast with co-host Jason Calacanis and Hemant Taneja, CEO of General Catalyst.\n\nSternfels said AI has fundamentally changed how McKinsey staffs its business, allowing it to add and cut jobs in equal measure while still achieving overall growth.\n\nReferring to it as the \"25 squared\" approach, Sternfels said McKinsey is growing its client-facing roles — what you typically picture when you think of a McKinsey consultant — by 25%. At the same time, he said non-client-facing roles, which make up the other half of its workforce, have shrunk by about 25% while output from that side has grown 10%.\n\n\"Our model has always been synonymous that growth only occurs with total head count growth. Now it's actually splitting. We can grow in this part, the client-facing side, and we can shrink in this part and have aggregate growth in total,\" he said. \"That's a new paradigm and a new dynamic.\"\n\nSternfels said the firm has seen massive productivity gains as it's embraced AI, saving 1.5 million hours in search and synthesis work last year alone. Instead of doing the work that's typically done by more junior employees, he said McKinsey consultants are \"moving up the stack\" and tackling more complicated problems.\n\nMcKinsey employees also have a brand new set of coworkers that are increasingly becoming an essential part of the company: AI agents, which can act independently like digital employees. Sternfels said that as of last week, the company had 40,000 human employees and 25,000 personalized agents. Sternfels said AI agents are able to handle entire job functions on their own.\n\nHe expects McKinsey to have about the same number of AI agents as human employees by the end of the year.\n\nFor young professionals coming into the workforce, Sternfels said they should think about honing skills that AI can't do, setting the right aspirations, human judgment, and true creativity.\n\nBusiness Insider has previously reported on how AI is disrupting consulting and changing the ways firms like McKinsey make money, including by shifting to an outcome-based pricing model.\n\nThe workforce changes at McKinsey also reflect a broader challenge facing large, established companies as AI disrupts how we work.\n\n\"This is about how do you transform incumbent entities into something different,\" he said at CES, adding that for large existing enterprises \"you have a choice — transform or die.\"\n\nHe added that companies are \"moving at literally warp speed now.\"\n\n\"I haven't met a CEO yet that isn't talking about 'how do I get my organization moving faster,'\" he's said. \"It's quite frankly less about strategy, it's more about organizational speed.\"",

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Amy Errett, the founder and CEO of Madison Reed. Errett is based in Northern California and founded the hair care company in 2013. Since then, Madison Reed has grown to 90 locations across the country. This story has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nLife as a CEO is busy, and I start my days early with exercise, meditation, and a strong cup of coffee, before I jump into a morning of back-to-back meetings.\n\nI'm very disciplined about how I work and communicate, but I try to keep time for thinking and being outside, especially at the end of the week.\n\nIn the evenings, I slow down with family, simple rituals, and sleep, so I can do it all again the next day.\n\nThe first thing I do when I wake up is check my phone to make sure nothing urgent happened overnight, especially since I'm on the West Coast.\n\nMy wife, Claire, is a professional artist and also a professional chef. I'm lucky — I get a home-cooked meal almost every night. That's also why I have to weigh myself every morning before I exercise or drink anything. I also track my sleep and stress using an Oura Ring.\n\nWithin about 45 minutes of waking up, I work out at home using my Peloton and Tonal. Five days a week, I do 30 minutes of cardio and 15 minutes of strength training.\n\nAfterward, I meditate for about 10 minutes using Henry Shukman's app, The Way.\n\nI travel a lot, but for three days, I work from home. At my home in Marin County, I work from a small pod, a 110-square-foot room in my backyard — made in Canada — that is my private workspace. I'm a nature person, and being surrounded by grass and trees is like getting plugged into an energy source.\n\nI also have a condo in San Francisco, which I go back and forth between.\n\nBefore I start work, I make a coffee with two regular shots and two decaf and bring it with me, along with water.\n\nMy workdays are highly structured. I have weekly one-on-one meetings with everyone who reports directly to me, always at the same time each week. Those blocks are fixed, and everything else gets scheduled around them.\n\nMy assistant, Christina, is essential to keeping my schedule running. We meet three times a week and plan weeks in advance.\n\nMy meetings include internal check-ins, conversations with the PR team, and external meetings. I also mentor other women investors. I've been on the board of my alma mater, Wharton, so there are sometimes external board meetings, and my own board meetings.\n\nI also personally interview every hire at the level of store general manager or above for 15 minutes before they receive an offer.\n\nThese interviews are focused entirely on cultural fit. I always ask one question: \"Tell me about something that didn't go well in your life, and what you learned from it.\"\n\nI'm looking for resilience, grit, honesty, love, and passion. Some of the answers I hear — about loss, hardship, or perseverance — stop me in my tracks and tell me who someone really is. I've had people tell me they are homeless and worked their way up to being a general manager somewhere else. That 15-minute process adds up, but it's incredibly important to me.\n\nI'm a protein loader, especially since losing a significant amount of weight. I aim to eat about 90 to 100 grams of protein a day. Cottage cheese is my best friend — it's high in protein, relatively low in calories, and keeps me full.\n\nMy go-to meal is a bowl of cottage cheese topped with a poached egg and a slice of gluten-free toast. I also allow myself one small indulgence: three days a week, I have a mini Coke Zero in the afternoon.\n\nI've tried to work with my assistant to carve out blocks of uninterrupted thinking time, but the truth is, I don't get much of it.\n\nMost days are packed back-to-back. I do, however, protect Fridays: I don't take meetings after 1 p.m., and that's when I catch up and think more freely.\n\nMy best thinking happens outside. I live near Marin, so I hike often.\n\nOn Fridays, I'll often leave right at 1 p.m. and drive to my boat alone. I don't talk to anyone — I just cruise, sit with my thoughts, and enjoy the scenery. Sometimes a close friend will join me, but most of the time it's solo.\n\nDuring the rest of the week, though, I'm extremely disciplined about communication.\n\nMy inbox is always at zero, and I respond quickly across email, Slack, text, and phone. I actually like calling people, even though most people don't — I think there's a lost art in picking up the phone and having a real conversation.\n\nIt's not always easy to stay on track — especially with such a tight schedule.\n\nThis work is personal to me. I'm putting my energy into it, and so are more than 1,100 other people. When something doesn't feel good — we didn't do right by someone, or we got turned down — I feel it deeply.\n\nI've gotten better at handling those moments over time. I work with an executive coach over Zoom twice a week. That's helped me understand what triggers me and how to recover more quickly. I still have emotional reactions — I'm very human — but I don't stay stuck in them the way I used to.\n\nWhen I feel overwhelmed now, I step outside and take a walk or just pause and take a breath. That reset helps me come back grounded.\n\nIt took a long time to get there, but it works.\n\nMost evenings, I like to unwind by watching sports. I follow several teams, record every game, and have access to all the streaming platforms, so there's almost always something on.\n\nDinner is an important part of my evening. My wife, Claire, and I sit down to eat together every night, usually around 6:15 pm. Before we eat, we say a blessing, and then we do \"roses and thorns,\" where we each share one good thing and one hard thing from the day. We've kept that tradition going since our daughter, Madison, who I named the company after, was young.\n\nAfter dinner, we'll usually watch something together. I tend to gravitate toward sports and thrillers, while Claire and our daughter have different tastes. Our dog, London, is usually right by my side.\n\nI try to be in bed by 10 p.m. and asleep by 10:30. I use a Hatch sound machine and an Eight Sleep mattress — both are game changers.",

    "fullText": "My clearest memory from middle school is pacing in my bedroom, phone in hand, repeating the word 'wake' again and again. I was testing a voice app I had written. If I said the phrase just right, the app would respond. If not, I would tweak the code and try again.\n\nI had just learned to code from YouTube. My apps were getting downloads, and I was addicted. I would run home from school, drop my backpack, and open the reviews before starting my homework. It was the first time I saw that code written alone in my bedroom could reach people I would never meet.\n\nAfter studying engineering and business at UC, Berkeley, and spending nearly two years working at Meta, I'm now running Frontdesk, an AI startup that helps businesses automate millions of conversations with AI.\n\nMy early programming projects were playful. I built a text-to-speech app and a speech-to-text app. Then, one of my relatives slipped and fell at home. He was yelling for help, but nobody was home, and his phone was out of reach. If his phone had been able to hear him, it could've brought him help immediately.\n\nIn 2016, I developed Rescuer, a voice app that enabled users to trigger an alarm by shouting a secret phrase, automatically sending their location, photos, and audio to designated emergency contacts.\n\nRescuer earned recognition from political officials and the press. What mattered more was that I learned that code written from my bedroom could help someone. From then on, I began building for real impact.\n\nI started answering questions on coding forums, recording YouTube coding tutorials, and writing for an engineering blog. Over time, my answers on forums like Stack Overflow reached millions of developers, which only deepened my passion for continuous learning.\n\nThere was still one thing I couldn't figure out, no matter how many downloads my apps received. I didn't know how to turn an app into a real business. I didn't understand pricing, customers, or why some products became companies while others remained weekend projects.\n\nAs I was deciding where to attend college, I knew I wanted to learn about the business side.\n\nI chose UC Berkeley's M.E.T. program because I could study both engineering and business. I graduated with an EECS (electrical engineering & computer science) and business degree in three years.\n\nIn 2023, when ChatGPT had its big moment, I asked myself, What if I could just talk to this thing on a real phone line?\n\nOver a weekend, I hacked together one of the first prototypes that connected ChatGPT to a real phone number. I posted a short clip and a tweet, and it got a lot of attention.\n\nThe tech was not ready to be a real product. Latency was bad. Reliability was fragile. The models made strange errors. But that experiment planted a question in my mind that I could not shake: If this ever became good enough, what would it look like to use it to help real businesses?\n\nI shelved my phone experiment to join Meta. It was a dream setup. My team was incredibly supportive, I was learning how to build at a massive scale, and life was good — from the smart colleagues to the famous free food.\n\nI was part of a fintech team where I'd push one line of code, and millions of transactions would be affected. It felt less like a corporation and more like a high-growth startup; I was given incredible ownership from day one and learned \n\nBut I was spending all my time behind the code. The business side, the part I'd learned to love at Berkeley, felt far away. As an engineer at a big company, there was no clear path back to the center.\n\nI wasn't working directly on AI, but I could sense the momentum building. Every few months, the models improved noticeably. My ChatGPT phone hack stopped feeling like a viral stunt and started to feel like a glimpse of the future.\n\nAfter my post went viral in college, hundreds of businesses reached out, asking for a solution. I kept thinking about all those businesses, where a missed call meant a missed customer. I knew there was demand, I knew nobody was serving them, and I knew I wanted to be the one to build it.\n\nLeaving wasn't easy. Meta was comfortable, offering an incredible salary, stock refreshers, and interesting problems. Everyone told me to stay another year, vest more equity, and build more credentials. The rational move was to wait.\n\nI kept asking myself, if I waited, would I regret it? The window felt finite. Every month I stayed was a month these businesses were not being served.\n\nI raised capital, moved to NYC from California, and began building Frontdesk. I'm now the founder and CEO.\n\nFrontdesk is a comprehensive AI operating system that engages with customers across all channels and performs real-world tasks, such as scheduling and follow-ups.\n\nWe work in-person in an office in SoHo. Most people in our office share a similar story to mine; they left Microsoft, Amazon, or Meta, walking away from good salaries and stock options, because they believed this was worth building.\n\nI feel lucky to work with people who push me to be better every day.\n\nMost nights, my work looks the same as it did in middle school. I pace, talk into a phone, and listen for what feels off. The difference is that now, when it works, it works across millions of calls. It's the same instinct that led me to build Rescuer years ago.\n\nThe phones are still ringing, and the models are still getting better. I know where I want to be while that happens: close to the code and building something worth leaving comfort behind.\n\nDid you quit a Big Tech job to build your own company?

    "description": "Business Insider is on the ground at Las Vegas CES 2026. Here's everything we learned on self-driving cars and robotaxis,",
    "fullText": "Business Insider is taking on CES 2026.\n\nI'm on the ground in Las Vegas from Tuesday to Thursday, taking in all there is to know about the latest in the driverless space.\n\nRobotaxis and self-driving cars have already had an outsize presence at the tech conference, especially in the previous hype cycle of the late 2010s and early 2020s.\n\nThings have changed since then. The industry has largely moved on from mere concepts and technology validation to: How are we going to realistically scale autonomy?\n\nIt's day one of the conference, and there's already a lot to take in.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang unveiled the Alpamayo family, which will serve as an autonomous-driving stack for OEMs to deal with those stubborn edge cases — or the \"long tail\" of self-driving.\n\nUber and Nuro showed off an early look at the Lucid Gravity SUV that the companies hope public riders will be able to take by late 2026.\n\nI'll be spending less time at keynotes and speaker events and more on real-life demonstrations and meetings with industry leaders and commentators in autonomy\n\nThink of this as my personal notebook, where I jot down everything I've learned and seen at the conference.\n\nCheck back in for more updates.\n\nThis is the first year Zoox, an Amazon-backed robotaxi company, will be giving live demonstrations of its service during CES.\n\nI got to take a ride in one on Monday night in front of Resorts World. (The company tagline that I saw from an ad at the Harry Reid International Airport was: \"Don't just do the Strip. Zoox it.\")\n\nMy immediate thoughts were that Zoox feels unlike any other robotaxi or pseudo-robotaxi on the market. It felt more like I was on a theme park ride than in an everyday car we're familiar with.\n\nUnlike Waymo's robotaxis, Zoox is not a regular car you could buy that's been retrofitted with sensors. The Zoox car is bi-directional — meaning there's no real front or back of the car — and the inside has no steering wheel, just seats.\n\nThe robotaxis were clearly a great tourist attraction from what I saw. My Uber driver wasn't too happy about them.\n\nUber, Lucid, and Nuro had a swanky cocktail hour at Fontainebleau Las Vegas, where they quite literally wined and dined a room full of reporters, analysts, and investors: endless glasses of wine and an open bar, lobster tails, jumbo shrimp, too many appetizers to count, and a giant charcuterie board — the works.\n\nMaybe understandably so? 2026 will be a big year for the three companies.\n\nUber's plan is to roll out a robotaxi service by late 2026. The first market is San Francisco, where Uber will directly compete with Waymo. These two companies are partners in other markets, like Austin.\n\n\"We've been moving very, very quickly,\" Nuro's co-CEO and cofounder Dave Ferguson said. \"We signed this partnership last July. We're already testing the production-intent vehicles on public roads. And very soon, we're going to have tens of thousands of them worldwide.\"",

    "title": "Larry Page is officially moving business out of California ahead of a proposed billionaire's tax",
    "description": "The Google cofounder has severed ties between California and several of his business entities, including his family office.",
    "fullText": "Billionaire Larry Page is peacing out of California.\n\nThe Google cofounder has cut ties between California and many of his assets that risked exposing him to a proposed new wealth tax in the state, meeting an end-of-2025 deadline, according to filings reviewed by Business Insider.\n\nPage's family office, Koop, was converted out of California in late December and incorporated in Delaware, per filings with both states. Page converted several other entities to Delaware, including Flu Lab LLC — a vehicle he has used to fund research on tackling influenza and lists its principal office address in Nevada — and another entity named One Aero, which has funded his flying car ventures and lists its principal office address in Florida.\n\nA filing was also made to convert Dynatomics, LLC from California to Delaware with a new principal address in Keller, Texas. Page launched Dynatomics, a new startup focused on applying AI to aircraft manufacturing, in 2023, Business Insider previously reported. A source close to Page said that the team, run by Chris Anderson, continues to work out of California.\n\nAnderson and representatives for Page's family office did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe New York Times reported in December that Page had told people he was considering moving to Florida because of a proposed ballot measure that would tax the state's wealthiest residents. The proposal, if passed successfully, would mean that any California resident worth more than $1 billion would be taxed 5% of their assets.\n\nUnder California law, residency is determined by the nature of a person's ties to the state, with factors such as the time spent in the state and the maintenance of substantial business ties taken into account. If the ballot measure is approved in November, it would take effect retroactively for residents living in California as of January 1, 2026.\n\nA source close to Page said the Google cofounder had already left the state. Whether Page's move is temporary could not be learned.\n\nPage is ranked the second-richest person in the world, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nBesides his family office and funding vehicles, Page converted out an LLC that Business Insider previously identified as being used to purchase islands in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, from California to Delaware, with a new address listed in Florida.\n\nA separate LLC Page used to purchase an Island in Fiji was also converted out to Delaware.\n\nPage's wife, the scientist Lucinda Southworth, founded a marine-conservation charity named Oceankind. Filings show that Oceankind converted out of California to Delaware in December.\n\nDelaware has become a popular state for businesses to incorporate due to its favorable tax structure, privacy, and its home to a court system specifically designed to handle corporate disputes. The state does not require LLCs to disclose the names and addresses of directors when incorporating, providing them with an extra layer of privacy.\n\nPrivacy is especially important to Page, whose family office is shrouded in a level of secrecy unparalleled by most and carefully managed by its CEO, Wayne Osborne.\n\nCristina Rosado, an attorney who handles many of Page and Southworth's assets, signed several of the California filings.\n\nPage incorporated three entities in Florida last year, as previously reported by The New York Times. A Koop LLC was incorporated in Florida in January 2025, per filings reviewed by Business Insider. It could not be confirmed if it belongs to Page.\n\nThe California billionaire tax proposal faced some opposition from leaders in venture capital and politics. In a post on X in December, venture capitalist Vinod Khosla said the proposed measure would mean California would lose its most important taxpayers and \"net off much worse.\"\n\n\"Long term damage unless legislature bans wealth taxes,\" he added. \"Easier to equalize taxes on work income and capital gains at the national level.\n\nMatt Mahan, Democratic mayor of San Jose, California, on Monday described the tax as \"a political plan that will sink California's innovation economy.\"\n\nWhite House AI czar David Sacks has criticized the proposal and said it will backfire. He has also said he believes Miami and Austin will overtake New York and San Francisco for finance and tech, respectively. He announced this month that his venture capital firm, Craft Ventures, had opened an office in Austin.\n\nLast month, celebrity lawyer Alex Spiro wrote a letter to California Gov. Gavin Newsom, warning that the proposed billionaire tax would \"trigger an exodus of capital and innovation from California,\" Business Insider previously reported.\n\nHave something to share?

    "description": "\"Beast Games\" co-creator Sean Klitzner spoke to Business Insider about what goes into making a large-scale unscripted competition show.",
    "fullText": "YouTuber MrBeast is all about one-upping himself with bigger and bolder videos.\n\nThat approach is at the core of the second season of \"Beast Games,\" MrBeast's Amazon Prime Video show that returns to TV screens this week.\n\n\"We took everything from season one — all of the learnings from creative to production — we put it all on a wall, and every single day we just set out to make it better, which is the nature of the brand,\" Sean Klitzner, one of the show's co-creators and showrunners, told Business Insider.\n\nThe second season will pit 100 \"strong\" and 100 \"smart\" contestants against each other in a series of challenges as they vie for over $10 million in prizes.\n\nBusiness Insider spoke with Klitzner about filming the new season, as well as his experience working at MrBeast's company, Beast Industries, which he left in October.\n\nKlitzner said a big focus for \"Beast Games\" season two was meeting the team's creative goals without blowing through its budget and shooting requirements.\n\nThe first season of \"Beast Games\" was massive, drawing in 50 million viewers in just 25 days, according to Amazon. But it was also a money drain for MrBeast. The YouTuber, whose real name is Jimmy Donaldson, said making the first season of \"Beast Games\" lost his company tens of millions of dollars. Beast Industries has been on a broader push to turn its media business profitable in recent months.\n\nFor season two, the goal was \"balancing the budget and the creative to make sure that we don't lose the virality,\" Klitzner said. \"Every day I had the spreadsheets up.\"\n\nKlitzner said contingency planning was also a major focus for the show's second season. The first season encountered a variety of problems, including a crew-member injury, complaints about access to food and medical care during preliminary filming in Las Vegas, and torrential rain while shooting in Toronto.\n\nKlitzner said he worked closely with co-creator Tyler Conklin and the team on brainstorming ideas, and that his role on set and in preproduction was helping to make sure Donaldson and Conklin's creative vision came to life by anticipating problems before they happened.\n\nHe said he would do multiple set walkthroughs to catch details that might draw concern, asking questions like:\n\nThe team also decided to film part of the second season in Greenville, North Carolina, where the MrBeast creative team is based. The company received a $15 million film and entertainment grant from the state to shoot there.\n\nFilming in Greenville \"made things much easier, especially when you get to sleep in your own bed,\" Klitzner said.\n\nPulling off \"Beast Games,\" with its record-breaking scale, involved \"over 1,000,000 hours of hard work spread between thousands of people,\" Donaldson wrote on X (formerly Twitter). Conklin was the \"creative filter\" for the show, Klitzner said. Other key contributors included fellow showrunner Matt Apps, co-creator Mack Hopkins, executive producer Mike Miller, and a long list of other creatives.\n\nUnlike on a traditional Hollywood set, MrBeast staffers are used to wearing many hats, and that expertise translated to the set, Klitzner said.\n\n\"Take full ownership of your episode or of your scene or of whatever, by understanding every aspect of it,\" Klitzner said. \"I want you to know about camera. I want you to know about every aspect of things.\"\n\nKlitzner joined MrBeast in April 2022 after seeing the YouTuber's post on X that he was looking to hire \"a super creative, YouTube nerd.\"\n\nAfter seeing that post and applying, Klitzner said he scored an interview with Conklin, MrBeast's creative lead, who invited him out to the team's Greenville headquarters to work for a 90-day test period, known as a vibe check.\n\nKlitzner started at the company as a creative working on MrBeast's YouTube channel. His first video as lead producer involved a paid assassin chasing after the YouTuber. It was published in March 2023 and has pulled in over 300 million views to date.\n\nThe executive worked his way up at Beast Industries, overseeing its YouTube shorts strategy for a few months and helping to produce content for MrBeast's chocolate brand Feastables. He later served as Donaldson's chief of staff for about a month, before being brought on to help make \"Beast Games.\"\n\nAfter leaving MrBeast, Klitzner said he would love to work with a streamer like Netflix or Amazon that is interested in an unscripted series.\n\nHis biggest takeaway from working at MrBeast? Fight through your imposter syndrome, and you'll discover you're capable of pulling off a lot.\n\nThe opportunities Klitzner had to \"showcase what I could do have changed my life,\" he said. \"I don't feel like an imposter anymore.\"",

    "fullText": "All episodes\n\n All episodes\n\n Details\n\n Transcript\n\n January 06, 2026\n\n Equitable, a 163-year-old financial services firm, serves more than five million clients across three main lines of business: retirement planning, wealth management, and asset management. Spun out of French insurance giant AXA in a 2018 IPO, Equitable’s leadership team was excited to be out on its own but quickly realized that to overcome inertia and remain relevant, the company’s ways of working would need to change.\nIn 2019, CEO Mark Pearson launched an effort known internally as New Ways of Working, or NWOW, aimed at helping the firm become faster, more accountable, and more adaptive in a highly competitive and regulated industry. Several years in, the effort sheds light on core leadership questions: What does true cultural change look like? What makes it last? And how do leaders bring skeptics along? Harvard Business School Professor Das Narayandas joins Pearson and COO Jeff Hurd to discuss the case “New WOW at Equitable: A New Way of Working.”\n\n Back / How Equitable Confronted Its Inertia After 160 Years in Business\n\n Latest in this series\n\n All episodes",

    "fullText": "Alphabet has a lot to gain by developing its quantum technology in-house.\n\nThe tech giant is already seeing real-world applications for its technology.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\n\nQuantum computing is a difficult area to invest in. It's similar to investing in early-stage biotechs, where there are some promising results, but nothing indicative of true future success. Couple that with how many companies are competing for quantum computing dominance, and it turns into a very difficult area to invest in.\n\nFurthermore, this industry has a lot of hype around it, and some of the pure-play stocks, like IonQ and Rigetti Computing, are seeing their stocks rapidly rise and fall in line with the risk tolerance of the market.\n\nMany investors may want to shy away from this industry because of the volatility and lack of a clear leader, which is fine. However, I think there's a smarter way to invest in the quantum computing realm without needing to expose yourself to high-risk investment that has a huge chance of paying off.\n\nHow? Through an investment in Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL).\n\nAlphabet is a large conglomerate of companies, but it's mainly centered around the Google ecosystem. While Google Search and the ad revenue it generates are the core of Alphabet's business, it's more diversified than that segment.\n\nAlphabet also owns a cloud computing business, Google Cloud. Google Cloud uses computing units from other providers, such as Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs), to rent out computing capacity to customers for a wide variety of tasks. However, it has to purchase those GPUs from Nvidia, which is expensive.\n\nGoogle also developed the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) in-house in collaboration with Broadcom, which is a step closer to fully building its own computing hardware. However, Alphabet has chosen to develop its quantum computing hardware entirely on its own, which could pay off big-time for its cloud computing business if it succeeds.\n\nIf Alphabet can win the race to build the first commercially viable quantum computer, then clients will flock to Google Cloud to utilize this cutting-edge technology. This would have other trickle-down effects, such as more clients using its generative artificial intelligence (AI) model, Gemini. Quantum computing technology is expected to greatly reduce the cost of running artificial intelligence training and inference, which would make Gemini the go-to model if Alphabet can develop a quantum computing advantage.",

    "description": "Barry Pollack has a long track record of sensitive cases involving national security, and of defending corporate executives in criminal trials.",
    "fullText": "When Nicolás Maduro needed someone to represent him in an American courtroom, he turned to a lawyer with experience facing off against the federal government.\n\nThe Venezuelan political leader hired Barry Pollack, a criminal defense attorney who's represented WikiLeaks publisher Julian Assange, as well as other high-profile defendants.\n\nThe Justice Department has accused Maduro, who was serving as Venezuela's president when he was captured by US forces, of participating in a narco-terrorism conspiracy, alleging he worked with illegal drug gangs. They also accused him and his wife, Cilia Flores, of conspiring to illegally import cocaine into the United States and of gun-related charges.\n\nOn Monday afternoon, US Marshals escorted the couple into a 26th-floor courtroom in lower Manhattan, where they entered not-guilty pleas and proclaimed their innocence. US military forces apprehended Maduro and Flores in a pre-dawn operation on Saturday in the Venezuelan capital of Caracas and brought them to the United States.\n\nAt the hearing, Pollack told US District Judge Alvin Hellerstein that he would file \"voluminous and complicated\" motions on Maduro's behalf, suggesting he would challenge the charges and the basis for his arrest.\n\n\"Mr. Maduro is the head of a sovereign state,\" Pollack said in court. \"He is entitled to the privileges and immunities that go with that office. In addition, there are issues about the legality of this military abduction.\"\n\nDelcy Rodriguez was sworn in as Venezuela's interim president on Monday afternoon.\n\nPollack, an attorney at the boutique law firm Harris St. Laurent & Wechsler LLP, is best known as one of the many lawyers who represented Assange, the publisher of WikiLeaks.\n\nProsecutors had accused Assange of working with hackers to obtain government secrets from federal agencies and American companies, as well as conspiring with former US Army officer Chelsea Manning to leak documents about the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.\n\nAssange pleaded guilty to espionage charges in the summer of 2024, capping a six-year legal battle that involved complex negotiations with multiple governments.\n\nPollack's experience with sensitive national security matters could be an asset for his representation of Maduro, which will likely involve classified information. The attorney has also represented Jeffrey Sterling, a former CIA officer who was convicted of espionage charges after leaking information to a journalist.\n\nTo be paid, Pollack will likely need a waiver from the US Treasury Department, which has sanctioned Maduro and the Venezuelan government.\n\nIt's not clear when Pollack began representing Maduro. He formally entered an appearance on the court docket late Monday morning. Maduro was first indicted in 2020, and Hellerstein has overseen court proceedings against other Venezuelan nationals accused of conspiring with him. Pollack didn't respond to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nA court-appointed lawyer for Maduro, David Wikstrom, told Business Insider he was informed at 8:40 a.m. on Monday that he would be representing the Venezuelan president in court. Shortly before the noon court hearing, he said he still hadn't spoken to Pollack, who ultimately represented Maduro in the proceeding.\n\nFlores is represented by Mark Donnelly, a Texas-based attorney who served as a federal prosecutor for 12 years, and one of his law partners, Andres Sanchez.\n\nPollack, a former public defender and president of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, has a long track record of successful defense outcomes in criminal trials.\n\nHe represented former Enron accountant Michael W. Krautz, who a jury acquitted of fraud charges. And he successfully overturned the conviction of Martin Tankleff, a Long Island man who spent 17 years in prison after he was falsely accused of killing his parents as a teenager.\n\nMore recently, Pollack represented the executive of a poultry company accused of conspiring to fix the price of chickens. Jurors declined to find the executive guilty in two separate trials.\n\nIn a 2025 interview with Lawdragon, Pollack decried the Justice Department's \"extraordinary view\" of its jurisdiction for criminal cases, using the Assange case as an example.\n\n\"You've got somebody who's not a United States citizen who is publishing information not in the United States, had not set foot in the United States, with respect to any of the alleged offensive conduct,\" Pollack said. \"The information was leaked to him by somebody in Iraq. Yet the United States obviously felt that it could pursue that as a criminal offense in the United States.\"",

    "fullText": "U.S. multinational corporations will be exempted from paying more corporate taxes overseas in a deal finalized by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.\n\nThe OECD announced Monday that nearly 150 countries have agreed on the plan, initially crafted in 2021, to stop large global companies from shifting profits to low-tax countries, no matter where they operate in the world.\n\nThe amended version excludes large U.S.-based multinational corporations from the 15% global minimum tax after negotiations between President Donald Trump’s administration and other members of the Group of Seven wealthy nations.\n\nOECD Secretary-General Mathias Cormann said in a statement that the agreement is a “landmark decision in international tax co-operation” and “enhances tax certainty, reduces complexity, and protects tax bases.”\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent called the agreement “a historic victory in preserving U.S. sovereignty and protecting American workers and businesses from extraterritorial overreach.”\n\nThe most recent version of the deal waters down a landmark 2021 agreement that set a minimum global corporate tax of 15%. The idea was to stop multinational corporations, including Apple and Nike, from using accounting and legal maneuvers to shift earnings to low- or no-tax havens.\n\nThose havens are typically places like Bermuda and the Cayman Islands, where the companies actually do little or no business.\n\nFormer Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen was a key driver of the 2021 OECD global tax deal and made the corporate minimum tax one of her top priorities. The plan was widely panned by congressional Republicans who said it would make the U.S. less competitive in a global economy.\n\nThe Trump administration in June re-negotiated the deal when congressional Republicans rolled back a so-called revenge tax provision from Trump’s big tax and spending bill that would have allowed the federal government to impose taxes on companies with foreign owners, as well as on investors from countries judged as charging “unfair foreign taxes” on U.S. companies.\n\nTax transparency groups have criticized the amended OECD plan.\n\n“This deal risks nearly a decade of global progress on corporate taxation only to allow the largest, most profitable American companies to keep parking profits in tax havens,” said Zorka Milin, policy director at the FACT Coalition, a tax transparency nonprofit.\n\nTax watchdogs argue the minimum tax is supposed to halt an international race to the bottom for corporate taxation that has led multinational businesses to book their profits in countries with low tax rates.",

    "description": "Jaclyn Johnson turned a $50,000 gamble into a business she sold for $22 million. Repurchasing it for a fraction of the price reshaped her journey.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Jaclyn Johnson, founder and chief creative officer at Create & Cultivate. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI was raised by entrepreneurs, but I never wanted to be one. Instead, I saw myself in a big corner office in the city. I started climbing the corporate ladder, but being laid off twice showed me that a corporate career wasn't as secure as I thought.\n\nI started freelancing, and soon opened a marketing agency called No Subject. We focused on events and influencers, back when we were still calling them bloggers. I ran that company for four years and scaled it into a multimillion-dollar business. Those years were my MBA: I learned everything about how to run a business.\n\nNow that I was living in their world, I wanted to speak with other female founders and entrepreneurs. In 2011, I hosted a small retreat called Create & Cultivate for about 25 people in Palm Springs. It was a way to get offline and connect in person with like-minded women. I never in a million years thought it would be something bigger than that.\n\nAfter that first event, Create & Cultivate took on a life of its own. By 2014, I hosted 300 people in Los Angeles. Brands were knocking on my door to work with us — a big change from the marketing agency, where I was used to chasing brands.\n\nIn 2016, a colleague and mentor approached me. She thought that Create & Cultivate could become something much bigger if we really invested in it.\n\nI was really nervous to do that. I had started my other business with a laptop and an idea, so investing money was a new concept for me. My mom, however, encouraged me to invest in myself. She pointed out that I was used to paying for public relations and other professionals, so why wouldn't I use my money to back myself?\n\nI invested $50,000, which was nearly all my savings.\n\nFrom there, the business experienced exponential growth. I had a choice to make: I could stay with my marketing agency, which was a cushy and predictable job. Or, I could jump into Create & Cultivate — an option that was a riskier bet, but had huge potential.\n\nI decided to sell my marketing company. It gave me a financial cushion — enough to buy my first house.\n\nThat sale also introduced me to the idea that a company could be sold. As I continued to build Create & Cultivate, I was laser-focused on what made the company desirable: its focus on career women. Selling the company was my ultimate goal.\n\nThen, the pandemic happened, decimating the event space. Although we were able to pivot to digital fairly successfully, by the end of 2020, I was very burned out from the pandemic and the emotional roller coaster of the acquisitions process.\n\nIn March 2021, a private equity firm bought Create & Cultivate for $22 million. That was lower than the offers we'd had the year before, but it was a great deal considering the market. As the majority owner of the company, I received a substantial cash payment upon exit.\n\nI continued as CEO for a transition period, and then remained active on the board. After about 18 months, it became clear that the private equity firm was planning to sell the company.\n\nI was blindsided. As the founder, the business was so important to me. It was a community that I built and had a kinship with.\n\nStill, I wasn't thinking about personally buying it back until I spoke with Marina Middleton, who is now the CEO. She was immediately on board with purchasing back Create & Cultivate. We were able to purchase the company for six figures — not even close to the exit price.\n\nThis time, we're doing things differently. Because it's an existing company, I know we can't bootstrap. People need the quality they're accustomed to from the very beginning. As a result, we've raised $2.6 million in venture capital. We're focused on creating events that hinge on access to experts, leveraging tech components. It's related to my initial vision, but also completely different.\n\nI'm glad to be at the helm again.",

    "description": "Most people try to keep work and friendship in separate boxes, but that division is counterproductive. Professionals now spend more time with colleagues than with anyone else, and strong personal ties at work are directly linked to trust, learning, creativity, and performance. The real obstacle to productive business friendships is the widespread belief that mixing the personal and professional inevitably cheapens relationships, a mindset that prevents people from forming connections that would make them more effective and happier. When people instead allow genuine friendships to overlap with their professional networks, they build larger, more useful networks, collaborate more openly, and experience greater well-being. Integrating these worlds is a practical strategy for better work and a more fulfilling life.",

    "fullText": "Rosen, who led Sega from the 1960s into the 90s and who died on Christmas Day, was a hugely important figure in the history of arcade and home gaming\n\nIt is difficult to think of a more influential figure in the arcade game industry than David Rosen, who has died aged 95. The co-founder of Sega, who remained a director of the company until 1996, was instrumental in the birth and rise of the video game business in Japan, and in the 1980s and 90s oversaw the establishment of Sega of America and the huge success of the Mega Drive console.\n\nAs a US Air Force pilot during the Korean war, Rosen found himself stationed in Japan, and once the conflict was over, he stayed on, intrigued by the country and seeing possibilities in its recovering economy. In 1954 he set up Rosen Enterprises and noticing that Japanese civilians now required an increasing number of new ID cards he started importing photo booths from the US to answer the demand. From here he expanded to pinball tables and other coin-operated machines, importing them for installation in shops, restaurants and cinemas. In 1965, he merged the company with another importer, Nihon Goraku Bussan, whose coin-op business Service Games was shortened to Sega for the new venture.\n\nFor the next 15 years, Sega innovated in the arcade sector, switching from importing games to designing its own, and moving on from jukeboxes and pinball tables to electromechanical arcade games such as the submarine shooting sim Periscope and, in 1972, Killer Shark, a shark hunting game which would briefly feature in Jaws. Sega also began to set up its own arcades allowing the company close control over every facet of its business.\n\nOne of Rosen’s great skills was in finding and employing people who instinctively understood where games were heading. In 1979, he spotted rising industry star Hayao Nakayama, director of Esco Trading, another arcade company. As Rosen explained to me in 2013: “Nakayama was very active as a distributor at the time – he was someone I felt was very astute and was quick to adapt to what was happening in the industry, and I wanted him – we did it via an acquisition of his company. By assimilation, we had him and the staff join us.” Nakayama would go on to be the president of Sega Japan during its heyday from 1983 to 1998.\n\nDuring this time, Sega rose from a competitor alongside fellow arcade manufacturers Namco, Capcom, Taito and Konami, to an industry leader. Its sleek, stylish coin-ops of the 1980s – Outrun, Space Harrier and AfterBurner – changed the image of arcades from nerdy hideouts to cool aspirational hangouts, while 1990s titles Virtua Racing and Virtua Fighter established the company as a technological powerhouse.\n\nFrom the late-1970s, Rosen pursued a new market: home TV games. He encounter a major rival, Nintendo, which dominated with its Color TV-Game console, and later the Nintendo Entertainment System. When Rosen returned to the US in the early 1980s, he was determined to take a slice of the global console industry from his Kyoto-based competitor. “Nintendo was responsible for the revival of the home console market after the Atari collapse of 1983,” he told me. “We wanted to see if we could make a device that would be competitive. Unfortunately our first attempt failed to compete. It was just made up of off the shelf parts, it wasn’t until 1986 that we brought out the Master System …”\n\nThis machine would struggle in the US but was huge in Europe and South America, and Rosen spotted a niche. While Nintendo was all about family entertainment, the titles doing well on the Master System were teen-focused brawlers, such as Golden Axe and Shinobi. When it came to release the new Sega Mega Drive console in Japan in 1988, Rosen insisted on changing its name to Genesis for the US launch, emphasising a new beginning and a more mature outlook. He also brought in Michael Katz an experienced exec from Mattel and early console company Coleco.\n\n“We were up against the wall in terms of time,” he said. “I had known Michael from some of the other endeavours he was involved in, he had all this experience from Coleco and he certainly knew the players. I thought he could help launch the product and at the same time bring structure to the company, which he did.” Spurred on by Rosen’s vision, Katz marketed the Genesis as a games console for teenagers, not children, using TV ads which combined video game visuals with flashing images and rock music and the immortal phrase: Genesis does what Nintendon’t. When Tom Kalinske took over as CEO Sega of America in 1990, he oversaw a new series of equally famous ads which almost always ended with someone screaming “Sega!”\n\nRosen would stay active in the company in various senior roles until retiring in 1996. Although Sega’s home console business would falter in this period due to the rise of the Sony PlayStation, the company’s arcade supremacy remained for the rest of the decade. I spoke to him in 2013 while writing the book Sega Mega Drive Collected Works. As a lifelong Sega fan, my hour-long chat with him that day was a career highlight. He talked fondly about his time in Japan, the people he worked with and his journey through the industry. He told me with considerable glee that while out and about in his home town of Los Angeles, strangers would still shout ‘Sega!” at him when passing on the street.",

    "fullText": "It would’ve been no more than another day in a life of a YouTube famous car dealer in New Jersey. Instead, the events of that day quickly spiraled into a chaotic mix of tense negotiations, customer drama, luxury car wheeling and dealing, and an unexpected call from law enforcement that stunned viewers.\n\nThe video opens inside the buzzing offices of JNS Auto House, where staff members juggle phone calls, trade appraisals, and incoming inventory. Almost immediately, trouble brews. A BMW M5 under consideration sets off alarms after an auto check reveals severe structural damage, unknown tuning, missing catalytic converters, and questionable tires.\n\nThe discovery frustrated the team, who openly criticize deceptive dealer practices and emphasize their commitment to transparency. The car is promptly dismissed, with warnings issued about dishonest sellers being removed from dealer platforms altogether.\n\nFrom there, attention shifts to a live negotiation involving a BMW M4 Competition and a trade-in from a customer calling in from Georgia. The back-and-forth exposes how razor-thin these deals can be. Shipping costs, bad Carfax history, and market values complicate matters, leaving both sides several thousand dollars apart. The conversation remains polite but strained, and when financing enters the discussion, the customer abruptly hangs up on one of the sales managers, Tony.\n\nThat moment becomes a turning point. Dealership owner George takes over and calls the customer back directly, confronting him about the hang-up. The exchange is tense. George makes it clear that disrespect toward his staff is not tolerated, even if the buyer insists on speaking only with him. Despite the friction, the discussion pivots to a far more expensive vehicle, a rare Mercedes-Benz G63 Edition 55 listed at nearly $167,000.\n\nThe customer makes an offer just under the asking price. Internally, the team debates whether to accept. The vehicle has been sitting on the lot, and the market is softening as the year ends. After a flurry of internal calls and animated discussions, the decision is made to sell at $165,000 if the buyer finances. But once again, the customer disappears, reinforcing George’s belief that buyers who refuse to work with the full sales team rarely close deals.\n\nAs if the day was not dramatic enough, the mood abruptly shifts when George receives a call from a Phoenix police investigator. The officer is searching for Brett Holmes; a former short-term employee tied to an ongoing fraud case involving title and vehicle scams.\n\nThe investigator confirms there is an active warrant for Holmes’ arrest and asks for any information that could help locate him. George publicly shares the details with viewers, urging anyone with knowledge of Holmes’ whereabouts to contact the Phoenix Police Department.\n\nWhile that storyline lingers, the dealership presses on. A new customer emerges, offering the same $165,000 for the G63. This time, the buyer is decisive. Within minutes, paperwork is requested, wire instructions are sent, and the deal is officially closed. Cheers erupt across the showroom as the team celebrates the sale, vindicated after hours of uncertainty.\n\nThe video continues with a test drive of a 2025 G63, highlighting subtle improvements in ride quality, tech features, and refinement. A full lot walk follows, showcasing an inventory that reads like a supercar wish list, including McLarens, Porsche Turbo S models, Nissan GT-Rs, Cybertrucks, Lamborghinis, and a GT2 RS held for collection purposes.\n\nThe closing moments bring a personal touch as George’s father appears on camera, offering blunt business wisdom and a humorous take on holiday car buying. His message is simple. If you love your wife, skip the car parts and buy her a G-Class.",

    "description": "Trump is having the government buy stakes directly in companies — and it's going to change the way we all do business and reshape the economy.",
    "fullText": "This is the first story in Business Insider's new series \"The Future of Capitalism.\" The series looks at ways Americans' confidence in capitalism has been eroding, and what related changes in our economy mean for your work and wealth.\n\nTo believe in American capitalism has long meant believing in a mostly laissez-faire approach from the government — it sets the rules of the game, but it doesn't have a piece on the board. Markets pick winners and losers, not Washington. The strong thrive, the weak fail. That consensus has been eroding for years, and finally, the dam has broken: The US government has become a shareholder in nearly a dozen companies over the past several months, and the list is growing. It's moved the economy into a much more interventionist — and unfamiliar — territory. The machine is still turning, but more hands are tinkering with the gears, including, most importantly, the president's.\n\nThe federal government has been on an equity stake shopping spree during the first year of Trump's second term. The US took a nearly 10% stake in Intel for $8.9 billion in August, a move aimed at bolstering the country's semiconductor industry. It has invested in several critical minerals firms, including MP Materials, Lithium Americas, and Trilogy Metals, as well as in Westinghouse, a nuclear energy company. In June, the administration acquired a \"golden share\" in US Steel in exchange for approving Japanese company Nippon Steel's acquisition of the company — it gives the government veto-like power over decisions such as shifting jobs outside the US and shuttering plants. (And as for recent developments in Venezuela, the president clearly is waving a heavy hand toward the US oil industry and potential investment there. How that situation plays remains to be seen.)\n\nThese types of moves are not abnormal outside the United States. China's version of capitalism is hyper-state-led. Many governments, including those of France, Italy, and the United Kingdom, make direct investments in some domestic firms. The US has gotten extra involved in private industry in the past, but it's generally been in times of distress, such as during the 2008 crisis, when it took stakes in certain financial institutions and automakers in order to prevent a broader economic meltdown.\n\nThis time, it's different: The government is meddling when there's no apparent urgent need, and it's picking companies in what some observers say is a scattershot manner. The sectors make sense, but the criteria for selecting companies are rather unclear, as is the role the government will play in its investments.\n\n\"With industrial policy, the devil's in the details of so much, and this is where the details are really obscured, and where they are defined, they're kind of ad hoc,\" says Nathan Lane, an assistant professor of economic development at the London School of Economics and Political Science.\n\nA novel vision of American state capitalism is emerging right before our eyes. It's a world where the White House puts its thumb on the scale, whether in injecting funds into a firm, weighing in on mergers, or implementing legally questionable tariffs at the drop of a hat. Many critics have expressed concerns about the risks arising from the Trump administration's actions — the potential for politically biased decision-making, the appearance of crony capitalism, and possible market distortions. In the grand scheme of things, these maneuvers may be financially minor, but they're structurally major developments. Regardless of the drawbacks, it's indicative of where we're headed. There may be no going back.\n\n\"The use of these tools generally only goes in one direction, and so the Trump administration, for better or worse, has introduced a new group of tools into the economic statecraft toolkit,\" says Aaron Bartnick, a former White House economic security official under the Biden administration and a current fellow at Columbia University. \"Whatever administration comes next, whether Republican or Democrat, will find it very tempting to continue to use them.\"\n\nThis hasn't all happened out of nowhere — the US has, for a decade, been increasingly comfortable with industrial policy, meaning the government taking a more active role in steering the economy. Trump 1.0 implemented several protectionist policies, including imposing tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, engaging in a trade war with China, and renegotiating the NAFTA trade agreement with Canada and Mexico. Rather than rolling everything back, Biden left in place many of Trump's tariffs, and his administration pushed in a state-nudged economic direction with the CHIPS Act, which was meant to support the US semiconductor industry, and the Inflation Reduction Act, which, among other things, put tax credits and funds toward sectors such as electric vehicles and solar energy. And even prior to Trump and Biden, the government hasn't completely steered clear of steering the economy when needed. See: The New Deal and the aforementioned response to the financial crisis.\n\nStill, overall, the US has largely taken a hands-off approach to the economy over the last 40 years and been critical of countries that don't.\n\n\"The United States has spent decades tsk-tsking the rest of the world about state-owned enterprises and industrial policy and state capitalism,\" says Scott Lincicome, vice president of general economics and trade at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank. On the Trump administration's current about-face, \"the hypocrisy is pretty big,\" he says.\n\nThe latest turn is a significant step further. Instead of deploying a more typical playbook — grants, loans, tariffs, etc. — that can be seen as at least somewhat neutral in its application, the White House is now picking and choosing companies to get involved in. In broad strokes, one can see what they're getting at here. The companies on Trump's investment list are in important sectors where the US lags behind, and they fit into the president's overall theory of the case on the economy: it's better to have and make stuff here. Take Intel: The Trump administration wants to make sure the US is not reliant on semiconductor companies such as TSMC, which is based in Taiwan, since the island is vulnerable to China. It's a similar story with critical minerals companies, which mine, process, or refine materials crucial for a range of products, from smartphones to defense technology. Even some progressives see these as worthwhile endeavors. Sen. Bernie Sanders is into the Intel deal, telling Reuters in August that \"If microchip companies make a profit from the generous grants they receive from the federal government, the taxpayers of America have a right to a reasonable return on that investment.\"\n\nWhat some critics find head-scratching is why specific companies are being chosen. Why Intel in particular, and even more peculiarly, why a startup helmed by Intel's former CEO? On a macro level, the end goal may be the same as more typical industrial policy — supporting certain sectors — but it's being performed on a micro level. Trump has also been critical of policies with the same end in mind. Back in March, he told Congress to \"get rid of\" the CHIPS Act.\n\n\"It is fair to say that Intel has been underperforming, but I don't know of anyone who feels that if Intel continued to underperform, there was a risk of taking the entire technology sector down,\" Bartnick says. \"We haven't seen a rationale for how these particular companies were selected, how these particular industries were selected, how the valuations were reached.\"\n\nThe Trump administration may have determined that the US can't win its existential battle with China and protect its economic priorities with the regular tools in the toolbox. William Henagan, a research fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, says those instruments have proven effective in the past because of the size of America's economy and the critical role the US dollar plays in global finance. The fact that the White House thinks throwing around our national weight is not enough to achieve their desired outcomes is an eyebrow-raising sign.\n\n\"We've basically been able to use restrictive enforcement tools to achieve international policy outcomes that we were interested in,\" Henagan says. \"Those are no longer sufficient.\"\n\nA White House official tells me there's \"very much\" a logic to what the administration is doing in taking equity stakes in strategic industries and sectors. \"The point with the equity stakes is that it's a tool that other countries have used with various degrees of success, but we're not indiscriminately trying to take equity stakes in everyone, in anything. We see it as a very powerful tool that we're using very judiciously in very specific sectors for very specific reasons,\" they say. Losing Intel, for example, would be an \"asymmetric blow\" to America's national and economic security.\n\nThe equity stakes are a \"rounding error\" compared with the trillions of dollars of GDP being affected by \"what are very unequivocally free-market or pro-capitalist policymaking\" activities, the official says, pointing to tax cuts and deregulation, among other moves. But they are an acknowledgment that the White House feels the free market has fallen short in shoring up these critical sectors.\n\nWhile the motivation for taking stakes in companies may be clear-ish, the execution is not, nor are the potential consequences.\n\n\"We know very little about the other rights that are associated with these deals,\" Bartnick says.\n\nIt's hard to predict exactly how the government will wield its equity-derived power. How will these stakes dilute the rights of existing shareholders? And what happens if the US government's interests don't align with those of other stockholders? Will the company feel compelled to follow through on what the government says, regardless? How exactly will the terms of these deals work? And even if the government doesn't use the hard power of its vote shares, it can use soft power to keep companies it's invested in from stepping out of line.\n\nThe federal government's Intel investment will be passive, meaning it gets no board representation or other governance rights, and it's agreed to vote with the company's board of directors — with limited exceptions. As part of the MP Materials agreement, the company isn't allowed to nominate any board members who are not US citizens without the Department of Defense's consent. However, the government will generally vote with the company's board, with exceptions.\n\nThe way American capitalism is generally supposed to work is that money flows to companies that are doing the best job of utilizing it. The whole idea is that market capital allocation is designed to separate the wheat from the chaff. These stakes may distort that — the government is choosing which specific firms it wants to come out ahead.\n\nWhat's more, if the federal government is going about throwing around money, rather than businesses focusing on making the best products and services possible, they may turn their attention to currying favor with the president. Whether or not this is crony capitalism or merely appears to be doesn't really matter. If executives make the calculation that it's much better to be on Trump's good side than his bad side, they may fall in line preemptively. The competition isn't for customers, market share, or innovation — it's for the president's affection.\n\nThe Trump administration doesn't want to be in the business of running private companies from the Oval Office, the White House official tells me, but the point is for the government to have some sway. \"Obviously, the intent wasn't for us to take an equity stake in Intel and then they just close down their Ohio foundry and ship it off to Taiwan,\" the official says. The hope is there's an \"overlap\" between what's best for companies and best for American economic national security.\n\nScott Kennedy, a senior advisor in Chinese business and economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, tells me that in an economy as vast and varied as America's, Washington's power is relatively limited, and this activity could be just a \"minor nuisance\" to industry. \"On the other hand, if there are more cases, then it will begin to affect the decision-making of businesses and will increasingly orient them to think about how they should do business in a way that benefits the current administration as opposed to what benefits their company or the US national interest,\" he says. \"And I think that that could have a distorting effect eventually.\"\n\n\"It's better if tech CEOs spend less time in DC and more time coming up with new products,\" says Owen Zidar, a professor of economics and public affairs at Princeton University.\n\nNearly every analyst, economist, and academic I spoke to for this story agreed that Trump's version of American state capitalism is more a reflection of where the US is going than where it has been. It's not the same as what China's doing, and it's not socialism, but it's an unconventional step further down the road that the US has been on for a while.\n\nOn issues such as antitrust enforcement, industrial policy, and tariffs, factions within both the Republican and Democratic parties are leaning more towards interventionism. Trump is being more obvious with his actions and intentions — there's a reason Tim Cook is showing up in the Oval Office with a gold plaque. This is a situation where there's likely no backtracking. Other countries are reacting to America's inward turn as well — it's why Canada is shoring up its domestic economy, and Europe is taking a corporatist turn.\n\n\"It changes the political equilibrium in a way that other countries pursue similar policies. And we get away from the brand of capitalism that we were doing before,\" Lane says.\n\nIt's not a bad thing to look beyond the previous consensus. Capitalism is increasingly unpopular in America, especially among young people, for a reason. For many Americans, the system isn't working. Instead, it's breeding inequality, shipping jobs overseas, and making the overall economy more precarious. During the pandemic, the public got a front-row seat to the fragility of our supply chains and the risks associated with the just-in-time, globally distributed setup. Political leaders and policymakers aren't wrong to wonder if the state shouldn't take a heavier hand in shoring up important industries, supporting vital companies, and making investments where the private market might blanch at the risks.\n\nThe White House has indicated that more equity investments are likely on the horizon, but the criteria for who it will pick are a black box. \"We should entirely leave it up to the market to do whatever it wants\" is not a great approach to the economy. Neither is, \"Who gets a leg up depends on how the president's feeling today.\" It's odd for Trump to seize the means of production a little bit.\n\n\"We've had this sort of ideological view that's now breaking down a bit because we've realized that what we've been doing isn't good enough, isn't adequate enough,\" says Robert Atkinson, the founder and president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a tech and science policy think tank. \"I wish there was a sort of unified field theory for this in the Trump administration, but I don't think so.\"\n\nWhile the motives are understandable, the mechanics are anything but. It's unclear how the US will exit these investments, or, once it does, how much money it will actually make. However, in the context of the enormous federal budget, the return will be minimal. It pushes the global economy into new territory, and it's hard to know whether it's one the US will always like.\n\n\"We have spent decades, under both Democrats and even more so under Republicans, criticizing certainly China and Russia, but also Italy, Germany, and the UK on their use of these tools,\" Bartnick says. \"And if the US starts to go down that path as well, it will give not just our adversaries, but also our allies, even greater license to do the same.\"\n\nEmily Stewart is a senior correspondent at Business Insider, writing about business and the economy.",

    "title": "An NYU professor who hates that students' work reads like McKinsey memos held AI oral exams to 'fight fire with fire'",
    "description": "When student work looked like McKinsey memos, an NYU business school professor used AI oral exams to test real learning.",
    "fullText": "The assignments looked brilliant. The understanding didn't.\n\nThat's when an NYU business school professor decided to fight AI-assisted coursework with AI-powered oral exams.\n\nPanos Ipeirotis, a professor at NYU's Stern School of Business who teaches data science, wrote in a blog post published last week that he became concerned about student assignments that read like \"a McKinsey memo\" but lacked genuine understanding.\n\nWhen he called on students in class and asked them to defend their submissions, many struggled to do so.\n\n\"If you cannot defend your own work live, then the written artifact is not measuring what you think it is measuring,\" Ipeirotis wrote.\n\nTo counter that, he revived oral exams and enlisted an AI agent to administer them at scale, in an attempt to \"fight fire with fire.\"\n\n\"We need assessments that evolve toward formats that reward understanding, decision-making, and real-time reasoning,\" Ipeirotis said.\n\n\"Oral exams used to be standard until they could not scale,\" he added. \"Now, AI is making them scalable again.\"\n\nIn the blog post detailing the experiment, Ipeirotis said he and his colleague built the AI examiner using ElevenLabs' conversational speech technology.\n\n\"Just write a prompt describing what the agent should ask the student, and you are done,\" he said, adding that it took minutes to set up.\n\nThe oral exam had two parts. First, the AI agent questioned students about their capstone projects, probing their decisions and reasoning. Then it selected one of the cases discussed in class and pushed students to think through it live.\n\nOver the course of nine days, the system assessed 36 students. Each session lasted about 25 minutes, with total compute costs coming in at about $15 for all 36 students. A human-run oral exam could cost hundreds of dollars at teaching-assistant rates, Ipeirotis wrote.\n\nIpeirotis also used AI to grade the exams. Three AI models — Claude, Gemini, and ChatGPT — independently assessed each transcript. They then reviewed one another's evaluations, revised their scores, and produced a final grade, with Claude acting as the \"chair\" to synthesize the decision.\n\nIpeirotis said the \"council of LLMs\" graded more consistently than humans, and \"more strictly, but more fairly.\"\n\n\"The feedback was better than any human would produce,\" he wrote, adding that the AI analysis also surfaced gaps in how the material had been taught.\n\nHowever, students were divided. Only a small minority preferred the AI oral exams, and many found them more stressful than written tests — even while acknowledging they were a better measure of real understanding.\n\nStill, Ipeirotis said the oral exams demonstrated \"how learning is supposed to work.\"\n\n\"The more you practice, the better you get,\" Ipeirotis wrote.\n\nIpeirotis' blog post comes as universities grapple with how to test students in the AI era.\n\nA paper published in September in the academic journal \"Assessment & Evaluation in Higher Education\" said AI has turned student assessment into a \"wicked problem.\"\n\nThe study's authors interviewed 20 unit chairs at a large Australian university in late 2024. Through hourlong Zoom interviews, they found instructors to be overwhelmed by heavier workloads, confusion surrounding AI use, and a lack of agreement on what an AI-proof assessment should look like.\n\nSome faculty members told researchers that AI should be treated as a tool for students to master. Others view it as academic dishonesty that erodes learning. Many admitted they were unsure how to proceed.\n\nIn May, LinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman said on an episode of his podcast, \"Possible,\" that AI can make it easier for students to exploit traditional assessment formats, such as essays. Universities should rethink how they evaluate learning, he said, adding that students could soon expect an \"AI examiner.\"\n\nHoffman said that oral exams leave less room for shortcuts, requiring students to demonstrate real understanding.",

    "description": "Jason Lemkin, the founder of SaaStr, the world's largest community of business-to-business executives and founders, is swapping out human workers for AI.",
    "fullText": "Jason Lemkin, known to some as the Godfather of SaaS, says the time has come to push the limits of AI in the workplace.\n\nIn practice, Lemkin, the founder of SaaStr, the world's largest community of business-to-business founders, said on Lenny's Podcast recently that this means he will stop hiring humans in his sales department.\n\nInstead, SaaStr is going all in on agents, which are commonly defined as virtual assistants that can complete tasks autonomously. They break down problems, outline plans, and take action without being prompted by a user.\n\nHe said the company now has 20 AI agents automating tasks once handled by a team of 10 sales development representatives and account executives.\n\nThat move from an entirely human workforce to an agent-based workforce was rapid.\n\nIn May, SaaStr had just one AI agent in production that it used for various digital tasks, Lemkin said. That month, though, during the SaaStr Annual — its yearly gathering of over 10,000 founders, executives, and VCs — two of its high-paid sales representatives abruptly quit.\n\nLemkin said he turned to his chief AI officer and said, \"We're done with hiring humans in sales. We're going to push the limits with agents.\"\n\nLemkin's calculus was that it just wasn't worth the cost of hiring another junior sales representative for a $150,000 a year position who would eventually quit, when he could use a loyal AI agent instead.\n\nAmelia Lerutte, SaaStr's chief AI officer, told Business Insider by email that by June, the company began ramping up the number of agents it had in production.\n\n\"We had only 1 non-core agent at the time with Delphi, but didn't go deep on 2 to 20+ until the beginning of June,\" she said. \"It was a conscious choice after their departure to reallocate some (but not all) head count spend to agents.\"\n\nAt the SaaStr office, the 10 desks that once belonged to humans on the go-to-market team are now labeled with the names of agents, like \"Quali for qualified,\" \"Arty for artisan,\" and \"Repli for Replit,\" Lemkin said.\n\nLemkin said SaaStr is training its agents on its best humans.\n\n\"Train an agent with your best person, and best script, then that agent can start to become a version of your best salesperson,\" he said.\n\nSaaStr's process is similar to how Vercel, the cloud-based platform for developers, trained a sales agent off its top performer for six weeks by documenting every step of their work, and then building an agent to mimic their process.\n\nMany companies are experimenting with AI agents, but risks remain. One of the big ones is the threat of data leaks and cybercrime.\n\n\"AI agents, in order to have their full functionality, in order to be able to access applications, often need to access the operating system or the OS level of the device on which you're running them,\" Harry Farmer, a senior researcher at the Ada Lovelace Institute, recently told Wired.\n\nAll of that access creates more potential attack points for cybercriminals.\n\nSecurity threats aside, Lemkin said that the net productivity of agents is about the same as humans. However, he said, agents are more efficient and can scale — just like software.",

    "description": "Ethan Tan joined his dad in the hawker business and learned how to maintain a father-son relationship outside work — after many fights.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Ethan Tan, a 24-year-old prawn noodle hawker from Singapore. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI've always loved cooking with my mother and watching cooking videos. It took me three painful years studying computer engineering and one corporate internship to decide hawker life was the way to go.\n\nMy parents wanted me to learn something traditional and study engineering or become a doctor.\n\nSo I thought, \"I like playing computer games, so let's pursue computer engineering.\" I didn't think much about it, and I didn't do much research.\n\nWhen the course started, I hated it. I didn't get coding at all. Examinations were hard for me, and I just suffered through them.\n\nThe point where I really felt like this wasn't the right path for me was when I got caught cheating during an exam. I managed to lie to the examiner and pretend I wasn't cheating.\n\nBut that made me realize something: If I have to resort to cheating, this is really not what I want to do.\n\nI did an internship at Accenture. It was the same thing every day: sitting at the same table from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., queuing for lunch at a crowded food court, and taking the train home.\n\nThe only comfort was sleeping in the office chair. I slept there every day for two hours. It was very boring.\n\nWith a corporate job out of the question, I looked for other career paths.\n\nAfter graduating and completing my military service, I joined my father at his seafood hawker stall.\n\nAfter about three years of managing the stall, and a short stint at the kitchens in The American Club in Singapore for some restaurant experience, I told my dad I wanted to build something of my own.\n\nIn August 2024, I opened Udang Udang, a halal prawn noodle stall right beside my father's stall in Singapore's northern Woodlands neighborhood. I used my grandmother's recipes and a recipe I learned from a streetside vendor I met in Penang, Malaysia.\n\nBefore I hired staff, it was rough. I got in early in the mornings to fry up 40 kilograms of prawn heads to make the broth. It needs to boil for six hours, and in Singapore's heat, that's no joke.\n\nBut now, more than a year on, business is faring well. I sell an average of 600 bowls of noodles daily, earning about 3,000 Singapore dollars, or about $2,300, in sales every day. I manage both my dad's stall and my own.\n\nMy plan is now to expand to more outlets around Singapore, with one new store every year.\n\nIt was tough working with my dad at the start. We fought almost every day for the first two years, and many tables were slammed in frustration.\n\nWe don't see eye to eye on many things. I tried to convince him to spend more money on marketing, including hiring influencers to try our food and creating promotional videos, but he prefers for the word to spread organically. We feel differently about how we price our products as well.\n\nIt's been challenging to learn how to work together. But we've nailed it down now, learning how to separate life and work, and talking through our differences.\n\nAt work, we're not father and son. We can fight and argue all we want. But when we get back home, I'm still his beloved son.",

    "fullText": "It's a new year! And at Business Insider, we're already diving in.\n\nWe've always been the place for innovators, and AI's arrival is creating a renaissance for entrepreneurs of all stripes. It's led to whole new industries — from legal AI to chatbot training to vibe coding to the data center boom. Everyone is learning as they go, and we are here to help you generate ideas, trade notes, and get smarter. We'll chronicle highs and lows — there will for sure be both.\n\nAt larger firms, leaders will be sizing up which AI experiments are working, at what costs, and with what benefits. How fast AI helps companies' bottom lines will determine whether we're in bubble times in the markets. We're all over that in our new First Trade newsletter.\n\nAI is a big story line on Wall Street, but it's not the only one. This past year showed dents in basic assumptions about capitalism in the US — principles that have underscored the \"stocks for the long run\" thinking that has proven sound for investors. International markets are getting more of a look, especially with rearmament in Europe and AI as a global tailwind.\n\nBetween Washington's investments in business, Zohran Mamdani's rise in the nation's financial capital, and surveys showing eroding confidence in capitalism, that mindset is no longer the given it once was. We are launching a series this week, \"The Future of Capitalism,\" and what it means for your work and wealth. Take our survey, and watch Monday for our first piece!\n\nMeanwhile, in workplaces, capitalism is alive and well. The \"anti-woke workplace\" is increasingly in fashion, and we will help you navigate an era in which many managers, in a sharp shift, are more focused on employee performance than employee policies.\n\nOur obsession with side hustles is still a full-time job for us, whether your thing is real estate, brand influencing, Uber driving, or renting your clothing. And as our reporting showed this past year, a strong side hustle can not only be fun, but also crucial if white-collar layoffs snag you.\n\nSpeaking about clothing, you've made clear you care about how to show up to succeed at work. We're exploring the cost of that, and whether that cost is sometimes too high — for your wallet or your heart. We've also got you covered on style and status, from show-off golf shirts and luxury handbags to viral hoodies, coveted watches, and Wall Street's favorite $1,100 shoes.\n\nAll of which is to say, we're pumped to cover all that's ahead — in words, video, audio, newsletters, online and IRL events, and every way that works for you!

    "title": "After getting laid off from a corporate job, I started bartending — and it changed my approach to office work",
    "description": "Marketing veteran Julie Levin briefly turned to bartending after being laid off. The experience changed her approach to corporate work.",
    "fullText": "After getting laid off in 2023, marketing veteran Julie Levin worked part time as a bartender for about six months as she considered her next steps. Levin is now the head of brand partnerships at Two Things, a New York City consultancy specializing in business transformations. The following has been edited for brevity and clarity.\n\nI moved across the country from LA to the New York area in 2022 for a really exciting job that I thought would mark the next phase of my career. But in 2023, there was a lot going on in the marketing industry, and I was laid off.\n\nIt was a setback I hadn't anticipated. It really called into question what was next for me. It's a scary place to be.\n\nI started doing some consulting, but I also wanted to be thoughtful and take time to calibrate. That's why I added bartending, which I'd done in college, into the mix. I thought it would be a way to have fun during a stressful time and make some extra money. It taught more lessons than I bargained for, in the best of ways.\n\nI had bartended at this place during the summer in college, when it was a dive. It's now fine dining with proper mixology. That meant it wasn't pouring beers and shots and easy high-balls. It was complex drinks. Not only did we have to follow the recipe for them at a high volume, but we were expected to create drinks.\n\nThere's nothing more humbling than getting behind the bar, because my corporate success wasn't relevant. The idea of not hiding behind a title was illuminating.\n\nI've always had a good work ethic, but bartending is next level. It's not just physical. There is an emotional element to it. Being behind that bar, engaging with people, and stripping away any artifice and pretense — it's a really cool thing.\n\nThere is this expectation, when you hear about people who bartend at a place like that, that you're going to walk out with 1,500 bucks every time. That's not true. It's really hard in the service industry. Bartending also shows you how good you have it in the corporate world.\n\nWhen I was bartending, there was an \"aha\" moment, and it was completely attitudinal. It's about getting more flies with honey. I think I was a late-bloomer in this sense — it didn't really dawn on me until I was behind the bar.\n\nThere were people who were full-time bartenders. When they were in a bad mood, they brought it with them. Meanwhile, you're this customer paying $20-plus a cocktail, just looking to have a nice time. You've got this surly bartender who acts like they're doing you a favor.\n\nInitially, I wanted to be part of things, and I'd complain alongside them. Then I was like, \"Wait a second. This is ridiculous. Put a smile on your face.\"\n\nIt's not that easy to stand there for eight hours and sling complicated drinks. But be pleasant; be happy — that's not that heavy of a lift. The second I did that, everything changed. It actually became the fun experience I thought it would be.\n\nAll of a sudden, I set this new tone, and it was transformational. That is something I try to carry with me. Bring a good attitude, even if you don't feel like you want to, and the circumstances suck, and your manager is the worst.\n\nPeople would be like, \"You're such a good bartender.\" The truth is, I wasn't that great. I was serviceable. Maybe, in time, I could have become amazing. But the attitude shift was infectious, and it made a huge difference.\n\nAfter bartending, I brought that spirit back to my team, and I got shout-outs all the time — not for the work I did, which I thought was pretty significant.\n\nThe praise largely came because I brought a positive attitude and a cheery spirit. No one would have said that about me for the first 20 years of my career. They would have said, \"She's really capable, really smart, but sometimes demanding and intense.\"\n\nPeople who lack the ability to roll up their sleeves and get in the weeds and also be nice to people — regardless of their title, or if they can do something for them — are going to have a really hard time.\n\nBartending forced me to rethink everything and see things that I wouldn't have seen, and enjoy every step of it, challenging and otherwise.\n\nIt teaches you the resilience and problem-solving capabilities to challenge yourself and be fearless. If you don't have those skill sets today, it's going to be hard for you to be successful.\n\nDo you have a story to share about your career? Contact this reporter at tparadis@businessinsider.com.",

    "fullText": "A group of about 20 US investors is already planning to travel to Venezuela in March, following Saturday's news that the country's president, Nicolás Maduro, had been taken into US custody.\n\nCharles Myers, the chairman of the political risk advisory firm Signum Global Advisors and a former vice-chairman of the investment advisory firm Evercore, told Business Insider that the mood among investors he has spoken to is one of \"cautious optimism\" following news of Maduro's ouster.\n\n\"I think the centerpiece of Venezuela's success, looking out 12 months or even 24 months, is foreign investment,\" Myers said. \"A big part of the Venezuela story, starting today, is foreign investment, especially in oil and gas, which is pretty straightforward, but there are massive opportunities in construction, in tourism.\"\n\nMyers said it's not the responsibility of his firm to take a \"moral position\" on whether it was right or wrong for the US to involve itself in Venezuela's government, but rather to help the firm's clients anticipate investment opportunities or mitigate risk due to geopolitical events.\n\nHowever, he added, his firm \"very much expected\" the situation in Venezuela would unfold as it has, and has been preparing investor groups to be ready to travel to the country when the opportunity presents itself. Signum previously hosted similar trips for asset managers and hedge funds to visit Syria and Ukraine.\n\n\"People have seen this coming, especially very smart investors, and many of them have actually bought bonds in anticipation of this,\" Myers said. \"But there's a very strong degree of cautious optimism, even more so than we saw with Syria, just because this is a United States-directed action.\"\n\n\"The United States will play a pivotal role in everything, especially the Venezuelan economy, starting today,\" Myers added, \"So, I think the reaction has been more enthusiastic than perhaps other situations like this.\"",

    "description": "Financial firms are planning trips to Venezuela to scout out new investment opportunities. Bill Ackman praised the move as \"good for America.\"",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump on Saturday announced that the US had conducted a raid on Venezuela, resulting in the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, and big names in business and foreign policy have been reacting as the aftermath unfolds.\n\nHere's what they've been saying:\n\nMyers, chairman of political risk consulting firm Signum Global Advisors, told Business Insider that foreign investment in oil, tourism, and construction will be the \"centerpiece\" of Venezuela's financial recovery going forward, adding that he expects the country's economy will grow \"faster over the next two years than people anticipate because of the extent or scale of foreign investment.\"\n\nMyers, also a former head of investment advisory firm Evercore, is planning a trip of 15-20 investors to visit Venezuela in March to identify investment opportunities. Signum Global Advisors has hosted similar trips for investor groups in Syria and Ukraine.\n\nBremmer, founder of the political risk research and consulting firm, Eurasia Group, in a post on LinkedIn, wrote that the \"US presumption is next Venezuelan leaders will now do what the Americans want because they've just seen the 'or else.'\"\n\nAccompanying the post was a photo of a drawing of a horse. The hindquarters of the horse were drawn in intricate detail, and labeled \"SOF operation to capture Maduro,\" referencing the special operations forces mission that was executed early Saturday. The horse's head was depicted as a rudimentary children's drawing, captioned \"plans for future of Venezuela.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't exactly call it a plan,\" Bremmer added.\n\nIn a separate post, he wrote: \"The law of the jungle is dangerous. What applies to your enemies one day can apply to you the next. Make no mistake where the world is heading here.\"\n\nThe billionaire hedge fund manager wrote in a post on X that \"The removal of Maduro will lower oil prices, which is good for America and very bad for Russia. A weaker Russian economy will increase the probability that the war in Ukraine ends sooner and on more favorable terms for Ukraine. And Putin will be sleeping in his safe room from this point going forward.\"\n\nGao is a senior fellow at the Center for International Governance Innovation and a law professor at Singapore Management University. In a series of posts on X, he said the raid on Caracas ushered in \"the brave new world of international law.\"\n\n\"Maduro's capture has triggered the biggest revival of international law since Grotius — and overnight turned everyone on X into an international law wonk, eager to compare Venezuela to Taiwan,\" he wrote.\n\n\"But China has never treated the Taiwan issue as a matter of international law,\" he continued. \"It has always been framed as an internal affair, with Taiwan regarded as a renegade province. The reason China has not acted is not because it lacks legal justification, but because it lacks the capability. Thus, US ops in Venezuela provide China with no additional legal justification.\"\n\nThe Democratic senator from Massachusetts is a former Harvard Law professor who holds deep expertise in bankruptcy and consumer finance. In a post on X, she wrote that Trump's action to seize Maduro, \"no matter how terrible a dictator he is — is unconstitutional and threatens to drag the US into further conflicts in the region.\"\n\n\"What does it mean that the US will 'run' Venezuela, and what will Trump do next around the world?\" Warren wrote. \"The American people voted for lower costs, not for Trump's dangerous military adventurism overseas that won't make the American people safer.\"\n\nThe Tesla and SpaceX CEO spent most of Saturday posting praise for the Trump administration and the military operations in Venezuela, posting that it was \"heartwarming to see so many Venezuelans celebrating their country freed from a brutal tyrant.\"\n\nIn another post, Musk retweeted a White House image of Maduro aboard the USS Iwo Jima after being apprehended, with the caption \"Congratulations, President Trump! This is a win for the world and a clear message to evil dictators everywhere.\"\n\nMusk and Trump have had a tumultuous relationship over the years, alternating between appearing to be close allies and trading sharp criticisms in the media.",

    "description": "New imagery obtained by Business Insider shows widespread damage at a military complex in the southern part of Caracas.",
    "fullText": "New satellite imagery shows damage at a military facility in Caracas after the US carried out strikes as part of a surprise operation to capture Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.\n\nThe new imagery, captured on Saturday by the US spatial intelligence firm Vantor and obtained by Business Insider, shows damage around the Venezuelan military complex at Fuerte Tiuna in the southern part of Caracas.\n\nFuerte Tiuna is a critical military installation in Venezuela. It houses defense ministries and major commands, official residences, and other major strategic infrastructure. It was a primary target of the US mission.\n\nThe new imagery reveals significant damage to military storage buildings and equipment at the complex, including several vehicles, as well as destroyed security buildings at a gate to the facility.\n\nPresident Donald Trump revealed earlier on Saturday that the US carried out a highly complex raid to capture Maduro and extract him from the country to face drug-related charges in New York. The White House in August had placed a $50 million bounty on his head.\n\nThe bold operation began late Friday night and continued into the early hours of the next day, with US military aircraft — including fighter jets, surveillance planes, bombers, and drones — striking Venezuela's air defenses to clear a path for apprehension forces to locate Maduro.\n\nVenezuela's government said US forces targeted military and civilian areas and strongly condemned the strikes. Video footage shared on social media showed helicopters above Caracas, with large explosions and plumes of smoke rising from the city.\n\nDan Caine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters in Florida that the apprehension team, which included US law enforcement officers, broke into Maduro's fortified compound under heavy fire and took the Venezuelan president and his wife into custody.\n\nSeveral American personnel were injured in the raid, Trump revealed, and one helicopter took a hit. However, no one was killed, he said, and the US didn't lose any equipment. Maduro was flown to the US Navy amphibious assault ship USS Iwo Jima ahead of his transfer to New York.\n\nThe mission — dubbed \"Operation Absolute Resolve\" — followed months of escalating tensions between Trump and the Maduro regime and dozens of US military strikes against alleged narcotics-smuggling boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific.\n\nPrior to the mission, the US had established a large military presence around the Caribbean, and Trump had repeatedly threatened to pursue targets in Venezuela.\n\nCaine said that the audacious operation involved months of meticulous planning and rehearsal. That included building a replica of Maduro's compound, similar to what US special operations forces did ahead of the 2011 Osama bin Laden raid.\n\nThe operation on Saturday marks a significant escalation in the Trump administration's pressure campaign, which also saw the US seize Venezuela-linked oil tankers while imposing a naval blockade targeting sanctioned vessels.\n\nThe strikes raise questions about the future of Venezuela's leadership. Trump said the US will run the country\" until it can ensure a safe transition of power, although it's unclear how Washington will do that.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, has been encouraging American oil companies to become involved in the Venezuelan oil industry.\n\nSome world leaders have reacted strongly to the operation, including some from countries near Venezuela, who criticized the mission. They were joined by some Democratic US lawmakers. Many Republicans voiced their support.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio explained to reporters in Florida on Saturday that the Trump administration did not notify Congress ahead of the operation and only informed members afterward. The president defended the decision.",

    "fullText": "Critical Role's chief creative officer, Matthew Mercer, had been spearheading his eight-member crew's relentless push into the big leagues of nerdworld for 10 years.\n\nThat was until this July, when he announced that he'd be giving up control of one of the crew's biggest priorities, their long-running \"Dungeons & Dragons\" Twitch livestream.\n\nIn an August appearance on the podcast \"Crispy's Tavern: Tales and Tea,\" Mercer said he'd felt the threat of burnout and thought he needed a break. He said he'd started to feel a \"continuous need to produce creatively,\" which was \"a very draining and very scary thing.\"\n\nTo be sure, Mercer and his seven cofounders still have a full slate of projects to work on. That includes an ongoing sold-out arena tour, as well as two Amazon-backed animated series on Prime Video. Mercer also has a key role in the team's game publishing arm, Darrington Press, home to \"Daggerheart,\" their flagship game and their answer to \"D&D.\"\n\nStill, Mercer says, it's important to be able to admit when you're done, and to give yourself permission to step away from the work for as long as you need to.\n\n\"My biggest advice for burnout is to acknowledge when you're at the edge and take every opportunity you can to step away and replenish your cup,\" Mercer told Business Insider.\n\nBrennan Lee Mulligan of \"Dimension 20\" fame, Mercer's longtime friend and collaborator, is the game master for Campaign Four, the team's ongoing \"D&D\" stream. Mulligan taking over the main stream means Mercer is no longer solely in charge of captaining the team's regular episodes, which often run to the four-hour mark.\n\n\"There's this concept, the idea that just pushing through and sometimes necessity requires you to do that to a certain point,\" Mercer said.\n\n\"But I find walking away and taking some time to enrich your creative input means that whatever time you lost beating your head against the wall will be more than made up for when you can return from a place of genuine inspiration and renewal,\" Mercer added.\n\nCampaign Four airs on Beacon, Critical Role's in-house streaming platform, as well as on Twitch and YouTube.",

    "fullText": "Aviation investigators are continuing to examine the cause of a deadly private jet crash that killed retired NASCAR driver Greg Biffle, his immediate family, and three others earlier this month in North Carolina.\n\nThe crash occurred around 10:15 a.m. on December 18, when a Cessna Citation 550 business jet owned by Biffle went down near Statesville Regional Airport shortly after takeoff. Seven people were killed, including Biffle, his wife Cristina, their children Emma and Ryder, family friends Craig Wadsworth and Dennis Dutton, and Dutton’s son, Jack.\n\nAccording to accounts from people familiar with the flight, the jet experienced a serious problem almost immediately after leaving the runway. Witnesses described a loud popping sound during takeoff, followed by the aircraft circling back toward the airport. Public flight data later showed the plane climbing sharply before turning back, with speed and altitude fluctuating as conditions worsened in low clouds and drizzle.\n\nThe aircraft ultimately struck light poles, clipped trees, and exploded less than a mile from the runway. No distress call was reported before the crash.\n\nFormer NASCAR driver Kenny Wallace, a close friend of Biffle, later shared his personal theory while acknowledging the investigation is ongoing. Wallace suggested the aircraft may have lost one engine during takeoff, creating excessive drag that prevented the pilots from maintaining control despite applying maximum power to the remaining engine.\n\nFederal officials confirmed the jet crashed while attempting to land, and both the Federal Aviation Administration and National Transportation Safety Board are investigating. The cockpit voice recorder has been recovered, though final conclusions could take many months.\n\nWeather conditions at the time included poor visibility, fog, and light drizzle. Aviation experts reviewing flight data have pointed to a possible single-engine failure combined with challenging visual conditions during the attempted return.\n\nDutton, one of the pilots, was a recently retired Delta Air Lines captain with four decades of aviation experience. His son Jack, an Auburn University student, had recently earned his FAA instrument rating and aspired to become a professional pilot.\n\nFamily members later revealed the group had been traveling to Florida for a birthday trip. The tragedy has deeply shaken the racing and aviation communities as investigators work to determine what went wrong in the flight’s final minutes.",

    "fullText": "Tesla ended a roller coaster year with its sales going into reverse.\n\nElon Musk's automaker said on Friday that it sold 418,227 electric vehicles in the fourth quarter, down by 15.6% from the same period in 2024.\n\nIt means Tesla's annual sales have declined for the second consecutive year, and that Chinese rival BYD has surpassed Tesla for the first time in annual sales of battery-electric vehicles.\n\nWall Street analysts were expecting the company to sell around 441,000 EVs, per data compiled by Bloomberg, while Tesla released its own, more pessimistic, analyst consensus forecast of 422,850 units in an unusual move earlier this week.\n\nBYD said on Thursday that sales of its battery-powered cars rose nearly 28% to 2.26 million units in 2025. Tesla said it delivered about 1.64 million vehicles for the year.\n\nTesla recorded its first-ever annual sales decline in 2024, after years of explosive growth. The latest figures suggest the company has been hit hard by the demise of the $7,500 tax credit for new EVs in September.\n\nThe looming deadline saw US buyers race to snap up electric vehicles, driving record sales for Tesla and other automakers.\n\nOnce the tax credit ended, however, EV sales dropped across the board, including at Tesla's rivals Ford, Hyundai, and Kia.\n\nThe slump saw Tesla's sales hit their lowest level since 2022 in November, despite the brand rolling out cheaper versions of its bestselling Model 3 and Y vehicles a month before.\n\nTesla has also faced difficulties this year in Europe and China, two of its biggest international markets.\n\nIn China, the EV giant has faced fierce competition from local rivals offering high-tech electric models at rock-bottom prices.\n\nTesla's sales have plummeted in Europe amid backlash over CEO Musk's endorsement of far-right German party AfD, with December registrations dropping 66% year-over-year in France and 44% in Spain, according to national auto association data.\n\nAnalysts previously told Business Insider that Tesla is also suffering from a stale product lineup. The company has not launched a new vehicle since the Cybertruck in 2023, and the divisive pickup has been a sales disappointment.\n\nDespite these headwinds, Tesla's stock price hit a record high in December as investors expressed optimism over the automaker's robotaxi rollout.\n\nTesla launched a robotaxi service in Austin in June and has ambitious plans to expand autonomous ride-hailing to multiple cities in the US this year.\n\nMusk has said the company's future lies in its robotaxi and Optimus robot initiatives, and the Austin-based automaker is preparing to begin mass production in April of its Cybercab robotaxi, which does not have a steering wheel or pedals.\n\nIn an earnings call in October, Musk said that the looming launch of Tesla's \"unsupervised\" Full Self-Driving software would boost demand for the company's vehicles, and told investors that the robotaxi service in Austin would operate without safety monitors by the end of 2025.\n\nMusk said on December 24 that he took a ride around Austin without a safety driver, but as of Wednesday, they were still sitting inside vehicles available to the public.",

It's about more than doing your laundry or squeezing in a workout, they said; it's about freedom.\n\nBetty Chen said she was tired of dealing with other people's egos. After corporate jobs at Autodesk and Cisco, Chen decided to go freelance before the pandemic. Now, the 49-year-old San Francisco resident does contract UX design and boards dogs in her home.\n\n\"I'm so much happier,\" Chen said. \"I did better working with animals, not doomscrolling. Touch grass.\"\n\nChen also enjoys not having to put on makeup. \"As a woman going into the office, there's another half hour of maintenance,\" she said.\n\nThose who chose the in-person option say that flexibility comes at the cost of organizational performance. American Edge Project CEO Doug Kelly said that there was a \"chemistry\" to bringing people together.\n\n\"I would rather pay people more to be on-site working with me,\" the 60-year-old Columbus, Ohio resident said. \"It increases the product that the company is making and the creativity overall.\"\n\nDominic Sharlette agreed: \"You have to be in the office to get great products made.\"\n\nSharlette is a 59-year-old health tech worker based in New York. He works five days in-person, and said he is happy that way. Jobs like customer service could be done remotely, he said, but work that's \"pushing innovation\" must be done face-to-face.\n\nThen there's the salary question. The prompt offered double the pay — $240,000 compared to $120,000 — for in-person attendance. For some, the money was enough.\n\nJennifer Rasmussen, a 44-year-old logistics worker from Fargo, North Dakota, likes her fully remote job. As she called me, her golden retrievers lay next to her. But the perks of $240,000 were too strong not to influence her vote.\n\n\"The quality of life for my entire family would improve with a salary at that level,\" she said.\n\nRasmussen's kids are still young. The money would help her family travel internationally or hire childcare and cleaning help. She could also save more money for retirement, she said.\n\nAmy Leonard, a 42-year-old community college teacher from San Jose, California, said she would choose the virtual job so she could move elsewhere. The Bay Area has a notoriously high cost of living. Leonard said that most of her money now went to basic expenses, such as gas and food.\n\n\"I could definitely take that, move somewhere else, and probably own a house instead of having to rent,\" Leonard said.\n\nIn her debate-sparking TikTok, influencer Tinx said that she could immediately guess the generation of the individual consider the half-salary remote option: Gen Z.\n\nIn the video, Tinx said that time in the office could do Gen Z some good. \"It'll make you all less weird,\" she said.\n\nPriya Chaudhari, a 20-year-old student at the University of Georgia, said that much of her generation actually preferred to be in-person. The in-office push was a \"rebound\" from an adolescence on screens, she said. Chaudhari and some of her friends have chosen to get off social media.\n\nChaudhari said she would opt for the $240,000 salary, citing the pay difference and her own extroversion. \"I really thrive off working with other people,\" she said.\n\nPedro Ochoa posed the question to his four-person team. The 45-year-old manager of business intelligence said the team was split generationally, with the younger colleagues opting for higher pay and the older colleagues choosing the remote work role.\n\nYounger workers see \"very hard outcomes for their careers,\" the Dallas resident said, so they want to claim as much income and experience as they can while they're still employed. Older workers care more about raising their families, he said.\n\nOchoa put himself in the latter camp. He'd take the remote option.",

    "title": "5 of the most popular stories from Business Insider's year-long series on America's oldest workers",
    "description": "Check out five of Business Insider's most popular stories from its year-long series on America's oldest workers, titled 80 Over 80.",
    "fullText": "A 90-year-old working as a cook at a convenience store. A 93-year-old applying for jobs. An 81-year-old who had to leave her Home Depot job early because she struggled to breathe. These are among the most impactful stories of Business Insider's 80 over 80 series.\n\nBusiness Insider spent most of 2025 interviewing Americans in their 80s and beyond who are still working. We followed hundreds of older workers across the country as they navigated rising costs, health challenges, perceived ageism, and changing ideas about what work and retirement are supposed to look like.\n\nReaders responded strongly to these stories, and we received hundreds of notes from people of all ages sharing their perspectives on the issues the series explored. Many shared their own experiences with working late into their careers, highlighting the value of work and the challenges of clocking in each day. Others who were much younger shared that the stories gave them a new perspective on aging and preparing for retirement.\n\nHere are five of the stories that resonated the most — ones readers spent the most time with and shared widely. Together, they offer a revealing look at what readers were most eager to learn about when it comes to working late in life.\n\nLydia Hinds, now 82, wrote to me back in 2024 about how she worked part-time at Home Depot after a series of mistakes and unfortunate events. Her business closed at the start of the pandemic, and much of her and her husband's money never came back after the 2008 recession. She also said she had heart failure, which made her job much more challenging. Lydia's daughter doesn't speak with her, and they had no other people to rely on financially.\n\nOver the course of a few months, I got to know Lydia and her husband, Bill, before making the three-hour trip to central Connecticut, where I spent two days with them. I shadowed Lydia at work and spoke with her coworkers, ate dinner with them at their home, and drove with Bill to a doctor's appointment. I was joined by a photographer, who captured them in their moments of vulnerability, joy, and uncertainty.\n\nThe story resonated far and wide. Leading experts in the aging and retirement space reached out to share their praise, calling the story \"magnificent\" and \"heartbreaking.\" Dozens of workers in similar situations shared their stories candidly. Younger readers wrote to me that they hoped to never be in her situation.\n\nSince the article came out, Lydia stopped working for Home Depot as her condition worsened and has invested most of her time in founding an online business selling funny gift cards, bags, and clothes.\n\nI first connected with Patricia Willson, now 94, in August. Over multiple phone calls, we spoke for hours about her life in Eureka Springs, Arkansas, a small tourist town in the Ozark Mountains. I visited her for two days in September with a photographer so I could see how she lived, what applying to jobs looked like at 93, and how work and severe health challenges intermingled.\n\nPoignant scenes from that trip — her having her leg wrapped by her nurse, sitting at her computer editing her cover letter, and showing me her mother's bible — illustrated Willson's fight to stay as healthy as she could while trying to find another income source.\n\nThe article resonated with readers who were themselves struggling with health issues while traversing the difficult job market. Willson's story, along with a half dozen others featured in the article, sparked discussions online about what went wrong such that people in their 80s and 90s have to work while battling cancer, lymphedema, back issues, or heart failure. This story was particularly popular among readers in their 50s and 60s, some of whom feared they would face similar challenges.\n\nThis popular story was our main foray into data analysis for the series. For the first time in the media, we broke down the demographics of America's oldest workers, along with the industries and occupations they work in. The results were somewhat surprising — working at schools was the most common industry, though construction was second. Thousands of workers were truck drivers, retail salespeople, personal care aides, and farmers.\n\nThis oldest workforce, which continues to grow, is very diverse, and many readers were shocked by the number of workers still going into their 80s and 90s. Some readers remarked that the data suggested older workers were much more valuable in certain industries than they may have imagined. Many also remarked that it will be less rare in a few years to see people working at 85.\n\nThis was the most popular story of the series, written as a personal essay as told to a reporter. Richard Smith, 81, had reached out to share his story about \"work camping,\" which is when people take on work while living in RVs or campers. In Smith's case, he found work at a campsite in New Hampshire for half the year; the other half of the year, he lives in Florida. He supplements his income by driving for DoorDash.\n\nSmith was able to follow his passions while needing to work for financial reasons. The lifestyle in many ways is cheaper than the daily costs of living in a house, but in some ways, it was a forced decision, as he didn't save enough for retirement.\n\nMany readers were surprised that at 81, Smith was working seven days a week and living out of his motor coach. Some readers applauded his creativity and his nontraditional living situation, with some writing that they would consider work camping for themselves. Others said his story put them at ease, as he was able to make life work with limited assets. A few readers commented that they viewed his optimism as inspiring, as he had many options if his health or finances went further south.\n\nThis story on Vince Scidone, now 91, blew up in the days after it was posted in early September. Scidone, a former carpenter, works part-time for a convenience store chain in Oklahoma, earning $14.90 an hour as a cook. He is on his feet for much of the day in the job, which was one of the only ones he could find when he started looking last year after months of rejections.\n\nWhat readers grasped onto about Scidone's story was how, at 89, he began applying for jobs after his wife got sick. Since she could no longer work, Scidone said the extra income was necessary for helping them stay afloat after a recent home purchase. His health hasn't interfered too much with his job.\n\nReaders found it compelling that Scidone was so positive about his situation, even though he wishes he could retire and never have to worry about money. Some were heartbroken by how he felt guilty for not having a lot of money to pass down to their children and grandchildren. As with many readers, Scidone spoke about his situation while in a state of limbo, where he plays every day by ear. His uncertainty, and his grit, stayed with readers, as some attested to in emails.",

    "fullText": "The must-read story in the $5 trillion hedge fund industry used to be about who made the biggest trade or launched the biggest fund. Now it's about who made the biggest hire or got the biggest guaranteed payout.\n\nAs the increasingly institutional space has veered away from star funds run by a single genius to sprawling investment platforms with dozens of investing teams, the industry has grappled with a shortage of talent.\n\nIt's now such a finite resource that top portfolio managers are commanding deals that resemble those of professional athletes, and top managers accustomed to poaching their choice of talent by paying top dollar are now developing more talent in-house to cut expenses.\n\nBusiness Insider has closely covered the evolution of hedge funds. See our stories below on the state of play, how the industry is changing, and who the new stars are as a result.\n\nThe numbers are staggering, with guaranteed nine-figure payouts and yearslong non-compete clauses, but the anecdotes of what it's like inside the biggest funds are just as startling.\n\nBig-name funds churn through underperformers, giving PMs \"moment-by-moment paranoia,\" according to one former investor. Firms dangle potential relocation to tax havens like Puerto Rico and Dubai to entice top traders. Recruiters are being pushed into ethical gray areas to determine the truth about potential hires.\n\nWhenever this much money is flowing, there's bound to be ripple effects. Within hedge funds, this means the introduction of both new industry players and new roles within the largest firms.\n\nAs with any gold rush, people are picking up an ax in the hopes of carving out a little piece for themselves. It's up to the powers-that-be of the industry to decide what's real and what's fool's gold.\n\nOne subset of the industry that has been thrust into the spotlight during the talent is the individuals who find top PMs.\n\nRecruiters and business development professionals at the industry's biggest managers have seen their own worth soar in recent years. With a steady flow of fresh capital into hedge funds, this cohort is likely to remain in demand for years to come.",

    "title": "Inside BCG's AI product assembly line: 'Every company has to become a tech company'",
    "description": "Scott Wilder, a partner at BCG, went in-depth with Business Insider on how the firm is shifting from services to AI-driven products.",
    "fullText": "When it comes to creating AI tools, Boston Consulting Group is \"all in,\" Scott Wilder, a Dallas-based partner at the firm, told Business Insider.\n\nAbout 15 months ago, the firm launched an internal research and development lab — one of several ways in which it is developing new AI-based technology to facilitate its work.\n\n\"Every company has to become a tech company,\" he said. \"BCG is no exception.\"\n\nEver since OpenAI unveiled ChatGPT in 2022, generative AI has become the shiny object companies can't ignore. And consulting firms from McKinsey to BCG — once known for their strategy and advisory services — are shifting more toward building, implementing, and maintaining AI tools for clients.\n\nWilder, who studied computer science at the University of Texas - Austin, said that \"as a computer scientist, it's fascinating to see a services firm shift this way.\"\n\nAt BCG, generative AI innovation now happens at three levels, Wilder said.\n\nFirst, there's the data level, which is driven by data engineers. \"We're in a phase where we're really starting to leverage our internal proprietary data,\" Wilder said.\n\nWilder said BCG is building MCP servers and agents on top of its internal and selected public data sources so AI tools can automatically pull the right information at the right time — a shift he sees as the future of AI, where model intelligence is increasingly tied to knowing which data to use and when.\n\nThen there is a \"middle layer\" of innovation that comes from consultants building tools and agents for client projects, Wilder said. When one of these tools is a hit, it goes back to the R&D team, which integrates them into a central marketplace for the rest of the firm to use.\n\nLastly, there's a top layer of executives developing firm-wide tools.\n\nThese include Deckster, a slideshow editor trained on 800 to 900 slide templates that helps consultants quickly create presentations, which also has its own development team. There's also Ava, an internal help tool for IT issues, HR questions, and other internal requests. There's also GENE, a conversational chatbot the firm uses for presentations, podcasts, and publicity initiatives.\n\nWilder said the firm has about seven or eight tools at the top level.\n\nThe firm also has a team of \"forward-deployed consultants\" — a role inspired by the forward-deployed engineers popularized by Palantir — who are vibe-coding and building tools for clients, Wilder said.\n\n\"We put our best of the best globally on cases, and they build reusable things. That then goes back to the R&D team,\" he said. \"So we're seeing a lot of innovation happen from that. A lot of it has to happen at the rock face, on the case teams, versus centrally.\"\n\nThese consultants rely on a mix of external coding platforms and internal resources to build tools, including OpenAI's ChatGPT. BCG bills itself as the No. 1 creator of custom GPTs globally, and has created about 36,000 so far, Wilder said.\n\nSimultaneously, the firm's new R&D team works on disseminating these innovations internally.\n\nWhen the R&D team launched about 15 months ago, its mandate was to build knowledge graphs from the firm's slide decks, transcripts, and other internal documents. Knowledge graphs are typically used to organize and connect data across multiple sources. So, with a meeting transcript, for example, the R&D team would aim to extract not just words, but also concepts and sentiments, Wilder said.\n\nNow, the team works on fleshing out ideas that consultants working with clients on the front lines generate.\n\nWilder said that new tools are also screened by BCG's red teaming team, which simulates adversarial exercises to address a tool's security vulnerabilities. It is also reviewed by the data protection office to ensure compliance with data privacy laws, undergoes a legal review, and is assessed for information security.\n\nOnce it's ready, it's passed on to the firm's marketplace team, which integrates it into a central repository of tools for the rest of the firm to use, Wilder said. \"There's actually an agent,\" he said. \"This orchestration agent, basically, helps people understand what are the best tools and data within BCG to use.\"\n\nWilder said the firm prides itself on a \"bottom-up\" approach to innovation. \"Probably 80% of our custom GPTs come from the front line,\" he said.\n\nThe new ideas also surface through the firm's \"enablement network.\" This is a team of about a thousand people from every department, from human resources to legal, that functions like learning and development coordinators, training the rest of the firm on AI.\n\nThey also double as \"our eyes and ears,\" Wilder said.\n\nThe team meets monthly to share ideas and insights they've gathered through their work with various teams.\n\nBCG now operates much like a traditional product organization, Wilder said.\n\nBetween its dedicated product teams and a \"UX Center of Excellence,\" which constantly evaluates what's working and identifies which agents still need to be built through frontline user research, BCG feeds those insights back to product owners, who then funnel the feedback into a centralized crowdsourcing pipeline.\n\n\"In short,\" Wilder said, \"we're doing all the things you'd expect a product organization to do.\"",

    "title": "The proposals NYC business leaders say they can live with under Zohran Mamdani, according to his CEO whisperer",
    "description": "Yasser Salem has built a business council to advise Mamdani if he wins. The McKinsey alum explains that bosses are open to free childcare.",
    "fullText": "Editor's note: This piece originally ran on November 4, 2025, ahead of Zohran Mamdani's electoral win. We are resharing the story on January 1, when he will be sworn in as mayor of New York City.\n\nIf you read the tabloids, the eve of a potential Zohran Mamdani mayorality has turned Billionaire's Row into 1975 Saigon, with everyone looking to hitch the last flight to Palm Beach.\n\nTo put it more bluntly, the city's wealthiest and most powerful business leaders have some qualms with Mamdani's socialist platform.\n\nHowever, the story is not so simple, says Yasser Salem, a former McKinsey executive building a business council to advise Mamdani if he wins the mayoral election. Sure, the word socialism can cause some tension, Salem, the head of OneNYC, a pro-Mamdani PAC, said, but there are some surprising areas of overlap.\n\nSome, like Jamie Dimon, have softened their message in public as they've gotten to know the candidate. Similarly, in conversations with more than 70 CEOs, Salem told Business Insider that some platform planks, such as universal childcare, are acceptable to many in the city's business community.\n\n\"Some of them have said from the beginning that they understand policies like free childcare as a way to lower the burden of worry, concern, and issues that their employees have that prevent them from being productive at work,\" Salem said. Others took more time, but the affordability crisis is unavoidable.\n\nAccording to a recent study of public data released by his PAC, the average New York family spends over 25% of its income on care for just one child. The group proposes several public-private models for childcare, including some where the costs are shared by the government and the employer — an idea, Salem said, that has \"widespread support.\"\n\nBusiness leaders' main concerns aren't surprising: Mamdani's public safety plans will make the city less safe, and housing proposals will exacerbate the city's housing crisis.\n\nHowever, even in housing, there are areas of agreement, Salem said.\n\nBusiness leaders criticized Mamdani's plan to freeze the rent for rent-stabilized apartments, arguing it would worsen shortages, noting that Mayor de Blasio had tried rent freezes that failed to address the long-term crisis.\n\nStill, both sides agree the long-term fix is boosting supply, Salem said.\n\nThe difference between the business community and Mamdani is in their time horizon. Mamdani's rent-freeze message could help lower rents now and satisfy voters, while his plans for zoning reform and building 200,000 \"truly-affordable\" apartments can solve the deeper problem over time.\n\n\"Are we solving for rent prices going down in four years? Are we solving for rent prices going down today?\" said Salem. \"Because if you're solving for rent prices going down today, supply is not going to do it.\"\n\nAs far as public safety, Salem said the announcement that Mamdani would seek to keep Jessica Tisch on as NYPD commissioner has helped alleviate fears that the city would become more dangerous under Mayor Mamdani.\n\nBusiness leaders also wanted to know how Mamdani's new Department of Community Safety, which would deploy civilian mental health responders to subway stations and to answer some emergency calls, would work.\n\n\"For example, a McDonald's owner in a tough neighborhood gets somebody coming in causing trouble,\" Salem said. \"Do they call 911 and get a mental health worker rather than a police officer?\"\n\nThe answer, Salem told Business Insider, is that these changes will be \"additive\" and that mental health workers will join \"alongside, not replacing the officers on the scene.\"\n\nSurprisingly, he said, taxes don't come up as a big fear. CEOs told them they're willing to pay more if they \"feel that New York is a better place to live as a result.\"\n\nThe announcement that Tisch was staying on helped alleviate some of the more intangible fears of the city's business elite, too, said Salem, such as Mamdani's inexperience or his ideological commitments to socialism, or to the pro-Palestine cause.\n\nAnd Salem, who doesn't consider himself a socialist but instead a \"pro-responsible capitalist,\" also said that he would try to get CEOs to focus on their specific disagreements with Mamdani's policies, rather than focusing on \"labels\" like socialism.\n\nSalem tells CEOs that Mamdani is looking to expand the social safety net, not expropriate their wealth.\"He's not saying we're going to go from the corporate tax rate being 25% to being 75%,\" Salem said.",

    "title": "How Google, Microsoft, Walmart, and other corporate giants are preparing for an aging workforce",
    "description": "Business Insider reached out to more than 75 major employers, including Walmart and Google, about their efforts to support aging workers.",
    "fullText": "Corporate America is facing a silver tsunami — and some companies are better prepared than others.\n\nWalmart is redesigning jobs to keep older workers on the payroll. Microsoft is offering what it calls \"wraparound care\" to support healthy aging. Google is coaching its employees to prepare for retirement. Some smaller companies have introduced chief longevity officers to help workers navigate health, wellness, and the transition into retirement.\n\nThese are some of the initiatives companies shared with Business Insider, after we contacted more than 75 major employers about their efforts to support aging workers.\n\nFifteen responded and shared policies that address healthcare and well-being, career longevity, flexible work arrangements, and retention. Many of the companies contacted employ thousands of people working past retirement age. Most didn't respond or declined to comment.\n\nAt Walmart, the largest private employer in the US, about 13.3% of the workforce — or over 200,000 employees — is over 60 years old, and more than 300,000 employees have a tenure of more than 10 years.\n\n\"We want to be a great place to work during every stage of life,\" a spokesperson said. \"People come here for a first job or a second career, and we have associates from 16 to 100.\"\n\nThomas Magnuson, 83, has worked as a yard driver at a Walmart facility in Wisconsin since 1999. A few years ago, he transitioned to an asset protection position, where he monitors fire systems and recertifies employees who use certain equipment. Magnuson said he doesn't have enough savings to retire. He described the work, which pays low six figures, as fulfilling.\n\nRuth Finkelstein, a professor of public health at Hunter College, said employers should provide mentorship and flexibility to workers of all ages.\n\n\"People reach their peak earnings in their 50s and then gradually decrease after that until they abruptly decrease after retirement,\" Finkelstein said. \"We should have retirement security adequate to meet people's needs without them having to work for their whole lives, and we should have legislation that's much stronger than that against employment discrimination.\"\n\nSome of the biggest names in the retail, entertainment, and food sectors have proposed age-friendly policies and initiatives to support older workers.\n\nCVS Health has developed programs to attract mature workers and develop their skills. Many of Disney's employees are in their second or third career, said Tami Garcia, executive vice president of people and culture at Disney Experiences. The company gives out the Walt Disney Legacy Award and holds service anniversary ceremonies.\n\n\"For many, having a role at one of our Disney parks is a second or even third career, and we deeply value the experience, wisdom, and mentorship that can bring,\" Garcia said. \"From celebrating milestone anniversaries — including 50+ years of service — to honoring those who embody Walt Disney's legacy through our recognition programs, we showcase respect, care, and appreciation for our Cast Members.\"\n\nSome companies have prioritized certain accommodations, such as flexible work schedules. A Starbucks spokesperson told Business Insider that the company's \"Back to Starbucks\" strategy has invested over $500 million in operational improvements and the workplace experience, which could benefit older workers looking for more flexibility. The spokesperson said that 85% of employees receive their preferred shifts.\n\nEllen Ernst Kossek, a professor at Purdue University who studies work-life relationships, said companies should consider reducing the workloads of older employees, helping these workers adapt to new technologies, and finding ways to challenge age-related stereotypes.\n\n\"There's a stereotype that older workers are not as current, but just as you would train new workers or encourage people to get a certificate, they could adapt their strategies to look for people with AI skills and encourage people to keep their skills up,\" Kossek said.\n\nSome companies told Business Insider that they've adopted certain benefits, such as greater access to medical care, which may help older workers stay healthy and avoid early retirement due to medical issues.\n\nThis can be beneficial to both companies and their workers. Older workers can increase corporate healthcare costs, since the majority of people aged 65 and older have a chronic disease, said Dr. Susan Mueller, senior director of health equity and well-being at global advisory firm WTW.\n\nWalgreens offers benefits for \"balancing work with caregiving responsibilities, preparing for retirement, or seeking proactive health and financial well-being support,\" a spokesperson said. UnitedHealth Group provides legal services for estate planning and family law, and supports workers navigating menopause or cancer diagnoses.\n\nA Google spokesperson said the company gives employees access to financial coaching for retirement and personalized assistance for managing caregiving. The company offers benefits such as cancer testing and support, no-cost medical second opinions, and no-cost virtual primary care.\n\nA Microsoft spokesperson emphasized the company's paid time off for caregiving for loved ones with a serious illness and wraparound care to support healthy aging.\n\nFedEx has launched comprehensive medical benefits and support networks, such as its Choose Well Care Connect advocacy program, which guides members through life-altering diagnoses. FedEx launched a Fast Pass in certain markets to guarantee members a primary care appointment within 10 days or less. The company's corporate responsibility report notes that FedEx is testing home health capabilities in areas with limited healthcare opportunities.\n\nTopics like AI and climate change are garnering more attention in corporate America than the aging workforce, according to a Business Insider analysis of earnings calls, 10-Ks, and interviews.\n\nThat's a concern to some experts on aging, who say companies need to be doing more to prepare for shifting demographics.\n\nMueller said companies should develop programs that control costs for employees needing medical assistance; establish internal guidelines to help employees navigate the healthcare system; add virtual primary care; and hire external companies specializing in common medical conditions.\n\nMadonna Harrington Meyer, a sociology professor at Syracuse University, said that during economically hard times, older workers are often the first to be laid off and the last to be rehired.\n\nHarrington Meyer said companies should focus on accessibility and safety. They should arrange parking spots near office entrances, ensure good lighting and soundproofing for sensory needs, and maintain functional elevators.\n\nGraham Pearce, global defined benefit segment leader at the consulting firm Mercer, said some companies will need to confront an\"unconscious bias\" against older workers — often seen as less adaptable or more prone to illness. Progress may require legislative action, he said.\n\nThe bipartisan Protect Older Job Applicants Act was introduced in September to prohibit age-based applicant sorting for employers, ensure \"disparate impact\" protections apply to employees and applicants, and require government oversight on age discrimination claims.\n\nRep. Bobby Scott, a Democrat from Virginia who co-led the bill, told Business Insider that he hopes age discrimination will be considered \"as illegal as discrimination based on race, color, creed, national origin, or sex.\" He added that if more people have employment opportunities later in life, it could stimulate the economy and help people age with dignity.\n\nIn September, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, a Democrat from New York, introduced the bipartisan Protecting Older Americans Act, which would end forced arbitration clauses prohibiting victims of age discrimination from suing their employer.\n\n\"We know that forced arbitration often discriminates against the plaintiff, and for a lot of older Americans, they don't have the resources to mount significant litigations against an employer who discriminates against them,\" Gillibrand told Business Insider. \"We believe that if you have the right of the Constitution to go to a trial and to be judged by your peers, older Americans would do better in these lawsuits.\"\n\nIn a statement to Business Insider, Sen. Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat from Wisconsin, said that the separate Protecting Older Workers Against Discrimination Act would help level the playing field for older workers and combat age discrimination.\n\n\"We need to do more to make sure that every American can plan and save for a secure retirement, but as more and more of our neighbors are forced to work later in life just to make ends meet, we need to make sure everyone — regardless of their age — has protections and dignity in the workplace,\" Baldwin said.",

    "title": "I cover side hustles and started my own in 2025. Here's the best business advice I heard all year.",
    "description": "Among the flood of advice I've received, read, and reported on in 2025, here's what stuck with me the most.",
    "fullText": "There's an overwhelming amount of business advice out there.\n\nI hear a lot of it, by nature of my reporting and asking successful entrepreneurs what they wished they'd done differently, or what they'd tell prospective founders. Ever since starting my own business selling pickleball paddles — inspired by the plethora of Amazon sellers I interview — I hear even more (often unsolicited) advice. Everyone has something to say.\n\nAmong the flood of advice I've received, read, and reported on in 2025, here's what stuck with me the most.\n\nI know it sounds clichéd to \"follow your passion,\" but if you're starting a business — especially as a side hustle — you don't want it to feel like work. You don't want it to feel like a pesky chore, because it's what you'll be doing at the end of your workday on a Wednesday night, or at the start of your weekend on a Saturday morning.\n\nEven when you're not dedicating time to the business, it has a way of seeping into your shower thoughts or preventing you from falling asleep at night. If something is going to take up so much space, it might as well be something you care about.\n\nMy business partner and I weren't always going to sell pickleball paddles. That idea came from a conversation with a top Amazon seller, whom we consulted in the ideation stage. He encouraged us to think about our interests and how we generally spend our time. \"What do you like? What are you good at?\" he asked us. \"Start there.\"\n\nAs former collegiate tennis players, it seemed obvious that we should incorporate racket sports in our e-commerce business — and I'm so glad we did, because if we were selling kitchen utensils or candles or something we didn't know anything about or care much for, I doubt we'd still be plugging away after a year of learning lessons and lackluster sales. But we are. We believe in our product, and we're having fun trying to move inventory. Rather than feeling burned out, we feel energized.\n\nFigure out what you want, identify someone who already has it, and ask them — politely — for a bit of their time. Then, ask questions. Get curious. This is good, general life and business advice that frequently comes up in interviews with people across all industries. I never tire of it.\n\nWhy try to do everything on your own when you can potentially learn from someone else's mistakes and fast-track your path to success?\n\nIn addition to seeking out mentors, put yourself in the same room — virtual or physical — as people with similar goals. I've heard it over and over again: Who you hang around matters.\n\n\"Networking event\" or \"conference\" doesn't sound particularly fun or exciting, especially to an introvert. Despite reporting on the benefits of attending such events, I had never bought in — until earlier this year, when I spent 10 hours at a conference for real estate investors pursuing financial independence.\n\nI wrote about what it was like being in a room with hundreds of like-minded investors, describing it as \"powerful,\" and mentioning three main takeaways:\n\nOne, you learn — from people who are more successful than you.\n\nTwo, you connect — with people who could become your business partner, mentor, or client.\n\nThree, you gain momentum — perhaps just enough to inspire a key pivot, or take your first step into business, or simply keep the fire burning.\n\nI love an underdog story. Who doesn't? I appreciate grit, and I also believe the underrated, chip-on-your-shoulder mindset can be an asset. Just look at Stephen Curry, who was largely overlooked at the college level before blossoming into an NBA MVP.\n\nOr, to keep things more relevant, consider Kyle Ray. He's a college dropout I spoke with earlier this year who turned his window cleaning side hustle into a six-figure business that services hundreds of clients across Texas.\n\nHe told me that he didn't do great in school and, from a young age, his teachers tried to convince him that \"the best you can hope for is to be a manager of a restaurant.\" Rather than capitulating, he used their declaration as fuel. \"That's just been an internal driver, like, 'I'm going to prove this person wrong.'\"\n\nPeople will tell you that your idea is bad or that it won't work. \"The pickleball space is too competitive,\" one naysayer told me. \"I wouldn't want to be in your shoes!\" said another.\n\nRather than letting unproductive feedback discourage you, use it as motivation. It's fun being an underdog with something to prove. It's also really difficult. Underdog status or not, building a profitable, lasting business takes time, effort, and perhaps even a stroke of luck or two. It's often a series of many small steps over the course of many months and years that lead to success worthy of a feature in a news publication.\n\nI'm hyper-aware that for every successful entrepreneur I interview, there are 100 who have failed. But I'm also aware that you won't have a chance if you don't at least try.",

    "fullText": "Along with the sudden shutdowns of commercial airlines including Play and Blue Islands, a number of charter and fractional carriers also filed for bankruptcy in 2025.\n\nFlorida-based Verijet and Montana charter carrier Corporate Air both initiated bankruptcy proceedings at the same time in October, while Alaska-based Kenai Aviation followed just a few weeks later with a total shutdown of operations in November.\n\nThe charter airline connected hubs like Anchorage and Fairbanks with smaller communities in Kenai, Homer, and Seward.\n\n\"We need capital, we need partners, we need a lifeline,\" owner Joel Caldwell wrote in November. \"That investor is out there, we just need to find them.\"\n\nThe latest airline to submit a Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing is Greensboro-based Jet It. Although the carrier once running charter and fractional flights has not operated since shutting down all operations in 2023, the Dec. 24 filing in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware is a final step in a story that ultimately ends in liquidation.\n\nContrary to a Chapter 11 filing with intent to restructure, a Chapter 7 bankruptcy asks a judge to skip that step and go straight to liquidation. The filing shows that the airline, which launched in 2022 by selling fractional ownership to HondaJet flights, ran up more than $36.2 million in liabilities, including $9.7 million in unsecured claims.\n\nA fractional airline operates by selling shares to a private jet. These are doled out by giving customers a set number of hours they can use to request flights run by the airline's crew.\n\nAt the time it launched, Jet It advertised rates of $1,600 an hour while operating more than 18,000 flight hours a year. Despite the airline once being the 12th-largest private jet operator in the U.S., Jet It also ran up significant debts, given the high cost of jet fuel and a customer base that petered out over time.\n\nThe largest creditor remains World Fuel Services, to which Jet It owes $735,695, according to the filing. American Express is owed over $600,000, while smaller creditors include PIC Card Services LLC and Jetex Flight Services.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway unit FlightSafety claims it was never paid $400,981 for pilot training services enlisted by the airline.\n\nMajor airline launches surprising flight between Las Vegas and Paris\n\nUnited Airlines CEO gives stark warning on Olympic Games\n\nThe highest rooftop in Barcelona is in a surprising place\n\nUS government issues sudden warning on Switzerland travel",
