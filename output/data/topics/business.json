    "description": "Tahmina Watson's law firm assists with employment visas. She advises all visa holders with a valid stamp to return to the US immediately.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Tahmina Watson, a business immigration lawyer in Seattle. Business Insider has verified Watson's employment history with documentation. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI'm a business immigration lawyer, and in my day-to-day work with clients, I'm seeing immigration disruptions with immediate consequences, including H-1B visa holders who are outside the US being uncertain if they can return.\n\n​​My law firm, Watson Immigration Law, assists founders and businesses in navigating the employment visa application process. It appears that, at this time, the administration is coordinating the rescheduling and delay of immigration appointments.\n\nNon-immigrant visas generally must be scheduled at a US embassy or consulate in the person's country of nationality or residence. From my experience, many employees accrue their holiday time and schedule immigration appointments during this period because they're already planning to leave the country, allowing them to easily visit their designated US embassy or consulate.\n\nThese employees are now getting stuck, having already left the US, with their appointments getting rescheduled for June, July, or August 2026, and beyond.\n\nMajor tech companies, including Google, Apple, and Microsoft, sent memos out to their employees in the past week, warning visa-holding employees to avoid international travel amid long delays at US consulates. These policies are coming one after another, and they all intersect with each other.\n\nIf somebody is outside the country, what are employers supposed to do? Right now, my advice to clients outside the country is that if they have a valid visa stamp, they should return to the US as soon as possible.\n\nFor someone who has left the country to obtain a new visa stamp, I'm not sure there's a clear path to return. This includes individuals on F-1 student visas who traveled to visit family and were planning to re-enter the US. They will need that visa stamp from a consulate.\n\nEnsure your employment is still active and consider whether remote work is an option. If an employer decides they cannot keep someone on the books, even an appointment months from now will not help if there's no job waiting.\n\nIt's tough to know how things will unfold. What we're seeing is a confluence of policies coming in at the same time. For example, the Department of Homeland Security has just announced that it is replacing the lottery system for H-1B work visas, which randomly selects who receives a visa. The system is now set to prioritize higher-paid, higher-skilled workers.\n\nSocial media disclosure is being expanded from F-1 visa holders, which began during the student visa crisis, to now include H-1B workers. These applicants are required to change all social media privacy settings to public.\n\nIt could easily expand to other visa categories. The government has not provided clear guidance on what they are reviewing. By casting an overly broad net under the banner of national security, without clear standards or transparency, the administration is creating uncertainty that will ripple across families, employers, and the US economy.\n\nClients should limit what they post online.\n\nIn 2024, I was already anticipating these issues with traveling and returning to the US. We've also seen issues affecting green card holders with past criminal convictions.\n\nThere are many stories of people who have lived in the US for decades, suddenly facing deportation proceedings. This is a highly precarious time for immigrants, and limiting travel is critical.\n\nIt feels like a fire hose of policies. Everyone in the immigrant ecosystem is on high alert: Immigration lawyers, immigrants, employers, investors, founders, and employees.",

    "title": "A Father, a Son and Their $108B Push for Media Moguldom (Larry Ellison)",
    "description": "Larry and David Ellison didn’t always have a close relationship. Now they’re one of the most intriguing partnerships in business.",
    "fullText": "Theodore Schleifer writes about billionaires in America.\n\nWhen David Ellison became a teenager, his father, Larry, bought him a gift not usually bestowed on a 13th birthday: his own Katana stunt plane. The two had spent little meaningful time together. But with their own aircraft, the father and son could bond in the air, practicing aerobatic flips and ruling the skies together.\n\nNow, Larry Ellison is trying to help buy his son a media empire so they can rule Hollywood and news together.\n\nWhat was once a relatively weak father-and-son relationship has transformed into one of modern media’s most intriguing business partnerships. Towering behind almost every move made by David Ellison, now 42 and the chief executive of Paramount, is his swaggering 81-year-old father, the billionaire co-founder of the software giant Oracle.\n\nThe two have formed an unusual tag team in their pursuit of major media deals, according to more than two dozen people with knowledge of their interactions. They bought Paramount this summer, and now they are hunting Warner Bros. Discovery with a $108 billion hostile bid.\n\nOn Monday, David Ellison made it clearer than ever that his father is the centerpiece of this bid, telling Warner Bros. that Larry Ellison personally guaranteed $40.4 billion for Paramount’s offer. David Ellison has referred to the deal as something “we” — or “the Ellison family” — were pursuing. Both have sought to arm-twist Warner executives.\n\nFather and son speak about five times a week — sometimes about their tennis matches or their joint philanthropy at the University of Oxford. But these days, often the topic is deal-making. David Ellison consults his father at length on every deal-related decision, one person with knowledge of their interactions said.\n\nThey discuss how to navigate President Trump, whose administration must approve any major acquisition. Larry Ellison has taken the lead in making the case to the president for why Paramount and not Netflix, its rival bidder, should win control of Warner Bros., two of the people said. Mr. Trump has pledged to be “involved” in any decision about whether to approve a deal.\n\nA Silicon Valley celebrity for decades, Mr. Ellison co-founded Oracle five decades ago and turned it into a $252 billion personal fortune. He has been deferential to his son on this year’s deal talks, a person close to the process said.\n\nWhen talking about the hostile bid for Warner Bros., he has often referred to his history of hostile acquisitions during the 1990s and 2000s, two people with knowledge of the discussions said. His son, who interned at Oracle for two summers during that time, watched him work through some deals, the people said.\n\nIf the Ellisons prevail, their business empire could range from CNN to Warner Bros. to TikTok. That could have enormous consequences for the news and entertainment industries, perhaps making the Ellisons as influential as the Murdochs, whose media dynasty operates Fox News, The Wall Street Journal and other major outlets.\n\nMr. Trump has privately said Larry Ellison assured him that he would turn CBS News, which the Ellisons took over when they bought Paramount, into a more conservative outlet, two people with knowledge of the president’s comments said.\n\nOn Sunday night, a “60 Minutes” correspondent accused David Ellison’s handpicked editor in chief of CBS News, Bari Weiss, of making a “political” decision to hold a story about Venezuelan men deported by the Trump administration. Ms. Weiss told colleagues on a call on Monday that she had held the segment because it “wasn’t ready.”\n\nDavid Ellison, born in 1983, was largely raised in Woodside, a town in Silicon Valley, by his father’s third wife, Barbara. She and Larry Ellison maintained a warm relationship after their divorce in 1986, several people close to the family say, but he was not a day-to-day presence in his son’s life. Oracle colleagues did not hear him talk often about David, who, when he was 23, said there had been “gaps” in their relationship growing up.\n\nIt wasn’t until the two began taking flight lessons together that they grew close. “I’m afraid I must have passed on the risk-taking gene,” Larry Ellison said about their shared daredevil interest in 2006.\n\nDavid Ellison dropped out of the University of Southern California’s film school and started an acting career. His father heavily financed his first major movie as an actor, “Flyboys,” which was widely considered a flop.\n\nLarry Ellison was relieved when his son left acting and entered the business side of entertainment, two people said. Their relationship grew warmer as David Ellison achieved professional success, they said. Larry Ellison has always considered himself wise about Hollywood, and one of his best friends, Steve Jobs, mentored the son about the business as well.\n\nLarry Ellison was initially skeptical of Skydance, the Hollywood company that his son started and that bought Paramount. But he has told friends in recent years that he considers his son to be one of the smartest people in the business world, trusts his judgment and tends to agree with him on corporate matters, several people with knowledge of the Ellisons said.\n\n“Larry is one of the smartest people I’ve ever met, but I honestly think David may be even smarter,” said Marc Benioff, the chief executive of Salesforce and a mentee of Larry Ellison who said he had known David since he was 3.\n\nIn recent years, Larry Ellison has invited his close circle of friends to join his son for Saturday dinners at his beachside spread on Carbon Beach in Malibu, Calif., often followed by a movie, a person with knowledge of the activities said. And David Ellison, in turn, has sought out personal and medical advice from his father, who considers himself knowledgeable about health care. A few years ago, he called his father for help on how to handle a friend’s medical emergency during a tennis match, people with knowledge of the incident recalled.\n\nLarry Ellison mostly stayed behind the scenes at Skydance. He invested an undisclosed amount in the company as early as 2006, his son has said, and even more during a $150 million fund-raising round in 2010 that made him the largest shareholder.\n\n“He gave me an incredible opportunity by believing in me in the beginning,” David Ellison said in an interview in 2022. “I could not be more grateful for that. And we definitely talk about work constantly and work together constantly.”\n\nToday, Paramount’s board — David Ellison’s bosses — includes the head of his family office, Paul Marinelli, and Oracle’s former chief executive Safra Catz.\n\nLarry Ellison’s experiences with the press have had him, too, thinking about the news business. He was often frustrated by what he saw as sensationalized coverage about him and his personal life, several people close to him said. He only really respected publications like The Financial Times or The Economist. (Oracle often advertised on the back page of The Economist.) In more recent years, he became more antagonistic about the press.\n\nHis son appears to share some of those same feelings. He has told people privately that CBS News could improve its finances if it was perceived as less liberal. He hired Ms. Weiss, the founder of The Free Press, an upstart digital news site, and a regular critic of traditional news organizations, to lead CBS News.\n\nThose criticisms of CBS News also line up with those lodged by Mr. Trump, who has forged a close relationship with Larry Ellison. Mr. Ellison was once a stalwart Clinton-era Democrat, but he has gravitated toward Mr. Trump in large part because of the president’s support for Israel, several people who have spoken to him said. (Both Ellisons are close to Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister of Israel, who one associate described as like an uncle figure to David Ellison.)\n\nDavid Ellison is still leaning hard on his father to help him with Mr. Trump, who could spoil his father’s generosity.\n\nMr. Trump and Larry Ellison speak frequently, people close to Mr. Trump and Mr. Ellison’s operations said. Mr. Ellison has been frustrated at times this year by Mr. Trump’s trade policies, but in recent conversations with the president he has been obsequious, one of the people said.\n\nA White House official said Mr. Trump’s conversations with Mr. Ellison were being mischaracterized. The official declined to be named or elaborate.\n\nThe Paramount deal team only occasionally discusses how to take advantage of the relationship with Mr. Trump, according to a person close to Larry Ellison. But Larry spoke to the president about Warner Bros. Discovery after Netflix announced its deal to buy the company, according to a White House official and a person close to Mr. Trump.\n\nSo far, though, the efforts by the father and son do not necessarily seem to be having the desired effect.\n\n“For those people that think I am close with the new owners of CBS, please understand that 60 Minutes has treated me far worse since the so-called “takeover,” than they have ever treated me before,” Mr. Trump wrote on social media last week. “If they are friends, I’d hate to see my enemies!”\n\nTyler Pager contributed reporting.",

    "title": "Taiwan is getting plenty of missiles and drones from the US. A top business leader says the arsenal is out of balance.",
    "description": "Recent US weapons packages to Taiwan have largely been asymmetric capabilities, but Taiwan needs more advanced systems as well, an official said.",
    "fullText": "The US has sent Taiwan a growing number of asymmetric weapons intended to help deter and defeat a potential Chinese invasion.\n\nTaiwan needs a more balanced arsenal of systems to counter other conflict scenarios, such as a sustained blockade, the president of the US-Taiwan Business Council recently argued.\n\nAsymmetric warfare, which relies on large numbers of relatively inexpensive, mobile, and difficult-to-target systems like drones, missiles, and dispersed units, offers Taiwan an advantage against the military might of China.\n\nBut more conventional capabilities, such as those needed to sustain operations, defend sea lanes, and maintain air and missile defense over time, are still necessary should China attempt to blockade the island. In recent years, US military support has skewed away from those needs.\n\nAt a Hudson Institute think tank event earlier this month, Rupert Hammond-Chambers, the president of the US-Taiwan Business Council, described the state of US military aid to Taiwan as out of balance.\n\nHammond-Chambers said that US arms sales have \"swung from one extreme\" — the weapons deals years ago for MQ-9 Reaper drones, M1A2 Abrams tanks, and F-16 Fighting Falcon fighter jets — \"to the other extreme where we're only doing asymmetric,\" a shift he warned leaves potential vulnerabilities.\n\nOver the last five years, the US has sold and delivered large quantities of missiles, drones, command-and-control upgrades, ammunition, software, and spare parts, marking a shift away from the higher-profile platforms like tanks and fighter jets.\n\nUS officials have argued that survivable, distributed, and networked systems are better suited to helping Taiwan counter China's daily gray-zone pressure, as well as complicating Beijing's plans in a crisis or blockade.\n\nTaiwan's focus has been on building a network of asymmetric capabilities to deter and defend against a full-scale invasion, what some have referred to as a \"D-Day scenario.\"\n\nHammond-Chambers said military support and sales have been aligned with countering that, \"but we are not doing every day, and there needs to be a swing back and more of a balance.\"\n\nJust this month, the US announced a massive $11 billion arms sale to Taiwan that included High-Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, Army Tactical Missile Systems, Javelin missiles, howitzers, and drones. Many of those systems are designed to be mobile, dispersed, and survivable, reinforcing Washington's emphasis on asymmetric and precision-strike capabilities.\n\nTaiwan's defense ministry said the US \"continues to assist Taiwan in maintaining sufficient self-defense capabilities and in rapidly building strong deterrent power and leveraging asymmetric warfare advantages, which form the foundation for maintaining regional peace and stability.\"\n\nTaiwan's government has also proposed billions of dollars in supplemental funding for asymmetric capabilities and an island-wide air defense system called Taiwan Dome or T-Dome.\n\nTaiwan's domestic investment in these weapons raises a key question: \"Will American security assistance adjust given that Taiwan is putting an enormous amount of money further down for this so-called asymmetric approach and allow for consideration of other platforms and systems?\" Hammond-Chambers said.\n\nOne of the most complicated challenges facing Taiwan is how it can develop and stockpile its own weapons systems should a blockade prevent assistance from the US and other allies and partners. The simple answer, retired admiral and former chief of the general staff for Taiwan's defense ministry Lee Hsi-Min said at the event, is to make weapons at scale on the island, rather than relying primarily on co-production or foreign supply.\n\nExperts and officials have long pointed to the need for a stronger local defense supply chain, including spare parts, munitions, and sustainment capabilities, so that Taiwan can remain operational if outside support is delayed or disrupted.\n\nWhile Taiwan's domestic defense industry can continue to develop its own weapons, \"the fastest way to production is to license American and Ukrainian and European designs and to produce on island,\" Betsy Shieh, former senior commercial officer with the US Department of Commerce, said at the event.\n\nThat approach, while not without political and logistical hurdles, could allow Taiwan to scale production more quickly. Taiwanese companies will learn to innovate as that goes on, she said, \"but the short term is license, license, license, build on island.\"\n\nTaiwan's government budgets for defense have increased substantially, and it continues to assess what types of weapons and capabilities are most needed for the different ways China could attempt to seize the island.\n\nAt this moment, some of its domestic companies have been going all-in on drone production, and a government-created national drone team is focused on bringing together firms from across Taiwan's industrial base to help build those systems at scale, but more engagement may be necessary to realize its potential.",

    "title": "The AI bubble debate: 17 business leaders, from Sam Altman to Bill Gates to Peter Thiel, weigh in",
    "description": "OpenAI's Sam Altman sparked fears of an AI bubble. Business leaders like Bill Gates, Mark Cuban, and Jensen Huang disagree over whether one exists.",
    "fullText": "The AI boom shows no sign of slowing down. Some top business leaders are concerned that a bubble is about to burst.\n\nIn August, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman gave voice to those fears about the future of AI. Since then, other CEOs, including Nvidia's Jensen Huang, have dismissed concerns of an AI bubble. Wall Street is also worried about the increasing circular nature of Big Tech's spending spree.\n\nHere's what leading tech CEOs and business leaders are saying about what's ahead.\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that the AI market is in a bubble.\n\n\"When bubbles happen, smart people get overexcited about a kernel of truth,\" Altman recently told reporters, per The Verge.\n\nAltman said this describes the state of play.\n\n\"Are we in a phase where investors as a whole are overexcited about AI? My opinion is yes. Is AI the most important thing to happen in a very long time? My opinion is also yes,\" he said.\n\nMicrosoft cofounder Bill Gates says AI is in a bubble — just not to the extent of Danish tulips.\n\n\"The value is extremely high, just like creating the internet ended up being, in net, very valuable,\" Gates told CNBC in late October. \"But you have a frenzy. And some of these companies will be glad they spent all this money. Some of them, you know, they'll commit to data centers whose electricity is too expensive.\"\n\nGates said that the situation reminds him of dot-com bubble when overvalued internet companies sparked a crash.\n\n\"Absolutely, there are a ton of these investments that will be dead ends,\" he said.\n\nStill, the billionaire said that AI remains a major breakthrough, calling it \"the biggest technical thing ever in my lifetime.\"\n\nMark Cuban, who famously sold Broadcast.com just before the dot-com bubble burst, said he doesn't see similarities to the current situation.\n\n\"There were people creating companies with just a website and going public. That's a bubble where there's no intrinsic value at all,\" Cuban told podcaster Lex Fridman in 2024. '\"People aren't even trying to make operating cap profits, they're just trying to leverage the frothiness of the stock market, that's a bubble. You don't see that right now. \"\n\nCuban took particular notice of the quality of AI companies going public.\n\n\"We're not seeing funky AI companies just go public,\" he said. \"If all of a sudden we see a rush of companies who are skins on other people's models or just creating models to create models that are going public, then yeah, that's probably the start of a bubble.\"\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said AI could become a bubble, but there will only be a crash if companies fail to keep making advancements.\n\n\"If the models keep on growing in capability year-over-year and demand keeps growing, then maybe there is no collapse,\" Zuckerberg told the \"Access\" podcast in September.\n\nZuckerberg said there are risks that the AI boom becomes like the dot-com bubble.\n\n\"There's definitely a possibility, at least empirically, based on past large infrastructure buildouts and how they led to bubbles, that something like that would happen here.\"\n\nFor Meta, Zuckerberg said the real risk is not spending enough.\n\n\"The risk, at least for a company like Meta, is probably in not being aggressive enough rather than being somewhat too aggressive,\" he said.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang doesn't see a bubble.\n\n\"I don't believe we're in an AI bubble,\" Huang told Bloomberg TV.\n\nHuang said that instead of overspeculation, AI is part of a transition from an old way of computing.\n\n\"We're going through a natural transition from an old computing model based on general purpose computing to accelerated computing,\" he said. \"We also know that AI has become good enough because of reasoning capability, and research capability, its ability to think — it's now generating tokens and intelligence that is worth paying for.\"\n\nNvidia is skyrocketing amid AI-fueled hope. In late October, the chipmaker became the world's first $5 trillion market cap company.\n\nHuang said Nvidia is happy to pay for AI for its employees, name-checking Cursor, an AI coding agent, as one of many services for which his company pays.\n\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai said there is some \"irrationality\" in the AI boom. He also cautioned that if a bubble were to burst, its blast radius would extend across the private sector.\n\n\"I think no company is going to be immune, including us,\" Pichai told the BBC in November.\n\nComparing the current moment to the Dotcom era, Pichai said that sometimes investment cycles can \"overshoot.\"\n\n\"I expect AI to be the same,\" he said. \"So I think it's both rational and there are elements of irrationality through a moment like this.\"\n\nAmazon founder Jeff Bezos says AI is in a bubble, but not in the way everyone might think.\n\nBezos called the current situation an \"industrial bubble.\" The world's third-richest person said there are similarities now, including the frenzy of investments.\n\n\"The good ideas and the bad ideas. And investors have a hard time in the middle of this excitement, distinguishing between the good ideas and the bad ideas,\" he said in October during a conference in Italy. \"And that's also probably happening today.\"\n\nBezos said that hoopla shouldn't overshadow the reality that \"AI is real\" and will change society.\n\n\"The [bubbles] that are industrial are not nearly as bad,\" Bezos said. \"It can even be good, because when the dust settles and you see who are the winners. Societies benefit from those inventions.\"\n\nJPMorgan Vice Chairman Daniel Pinto said he sees a correction coming.\n\n\"There is probably a correction there,\" Pinto said at a Bloomberg event in November.\n\nPinto said the market is pushing valuations beyond current justifications.\n\n\"In order to justify these valuations, you are considering a level of productivity that, it will happen, but it may not happen as fast as the market is pricing now,\" he said.\n\nLike Altman, OpenAI chairman Bret Taylor says we're in an AI bubble.\n\n\"I think it is both true that AI will transform the economy, and I think it will, like the internet, create huge amounts of economic value in the future,\" Taylor told The Verge in September. \"I think we're also in a bubble, and a lot of people will lose a lot of money.\"\n\nTaylor, who is also CEO of Sierra, also sees some similarities to the dot-com bubble. He also said that some of the internet companies that failed in the 90s were just ahead of their time.\n\n\"Even things like Webvan, there's now, as the internet became more distributed, really healthy businesses like Instacart and DoorDash and others that were built now that the smartphone and the scale of the internet has matured,\" he said. \"So even some of the specific ideas were actually not that bad, but maybe a little early.\"\n\nFormer Google CEO Eric Schmidt said just because it looks like a bubble doesn't mean that it is.\n\n\"I think it's unlikely, based on my experience, that this is a bubble,\" Schmidt said in July during an appearance at the RAISE Summit in Paris. \"It's much more likely that you're seeing a whole new industrial structure.\"\n\nSchmidt said it takes solace in where the hardware and chips markets stand.\n\n\"You have these massive data centers, and Nvidia is quite happy to sell them all the chips,\" he said. \"I've never seen a situation where hardware capacity was not taken up by software.\"\n\nFormer Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger says AI is in a bubble, but it won't pop for \"several years.\"\n\n\"Are we in an AI bubble? Of course. Of course we are,\" Gelsinger told CNBC in October. \"I mean, we're hyped. We're accelerating. We're putting enormous leverage into the system.\"\n\nGelsinger said that businesses are just beginning to reap the benefits of AI.\n\n\"As Jensen (Huang) talked about, and I agree with this, you know that businesses are yet to really start materially benefiting from it,\" he said. \"We're displacing all of the internet and the service provider industry as we think about it today — we have a long way to go.\"\n\nAlibaba cofounder Joe Tsai has voiced concerns about the scramble for data centers needed to help power the next generation of AI models.\n\n\"I start to see the beginning of some kind of bubble,\" Tsai told the HSBC Global Investment Summit in March, Bloomberg News reported.\n\nTsai said he's worried the building rush might outpace demand.\n\n\"I start to get worried when people are building data centers on spec,\" he said. \"There are a number of people coming up, funds coming out, to raise billions or millions of capital.\"\n\nHedge fund icon Ray Dalio voiced concerns about a bubble earlier this year, when DeepSeek's rollout led analysts to rethink AI's outlook.\n\n\"Where we are in the cycle right now is very similar to where we were between 1998 or 1999,\" Dalio told the Financial Times in January. \"There's a major new technology that certainly will change the world and be successful. But some people are confusing that with the investments being successful.\"\n\nAt the time, Dalio cited high stock prices and high interest rates. The good news is that Wall Street widely expects the Federal Reserve to cut rates during its September meeting.\n\nBillionaire tech CEO Thomas Siebel said there is \"absolutely\" an AI bubble and that it's \"huge.\"\n\n\"So we have this similar thing going on with generative AI that we've seen with previous technologies,\" Siebel told Fortune in January. \"The market is way, way overvaluing.\"\n\nSiebel, who leads C3.ai, singled out OpenAI in terms of overevaluations.\n\n\"If it disappeared, it wouldn't make any difference in the world,\" he said. \"Nothing would change. I mean, nobody's life would change. No company would change. Microsoft would find something else to power Copilot. There's like 10 other products available that would do it equally as good.\"\n\nAMD CEO Lisa Su says the bubble talk \"is completely wrong.\"\n\n\"For those who are talking about a 'bubble,' I think they're being too narrow in their thinking of, what is the return on investment today or over the next six months,\" Su told Time Magazine in 2024. \"I think you have to look at this technology arc for AI over the next five years, and how does it fundamentally change everything that we do? And I really believe that AI has that potential.\"\n\nNicolai Tangen, who runs the world's biggest sovereign wealth fund, said if AI is a bubble, \"it may not be such a bad bubble.\"\n\nSpeaking to the Financial Times in November, the CEO of Norway's $2 trillion sovereign wealth fund said that AI is a \"pretty hot space\" right now, fueled by hype and a wave of capital. As the technology marks a sweeping societal shift, traditional valuations can be difficult to determine.\n\nTangen said overvaluation isn't entirely negative. The sheer volume of capital rushing into AI will ultimately fund technologies that boost long-term productivity — from automation to data processing to new types of AI models.\n\nThe hard part for investors is telling real breakthroughs apart from noise in a landscape still dominated by a few powerful platform companies, he added.\n\nPeter Thiel, the billionaire venture capitalist who cofounded PayPal, indicated recently that he's skeptical of the notion of an AI bubble.\n\n\"My macroeconomic placeholder is that it's going to keep going,\" Thiel said in a December interview with The Spectator, referring to the economic growth driven by the technology.\n\nThiel also said that he's been asked about an AI bubble frequently by people in Europe, which is \"how you know that they're not going to build a lot of AI in Europe.\"\n\n\"There is no other vector of growth in our society, we would be out of our minds not to take it,\" Thiel said. \"I don't think it's big enough to solve the budget deficit, but if the US embraces AI and Europe rejects it, I think the US is in somewhat better shape than Europe is.\"\n\nDespite his projections of future growth, Thiel also said that there are \"all sorts of things that I don't particularly like about the AI revolution,\" including that it's concentrated in a handful of large companies and that AI is \"probably more of a substitute than a complement\" to human labor.\n\n\"It will have a zero-sum feel to a lot of people,\" Thiel said.",

    "fullText": "The holiday season is in full swing, and while Serie A may be pausing for a few days, the transfer rumor mill is raging on unabated. Although a few new names have been added to the mix, the Italian press continues to focus on Roma’s pursuit of Manchester United forward Joshua Zirkzee and Atletico Madrid midfielder Giacomo Raspadori.\n\nWhile they bring different traits to the table, Zirkzee and Raspadori have followed similar career arcs, parlaying success in Italy into megamillion moves to larger European clubs. However, with only 586 combined league minutes between them, life outside of Italy hasn’t been kind to these former Serie A standouts.\n\nFortunately, there may be hope on the horizon for these two talented attackers in the form of a curmudgeonly calcio genius. According to multiple sources in Italy, Gian Piero Gasperini has identified Zirkzee and Raspadori as the ideal salves for his wounded attack.\n\nRecent reports from Italy indicate that Roma will acquire both players on loan with options to buy (€40M for Zirkzee, €18M for Raspadori) that become obligations if certain objectives are met, including the club qualifying for the Champions League next season. This would represent a significant investment for the club and may require the corresponding sales or loan cancellations of players like Evan Ferguson, Leon Bailey, and Artem Dovbyk.\n\nThis is all speculation, of course, but the depth and breadth of these rumors suggest that Roma and Gasperini have clearly established priorities for the January transfer market. All that remains is to push the deals over the finish line, which is no easy feat with this many moving pieces.",

    "fullText": "Managing a business is challenging, even in the best circumstances. In today's uncertain economy, marked by slowing consumer spending and shifting retail habits, it becomes even tougher.\n\nFor one retail chain, the difficulty has been compounded by years of financial strain, two Chapter 11 bankruptcies, and hundreds of store closures nationwide.\n\nOnce an iconic mall staple known for its affordable jewelry, colorful hair accessories, and quirky novelties, Claire's is again facing serious financial setbacks. A new revelation has raised doubts about the long-term survival of the 64-year-old brand, which once played a significant role in the lives of countless teens and tweens.\n\nAs it works to emerge from its second bankruptcy under new ownership by the private equity firm Ames Watson, Claire's is confronting additional pressures from its supply chain. Several Asian suppliers allege they are owed millions of dollars in unpaid debts, according to claims filed in Hong Kong and reported by CNBC.\n\nThe disputed orders were for holiday merchandise placed before Claire's second bankruptcy filing, when Elliott Management still owned the company. Suppliers were reportedly aware of the retailer's financial instability at the time the orders were made. However, by the time production was completed, Claire's had already filed for bankruptcy.\n\nAfter Ames Watson acquired the brand, some suppliers claimed they were still owed payment, but agreed to continue doing business with Claire's. Others chose to pursue legal action against Claire's Hong Kong-based sourcing office, RSI International.\n\nAs a major American retail chain, Claire's is a prominent customer for many of these Asian suppliers. This is why, despite outstanding balances, several vendors continued to fulfill orders out of fear that refusing to do so could jeopardize their business relationship with the retailer.\n\nDuring its latest acquisition process, RSI International notified creditors that they had 30 days to file claims to recover unpaid debts, liabilities that under Hong Kong Law do not transfer to new owners.\n\nIn a statement to CNBC, Ames Watson emphasized it was \"not involved in the operation or purchasing decisions made prior to the acquisition.\"\n\n\"Since then, we have focused on responsibly stewarding the business and engaging suppliers in good faith as we strengthen Claire's for the long term,\" said Ames Watson. \"We are excited about the company’s direction in 2026.\"\n\nClaire's first filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2018, emerging later that year under the new ownership of Elliott Management Corp. and Monarch Alternative Capital.",

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Cassi Zheng, 31, the founder of Aurawell, an aromatherapy brand. Her words have been edited for length and clarity.\n\nAs a brand director at a sports-drink startup in Shanghai, I spoke to more than 30 people a day — from members of the sports community to suppliers and colleagues seeking sign-offs.\n\nI was drained. I felt chronic pain, constant fatigue, and even had panic attacks.\n\nIn February 2023, at 29, I quit. I wanted to head into my 30s with a clearer sense of purpose. I didn't tell my parents, but my friends and colleagues were supportive.\n\nSuddenly, I had nothing to do, and that early idleness felt panic-inducing. I was so used to running around, talking to people, and being needed. I felt completely lost for a few days.\n\nThen I started trying different things. I biked across the city from one end to the other, covering more than 10 kilometers. Another time, I biked 30 kilometers just to go kayaking.\n\nI felt exhausted, but also energized.\n\nI spent the first year traveling across Asia. Because I'd been practicing Reiki, Japan felt like a natural first stop.\n\nOn a trip to Tokyo and Kyoto with friends, temples and traditional inns sparked something within me. I knew I wanted to go back again on my own.\n\nI kept moving. Bangkok's flea markets and Chinatown reminded me of Guangzhou, where I grew up, in the '90s.\n\nIn South Korea, I rang in the new year on Jeju Island with old friends, racing to find a taxi minutes before midnight.\n\nOn New Year's Day, I flew to Kyoto for my first true solo trip. I'd lived on my own before — college and grad school in the US, travel through Mexico, Kenya, Nepal — but Japan felt different. It was the perfect place to be an introvert.\n\nI spent my birthday alone in Tokyo, sick with the flu, wandering the Nezu Museum's gardens. The quiet design reminded me to notice what's present, instead of what's missing.\n\nI returned to Japan twice more that year, spending days meditating alone in the mountains.\n\nA year and a half after quitting, I spent three weeks in Europe. On a hike in Sicily, I met a man climbing beside me. He spoke Italian, I spoke English, but we managed. He told me his father had paved the mountain road. Afterward, I visited his café.\n\nSicily felt open and passionate — a contrast to Shanghai's intensity.\n\nI began crying without knowing why and felt ashamed. I tried to step away, but the teacher told me I didn't need to hide. With an East Asian upbringing, that was incredibly freeing. I cried for two days, overwhelmed by release.\n\nI'd long relied on external validation from bosses, parents, and goal-driven metrics. My gap year loosened that grip. I could count the trips or the solo days, but none of that defines me.\n\nOn my 30th birthday, I finally told my parents about my gap year and the aromatherapy brand I was starting with a friend. They were shocked — it was far outside their comfort zone — but showing them my business plan and prototypes helped. Even now, when I visit them a few hours outside Shanghai, they enjoy talking about metrics and the future of my company.\n\nMy friend and I launched Aurawell in May 2024, just over a year after I left my job. I first got the word out by leading a public meditation in an underground performance space.\n\nTaking a gap year was one of the wisest decisions I've made. It gave me time to slow down, reflect on my choices, and discover what I actually enjoy, without pressure from the outside world.\n\nDo you have a story about taking a gap year that you want to share?

    "title": "The Atlanta Braves have done a lot this offseason — have they done enough to bounce back in 2026?",
    "description": "With Opening Day three months away, the Braves seem pretty much finished with offseason business.",
    "fullText": "For the Atlanta Braves, 2025 was an avalanche of disappointment.\n\nEntering the season on a seven-year postseason streak, the Braves were considered championship contenders, the National League’s best chance at unseating the juggernaut Dodgers. With a strong core of experienced position players, the NL’s reigning Cy Young in Chris Sale and a pair of superstars coming back from injury in Ronald Acuña Jr. and Spencer Strider, Atlanta began the season with 93.4% playoff odds, according to FanGraphs.\n\nInstead, a depleted, injury-plagued Braves club trudged to a shocking 76-86 record and a fourth-place finish in a down NL East.\n\nThankfully, the autopsy is pretty straightforward. Sale and key rotation piece Spencer Schwellenbach both spent long stretches on the IL. The same was true for third baseman Austin Riley, who underperformed when available. Strider looked rusty and out of sync upon his return from Tommy John. Stalwarts such as Ozzie Albies, Michael Harris II, Marcel Ozuna and Sean Murphy all struggled offensively. The emergence of NL Rookie of the Year Drake Baldwin was an invigorating development, but it wasn’t enough to overcome the simple fact that too many important players spent too much time watching baseball instead of playing it.\n\nBut the future, at Truist Park, is not lost.\n\nBecause as disappointing as last season was for Atlanta, the club’s front office has conducted business this winter like a team fully expecting to contend in 2026. President of baseball operations Alex Anthopoulos is clearly treating 2025 as a blip, an aberration, a fluke. With the new year still a week away, Atlanta’s head honcho has arguably done more to reinforce his roster than any other exec.\n\nThe Braves have signed six MLB free agents, a tally that ranks second so far this offseason behind the Cubs. To that sextet, Atlanta has guaranteed more than $106 million, the fifth-largest outlay as of Tuesday. The spending itself is not particularly shocking — the Braves have always run a top-10 payroll under Anthopoulos — but the team’s unflinching aggression is a reminder that the Braves are still a formidable presence in the National League.\n\nTo be fair, none of Atlanta’s additions was significant enough to warrant an in-person, jersey-unveiling press conference. But the Braves are undoubtedly a better, more complete and deeper team now than they were two months ago.\n\n[Get more Atlanta news: Braves team feed]\n\nFormer Padres closer Robert Suárez was probably the newsiest acquisition, with the soon-to-be 35-year-old flamethrower joining on a three-year, $45 million contract. It’s a long commitment for a reliever approaching his baseball golden years, but Suárez still throws absolute gas and has been one of the league’s most reliable closers over the past few years. His 76 saves since the start of 2024 are the most in baseball.\n\nBut don’t expect that number to rise much higher, as Suárez won’t begin the year as Atlanta’s closer. That’s because the Braves also re-signed Raisel Iglesias, their longtime closer, on a one-year, $16 million deal. He’ll continue to handle the ninth, and new skipper Walt Weiss will deploy Suárez in the Swiss Army knife, fireman role. Veterans Joel Payamps and Danny Young were also brought in on one-year deals to bolster a bullpen that finished 19th in baseball with a 4.19 ERA in 2025.\n\nAnthopoulos and Co. have been busy refurbishing the offensive side as well. Back in November, Atlanta  swung a one-for-one deal with Houston, acquiring utilityman Mauricio Dubón in exchange for defensive wizard Nick Allen. Dubón isn’t a particularly good hitter, but he provides a lot of defensive versatility and is a perfectly capable bat. The Braves followed that deal with a pair of more needle-moving signings in shortstop Ha-Seong Kim and outfielder Mike Yastrzemski.\n\nKim spent the final month of 2025 with the Braves after the club claimed him off waivers from the Tampa Bay Rays. That move was motivated by the hope that Kim wouldn’t activate his opt-out and Atlanta would have itself an every-day shortstop for 2026. Instead, the Korean glovesmith decided to test free agency, a smart decision as it turned out. Kim, who was set to receive $16 million, ended up back in Atlanta on a one-year, $20 million deal.\n\nThat’s a hefty investment for a player who was both hurt and bad in 2025, but Kim has been an average big-league hitter for most of his career while providing ample value at the game’s most difficult infield spot. For the Braves, whose shortstops finished dead last in baseball a year ago, with a putrid 56 wRC+, it’s a price worth paying.\n\nYastrzemski, who joined on a two-year, $23 million deal, is an unspectacular yet remarkably consistent corner outfielder. The 35-year-old has been worth at least 2.0 bWAR in every one of his seven big-league seasons and has a career .809 OPS against right-handed pitching. Although he’ll likely sit against most lefty starters, Yaz will provide depth in the corners behind Acuña and Jurickson Profar while mixing in at designated hitter.\n\nThat Atlanta has DH at-bats to dole out is a development in its own right. Since Opening Day 2023, Marcell Ozuna has started 445 of Atlanta’s 502 games, postseason included. Now a free agent for the first time in his career, Ozuna usually hit enough to justify clogging up the Braves’ DH spot. But at this point, a reunion feels unlikely, as the Braves can use that space to cycle through Yastrzemski, Profar and whoever isn’t catching that day (Murphy or Baldwin).\n\nWith Opening Day still three months away, the Braves seem pretty much finished with offseason business. Anthopoulos added a pair of every-day bats, a valuable utility guy, two high-leverage relievers and some potentially useful pitching depth. Atlanta could enter the season with its current assortment of ballplayers, and prognosticators and projection systems alike would consider this a playoff team.\n\nBut if the Braves want to push the issue, there’s still one more area ripe for a splash: the starting rotation. Sale, now fully healthy, will lead the line as he prepares to hit free agency at season’s end. Behind him, there’s Strider (looking to recapture his pre-surgery form), Schwellenbach (missed the last few months of ‘25 due to a fractured elbow), Reynaldo Lopez (made just one start in ‘25 before undergoing shoulder surgery) and youngster Hurston Waldrep (impressed in a nine-start sample but remains unproven). Grant Holmes, Bryce Elder and Didier Fuentes follow as depth options.\n\nIf things break right, that’s a really interesting group with tons of upside. It’s also a group that has shown to be particularly susceptible to the injury bug. That’s what derailed Atlanta’s plans last season, and the same thing could easily happen again.\n\nTo lessen that possibility, the Braves could add one more impact starter to the group. Such a move, given the organization’s middling farm system, would probably have to come via free agency. Atlanta is already over the luxury tax by around $6 million, according to Spotrac. Cashing out for a big arm such as Zac Gallen, Tatsuya Imai or Framber Valdez would push the Braves well over the tax, something the organization is wary of doing.\n\nBut money is just money, and the Braves cannot afford another disappointing season. They’ve done a good job, so far this winter, of avoiding a replay of 2025, but one more big swing could make them quite a formidable character in 2026.",

    "fullText": "Business Insider's Pranav Dixit has been covering Meta for a year now. He recently reported on the company's \"year of intensity\" with colleague Jyoti Mann. I asked Pranav for his take on a turbulent 12 months.\n\nQ: You've been covering Meta for a year now. What has that been like?\n\n\"Intense\" is the only way to describe it — exactly what Mark Zuckerberg promised employees. I joined BI a day before Meta scrapped third-party fact-checking, and almost immediately the culture shifted: DEI rollbacks, an embrace of \"masculine\" energy, and moves that seemed more aligned with the Trump administration. Then came thousands of layoffs of people labeled low performers and a noticeable spike in performance pressure.\n\nThe second half of the year brought a very different pivot. Meta effectively admitted Llama hadn't lived up to the hype and reset around a new mission: building \"personal superintelligence.\" That meant hiring Alexandr Wang, reorganizing AI under Meta Superintelligence Labs, and aggressively poaching talent while high-profile figures — including Yann LeCun — departed. It felt like covering a company reinventing its business, values, and culture all at once.\n\nQ: What stood out most from your reporting with Jyoti Mann on this \"year of intensity\"?\n\nA pervasive survival mindset. Over and over, employees told us the goal wasn't to do great work — it was to avoid landing in the bottom performance tier. Some people left on principle, saying Meta no longer resembled the company they joined. Yet others insisted this is the best job in tech: great product challenges, unmatched scale, exceptional pay. Those two realities sit side by side — one group bracing for impact, another thriving.\n\nQ: Your reporting found managers sometimes hiring people just to fill low-performance slots. How does that work?\n\nMeta's forced ranking requires a set percentage of \"low performers.\" Some managers gamed the system. Some told us they avoided backfilling roles; others hired into fuzzy positions with near-impossible expectations so they didn't have to put existing trusted team members in the bottom bucket. (Meta didn't respond to specific questions on this.)\n\nQ: What will you be watching for in 2026?\n\nThe big question is whether Meta's massive AI spend becomes a durable business or an expensive experiment. Will Meta AI become a distinct, everyday product? Will the capex binge translate into real revenue and profit? And can the culture stabilize enough to keep the AI talent Meta is betting the company on? Meta can execute — history proves that — but \"intensity\" can't last forever. 2026 will show whether the trade-offs were worth it.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

Yet the real influence often sits with a different group entirely: the extended leadership team (ELT), the tier beneath the C-suite comprising business-unit presidents, regional CEOs, and functional heads. These leaders make choices every day about which customers to prioritize, which capabilities to build, where to allocate resources, and which longstanding activities and processes to evolve. Yet they’re frequently treated as recipients of strategy rather than its architects.

    "description": "Throughout 2025, Business Insider spoke to a handful of entrepreneurs and side hustlers who found inventive ways to make money.",
    "fullText": "Climbing the corporate ladder isn't the only way to increase your earnings.\n\nThroughout 2025, Business Insider spoke to a handful of entrepreneurs and side hustlers who found inventive ways to make money, from firing up 3D printers to propagating rare houseplants.\n\nHere are three of the most creative money-making strategies we heard all year.\n\nMichael Satterlee learned about 3D printing and CAD (computer-aided design) modeling in a class he took his freshman year of high school. He took the skill and ran with it, printing a variety of products, including clog accessories, that he listed and sold on Etsy.\n\nIn 2025, he created a coozie spin-off that he calls a \"tactical reload can holder\" — and the internet can't get enough of it.\n\nPartly thanks to viral videos of the can holder in action, the 18-year-old's company, Cruise Cup, generated $300,000 in sales in November alone. His goal in 2026 is to transition to manufacturing his product in stainless steel, as his 130 printers can barely keep up with demand.\n\nE-commerce entrepreneurs are tapping into a new strategy to move product: Live selling, which combines livestreaming and e-commerce. Sellers are hosting live \"shows\" and chatting with their audience in real time, while viewers are buying directly from the stream without leaving the app.\n\nIt can be incredibly lucrative if you can find the right niche. Top sellers are earning five and six figures in a single livestream.\n\nHarry Luu is one of those sellers. He brought in $42,000 in one day by selling two rare plants — one for $26,000 and the other for $16,000 — on Palmstreet, a live shopping app specifically for rare plants and other unique goods.\n\nThe former mathematician, who left academia in 2024 to cultivate and sell plants full-time, is all in on the \"new age QVC\" strategy.\n\n\"It gives you the convenience of being at home, but also allows the buyer the flexibility of actually interacting and clarifying before they pull the trigger,\" he said. \"And I think that is one of the greatest advantages of live selling.\"\n\nTraditional rental real estate remains a tried-and-true wealth-building strategy, but buying a property, finding renters, and then managing the property and tenants is time-consuming. Property investors like Carl and Mindy Jensen, who have accumulated substantial savings, are adopting a more passive approach: private money lending.\n\nHere's how it works in a nutshell: The Jensens lend money to other investors to rehab a house, for example, and earn interest on the loan. They're essentially acting as the bank.\n\n\"We set the rate. There are some rules around it. For example, the rate can't be super cheap or else the IRS considers it a gift,\" the couple explained, referring to the applicable federal rate (AFR), which is the minimum interest rate the IRS allows for private loans, published monthly.\n\nVetting the borrower and the deal they're pursuing is essential — and time-consuming — but after the upfront due diligence, the ongoing involvement is minimal.\n\nThe neat thing about this money-making strategy? It's a \"win-win\" for both the lender and the borrower, confirmed investor Mike Gorius, who prefers working with private money lenders over traditional lenders: \"Things can just move a lot quicker. It's what allows us to buy properties in a matter of days versus a matter of weeks.\"",

This year's requests focus on the business world. (Santa Claus is a BI Today subscriber, obviously.)\n\nROI for AI. I'm legally required to start every 2025 recap or 2026 look-ahead by mentioning artificial intelligence. This isn't about bashing or praising AI, though. I just want to see some noticeable returns on all these massive AI projects. I'm not screaming about an AI bubble, but my palms get a little sweaty thinking about the ever-growing tech budgets. So, give us all some relief by showing that these AI tools are going to generate revenue.\n\nA solution to Wall Street's recruiting cycle. The worst thing that could happen to a junior banker is finding out their favorite Murray Hill brunch spot has shut down. The second-worst thing happened this year when big banks fought back against PE's early recruitment of them. The result upended a Wall Street tradition aspiring financiers had spent years preparing for. I was never a fan of the process, but the change left us in a weird no-man's land where none of the rules are apparent.\n\nPrediction markets predict their future. With a string of recent media partnerships, we're going to see a lot more data from prediction markets in 2026. Meanwhile, some state regulators aren't so pleased with their rise. So let's settle the debate. I'd like prediction markets to set a market speculating on their own future. Let the people decide!\n\nNo more media blackouts, please. I can't go through another two weeks of no sports because of carriage disputes. I know how this story ends (the customer paying more), and I also know there's nothing I can do about it. So just rip the bandage off, and let's avoid the grandstanding going forward.\n\nProtein, chill out. No food group is on a hotter run than the muscle-building nutrient. But it's flying too close to the sun. We've got protein in hot cocoa now?? I'm a self-admitted gym bro, and I know my whey around a protein shake (I hate myself for that joke), but even I need to put my foot down. Besides, overconsumption of protein could have a painful conclusion for some of us: kidney stones.\n\nThe New York Knicks to reach the NBA finals.

But with the Chiefs announcing Monday that they would leave the historic Arrowhead Stadium in Missouri and move into a not-yet-built $3 billion stadium on the Kansas side of Kansas City, Kansas-based fans soon won’t need to root for their team across state lines.\n\n“That creates energy that I don’t think we really understand or really appreciate until it starts happening, until the stadium gets built, they play their first game, they play their first season,” Kevin Jenks, the president and CEO of the Wichita Sports Commission, said.\n\nThe Chiefs spent more than five decades playing at Arrowhead.

However, he’s skeptical that the financial boom that comes with a major sports team moving in will echo around the state.\n\n“From an economics standpoint, I think the closer you are to Kansas City, the more benefits you’re going to have,” Straub said.\n\nFor more Kansas news, click here.

Hundreds of families may be forced to pack up and leave the town of 11,000, heading east to Omaha or Iowa, or south to the meatpacking towns of Kansas or beyond, causing spinoff layoffs in Lexington's restaurants, barbershops, grocers, convenience stores and taco trucks.  “Losing 3,000 jobs in a city of 10,000 to 12,000 people is as big a closing event as we’ve seen virtually for decades,” said Michael Hicks, director of the Center for Business and Economic Research at Indiana's Ball State University.",
    "fullText": "LEXINGTON, Neb. (AP) — On a frigid day after Mass at St. Ann’s Catholic Church in rural Nebraska, worshippers shuffled into the basement and sat on folding chairs, their faces barely masking the fear gripping their town.\n\nA pall hung over the room just as it hung over the holiday season in Lexington, Nebraska.\n\n“Suddenly they tell us that there’s no more work. Your world closes in on you,” said Alejandra Gutierrez.\n\nShe and the others work at Tyson Foods' beef plant and are among the 3,200 people who will lose their jobs when Lexington's biggest employer closes the plant next month after more than two decades of operation.\n\nHundreds of families may be forced to pack up and leave the town of 11,000, heading east to Omaha or Iowa, or south to the meatpacking towns of Kansas or beyond, causing spinoff layoffs in Lexington's restaurants, barbershops, grocers, convenience stores and taco trucks.\n\n“Losing 3,000 jobs in a city of 10,000 to 12,000 people is as big a closing event as we’ve seen virtually for decades,” said Michael Hicks, director of the Center for Business and Economic Research at Indiana's Ball State University. It will be “close to the poster child for hard times.”\n\nAll told, the job losses are expected to reach 7,000, largely in Lexington and the surrounding counties, according to estimates from University of Nebraska, Lincoln, shared with The Associated Press. Tyson employees alone will lose an estimated $241 million in pay and benefits annually.\n\nTyson says it's closing the plant to “right-size” its beef business after a historically low cattle herd in the U.S. and the company’s expected loss of $600 million on beef production next fiscal year.\n\nThe plant's closure threatens to unravel a Great Plains town where the American Dream was still attainable, where immigrants who didn't speak English and never graduated high school bought homes, raised children in a safe community and sent them to college.\n\nNow, those symbols of economic progress — mortgages and car payments, property taxes and tuition costs — are bills that thousands of Tyson workers won't have an income to pay.\n\nAt St. Ann's church, Gutierrez sat between her daughters and recalled being told of the plant closure just before Thanksgiving while she visited a college campus with her high school senior, Kimberly.\n\n“At that moment, my daughter said she no longer wanted to study,” Gutierrez said. “Because where would we get the money to pay for college?”\n\nA tear slipped down Kimberly's cheek as she looked at her mother and then down at her hands.\n\nIf you threw a dart at a map of the United States, Lexington — called “Lex” by locals — would be just about bullseye.\n\nIt's easy to miss driving down Interstate 80, half hidden by barren hackberry trees, corn fields and pastures of Black Angus cattle, but a driver can spy the plant's hulking industrial buildings pumping steam.\n\nThe plant opened in 1990 and was bought by Tyson 11 years later, attracting thousands of workers and nearly doubling the town's population within a decade.\n\nMany came from Los Angeles, then stricken by recession, including Lizeth Yanes, who initially hated what she called “a little ghost town.\"\n\nBut soon Lexington flourished, with suburbs sprouting among bur oak and American elm trees. The downtown, a strip of cobblestone streets and brick buildings, has a Somali grocer that abuts a Hispanic bakery; locals attend over a dozen churches and several city recreation centers.\n\nTo this day, the plant creates the town's rhythm as workers roll on and off the daily A, B and C shifts and fill restaurants, school pickup lines and the one-screen movie theater showing “Polar Express.”\n\n“It took a long time for me to actually enjoy this little place,” said Yanes. “Now that I enjoy it, now I have to leave.”\n\nThe atmosphere inside the Tyson plant, where workers process as many as 5,000 head of cattle a day, laboring on slaughter floors, cleaning crews or trimming cuts of meat, feels “like a funeral,” she said.\n\n“Tyson was our motherland,\" said plant worker Arab Adan. The Kenyan immigrant sat in his car with his two energetic sons, who asked him a question he has no answer to: “Which state are we gonna go, daddy?”\n\nThe only thing Adan is set on is that his kids finish the school year in Lexington, where school officials say nearly half of students have a parent working for Tyson.\n\nThe school district, where at least 20 languages and dialects are spoken, has higher high school graduation and college attendance rates than the state and national average, and one of Nebraska's biggest marching bands. Residents are proud of the diversity and the tightknit community, where young people return to raise families.\n\nDuring Mass at St. Ann's, parishioners gave the cash in their pockets to a fund for families in financial need, despite knowing they'll be out of work next month. Afterward, Francisco Antonio ran through his future employment options with a sad smile.\n\nAfter the plant closes on Jan. 20, the 52-year-old father of four said he'll stay a few months in Lexington and look for work, though “now there's no future.\" He took off his glasses, paused, apologized and tried to explain his emotions.\n\n“It’s home mostly, not the job,” he said, replacing his glasses with an embarrassed smile.\n\n“We need another opportunity, job, here in Lex,” he said. “Otherwise Lex is gonna disappear.”\n\nThe domino effect could go something like this: If 1,000 families skip town, said economist Hicks — who wouldn't be surprised if it were double that — seats would be left empty in schools, leading to teacher layoffs; there would be far fewer customers in restaurants, shops and other businesses.\n\nMost of the customers at Los Jalapenos, a Mexican restaurant down the street from the plant, are Tyson workers. They fill booths after work and are greeted by owner Armando Martinez’s mustachioed grin and bellow of “Hola, amigo!”\n\nMartinez’s grandson once told his grandfather that when he grows up he wants to work at Tyson. The child's fifth-grade sister recently gathered with classmates to talk about the changes happening with their parents. Some were headed to California, others to Kansas. All were in tears.\n\nIf he can't keep up with bills, the restaurant will close, but “there’s just nowhere we can go,\" said Martinez, who undergoes dialysis for diabetes, has an amputated foot and prays for a miracle: that Tyson will change its mind.\n\nHe knows it's unlikely. Asked by The Associated Press for comment about plans for the site, Tyson said in a statement that it “is currently assessing how we can repurpose the facility within our own production network.” It did not provide details, or say whether it plans to offer support to the community through the plant closure.\n\nMany, including City Manager Joe Pepplitsch, are hoping Tyson puts the plant up for sale and a new company comes in bringing jobs. That isn't a quick fix, requiring time, negotiations, renovations and no guarantee of comparable jobs.\n\n“Tyson owes this community a debt. I think they have a responsibility here to help ease some of the impact,” he said, noting Tyson doesn't pay city taxes due to a deal negotiated decades ago.\n\n‘It’s not easy, at our age, to go back and start over’\n\nNear the plant, at the Dawson County Fairgrounds, Tyson workers recently filled a long hall as state agencies — responding with the urgency of a natural disaster — offered information on retraining, writing a resume, filing for unemployment and avoiding scammers when selling homes.\n\nAttendees' faces were subdued, like listening to a doctor’s prognosis. “Your financial health is going to change,\" they were told. “Don’t ignore the bank, they will not go away.”\n\nMany of the older workers don’t speak English, haven’t graduated high school and aren’t computer savvy. The last application some filled out was decades ago.\n\n“We know only working in meat for Tyson, we don’t have any other experience,” said Adan, the Kenyan immigrant.\n\nBack at St. Ann's, workers echoed that concern.\n\n“They only want young people now,” said Juventino Castro, who's worked at Tyson for a quarter-century. “I don’t know what’s going to happen in the time I have left.”\n\nLupe Ceja said she's saved a little money, but it won’t last long. Luz Alvidrez has a cleaning gig that will sustain her for awhile. Others might return to Mexico for a time. Nobody has a clear plan.\n\n“It won’t be easy,” said Fernando Sanchez, a Tyson worker for 35 years who sat with his wife. “We started here from scratch and it’s time to start from scratch again.\"\n\nTears rolled down his wife's cheeks and he squeezed her hand.",

    "description": "Finance pros tell Business Insider about the most annoying investing questions they have to field from family around holidays.",
    "fullText": "For finance professionals, the holidays bring festive cheer and optimism for the new year that we all enjoy. For them, it also brings requests for investing advice and stock picks that sources tell Business Insider they'd rather not have to deal with.\n\nFor many investors, advisors, and others who navigate markets for a living, seeing their relatives during the holiday season often means being asked the same question: What stocks should I buy?\n\nThere's no easy answer, as the stock market is unpredictable and everyone has different risk tolerance, investment horizons, and goals.\n\nColin Sahagun, the founder and CEO of Stelrix, a fintech startup that recently launched an investment-backed spending card, says the question often amounts to, \"How do I get rich quick?\"\n\n\"Every year, someone asks, 'Tell me the next 20 high-growth stocks I should buy,'\" he recalls. \"I will have older relatives asking for 'the next Oklo under 10 dollars' or 'the next Vertiv at fourteen.' They want moonshot ideas and total reassurance at the same time.\"\n\nOklo and Vertiv are two stocks that have enjoyed big runs in 2025. Vertiv has jumped 44%, while Oklo is up a whopping 280%.\n\nSteven Rick, chief economist at financial services firm TruStage, says he's routinely asked for the next hot stock when visiting family for the holidays.\n\nHe notes that a common question is something like: \"Why didn't you tell me to buy Nvidia stock two years ago?\"\n\n\"This is annoying because 'hindsight bias' occurs when family members perceive a past massive rise in a stock price as more predictable than it actually was.\"\n\nAnthony Rasotto, CEO of wealth management firm ARC Wealth, echoed that sentiment, adding that requests for advice on the direction of the market are among the most irritating.\n\n\"The most annoying question is, 'Which way is the market going in the next few months?' It's usually from an uncle near or at retirement,\" he said. \"I always answer: 'I don't know.' If I could predict the market, I wouldn't need to work at all.\"\n\nPeople who work in crytpo also get bombared for advice at the holidays. Adrian Fritz, CIO of digital asset brokerage platform 21Shares, told Business Insider that while he's often asked about the best time to buy bitcoin, he's sometimes asked to name the best asset to buy in the coming year.\n\n\"It assumes there's a single 'best' asset for everyone, as if I've been hiding a secret Christmas stock pick all year waiting to unveil it at dinner,\" he said. \"The reality is a lot less cinematic: good investing depends on personal circumstances, not holiday fortune-telling.\"\n\nFinance pros stress that there is never a clear answer to the annoying stock market questions they receive from relatives. Anthony Termini, a former hedge fund CIO turned investment analyst and commentator, highlighted why many people don't want to discuss these topics in depth.\n\n\"The answer is always, 'who knows?'\" he said. \"More importantly, who cares? Whatever the answer is, it may never be an asset class or security that is appropriate or suitable.\"",

Using nationally representative household consumption surveys from 23 countries that together account for 50% of the world’s poor, we estimate that reducing the poverty rate to 1% (from a baseline of 12% at the time of last survey) would cost $170B nominal per year. This is 5.5 times the corresponding reduction in the aggregate poverty gap, but only 19% of the cost of universal basic income. Extrapolated globally, the results correspond to a cost of (approximately) ending extreme poverty of roughly 0.3% of global GDP.\n\n Acknowledgements and Disclosures\n\nRS is supported by a Stanford Data Science Fellowship and Stanford DARE (Diversifying Academia, Recruiting Excellence) Fellowship.

Global trade has continued to grow, most countries are expanding—not retreating from—international trade agreements, and U.S. tariffs, while disruptive, are constrained by exemptions, economic realities, legal limits, and public opinion. Much international business already occurs among friendly countries, and corporate “de-risking” strategies often increase cross-border trade and investment rather than reduce them.",

    "description": "Karen Gilchrist jokes that her \"maternal instincts kicked in late,\" but by 2024 she and her husband, Pablo Slough, decided to prioritize family over climbing the corporate ladder.",
    "fullText": "Over two decades of working in demanding roles managing teams around the world had taken a toll.\n\n\"I worked straight out of college, and then it was one job to the other job,\" Slough, 53, told Business Insider. \"It was always fast-paced, high stress.\"\n\nFor Gilchrist, turning 50 last summer drove her to reflect about how she'd spent her time and what she wanted to do moving forward.\n\n\"I joke sometimes that my maternal instincts kicked in late,\" Gilchrist told Business Insider. \"But it felt like the right moment to dedicate more time to my family than to work and climbing the corporate ladder.\"\n\nTheir oldest son, Luka, 18, is in his senior year and plans to head off to college in the fall. The other two, Mateo, 15, and Joaquin, 12, aren't far behind.\n\nTaking a gap year would give the couple a chance to step away from work, travel with their kids, and figure out their next steps.\n\nBut they didn't jump in immediately. The couple, based in Boulder, Colorado, hired a financial advisor a year in advance to make sure the plan was financially feasible.\n\n\"We also decided that we're going to rent our house out while we're traveling, so we could get some income,\" Slough said.\n\nAs their plans to quit became more concrete, the couple talked through everything with their kids. Funnily enough, it was their sons who seemed unsure at first.\n\n\"We were a bit surprised that our parents would actually do it because they have always been very focused on their careers,\" their second son, Mateo, told Business Insider.\n\nBut one of the reasons the couple wanted to do this was to show their kids that life isn't just about work, Gilchrist said.\n\n\"It's about life. It's about balancing things. It's about family,\" she said, adding that they hoped the experience would show their kids that life doesn't always have to follow a fixed path.\n\nThe couple considered it a career break, but the plan was not to travel the whole time.\n\n\"We didn't want to disrupt school,\" Slough said. \"So we just thought we'll come back for school, and then whatever free time we have, we'll travel.\"\n\nThe family spent the summer of 2024 traveling around Europe, a trip planned around their eldest son's three-week business course at a university in Barcelona.\n\nTheir travels began in Turkey, before they hopped on a cruise through Greece, Croatia, Malta, and Montenegro. After dropping their son off for his program, they explored Spain and Portugal before reuniting and heading to Colombia. They were back in Colorado a week before school started.\n\nThis year, their summer took them to Asia, with stops in Hong Kong, several cities in Thailand, Vietnam, China, and finally Japan.\n\n\"We all wanted to go to Asia, so we were really excited about it,\" Luka, their oldest son, told Business Insider.\n\nTo budget for their trips, the couple created an Excel sheet to track their daily expenses.\n\n\"We had an average spend per day that we wanted to aim for. It meant that in some places, we splurged because we wanted a really nice hotel. And in other places, we were a little bit more frugal,\" Gilchrist said, adding that they would update their expenses in real time to see if they were within their budget.\n\nLooking back on the trips, the family says they loved every moment.\n\n\"It felt like our parents were more present and flexible with us,\" Joaquin, their youngest, told Business Insider. \"We also learned more about each other's preferences, from the experiences and foods we enjoy to how each of us likes to spend our free time.\"\n\nDuring the months they weren't traveling, the couple spent their time at home doing things they rarely had time for before, such as exercising together, reading, and going to the movies every week.\n\n\"Now, we have this objective of cooking something completely new every day,\" Gilchrist said.\n\nThe couple says they feel less stressed, sleep better, and have genuinely enjoyed spending more time together.\n\n\"We're like, 'OK, we're going to be together all day long. What is that going to look like?' And truthfully, I think it's been amazing,\" Gilchrist said.\n\nBut the biggest benefit of taking time away from work has been having the space to reflect on what they wanted to do next, Slough said. He started teaching three days a week at a local university.\n\n\"It's something I've always wanted to do,\" Slough said. \"And then it just happened to come my way.\"\n\nHad he been working full-time, taking up this offer would have been out of the question, he said.\n\nThey also realized they didn't have to return to their corporate jobs to live comfortably. They could earn a portion of what they once made and still maintain their lifestyle.\n\nWorking with a financial advisor helped them identify areas where they were overspending and set a goal to cut their regular expenses by 30%. Before that, the couple had never closely tracked their finances.\n\n\"We were spending so much that we thought we needed really high-paying jobs to be able to continue,\" Slough said.\n\nKyle D. Dennehy, a financial advisor at California Financial Advisor who wasn't involved in the couple's planning, told Business Insider that the first step in preparing for a career break is to create a detailed budget that outlines all income sources, expenses, and savings goals.\n\n\"Once you have your 'normal' budget, estimate how each specific category will shift during an adult gap year, but keep your long-term goal savings like retirement contributions included in the gap year budget,\" Dennehy said.\n\nOnce the difference between the regular and new budgets is clear, a plan can be created to regularly contribute toward the updated savings goal, Dennehy said.\n\nNow, the couple is exploring whether to buy and run a small local business rather than slip back into corporate jobs. Gilchrist said they might never have considered entrepreneurship without the break.\n\n\"We joke, and we say that this time has also been a research and development phase for us on, 'OK, what does being productive over the next 10, 20 years look like?'\" Gilchrist said.\n\nOf course, there are risks that come with taking an extended career break, but careful financial planning has helped them manage those uncertainties.\n\n\"Plan it properly. It can't just be like, 'Oh, I quit my job this weekend, and we're going to travel for a year.' It will not work,\" Slough said.\n\nDo you have a story to share about taking a career break?

    "description": "Lee Wan Yu, a former Disneyland parade dancer, shares a behind-the-scenes look at the audition process and what she learned from Disney's magic.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Lee Wan Yu, 30, a Hong Kong Disneyland parade dancer turned freelance dance artist, teacher, and choreographer. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI started dancing when I was three years old, after asking my mom for ballet lessons as we walked past a studio.\n\nFrom then on, all I wanted to do was dance. That love eventually led me somewhere I, as an introvert, never expected: Hong Kong Disneyland.\n\nIt started in 2017, when Hong Kong Disneyland held an audition at the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts in Singapore, where I was studying for my diploma in dance.\n\nI went with a friend who didn't want to go alone. I had no expectations and just wanted to see how a professional audition works.\n\nAbout 50 dancers from the region participated in the audition.\n\nThey gave us a short jazz combination and had us perform it in small groups, cutting dancers until about 20 of us were left. They took our photos, measured our height, and recorded our body measurements.\n\nMonths later, while I was studying for my fine arts degree in New York, I was offered a standard one-year contract as a parade dancer at Hong Kong Disneyland.\n\nWhen I arrived in May 2018, I realized I was the only Singaporean parade dancer at the time. The team included dancers from Hong Kong, Japan, the Philippines, Russia, Taiwan, and Thailand.\n\nA typical day started around 11 a.m. We had a warm-up class, followed by makeup and costumes.\n\nWe typically performed two parades a day, one in the afternoon and one at night, for about 30 minutes each. During festive seasons like Christmas, we could have up to four parades a day.\n\nIn the middle of each parade, we would stop in front of the castle for a short \"show stop\" to interact with guests.\n\nRehearsals for the Halloween parades sometimes ended around 2 a.m. because they took place after the park closed for the night.\n\nThe Hong Kong heat can be terrible, and the night-parade costumes had lights wired through and batteries attached. You could feel the weight pressing on your shoulders.\n\nSometimes I felt homesick or lonely, but once you're in costume, you have to bring your full energy.\n\nWhen you step into Disneyland, you should feel like you're transported to a different world — a place where you can disconnect, forget your problems for a while, and just be happy.\n\nThis is why guests would never see dancers working out during breaks, because Disney wanted to keep the illusion. We were also not allowed to take any backstage photos or videos.\n\nThe magic is the reason some guests come to every parade. There were adults who followed the route, taking photos, and kids who waved at us every day. I remember a teenage boy who came almost every weekend, dancing beside the route the whole time.\n\nSome of them recognized us outside the park without our costumes. Others gave us prints of photos they had taken of us.\n\nIt was more than just branding and the experience.\n\nAt Hong Kong Disneyland, everyone, from the dancers to the sound crew, respected one another. Even when people were tired, they were still polite. That attitude really stuck with me.\n\nI learned that how I treat people — not just the audience, but also my colleagues, the costume team, and the stage managers — really affects how smoothly everything runs and whether people want to be around you.\n\nOn the other side, Disney valued its performers. It was very serious about safety and well-being. We had good medical insurance, which is important for dancers.\n\nAfter one year, I decided not to re-audition for contract renewal. I wanted to explore new challenges.\n\nI'm now a freelance dancer, teacher, and choreographer in Singapore, where I try to infuse Disney's spirit of \"magic\" into my work.\n\nDance training can be stressful for kids, especially during exams or competitions, so I try to keep that sense of fun alive and create an environment where my students feel safe and excited to learn.\n\nThe magic is about creating that little moment in class where someone feels proud or inspired.\n\nI also try to bring that same magic into my choreography. AI plays a small part in helping me express my ideas.\n\nAs a choreographer, I often have to write synopses for school performances or competitions, and that part is difficult because dancers think in movement, not in sentences.\n\nRecently, I started using ChatGPT to help organize my ideas. I don't let it write for me, but I use it to structure what I already have and express my thoughts more clearly.\n\nI'm also open to trying AI software for large-scale productions with apps that can help with pinpoint formations, map things out, and visualise spacing.\n\nOver the past two years, I was a choreographer for Singapore's National Day Parade performances, overseeing close to 600 students for one of them. I remember spending weeks figuring out formations by hand, staying up until 3 a.m. or 4 a.m., moving people around in Excel.\n\nIf AI could help with that, it would save so much time.\n\nBut technology can only assist — the emotion behind the movement still has to come from people.",

He attacked fellow commentators in deeply personal terms, saying some of the right's most popular figures are morally bankrupt.\n\nCandace Owens “has been vomiting all sorts of hideous and conspiratorial nonsense into the public square for years,” he said.\n\nMegyn Kelly is “guilty of cowardice\" because she's refused to condemn Owens for spreading unsubstantiated theories about Kirk's death.\n\nAnd Tucker Carlson's decision to host antisemite Nick Fuentes on his podcast was “an act of moral imbecility.”\n\nBarely an hour later, Carlson took the same stage and mocked Shapiro’s attempt to “deplatform and denounce” people who disagree with him.\n\n“I watched it,” he said. “I laughed.”\n\nOthers had their chance the next night.\n\n“Ben Shapiro is like a cancer, and that cancer spreads,” said Steve Bannon, a former Trump adviser.\n\nKelly belittled Shapiro as a marginal figure in the conservative movement and said their friendship is over.\n\n“I resent that he thinks he’s in a position to decide who must say what, to whom, and when,” Kelly said.\n\nOwens, who has spread unsubstantiated conspiracy theories about Charlie Kirk's death, wasn't welcome at the convention. But she responded on her podcast, calling Shapiro a “miserable imp.\"\n\nA schism over Israel and antisemitism\n\nIsrael came up repeatedly during the conference.\n\nSome on the right have questioned whether the Republican Party's historically steadfast support for Israel conflicts with Trump's “America First” platform. Carlson criticized civilian deaths in Gaza in remarks that wouldn't have been out of place in progressive circles.\n\nSome attendees dug deep into history, highlighting Israel's attack on the USS Liberty off the Sinai Peninsula in 1967. Israel said it mistook the ship for an Egyptian vessel during the Six Day War, while critics have argued that it was a deliberate strike.\n\nBannon accused Shapiro, who is Jewish, and others who staunchly support Israel of being part of “the Israel first crowd.” Kelly said criticism from Shapiro and Bari Weiss, the newly installed head of CBS News, “is about Israel.\"\n\nVance gets a helpful endorsement\n\nErika Kirk pledged Turning Point’s support for Vice President JD Vance to be the next Republican presidential nominee.\n\n“We are going to get my husband’s friend JD Vance elected for 48 in the most resounding way possible,” she said on the first night of the convention. Vance would be the 48th president if he takes office after Trump.\n\nTurning Point is a major force on the right, with a massive volunteer network around the country that can be especially helpful in early primary states.\n\nVance was close with Charlie Kirk, whose backing helped enable his rapid political rise. The vice president is scheduled to close out the convention as the final speaker on Sunday.\n\nThe Make America Healthy Again movement had a big presence at Turning Point, signaling its quick rise in the right-wing ecosystem.\n\nMAHA is spearheaded by Robert F. Kennedy, who leads the Department of Health and Human Services. However, there has been friction with other parts of the Make America Great Again coalition, particularly when it comes to rolling back environmental regulations.\n\nWellness influencer Alex Clark, whose podcast is sponsored by Turning Point, asked the crowd whether the Environmental Protection Agency is “with us or against us?”\n\n“Big chemical, big ag and big food are trying to split MAGA from MAHA so things can go back to business as usual, but we don’t want that, do we?” Clark said.\n\nClark and others have asked for Trump to fire EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, who responded by reaching out to MAHA activists. The EPA also said it would release a MAHA agenda for the agency.\n\n“The Trump EPA wants to partner with the MAHA community and make sure everyone has a seat at the table,” EPA press secretary Carolyn Holran said in response to Clark's speech.",

    "fullText": "We're in the thick of the holiday season, and that can only mean one thing on Wall Street: Blackstone's annual holiday video is out.\n\nThe tongue-in-cheek video leans into the private equity shop's 40th anniversary with a mocking tribute to its 1980s origins. It riffs on everything from Ken Burns-style narration, including an abrupt firing of Burns himself in favor of some \"pizzazz,\" to execs dancing their way through \"Dirty Dancing\"-style choreography.\n\nExecutives portraying the firm's mid-life crisis include one who wears a nose ring and others who want to buy sports teams or Ferrari (the company). Cameos include actor Danny DeVito pitching jargon-filled investment products, as well as Goldman Sachs CEO (and side-hustling DJ) David Solomon.\n\nThe seven-and-a-half-minute video concludes with Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman and President Jon Gray in a parody of the \"Back to the Future\" movie.\n\nBlackstone is no stranger to quirky holiday videos. In fact, this was their 8th in a row (see where this year's video lands in BI's power ranking).\n\nYou might be wondering: Why does Blackstone spend so much time, effort, and money on such a thing, especially when few other financial firms do? Apollo produced its own holiday video in 2022, but this year the private-equity firm appears to have pivoted to publishing.\n\nBlackstone produced its first holiday video in 2018 as a replacement for its New York holiday party, as the firm had grown too large. Earlier this month, at a conference, Gray said the video was a way for the world's largest private investor to \"make fun of ourselves.\"\n\nBlackstone's video ends on a poignant note in memory of Wesley LePatner, a Blackstone executive who was killed in the tragic summer shooting at the firm's NYC headquarters. The video said she \"always made us smile.\"",

    "description": "New Rochelle Mayor Yadira Ramos-Herbert talked with Business Insider about how her NYC suburb is building lots of new housing and keeping costs down.",
    "fullText": "In a year full of abundance discourse, New Rochelle Mayor Yadira Ramos-Herbert is living the abundance agenda.\n\nThe skyline of her Westchester County city, just 20 miles north of Manhattan, is barely recognizable from a decade ago. New apartment and condo towers have shot up, the city's population is booming, and rents and home prices haven't risen nearly as fast as in other cities in the region and across the US.\n\nThe city plans to fulfill its goal of adding 11,000 units in about 32 buildings in several years, growing the city's housing stock by 37%, according to the Wall Street Journal. The mayor told Business Insider the city is about two-thirds of the way to its goal.\n\nAnd the efforts are showing signs of success. Median rents in New Rochelle rose by just 7% between 2017 and 2023, according to a Pew analysis of Apartment List data. That's compared to a 31% median rent increase nationwide.\n\nOver the last decade, the city has supercharged housing construction by overhauling zoning laws, streamlining environmental review, and offering new tax breaks to developers. The city has focused on revitalizing its downtown by building homes on underutilized commercial and parking lots near rail and bus stations.\n\n\"We weren't tearing down homes. We weren't tearing down existing apartment buildings,\" Ramos-Herbert said in an interview this fall with Business Insider. \"We were just leveraging underutilized sites and catalyzing them through the development.\"\n\nThe new homes don't just impact New Rochelle's 85,000 residents. They have implications for the entire region, which is suffering from one of the most severe housing shortages in the country. New York City relies on its suburbs to house a big portion of its workers and absorb a steady stream of people leaving the five boroughs.\n\nWhile the Big Apple builds less housing per capita than most other major cities in the US, many of its suburbs have an even more dismal record. Between 2010 and 2021, the New York suburbs approved just 13 new homes for every 1,000 residents — about half the rate of the Big Apple.\n\nThere's been some opposition to all the new construction in New Rochelle among locals. There are concerns about traffic, lack of parking, and noise from construction sites. But her constituents also worry that the shiny towers are being filled with transplants, rather than New Rochelle locals in need of affordable housing.\n\nThe mayor said that gentrification concerns are overblown. She noted that 22% of the residents in the new housing are from New Rochelle, and 21% are from surrounding towns in Westchester County. That's compared to 33% who've come from New York City. The new units have given locals a smaller home to downsize to, or a way to shorten their commute by living within walking distance of an Amtrak and Metro-North rail station, she said.\n\n\"These are not strangers. These are our friends. These are your kids' friends,\" she said. \"These are your parents.\"\n\nThe city has been hailed as a model for communities that need to boost housing production amid severe affordability challenges. New Rochelle isn't alone in the region — Jersey City has also built housing at a rapid clip in recent years, becoming another model for YIMBYs to point to.\n\nRamos-Herbert's advice to other cities and communities: start by building transit-oriented development on underutilized commercial plots.\n\nShe also touted the critical income the new housing and residents bring in for the city through property taxes and sales tax, allowing it to invest in infrastructure and programs that benefit everyone. She pointed to the $100 million renovation of the city's train station and the transformation of a highway that divides a historically Black neighborhood into a linear park and local road.\n\n\"You can only tax so much,\" she said. \"We have to kind of create, ensure, proactive creation of alternative revenue streams to support us.\"",

    "title": "'Every day something's coming down the pipe': How the CEO of Booking Holdings responds to a crisis",
    "description": "Booking Holdings CEO Glenn Fogel told Business Insider that the company's experience navigating crises helps it respond to new challenges.",
    "fullText": "Many companies have navigated recent economic and geopolitical uncertainties — but the CEO of travel conglomerate Booking Holdings has faced a steady stream of crises over the last two decades.\n\nTo name a few: the dot-com bubble, 9/11, the 2008 market crash, SARS-1, volcanoes, tsunamis, the pandemic, tariffs, and various wars. CEO Glenn Fogel told Business Insider there's something happening in the world every day.\n\n\"Every day something's coming down the pipe,\" Fogel said.\n\nPart of dealing with a crisis involves planning in advance whenever possible. For example, Fogel explained that when tensions started to heat up between Russia and Ukraine, a region where the company operates, they began to prepare contingency plans \"just in case.\"\n\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine became public just hours after the company's earnings call in February 2022. As the situation developed, Booking Holdings supported employees abroad and navigated expected sanctions. That led to the company's decision to suspend travel services in Russia and Belarus in March 2022, the company said.\n\nFogel, who's been with the company for over 25 years, isn't a stranger to navigating complicated situations. He outlined his crisis response approach, starting with the people he keeps on speed dial to how he manages stress.\n\nWhen a crisis arises, Fogel said the first people he contacts are the company's executive officers, including the general counsel, chief financial officer, and chief HR officer.\n\nNext, he works to identify the problem and which part of the business it affects. As a global travel conglomerate, Fogel said issues can impact different regions in different ways.\n\nThe CEO added that the company's long history of navigating challenges has helped it respond effectively when new problems arise. He said he reminds himself that there is an end to every crisis. For example, with COVID, he said he didn't know when a vaccine would come out, but he knew one eventually would.\n\n\"It helps you've already been through a lot before,\" Fogel said. \"It's not the first rodeo.\"\n\nWhen it comes to managing the stress of the job, Fogel said he practices meditation.\n\n\"I'd like to do it every day,\" Fogel said.\n\nHe said his other non-negotiable is exercise, which he always does before work nearly every day. Fogel does light weightlifting year-round and swims in the summer.\n\nEven when he's traveling — which is more often than he's home, he said — he makes time for a workout at his hotel, squeezing in email responses during lower-intensity sessions.",

    "description": "Corporate types are waiting weeks for — and spending big on — alloClae, which cuts out the recovery time typically associated with body enhancements.",
    "fullText": "In his plush Upper East Side office earlier this year, Dr. Sachin Shridharani was at work on a patient's breasts: applying a local anesthesia, making an incision, ensuring the final result sat just right.\n\nThrough it all, his patient — an executive — had her AirPods in. She was on a conference call with a client, Shridharani told Business Insider. Less than two hours after she walked in, she popped up, checked out her new physique, and dashed off to her office.\n\nAs recently as a year ago, a typical boob job would have involved general anesthesia and a multiday recovery.\n\nBut Shridharani was using alloClae, a new product from manufacturer Tiger Aesthetics that's becoming increasingly popular with patients eager to look their best in the boardroom without undergoing general anesthesia or taking days off for recovery.\n\nRather than relying on an implant or a patient's own body fat to add volume to hips or augment breasts, alloClae — which can cost as much as $100,000 per procedure — uses donor fat from a cadaver as a first-of-its-kind body filler.\n\n\"People are paying for the convenience,\" Shridharani, who has done more than 50 procedures with alloClae and was part of its trial, said. \"It's about not having the downtime, not needing more aggressive procedures, not having an anesthetic.\"\n\nBusiness Insider spoke to a half dozen plastic surgeons, largely based in New York and California, who, together, have completed around 75 procedures with alloClae since it became available earlier this year. They described wealthy executives and corporate types clamoring for the product, booking 6 a.m. visits so they could make it to work by 7, and using the filler to look better in their suits — work, not swim, that is. Demand for alloClae has outpaced supply, resulting in a shortage and backlog of appointments.\n\nWhile many of their alloClae patients are high-ranking professionals looking for a quick zhuzh, there are several other reasons people opt for the product. Some lack sufficient body fat for a typical transfer collected through liposuction. Others don't want the loose skin that can be associated with lipo. Some simply don't want to deal with anesthesia.\n\nTake Gretchen Seal, the 57-year-old CFO at global telecommunications company Convo Relay, who got alloClae in September to smooth out the edge of a breast implant and used extra product to fill out hip dips. The numbing took longer than the procedure itself, which clocked in under 40 minutes, she said.\n\n\"I got in my car, and I drove straight home from the procedure, and I went to work,\" Seal said.\n\nEven with the hip enhancement, she spent the afternoon sitting comfortably at her desk.\n\nThe rise in GLP-1s has contributed to the alloClae fervor. It's not only Ozempic face — it's deflated Ozempic boobs, hips, butt.\n\nShridharani has male patients who have lost weight on the likes of Ozempic, only to find they don't quite fill out their suits the way they used to.\n\n\"In their own words, 'I've got no ass,'\" he said. \"'My trousers look like they're falling off.'\"\n\nIn a workforce that prioritizes appearances — studies have shown more attractive people get paid more — alloClae is becoming the C-suite's secret weapon.\n\nalloClae is part of a larger boom in less-invasive cosmetic procedures.\n\nThe annual number of minimally invasive procedures, from Botox to lip fillers, is growing faster than surgical cosmetic procedures, reaching over 28 million last year, according to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.\n\n\"It was all about the lunchtime Botox procedure,\" Caroline Van Hove, the president of Tiger Aesthetics, said. \"That is still the appeal of medically aesthetic products that are minimally invasive, meaning you have little downtime.\"\n\nTiger Aesthetics, which also provides implants and traditional fillers, began offering alloClae to a select group of doctors in the fall of 2024, followed by a soft rollout to a few hundred surgeons this past spring, and a full launch that's planned early next year, Van Hove said. The company didn't disclose how many patients have used the product.\n\nWhile alloClae comes from a cadaver, the product is less macabre than you may think, and even patients who may be turned off by the whole dead body thing typically come around to it, Dr. Bob Basu, the president of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, said.\n\nWhen individuals donate their bodies for science, such as organ donations, tissue banks often collect abdominal fat cells. Tiger Aesthetics purchases that fat, screens it for diseases, purifies it, and processes it. By the end, it looks like clumpy butter in a syringe.\n\nThe process means Tiger Aesthetics is \"at the mercy of donated tissue,\" Van Hove said. The company aims to increase its intake of donor fat as it expands its manufacturing facilities and is exploring ways to improve tissue yields, she said.\n\n\"As of the beginning of 2026, we'll be producing a ton more alloClae so that we can service the real demand that's out there,\" Van Hove said.\n\nalloClae is regulated by the FDA. Van Hove said the approval process differs from that of implants or medications like Botox, as it's sold under a different designation.\n\nWhile other products that use donor fat exist, alloClae is unique in its composition and the volume in which it is administered. Most patients use between 50 and 100 CCs, Van Hove said, though doctors that Business Insider spoke with have used as much as 550 CCs on a patient. By comparison, Renuva, a donor fat product made by MTF Biologics, is typically dispensed in much smaller quantities and used on the face. (alloClae is not recommended for the face.)\n\nalloClae's convenience comes at a cost, depending on how much donor fat you want.\n\nDoctors said the procedures, including the doctor's fees and the price of the alloClae itself, can cost a customer between $10,000 and $100,000. If a patient gets 100 or 200 CCs — enough for a slight contour of the hip or filling out of the breast — the cost is pretty much in line with the cost of a typical fat transfer, Shridharani said. More than that, the steep cost of alloClae quickly adds up.\n\nWhere a typical breast augmentation with an implant at an upscale office like Shridharani's would start at $15,000, a minor breast adjustment using alloClae starts at $12,000 and could exceed $30,000 depending on the desired volume.\n\n\"The thing that shocks me a little bit is just how expensive the product is, but still the willingness of patients to pay for it,\" said San Francisco-based plastic surgeon Dr. David Sieber, who hasn't yet injected alloClae but has patients waiting for the product.\n\nThat willingness comes even without long-term, proven results.\n\nSo far, the doctors who spoke with Business Insider have said the initial results are promising, but as Basu said, there's been no three- or five-year follow-up yet.\n\nThe procedures he has done with alloClae are all \"subtle refinements,\" he said. \"It is not go big or go home.\"\n\nDouglas Steinbrech, who has medical practices for men in New York City, Beverly Hills, and Chicago, has a term he uses at the office: \"C-level surgery.\" C as in C-suite — and among that crowd, alloClae has been graded A+.\n\n\"The CEOs, COOs, CCOs that don't want to be away from the boardroom,\" Steinbrech told Business Insider. He has primarily had men get alloClae put in their shoulders and chests.\n\n\"They have to go to a lot of meetings that just pop up, and they cannot control when they're going to happen. They can't just clear their schedule to recover for a surgery,\" he added.\n\nOften, patients return to the office the same day as their procedure, or get the injection in the afternoon and go back the next morning.\n\nFor Seal, the CFO, liposuction was never a viable option because she doesn't have enough fat to transfer. When she learned that a breast lift surgery to fix her implant would necessitate weeks without getting on a plane to avoid blood clots, she knew it would never work with her job.\n\n\"My schedule changes so much,\" she said. \"I hop on planes to Silicon Valley, I go to New York, Washington.\"\n\nThat's when her plastic surgeon suggested alloClae. If she could bear the monthlong wait, she could get 100 CCs of the product — and none of the downtime.\n\n\"It worked beautifully,\" she said. \"I feel much more confident.\"\n\nDoctors say patients now come in asking for it by name — though it can be hard to find. Van Hove said the product is sold out until the end of January.\n\nBut good things come to those who wait. Dr. Adam Schaffner, who has had dozens of patients express interest in alloClae, was celebrating on the day he spoke to Business Insider — 400 CCs of the product had just been delivered to his New York City office.",

    "description": "Baz Costello, 48, plans to start his own company after struggling to find a tech job. He said one employer said he was \"too senior.\"",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Baz Costello, 48, who lives in Brighton and Hove, UK. He recently decided to start his own company after growing frustrated with his job search. The following has been edited for brevity and clarity.\n\nI was a consultant for a big digital consultancy up until November last year. I worked there as both a product lead and was also the chair of the neurodiversity employee resource group.\n\nAt the start of this year, I went back to contracting, and then I learned I had prostate cancer. It was stage one, and I was on active monitoring for six months. I did some more contracting up until July, when I was told I needed to have treatment. So, I had treatment, and all the signs were good. In August, I thought, \"OK, I can start looking to go back to work.\"\n\nI spoke to some recruitment agencies and public-sector IT consultancies I had worked with before, and one of the things I picked up from that — and from searching on job boards — was that the number of roles had decreased.\n\nWhen it comes to looking for work, LinkedIn becomes your daily go-to tool. For someone with ADHD, it's a double-edged sword. You can set up filters and get told when new jobs are coming up. But it's also this meandering pathway of links that you can disappear down for hours and hours. It can become another doomscrolling mechanism. I'm guilty of doing a lot of that.\n\nI noticed a slow but steady increase in posts about \"I've been out of work for six months\" and \"I'm going to have to sell my house. I don't know how I'm going to look after my kids.\" The negativity — it impacts you.\n\nAt one point, I got a message on LinkedIn from a recruiter who worked for a digital-transformation company who said, \"We think you'd be suited for this role.\" It was for a senior project manager. I had two video interviews. Both went really well, but one of the things I noticed was that executives were a lot younger than me.\n\nI then got an email back asking to meet for 30 minutes with the practice lead. It felt like a check for cultural fit. She seemed to be a bit younger than me. We seemed to hit off pretty well. We talked about what I wanted from the role and what I could offer. Then, a couple of days later, the company said, \"You're too senior.\"\n\nYou cannot discriminate against someone because of their age, but it happens in myriad ways. \"Too senior\" is one of them. So is \"too much experience.\" I asked for feedback and was told, \"I wasn't sure that this would be fulfilling for you.\" I thought, \"How condescending. You approached me about this role, and I've read the job description, and we spoke at length about the role with three people. Not once have I said, 'This is beneath me.'\"\n\nAgeism is hidden in things like \"This is a dynamic, fast-paced work environment\" or \"This is a work-hard, play-hard environment.\" You take that to mean that on Friday afternoon, when we finish early, and all go down the pub, we don't want people who have to go pick up their kids. It's hidden, but it's still there.\n\nI'm 48. The problem is I look older. I'm Father Christmas in training. It's gotten to the point where I've had interviews and thought, \"Should I dye my hair? Should I wear a hat? Should I do something to try to look younger? Experience shouldn't be something you have to hide.\n\nI'm going to start my own thing. I have a concept for an app. I've been speaking with some non-executive directors and entrepreneurial advisors, getting advice and putting a strategy together. I have a background in product and technology. I can just bloody do this myself.\n\nI'm coming off LinkedIn because I need a bit more positivity. The promise I've made to myself is that the day I return, my first post will be, \"I am the founder of this thing, and I've come back to recruit. If you're too old, I want your experience. If you're too neurodiverse, I want your alternative perspective.\"\n\nDo you have a story to share about your job search? Contact this reporter at tparadis@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "TikTok's new US joint venture will hand over national-security related tasks to its partners, while ByteDance holds onto key business lines.",
    "fullText": "Is TikTok really selling its US business? Kind of.\n\nTikTok has reached an agreement that would give it a new set of owners in the US as part of a joint-venture agreement. Larry Ellison's Oracle, Abu Dhabi investment firm MGX, and private-equity firm Silver Lake are all coming on as managing investors in the US spin-off.\n\nBut how much influence will these investors have over the money-making side of the business? Not much, according to an internal memo TikTok CEO Shou Chew sent to employees on Thursday, viewed by Business Insider.\n\nThe new investors will focus on national security-related tasks, such as data management and algorithm training, while TikTok's current owner, ByteDance, will remain in charge of key business lines, including e-commerce and advertising.\n\nHere's what Chew told staff about the arrangement:\n\nAs laid out by Chew, TikTok's new investors aren't going to be in the driver's seat on core business lines like TikTok Shop or ad sales, even if they may still participate in the profits of the business. TikTok global, which will remain under ByteDance, will still run the show.\n\n\"Advertisers will continue to connect with global audiences with no impact,\" Chew also wrote in the memo.\n\nThe setup, which focuses a lot more on national security-related concerns than business tasks, may be why the White House said in September the deal would be valued at $14 billion, far lower than the $50 billion estimate from Morningstar analysts in June. My colleague Peter Kafka previously dug into the TikTok valuation question.\n\nIn the proposed structure of the deal, which Chew said should close in late January, Oracle, Silver Lake, and MGX will get a combined 45% stake in the US joint venture. Affiliates of existing ByteDance investors will grab around 30% ownership, and an unnamed group of new investors will take 5%.\n\nByteDance will maintain ownership of just under 20% of the US business, but retain oversight of the rest of the world and manage TikTok US's e-commerce, advertising, and marketing strategies.\n\nThat sounds like a pretty good setup for a company that spent much of 2024 and 2025 fighting to keep its US business alive after Congress passed a law forcing it to sell its US app or face a potential ban.\n\nThe question of who will actually be in charge of different parts of the business is paramount to employees at TikTok and ByteDance. Will they get a new boss or organizational structure after an agreement closes?\n\n\"Even though there's a deal, it doesn't say concretely yet what it means for us,\" one TikTok staffer said. They added that they weren't anticipating much change.\n\nTikTok, ByteDance, and MGX did not respond to requests for comment. Oracle and Silver Lake declined to comment.",

    "title": "AI layoffs could far outpace new jobs — past economic shocks reveal how fast that can fuel unrest, professor says",
    "description": "London Business School professor Ekaterina Abramova said that rapid AI disruption could outpace institutions and destabilize societies.",
    "fullText": "A historic labor shock may be about to hit the job market.\n\nThat's according to London Business School professor Ekaterina Abramova.\n\nShe said AI is advancing so quickly that it could trigger mass layoffs long before new jobs emerge to replace them — a mismatch that has historically fueled social unrest.\n\nAbramova, who studies technology-driven economic transitions, said the past three years of AI advances mark a sharp break from earlier waves of mechanization.\n\nIn past eras — from 18th-century textile automation to late-20th-century manufacturing decline — the impact was mostly gradual and largely contained to individual sectors, she said.\n\nBut AI is different: \"A single AI model can displace thousands of cognitive jobs across multiple industries overnight,\" she told Business Insider.\n\nAbramova expects layoffs to outstrip new job creation over the next five to 10 years, especially without aggressive retraining efforts.\n\nWhile the exact number of AI-related layoffs is unknown, several major companies have already cited AI as a reason to reduce head count or to announce job cuts.\n\nNew AI-related roles often require skills or credentials that many displaced workers lack, Abramova said, and entry-level positions — such as junior developers, analysts, and customer support staff — are already among the most vulnerable.\n\nPeter Orszag, CEO of Lazard and former director of the Office of Management and Budget under President Obama, sees a similar risk.\n\nSpeaking on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" this week, Orszag said that if AI delivers on its promise, there's likely to be a jobs crisis.\n\n\"Labor markets deal well with small problems that happen fast or big problems that happen slow. They do not deal well with big shocks that happen quickly,\" he said.\n\nAbramova said that the social risks extend far beyond unemployment numbers.\n\n\"History shows social strain emerges when the pace of economic change overtakes institutions' capacity to support displaced workers,\" she said.\n\nShe pointed to the UK's Enclosure Acts, which displaced tens of thousands of small farmers from common land, sparking riots and mass migration, and to the 1980s coal pit closures, which wiped out mining communities almost overnight and triggered years of strikes and political upheaval.\n\nBusiness leaders are divided over AI's impact on jobs, with Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei and Ford CEO Jim Farley warning of widespread white-collar displacement, while Elon Musk, JP Morgan's Jamie Dimon, and OpenAI's Sam Altman have predicted varying outcomes, ranging from significant disruption to long-term prosperity.\n\nOthers, such as Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Yann LeCun — Meta's outgoing chief AI scientist — say AI will transform work rather than erase it.\n\n\"It's very likely that the companies that use AI first, that use robotics technology first, will be the most successful first, and they will end up hiring more people,\" Huang said in late October.\n\n\"You're going to lose your job not to somebody — not to a robot, you're going to lose your job to somebody who uses a robot. You're going to lose your job to somebody who uses AI,\" he added.\n\nIf governments and employers fail to prepare, Abramova said she expects widening inequality, persistent unemployment, falling consumer demand, rising political anger, and even expanding surveillance as leaders try to contain discontent.\n\nIn extreme cases, she warned, democratic norms can erode.\n\nBut she also said that the worst outcomes aren't inevitable.\n\nThe alternative is worker-augmenting AI: systems where machines handle data-intensive tasks while humans retain judgment, ethics, and client relationships. That shift will require regulatory incentives that reward firms for responsible oversight, not just rapid headcount reduction.\n\n\"Without major support,\" Orszag said, \"many displaced workers risk long-term underemployment.\"",

    "title": "From McKinsey to PwC, here's how elite consulting firms are racing to hire engineers — and train everyone else in AI",
    "description": "Business Insider spoke to nine executives and industry insiders about how consulting's talent recruitment is changing.",
    "fullText": "AI is pushing consultants to their biggest-ever talent overhaul.\n\nAs firms shift from slide decks and advisory work to multi-year AI-driven transformation projects, the profile of the ideal consultant at firms like Boston Consulting Group, McKinsey, and PwC is changing.\n\n\"Going to a client and purely proposing an army of consultants doesn't really work anymore,\" Gert De Geyter, a former AI lead at Deloitte US, told Business Insider.\n\nInstead of the \"pure traditional consultant,\" firms are now looking for a blend of \"generalists and technical experts,\" said De Geyter, who left the firm in July to join AI startup Teragonia.\n\nBusiness Insider spoke to nine executives and industry insiders to understand how consulting firms are hiring, retraining, and redefining their workforces to meet the moment.\n\nThe work that consultants do is changing. Straight advisory projects are being replaced with building, implementing, and maintaining tools for companies, requiring technology expertise over research skills.\n\nHiring data reveals how aggressively top firms have been expanding their technologist ranks. Accenture's latest annual report shows it added nearly 40,000 AI and data professionals in the last two years. They now account for roughly 10% of its global head count. EY has added 61,000 technologists since 2023, according to its latest annual report.\n\nAt McKinsey, the \"AI engineer\" is the fastest-growing non-entry-level role, followed by procurement officer, data scientist, and software engineer, according to workforce intelligence company Revelio Labs.\n\nAt Boston Consulting Group, software engineers, frontend developers, and Python developers are the fastest-growing entry-level roles.\n\nBCG, which brought on 1,000 employees last year, has ramped up hiring technologists since launching its tech and AI arm, BCG X, in late 2022.\n\n\"We're essentially building a tech company inside a consulting firm,\" said Sylvain Duranton, Global Leader of BCG X. \"Our job has always been to help companies transform. But tech has become so critical to transformation that we needed to have a grip on it ourselves.\"\n\nIts regular consulting division is also adopting a more tech-centric mentality.\n\nScott Wilder, a BCG partner and managing director, told Business Insider that a new team, called \"forward deployed consultants,\" is rising through the ranks. It takes inspiration from a software engineering role popularized by Palantir, Wilder said.\n\nThese consultants are vibe-coding and building tools on client projects, he said. When one of these tools is a hit, it goes back to the R&D team and becomes a broader tool that everyone can use.\n\nFor firms like McKinsey and BCG, the must-have hire in the AI era isn't a pure engineer or a pure consultant — it's someone who can move between both worlds.\n\n\"What we want to be able to do is find those people that actually have a propensity to either be this great McKinsey consultant, and or a great technologist, and then groom them to be both,\" Alex Singla, a senior partner at McKinsey who co-leads its AI arm, QuantumBlack, told Business Insider.\n\nHe added that candidates also want hybrid roles: Many don't want to spend years building products for a cloud company like AWS, nor do they want to be traditional consultants.\n\nSingla said McKinsey is looking for \"5Xers — they're deep in one thing, but can do three or four different things well.\"\n\nQuantumBlack, with its 1,700-person team, drives all of McKinsey's AI initiatives, which account for 40% of the firm's work, but McKinsey's technical talent isn't limited to that group, Singla said. There are about 3,500 people building internal technology for McKinsey, and another 4,000 to 5,000 consultants who are leading the technical work from the business side, but don't necessarily have technical expertise.\n\nThe consulting talent landscape has been in flux since the pandemic, when a surge in demand prompted top firms to aggressively staff up. As that boom faded and demand for advisory work slowed, many firms found themselves overstaffed, triggering layoffs and a more selective approach to hiring.\n\nAmid the shifting market, the traditional pyramid model — built on large cohorts of junior consultants — started to recalibrate as firms focused on roles that deliver value over manpower. That focus has only sharpened with the rise of AI, prompting firms to invest heavily in upskilling their existing workforces.\n\n\"Everyone is reckoning with the fact that AI has exploded onto the scene,\" Saurabh Sarbaliya, PwC's AI Lead, told Business Insider.\n\n\"The demand for people who can make AI work in the enterprise is only going to grow — but there just aren't enough experts. So you have to focus on upskilling your existing workforce,\" he said.\n\nAt KPMG, Sam Gloede, the firm's global trusted AI leader, said it is prioritizing upskilling over hiring.\n\n\"There is not a massive change in our workforce,\" Gloede said. \"It's just a focus on upskilling, literacy, and learning.\"\n\nEY is taking a similar approach and prioritizing the AI capabilities of its employees, Imgard Naudin ten Cate, EY's global leader of talent acquisition, told Business Insider.\n\nIn October, EY held a two-week learning event to teach employees to build AI agents for use in their day-to-day work. The firm has also rolled out 15-hour courses on topics including AI engineering, applied AI, and AI compliance.\n\nNearly 100,000 employees — roughly a quarter of the workforce — have earned a digital \"AI badge\" for completing one of the courses, said Simon Brown, EY's global learning and development leader. The initiative has been \"a phenomenal way at scale to build deep AI knowledge,\" he added.\n\nTechnologist roles are in high demand, but don't expect a team of hoodie-wearing Silicon Valley types when your company hires consultants. Most in the industry are still generalists with strong problem-solving and communication skills — and they'll likely show up in a suit.\n\nEven as firms hire more technologists, most consulting work still doesn't require deep engineering expertise. Traditional consulting roles at top firms are still on the rise, growing from 250,000 globally in 2022 to 340,000 in 2024, according to Revelio Labs.\n\n\"A lot of the clients are still just dipping their toes in the AI pond, so over-engineering solutions for them doesn't work,\" said de Geyter, the former AI lead at Deloitte US. \"It's a lot more helpful that someone supports them with setting up the right data governance so they can get ready for AI solutions down the line.\"\n\nA senior software engineer at Deloitte, who requested anonymity as they are not permitted to speak to the media, told Business Insider that the technical literacy of most employees is improving, but remains in a \"very nascent state.\"\n\n\"They're looking less for people who know the inners of how these black box models work or could train one themselves, and more at people who can quickly leverage them for a specific solution set,\" the person said.\n\nStill, they warned that the current skill level poses a strategic risk: \"We can't let it continue for too long.\"\n\nJim Rowan, head of AI at Deloitte US, told Business Insider that its employees have \"the latest technologies and certifications to effectively work with machines and unlock even more impactful business outcomes for clients.\" Deloitte is not just hiring more data engineers and technologists, but \"actively investing\" in upskilling its workforce, Rowan said.\n\nSeveral leaders told Business Insider that soft skills are becoming more relevant now that AI can perform specific quantitative tasks.\n\n\"When we get asked a question of what we are looking for when we recruit, the core fundamental thing is actually attitude,\" Niale Cleobury, KPMG's AI workforce lead, said. Communication, collaboration, and agile learning — \"the sort of things AI can't really do\" — are the standout qualities, he said.\n\nMcKinsey is still active on college campuses recruiting undergraduates, MBAs, and PhDs, said Kate Smaje, McKinsey's global leader of technology and AI.\n\nIn its screening process, McKinsey emphasizes elements of judgment and conceptual thinking in problem-solving, resilience, and the ability to learn quickly.\n\nThe ability to build relationships and the core EQ leadership qualities can be \"fairy dust\" on top of what you can do analytically that will now set you apart, said Smaje.\n\n\"What we really hire for is voracious learners, people who are curious about the world and have the ability to learn, unlearn, and relearn,\" she said. \"Those are the people we really want.\"\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "A source in the Security Service of Ukraine told Business Insider that the attack was carried out more than 1,240 miles away.",
    "fullText": "Ukrainian forces used long-range drones to strike an oil tanker said to be part of Russia's \"shadow fleet\" in the Mediterranean Sea for the first time, a security source told Business Insider on Friday.\n\nThe attack, carried out over 1,240 miles from Ukrainian territory, represents a dramatic expansion of Kyiv's push to target Russia's vast energy sector, a key source of revenue fueling its war machine.\n\nUkraine had previously limited its attacks to land-based targets, such as oil refineries and port infrastructure. In recent weeks, though, it has begun striking tankers in the Black Sea and facilities in the Caspian Sea — and now it's hitting targets in the Mediterranean.\n\nA source in the Security Service of Ukraine, the SBU, called the drone attack an \"unprecedented special operation\" that targeted and critically damaged the tanker Qendil. The source was only authorized to speak on the condition of anonymity to discuss military developments.\n\nThe SBU source said the Qendil wasn't carrying any oil cargo at the time of the attack, so there isn't any risk to the environment. Footage shows several explosions on the exterior of the tanker.\n\nPublicly available ship-tracking data show that the Qendil was sailing under the flag of Oman. It's unclear when the attack took place; the vessel last reported its location on Friday sailing off the coast of Libya in the eastern Mediterranean.\n\nNeither Russia's defense ministry nor its US embassy immediately responded to a request for comment on the attack.\n\nUkraine has attacked at least four tankers, including the Qendil, that have been identified as belonging to the \"shadow fleet\" since late November. There are hundreds of vessels in the fleet, which Moscow relies on to transport oil and circumvent sanctions on its energy exports.\n\nRussia used the Qendil \"to circumvent sanctions and earn money that went to the war against Ukraine,\" the SBU source said in translated remarks shared with Business Insider, calling the ship a \"legitimate target\" for the SBU.\n\nThe enemy must understand that Ukraine will not stop and will beat him anywhere in the world, wherever he is,\" they added.\n\nSince August, Ukraine has stepped up its use of long-range drone strikes to target Russian energy infrastructure in an effort to squeeze a key source of revenue for Moscow. While the campaign initially focused on land-based facilities, Kyiv has recently expanded it to maritime targets, hitting oil tankers in the Black and Mediterranean seas and striking three oil platforms in the Caspian Sea.\n\nThe expansion to maritime targets appears to reflect a shift in Kyiv's strategy as it continues to press its international partners to be more aggressive in clamping down on Russian oil exports.\n\nUkrainian officials have described the ongoing deep-strike campaign as \"long-range\" sanctions against Moscow. These operations have been a bright spot for Kyiv as it faces incremental — but costly — Russian gains on the battlefield.",

    "description": "TikTok has reached a deal to sell parts of its US business. Oracle, Silver Lake, and MGX are part of the consortium of new investors.",
    "fullText": "Who's grabbing control of TikTok's US assets?\n\nOn Thursday, TikTok told staffers it had signed a deal to form a joint venture for its US business with a group of investors, according to an internal memo sent by CEO Shou Chew, which was viewed by Business Insider. The company expects the deal to close in late January, per the memo.\n\nThree managing investors will each hold a 15% stake in the new venture: Oracle, private equity firm Silver Lake, and Abu Dhabi-based investment firm MGX.\n\nFive percent of the US company will go to an unnamed group of new investors, while ByteDance, TikTok's owner, will maintain a 19.9% minority stake — the maximum allowed by the divest-or-ban law that spurred TikTok's sale. The remaining 30.1% will be controlled by an undisclosed group of existing ByteDance investors, according to the memo.\n\nIn September, President Donald Trump said Larry Ellison and his company, Oracle, would be involved in a $14 billion deal to buy TikTok's US business. At the time, Trump mentioned billionaires Rupert Murdoch and Michael Dell would also play a role, but it is unclear if they are involved in the current deal.\n\nOracle, which currently works with TikTok on data security, is expected to continue to be its \"trusted security partner\" tasked with safeguarding \"sensitive US user data,\" Chew wrote in his memo to staffers.\n\nTikTok's new US owners will retrain the content recommendation algorithm on US user data \"to ensure the content feed is free from outside manipulation,\" per the memo.\n\nTikTok did not respond to requests for comment. The White House referred Business Insider to TikTok. A spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry, when asked about the deal, referred press to \"competent authorities for anything specific,\" noting that \"China's position on TikTok is consistent and clear.\"\n\nHere are the key players in TikTok's US business going forward:\n\nSoftware giant Oracle will take a 15% stake in TikTok's US joint venture, according to the memo viewed by Business Insider.\n\nPrior to the recent deal, Oracle was already working closely with TikTok's US Data Security division (USDS). Oracle has stored US TikTok users' data for years as a safeguard for potential data leaks.\n\nLarry Ellison, who is also a financial participant in a bidding war for Warner Bros. Discovery's business, is the chairman and cofounder of Oracle and a longtime Trump ally.\n\nMGX is a state-owned investment firm in Abu Dhabi.\n\nAccording to the internal memo, it will also take a 15% stake in the new TikTok entity as one of three managing investors.\n\nSheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, a member of Abu Dhabi's royal ruling family, is the firm's chairman. The fund participated in OpenAI's $6.6 billion investment round in 2024.\n\nMGX did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nSilver Lake is a tech-focused private equity firm.\n\nThe firm will take a 15% stake in the new TikTok entity, per the internal memo.\n\nIts current investments include Klarna, Carta, Dell Technologies, Genies, and Waymo, per the firm's website. Previous investments include Airbnb, Twitter, and Tesla.\n\nEgon Durban and Greg Mondre both act as co-CEO and managing partner at the private equity firm.\n\nSilver Lake declined to comment.\n\nAccording to the memo, \"affiliates of certain existing investors\" in ByteDance will hold a combined 30.1% of the new entity.\n\nPrivate equity giant KKR and venture capital firms, such as Sequoia Capital and SoftBank, have previously invested in ByteDance. It's not yet clear which of these investors will retain shares in the new US entity.\n\nSequoia Capital did not respond to a request for comment. KKR and SoftBank declined to comment.\n\nWhile 95% of ownership in the new TikTok US joint venture will fall under Oracle, Silver Lake, MGX, ByteDance, and its earlier investors, the remaining 5% stake will pass to an unnamed group of \"new investors,\" per TikTok's memo.\n\nTrump previously said that billionaires Michael Dell and Rupert Murdoch may be involved in the TikTok deal, so it's possible that they could fall within this mystery investor set.",

    "fullText": "CHICAGO, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Allyson Lopez had been hoping for business to bounce back at her dress shop in Chicago's Little Village neighborhood, which specializes in ballgowns for quinceaneras, a coming-of-age ritual in many Latino communities celebrating a girl's 15th birthday. Instead, this week brought the return of the federal immigration raids that have emptied the normally vibrant streets.\n\nThe first phase of the Department of Homeland Security deportation campaign, named \"Operation ​Midway Blitz,\" racked up over 4,200 arrests across the city in under three months. The operation rattled Chicago, but for Little Village, the working-class Mexican neighborhood that was repeatedly targeted, the effect has been catastrophic.\n\nThe return of roving U.S. ‌Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino on Tuesday in a large convoy of agents in camouflage, some with assault rifles peeking through car windows, was met by jeers and whistles from dozens of protesters who livestreamed the encounters on social media.\n\nAt Estela's Bridal, a second-generation family business, Lopez specializes in custom designs, which sell for ‌an average of $1,000. It can take 16 hours to make a dress, fitting the shimmering fabrics to size, and adding embroidered flowers, rhinestones and sequins. She said she lost 90% of her clients during the first wave of arrests as people decided to stay home out of fear of immigration agents.\n\nBUSINESS STRUGGLES TO MAKE RENT\n\n\"We’re going to suffer again as businesses,\" Lopez said. “We didn’t even make the rent this month, so it’s scary.\"\n\nA DHS spokesperson did not respond when asked about the impact of the raids on businesses.\n\nEven before Bovino's return, Little Village had been deflated by the raids.\n\nThe tourists who came to the \"Mexican Capital of the Midwest\" to eat tacos, sweet bread and tamales and to shop for quinceanera dresses, pinatas and Mexican chiles disappeared. Dozens of neighborhood residents were detained or deported, community leaders said. Others went ⁠into hiding.\n\n\"It's like those old Western movies where all you see is tumbleweeds blowing in ‌the breeze,” said Roxana, a 42-year-old hair salon owner from Guatemala. She declined to share her last name or immigration status out of fear of retaliation from immigration agents.\n\nIn her empty hair salon, with half the chairs wrapped in plastic, Roxana pulled back her neatly styled bangs to reveal patches of thinning hair, which she said started falling out from the stress of an 80% drop in revenue since ‍the start of the immigration enforcement campaign.\n\nAs the Border Patrol convoy descended on Little Village again this week, Roxana shuddered. The salon was open, but devoid of customers.\n\n\"They've broken into the neighborhood again,\" she said. \"It's definitely shocked and devastated us because it wasn't something that we were expecting.\"\n\nA NEIGHBORHOOD'S COMMERCIAL HEART\n\nRoxana's salon sits near the stucco arch that marks the beginning of 26th Street, a two-mile-long strip of shops, bakeries and restaurants that has become the second-most profitable shopping corridor in the city, according to the Little Village Chamber of Commerce. Many business owners said their savings dwindled ​after customers, including people who are in the U.S. legally, stopped visiting for fear of immigration officers.\n\nBefore the immigration crackdown, the shops selling elaborate ballgowns, glittering tiaras and satin flower bouquets, were joyous places, where girls giggled and twirled in their dresses ‌to the satisfaction of their mothers, shop owners said.\n\nBut anxiety over venturing outside – as well as fears that big parties could become targets for immigration enforcement – have hit Little Village’s quinceanera shops hard.\n\nTwo shop owners said they lost 90% of their revenue to the initial stages of Midway Blitz.\n\nEvelyn Flores, the owner of the Alborada quinceanera store, said she laid off seven staff members. “I can't sleep at night right now, and during the day I'm always freaking out.”\n\nMaria Ortiz, who owns a shop selling party supplies, said there are days when nobody walks into her store.\n\nFor one family, the aftershocks of the fall raids have lingered for weeks. Kamila, 15, said she has been afraid to leave her apartment other than to go to school after her cousin was detained by immigration agents in November while on his way to a job as a rug installer. He had been living in the U.S. for 18 years without legal status.\n\n“I’m scared. We can’t step outside because they might be waiting for us,\" she said.\n\nAsked for ⁠comment, Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, said: “There’s no reason to be afraid of law enforcement, unless you are breaking ​the law.\"\n\nThe cousin’s small apartment sits mostly as he left it - the bed unmade and his fluffy cream-colored dog, Peluchin, scampering through the apartment. Every day ​since his owner was detained, Peluchin pushes the dusty window blinds aside with his small snout to stare for hours at the street, waiting for him to return, a neighbor who comes by to walk him said.\n\n“All his dreams, all his effort, all his work – it’s here, empty,” said Sofia, Kamila’s mother and a 47-year-old housekeeper.\n\n“My daughter is 15 years old, she shouldn’t be living like this,” said Sofia, who came ‍to the U.S. from Mexico without legal status and is considering ⁠self-deporting. “There’s not a life here.”\n\nOn a recent afternoon, the Little Village Community Council hummed with overlapping voices as people coordinated school pick-ups, shared videos, and called family members of people who were detained.\n\nThe LVCC president, Baltazar Enriquez, has led local resistance to immigration enforcement, organizing patrols for federal agents and distributing plastic whistles now used across the city to warn of immigration agents in the area.\n\nThe tight-knit nature of “La Villita,” the Spanish name for Little Village, has given residents an ⁠organizing edge as they take to WhatsApp, Facebook and Signal groups to coordinate. Though Little Village has long struggled with bouts of gun violence and has the highest number of gang-related crimes in the city, residents said they felt safe before federal agents came to town.\n\nOther forms of resistance have been quieter – like Vicky Martinez, ‌a 55-year-old resident, who drops off groceries for friends and neighbors who are too scared to go to the store.\n\n\"It just feels like you're in prison. We don't even know what they're gonna throw at us,” ‌Martinez said.",

In late October, it suspended supplies of wafers to the Chinese unit, while a Dutch court ordered Wingtech's founder be removed as Nexperia CEO.\n\nBeijing responded by halting exports of Nexperia's finished products, triggering chip shortages for global automakers.\n\nBoth governments relaxed their measures last month, but court fights and an internal battle continue over control ⁠of Nexperia, with China and Wingtech both warning ‌that disruptions could resume without a long-term resolution.\n\nIn a letter sent to its distributors earlier this month and seen by Reuters, Nexperia's China unit said it had locked in wafer production capacity for IGBT products with ‍local suppliers for 2026 and was accelerating verification of wafers from Wingtech's foundry Wingsky Semi to ensure \"abundant supply.\"\n\nThe previously unreported move marks a further supply-chain separation between Nexperia China and its Dutch parent that could lead to a complete split.\n\nNexperia told Reuters that it was not in communication with its Chinese ​subsidiary and the unit showed \"no intention to negotiate a short-term solution to restore the flow of chips to customers.\"\n\nThe company said that ‌IGBT products accounted for about 0.1% of Nexperia total revenue in 2024.\n\nNexperia China did not immediately reply to a request for comment.\n\nBeijing last week called on the Dutch government to implement the consensus they reached on encouraging negotiations between Nexperia and Wingtech and to urge the chipmaker to send representatives to China as soon as possible for talks.\n\nNexperia China has told local distributors wafer inventory at its factory in Dongguan in southern China's Guangdong province is low as supply from the Netherlands is not expected to resume soon, a ⁠person familiar with the matter said.",

    "fullText": "STATESVILLE, N.C. (AP) — A business jet crashed Thursday while trying to return to a North Carolina airport shortly after takeoff, killing all seven people aboard, including retired NASCAR driver Greg Biffle and his family, authorities said.\n\nThe Cessna C550 erupted into a large fire when it hit the ground. It had departed Statesville Regional Airport, about 45 miles (72 kilometers) north of Charlotte, but soon crashed while trying to return and land, the North Carolina State Highway Patrol said.\n\nFlight records show the plane was registered to a company run by Biffle. The cause of the crash wasn't immediately known, nor was the reason for the plane's return to the airport in drizzle and cloudy conditions.\n\nFederal Aviation Administration records show Biffle was rated to fly helicopters and single and multi-engine planes. It wasn't clear if Biffle was piloting the plane at the time of the crash.\n\nBiffle was on the plane with his wife, Cristina, and children Ryder, 5, and Emma, 14, according to the highway patrol and a family statement. Others on the plane were identified as Dennis Dutton, his son Jack, and Craig Wadsworth.\n\n“Each of them meant everything to us, and their absence leaves an immeasurable void in our lives,” the joint family statement said.\n\nBiffle, 55, won more than 50 races across NASCAR’s three circuits, including 19 at the Cup Series level. He also won the Trucks Series championship in 2000 and the Xfinity Series title in 2002.\n\nNASCAR said it was devastated by the news.\n\n“Greg was more than a champion driver; he was a beloved member of the NASCAR community, a fierce competitor, and a friend to so many,” NASCAR said. “His passion for racing, his integrity, and his commitment to fans and fellow competitors alike made a lasting impact on the sport.”\n\nThe plane, bound for Florida, took off from the Statesville airport shortly after 10 a.m., according to tracking data posted by FlightAware.com.\n\nGolfers playing next to the airport were shocked as they witnessed the disaster, even dropping to the ground at the Lakewood Golf Club while the plane was overhead. The ninth hole was covered with debris.\n\n“We were like, ‘Oh my gosh! That’s way too low,’” said Joshua Green of Mooresville. “It was scary.”\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board and the Federal Aviation Administration were investigating.\n\nThe Cessna plane, built in 1981, is a popular mid-sized business jet with an excellent reputation, aviation safety expert Jeff Guzzetti said. It has two engines and typically seats six to eight passengers and two pilots.\n\nIn 2024, Biffle was honored for his humanitarian efforts after Hurricane Helene struck the U.S., even using his personal helicopter to deliver aid to flooded, remote western North Carolina.\n\n“The last time I spoke with Cristina, just a couple of weeks ago, she reached out to ask how she could help with relief efforts in Jamaica. That’s who the Biffles were,\" U.S. Rep. Richard Hudson, a Republican from North Carolina, said.\n\nWadsworth was Biffle's friend and helped him with odd jobs, including delivering supplies to places hit by Hurricane Helene, roommate Benito Howell said.\n\n“He didn’t know how to say no,” Howell said of Wadsworth, who had worked for several NASCAR teams. “He loved everybody. He always tried to help everybody.”\n\nThe joint family statement also spoke about Dutton and his son Jack, saying they were \"deeply loved as well, and their loss is felt by all who knew them.\"\n\nWith 2025 almost over, there have been 1,331 U.S. crashes this year investigated by the NTSB, from two-seat planes to commercial aircraft, compared to a total of 1,482 in 2024.\n\nMajor air disasters around the world in 2025 include the plane-helicopter collision that killed 67 in Washington, the Air India crash that killed 260 in India, and a crash in Russia’s Far East that claimed 48 lives. Fourteen people, including 11 on the ground, died in a UPS cargo plane crash in Kentucky.\n\nRobertson reported from Raleigh, North Carolina. Associated Press writers John Seewer in Toledo, Ohio; Jenna Fryer in Charlotte, North Carolina; Josh Funk in Omaha, Nebraska; Ed White in Detroit; and Sarah Brumfield in Washington contributed to this story.",

    "fullText": "Deal will allow app to continue operating in US as Elizabeth Warren condemns Trump and his ‘billionaire buddies’\n\nTikTok has signed a deal to sell its US business to three American investors – Oracle, Silver Lake and MGX – ensuring the popular social video platform can continue operating in the United States.\n\nThe deal is expected to close on 22 January, according to an internal memo seen by he Associated Press and Reuters. The TikTok chief executive officer, Shou Zi Chew, said in the memo that ByteDance and TikTok have signed binding agreements with the three investors.\n\nThe new TikTok US joint venture will be 50% held by a consortium of new investors, including Oracle, Silver Lake and Abu Dhabi-based MGX with 15% each. Another 30.1% will be held by affiliates of existing ByteDance investors and 19.9% will be retained by ByteDance, according to the memo.\n\nWhite House officials have said Oracle, which was co-founded by Donald Trump’s supporter Larry Ellison, will license a copy of TikTok’s recommendation algorithm as part of the deal, in a partnership that will expand on Oracle’s existing management of TikTok’s trove of data collected about its US users.\n\nEllison’s role in the new ownership of the most popular social media platform in the US has raised concerns about the decreasing share of media firms not under the control of pro-Trump billionaires, with Ellison’s son David now driving wholesale changes at CBS, Elon Musk in control of X, formerly known as Twitter, Mark Zuckerberg overseeing both Instagram and Facebook, and Jeff Bezos owning the Washington Post.\n\n“First Paramount/CBS and now TikTok,” Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic senator from Massachusetts, wrote on Bluesky in response to the news. “Trump wants to hand over even more control of what you watch to his billionaire buddies. Americans deserve to know if the president struck another backdoor deal for this billionaire takeover of TikTok.”\n\nRush Doshi, who coordinated US government policy on China and Taiwan as a Biden National Security Council official, noted that there were “still some questions about who controls the algorithm. They say it will be trained on US data. Great, but has the algorithm been transferred, licensed, or is it still owned and controlled by Beijing – with Oracle merely providing ‘monitoring?’”\n\nThe agreement comes after a long delay. Trump said in September that he had spoken with China’s president over the phone about the deal and he had “a very good talk with president Xi” and “he gave us the go ahead”.\n\nIn October, the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, announced that the US and China had “reached a final deal on TikTok”.\n\nIn 2020, during his first presidency, Trump had threatened to ban TikTok in retaliation for China’s handling of Covid.\n\nCongress later passed a ban of the app over security concerns that was signed into law in April 2024 by Joe Biden. The ban was set to go into effect on 20 January 2025 but implementation was pushed back multiple times by Trump while his administration worked to develop a deal to transfer ownership.\n\nThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.\n\nIf you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.\n\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\n\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

    "description": "A private jet crashed at a regional North Carolina airport and erupted into flames Thursday, killing seven people, including retired NASCAR star Greg Biffle and three members of his family, officials said.

    "fullText": "A private jet crashed at a regional North Carolina airport and erupted into flames Thursday, killing seven people, including retired NASCAR star Greg Biffle and three members of his family, officials said.\n\nHere are some things to know about the crash.\n\nThe plane took off Thursday morning from Statesville Regional Airport, about 45 miles (72 kilometers) north of Charlotte. Shortly after takeoff, the jet turned back toward the airport and crashed while attempting to land, according to tracking data posted by FlightAware.com.\n\nVideo from WSOC-TV showed first responders rushing onto the runway, where flames burned near scattered wreckage.\n\nInvestigators have said it is too early to determine what caused the crash. There was some drizzle and clouds at the time, according to AccuWeather.\n\nStatesville Regional Airport offers corporate aviation facilities for Fortune 500 companies and several NASCAR teams, according to its website.\n\nAccording to a joint statement released by the victims' families, there were seven people aboard the plane, including Greg Biffle; his wife, Cristina Grossu Biffle; their son, Ryder; and Greg Biffle's daughter, Emma.\n\nThe statement identified the other victims as Craig Wadsworth, Dennis Dutton and Dutton's son, Jack, all “beloved by many in the NASCAR community.”\n\n“Each of them meant everything to us, and their absence leaves an immeasurable void in our lives,” the statement said.\n\nBiffle, 55, won more than 50 races across NASCAR’s three circuits, including 19 at the Cup Series level. He also won championships in both the lower-tier national Truck and Xfinity Series — the first driver to do so — and spent almost his entire career driving for Roush Fenway Racing, headquartered about 40 miles south of the crash site.\n\nWadsworth, a longtime behind-the-scenes employee with several NASCAR teams, was friends with Biffle and had helped him with odd jobs, including delivering supplies to places hit by Hurricane Helene a year ago, according to Wadsworth's roommate, Benito Howell.\n\nBiffle joins a somber roll of athletes who died in plane or helicopter crashes.\n\nThe plane was a Cessna C550, a popular mid-sized business jet with an excellent reputation, aviation safety expert Jeff Guzzetti said. Flight records show the plane was registered to a company run by Greg Biffle.\n\nThe plane was scheduled to fly to Sarasota, Florida, and then to Treasure Cay airport in the Bahamas before returning.\n\nBiffle's plane was built in 1981 and would have likely cost between $1 million and $10 million, depending on how it was outfitted, Guzzetti said. The Cessna 550 Citation has two engines and typically seats six to eight passengers.",

    "fullText": "TikTok reached a deal with a group of investors to form a new joint venture for its US business, according to an internal memo viewed by Business Insider.\n\nThe deal, which TikTok expects to close in January, comes more than a year after Congress passed a law that forced its owner, ByteDance, to divest from its US operations or face a ban, because TikTok was deemed a \"foreign adversary-controlled\" company.\n\nThe new US joint venture will operate independently in areas like US data protection and training its content recommendation algorithm while still connecting to TikTok's global product and business lines like e-commerce and advertising, per the memo from company CEO Shou Chew.\n\nThe announcement is the culmination of a lengthy battle for survival by TikTok, which briefly went dark in the US in January to comply with the divest-or-ban law.\n\nTikTok and ByteDance had sought recourse through the courts, arguing that the law — the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act — violated the First Amendment. In January, the Supreme Court ruled against TikTok and upheld the divest-or-ban law.\n\nSince then, TikTok has been facing a looming deadline to find a US buyer. The app's future remained in limbo for months as the White House repeatedly extended the deadline and administration officials sought to work out a deal.\n\nIn September, President Donald Trump signed an executive order that approved the sale of TikTok's US operation for around $14 billion.\n\nTrump said at the time that Oracle and Larry Ellison would be part of the deal, and Michael Dell and Rupert Murdoch may also be involved. Vice President JD Vance said the buyer group would include \"four or five world-class investors.\"\n\nTikTok did not respond to a request for comment. The White House referred Business Insider to TikTok.",

    "description": "I rode in business class on the Amtrak NextGen Acela train from NYC to Washington, DC, for $180. It was a great experience, but not worth the price.",
    "fullText": "The Amtrak Acela is an express service between Boston and Washington, DC. The train line introduced a new fleet on the route in August 2025, known as NextGen Acela.\n\nIn addition to being the fastest Amtrak train with a top speed of 160 miles per hour, the NextGen Acela has modern interiors and high-tech amenities.\n\nThe Amtrak Acela trains only have two classes — business and first. I booked my business-class ticket for $180.\n\nOut of curiosity, I looked at the pricing for coach seating on the regional Amtrak train, which is 30 minutes slower than the Acela. It was $40.\n\nMy train was scheduled to leave at 10 a.m., but there was a 90-minute delay. Since I was stuck at the station for longer than anticipated, I briefly considered going to the Metropolitan Lounge, an elevated space overlooking the train hall with cozy seating and complimentary refreshments.\n\nFirst-class passengers and those traveling in sleeper accommodations can get into the lounge for free, but other Amtrak riders have to pay $50 to access it.\n\nSince I'd already splurged on the business-class ticket, I decided to skip the lounge and head to the standard waiting room instead, but it was full. I finally settled for a seat on the floor against the wall until it was time to board.\n\nWhen I got in line to board, I was reminded that business class is just a standard ticket on the Amtrak Acela. Unlike business-class rides I've taken that also had coach seating, this trip didn't include the perk of priority boarding.\n\nSoft, cushy, spacious, supportive — these are the words that popped into my head when I settled into my business-class seat. A reclining function and footrest made the ride even more comfortable.\n\nPower outlets, USB ports, and a reading light were all conveniently located on the side of the seat. In front of me was a tray table and a fold-out cupholder.\n\nMost Amtrak trains I've been on have had WiFi, but in my experience, the connection has typically been too weak for much more than a Google search.\n\nI was stoked when the NextGen Acela's 5G WiFi was fast enough to stream YouTube videos without any issues. I passed the time by watching live sessions of my favorite bands.\n\nI've learned to set the bar low for train bathrooms. Stocked toilet paper, soap, and paper towels are not a given. Cleanliness and extra space aren't either. In my experience, some business-class bathrooms are no different from those in coach.\n\nSo I was ecstatic when I stepped inside the lavatory on the NextGen Acela. The automatic door opened into a spotless space that felt big enough for two people to do jumping jacks simultaneously.\n\nI found it aesthetically pleasing too, with bold red accents and trendy touches, from the shelf to the mirror.\n\nI also appreciated the touchless water, soap, and dryer functions on the sink.\n\n\"Amtrak travelers always have their preference,\" an Amtrak representative wrote in an email to Business Insider. \"If they want to experience these premium trains with enhanced amenities, they can. Or, if they prefer convenient and affordable downtown-to-downtown service up and down the Northeast Corridor, Northeast Regional trains offer a comfortable and enjoyable way to travel throughout the Northeast Corridor and points beyond.\"\n\nThe next time I take an Amtrak train, I'll miss the cozy seat, elevated bathroom, high-speed WiFi, and shorter travel time. Still, these perks weren't enough for me to consider Acela's business class to be worth more than quadruple the price of a coach ticket.",

    "fullText": "Palmer Luckey wants you to know he was right all along.\n\nThe outspoken billionaire and new-age god of war is making a fortune selling weapons. His reach extends beyond the range of his powerful artillery though, as he has shifted the narrative around what working in defense tech means.\n\nOnce a somewhat taboo corner of the business world, the success of Luckey's Anduril Industries, along with his no-holds-barred approach to … just about everything, has made him the poster child for tech's new love affair with the military, writes BI's Julia Hornstein.\n\nLuckey's now on a victory lap of sorts as he shepherds the US into a new era where one of the biggest business battlefields is the literal battlefield.\n\nPart of Luckey's appeal in tech circles might be his authenticity.\n\nWhether you love him or hate him, the 33-year-old has stuck to his guns over the years. That's unlike most of his tech peers, who have shifted their businesses and policies to favor whichever political party is in power. (Luckey once said he wrote President Donald Trump a letter when he was 15, encouraging him to run for president.)\n\nAt times, that dedication has come at a cost. Luckey has long claimed he was fired from Meta in 2017 for supporting Trump. Meta denies he left over politics.\n\nBut these days it's all sunshine and rainbows cruise missiles and drones for Luckey.\n\nPalmer Luckey might be the face of defense tech, but he's got plenty of competition.\n\nFirst and foremost, there's more money than ever in the space thanks to the Trump administration leaning into defense spending.\n\nThe latest era of modern warfare is also creating new opportunities. The increased prominence of drones, as evident in the war in Ukraine, has given startups a chance to step up to the plate. It has created an interesting dynamic, with young, agile startups competing with traditional defense contractors.\n\nThe increased competition is largely viewed as a positive for the government, which can benefit from better pricing. The new players and cutting-edge tech are also speeding up processes.\n\nThe Navy said a Palantir-powered AI system for shipbuilding cut a 160-hour job to just 10 minutes. The Army is also enacting a \"fail fast\" approach to weapon development.\n\nMoving at such speed, a staple of Silicon Valley, comes with risks when dealing with such powerful and dangerous tech. A new watchdog report said the US military needs to improve its weapons testing processes.",

    "title": "Starbucks is doubling down on its free bachelor's degree program as enrollment surges 60%",
    "description": "Starbucks' Chief People Officer Sara Kelly spoke to Business Insider about the company's increasingly popular free college program.",
    "fullText": "Starbucks receives more than a million job applications a year, the company's Chief People Officer says one reason is a quietly powerful lure: the promise of a fully-funded bachelor's degree from Arizona State University.\n\nFor Brea Yancey, a barista in Washington state who has worked at the company for eight years, that benefit hasn't just reshaped her future — it reshaped her family's. She enrolled, then inspired her mother, a Starbucks store manager, to join her, turning a workplace perk into a two-generation push toward a goal neither woman thought was financially in reach.\n\n\"I didn't think college was going to be an option because of how much it costs with loans and things like that,\" Yancey, who celebrated her graduation on Monday, told Business Insider. \"I know it's going to make all the difference in the world not having to worry about that.\"\n\nYancey pursued a degree in interdisciplinary arts and performance, with the goal of becoming a music teacher. Her mother graduated last semester with a degree in interdisciplinary studies, concentrating in sales, marketing, and project management.\n\n\"I'm glad that she got to finish school, because that's all she ever wanted, and she stopped originally because she got pregnant with me, but now we finished it together,\" Yancey said.\n\nAs college costs have soared, so has enrollment in Starbucks' College Achievement Plan (SCAP) program, Chief People Officer Sara Kelly told Business Insider. The program, which began in 2014, offers eligible employees 100% upfront tuition coverage for their first bachelor's degree, facilitated through online classes at ASU.\n\n\"Over the last five years, we've seen a 60% increase in participation,\" Kelly said. \"We have 13% of our partners participating as scholars today.\"\n\nThat represents at least one enrolled Starbucks staff member at about 90% of its coffeehouses, Kelly added.\n\nStarbucks isn't the only retail or Fortune 500 employer offering education benefits. Amazon, Walmart, and Chipotle also offer similar programs. However, compared to most programs in the US retail sector, Starbucks doesn't require reimbursement of tuition payments or require students to stay with the company for a certain amount of time after graduation.\n\nYounger students are increasingly questioning the value of a college degree. A May 2024 Deloitte survey found that a third of Gen Z and millennials chose to skip higher education due to rising costs, and the average price of attendance for a student living on campus at an in-state public 4-year institution is $108,584 over 4 years, according to Educationdata — so you can't beat free.\n\n\"This started over 10 years ago, all in service of creating access to education, and the importance of creating access to education,\" Kelly said. \"College is incredibly costly, and so how do we create access to that education for all of our partners? So we're really proud, because we see this as one of the most powerful expressions of our investment in our partners.\"\n\nStarbucks has expanded the SCAP program in recent years, offering access to more than 150 degree pathways, providing enrolled students with a broader range of fields to pursue than in the program's early years. They've also added a \"Pathway to Admission\" support route for partners who don't initially qualify for university admission, allowing them to take preparatory courses and earn their way into ASU. Additionally, a \"plus-one\" benefit is available for eligible military and veteran partners, extending SCAP to a qualifying family member.\n\nThis year, Starbucks introduced new study abroad and coffee education opportunities, offering a hands-on sustainability immersion at Hacienda Alsacia in Costa Rica, where scholars study climate, agronomy, and the future of coffee at their global research and development farm.\n\nOf course, the students aren't the only ones benefiting. The program is a significant retention win for Starbucks. Turnover is at record lows, Kelly said, and baristas who have spoken to Business Insider frequently cite the SCAP program as a reason they've stayed with the company.\n\nThe program also helps to strengthen Starbucks' talent pipeline, as the company has committed to a 90% internal hire rate or fill rate for its retail leadership roles.\n\n\"Our Starbucks college achievement plan partners are part of our pipeline for those management roles, and we're very excited about that,\" Kelly said. \"But do they have to stay with Starbucks? No.\"\n\nStarbucks has never considered adding a retention requirement to the program, Kelly said, because the company wants \"to offer access to education that people can take with them on their journey, no matter where it takes them.\"\n\nFor Yancey, her Starbucks journey is winding down, but it's not over. She continues to work part-time as a barista and has a second job as a music instructor, while planning her next career moves.\n\n\"They find a way to make it work for whoever wants to go into the university through the SCAP program; they find a way for you to complete it,\" Yancey said. \"I don't think finances or learning ability should hold anybody back, and they really delivered on that.\"",

And so it was just nice seeing our kids get flowing again last—there tonight,” said Burton.\n\nBountiful used balanced scoring to secure the win, with Ute signee Milika Satuala leading the way with 15 points, followed by Maleah Nelson with a dozen, Maile Murdock with 11 and Brynna Castleton with 10.\n\n“I’ll take that every game if I can get it. We’ve got some young kids that are definitely growing up and starting to take a little bit of the pressure off of that starting five, thank goodness. So it’s nice to see Miley and Peyton (Orchard) really starting to fill that role, and among many others that are starting to just get confident playing at the varsity level,” said Burton.\n\n“We knew that was going to be the issue coming into the year was finding that group behind the first —behind our starting five, and we’re starting to figure that out.\"\n\nMuch of Bountiful’s damage was done in the first half, as it opened up a 16-7 lead after the first quarter and then stretched it to 21-7 at the 5:54 mark of the second quarter on a corner 3-pointer from the freshman Murdock, her third of the game.\n\nWasatch finally halted the Redhawks’ fast start to cut the lead to 10 by halftime.\n\nWasatch’s press caused some turnover issues late in the game for Bountiful, which saw its lead whittle to seven points in the final minute, but the Wasps ran out of time to cut into the lead another further as it fell to 10-2 on the season.\n\nThe win pushes three-time defending state champion Bountiful’s record to 8-1 on the season.",

    "fullText": "Many electric vehicle drivers have experienced disturbing incidents at charging stations when others maliciously unplug the cables or even cut the cords. Surveillance footage and personal confrontations often reveal that vandals disrupt EV charging out of spite or hatred towards people who own and drive clean-energy vehicles.\n\nHowever, even business owners and store managers sometimes unplug EVs on their property, much to the dismay of drivers who rely on public charging stations.\n\nIn a Reddit post to r/TeslaModelY, one driver shared details about a frustrating encounter while charging at a local grocery store.\n\nThe OP explained they began charging their EV at a grocery store and went into the store's Starbucks to work while it was charging. The store manager told the OP that he unplugged the car because those stations are only for customers.\n\nHowever, the OP was actually a customer who bought a drink and was working inside the store's coffee shop. The encounter made the OP feel \"extremely uncomfortable,\" so they packed up their belongings and left.\n\n\"I'm bummed as this used to be the grocery store I would get my groceries at, and it was always nice to be able to charge my car while shopping, but I don't want to ever go back there knowing that the store manager is a creep who follows customers on their cameras and will, without hesitation, unplug their cars while charging,\" the OP shared.\n\nThis situation is unfortunate because it prevented an EV driver from charging their EV. It also created anxiety for the OP by eliminating a reliable charging source while out running errands.\n\nUnfortunately, EV driver harassment is a widespread problem worldwide. Not only do unplugging vehicles and other threatening behaviors create unnecessary tension between EV and non-EV owners, but they also slow the broader adoption of clean-energy driving.\n\nThose who have yet to learn about the impressive technological advancements and benefits of EVs may rely on outdated information or anti-EV propaganda to justify their actions.\n\nIt's true that EV production does use some natural resources and generates some pollution. However, EVs are still far cleaner and more sustainable than gas-powered vehicles, which release tailpipe fumes wherever they go.\n\nHow long would you be willing to wait for an EV to charge?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nWhen you embrace highly efficient electric vehicle driving, you help sustain breathable air and contribute less to overheating the planet. You can also save significantly on vehicle ownership costs by avoiding the need to buy gas and the routine maintenance costs of traditional cars.\n\nIn response to the OP's post, Reddit users offered their advice about how to handle the situation.\n\n\"You should definitely use one of those charging locks next time you go,\" one Redditor recommended.\n\n\"I would complain to corporate or his boss,\" someone else suggested.\n\n\"Report them for tampering with a customer's car,\" another Redditor wrote.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "As SpaceX (SPAX.PVT) eyes going public via an IPO in 2026, what would such a move mean for the space economy, which for the longest time has been dominated by private companies?\n\nSpace Capital founder and CEO Chad Anderson comes on Market Catalysts to elaborate on the spark this could give the space industry and how it could influence more private operators to go public.\n\nAnderson is also the author of The Space Economy: Capitalize on the Greatest Business Opportunity of Our Lifetime.\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Catalysts.\n\nFor more on what a potential SpaceX IPO means for other space companies looking to go public, as well as just a general landscape for next year, I'm joined here on set by Chad Anderson, Space Capital founder and CEO. He's also the author of The Space Economy. Good to see you.\n\nSo, I'm so curious about SpaceX and kind of like whether it sucks the air out of the room for other types of space investment or creates more of a halo effect for space investment.\n\nI think it's definitely the ladder. Um this is really exciting news. It's still uncertain, but we'll see what happens. But if they do, I mean, this is, I think this is going to um uh set a new benchmark. It's going to reprice um a lot of assets throughout the category. I think it's going to show what can be done. And I think it's going to kick off a wave of new listings. So this could be really exciting. And then from our perspective as private market investors in early companies, uh we're really excited to see what happens when these founders get some liquidity, who own stock options and shares, and they go on now and they're freed from the shackles of working at um big companies, they can go and, you know, um think about what they want to do, start their own thing. So we expect that this is going to um uh increase the SpaceX mafia. I mean, a few years ago it was, you know, we were tracking 45 companies or something like that of SpaceX alumni that had gone on and done founded new companies. It's now up to, I don't know, closer to 200, and we'll see what happens with with this um uh liquidity event. But for us, I mean, this is um uh SpaceX is the Apex player. They're 10 years ahead of anybody else. They've been setting the benchmark all along. Uh now this sort of moment, um we'll see what happens, but it could really catalyze a lot of activity.\n\nI mean, on the flip side, if they are so far ahead of everyone else, and then their numbers are public, does that then um mean that some of the other players, particularly in the public markets who also their numbers are public, like that that they're disadvantaged if they're not in the same place as SpaceX is.\n\nHmm, well, that's um that's a really interesting point. So I think SpaceX has stayed private for so long and they've been so in demand. Um, uh this is the hottest stock in the private markets. Everyone is vying to get access to SpaceX. Um and I think it's really sort of difficult, um when you've got that much interest and that many investors, um to sort of keep things quiet. So, you know, you see throughout the the the news that there's a lot of information that's out there\n\non what their performance looks like, right? So um it's no um so that sort of cat's out of the bag already.\n\nSo it wouldn't necessarily change the dynamic.\n\nYeah, I think so. And so you see like um what are the numbers, you know, um uh 13 last year, 15 this year. You start to think like the the growth is not parabolic um in uh uh their their growth is not parabolic. They but they are cash flow positive and they've been buying back shares, right? So I think what um this would do is really give them sort of uh a large cash infusion to go after some of their long-term missions to get to Mars, to um uh build data centers in orbit, uh to fund that and really have a big cash infusion to basically speed things up and go faster.\n\nUm and one of those is also what Starship is one of the projects that they're working on. Um so how important is that and what what's the timeline for something like that?\n\nSuper important. So Starship is a next generation massive vehicle. Um we've never had anything of this size. So if 2025 was the year of launch frequency, we were basically, we started launching, we launched almost every day, one launch per day, right? And that launch cadence is increasing. 2026 is going to be about mass. Um Starship is a massive vehicle. It is going to be fully reusable, which means that both the first stage of the rocket and the second stage both can land and be refueled and stacked and launched again. More like operational commercial airlines, which is really exciting because that is going to um it promises to deliver another step change in the order of magnitude, further reduction in launch cost, which really um will do a lot to again, to the halo effect, you know, comment to really stimulate growth in in this category. Um but at the same time, that vehicle is is necessary to launch these next generation Starlink satellites, the V3 satellites that they already um that they have already designed and they're just waiting for a vehicle that can carry them. Their data centers in orbit that they're now talking about in conjunction with this um potential IPO, uh requires Starship to be able to launch these things, right? So, this um is uh a lynchpin. It's it's critical to their strategy and it's also um critical um to to take the space economy to the next level.\n\nUm another thing that you're watching closely going into next year is what? geo intelligence and defense. Those are kind of some themes within space. So what should we be watching for there?\n\nYeah, I kind of just thinking about the convergence of AI and space in totality, right? So we talked a little bit about orbital data centers. Everyone seems to be talking about that now. Um Starship is and and Blue Origin's next generation vehicles too are going to allow us to launch new infrastructure that, you know, we couldn't do before like orbital data centers and some other things. So that's really interesting on the AI front. And also, um with regards to, you know, geospatial intelligence. So, um if GPS is the dot on the map, geospatial intelligence is the map. This is um uh digital information layered on top of the physical world. A lot of that comes from the global intelligence comes from satellites, um and different sensor types that are feeding into this really robust rich data set about what's going on on the surface of our planet. That's too much data for humans to comb through. So, um uh AI has come along at just the right time to basically help us parse through that and make sense of that, drive useful insights from that. And this is a huge area of growth. We're seeing um what what we call world models. So, everyone's familiar with LLMs and what's going on there, but those aren't really good at helping us to understand and navigate the physical world. So there's a lot of work going on right now um in geospatial embeddings, basically embedding the data to have the right geospatial information, coordinates, positioning data, rich layers of of data to basically help you now use AI to make sense of the physical world, right? Not just language. So, this is a huge area of opportunity. Um a lot of demand is being driven by defense and intelligence communities, but then also there's massive consumer and enterprise applications as well.\n\nVery cool. All right, Chad, we got to leave it there. Thank you so much. Appreciate it.",

    "description": "\"The lead negotiator for Amazon called me on Thursday,\" Fermi CEO Toby Neugebauer told Business Insider. The deal would pay more than $20 billion over the next 20 years, he said.",
    "fullText": "Amazon is the prospective tenant that withdrew funding from Fermi America's massive data-center project, sending the developer's stock plummeting earlier this month, Business Insider has learned.\n\nIn September, Fermi, which is developing an 11-gigawatt data-center campus in the Texas Panhandle, said it had agreed to a nonbinding letter of intent with an investment-grade tenant to anchor the project. The tenant would take the first gigawatt of power across 12 facilities.\n\nOn Friday, December 12, Fermi's stock plunged by nearly half after a securities filing said an unnamed prospective partner had canceled a $150 million advance to begin construction, known as an Advance in Aid of Construction Agreement, or AICA. The cancellation followed the end of an exclusivity period.\n\nAmazon is that tenant, Toby Neugebauer, Fermi's billionaire CEO, confirmed in a December 15 phone call with Business Insider, discussing the talks that led to the cancellation. The tech giant has been negotiating the deal, which would pay more than $20 billion over the next 20 years, Neugebauer said.\n\n\"The lead negotiator for Amazon called me on Thursday,\" Neugebauer said.\n\nNeugebauer said the talks between Fermi and the tenant remain constructive, and that the ending of the AICA didn't indicate any breakdown in conversation.\n\n\"It's just a normal negotiation,\" he said. \"Their issue was spending money after the exclusive period had ended.\"\n\nNeugebauer said he wasn't worried about the talks taking too long. \"It's a big deal,\" he said. \"Big deals take longer.\"\n\nLisa Levandowski, a spokesperson for Amazon, declined to comment.\n\nFermi America's Panhandle project ranks among the most ambitious attempts yet to meet the surging energy demands of the data centers fueling the AI boom. The company intends to bring 11 gigawatts of new power online over the next decade-plus with a mix of power from the grid, natural gas, and nuclear sources.\n\nThe company went public in September, pricing its shares at $21 to raise more than $680 million.\n\nDubbed Project Matador, the development relies on a 99-year ground lease with the Texas Tech University System. That agreement is dependent on a signed letter of intent between Fermi America and a tenant.\n\nThe December 12 filing said that none of the $150 million construction advance had been used and that the negotiations were ongoing. The letter of intent remains in force.\n\nAnalysts at Cantor Fitzgerald said in a note published December 12 that they had spoken to Fermi America's management and learned that, per the company, the anchor tenant \"tried to make last-minute changes to the agreement pricing that were unacceptable to\" Fermi.\n\nAmazon is the second company to be linked to the project. In October, Neugebauer told the Amarillo City Council that Palantir, the software company known for its police and government contracts, had taken an interest in the site.\n\n\"I just finished with Palantir, which is our nation's tip of the spear in the AI war,\" Neugebauer said during the October 28 meeting. \"They'll be here Thursday.\"\n\nThe Cantor Fitzgerald analysts said in their note that management indicated that they were \"active\" with two additional tenants, and in dialogue with another four.\n\nFermi America was founded less than a year ago by Neugebauer, former Energy Secretary Rick Perry, and Perry's son Griffin. The IPO valued the company at nearly $14 billion.\n\nA recent slump in the company's shares has brought its valuation to below $6 billion.\n\nHave a tip?

    "title": "Strategic CISO: Timing Your Security Assessment for Executive Impact",
    "description": "Whether you’re presenting to your board, executive leadership team, or quarterly business review, transform your penetration testing from a compliance checkbox to your strategic advantage.",
    "fullText": "Welcome to the second installment of our Strategic CISO Series—a collection of guides focused on turning operational security work into strategic wins. Read Part 0 Before the Test — When Your Startup is Really Ready for Penetration Testing.\n\nWhile most security leaders schedule assessments around audit deadlines, the timing of your security testing creates opportunities to demonstrate proactive leadership, present measurable improvements, and position security as a business enabler rather than a cost center.\n\nYour executive leadership review is eight weeks away, scheduled for 15 minutes between the CFO’s budget presentation and lunch. You know you need to talk about security, but leading with “we’re compliant” sounds like you’re just checking boxes, and you definitely can’t lead with “here are all our vulnerabilities.”\n\nThis is a tightrope every security leader walks. You need to discuss security in a way that demonstrates both vigilance and value, without creating panic or appearing reactive.\n\nThe timing of your penetration test is just as strategic as the test itself.\n\nA well-timed pen test validates your security posture, creates a narrative of proactive leadership, provides concrete metrics to present, and positions you as strategic rather than operational.\n\nA poorly timed test leaves you scrambling to explain findings without a remediation story, or, worse, presenting stale data that makes the board question what you’re doing with your time.\n\nEvery penetration test delivers technical findings. Strategic penetration tests deliver business outcomes.\n\nThe difference isn’t in the testing methodology or even expertise - it’s in when you test and what you do with the results. Testing six weeks before a board meeting gives you time to remediate findings and walk into that meeting with a complete narrative of proactive security leadership. Testing two weeks before forces you to either hide findings or present problems without solutions.\n\nStrategic timing enables you to:\n\nSecurity leaders who master timing use their penetration tests to manufacture strategic wins. Those who don’t find themselves constantly explaining why they’re behind.\n\nStrategic play: Commission a penetration test that completes 6-8 weeks before your key stakeholder presentation—whether that’s your board, executive leadership team, quarterly business review, or audit committee—giving you time to remediate critical findings and present a complete narrative of proactive security management.\n\nWhat you can say to stakeholders:\n\n“We proactively commissioned an independent security assessment to validate our security posture”\n\n“We identified and remediated X vulnerabilities before they could be exploited”\n\n“Our security controls are performing as designed, with only minor findings that have been addressed”\n\nWhy the timing works: You’re controlling the narrative. You found the problems. You fixed the problems. You’re demonstrating maturity and proactive risk management. The leadership team sees leadership, not firefighting.\n\nCritical consideration: This only works if your vendor can deliver a report quickly and your team has the bandwidth to remediate. If the report sits for three weeks before anyone looks at it, you’re losing your window.\n\nWhen evaluating vendors, ask: “What’s your turnaround time from test completion to report delivery?” Anything over 5-7 business days will compress your remediation timeline.\n\nWhat you need from your vendor to make this work\n\nSecurity Assessment Results - Q4 2024\n\nAll critical and high-severity findings identified in our independent security assessment have been remediated and retested. This validates that our security investments are working as designed.\n\nThis demonstrates proactive risk management. This is strategic security leadership.\n\nThe strategic play: When a major breach hits your industry or a critical vulnerability affects your tech stack, commission a targeted assessment.\n\nBusiness context: Your leadership team just read about a competitor getting breached, or a major CVE dropped that affects the technology you use. They’re wondering: “Are we vulnerable to this?” Strategic security leaders answer that question before it’s asked.\n\nTriaging whether these things affect your business is a larger conversation. A key consideration for urgency is whether the vulnerability is currently being exploited with publicly released tools, whether you understand your control maturity and attack surface, and the impacts of a compromised affected system. Undergoing security analyses, control audits, purple team partnerships, penetration tests, or red team engagements can help illuminate this uncertainty.\n\nWhat you can present to the executives:\n\nWhy this timing works: Speed and specificity. You’re not waiting for the leadership team to ask the question—you’re answering it before they think of it. This is the difference between reactive and responsive. Reactive is “oh yeah, we should probably check on that.” Responsive is “I’ve already validated our posture and here’s what we found.”\n\nReal-world example: When Log4Shell dropped in December 2021, the CISOs who immediately commissioned targeted pen tests focused on Log4j exploitation were able to report with confidence: “We identified 3 instances, patched them within 48 hours, and validated through penetration testing that we’re no longer vulnerable. No publicly accessible services are vulnerable”\n\nSecurity leaders who didn’t test were left saying “we think we patched everything”—which is not what leadership wants to hear in crisis moments.\n\nWhat you need from your vendor to make this work:\n\nIndustry response timing requires a partner who can mobilize quickly (again, days, not weeks), brings specialized expertise in emergent threats, and provides real-time communication during testing. If they find something critical, you need to know immediately.\n\nSlide that demonstrates responsive leadership\n\nDemonstrate security operations excellence aligned with business velocity.\n\nThe play: Schedule your pen test 90-120 days before your compliance audit (SOC 2, ISO 27001, PCI, HIPAA, etc.), giving you time to remediate findings before auditors arrive.\n\nThe strategic advantage: Many companies schedule penetration tests to coincide with audit requirements, meaning the auditor sees findings around the same time you do. Strategic security leaders validate controls before audits, transforming potential stressors into demonstrations of security maturity.\n\nWhat you can say to your stakeholders (and auditors):\n\nWhy this timing works: Auditors love controls that are already validated. If your pen test is complete, findings are remediated, and you walk into the audit with clean documentation, you’ve just turned a potential stressor into a demonstration of maturity. Plus, if the pen test does find something gnarly, you have time to fix it before the auditor asks about it.\n\nThe awkward scenario this avoids: Your SOC 2 audit is scheduled for October. You commission your pen test in September “to have fresh results for the audit.” The pen test finds a critical SQL injection vulnerability. Now you’re in remediation mode during the audit, explaining to both the auditor and your board why this exists. Even if you fix it quickly, it’s going in the audit report as “finding identified during audit period.”\n\nCompare that to strategic timing: Penetration test in July. Finding discovered and remediated in August. Retested clean in September. Auditor arrives in October and you present a complete package: “Here’s our penetration test from Q3, here’s the remediation, here’s the retest validation.” Clean audit. Confident leadership team.\n\nAsk your vendor to include retesting so you can show “finding closed” before the audit.\n\nThe slide that demonstrates readiness\n\nStrategic planning, not last-minute scrambling.\n\nThe strategic play: Test new products, major features, or infrastructure changes before they go live and before they attract attacker attention.\n\nBusiness context: You’re launching a new product, exposing a new API, or making significant architectural changes. Your engineering team is focused on features and performance. Strategic security leaders integrate testing into the launch process rather than treating security as a launch-day concern.\n\nWhat you can say to the leadership team:\n\nWhy this works: “Shift left” is the mantra, but most companies still treat security as a launch-day or post-launch concern. If you can demonstrate that security testing happened before launch, you’re showing mature DevSecOps practices.\n\nThe strategic value: This also creates internal credibility with your engineering team. If you find issues pre-launch and help them fix it before customers are affected, you’re a partner. If you’re constantly pointing out problems in production, you’re a blocker. The perception shapes your ability to influence future projects.\n\nWhat you need from your vendor to make this work:\n\nStrategic security leaders track penetration test results year-over-year and present trends that prove security program effectiveness.\n\nIf you’re testing annually (and you should be), the compelling story isn’t “we had fewer findings this year.” It’s “here’s how our security posture has measurably improved.”\n\nSlide demonstrating strategic security leadership‍\n\nThat is strategic. That’s budget justification. This proves your security program delivers measurable business value.\n\nWhat you need from your vendor to make this work:\n\nChoose the timing window that best serves your strategic goals:\n\nChoose Window 1 (Pre-Executive Showcase) if:\n\nChoose Window 2 (Industry Response) if:\n\nChoose Window 3 (Compliance Preemptive Strike) if:\n\nChoose Window 4 (Product Security Story) if:\n\nMost strategic approach: Combine windows 3 and 4 on a predictable cadence, and use windows 1 and 2 opportunistically.\n\nThis gives you a drumbeat of security validation, predictable testing cadence, and strategic moments to showcase your program’s effectiveness.\n\nUnderstanding common timing mistakes helps you plan more effectively:\n\nInsufficient remediation window: You commission a pen test two weeks before your executive meeting. When the report comes back with critical findings, you have no time to remediate. You walk into the leadership meeting and either:\n\nTesting during product launches: You test right before a major product launch. Pen test finds a critical issue. Now you’re choosing between:\n\nTesting during audits: You test during your audit. Findings emerge mid-audit. Auditor documents them as “control failures identified during assessment.” Even if you fix them immediately, they’re in the audit report, creating customer concerns and remediation requirements.\n\nInconsistent testing methodologies: Changing the testing scope drastically or switching vendors every six months makes trend analysis difficult, since you can’t demonstrate improvement when the methodology changes. Strategic planning maintains consistent testing approaches that enable year-over-year comparison.\n\nAll of these are avoidable with better timing.\n\nStrategic timing only works when your security testing partner understands both technical depth and business context. Key capabilities that enable strategic timing:\n\n1. Fast report turnaround: Reports delivered within 5-7 business days, so you control your timeline and have adequate remediation windows. Ask: “From test completion to report delivery, what’s your timeline?”\n\n2. Built-in retesting: Validate remediation before presentations. Retest hours should be included in every engagement, not sold separately or requiring additional procurement cycles.\n\n3. Collaborative approach: Testing partners who work alongside your team during remediation, not vendors who deliver reports and disappear. Some findings need clarification; having testers available accelerates remediation.\n\n4. Real-time critical escalation: If they find something severe, you should know during testing, not in a report weeks later. Ask: “If you find a critical vulnerability, what’s your escalation process?”\n\n5. Flexible scheduling: Strategic windows sometimes have tight timelines. Can they start in 2 weeks? Or is their lead time 8+ weeks?\n\n6. Executive reporting capability: Technical reports are necessary; executive summaries are strategic. If appropriate for the assessment, make sure they provide executive-ready documentation, not just technical findings.\n\nStrategic timing transforms security testing from an operational necessity into a controlled narrative.\n\nA penetration test itself takes 80 hours. The strategic value comes from when you test and what you do with the results.\n\nA little planning around timing makes your penetration test 10x more valuable to your career and your company. Testing aligned with executive meetings demonstrates proactive leadership. Testing before audits de-risks compliance. Testing before product launches integrates security into development. Testing after major CVEs demonstrates responsive operations.\n\nThe technical findings do matter. But the business outcomes matter more.\n\nSecurity leaders who master timing use their penetration tests to prove program effectiveness, justify security investments, and position security as a business enabler. Those who treat testing as a compliance checkbox miss the strategic opportunity.\n\nStrategic timing turns security testing into strategic advantage.\n\nSchedule a consultation to discuss aligning your security assessments with stakeholder presentations, compliance deadlines, and product launches. Our team brings specialized offensive security expertise from Fortune 500 environments—we understand both the technical testing and the strategic timing that makes results valuable to your business.\n\nWant to see how your current pen test schedule aligns with your strategic calendar?

    "fullText": "Universities risk surrendering their intellectual autonomy to Silicon Valley's influence as they rush to adopt AI, one professor says.\n\nIn an essay for the Civics of Technology Project — an education platform analyzing technology's societal impact — Bruna Damiana Heinsfeld, an assistant professor of learning technologies at the University of Minnesota, said that colleges are allowing Big Tech to reshape what counts as knowledge, truth, and academic value.\n\nFrom multimillion-dollar partnerships with AI vendors to classrooms infused with corporate branding, she said, universities are shifting toward a model where technological tools are bundled with the identity of the companies behind them.\n\nAs academic leaders scramble to look \"AI-ready,\" Heinsfeld warned that the sector is drifting from critical inquiry toward compliance, risking a future in which Silicon Valley, not educators, sets the terms of learning.\n\nHeinsfeld said AI tools promote a worldview where efficiency is presumed to be a virtue, scale is inherently desirable, and data becomes the default language of truth.\n\nUniversities adopting these systems without critical examination risk teaching students that the logic of Big Tech is not merely useful but inevitable, she added.\n\nHeinsfeld pointed to California State University as an example of that shift on full display.\n\nThe university signed a $16.9 million contract in February to roll out ChatGPT Edu across 23 campuses, providing more than 460,000 students and 63,000 faculty and staff with access to the tool through mid-2026.\n\nIt hosted an AWS-powered \"AI camp\" in the summer, where students arrived to find Amazon branding everywhere, including corporate slogans, AWS notebooks, and promotional swag.\n\nAnother academic said the problem is already playing out in the day-to-day mechanics of learning.\n\nKimberley Hardcastle, a business and marketing professor at Northumbria University in the UK, told Business Insider that universities must overhaul how they design assessments now that students' \"epistemic mediators\" — the tools that help them make sense of the world — have fundamentally changed.\n\nHardcastle advocates requiring students to demonstrate their reasoning: how they arrived at a conclusion, which sources they consulted beyond AI, and how they verified information against primary evidence, she said.\n\nShe said students also need deliberate \"epistemic checkpoints,\" moments designed into coursework where they must pause and ask: \"Am I using this tool to enhance my thinking or replace it? Have I engaged with the underlying concepts or just the AI's summary? Do I understand, or am I just recalling information?\"\n\nFor Heinsfeld, the risk is that corporations will dictate what constitutes legitimate knowledge. For Hardcastle, it's that students will no longer understand how to assess truth for themselves.\n\nBoth say universities must remain the space where students are taught to think, not just how to operate tools.\n\n\"Education should remain the space where we confront the architectures of our tools,\" Heinsfeld wrote. Otherwise, \"it risks becoming the laboratory of the very systems it should critique.\"\n\nHardcastle made a similar point, adding that this future will be shaped not only by institutional decisions but by every moment a student accepts an AI-generated answer without knowing how to question it.",

    "fullText": "Fernando Mendoza returns home with the Heisman and unfinished business originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nFernando Mendoza brought the Heisman Trophy back to Bloomington but made it clear the season’s most important work still lies ahead.\n\nFernando Mendoza arrived at the podium with the Heisman Trophy at his side. Its presence was heavy and unmistakable, a reflection of where Indiana football now stands.\n\nIndiana is 13–0. A Big Ten champion. Home to a Heisman winner. And yet nothing about Mendoza’s message sounded like a victory lap. This was not a moment to linger in. It was one to acknowledge, honor, and then move past.\n\n“This page is folded,” Mendoza said. “Our focus right now is winning the College Football Playoff.”\n\nThat balance defined the afternoon. Mendoza spoke about responsibility and humility, about the fraternity of Heisman winners and how the weight of the trophy only grows with time. He also spoke with emotion about family, heritage, and why it mattered to him to address his grandparents in Spanish on college football’s biggest stage.\n\n“All four of my grandparents were born and raised in Cuba,” Mendoza said. “They emigrated to the United States and sacrificed so much to support my parents and then my parents to support myself.”\n\nFor Mendoza, the moment extended beyond his own family. He referenced fellow Heisman finalist Diego Pavia, the Vanderbilt quarterback, and the sight of an entire family showing up together, something that resonated deeply.\n\n“You see like Diego Pavia’s family, he had like 100 people there too,” Mendoza said. “That’s just how the Hispanic culture is. The Hispanic family is so prideful and supportive of one another.”\n\nMORE: Jeff Monken struggles to put words to Army’s heartbreaking loss to Navy\n\nThat connection made the moment bigger than an individual award.\n\n“I thought saying something in Spanish would mean a lot to them,” Mendoza said. “And also for the Hispanic community out there, because I know there’s a lot of Hispanic football fans.”\n\nHe acknowledged the responsibility that comes with visibility, especially for young players who may not see themselves reflected in college football’s most celebrated moments.\n\n“It’s something that I’m looking forward to represent,” Mendoza said.\n\nFernando described himself as a different player than the one who arrived in spring, a transformation he said even his teammates did not foresee. Once a two star recruit committed to Yale, he now stands as the face of the most accomplished season in Indiana football history. He did not frame it as destiny. He framed it as preparation, accountability, and trust in the people around him.\n\nMORE: College Football Playoff expansion proposals that could have changed everything for Notre Dame and BYU\n\nThe Heisman Trophy mattered. The symbolism mattered. Indiana football changed in that room. But Mendoza made one thing clear. The season’s meaning will not be defined by what sits on a podium.\n\nIndiana will face the winner of Alabama and Oklahoma on New Year’s Day at the Rose Bowl with a path to the national championship now fully in view.\n\nBrian Hartline sends a message to Chris Henry Jr. after choosing Ohio State\n\nDeion Sanders expected to lose key staff member to Group of Five school\n\nTavita Pritchard comes home to Stanford with a message of ‘belief and brotherhood’",

    "description": "The biggest open source stories in 2025 clustered around AI, licensing/governance, security and the shift in the “commercial open source” business model.",
    "fullText": "AI was big in 2025, but so were many other developments and worries.\n\nThe biggest open source stories in 2025 clustered around AI, licensing/governance, security and the shift in the “commercial open source” business model. Let’s start, shall we?\n\nWhile most of the money went to proprietary models, open source AI datasets, orchestration frameworks, evaluation tools and guardrail stacks have all seen gains.\n\nSuch open source AI efforts as Common Corpus, along with the  dozens of AI projects hosted by the Linux Foundation’s AI & Data group are enabling us to use community infrastructure for generative AI rather than relying solely on proprietary APIs, making open AI stacks a serious option for businesses and users.\n\nWhile the open source AI definition remains controversial, and very few AI projects fully qualify as open source by the strict requirements of the Open Source Initiative (OSI) AI definition, AI remains built on a foundation of open source software. The debate over open weights, data and training code will continue, but even the most proprietary large language models (LLMs) couldn’t exist without open source programs.\n\nAgentic AI, owes everything to open source. To orchestrate our latest generation of AI agents, we’re using several programs.\n\nThe most important of these, at this early stage of the game, appears to be the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This is an open standard and open source implementation for uniformly connecting agents to tools, files, databases and other systems.\n\nMCP is increasingly the “plumbing layer” under many agents and IDE assistants, and there are numerous open source MCP servers and toolkits that let any compatible agent framework plug into the same tools.\n\nMCP isn’t the only agentic AI middleware that’s speeding up:\n\nA Linux Foundation report released in August showed that venture capital‑backed commercial open source companies have outperformed comparable closed‑source vendors over the last 25 years.\n\nThat report, alongside open source adoption data from an April OSI survey, which from 96% of organizations are maintaining or increasing open source software use, has cemented commercial open source as the default way to build software.\n\nTogether, these reports are driving more funding, more mergers and acquisitions, and more “open core plus services” strategies around critical open source projects.\n\nOf course, we knew that. After all, a 2024 Harvard Business School study already showed that  96% of commercial programs rely on open source and that the total value of open source code comes to a cool $8.8 trillion. That still doesn’t stop companies that made the mistake of confusing open source as a software development model with a business model; it never was. It never will be.\n\nSo it is that in 2025, we saw more companies move from open source to fauxpen source. For example, the ScyllaDBteam announced in December 2024 that it would move to a single “ScyllaDB Enterprise” stream under a source‑available license.\n\nAt the library level, there have been high‑profile examples of previously permissive projects switching quietly to source‑available, paid‑for‑commercial‑use terms, such as the Fluent Assertions .NET testing library moving, this past January, from Apache‑2.0 to a proprietary source‑available license with per‑developer fees.\n\nThen, there’s the DevOps program Puppet. Although Puppet’s core codebase is still under the Apache 2.0 open source license, its commercial parent company, Perforce, has changed how official builds are distributed and licensed.\n\nWhat changed is that new “hardened” binaries and packages built by Puppet/Perforce are now shipped from a private repository. The Puppet Core End User License Agreement (EULA) offers a free tier capped at 25 nodes, with commercial licensing required for additional nodes. Effectively, this makes Puppet a source-available program, even though the code is technically still open.\n\nThe result in Puppet’s case is the same as we’ve seen in other such attempts to close once open source projects: Unhappy programmers have forked the project. The fork is known as OpenVox.\n\nThese forked projects, which include Elasticsearch with its fork OpenSearch, Redis with the Valkey fork, and Terraform with the OpenTofu fork, have been somewhat successful. All four forks have achieved meaningful traction, but at different scales and under different definitions of  “success.”\n\nOpenSearch appears to be the most successful. It reports strong growth, including double‑digit, 78%, year‑over‑year download increases and a roster of major members such as Amazon Web Services, Canonical, SAP and Uber.\n\nValkey has also proven to be popular. The latest release, Valkey 9, is reported to be far faster than the newest version of Redis. In particular, Valkey users report that it’s consistently ahead of comparable Redis releases on raw throughput, especially on larger, memory‑heavy workloads where Valkey’s multithreaded I/O and cache‑prefetching kick in.\n\nWhile OpenSearch and Valkey have both advanced beyond their parent projects, Terraform vs. OpenTofu is another story. People still see OpenTofu and Terraform as differing only in their licenses. Over the last few months, though, that’s been changing as OpenTofu, which joined the Cloud Native Computing Foundation in April, steers more of its own course. Latest releases now include state encryption, a feature the Terraform community has wanted for years, and early variable evaluation.\n\nFinally, OpenVox continues to present itself as a “soft fork.” Its directors want it to stay 100% compatible with Puppet so it can serve as a drop-in replacement for Puppet deployments. That, however, appears to no longer be possible, as Gene Liverman, the leader of OpenVox, wrote, “We can no longer guarantee that our modules will work with Puppet Core or Puppet Enterprise.”\n\nFrom the project maintainers’ viewpoint, Perforce is breaking compatibility. For now, though, OpenVox is essentially a healthy, community lifeboat rather than a full‑scale Puppet replacement ship.\n\nDespite the simple fact that we all depend on open source, all too many projects remain underfunded. Others, such as NET 6, are still popular, but their maintainers have quit supporting them. What’s a user to do?\n\nThis isn’t a new problem. Back in 2021, Tidelift, a security company that also financially supported open source maintainers, found that 46% of open source project maintainers received no pay at all. Almost as bad, even those who were paid, a mere 26% earn more than $1,000 per year for their work.\n\nThings have not improved. In fact, they’ve gotten worse. In 2024, Tidelift’s latest results showed that now 60% of open source maintainers are unpaid.\n\nAs  an open letter signed by 10 open source foundations  and published in September pointed out, “Most of these [open source] systems operate under a dangerously fragile premise: They are often maintained, operated, and funded in ways that rely on goodwill, rather than mechanisms that align responsibility with usage.”\n\nSo it is that, according to the open letter, “a small number of organizations absorb the majority of infrastructure costs, while the overwhelming majority of large-scale users, including commercial entities that generate demand and extract economic value, consume these services without contributing to their sustainability.”\n\nA specific example that I’ve been covering is how FFMpeg, which is used by everyone who watches videos over the Internet, is horribly underfunded, even as major companies such as Amazon, Google and Netflix depend on its code. There are many other such projects. This can not continue.\n\nThe answer is that companies must — Must — start financially supporting mission-critical open source projects. The cost to do this is minute compared to the damage they’d suffer if these projects folded or were hit by a major security problem.\n\nIn 2024, the xz data compression library code, which had been deliberately infected with malware, came close to inserting a backdoor into Fedora, Red Hat’s community Linux. Had it been successful, it might have ended up in Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and its clones.\n\nThis would have led to the greatest Linux security disaster to date. We dodged a bullet.\n\nUnfortunately, the open source software supply chain security is under sustained, high-volume attack, with npm- and PyPI-focused campaigns escalating.\n\nSeveral high-impact campaigns in 2025 centered on compromising open source package ecosystems, especially npm.\n\nIn November, researchers from Wiz, Aikido, and others detailed a “Shai-Hulud 2.0” wave of trojanized npm packages that exfiltrated developer and CI/CD credentials from environments using popular libraries tied to major Software as a Service and cloud tooling.\n\nTens of thousands of malicious repos were spun up as part of the campaign. GitLab’s vulnerability research team also reported a separate widespread npm supply chain attack that harvested credentials for GitHub, npm, and major clouds and propagated by infecting additional packages owned by victims.\n\nThese are not one-off instances. Industry threat reports in 2025 describe a surge in software supply chain attacks overall, with October setting a new monthly record, and open source ecosystems featuring prominently among the targets.\n\nAnalysis from Palo Alto Networks’ Unit 42 and other research teams notes that attackers increasingly prefer compromising maintainer accounts and publish pipelines rather than core source repos, because this path can silently poison trusted packages at scale.\n\nA study by ReversingLabs, released in March, reported that, while observed open source malware packages have declined somewhat, the risk has shifted toward leaked developer secrets and build-time exposures.\n\nResearchers examining popular npm, PyPI, and RubyGems components continue to find hard-coded credentials, weak application hardening, and exposed data inside widely used binaries deployed in enterprises. That kind of mistake was stupid back in the ’80s, when I first encountered it in production software, and it’s unforgivable today.\n\nMaking matters worse, security companies such as JFrog and Veracode report that exploding dependency graphs, faster release cycles, and heavy reuse of open source libraries mean a single malicious or vulnerable package can ripple through thousands of downstream applications in days.\n\nThis dense interconnection makes the blast radius of attacks like the npm-focused campaigns in 2025 significantly larger than that of many earlier open source incidents, especially when the target libraries appear in 20 to 30% of scanned cloud environments.\n\nWhat can we do about it? We must more broadly adopt software bills of materials (SBOMs), Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts (SLSA)-style attestations, and tools from the Open Source Software Foundation ecosystem to track provenance and integrity of open source components.\n\nOpenSSF and its partners highlight initiatives such as Sigstore for keyless signing, Scorecard for automated project risk assessment, and the Open Source Project Security Baseline, which aim to give both maintainers and consumers clearer security expectations.\n\nEvery year, I tell people that they must take security more seriously. Lately, as open source supply chain violations become ever more common, I’ve been saying you must ensure the code in your supply chain is both safe and written by someone trustworthy.\n\nLooking ahead, I can only redouble these warnings. Now we’ve already had serious security breaches in the last few years. You remember: Solarwinds, JetBrains TeamCity, and Apache Log4j should all come to mind quickly. As bad as those were, worse security disasters lie ahead if we don’t take open source supply chain security much more seriously.",

    "description": "Google's TPU business is ramping up. Here's everything you need to know about Google's AI chips, and what they mean for Nvidia's dominance.",
    "fullText": "Google has been in the AI chip game for more than a decade. Now its custom hardware is moving markets.\n\nShares of Nvidia and other chipmakers tumbled last month following a report that Meta — one of Nvidia's largest customers — was exploring a deal to use Google's AI chips, known as Tensor Processing Units, or TPUs.\n\nGoogle has primarily used its TPUs for internal use, but it also leases them to external customers through the cloud. Nvidia, meanwhile, has become the dominant provider of AI chips with its graphics processing units, or GPUs.\n\nGoogle has a potential blockbuster business to unlock. In a research note sent December 2, Morgan Stanley projected that 5 million of Google's TPUs will be purchased in 2027 and about 7 million in 2028, significantly increasing its prior projections.\n\nHere's a breakdown of everything you need to know about TPUs, what they're used for, and when they might become a more prominent threat to Nvidia's chip dominance.\n\nOver a decade ago, Google needed more powerful and specialized compute power for the type of AI work it wanted to do. A team led by the now-CEO of Groq, Jonathan Ross, designed a new chip based on a specific type of integrated circuit for machine learning. The TPU was born.\n\nGoogle has continued to improve and refine its TPUs over the years, making them more effective at both training models and inference, the process where a trained model answers a question or performs a task. As large language models have grown in size, Google has also increased the memory bandwidth of later TPUs to handle these bigger workloads.\n\nGoogle says its latest \"Ironwood\" TPU, which the company is making widely available, is more than four times better than its predecessor for both training and inference.\n\nNvidia's GPU cards, which launched in 1999, were originally designed for gaming, not AI. When researchers later discovered that the chips were useful for tasks such as training neural networks, Nvidia doubled down on the AI market.\n\nGoogle's TPUs, on the other hand, were designed for AI from the get-go. Being more specialized means they're more efficient than Nvidia's chips at some tasks, and faster for running select AI models. They have something called a systolic array, which lets a more constant stream of data pass through the chip, rather than having to keep fetching more from memory.\n\nWhere Google's TPUs have a big edge is in cost at scale. It's possible to have thousands of TPUs working in tandem in a single \"pod.\" Because they are faster at some calculations than GPUs, running many TPUs at once can sometimes be more cost-efficient.\n\nThat may become more important as companies increase investments at the inference stage, which Google says its latest TPU is especially good at. That could save companies money.\n\nOne advantage that Nvidia has over Google is its CUDA software, which makes it possible for regular applications to use GPUs for general computing tasks — not just for graphics. CUDA also only works with Nvidia chips, one of the biggest points of friction stopping companies from switching to Google's chips.\n\nGoogle is trying to change that. For example, there is a lot of industry demand to have TPUs better support Pytorch, a popular tool for building AI applications that was created inside Meta. Google is allocating more resources and attention to better supporting Pytorch, which data suggests is seeing much more demand than Google's own Tensorflow software, according to Google employees and industry experts.\n\nWhen it comes to TPUs, Google remains its own biggest customer. It uses the chips across the company to power products like Search and Maps. Its latest Gemini 3 model was trained on TPUs.\n\nWhile Google has prioritized its own needs, it has leased its TPUs to other customers. Apple used TPUs to train its in-house AI model, Business Insider previously reported. In October, Anthropic announced a blockbuster deal with Google that it says will see it using up to 1 million TPUs. Broadcom, which helps build the TPU chips for Google, revealed in its Q4 earnings call this week that it has received a total of $21 billion in orders from Anthropic for Google's Ironwood TPUs.\n\nMeta is also in early testing of Google's TPUs, according to a person familiar with the matter, although it's not clear if it will result in a long-term deal.\n\nGoogle's TPU business could be poised to explode in the coming years. In a research note this month, Morgan Stanley wrote that every 500,000 TPU chips sold could potentially add around $13 billion in revenue to Google's balance sheet in 2027.\n\nHaving TPUs isn't just a potential revenue boost for Google. It also gets a feedback loop in using TPUs to run and train its AI models, learning from them, and changing how it develops its next chips to be better at the things Google needs.\n\nNvidia's GPU is still very much the chip du jour, but other tech giants are increasingly pouring resources into their own custom chips. Amazon just announced its new Trainium3 custom AI chip, which the company says can cut the cost of training and powering AI models in half compared with a GPU.\n\nMany TPU buyers are also Nvidia customers, and some industry insiders told Business Insider that it's more likely that the rise of more specialized chips will see companies and labs diversify the chips they use, rather than going all in on one provider.\n\nThat could still hurt Nvidia, which could lose pricing power as a result of a more diverse market.\n\nHowever, even if Google's TPU business finds more momentum, it doesn't mean Nvidia will suddenly crumble overnight. Jordan Nanos, member of technical staff of research firm SemiAnalysis, said his firm believes companies, including Nvidia, Google, and Amazon, will all \"sell lots\" of chips in the future.\n\n\"We don't see TPU as a significant threat to Nvidia's business, but it has been a real player in the market for many years,\" said Nanos. \"It is possible that Google sells TPU servers externally in the future, to many more customers. Right now, they are very selective.\"\n\nHave something to share? Contact this reporter via email at hlangley@businessinsider.com or Signal at hughlangley.01.

    "fullText": "Our Delta One tickets got us access to the expansive Delta Sky Club at LAX.\n\nAlong with two large buffet areas and a bar, the space had many comfortable seating zones and private bathrooms with showers.\n\nIt was fun having so many complimentary food options — including vegan ones — but we tried not to overdo it as we had already pre-selected meals for our flight.\n\nWhen it was time to board the plane, we walked over to our gate and were among the first passengers welcomed.\n\nAs we settled into our seats, the friendly flight attendants offered us drinks and snacks right away.\n\nSince the plane had a staggered layout and my husband and I both wanted window seats, my \"suite\" was one row behind his.\n\nThat meant we couldn't hold hands, as we usually do, during takeoff. But rather than feeling nervous, I felt safely cocooned in my personal space.\n\nThe suite had a door to slide shut for privacy and side buttons for adjusting the seat's angle and lighting.\n\nThe blanket and pillow were cozy, and the travel kit had some useful amenities, like slippers, lip balm, hand cream, and an eye mask.\n\nI was hoping for a pair of pajamas, but those weren't offered on our 8 p.m. flight.\n\nOnce we leveled off, I was able to fully recline in the Delta One lie-flat seats. It was such a relief.\n\nMore than anything, the ability to lie down flat made the biggest difference in how much I enjoyed the long flight.\n\nI was even able to fall asleep off and on — something I'm never able to do on a plane\n\nUnlike me, my husband doesn't mind flying — he just doesn't like the lack of space on most plane seats. At over 6 feet tall with a burly build and size-14 shoes, he's always hoping for more legroom.\n\nFortunately, the Delta One suite delivered with its roomy seat and foot cubby.\n\nMy husband was so comfortable that he didn't even bother taking off his shoes or fully reclining during the entire flight.\n\nOur overnight flight included a three-course dinner and next-day breakfast, plus plenty of snacks and drinks.\n\nWe had ordered vegan options and were pleasantly surprised at how tasty the food was, from grain bowls to salads to plates with hummus and veggies.\n\nThe retractable table I ate on felt roomy and sturdy, and eating with real silverware, porcelain dishes, and cloth napkins elevated the experience.\n\nWatching TV on the nicely sized screen in front of me helped me forget I was in a flying metal tube thousands of feet above the ground.\n\nThough Delta offered plenty of new movies and shows for me to stream, I ended up turning to old favorites like \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" and listening to soothing music.\n\nMeanwhile, my husband was rocking out to a famous Bruce Springsteen concert from 1979.\n\nAll in all, our pricey flight was so enjoyable that I almost wished it lasted longer.\n\nWhen we landed at Heathrow Airport the following afternoon, we didn't even have jet lag. We just felt ready to take on the day.\n\nSplurging isn't always possible, but we're keeping our options open for future flights. As they say, it's not about the destination, it's about the journey.",

    "fullText": "When it comes to regrets, Michael Burry has a few.\n\nThe investor of \"The Big Short\" fame, who bet on GameStop years before it became a meme, explained why he sold the stock before it skyrocketed in a Substack post on Monday night.\n\nBurry, who recently pivoted from hedge fund manager to online writer, first invested in GameStop in the summer of 2018. The video-game retailer's stock looked undervalued to him, and he saw an array of catalysts that could send it higher, he wrote.\n\nThey included a console refresh in 2020, the possibility of a buyout, the potential sale of the Spring Mobile business, and strong cash flows and a large cash pile offering scope for a \"very big and consequential buyback,\" Burry wrote.\n\nHe exited the position in the second quarter of 2019 after the stock failed to budge. But he reinvested in July 2019, buying the stock \"with both hands\" and making it one of his larger holdings, in part because high short interest presented a fresh catalyst, he wrote.\n\n\"I visited a GameStop store to make sure I was not crazy,\" Burry wrote. \"It did not work. Even the stuff that was not on sale looked like it should be on sale.\"\n\nBurry wrote to GameStop's board to push for changes at the company. He shared that his public activism drew emails from Keith \"Roaring Kitty\" Gill, a retail investor who would become the face of the GameStop meme mania, and Chewy cofounder Ryan Cohen, who would go on to become GameStop's CEO.\n\nBurry said he bought into GameStop the second time at a split-adjusted average price of 83 cents, or less than 1/26 of the current $22 stock price.\n\nHe purchased an almost 5% stake and held it for more than 16 months. \"Most of that time, I lent my shares out at very good rates — high double digits — which was lucrative and a big part of the trade,\" he wrote.\n\nBurry cashed out by the end of November 2020, selling his shares for an average of $3.38 each, or more than four times what he paid.\n\nWeeks later, retail investors on forums such as r/WallStreetBets executed a historic squeeze on GameStop short sellers, sending the stock to an intraday high of over $120 on January 28, 2021.\n\n\"At the peak my yearslong investment might have turned $12 million into $1 billion, but that was never a possibility,\" Burry wrote, noting that he would have sold long before that point.\n\nBurry — best known for predicting and profiting from the housing crash that preceded the 2008 financial crisis, a story told in the book and movie \"The Big Short\" — reflected on whether he should have played his hand differently.\n\n\"I could have analyzed that situation better,\" he said. \"I knew GameStop inside and out, and I thought I understood the volume, short interest, and other dynamics. However, I was blinded by what I saw as execution risk.\"\n\nHe'd also lost faith in a huge stock rebound. \"As well, I am human,\" he wrote, adding that large-scale buybacks, board changes, and the sale of Spring Mobile had been \"home run/slam dunk activist successes with concrete results but zero impact on price or short interest.\"\n\nBurry seized the chance to close out his bet after GameStop shares spiked following Cohen's disclosure of his stake.\n\n\"I had no idea what was coming,\" he wrote. \"I had no idea that a Roaring Kitty existed.\"\n\n\"And I had no idea that a widely distributed gamma squeeze would thread the needle to become the one and only legal market corner,\" he added.\n\nAround 50 days after he exited, that \"ignominious crappy business\" had become the \"belle of the ball,\" Burry wrote. \"The entire world could not take their eyes off her. And neither could I.\"\n\nBurry said he had mixed feelings about the meme-stock mania of early 2021: \"It was spectacular. It was hilarious. It was tragic in turn.\"\n\nBut he decided it was \"less fun\" by the middle of 2021, when non-fungible tokens (NFTs) were soaring in value along with \"watches, shoes, just about everything.\"\n\nBurry said he feared retail investors would be \"shredded on this meme thing,\" and warned them to watch out. He spoke out because \"if there is one thing I wish I could have done, it was to have effectively warned or spoken about what was happening in 2005-2007,\" he wrote.\n\nThe deep-value investor, who moonlighted as an investment blogger in medical school, also teased an upcoming post that will be a \"breakdown of GameStop as an investment today.\"\n\n\"As a melting ice cube and a capital structure with some optionality, GameStop is roughly as I approached it in 2018, except it is only 16% shorted, all the numbers are 10 times bigger and Ryan is running it, for better or worse,\" he wrote.",

    "title": "Use the Eight Elements of the ‘Flow State’ to Be More Productive",
    "description": "Being in a \"flow state\" is way more than just some corporate lingo.",
    "fullText": "You hear people talk about working in a “flow state,” but what does that even mean? before you start thinking of it as one of those corporate jargon phrases that gets tossed around so much it loses any meaning it ever had, it's worth knowing that it's a \"real\" thing, backed up by a whole lot of psychological research. In essence, being in a flow state enables you to work more efficiently and effectively at whatever you're focused on.\n\nPsychologist Mihály Csíkszentmihályi came up with this theory in 1970, suggesting a flow state is similar to when someone is floating along, being carried by water: Their brains are working so efficiently they’re moving straight ahead on a task with no issues, almost as if they are being propelled forward.\n\nHe spent his time interviewing artists and athletes at the top of their game to understand when and how they performed optimally—and how everyday people can tap into a “flow” state, too. He wrote several books on the topic, but for our purposes here, you don't need to ingest all of them. What's most important is to understand the eight main traits of flow theory.\n\nCsíkszentmihályi’s work ultimately describes eight clear characteristics of being in flow:\n\nYou’re completely concentrated on your task.\n\nYou have clarity around goals in your mind and can get immediate feedback.\n\nTime feels like it's transforming, either speeding up or slowing down.\n\nThe work is intrinsically rewarding.\n\nThere is a sense of effortlessness or ease.\n\nThe work is challenging, but you have the skills for it.\n\nYou are not self-conscious; actions and awareness are working together.\n\nYou feel you have control over the task.\n\nThis may remind you of the concept of “deep work,” which is author/professor Cal Newport’s definition of doing demanding tasks when you’re fully engrossed in them and not distracted. The two concepts are similar, but to achieve either, there are a few things you need to do. It’s clear from the list of flow characteristics above that mastery and resources play a big role in whether you'll feel you’re in a flow state when you're working. Obviously you’ll likely only hit this state if you’re doing something you’re completely prepared for, so don’t aim for it if you’re going to be doing something that requires contributions from other people, resources you don’t have, or skills you don’t possess. You can be ripped from it quickly if, say, you're waiting around for a colleague to email you something you need for the project, which can destabilize your whole day. (For a better understanding of that, it's worth familiarizing yourself with the difference between downtime and idle time.)\n\nWhen you are trying to hit a flow state, plan around when you need to do a major, demanding task. For instance, when planning your 1-3-5 to-do list for the day, your one big task should be one you’re fully prepared and have all the resources for. Keep Carlson’s Law—the idea that any work you attempt to do while distracted will be suboptimal—in mind, too; you can’t work, let alone flow, if you’re being pulled in multiple directions, so schedule the time you’re going to take on your big task to coincide with a time when you have nothing else going on and can give it your full attention. Use timeboxing to allocate this time in your schedule, minute by minute, and, if you can, make your calendar publicly visible so people in your organization know you’re not available.\n\nWhen I explored adopting this mindset in my own life, I found that my biggest blocker was dealing with distractions, especially from my phone (no surprise there). Almost counterintuitively, I found two apps to be helpful: Steppin, which blocks my access to distracting apps unless I trade time I've banked by walking around in the real world; and Focus Pomo, which blocks all other apps whenever I'm in a \"focus session.\"\n\nSo, if you’re working hard on something but don’t feel like you’re achieving any kind of flow state, refer back to the list of characteristics to see what’s missing. Are you distracted? Do you not have the option to get immediate feedback? Are you lacking a necessary resource? Is the work too challenging for your skills or maybe even not challenging enough to keep your attention? Identifying which characteristic you’re lacking most will help you fix the problem and get you closer to flowing your way to major productivity.",

    "fullText": "Region struggling with drought now threatened by energy-hungry facilities – but some residents are fighting back\n\nThe sign outside Tom Hermes’s farmyard in Perkins Township in Ohio, a short drive south of the shores of Lake Erie, proudly claims that his family have farmed the land here since 1900. Today, he raises 130 head of cattle and grows corn, wheat, grass and soybeans on 1,200 acres of land.\n\nFor his family, his animals and wider business, water is life.\n\nSo when, in May 2024, the Texas-based Aligned Data Centers broke ground on its NEO-01, four-building, 200,000 sq ft data center on a brownfield site that abuts farmland that Hermes rents, he was concerned.\n\n“We have city water here. That’s going to reduce the pressure if they are sucking all the water,” he says of the data center.\n\n“They’re not good, I know that.”\n\nTwo years ago, the company said it would invest about $202m on a “hyperscale” data center that would employ 18 people and dozens \n\nAll the while, a 10-minute drive north, the shoreline of Lake Erie hasn’t been this low in years.\n\nWater levels across all five Great Lakes have begun to drop in recent months as part of a long-term fall. Since 2019, the Great Lakes have seen water-level decreases of two to four feet. While experts say this is a natural decrease given the record highs the lakes have experienced since 2020, it’s happening at a time when a huge new consumer of water has appeared on the horizon: data centers.\n\nThe source of the largest single deposit of freshwater on the planet, the Great Lakes, in particular Lake Erie, are already struggling with the fallout of drought and warmer water temperatures that, at this time of year, fuel major lake-effect snowstorms, and greater than normal levels of evaporation due to the absence of ice cover.\n\nWith major cities such as Chicago, Toronto, Detroit and Pittsburgh all within a few hundred miles of each other, small, under-resourced communities around the Great Lakes have become hugely attractive for data-center companies.\n\nIn Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin, Microsoft is building what it calls the “world’s most-powerful AI data center” that is set to open early next year and expected to use up to 8.4bn gallons of municipal water from the city of Racine every year. Racine gets its water from Lake Michigan. Similar stories are playing out in Hobart, Indiana, where AWS is planning to build a data center two miles from Lake Michigan’s shoreline, and in Port Washington, Wisconsin.\n\nIn Benton Harbor, Michigan, locals are concerned that a proposed $3bn data center would contribute to environmental pollution and traffic.\n\nForty miles west of Aligned’s under-construction data center in Ohio, in Woodville Township, hundreds of people showed up to a public meeting last October to voice concern about another proposed data center project in their rural community.\n\n“The Great Lakes region, especially in states such as Illinois and Ohio, [is] among the most data-center dense states in the region. In addition to the high volumes of water used on site for cooling, our recent research found that even more water may be consumed to generate electricity to power data centers’ energy needs,” says Kirsten James, senior program director for water at Ceres, a nonprofit headquartered in Boston.\n\n“These impacts can conflict with communities’ water-resource planning efforts.”\n\nThe Great Lakes Compact, a 2005 accord signed by the governors of eight US states and two Canadian provinces, means that Great Lakes Water must only be used within the regional basin.\n\nResearch by Purdue University found that data centers on average consume about 300,000 gallons of water a day. Water used by data centers is warmed significantly and for those that do not use a closed loop system, that heated effluent water, just 20% of the initial amount, is often discharged back into local wastewater systems or the environment, with potentially serious consequences for flora, fauna and human consumers. Even closed-loop systems that reuse the same water repeatedly need millions of gallons of water.\n\nWhile many new data centers are drawing water from local municipalities that, in turn, get their water from groundwater, much of that supply comes from the Great Lakes watersheds.\n\nSome communities are fighting back. Last month, residents of Fife Lake, Michigan, were overjoyed after hearing a plan for a data center in their town of 471 residents would be scrapped due to local opposition.\n\nSimilar stories of successful opposition have played out in Indiana and elsewhere.\n\nBut the data centers are fighting back.\n\nPrivate firms representing data center companies have often successfully sued community authorities, accusing them of illegally excluding certain types of developments, making small towns powerless in the battle to keep out giant water-guzzling corporations.\n\nIn Michigan’s Saline Township, a community of about 400 people outside Ann Arbor, OpenAI and Oracle used a representative company to successfully sue the local authority to overcome opposition and build a massive facility that would use 1.4 gigawatts of electricity – roughly the equivalent of powering 1.4 million homes.\n\nThe Detroit Free Press editorial board assailed the move, calling it a “a fait accompli, hammered into this tiny Washtenaw county community over the objections of residents, the elected board that represents them, and Michigan’s attorney general, absent expert or outside testimony save a cursory public hearing held over Microsoft Teams”.\n\nData companies and their backers, however, say their presence is a net gain for Great Lakes communities by providing jobs and investment over the course of years.\n\nAligned has paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to Perkins Township, the local school system and a career center. In return, it gets a 15-year tax exemption from local authorities. A representative declined to respond to questions from the Guardian asking how much water it intends to use at the data center and from where it originates.\n\nLocal municipalities that support these facilities claim that the data centers will increase tax revenue and help rebuild ageing infrastructure such as water delivery systems that, in some places, are in significant need of upgrading. Calls, emails and messages left with Erie county commissioners asking if local authorities plan to supply the Perkins Township data center with water were not responded to.\n\nSome Perkins Township residents say a number of local companies have been hired during the construction phase, bringing work to the area.\n\nBut many argue those investments are not worth the long-term price the community may pay.\n\nAmanda Voegle, who works at a heating business now directly facing the data center, is concerned about water and many other issues.\n\n“A couple of years ago, there was a water pollution issue at the site. I’m very concerned. Is this [water] going back into the lake?”\n\nTwo years ago, the construction site upon which the data center is being built was found to be the source of contamination of a river that flows into Lake Erie, with the remediation company responsible cited by the Ohio EPA for unauthorized discharges into state waters.\n\n“I don’t understand why they built it so close to the street, because it’s an eyesore,” says Voegle.\n\nShe says there have been other unusual incidents at her workplace recently, including power surges.\n\n“I don’t know if it’s related [to the data center]. It’s probably almost weekly that we lose power and have to fully reboot everything. There was a couple of things we actually had to replace because [the power surge] fried it.”",

    "fullText": "David Chung is a serial entrepreneur and CEO of multiple beauty brands.\n\nFarmacy Beauty, which he founded in 2015, was acquired by Procter & Gamble for $350 million.\n\nHe isn't driven by money, and at 66, he can't envision retiring, he says.\n\nThis as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with David Chung, owner and chairman of Amare Global. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI couldn't believe there was a banana just sitting on the kitchen table. In Korea, having a banana was a big deal, but when I immigrated to New York City at 12, we had fruit and even M&Ms. Everything was so luxurious.\n\nMy mother immigrated to the US in 1963 with less than $100. When she arrived in New York, she started a small, mom-and-pop gift shop. She grew the business through and eventually got her green card. I joined her about eight years later, in the middle of a New York winter. I didn't speak the language, but I felt lucky to be in the US.\n\nMy mother continued to grow her store, expanding into a drugstore and pharmacy. By the early 2000s, she had a business worth tens of millions.\n\nShe was very, very entrepreneurial. Watching her journey inspired me and has carried over even today. I have a lot of her DNA when it comes to business. Now that I'm 66, I'll think, \"I'm just like my mother!\" It's scary.\n\nMy mom's business set the stage for mine. Working in her shop, I saw that beauty products provided a great business opportunity. The products are small, which reduces warehousing and shipping costs. They're consumable, so customers return again and again. And even if the economy is bad, people don't give up on their skin.\n\nI went to college, but I found it difficult to concentrate because I was always thinking about starting my business. Even today, I don't drive much because I get so distracted thinking about running my companies (instead, I use a driver). Eventually, I graduated with a degree in engineering.\n\nRight next to my school, there was a small video rental store. These were the days before Blockbuster. I bought that store when I was 23, and expanded it slowly to sell gifts and cosmetics.\n\nThat was my start in business. Other than my mom, I've never worked for anyone else. That meant I had to learn hard lessons about business structure, processes, and systems on my own.\n\nOver time, I pivoted from retail to research, design, and manufacturing. In 2018, I sold my shares in one company for $53.7 million. In 2021, I sold my company, Farmacy Beauty, for hundreds of millions (I'm not allowed to share the specific amount). I remember being at my computer on December 31st, watching the funds being deposited into my account. I didn't feel anything. I didn't think \"I'm rich now.\" I didn't even go out to dinner to celebrate.\n\nEntrepreneurship has never been about money for me. It's more about the accomplishment and excitement of building something. I remember the first time I was in a room with people who had more credentials than me. I came up with an idea they hadn't considered. That's the first time I realized that I had a different way of thinking about things.\n\nI have a huge amount of money now — I could never spend it all. And yet, when those funds hit my account, I didn't buy a Rolex or a fancy car. I went out and bought another company to run.\n\nRecently, I told an employee that I'm going to retire in three years. She laughed and said I told her the same thing 15 years ago.\n\nI don't think I will ever retire fully. God has given me a talent for being business-minded and good at what I'm doing. I want to utilize that as long as I'm able to.\n\nMy mother was very passionate about giving back, particularly to the Korean American community. I figure the more money I make, the more I can give back. So, why not use this skill?",

    "title": "3 holiday shopping rules I swear by after two decades investing in small businesses",
    "description": "Skip the one-day shipping. A small-business expert shares how shoppers can help small brands grow through slower spending and thoughtful purchases.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with KK Hart, a 40-year-old multi-entrepreneur and business acquisition expert based in Dallas. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nFor the past 20 years of my career, I've supported small businesses. First as a consultant and then, through an unexpected journey, in business acquisition. As a non-institutional investor — which means I use my own money to invest and am not part of a fund or organization — I've purchased and led 10 small businesses, from brick-and-mortar fitness studios to skincare brands such as Ghost Democracy, my most recent acquisition.\n\nAs someone who has seen the inner workings of many businesses, I can say there's a mismatch between what consumers think small businesses need during this time of year and what they actually want. My passion is helping consumers understand how they can improve a small brand's profit margin and long-term viability during the holiday season and beyond.\n\nHere are three high-impact shopping strategies to try.\n\nShoppers have been trained to value speed and low cost, but small brands generally can't match that. When you look for the free or one-day shipping, you're asking a small business to compete on money — often at a loss, especially when you consider that logistics costs went up this year for small businesses.\n\nInstead, I like to encourage people to think of intentionality as the new convenience and prioritize slower shopping. I like to start planning what I might buy for the holiday season at the beginning of the year, so that I can shop more slowly in Q3 and Q4.\n\nWhen consumers slow down their purchasing and think more carefully about what they're buying, it leads to less friction and fewer returns, which are a massive cost for retailers. If you go slower, you have a week or two to ask the brand questions, like about their formulation or how they stack up to a competitive brand, and ensure you're making the best purchase for you. People are always surprised to find that small businesses actually respond honestly.\n\nIf you've missed a shipping deadline for a small business this year, go for gift cards. Gift cards are 100% cash flow for a small business, minimize returns, and allow your gift recipient to choose what they actually want.\n\nThe heart of this season is about giving and joy. I can tell you that business owners would like to have a lot of joy year-round — not just during the holiday season.\n\nYes, that can mean buying throughout the year and being a repeat customer to the brands you love. The post-holiday rush in January is a cash flow desert for many businesses.\n\nSupport can also look like leaving a review. While there's a lot of emphasis on the dollar amount going to small businesses, feedback can matter just as much. Your purchase in December and your review shortly thereafter could fuel purchases in July and August when things aren't as exciting. That creates more than money in the moment — it gives us a marketing asset all year long.\n\nFinally, think beyond the items you want to own and focus on how you can make an impact. When you consider what you really want from a product and purchase, you think differently than what's the lowest cost and the most convenient.\n\nAnytime I spend money, even as a consumer, I like to think about who I'm investing in. It's impactful to put your money into a small business, where it goes directly into a family's pocket and could impact their business for generations to come. When you invest in a brand in this way, you give them more than just your immediate gratification.\n\nAdditionally, it's also good to purchase items on first-party platforms, or a business's direct website, which places the marketplace commission back into the owner's hands. This is often overlooked, but a truly tangible way to make an impact.\n\nEssentially, you want to go from being a customer to thinking like a capital owner. That was my journey — realizing that the real impact is not in what you buy, but what you can help create with the money you spend.",

    "description": "A Business Insider reporter taste-tested Ina Garten and Martha Stewart's latke recipes for Hanukkah to compare the two celebrity chefs' recipes.",
    "fullText": "The recipe lists potatoes, an egg, flour, salt, and pepper.\n\nI was surprised to find that the recipe called for frying the latkes in clarified butter, rather than oil. Eating foods fried in oil is part of Hanukkah tradition, so I was a bit skeptical about this change.\n\nI managed to cut myself almost immediately. Grate with caution.\n\nThe resulting batter had the consistency of oatmeal.\n\nThe recipe includes instructions for how to make clarified butter. You can also just buy ghee at a grocery store and skip this step.\n\nThe process reminded me of skimming the fat off the top of chicken soup. It was easy, but it took extra time waiting for the solids to settle.\n\nGarten's recipe instructs using a tablespoon of the potato mixture for each latke.\n\nI also loved that frying the latkes in butter didn't make my entire apartment and person smell like oil. It's a strong scent that tends to linger. These just smelled mildly like melted butter, which was amazing.\n\nSince no additional ingredients were added to the batter, the potato flavor shone through, and the buttery crust was delicious.\n\nIt didn't have the oily taste of a traditional latke, but I actually preferred the milder taste of butter.\n\nStewart's recipe involved twice the amount of potatoes and eggs that were in Garten's, as well as additions like grated onion and beer.\n\nStewart's recipe says to reserve this potato juice, let the milky starch sink to the bottom, and pour off the liquid — similar to the clarified butter I made for Garten's recipe.\n\nGrated onions are standard in latke recipes — beer, not as much. I was curious to see how it would affect the flavor and texture.\n\nThe larger latkes took much longer to fry than Garten's, and they were a little more unruly to flip. I'm still trying to get a resulting oil splash out of my favorite jeans.\n\nI could already tell that these latkes were going to be the more traditional of the two.\n\nI couldn't taste the beer, but the grated onion and the crispy, oily goodness created a sharper flavor that screamed Hanukkah to me.\n\nEven though they're not fried in oil — which is kind of the point of eating them on this holiday — I enjoyed Garten's latkes more because they were easier and faster to make, and they had a mild, buttery flavor that I loved. Stewart's recipe, however, is perfect for traditionalists.",

    "description": "Andrew Left is headed for a big legal fight in 2026. Business Insider viewed his conversation with Claude to see how he's prepping for the case.",
    "fullText": "Famed short-seller Andrew Left is in the legal fight of his life, set to stand trial in March on allegations of market manipulation and making false and misleading social-media posts about his trading plans.\n\nAs he prepares to battle the feds, one of the places he's gone to for help is Claude. No, that's not the name of his defense lawyer. Claude, in this case, is Anthropic's popular AI chatbot.\n\nBusiness Insider recently got a look at how Left is using artificial intelligence in connection with his criminal case when he included a chat log during an email exchange with us.\n\nIt showed Left peppering Claude with questions and even asking it to draft a letter that his human legal team could, hypothetically, send to the Department of Justice.\n\nIt started with a simple but important question from the outspoken investor behind Citron Research: \"is this good or bad for andrew left\".\n\nLeft, who said he didn't mean to send the chat log to Business Insider, later explained he had uploaded to Claude a document related to his case and wanted a quick, easy-to-understand analysis.\n\n\"If you're ever in a court case, you just get something from the DOJ — instead of reading eight pages, you just put it into AI,\" he said after Business Insider asked him about the log. \"You go, 'What does this mean?'\"\n\nLeft, 55, became something of a market celebrity a decade ago after he raised serious claims about the business practices of Valeant Pharmaceuticals, which was later investigated by federal prosecutors, regulators, and Congress.\n\nHe has also predicted the business woes of companies like Nikola and Hertz, which gave his research reports market-moving sway.\n\nIn filing criminal charges last year, federal prosecutors alleged that Left took trading positions contrary to those market moves in order to reap quick profits. They say he manipulated prices over roughly five years across at least 23 different stocks and made false statements to regulators about coordinating his trades with hedge funds.\n\nThe docket for his case shows seven attorneys who previously or currently represent Left. But Claude, which has been gaining traction with lawyers, apparently came in handy one day last month.\n\nEric Rosen, a partner at Dynamis LLP, one of the firms representing Left, told Business Insider that AI can be valuable as a tool for understanding complex legal materials but cautioned against relying on it too much.\n\n\"It gives you a lot of feedback that you want to hear,\" he said. \"But, you don't know how a judge is going to react to some of these arguments.\"\n\nAlthough Business Insider only saw a portion of Left's conversation with Claude, it was clear that the document he uploaded had something to do with Nvidia. That made sense since the federal indictment alleges Left took a bullish position in the chipmaker's stock in November 2018, tweeted a lofty price target for it, then sold shares hours later, after they spiked.\n\nIn an answer to Left's query about the document, Claude had what sounded like good news, saying it revealed \"critical weaknesses\" in the government's case that was \"potentially very good\" for him.\n\nIt then listed four \"major problems\" with the Justice Department case and offered four \"best defenses\":\n\nLeft volleyed back at the chatbot, playfully patting himself on the back — and Claude gave him positive reinforcement.\n\nThe chatbot then singled out a specific thing that Left had tweeted, that Nvidia would reach \"$165 before $120.\" (It was at about $144 at the time.) Claude pointed out that the stock actually bottomed out at $124 in December before rising to $160 by June 2019.\n\n\"You were spectacularly right at a critical inflection point,\" the chatbot reassured Left.\n\nIn the same response, Claude broke down what it sees as the \"real issue\":\n\nLeft's next two prompts dealt with a stock split announced by Nvidia. The end goal of his inquiries was to show that — factoring in splits — he was directionally correct with his bullish price target on Nvidia stock.\n\nAfter Claude laid out an analysis reassuring Left that his Nvidia forecast was ultimately correct, he followed up with:\n\nAnd then here's what Claude said about the \"legal implication\":\n\n(Note that the supposed 1,300% gain is based on an incorrectly calculated current stock price for Nvidia. It is trading at around $176 a share, not the split-adjusted $1,931 used by Claude.)\n\nLeft wasn't done. He asked Claude to put all his responses into a letter addressed to the DOJ from his attorney. His only suggestion was to make it \"not AI sounding.\"\n\nAfter it returned a roughly 250-word block of text, Left had another edit:\n\nThat got it down to about 150 words. What next?\n\nEver-obedient, Claude spat out this:\n\nMatthew Cain, whose name surfaced when Claude analyzed the document, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nLeft said that for him, the AI served as a kind of thought partner.\n\n\"I was writing because I wanted to figure out, as we were going into this case and my attorneys met with the Department of Justice, how to try and explain it,\" he told Business Insider.\n\nLeft noted that he'd seen the AI misinterpret the law, but he does not worry about the chatbot's hallucinations.\n\n\"I run all ideas to just see the other side of the argument,\" he said. \"It definitely opens your mind up, but you cannot rely on it for matters of law.\"\n\nAnthropic, the makers of the Claude chatbot, did not respond to Business Insider's request for a comment. The Justice Department also did not comment.\n\nIt's not clear if Claude's text for a letter ever made its way to Left's defense team or to prosecutors, but he didn't sell it short to us. In fact, he told Business Insider that Claude is his favorite AI.",

    "description": "David Chung shares how his mother's immigrant journey inspired him to build a multimillion-dollar beauty business from the ground up.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with David Chung, owner and chairman of Amare Global. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI couldn't believe there was a banana just sitting on the kitchen table. In Korea, having a banana was a big deal, but when I immigrated to New York City at 12, we had fruit and even M&Ms. Everything was so luxurious.\n\nMy mother immigrated to the US in 1963 with less than $100. When she arrived in New York, she started a small, mom-and-pop gift shop. She grew the business through and eventually got her green card. I joined her about eight years later, in the middle of a New York winter. I didn't speak the language, but I felt lucky to be in the US.\n\nMy mother continued to grow her store, expanding into a drugstore and pharmacy. By the early 2000s, she had a business worth tens of millions.\n\nShe was very, very entrepreneurial. Watching her journey inspired me and has carried over even today. I have a lot of her DNA when it comes to business. Now that I'm 66, I'll think, \"I'm just like my mother!\" It's scary.\n\nMy mom's business set the stage for mine. Working in her shop, I saw that beauty products provided a great business opportunity. The products are small, which reduces warehousing and shipping costs. They're consumable, so customers return again and again. And even if the economy is bad, people don't give up on their skin.\n\nI went to college, but I found it difficult to concentrate because I was always thinking about starting my business. Even today, I don't drive much because I get so distracted thinking about running my companies (instead, I use a driver). Eventually, I graduated with a degree in engineering.\n\nRight next to my school, there was a small video rental store. These were the days before Blockbuster. I bought that store when I was 23, and expanded it slowly to sell gifts and cosmetics.\n\nThat was my start in business. Other than my mom, I've never worked for anyone else. That meant I had to learn hard lessons about business structure, processes, and systems on my own.\n\nOver time, I pivoted from retail to research, design, and manufacturing. In 2018, I sold my shares in one company for $53.7 million. In 2021, I sold my company, Farmacy Beauty, for hundreds of millions (I'm not allowed to share the specific amount). I remember being at my computer on December 31st, watching the funds being deposited into my account. I didn't feel anything. I didn't think \"I'm rich now.\" I didn't even go out to dinner to celebrate.\n\nEntrepreneurship has never been about money for me. It's more about the accomplishment and excitement of building something. I remember the first time I was in a room with people who had more credentials than me. I came up with an idea they hadn't considered. That's the first time I realized that I had a different way of thinking about things.\n\nI have a huge amount of money now — I could never spend it all. And yet, when those funds hit my account, I didn't buy a Rolex or a fancy car. I went out and bought another company to run.\n\nRecently, I told an employee that I'm going to retire in three years. She laughed and said I told her the same thing 15 years ago.\n\nI don't think I will ever retire fully. God has given me a talent for being business-minded and good at what I'm doing. I want to utilize that as long as I'm able to.\n\nMy mother was very passionate about giving back, particularly to the Korean American community. I figure the more money I make, the more I can give back. So, why not use this skill?",

    "fullText": "Dec 14 (Reuters) - iRobot (IRBT), the maker of the Roomba vacuum cleaner, filed for bankruptcy protection on Sunday, saying that it would go private after being bought by Picea Robotics, its primary ​manufacturer.\n\nThe company, which raised concerns about staying in business in March, filed for Chapter 11 protection ‌in Delaware bankruptcy court as it grapples with increased competition from lower-priced rivals and new U.S. tariffs.\n\niRobot generated about $682 million in total ‌revenue in 2024, but its profits have been eroded by competition from Chinese rivals like Ecovacs Robotics. iRobot remains dominant in key markets like the U.S. and Japan, but competition forced it to lower its prices and make substantial investments in technological upgrades, according to bankruptcy court filings.\n\nNew U.S. tariffs have also harmed the company, especially a 46% ⁠levy on imports from Vietnam, where ‌iRobot manufactures vacuum cleaners for the U.S. market. The tariffs raised the company’s costs by $23 million in 2025, while making it more difficult to plan for the future, according ‍to iRobot's court filings.\n\nThe company, which was the target of a thwarted $1.4 billion buyout by Amazon.com, has about $190 million in debt.\n\nThe debt stems from a 2023 loan that iRobot used to refinance its operations while a European competition investigation stalled the ​Amazon (AMZN) deal.\n\nAfter the Amazon deal fell apart and iRobot fell behind on payments to Picea, the China-based ‌manufacturer acquired iRobot's debt from a group of investment funds managed by the Carlyle Group, according to court documents.\n\nThe stock fell 83% during premarket trading on Monday.\n\nUnder iRobot's bankruptcy plan, Picea will take 100% of the company's equity and cancel the $190 million remaining on the 2023 loan, as well as an additional $74 million debt that iRobot owes to Picea under the companies' manufacturing agreement.\n\nOther creditors and suppliers will be paid in full, according to iRobot's bankruptcy court filings.\n\niRobot said the bankruptcy ⁠is not expected to disrupt its app functionality, customer programs, global ​partners, supply chain relationships or product support.\n\nThe loss-making company was valued ​at $3.56 billion in 2021, driven by pandemic-fueled demand, but it is now worth around $140 million, according to data compiled by LSEG.\n\niRobot was founded in 1990 by three Massachusetts Institute ‍of Technology roboticists. It initially ⁠focused on defense and space work before debuting the Roomba robotic vacuum in 2002.\n\nThe Roomba was an immediate success and it holds about 42% of the U.S. market share and 65% of the Japanese ⁠market share for robotic vacuum cleaners, according to the company.",

    "description": "American has axed first class for a single business cabin with beds and doors. The plane is overall chic and modern, but there's a row I'd avoid.",
    "fullText": "Out with the old and in with the new: American Airlines' niche cross-country Airbus jet is getting a major upgrade.\n\nOn Thursday, I toured American's first-ever Airbus A321XLR — a stretched narrowbody that can fly up to 5,400 miles (11 hours) nonstop thanks to an extra fuel tank. It's the first among US carriers.\n\nAmerican's A321XLR will replace roughly a dozen of its aging A321T jets that fly select domestic routes. The \"T\" stands for transcontinental, and the specific aircraft type is an Airbus A321-200.\n\nFor about a decade, the A321T has shuttled high-paying business and first-class passengers across the US as American's bi-coastal workhorse.\n\nThe modern A321XLR, which will launch its first cross-country route from New York to Los Angeles on December 18, retains the A321T's signature three-class layout and enhanced meal and drink service.\n\nBut the most premium cabins will feature a distinctly different design. There's no more first class; instead, a single front business cabin in a 1x1 configuration will give travelers direct aisle access.\n\nThere is also a premium economy cabin. And the coach cabin has been fine-tuned with more comfortable seats, USB-C outlets, and Bluetooth-compatible seatback screens.\n\nFares on New York—Los Angeles flights hover around $200 round-trip in economy, $1,000 in premium economy, and $2,000 in business in early 2026, rising during the busier spring break, summer, and holiday seasons.\n\nUnlike the A321T, the A321XLR will also fly transatlantic routes, beginning with New York to Edinburgh in March and eventually expanding to other European destinations. Tickets start at $600 in coach, $2,700 in premium economy, and $3,700 in business before peak-season increases.\n\nTransatlantic flying is central to the A321XLR's appeal: its range makes longer routes viable and opens access to far-flung cities that can't support a widebody (e.g., a Boeing 767 or an Airbus A330) or are out of reach for older narrowbodies. Think New York to West Africa or Florida to Northern Italy.\n\nAmerican sees the A321XLR as an opportunity to tap into this growing market for long, thin transatlantic routes while rebuilding a long-haul footprint to catch up to Delta and United, which have recovered and expanded faster post-COVID.\n\nStill, it also marks the end of an era for the A321T. But I think most customers will likely welcome the upgrades — particularly business class' sliding doors and easier bathroom access.\n\nThough there are a few asterisks: American said the doors won't be usable for a couple of months, and economy passengers in row 25 should expect a windowless view.\n\nAmerican has abandoned its A321T Flagship First for a single Flagship Business cabin with 20 private pod-like suites.\n\nThere are also 12 premium economy recliners, and 123 regular economy seats. This is down from the 190 on the A321T\n\nAmerican designed the A321XLR to cater to high-paying business and leisure passengers who want added space and comforts at 39,000 feet, and the dated A321T was no longer cutting it.\n\nFitting a suite-style business seat onto a narrowbody jet is a careful game of Tetris to ensure every foot of cabin real-estate is making money.\n\nAnd American packed in a lot: a bed, a large tray table, a Bluetooth-capable screen, a remote control, charging ports, and storage space.\n\nI liked all the amenities and found the cabin to be chic, modern, and spacious overall.\n\nThe A321XLR suites are arranged in a 1x1 layout — a major upgrade from the A321T's 2x2 business configuration that essentially trapped window-seat passengers whenever their neighbor went lie-flat.\n\nNow, every A321XLR business-class passenger gets direct aisle access. The A321T's first class is 1×1.\n\nAmong the biggest comfort requests from premium travelers worldwide is better privacy in business class.\n\nThe A321XLR achieves this with a redesigned layout and sliding doors that give it the feel of a flying mini-hotel.\n\nThe bulkier business seats narrow the cabin's single aisle to the point where there's barely any room to squeeze by another person. That tight space could create bottlenecks near the lavatory or make the aisle impassable during meal service.\n\nAnother caveat: an American spokesperson told Business Insider that the new sliding door can't be used until the airline secures certification for the feature, which they said is expected in the \"coming months.\"\n\nJetBlue Airways offers a two-passenger front-row \"Mint Studio\" on its A321LR (the A321XLR's predecessor). It's a conference-style setup that allows the airline to charge a premium for the extra space.\n\nAmerican's A321XLR lacks this suite, meaning it can't capture the potential extra revenue, but it preserves lucrative cabin real estate.\n\nUnlike the A321T, American's A321XLR will have a dedicated premium economy section.\n\nThe 2×2 cabin features winged recliners, adjustable leg and footrests, elevated food and beverage options, 37 inches of pitch, and an amenity kit. Customers also get priority check-in and boarding.\n\nAlthough the recliners do not offer the same bedroom-like experience as those at the front of the plane, they are sometimes hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars more expensive than coach.\n\nCustomers can expect the standard seatback screen, adjustable headrests, 31-inch pitch seats, and food already offered on American's A321T and most transatlantic flights.\n\nExtra legroom seats make up the first few coach rows and are distinguished by their brown headrests. Standard seats have a blue one.\n\nThe A321T seats have a different color scheme and dated amenities compared to the A321XLR.\n\nI was happy to see that the screens in every cabin, including coach, are Bluetooth-capable. The A321T is not.\n\nI can finally use my AirPods instead of the often scratchy and uncomfortable airline-provided wired headphones.\n\nThere is almost always one row on these new narrowbody planes that does not have a window. On American's A321XLR, that's row 25.\n\nCustomers here will be treated to a wall panel with no outside view — so it may be worth paying extra to avoid these windowless seats.\n\nThough some customers may prefer it for sleeping.",

    "fullText": "Welcome back to our Sunday edition, where we round up some of our top stories and take you inside our newsroom. Burnout is common. For $130,000 a week, this burnout clinic treats CEOs, founders, and ultra-high-net-worth individuals who require discreet and private care. Included: medical treatments, a midday IV, a personal trainer, and a private chef.\n\nBut first: The new wave of leaders is young.\n\nIf this was forwarded to you, Download Business Insider's app here.\n\nForget big lecture halls, dream internships, or comfy full-time jobs.\n\nThere's a growing cohort of young professionals who are approaching their careers differently. They're torching the traditional playbook and doing things their own way in an effort to reshape industries and solve global challenges.\n\nWe've spent the past year interviewing \"young geniuses\" — the next wave of leaders, innovators, and builders who are taking unconventional approaches to work, some as early as high school.\n\nThese folks aren't just making a living, either. They're earning serious dough at a young age by building AI tools, moving fast, and raising money from investors willing to bet big on the AI race.\n\nBusiness Insider spoke to 16 young founders this year who have collectively raised over $100 million. They're under the age of 27. Many are even teenagers.\n\nHere are some of their stories and advice for others.\n\nZach Yadegari sold his first app at 16 and cofounded an AI-powered nutrition app while he was still in high school. It's generating around $30 million annually. \"My advice to anyone would be to get started. Ignore the noise, ignore the people telling you that it's impossible to do it at a young age, and ignore the people trying to push you down a specific path to accomplish your goals.\"\n\nChristine Zhang turned down an internship to spend two months building an AI startup with her college roommate. By the end of the summer, they raised $1 million. She's taking a gap year from Harvard to focus on the startup. \"I had to delete my Instagram during the first week of classes so I wouldn't get FOMO. However, I don't regret my decision, and the feeling of missing out has definitely improved over time.\"\n\nArlan Rakhmetzhanov dropped out of high school to launch an AI coding agent startup that's raised $6.2 million. Both of his parents are entrepreneurs. He taught himself to code and founded his first company at the age of 15. \"Being young gives you a head start. There's still time if you fail, which is why young people try crazy things.\"\n\nAre you a young genius? In awe of what the kids are doing these days? Drop me a line and let me know what you think — srussolillo@businessinsider.com\n\nWhat are the values that define America? Liberty, patriotism — and thievery, as it turns out. From petty shoplifting to return fraud, everyday Americans are becoming small-time scammers.\n\nThey're not stealing from everyone — just the companies they deem big enough to weather the loss, or those they think are making money off their backs. But too much Robin Hood-ing could have unintended consequences for small businesses … and the rest of us who are still paying for things.\n\nWhile much of the broader labor market has been marked by slow hiring, it's also been cushioned by low levels of firing. That's not the case for the tech industry, though.\n\nUS tech companies have announced roughly 154,000 layoffs through November, according to Challenger. That's a 17% increase from the prior year and the most of any private-sector industry. These cuts have fueled fierce competition for roles. BI spoke to more than 20 tech professionals who are struggling to find work.\n\n\"It feels like recruiters are looking for Superman.\"\n\nWhen a jury returned an $11.5 million verdict to a former SHRM employee who sued for racial discrimination, CEO Johnny Taylor sent a clear message: The fight isn't over yet.\n\nIn a video seen by Business Insider, Taylor said the case lacked merit and would go down as \"just a blip in the history of SHRM.\" The company said in a LinkedIn post that it planned to appeal the decision.\n\nWhen Sima Sistani left her role as CEO at WeightWatchers, she called Oprah for advice. She told Sistani to take a year to say no to everything. Now, Sistani is an adjunct professor at Duke University, teaching a course on women's leadership.\n\nFor BI's Power Hours series, Sistani shared what a typical day in her life looks like — from reading a physical newspaper and prepping talking points for her class, to ending the day with a romance fantasy novel.\n\nDaily affirmations and less time on phones.\n\n\"It's a zero-sum game they're losing, and it's only going to get worse.\"\n\n— Doug Shapiro, a media analyst and senior advisor at BCG, on media companies struggling to get people to engage with their content following Disney's deal with OpenAI.\n\nBI rode a Rivian spin-off e-bike around New York City\n\nBike fanatic and BI correspondent Jack Newsham took Also's TM-B e-bike for a spin around the city. Here's what happened.\n\nExclusive: Meta plans price hike for its virtual reality devices, internal memo shows.\n\nThe BI Today team: Steve Russolillo, chief news editor, in New York.

    "description": "Rivian's autonomy chief James Philbin told Business Insider that the cost of lidar, a sensor that can be found in robotaxis, is no longer expensive.",
    "fullText": "For Rivian's chief of autonomy, the decision to put in lidar for the EV company's coming R2 SUV was obvious.\n\nJames Philbin, Rivian's VP of autonomy and AI, told Business Insider that the price of lidar has decreased significantly enough in recent years to be able to put the sensor inside a personally-owned, mass-production vehicle.\n\n\"It's been on this incredible cost curve, where 10 years ago, it would be just unimaginable that you could put a lidar on a consumer vehicle. And now it's getting into that price point, kind of in the range of a radar,\" Philbin said. Radar, a sensor that uses radio waves, is commonly seen in modern cars that have an advanced driver-assistance system (ADAS) or blind spot detection.\n\nLidar is a sensor that uses laser light to measure depth. While it's historically been used for topography, the sensor has gained more visibility in the automotive world with the advent of self-driving cars.\n\nMost notably, Waymo's robotaxis have multiple lidar sensors, including the spinning lidar on the roof of the vehicle. Waymo has said that lidar provides additional safety to the vehicle's AI driver.\n\nOn Thursday, Rivian announced a road map to fully autonomous driving, which includes building an in-house chip and installing a lidar sensor in the company's coming SUV, the R2.\n\nPhilbin, who previously worked at Zoox and Waymo, told Business Insider that lidar makes an autonomous system \"more robust\" and can help the company get to its self-driving goal \"faster.\"\n\n\"It's very affordable,\" he said. \"The performance it gives you for that cost is really amazing. And so to me, it's kind of a no-brainer that you would want more sensors and more modalities for something that's so safety critical.\"\n\nUsing lidar diverges from the strategy of Rivian's main EV competitor, Tesla, which has taken a strong stance on pursuing self-driving with cameras only.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk once called lidar an expensive \"crutch.\"\n\nIn the late 2000s, during the days of the Google Self-Driving Car Project, a single lidar unit could come with a five-figure price tag. Today, industry leaders say a similar unit could cost a few hundred dollars.\n\nRivian employees, including Philbin, did not disclose the cost of the lidar unit in the R2 when asked by Business Insider.\n\nR2 will first be launched without the sensor in early 2026. It's slated to be Rivian's cheapest car to date, with a starting price of $45,000. The company aims to launch an R2 with lidar in late 2026.\n\nWhen asked what the cost difference was to put a lidar in the R2, Philbin declined to comment but said that it was \"not a significant consideration.\"",
