    "fullText": "The founder of the bubble tea brand Gong Cha said he had a novel idea to get his first patrons through the door.\n\nIn an interview with CNBC, Martin Berry, the founder and chairman of Gong Cha group, spoke about how he came across one of the chain's outlets in Singapore before it became a global boba behemoth.\n\nBerry said he and his wife pooled $2.5 million of their savings to open the first five Gong Cha franchise stores in South Korea, a venture he said was \"quite terrifying.\"\n\nBerry quit his banking job to go all in on bubble tea. To get his first customers in Seoul, he decided to get Starbucks' help.\n\n\"So my strategy was, I'm going to put a Gong Cha — the first five stores — next to Starbucks,\" Berry told CNBC. \"And if I can get one in a hundred people who are going into Starbucks to come and try a Gong Cha, then I've got a business.\"\n\nGong Cha was founded in Taiwan in 1996 by Wu Zhenhua, and Berry entered the business in 2011 to expand the brand to South Korea and other countries. As of January, the chain had about 2,200 stores in 33 countries, including the US and Canada.\n\nThe chain is known for its fragrant, fruity teas and its milk foam topping.\n\nBubble tea brands have seen large success in recent years, with several making splashy IPOs.\n\nMixue, the world's largest fast-food chain that sells cheap bubble tea and ice cream, has more than 45,000 stores worldwide and just opened its first outlet in New York City at the start of the year. It went public in Hong Kong last March, with its stock jumping 30% from its IPO price at market open.\n\nOther Asian beverage brands, like Luckin Coffee, have positioned themselves as Starbucks' rivals, offering similar drinks at lower prices. Luckin Coffee expanded to the US last year, with several outlets in NYC.",

    "description": "In this Sunday edition of Business Insider Today, we're talking about how going to Disneyland has gotten so expensive.",
    "fullText": "My wife and I are about to take our two kids to Disneyland … and I'm absolutely terrified.\n\nNot because I don't want to go. My nearly 3-year-old carries his Mickey Mouse stuffie everywhere. He sleeps with it. Eats with it. When he sees Mickey in real life, he'll lose it. I can't wait for that.\n\nHere's the problem: I'm really worried about how much it's going to cost. The price of visiting Disney — and competing amusement parks — has been rising for years. But the upper end of what it can cost, depending on the experience you want, has entered rarefied air.\n\nIn a recent Business Insider documentary, we dug into Disney's history to better understand the real reason the Mouse House has gotten so expensive. When Disneyland opened in 1955, admission was basically pocket change. Back then, it cost 50 cents for a child and $1 an adult, to get in, or $6 and $12, respectively, in today's dollars adjusted for inflation. Going on the rides cost more.\n\nToday, admission plus rides can run close to $200 a day, although the lower tiers are cheaper. Then there's the food. The merchandise. Not to mention the enormous crowds and the endless lines if you don't pay for a line-jumping pass. The happiest place on Earth? My wallet might disagree.\n\nDisney parks have been a bright spot for the company post-COVID under the stewardship of parks czar Josh D'Amaro. He is set to succeed Bob Iger as CEO.\n\nThe question now is whether Disney diehards start to change course.\n\nOne hardcore Disney fan who still visits multiple times a year told us she's cut back on extras and avoids premium shortcuts or add-ons.\n\nAnother family dropped nearly $10,000 on Disney World and came home with a list of what they'd cut next time.\n\nThere are Disney-specific budgeting stories, too, showing how families save on tickets, food, and hotels. I'm taking notes.\n\nMy real fear isn't the credit-card bill. What if my kids love it? What if they beg to go back? What if this trip becomes such a core memory — priceless, one might say — that they measure other vacations against it?\n\nWhat are your best Disney tricks and hacks? I'd love to hear from you at srussolillo@businessinisider.com.",

    "description": "In this Saturday edition of Business Insider Today, we're talking about the booming mini economy of public breakups.",
    "fullText": "I know, I know, it's Valentine's Day, so who wants to read about breakups? Hear me out. Today isn't just about love; it's about every part of a relationship — the meet-cute, the intoxicating limerence, and even splitting up over soup. Meet the breakup economy.\n\nBusiness Insider's Juliana Kaplan writes about how breaking up in public is still a thing, and many are choosing restaurants, bars, and coffee shops to do the deed. It's not only affecting the two people sitting at the table. Waitstaff are also taking notice and trying their best to navigate what happens when someone suddenly leaves the table.\n\nChef Gabrielle Macafee encountered this exact scenario when she worked at a Brooklyn restaurant serving a small tasting menu. After a couple walked in looking \"morose,\" the man stood up and left halfway through the $130 meal.\n\n\"My teammates and I were like, wait, how do we handle this? He's gone. You can only hold the food for so long,\" Macafee told BI's Kaplan, who added that the woman still seated paid for both meals. \"We offered to send her the rest, but obviously, she just wanted to get out of there as soon as possible.\"\n\nIf you do find yourself giving the \"it's not you, it's me\" speech in public, dating coach Julie Nguyen advised picking a neutral spot, such as a park, and avoiding regular haunts you both frequent. \"You don't want either of you to feel dread going back, or tie bad memories to a spot they love. A neutral, quiet outdoor setting is the best play,\" she added.\n\nLane Denbro, a former line cook, said that if you're not in total shock at what's happening, be thoughtful of the staff, the servers, and the bartenders. \"If you're going through a breakup, make sure to tip well, because the service staff in the back of house, we're going to try to support you however we can,\" Denbro said.",

    "description": "Joe Fenti, a former Big Four consultant, quit his job to become a full-time content creator and makes videos mocking corporate culture.",
    "fullText": "It's a scene many office workers would recognize — a consultant arguing with their boss about how they should be logging, or not logging, the hours they're putting in, using insider language like daily \"touch points\" and charging the \"client code.\" \n\nEventually, the boss slips up.\n\n\"We just don't want your utilization to get too high so we have a reason to lay you off when it comes to layoff season,\" the boss says. \"Oh, wait. I said the quiet part out loud.\"\n\nThe scene — \"Timesheets In Consulting Make No Sense\" — is actually a comedy sketch, one of the most viewed videos on Joe Fenti's Instagram account. It's racked up 1.8 million views and hundreds of comments from users who say they can relate.\n\nFenti, a 29-year-old in Boston, is also saying the quiet part out loud, depicting the frustrations that are all too common in corporate America but often go unacknowledged.\n\nThey're situations he knows firsthand: Before becoming a full-time content creator and stand-up comedian, Fenti spent five years as a consultant at a Big Four firm.\n\n\"I found myself doing a lot of repetitive work and just noticing a lot of silliness in the workday,\" Fenti told Business Insider.\n\nWhen he started posting videos online, the ones mocking corporate culture resonated the most, and not just with fellow consultants but also with folks in other fields like accounting, investment banking, and private equity.\n\n\"Wow, this is such a universal experience,\" he realized. \"Corporate is corporate is corporate.\"\n\nLampooning professional services firms comes with a large potential audience, as the Big Four — Deloitte, EY, PwC, and KPMG — collectively employ 1.5 million people.\n\nA post shared by Joe Fenti (@fentifriedchicken)\n\nFenti started working as a consultant in 2019. Little frustrations quickly started piling up, like having to write emails for his boss to a client, but the boss knew everything that needed to be in the email, so he had to ask the boss what to write. \"The whole time I'm thinking, 'This would be so much faster if you just did this,'\" he said.\n\nWhen he began posting videos around the spring of 2021, the ones about work were taking off, so he started posting more frequently. Since around 2023, he's been posting six videos a week, and for much of that time, he also had his full-time consulting job.\n\n\"I really was maximizing every minute of my day just to make this content and comedy thing work,\" he said. He'd write his scripts during the day on a notepad so he could film immediately when he got home. He'd edit his videos while on the bus to work or to a stand-up comedy show.\n\nFenti said he always loved comedy, but never imagined it could be something he actually did for a job. He remembers saying to his friend when he first started, \"If I even make a dollar doing this, it'll be a good adventure.\"\n\nWhile he makes most of his income from content, he also travels for stand-up comedy shows and plans to do more of that. He also recently recorded a 60-minute special that should be coming out this spring.\n\nEven as a content creator, it's hard to escape the realities of corporate culture. He's had brands approve a script only to ask for edits once the video was already done. But he loves being his own boss and setting his own schedule.\n\nNow that he's left the corporate world, he can't imagine ever going back. \"I love not having to get anything approved,\" he said. \"It's whatever I think is funny.\"\n\nWhile his comedy goes beyond mere mockery of corporate culture, it's a topic that continues to resonate. A year out from his consulting job, he said he still has no shortage of ideas for jokes about work.\n\nFans come up to him after shows and tell him his videos helped them get through a hard time or an especially annoying project. He thinks people want to see their world reflected back at them, and that they appreciate seeing the frustrations they're experiencing actually be acknowledged.\n\n\"People want their lives to be seen and understood,\" he said. \"When you have a humor page about it, that's really the most understanding you can get.\"\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "James Eagle founded UK artisan brand The Pished Fish in 2014 and is known for its booze-infused, Scandinavian style smoked salmon.",
    "fullText": "As a medical devices salesman, James Eagle travelled across Scandinavia and would frequently be met with salmon or gravlax as “the main event” on menus.\n\nBack in the UK, he felt that thinly-cut smoked salmon was a sidenote on our plates. “I always thought that was a shame,” says Eagle.\n\nRedundancy from his sales job in 2013 allowed Eagle to start a smokehouse from a small shed at the bottom of his garden in Camberwell, London, which turned from a hobby into the birth of his artisan brand – The Pished Fish.\n\n“In the UK, when you get a smoked salmon and cream cheese bagel, it’s the cream cheese and bagel you can taste,” adds Eagle. “How I likened it is with wafer-thin smoked salmon almost melting into the bagel.”\n\nEagle, who didn’t complete university, worked for drum and bass label Good Looking Records in the early 2000s and was PA to musician LTJ Bukem before turning to a career in sales.\n\nHowever, being laid off at the medical devices firm left a “sour taste” and taught him a lesson in \"how to look after my own staff now.”\n\nIn late 2014, Eagle ventured to farmers' markets with homemade smoked salmon made in what he describes as a “glorified filing cabinet” smoker. He would start at 1am for the laborious 16-hour process.\n\nHe produced three different flavours, sold out every weekend and it gave Eagle the confidence that a more lucrative business was in the offing.\n\nThe Pished Fish’s USP is using botanicals and alcohol – hence the fun company name – such as whisky, aquavit and vodka to flavour its booze-infused, Scandinavian-style smoked salmon. “The ones which I thought were more fun were done with alcohol,” he recalls of his early smokehouse testing.\n\nAfter meeting his now wife, Hermione, through dating site My Single Friend, the couple had attended a course on how to start a food business. Eagle’s main takeaway was not to rely on the product but to have a compelling brand.\n\nHe spent £4,000 on a design and logo. “Having someone to properly imagine what it could be was really important,” he says. “I felt it was an awful amount of money at the time, but it was the best money you could spend.”\n\nWhen a fishmonger at Selfridges later spotted the brand, the Eagles moved to East Sussex and went full-time to upscale the business. The start-up was housed on his father’s land near the Sussex Downs, at first in two shipping containers before moving to an adjacent building where Eagle today employs eight full-time staff.",

    "description": "As someone who travels with Amtrak often, I think the café car is the best seat to choose on a train because it's spacious and comfortable.",
    "fullText": "A few times a year, I take Amtrak trains to travel to destinations along the East Coast. I've found it's an efficient way to travel between Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C., especially when I'm looking to avoid rush hour traffic in those cities.\n\nI've traveled in coach and the quiet car — and have even paid premium prices for business-class seats. But in my opinion, the best spot on the train isn't in any of these spots. In fact, it doesn't even require a special ticket.\n\nAlthough not available on every Amtrak train, the café car is my favorite place to sit. The best part is that I'm able to come and go at my leisure, since the car is open to all ticketed passengers on the train.\n\nI also think it has a number of advantages over the coach and even business-class sections. For example, the first-come, first-served table seating gives me plenty of space to comfortably set up my laptop and notebook so I can get some work done on the train. There's also plenty of legroom, which is a nice bonus.\n\nEach table can seat up to four passengers, but sometimes, I get lucky and have the whole space to myself.\n\nTypically, though, I end up sharing a table with one other person, which is nice because I can ask them to keep an eye on my things while I use the restroom or stretch my legs.\n\nPlus, this car is a nice option when I'm traveling with groups of friends, so we can comfortably chat at side-by-side tables.\n\nI typically enjoy a full meal at home before a train trip, but it's nice to know that I have plenty of options when I'm riding in the café car.\n\nAlthough menus may vary by route, most include breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snack items for purchase. I've seen everything from breakfast sandwiches and pastries to salads and cheeseburgers on board. There's also a selection of soft drinks, coffee, tea, and alcoholic beverages.\n\nOn a recent trip, I bought a vanilla yogurt parfait with granola and berries, and a plate of cheese and crackers.\n\nOf course, life in the café car isn't always perfect. For example, I've found that people can be more chatty in this part of the train, whether they're engaged in conversations with tablemates or having a loud phone conversation.\n\nAs a writer who likes to get work done on the train, I mitigate this issue by wearing noise-canceling headphones.\n\nPlus, seats are limited in this car, and I'm not always guaranteed to get a spot.\n\nOverall, though, I've found the café car to be the best spot on the train and would recommend it to anyone who likes a little extra space without the price of a premium seat.\n\nThis story was originally published on October 28, 2025, and most recently updated on February 13, 2026.",

    "description": "A Ms. Maine winner explains how modern pageants have evolved and how winning the title helped her business while raising two children.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Kristan Vermeulen, the founder of Makers of the USA podcast and community. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI won the United States of America Pageants' Ms. Maine title in 2025. This was not a competition like \"Miss Congeniality.\" There was no pulling of hair between us. It's more about the camaraderie and understanding what these women are going through, and how we can all support each other.\n\nHere's what I learned during my tenure.\n\nHistorically, most pageant systems were restricted to unmarried women aged 18 to 28 with no children. Over the past five years, many systems across the US have expanded requirements to include more women. This shift isn't unique to my pageant organization, but a broader trend within the industry.\n\nAnother example: our pageant system was really positive when it came to physical attributes; we had a lot of women with tattoos. There was even a woman in my category who was in her mid-50s.\n\nIn my pageant, the interview portion accounted for most of my score. Pageantry offers a platform to pursue a new hobby or amplify an existing passion. Every contestant represents a platform or nonprofit.\n\nFollowing my divorce, I was in a period of self-discovery. Competing for and winning Ms. Maine while raising two children and navigating a new career path was a significant undertaking, but I wanted to show my children that their mother is powerful and capable of achieving anything — including winning a title at age 35 and walking across a stage in a bikini.\n\nI took it seriously. I even hired a walking coach in Brussels — I was getting up at 2 a.m. to practice while the kids were sleeping. I knew I wanted to win.\n\nThe pageant allowed me to amplify my maker brand. I have a podcast and storytelling platform called Makers of the USA, where I tell stories about American-made brands. I wanted to demonstrate how to shop local and support small brands in a big showcase. I had Maine-based Luxe by Dorcass and Angelrox make my gowns and patriotic wear bodysuit, for example. The former Mrs. United States of America reached out after my pageant and said she wanted to buy the gown I wore because it was so unique.\n\nThese relationships also helped me identify challenges within the maker community. I learned that Maine makers needed more visibility across all creative industries, which led me to work with my State Rep. to officially designate October as \"Maine Makers Month.\" We launched this past October with an event involving state reps, press, and the maker community.\n\nThere is a monetary prize, but the biggest thing I got from it was opportunities. I really took advantage of being Ms. Maine, even though I knew people might make fun of me. I'm currently discussing making my podcast into a television show, for example.\n\nWinning Ms. Maine helped my business. There has been a small negative, though. I'm a working professional, and I've decided to take my title off my professional online presence. People still have misconceptions about pageants, and that's not how I want to be perceived professionally.",

    "fullText": "The January transfer window in Germany might have closed on February 2 (ironic, is it not?) but other transfer windows remained open past that date. Ergo there were still some outgoings at Bayern Munich as well as a very late confirmation of an incoming signing. Here is the list of the final transfer activity of the 2026 January transfer window at the Bayern Campus:\n\nMax Mergner- permanent transfer to Austria Vienna, as captured by @iMiaSanMia_GER\n\nMax Mergner lined up for Bayern’s U-23s in the first half of the 2025/26 season but lost his pre-season to an ankle injury. Even when the 19-year-old midfielder came back from this injury, he played just 124 minutes in total for the team. A change was in order and it arrived through a permanent transfer to Austrian Bundesliga side Austria Vienna.\n\nDavid Emmanuel- loan to KSV Hessen Kassel cut short, as captured by @iMiaSanMia_GER\n\n19-year-old defensive midfielder David Emmanuel was loaned out to KSV Hessen Kassel back in the January transfer window of 2025. However, he only played 5 minutes the rest of the season for the team in the Regionalliga Südwest, one of the 5 different regional fourth divisions in Germany. There was hope he would be able to push his way into the picture a little more following a pre-season and further acclimatization at the club, but he only played 1 minute in the first half of the 2025/26 season. Seeing no future at Hessen Kassel for Emmanuel, Bayern broke off the loan and brought him back to the club. He is eligible for either the U-19s or the U-23s and it will be interesting to see which team he will join.\n\nAllan Bohomo- New signing as a free agent, as captured by @iMiaSanMia_GER\n\n17-year-old center back Allan Bohomo joins Bayern’s U-19s as a free agent. 6 months after his contract at RB Leipzig ended, the 1.93 meter tall Bohomo joins Bayern to bolster the defensive ranks.",

    "description": "The sharpest minds in business and tech are responding to a viral essay on AI's impact on jobs with some approval and a lot of skepticism.",
    "fullText": "Scientists and business leaders are responding to a viral essay warning of AI's impact on jobs with a mix of agreement and skepticism.\n\nThe essay, titled \"Something Big is Coming,\" written by cofounder and CEO of OthersideAI, Matt Shumer, has racked up more than 60 million views on X as of Thursday.\n\nIn the 5,000-word post, Shumer said that AI could upend daily life on a scale \"much bigger\" than COVID, a comparison which drew pushback online. He wrote that the changes already unfolding in the tech sector are likely a preview of disruptions that could soon reach other industries as well.\n\n\"Even if there is a 20% chance of this happening, people deserve to know and have time to prepare,\" Shumer told Business Insider's Brent Griffiths in an interview.\n\nHere's what some of the sharpest minds in AI are saying about Shumer's essay.\n\nHaber, a general partner at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz specializing in technology investments, posted on X that Shumer's essay contains \"great advice for how to get ahead in your job at any large company right now.\"\n\n\"'I used AI to do this analysis in an hour instead of three days is going to be the most valuable person in the room.' Not eventually. Right now,\" Haber quotes from the essay. \"Learn these tools. Get proficient. Demonstrate what's possible.\"\n\nThe Reddit founder responded to Shumer's initial post on X with a simple comment: \"Great writeup. Strongly agree.\"\n\nSince 2023, Reddit has introduced a range of AI-driven tools, from search features that summarize user discussions to AI that sharpens its content recommendations and targets ads, but Ohanian recently emphasized that the platform must retain its humanity to stay competitive.\n\nMarkowitz, the author and managing partner and director of research at Nightview Capital, a long-term-oriented investment firm, responded to Schumer with an essay almost as long, which criticized the practice of chasing speed and replacing the value of humanity simply because it could be done.\n\n\"These two worlds — Wall Street and Silicon Valley — have formed a feedback loop of short-termism so tight, so self-reinforcing, that they've confused efficiency with purpose, growth with meaning, and the elimination of people with progress,\" wrote Markowitz.\n\n\"I have two research assistants. Could I replace them with AI? Of course. But their value extends their weekly output,\" Markowitz added. \"They give meaning to my work and I love seeing the excitement in their faces when they make a new discovery that I, alone, could not have found.\"\n\n\"Let me say it again: we are not our tools. We never have been,\" Markowitz wrote in conclusion.\n\nMcLees, the founder of HumanSkills.AI, wrote on X that Shumer is not wrong, but he said that the advice Shumer provided is akin to \"telling someone the floodwaters are rising and handing them a better bucket.\"\n\n\"As AI grows in ability, our role in defining direction, values, and purpose only becomes more essential,\" McLees said.\n\n\"What do you bring when the machine can do the work? That's the only question that matters when intelligence is abundant,\" McLees added. \"Shumer wrote the alarm. It's a good one. But alarms don't tell you where to go. You have to find that within yourself.\"\n\nMarcus, Emeritus Professor of Psychology and Neural Science at NYU and founder of AI companies Robust.AI, has some harsh words for Schumer in his newsletter.\n\nMarcuz called Shumer's blog post \"weaponized hype, filled with vivid narrative and marketing speech,\" and said he did not provide real data to support the claim that the latest AI can write complicated apps without mistakes.\n\n\"Shumer's presentation is completely one-sided, omitting lots of concerns that have been widely expressed here and elsewhere,\" Marcus added, after discussing various studies that question the accuracy and productivity gain AI tools actually provide.\n\nMisra, Vice Dean of Computing and Artificial Intelligence at Columbia University, responded in a lengthy Substack article that detailed why he doesn't think AI is as scary as it sounds, at least not right now.\n\nMisra wrote that many strange AI behaviors that make them seem sentient, such as perceived resistance and self-preservation, are simply a result of training data.\n\nAs for the possible elimination of jobs, Misra said he understands the anxiety, but history says we may not need to panic.\n\n\"When the camera was invented, portrait painters had every reason to panic. Their livelihood depended on a skill that a machine could now approximate,\" Misra wrote.\n\n\"What happened? Painters didn't disappear. They were freed from the obligation to faithfully reproduce reality and ventured into impressionism, cubism, abstract expressionism,\" Misra added. \"The camera didn't kill painting. It liberated it.\"",

    "description": "AI's next phase will shift from Nvidia and cloud leaders to large incumbent companies adopting the technology to boost profits and cut costs.",
    "fullText": "Investors are growing jittery about a potential bubble in artificial intelligence stocks, but the real payoff may be just beginning — and it could extend well beyond Silicon Valley's usual winners, a $19 billion hedge fund investor said.\n\n\"This is a generational platform shift. We are in probably the third or fourth inning of the actual build out,\" David Craver, the co-chief investment officer of Lone Pine Capital, said on Goldman Sachs' \"Exchanges\" podcast published Thursday.\n\nCraver added that while he understands concerns surrounding the vast sums of money being spent on AI, the underlying signals — improving models, tight capacity, and real-world business impact — suggest the cycle still has room to run.\n\nHe points to three signals that keep him bullish on AI infrastructure.\n\nFirst, the models are still improving as more computing power is thrown at them. \"They are absolutely getting better,\" and have more uses, he said.\n\nSecond, demand continues to outstrip supply as hyperscalers and inference providers still lack sufficient capacity, he said.\n\nThird — and most important — companies are already seeing dramatic returns from deploying AI internally.\n\nHe said founders and digital-first CEOs are describing \"mind-blowing\" productivity gains, from automated coding to replacing manual workflows with AI agents.\n\n\"We have had numerous CEOs say to us, 'I think I can triple or more the revenues in my business. And I'm never going to have to hire another human being,'\" Craver said.\n\nStill, not every company is seeing those kinds of returns on investment. According to PwC's latest Global CEO Survey, released last month, 56% of the 4,454 chief executives surveyed said AI has yet to deliver revenue or cost benefits for their businesses.\n\nEarly AI gains have gone primarily to infrastructure leaders like Nvidia and cloud providers. Craver thinks the next phase will be defined by adoption across large, incumbent companies.\n\n\"I have a theme that I call 'revenge of the dinosaurs,' which is, larger companies are going to adopt this technology and take cost out of their business in a huge way over the next two and three and four years,\" he said.\n\nHe said the impact would show up clearly in corporate earnings.\n\n\"I think we're going to get on conference calls in 2027, and CFOs are going to say, 'I just took half a billion dollars out of my spending on an annual basis because we're implementing this new technology,'\" he said.\n\nThat dynamic, in his view, is \"super bullish for the market.\"\n\nCraver's comments come at a fragile moment for AI-linked stocks, as investors grow more nervous after a blistering multi-year run.\n\nThis week, software stocks sold off as investors weighed the disruptive impact of AI against concerns about elevated valuations, aggressive capital spending, and whether the buildout has outpaced fundamentals.\n\nMeanwhile, shares of insurance brokerages, wealth managers, and real estate services firms — sectors seen as exposed to AI disruption — have fallen sharply.\n\nDespite the volatility, Craver said Lone Pine remains \"quite bullish on that overall bet\" on AI.\n\n\"It's not a bubble when everybody thinks it's a bubble,\" he said. \"It's going to be a bubble when we get to the other side of this.\"",

    "fullText": "JPMorgan is consolidating power to move faster on AI.\n\nThe bank is reshuffling its commercial and investment bank to \"maximize the impact of AI,\" according to an internal memo seen by Business Insider that was sent this week.\n\nThe firm has named Guy Halamish as the chief operating officer of the CIB and tasked him with overseeing the ongoing effort to \"harness the power of our data and fully leverage rapidly evolving AI capabilities,\" the memo, signed by the CIB's co-CEOs, Doug Petno and Troy Rohrbaugh, said. Halamish's new role was first reported by Bloomberg.\n\nUnder the new structure, each major business in the division, including banking, markets, payments, and securities services, will have its own chief data and analytics officer reporting jointly to Halamish and business heads. The bank recently hired Zachery Anderson as the chief data and analytics officer of its payments division, after a nearly six-year stint at UK-based lender NatWest. In a LinkedIn post about the new job, Anderson said he wants to push the \"edge of the possible with AI.\"\n\nThe move is part of a new strategy to break silos across the unit and speed up adoption of AI.\n\nThe team of officers will work with the wider firm on a range of efforts, including \"preparing our infrastructure for more advanced AI and the expanded use of AI agents\" and \"driving end-to-end transformation\" in areas such as client onboarding.\n\nThe CIB is a huge profit driver for JPMorgan — in 2024, it generated $25 billion in net income out of a firmwide total of $58.5 billion, according to that year's annual report.\n\nJPMorgan, backed last year by an approximately $18 billion tech budget, is one of the financial industry's leaders in AI, with its own proprietary genAI platform and additional tools in the pipeline. CEO Jamie Dimon defended the firm's AI spending on a recent earnings call.\n\n\"We are going to stay out front, so help us God,\" Dimon said about the spending.\n\nWork at JPMorgan or have a tip?

    "fullText": "Vybe, the startup cofounded by two repeat Y Combinator entrepreneurs, has raised $10 million to bring vibe coding inside large companies.\n\nThe practice of vibe coding has become more widespread as it allows people to use AI and natural language prompts to build an app, rather than traditional programming. The sector has attracted hundreds of millions in venture funding and is blurring the lines for businesses deciding between buying software or just vibe-coding their own tools.\n\nWhile popular vibe-coding products like Lovable and Replit have made it easy for companies to create prototypes and landing pages, Vybe offers stronger security that cannot be modified by AI and also taps into internal data systems, said cofounder and CEO Quang Hoang.\n\nHoang previously founded the engineering mentorship platform Plato and is building Vybe alongside cofounder and CTO Fabien Devos, founder of the security AI startup Wolfia.\n\nVybe lets teams across an organization collaborate on apps. Engineering teams manage access to internal systems like Salesforce, Snowflake, and Databricks, while business teams can build apps for onboarding, performance reviews, customer service, and more.\n\n\"The new SaaS is going to be more like Legos,\" Hoang said, referring to software-as-a-service. \"You can build it exactly how you want.\"\n\nVybe also offers app templates created by high-profile executives, such as former Airbnb product leader Lenny Rachitsky and Front cofounder Mathilde Collin, that users can \"remix\" to suit their needs, including templates for performance reviews and one-on-one meetings.\n\nFirst Round Capital led Vybe's seed round, which featured participation from Y Combinator, the CEOs of Datadog and Grammarly, and product leaders from OpenAI and Meta.\n\nVybe has six employees and dozens of customers, Hoang said. It plans to use the funding to hire engineers. Vybe charges $12 per user a month, plus usage-based credits for app development.\n\nThe round comes as vibe coding continues to attract major funding — with startups like Emergent pulling in tens of millions from Khosla Ventures and SoftBank — even as Barclays analysts warn the initial boom may be cooling.\n\nAt the same time, investors are also weighing how AI and vibe-coding tools can reshape the software sector. Software stocks have entered one of their sharpest downturns in years, shedding roughly $2 trillion in market capitalization.\n\nHere's a look at the pitch deck Vybe used to raise its $10 million seed round.

    "description": "A security source told Business Insider that the drones struck a refinery in Russia's Komi Republic on Thursday.",
    "fullText": "Ukrainian long-range drones struck an oil refinery nearly 1,100 miles into Russia, marking one of Kyiv's deepest strikes of the war, a security official told Business Insider on Thursday.\n\nThe drones struck the Ukhta refinery in Russia's Komi Republic, a source in the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) said. They were only authorized to speak on the condition of anonymity to discuss military developments.\n\nThe source said the targeted refinery is located 1,750 kilometers (1,087 miles) from the Ukrainian border, in what was Kyiv's latest strike on Russian energy infrastructure.\n\nThe attack on Thursday triggered a fire at the refinery. Plumes of smoke are visible in footage of the facility shared by the SBU source. One video shows what appears to be a large Ukrainian drone streaming across the sky. Business Insider could not independently verify the imagery.\n\nThe refinery is part of Russia's state-owned PJSC Lukoil Oil Company, and it processes about 4 million tons of oil annually. The General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, which confirmed the attack, said the facility supplies Moscow's military.\n\nThe General Staff wrote on the Telegram messaging platform that \"other components\" of Ukraine's defense forces were involved in the attack.\n\n\"The SBU continues to carry out targeted strikes on the enterprises of the Russian oil refining complex, which ensure the functioning of the military machine of the aggressor country,\" the security service source said in a translated statement.\n\nHitting such targets \"reduces the enemy's ability to provide their troops with fuel, complicates logistics, and reduces financial revenues that go to the war against Ukraine,\" they said.\n\nRussia's defense ministry said that it shot down 211 fixed-wing Ukrainian drones over the past 24 hours, but it did not specify where. Neither the ministry nor the country's embassy in the US immediately responded to a request for comment.\n\nSince August, Ukraine has intensified its long-range drone attacks on Russian energy facilities, hitting oil and gas infrastructure on land, such as refineries and ports, as well as tankers and platforms in the Black, Caspian, and Mediterranean seas.\n\nUkrainian officials have described the campaign targeting Russia's energy sector as \"long-range\" sanctions on Moscow, which uses the revenue from this industry to fuel its full-scale invasion.\n\nYehor Cherniev, deputy chairman of the Ukrainian parliamentary committee on national security, defense, and intelligence, told Business Insider earlier this week that striking the Russian energy sector has been \"one of the best decisions\" because \"it is painful for them.\"\n\n\"I think that's why they have a problem in their economy and with the financing of the war, actually, of their armed forces,\" he said. \"We have to continue to do this.\"\n\nThe Ukrainian deep strikes have affected Russia's oil sector. Refining has declined over the past year; Moscow processed 5.3 million barrels a day last month, compared with the 5.6 million barrels it usually processes in January, according to a Bloomberg report.\n\nMeanwhile, Russia has stepped up its missile and drone barrages on Ukrainian energy infrastructure this winter, causing blackouts in cities around the country and leaving civilians without heat, electricity, and water.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Thursday that Russia used 219 drones and 25 missiles to attack the country during the previous night, killing multiple people in an attack primarily aimed at energy infrastructure in Kyiv and other cities.\n\nUnited Nations officials have called this winter Ukraine's coldest in over a decade.",

    "description": "Solopreneurs like Katrina Purcell and Gigi Robinson use AI tools to optimize their content creation, boost efficiency, and enhance lead generation.",
    "fullText": "These days, content creation can feel like a full-time job. For solopreneurs running podcasts or active social channels alongside client work, maintaining a consistent presence can be hard to manage without any teammates.\n\n\"I would not be doing this level of content if I didn't have AI,\" said Katrina Purcell, Fractional COO and host of the Managed Chaos podcast. Purcell produces a weekly podcast and publishes related content across LinkedIn, Substack, and a blog on her website. AI tools like Riverside for transcripts and Gemini for content ideation and creation make it possible, she said.\n\nHere are the specific ways Purcell and two other solopreneurs have integrated AI into their processes to make content creation more seamless.\n\n\"I've never really thought of myself as a content-generating creative person,\" Purcell told Business Insider.\n\nBefore generative AI, she struggled to identify which content from her podcast would perform well on different platforms and often took the \"lazy route\" and simply published the same copy everywhere.\n\nNow, she's trained a custom Gem on Gemini to support her in creating content tailored to different platforms.\n\n\"I gave it the brand guidelines for the podcast, told it that it was adept at SEO, that it knew all the latest content trends, and then I asked it to start coming up with content based on the transcripts,\" she said. Prompts she uses include:\n\nShe'll do some light tweaks and editing, but the AI does most of the heavy lifting.\n\nRecently, she wrote a Substack post based on a podcast episode using this process, and a reader reached out to say how valuable the post was for them, and asked how long it took her. She had to admit it didn't take her long at all, thanks to AI.\n\nPurcell added that she's continually training this Gem on new information about her goals and audience, and always \"closes the content loop\" by telling it how different posts performed.\n\nFor Gigi Robinson, who's been a social media creator since college and now runs a consultancy called Hosts of Influence to help other creators with their brands, creativity was never the bottleneck — it was going from an idea to a finished post.\n\nRather than getting in her head about optimizing every aspect of a post, AI helps her get it done rather than focusing on perfection.\n\nFor instance, she's been able to create LinkedIn videos based on trending news stories quickly. She'll copy and paste parts of a trending article she likes into ChatGPT and ask it to generate specific talking points in her brand voice. From there, she can quickly ad-lib a video without needing to script something out herself. This approach helped her get over 100 million impressions on LinkedIn in just 90 days last year (confirmed from a tracking document viewed by Business Insider) and led to more inbound brand deals from LinkedIn.\n\nRobinson has also found AI video editing tools like Adobe Premiere and OpusClip valuable for a first round of edits. She and her contract interns still make nitpicky tweaks, but it takes much less time than doing everything manually.\n\n\"Before, video editing could take hours. With these tools, getting a cut of the video finalized for posting is usually done in under an hour,\" Robinson said.\n\nEsosa Edosomwan, the coach and nutrition specialist behind The Raw Girl and UMI, still prefers to keep her content creation process largely human-driven after experimenting with AI video and finding her audience doesn't respond to it.\n\nOutside of small things like using Claude to optimize social captions or Nano Banana for video thumbnails, the biggest benefit of AI has been helping her turn social media followers into customers. When she had a piece of content go viral on Instagram early last year, the flood of DMs became impossible to keep up with.\n\nFor help, she turned to the AI tool Manychat. In addition to the automations that send lead magnets — free resources in exchange for contact info — when followers message call-to-action phrases like \"workshop\" or \"hormones,\" she's trained the bot to respond to other messages with her brand and voice, keeping the conversation going.\n\n\"I have even had a couple times where friends thought it was me before realizing it was my chatbot,\" she said. \"That has really helped with inbound leads.\"",

    "fullText": "Nate Diaz has fuelled talk of a UFC comeback after declaring he has unfinished business.\n\nThe veteran fighter sparked fresh speculation with a message on X referencing the BMF belt that was first introduced for his fight in 2019.\n\nHis post arrives as the symbolic title continues to feature in headline bouts inside the promotion.\n\nThe BMF championship was created for Diaz’s clash with Jorge Masvidal at UFC 244, a fight that ended via doctor stoppage due to cuts.\n\nDespite the loss, the belt became a recurring feature in high-profile matchups. In his recent post, Diaz reiterated his belief that he launched the concept.\n\n“Let’s not act like I didn’t start a whole division bringing value to all these guys claiming they’re it. I gave opportunity and put notice on the dopest fights I got unfinished business, and I plan on going and taking what’s mine ASAP.”\n\n“First to ever start a division and the dopest one at that. You’re welcome, m————. I’ll see you soon, I’m coming.”\n\nThe message circulated rapidly, adding to ongoing debate about a potential return to the Octagon.\n\nThe BMF belt is currently set to be defended by Max Holloway against Charles Oliveira at UFC 326. Diaz has not fought in the UFC since his contract concluded following a win over Tony Ferguson.\n\nHe has since competed in boxing, including a rematch victory over Masvidal. Dana White has previously indicated Diaz would be welcome back should he decide to rejoin the organisation.\n\nWith his latest statement signalling intent, attention now shifts to whether Diaz will act on his vow to settle unfinished business inside the cage.\n\nConor McGregor vs. Nate Diaz rivalry massively changed Nick Diaz’s life\n\nJon Jones shares honest take on Nate Diaz, dismissing his ‘gangster’ image\n\nNate Diaz slammed as ‘delusional’ for targeting surprising name in UFC return bid",

    "title": "The booming business of public breakups",
    "description": "From fancy tasting menus to bars, restaurant workers have overheard their fair shares of public breakups. Here's what they think of yours.",
    "fullText": "From Lane Denbro's vantage point in the open kitchen of the trendy restaurant where he worked, it was hard to tell which was causing the couple more pain: the spicy food… or the unfolding break-up.\n\n\"They were ordering all of the spicy dishes on the menu, and so I just remember thinking that it must add so much intensity to what is already an intense conversation about whether or not we're going to break up,\" Denbro tells me.\n\nDenbro, then a line cook working the wok and the fry, saw the couple growing more frustrated with each other throughout their meal. By the time they left the table, Denbro says, they decided to call it quits.\n\nThe public, or quasi-public, break-up is its own storied genre. It's inspired some of the best scenes in great movies: The infamous \"Legally Blonde\" restaurant meltdown, or Mark Zuckerberg not realizing he's getting broken up with in \"The Social Network\" (Joe Cammarata, the co-owner of bar Tall Order, which took over the space in Somerville, MA, where that scene was filmed, says there's been at least one breakup in the bar since they opened in March). If you've decided it's time to part ways, a public end can sting; sobbing at a coffee shop or park isn't pleasant for anyone. Of course, ending things in public has its uses, especially if you're worried about a partner's reaction to pulling the plug.\n\nIf anything, public breakups might become more common. As homes get smaller, rents rise, and roommates abound (including ones you're related to: 18% of 25- to 34-year-olds live with their parents), you don't want to have to move out of a now-cursed space or have your parents asking what's wrong. I once heard that a New York edict is never to break up with someone at your apartment: Chances are it's small, and afterward every tiny crevice — or the dent in your cheap Ikea couch — will remind you of your ex.\n\n\"I think public breakups are as common as they've ever been, but they might've been amplified through social media, which creates the illusion that public breakups are a thing,\" Julie Nguyen, a certified dating coach at the Hily dating app, says. \"In Gen Z, it can be uncomfortable to break up, and a public setting can often be used as a way to emotionally manage the intensity by not giving the person an opportunity to crash out.\"\n\nFor the bartenders, back-of-house workers, and servers helping people navigate their \"it's not you, it's me\" speeches, that's spawned its own mini break-up economy.\n\n\"If you're going through a breakup, make sure to tip well, because the service staff in the back of house, we're going to try to support you however we can,\" Denbro says.\n\nGetting into a relationship is an investment. Back in 2024, I calculated the cost of getting a successful relationship off the ground and found that singles had to pony up around $650 to move forward with their matches. Climbing out of a relationship is similarly costly — especially if you cohabitate. The cost of the singles tax — how much more solo renters pay annually to live alone compared to couples — is above $7,000. Even if you don't live with that formerly special someone, you are likely to incur some costs from a breakup, especially if you've been divvying up various costs. That begets another economic question: Who pays in a public break-up?\n\nEmma, a bartender at Ethyl's — a New York City bar listed as one of the best spots in the city to break up — witnessed a couple come in on a packed Saturday night. The woman turned to her then-boyfriend and asked him why she had caught him kissing her male best friend. Then, she threw his phone to the ground. The now-ex-boyfriend quietly paid for their margaritas. Bela, another bartender at Ethyl's, says that one-half of a Gen X couple came in already drunk, and the couple split up on the spot over her drinking. When the inebriated member of the defunct twosome went to pay, her debit card declined. The now-ex-boyfriend there ended up paying and tipping well.\n\nGabrielle Macafee, a 30-year-old chef and writer, has witnessed the higher-end version of a public split. She was working at a small tasting menu restaurant in Brooklyn when a \"morose\" couple came in. As their conversation grew more emotional, the staff took notice. Halfway through the $130 tasting menu, the man stood up and left.\n\n\"My teammates and I were like, wait, how do we handle this? He's gone. You can only hold the food for so long,\" Macafee says. Eventually, the woman left behind said she'd just pay for both meals. \"We offered to send her the rest, but obviously, she just wanted to get out of there as soon as possible.\"\n\nThere is also an art to choosing where to have the public breakup, if it must be done outside the comfort of your home. Macafee thinks somewhere that's a step above a dive bar in a neutral neighborhood — one that's mutually convenient, but not a place you frequent — is an ideal spot.\n\n\"I wouldn't recommend choosing a place that's in your neighborhood or a spot that you visit,\" Nguyen, the dating coach, says. \"You don't want either of you to feel dread going back, or tie bad memories to a spot they love. A neutral, quiet outdoor setting is the best play.\"\n\nWhile it's good advice, it can also make for breakup patterns. One Business Insider editor recalled getting dumped by three separate paramours at the same park in Chicago. There are also a few common signs that your bar or restaurant outing might not end with an intact relationship. Denbro, the former line cook, says that one tell-tale sign that things were not going well was when a couple kept changing their order, or when one half of the couple decided after the fact that they wanted something different. Duplicative orders — like each ordering their own appetizers and entrées at the family-style restaurant — were also a tip off.\n\nAt one breakup that Macafee witnessed, the duo had different wines, perhaps marking the end of the conviviality that would lead you to split a bottle with a lover. AB Soria, a general manager of a restaurant in Chicago who's worked in the industry since 1995, tells me that if you're planning on ending things, a seat at the bar is the way to go.\n\n\"If you're going to sit down at the table, I just feel like that's kind of cruel. Because then it's you're anticipating having a dinner and spending time there — and then to get broken up with, and then you're just stuck sitting there — is horrible,\" Soria says. \"At the bar, at least, I feel like there's more of an ability for the bartender to see what's going on, and then also make sure that whoever's left at the bar is OK.\"\n\nTiming is another complicating factor in the art of the public breakup. There's what's colloquially known as \"breakup season,\" the time around the end of the year when folks take stock of what they want and don't want. That can align with what dating coach Amy Nobile Messing says is generally a pivotal time in a relationship: The three-month mark is decision time. If you participated in a late-summer, early-fall tryst, your time might be up come years' end. Messing says she's coached many people to break up in a coffee shop — she feels like there's less pressure there.\n\n\"Here's the thing — unless it's a total shock — usually it's not a shock, usually it's like, 'Things haven't been great. I really think we should talk and meet at our coffee shop',\" Messing says. \"There's already an energy of separation, and so it just lends itself to paying separately.\"\n\nIronically, some of the impetus for a public breakup might be financial.\n\nChristine Hargrove, a clinical assistant professor at the University of Georgia and the assistant director of the university's Love and Money Center, says that daters are increasingly comingling their finances without a set structure in place — they may not have the formality of a shared bank account, but are informally splitting expenses like rent and food. That makes sense in our increasingly costly times. The downside, though, is that a breakup can feel even more heightened in those situations. Disentangling shared finances — even those informal ones — can feel like a threat, Hargrove says.\n\n\"People get really emotional when they feel financially threatened. Frankly, people can behave in unexpected ways when they're experiencing that level of threat,\" Hargrove says. That can lead to a public uncoupling, where folks hope to leverage social norms to head off more intense emotional reactions.\n\nThere is some good financial news: Messing says break-ups shouldn't be costly. If you have to take it outside, she advises against ordering food. But if you do crack open the menu, avoid anything fancy.\n\n\"You don't want to be eating a crab claw when you're breaking up. You don't want to have a mouthful of shrimp,\" Messing says. If you have to eat, maybe get a muffin or something you can nibble on — nothing too involved. Get a to-go cup, and try to keep the spending to around $5 to $10.\n\n\"I really think it should be minimal spending. I think it should be coffee. I think it should be maybe one drink,\" Messing says. \"It should be commensurate with what's happening, and what's happening is the end of something.\"\n\nThat's a spot of good wallet news for those ending their relationships. And, emotionally, there is a light on the other side of the public break-up tunnel. Macafee, the chef and writer, loves to frequent her favorite neighborhood diner. Over the summer, she found herself there, getting broken up with.\n\n\"This little doowoop song comes on, and I've never heard it before, but it was like, 'Breaking up is hard to do.' It was just that line over and over and over again,\" she says. \"And then I was trying not to laugh at the irony that that was playing in my little diner that I love so much as this woman is eviscerating my heart.\"\n\nIn the case of Macafee's breakup, the now-ex paid. Still, she was worried that her favorite spot would be tainted forever. It's a conundrum that every public dumper or dumpee has likely encountered, seeing their ghostly selves sitting in the windows of that random bar or restaurant. When I found out that the ice cream store I was once dumped at had closed, it felt bittersweet — a version of me that had once been there (and split the bill!) would no longer be able to haunt it. I wouldn't want to go through the breakup again, but it was nice to have a physical marker of a version of myself — heartbroken and lost — that I would hopefully never be again.\n\nFor her part, Macafee continued going to the diner, powering through the lingering sadness that would arise every time she came in to write or gab with a friend. Ironically, she went in the other day and heard that same break-up song again.\n\n\"After the breakup, I still went, but definitely, every time I would go, it'd give me this pang of sadness that, over time, just heals. Now I don't have that anymore,\" Macafee says. \"As I'm dating somebody else now and I'm falling in love, now it's just this pillar that I'm kind of tethered to, and I can look at and recognize my own growth and my own love stories as they unfold and break down.\"\n\nJuliana Kaplan is a senior reporter on the economy team, where she covers the labor force, kitchen table economics, and the people behind the numbers.",

    "fullText": "Today, Windows 11 powers over a billion devices and supports millions of apps across business, creativity, education, gaming and productivity. For decades, our commitment to openness and compatibility, in partnership with our global community of developers, has enabled a rich and enduring ecosystem. However, users are increasingly seeing apps override their settings, install additional software or alter core Windows experiences without their awareness or consent. And your feedback is clear: Windows must both remain an open platform and be secure by default — protecting the integrity of your experience regardless of the apps installed. Our developers and ecosystem partners echo this need. They have called for stronger, more consistent security foundations in the operating system. Windows is evolving to take more accountability to place you firmly in a consent‑first model by making app and AI agent behavior transparent, decisions reversible and access limited to clearly approved capabilities. At the same time, we remain committed to app compatibility and will provide developers with the tools and guidance needed to adapt to this strengthened security model.\n\nMicrosoft has made security a top priority, investing deeply through company‑wide efforts like the Secure Future Initiative to make Windows more secure by default and focused on helping organizations prevent, manage and recover from incidents through the Windows Resiliency Initiative along with our ecosystem partners. We’ve strengthened Windows with security controls designed to meet customer needs, delivered through capabilities like Smart App Control and Administrator protection. Building on this, we are starting new SFI efforts for Windows Baseline Security Mode and User Transparency and Consent in Windows. This establishes a more robust security model that advances app transparency and user consent, with features that make app behavior more visible and app permissions easier to understand and manage.\n\nWith Windows Baseline Security Mode, Windows will move toward operating with runtime integrity safeguards enabled by default. These safeguards ensure that only properly signed apps, services and drivers are allowed to run, helping to protect the system from tampering or unauthorized changes. Users and IT administrators will still have the flexibility to override these safeguards for specific apps when needed. Developers can also check whether these protections are active and whether any exceptions have been granted — giving them insight and control over the conditions under which their apps run.\n\nWith User Transparency and Consent, we are bringing a more consistent and intuitive approach to how Windows communicates security decisions. Just like on your smartphone, Windows will now prompt you when apps try to access sensitive resources — like your files, camera or microphone — or when they attempt to install other unintended software. These prompts are designed to be clear and actionable, and you’ll always have the ability to review and change your choices later. Apps and AI agents will also be expected to meet higher transparency standards, giving both users and IT administrators better visibility into their behaviors. These updates raise the bar for security and privacy on Windows, while giving you more control and confidence in how your system and data are accessed.\n\nWindows has a long-standing tradition as an open platform. We will continue to preserve what has made it successful: freedom to install any app and openness to every developer. Building on that foundation, Windows Baseline Security Mode and User Transparency and Consent are grounded in a set of principles that put users clearly at the center.\n\nWe recognize that change takes time. That’s why this will roll out through a phased approach guided by clear principles – developed in close partnership with developers, enterprises and ecosystem partners to ensure a smooth and thoughtful transition. We’ve already begun this work alongside some of them to shape the early direction. We’re learning and adjusting from their feedback and perspectives as we refine our approach to stronger security, user transparency and consent, and how this evolution of Windows supports their needs.\n\nJacob DePriest, CISO and CIO at 1Password, says, “We’re excited to see Microsoft’s commitment to hardening desktop app security by making app behavior more transparent and strengthening security by default. As more people continue to rely on SaaS apps, agents and AI-driven tools, clarity and consent at the operating system level are critical to protecting sensitive data without adding friction. The focus on user transparency and choice for security is something we deeply value at 1Password.”\n\nMichael Draper, VP of Global Consumer Trust at Adobe, says “Adobe has always taken a proactive approach to security and we are collaborating across the ecosystem to strengthen customer protection. These efforts align with our broader focus on trust and we appreciate the opportunity to work alongside companies that share this commitment to keeping people safe.”\n\nAlex Ionescu, Chief Technology Innovation Officer at CrowdStrike, says, “CrowdStrike is looking forward to being an early partner in the development of a new, more secure and resilient runtime model for Windows applications, which helps raise the bar for user security and privacy. When applications and agentic workloads are well-behaved and respect user consent settings with proper security boundaries, security software can better protect users from attackers with reduced performance overhead.”\n\nElise Murphy, Head of Game Security at Electronic Arts, says, “At EA, delivering great player experiences through fair and competitive play is foundational to how we build games. We support platform initiatives that build stronger foundations for security and integrity, and raise the cost of cheating.”\n\nRaycast is a popular productivity tool used by developers and professionals. Thomas Paul Mann, Co-founder and CEO of Raycast, says, “At Raycast, privacy and security have always been core to how we build. As a tool that works deeply with Windows, we believe users deserve full transparency about what apps can do. This matters even more as AI agents start to act on their behalf. We’re excited to support User Transparency and Consent and shape it together.”\n\nNow, we’re expanding the conversation to our broader community. Through upcoming blogs and dedicated feedback channels, we’ll invite you to engage with us, share your insights and help refine this journey. Together, we can strengthen the Windows ecosystem and build the next 40 years of innovation — grounded in trust, transparency and user consent.",

    "fullText": "Six US states are pushing legislation to put a moratorium on artificial intelligence (AI) data center construction.\n\nYahoo Finance Breaking Business News Reporter Jake Conley joins Market Domination Overtime host Josh Lipton to outline the details of these bills and the potential ramifications down the road.\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination Overtime.\n\nWhich states are pushing back and why are they pushing back?\n\nYeah, Josh, you've got six states with bills being considered right now. You've got Oklahoma, Vermont, and Maryland, but also three major hubs, New York, Georgia, and Virginia, home to Data Center alley in the Lowden area.\n\nThose back three have been huge sites of development. These bills are structured in a few different ways, but the basic underlying principle\n\nis that they look to put a moratorium on data center development. Essentially saying from roughly one year to a roughly three-year window,\n\nyou cannot develop here, you cannot build here until certain hurdles are met or until we get a pipeline cleaned up of requests or ex-conditions are met.\n\nBut essentially this is saying to those developers, these states, if these bills pass, will be walled off to you.\n\nAnd the the real argument here is infrastructure strain. These data centers suck up a lot of energy. They suck up a lot of water. That's going to put pressure on rate payers bills. You already see electricity bills hiking in these areas that have had a lot of development.\n\nYou see water strain in those areas. The grid is under a lot of stress. And so lawmakers are now trying to get ahead of that and saying, wait, wait, wait, slow down. Let's get some stuff on the books, get some regulations in place. But to do that, we want a breather.\n\nWhat what are the chances uh that these bills actually do pass, Jake?\n\nThey're going to face an uphill battle for a few reasons. You got to remember these data centers bring jobs. They bring tax revenue.\n\nAlso, the companies that are behind these centers, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, these aren't easy to push aside. These are companies with real political heft and firepower, with real pressure. And a lot of these governors are at least nominally pro-development.\n\nSo the argument they're going to come up against from these data center developers is, hey, we're bringing you jobs. We're bringing you revenue. Why would you stop us from building? And they're going to face that same kind of push back from business interests, business lobby.\n\nEven if these bills don't go through, you could still see and probably still will see some kind of regulation, cost sharing agreements, water usage parameters. But the focus right now because of their top line impact is on these moratoriums.\n\nHow much, Jake final question, could this all sort of disrupt the great AI ambitions and dreams of Big Tech?\n\nI think the rule with the hyper scales right now is speed, right? There's an arms race going on. You see these companies spending hundreds of billions of dollars on building out this infrastructure. And the game here right now for for Microsoft, for Google, for all these companies building these out is speed.\n\nHow fast can we get these things put up to power the compute that we're trying to put into the market. Any kind of delay there is going to hurt those companies and slow them down.\n\nI was talking to someone today who works in site selection advising these companies on where to go. She was telling me you're already seeing people inside these companies take a second look at some of these spots and say maybe that's not the right idea. Maybe we go somewhere\n\nwith less laws on the rest proposals on the books. The problem is those areas have less infrastructure. So you're going to run into problems wherever you go.\n\nBut regardless, especially in these kind of bigger sites, bigger states where a lot of this development is happening, when the rule of speed, anything that's going to slow speed down is going to be detrimental.\n\nAll right, big story. Thank you Jake for covering it. Appreciate it. Thanks.",

    "description": "A business owner explains how running a property company with her husband works, and the boundaries that protect both marriage and money.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Katie Bloomfield. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nA lot of people tell me they could never work with their spouse. But I didn't find Danny, my husband, until I was in my 30s, and once I did, I wanted to spend as much time with him as I could — to catch up on the years we hadn't known each other.\n\nWe met in 2017 and married two years later. Between us, we had five children. I was working in hotel management and helping a friend build her own business, while Danny had been running his own business for years.\n\nAfter we started investing in property and found our strengths complemented each other, I suggested we try running a property management company together. Six years later, we now own £10 million ($13.6 million) worth of property.\n\nWhile I wouldn't suggest to everyone that they should start a company with their partner, the setup has worked really well for us because we've put practices in place to protect our relationship.\n\nWe live in a no-blame culture — both in work and at home. Blame builds resentment. I've seen this a number of times when couples are in business together, and it doesn't end well.\n\nWhen one of us has done something wrong, we don't blame each other; we never make it public, but instead coach each other in private.\n\nInstead of finding fault with each other when something goes wrong, we look at what needs to happen now. What is the next step to take responsibility?\n\nEarly on, we decided that if we were going to go into business together, it was our responsibility to keep our relationship strong and healthy.\n\nIf our relationship broke down, so would the family lives of our kids and our business.\n\nOne very practical way we have done this is by sticking to the 777 rule. Every seven days, we go on a simple date — it might be just a walk or a coffee. Every seven weeks, we may have a bigger, longer date, and every seven months, we take a short holiday, just the two of us.\n\nWe also keep the romance alive — making sure we consistently have sex, making it a goal to be intimate with each other at least 86 times a year, a figure based on a statistic about how much sex healthy couples have. We've both got tattoos that read \"~86\" — just to remind us of how important physical intimacy is.\n\nEvery Sunday, we sit down as a family and make a plan for the week. It's here we make space for work, family, and couple time. Every single thing is on the family calendar.\n\nWe make every effort not to talk about work outside our working hours. If Danny attempts to show me a spreadsheet at 11 p.m., I'll ask him why he is showing me — it isn't work time. Family vacations are, for the most part, work-free.\n\nOccasionally, we don't have a choice — we'll have to work unexpectedly. When this happens, we don't try to multitask family and work. We build in the time we need to work, and get it done during that timeframe.\n\nYou may think that, as joint-business founders, we'd spend all our time together, but we actually work several times apart each week, as our working styles are different.\n\nDanny likes working from coffee shops, whereas I need a quiet space — usually at home. We divide and conquer tasks — often taking meetings separately.\n\nHowever, we really enjoy each other's company — we're obsessed with each other — so we love working together too.\n\nIt's imperative that we communicate clearly with each other, never assuming we know what the other person is thinking.\n\nIt becomes passive-aggressive and can be harmful to the relationship, which, in turn, is harmful to business. Both of us are honest, even blunt, with each other, but always in a kind way, and always in private.\n\nThe reason working together as a couple has worked is because we have put considerable energy into our relationship and ourselves.\n\nWe've both been prepared to hold up a mirror to ourselves, asking what we might need to change, and we've prioritized stretching our relationship.\n\nI wouldn't have gone into business with just anyone, but it works really well with Danny.",

    "description": "Ford once predicted it would sell 150,000 electric pickups each year. Instead, it recorded another multi-billion-dollar loss in 2025.",
    "fullText": "Ford's electric vehicle business lost nearly $5 billion last year — and CEO Jim Farley says the company got the message.\n\n\"So I think the customer has spoken. That's the punchline,\" he said during Tuesday's earnings call.\n\nFord's EV unit posted a $4.8 billion loss in 2025, as sales of its Mustang Mach-E, F-150 Lightning, and E-Transit fell 14% from a year earlier.\n\nNow, the automaker is reshaping its electric strategy — shifting toward lower-cost, high-volume EVs and leaning harder into hybrids. It's a reversal of Ford's early strategy of electrifying its most iconic, priciest vehicles first, betting that brand loyalty and subsidies would offset sticker shock.\n\nFord was one of the earliest legacy American automakers to directly challenge Tesla with mass-market EVs.\n\nThe Mustang Mach-E arrived in December 2020 as a rival to the Tesla Model Y. In mid-2022, Ford launched the F-150 Lightning.\n\nOn paper, the bet was simple: electrify the century-old carmaker's two most iconic nameplates to leapfrog EV startups.\n\nEarly enthusiasm was strong. Ford said it received nearly 200,000 reservations for the Lightning and projected annual sales of 150,000 units.\n\nThat early momentum faded — and never materialized into the high-volume sales Ford was hoping for.\n\nIn 2025, Ford sold 27,307 F-150 Lightnings — down 18.5% from 2024 — and 51,620 Mustang Mach-Es, roughly flat year over year.\n\nSales figures were even more stark after the $7,500 federal tax credit ended last September. The F-150 Lightning's estimated sales dropped from 5,197 units in December 2024 to just 1,724 a year later, according to Ford Authority.\n\nMeanwhile, US EV sales declined while hybrid demand climbed. For example, Ford sold 84,934 hybrid F-150s last year, a 15% increase.\n\nSo, the company is switching up its plans.\n\nThe company has since ended production of its all-electric F-150 Lightning. It will return at an undisclosed time as an extended-range electric vehicle, or EREV — a battery-powered truck with a gas generator onboard.\n\nFord expects the new model will have improved range and increased towing capacity, both of which were concerns for early F-150 Lightning adopters.\n\n\"We're betting on hybrid across our lineup, and EREV where it makes sense,\" Farley said during the call. \"Like a large truck, where towing is a really important application, and both PHEV (plug-in hybrid-electric vehicles) and pure electric will definitely not work.\"\n\nAt the same time, Ford is developing a new \"universal\" EV platform designed for lower-cost, high-volume vehicles.\n\nThe first model — a roughly $30,000 midsize pickup — is expected in 2027. Ford plans to build at least five vehicles off the platform, potentially including SUVs and commercial vans.\n\n\"We aren't just building compliance vehicles at Ford. We're launching a cost-efficient, universal EV platform that will drive profitable growth,\" Farley added. \"Tesla's shown that they could, we can make money in that market, even without subsidy from the government at the right cost level.\"\n\nIt follows a trend in the auto industry. Other major automakers — including Toyota, Subaru, Rivian, Nissan, and Chevrolet — are planning launches for sub-$50,000 EVs this year.\n\nStill, Ford expects its EV business to remain in the red for several more years. CFO Sherry House said the company is targeting break-even for the segment around 2029.\n\nInvestors have taken a cautious view of the company's long-term financial health. Ford missed earnings estimates for the quarter, reporting 13 cents adjusted estimated earnings per share versus analysts' estimates of 19 cents.\n\n\"On paper, it's a big miss, but I don't think it's a big deal,\" John Rosevear, a contributing analyst at The Motley Fool, told Business Insider. \"Ford's guidance for 2026 anticipates nice year-over-year increases in cash flow, as well as higher capital expenditures — all stuff that the market will almost certainly like.\"",

    "fullText": "When Pete Srodoski meets with a new executive coaching client these days, he can do more in-depth work more quickly, thanks to ChatGPT.\n\nSrodoski, who founded the coaching firm Roll With the Punches in 2021, used to spend hours with clients discussing what should be included in strategic documents. Now, he uses ChatGPT to draft those documents alongside his clients in about 10 minutes.\n\nWith AI handling the initial framework, Srodoski and his clients can jump right into fine-tuning strategic plans and key job descriptions.\n\n\"That allows us to go deeper, go further, actually take those plans and make actionable items,\" he tells Business Insider.\n\nSrodoski is one of three solopreneurs who spoke with Business Insider about how they're using AI to streamline mundane decision-making — like writing initial drafts, formatting emails, or editing social media posts. The time and mental energy saved allows them to focus on the most critical decisions for their businesses and their clients, they say.\n\n\"We want to make the most impact for our time,\" Srodoski says — and AI can help.\n\nGeorgia Fort, founder of Stories by Georgia Fort, is an independent journalist in Minnesota who started using AI about 18 months ago. She uses ChatGPT to format her newsletters and social media posts, and OpusClip to edit videos for social media.\n\nShe estimates that using those services has freed five to ten hours in her workweek — time that she can now apply to the in-depth reporting she's known for.\n\nUltimately, \"the biggest impact is increased output,\" Fort says. With AI assistance, she's able to post more content on social media and release newsletters regularly, something she struggled with in the past.\n\nAn added bonus, she says, is that utilizing AI makes it just a bit easier to find the work-life balance that many solopreneurs struggle with.\n\n\"If nothing else, it's a meal I get to sit down and have with my kids,\" Fort says.\n\nDusti Arab, owner of The Reinvention Co., a boutique marketing firm, says AI is integrated into nearly every aspect of her workday. Because of that, \"I don't think I've put up so much high-quality content, ever,\" she says.\n\nFor Arab, who has ADHD, managing the constant decisions that a solopreneur must make was draining. She would often worry about missing a small detail, which distracted her from higher-level thinking.\n\nNow, she uses Wispr Flow to take voice notes throughout the day on topics like client communications and content ideas. Then, she imports those into Notion AI, which combines access to Claude, Gemini, and ChatGPT to help her turn her notes into briefs.\n\n\"If you use AI to process the brain dump first, the deliverable comes out way better,\" Arab says.\n\nHer efforts with AI and being vocal about how she uses it are also paying off in a different way — clients now reach out to her specifically for advice on how to use it. She often guides them in using AI to delegate more effectively.\n\n\"Once the raw notes exist, you can use AI to turn the brain dump into a clear brief, a task list, and a handoff that someone else can actually execute,\" she says.\n\nLike Arab, Srodoski is often the one to introduce his clients to AI, specifically ChatGPT, Claude, and Perplexity, the platforms he uses. Often, the response is \"awe,\" he says.\n\nLast week, for example, a client shared that the time involved with pricing jobs had become a major roadblock in his business. Using ChatGPT, Srodoski guided him in creating a price book based on the previous three years' sales data.\n\n\"He was smiling ear to ear, saying that this would have cost him a few thousand dollars and a few weeks of labor time to get this pulled off,\" Srodoski says.\n\nWhile clients are often enthusiastic about AI, part of Srodoski's coaching is now emphasizing the decisions that leaders shouldn't outsource to AI.\n\nRecently, he had a client who wanted to confront an underperforming vendor. The client was planning to draft an email using ChatGPT, but Srodoski stopped him.\n\n\"Get on the phone. See how they respond,\" he recalls saying. During the phone call, Srodoski's client was able to explain himself, empathize with the vendor, clarify a misunderstanding, and create a solution.\n\n\"That's a leadership decision you can't do with ChatGPT,\" Srodoski says.",

    "fullText": "\"Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try again. Fail again. Fail better.\"\n\nIrish playwright Samuel Beckett's famous quote has become Corporate America's new mantra.\n\nFrom Okta to Salesforce to Blackstone, executives told BI's Sarah E. Needleman and Ana Altchek getting it wrong is ok. Just do it quickly and learn from it.\n\nThe tech industry has always been a big proponent of failing fast, but Corporate America is now catching on thanks to AI. The tech allows companies to quickly launch new tools to a wide group.\n\nAnd, perhaps more importantly, it's a way for executives to prove the big money they are spending on AI isn't going to waste. (Hence why they want you to fail fast.)\n\nIt's not just for launching products either.\n\nEven the ideation phase can be quickly sped up with chatbots that can talk through ideas. What previously might have taken executives (or, more likely, their underlings) hours of research can get figured out a lot faster.\n\nThere are still some hurdles with the fail-fast approach.\n\nWhat does failing even look like? There isn't a big, red alarm that goes off every time an AI project fails. (Although that sure would be fun.) Executives will say they set clear guidelines for a prototype beforehand, but a tool's benefits can be nuanced. And maybe you just need a little bit more time to really make it sing. All that makes it a lot harder to decide when to pull the plug.\n\nBuilding airplanes in the sky. The rush to get things out can lead to the belief you'll just fix things on the fly. But that's a dangerous precedent. Just ask the video game industry. When games came in physical copies you had to blow on to get working, companies made sure their product was bulletproof. Nowadays, they can digitally ship a game knowing an update for a glitch wont be far behind. It's a dangerous game that can cause major headaches.\n\nOpening the floodgates. A formalized product launch slows things down, but it also makes sure everyone is on the same page. A massive greenlight risks a lack of standardization. That might not seem like a big deal for a prototype. It becomes a bigger problem down the road if the product needs to be reconfigured to fit into the company's wider tech stack.",

On most podcasts, the answers come packaged as business advice. On Bobbi Althoff's show, they arrive somewhere between awkward silence and dry humor.\n\nThat contrast is part of what made a 2023 episode of \"The Really Good Podcast\" stand out. Althoff, known for her signature deadpan delivery and intentionally uncomfortable interview style, steered the conversation from Cuban's early days sleeping on floors with roommates into a blunt question about her own future.\n\n\"Do you think I could be a billionaire one day?\" she asked.\n\nThe AI Marketing Platform Backed by Insiders from Google, Meta, and Amazon — Invest at $0.85/Share\n\nPut professional stock research to work in a single ETF — explore Motley Fool Asset Management's factor-based funds.\n\nCuban told her yes — with a reality check attached.\n\n\"If you want to be,\" he said. \"But being a billionaire takes luck. I mean you could be rich. I mean you can be well off if you bust your a**. And that's not to say a lot of people bust their a** and don't make it, but there's like a path.\"\n\nCuban's answer drew a line he has talked about for years. Billionaire status often comes down to timing, scale, and luck. Getting rich, he said, is more repeatable.\n\nCuban fans know his own fortune was built during the dot-com boom, when he sold Broadcast.com to Yahoo for $5.7 billion — a deal he's often credited with closing at the perfect time, just before the bubble burst.\n\n\"There's like a path if you have your own business and you know how to sell,\" Cuban told her. He added that building sales skills and growing a business creates the foundation for wealth long before anyone starts thinking about billions.\n\nTrending: Blue-chip art has historically outpaced the S&P 500 since 1995, and fractional investing is now opening this institutional asset class to everyday investors.\n\n\"If you get good at selling and you can build your business then you can start as a millionaire,\" he said. \"And then if you get lucky then you never know where it takes you from there.\"\n\nThe exchange fit neatly into Althoff's style. When Cuban pointed out she had not been strong at selling yet, she replied with a flat \"thank you,\" keeping the tone somewhere between joke and business lesson. Cuban responded the same way he often does with founders and entrepreneurs — monetize the opportunity.",

    "fullText": "Police shut down DD Café in Garden Grove, Calif. after \"complaints of illegal activity\"\n\nSeventeen people, including the business owners, were arrested on Feb. 5\n\nThe arrests come days after a TikTok user described DD Café as a \"strip club\" in a viral video about the business\n\nPolice shut down a California café reportedly known for its bikini-clad employees after “complaints of illegal activity” and a viral TikTok describing it as a “strip club.”\n\nSeventeen people were arrested at DD Café on Thursday, Feb. 5 following a police investigation into the Garden Grove, Calif. establishment, the Garden Grove Police Department (GGPD) said in a Feb. 5 news release.\n\nThe department’s Special Investigations Unit conducted the investigation into DD Café “following complaints of illegal activity occurring inside the business,” the GGPD said. On Feb. 5, police served a search warrant at the establishment. Gang suppression officers were on the scene, according to the release.\n\nThe GGPD’s Sgt. Nick Jensen told The Orange County Register that police found DD Café employees serving customers while clad in bikinis, as well as in what the newspaper described as “various states of undress.”\n\nThe Los Angeles Times reported that the business was operating as a “bikini cafe.” The Yelp page for the business shows photos of employees in bikinis, and lists it in business categories for “coffee & tea,” “juice bars & smoothies” and “adult entertainment.”\n\nJensen also told The Orange County Register that the business owners were among the 17 people arrested in the Feb. 5 bust.\n\nThe café violated public nudity and alcohol regulations among other Garden Grove municipal codes, the GGPD sergeant said. The business was not permitted to sell alcohol at the location, the newspaper reported, citing authorities.\n\nIn addition to the arrests, DD Café has also been red-tagged, according to police. This means the business is required to cease operations until the various violations are addressed, Jensen told The Orange County Register. The business is currently listed as closed on Google.\n\nThe owners of DD Café could not be reached for comment. A GGPD spokesperson did not immediately respond to PEOPLE's request for comment.\n\nThe police investigation into and arrests comes after a video describing the Orange County establishment as a “strip club” went viral on TikTok.\n\n“So I went to a strip club today by accident, and I know what you're thinking. ‘By accident?’ No, actually, for real,” user @dosdaygirl, identified by CBS News as Paulina Abena, says in a Feb. 2 video that has amassed nearly 2 million views.\n\nAbena describes DD Café as “topless” in the TikTok, stating that she visited after searching for coffee shops in her area and finding the now-closed establishment. “They meant double D, like boobs,” she says of the business’s name. “So I walk in and everybody's naked. Quite literally, they're all naked. … I'm the only non-naked woman in the place.”\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nPolice have previously taken action against a “bikini café” in Garden Grove, Jensen told The Orange County Register.\n\nHe also told the newspaper that authorities believe that similar establishments are operating elsewhere in the area.",

    "description": "Some bigger firms are using AI to embrace a classic startup mentality to quickly identify what works — and cast aside what doesn't.",
    "fullText": "For some companies building with AI, failure isn't a setback. It's the strategy.\n\nOkta, Salesforce, Snowflake, Blackstone, and others are rapidly launching AI products, fully expecting that not all of them will pan out. Executives say they can't afford to meticulously test ideas in isolation if they want to outpace their competitors, and AI makes it easy to deploy new offerings at scale anyway.\n\n\"It's increased the pace of what's possible,\" said Eric Kelleher, president and chief operating officer of digital-identity company Okta, which has rolled out around 120 AI pilots and features over the past two years, keeping half and scrapping the rest. \"You can spin up a lot more pilots at the same time.\"\n\nThis so-called fail-fast method isn't new, as tech startups have been doing it for decades. It's now gaining traction among larger, established businesses due to the AI boom.\n\nLeaders say they're under pressure from their boards and shareholders to justify their AI spending, and that the fail-fast approach is helping them meet the moment.\n\n\"The stakes are higher, the risks are bigger, and to keep pace with the innovation churn, we need to fail faster than ever,\" Cisco's senior vice president and global innovation officer, Guy Diedrich, told Business Insider.\n\nFor some companies, fail fast isn't just a mindset — it represents a new reality driven by AI efficiency gains.\n\nSnowflake CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy said the cloud-data platform company has rolled out numerous pilot programs, often moving from a planning meeting on Monday to a demo by Friday. With its agentic support system, he said, many cases that once took hours to debug can now be resolved in about 20 minutes.\n\nSimilarly, something like preparing a customer briefing for an executive used to take hours. Now, Ramaswamy said, it can be done in a minute by asking a sales agent.\n\nJohn Stecher, the chief technology officer at Blackstone, told Business Insider that the \"fail fast\" mindset has long been a mainstay in the engineering world, but AI tools have enabled companies to accelerate development timelines.\n\n\"Our software engineers, by quantifiable metrics, are about 2x more effective than they were in 2024 with writing code,\" Stecher said, adding that they now have the ability to deliver faster and higher quality work.\n\nHe said the \"blocking-and-tackling part of software development and engineering,\" including tasks like writing unit tests and higher-quality code, allows engineers to \"deploy more robust,\" reliable, and secure code, so that workers spend less time fixing bugs and more time building. That increase in productivity allows teams to build prototypes more quickly and launch them to users faster.\n\nRamaswamy similarly said that a lot of the heavy lifting on engineering teams for tasks like boilerplate code, tests, and migrations happens much faster. That frees workers to spend more time on tasks that require judgment, architecture, and design, he said.\n\nMoving at warp speed comes with risks, however.\n\nLast year, Salesforce launched an AI agent designed to answer customer queries, and it recommended a competitor's application to a user. The user then wrote about the snafu on LinkedIn, said Joe Inzerillo, president of enterprise and AI at the software company.\n\nAnother time, one of Salesforce's newly released AI agents provided a customer with false information gleaned from old web pages that had been removed from its website but were still crawlable by search engines. The error was discovered during a review of conversations the agent was having with users.\n\nThough both incidents exposed early-stage gaps to users, Inzerillo said they also revealed important insights into how users interact with the products and how experiences can be improved. \"We're going into every single deployment as an experiment to try to learn something,\" said Inzerillo.\n\nThe consequences of failing fast, however, can be worse if companies overlook important security measures.\n\nStecher said companies in general shouldn't necessarily deploy more products just because they can now do so more easily. He said firms need a \"robust checks and balances\" system and have data privacy and security controls in place from the get-go, or they'll pay the price with outages or cyber issues.\n\nSnowflake's Ramaswamy said that while the \"fail fast\" concept is reappearing, the current version is \"less about recklessness and more about shortening the feedback loop.\" He said the phrase \"iterating rapidly\" is a more accurate way to describe the company's approach to building with AI.\n\n\"We identify areas that we know are going to be generally positively impacted by AI, but set up small, almost weekly, goals,\" Ramaswamy said. \"This way, we can adjust and know when things are working well and when we need to course correct.\"",

    "fullText": "Sen. Kevin Harris (D-Prince George's) speaks with Sen. Brian Feldman (D-Montgomery) on the Senate floor Tuesday. Harris introduced a bill that could let utility companies to build and operate power-generation infrastructure. (Photo Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)\n\nSen. Kevin Harris is not sure his bill allowing investor-owned utilities to get back in the business of generating power — and using ratepayer dollars to do so — is the answer to high energy prices and constrained demand in the state.\n\nBut the Prince George’s County Democrat is sure that something needs to be done.\n\n“We need to have all possible options out there for the state of Maryland. Who knows if this is the right one, but we won’t know until we actually do the deep dive, have the discussions and figure out what’s best for our constituents,” said Harris of Senate Bill 954 that he is sponsoring.\n\nThe bill, which lays out a pathway for investor-owned electric utilities to use ratepayer dollars to build power generation infrastructure in Maryland, has the support of Exelon — the owner of Baltimore Gas & Electric, Delmarva Power and Pepco. The Chicago-based utility has been campaigning hard for the idea, including in TV commercials that aired in Maryland during the Super Bowl.\n\nBut consumer advocates and environmental groups argue that putting additional costs on the backs of customers would be deeply harmful amid already-high costs. They warn that high infrastructure spending by utilities is part of the reason for the current high rates, and allowing further construction would make matters worse.\n\nMaryland People’s Counsel David Lapp, who is tasked with representing utility ratepayers in the state, said in a statement that he believes “the Exelon bill is anything but affordable.”\n\n“Turning new business over to Exelon unnecessarily exposes customers to the Exelon utilities’ long record of exceeding cost projections and of cost overruns,” Lapp said.\n\nIn Maryland, the utilities, which control the distribution of power to homes and businesses across the state, are separate from the companies that generate power and supply it to the grid.\n\nThe utilities enjoy monopolies in their service territories and are regulated by the Public Service Commission, which presides over the costs they can pass on to customers. Utilities receive reimbursement of approved infrastructure costs, and a guaranteed profit on top of that, often 9% or higher.\n\nCurrent law technically states that the PSC “may require or allow investor-owned electric company to construct, acquire, or lease, and operate, its own generating facilities … subject to appropriate cost recovery.”\n\nHarris’ bill is considerably more specific.\n\nThe bill directs the PSC to require one or more electric companies to submit plans involving power generation, if it determines that there is a power scarcity, or that an event impacting “price stability” has occurred. The commission then has one year to approve or deny the plans.\n\nHarris said that his bill, called the Affordable Energy Act, would only allow the utilities to build renewable energy projects, but not fossil fuel projects.\n\nValencia McClure, senior vice president of government, regulatory and external affairs for Exelon’s Maryland utilities, said her company wants to focus on operating community solar farms and battery storage infrastructure, not natural gas generation. She noted that power customers who \n\n“We really are focusing on: How can we support our customers during this affordability crisis?” McClure said. “The way to do that is to — if called upon by the state — to be able to build new generation.”\n\nBut Lapp said Maryland consumers should not be paying for any increased power generation in the state through their rates, since much of the predicted strain on the regional grid isn’t actually coming from Maryland. It’s largely coming from data centers projected for other states, he said.\n\nHouse caps amount of utility employee salaries that can come out of ratepayers’ pockets\n\n“PJM projects that the Maryland Exelon utilities’ power demands decrease — not increase — through 2029.” Lapp wrote. “Aside from some relatively small data center growth in Maryland compared to PJM — growth that existing customers should not be responsible for — the Exelon utilities’ energy demands only go up modestly starting in 2030, at a growth rate much lower than historical growth rates.”\n\nHarris’ bill explicitly states that the electric utilities required or authorized to construct power facilities can recover all of their costs from ratepayers — even if some of those costs are stranded, including if the infrastructure is never built.\n\n“That’s one of the things that we would be discussing further and see what is actually needed and what is not needed,” Harris said.\n\nLapp argues that the provision is alarming.\n\n“It would give utilities unprecedented statutory protection from the consequences of building power plants that turn out to be unnecessary — a real possibility given the vast evidence suggesting that projections of data center energy demands are inflated,” Lapp wrote.\n\nIn a statement, BGE spokesperson Nick Alexopulos said the company supports the measure “to make sure a large generation project doesn’t jeopardize the utility’s health or lead to higher debt costs overall, which would adversely impact customers.”\n\nIt’s unclear whether the bill will be able to advance: Senate President Bill Ferguson said Tuesday that “there is a level of skepticism that exists across the caucus, and across the Senate membership” about whether it will reduce ratepayer costs.\n\n“That’s going to be the lens that we are really trying to hone in on, is whether or not a policy is going to provide long-term savings for the ratepayer,” Ferguson said.\n\nMcClure said Exelon estimates that average customer bills would increase about $2 per month for a few years, but those would turn to savings of $5 to $10 a month in the future. The company’s analysis was based on construction of 2,700 megawatts of battery storage and 1,200 megawatts of solar.\n\nFerguson said that he would “prefer that that the risk” of investment “land with investors.”\n\nSUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE\n\n“But there is a question that if there is a strike price or point where … the market is not generating sufficient domestic generation, whether that has to be some other market intervention to push it,” Ferguson said.\n\nLast year, lawmakers passed the Next Generation Energy Act, which included a fast-track permitting process for “dispatchable” energy projects, which can provide energy for the grid when called upon during peak times. Only two projects have been approved to move through the fast-track, under the legislation’s requirements: Two different concepts for a natural gas plant in Harford County, submitted by Constellation.\n\nConstellation, formerly an Exelon subsidiary, also proposed a battery storage project, but it did not meet requirements of the fast-track bill, even though it created a procurement specifically for battery storage.\n\nConstellation has been opposed to Exelon’s push to enter the generation game, arguing that it would crowd out competitive power producers, and that Exelon is ill-suited to enter the generation fray.\n\n“BGE doesn’t need new law to build new generation,” said Constellation spokesman Paul Adams. “BGE wants new law to guarantee a return on any investment, whether or not that investment is in the best interests of Maryland ratepayers or at the lowest cost. Unlike them, Constellation is ready and willing to put our own capital on the line, with no guarantee of profit. It seems only reasonable that if you aren’t willing to take on any risk, you should take no profit.”",

    "fullText": "If you're starting your career at PwC, deciding where you'll do it has gotten a lot easier.\n\nThe Big Four firm cut the number of US locations where entry-level consultants can start working to just 13, BI's Polly Thompson exclusively reports.\n\nLimiting the options — new hires could previously choose any of the 72 US offices — is about building a greater sense of community among junior employees early in their careers, Yolanda Seals-Coffield, chief people and inclusion officer for PwC US, told Polly.\n\nIt's an example of how PwC is evolving in the AI era. Polly previously reported on the firm's launch of a learning initiative to train workers in specific skills necessary for AI. It also created a new career path aimed at engineers.\n\nIt's not just PwC. Polly has done a fantastic job covering consulting firms and their attempt to use AI without upending their business. AI agents are still falling short of outright replacing human consultants, but the CEO of one AI training giant told BI the models are learning fast.\n\nIn the meantime, AI use by entry-level employees remains a key issue.\n\nOn the one hand, the tech can automate a lot of the mind-numbing work that juniors get bogged down with early on. On the other hand, skipping that initial work means losing foundational knowledge that is crucial down the road.\n\nThe AI-for-juniors issue isn't specific to consulting.\n\nThe risks posed by training young workers on AI are universal. And with so much emphasis on benefiting from AI, companies can't delay their decision much longer.\n\n\"What differentiates outperformers in 2026 won't be strategy; it will be execution,\" Paul Griggs, CEO of PwC US, told me last month when discussing big themes for the year.\n\nLeaders need to be \"hyper intentional around discipline, around road maps, around building teams that are measured based on what they execute,\" Griggs added.\n\nTwo senior bankers I spoke with last month raised questions about how to use AI efficiently early in your career. They debated the benefits of expediting a junior's path toward more impactful work, alongside the risks of creating a knowledge gap by skipping early steps.\n\nIt's a tricky balance. Forgoing it entirely means you risk falling behind your competitors. Leaning in too heavily risks losing the attribute your clients still pay you big bucks for: human judgment.\n\n\"You're missing some of this basic training that's actually a very important underpin and foundation to your more sophisticated evaluation and judgment of things at a later stage in your career,\" one of the bankers said about outsourcing early work to AI.",

    "description": "Salesforce's senior VP of business technology said he tries to teach his kids resilience, and it's a skill is important for entry-level talent, too.",
    "fullText": "As companies rethink how they train early-career workers in a job market shaped by AI, Salesforce executive Andy White said resilience is top of mind for him — both at work and at home.\n\nWhite oversees Salesforce's implementation of Slackbot, an AI personal agent that generates responses based on conversations, files, and workflows inside Slack.\n\nAs White raises his son and daughter during a period of rapid technological change, he said he preaches to his kids the importance of powering through moments that don't go as planned. He said resilience is pivotal and that it's important for people to focus on doing the hard things and being OK when things don't go as expected.\n\nThe senior vice president of business technology said he recently spoke with his daughter about the importance of dealing with situations rather than merely labeling them as \"good\" or \"bad.\"\n\n\"Hard is hard,\" White told Business Insider. \"Hard isn't necessarily bad.\"\n\nExpectations, he said, are the \"destroyer of hope and joy,\" and that when things don't go as planned, it often turns out to be a good thing down the line, even if it doesn't seem that way in the moment.\n\n\"It's when we look back, and it's like, 'Oh man, I'm glad that didn't go the way I expected,'\" White said. \"But when you're in it, it's really hard.\"\n\nThe resilience lesson is one White also thinks is relevant for entry-level workers. While junior hires often arrive ready to use new tools and deliver a \"pretty high output,\" he said, persistence is an area where some still need to grow.\n\nHe described today's entry-level talent pool as \"incredibly capable, very bright, and very driven,\" with a stronger grasp of how to use AI tools to solve problems.\n\n\"They're much more fluent at being able to leverage AI tooling in the flow of their work,\" White said.\n\nHowever, he said the group sometimes struggles when it comes to working through challenges.\n\n\"There's more willingness to give up sooner,\" he said, adding that this trait doesn't apply across the board.\n\nWhite said he's seen AI tools, such as the company's recently upgraded Slackbot, help boost entry-level workers' confidence. He said they could help reduce feelings of imposter syndrome by helping early-career workers navigate challenging situations that arise at work.\n\nWith that said, White added that workers need to stay balanced and not let tools make them \"overly confident.\" He said workers need to bring skepticism to \"any kind of information\" they get, and be diligent about reviewing sources and citations when using AI.\n\n\"If you don't believe something, read the citation, and if it doesn't have a citation, you have to assume it's a hallucination,\" White said, adding that he tells his kids the same thing.",

    "title": "Drones on Ukraine's frontline perform so unpredictably in frigid weather that it's like 'Russian roulette': commander",
    "description": "Sr. Lt. Serhii Andrieiev told Business Insider that the cold can disrupt anything from the drone's camera lens, to its battery, to its aerodynamics.",
    "fullText": "Extreme winter temperatures can pose an onslaught of technical challenges for drone operators on Ukraine's front lines, a local drone commander said as his country was hit by a cold snap.\n\nSr. Lt. Serhii Andrieiev, deputy commander of the \"Kraken\" drone company in the 3rd Army Corps, told Business Insider that the cold can heavily disrupt reconnaissance and first-person-view attack drones because their parts often aren't designed to withstand such conditions.\n\n\"Their behavior is unpredictable, how they will operate in the frost. It's a bit, kind of like Russian roulette,\" Andrieiev said. \"Will it work, or will it fall on the field?\"\n\nMany drones in Ukraine are built with off-the-shelf components ordered online. The freewheeling nature of the supply market means it's difficult to assess how consistently each individual part performs in the cold, Andrieiev said.\n\n\"These components are serially manufactured components. They are not mil-spec components. They are cheap, and well, most of them are from China,\" he said.\n\nHe said Ukrainian units have learned to adapt, but these issues can delay critical missions or add to mental strain for troops already dealing with harsh weather. Such challenges also imply risks for other militaries seeking to bolster their drone forces, especially as concerns grow that potential new wars may spill into the Arctic regions.\n\nAndrieiev was speaking as Ukraine had just experienced one of its coldest weeks since the full-scale war began. Average temperatures in the first week of February dropped to about -19°C, or -2.2°F.\n\nIn Kharkiv, where Andrieiev's troops are fighting, some nights registered temperatures as low as -6°F.\n\nAlmost every part of the drone is susceptible to such cold. For example, Andrieiev said, low temperatures can significantly reduce the voltage of its battery, causing it to die more quickly when used at full capacity.\n\n\"You can't predict the behavior of this battery. To switch on the drone, no problem. The problem starts when it flies and hits the maximum power of its battery,\" Andrieiev said.\n\nA bigger issue arises because the drone generates heat as it flies. When it's cold out, the temperature gap between the aircraft's internal structure and the environment puts stress on its electronics and motors.\n\nThe drone can also get wet through condensation, disrupting its wiring or fogging up its lenses. Even aerodynamics can be affected when frost and small icicles grow on the chassis or propellers.\n\nThe result can be frustrating for the drone pilot, Andrieiev said. Sometimes, they watch helplessly as their drone, still transmitting footage to their screen, crashes to the ground or into a tree because a component fails.\n\n\"You identify your target, you should hit the target. You prepare your drone, drone is starting, drone flying to target, and just in the middle of the flight, it falls to the ground. And that's it,\" he said.\n\nWhen his units receive drones that aren't working well in the cold, they typically return the entire batch to the manufacturer and request improvements.\n\nWhile Andrieiev said that quality issues are becoming \"much less of a problem\" for Ukrainian drone manufacturers, returning drones costs valuable time.\n\n\"It takes time, and you should have a buffer stock of those components and drones, so that you can replace it faster than the manufacturer,\" he said.\n\nOther equipment for attack drones, such as antennae, transmitters, or supporting relay drones that extend signals, can also fail. Hair-thin fiber-optic cables used to circumvent Russian jamming need to be high-quality to avoid damage from the frost as well, he added.\n\n\"The FPV drone is just one link, one element of this whole system,\" Andrieiev said.",

    "fullText": "While theme park giants such as Disney and Universal have continued to see high visitor numbers in an uncertain economy, many smaller amusement parks and themed hotels in different parts of the world have struggled with rising operational costs, to the point of having to shut down business.\n\nAfter posting a loss of more than $1.2 billion at the end of 2025, Six Flags shared its intention to close more \"underperforming\" locations in its amusement and water park portfolio across North America. A Six Flags park in Maryland had closed down month earlier in November 2025.\n\nAt the start of the new year, the Cartoon Network Hotel serving primarily visitors to the Dutch Wonderland park in central Pennsylvania also shut its doors over a string of financial challenges dating back to the Covid pandemic.\n\nOperating in the British seaside town of Somerset since 1946, Brean Theme Park has become the latest theme park to risk a total shutdown after being assigned liquidators over its financial situation.\n\nThe 80-year-old park was originally a campsite for visitors to the coastline along the Bristol Channel but was expanded into a theme park with rides in the 1970s.\n\nThe park that had become beloved local staple known for its free entry (visitors paid credits for rides they wanted to take) had more than 40 attractions and was preparing to open for the summer season in March when it announced that it was taking \"resolutions for winding-up\" on February 4.\n\nNicholas Stafford of Hazlewoods LLP is the insolvency attorney overseeing the liquidation of Brean in a way that helps creditors and shareholders recoup some of their losses.\n\nAs a former public company, Brean stopped trading at the end of January and, short of a last-minute Hail Mary, will be shuttered forever in the coming weeks. The local notice announcing this decision states that \"the Company be wound up voluntarily.\"\n\nAccording to local reports, visitor numbers dipped significantly during the Covid pandemic, and the theme park was not able to recover from the debt created during that period.\n\nThe closure marks a significant blow to both the Somerset community and vacationers from nearby cities such as Gloucester and Bristol.\n\nThe struggling theme park had been renting land from Unity Holidays, the company also behind parks such as Brean Unity Holidays, Brean Splash, Brean Play, and Brean Gym, reported U.K. outlet Daily Express. Those parks, according to their ownership, will continue to operate in the coming summer.",

    "fullText": "You don't usually expect restaurant-style service at 35,000 feet — but Turkish Airlines still staffs a 'flying chef' in business class on its longest routes.\n\nThese rare culinary specialists, who are separate from flight attendants, take food orders, plate meals in the galley, and oversee premium service on long-haul flights.\n\nThe role is designed to make dining feel closer to a restaurant than standard airline catering — but chefs don't actually cook from scratch due to flight safety rules. They use ovens to heat and finish pre-prepared meals and then arrange the presentation.\n\nThese chefs also take customer feedback from the air to help improve and develop meals in catering kitchens on the ground.\n\nI recently experienced the unique service on a 10-hour flight from Istanbul to New York in January. Considering Turkish won Skytrax's 2025 awards for Europe's best business class and best business class catering, I was eager to see how the seat and food measured up.\n\nI strategically chose the Boeing 787 for its modern business cabin; the Boeing 777 that also flies the route doesn't have the nicer design.\n\nBetween the lie-flat seat, the large TV, and the restaurant-style meals, the cabin felt like my living room on a lazy Saturday night.\n\nI slept well and appreciated the wide variety of food, from poached eggs and swordfish to a trolley full of savory appetizers.\n\nHere's what the full experience was like. Business Insider paid a media rate for the business class upgrade to New York.\n\nTurkish's Istanbul business class lounge is unreal, with cooked-to-order meals like omelettes and kebabs, drink stations, and sleep suites that feel like mini hotel rooms.\n\nMy layover time qualified me for a suite, but they're first-come, first-served — I was lucky to wait only about 15 minutes.\n\nThe bed was so comfortable I slept five hours straight, with a shared bathroom and shower just across the hall.\n\nI chose seat 8A, in the last row, for privacy and to be among the first to deplane. Although it's right by the galley and lavatory nearest the boarding door, I didn't notice much noise with headphones on.\n\nMost Turkish business cabins don't have doors. Some A350s do, and the airline is planning a new \"Crystal Business Class\" with sliding doors, but most planes — including the 787 I flew on — still don't.\n\nIt's not a dealbreaker by any means, and the seat wings help cocoon the space a bit, but there is less overall privacy than with a door.\n\nThe business class seats lie fully flat, and mine felt both spacious and cozy. I could comfortably sleep on my stomach, and I particularly liked the mattress pad and the dual-texture blanket, which has a soft plush on one side.\n\nI also appreciated the 1-2-1 cabin that let me freely reach the aisle. Many of Turkish's old planes still have 2-3-2 layouts that force middle and window-seat travelers to crawl over their neighbor to reach the restroom.\n\nThe seat had multiple storage spots: a cabinet, a footrest cubby, and a slim seatback pocket — plus an overhead bin to myself.\n\nI stashed my purse, Kindle, chargers, boots, backpack, and jacket without feeling cramped.\n\nThe seat's television was large and fully controllable via a handheld remote. I watched \"The Big Bang Theory,\" \"Fast and Furious,\" and an Agatha Christie-style whodunit called \"Murder at the Embassy.\"\n\nInstead of a flight attendant, a dedicated flying chef takes orders, plates meals, and preps appetizer and dessert carts.\n\nMost of the menu — like meats and soups — are fully or nearly fully cooked on the ground in airline kitchens, but finished in the air by the chef and cabin crew using onboard ovens.\n\nThe cabin crew still hands out drinks and hot towels, but with meals covered, I imagine they can better focus on other tasks.\n\nAll of the food was served on real dishware and with flatware — no cheap plastic.\n\nTurkish offers a \"dining-on-demand\" strategy that lets passengers choose when they want to eat.\n\nFor example, I slept a few hours after breakfast before requesting tea, though the crew member also brought me a small sandwich. It was simple — handcrafted with a roll, lettuce, and cheese — but perfect while I watched a movie.\n\nThere were also free snacks available throughout the flight, like popcorn, fruit, mixed nuts, chocolate, cookies, and chips.\n\nThe breakfast started with appetizers: fresh juice, fruit salad, cheeses, smoked turkey, marinated olives, and bread with butter and jam.\n\nThe entrée options included poached eggs with a savory sauce called shakshuka, spinach-and-cheese stuffed pastries and flatbreads (börek and gözleme), and sweet curd crepes with fruit and berry sauce.\n\nI had the poached eggs, which were prepared on the ground but were still fluffy with a perfectly runny yolk on the plane.\n\nThe second meal included a huge range of appetizers: octopus salad, salmon tartare, shrimp salad, artichoke salad, fried aubergine, beef patties, chicken salad, cheese, red pepper soup, creamy pea soup, and Köpoğlu (essentially Turkish eggplant caviar).\n\nEverything was arranged on a trolley by the chef and rolled down the galley for passengers to pick and choose; the presentation made the experience feel more fancy, and everything was tasty.\n\nBesides Turkish, select Saudia, Austrian Airlines, and Garuda Indonesia flights feature onboard chefs.\n\nTurkish's chefs, staffed through catering partner DO&CO, also spend time at meal-prep facilities, providing feedback and helping maintain quality — a hands-on approach that shows in the in-flight service.\n\nI rarely check luggage, but I had too many souvenirs this time.\n\nLuckily, my bag survived the transfer from Zagreb, Croatia, and arrived in New York safe and sound.",

    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — It is pre-dawn in the historic Podil district of the Ukraine capital, Kyiv, and warm light from the Spelta bakery-bistro’s window pierces the darkness outside. On a wooden surface dusted with flour, the baker Oleksandr Kutsenko skilfully divides and shapes soft, damp pieces of dough. As he shoves the first loaves into the oven, a sweet, delicate aroma of fresh bread fills the space.\n\nWhat economic risks do energy attacks pose to Ukraine?\n\nHow are labor shortages impacting Ukrainian companies?\n\nHow are power outages affecting Ukrainian business operations?\n\nWhat additional costs are Ukrainian businesses facing during wartime?\n\nSeconds later the lights go out, the ovens switch off and darkness envelops the room. Kutsenko, 31, steps outside into the freezing night, switches on a large rectangular generator and the power kicks back in. It’s a pattern that will be repeated many times as the business struggles to keep working through the power outages caused by Russia’s bombing campaign on Ukraine's energy grid.\n\n“It’s now more than impossible to imagine a Ukrainian business operating without a generator,” said Olha Hrynchuk, the co-founder and head baker of Spelta.\n\nThe cost of purchasing and operating generators to overcome power outages is just one of many challenges facing Ukrainian businesses after nearly four years of war. Acute labor shortages due to mobilization and war-related migration, security risks, declining purchasing power and complicated logistics add to the pressure, officials say.\n\nHrynchuk, 28, opened the bakery 10 months after Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022. That winter was the first year Russia targeted Ukraine’s energy system. Hrynchuk says they barely know what it is to work under “normal” conditions, but have never faced the challenges they do now.\n\nProduction is entirely dependent on electricity and the generator burns about 700 hryvnias ($16) worth of fuel per hour.\n\n“We run on a generator for 10 to 12 hours a day. You have no fixed schedule — you have to adapt and refuel it at the same time,” Hrynchuk said.\n\nOlha Nasonova, 52, who is head of the Restaurants of Ukraine analytical center, says the industry is experiencing its most difficult period of the past 20 years.\n\nWhile businesses were prepared for electricity cuts, no one expected such a cold winter and it’s been especially tough for small cafés and family-run establishments, because they have the least financial resources.\n\nThe “Best Way to Cup” project, which has two venues and roasts and grinds its own coffee, is on the brink of permanent closure. Co-founder Yana Bilym, 33, who opened the cafe in May, said a Russian attack shattered all its windows and glass doors in August. Bilym said the cost of renovation was 150,000 hryvnias (about $3,400), half of which she financed with a bank loan that she only recently finished repaying.",

    "description": "Threats to executives are pushing companies like Starbucks and Disney to boost CEO security and mandate the use of corporate jets for personal travel.",
    "fullText": "For decades, executive security followed a familiar playbook: Most CEOs traveled freely at home, accepted protection only in high-risk foreign countries, and treated personal safety as a private concern rather than a boardroom imperative.\n\nMentions of exec security protocols are popping up in more proxy filings, and companies like Starbucks are changing corporate jet policies due to what it calls \"significant heightened security concerns.\"\n\nThese moves follow the December 2024 killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in New York City and a shooting at a Park Avenue office building about eight months later.\n\nBoth instances shattered long-held assumptions that corporate leaders were at least somewhat insulated from the types of violence more often associated with politicians or celebrities, several security executives told Business Insider.\n\nThere isn't a distinction between low-, medium-, or high-risk anymore, said Dale Buckner, head of the security firm Global Guardian, which works with Fortune 1000 companies.\n\n\"The risk is everywhere,\" he said.\n\nThe news of the disappearance of \"Today\" co-host Savannah Guthrie's mother, Nancy, has only added to a sense of unease for high-profile leaders, several of these execs said.\n\nBuckner, a retired US Army colonel who served for more than two decades, said his firm has briefed more boards in the past 11 months than in the previous 14 years combined. Increasingly, Buckner said, boards view CEOs and other C-suite members as assets that must be protected, even if some leaders are leery of perceived constraints on their freedom.\n\n\"The board is overruling the CEO who is going, 'I don't need this,'\" he said.\n\nIn regulatory filings, companies have begun to spell out their decisions. Starbucks said last month that, following a security review, it recommended that CEO Brian Niccol use company aircraft for both personal and work travel. While it's made that recommendation before, the company lifted a spending cap it had in place for personal travel and will instead review those costs each quarter.\n\nUnlike in its previous proxy a year earlier, Starbucks also cited \"the existence of credible threat actors.\"\n\nThose concerns extend beyond the coffee chain.\n\nDisney requires Bob Iger, who is set to step down as CEO next month, to use company aircraft for both business and personal travel. A security consultant identified \"bona-fide, business-related security concerns\" for Iger, Disney said in a January filing. That language didn't appear in the company's prior filing.\n\nMeatpacking giant Tyson Foods said it hired a consultant during its fiscal year that ended in September to review risks associated with its senior management team \"based on the evolving security environment for corporate executives.\" One resulting change: requiring certain execs to use company aircraft for both business and personal travel.\n\nProxy filings by large US public companies that mention \"executive security\" or \"corporate security\" rose from 69 in 2023 to 87 in 2025, according to an AlphaSense analysis.\n\nRepresentatives from Starbucks, Disney, and Tyson Foods didn't respond to Business Insider's requests for comment on the nature of the threats executives face.\n\nWhile high-profile CEOs have long had protection in high-risk zones, Buckner said what's grown more common is keeping executives under a 24/7 safety umbrella.\n\nBuckner said that the protocol for one of his protectees, a Fortune 500 CEO, includes 18 armed agents, camera surveillance of the executive's home, and monitoring of its WiFi network. A former garage on the property now serves as an \"op center,\" he said.\n\n\"I have two to four roving armed agents around their home, 24 hours a day,\" Buckner said.\n\nIt can be a challenge to determine whether something that starts as disapproval over a company or leader could morph into something more nefarious, security veterans said.\n\nA threat might start out as a joke in poor taste, and a group targeting a company might pick it up. Then, all of a sudden, it becomes a real risk, said Lisa Kaplan, founder and CEO of the risk-intelligence firm Alethea.\n\nCaleb Gilbert, founder of White Glove Protection Group, a security firm serving large companies and family offices, said the range of people who feel threatened has widened over the past six months.\n\n\"The reality of risk is resonating with more people. And that's different than I've seen in the last 30 years,\" he said.\n\nOne reason is that the cadence of high-profile incidents — from the attempted assassination of President Donald Trump in 2024 to the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk in September — hasn't seemed to slow, Gilbert said. While attacks on business leaders remain rare, many nonetheless feel rattled, he said.\n\n\"It used to be where something bad would happen, there'd be time in between, and the executives would forget about it,\" Gilbert said. Now, \"with the security-minded glasses that they put on, it's brought everything into focus.\"\n\nThe cost of protection is part of that view. A small protective detail can cost about $1 million a year, while a full-scale operation can reach $30 million, he said.\n\nIn some cases, Gilbert said, even without a board's prodding, executives are \"willing to give up personal liberties that they cherished before for the sake of feeling safe.\"\n\nThe apparent kidnapping of Nancy Guthrie could lead to demand from executives to detect threats against parents, Kaplan said. Typically, she receives requests from executives to monitor risks to their children.\n\nBuckner said he recently spoke to a group of CEOs in Washington, DC, on security threats. Many reported feeling unnerved, he said.\n\n\"It's palatable,\" he said. \"They're scared that they're in a new world order. They're not quite sure how to navigate it.\"",

    "title": "What's the future of the software business look like? Our top tech columnist weighs in.",
    "description": "In this Sunday edition of Business Insider Today, we're talking about what AI means for the future of the software business.",
    "fullText": "Software stocks had a brutal week, aside from a Friday rally, extending what has been a rough year for the industry. I touched base with our tech columnist, Ali Barr, the best I know on AI business models. He also wrote this piece in the midst of the selloff.\n\nAli, you've been covering AI adoption and costs by big business since you started our Tech Memo newsletter. What's your gut on whether the recent selloff was overblown?\n\nSoftware business models have underpinned the tech industry for decades. Companies invest heavily upfront to build software, but each additional copy costs almost nothing to distribute. So revenue scales faster than costs, driving fat profit margins. That dynamic helps explain why Microsoft, the world's largest software company, is so valuable.\n\nAI challenges this model. If this new technology makes employees more productive, companies may need fewer software subscriptions. And as AI tools improve, businesses could replace existing software with AI-driven workflows or even build their own software using AI coding tools. Finally, if software companies embrace AI, that could make their services more expensive to run than traditional software. That would mean rising usage doesn't automatically translate into soaring profitability.\n\nIf software in the AI era becomes less profitable and grows more slowly, then it's logical that the stock prices of software companies might fall. A lot.\n\nBig Tech spending on AI data centers and other infrastructure is set to soar again this year. How will these companies generate a return on these huge investments?\n\nThe numbers are breathtaking. Just two companies, Google and Amazon, are planning capex of almost $400 billion in 2026. A couple more years of the same, and that's more than $1 trillion.\n\nTo get a return on this, they will have to come up with new revenue of well over $1 trillion in future years. AI is amazing and really useful, but it's hard for some investors to see how this happens. Even if new AI products are awesome, do consumers and companies have enough money to buy all this stuff? I don't know. One outcome could be that Big Tech giants make do with slimmer profit margins in an AI future. That's similar to the concerns that have hammered software stocks lately.\n\nWho are the most-interesting people to watch in the sector?\n\nI pay attention to Andrej Karpathy. He was director of AI at Tesla and a founding member of OpenAI. He's pretty independent nowadays, which means what he says about AI can be trusted more. Bonus: He coined the term \"vibe coding.\"\n\nAditya Agarwal was Facebook's first head of product engineering. He was also CTO and VP of engineering at Dropbox. He's a coding powerhouse. Recently, he used Claude to do some coding and was stunned by the power of this tool. \"I am filled with wonder and also a profound sadness,\" he wrote on X. \"We will never ever write code by hand again. It doesn't make any sense to do so. Something I was very good at is now free and abundant.\"\n\nI'm usually skeptical, but the start of 2026 feels like a moment of highly disruptive — and destructive — change.",

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Senada Greca, founder of WeRise and cofounder of Aonic. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nAt least four times a week, I meet with Kim Kardashian for a personal training session. Today, we're focused on the upper body and core. Over our hour-and-a-half session, we'll do assisted pull-ups, hollow-body chest presses, face-pulls, and more. Kim likes to end most training sessions with a dead hang on the bar.\n\nI've been training Kim for three years now. I also help millions of other people (mostly women) through my training platform WeRise, and the fitness and nutrition videos I post on social media.\n\nStrength training is powerful, especially for women. Once you know the strength your body possesses, you'll understand how to feel good in your body, rather than feeling like you need to shrink or punish it. I know, because that's a change I've made myself.\n\nI'm the oldest of three girls, born in Albania. After the communist government was overthrown in the early 1990s, there was a lot of civil unrest. I remember the first time we heard gunshots. We hid under the bed, staying down for a long time.\n\nLuckily, my family won the green card lottery (Editor's note: The green card lottery is formally called the Diversity Visa Program, which provides up to 55,000 visas through random selection.), and we were able to immigrate to America in 1997 when I was 14. That helped set up a safer, more prosperous future for my sisters and me.\n\nAt the time, it was very challenging. I spoke with a heavy accent and dressed differently from my classmates in upstate New York, which led to a lot of bullying. Since I was the only one in the family who spoke English, I had to help my parents with legal documents, doctors' appointments, and getting my sisters into school. It was a lot.\n\nEverything in my life felt out of control. The one thing I could control was my eating, and not long after immigrating, I developed anorexia. Within a few years, I was also struggling with depression and anxiety. I was exercising, but only to punish my body.\n\nIn college, I connected with counseling and medication that helped me start getting healthy. The real turning point came when I was in my mid-20s and met a new primary care doctor. She was in her 50s, but running marathons every quarter. She taught me to think about exercise as a way to support mental health. I started running and became more physically and mentally stable.\n\nAbout 10 years ago, in my mid-30s, I started strength training. It changed my life, as I started using exercise to nourish myself.\n\nIn my immigrant family, financial security was always very important. I had a corporate job, and had never considered building something on my own — it just wasn't done.\n\nI started teaching yoga at night, and loved how my classes made people feel. In 2019, I began posting videos of my workouts, at first for myself. I was extremely consistent, which helped me grow a big following. When the pandemic happened, my following grew exponentially as people looked for workouts they could do at home.\n\nIn 2020, I launched my website and began charging for memberships. I quickly saw that my fitness business could be stable and successful. That gave me the courage to quit my corporate job to follow my passion. In the years since, my audience has only grown, and I've had amazing opportunities, like training Kim.\n\nToday, I'm in the best shape of my life — physically and mentally — at 43. I don't often talk about my age, because I feel ageless and don't want to define myself by a number. At the same time, I want to show that getting older doesn't have to mean winding down.",

FOX 11's undercover cameras captured female servers providing lap dances, offering private dances for cash, and telling customers they could bring alcohol inside for a fee.\n\nCity records show DD Café, located at 10552 McFadden Ave., is licensed only as a coffee shop.\n\nMytchell Mora, a former Garden Grove resident and news producer, says he raised concerns about the business multiple times over the past year, contacting the city, a nearby high school, and the school district.\n\n\"Everyone knows about it, and no one was doing anything about it,\" Mora said.\n\nMora says he is troubled by how close the business is to La Quinta High School, which is within walking distance of the café. Under the Garden Grove Municipal Code, adult entertainment businesses are prohibited within 1,000 feet of a school facility.\n\nFOX 11 visited DD Café to ask the owner about the type of business being operated. A woman inside who said she was in charge, told us the location was \"only a coffee shop,\" then asked us to leave. The owner was not available for comment.\n\nWe also reached out to the City of Garden Grove, emailing officials on Tuesday, February 3, and again on Thursday, February 5, describing the undercover footage and requesting comment. No response was received.\n\nLater that same Thursday night, the Garden Grove Police Department announced on social media that 17 people were arrested at DD Café. The business was also red-tagged, effectively ordering it closed. When asked what the red tag meant, someone in the police department told us it can be issued for a variety of reasons, including safety or code-related concerns.\n\nPolice have not released details about what the 17 individuals were arrested for, and it remains unclear what charges, if any, may be filed.\n\nResidents in the area told us they were not surprised, saying similar businesses are an open secret in the city and that more enforcement is needed.\n\nFOX 11 has requested additional information from the city and police department and will update this story as more details become available.\n\nInformation for this story came from undercover reporting by FOX 11. Interviews were also done with local residents. Information on the arrests came from the Garden Grove Police Department.",

    "fullText": "SpaceX’s acquisition of xAI creates business worth $1.25tn but whether premise behind deal will work is questioned\n\nThe acquisition of xAI by SpaceX is a typical Elon Musk deal: big numbers backed by big ambition.\n\nAs well as extending “the light of consciousness to the stars”, as Musk described it, the transaction creates a business worth $1.25tn (£920bn) by combining Musk’s rocket company with his artificial intelligence startup. It values SpaceX at $1tn and xAI at $250bn, with a stock market flotation expected in June to time with Musk’s birthday and a planetary alignment.\n\nHowever, there are questions over the deal, such as whether it is good for SpaceX’s non-Musk shareholders and whether the technological premise behind it can succeed.\n\nFor Musk, a key part of the deal’s rationale is to move datacentres – the central nervous system of AI tools – into space.\n\nAI companies are too dependent on earth-bound datacentres that carry immense energy demands, Musk argued this week. The solution, he says, is to put as many as a million satellites into orbit to form vast, solar-powered datacentres.\n\nProf Julie McCann and Prof Matthew Santer, the co-directors of the school of convergence science in space, security and telecoms at Imperial College London, say solar-powered datacentres could be a future option for AI companies. However, there are limits to how much compute power can be mustered by current satellites, they say, so it would need a “planet-wide distributed computer composed of many satellites” – as envisioned by Musk.\n\nBut even executing the concept might be affected by the quality of connection between the orbiting devices, which will need to operate in tandem in order to replicate terrestrial datacentres as they beam their outputs down to Earth.\n\nThere are other problems to be ironed out, they add, including solar radiation and maintenance. “Datacentres on earth are constantly maintained – component failure is normal. Shipping components to space is complex and expensive, and you would have to be innovative regarding how components are fitted.”\n\nMusk talks of these datacentres adding 100 gigawatts of AI capacity annually – current global datacentre capacity is about 59GW – so his vision is ambitious. The world’s richest person believes a merger of rocket hardware and AI software is a winning combination and, in a message to employees, said it would create the “most ambitious, vertically integrated innovation engine on (and off) Earth”.\n\n“This merger is aimed at creating a new path to generate a low cost of generating AI compute within the next two to three years by bringing together the top internet/space exploration company with top datacentre builders,” says Dan Ives, an analyst at the US financial services company Wedbush Securities.\n\nMusk’s artificial intelligence company, xAi, is competing with rivals who are spending, and raising, huge sums on the infrastructure – datacentres, computer chips – needed for their products. The company, which has developed the Grok AI tool and also owns the social media network X, reportedly burned through $13bn last year and, unlike Meta, Amazon, Microsoft and Google, does not have a cash-generating legacy business to fund its efforts.\n\nCombining with SpaceX will give xAI better access to cash and investors, according to Ross Gerber, an investor in Tesla and SpaceX.\n\n“Musk is already running low on capital for xAI and it is competing with companies putting hundreds of billions of dollars into their AI investments. If you merge SpaceX and xAI you can support xAi because SpaceX is an extremely attractive prospect to a lot of investors,” he says.\n\nSpaceX’s technology is complex but it is a straightforward business. It generates revenues from deploying reusable rockets for missions such as launching satellites and restocking the International Space Station. It also operates the Starlink satellite high-speed internet service. SpaceX made about $8bn in profit on $15bn to $16bn of revenue ​last year, according to Reuters.\n\nThe addition of xAI adds narrative complexity to the SpaceX story, says Michael Sobel, the president and co-founder of Scenic Management, which buys secondary stakes in privately held companies and has invested in the AI company Anthropic.\n\nSobel, who speaks to SpaceX investors regularly, says: “By folding in xAI, which carries a significant monthly cash burn, you change the financial profile of the company overnight. In the secondary market, ‘simple’ is usually rewarded. This merger requires investors to do a lot more homework on how xAI’s cash burn impacts SpaceX’s overall valuation and IPO timeline.”\n\nThere is also the added burden of X, a social media platform that is a regular subject of regulatory scrutiny and political ire.\n\nNonetheless, Sobel adds, the argument in favour of the deal is compelling.\n\n“For a long-term investor, this secures the most advanced AI ‘brain’ for the most advanced hardware ‘body’ in existence. The upside is a $1.25tn entity that controls the entire stack, from the launchpad to the neural network.”\n\nGerber, who invested in Musk’s original buyout of X in 2022 when the platform was better known as Twitter, says he welcomes the deal but is less sure about SpaceX investors.\n\n“For me as a Twitter shareholder, I could not be happier. I pretty much figured I had lost my money but that has now been parlayed into owning SpaceX shares. It’s awesome for me but if I was a SpaceX shareholder I would be pissed.”\n\nMusk owns about 44% of the newly enlarged SpaceX business and 17% of Tesla, where he is the chief executive. Is the next step a combination of the two?\n\nIves believes there is a “growing chance” that a one-stop shop for investing in Musk businesses will be created.  “Musk wants to own and control more of the AI ecosystem and step by step the holy grail could be combining SpaceX and Tesla,” he says.\n\nGerber believes the timing is right, with both companies currently worth $1.25tn. “This is the time to create a multitrillion-dollar company. I know Elon. It’s going to happen,” he says.",

    "fullText": "New Anthropic campaign suggests other AI platforms will incorporate targeted ads in their chatbot conversations\n\nThe Seahawks and the Patriots aren’t the only ones gearing up for a fight.\n\nAI rivals Anthropic and OpenAI have launched a war of ads trying to court corporate America during one of the biggest entertainment nights of the year.\n\nAhead of the Super Bowl, Anthropic has launched a series of ads going hard at its rival.\n\nFor the scrawny 23-year-old who wants a six-pack, a ripped older man who is supposed to depict a chatbot suggests insoles that “help short kings stand tall” because “confidence isn’t just built in the gym”. And for the man trying to improve communication with his mom: his therapist prescribes “a mature dating site that connects sensitive cubs with roaring cougars” in case he can’t fix that relationship.\n\nAll four ads end with the same tagline: “Ads are coming to AI. But not to Claude.” There’s no explicit mention of ChatGPT, but the subtext is clear.\n\nEven Sam Altman laughed. But he also called the ads “so clearly dishonest” before diving into a lengthy critique on X.\n\n“Our most important principle for ads says that we won’t do exactly this; we would obviously never run ads in the way Anthropic depicts them,” Altman wrote. “We are not stupid and we know our users would reject that.”\n\nAltman stressed that OpenAI’s decision to include ads, announced last month, makes the product more accessible. “We believe everyone deserves to use AI and are committed to free access,” he wrote. And Altman didn’t shy away from taking some shots of his own. “Anthropic serves an expensive product to rich people. We are glad they do that and we are doing that too, but we also feel strongly that we need to bring AI to billions of people who can’t pay for subscriptions,” he wrote. (Claude has a free subscription version, too.)\n\nChatGPT’s ad policy is not live yet, but OpenAI maintains on its website that ads will be “separate and clearly labeled” and won’t influence the answers users see. The company also states that it will not share conversations with ChatGPT with advertisers, and is focused on prioritising trust, claiming it will give users the option to turn off personalization or opt for an ad-free paid plan. The company said the chatbot would initially have ads show up at the bottom of answers “when there’s a relevant sponsored product or service based on your current conversation”.\n\nAltman wasn’t always sold on including ads in ChatGPT’s business model. In October 2024, he dismissed the idea as a “last resort”. But in recent years, as OpenAI invests even more heavily in AI infrastructure, the company’s growth in new subscribers has dwindled.\n\nAnthropic’s critique of OpenAI didn’t come out of nowhere: Anthropic was founded by former OpenAI researchers who left based on concerns about the company’s direction on AI safety. Anthropic wrote in a 4 February blogpost that Claude would remain ad-free because doing otherwise would prevent the chatbot from being a “genuinely helpful assistant for work and for deep thinking”. The company likened open-ended conversations with AI assistants, which are often deeply personal or complex, to those with a trusted adviser. “The appearance of ads in these contexts would feel incongruous – and, in many cases, inappropriate,” the company wrote.\n\nEven if OpenAI says it won’t share user data directly with advertisers, targeted advertising more broadly has been criticized for exploiting users’ vulnerabilities. In this case, that concern could extend to users asking ChatGPT questions about their mental and physical health, similar to the issues shown in Anthropic’s ads. But there’s also a chance targeted advertising could help with reining in AI’s most toxic attributes. Big corporations that buy in may pull out in response to hateful or egregious content. Many websites and apps, from Google to Instagram, already have ads, so it may not be a huge adjustment for users.\n\nIt is unclear whether Altman’s attempts to deliver more revenue with ads will drive users to ad-free competitors. But Anthropic is betting on it.",

The Trump Administration found MAJOR FRAUD in programs THEY control, Newsom's Press Office's X account posted, linking to a New York Post exclusive on the announcement.\n\n\"The state has no role running / administering these programs.Were they hiding this??? California doesn’t hide fraud … we fight it. Nearly 1,000 arrests + over $125 billion STOPPED under @CAGovernor Gavin Newsom.\"\n\nLoeffler continued that the alleged California fraud comes after the SBA suspended 6,900 borrowers in Minnesota associated with 7,900 potentially fraudulent PPP and EIDL loans, which totaled roughly $400 million.\n\n\"As we did in Minnesota, we are actively working with federal law enforcement to identify the criminals who defrauded American taxpayers, hold them to account, and recoup the stolen funds. As we continue our state-by-state work, our message is clear: pandemic-era fraudsters will not get a pass under this Administration,\" Loeffler said, comparing California to its investigations in Minnesota.\n\nMinnesota became ground zero for welfare and social services fraud surrounding the pandemic late in 2025, when investigators uncovered sweeping fraud schemes that could top $9 billion.\n\nOriginal article",

    "fullText": "The race to dominate the burgeoning AI market is pushing tech giants to adopt business models reminiscent of IBM's (IBM) in the 1960s.\n\nBig Tech \"hyperscalers\" Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Amazon (AMZN) are all in various stages of developing their own custom AI chips to put in their data centers and power their cloud and software offerings. Alphabet, the farthest along of the four companies, is even reportedly in talks to sell its physical chips called TPUs to Meta — a move that would see it go head-to-head with leading chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA).\n\nThose efforts have led Bloomberg Intelligence analysts to predict the custom AI chip market will grow to $122 billion by 2033.\n\nBig Tech's production of their own components goes beyond chips: Microsoft and Amazon are actively investing in dark fiber, or currently unused fiber-optic cables that are already underground, RBC Capital Markets analyst Jonathan Atkin said in a recent note to clients. Google and Meta also own their own cables but still buy from third parties, he wrote. Those cables are necessary to connect companies' data centers and the enterprises that use them.\n\nThe dynamic in which cloud providers are making their own components (hardware) to run their core products (software) shows Silicon Valley swinging back toward vertical integration — an operating model pioneered by oil and steel tycoons in the late 19th century and adopted by IBM during the digital revolution.\n\nIBM was one of the most successful vertically integrated companies in the 1960s, when it made the hardware components for its mainframes, or large computer systems. IBM's strategy emerged from the idea that making its own specialized parts would improve its end product (mainframes) and profit margins — and amid concerns over supply shortages of parts for early computers. It worked: In 1985, the company accounted for more than half the market value of the computer industry, Carliss Y. Baldwin noted in her book \"Design Rules.\"\n\nOf course, that all fell apart later. In the 1990s, the falling costs of producing semiconductors — as well as the rise of software powerhouse Microsoft and chip leader Intel — dug into IBM's once-formidable competitive moat, and the company no longer claimed to be vertically integrated by 2000, Baldwin said.\n\nJust as the emergence of computers pushed IBM toward vertical integration, the popularization of AI since the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022 has put today's cloud giants on a similar trajectory. In particular, the steep costs of Nvidia's chips and their limited availability have pushed tech giants to advance their AI chip efforts. Those custom chips are cheaper and better optimized for the companies' software.",

    "description": "Replit founder Amjad Masad says AI can remove drudgery at work, letting employees build and own ideas inside large companies.",
    "fullText": "Amjad Masad thinks the modern workplace is broken — and he believes AI can help fix it.\n\nThe Replit founder and CEO says traditional corporate work has become deeply alienating, with employees siloed into narrow roles where ideas die in backlogs.\n\n\"One thing that I found extremely depressing is how atomized and siloed people are,\" Masad recently said on the \"Possible\" podcast with Reid Hoffman. \"People become sort of cogs in the machine. And I don't think that is conducive to the human spirit.\"\n\nAI, he said, is starting to reverse that dynamic by letting people inside big companies build, test, and ship ideas themselves — without waiting for engineering approval.\n\nMasad's bet is that AI agents can automate much of the repetitive, standardized work that dominates corporate life — documentation, internal tools, workflows — freeing employees to think and act more like entrepreneurs.\n\n\"As the boring things, the automated things actually are taken care of by machines, we're left to be more entrepreneurial and more creative,\" he said.\n\nMasad isn't the only tech leader seeing huge potential in deploying AI agents.\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman has said AI agents can already handle work typically done by junior employees, Microsoft's AI platform product lead Asha Sharma has said they could flatten corporate hierarchies, and McKinsey's CEO Bob Sternfels has said the firm is already deploying 25,000 AI agents alongside its human workforce.\n\nOn the \"Possible\" podcast, Masad pointed to one case, where an employee at a big real estate marketplace had an idea to improve how buyers were routed to agents, but couldn't get engineering resources.\n\nIn the past, Masad said, \"the idea is dead,\" but now, the employee built a working routing algorithm himself using Replit, an AI-powered coding platform that lets users build and deploy software without traditional engineering support.\n\n\"He built a new routing algorithm that drove tens of millions of dollars, if not hundred million dollars, to the business,\" Masad said.\n\nThe result wasn't just business impact — the employee was promoted repeatedly and now helps guide the company's AI strategy at the board level, he said.\n\nMasad sees this as a form of entrepreneurship inside a large business where domain experts — not just engineers — can turn insight into execution.\n\nThat shift, he said, restores meaning to work by reconnecting people with the outcomes they create.\n\n\"Humans are fundamentally creative,\" he added.\n\nIf AI succeeds at removing drudgery rather than replacing judgment, Masad believes corporate jobs could become less soul-crushing and far more human.",

    "title": "A couple built a $1 million business turning shipping containers into vacation homes. Here's how they decided when to stop growing.",
    "description": "A couple started The Box Hop, a shipping container vacation home business. They are making $1 million in revenue but have decided not to expand.",
    "fullText": "There are several reasons to visit Hocking Hills, a foliage-rich region in the Appalachian foothills of Ohio: the majestic views, year-round outdoor adventures, and the chance to escape overwhelming city life.\n\nThe six shipping container homes dotting the region are another.\n\n\"Right now, I feel like the big push is experiential hospitality for people. It's no longer just staying at an Airbnb,\" Emily, 38, told Business Insider. \"What does it look like? What does it feel like? What's the experience like when you're there?\"\n\nWhile shipping containers might conjure visions of warehouses or loading docks, Seth and Emily Britt believed they could create a successful business transforming the storage units into modern vacation destinations. They earned over $1 million in revenue last year through their business, The Box Hop, which launched in 2018.\n\n\"When Emily and I were dating, I mentioned to her that someday I want to build a house out of shipping containers,\" Seth, 36, told Business Insider. \"Then she actually brought it back up in 2017, like, 'Hey, why don't we do that and chase that dream down?'\"\n\nNow, they have six vacation rentals and a wedding venue called The Seventy Five Venue. The couple also expanded their services to include construction, interior design, and cleaning.\n\nHowever, building their real estate portfolio involved making tough calls, including making the decision to downsize.\n\n\"I thought by now we would have a lot more properties, but I'm really glad we're where we're at because you can grow so much that you implode,\" Seth said.\n\nScaling a business is a tricky feat that has stumped major companies like WeWork, let alone small, family-owned operations trying to do the same thing.\n\nThey built their first rental home in 2018 by placing two shipping containers side by side and setting a third container on top, with the third facing the opposite direction. The three-bedroom, two-bathroom home has a rooftop patio, hot tub, full kitchen, and access to 18.5 acres of land.\n\n\"As soon as we built The OG, we were booked 100% every night for two years, and we booked out in advance a year,\" Seth said. \"We quickly realized we needed to increase the supply just to try to keep up with the demand.\"\n\nBuilding more vacation rentals in Hocking Hills was a natural step, but Emily and Seth also set their sights on new horizons: North Carolina and Michigan. The couple purchased the properties in 2021 and 2022, respectively.\n\n\"We're dreamers and were ready to jump into the next thing headfirst,\" Emily said.\n\nPreparing to scale took several steps, including applying for a loan, purchasing the properties, and gaining approval to move forward with the projects. While most business owners might have cheered and gone full steam into the expansion, Seth and Emily hesitated.\n\n\"The only thing that stopped us was the fact that the interest rates were so high,\" Emily said. \"It would almost be a wash for the business. There wasn't a lot of profit there, so it would have to run extremely lean, and it would not be for a huge amount of return.\"\n\nPlus, Emily and Seth live in Ohio, meaning they would likely have to pay other companies to maintain their properties, squeezing the budget and profits even more.\n\nWhen business owners get caught at a crossroad like this, Seth said it's important to start with the question \"why?\"\n\n\"Is it just to make more money? What's the point? \" Seth asked.\n\nAs enticing as branching out seemed, they ultimately sold the North Carolina property in 2023 and the Michigan property in 2025.\n\n\"We were super proud that we got it that far and had the option to continue, but in order to pace properly and not bite off more than we could chew, we said, 'Okay, it's not the time for that approach. We're in a critical time to save and profit.'\"\n\nAlthough Emily and Seth stepped back from those two projects, they've continued to push The Box Hop forward.\n\n\"People always joke about rentals being passive income. It's not passive, but there's a lot of freedom, fun, and beauty in what we do. She's stuck with me all the time, so it's been good,\" Seth said, referring to Emily.\n\nIn addition to more vacation rentals, the couple now wants to offer their interior design and construction services to short-term rental owners across the country.\n\n\"We have a business partner that we've been working tirelessly for two years to figure out how do we take The Box Holp and expand it,\" Emily said. \"People from all over the nation and all over the world are saying, 'How do we get one of these?'\"\n\nShe added: \"We'll play more of the middleman role by bringing all of the pieces of the puzzle together and figuring out how to do it.\"\n\nManaging their business is a full-time job, but Emily and Seth wouldn't want it any other way.\n\n\"My workweek now is a heck of a lot harder than it was working 40 hours a week in a manufacturing facility, but we have more freedom,\" Seth said. \"We're not missing our kids' sporting events, and we're able to be present. That's been huge.\"",

    "fullText": "Being the ultimate sports fan doesn't come with a warning label, but maybe it should. Cheering on your favorite team can cause severe mood swings, violent outbursts, and even, at times, tightness in your chest. It's why I'm a fair-weather fan.\n\nThere's a backstory: I used to have a team. As a Baltimore native, when the Ravens came to our city in 1996, I was all in. After buying tons of black and purple, winning two Super Bowls, and then white knuckling through the lackluster seasons that followed, I decided to set a boundary for my own sanity.\n\nFor me, and the bold, ambiguous fans like me, being a fair-weather fan isn't about disloyalty; it's a form of self-care. It's choosing which stressors I'm letting get to me — and football was no longer one of them.\n\nGloria Chan Packer, who helps ambitious professionals manage stress and burnout in the workplace, writes in an essay for BI that \"we can't eradicate stress entirely,\" but advises that we should aim \"to establish a healthier and more sustainable relationship with your stress.\"\n\nSo yes, I've decided to protect my peace while still respecting the game and showing up when it matters most. It won't be this Sunday when the Seattle Seahawks face off against the New England Patriots in Super Bowl LX, but guess who's not stressed about that? Me.",

    "description": "Harry Luu explains how he left academia to build a business selling rare plants, supporting a family of eight through data-driven decisions.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Harry Luu, owner of PlantZaddyTherapy. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI've always been a gardener and enjoyed being around plants. While I was in graduate school studying math, my collection of houseplants grew. There's an attention to detail and a hyperfocus that I found in both mathematics and plants, so my hobby complemented my academic career.\n\nDuring the pandemic, my interest in rare plants blew up. I started getting a bigger collection and trading up for more valuable plants.\n\nEventually, my hobby transformed into a business. I finished my graduate degree and started teaching math in California, but three years ago, I left academia to sell plants full-time.\n\nI grew up in Vietnam, and I'm the embodiment of the American dream for my family. They put all their eggs in my basket, which allowed me to come to America and study. Now, I feel it's fair to return their investment. I support not only myself and my husband, but also my parents, my brother, my sister-in-law, my niece, and my nephew.\n\nLeaving my job while supporting a family of eight in California might seem risky, but it was calculated. I had reached the point where I saw the potential for financial freedom from investments I had made during grad school that had very good returns. I had years of data on plant sales, and also knew I could return to academia if needed, so I had a safety net.\n\nI was already connected to the rare plant community, so selling increasingly expensive plants felt like a natural progression. I grew my platform on Palmstreet, an online marketplace.\n\nThis year, I had two record-breaking sales in one day. I sold a $16,000 plant (an Anthurium Variegated Forgetii x Heinz, one of only two in the world), then a $26,000 plant (the only specimen of the True Variegated Lux Albo Mother Plant).\n\nI'm a math person, so I use a formula to price. I calculate rarity and desirability and compare them with price data from the previous three years. These plants were both very rare and highly desirable, which drove prices up. However, I didn't want to price them too high, because I'm thinking about the long-term viability for my brand: people have to be able to purchase what I'm selling. Given how rare the plants were, their five-figure prices weren't too big a splash.\n\nDespite those big numbers, the business's income fluctuates dramatically. My best single week was over $200,000 in sales, but other weeks I might have no sales. The market is seasonal, and winter is slow. I've had to adapt to not having a steady, reliable income.\n\nThe money comes and goes, but the work never stops. Right now, I spend about 100 hours a week on the business. We have plants in our home, and also a large greenhouse on our property. My brother does some of the maintenance care for the plants, but all the breeding decisions are made by me.\n\nI'm on the cusp of the company being able to sustain itself without me working so much. I look forward to that — when I can step back from the business side and focus more on the joy of growing. I would like to share my knowledge about rare plants and take the plants on the road to connect with my community more, since that's what got me hooked on growing in the first place.",

    "title": "Taylor Swift's latest business move is another attempt to hack the charts — and it'll probably work",
    "description": "Taylor Swift is temporarily withholding the \"Opalite\" music video from YouTube. The unconventional move is a reaction to new Billboard chart rules.",
    "fullText": "Taylor Swift is the biggest-selling artist in the world by most reliable measures, so when she makes an unconventional business move — no matter how random or trivial it may appear — it's worth paying attention.\n\nOn Friday, Swift unveiled the self-directed music video for \"Opalite,\" her latest single from \"The Life of a Showgirl.\" Upon release, the cameo-laden clip was available exclusively on Spotify and Apple Music, with its YouTube premiere scheduled for a two-day delay.\n\nStreamers like Spotify and Apple Music specialize in hosting songs, albums, podcasts, and playlists — not visual works. Meanwhile, YouTube is famously a destination for music video lovers. So what gives?\n\nAs usual, when it comes to Swift, the answer seems to lie with her bottom line. In December, YouTube announced it would withdraw its streaming data from Billboard's chart formulas because the music company tweaked its methodology so that streams from YouTube subscribers were weighted even more heavily than free streams. YouTube's stance is that the ratio is unfair to fans.\n\nSwift recently scored her longest reign yet on the Billboard Hot 100 with \"The Fate of Ophelia,\" the lead single from \"Showgirl,\" which charted at No. 1 for 10 weeks. With \"Opalite\" officially serving as its follow-up, Swift appears to be making moves to boost the song's chart performance.\n\nIf fans were flocking to YouTube today to watch her new music video, none of those views would help \"Opalite\" reach No. 1 — and nobody wants to follow a personal best with a personal flop, least of all an athlete-style competitor like Swift.\n\nOf course, this savvy tweak to the song's promo schedule was paired with a physical release: a seven-inch vinyl single in \"pearlescent blue,\" only available in Swift's online store for 48 hours.\n\nSwift's unyielding commitment to commerce isn't just something to behold. It's something to study. Swift's sales tactics often become instructive for other artists.\n\nMuch has been made about Swift's push to sell physical albums, for example, but many fellow pop stars have followed suit. Charli XCX released about two dozen vinyl variants for her 2024 album \"Brat\" and its deluxe editions. Sabrina Carpenter, a self-professed disciple of Swift's work, released 13 vinyl variants last year for \"Man's Best Friend,\" in addition to seven-inch singles, cassettes, and CDs. As a result, \"Man's Best Friend\" scored the ninth-biggest vinyl sales week of the modern era, according to Billboard. (Seven of the top eight slots on that list belong to albums by Swift.)\n\nSo, it could very well mean that Swift's strategic video rollout will start a trend as well. Although YouTube is the customary platform for music videos, customs can be changed, and she isn't the only artist who cares about climbing the charts.\n\nIt could also be that Swift's premiere delay will inspire YouTube to rethink its attitude toward Billboard. If one of the most influential celebrities in the world is delaying their content to your product, that could be bad for business — and it wouldn't be the first time Swift convinced a major company to change its tune. Back in 2015, she criticized Apple Music for refusing to pay artists during a new user's free trial. Within 24 hours, Apple updated its policy and tagged Swift in the announcement online.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether \"Opalite\" will affect the music industry beyond Swifties, but if the song's lyrics are any indication, Swift is content to manufacture success on her terms — or, in her words, to make her own sunshine.",

    "description": "After co-creating Amazon Alexa, William Tunstall-Pedoe became an angel investor. When he started his second business, he drew on the invaluable experience of his mentees.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with William Tunstall-Pedoe, 56, an angel investor and founder based in the UK. This piece has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nIn 2012, I sold my first startup, Evi, to Amazon. It later became Alexa.\n\nThat gave me the capital to invest in the next generation of startups when I left Amazon in 2016. I leaned into that opportunity, becoming both a mentor and a very active angel investor.\n\nIt was one of the best experiences I've had for career development, because I saw almost every situation that a startup can encounter, both good and bad.\n\nWhen I left Amazon, I suddenly found myself with an empty calendar.\n\nI wanted to take a break — six months or so — but I still needed to do something with my days. My calendar filled up faster than I expected.\n\nI started saying yes to things I would have turned down while working at Amazon. I was invited to a party in San Francisco, which is a long way to go when you live in the UK, but I went anyway. I booked a hotel for a couple of weeks and let my time fill up with meetings and other activities.\n\nThe year I left Amazon, 2016, turned out to be a really extraordinary time for me, when I traveled a lot and did some very interesting things.\n\nOne of those was being invited to help the Creative Destruction Lab, a seed-stage program for scalable science and technology-based ventures, founded in 2012 by economists at the University of Toronto's Rotman School of Management.\n\nThe premise was simple: mentors who successfully launched companies, like me, provided startups with expertise. Every few months, the mentors and startups would meet to set clear objectives for the next stage of development.\n\nIt was a bit like the \"Weakest Link.\" We'd cut companies, sometimes if they'd fallen short of their goals, at each meeting. Over the course of about nine months, the cohort would narrow, and mentor time and resources would be focused on fewer and fewer businesses.\n\nI did this for about six years. I would fly back and forward from London to Toronto every few months, making angel investments in dozens of promising companies, and for another two years when the program moved to the University of Oxford in 2019.\n\nAround the same time, I became involved with Cambridge Angels, an invite-only network of experienced investors, which gave me exposure to a wide range of early-stage companies and investors.\n\nI knew I wanted to be a founder again one day, but waiting turned out to be the right decision. My time as a mentor and angel investor was great preparation.\n\nWhen I founded my second startup, UnlikelyAI, in 2019, the experience was very different from the first time. I still made mistakes and ran into problems, but I was no longer a novice founder with no support.\n\nThis time, I had the capital to fund the business myself for a while. When I later raised a friends-and-family round, it was largely made up of prominent angel investors I'd met through mentoring and angel investing.\n\nAs a second-time founder, not only did I have a decade of experience from my first startup, but I also had something to complement it: the invaluable, vicarious experience of mentoring hundreds of other startups.",

    "description": "The new A380 business class is an example of how Lufthansa is keeping the world's largest passenger plane competitive amid widebody shortages.",
    "fullText": "Lufthansa is doubling down on a jet that many thought was history.\n\nThe German flag carrier announced Friday that it will install a new business-class cabin on all eight of its Airbus A380 superjumbos as part of its broader multibillion-dollar fleet renewal.\n\nAirlines are racing to meet growing demand for high-dollar premium experiences on long-haul flights. The new A380 business class will deliver an upgrade over the current layout, with more space, modern technology, and aisle access for all passengers.\n\nHowever, it will not be part of Allegris, Lufthansa's new signature economy and premium cabins rolling out across its old Boeing 747-8s and newly delivered Boeing 787s and Airbus A350s.\n\nLufthansa said the A380 seat, from manufacturer Thompson Aero, was chosen strategically because it is already certified for the jet type. Allegris is not, and using it would require a separate, lengthy certification process.\n\nThat means Lufthansa can quickly retrofit the A380 planes and get them back in the air. The project is expected to start in February, with the first refreshed jet returning to service in April.\n\nThe move comes as airlines face delayed deliveries of next-generation widebodies — particularly the Airbus A350-1000 and the yet-to-be-certified Boeing 777X — creating a crunch in long-haul, money-making capacity.\n\nA company spokesperson told Business Insider that Lufthansa's A380 refurbishment was planned well in advance and isn't a direct response to shifting delivery timelines.\n\n\"Lufthansa is investing in an aircraft that has already been in scheduled service for several years,\" he said. \"Nevertheless, we always want to offer our guests a modern and high-quality cabin product.\"\n\nStill, Lufthansa has repeatedly delayed retiring its A380s.\n\nIt considered ditching the jet after COVID halted travel (six aircraft were permanently removed from the fleet), but a strong post-pandemic rebound brought some planes back from storage and pushed the retirement of the remaining A380s to 2026.\n\nIt now has at least another five years. Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr said in October 2025 that the A380s will continue flying into the early 2030s as the airline awaits new widebodies.\n\nLufthansa is the expected launch customer for Boeing's 777X, now expected to be at least seven years late in 2027 due to production and certification issues. The airline has also faced delivery delays for the 787 and A350.\n\nCarriers like Dubai-based Emirates, Australian flag carrier Qantas, and British Airways are similarly keeping older planes flying longer as they await new planes — including refurbishing the A380 with expensive new economy and premium cabins.\n\nData from the aviation analytics firm Cirium shows roughly 91,500 A380 flights are scheduled for 2026, about 1,500 more than in 2025. That uptick comes after the number of A380 flights plunged from about 120,000 in 2019 to just under 14,000 in 2021.\n\nThis increase comes despite the A380's inefficiencies. Its four fuel-hungry engines make it costly to operate, its size limits the number of airports it can serve, and its roughly 500 seats are challenging to consistently fill. While a few ultra-high-demand routes can justify the capacity, it doesn't work across an entire network.\n\nAirlines are also increasingly favoring smaller, more flexible twin-engine widebodies that can better adjust to fluctuating demand and efficiently serve both point-to-point routes — nonstops that don't go through a mega hub — and traditional hub-and-spoke networks.\n\nAirbus ultimately ended A380 production in 2021.\n\nLufthansa's A380s presently feature a 2-2-2 business-class layout, which forces window-seat passengers to climb over a neighbor to reach the aisle — a frustration for travelers paying a premium for privacy and flexibility beyond what economy offers.\n\nRenderings show the new cabin will switch to a 1-2-1 layout, giving every passenger direct aisle access. The design also adds Bluetooth connectivity, privacy partitions, and a lie-flat bed longer than six feet when the seat is fully reclined.\n\nOnce retrofitted, the A380 will feature eight seats in first class, 68 in business, 52 in premium economy, and 371 in regular coach.\n\nThe cabin won't have sliding doors, double beds, or big front-row suites — features that have become increasingly popular across the industry and are included on certain Allegris seats.\n\nThat added complexity, however, has slowed Allegris' rollout. The cabin includes multiple seat types and configurations within a single aircraft and has not yet been certified for the 787.\n\nAs a result, some Dreamliners are currently flying with business-class seats blocked from sale while Lufthansa awaits regulatory approval, limiting premium-cabin capacity and revenue.",

    "description": "Gary Marcus advocates caution about AI's risks. He told Business Insider that using OpenClaw was like giving your passwords to a stranger at the bar.",
    "fullText": "AI researcher and author Gary Marcus is worried about those viral agents and their social network.\n\nAnimated lobsters flooded X last week. First, it was OpenClaw (previously called Moltbot and Clawdbot before Anthropic came knocking). The AI agent runs locally and can independently make decisions on common consumer apps without human supervision.\n\nThen came Moltbook, the Reddit-like social forum where AI agents post and comment. No humans are allowed — though it appears some humans may have managed to sneak their way in.\n\nMarcus is known to pour cold water on the most hot-headed AI fanatics. It's in the title of his book: \"Taming Silicon Valley.\" The entrepreneur and scientist founded Geometric Intelligence, a machine-learning startup he later sold to Uber. Now, he advocates for AI regulation and risk consideration.\n\nHis take on these new tools was no different. In a Substack post, he was blunt. \"If you care about the security of your device or the privacy of your data, don't use OpenClaw,\" he wrote. \"Period.\"\n\nCurious to hear more about his thoughts on the latest viral moment in AI, we followed up with Marcus over email for a short Q&A, which was lightly edited for clarity.\n\nHere's what he had to say about those AI agents popping up everywhere.\n\nLet's start with OpenClaw. When did you first run into it, and what was your reaction?\n\nI think it was called something different then, oh so many days ago (seven?). My immediate reaction is, this is just like AutoGPT and it will be a complete security disaster if it becomes popular. Maybe, if we are lucky, it will become a teachable moment and the damage will be modest.\n\nWhy do you think OpenClaw grew so popular (at least online)?\n\nI imagine it is super fun to play with, and it must make users feel like they have an express ticket to the future. Personally I wouldn't touch it.\n\nYou compare OpenClaw to AutoGPT. How are they similar and different?\n\nThey are both basically connectors between LLMs and services. The underlying LLMs are better now than in 2023, but the security risks are roughly the same: immense. It's like giving full access to your computer and all your passwords to a guy you met at a bar who says he can help you out. Yeah, maybe.\n\nIs there any secure use of OpenClaw? What about those who have already set it up — what should they do?\n\nI doubt there is any real secure use. Personally I would stop running it and try to uninstall it and change passwords for banks and things like that.\n\nOpenClaw creator Peter Steinberger said he's taken steps to make it more secure. (Here's one example.) What do you think of these efforts?\n\nNoble, but maybe like putting a finger in dike to hold off a flood?\n\nMoving to Moltbook. Is there any argument to set your agent live on the site?\n\nOn TBPN, Matt Schlicht made the argument that startups should build businesses \"on top of Moltbook.\" What do you think of his proposal?\n\nGood luck to you. Don't blame me if your customer base gets scammed because of prompt injection attack you didn't notice.\n\nMeta's CTO, Andrew Bosworth, said that he didn't find Moltbook interesting, because these agents were trained to speak like humans. Thoughts?\n\nFacebook did actually have some related experiments years and years ago; he's right that we shouldn't be entirely surprised. The interest comes mostly from the scale.\n\nWill we be talking about Moltbook in two weeks, or is this just another meme cycle?\n\nI don't know. AutoGPT exploded like a rocket in March 2023 and faded because of issues around reliability and accuracy; I wouldn't be surprised if this is just another fad, like Sora videos or pet rocks. But we'll see.",

    "title": "Tech stack is a business decision",
    "description": "Why tech stack choices should be driven by business context and constraints—not framework preferences—and why this matters even more with agentic coding tools.",
    "fullText": "Developers love to argue about tech stacks.\n\nFlutter vs React Native.\n\nNative vs cross-platform.\n\nJava vs Ruby vs C#.\n\nReact vs Angular.\n\nRiverpod vs Bloc.\n\nDrift vs Hive.\n\nThese debates can go arbitrarily deep, down to library-level choices that have little impact on whether a product succeeds or fails.\n\nEveryone has preferences, and that’s fine. Preferences come from experience. Someone who started with strongly typed languages will value compiler guarantees and explicitness. Someone who started with dynamic languages will value flexibility and speed. Both viewpoints are internally consistent.\n\nWhat they are not is universally correct.\n\nThere is no hard data that can rank one stack as objectively “better” across all contexts. Teams, constraints, markets, and goals differ too much. Most arguments rely on anecdotes, and anecdotes do not generalize.\n\nSo if preference is not a reliable guide, how should a tech stack be chosen?\n\nThis question is often interpreted at the feature or use-case level. That misses the point.\n\nIn almost all non-hobby software, the problem being solved is a business problem.\n\nIf there is no business, no users, no revenue, then the software is irrelevant. It may be elegant or technically impressive, but it has no economic value. Software only matters insofar as it supports a business outcome.\n\nThat framing matters because it establishes the correct hierarchy.\n\nTechnology is not the goal.\n\nTechnology is a tool.\n\nAnd tools are chosen based on the job they need to do.\n\nEarly on, nobody knows whether the business will work.\n\nYou don’t know if users care. You don’t know if they will pay. You don’t know if the problem is real or imagined.\n\nAt this stage, obsessing over the “right” stack is misplaced effort. The dominant constraint is uncertainty, not scalability or architectural purity.\n\n“The FIRST rule of enterprenuership is you use what you have” - Alex Hormozi\n\nThis is simple rule of entrepreneurship applies surprisingly well to engineering.\n\nFounders and early teams start with what they already know. Not because it is theoretically optimal, but because it minimizes friction. Familiar tools reduce cognitive overhead, increase speed, and allow faster learning.\n\nEarly success is rarely determined by technical elegance. It is determined by whether you can ship something people want before you run out of time or money.\n\nAs the business grows, the constraints change.\n\nRevenue appears.\n\nUsers depend on the system.\n\nThe team grows.\n\nThe cost of failure increases.\n\nNow the stack begins to matter more. Not because some technologies are inherently superior, but because the software must support new business realities. Hiring, onboarding, operational cost, maintainability, performance characteristics, and risk management all become relevant.\n\nThis is where teams often conclude that an early stack choice was “wrong.” In most cases, it wasn’t wrong. It was right for the phase the business was in. The mistake was assuming it would remain right indefinitely.\n\nTwitch is often mentioned as a scaling story, but the more interesting part is how long the architecture stayed simple.\n\nAt one point, Twitch was serving millions of users with a monolithic Ruby on Rails application and a single PostgreSQL database. That setup was not elegant or future proof, but it worked. It allowed the team to move quickly, ship features, and grow the business without adding unnecessary complexity.\n\nOver time, the constraints changed. Growth amplified failures. Database contention increased. Reliability, support load, and churn started to matter more than raw development speed. The cost of incidents became visible in a way it had not been before.\n\nThat was when the architecture began to evolve. The database was scaled and restructured, services were split out, and new infrastructure and languages were introduced. None of this happened because the original stack was flawed. It happened because the business had outgrown it.\n\nThe technology changed in response to the business, not the other way around.\n\nIf you want to read more about how Twitch migrated from a monolith to microservices, see Breaking the Monolith at Twitch and Breaking the Monolith at Twitch: Part Two.\n\nIf you want to know more about how Twitch scaled its database, see How Twitch Uses PostgreSQL.\n\nAgentic coding tools make this even more important.\n\nTools like Claude Code and Cursor reduce the advantage of deep, framework-specific familiarity. Generating boilerplate, navigating unfamiliar code, applying patterns across modules, and keeping implementation consistent are no longer manual, error-prone tasks.\n\nWhen an agent can help you stay productive across technologies, the cost of switching or extending a stack drops. What remains expensive is not syntax or APIs, but domain knowledge, product decisions, and the long-term behavior of the system.\n\nIn other words, the more the tooling levels the technical playing field, the more tech stack decisions become about business fit.\n\nInstead of asking whether one technology is better than another in the abstract, ask questions that reflect the reality of the business:\n\nWhat are we optimizing for right now? Speed, cost, reliability, hiring, or time-to-market?\n\nHow quickly do we need to validate this idea?\n\nHow expensive will change be later, and what changes are most likely?\n\nWhat kind of team will maintain this system?\n\nWhat risks could realistically kill the business, and does the stack reduce or increase them?\n\nOnce framed this way, stack decisions become clearer and less emotional. Sometimes multiple choices are equally valid. Sometimes the boring option is correct. Sometimes speed matters more than correctness. Sometimes correctness matters more than speed.\n\nThere is no universal answer. The answer depends on the context.\n\nMost tech stack arguments are debates about taste, not outcomes.\n\nOnce technology is treated as a business decision rather than a personal identity, those arguments lose their intensity. The question stops being “what do I prefer?” and becomes “what does the business need right now?”\n\nThe right stack is not the one that wins debates.\n\nIt is the one that helps the business survive and grow at its current stage.\n\nIf are starting a project and need help with tech stack decision, connect with me on LinkedIn and I’ll take it from there.\n\nSoftware Developer specializing in Flutter, Android, and mobile development.\n Writing about code, architecture, and developer productivity.",

    "fullText": "Pizza Hut plans to close several of its locations this year due to underperformance, company officials said.\n\nAccording to executives at the restaurant’s parent company, Yum! Brands, about 250 locations are expected to close, officials announced during an earnings call on Feb. 4.\n\nThe shutdowns are part of the company’s “Hut Forward” strategy, which Pizza Hut Chief Financial Officer Ron Ricks said on the earnings call is expected to shrink the brand’s global footprint and reduce operating profits by about 15%.\n\nThe company has not said whether any Texas locations will be affected.\n\nAccording to the Pizza Hut website, there are 974 locations in Texas.\n\nThe closures are also tied to a broader “strategic review” announced by Yum! Brands in November, which could include a potential sale of the chain. Beyond confirming the closures, officials said they would not provide additional details until the review concludes at the end of 2026.\n\n\"Pizza Hut’s performance indicates the need to take additional action to help the brand realize its full value, which may be better executed outside of Yum! Brands,” CEO Chris Turner said in a statement. “To truly take advantage of the brand we’ve built and the opportunities ahead, we’ve made the decision to initiate a thorough review of strategic options.”",

    "description": "The rivaling AI companies pushed GPT-5.3-Codex and Claude Opus 4.6, and had back-to-back appearances on a tech and business podcast.",
    "fullText": "The rivalry between OpenAI and Anthropic intensified this week.\n\nThe two companies released dueling new AI models on Thursday and had back-to-back podcast appearances on \"TBPN.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Anthropic unveiled Claude Opus 4.6, an upgraded model that the company says would improve performance on office productivity and coding tasks, with an expanded \"context window\" that allows it to work through longer documents and more complex projects in a single session.\n\nMeanwhile, OpenAI punched back with its own new coding-focused model called GPT-5.3-Codex, which the company says runs faster, uses fewer computing resources, and can generate and manage complex software from English instructions. The new version also comes alongside a stand-alone Codex desktop app.\n\nBoth Sam Altman, the OpenAI CEO, and Sholto Douglas, one of Anthropic's leading researchers, appeared on the \"TBPN\" podcast in back-to-back chats with show host John Coogan and Jordi Hays.\n\n\"I think we will be heading towards a workflow where a lot of people just feel like they're managing a team of agents,\" said Altman. \"And as the agents get better, they'll keep operating at a higher and higher level of abstraction.\"\n\nDouglas, who appeared in the subsequent timeslot, told Coogan and Hays that users have been comparing previous Anthropic and OpenAI models, and they have noticed some key differences.\n\n\"The OpenAI models were a bit better at trying really, really, really hard on tough problems, but the Anthropic models were much faster and so forth,\" Douglas said.\n\n\"And so they worked on speed while we worked on making the models much, much better at really, really tough problems,\" Douglas added of the Opus 4.6.\n\nThe latest release is part of a long-running competition between Anthropic and OpenAI, dating back to 2021, when a group of OpenAI researchers left to form Anthropic, aiming to develop safer and more controlled AI systems.\n\nThis week, Anthropic's launch of industry-specific plugins triggered a stock market sell-off as Wall Street worried about AI's impact on software.\n\nAnthropic also took a subtle shot at OpenAI with a series of ads released this week, including one that will air during the Super Bowl.\n\nThe ads feature unnamed humanized AIs dropping ads in the middle of their advice, alongside the promise that its model, Claude, will remain ad-free.\n\nOpenAI announced in January that ads are coming to ChatGPT for users of the free version.\n\nAltman subsequently hit back, calling Anthropic \"dishonest\" and defending ChatGPT as a product that brings AI \"to billions of people who can't pay for subscriptions.\" He also clarified that the ads will be \"clearly labeled\" to differentiate themselves from the chatbot's answers to queries.\n\n\"We are not stupid. We respect our users. We understand that if we did something like what those ads depict, people would rightfully stop using the product,\" Altman told the \"TBPN\" podcast on Thursday.\n\n\"Our first principle with ads is that we're not going to put stuff into the LLM stream,\" Altman added. \"That would feel crazy dystopic, like a bad sci-fi movie.\"",

    "fullText": "Taiwanese airline Starlux is set to fly a new Airbus A350 variant that will expand its number of business-class seats by over 50%.\n\nThe seven-year-old startup is introducing 18 new A350-1000s to its fleet, with the first delivered in January.\n\nIts A350-1000 configuration offers 40 business-class seats, up from 26 on Starlux's current A350-900s.\n\nThe new aircraft adds 30 economy-class seats, bringing the total to 270 in coach. The rest of its A350-1000 offerings are unchanged from the A350-900, with 36 premium economy seats and four first-class suites.\n\nStarlux showcased its new plane at the Singapore Airshow this week, and Business Insider went aboard for a look.\n\nIt's known regionally for selling business-class tickets on short and medium-haul flights at roughly $1,500.\n\nSome of its longer routes, such as San Francisco to Taipei, can offer regular round-trip business-class fares as low as $2,600.\n\nSince launching flights in 2020, the Taiwanese airline has increasingly leaned on premium seat offerings, a trend among full-service carriers as market prices for economy seats have generally fallen.\n\nThe light under the passenger seat number changes from green to red when do-not-disturb mode is activated.\n\nCabin crew typically open and close the doors for passengers, but an emergency latch on the inside also allows the sliding panel to come loose.\n\nEssentially, that means the seat elevates the head and feet over the rear for better posture, so the passenger's body resembles a \"W.\"\n\nIf a passenger has two windows next to their seat, they can dim the second with a remote.\n\nThese seats have no overhead luggage compartments; instead, they feature a personal closet for each passenger. They're lined with leather, while business class seats are made of fabric.\n\nThere is no curtain or wall separating Starlux's business and first-class areas.\n\nIn-flight entertainment is available for every seat, with an extendable screen for those sitting in the front rows.\n\nChatting with a passenger across the aisle may prove more difficult on the A350-1000.\n\nThe new plane is also scheduled to begin flying Starlux's Phoenix route this summer. Starlux flies to 31 destinations, with five routes to the US.",

    "description": "Bosch's North America president told Business Insider the Super Bowl ad is part of a strategy to grow awareness and sales in the US.",
    "fullText": "Bosch has been in the US for more than a century, yet it remains a surprisingly fuzzy brand for many American consumers. The German industrial heavyweight is betting that the \"Mayor of Flavortown,\" Guy Fieri, can help change that as it pours billions of dollars into the region.\n\nOn Thursday, Bosch released the ad it intends to air during the Super Bowl this weekend. It stars a remarkably different clean-shaven, conservatively dressed Fieri, who returns to his normal spiky-haired, brightly colored look when he uses Bosch products — from a circular saw to a cooktop. His French Bulldog, Cash, also has a cameo in the ad, which carries the tagline, \"Like a Bosch.\"\n\nBosch joins a crop of Super Bowl LX advertisers leaning on comedy and recognizable faces this year, as they look to grab attention and avoid controversy during a politically charged year. Major brands are spending more than ever on A-list celebrity talent in their marketing, with CMOs under pressure to produce ads that cut through and deliver meaningful results.\n\nSpeaking to Business Insider, Paul Thomas, president of Bosch North America, said the company hopes the big game ad will help improve its brand recognition. Through Fieri and the lighthearted, comedic tone of this year's spot, Bosch also wants to foster a stronger emotional connection between customers and the brand, he added. It marks a shift from Bosch's more traditional marketing, which typically focused on technical features.\n\n\"There are a lot of things we're trying to accomplish with the campaign, but primarily to show that the Bosch brand is something you can rely on and helps you improve your life,\" Thomas said.\n\nFieri was a \"no-brainer\" to help achieve these goals because he cooks and does his own construction, often using Bosch products.\n\n\"He represents the confidence, too,\" Thomas said.\n\nSuch was Fieri's transformation for this campaign that some social media users lambasted the celebrity chef's early teaser posts as \"AI slop.\" Bosch said it didn't use AI and instead relied on a makeup artist and some visual effects editing.\n\nA post shared by Guy Fieri (@guyfieri)\n\nBosch is working toward a goal of North America contributing 20% of the company's global sales by 2030, up from around 18% in 2024. It's doubling down on certain categories — such as cordless power tools and home appliances — where Bosch lags rivals in market share. The company has announced more than $6 billion in US-based acquisitions since 2023.\n\nIts big push in the US comes as the company cuts costs elsewhere. Bosch recently confirmed it is cutting 20,000 jobs in Germany after its profits nearly halved last year. The industrial giant is facing competition from Chinese companies in its automotive business, as well as pressures from US tariffs and a decline in demand for household appliances.\n\nThe average price of a 30-second spot during this year's Super Bowl reached $8 million, with some slots fetching up to $10 million, per NBCUniversal, which is broadcasting the game. Thomas said the expenditure on the Super Bowl amid cost-cutting within its home business reflected the balance many companies need to make as they focus on growth.\n\n\"If you don't have a brand campaign, do the problems get even worse in the future?\" Thomas said.\n\nBosch made its Super Bowl ad debut last year and saw \"tangible lifts\" in consumer engagement, such as people entering hardware and appliance stores to specifically ask for Bosch products, he said.\n\n\"It would really be a pity if you did it once and didn't continue on with it because then you lose all the momentum that you could gain,\" he said.",

This was not an issue for Amazon’s October earnings, as its shares jumped almost 10% following better than expected revenue from Amazon Web Services, also known as AWS. Now, however, fear is rippling through the tech sector, and Amazon investors are increasingly concerned that the slowdown at Microsoft’s Azure indicates broader weakness for cloud providers. Microsoft shares are down 14% since the report on Jan. 28, erasing more than $500 billion in market value.",

    "title": "Taco Bell's CEO says the chain's 'magic formula' is fueling growth as rivals fall flat",
    "description": "Taco Bell CEO Sean Tresvant told Business Insider that the chain's advantage lies in strong value perception, menu innovation, and customer loyalty.",
    "fullText": "Taco Bell CEO Sean Tresvant has a simple explanation for why his brand keeps winning while much of the fast-food industry is struggling: it's doing more than one thing well at once.\n\n\"When you look at being a buzzy brand, you look at value, you look at digital, you look at category entry points and innovation, and all those things are working in concert with each other,\" Tresvant told Business Insider. \"Other brands can do one or two. When we do it, we get all four right, and we're very good in each part of that magic formula.\"\n\nYum! Brands, Taco Bell's parent company, announced during its earnings report on Wednesday that the Mexican-inspired chain delivered 7% same-store sales growth in the fourth quarter, far outpacing the rest of the segment as consumers continue to pull back on dining out.\n\nWhile much of the fast-food industry is grappling with slowing traffic as customers watch their wallets, Taco Bell's growth was driven by bigger-ticket transactions, especially among younger diners, even as competitors relied heavily on discounting.\n\nFoot-traffic data backs that up. A Placer.ai analysis of Yum Brands' fourth-quarter performance found that Taco Bell locations held up better than many quick-service competitors during key value-driven periods, even as broader fast-food visits softened amid inflation fatigue.\n\nTresvant says Taco Bell's advantage comes from combining the things competitors often struggle to balance: offering consistently good value rather than short-term deals, rapid-fire menu innovation, and a growing loyalty program that's actually driving incremental visits. That formula, he told Business Insider, has allowed Taco Bell to keep growing traffic and relevance \"in any environment,\" even as other fast-food brands fight simply to stay flat.\n\nTaco Bell's numbers reflect its loyalty push. Tresvant said active loyalty members climbed 31% in the fourth quarter, while digital channels grew 29%, as app-exclusive drops and rewards nudged customers to visit more often. Tresvant said the goal isn't just engagement, but turning loyalty into repeat traffic — which keeps the brand resilient.\n\nAlthough value-focused options now make up 17% of Taco Bell's menu, like its $5, $7, and $9 bundle offerings, what especially appeals to Taco Bell consumers is its pace of menu innovation — even when they're full price. From the return of its Quesarito and recent launch of its sauce collaboration with Frank's RedHot, to limited-time beverage offerings at its Live Más Café locations, every new rollout, Tresvant said, is \"determined on consumer needs and wants.\"\n\nAcross the restaurant industry, traditional quick-service strategies aren't working as they once did because of the uneven pressure of the K-shaped economy, where lower-income consumers have pulled back on dining out while higher-income spending remains stable.\n\nMany chains have leaned hard into deep discounting and short-term deals to lure customers back, but analysts and industry executives warn that constant promotions can erode pricing power and fail to drive meaningful traffic growth.\n\nAt the same time, competitors like Chipotle are recalibrating for smaller, wealthier consumer segments, underscoring how uneven the recovery has been across the sector.\n\nThat's not the strategy for Taco Bell. Instead of narrowing its focus, the chain has leaned on loyalty perks and app-exclusive offers to keep a broad range of customers coming back — particularly younger diners who are more likely to engage digitally even as they cut costs elsewhere.\n\n\"We continue to innovate on the menu, but not only on the menu,\" Tresvant added. \"We're going to make sure we're innovating from a guest hospitality standpoint, we're going to innovate in operations and innovate around the brand, not just in food.\"\n\nThat means continued exploration of voice AI ordering systems, which are being tested at 600 Taco Bell locations, as well as other efficiency-optimizing technologies to streamline back-of-house operations and improve the guest experience.\n\nIt also means giving consumers new ways to stay connected to the Taco Bell brand, like its Y2K-era cross-brand collaboration with Hollister, which sold out late last year.\n\nFor Tresvant, that momentum has created rare room to experiment at a time when much of the fast-food industry is still focused on defense.\n\n\"The things we're doing are working, and that just gives us a little bit of permission to take big swings in 2026,\" Tresvant said.",

    "title": "Software ate the world. Now AI is eating software.",
    "description": "What was once a stable and profitable tech business now faces an existential question: What happens if AI tools and agents replace business software?",
    "fullText": "In 2011, venture capitalist Marc Andreessen declared \"software is eating the world.\" Today, AI is beginning to devour software.\n\nInstead of helping the industry improve, new AI tools and agents could end up replacing some software products entirely.\n\nThis anxiety crystallized in recent weeks with three developments: Anthropic's release of a new autonomous AI agent called Cowork, the launch of industry-specific Cowork plugins, and the rise of OpenClaw, an open-source AI assistant spreading rapidly through messaging apps.\n\n\"Is this the end for software?\" Raimo Lenshow, a veteran tech analyst at Barclays, wrote in a recent note to investors. \"The current situation in software feels very unique with the large overhang of how AI will impact the space in the long-run.\"\n\nToday, companies get stuff done through a complex collection of different software services that help them wrangle data, track financials, sell products, and manage employees, customers, supply chains, and contracts. (If you've ever had to login to Workday, you'll know what I mean).\n\nGenerative AI is a threat to these applications in two main ways. First, if employees get more efficient using AI tools, companies may not need to buy as many business software subscriptions. That would dent the growth of \"seats,\" or how many subscriptions software companies sell. Each employee has a seat, so if there's no new hiring, growth stalls.\n\nThe second threat is more existential. If AI tools and AI agents get good enough, companies could replace the software they use entirely and instead rely on new AI-powered workflows. And with AI coding tools showing big improvements lately, companies could even develop their own software, without needing to buy it from established vendors.\n\nThis is why Anthropic's recent announcements have hit the software sector so hard.\n\nAnthropic's Cowork marks a clear step beyond chatbots. Instead of simply answering questions, Cowork can plan and execute multi-step tasks on a user's computer. Users can grant it access to folders, files, and applications, allowing the AI to clean up documents, build spreadsheets and slide decks, analyze data, automate workflows, and even log into web apps to collect information.\n\nBarclays analysts described Cowork as closer to what Microsoft originally envisioned for Copilot—a true digital worker—but with far greater autonomy. Microsoft shares are down about 12% in the past week or so.\n\nCowork is designed for non-technical and semi-technical users, such as marketers, project managers, and finance professionals, who can direct it using plain English. That matters because it weakens the traditional value proposition of many SaaS tools. If an AI agent can organize files, generate reports, build dashboards, and automate routine workflows on demand, the need for a dedicated, single-purpose application starts to look less obvious.\n\nThe threat became more concrete when Anthropic followed up by launching plugins for Cowork this week. These plugins effectively turn the AI into a specialist for roles like sales, finance, legal, marketing, and customer support, connecting it directly to internal data sources and tools. Anthropic even open-sourced a starter set of plugins, signaling an ecosystem approach rather than a closed product.\n\n\"This is another front-of-mind example of an AI tool lowering the barrier to entry, gaining traction, and disrupting incumbent workflows,\" said Michelle Miller, co-head of the Enterprise Software Technology group at consulting firm AlixPartners.\n\nFor years, companies bought software because building it themselves was too slow and expensive. Generative AI is flipping that equation. Tools like Anthropic's Claude, OpenAI-powered coding assistants, and products from StackBlitz, Replit, and others allow non-engineers to create custom tools with relatively simple English language prompts.\n\nNetlify CEO Matt Biilmann has said his own employees have used AI to build internal replacements for SaaS products like survey and quoting tools. Venture capitalist Martin Casado has described building a personal CRM with AI because it was easier than learning a complex off-the-shelf product. Salesforce, the leading CRM software vendor, is down about 40% in the past year.\n\nStackblitz CEO Eric Simons said his startup has created in-house AI agents for many workflows, including business intelligence, data analysis, coding, product development, customer support, and outbound sales.\n\n\"As a result, there are many SaaS vendors we would have likely previously used that are no longer relevant,\" he told Business Insider.\n\n\"The industry is waking up to the fact that AI is becoming extremely good at creating software autonomously,\" he added. \"This brings questions around what 'moats' exist for incumbent companies that are not themselves frontier AI labs.\"\n\nThis shift is especially dangerous for mid-sized SaaS companies. According to AlixPartners, they're being squeezed between nimble AI-native startups on one side and tech giants bundling AI into existing platforms on the other. Enterprise buyers, under pressure to cut costs, are increasingly asking why they need five tools when one AI tool or agent can do some, or most, of the work.\n\nPricing adds another layer of tension. AI systems are expensive to run, making traditional per-seat pricing harder to justify. Companies like ServiceNow are experimenting with hybrid and usage-based models. CEO Bill McDermott has insisted AI isn't hurting results, but investors remain skeptical. ServiceNow shares have plunged 25% in the past month.\n\nIf Cowork represents a top-down push from a well-funded AI lab, OpenClaw, formerly called Moltbot, shows how disruption can also come from the bottom up.\n\nCreated as a personal project and released as open source, OpenClaw is a messaging-first AI assistant that works inside platforms like WhatsApp, Slack, and iMessage. Relying heavily on Anthropic's Claude models, OpenClaw remembers context, proactively nudges users, and can automate tasks using browser actions, scripts, and scheduled jobs. After a month or so of relative obscurity, it went viral in late January.\n\nWhat caught investors' attention wasn't just OpenClaw's popularity, but what it represents. Instead of logging into multiple apps, users interact with an AI agent in a chat window and let it orchestrate tasks behind the scenes. In effect, the interface becomes conversation, not software menus.\n\nBarclays analysts noted that OpenClaw's underlying \"gateway,\" which routes tasks between agents and tools, resembles the orchestration layer that many enterprise software vendors are now racing to build.\n\nThe difference is that OpenClaw is free, open source, and user-controlled — a worrying combination for software incumbents that rely on expensive licenses. It's also a potential problem because the direct user relationship is now controlled by OpenClaw, not software providers.\n\nNone of this means software is disappearing overnight. Core systems of record — databases, payroll systems, accounting ledgers — remain deeply embedded in corporate operations. But the layers around them are becoming fluid. Dashboards, workflows, reports, and even entire applications can now be generated and used on the fly by AI agents.\n\nFor SaaS companies, the message is stark. Adapt by embracing agents, flexible pricing, and AI-native design — or risk becoming the next thing AI consumes.\n\n\"AI is forcing change across software development, AI governance and data security, go-to-market operations, pricing models, valuation frameworks, and business structure,\" AlixPartners' Miller said. \"Software companies mastering these transitions will define the winners in the next era, and those unable to adapt will be sidelined as industry fundamentals are redrawn.\"\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "fullText": "A Louisville business is facing criticism after the owner told employees to \"leave religion and politics at the door” when she received a note from a customer who said he was treated disrespectfully because he was a member of law enforcement.\n\nPlease & Thank You owner Brooke Vaughn told The Courier Journal that she sent the message to her management team Feb. 3 after receiving an email from a man, who identified himself as a police officer, saying he had been treated disrespectfully. In the email, the man said he was “greeted by a rude person” and got “evil looks from all of the employees.”\n\n“REMINDER to leave your religion and politics at the door when you come to work for PLEASE & THANK YOU,” the message reads. “If you discriminate against anyone inside our shops, you are not meant to be a DAY MAKER and should consider a career elsewhere.”\n\nA screenshot of the message was posted to Reddit around 1:30 p.m. Feb. 3, with the post saying it was sent after Vaughn received an email from a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent. Vaughn said the officer who complained to her wrote that he was in uniform during his visit, but did not confirm if the man was an ICE agent.\n\nWithin hours of the message being posted to social media, Vaughn said she and other staff members started receiving several complaints, adding that she was forced to turn off the comment feature on the business' Instagram page due to ongoing arguments.\n\n“People are showing up at shops and calling our employees ‘fascists,’” she said.\n\nVaughn added that the store's media accounts have also gained followers since the message was posted, but she was unsure if they were following to support the business or to \"see [them] fail.\"\n\nThe criticism comes after two U.S. citizens, Renee Nicole Good and Alex Pretti, were fatally shot by federal agents in Minneapolis, sparking nationwide protests. Thousands of federal immigration officers were previously sent to Minnesota in December, and President Donald Trump’s border czar Tom Homan announced Feb. 4 that 700 immigration enforcement personnel would be leaving the state.\n\nMetro columnist Joe Gerth contributed.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Louisville Courier Journal: Please & Thank You owner facing backlash after memo posted online",

    "description": "\"I've personally gotten a lot more out of biographies than I ever have from particular business books,\" said Selkirk Sport co-founder Mike Barnes.",
    "fullText": "Mike and Rob Barnes started selling airsoft equipment out of their dad's basement when they were teenagers. It was part of a homeschool project and evolved into a profitable business.\n\nA few years later, they launched a pickleball equipment company at ages 19 and 22. They had no college degrees, no outside investors, and no guarantee that pickleball would ever take off.\n\n\"I remember there was a point where dad talked to us and said, 'OK, you can go to college, and you can go down that path, or you can keep doing what you're doing and just double down,'\" Rob told Business Insider. \"And we were like, let's double down, see what happens.\"\n\nMore than a decade later, that bet has paid off. Selkirk is now one of the leading pickleball equipment brands, known for its premium paddles, and the family-run company expects to generate nine-figure revenue in 2026.\n\nThe Barnes brothers say that while they skipped traditional higher education, learning has always been central to how they run their business. They've learned from other successful founders and executives by reading a lot of business books.\n\nThey shared six of their top recs.\n\nBoth brothers say they gravitate toward biographies and autobiographies because they show how decisions actually play out in the real world.\n\n\"I've personally gotten a lot more out of biographies than I ever have from particular business books,\" Rob said. \"You have people literally talking about how they made a decision and why, and then showing how it played out, good or bad.\"\n\nSome of their favorite autobiographies and memoirs include:\n\nOne business book the brothers said influenced them early on was \"The E-Myth\" by Michael E. Gerber, which dispels myths about starting a business.\n\nThey also recommend \"Barbarians at the Gate,\" which tells the story of RJR Nabisco's fall.\n\n\"It was interesting — more of a warning about how corporate governance can get out of hand,\" they said of Bryan Burrough and John Helyar's bestseller.\n\nFinally, one of Mike's favorites is \"The Outsiders: Eight Unconventional CEOs and Their Radically Rational Blueprint for Success.\"\n\nThe book profiles eight relatively unknown CEOs who delivered extraordinary results by ignoring convention.\n\n\"They weren't very big on public perception,\" Mike said. \"But they ran their companies really well in unconventional ways. And it worked.\"\n\nThe brothers are very willing to question conventional wisdom.\n\nThey don't believe there's a \"right\" or \"wrong\" way to go about business, and said they try to avoid a \"best practices\" mindset.\n\n\"In a formal education environment, you often learn there's one way of doing things — and your goal is to avoid making a mistake,\" said Mike. \"That creates a mindset where people are just trying to learn the best practice so they don't mess up. Our mindset is more like, let's look at all the different ways people have done things and decide what actually makes sense for us.\"\n\nInstead of defaulting to industry norms, they focus on \"strategic practices\" that are grounded in evidence, context, and their specific business goals.\n\n\"'Best practice' is almost a bad word in our company,\" Mike said. \"If someone says, 'Let's do this because it's the best practice,' you actually have to bring in evidence and explain why it's 'best.'\"\n\nRob added, \"No one's built a great business by doing everything exactly the same way everyone else does. Be willing to be counterintuitive and challenge the status quo.\"",

    "fullText": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Google’s latest quarterly report provided further evidence that its internet empire is withstanding an artificial intelligence shakeup that’s turning into another potential boon for the company.\n\nThe numbers released Wednesday marked Google's third consecutive quarter of digital ad growth of more than 10% from the previous year, while also posting more than 30% sales growth in its division that powers data centers for AI services.\n\nWhat drove Google's strong Q4 financial performance?\n\nWhat impact did the antitrust ruling have?\n\nHow is Google competing against AI startups?\n\nHow much is Alphabet investing in AI infrastructure?\n\nThose increases during the October-December period propelled Google’s corporate parent Alphabet Inc. well past the earnings forecasts of stock market analysts.\n\nAlphabet’s fourth-quarter profit rose 30% from the prior year to $34.5 billion, or $2.82 per share, while revenue climbed 18% to $113.8 billion.\n\nThe collective momentum of Google’s main business in search and advertising and the still-nascent AI field indicates a company born during the late 1990s internet boom is becoming even stronger during another technology phenomenon nearly 30 years later.\n\n“Search saw more usage than ever before, with AI continuing to drive an expansionary moment,\" Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said.\n\nGoogle’s successful evolution has helped drive up Alphabet’s stock price nearly 60% in the past five months, giving it a $4 trillion market value. Even so, some investors are still skeptical whether Google will be able to sustain enough growth to justify the more than $300 billion that Alphabet will have spent from 2024 through the end of this year on expanding the computing capacity needed for AI features. Those worries caused Alphabet's shares to see-saw between slight gains and declines during extended trading after Wednesday's report came out.\n\nApple, also currently worth $4 trillion, thinks so highly of Google’s AI that the iPhone maker recently struck a deal to use Google’s Gemini technology in a long-delayed upgrade to its virtual assistant, Siri.\n\nGoogle is also embedding more of its Gemini AI into its long-dominant search engine, Gmail and Chrome browser as it tries to avoid complacency and being outmaneuvered by up-and-coming companies such as OpenAI, Anthropic and Perplexity.\n\nTo meet the challenge, Alphabet has been on a spending spree to expand its AI capacity. After pouring $91 billion into capital expenditures devoted mostly to AI, the Mountain View, California, company disclosed Wednesday that it expects to double down by spending another $175 billion to $185 billion this year. Its capital expenditure budget has ballooned from about $30 billion annually since 2022 when OpenAI released its ChatGPT chatbot to much acclaim, prompting Google to pull out all the stops to catch up.",
