    "description": "After 14 years in the Air Force and National Guard, Andrew Miller landed a corporate role at Amazon — but with 6 kids, it didn't leave him enough time to be a dad.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Andrew Miller, 50, in Mount Vernon, Washington, the owner of Tulip Valley Farms. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI remember the moment I looked around my office and saw only performative culture staring back at me.\n\nBetween 70-hour workweeks that started at 4 a.m. and growing disagreements with how the company was being run, I knew something had to give.\n\nIt wasn't hard work that scared me. Before corporate life, I spent 14 years in the Air Force and National Guard.\n\nBut as my family grew, I started questioning the path I was on. I'd never been deployed, but I knew it was likely. With two autistic children at home, my family needed me present. After leaving the military, I landed a corporate role at Amazon.\n\nIt went well for a while, but I was rarely seeing my family, and it wasn't the life I'd envisioned. I realized that while some people live for their role, my most important job was being a dad — I have six kids.\n\nSo, in 2015, I quit my job at Amazon. My wife, Holly, supported my decision, knowing that I was completely drained and losing my sense of purpose.\n\nWe also decided it was time to move back to Washington, where we both grew up.\n\nSkagit County is a place where your kids can run down the trail to a relative's house if they don't like what you're serving for dinner.\n\nIt's also home to an annual tulip festival that's been held for over 40 years.\n\nI took a strategy role with the county's economic development team, working on growth and equity.\n\nSkagit sits at the intersection of outdoor recreation, tourism, and agriculture — yet while the county once had about 4,000 acres of tulips, that number had dropped to roughly 500. I knew we needed a new model, or this county wouldn't be the home of tulips anymore.\n\nI came up with an idea and went for it. I decided to buy a tulip farm and reimagine what it could be — not just a working farm, but a place people wanted to hang out.\n\nIn 2018, I bought my first farm. In the months leading up to the purchase, I quickly learned that many agricultural problems are really business problems.\n\nThe questions weren't just about growing tulips; they were about the experience: How many tulips could we grow? What kind of customer experience could we create? And how should we design the layout of the fields for tourists?\n\nTo prepare, I raised capital with friends and spent six weeks shadowing an 85-year-old Dutch farmer who had been growing tulips since 1984. He and his wife told me they had turned down 16 other buyers before choosing me. He died shortly afterward, and after his death, I moved forward with taking over the farm.\n\nMy former business partner and I bought the 30-acre property for $1.6 million, including both the land and the business.\n\nIn those first months of farm life, my approach was pure curiosity.\n\nThen the pandemic hit, just 10 days before opening.\n\nWe pivoted to flower shipping, and eventually added you-pick experiences once restrictions eased. From what I could see, no one in Skagit County was doing that.\n\nI've learned that I tend to learn things the hard way. My daughter even bought me a pen that reads: \"Maybe I like doing it the hard way.\"\n\nThe fresh approach worked, but my business partnership didn't. After differences in vision, we split, and I went on to buy a second farm: Tulip Valley Farm, which I still run today. I bought it from a 70-year-old potato farmer with hazelnut trees.\n\nToday, my 23-year-old son can operate a forklift, which he learned when he was 15. My sister runs business management and communications.\n\nI still work from 5 a.m. until bedtime, but now I'm home. I'm serving my community.\n\nI'll walk into Costco, and my kids will scatter when someone recognizes me from the farm. My family is happy to know we can take three weeks off in the summer because of how hard we work the rest of the year.\n\nThey've seen the strain, the kitchen-table meetings, the risk of starting from scratch. I want them to see that.\n\nHealing in the soil — for us, and for guests\n\nToday, the farm is flourishing. Visitor numbers have doubled year over year for the past three years. We design the fields not just for farming, but for connection — proposals, photos, moments people want to share.\n\nIn a world where we are gagging for meaningful in-person experiences, people are drawn to farms. I get it. As someone with PTSD from my former career, I can also affirm that dirt therapy is the best therapy.\n\nBeing able to shape your own environment and build your own future is essential.",

    "fullText": "Citadel CEO Ken Griffin said that CEOs are scared of talking about politics — and sick of yo-yoing between politicians to stay successful.\n\nGriffin said that the US government's new style of direct engagement with corporate America is causing some business leaders to question whether their fortunes will change from one administration to the next, depending on their level of public support.\n\n\"When the US government starts to engage in corporate America in a way that tastes of favoritism, I know for most CEOs that I'm friends with, they find it incredibly distasteful,\" Griffin said at the Wall Street Journal's Invest Live event on Tuesday.\n\nLeaders, he said, would rather focus on creating value for customers and shareholders than catering to an administration.\n\n\"Most CEOs just don't want to find themselves in the business of having to, in some sense, suck up to one administration after another to succeed in running their business,\" he said.\n\nGriffin criticized current and past administrations for their involvement in corporate America, citing green energy investments under Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden.\n\n\"We don't need the US government to pretend to be venture capitalists,\" he said.\n\nIn August, the Trump administration took a nearly 10% stake in Intel, a few weeks after the president had called on Intel's CEO to resign, but changed his tune after a White House meeting.\n\nWhen asked why fewer CEOs are speaking out about hot-button political issues, Griffin said they're still reeling from prior years, when companies that involved themselves in what he called the \"woke movement\" were either \"embraced or ostracized\" as a result.\n\n\"That's created a level of fear and apprehension among the corporate CEO class to insert themselves in any publicly facing issues these days,\" Griffin said.\n\nSocial media has, he added, taken apprehension to a fever pitch, since sentiment about a company or its product can catch like wildfire.\n\n\"The power of social media to persuade millions or tens of millions of consumers to make a product choice is really terrifying to corporate executives,\" Griffin said. Recent deadly shootings by ICE and Border Patrol agents in Minnesota have pushed some CEOs, from big names in tech to small business owners, to comment publicly on politics again.\n\nGriffin, one of the GOP's biggest donors, was also asked about whether he has plans to run for public office, Griffin said that he hasn't ruled it out. \n\n\"I'd like to believe at a future point in my life I will be involved in public service,\" adding that it was unlikely in the next few years.\n\nIn terms of others' public service, Griffin praised Trump's pick for Fed chair, Kevin Warsh, calling the nomination a \"powerful assertion that the Fed will maintain needed independence in policy decision-making.\"",

    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — The Small Business Administration said in a policy note that green card holders won't be allowed to apply for SBA loans, effective March 1.\n\nThe move is the latest by the SBA as it works to tighten loan restrictions and restructure the agency.\n\nLast year, it tightened a requirement that businesses applying for loans must be 100% owned by U.S. citizens, U.S. nationals, or lawful permanent residents, up from a 51% standard.\n\nIn December, it issued a policy note that said up to 5% of a business could be non-citizen owned. But the current policy rescinds that, as well as making lawful permanent residents ineligible, too.\n\n“The Trump SBA is committed to driving economic growth and job creation for American citizens – which is why, effective March 1, the agency will no longer guarantee loans for small businesses owned by foreign nationals,\" said SBA spokesperson Maggie Clemmons in an emailed statement. “Across every program, the SBA is ensuring that every taxpayer dollar entrusted to this agency goes to support U.S. job creators and innovators.”\n\nThe SBA doesn’t give out direct loans, except when they’re related to disasters, but it works with lenders to distribute loans to small businesses. The loans typically have better rates than traditional loans.\n\nSmall business advocacy group the Small Business Majority said the move is “a decision that will limit the growth of small businesses and jobs throughout the United States.”\n\n“The latest decision by SBA fails to recognize that immigrants are twice as likely to start a business as native-born U.S. citizens,” said Small Business Majority CEO John Arensmeyer. “Given that reality, SBA’s severe restrictions will have a negative impact on small business creation throughout this country for years to come.”",

    "description": "Finnish military personnel told Business Insider that temperature variation is a huge threat to their weapons in the Arctic.",
    "fullText": "Frozen weapons are among the many challenges NATO soldiers would face in an Arctic conflict.\n\nSoldiers have to be careful not to let the harsh elements cause their guns to malfunction.\n\nBut they also can't let the guns get too warm, as that creates new problems.\n\nSODANKYLÄ, Finland — Among the many challenges NATO soldiers face in the harsh Arctic environment, the possibility of frozen weapons is one that risks leaving them most vulnerable.\n\nIt's anything but easy to keep guns, drones, and other equipment in the right conditions far above the Arctic Circle, where temperatures routinely drop below 0 degrees Fahrenheit, and the heavy snow brings unwanted moisture that can cause jamming and other problems.\n\nNATO military personnel training in northern Finland told Business Insider during a visit to the region in late January that they can't afford to let their guns get too warm if they want them to work in this climate.\n\nThe biggest problem with weapons in these conditions is temperature variation, said Maj. Mikael Aikio, the Arctic section leader of the Finnish Army's Jaeger Brigade, which is leading a winter warfare training and cold-weather survival course for roughly 20 NATO soldiers.\n\nThe monthlong course, hosted in Finland's northern Lapland region, teaches NATO soldiers how to live, move, and fight in the harsh Arctic environment.\n\nThis type of training has become a growing priority for NATO as officials call for greater Arctic defense amid increasing Russian and Chinese activity in the High North. Western forces could find themselves fighting on frozen battlefields as the alliance and its adversaries compete for influence in this strategic region.\n\nLapland, like other northern regions in NATO's seven Arctic states, is a tough place to operate in winter. The biting cold, limited sunlight, and deep snowfall force troops to move slowly and with caution. And limited support infrastructure makes sustainment even more difficult up north.\n\nIn the Arctic, survival is only the first challenge. Troops must also keep their weapons functioning; even minor equipment failures can hand the enemy an edge.\n\nCanadian Cpt. Vincent Lemelin, one of the participants in the Arctic warfare training course, said all technology struggles in this part of the world, especially anything that requires charging, such as drones.\n\nAnything that gets covered in snow eventually becomes damp or wet, Lemelin said, so soldiers try to keep their guns cold at all times to avoid having ice or snow melt and introduce any moisture that might freeze and prevent it from working properly.\n\nFinnish Lt. Laura Lähdekorpi, another course participant, said she carries a brush with her at all times to clear snow from her gun, especially from sensitive areas like the optics, which are more vulnerable to buildup. Soldiers are trained to ensure their weapons are dry to prevent anything from freezing up.\n\nLähdekorpi said firing a cold gun is a challenge. Her outer gloves are too bulky, so she strips them off and uses a thin liner to pull the trigger, but that leaves her hands exposed to the weapon's metal frame, which holds the cold.\n\n\"I think my hands are the worst enemy for me,\" she said. \"I have to keep them warm.\"\n\nProper weapon care doesn't end when training stops. Soldiers are taught to keep their guns at a steady ambient temperature. Bringing them into a warm tent, for instance, can cause condensation that later refreezes.\n\nSoldiers can't leave the guns outside their tents, as they might be stolen in real-world conditions. Instead, they bring them inside but place the weapons on the ground or in a space that is almost as cold as it is outside.\n\nProper firearm temperature management is not the only equipment struggle in the harsh Arctic. Drones are also relatively limited in their capabilities, especially in extreme cold, when temperatures drop below -14 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nDuring a combat exercise in the middle of the Arctic warfare course, soldiers practiced using drones to collect targeting data and call in artillery strikes against a simulated enemy force made up of Finnish conscripts.\n\nUsing small drones for reconnaissance, targeting, and fire support missions is standard practice in the Russian war against Ukraine, and they are expected to continue to be a key part of the kill chain in future conflicts, despite their limitations.\n\nAikio, a Jaeger Brigade major, said drones need special handling in Arctic conditions. Leaving them exposed on snowmobiles before launch risks damage from the elements, and once airborne, icing on small propellers and limited visibility can quickly degrade performance.\n\nLearning to keep weapons and other gear operational in this environment is one of many skills NATO soldiers are being taught to master in Finland, roughly a third of which lies above the Arctic Circle. The country also knows cold-weather combat, making it well-suited to teach the rest of the alliance winter warfare.\n\nLemelin, the Canadian captain, described the course as a \"humbling experience;\" it's critical exposure for the NATO alliance as Western militaries grapple with a rapidly changing Arctic environment and an expanding adversarial footprint.",

    "fullText": "Aerospace business and artificial intelligence firm to unite for IPO as world’s most valuable private company\n\nElon Musk’s aerospace company SpaceX has acquired his artificial intelligence business xAI, in a $1.25tn (£910bn) merger that consolidates part of Musk’s empire as SpaceX prepares to go public later this year.\n\nThe two companies announced the deal on Monday in a statement on SpaceX’s website, saying the merger would form “the most ambitious, vertically-integrated innovation engine on (and off) Earth, with AI, rockets, space-based internet, direct-to-mobile device communications and the world’s foremost real-time information and free speech platform”.\n\nSpaceX, one of the world’s most valuable private companies, will gain xAI properties such as its Grok chatbot and the social media platform X. The acquisition comes as Musk has pursued plans to put datacenters and solar-powered satellites in space as a means of powering artificial intelligence, an immense and exorbitantly expensive undertaking.\n\nThe deal reportedly valued SpaceX at $1tn and xAI at $250bn, putting the combined business on course for a stock market float valuing it well in excess of $1tn. The float is expected to be timed for early summer to coincide with a planetary alignment and Musk’s birthday.\n\nMusk turns 55 on 28 June, around the same time as Jupiter and Venus appear in close proximity to each other.\n\nThe announcement of the deal specifically cited Musk’s plans for space-based datacenters as a rationale for the deal.\n\n“Current advances in AI are dependent on large terrestrial datacenters, which require immense amounts of power and cooling. Global electricity demand for AI simply cannot be met with terrestrial solutions, even in the near term, without imposing hardship on communities and the environment,” the announcement said.\n\n“In the long term, space-based AI is obviously the only way to scale.”\n\nMusk has been increasingly intertwining parts of his businesses in recent months through deals and acquisitions. xAI acquired the platform X in an all-stock transaction in early 2025, and last month Tesla revealed that it planned to invest $2bn in xAI.\n\nBoth SpaceX and xAI have received staggering valuations in the past year. As SpaceX continues to dominate satellite launches and secure extensive contracts with the US federal government, it sent a letter to investors in December that revealed an expected value of $800bn for the company.\n\nDespite widespread backlash to xAI’s Grok AI tool over its promotion of racist ideology and spread of nonconsensual sexualized deepfake images of women and children, the artificial intelligence company has also grown its valuation amid the AI boom. It announced a $20bn Series E fundraise last month from major investors, which valued the company at $230bn.\n\nSpeculation and leaks about the deal, first reported by Reuters, have proliferated in recent days. Musk appeared to give vague confirmation of the acquisition earlier on Monday, writing simply “yes” in reply to a post on X that referenced reports of the merger.\n\nThe news is a positive diversion for Musk after Tesla released an earnings report last week that showed declining revenues and a struggling car business. A few days later, a Department of Justice release of 3m files related to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein showed Musk exchanging numerous friendly emails with the disgraced financier and making plans to visit his private island. Musk has not responded to Guardian inquiries about the latest Epstein emails.\n\nHe called the release of the emails a “distraction” on X and claimed that he was “well aware that some email correspondence with him could be misinterpreted and used by detractors to smear my name”.",

    "description": "A couple in Vancouver transitioned from corporate careers in fashion and tech to cofound No Reception Club and create travel products for parents.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Gemma Ng, 39, and Daniel Ng, 38, the husband-and-wife cofounders of No Reception Club, who are based in Vancouver. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nGemma: We've been together since we were 19, when we were both studying international business at different universities. We met during an internship program.\n\nI spent a decade in fashion at companies like Ralph Lauren, Theory, and Banana Republic, working as a merchant and a buyer.\n\nDaniel started in finance as an investment banker and private equity investor, then pivoted into tech after his MBA. He worked at Yelp, One Kings Lane, and Cherish.\n\nNow, we run a company together called No Reception Club.\n\nGemma: We felt challenged, and we were working in industries we admired. I once thought it'd be so cool to be VP of merchandising at a retailer I love. Daniel had ambitions in tech leadership.\n\nWe weren't miserable, but 10 years in, we started asking: Where is this path going? What does it look like in another five or 10 years?\n\nThe reality is, the higher you go in corporate America, the less you do of the thing that drew you there. We both loved building products — mine were physical, his were digital.\n\nWhen you look up the ladder, success looks more like managing 40 or 50 people, sitting in meetings all day, navigating politics, and less about creating. That didn't appeal to us.\n\nDaniel: Over the years, we'd tinker with side hustle ideas, but nothing ever stuck.\n\nThat changed after our son was born in 2019. When he was seven months old, we took a five-hour flight from San Francisco to Hawaii, and it was a disaster. Everything that could go wrong did. We were miserable, and honestly, angry at each other.\n\nSitting on that plane, we thought, Why isn't anyone making this easier? There are travel brands and parenting brands, but there was nothing at the intersection.\n\nGemma: On that same trip in Hawaii, we had a long dinner conversation and decided we were going to give it a go. Practically, that meant I'd quit first. My background in creating physical products was more directly relevant in the early days, and we wanted to be product-first.\n\nI gave notice at my job a month later and started working on our business full time in March 2020. Daniel stayed at Yelp, working nights and weekends on our business. We were both earning six-figure salaries in our last corporate roles.\n\nDaniel: For two years, we balanced it that way. Gemma led product development while I kept my day job.\n\nDaniel: The campaign ran for 33 days over July and August of 2021. We reached our initial funding target of $30,000 in less than three days, and the campaign went on to raise nearly $67,000.\n\nWe did it by posting extensively in family travel Facebook groups about our products to get feedback and share about the campaign. We also reached out cold to publications and influencers who might be interested in our products.\n\nDaniel: In 2021, we launched our first product, the Getaway Bag, the first travel-specific diaper bag.\n\nI still remember the thrill of sitting there with our kid when we went live, and wondering, Is anyone going to show up? Or will this be like Halloween, with the lights on and nobody knocking?\n\nThen we got our first sale, then 10, then 100. It was exhilarating.\n\nIt was also exhausting. Our first inventory shipment arrived while Gemma was nine months pregnant with our second child.\n\nWith COVID-19 supply chain delays, the timing couldn't have been worse. We were working nonstop, packing orders ourselves, running to the post office, and barely sleeping.\n\nI hit a breaking point. I went for a run to clear my head and came back knowing I needed to quit Yelp. It wasn't because our startup income had replaced my salary — it hadn't.\n\nDaniel: I didn't want to regret not betting on us. I told myself I'd give it a year. If it didn't work, I could always go back to tech. That leap of faith paid off. The business now fully supports our family.\n\nBuilding a company together while raising kids brings its own challenges. At first, we thought the secret would be clear boundaries: Gemma owns physical, I own digital. In practice, we're in each other's worlds constantly.\n\nWe consult on everything, which actually comes from a place of trust and respect. There's always a clear owner who takes it to the finish line, but we value each other's perspectives. It's not unusual to see both of us in the same meeting, rolling our chairs over to join.\n\nGemma: It's very easy for every moment to become a work moment. Early on, Daniel had a habit of asking me business questions right before bed, which kept me from sleeping because my brain was spinning.\n\nWe've learned to be intentional. We carve out at least an hour at night for no work — just watching a show or reading.\n\nGemma: We give each other veto power to say, \"not now,\" and we've gotten better at reading the moment.\n\nHaving an office in our home has also helped. For a long time, our desks were in the dining room, the living room, and even the bedroom. Now at least we can shut the door, even if our kids still press their faces against the glass.\n\nThe home office is the only office our business uses, and we're the only full-time employees. We have contracted part-time support for customer service.\n\nDaniel: In a corporate setting, your coworkers only know your office self. As partners, we know everything that's going on — it's the first week of school, a parent is sick, the kids are extra needy. We can adjust priorities with a full understanding of the bigger picture.\n\nGemma: Working with your spouse can be complicated, but for us, the benefits outweigh the challenges. There's no one I'd rather be building this with.",

    "title": "NATO soldiers say they can't let their guns get too warm if they want them to work on frozen battlefields",
    "description": "Finnish military personnel told Business Insider that temperature variation is a huge threat to their weapons in the Arctic.",
    "fullText": "SODANKYLÄ, Finland — Among the many challenges NATO soldiers face in the harsh Arctic environment, the possibility of frozen weapons is one that risks leaving them most vulnerable.\n\nIt's anything but easy to keep guns, drones, and other equipment in the right conditions far above the Arctic Circle, where temperatures routinely drop below 0 degrees Fahrenheit, and the heavy snow brings unwanted moisture that can cause jamming and other problems.\n\nNATO military personnel training in northern Finland told Business Insider during a visit to the region in late January that they can't afford to let their guns get too warm if they want them to work in this climate.\n\nThe biggest problem with weapons in these conditions is temperature variation, said Maj. Mikael Aikio, the Arctic section leader of the Finnish Army's Jaeger Brigade, which is leading a winter warfare training and cold-weather survival course for roughly 20 NATO soldiers.\n\nThe monthlong course, hosted in Finland's northern Lapland region, teaches NATO soldiers how to live, move, and fight in the harsh Arctic environment.\n\nThis type of training has become a growing priority for NATO as officials call for greater Arctic defense amid increasing Russian and Chinese activity in the High North. Western forces could find themselves fighting on frozen battlefields as the alliance and its adversaries compete for influence in this strategic region.\n\nLapland, like other northern regions in NATO's seven Arctic states, is a tough place to operate in winter. The biting cold, limited sunlight, and deep snowfall force troops to move slowly and with caution. And limited support infrastructure makes sustainment even more difficult up north.\n\nIn the Arctic, survival is only the first challenge. Troops must also keep their weapons functioning; even minor equipment failures can hand the enemy an edge.\n\nCanadian Cpt. Vincent Lemelin, one of the participants in the Arctic warfare training course, said all technology struggles in this part of the world, especially anything that requires charging, such as drones.\n\nAnything that gets covered in snow eventually becomes damp or wet, Lemelin said, so soldiers try to keep their guns cold at all times to avoid having ice or snow melt and introduce any moisture that might freeze and prevent it from working properly.\n\nFinnish Lt. Laura Lähdekorpi, another course participant, said she carries a brush with her at all times to clear snow from her gun, especially from sensitive areas like the optics, which are more vulnerable to buildup. Soldiers are trained to ensure their weapons are dry to prevent anything from freezing up.\n\nLähdekorpi said firing a cold gun is a challenge. Her outer gloves are too bulky, so she strips them off and uses a thin liner to pull the trigger, but that leaves her hands exposed to the weapon's metal frame, which holds the cold.\n\n\"I think my hands are the worst enemy for me,\" she said. \"I have to keep them warm.\"\n\nProper weapon care doesn't end when training stops. Soldiers are taught to keep their guns at a steady ambient temperature. Bringing them into a warm tent, for instance, can cause condensation that later refreezes.\n\nSoldiers can't leave the guns outside their tents, as they might be stolen in real-world conditions. Instead, they bring them inside but place the weapons on the ground or in a space that is almost as cold as it is outside.\n\nProper firearm temperature management is not the only equipment struggle in the harsh Arctic. Drones are also relatively limited in their capabilities, especially in extreme cold, when temperatures drop below -14 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nDuring a combat exercise in the middle of the Arctic warfare course, soldiers practiced using drones to collect targeting data and call in artillery strikes against a simulated enemy force made up of Finnish conscripts.\n\nUsing small drones for reconnaissance, targeting, and fire support missions is standard practice in the Russian war against Ukraine, and they are expected to continue to be a key part of the kill chain in future conflicts, despite their limitations.\n\nAikio, a Jaeger Brigade major, said drones need special handling in Arctic conditions. Leaving them exposed on snowmobiles before launch risks damage from the elements, and once airborne, icing on small propellers and limited visibility can quickly degrade performance.\n\nLearning to keep weapons and other gear operational in this environment is one of many skills NATO soldiers are being taught to master in Finland, roughly a third of which lies above the Arctic Circle. The country also knows cold-weather combat, making it well-suited to teach the rest of the alliance winter warfare.\n\nLemelin, the Canadian captain, described the course as a \"humbling experience;\" it's critical exposure for the NATO alliance as Western militaries grapple with a rapidly changing Arctic environment and an expanding adversarial footprint.",

    "description": "A Business for Good-Harris poll found that 75% of Americans agree \"hands-on skills and practice experience\" matter more than formal degrees.",
    "fullText": "Americans think the future of work is in their hands.\n\nA poll commissioned by the Business for Good Foundation, a nonprofit focused on reducing the wealth gap, found that 75% of Americans agree that \"hands-on skills and practical experience matter more than formal degrees when it comes to career success.\"\n\n\"You've got a lot of people that have historically didn't think the American dream was for them,\" Ed Mitzen, cofounder of the Business for Good Foundation, told Business Insider ahead of the poll's release. \"I would argue that it isn't broken, it's just moved, and it's moved to places we stop looking.\"\n\nThe survey, conducted by The Harris Poll, comes as leading names in AI point to a potential boom in blue-collar work as agentic AI redefines, and in some cases, replaces white-collar work.\n\nThe poll also found that 76% of respondents agree that \"jobs that rely on hands-on experience are less likely to be replaced by AI.\"\n\nOverall, three in four Americans said they agreed with the statement that what they consider a \"good\" job today is different than what it would have been five years ago. And 78% agreed with the statement \"the stigma around trade or blue-collar work is declining\" as society puts a greater emphasis on hands-on skills.\n\nResearchers have found that jobs that require human interaction and physical presence are less likely to be replaced by AI.\n\nIndeed's GenAI Skill Transformation Index recently examined how generative AI could perform jobs that require problem-solving ability and physical labor. Their findings were that nursing, childcare, and construction were the least likely to be affected by AI.\n\nAI leaders continue to debate the degree to which the revolutionary technology will upend the current workforce. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has stood by his prediction that AI could eliminate roughly half of all entry-level white-collar jobs over the next 1 to 5 years. Others, including OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, have questioned the extent of Amodei's dour prediction.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently said at the World Economic Forum that now is the perfect time to go into the trades. In part because the AI industry itself will need an influx of workers to help build the massive data centers it wants to build.\n\n\"So we're talking about six-figure salaries for people who are building chip factories or computer factories or AI factories, and we have a great shortage in that,\" Huang said in a conversation with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink.\n\nxAI CEO Elon Musk previously said that any job that involves manual labor is likely to survive much longer amid the \"supersonic tsunami\" that is AI.\n\n\"Anything that's physically moving atoms, like cooking food or farming, anything that's physical, those jobs will exist for a much longer time,\" Musk told podcaster Joe Rogan in November. \"But anything that is digital, which is just someone at a computer doing something, AI is going to take over those jobs like lightning.\"\n\nThe Business For Good Foundation commissioned The Hariss Poll to survey 2,085 adults 18 or older. Harris Poll conducted the survey online in the US from January 13th through January 15th. The overall margin or error is ±2.5 percentage points.",

Will they make a surprise move on deadline day?\n\nChelsea have had a bid for Nigeria midfielder Jennifer Echegini turned down by Paris St-Germain but might make another attempt.

The Blues are yet to make any signings in this window and manager Sonia Bompastor has hinted at frustration over a lack of squad depth.\n\nElsewhere, Manchester City defender Codie Thomas, 19, has a loan deal in principle agreed with Glasgow City.\n\nLondon City Lionesses are hoping to add one more before the deadline but still have work to do, while Aston Villa have looked at attacking options all winter.\n\nEverton might still do some business, with Roma midfielder Zara Kramzar on the verge of joining on loan with an obligation-to-buy clause.

    "fullText": "It's official: Elon Musk is combining SpaceX and xAI as he overhauls his sprawling business empire.\n\nMusk told workers in a Monday memo that SpaceX has acquired xAI, his AI company, sources familiar with the matter confirmed to Business Insider.\n\nThe CEO wrote that the deal would create \"the most ambitious, vertically-integrated innovation engine on (and off) Earth, with AI, rockets, space-based internet, direct-to-mobile device communications and the world's foremost real-time information and free speech platform.\"\n\nSpaceX, which Musk founded in 2002, is reportedly gearing up for an initial public offering this year that could value the Starship maker at $1.5 trillion.\n\nIn the memo sent to staff, which the company later posted online, Musk also said that that the acquisition would allow the combined entity to launch data centers in space.\n\n\"This marks not just the next chapter, but the next book in SpaceX and xAI's mission: scaling to make a sentient sun to understand the Universe and extend the light of consciousness to the stars!\" Musk wrote.\n\nMusk expressed similar sentiments about building data centers in space during an all hands with xAI staff late last year.\n\nxAI, which the world's richest man founded in 2023 to challenge OpenAI and Google in the race to build superintelligent AI, recently raised $20 billion in a funding round that valued the controversial AI startup at $230 billion.\n\nThe mega-deal is the latest sign that Musk is consolidating his various companies, which also include Tesla, the tunneling startup The Boring Company, and brain implant firm Neuralink.\n\nIn March 2025, Musk announced that xAI had acquired X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter he bought in 2022. Meanwhile, SpaceX and Tesla have each invested $2 billion in xAI in recent months.\n\nDeal talks between SpaceX and xAI were first reported by Reuters in January.\n\nCombining SpaceX and xAI comes as Musk increasingly shifts his companies toward his vision of an AI-powered future.\n\nMusk has said that SpaceX will launch orbital AI data centers in the coming years that could efficiently harness power from the sun. Last Friday, SpaceX filed a request with the FCC to launch as many as one million satellites to serve as orbital data centers.\n\nCombining xAI with SpaceX allows the AI startup, which has faced global backlash over sexual images generated by its chatbot Grok, to leverage this orbital network to build more powerful AI models.\n\nIt also gives xAI access to significant capital. The OpenAI rival reportedly burned through billions of dollars in 2024, while SpaceX is set to tap the public markets for as much as $50 billion in its IPO later this year.\n\nDo you work for xAI or have a tip?

    "title": "Disney's latest earnings show why Josh D'Amaro is widely viewed as the CEO frontrunner",
    "description": "Under Josh D'Amaro, Disney's experiences business has carried the company's profits. It shows why he's considered a top CEO contender.",
    "fullText": "Josh D'Amaro appears to be the frontrunner in the race to be Disney's next CEO, and the Mouse House's latest quarterly earnings showed why.\n\nDisney's experiences business, which D'Amaro oversees, is the backbone of a company that's being weighed down by the struggling pay-TV business and isn't yet lifted up by its streaming profits. And when that part of the business sneezes, the stock catches a cold.\n\nAlthough the unit generated record profits, and Disney overall slightly beat Wall Street estimates on both revenue and earnings, the stock fell about 5% in early trading.\n\nInvestors seemed worried about Disney's reference to \"international visitation headwinds\" at its US parks. Other possible factors driving down the stock were Disney's year-over-year decline in earnings per share and its lukewarm second-quarter guidance.\n\nBoth the record experiences profits and the investor concerns underscore just how important D'Amaro and his fiefdom are to the company.\n\nBloomberg reported on Monday that Disney's board of directors \"is aligning on promoting\" D'Amaro to replace longtime CEO Bob Iger, who's planning to retire later this year. Business Insider could not independently confirm the reporting. Disney didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nUsers on the prediction market Kalshi assigned Josh D'Amaro a 92% chance of becoming the next CEO as of Monday morning.\n\nDana Walden, who runs Disney's entertainment and TV businesses, is widely seen to be the other top contender for the coveted CEO job. Walden has grown the streaming unit, which also turned in record profits in the last quarter. It's crucial to Disney's future, since traditional TV networks are losing their value due to continued cord-cutting.\n\nStill, D'Amaro's division is the profit-generating machine. Disney's parks, cruises, and products accounted for more than 70% of its operating income, despite making up a relatively small slice of its revenue at under 39%. Jason Bazinet, a media analyst at Citi, said Monday on CNBC that almost all of Disney's earnings underperformance last quarter came from the entertainment segment.\n\nBazinet added that \"virtually everyone\" on the buy side that he's spoken to \"would prefer that Mr. D'Amaro is named the new CEO.\"\n\n\"Nothing against Ms. Walden, but people just like Mr. D'Amaro a bit more,\" he said.\n\nD'Amaro's experiences segment has pulled off an impressive feat: consistently reeling in record revenue and hefty profits by making more money from each visitor, without alienating its biggest fans. The Mouse House has raised ticket prices for its US parks in each of the past four years.\n\nDisney said per-person spending at its US parks rose 4% last quarter, though attendance only increased by 1%, due in part to a dip in visits from international guests. That means the company is making more per customer, in part by upselling through Lightning Lane fast passes. While Disney could risk losing lower-income or middle-class visitors if it keeps hiking prices, its results suggest that's not an issue yet.\n\nOn Disney's earnings call, one analyst remarked on how the parks business had gone from the worst part of the company's portfolio to its profit engine.\n\nIger responded that he's \"very, very bullish\" on the parks business, which has \"never been more broad or more diverse.\"\n\n\"We have a healthy competition now at our company, in terms of which of those two businesses is going to essentially prevail as the No. 1 driver of profitability for the company,\" Iger said, in reference to the experiences and entertainment businesses — though he could also have been slyly nodding at the race between Walden and D'Amaro.",

    "description": "While many companies try to foster an “ownership culture” to boost engagement and performance, true success comes when employees are given actual equity stakes. However, financial ownership alone is insufficient; the most effective organizations combine broad-based equity with three key management practices: financial transparency, empathetic leadership, and rigorous measurement and management of culture. These practices—clear communication about how individual actions impact business outcomes, leaders who listen and build trust, and data-driven approaches to people and culture—drive higher engagement, retention, and operational improvements. Importantly, even companies without equity programs can replicate these results by applying the same principles to bonuses, profit sharing, or career development, making ownership behaviors accessible and impactful for all.",

WeissFebruary 2, 2026PostPostShareSavePrintSummary.   Leer en españolLer em portuguêsPostPostShareSavePrintU.S. worker engagement has stagnated for decades, with more than two-thirds of workers feeling detached or disengaged from work. To reverse the trend, many executives have strived to build an “ownership culture,” hoping personal responsibility will drive productivity. Yet most omit the most vital ingredient, actual ownership. We spent the past four years studying companies that committed to this missing piece, extending equity to all employees. While broad-based ownership isn’t new, a recent surge led by private equity has made it a potent economic force. Since 2022, more than $1.3 billion has been distributed to 41,000 non-executive employees, with projections exceeding $20 billion in the coming decade.",

    "fullText": "Bitcoin miners globally are facing increasing challenges to stay afloat in their business.\n\nThe whole Bitcoin-halving gambit and the volatility of crypto as a whole, thanks to geopolitical tensions, are making many miners move away from the business to something more sustainable, like artificial intelligence.\n\nThey have the machines, they have the power, so why not pivot?\n\nOne Bitcoin miner is facing an even bigger trouble, like a double-edged sword: bankruptcy and leadership turmoil.\n\nA Russian court has placed the parent company of BitRiver, the country’s largest Bitcoin mining firm, under official bankruptcy supervision.\n\nBitRiver was once a symbol of Russia’s industrial-scale crypto ambitions. At one point, it oversaw 15 data centers with a combined capacity of 533 megawatts and controlled over 50% of the domestic Bitcoin mining market, according to HSE Center for Electric Power Research. The company reported more than 10 billion rubles ($131.6 million) in revenue in 2024, before its power lines began to dim.\n\nOn Jan. 27, the Sverdlovsk Regional Arbitration Court initiated monitoring procedures for Fox Group of Companies LLC, which owns 98% of BitRiver Management Company, according to a report by Kommersant.\n\nInfrastructure of Siberia, part of energy conglomerate En+ Group, filed the bankruptcy petition over a canceled equipment supply deal. The firm paid more than 700 million rubles (approx. $9.1 million) in advance for mining hardware that never arrived.\n\nAfter the contract was terminated, courts sided with En+ in April 2025, but enforcement efforts found no recoverable assets, prompting the bankruptcy filing. BitRiver’s accounts were later frozen, a move legal experts warned could “paralyze operations,” Kommersant reported.\n\nLeading miner walks away from Bitcoin\n\nNasdaq sends delisting threat to another crypto firm\n\nAbundant Mines CEO says post-halving Bitcoin mining will look different\n\nThe En+ dispute is just one part of BitRiver’s broader financial unraveling. The company faces mounting electricity debts and multiple lawsuits from energy suppliers.\n\nCourts are reviewing claims totaling more than 940 million rubles ($12.2 million), including 133 million from En+ Sbyt, 640 million from the Irkutsk Electric Grid Company, and 168.7 million already awarded to NTEK. Regional utilities under Rosseti have also filed collection suits.\n\nBitRiver’s internal structure has deteriorated in parallel. Layoffs began in early 2025, followed by salary delays and executive resignations.",

    "fullText": "The transfer window closes tonight at 7pm after over a month of business across the Premier League.\n\nHowever, fans hoping to see late activity in the market at their clubs can keep the faith beyond 7pm.\n\nClubs are still allowed to strike deals after that time, provided they meet a specific rule that grants them a two-hour extension to finalise signings.\n\nA deal sheet is effectively a way for clubs to tell the Premier League that a transfer has been agreed – but they just need a bit more time to finalise the official documents.\n\nPremier League clubs can only use a deal sheet after 5pm, and it must be submitted before 7pm.\n\nIf all the relevant details are filled in, the Premier League grant an extra two hours for the deal to be completed.\n\nYou can see an example of a deal sheet below.\n\nArsenal signed Raheem Sterling using a deal sheet in summer 2024 – and once all media duties had been carried out, the Gunners ended up announcing the signing around 2am.\n\nHowever, this is only applicable to domestic transfers, and clubs must comply with the FIFA Transfer Matching System (TMS) deadline of midnight if they want to complete an international signing from abroad.\n\nThe Premier League describe the FIFA Transfer Matching System as follows.\n\n“When there is an international transfer, the buying and selling clubs have to register it on FIFA’s Transfer Matching System (TMS) in order for international clearance to be generated.\n\n“The buying club have to upload all the information to the system and the foreign club have to match all the details.\n\n“Our FA will request clearance and, as long as everything matches, the foreign association will issue clearance to the FA, who then informs the club and League.”\n\nIn years gone by, those in the English Football League (EFL) – meaning Championship, League One and League Two clubs – have also been allowed to submit a deal sheet for late transfers.\n\nHowever, the EFL have now put a stop to it.\n\nAn official statement reads: “In the EFL, all documentation must be provided prior to the deadline closing for the registration of a player to go through.”\n\nThere is – however – the presence of a ‘quick application’ which gives EFL clubs an extra 15 minutes to finalise transfers.\n\nIt is said: “If a club is in a Full Application at 10:30pm, they will receive a warning that states the system will open a Quick Application at 10:45pm, where only certain fields need to be completed.\n\n“In those last 15 minutes of the Transfer Window, EFL systems allow clubs to submit the necessary registration form without completing the full application process. Where they do this, the clubs then have a further 15 minutes to complete the full application process. This avoids clubs missing the deadline in circumstances where they have agreed and signed all necessary documents with another club and the player before 11pm, but still need time to complete the full application.”",

How many of you went to a Stop the Steal protest with a loaded automatic weapon?”—prompting the entire room of ICE agents to raise their hands.\n\n“You gotta do better,” Davidson says, briefly breaking character. “I’m Tom Homan, OK? I am the separating-families-at-the-border guy. I’m the on-film-taking-a-$50,000-bribe guy. And y’all are making me look like the upstanding, reasonable adult in the room.

    "fullText": "The blueberry and strawberry fields at Southern Hill Farms were buried in chunks of ice.\n\nWhile it can look picturesque amid the morning sun, it can also be catastrophic to the plants – and the farmers' business.\n\nThe plants were sprayed with light water overnight to create a thin ice layer, which helps to protect the plants. Too much ice, however, can cause the plants to break and topple over.\n\n\"Freeze nights like this are physically exhausting and emotionally heavy. One wrong shift in temperature, wind, or timing can mean the loss of an entire crop, months of planning and care gone in a single night.\"\n\nCLERMONT, Fla. - In the light of day, it looks like a glass forest. Every leaf, every branch, and every fruit in this Lake County field is encased in a thick, translucent armor.\n\nBut for the farmers here, this isn’t a winter wonderland.\n\nThe owners and staff at Southern Hill Farms in Clermont, Florida, did not sleep – staying awake throughout the night to monitor their plants and fields as freezing temperatures hit the area.\n\n\"We knew it was gonna be a terrible night. When you make ice at eight o'clock, it's gonna be bad, bad night,\" said David Hill, one of the owners.\n\n\"We've done this a million times when it was a cold event. We run overhead irrigation to either to wash frost off or to freeze, put a protective layer of water, ice around the berry and the plant. Normally, it's 30 degrees, 32 degrees, wind's not real high. The event we had last night was catastrophic.\"\n\nThe ice got too heavy for some of the sprinklers that hover above the fields. So, when the plants became to heavy and fell, the sprinkler systems go with it.\n\n\"We've got overhead irrigation pipes in field and they were, you know, the the plants are all around there and they were solid ice, they would take down the pipes with it,\" the owners said.\n\nSunday night brings more freezing temperatures to the area. The farm closed Saturday and Sunday due to the ice.\n\nWhat's next is to get through the night, evaluate the damage, and then figure out how to move forward.\n\n\"During a freeze event, farmers use overhead irrigation to protect crops by continuously applying water. As that water freezes, it releases heat, creating a protective layer of ice that helps keep plants at a survivable temperature. It’s a delicate balance that requires constant monitoring, long hours, and a whole lot of experience,\" the farm wrote on its Facebook page.\n\n\"Freeze nights like this are physically exhausting and emotionally heavy. One wrong shift in temperature, wind, or timing can mean the loss of an entire crop, months of planning and care gone in a single night.\"\n\nFOX 35's Jessica Dobson was at Southern Hill Farms on Sunday morning, Feb. 1, 2026. She talked to the owners and gave viewers a first-hand look at the ice. Southern Hill also posted about the ice and freezing temperatures on its Facebook page.",

    "fullText": "TAIPEI, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang praised and lightly cajoled his major Taiwanese suppliers to produce more to help power strong demand for AI, capping a visit ​to the island of his birth, where he has been mobbed by adoring fans at ‌every step.\n\nSpeaking at an impromptu press conference in the rain outside a Taipei restaurant late on Saturday, where he had hosted suppliers ‌for a \"trillion-dollar dinner\", named after the market capitalisation of those firms attending, Huang said this would be another good year for business.\n\n\"TSMC needs to work very hard this year because I need a lot of wafers,\" he said, laughing, referring to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, the world's largest producer of advanced chips used in artificial-intelligence applications.\n\n\"TSMC is ⁠doing an incredible job and they're working ‌very, very hard. We have a lot of demand this year,\" he added after taking pictures with a beaming TSMC CEO C.C. Wei.\n\n\"Over the next 10 years, TSMC ‍will likely increase their capacity by much more than 100%, and so this is a very substantial scale-up in the next decade.\"\n\nWei did not answer questions from reporters.\n\nLast month, TSMC said capital spending could jump as much as 37% this ​year to $56 billion, and would increase \"significantly\" in 2028 and 2029 given AI demand.\n\nHuang, who emigrated to the ‌United States as a child, is met by a throng of adoring fans wherever he returns to Taiwan. Local media, who refer to him as \"the people's dad\", breathlessly report on his every move.\n\nHuang co-founded California-based Nvidia in 1993. Last year, it became the first company to breach $5 trillion in market value, continuing a meteoric rise that has firmly positioned it at the heart of the global AI revolution.\n\nIn Taipei, he expressed concern about ⁠supplies of memory chips, which support AI workloads, amid a ​production crunch.\n\n\"We need a lot of memory this year,\" he said. \"I ​think that the entire supply chain is challenging this year because demand is so much more.\"\n\nHuang periodically stepped out of the dinner, attended by two dozen executives, including Young ‍Liu, chairman of contract-electronics maker ⁠Foxconn, Nvidia's biggest server maker, to greet his fans and sign autographs.\n\n\"We have so many partners here in Taiwan. Nvidia won't be possible without Taiwan. There's magic in this island. The companies here ⁠have extraordinary technology, they've incredible culture,\" he said, when asked about how he felt about his movie star-like fame whenever he visits.",

    "description": "When cosmetics meets corporate finance, JPMorgan's Fei-Fei Zhang is often at the intersection. Here's what she predicts for the business of beauty.",
    "fullText": "The cosmetics industry's glamour has caught Wall Street's eye — and investors are recognizing that beauty is more than skin deep.\n\nBeauty has become a booming sector, driven by a wave of savvy social media creators and startups that are shaping trends and fueling spending. The consulting firm McKinsey predicts that, by 2030, the industry could be worth nearly $600 billion. At JPMorgan, Fei-Fei Zhang is shaping how the bank is approaching the opportunity.\n\nInvestment banker Zhang, JPMorgan's head of beauty for North America, has advised on a string of blockbuster deals asector hasctor's gained momentum. Zhang was a senior leader on the team behind the $1 billion sale of Rhode, the skincare brand cofounded by Hailey Bieber, to e.l.f. Beauty, announced last May.\n\nWithin weeks, British skincare brand Medik8 was sold to cosmetics giant L'Oreal for more than $1 billion, which Zhang advised on. She also helped Mammoth Brands — founded by the team behind grooming brand Harry's — on its October purchase of the diaper brand Coterie, marking a foray into the vast baby care market.\n\nIn April 2025, the bank promoted Zhang to its most powerful rank — managing director — the culmination of the professional rise for a self-proclaimed beauty industry aficionado who started working at JPMorgan as an intern in 2011. By the time she'd made VP, she was pushing her higher-ups to expand in the sector, becoming an architect of its burgeoning cosmetics industry strategy.\n\nBusiness Insider spoke with Zhang about her predictions for dealmaking in 2026, what makes brands stand out in the boardroom, and how it felt to be a part of the sale of Rhode. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhat are you getting excited about in 2026?\n\nSpecific to beauty, acquisitions have always been central to the industry. One theme we saw last year that will likely carry through is what I'd call corporate clarity. We started to see an uptick in corporate carve-outs, with strategics reorienting their portfolios toward growth platforms and greater margin accretion.\n\nThe other driver remains core to the industry: acquisitions of high-growth independent brands that fill portfolio gaps — whether immediately for strategics or through a multi-step path that may involve private equity first.\n\nHow do private equity firms and corporate buyers approach beauty differently? Do you expect the PE firms to step up their activity this year?\n\nBeauty has very attractive qualities for private equity. It's a highly replenishable category, it has stable growth characteristics, and it has proven resilient through economic cycles. When you look at the financials, you often see strong margins and high free-cash-flow generation.\n\nWhat has shifted is discipline. Buyers are more discerning and are evaluating opportunities with elevated expectations around scale, growth, profitability, and brand history. That reflects lessons learned from prior cycles, including the very high level of M&A activity in 2021.\n\nHow are influencer trends shaping the industry in the boardroom?\n\nOn social media, the impact has been transformative. It has fundamentally reshaped the beauty industry, enabling an explosion of new entrants and accelerating how quickly a product or brand can gain traction.\n\nThe same forces that propel rapid growth can create challenging expectations to sustain it. Brands are scaling faster than ever, but a key question becomes whether they have the resonance and infrastructure to deliver durable, long-term growth. That question directly affects M&A prospects.\n\nHow do buyers evaluate the role of social media engagement when they're thinking about buying a cosmetics company?\n\nSocial engagement is incredibly important, but it's only one part of the picture. Buyers are ultimately looking for a powerful identity. They ask: How differentiated is the brand voice? How defensible is it? Does it engender consumer loyalty and advocacy?\n\nYou then want to see that translate into the business itself — a financial profile that delivers consistent growth and demonstrates durability. What we see buyers really looking for in today's crowded market is longevity. You can build momentum quickly, but the question is whether that growth is sustainable over the long term.\n\nTell me a little bit about the Rhode deal. How did it come together?\n\nWe have a platform that's really designed to support companies through every stage of their lifecycle — from that early growth stage to the ultimate exit. The Rhode transaction is a reflection of that.\n\nWe were able to support the company earlier through our commercial banking capabilities and act as a thought partner. Being able to work with a client over time and ultimately help navigate a strategic transaction is what makes the job so exciting and dynamic.\n\nWhat drew you to the beauty sector in the first place?\n\nI grew up going with my mom to the department store counters and got my first skincare regimen when I was probably too young to say — a preteen. It's always been a personal interest of mine.\n\nEarly in my career, it became increasingly clear that there was a huge opportunity in beauty given the rapid pace of deal activity happening across the category. Emerging brands in particular are an incredibly important part of the beauty ecosystem. Those founders need partners and advisors to help them navigate growth and assess opportunities in a sector that moves very quickly.\n\nWhen I was a vice president, I saw an opportunity to form a sector specialty in beauty. My pitch to senior leadership was to invest early, and leverage our full platform to support these founders, leaders, and investors; be their thought partner; and earn their trust as they navigated those important strategic decisions, up to and including a potential sale process. Fortunately, this approach has proven successful.\n\nFor me, being able to work with companies over time and help them navigate those decisions is incredibly rewarding.",

    "description": "In this Sunday edition of Business Insider Today, we're talking about workers who were laid off in a job market where résumé doesn't take them as far.",
    "fullText": "There's no sugarcoating last week's layoffs.\n\nAmazon is cutting 16,000 corporate jobs, pushing thousands of workers into a job market already crowded with tech talent. Business Insider was all over the news, with scoop after scoop, including internal messages revealing which teams and jobs were affected.\n\nThe layoffs followed the 14,000 job cuts Amazon announced back in October.\n\nUPS expects to eliminate 30,000 roles, on top of the 48,000 cuts it announced last year. Home Depot is laying off 800 corporate employees. Pinterest said it's cutting 15% of its staff.\n\nMy colleague Jacob Zinkula, who covers the economy, has spoken with dozens of laid-off workers over the past year, many from Big Tech companies, including Amazon.\n\nA clear theme has emerged. Many built careers years ago when opportunities felt endless. Now, even strong résumés and big-name employers don't guarantee a quick bounce-back.\n\nPart of the reason is simple math. US businesses are hiring at one of the slowest rates since 2013.\n\nAnd the early impact of AI is starting to show up, too. Companies are finding ways to run leaner. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said AI can now let one employee do the work of entire teams — a shift that's shaping how companies think about hiring.\n\nStill, it's not all doom and gloom.\n\nJacob recently spoke with Iren Azra Zou, a 27-year-old former Amazon employee in New Jersey, who was laid off in October. She explained how she landed a new job just two weeks later.\n\nHer advice for other laid-off tech workers:\n\n\"Looking back, I see the layoff as a turning point because it helped me clarify what I wanted in my next role,\" she said. \"It was still difficult, but I felt more grounded and optimistic as time went on — and ultimately landed a role I feel great about.\"",

    "description": "Two Business Insider reporters attended Starbucks' Investor Day and got a firsthand look at how the brand plans to build momentum with its turnaround.",
    "fullText": "Starbucks' new \"Ristretto\" concept, as the company called it — named after the short-pulled espresso shot — aims to reduce average build costs by about 20% while optimizing overall footprint, Chief Financial Officer Cathy Smith said.\n\nThe walk-thru mockup featured cushy furniture, digital menus, merch displays, and a callback to Starbucks' 1971 founding above the door.\n\nSmith forecast 600 to 650 new stores opening globally in the current fiscal year, rising to over 2,000 in fiscal year 2028. Roughly 400 of the new US coffeehouses coming by 2028 are expected to be company-owned.\n\nWalking through the coffeehouse setup, with Simple Plan's \"I'm Just a Kid\" playing on the speakers, it was hard not to think back to our teenage years when Starbucks was the hangout spot, which perhaps was the point.\n\nExecs stressed Starbucks' desire to become a \"third place.\"\n\n\"We have a unique opportunity to connect people over coffee during a time when loneliness is pervasive,\" Global Chief Brand Officer Tressie Lieberman said.\n\nThe furniture, including the \"Starbucks lounge icon,\" as the display next to the chair pictured above read, was designed to get people to sit and hang out for a while.\n\nNiccol said the company plans to add 25,000 additional seats to its US company-operated stores by the end of its fiscal year and replace thousands more with \"more comfortable options.\"\n\n\"Customers are already responding with longer dwell times and, frankly, improved customer satisfaction and connections,\" he added.\n\nStarbucks plans to introduce digital menu boards in all of its US company-operated stores over the next 18 months, separating its morning and afternoon menus to better target customer preferences.\n\n\"The morning is very much a ritual,\" Niccol said during the company's earnings call on Wednesday. \"The afternoon is really a reset — and depending on where you are in that reset, you sometimes want a blended drink, you sometimes want an energy drink, you sometimes want a sparkling drink, and you sometimes want protein.\"\n\nStarbucks plans to expand its wellness offerings to meet that demand.\n\nStarbucks offered samples of global flavors like an ube macchiatto, a reformulated Chai latte with mango cold foam, and a strawberry açaí refresher, available three ways: decaffeinated, caffeinated, or with an energy boost.\n\nWe also sampled some bakery items, including a croissant-like uzu citrus blossom with a tasty uzu filling.\n\nStarbucks is rolling out new front and back-end technologies to make baristas' jobs easier — and help you get your order faster.\n\nThe company's mobile app has gotten a facelift, and a new loyalty program is rolling out in March. Its new point-of-sale system, also coming this year, aims to reduce staff training time and the time it takes to place an order.\n\nThe Mastrena III espresso machine, rolling out in 2027, halves the time it takes to brew espresso while maintaining the quality, Starbucks says.\n\nStarbucks also showed off Green Dot Assist, an AI-powered assistant that gives baristas recipes and other information about an order on a tablet to speed up production.\n\nThe Q&A session lasted nearly an hour, during which analysts pressed the executives for more specifics on their plan.\n\nDespite the optimism onstage, investors pressed executives on the company's long-term plan. Shares slid about 1% during the presentations, after a brief pop earlier in the week before earnings.\n\nThe execs responded to several questions about Starbucks' operating margins and its recent deal with Boyu Capital to sell off 60% of its China business. Investors also wanted more details on how Starbucks will navigate ongoing supply chain snarls and encourage employees to have an \"ownership mentality\" to grow with the brand.\n\nAbout five hours after it began, Rodriguez left investor day buzzing with caffeine and headed back to Business Insider's New York headquarters.\n\nOn the West Coast, Business Insider's Katherine Tangalakis-Lippert — equally caffeinated after a 3 a.m. wake-up — was already on the phone with analysts. Their verdict: Starbucks has gone on offense, laying out growth plans that are credible, if not exactly blockbuster.\n\nTogether, the two reporters walked away with a sharper view of where Starbucks' strategy is headed next.\n\nThe company hopes it can reignite momentum by making its cafés more inviting and pushing harder on menu innovation. There's still work to do — but Starbucks believes its comeback is no longer theoretical.\n\nDo you have a story to share about Starbucks?

    "fullText": "App endured a major outage and user backlash over perceived censorship. Now it’s facing an inquiry by the California governor and an ascendant competitor\n\nA little more than one week ago, TikTok stepped on to US shores as a naturalized citizen. Ever since, the video app has been fighting for its life.\n\nTikTok’s calamitous emigration began on 22 January when its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, finalized a deal to sell the app to a group of US investors, among them the business software giant Oracle. The app’s time under Chinese ownership had been marked by a meteoric ascent to more than a billion users, which left incumbents such as Instagram looking like the next Myspace. But TikTok’s short new life in the US has been less than auspicious.\n\nThe day after TikTok’s arrival, its owners altered its privacy policy to permit more extensive data collection, including tracking the precise locations of its users. The change was notable less for any potential invasion of privacy than for suspicion of the new owners. The updated policy falls in line with those of other major social networks. But what did these men, among them billionaire Oracle owner and Maga donor Larry Ellison, intend to do with the user data? The tweaks aroused suspicion that would blossom into paranoia just a few days later.\n\nDuring the weekend that followed the transfer of TikTok’s ownership, the US weathered two major events. A hefty, frigid snowstorm slammed the country and put about 230 million people on alert for power outages and burst pipes. And federal immigration officers killed a 37-year-old US citizen in Minneapolis during a protest, which elicited outright lies from the White House despite copious video footage. Both would knock TikTok off its feet, though in different ways.\n\nWinter Storm Fern crippled multiple Oracle datacenters that TikTok relies on, which the company did not make public at the time. The app suffered severe outages as a result, according to a statement from the company. Many users said they were unable to upload videos. Others said their videos received zero views despite significant followings.\n\nSimultaneously, prominent personalities were attempting to use TikTok to express their outrage over the violent death of Alex Pretti at the hands and guns of border patrol agents. They found they could not post videos or that they received zero views. In response, many users – among them California state senator Scott Weiner, musician Billie Eilish and her brother, and comedian Meg Stalter – accused TikTok of stifling videos critical of federal immigration agents. Stalter said she would delete her account, which boasts nearly 280,000 followers. Media outlets far and wide – the New York Times, Variety, the Independent, CNN, the Washington Post – picked up their claims. Cosmopolitan magazine asked: “Is TikTok Censoring Anti-ICE Content?” The Democratic senator Chris Murphy, from Connecticut, tweeted that TikTok’s alleged censorship was a “threat to democracy”.\n\nAfter days of outcry online, IRL scrutiny and likely dozens of requests for clarification from the press, TikTok issued a statement blaming the problems on the snow, ice and cold on 26 January.\n\nOracle issued a statement with more detail: “Over the weekend, an Oracle datacenter experienced a temporary weather-related power outage which impacted TikTok. The challenges US TikTok users may be experiencing are the result of technical issues that followed the power outage.” It is uncommon for a physical event like a storm to wound a major site of digital life like TikTok, as such popular apps often have backups to their backups, but it can happen.\n\nThe most powerful figure to accuse TikTok of censorship was not its most famous user. The governor of California is better known for his textual presence on X than his TikToks. Nevertheless, Gavin Newsom announced on 27 January that his office would investigate whether TikTok had censored videos critical of Donald Trump, broadening the scope of alleged pro-Maga interference by the app.\n\nThe late attribution of blame did little to assuage public criticism. An unknown number of users said they were decamping from the new American TikTok in response to its perceived censorship. The exodus has propelled a new competitor, Upscrolled, which promises less censorship than TikTok, to the top spot in the US Apple App Store and the third spot in the Google Play Store. An Upscrolled press release now claims more than a million users. As of writing, TikTok rests at No 16 in the iPhone App Store and 10th in the Google Play Store. Alongside Upscrolled in the top 10 most downloaded are three apps used to cloak online activity from surveillance, which are known as virtual private networks (VPNs). A fear of digital government incursions is in the air.\n\nWith more than a billion users worldwide, it seems unlikely that TikTok will altogether vanish as a result of these failures. Facebook and Instagram have withstood far graver scandals than this. TikTok’s first week in the US does not bode well for its future, though. The app has damaged user trust, and another misstep may inflict a more lasting injury.\n\nTikTok’s week of mayhem began with Trump. The transfer of TikTok’s ownership consummated the ban-or-sell deal the US president proposed nearly six years ago, and he said he was thrilled that that the transfer had finally taken place. In the intervening years, Trump had walked back his support for the deal; his enemy Joe Biden had supported it during his presidency; Congress had passed a law codifying Trump’s wishes and legally forcing TikTok’s sale; and the US supreme court had ratified the law in the face of a challenge by TikTok and immense popular disapproval. Then Trump ordered the immigration crackdown that set the stage for the killing of two US citizens. The only aspect of TikTok’s miserable week Trump had no hand in was the winter weather.\n\nTikTok’s disastrous arrival marks an anniversary of a similar bungled nature. One year and two weeks ago, the app stopped functioning in the US because of the same sell-or-ban law that precipitated the sale. That darkening lasted less than 24 hours. Its new owners can only hope their present problems go away just as soon.",

Yet much academic misconduct remains unexposed, and its broader consequences are further obscured by the sorting of individuals into careers based on probity. Applying advanced plagiarism-detection algorithms to half a million publicly available graduate dissertations in China, we uncover hidden misconduct and validate it against incentivized measures of honesty. Linking plagiarism records to rich administrative data, we document four main findings. First, plagiarism is pervasive and predicts adverse political selection: plagiarists are more likely to enter and advance in the public sector. Second, plagiarists perform worse when holding power: focusing on the judiciary and exploiting quasi-random case assignments, we find that judges with plagiarism histories issue more preferential rulings and attract a greater number of appeals — effects partly mitigated by trial livestreaming. Third, plagiarizing judges generate spillovers onto other judges and lawyers. Fourth, exploiting the staggered adoption of detection tools, we demonstrate that enforcing academic integrity leads to modest improvements in future professional conduct.\n\n Acknowledgements and Disclosures\n\nWe thank Ying Bai, Yiming Cao, Yunchien Chang, Chiman Cheung, Ruben Durante, Ray Fisman, Edward Glaeser, Guojun He, Andrew Kao, Muhammad Yasir Khan, Jonathan Klick, James Kung, Bingjing Li, Vincent Pons, Jesse Shapiro, Uta Schoenberg, Michael Song, Yongxiang Wang, Jaya Wen, Yanhui Wu, David Y.

    "fullText": "After covering the Grammy Awards for nearly two decades, there are a few moments I know will happen on music's biggest night: Someone will go home happy, and someone will go home sad.\n\nEither way, we'll get Trevor Noah as the host for his sixth and final time, performances you'll text about, and candid moments between our favorite singers seated inside LA's Crypto.com Arena on Sunday. It'll all air on CBS.\n\nKendrick Lamar leads with nine nominations, including in the major categories such as Record, Album, and Song of the Year, followed by Lady Gaga and producers Cirkut and Jack Antonoff with seven. We'll also be watching Super Bowl performer Bad Bunny, Sabrina Carpenter, and my personal favorite, Leon Thomas, to see if they go home with trophies after nabbing six nods.\n\nI asked Business Insider's entertainment team who they thought would go home with a small, 24K gold-plated gramophone. Here's what they're betting on:\n\nJason Guerrasio, Entertainment correspondent: Tucked away in the midst of the 90-plus Grammy categories is Best Album Cover. I hope it goes to Perfume Genius' \"Glory\" cover. Google it. It's instantly eye-catching.\n\nSamantha Rollins, deputy editor of Entertainment: When \"Mayhem\" single \"Abracadabra\" debuted during a commercial break at last year's Grammys, many posited that Lady Gaga's newest album would take a back-to-basics approach to the edgy electropop that made her famous. What emerged instead was far more interesting. Lady Gaga's \"Mayhem\" is an invigorating return to form that proves one of pop's most famous shape-shifters can still keep us guessing. She'll take it for Album of the Year.\n\nCallie Ahlgrim, senior pop culture writer: Record of the Year is supposed to honor the most superb blend of production and performance, but since it tends to favor ubiquity, I have to give the edge to the global pop smash \"APT.\" Bruno Mars has the cross-generational appeal that Grammy voters can't resist, and Rosé would make history as the first K-pop star to win in a competitive category.",

    "title": "For Western forces in the Arctic, the cold itself is one of their toughest enemies",
    "description": "Business Insider visited NATO soldiers training above the Arctic Circle. They said they put newspaper in their boots to keep them dry.",
    "fullText": "SODANKYLÄ, Finland — Deep snow. Fleeting daylight. Wet clothes. Frozen weapons. Sub-zero temperatures.\n\nNATO soldiers training in Arctic warfare are learning that in a future conflict, fighting the enemy may be only half the battle. The other would be surviving the region's harsh winters.\n\n\"The environment can be hard for someone who is not used to it,\" said Finnish Lt. Laura Lähdekorpi, bundled up and dressed in camouflage to blend in with the snow.\n\nLähdekorpi is among roughly 20 NATO soldiers participating in an Arctic warfare training and cold-weather survival course led by the Finnish Army's Jaeger Brigade, which specializes in winter combat.\n\nThe monthlong course is conducted far above the Arctic Circle, in Finland's snow-covered Lapland region, where soldiers see just a few hours of sunlight each day and experience temperatures that regularly drop well below 0 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nWith growing Russian and Chinese activity across the Arctic, NATO officials are stressing the need for greater readiness in the region. The training course helps Western soldiers sharpen their ability to fight on frozen battlefields, where the military alliance could find itself at war next amid rising competition.\n\n\"The Arctic, overall, is changing,\" Canadian Cpt. Vincent Lemelin, another soldier participating in the course, told Business Insider during a visit to Lapland this week. \"So we need to know much more expertise to be able to face these changes.\"\n\nThe first of the Arctic warfare training course's three phases focuses on how to move and survive in winter conditions, teaching soldiers skills such as drying wet clothes, crossing the forest on skis, and preventing their weapons from freezing.\n\nMaj. Mikael Aikio, the Arctic section leader of the Jaeger Brigade who oversees the course, said some of the biggest challenges soldiers face in this environment are maintaining combat readiness in extreme temperatures (below -14 degrees Fahrenheit) and moving around in the deep, soft snow that blankets Lapland this time of year.\n\nCold temperatures can make it hard to keep equipment functioning properly and strain soldiers' physical and mental well-being. After a long day of exertion, even simple tasks like eating and drinking, which are critical in these conditions to replenish calories and stay hydrated, may feel daunting.\n\nThe unforgiving Arctic environment can be as dangerous as the enemy, especially for soldiers who aren't trained for such conditions, Aikio told Business Insider, warning that unfamiliar terrain and extreme cold can have a huge impact. Even well-trained units aren't immune, he added. In severe cold, the environment still takes a heavy toll.\n\nLähdekorpi, the Finn, said the cold weather could distract soldiers in combat, leaving them more focused on getting warm than on fighting the enemy.\n\nThe persistent deep snow in the winter creates significant mobility challenges for soldiers. In the course, they learn to traverse the forest on skis and snowmobiles, even using these tools to conduct an assault against a simulated enemy force during the second phase of the training.\n\nLemelin, the Canadian, said survival in the Arctic is directly linked to movement. Mobility is far slower and more physically demanding than in other places, he said. Snow is constant and effectively part of the enemy.\n\nThat slower pace isn't a drawback. Sweating in extreme cold can be dangerous, as moisture can freeze, so soldiers are trained to move deliberately, take frequent breaks, and wear layers they can remove as conditions change.\n\nWhen soldiers start moving, they should be a little cold, Aikio said. After roughly 15 minutes on skis, units typically stop to shed layers.\n\nKeeping clothes and gear dry is another challenge soldiers face in the Arctic. Getting wet — a frequent occurrence in this region with all the snow and hidden sources of water — forces them to expend more energy to warm up.\n\nSoldiers wear fishnet fabric and wool as their layers and carry extra clothing in their backpacks. They dry clothing by hanging it on makeshift wooden tripods or placing it near the fire or in warm tents.\n\nFor wet boots, which Lähdekorpi said are the hardest to dry, soldiers crumple up newspaper and shove it inside to absorb moisture.\n\nWhile the harsh environment poses a different threat to soldiers than enemy artillery fire, it's still treacherous because cold-weather casualties before the fight even starts can put one side at a significant disadvantage, Lemelin said.\n\nConsidering the substantial challenges of operating in the Arctic, soldiers and course leadership view the training as a critical means of preparing them for the frozen battlefields NATO forces could one day face. The cold is an obstacle, but not an insurmountable wall; the aim is to learn to adapt and ultimately thrive in these brutal conditions.\n\n\"Embrace the cold,\" Lemelin said, \"and then warm up when there's the opportunity.\"",

    "fullText": "BEIJING (AP) — U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer arrived in the Chinese financial center of Shanghai on Friday in his bid to boost business opportunities for British firms in the world's second-largest economy, just hours after U.S. President Donald Trump signaled a possible opposition to any deal between Beijing and London.\n\nWhy are foreign leaders increasing visits to Beijing?\n\nWhat agreement was reached on British lawmakers sanctions?\n\nWhat business opportunities is Starmer seeking in China?\n\nHow did Trump respond to UK-China negotiations?\n\nStarmer, the center-left Labour leader, has brought more than 50 business leaders on his trip to China, the first by a U.K. prime minister in eight years.\n\nStarmer suggested Trump’s criticism was aimed more at Canada than Britain. He added that Washington was aware in advance of his trip and its objectives and pointed out that Trump has said he plans to visit China this spring.\n\n“I don’t think it’s wise for the United Kingdom to stick its head in the sand,” Starmer told Sky News. “China is the second biggest economy in the world. Along with Hong Kong, it’s our third-biggest trading partner. And through this visit, we’ve opened up lots of opportunities for jobs and wealth creation.”\n\nStarmer started his trip in Beijing on Thursday, where he met with Chinese leaders including Xi Jinping. The two pledged to pursue a long-term and stable strategic partnership in what was seen as a sign of improving ties after several years of friction between the two countries.\n\nIn Washington, Trump suggested that he may oppose any deal between Beijing and London, and then pivoted to Canada, with which he has had a series of sharp exchanges since Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney visited China earlier this month.\n\n“Well, it’s very dangerous for them to do that,” he said, when asked about Starmer’s visit and any U.K. trade talks with Beijing. “And it’s even more dangerous, I think, for Canada to get into business with China. Canada is not doing well. They’re doing very poorly.”\n\n“You can’t look at China as the answer,” he said.\n\nStarmer and Carney are among a series of foreign leaders to visit Beijing as their nations seek to improve ties with China. Many have seen their countries’ economies buffeted by Trump’s tariffs and are looking to expand other export markets.\n\nThe British prime minister said Xi agreed to remove a travel ban that had been imposed on several British lawmakers after the U.K.'s former center-right Conservative government joined the European Union, Canada and the U.S. in imposing sanctions on four Chinese officials over evidence of rights abuses against the Uyghur Muslim people in the far western Xinjiang region.\n\n“This has been a cause of concern in Parliament and for parliamentarians for some time and that is why I raised it on this visit,\" Starmer told ITV News. “The response from the Chinese is that the restrictions no longer apply and President Xi has told me that that means that all parliamentarians are welcome to visit.”",

    "description": "Job seekers can stand out by contacting employers before roles are posted, a veteran career coach told Business Insider.",
    "fullText": "The best way to beat the line for a job is to show up before there is one.\n\nTalking with an employer before the company ever posts a job — not after — could help you land a role there, veteran career coach Laura Labovich told Business Insider.\n\nShe recommends that job seekers identify where they want to work, examine their network for any ties to the organization, and start building relationships inside well before a job post even goes up.\n\n\"The way to win is to not apply. Get in before they have the opening. Make connections. Become an insider,\" Labovich said.\n\nIf you wait until you see a job post before contacting an employer, she said, you might already be too late. That's because once a role is posted, recruiters or HR will often feel compelled to tell you to apply online — even if they already know you — in order to ensure all candidates get equal consideration, Labovich said.\n\nGetting in line with everybody else can make the process seem \"more like a cattle call,\" she said.\n\nAside from generally feeling lousy, the take-a-number approach is also rarely the best path to landing a role, as almost anyone seeking a desk job can attest.\n\nThe average corporate job posting draws 250 applicants, Glassdoor reported in 2025. Among those, only four to six candidates typically advance to the interview round. And, of course, only one person ultimately gets the offer letter.\n\nHaving someone who can show your résumé to a recruiter or hiring manager and help you stand out is \"worth its weight in gold\" when there are so many people looking for jobs, said Rick Wargo, managing partner of the global technology practice at the recruitment firm Boyden.\n\n\"A warm introduction is always the best way to go about a job search,\" he told Business Insider.\n\nOf course, if you don't know about a forthcoming job, you can't make a pitch for it. Yet that doesn't mean you're powerless. What you can do is consider whether the employer has hired for the kinds of roles you might want — and use that insight to guide early outreach.\n\nThat's why, Wargo said, it's smart to start networking and making connections inside key companies long before you need a job.\n\n\"You don't go to fix the roof when it's raining,\" he said.\n\nTo beat the rush that often occurs when an employer lists an opening, you can contact people who might be at your level within an organization and ask questions such as, \"How do you like your job?\" \"How do you like the organization?\" and \"How did you get to where you did?\" said Labovich, who runs Career Strategy Group, an outplacement firm in the Washington, DC, area.\n\nIf it's someone higher up the food chain — potentially someone who might be the hiring manager for a future job — the ask should be smaller, she said.\n\n\"You don't want to say, 'I want a job,' because if you're getting to them early, there's no job yet,\" Labovich said. Instead, she recommends that job seekers seek advice, insight, recommendations, and referrals.\n\nThat contact can pay off: Messaging a hiring manager nearly triples your chance of getting hired, LinkedIn reports.\n\nUltimately, Labovich said, making connections inside an organization is one of the best ways to navigate a hiring process that often feels \"totally broken.\"\n\nThat's left many job seekers applying to as many roles as they can, even though many career coaches, including Labovich, urge that people prioritize networking instead.\n\n\"The way to apply for a job these days is to not apply for a job,\" she said.\n\nDo you have a story to share about your career?

    "fullText": "A small business owner near Minneapolis said both staff and customers fear ICE activity in the area.\n\nHe's concerned about the safety of his employees, who sometimes miss shifts to avoid immigration officers.\n\nNational activists are encouraging another economic blackout to protest ICE activity.\n\nThis as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Michael Knox, co-owner of Toma Mojo Grill near Minneapolis. This story has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI run a fast casual chicken restaurant in Richfield, Minnesota, a suburb just south of Minneapolis.\n\nWith ICE agents in the area, I don't know when — or if — staff will be able to come to work. We all have pretty set schedules, and we're tight-knit. There are only six of us operating this place, seven days a week. And I have concerns: Are my employees going to get stopped on their way to work? Are they going to be hassled or detained? Are they going to come back?\n\nIt's a day-by-day thing. Over the past couple of weeks, we've adjusted our hours, opening later and closing earlier. I've been picking up everyone's shifts, but I can't physically work 16 hours a day, seven days a week. We had to close last week so that I could have a day off. I had a doctor's appointment that I couldn't miss.\n\nSome of my employees don't feel comfortable leaving their houses. If they tell me they can't come to the restaurant, my policy, of course, is \"no questions asked.\" I get it. But I'm not a wealthy businessman. If we're not serving guests our food, there's no money coming in, and we can't pay people. I wish that we were at a place where we could offer better PTO benefits, but we're not. That's been hard.\n\nWe're just trying to keep our people safe and our employees comfortable. We have a big bay window at the front of the restaurant where the full kitchen is visible. I'm going to make some modifications to the space that will make it harder to see inside. We don't know who's looking in now, or what their purpose is. We put up cameras that we didn't have before — we need to have a record of whatever happens here.\n\nAre you a business owner or employee affected by ICE in your area? Reach out to this reporter at allisonkelly@businessinsider.com or via Signal at alliekelly.10. Here's our guide to sharing information securely.\n\nI worry that ICE agents will come to my business to abduct my staff. I also worry that they're going to come enjoy hospitality, and that's going to get out to the public. I can only do what I think is good for me, my staff, and the restaurant. ICE agents are bad for business, no matter which way they come.\n\nLast week, my sales were down about 40% year over year. There are fewer delivery drivers and gig workers, so our takeout food is sitting longer before pickup. Our walk-in business is suffering too: After the sun goes down, we're seeing almost a noticeable drop in sales. That didn't previously happen. Now I have regulars who I haven't seen in weeks.\n\nI went to the strike with my friends and family last week to voice our dissatisfaction with the situation. My employees and I thought it was important to close that day too. Shutting down a restaurant on a Friday in January is devastating. It's the busy day, the day that pays for the rest of the week. That's a big sacrifice — but I know it's important.\n\nWhat's happening in Minneapolis should horrify every American. There's a very real, pervasive fear about what's going to happen next. That's bad for business. That's bad for life. And I'm worried that there's going to be more loss of life.\n\nSmall business owners are brave people. It takes a lot of guts to put everything on the line do something you really want to do, to present a product or service that you think is good enough to charge money for. They don't tend to be the quiet type. I'm not surprised they're speaking up.",

    "description": "Chinos walk the fine line between formal and casual, making them ideal for the office. Here are our top-tested pairs for business casual men's styling.",
    "fullText": "Suits are an easy choice when the dress code calls for formal attire, but they can be overkill in business-casual settings. You need wardrobe staples that'll cover your bases for when the stakes aren't quite as high, and that's where the best chinos for men come in.\n\nInvesting in the best business casual work clothes for men will inevitably include a reliable pair of chinos, so we've listed the top pairs, including those we've tested ourselves, to help you find what are sure to be your next favorite pants to live in. A tried-and-true favorite is the Bonobos Chinos 2.0, and for a more affordable option, we recommend the Quince Ultra-Stretch 24/7 Smart Chino.\n\nBonobos' trued and true chinos have a luxe feel that adds instant polish to your wardrobe.\n\nThe lightweight performance fabric has the subtle texture of a wool dress pant, but feels like your favorite yoga pant. Designed to look clean on the leg in a fit that tapers at the hem and sits neatly on the shoe.\n\nThis pair is made-to-measure and can be customized with interchangeable pockets, pleats, and button details.\n\nThe Bonobos Chinos 2.0 are highly regarded as among the best chinos for men for their super-luxe feel. The Italian milled cotton is soft and retains a vibrant hue, even after several rounds through the washing machine. A major perk is the option to choose from a wide range of colors, shapes and sizes. These range from 28 to 46 for waist, and from 28 to 36 for inseam lengths. You can choose between a tailored, slim, slim tapered, or athletic fit. Then, you can take your pick of 16 colors. These are more polished-looking chinos with crisp lines, but are worth having for a variety of occasions between business-casual and formal events.\n\nThe Quince direct-to-consumer business model makes their prices competitive, despite the quality of its apparel exceeding our expectations for basic wardrobe essentials. The Quince Ultra-Stretch 24/7 Smart Chino's value will become apparent the more you wear them, with a four-way stretch twill that provides the same flexibility as you'd expect from joggers. Plus, they're wrinkle-resistant, so you can pull them out as needed. Chinos that are this deceptively comfortable mean you can get the most use out of them anywhere along the spectrum of casual to semi-formal. \n\nRead our full Quince review.\n\nAs you may be able to guess from the brand's name, Indochino makes some of the best chinos for men. A fitting expert from one of their many showrooms can tell you your precise size in the Houndslow chinos, but if you can't make it to a storefront, their site has an in-depth tutorial on home measuring. Once you've found your perfect fit, you can further personalize them with custom pleats, hems, pockets, buttons, and belt loops. At $99, the Houndslows are also a great value for the high-quality, perfectly sized chinos you're guaranteed by going through their detailed fit screening. \n\nRead our full Indochino chinos review.\n\nPublic Rec is known for making menswear that's polished enough for the office, but comfortable enough for everyday life, and the Dealmaker Chinos do exactly that.\n\nSimilar to the wildly popular Gamechanger Rec Pant, the Dealmaker Chinos are incredibly stretchy, wrinkle-resistant, and thanks to its The Workday 2.0 Fabric, they're also wind- and water-resistant for all-season wear.\n\nThe Public Rec Dealmaker Chinos have a classic dressy look about them, yet can move with you in all directions of daily life.\n\nWoodies Clothing took off with their high-tech dress shirts, but their super comfortable chinos have thrived in the men's workwear space, too. They can be personalized with different combinations of custom pleats, pockets, and hems. The Woodies Premium Performance Stretch Pants are amid the best chinos for people unwilling to return to stiff slacks after living in work-from-home attire. What feels almost like joggers are really formal-presenting pants that are easy to style through every season. Their soft, two-way stretch, quick drying fabric is remarkably stain repellent — just the right chinos for the accident prone.\n\nRead our full Woodies performance chinos and dress shirt review.\n\nFor many men who shop big and tall sizes, finding comfortable formal wear can pose a serious challenge. But dressing up with an athletic build doesn't have to mean feeling squeezed into a suit all day — Dockers' Ultimate Chinos will assure you that. These come in extended waist sizes with extra room in the seat and thighs so as to not constrict you, even when you're sitting for long periods of time. The four-way Smart 360 Flex™ material allows for more mobility, and the extended inseam lengths position the knee correctly before tapering off towards the hem.\n\nAs one of the undeniable symbols of Americana, Polo Ralph Lauren offers the best men's chinos, high-quality and ultimately timeless. The heritage brand offers its Stretch Slim Fit Chinos in a trim silhouette that sits low on the waist. Despite being slim from top to bottom, the cotton and elastane blend makes them soft and lightweight instead of too compressed, the way other slim fits can feel. A bonus of the slim fit is how well they factor into a high-low outfit — sleek dressy pants paired with an oversized sweater is a simple way to create a balanced contrast.\n\nMany designs from Alex Mill are uniform and minimalistic, with nuances only shown in the details. Their unisex cropped chinos are standard at first glance, but their prominent pleats, neatly cropped hems, and \"X\" belt loops give them a subtle edge on the average pair of dress pants. These have a relaxed fit that allows for slight stretching, and each pair comes in unique color variations according to their natural dye process.\n\nYou can purchase logo and accolade licensing to this story here.\n\nDisclosure: Written and researched by the Insider Reviews team.

    "fullText": "Nicole Sperling and Brooks Barnes, reporting for The New York Times:\n\nAmazon paid Ms. Trump’s production company $40 million for the\nrights to “Melania,” about $26 million more than the next closest\nbidder, Disney. The fee includes a related docuseries that is\nscheduled to air later this year. The budget for “Melania” is\nunknown, but documentaries that follow a subject for a limited\namount of time usually cost less than $5 million to produce. The\n$35 million for marketing is 10 times what some other high-profile\ndocumentaries have received.\n\nAll of which has a lot of Hollywood questioning whether Amazon’s\npush is anything more than the company’s attempt to ingratiate\nitself with President Trump.\n\nThis is a good story, with multiple industry sources with experience making political documentaries, but the Times’s own subhead downplays Amazon’s spending on the film: “The tech giant is spending $35 million to promote its film about the first lady, far more than is typical for documentaries.” They’re spending $35 million now, to promote it, but they already paid $40 million for the rights to the film, $28 million of which is believed to have gone to Melania Trump herself. A $35 million total spend would be a lot compared to other high-profile documentaries, but it’s a $75 million total spend. This is not just a little fishy — it’s a veritable open air seafood market.\n\nTo grasp just how uncustomary Amazon’s marketing push for\n“Melania” is, consider how Magnolia Pictures handled “RBG,”\na portrait of Ruth Bader Ginsburg during her 25th year as a\nSupreme Court justice, in 2018.\n\nCNN Films produced “RBG” for around $1 million. The promotional\nbudget, including an awards campaign that helped it land two Oscar\nnominations, totaled about $3 million. The film debuted in 34\ntheaters and expanded into 432 locations over several weeks. It\nultimately collected $14 million, enough to rank as the year’s No.\n1 political documentary.\n\nOn Friday, “Melania” will also be released in 1,600 theaters\noverseas, where FilmNation, a New York company, is handling\ndistribution in more than 20 countries. International ticket sales\nare expected to be weak, according to box office analysts.\n\nDisplay Preferences",

    "title": "Here's what a potential SpaceX mega-merger could mean for Elon Musk's business empire",
    "description": "SpaceX is gearing up for a massive IPO this year, and multiple reports suggested the rocket giant is considering mergers with Tesla or xAI.",
    "fullText": "The \"Muskonomy\" might be about to get a lot more complicated.\n\nSpaceX is gearing up for a potential $1.5 trillion IPO this year, and multiple reports on Thursday night suggested the rocket company is considering blockbuster mergers with Tesla, Elon Musk's carmaker, or his AI startup, xAI.\n\nThe three companies have already been moving closer together in recent months. Tesla said on Wednesday that it had invested $2 billion in xAI, after SpaceX reportedly made a similar investment last year.\n\nThe electric carmaker also told investors it would evaluate \"potential AI collaborations\" with xAI, following its addition of the startup's Grok chatbot to its vehicles last July.\n\nIt wouldn't be the first time Musk has combined parts of his sprawling business empire. Last March, he announced that xAI had purchased X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter that Musk bought for $44 billion in 2022.\n\nMerging xAI with one of Tesla or SpaceX would mark a dramatic escalation of the so-called \"Muskonomy,\" however. Here's what it could mean for the future of Elon Musk's business empire.\n\nAt first glance, bringing social media site X, the controversial chatbot Grok, and the reusable rocket Starship under one roof seems like a strange mix. But merging SpaceX and xAI does fit with Musk's long-term vision for an AI-powered future.\n\nThe world's richest man has suggested that the logical conclusion of the AI infrastructure boom is to build data centres in the freezing vacuum of space, where they can access plentiful solar power and operate without the huge amounts of water needed to cool them on Earth.\n\nSpeaking at Davos last week, Musk suggested that space will become the \"lowest cost\" place to train AI, and said that SpaceX will launch solar-powered AI satellites in the next few years that will ultimately scale up to \"hundreds of terawatts\" of energy consumption a year.\n\nMusk has also said that SpaceX's Starship rocket and growing network of Starlink satellites could form the basis of a massive network of orbital AI compute.\n\nAccess to this infrastructure could give xAI an advantage over rivals OpenAI and Google, who are scrambling for computing power and exploring space-based data centers themselves as they look to build ever more powerful AI models.\n\nAnother consideration is funding. Training AI is notoriously expensive, with xAI reportedly burning through billions of dollars in cash and regularly taking on new funding. SpaceX, meanwhile, has seen revenue grow in recent years and is set to tap the public markets for as much as $50 billion.\n\nMerging SpaceX with Tesla, which has been a public company since 2010, would be more complicated — and the payoff less obvious.\n\nThe two companies already enjoy close links, having shared board members and executives in the past. And, in 2018, Musk used SpaceX for some out-of-this-world marketing by blasting his Tesla Roadster into space on a Falcon Heavy rocket.\n\nTheir current businesses, however, have less obvious areas of overlap.\n\nTesla is shifting from a carmaker to an AI and robotics company, with Musk saying on Wednesday that Tesla would scrap the Model X and S and use their production lines to build its Optimus robot.\n\nThe company also has a thriving energy storage business, and at Davos last week, Musk said that both Tesla and SpaceX were separately working to build up to \"a hundred gigawatts a year\" of solar power in the US.\n\nCombining the two could be a step toward Musk's more grandiose dreams of massively expanding humanity's energy production.\n\nMusk also reiterated on Wednesday that he believes Tesla needs to build a \"terafab\" to build advanced AI chips, and in an X post in November suggested that Tesla's terafab could produce chips for SpaceX's solar-powered AI satellites.\n\nOne throughline that connects all of Musk's enterprises is his obsession with settling Mars, which the billionaire has described as critical to humanity's long-term survival.\n\nSpaceX is gearing up to use Starship to launch uncrewed missions to Mars in the coming years, and the billionaire has previously said that these missions would carry Tesla's Optimus to the red planet.\n\nOne thing that's clear is that combining his various companies has been on Musk's mind for a while. Way back in 2020, he responded to a Twitter post suggesting he merge SpaceX, Tesla, and the Boring Company.",

    "description": "Reactions are already pouring in from prominent economists and business leaders about President Donald Trump nominating Kevin Warsh.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump has chosen Kevin Warsh, a former bank executive and central bank governor, to lead the Federal Reserve.\n\nWithin minutes of the nomination, reactions started pouring in from prominent economists and business leaders.\n\nHere are what some of the leading voices in economics and business are saying.\n\nThe renowned economist Mohamed El-Erian congratulated Warsh on his nomination to lead the Fed.\n\n\"Having observed and interacted with Kevin during his prior tenure as Fed Governor, in academia, and as a fellow member of the Group of Thirty (G-30), I believe he brings a strong mix of deep expertise, broad experience, and sharp communication skills,\" El-Erian wrote in a post on X.\n\n\"His commitment to reforming and modernizing the Fed bodes well for enhancing policy effectiveness and protecting the institution's political independence.\"\n\nEarlier in January, El-Erian wrote on X that the Department of Justice probe into Jerome Powell could undermine the \"credibility of a Fed whose public standing is already fragile.\"\n\nJason Furman, a Harvard economist and former top economist to President Barack Obama, wrote on X that \"Warsh is well above the bar on both substance and independence to be Chair of the Federal Reserve.\"\n\n\"The Senate should ask tough questions about his independence & President Trump should reduce the threat to it. Hopefully that will make it clear Warsh should be confirmed,\" he wrote.\n\n\"Warsh has a range of views that would not have led me to recommend a Democratic President nominate him as Federal Reserve Chair,\" Furman added. \"I would be thrilled if he ends up conducting himself over the next four years in a way that would make a President of any party want to reappoint him.\"\n\nJoseph Brusuelas, principal and chief economist for RSM US LLP, said Warsh meets the bar to lead the Fed, but he should be questioned on central bank independence and reform, as well as on reducing the Fed's balance sheet.\n\n\"Moreover, he should be challenged to how he would respond in a financial crisis given his public track record of focusing on inflation risk during a time of rising unemployment and deflation during the early portion of the Great Financial crisis,\" Brusuelas wrote on X.\n\n\"Warsh has a range of views and track record that presents significant concerns about how he would proceed during a financial and economic crisis. I would not have recommended him but he is qualified for the job,\" he added.\n\nRobin Brooks, senior fellow at Brookings, said in an X post that Warsh \"is a really good pick for Fed Chair and known as a hawk.\"\n\nHe did, however, note the muted market reaction in the minutes after the announcement.\n\n\"But markets are asking themselves what was promised to get the nod, which is why the Dollar - after its huge decline in recent days - isn't managing to rally on what should be good news,\" said Brooks, who was also a managing director and chief economist at the Institute of International Finance.\n\nPaul Krugman, a Nobel Prize-winning economist and research professor at the City University of New York's Graduate Center, criticized Warsh's nomination.\n\nHe wrote in a post on his Substack: \"As I write this, many media reports are describing Warsh as a monetary hawk. That's a category error. Warsh is a political animal. He calls for tight money and opposes any attempt to boost the economy when Democrats hold the White House.\"\n\nKrugman cited Warsh's track record as a member of the Federal Reserve Board, saying he had \"argued strenuously against the Fed's efforts to boost the economy.\"\n\n\"It's a humiliating day for the Federal Reserve, which has always prided itself on its professionalism and has been hugely respected around the world. But even the Fed can't insulate itself from the derangement sweeping America,\" he added.\n\nSonali Basak, the chief investment strategist for iCapital and a former Bloomberg anchor, wrote on X: \"Between Bessent & Warsh, you have two proteges of Stanley Druckenmiller in the most powerful finance posts in government.\"\n\nWarsh is a partner at billionaire Druckenmiller's Duquesne Family Office LLC.\n\nGeorge Osborne, the UK's former Chancellor of the Exchequer, praised Trump's decision to nominate Warsh as Fed chair.\n\n\"Kevin Warsh is an excellent choice as Chair of the Fed - smart, serious, experienced, knows the new economy as well as the old,\" said Osborne, who leads OpenAI for Countries, wrote in a post on X.\n\n\"I've been fortunate enough to know him for more than twenty years and this is the job he was put on earth to do. The world feels a little safer - and more prosperous - today,\" he added.\n\nHoward, the billionaire founder of $33 billion macro hedge fund Brevan Howard, called Warsh an \"outstanding choice for Fed Chair.\"\n\n\"I've known him for more than 20 years, and his judgment, integrity, and depth of experience will make him an exceptional leader of the Federal Reserve,\" Howard said in a statement sent to Business Insider.",

    "fullText": "Michael Carrick has not ruled out Manchester United adding to their squad before Monday's transfer deadline.\n\nFormer United head coach Ruben Amorim said last month he expected to bring someone in during the window.\n\nHowever, the club's refusal to divert the £65m they had been willing to spend on long-term target Antoine Semenyo – who opted to join Manchester City from Bournemouth – was a source of frustration for the Portuguese.\n\nUnited have been linked with a number of central midfield players, including former Wolves skipper Ruben Neves who now plays in Saudi Arabia for Al-Hilal.\n\nAfter Carrick confirmed left-sided utility man Patrick Dorgu would be out for \"a number of weeks\" through injury, there have been suggestions the club might look to cover the Denmark international's absence.\n\nInterim head coach Carrick was coy when asked specifically about the club's position as he spoke in a news conference to preview Sunday's Premier League encounter with Fulham.\n\nBut he did leave the door open for business being done.\n\n\"Never say never,\" Carrick said. \"A lot can happen and situations can be thrown up.\n\n\"Sometimes it is in our control, sometimes not. I am pretty calm. We have shown what we are capable of as a team.\"\n\nJoshua Zirkzee remains at the centre of interest as it remains to be seen if he returns to Italy, with Juventus considering whether to make a move for the former Bologna forward who cost United £36.5m 18 months ago.\n\nZirkzee has recovered from a minor injury and is available for the Fulham game.\n\n\"Josh has just been trying to work to get fit,\" said Carrick. \"It was great to have him training with the group the first time and I am just looking forward to working with him.\"\n\nCarrick accepts the issue of Bruno Fernandes' future is \"on the agenda a little bit\", with the United captain due to assess his plans at the end of the season.\n\nHowever, Carrick said that situation would be dealt with \"further down the line\".",

    "description": "An X post about rejecting a candidate over their \"olive oil\" interest went viral. Four recruiters shared their reactions with Business Insider.",
    "fullText": "Some people like reading or long walks. Others like olive oil.\n\nBut would you list olive oil as an interest on your résumé? That's the latest internet debate after a post about the interests section on résumés went viral on X.\n\nThe person, who said they were reviewing résumés for a banking role, wrote that applicants needed to be \"normal\" and \"well adjusted.\"\n\n\"I reviewed a resume that listed 'olive oil' as an interest. That is not an interest,\" they wrote. \"It's been hours and I cannot stop thinking about it. There will not be an interview.\"\n\nThe identity of the X user, @90daysliquidity, isn't clear, but they list \"Tech Analyst\" in their bio. They did not respond to a direct message from Business Insider.\n\nCannot stress how much of an advantage it is to be a normal, well adjusted, applicant for banking roles. \n\nI reviewed a resume that listed “olive oil” as an interest. That is not an interest. It’s been hours and I cannot stop thinking about it. There will not be an interview.\n\nThe post caused a stir online. Memes abound, both celebrating and scoffing at the supposed olive oil-enjoyer.\n\nAn employee at Elon Musk's xAI commented that they would hire a \"cracked finance professional\" who is interested in olive oil.\n\n\"If you have olive oil as an interest on your resume, we want to talk to you,\" the official Coinbase account posted.\n\nIs it really so bad to list \"olive oil\" — or any offbeat hobby — on your résumé? Business Insider asked five recruiters what they thought.\n\nPaula Mathias Fryer would want to see just one more word added.\n\nThe SLO Partners senior director from California has been a technical recruiter for 15 years. She would have preferred olive oil \"taster\" or \"grower,\" she told Business Insider.\n\n\"It would have explained it a bit more,\" she said. \"Just those two words is a bit odd.\"\n\nBrianne Sterling, a New York-based director at Selby Jennings who leads investment banking recruitment, also wants more information. Are they just eating olive oil all day long?\n\n\"Do you make your own olive oil?\" Sterling said. \"If someone made their own olive oil, I would find that really interesting, and I might want to speak to them.\"\n\nSterling is a fan of chocolate, but doesn't plan on putting it on her résumé anytime soon.\n\nHobbies offer a common interest between the applicant and the hirer, Sterling said. She listed some popular ones in investment banking: football, basketball, travel, and World War II history.\n\nIt poses a question: what makes a good résumé hobby?\n\nThe off-limits topics are more obvious: politics, religion, anything you wouldn't talk about at the dinner table. Picking the best hobby, on the other hand, depends on the recruiter.\n\nMargaret Buj, a London-based principal recruiter at Mixmax, wants candidates to be interesting. Olive oil was \"weird\" to her — but better than the answers that are \"cliché and vague.\"\n\n\"Traveling, socializing, reading,\" Buj said. \"Who cares? We all do that.\"\n\nSpace on a one-page résumé is a precious resource. Hobbies don't display relevant work experience, and they don't directly show what your contribution to the team would be. Is it even worth listing them?\n\nMathias-Fryer used to vote no. She saw hobbies as \"less professional,\" an unnecessary waste of space. Then came AI, which has upended recruitment and filled hiring managers' inboxes with identical, ChatGPT-generated CVs.\n\nApplicants now need to do \"whatever they can do to stand out,\" she said. \"If that's a hobby, so be it.\"\n\nMatt Stevenson disagrees. The New York-based managing director of executive search agency 33eleven loves to see a quirky hobby. It's another thing to connect about, he said. But, on the candidate side, Stevenson thought that hobbies were too risky.\n\n\"You don't know who is going to be reviewing that résumé, what their hobbies are, and what their personality is like,\" he said.\n\nAs for that X user, endlessly thinking about the olive oil-loving applicant?\n\n\"I would pick up the phone and call the guy,\" he said. \"Scratch that itch.\"",

    "description": "Dan Priest, PwC's chief AI officer, told Business Insider that companies should focus on quality not quantity when it comes to AI agents.",
    "fullText": "The AI race can sometimes feel like a numbers game.\n\nEarlier this month, Bob Sternfels, the CEO of McKinsey & Company, made a surprising announcement. The firm, he said, had a workforce of over 60,000 people — 40,000 human employees and 25,000 AI agents.\n\nFor Sternfels, it was an example of McKinsey's all-in approach to AI. Others in the industry, however, say the eye-popping number actually says little about the company's successful adoption of artificial intelligence.\n\nDan Priest, the chief AI officer at PwC, told Business Insider that evaluating a firm's AI use by the number of agents it has is not the best metric.\n\n\"There was this emerging bragging right around the number of agents I had or I have in production,\" he said. \"I think that's probably the wrong measure.\"\n\nThe value of AI deployment is better measured by the quality — not the quantity — of agents, he said.\n\nHe said one way to do that is to look at the number of agents that are authorities on a given task, which will encourage humans to use them, Priest said. The other is to evaluate the number of humans using those agents to execute tasks to achieve a prioritized outcome for a company. An example could be a better customer experience by transforming a call center.\n\nOver the past two years, agents have come to dominate how companies talk about AI adoption. Priest said that focus on agents is the right approach. \"Agents are at a place now where they're the best way to unlock value from AI,\" he said.\n\nHumans still drive the workforce, however, and a better way to measure an agent's value is by how effectively people use them — not just by how much work the agents have the potential to automate.\n\nAt PwC, about 82% of its employees were actively using the firm's AI tools. Priest said that AI agents are embedded across teams at PwC, and the firm tracks how agents interact, how accurately they complete tasks, whether they are making processes faster, higher quality, or higher performing. Humans have a role in reviewing agents' output and providing feedback.\n\n\"The human is still accountable,\" he said. \"The humans are the ones who get certified. The humans are the ones who get licensed. The humans are the ones who get empowered.\"\n\nPriest said that PwC and its clients first took a bottom-up approach to AI adoption. Many business leaders, he said, tried to \"crowdsource\" approaches to adoption from employees because they themselves didn't have the answers.\n\nThat led to a \"fairly disappointing\" return on investment, he said.\n\nPriest said a shift to a \"top-down\" approach has been more effective, allowing them to focus on fewer agents with a deeper mastery of a smaller set of tasks.\n\n\"That agent, I've given them permission to access certain data sets,\" he said. \"I've given them permission to perform certain tasks. I've given them permission to produce certain outcomes. Those permissions are monitored, they expire, they're managed.\"",

    "description": "Michael Knox runs a restaurant near Minneapolis. He said employees are afraid to come in, and even his regular customers have been absent.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Michael Knox, co-owner of Toma Mojo Grill near Minneapolis. This story has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI run a fast casual chicken restaurant in Richfield, Minnesota, a suburb just south of Minneapolis.\n\nWith ICE agents in the area, I don't know when — or if — staff will be able to come to work. We all have pretty set schedules, and we're tight-knit. There are only six of us operating this place, seven days a week. And I have concerns: Are my employees going to get stopped on their way to work? Are they going to be hassled or detained? Are they going to come back?\n\nIt's a day-by-day thing. Over the past couple of weeks, we've adjusted our hours, opening later and closing earlier. I've been picking up everyone's shifts, but I can't physically work 16 hours a day, seven days a week. We had to close last week so that I could have a day off. I had a doctor's appointment that I couldn't miss.\n\nSome of my employees don't feel comfortable leaving their houses. If they tell me they can't come to the restaurant, my policy, of course, is \"no questions asked.\" I get it. But I'm not a wealthy businessman. If we're not serving guests our food, there's no money coming in, and we can't pay people. I wish that we were at a place where we could offer better PTO benefits, but we're not. That's been hard.\n\nWe're just trying to keep our people safe and our employees comfortable. We have a big bay window at the front of the restaurant where the full kitchen is visible. I'm going to make some modifications to the space that will make it harder to see inside. We don't know who's looking in now, or what their purpose is. We put up cameras that we didn't have before — we need to have a record of whatever happens here.\n\nI worry that ICE agents will come to my business to abduct my staff. I also worry that they're going to come enjoy hospitality, and that's going to get out to the public. I can only do what I think is good for me, my staff, and the restaurant. ICE agents are bad for business, no matter which way they come.\n\nLast week, my sales were down about 40% year over year. There are fewer delivery drivers and gig workers, so our takeout food is sitting longer before pickup. Our walk-in business is suffering too: After the sun goes down, we're seeing almost a noticeable drop in sales. That didn't previously happen. Now I have regulars who I haven't seen in weeks.\n\nI went to the strike with my friends and family last week to voice our dissatisfaction with the situation. My employees and I thought it was important to close that day too. Shutting down a restaurant on a Friday in January is devastating. It's the busy day, the day that pays for the rest of the week. That's a big sacrifice — but I know it's important.\n\nWhat's happening in Minneapolis should horrify every American. There's a very real, pervasive fear about what's going to happen next. That's bad for business. That's bad for life. And I'm worried that there's going to be more loss of life.\n\nSmall business owners are brave people. It takes a lot of guts to put everything on the line do something you really want to do, to present a product or service that you think is good enough to charge money for. They don't tend to be the quiet type. I'm not surprised they're speaking up.",

    "title": "Major private student-loan companies are 'excited' about Trump's repayment overhaul",
    "description": "Leaders at Navient and Sallie Mae said that Trump's sweeping student-loan repayment changes will be a boon to their private lending business.",
    "fullText": "Private student-loan companies are gearing up for a big year ahead.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's administration is preparing to roll out its sweeping student-loan repayment changes beginning in July. Those changes include new repayment plans and caps on federal borrowing for advanced degrees.\n\nSome companies see those changes as an opportunity for the private lending industry. During an earnings call last week, Jonathan Witter, the CEO of lender Sallie Mae, said that the company is \"excited about the opportunity created by the recent federal student lending reforms.\"\n\n\"These changes should reduce the likelihood of students and families taking on unsustainable levels of student debt,\" Witter said. \"These reforms also create the opportunity for us to help more students and families.\"\n\nTrump's \"big beautiful\" spending legislation eliminates the Grad PLUS program, which allowed graduate students to borrow up to the full cost of attendance for their programs. The legislation also imposes new borrowing caps for graduate and professional students: $20,500 for graduate students and $50,000 for professionals, such as those in medical or law school.\n\nWitter said the company expects those changes to bring in an estimated $5 billion in annual loan originations. Navient's CEO, David Yowan, expressed similar sentiment during the company's earnings call this month. He said that the changes to Grad PLUS are an \"opportunity\" for the company to expand, saying that \"there's a lot of room for growth\" this year.\n\nPrivate lenders have been anticipating these repayment changes for months. Yowan said during an August 2025 earnings call that eliminating the Grad PLUS program is \"a substantial and significant expansion of opportunities that we have with graduate students.\" SoFi's CEO Anthony Noto said at the time that the repayment changes could lead to \"further opportunities for in school lending and student loan refinance.\"\n\nWhile private lenders anticipate boosts to their businesses from Trump's repayment overhaul, some critics and borrowers are concerned. Borrowers could choose to forgo their programs entirely due to more limited federal financing, and if they turn to private lenders, they would lose out on federal debt relief and forgiveness.\n\nSara Partridge, associate director for higher education policy at the left-leaning think tank Center for American Progress, previously told Business Insider that private student loans could also have higher interest rates than federal loans, leaving borrowers with more unaffordable debt.\n\n\"Private student loans often require a cosigner, so some students may not qualify, and they may have no options to fully finance and attend graduate school. So there is a possibility that for some students, this will be a barrier to accessing graduate school,\" Partridge said.\n\nStill, the Trump administration said the reforms are intended to curb excessive borrowing and increase accountability in the federal system.\n\n\"We are building a future where higher education works for everyone, where students are empowered to succeed, where taxpayers can trust that their investments will be used wisely, and where institutions are held accountable for delivering results,\" Undersecretary of Education Nicholas Kent said in a January statement.",

    "title": "Snowmobiles, skis, and laser tag: How NATO soldiers train for Arctic assaults",
    "description": "Business Insider traveled north of the Arctic Circle to watch Finland's Jaeger Brigade train NATO forces on winter warfare and cold-weather survival.",
    "fullText": "SODANKYLÄ, Finland — Two soldiers moved cautiously through the snow-covered forest, their camouflage blending into the trees as their skis glided silently over the ground.\n\nSpotting an unaware enemy, they knelt and lined up a shot. Rifle fire erupted through the woods, the metallic smell of spent casings hanging in the cold air.\n\nA firefight kicked off, and a battle was underway.\n\nThe encounter took place during a recent winter combat exercise involving roughly 20 NATO troops, beginning with an assault on skis and snowmobiles before shifting into a simulated firefight using blanks and lasers instead of live ammo. The drill was part of a monthlong course led by Finland's Jaeger Brigade that trains allied forces in Arctic warfare and cold-weather survival.\n\nBusiness Insider observed the battle's start at a training site 75 miles north of the Arctic Circle in Finland's snow-blanketed Lapland region. It pitted a small platoon of NATO soldiers against an \"enemy\" force that was three times larger and composed of conscripts from the Jaeger Brigade.\n\nAs the strategic Arctic region becomes increasingly important to both NATO and its adversaries, exercises like this are designed to sharpen allied troops' abilities to fight on frozen battlefields. The environment is harsh and unforgiving, with sub-zero temperatures routine. And while fighting is simulated, it reflects real-world threats.\n\nMaj. Mikael Aikio, the Jaeger Brigade's Arctic section leader overseeing the course, told Business Insider that using lasers makes the training feel more realistic. \"At least there is some kind of fear of getting hit,\" he said.\n\nArctic security has become a focal point for NATO in recent years as Russia and China grow more active in the region, seeking to project power, establish new trade routes, and expand their access to natural resources.\n\nNATO leadership, concerned by certain Russian and Chinese behavior, has stressed the need for greater investment in collective Arctic defense to prevent Moscow and Beijing from gaining more military and economic influence in this strategic area.\n\nFinland — roughly a third of which sits above the Arctic Circle and has a long history of cold-weather combat — is well positioned to train Western forces in Arctic warfare and has led annual courses for more than a decade. That training has taken on new urgency for NATO.\n\nThe training Business Insider observed this week is ongoing, with participants hailing from Finland, the US, the UK, France, Italy, and Canada. The idea is that they can take what they learn in Lapland and use it to instruct or advise their units back home.\n\nThe course is divided into three phases over four weeks, starting with cold-weather survival and winter movement training, then teaching maneuvers such as attacking on skis and building snow foxholes, and ending with low-mountain activity above the tree line.\n\nThe second phase includes the combat exercise Business Insider had the opportunity to observe. The NATO platoon, known as the Blue force, began by crossing several kilometers of forest on snowmobiles before dismounting and skiing to the top of a small hill. Their objective was to effectively assault and capture territory defended by the Red force, the Finnish conscripts.\n\nManeuver in these environments used to be limited to skis, still a crucial tool for soldiers needing to traverse deep snow that otherwise would make ground assaults impossible. Modern snowmobiles lighten the load, allowing soldiers to travel farther faster with less overall effort, preserving energy for the fight.\n\n\"You can't get anywhere,\" said Aikio, the Jaeger Brigade major, said of the snow's effect on traditional assault elements. The Arctic demands some unique warfighting skills that aren't really used anywhere else.\n\nLearning to ski in these conditions can be challenging for soldiers, especially if they have no prior experience. They're also weighed down by cumbersome gear, such as packs, helmets, vests, and guns, making it more difficult.\n\n\"It's hard to move with the skis,\" said Finnish Lt. Laura Lähdekorpi, one of the soldiers in the winter warfare course. She told Business Insider that recreational downhill skiing has helped her to improve balance.\n\nCanadian Cpt. Vincent Lemelin, another soldier in the course, said he grew up skiing; however, the ones he's been using in Finland — long and designed to act as snowshoes — are very different from what he's used to.\n\n\"The fact that the skis are this long requires some adaptation, but it does give an advantage to already have the skills,\" Lemelin said.\n\n\"In this operating condition, even a good skier, at some point, especially at night, will start struggling because you're getting tired,\" he said. \"When you get tired, you're also less confident.\"\n\nThe assault began as daylight faded away. The Blue force used drones to collect targeting data, which it relayed to a nearby control van that then simulated artillery strikes against the Red force. Then the NATO troops advanced toward the Finns.\n\nSoldiers carried rifles loaded with blanks and equipped with transmitters that fire laser tracks when they pull the triggers. They wore vests and helmet straps able to detect any incoming laser signals.\n\nIf a shot found its mark, the vest on the opposing soldier announced to them that they had been \"killed\" or \"wounded,\" depending on where on the body they got hit by the laser. Then they took off their helmets to signal that they were out.\n\nThough the system resembles laser tag, troops take it seriously. It reflects the consequences of armed conflict, forcing soldiers to respond to simulated injuries and sudden losses, much like they would in real combat.\n\n\"If we fight without this, everyone can just walk straight into the woods,\" Lähdekorpi said. There'd be no way to tell if someone was hit or killed. This tech pushes soldiers to hide, move discreetly, and communicate more effectively.\n\nThe laser system isn't a perfect match for combat, Aikio acknowledged. \"If you have snow, or branches, or anything that's blocking the laser, it will not work. And that's not realistic, but it's much better than nothing.\"\n\nFor some NATO soldiers who come to these training exercises, it might be the first time they've operated in the harsh Arctic environment. Rising tensions between the West and Russia have fueled concerns that a future war between the two could unfold across frozen battlefields, making it critical that troops from Italy to the US are prepared for that possibility. A fight against China, another Arctic rival, could likewise involve Arctic activity.\n\nFinland shares an 800-mile-long border with Russia, is one of NATO's front-line countries, and has long been training for the possibility of renewed conflict in the Arctic, even before it joined the alliance in 2023. The Finns have fought the Russians before. It's been decades since the last round of hostilities, though.\n\n\"Now we are in NATO,\" Aikio said. \"We want to support our allies so that they can also fight and work here in our conditions — in our terrain.\"",

    "description": "Uber is teaming up with Waabi, an autonomous trucking outfit led by an Uber alum, to deploy robotaxis. Business Insider spoke with Waabi COO Lior Ron.",
    "fullText": "Uber has a new plan to get 25,000 robotaxis on the road — and it will come with the aid of some Uber alums and an autonomous trucking company.\n\nOn Wednesday, the ride-hailing giant announced a partnership with Waabi, a Canadian self-driving trucking startup founded by Raquel Urtasun. The partnership will include a $250 million investment from Uber, dependent on a set of milestones Waabi will have to achieve. The companies did not disclose what those were.\n\nThere are a few familiar faces here. Urtasun was the chief scientist at Uber's self-driving car division, Advanced Technologies Group. That division was sold in 2020 to Aurora Innovation, another autonomous trucking company and Waabi's competitor.\n\nWaabi's chief operating officer, Lior Ron, is also an Uber alum who founded and led the ride-hailing company's trucking business, Uber Freight.\n\n\"Uber has always been great in building marketplaces, in matching supply and demand, and in pricing,\" Ron told Business Insider. \"That's what created Uber, that what's created Uber Eats, and that's what I created with Uber Freight.\"\n\nAlphabet's Waymo and Amazon's Zoox are already on the ground providing unsupervised rides. Even in its core business, that is, autonomous trucking, Waabi has yet to deploy a fully driverless truck without safety drivers on commercial routes.\n\nThe startup didn't disclose a timeline or announce a partnership with an automaker that can deliver that many cars.\n\nHowever, Ron dismissed the first-mover advantage narrative.\n\n\"I think it's really about: Can the system scale? Can the system be mass-deployed?\" he said. \"It's not about getting the first driver out of the car or truck. It's not about the first lane. It's not about the first neighborhood.\"\n\nTrucking and ride-hailing are two different beasts. One has set routes and long stretches of highway driving; the other sees dense neighborhoods and unpredictable pedestrians.\n\nRon told Business Insider that Waabi has been building a generalizable AI \"brain\" that can be transferred to different vehicle platforms since \"day one.\"\n\n\"Nothing needs to be rebuilt,\" Ron said.\n\nIn addition, Ron said Waabi has built a sophisticated simulator that allows the AI driver to learn from an infinite number of scenarios that can’t easily be replicated in the real world.\n\nThe simulation allows for \"mixed reality testing\": An AI driver steering a truck or car is deployed on a closed course but responds to simulated events like a traffic jam or a lane-changing car that isn't really there.\n\nVideo from Waabi shows how a truck driving on a closed-course environment can slow down, reacting to a virtual traffic jam.\n\n\"Now we can test anything you can imagine — every permutation of traffic jam under the sun, every millions of different scenarios of construction zone,\" Ron said. \"A motorbike cutting you off — you can never do that because you'll be endangering the tester.\"",

    "fullText": "LOS ANGELES, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Tesla plans to more than double capital spending to a record high of more than $20 billion this year - but little of it will go to its traditional business ​of selling electric vehicles to human drivers.\n\nThe company, which last year lost its global EV sales crown to China's BYD, ‌is instead shifting investment to yet-unproven business lines such as fully autonomous vehicles and humanoid robots, based on executive comments on Wednesday's earnings call.\n\nHighlighting the change, CEO Elon ‌Musk said Tesla would end production of its Model X SUV and Model S sedans and instead use the space in its California factory to make its Optimus robots.\n\nSeparately in a post on his social media site X, Musk said the robots will be built in Tesla's Texas Gigafactory at an even higher volume. \"This is going to be a very big capex year,\" he said. \"We're making big investments for an epic future.\"\n\nMost ⁠of the record investment will be spent on ‌production lines for the Cybercab, a fully autonomous vehicle without a steering wheel and pedals, the long-promised Tesla semi-truck, Optimus robots and plants for battery and lithium production, Chief Financial Officer Vaibhav Taneja said.\n\nTesla is still ‍reliant on human-driven EVs for most of its sales, but its valuation far exceeds any other automaker, putting it \n\nIt joins Facebook-parent Meta Platforms, Microsoft and Alphabet in planning sharp increases in capital spending this year, as those ‌companies invest heavily in hardware and data centers to support AI model training and customer demand.\n\nScott Acheychek, chief operating officer of REX Financial, which manages ETFs with exposure to Tesla stock, argued that Tesla's car business was no longer the main focus. \"The bigger story,\" he said, \"is the business model transition now underway\" as Tesla focuses on autonomous driving.\n\nTesla shares were down 1% in early trading on Thursday.\n\nAndrew Rocco, stock strategist at Zacks Investment Research, said he viewed the $20 billion as \"necessary spending.\"\n\n\"If Optimus is going to be a best-selling product, the AI ⁠must be trained as well as possible,\" he said, adding the planned spending ​gives him confidence that Musk's \"sometimes loose timelines will actually be honored.\"",

    "description": "In a hearing, a judge advised YouTuber Jimmy Donaldson and Virtual Dining Concepts to settle their legal dispute over MrBeast Burger.",
    "fullText": "A judge urged MrBeast and his burger business partner to settle their legal battle to avoid airing \"dirty laundry\" — but paved the way for the case to go to trial.\n\nAt a hearing on Thursday, New York County Supreme Court Judge Jennifer Schecter appeared skeptical about the damages sustained by either side, both of which are suing the other. Despite that, she ruled that both cases could proceed.\n\nVDC said it looked \"forward to having our day in court.\" MrBeast's reps declined to comment.\n\nYouTube's top star, MrBeast (real name Jimmy Donaldson), launched MrBeast Burger, a largely delivery-only venture selling burgers and fried chicken sandwiches, with Virtual Dining Concepts in 2020. Donaldson hoped it would become the cornerstone of a food empire, but the partnership was plagued by tensions over undercooked orders and Donaldson's demands for more control of the business.\n\nIn July 2023, Donaldson's company sued VDC, portraying the YouTuber as a victim seeking to escape an unfair contract that had tarnished his reputation as a philanthropic, family-friendly entertainer. VDC fired back with its own lawsuit, saying Donaldson had walked away from a promising deal and failed to meet various contractual obligations, including appearances and promos.\n\nA big issue for the judge was the level of damages claimed by both sides. She said the evidence presented by MrBeast about bad Yelp reviews over MrBeast Burger orders seemed \"very compelling.\" But she said she was \"very skeptical\" that they \"would materially and irreparably harm the MrBeast brand under the circumstances.\"\n\nThe judge took special interest in MrBeast's argument that VDC owes him royalties over burger sales.\n\nVDC says MrBeast's camp instructed the company to reinvest his royalty share back into the business. MrBeast's side says it's entitled to royalties now that the partnership has fallen apart.\n\nThe judge urged the parties to think about seeking a business solution rather than a legal one, given the cost of fighting the case in court.\n\n\"If they can't take each other anymore, they should be thinking about a buyout, and it may be costly, but at the end of the day, maybe that's what these parties both should want,\" she said.\n\nThe judge also admitted some fascination with the case involving the world's biggest YouTuber and his ill-fated business venture.\n\nDuring the hour-and-a-half hearing, MrBeast's lawyer, Steven Marenberg, alleged that the burger complaints harmed the YouTuber's reputation.\n\nHe said the \"systemic, deep\" dissatisfaction with MrBeast Burger could \"impact, irreparably,\" the YouTuber's brand.\n\nShawn Rabin, VDC's lawyer, countered by claiming that MrBeast wanted to lower the value of the business so he could \"buy it on the cheap\" and take control of it.",

    "fullText": "Most Super Bowl advertisers stick to a familiar formula: inoffensive humor and A-list celebrities. Hims & Hers is breaking from the playbook.\n\nTitled \"Rich People Live Longer,\" the digital health company's 2026 big game spot takes aim at a divide in access to quality healthcare between wealthy Americans and everyone else.\n\nOne scene features a space-suited cowboy over the TV news-style chyron \"World's richest man in orbit again.\" The scene is reminiscent of tech billionaire Jeff Bezos emerging from a capsule after completing Blue Origin's first passenger spaceflight in 2021.\n\nAnother shows a shirtless, muscular man strapped to an oxygen mask while sprinting on an exercise bike, alongside text reading \"spends millions\" and \"cheats death\" — perhaps a reference to biohacker Bryan Johnson, who has been known to test oxygen therapy as part of his expensive, public quest against aging.\n\nDan Kenger, the chief design officer at Hims & Hers, told Business Insider that the figures in the ad \"aren't specific individuals,\" and instead \"symbols of an intimidating, members-only healthcare culture.\" Kenger said Hims & Hers is aiming for the ad to be a provocative conversation starter about health inequity.\n\n\"We don't shy away from uncomfortable truths, and we fully expect this will ruffle some feathers,\" Kenger said. \"But if our message makes the industry uncomfortable, it's because we're exposing an outdated system that benefits the very few at the expense of everyone else.\"\n\nHims & Hers is no stranger to advertising controversy. Its \"Sick of the System\" Super Bowl ad last year drew backlash from senators and lobbyists for promoting non-FDA-approved compounded weight-loss drugs in a spot that lacked the sort of safety information typically disclosed by pharmaceutical companies. At the time, Hims & Hers said it adhered to advertising regulations and aimed to raise awareness of the obesity health crisis by showcasing the difficulties of accessing affordable weight-loss treatments.\n\nFor this year's campaign, Hims & Hers also plans to partner with podcast hosts and influencers to produce content across Meta, YouTube, TikTok, and other platforms. It also has commercials planned throughout the Olympics, which begin next month.\n\nThis year's Super Bowl takes place on Sunday, Feb. 8.",

    "description": "How Amazon's decision translates to your own workplace.",
    "fullText": "16,000 jobs down. How many more to go?\n\nThe sequel to Amazon's mass layoffs last fall came yesterday with another round of deep job cuts. I'd love to tell you it's an isolated incident, but it feels representative of a broader shift across tech and corporate America.\n\nAI is ushering in a new era for workplaces, and companies are adjusting accordingly. As the ones closest to the tech (and spending the most on it), Big Tech would be the first to evolve. Make no mistake: Where Big Tech goes, the rest of the business world will likely follow.\n\nSo what can we glean from Amazon's layoffs? Fortunately, my colleagues Eugene Kim and Ashley Stewart are crushing it with scoops. Their stories provide context about Amazon's decision and how that translates to your own workplace.\n\nNo one is safe: Internal Slack messages Ashley viewed show how many teams were bitten by the layoff bug. That includes businesses within AWS (its AI cloud service and cloud data warehouse service) and Amazon's retail business.\n\nOne Amazon worker used an AI tool to flag roles on the chopping block. That list is even broader, although it may contain inaccuracies since it's AI-generated. Another noticeable trend is how software engineers got hit particularly hard, as has been the case in tech recently.\n\nOwn it: After a not-so-hot start, Amazon has coordinated its post-layoffs communications. And there's one word that keeps cropping up: ownership.\n\nPrasad Kalyanaraman, VP of AWS Infrastructure, and Colleen Aubrey, SVP of Applied AI Solutions, both described \"doubling down on a culture of ownership\" in memos Ashley viewed. That sentiment, coupled with the changes Eugene reported on in performance reviews, signals that the further away you are from doing the actual work, the more at risk you are.\n\nAI can be a friend as much as a foe: Artificial intelligence often takes a lot of blame for why jobs are getting swallowed up. A memo from AWS VP Greg Pearson that Eugene viewed paints a different picture.\n\nHe urged workers to \"keep finding ways to use technology to simplify our work.\" It's something I heard a lot of last week when chatting with execs: \"AI won't take your job, but the person willing to use it will.\"\n\nMake change, don't manage it: I'm not a tech career coach (I'll leave that advice to this guy), but the layoffs, coupled with CEO Andy Jassy's ongoing war against bureaucracy, indicate a desire to get more people rolling up their sleeves.\n\nIt's reminiscent of a recent convo I had with Cisco president and chief product officer Jeetu Patel. He stressed the importance of figuring out the change you want to make and working toward it, rather than focusing on a job title.\n\n\"If in the pursuit of that change, you have to go out and reluctantly manage some people, then go ahead and do that,\" Patel told me. \"But management, in and of itself, is not a full-time job.\"",

    "description": "\"You lose people, employees.\"",
    "fullText": "The second week of January brought hope of a snowstorm for Santa Fe, New Mexico, businesses.\n\nSki resorts and winter sports shops were struggling because of high temperatures and a lack of snow, KOAT reported.\n\nBluebird Mountain Sports assistant manager Wanonce Rakestraw said: \"Usually, our season extends out to the first week of April. Past seasons used to be second week of April. But now, if it keeps going the way it is, we're looking last week of March, if not mid of March.\"\n\nThe warmer weather highlights a worldwide trend in which temperatures have drastically risen because of humans' burning of fossil fuels such as coal and gas. In the United States and elsewhere, this change varies by region, but winter temperatures in the continental U.S. have climbed 3 degrees since the preindustrial era, according to The Climate Reality Project.\n\nIn the Southwest, that means drier winters that increase drought risks. In addition to the impact on businesses and economies, this \"season creep\" is stressing agriculture and ecosystems.\n\nFarmers rely on snowmelt to irrigate crops in spring, while plants and animals have evolved to rely on seasonal cues for survival instincts that include reproduction. People similarly have built their lives around the rhythms of Earth.\n\n\"It's been really slow,\" Rakestraw told KOAT. \"When places lose business, you lose people, employees. You close early.\"\n\nSki Santa Fe general manager Ben Abruzzo said his business was using snowmaking machines to remain open. Others have not been so lucky. In France, hundreds of ski resorts shut their doors, and some in the western U.S. couldn't open as usual because of a lack of snow. Excessive snowfall in the Northeast and Midwest underscored the variability.\n\nWarmer weather can also mean more rain, which may create flooding issues.\n\nWhile some ski resorts may be able to supplement low snowfall, they cannot stay afloat without more of the white stuff. Adapting to new weather patterns should be one priority, while investing in infrastructure and planning upgrades should be another.\n\nDo you think America could ever get all of its power from clean energy?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nThe rise in temperatures at the root of the problem may only be mitigated by the transition to solar, wind, and other forms of renewable energy, which do not produce pollution that traps heat in the atmosphere.\n\nYou can make a change — and even save yourself a ton of money — by installing solar panels, replacing your gas-powered vehicle with an electric one, and changing how you update your wardrobe.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": "A former marketing manager explains why leaving corporate life to freelance after having kids led to burnout and mental health struggles.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Katie Bullon of activ Marketing Franchise. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nBefore I got pregnant with my firstborn, I was working in the corporate world as a marketing manager. It was an intense job that I absolutely loved, both as a single person and then as a newly married one. I got to travel the world, quickly advance in my career, and diversify my skill set, but I could only do the job because I didn't yet have kids.\n\nI knew once I started a family, I wouldn't want to continue working in the corporate world full time. I never wanted to be in a position where I had to choose between taking care of my kids and doing my job, so I initially decided to go back to my role part time, thinking that would be a happy medium.\n\nBut after keeping in touch day, a reintroduction to work after maternity leave, when my son was 7 months old, it became clear I couldn't even manage the part time role. To do the job well, to the high standard I expected of myself, I had to give it my everything.\n\nI remember finishing the keeping in touch day, crying in my boss's office, telling her I just couldn't come back. The day had been a reminder of my old life — the life of a young, free, travelling corporate marketer. It was a life I knew I couldn't maintain with a baby in tow, and I mourned the end of my life as a corporate professional.\n\nI quit my job and, after months of deliberation and dreaming, decided to go freelance — I was really excited. Surely, I thought, I would strike a healthy balance of parenting and working if I worked for myself.\n\nThe plan would be to devote all my attention to my son when he was awake, and pull out my laptop to work while he slept.\n\nBut the reality of being self-employed as a new mom was not what I had imagined.\n\nI was running on empty all the time, exhausted from sleepless nights. I didn't know what I was doing with parenting, as I had never done it before, and often felt I was doing it all wrong. I adored my son even more than I had imagined I would, and not being with him while I worked constantly pulled at my heartstrings.\n\nIt was from this state that I then tried to work, attempting to be at clients' full-time disposal. Even though I knew about marketing, I didn't fully take into account the amount of work or the number of non-billable hours I'd be working as a self-employed individual. As opposed to working for a corporate company, I was the sole person responsible for every aspect of the business. It was all on me.\n\nNot keen on putting my son in a day care to save us a bit of money, I tried to build the business with him around most of the time, save for a few hours a week when my mom or sister would have him.\n\nI was on a hamster wheel from the moment I woke up, becoming more and more exhausted as I tried to work as if I didn't have a child, and parent as if I didn't have a job.\n\nThe standards I set for myself as a mother and business owner were unachievable, and I could feel myself starting to burn out as I attempted to do it all.\n\nOnly 20 months after my first son was born, I gave birth to my second son, and I continued trying to balance my own business with parenting, this time with a toddler and newborn in tow.\n\nMy second didn't ever take a bottle, so I frequently sat with him breastfeeding on one side with my laptop set up on the other. I was absolutely determined to do it all, and do it all perfectly.\n\nI suppose part of me wanted to prove people wrong, to show them that I could be a completely present mother while also being an incredibly successful self-starter.\n\nMy mental health crashed. My physical health deteriorated. My relationship with my husband was rocky. I was exhausted all the time and felt like I had hit rock bottom.\n\nIt wasn't what I had expected freelancing to be like, and it most certainly wasn't what I wanted motherhood to be like.\n\nWhile self-employment might seem like the \"easier than corporate path\" for new mothers, it wasn't — not for me.\n\nSomething had to change, so I went back to the drawing board, considering what I could do differently, and joined a marketing franchise. It allowed me to continue doing what I loved, marketing, but I had the back office and a team of people behind me to carry out all the work that had overwhelmed me when I was working on my own.\n\nIf I could go back in time and give myself advice, I would say: You can't do it all, nor should you.\n\nAs a mom, I can't put myself last. I must build my life in a way that prioritizes me; otherwise, I'll burn out repeatedly, which is detrimental to ume, my family, and my work.",

    "description": "I used points to upgrade to United Polaris business class on an eight-hour flight. From the lounge access to the amenities, the upgrade was worth it.",
    "fullText": "I never thought I'd prefer sleeping 35,000 feet in the sky to my own bed, but my recent trip in United's business class proved me wrong.\n\nI like to take red-eye flights when I'm traveling to a destination in a different time zone because it helps me keep my sleep schedule on track. However, if I don't get proper rest on these flights, I land feeling completely groggy and end up missing out on my first day of travel.\n\nSo, on a recent overnight flight from New Jersey to Morocco, I decided to upgrade to United Polaris business class in hopes of getting a good night's sleep. I originally had a regular economy ticket and, as a frequent flyer, used my PlusPoints to get the upgrade at no additional charge.\n\nBetween the Saks Fifth Avenue blanket and a toiletry kit filled with skincare products, the experience did not disappoint.\n\nBecause I was flying business class on an eligible long-haul international flight, I had access to United's Polaris lounge.\n\nI typically like to be in and out of the airport as quickly as possible, but this time, I arrived a few hours early just to enjoy the perks.\n\nAs I walked in, I thought the space itself was stunning. It had a sleek, modern design with a marble check-in area and an overall elevated, luxury feel.\n\nThe lounge featured an extensive hot and cold buffet, but I opted to visit the full-service dining room instead.\n\nI ordered the tagliatelle pasta, which was perfectly al dente, followed by a warm sticky toffee cake that practically melted in my mouth.\n\nAfter my meal, I stopped by the bar to enjoy one of the signature cocktails before boarding.\n\nAfter boarding, I made my way to my seat, which was set up in a private pod. I immediately noticed how spacious the layout was and how it provided a real sense of privacy.\n\nWaiting at my seat was Saks Fifth Avenue bedding, including a plush pillow, a duvet, and a cooling-gel pillow. I also requested a mattress pad and a pair of slippers for extra comfort.\n\nOn my seat, I also found a complimentary toiletry bag with some travel essentials.\n\nInside was everything I needed for a long-haul flight — an eye mask, cozy socks, tissues, a dental kit with a toothbrush and toothpaste, earplugs, and a pen.\n\nIt was also stocked with Perricone MD skincare products, including a cleansing wipe, eye gel, hand cream, lip balm, and face mist.\n\nAll of it was super helpful for staying refreshed throughout the flight.\n\nAt this point, I was so comfortable I could've fallen asleep at any second, but I had to stay awake for the food.\n\nBefore the meal service began, the flight attendants came around with warm towels, which was a thoughtful, elevated touch. They even pulled out my tray table and placed a cloth napkin down.\n\nFor dinner, I was served a welcome snack, an appetizer (salad, bread, and an olive tapenade), and my main course. I also had a glass of white wine.\n\nHowever, I was left a bit underwhelmed by my entrée. The steak was cooked more than I would've liked it to be, and the potatoes tasted underseasoned.\n\nBecause I had a satisfying meal at the lounge, though, I wasn't too disappointed.\n\nHowever, dessert is where things really stood out. The flight attendants came around with an ice-cream sundae cart, where passengers could build their own treat with different toppings.\n\nI went all out with caramel sauce, hot fudge, chocolate chips, and cherries.\n\nAfter eating, I got ready for bed in the spacious cabin bathroom and settled in for a good night's rest. Honestly, the best part of this seat was how well I slept.\n\nBeyond the luxury bedding, the seat itself reclines into a completely flat bed. There's even a footrest up front that adds extra room.\n\nAccording to United's website, the bed offers about 77 inches of sleeping room. As someone who's just over 5 feet tall, this was more than enough space to stretch out completely.\n\nThe controls on the side of the seat made it easy to adjust everything exactly as I liked. Between the fully flat bed, plush bedding, walls surrounding my pod, and my sleeping mask and earplugs, I slept just as comfortably as I would've at home.\n\nSince my flight was a red-eye, I landed in Morocco at 9 a.m. with a full day of events ahead of me. Being well-rested made all the difference and allowed me to hit the ground running.\n\nAlthough I thought the upgrade was completely worth it because I used points, I probably wouldn't pay full price for a business-class seat.\n\nHowever, I'd gladly use any points or upgrades I had available to recreate this experience in the future.",

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Luke Breen, co-owner of specialty bike shop Perennial Cycle in uptown Minneapolis. The following conversation has been edited for brevity and clarity.\n\nPerennial is a specialty bike shop. We do cargo bikes, city utility bikes, and commuting bikes, and have been a niche business for 33 years.\n\nPerennial focuses on community events. Last year, we did 35 organized community rides. So, while we do rely on selling bikes, we're very community-driven. That's always been a big piece of Perennial Cycle.\n\nYou cannot be in Minneapolis without ICE's presence impacting your day-to-day. You just simply cannot. Imagine: We had to shut down our schools to keep children safe. It is insane what is happening right now.\n\nAs a bike shop, we've had meetings so we can be aware of each other's levels of anxiety — how we're doing, is everybody OK? For some people, it's going to affect them a little differently, and we've come up with a plan for if ICE is on the block.\n\nWe were closed on Friday, January 23, for the ICE OUT protest. To me, it's a big ask to have small businesses go on strike, and later I heard that it was the first general strike in 80 years. I'm really glad that Perennial did that.\n\nI also went to the march in downtown Minneapolis last Friday afternoon and was a little overwhelmed with emotions. I had no idea how massive it was. When you're in a march like that, you can kind of see the few thousand people that are around you. It isn't until later when you see those overhead videos posted online, and it's like, 'Oh my God.'\n\nIt had an amazing vibe. There was not a lot to cheer about, and yet there's a lot to be together about. It took a lot of awesome organizing to pull that off. There were restaurants that were handing out food. There were tables with cases and cases and cases of hand warmers. It was minus 10 when I went down there, and the wind was blowing. I did not expect that many people because it was so cold.\n\nWe held a fundraiser for MIRAC, a local immigrant rights organization, scheduled for Sunday. I talked with Brieanna, the artist and screenprinter I am working with. We considered canceling. Brieanna and I decided that canceling is exactly what ICE would want us to do. We did not cancel the event.\n\nThere was a line outside the door that was a half-block long at one point. Tons of people showed up. Everybody was just happy to be part of the community. A couple of legal observers explained what it's like to be an observer, knowing that lots of people are very curious about it, but it's pretty intimidating when you just go by what you're seeing on the news and on Instagram. That was part of the aim of the fundraiser: to foster observer conversations.\n\nWe raised over $4,000. We brought in, I don't know, probably like 20 grocery bags of food for a food shelf. All those things were great, but the most appreciation came from people saying they were happy to be together, happy to have a place to go and be around other people who were kind of in mourning.\n\nWe had little cheat sheets with information about the event that we handed out when visitors walked in the door. One of the things was, \"Yes, we're a bike shop Monday through Saturday, but today we're not. Please don't ask us questions about bikes.\" We just didn't have the capacity to do bike stuff.\n\nThere were plenty of people at the fundraiser who weren't familiar with the bike shop. But plenty of people who were like, \"Wow, this is kind of weird. Why is this happening in a bike shop?\" And that was kind of fun explaining that, actually, this is very normal because we focus on community events. We have Cambros containers for serving coffee to 100 people. We have serving trays for treats. We have all the things that are necessary to organize an event like this. The bike shop actually already has the musicians who were singing.\n\nIt's off-season for me. I am really happy to have found a place to plug in to be useful during what's happening in Minneapolis right now. Numerous people came up and thanked me for opening the shop and doing the fundraiser. Most of the kind words were about community and not about raising money.\n\nHopefully, the shop will make it through, but honestly, it is a real challenge.\n\nOur city's under siege, but in reality, we all know it's our country that's under siege. We know a lot of people are super challenged by what's going on right now. I sell pretty expensive bicycles. These cargo bikes are not cheap. So for me, the tariffs have completely turned my life upside down. I'm learning that there is a plural for the word crisis, and it's crises. And that's what I'm looking at — one crisis on top of another.\n\nI have high seasons and low seasons. It's a low season, so I have to be very protective with my money right now. Any loss of income is a big deal because we're barely going to cover expenses for the month. This is a typical cycle for a business in Minnesota, a very seasonal business, so none of that is overwhelming. But, yeah, that's why the strike was definitely a big ask, and I'm so happy I did it. I believe that the store will reap rewards on the other side of this.",

    "title": "The questions Leonis Capital investors ask to see if a startup's tech actually holds up",
    "description": "Leonis Capital founders Jenny Xiao and Jay Zhao tell Business Insider what they ask AI startup founders to evaluate their tech.",
    "fullText": "If you hadn't heard, there's an AI race sweeping through Silicon Valley.\n\nWhile stalwarts like Google, Meta, and Microsoft, and newcomers like OpenAI and Anthropic, are grabbing the headlines as they unveil model after model, there are plenty of startups trying to find a foothold.\n\nFor investors, it can be hard to tell which of these upstarts have true technical potential and which are likely to fade into tech oblivion.\n\nThat's part of why Jenny Xiao, the cofounder of Leonis Capital, said it's important for venture capitalists to get serious about understanding the AI technology they're investing in.\n\nLeonis Capital, founded in 2021, is now deploying its second $40 million fund. The venture capital firm is focused on next-generation AI companies and has invested in over a dozen since its launch, including MaintainX, Motion, and SpectroCloud.\n\nBusiness Insider asked Xiao and her cofounder, Jay Zhao, to share the top five questions they ask founders when evaluating their tech. They shared their responses over email, which have been condensed and edited for clarity.\n\nThe best founders don't think in terms of incremental feature improvements — they think in capability thresholds. We're looking for whether they understand that progress in AI is often non-linear, and whether they can anticipate which future capabilities might fundamentally change or even break their product.\n\nOne of the most interesting takeaways from our Leonis AI 100 — where we benchmarked the most important AI startups — is that the strongest AI founders build just ahead of the next technical breakthrough.\n\nA good answer talks about entirely new workflows that get unlocked, not just marginal efficiency gains, and clearly explains how the company would adapt or pivot as the technology evolves.\n\nMost AI startups don't fail because they're bad, but because they're building something that OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google can eventually ship \"for free\" as a feature.\n\nThat's why we don't accept \"they're not focused on this\" as an answer. We push founders to explain what internal constraint would actually prevent a foundation model lab from building the same thing. If the answer comes down to focus or culture, that's not a real moat.\n\nStrong answers acknowledge that the big labs technically could build it, but doing so would break their incentive structure, pricing, or distribution model; require operational complexity that doesn't scale for them; or shift value to downstream execution rather than model capability.\n\nSome founders can also credibly argue they have a 12- to 18-month head start. Weak answers, by contrast, lean on claims like being \"more vertical,\" having \"more niche data,\" or understanding customers better — responses we hear from about 95% of founders.\n\nWe've noticed a consistent pattern: Most founders underestimate foundation models, and most VCs underestimate them even more.\n\nAsking \"How much proprietary data do you have?\" is usually the wrong question, since no early-stage company has truly meaningful data. And if a founder's pitch boils down to \"we have more data, therefore our models are better,\" that's a red flag: foundation models often improve faster than proprietary ones, and the companies building them have enough capital to buy data and quickly close any gaps.\n\nWhat matters much more is not how much data exists today, but whether the product naturally generates better data over time. For example, industrial systems where data only emerges once software is embedded in workflows, or products where switching costs come from accumulated context.\n\nWe ask this question to understand where defensibility actually lives once code becomes commoditized. If a founder can't answer it clearly, they likely don't understand their own moat.\n\nCosmetic advantages like code, UI, or models are easy to copy, while structural advantages — such as being a system of record or being embedded into compliance, audits, or standard operating procedures — are much harder to replicate.\n\nThe question also reveals founder temperament: Strong founders are candid about their vulnerabilities (\"Here's what we're most worried about\"), while weaker ones tend to get defensive and insist a threat \"would never happen.\"\n\nThis question forces founders to explain their earliest technical decisions and the trade-offs they intentionally made, revealing whether they understand system dynamics rather than just iterating on features.\n\nStrong answers sound like, \"We chose to execute actions, not just make suggestions, which increased liability but created real lock-in,\" or \"We became the system of record instead of a thin layer, which slowed integrations and sales early but made switching organizationally expensive later.\" By contrast, many founders default to saying they want to \"stay flexible,\" which often signals they haven't yet designed anything fundamental.\n\nThe best AI systems are opinionated by design, deliberately removing degrees of freedom and hard-coding assumptions about workflows, authority, or data flow.\n\nReal insight usually comes from abandoning old assumptions. This question helps distinguish founders who simply stumbled into AI from those who experienced a genuine shift in how they see the world.\n\nWe're looking for intellectual flexibility, not credentials. Strong answers point to a specific belief the founder once held, why they believed it, and what changed their mind; weak answers stay vague, like saying they \"realized AI was going to be big.\"\n\nThis question assumes copying is possible and pushes founders to explain what isn't obvious. Shallow answers fall back on claims like \"they couldn't move as fast\" or \"they don't have our data,\" while stronger ones point to hard-to-see advantages such as deep operational knowledge, customer-specific integrations, or accumulated context that isn't visible from the outside.\n\nFounders who can't point to moments where they changed their mind usually aren't learning — they're executing a fixed plan in a world that won't stay fixed.\n\nThis question reveals epistemic humility and whether a founder is genuinely truth-seeking or just looking for confirmation. AI moves too fast for people who can't update, and we're especially wary of founders who treat every pivot as vindication rather than correction.\n\nMarket timing, regulatory shifts, and platform dependencies kill far more startups than bad management. This question tests whether founders think probabilistically about external forces and whether they've designed for resilience instead of relying on luck.\n\nFounders who say \"nothing\" haven't thought hard enough. The ones we want to back can name several concrete external risks and explain how they're hedging against them.\n\nThe best founders aren't contrarian for its own sake, but they can hold an unpopular position long enough for the world to catch up.",

    "description": "It turns out investors are willing to forgive huge capital spending if a company's core business is thriving.",
    "fullText": "Heading into Wednesday's hoy trinity of earnings — which saw Meta, Microsoft, and Tesla report within five minutes of each other — everyone knew that updates on AI progress would be the only game in town.\n\nHow those results ended up playing out shed crucial light on where we are in the AI trade right now.\n\nThe overarching focus for the Big Tech trio was not who has immediately seen results from AI investment. Instead, it was whether those companies were doing enough to support the appearance of maybe, eventually doing something. Investors love the prospect of future upside, and want a reason to preserve their optimism.\n\nEach of the three companies showcased this trend in their own unique way. Let's go one by one:\n\nLast quarter, Meta was punished for its capex-spending plans. This quarter, the company once again blew the doors off spending forecasts … but this time the market seemed OK with it.\n\nWhat changed? Look no further than the company's stronger-than-expected first-quarter revenue, driven by a big beat in advertising. Meta CFO Susan Li also got investors hyped on the earnings call by saying the company will fund its AI ambitions primarily with cash, rather than debt.\n\nIn the end, it's not that Meta has tangible proof that its AI spending is going to generate monstrous future earnings growth. The company has instead fallen back on its cash-cow advertising business to alleviate financing pressures and buy itself more time.\n\nWe haven't yet gotten an answer about whether the AI spending will pay off. We just know the company can afford to keep pursuing it.\n\nMarket reception: Very positive\n\nI present the counterpoint to Meta's well-received quarter. Microsoft also announced much larger-than-expected spending plans … and its stock fell.\n\nThe difference? One of Microsoft's main cash cows — its Azure cloud-computing unit — showed slowing growth. Suddenly, big spending doesn't look so appealing when your backstop is weakening.\n\nWhile Tesla's AI push has taken the form of self-driving vehicles and robotics, the company's lofty valuation is still being largely driven by hopes that big AI-linked profits will one day be unlocked.\n\nBut unlike Meta, the EV-maker is doing it at a time when its core business is in decline. One overlooked highlight of Tesla's report was that — even though the company posted a bottom-line beat — it also saw first-ever decline in annual revenue.\n\nIt didn't matter. Investors instead focused on Tesla's $2 billion investment in xAI, the company owned by Elon Musk. They also seemed to take the discontinuation of the Model S and Y vehicles in stride.\n\nAgain, the perception of eventually monetizing AI won out. In the AI race, it's not what you're doing, it's what you can convince everyone you're going to do down the line.",

    "description": "Some small-business owners in Portland, Maine, are debating how best to support staff and customers amid a federal immigration crackdown.",
    "fullText": "After Andy Gerry and his business partners put a \"No ICE\" sign in the window of their lobster roll shop in Portland, Maine, backlash followed quickly.\n\nGerry said dozens of bad reviews flooded the restaurant last week after lists circulated online of area businesses that had hung \"No ICE\" posters following the federal government's announcement that it would increase immigration enforcement in the state.\n\nFor Gerry and his co-owners at The Highroller Lobster Co., it was one more challenge of running a small business.\n\n\"The posters are up, and they're not coming down,\" Gerry said.\n\nBusiness Insider spoke with a half-dozen local business owners, including Gerry, about their decision to take a stance on immigration agents' presence in Portland, including whether to post signs.\n\nAlso on the table: Should they go along with calls for shutting businesses and schools on Friday as part of what organizers hope will be a nationwide campaign.\n\nGerry said that some owners he's been speaking with favor taking part in the stoppage, and others are calling for businesses to remain open to divert profits to groups helping immigrants.\n\nAlready this week, Gerry said, he's flip-flopped over whether to keep the restaurant open on Friday. His current thought: Close for the day and donate weekend proceeds to charities helping those affected by the immigration sweep.\n\nThese are the sorts of calculations that many small-business owners across the US have considered over the past few months. The question has felt especially urgent lately in Portland, a seaside city of about 70,000, where immigration officials have had a more visible presence over the past week.\n\nWhile some of corporate America's top executives have weighed in with statements about the immigration actions, some small-business owners — answering phones and facing customers directly — are making personal choices about whether to publicly take action.\n\nSome workers and owners at more than a dozen businesses Business Insider visited didn't want to discuss the immigration issue because they said it didn't pertain to their day-to-day operations. Others said they didn't want to upset neighboring businesses or draw attention.\n\nGerry said he saw putting up the sign, created by a Portland artist, as a way to amplify his staffers' voices and support anyone who might be fearful of getting caught up in the immigration sweep.\n\nHe said he contacted restaurant review sites to flag the negative ratings, and he and his co-owners instructed the restaurant's more than 50 staffers on how to handle negative phone calls. He shared with Business Insider screenshots of commenters encouraging people to \"review bomb\" the restaurant.\n\nEarlier this month, Eden Millecchia hung a \"No ICE\" poster in the window of her airy shop, called Flowers & Candy. The following week, she attended an online training conducted by a chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union about where federal agents are permitted to go within a business if they don't have a warrant.\n\nMillecchia said she feels she's in a more privileged position to speak up than some other shopkeepers.\n\n\"I'm the white lady who can yell,\" she said.\n\nYet, Millecchia said, motioning toward the poster, the sign is a \"hollow gesture\" — other than the show of support it sends.\n\nWhat is tangible, she said, is the drop in sales she's seen since word spread that immigration agents were focusing on Maine. For the long weekend that included Martin Luther King Day — which also included some unforgiving winter weather — her sales were down 91% year-over-year, Millecchia said.\n\n\"They killed my three-day weekend, and I think that it's going to keep people from coming here,\" she said, referring to the presence of federal officers.\n\nThat could mean fewer people will pick up the CBD products whose sales she relies on to help make rent. Another disruption: She plans to close on Friday to support the strike.\n\nAn ICE spokesperson told Business Insider that it doesn't comment on immigration enforcement operations. US Customs and Border Protection didn't respond to a request for comment.\n\nOn the steps outside Arcana Maine, a shop that sits opposite a small park and sells jewelry and works by area artists, a circular table recently displayed free business-card-sized guides to rights enshrined in the Constitution. The cards were printed in English, Spanish, French, Arabic, Somali, and Kinyarwanda, which is spoken in parts of Africa.\n\nAn employee named Nico, who declined to give his last name, said that giving the cards a prominent spot was a way to help the community.\n\nHe estimated that foot traffic at the store had fallen by at least half from what's typical for January.\n\nAt a skate shop called Mocean, owner Jasper Tripp said he hung a \"No ICE\" sign because it aligned with his beliefs. Ordinarily, he said, he tries to separate his political views from the store he has run for nearly a decade.\n\n\"It just feels right,\" Tripp said of the decision to put up the poster. He worked with an artist to design an anti-ICE T-shirt. Proceeds from its sale will go to charities supporting immigrants' legal expenses, he said.\n\nFor some business owners, concerns go beyond the risk of alienating customers. One restaurant owner said she plans to shut down for at least a week — and pay workers — while she's out of town. Ordinarily, she said, her employees would run the restaurant, which has an entirely Spanish-speaking staff.\n\nShe asked that Business Insider not use her name or that of her restaurant to protect her employees, who she said are legal immigrants but who nevertheless feel threatened.\n\nShe taped a \"No ICE\" poster to the door to help employees and customers to feel safe, not to denounce immigration agents, she said.\n\nThe balance is tricky, the owner added. \"I have the responsibility to keep people safe. I also have an economic responsibility.\"",

    "fullText": "Lord Stockwood says people in government ‘definitely’ talking about idea as technology disrupts industries\n\nThe UK could introduce a universal basic income (UBI) to protect workers in industries that are being disrupted by AI, the investment minister Jason Stockwood has said.\n\n“Bumpy” changes to society caused by the introduction of the technology would mean there would have to be “some sort of concessionary arrangement with jobs that go immediately”, Lord Stockwood said.\n\nThe Labour peer told the Financial Times: “Undoubtedly we’re going to have to think really carefully about how we soft-land those industries that go away, so some sort of [universal basic income], some sort of lifelong mechanism as well so people can retrain.”\n\nA universal basic income is not part of official government policy, but when asked whether people in government were considering the need for UBI, Stockwood told the FT: “People are definitely talking about it.”\n\nThe technology entrepreneur, who took up his ministerial post in September, said part of his motivation for joining the government was to help ensure the workforce was prepared for rapid change.\n\nFears continue to grow about the impact of artificial intelligence on Britain’s job market. This week research by the investment bank Morgan Stanley found the UK was losing more jobs than it is creating because of AI and was being hit harder than other large economies.\n\nThis month the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said AI could destroy swathes of jobs in the capital and “usher in a new era of mass unemployment”.\n\nLast week, Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of the US bank JP Morgan, told the World Economic Forum in Davos that governments and businesses would have to step in to help workers whose roles were displaced by the technology, or risk civil unrest.\n\nStockwood, who held senior positions at Lastminute.com, Travelocity and Match.com, oversaw the $490m (£400m at the time) sale of the online insurance broker Simply Business to the US insurer Travelers in 2017. He later bought a stake the football club of his home town, Grimsby Town FC.\n\nWhile he has previously been a vocal proponent of a wealth tax in the UK, Stockwood told the FT he had not repeated his calls for the government to go further on taxing the rich.\n\nHowever, he added: “If you make your money and the first thing you do is you speak to a tax adviser to ask: ‘Where can we pay the lowest tax?’ we don’t want those people in this country, I’d suggest, because you’re not committed to your communities and the long-term success in this country.”\n\nStockwood was preceded as investment minister by Poppy Gustafsson, a former chief executive of the cybersecurity firm Darktrace, who stepped down after less than a year in the job.",

That left the community without a true grocery store for years, forcing people to drive nearly a half-hour to pick up basics, or to overpay for them at local specialty stores.\n\nSomething similar happened when the K-Mart closed in Key West. That shutdown, one of the last in the chain, robbed that remote area of its only department store, forcing residents to drive four to five hours before they hit a Walmart or a Target.\n\nResidents in the Pacific Northwest now face similar challenges, according to local reports.\n\nIn the markets it serves, Cascade Farm and Outdoor, which is closing all its stores, will leave a similar hole for consumers.\n\nA rival to Tractor Supply, Cascade Farm serves farmers and rural communities.

    "title": "Oprah Winfrey turned her weight-loss journey into a business. Here's how her health empire has evolved.",
    "description": "Oprah Winfrey's newest book, \"Enough,\" is about her relationship with weight-loss drugs. Since the '90s, she has been combining her health with business.",
    "fullText": "Oprah Winfrey has spent years turning her private health journey into a public conversation — and, at times, a lucrative business.\n\nThe billionaire, real-estate mogul, talk-show host, journalist, actor, and producer has just released her 12th book: \"Enough: Your Health, Your Weight, and What It's Like To Be Free.\"\n\nThe book, which she co-authored with Dr. Ania M. Jastreboff, a doctor and professor at Yale's School of Medicine, dives into the role of GLP-1 drugs to facilitate weight loss.\n\nThe practice is something that Winfrey herself has touted. On CNN in December 2024, she said she had first begun using a GLP-1 before Christmas in 2023.\n\nWinfrey has been combining her personal health and fitness with business for decades, including investing in WeightWatchers (now WW International), writing books about health, identifying exercise and health trends for her show and magazine, and putting her support behind figures like Dr. Mehmet Oz, who is now the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\nWinfrey did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nHere's a timeline of how her health empire has evolved.\n\nDuring a 1988 episode of \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" — a few years after Joan Rivers asked about Winfrey's weight gain — Winfrey wheeled out a red wagon filled with 67 pounds of animal fat.\n\nWhy? To convey to her audience how much weight she'd lost in the last year while on the Optifast liquid diet.\n\nThe episode put a spotlight on medically supervised liquid formula diets. After it aired, The New York Times reported that Winfrey got just 400 calories a day from Optifast and wrote that the ability of people on such diets \"to maintain the loss is questionable and not yet fully evaluated.\"\n\nFor a 2005 issue of O, The Oprah Magazine, Winfrey wrote, \"For four solid months, I didn't eat a single morsel of food,\" and lost 67 pounds. \"What I didn't know was that my metabolism was shot. Two weeks after I returned to real food, I was up 10 pounds.\"\n\nWhile she was proud of losing the weight, Winfrey later regretted the decision to pull the wagon out.\n\n\"When I look at that show, I think it was one of the biggest ego trips of my life,\" Winfrey told Entertainment Tonight in 2011.\n\nShe cowrote \"Make the Connection: Ten Steps to a Better Body and a Better Life\" with exercise physiologist (and her personal trainer) Bob Greene.\n\nThe 10 steps included guidance such as \"exercise 20 to 60 minutes a day,\" \"eat a low-fat, balanced diet,\" and \"eat three meals and two snacks each day.\"\n\nIt went on to become a No. 1 bestseller and is still in circulation.\n\nWinfrey introduced audiences to Phil McGraw, aka Dr. Phil, in the late '90s as her show's resident relationship expert. He proved so popular that Winfrey produced and co-created a spinoff of \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" starring McGraw: \"Dr. Phil.\" It aired from 2002 to 2023, and for most of its run, it was second in ratings only to Winfrey's show.\n\nLike Winfrey, McGraw frequently discussed weight loss and health on his show, and also lent his face and name to nutritional supplements. As The New York Times wrote in 2003, \"Oprah Winfrey has talked about weight loss — hers and everyone else's — for years. Her protégé Dr. Phil has found a way to make money from it.\"\n\nHe's also written his own weight-loss books, including \"The Ultimate Weight Solution: The 7 Keys to Weight Loss Freedom\" and \"The Ultimate Weight Solution Food Guide.\"\n\nWinfrey also introduced Dr. Mehmet Oz to her show's audience. He made his \"Oprah\" debut in 2004 and ultimately appeared more than 60 times, per NPR, before Winfrey greenlit \"The Dr. Oz Show\" in 2009. It aired until 2022, when he began a US Senate campaign in Pennsylvania.\n\nSimilarly, Oz's program featured many segments on weight loss, and Oz himself endorsed multiple \"cures\" for obesity that have been disproven. He was appointed administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services in 2024.\n\nWhile it's not known how much money Winfrey made from their two shows, both aired for over a decade (with reruns on Winfrey's channel, OWN), and Winfrey's production company, Harpo Productions, was involved throughout.\n\nWinfrey's own show, which aired for 25 years, was the foundation of her wealth, rocketing her to millionaire status when it became nationally syndicated in 1986. By 2003, she was a billionaire, and she's now worth an estimated $3.2 billion, Forbes reported.\n\nIn 2015, Winfrey announced she was joining the board of WeightWatchers (now known as WW International, or WW) and was purchasing a 10% stake in the company worth $43 million.\n\nThe New York Times reported in 2015 that it led to an increase of $400 million in market value for the brand, which had been trending downward before Winfrey's involvement.\n\n\"WeightWatchers has given me the tools to begin to make the lasting shift that I and so many of us who are struggling with weight have longed for,\" she said in a statement. \"I believe in the program so much I decided to invest in the company and partner in its evolution.\"\n\nIt's an example of the Oprah Effect: the trend of Winfrey endorsing, supporting, or investing in a brand that leads to a spike in value.\n\nWinfrey posted on X (then Twitter) a video about how she'd lost 26 pounds on WeightWatchers while still eating bread.\n\n\"I love bread,\" she said. \"That's the genius of this program. I lost 26 pounds, and I have eaten bread every single day.\"\n\nAccording to MarketWatch, the subsequent bump in the stock price, just one hour after the post, netted Winfrey around $12 million.\n\nWinfrey's cookbook, which also reached bestseller status, incorporated the WeightWatchers system into its recipes and flagged the number of points each meal was worth, in a neat bit of corporate synergy.\n\nSoon after confirming her use of a GLP-1, Winfrey publicly said she wouldn't be seeking reelection to the board.\n\nThe announcement sent WeightWatchers' stock tumbling 25%. As Business Insider wrote at the time, it seemed like Winfrey was jumping ship from an \"outdated operating system\" in the age of Ozempic and other GLP-1s.\n\nWinfrey's latest book, \"Enough,\" which she cowrote with Dr. Ania M. Jastreboff, was released in January 2026. It details Winfrey's experience with GLP-1s, combined with Jastreboff's expertise.\n\nWinfrey has been promoting her book heavily, including a stop on \"CBS Sunday Morning,\" where she explained how reframing her relationship to obesity and weight has changed her life.\n\n\"I'm not going to, but I could weep right now for all of the many days and nights I've journaled about this being my fault and why can't I conquer this thing?\" she said.\n\n\"There are tools to use that can help you. And I do see [GLP-1s] as a tool,\" she continued.",

    "fullText": "​In the fiercely competitive market ​of the online multiplayer game, Highguard​’s rocky start means it now has a lot to prove\n\nDon’t get Pushing Buttons delivered to your inbox? \nIn the fast-paced, almost psychotically unforgiving video game business, you really do have to stick the landing. Launching a new game is an artform in itself – do you go for months of slowly building hype or a sudden shock reveal, simultaneously announcing and releasing a new project in one fell swoop? The latter worked incredibly well for online shooter Apex Legends, which remains one of the genre’s stalwarts six years after its surprise launch on 4 February 2019. What you don’t do with a new release, is something that falls awkwardly between those two approaches. Enter Highguard.\n\nThis new online multiplayer title from newcomer Wildlight Entertainment has an excellent pedigree. The studio was formed by ex-Respawn Entertainment staff, most of whom previously worked on Titanfall, Call of Duty and the aforementioned Apex Legends. They know what they’re doing. But the launch has been … troubled.\n\nThe game was revealed via a rather oblique trailer that closed last December’s lavish Game Awards event. Most viewers were expecting the ceremony to end with something huge – a major new announcement from Hideo Kojima, perhaps, or maybe a GTA 6 song and dance number. What they got was a short look at a fantasy-themed online shooter that no one had heard of – and it didn’t go down well.\n\nIt turns out that Wildlight hadn’t planned to reveal the game before its 26 January launch – they were going to pull another Apex Legends shadow drop – but Game Awards organiser Geoff Keighley played the game, liked it and offered them a free slot at his show. The team couldn’t turn it down. Although perhaps, with hindsight, they should have.\n\nNow it’s out in the open and it’s actually pretty interesting. Combining elements of an online shooter and a Moba (multiplayer online battle arena game), players get into two teams of three, select from a group of differently skilled hero characters and then try to destroy the other side’s base before their own is destroyed. The action comes in phases – first you fortify your castle, then you explore the landscape for loot and power-ups, then the fighting begins. Each part sort of feels like a different game and as I played the first few rounds, I was constantly thinking “ooh, that’s a bit like Rainbow Six Siege” and “ooh, this bit’s like Fortnite”. But the game does have an identity of its own, thanks to its fantasy/mythological styling – you get to ride a sort of spirit horse around the landscape, while different heroes throw lightning bolts or erect walls of ice.\n\nHowever, they also carry shotguns and assault rifles, so that it feels like a weird cross between Call of Duty and a Ray Harryhausen movie. What Respawn has always done well is design incredibly smooth kinetic playspaces, where traversal is rarely impeded. This is a trait that Wildlight Entertainment has inherited – in Highguard you can run, slide, climb and leap in seamless movements, rarely getting stuck on the scenery.\n\nBut sadly, the game’s disproportionately opulent reveal at the Game Awards has caused some issues. Almost immediately after launch, negative reviews started streaming on to the game’s Steam page, with players complaining about visual performance issues and long queues to get a match – which doesn’t feel that fair for a game that had only been online for a couple of hours. You have to wonder how destructive that unexpected Game Awards teaser was – the gamer community can be incredibly judgmental and they have long, bitter memories.\n\nHighguard did attract around 100k players on day one, not a bad start for a newcomer to the crowded online multiplayer space, but there’s a lot of work to do. The last couple of years has been a battlefield for online blasters, the scarred landscape strewn with the skeletons of failed competitors from Concord to Hyenas and Battleborn. On top of this, Valve, the company behind Steam, has its own Moba-inspired online team game, Deadlock, in development and reaction to the closed beta tests has been positive. Valve is not a rival anyone really wants to go up against.\n\nAnd there’s a reason everyone wants to be in this space – Fortnite is making around $5bn a year, and Battlefield 6 was one of the bestselling games of 2025. But considering the risks (hundreds of millions of dollars in development and marketing costs) and the volatile, unpredictable market, I can’t help but feel worried for the Highguard team. They’re banking on players staying around for months, building a community of adoring fans, maintaining huge concurrent player numbers. But it’s going to take a lot to get over the hurdle of that botched reveal.\n\nBesides, I have a feeling the next mega hit online shooter won’t be a Frankenstein’s monster of a game, sewn together from the recognisable body parts of previous hits. It’ll be something wild and fresh and new – a Godzilla, emerging from the depths of the game-development ocean, unexpected and bizarre and covered in seaweed. And whatever it is, it won’t get the end slot at the Game Awards, we’ll never see it coming.\n\n“Is this another one of your masochist games?” asked my partner, somewhat warily, watching me play mountain-climbing game Cairn this week. (He is well aware of my affection for extremely difficult video games; he’s witnessed me struggle through so many of them.) Cairn is a game about extreme mountaineering, in which you must move storied climber Aava’s individual limbs to find hand and footholds in the forbidding cliff faces of Kami, a mountain that has never been summited. Aava is obstinately determined to be the first person to get to the top, and as the game progresses, I began to question that obsession (and my own obsession with playing it). It is thoughtful, beautiful, and not always easy, and has provoked a lot of reflection. Look out for the full review on the Guardian tomorrow, in which I will be able to say much more. Keza MacDonald\n\nAvailable on: PS5, PC, Xbox\nEstimated playtime: 10-15 hours (for one epic climb)\n\nWe could use some positive games industry news, so how about this: according to GamesIndustry.biz, the unique newsletter-based indie games publisher Pantaloon has secured £150k to invest into new titles. Pantaloon offers its premium subscribers access to a range of new titles for £3.99 a month. Co-founder Jamin Smith stated, “We’re trying to invite risk back into the equation, find weirder, more wonderful, more creatively refreshing work that we can put our names to.”\n\nAs one of the few people who actually played on the Virtual Boy when it arrived in 1995, I was surprised to see that Nintendo is bringing the headache-inducing retro system to the Nintendo Switch and Switch 2, complete with replica accessory and downloadable games. Now it’s been revealed that the lineup of digital titles will include an unreleased sequel to classic racer F-Zero named Zero Racers. You’ll need a subscription to the Nintendo Switch Online service to play it, but this is a fascinating and rare chance to play a Nintendo game that never made it to the shelves. Also coming is platforming adventure, D-Hopper which was cancelled due to the demise of the Virtual Boy. Just make sure to have painkillers to hand.\n\nThe pleasure of watching seasons pass in Animal Crossing is the theme of this lovely piece by journalist and author Jay Castello. Although you could feasibly skip the game’s fallow winter periods, having patience and embracing the darkness is part of the game’s slow charm.\n\n‘I didn’t have anything to prove’: what Traitors finalist Jade Scott learned about survival from video games\n\nPikachu and pals go wild: Pokémon theme park opens in Tokyo\n\nWhy I’m launching a feminist video games website in 2026\n\n‘It’s the underground Met Gala of concrete murderzone design’: welcome to the Quake Brutalist Game Jam\n\nReturn to Silent Hill – video game horror series births another middling movie | ★★☆☆☆\n\nKeza answers this week’s question from reader Caitlin:\n\n“I am endlessly thinking about games that take gamer expectations and use them in some way to enhance or subvert the experience – like Tunic, which plays with nostalgia for game manuals and secrets from the SNES days, or Inscryption, or Alan Wake 2. In each case there’s a way you think the game should go, and then the designers use your own gaming literacy to challenge those expectations. Can you say more about this small wave of games?”\n\nThis is also a favourite mini-genre of mine, as someone who for both professional and personal reasons has played really a lot of video games. One of the first games like this I ever played was Shadow of the Colossus. Go kill the big monster, the game tells you, as hundreds of games had before. Then you find the first colossus, and it’s just peacefully wandering around. You climb it and slay it, and there’s no fanfare for you. The creature crumples and dies. I felt a little bit sick. Spec Ops: The Line was also famous for doing this: telling the player to kill, then inviting them to feel awful about it. But as you point out, there are plenty more ways to subvert player expectations now. Frog Fractions is a classic; if you know nothing about this game, that’s perfect, just play it. The Stanley Parable was a great comedy-ish entry in this tradition, as is Undertale. And then there’s the recent run of games – Indika, Baby Steps – that mock you and your “gamer brain”. Never forget that Zelda: Breath of the Wild awards you with a poop-shaped trophy if you go to the immense trouble of finding every single Korok seed in the game.

    "description": "The layoffs mark the second round of mass cuts at Amazon since last October, when the company laid off roughly 14,000 employees across its corporate workforce.",
    "fullText": "Amazon said Wednesday it plans to eliminate about 16,000 corporate jobs, marking its second round of mass job cuts since last October.\n\nIn a blog post, the company wrote that the layoffs were part of an ongoing effort to \"strengthen our organization by reducing layers, increasing ownership, and removing bureaucracy.\" That coincides with a push to invest heavily in artificial intelligence.\n\nThe cuts come just a few months after October's layoffs, when 14,000 employees were let go across Amazon's corporate workforce. At the time, the company indicated the cuts would continue in 2026 as it found \"additional places we can remove layers.\"\n\nBeth Galetti, Amazon's senior vice president of people experience and technology, didn't rule out more job cuts in the future, but said the company isn't trying to create \"a new rhythm\" of broad layoffs every few months.\n\n\"That's not our plan,\" Galetti wrote. \"But just as we always have, every team will continue to evaluate the ownership, speed, and capacity to invent for customers, and make adjustments as appropriate.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, some employees in Amazon's cloud unit received an email sent in an apparent error acknowledging \"organizational changes\" at the company. The note referenced a post from Galetti and said Amazon notified \"impacted colleagues in our organization.\"\n\nAmazon had about 1.58 million employees as of the end of its third quarter. That figure is primarily made up of warehouse and logistics workers.\n\nThe 30,000 job cuts since October represent about 10% of its corporate and tech workforce, which comprises about 350,000 people.\n\nAmazon has been in the midst of a significant downsizing for the past several years. The company laid off more than 27,000 employees between 2022 and 2023, and it conducted smaller cuts across various organizations in 2024.\n\nCEO Andy Jassy has looked to slim down Amazon's workforce after the company went on a hiring spree during the Covid-19 pandemic, partly to meet a surge in demand for e-commerce and cloud computing services.\n\nJassy has also looked to reset Amazon's corporate culture so that it can operate like the \"world's largest startup.\" He set internal targets to slash management layers and established a \"no bureaucracy email alias\" to identify ways the company can innovate faster.\n\nAmazon has also been cutting costs across its business so that it can invest \n\nLast October, Amazon said it expects capital expenditures to reach $125 billion for 2026, the highest spending forecast among the megacap companies.\n\nJassy said last June that efficiency gains from AI would likely cause Amazon's corporate headcount to fall in the coming years.\n\n\"We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs,\" Jassy said at the time.",

    "description": "Reid Hoffman says business leaders are wrong to stay silent and that they have a responsibility to speak up.",
    "fullText": "Business leaders who believe staying quiet about the Trump administration will protect their companies are making a dangerous miscalculation, says Reid Hoffman.\n\nThe LinkedIn cofounder and tech investor said in an episode of the \"Rapid Response\" podcast published Tuesday that he rejects the idea that executives can simply wait out political turbulence.\n\n\"The theory that if you just keep your mouth shut, the storm will blow over and it won't be a problem — you should be disabused of that theory now,\" Hoffman said.\n\nHoffman is a longtime Democratic donor and one of Silicon Valley's most outspoken political voices. He has backed Democratic candidates and causes for years and has publicly clashed with pro-Trump business leaders, including the White House AI czar, David Sacks.\n\nIn 2024, Hoffman contributed $2 million to a super PAC that spearheaded a write-in campaign for President Joe Biden in New Hampshire.\n\nHoffman said fear of retaliation from the Trump administration has made many business leaders hesitant to speak publicly, but fear is exactly the wrong guide. Executives should speak out instead of rationalizing that \"it's the right thing for my business,\" he added.\n\nHoffman framed public engagement as a responsibility that comes with wealth and power.\n\n\"Human beings first,\" he said. \"Humanity, society, right, you are members of both of those.\"\n\n\"Anyone who's wealthy in the society should be extremely grateful for being part of the society. You have responsibilities,\" he added.\n\nHoffman said he is \"regularly called out by the White House\" and added that it should not be punitive for leaders to speak based on their knowledge and experience.\n\n\"Precisely when you feel fear, you should think about, is this a time for courage?\" he said.\n\n\"We need to be speaking up, and we need to be figuring out how to solve our problems together,\" he added.\n\nHoffman's comments come as some business and tech leaders have broken their silence over the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis and the broader immigration crackdown under the Trump administration.\n\nPretti's death — the second killing by federal officers within weeks — has drawn sharp public debate over federal enforcement tactics and accountability.\n\nSome business and tech leaders reacted strongly. Google DeepMind's chief scientist, Jeff Dean, wrote in response to a video of the shooting on X that \"this is absolutely shameful.\"\n\n\"Agents of a federal agency unnecessarily escalating, and then executing a defenseless citizen whose offense appears to be using his cellphone camera,\" he wrote. \"Every person, regardless of political affiliation, should be denouncing this.\"\n\nOthers have joined in, including former Meta chief AI scientist, Yann LeCun. LeCun bluntly labelled the footage of the shooting \"Murderers.\"\n\nA group of more than 60 Minnesota-based CEOs signed a letter on Sunday urging \"de-escalation\" and collaboration among state, local, and federal officials to \"work together to find real solutions.\"\n\nOther CEOs have remained quiet on the issue. Business Insider's Peter Kafka wrote Tuesday that business leaders have several reasons for staying silent, including concern that the Trump administration has made it clear it is willing to pressure or punish companies that don't bend to its will.",

    "fullText": "\"I have a lot, a lot of incredible, good opinions about him,\" said Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola when asked about Oscar Bobb in November.\n\n\"His intuition is extraordinary. The moment he frees his mind he can do it.\"\n\nTwo months on and Bobb is close to leaving for Fulham for a reported fee of around £30m - the 22-year-old Norway winger the latest City youth graduate to depart after breaking into the first team.\n\nSince Guardiola took charge in 2016 and transformed City into an all-conquering team, Cole Palmer, Liam Delap, Brahim Diaz and Tosin Adarabioyo have also come through the ranks to play for the senior side before departing.\n\nIt is a ploy that has served City well.\n\nAccording to Paul MacDonald from FootballTransfers.com, City have made more than £250m selling young players from their talent factory over the past five years alone.\n\nIncluding sell-on fees, that figure is closer to £270m, he says.\n\nBrazilian midfielder Douglas Luiz did not make a competitive appearance for the club before the then 21-year-old was sold to Aston Villa for £15m in 2019.\n\nJadon Sancho was sold to Borussia Dortmund for a reported £8m in 2017 before joining Manchester United £73m just four years later, while Jeremie Frimpong was signed by Liverpool for £29.5m from Bayer Leverkusen last summer. They have both gone on to make names for themselves after leaving City without making a first-team appearance.\n\nMorgan Rogers, who joined City from West Brom at the age of 17 on a professional contract, was sold to Middlesbrough in 2023 and is now thriving for Aston Villa and England.\n\nCity spent a British record £100m on Jack Grealish in 2021, while they invested £77m on Croatia centre-back Josko Gvardiol two years later - and this January spent £65m on Antoine Semenyo and £20m on Marc Guehi.\n\nYet it is their ability to sell young talent that has helped bring in funds for big-money deals.\n\nWhere are they now & what's their market value?, external",

    "fullText": "A move that resonates well beyond a simple change of office address sees Ford Motor Company confirmed that its Lincoln luxury brand will shift its corporate headquarters to Michigan Central Station in Detroit in February 2026.\n\nThe new location will house Lincoln’s marketing, sales, and service leadership teams, while design and engineering functions will remain at Ford’s primary Dearborn campus, now anchored by the new Ford World Headquarters.\n\nAt face value, this relocation might look like a real estate shuffle. But for industry watchers with an eye toward long term strategy, it represents a deliberate effort by Ford to reshape Lincoln’s identity and carve out a distinct role for the luxury marque in a crowded and rapidly evolving market.\n\nMichigan Central Station was once one of the most iconic transportation hubs in the United States. It opened in 1913 and served thousands of passengers a day until rail travel declined sharply in the mid-20th century.\n\nAfter lying abandoned for decades, Ford acquired and undertook an extensive renovation of the station and surrounding campus beginning in 2018, creating a 640,000-square-foot innovation district designed to attract tech partners and startups alongside Ford employees.\n\nThis context is important because Ford’s decision to base Lincoln at Michigan Central couldn’t have been simply a branding exercise. It places the luxury brand at the center of a testbed for future technologies, from autonomous systems to new mobility services.\n\nThe innovation district already hosts Ford’s Model e electric vehicle team and external partners like Newlab, creating a synergy that Lincoln’s leadership must hope will fuel fresh thinking.\n\nLincoln, Ford, Michigan Central Station, Detroit, headquarters, relocation, luxury brand, corporate strategy, innovation district, automotive news, Corktown, brand identity, Joaquin Nuño-Whelan.\n\nLincoln has historically been intertwined with Ford corporate operations. Until recently, the brand’s leaders shared office space with Ford’s global executives in Dearborn’s famed Glass House, a mid-century architectural landmark that served as Ford’s headquarters from 1956 until late 2025.\n\nThe new Ford World Headquarters, known internally as “The Hub,” has replaced the Glass House as Ford’s administrative center. It brings thousands of employees into closer collaboration on product development and corporate strategy. But Lincoln’s leadership must have seen an opportunity in stepping outside that central locus.",

    "description": "Andrew Volk owns a restaurant in Portland, Maine. The city has seen an increased ICE presence, and he says it's already dampening the local business.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Andrew M Volk, owner of Hunt & Alpine in Portland, Maine. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nIn mid-January, I gathered my staff of 10 for a training session on what to do if ICE agents showed up at my restaurant. It came after days of hearing how concerned the team was following news of an increased presence of ICE agents in Portland.\n\nThis is not the kind of information we, as restaurant workers, are accustomed to needing to know and relay. This is all so new. We're entering the unknown. And people are scared of the unknown.\n\nMy staff is scared. I'm scared.\n\nI personally know people, and have heard of many more, staying home because they are afraid of being harassed or picked up by ICE. I'm acquainted with people who have been taken, and I don't know where they are right now.\n\nMy two children have said there are dozens and dozens of kids in their school not showing up because their parents are afraid for their safety.\n\nEveryone has been holding their breath to see what happens next.\n\nMy restaurant is only two blocks from City Hall in downtown Portland. Scattered around our streets, I know there are ICE agents — they are there in plain sight — and it was understandable that my staff were worried about what to do if they knocked on our door. I had to support my staff by giving them some information and direction regarding what to do if one of the ICE agents showed up.\n\nWe learned agents can enter the restaurant, but they aren't entitled to go into private or locked areas without a judicial warrant (we had to define what this warrant is). We don't have to answer questions from agents, and we're allowed to record their actions and words.\n\nI want my staff to know that, although the presence of these agents feels unpredictable, I'm in this with them. We're in it together. I want to be able to talk about what we can control and understand as much information as possible in preparation.\n\nAlthough I can't fix this situation, I can communicate with the people around me to ensure they know I will support them and I will support their communities.\n\nI've owned my restaurant for 12 years. I'm white. I'm a heterosexual man. I don't present as someone who ICE might come after right now, so I want to use my voice in ways others are frightened to.\n\nI haven't had to close my restaurant's doors yet, but I know several restaurant owners who have had to do so on certain days because so many of their staff were too scared to show up to work. These are people who are legally allowed to be in the United States. These are people with no criminal history. And they are petrified to go to work.\n\nThis is going to dampen our local businesses if ICE agents remain in Portland. It already has.\n\nEditor's note: Business Insider reached out to ICE and CBP for comment.",

    "fullText": "Don't expect to see Sam Altman lamenting the absence of \"masculine energy\" in corporate America to Joe Rogan anytime soon.\n\nThe OpenAI CEO sent employees a message on Slack criticizing Immigration and Customs Enforcement — and appears to have taken the opportunity to also take a subtle jab at his rival, Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nThe reference can be found where Altman wrote that OpenAI aims to \"not get blown around by changing fashions.\"\n\n\"We didn't start talking about masculine corporate energy when that was popular,\" Altman told employees.\n\nLast year, Zuckerberg championed a return to masculinity at Meta on \"The Joe Rogan Experience.\"\n\n\"The masculine energy, I think, is good,\" Zuckerberg said in the January podcast episode. \"Society has plenty of that, but I think corporate culture was trying to get away from it.\"\n\nZuckerberg described the merits of a corporate culture that \"celebrates the aggression\" of business.\n\nThe Meta CEO said that the intent of corporate culture's shift away from masculinity was good. Women likely feel that companies are \"too masculine,\" he told Rogan, and that things are \"biased\" against them. But the shift had gone too far, the Facebook cofounder said.\n\n\"It's one thing to say we want to be welcoming and make a good environment for everyone,\" Zuckerberg said. \"It's another to basically say that masculinity is bad.\"\n\nAltman also wrote in his memo that OpenAI didn't \"become super woke when that was popular.\"\n\nMeta didn't respond to Business Insider's request for comment on Altman's remark.\n\nAltman and Zuckerberg are currently engaged in a talent war for top AI researchers and engineers.\n\nZuckerberg has attempted to poach OpenAI employees with eye-popping compensation packages, which Altman in June said included $100 million signing bonuses.\n\nWhile Altman at the time said that he was happy that \"at least so far, none of our best people have decided to take them up on that,\" Zuckerberg successfully hired away some prominent OpenAI talent.\n\nThe Meta CEO, who even hand-delivered soup to an OpenAI employee he was attempting to poach, hired away ChatGPT co-creator Shengjia Zhao and three researchers who helped build OpenAI's Zurich office.",

    "description": "Entrepreneurs like Kim Magaraci, Seneca Connor, and Gloria Hebert use AI tools like ChatGPT to ditch admin busywork and focus on growth and customers.",
    "fullText": "Over eight years of writing for travel publications, Kim Magaraci developed a passion for domestic travel. She learned that travel tips online couldn't compete with those destinations you could only discover by word-of-mouth.\n\nSo, when she founded her travel business, KGM Travel Design, in 2024, she hoped to emphasize personal relationships with vendors and customers and avoid using AI, despite her experience with it.\n\n\"I don't think you can get good advice asking ChatGPT for an itinerary,\" she says. \"It's antithetical to everything I stand for.\"\n\nAnd yet, Magaraci realized that using AI for administrative tasks like analytics, compiling reports, and generating condensed client briefs allowed her to spend more time on the personalized relationships that set her business apart.\n\nShe's one of many solopreneurs who told Business Insider that outsourcing administrative tasks to AI platforms such as ChatGPT, Gemini, and Nano Banana — Gemini's photo-editing AI — has allowed them to scale their business by spending more time on strategic and creative work, including growth decisions and building personal connections with customers.\n\n\"It's getting harder and harder to deny the time-saving aspects,\" Magaraci says, adding that she has embraced AI \"in order to run a successful business and grow this business into what I want it to be.\"\n\nSeneca Connor, founder of The Bag Icon, an accessories brand, uses Nano Bana and other AI products to edit photos and videos. That not only saves her money — up to $2,000 per monthly photo shoot, she says — but also time.\n\nWith the hours saved, Connor has been able to design more original bags and launch a greater number of bags curated from other designers, all while reducing her marketing costs.\n\nAs a result, The Bag Icon saw more than a 20% year-over-year increase in profits last year, despite the impact of tariffs.\n\nAccountant and solopreneur Gloria Hebert uses ChatGPT for her business, Aybear Services, to instantly create educational client worksheets that previously took an hour or two to set up.\n\nThis frees up time that she then uses to prioritize analyzing financial data from her bookkeeping clients — data she doesn't feed into AI because of privacy concerns. Managing finances is the core of her business, so having more time to spend on that has allowed her to streamline her workdays.\n\nThe time saved also allows her to organize networking events and community education classes for local business owners, which has led to an uptick in business. \"Several of those entrepreneurs hired me to do their books,\" Hebert says.\n\nLisa York is the owner of Sell More Stuff, an email marketing business. Although she has a small audience, she saw a 33% conversion rate for sales last year, she says. She credits that growth to her personalized, voicey emails, which always open with a personal anecdote and are never written with AI.\n\n\"I use a lot of story-led emails,\" York says. \"People enjoy them, and they open the email because they can see my name.\"\n\nThat's something AI just can't replicate, she says. But York is able to spend time drafting engaging copy because she outsources other tasks — including tech support for her website, research, and brainstorming marketing strategy — to ChatGPT.\n\nLike York, Connor uses the time that AI saves to build robust communication and rapport with her customers, which she says builds loyalty to her business. Less time spent on photos and video gives her more time to respond to emails and direct messages from clients seeking advice about their purchases.\n\n\"It's building community that's missing in the big brands,\" Connor says.\n\nWhile AI has allowed these solopreneurs to grow their businesses without hiring a team, the technology shouldn't take over the core aspects of a business, Hebert says. Rather, it can be a tool that allows owners to focus on those critical areas.\n\n\"Use it as a resource,\" she says.\n\nYork — whose target clientele are other solopreneurs — says she's seeing more people recognize that. \"People aren't scared of it anymore,\" she says.\n\nConnor plans to expand her use of AI this year. She's experimenting with a digital clone — a video avatar that can deliver a script explaining new products. That approach will save her time on filming videos, but she says she'll always be the one dishing out the original advice that her clients have come to trust.\n\nEven if a video is created using AI, Connor says, \"all thoughts, ideas, and suggestions — those are my own.\"",

    "description": "The horse toy with an upside-down snout has resonated with tired corporates across the country.",
    "fullText": "A horse toy in China meant to be a Lunar New Year decoration has turned into a symbol of corporate agony on Chinese social media.\n\nThe red horse toy in question, made by the shop Happy Sisters in China's western Yiwu city, features an upside-down snout, giving it a morose look at odds with its festival golden bell. Per the Chinese zodiac, the incoming year will be the year of the horse.\n\nThe seller told local media that a shop worker had accidentally sewn the horse's smile upside down, turning it into a frown. But after the toy went viral on social media, the shop decided to produce more of the defective toy.\n\nHappy Sisters did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nFor many Chinese workers, the crying horse came to represent permission to be vulnerable — rare in the country's high-pressure work culture. China is infamous for its grueling 9-9-6 work culture, which means 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week.\n\nA user, He Qingshan, wrote on RedNote earlier this month that the doll is \"healing in a high-pressure society.\"\n\nPriced at about 25 Chinese yuan, or $3.60, its affordability helped it spread quickly online, turning it into a \"national-level emo doll\" and a form of \"collective emotional projection,\" they wrote.\n\nAnother person on RedNote, Liang Chenxing, said in a post in January that the horse's \"drooping mouth\" had \"struck a chord with contemporary workers.\" The post received more than 1,000 likes.\n\n\"Who hasn't had moments when they want to cry but still have to hold it together?\" the user wrote.\n\nOn the platform, creators have begun placing the horse beside their office computers, posting photos with captions like: \"Me when my proposal gets rejected.\"\n\nOne RedNote user described keeping it on their desk as having \"a little companion that understands all your fatigue and your dreams.\"\n\n\"It's okay to cry on the face, but life must always be moving forward!\" they wrote.\n\nMark Tanner, the managing director of Chinese consumer research firm China Skinny, said he wasn't sure he believed the manufacturing error story, but it was a smart business move nonetheless.\n\n\"This has been happening for some years, particularly with movements like lying flat, but it captures a general psyche where many Chinese consumers are feeling less optimistic at the moment,\" Tanner said.\n\nJacob Cooke, the CEO of Beijing-based e-commerce consulting firm WPIC Marketing + Technologies, said that \"younger consumers are increasingly comfortable acknowledging stress in light, ironic ways.\"\n\n\"Consumer products and internet memes can act as outlets for discussing work pressure, especially on platforms like Xiaohongshu, where consumer culture and emotional expression are tightly intertwined,\" Cooke said.\n\nHe compared the crying horse toy to Chinese toymaker Pop Mart's \"ugly-cute\" IPs, Labubu and Crybaby.\n\nAnd Jason Yu, the managing director of Beijing-based CTR Market Research, said the handmade sewing mistake on the toy resonated with audiences because it did not feel like a \"cold assembly-line product.\"\n\n\"The emotional value the toy conveys is higher than any perfect toy can provide,\" Yu said.",

We then took the geometric mean of the ones that pay at least $75,000, based on 2024 median annual wage data, and are expected to need more workers, based on projected employment growth from 2024 to 2034. We then ranked the jobs, with the larger the geometric mean, the better the rank.\n\nMany of the top 12 fell into one of three job groups: construction and extraction; protective service; or installation, maintenance, and repair.\n\nFirst-line supervisors of construction trades and extraction workers took the top spot. Employment of these supervisors is expected to grow by 49,000 from its 2024 level, and they typically make about $79,000 annually. It's also one of the roles that typically don't require a degree, but often require job seekers to have relevant experience.\n\nEmployers may be interested in candidates with higher educational attainment.

ReplyShareAnthony Amar 1hThanks for this post, very interesting. Glad to read that I'm not alone being bored about the waiting. More than a year of Cursor usage, I'm kinda see some serious downside to this amazing productivity: it erodes my focus. This waiting have something to do with it imho, because it urge me to do something else, and it often (always?) doesn't have to do with code.

    "description": "All seven new management committee members come from Goldman Sachs' growing asset and wealth management division, which oversees $3.6 trillion.",
    "fullText": "Goldman Sachs just announced seven new power players it's vaulting to its most powerful echelon — and the fact that they all sit in the same division tells you something about where the bank is headed.\n\nThe firm's management committee — currently 41 members — is adding seven seats for partners the bank appointed on Monday. All sit within the asset and wealth management business, which holds $3.6 trillion in assets, offering a snapshot about who's gaining influence at the highest levels of 200 West Street.\n\nThe executives run businesses spanning private credit, public investing, alternatives, and wealth management.\n\n\"The opportunity to continue to grow our franchise across AWM is a core strategic objective for the firm, and this group of leaders will help us advance our goals,\" CEO David Solomon said in an accompanying statement.\n\nThe management committee is Goldman's most senior governing body, responsible for overseeing strategy, capital allocation, and top leadership decisions. Its members still meet weekly to set the bank's agenda.\n\nTwo longtime leaders are stepping down from the committee, the bank said — Vice Chairman Richard Gnodde and Asset Management Chairman Rich Friedman — bringing the new tally to 46 people who collectively steer the firm.\n\nThe new management committee members are:\n\nThe leadership updates also mean new roles for Mallory and Somaiya — both partners, who have spent more than 25 years each at Goldman, are currently leaders in the private banking group. Now, they'll assume the title of global co-heads of wealth management.\n\nIn its most recent earnings report, Goldman said private banking and lending revenue rose 16% in 2025, while assets under supervision across asset and wealth management climbed to a record $3.6 trillion, driven by management fees, lending activity, and client inflows.\n\nTheir appointments come as the bank steels itself for what it hopes will be a gangbuster year for business — maybe even rivaling storied 2021 levels.\n\nBut Goldman is also facing mounting competition from all corners of Wall Street — intensifying battles for clients and talent, and a more crowded market for private credit and wealth services.\n\nUnder Solomon's tenure, Goldman has spent several years pursuing a broader effort to grow its asset and wealth management business, making it a more well-rounded institutional investor active across multiple asset classes.\n\nIn late 2022, the firm moved Marc Nachmann, a former senior investment banker, into the role of running the merged Asset & Wealth Management division, combining them under the same roof. Since then, Goldman has worked to operate the businesses as one integrated platform, spanning public investing, private markets, private credit, and private wealth. Over the past three years, the business' collective assets under supervision have swelled more than $1 trillion from about $2.5 trillion at the end of 2022.\n\nAnd the bank has pursued a multi-year effort to connect those businesses through its One Goldman Sachs initiative, designed to encourage cross-collaboration and -pollination of commercial opportunities between bankers and financial advisors who can share the same clients and maximize profits.",

    "fullText": "A question for America's business leaders: Do you think that masked federal agents were right to shoot and kill protester Alex Pretti on a Minneapolis street on Saturday?\n\nIf the answer is yes, then no need to read further.\n\nFor the rest of you: If you are sickened by what you saw this weekend — say that. Out loud. And don't qualify it with \"both sides\" framing — just say that the thing that you saw, with your own eyes, is appalling.\n\nI understand why most of you have not said this yet. You have several reasons to be quiet.\n\nTo be clear, I'm not asking you to launch an ad campaign, or order up some performative Instagram posts, or any other kind of corporate theatre.\n\nJust say the thing you believe is right: It's wrong for masked federal agents to kill protesters in the streets, and that you condemn it.\n\nYou can go further if you'd like. Perhaps a call for the Trump administration to take accountability for its agents' actions. Maybe you can ask for a truly independent investigation into Pretti's killing. Whatever your conscience tells you.\n\nAnd yes, I know that it's easier for me to say this than for you to do it. There could be consequences for you and your companies when you speak out: Most people are appalled by Pretti's death, but not all of them.\n\nShortly after Pretti's death, Trump administration officials described him as a \"would-be assassin\" who \"wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement\" — characterizations without evidence, but meant to justify Pretti's death. On Saturday, Trump posted a photo of a gun administration officials say was removed from Pretti, and argued that \"ICE had to protect themselves — Not an easy thing to do!\" In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Trump said that the administration was \"reviewing everything\" about the shooting, but said that overall, his agents had done a \"phenomenal job\" in Minnesota.\n\nSo there could be real risk for you. But the bigger risk is silence.\n\nThat's because your silence tells everyone who is appalled by Pretti's death that they shouldn't speak up, either. That gives the federal government the tacit permission to carry on.\n\nSo say you're against that. Now. Before it stops shocking you.",

    "title": "8 Americans explain how capitalism has shaped — and failed — their lives",
    "description": "Business Insider spoke to readers in their 20s to 80s about what capitalism means to them and why some of them are rethinking the system.",
    "fullText": "Business Insider recently launched our Future of Capitalism series to examine shifting attitudes about capitalism, fairness, opportunity, hard work, and success in the US — everything from the federal government's role in the economy to the change in how capitalism is being taught in high schools.\n\nWe also wanted to hear directly from you, our readers, about how America's economic system has shaped your life.\n\nHundreds of you weighed in, and several people agreed to be interviewed to share more deeply their experiences, uncertainty, frustration, and cautious optimism — a revealing snapshot of how capitalism is being reassessed in real time, across generations.\n\nAn 81-year-old woman in California living on Social Security described spending her life climbing a hill that keeps getting steeper. A 54-year-old in Las Vegas says he's still waiting for boomers to pass his generation the baton. A 25-year-old from Tennessee who enlisted in the military to pay for college said the system isn't really working, while a 64-year-old New Jersey retiree called capitalism the \"greatest economic system in the world.\"\n\nBelow, we highlight eight people's personal experiences of capitalism. Their words have been edited for length and clarity.\n\nAlex English, 38, is based in Tampa, FL, and is currently unemployed after being laid off.\n\nI've been unemployed for a year and a half. Before being laid off, I lived in LA and worked in marketing and communications at a startup. I was making almost $125,000 and still felt poor.\n\nCapitalism makes us think we constantly need more: to shop more, to accumulate more, to keep up. I'm back in Tampa, where I grew up, because I didn't have the savings to sustain my life in LA.\n\nI don't feel great about my ability to improve my situation through hard work alone. I've relentlessly networked to find a full-time job, taken on freelance work, and gotten a retail job. I'm working harder than I ever have and yet making significantly less money than before.\n\nWe're inheriting a system that feels ultimately outdated. Everything from private property and ownership to the climate crisis feels unsustainable. We're paying into Social Security, and that may not be there for us when we're retirement age.\n\nSince my layoff, I've been reading a lot about economics and business. Is there another way that we could be doing things? My generation — millennials — is in favor of something kinder and more egalitarian than the policies we've seen since the Reagan era. Not because we're lazy or unwilling to work hard, but because we believe all people deserve basic rights and dignity, and that American exceptionalism is dead in the world.\n\nHarish Bhandari, 64, Cape May, New Jersey. He retired from his job in the advertising industry at 59.\n\nI'm happily retired. I spent my entire career in advertising and marketing — worked on Madison Avenue, then spent 23 or 24 years at an agency in Minneapolis, and 15 years at my last company.\n\nCapitalism is the greatest economic system in the world. As long as you're willing to work hard over a long period of time, you're going to be rewarded, and success should follow.\n\nI didn't grow up wealthy. I lived in Darien, Connecticut. My father was from India, and my mom was German. She grew up during the war and didn't go to college. My father passed away when I was 13. I'm not going to say we were poor, but we weren't wealthy. I'm thankful I've worked hard my whole life and made some good moves.\n\nThe obvious legacy my generation is leaving is that we're able to pass generational wealth to our kids. I'm an early baby boomer. Boomers get a hard time as far as having been lucky, but I think we've also worked very hard. Sometimes you create your own luck that way. We didn't have social media and cellphones, so we didn't have a lot of things bombarding us that would distract us from what we believed was important.\n\nI currently have a very high level of trust in our economic institutions because it's about the free market. As long as the institutions provide security and stability, the market has always worked as far as this country has been around. When you try to start messing with that market, that's the problem.\n\nMatthew Doutt, 25, Knoxville, Tennessee. He's an accountant.\n\nIn my senior year of high school, a military recruiter sat down with me and explained the average in-state college tuition. I didn't see any options to earn my degree that didn't involve the military or going into debt.\n\nI knew college was expensive, and my parents were kind of pushing me toward the military for that reason. Once I enlisted, I realized many other people there were in the same boat, or very similar boats, as I was. I'm grateful for the benefits from the military, but my mental health was at an all-time low during my time in the Guard. It's a travesty that any American would need to sign a contract that could result in their death to pay for a degree without going into debt.\n\nEven after I finished my bachelor's degree in 2022, the firm I started working at wasn't a good fit, so I left. I couldn't find work for four months. I was completely reliant on the Guard again, this time to pay my bills. That was another moment when I realized this system really isn't working as intended.\n\nI now hold both my bachelor's and master's degrees, as well as a CPA license. I worked hard for them, but I wouldn't have been able to earn my bachelor's degree without the Guard, and I wouldn't have been able to get my CPA license without my firm paying for it.\n\nI believe my generation has inherited difficult circumstances. Corporations are more concentrated, and the US DOJ has been less empowered than ever to break up monopolies.\n\nI want to trust these major institutions and systems because they don't improve if you don't believe in them. At the same time, if what they're doing isn't good to begin with, it's kind of hard to trust them.\n\nJeremy Holmes, 40, lives in Denver. He is a senior developer in the furniture import industry.\n\nMy dad is what I'd call a bad capitalist, because he takes care of his employees. He owns an IT firm, and I worked for him until I was in my early 30s. He was a firm believer that hard work will get you far in life. And it did; he was a kid of immigrants, and he clawed his way out. My mom is Lakota, grew up on various reservations, and got out.\n\nMy parents have a very nice upper-middle-class life. They're not yacht-money people. My dad went from working as a 12 or 14-year-old in a print shop and has always had that \"work hard and you will be rewarded\" mentality. I was raised with that. Then I entered the workforce and started looking around. The hard workers aren't the ones who are getting paid the most.\n\nI feel the people working in the factory are working much harder than the people on the other side of the office. I'm fortunate enough to be on that other side because I got a leg up from my parents. I don't see a way for people to claw their way into a comfortable living if they weren't born into it.\n\nMy main concern is being a programmer in the AI era. I've been doing this for most of my life. I can stay above it, but I'm more worried than I was before. I don't see how anyone can bring a child into this world and not be terrified for them. I have plenty of friends who are not doing as well, and I used to tell them to get into IT; I can't even tell them that anymore.\n\nJenni Abbott,71, lives in Antioch, IL. She works as a principal scientist.\n\nI don't believe that hard work alone plays any significant role in an outcome. Not working hard can cost you your job. Working hard does not guarantee any sort of success.\n\nI left the industry for about 20 years to be a stay-at-home mom of four kids. When I was 42, my husband died suddenly. I went into education. I was first a kindergarten aide for three years, and then a high school registrar for six. I was lucky enough to get a job as an associate toxicologist. We were literally running out of money at that point.\n\nI've now been with the same company for over 20 years. While I'm not completely satisfied with how I was rewarded in my career, I also understand that I am doing better than a great number of people out there, and I'm relatively financially secure. One of the reasons I'm still working is that I don't want to be that poor.\n\nI'm all for a mixed system. I believe capitalism is a good start, but I don't believe it's a good ending place. I believe that additional resources need to be there for it to be successful, and there needs to be support in place so everybody has the same chances at upward mobility.\n\nI don't think we baby boomers lived up to our potential for what we should've left behind for the next generation. Social safety nets are important for a lot of people, and we could have done a much better job of preparing our country for that.\n\nKathy Curtis, 81, lives in California. She works part-time in customer service and data entry for a local water company.\n\nI started out like everybody else with the expectation that you grow up, get married, have children, and live happily ever after, which is what we were taught. That didn't happen for me because within a year of following the plan, all of a sudden, I was a single parent. At one point, I was working four jobs.\n\nI didn't have the strength to branch out into other fields of study or work to try to get ahead because I was so busy trying to just maintain everything. From my 20s to my 40s, I felt I could keep climbing up the hill. I think after my 40s, in general, that hill got steeper, and not as many people were able to climb it.\n\nI'll struggle for the rest of my life. My main income at this point is Social Security, and I still work two days a week, earning $18 an hour in a customer service and data entry role for a local water company. I've learned how to not look like a poor person when I am one, and not live like one. So much of life is attitude.\n\nKirk Reynolds, 54, lives in Las Vegas. He is an architect.\n\nI entered the workforce in 1997 and have spent the last 28 years working as an architect. I worry a lot about the future liquidity of Social Security because if we don't have Social Security in 10 years' time, I don't know what I'll do.\n\nI'm fortunate to now own my home outright, but it took a lot of sacrifice over the years to get there. I didn't travel or spend a lot of extra money; it was a deliberate and challenging choice. However, wages have somewhat stalled out. I earn more now than I did when I started in the workforce, but after 28 years, I don't earn much more. I was around 28 when I started my 401(k), and I have less than $100,000 in it 20-some years later. I'll be lucky if there's $115,000 in there when I retire.\n\nI think part of the problem is the boomer generation; they're among the oldest people in our society now, and a lot of them just haven't left the CEO roles, the managerial roles. I'm not sure if that's purely because they can't afford to retire, or if there's also an element of ego involved, but I'm 54, and I'm still waiting for them to finally pass the baton to the next generation.\n\nI'm worried that my generation will be skipped because all of a sudden, when the leaders in their 70s and 80s finally retire, they'll give the roles to the 40-year-olds.\n\nIt's sad because I think Gen X would do a very good job of leading. We are the bridge generation, born at a time when we can recall how things were in the 1970s, and how things are now.\n\nGabrielle Benson, 29, lives in Chicago. She works in inclusion and experience at a tech company.\n\nI'm on the cusp of millennial and Gen Z. There was so much transition, development, and growth that we came up through. Some people in my generation think capitalism is great and were able to benefit from that change, but a lot of us recognize its more negative impact.\n\nWe're coming from a background in the post-recession, post-Obama, post-social media era. We don't see the American dream as a gilded promise the way previous generations did.\n\nI grew up Black and middle-class in Washington, DC. But I went to a private boarding school for high school, so I've had proximity to a lot of wealth. The experience of being at this school and then going home to my mom, who worked two jobs, compared to the other parents, who worked just as hard, but had institutional knowledge or advantages that we didn't, started opening my eyes. Hard work is not valued equally under this system.\n\nInequity is not a side effect of capitalism; it is a condition required for it to function. Instead of family stories about hard work granting stability or prosperity, we have stories about hard work being stolen or dismissed by the systems meant to reward it.\n\nThere are so many factors outside an average person's control that can determine their success: the job market, housing market, healthcare, race, sex, and gender. I have a corporate job, a degree, and retirement accounts, and it still feels like it can all be taken away by factors outside my control.\n\nI think we have a lot of opportunities as millennials. We're still young; we can still make a lot of change, but I think it will require a lot of unlearning the knowledge we were passed down, like the idea that you just have to work hard.\n\nI don't think that we're going to have a different system in our lifetime. Maybe that's something our grandkids might be able to experience. We're going to have to navigate and manage capitalism.\n\nShare your thoughts about capitalism in America by filling out our survey.",

    "fullText": "Synthesia makes digital presenters for clients to use in corporate videos and counts 70% of FTSE 100 as customers\n\nA British AI startup that makes realistic video avatars has almost doubled its valuation to $4bn (£3bn), in a boost for the UK technology sector.\n\nSynthesia was valued at $2.1bn last year and moved into new offices in central London, marking the moment with a ceremony attended by the Sadiq Khan, the city’s mayor, and Peter Kyle, then technology secretary.\n\nOn Monday, it announced its latest funding round, led by an existing investor, Google Ventures, had raised $200m and valued the British company at $4bn. Google Ventures is the search firm’s venture capital arm.\n\nSynthesia uses human actors to generate digital avatars of people and also offers employers the ability to create replicas of their staff. Those avatars are then deployed by organisations in corporate videos in a range of scenarios such as health and safety in the workplace, advising on cybersecurity and how to communicate better at work.\n\nThe company counts 70% of the FTSE 100 as clients, including NatWest, Lloyds Bank and British Gas. It is also used by non-corporate bodies including the NHS, the European Commission and the United Nations.\n\nThe startup is also developing new avatars that will help train employees and give them new skills, through scenarios such as role-playing and giving tailored explanations.\n\nSynthesia’s co-founder, Steffen Tjerrild, said the increased valuation reflected the commitment of the company’s longstanding backers rather than the investment hype surrounding the AI sector. “Existing investors have seen the progress, have seen the numbers, have seen them compound year over year,” he said. “That is also telling a story that this is less [a case of] external investors trying to kind of hype it up, but more about validation from existing investors as well.”\n\nLast year, a leading British tech investor, James Anderson, said he found sharp increases in valuations of AI startups such as OpenAI and Anthropic “disconcerting”. Tjerrild said Synthesia was focusing on executing its business plan, which, he added, was backed by investors who were long-term supporters.\n\n“This round is led by insiders, or predominantly existing investors that deeply understand the business, have seen the execution and the improvement of the business over many years,” he said.\n\nSynthesia generated revenues of $58.3m in 2024 but made a pre-tax loss of $59.2m, according to its latest published accounts, which the company said reflected its investment in headcount, its technology and new offices. Synthesia said it was on track to make $200m in revenues this year.\n\nThe $4bn valuation puts the company on a par with UK broadcaster ITV, which is worth £3.1bn. Tjerrild’s shareholding in Synthesia is now worth $160m, the same as its chief executive and fellow co-founder, Victor Riparbelli.\n\nSynthesia was founded in 2017 by the two Danish nationals, as well as the computer scientists Matthias Niessner and Lourdes Agapito.\n\nLast year, the London mayor said Synthesia was doing “incredibly well” as he opened its new offices. However, in a speech this month Khan said AI would “usher in a new era of mass unemployment” if used recklessly, as intelligent, autonomous systems proved cheap replacements for humans.\n\nTjerrild said he believed AI would enable businesses to hire more staff. “We’re an AI-first company, we have 600 employees and we hired 40% more people last year,” he said. “As a business owner myself, if my employees become more productive that means I can invest and hire more people.",

    "description": "An AI/ML Success Architect helps companies decide when to use AI, when not to, and how to design and build systems for real business impact.",
    "fullText": "I did some AI consulting for computer vision. A lot of times, the value that I brought to the company was telling them not to use AI. I was the AI expert, and they described the problem, and I said, “Don’t use AI.” This is my value add.\n\nLast year, I went through some exercises to clarify what I do for clients. I ended up with descriptions of various lengths, but still felt like I needed something shorter and more generic. Then it hit me – I’m an AI/ML Success Architect!\n\nTo my surprise, a Google search for the exact term yielded zero results, so I quickly changed my website title to claim it. Now, it’s time to define the title in more detail.\n\nMy commitment to AI/ML success and to serving people and causes I care about is a large part of why I work independently rather than as an employee. It makes it easier to say no to unnecessary projects, and avoid going down the path of reluctant data engineering.\n\nMy current LinkedIn tagline is “helping climate tech founders ship AI/ML solutions that support multi-million dollar growth goals”. This means my typical leads have a low chance of success, as more than 90% of startups and 80% of AI/ML projects fail. By working with founders who are a good fit – and by helping them avoid overinvestment in AI/ML – my aim is to help them beat the odds and successfully ascend the AI/ML maturity curve.

    "fullText": "As kids, there was always that one place we begged our parents to take us to, or got excited about visiting for a birthday party or a school field trip.\n\nAfter all, kids' fixations are simple: Give them pizza and entertainment, and they'll happily stay occupied for hours. When a business offers both, it often becomes a welcome break for parents as well.\n\nEveryone has their own version of that place, whether it's Chuck E. Cheese, Dave & Buster's, or Main Event. Over the years, these spots have become go-to destinations for families across the country. In Texas, however, one chain has long stood apart as a source of Lone Star pride.\n\nMr Gatti's Pizza began in 1964 as a small restaurant called \"The Pizza Place\" in Stephenville, Texas. Five years later, it relocated to Austin and was renamed Mr Gatti's, in honor of the founder's wife's maiden name.\n\nDuring the 1970s, the Mr Gatti's brand expanded into a chain and introduced buffet-style dining, an innovation that helped distinguish it from competitors.\n\nAlthough the Austin restaurant predated the first Chuck E. Cheese location (which opened in San Jose, California, in 1977), Mr Gatti's didn't really jump onto the entertainment-plus-pizza trend until the 1980s. The concept quickly won over families, and today Mr Gatti's Pizza operates more than 200 locations across Texas and the southeastern U.S.\n\nIndustry experts say this hybrid model has become increasingly valuable as traditional casual dining struggles to compete for consumers. According to a 2025 McKinsey & Company survey, 45% of surveyed consumers have reduced their spending at pizza restaurants.\n\n\"When there's good entertainment and good experiences, check averages go up,\" Downtown Restaurant Investments President and BYOD CEO Dave Dittenber told Restaurant Dive.\n\nDittenber added that entertainment only works when paired with strong service and quality food.\n\nMr Gatti's Pizza has sold a majority stake in its business to OneRyan Global LLC, the family office of businessman and philanthropist G. Brint Ryan, according to a press release. The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.\n\nOneRyan has been a franchisee of Mr Gatti's Pizza since 2022, but its involvement with the brand has steadily expanded.\n\nIn September 2025, OneRyan acquired a minority stake in the company and, a month later, purchased a corporate-owned restaurant at South Park Meadows in Austin. That transaction completed Mr Gatti's Pizza's transition to a fully franchised system and concluded the re-franchising of all company-owned locations.",

    "title": "How business and tech leaders are reacting to the latest fatal ICE shooting in Minneapolis",
    "description": "The killing of Alex Pretti, a US citizen, by ICE in Minneapolis on Saturday has drawn sharp responses from many Americans, including business leaders.",
    "fullText": "Federal immigration agents on Saturday shot and killed a US citizen in Minneapolis — the second fatal shooting involving ICE officers this month — adding more fuel to an already explosive national debate over immigration enforcement.\n\nThe killing sparked an outcry on Minneapolis streets, as well as online, eliciting sharp responses from all sides, including leaders in the business and tech communities.\n\nThe billionaire CEO of Pershing Square Capital Management, Bill Ackman, for instance, wrote in a post on X that it was \"time to take the temperature down before more lives are lost.\"\n\nMinnesota officials, including Gov. Tim Walz, criticized the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, for what they said were overly aggressive tactics. The DHS, meanwhile, defended its agents, arguing that they are being provoked by unruly protesters and an uncooperative city government and police.\n\nThousands of ICE officers began descending on Minnesota on December 1 as part of Operation Metro Surge. The DHS says it is targeting criminal activity among immigrants in the state and has deployed over 2,000 ICE agents across Minnesota.\n\nResidents of Minneapolis and neighboring St. Paul have been protesting since the federal immigration agents arrived. Those demonstrations grew more intense after the first fatal shooting on January 7. In that incident, ICE agents shot and killed Renee Good, 37, as she tried to drive away in a car.\n\nHere's how business and tech leaders are reacting to the latest violence.\n\nThe hedge-fund billionaire called for calm in an X post on Saturday, lamenting that the United States had reached a point where \"there are only two sides to every issue and every incident.\"\n\n\"Individuals are 'convicted' of serious crimes in the headlines, by politicians appealing to their base, and ultimately in the minds of the public, or they are exonerated, before all of the facts are in and a detailed investigation has been completed,\" He wrote. \"This is not good for America.\"\n\nJust two hours later, in another post on X, Ackman laid the blame on Minnesota's state government.\n\n\"It is almost as if the governor of Minnesota called for protesters to intervene in ICE enforcements in an incendiary manner,\" he said, tagging Walz. \"Inciting the people to rise up against law enforcement is guaranteed to end badly, and now we have seen the tragic consequences.\"\n\nLike Ackman, billionaire LinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman is perpetually online, posting frequently on social media. He has been largely quiet this weekend, though he has reposted comments from other people, including one that called ICE \"out of control.\"\n\nIn another post that Hoffman amplified, an X user called out \"chronically online tech leaders\" for suddenly falling quiet. Another X user called on business and tech leaders to use their platform to stand up to the Trump administration and its immigration enforcement tactics, to which Hoffman replied, \"It's time for all Americans to do so.\"\n\nJeff Dean, Google DeepMind's chief scientist, wrote in response to a video of the shooting circulating on X: \"This is absolutely shameful.\"\n\n\"Agents of a federal agency unnecessarily escalating, and then executing a defenseless citizen whose offense appears to be using his cellphone camera,\" he wrote. \"Every person, regardless of political affiliation, should be denouncing this.\"\n\nMinneapolis police confirmed that Pretti, who was filming ICE agents when they wrestled him to the ground, was legally carrying a gun.\n\nBorder Patrol officials said Pretti had threatened them with the gun, but multiple videos of the incident show that agents had already disarmed and subdued Pretti when he was shot.\n\nJason Calacanis, a prominent investor and entrepreneur who is these days perhaps most known as one of the hosts of the popular \"All-In\" podcast, blamed the country's political leaders in a post on X on Sunday.\n\n\"Once again, I will remind everyone that our leaders are failing us,\" he wrote. \"True leadership would be to calm this situation down by telling these non-peaceful protesters to stay home while recalling these inadequately-trained agents.\"\n\nHe later posted that \"all of this violence\" could be avoided by fining businesses that hire immigrants who are not in the country legally.\n\nCristina Cordova, the chief operating officer at Linear, a product management software company, called the incident \"indefensible\" in a post on X.\n\n\"The victim's legally owned handgun was removed from the scene, and then ICE agents shot him multiple times. It's far from law enforcement — it's just murder,\" she wrote.\n\n\"Those who defend this don't care about law or order. It's about money, power, and protecting an executive branch that's already been bought and paid for.\"",

    "title": "5 acquisitions, winning over skeptical engineers, and spending tens of millions: Inside a public company's 'AI native' push",
    "description": "Amplitude gave Business Insider the inside look at its AI overhaul, from acquisitions to efforts to increase staff adoption of AI coding assistants.",
    "fullText": "There's a long banner hanging in Amplitude's San Francisco office. It reads: \"NO MAGICAL THINKING.\"\n\nNo, it's not some rag on Joan Didion. It's a reminder, CEO Spenser Skates told Business Insider, that technology can never replace deep thinking and hard work. In the AI age, that reminder is more important than ever — so much so that employees must look up at it every day.\n\nAmplitude, an 800-person, publicly traded analytics company, is undergoing an AI transformation — with the goal of reinvigorating its business.\n\nAmplitude went public in September 2021 at the height of the pandemic, climbing to an all-time closing high of $84.80 per share several weeks later before dropping significantly and largely plateauing in in recent years around $10. It closed at $10.25 on Friday.\n\nSince October 2024, the company has acquired five AI startups. Amplitude hired an AI-savvy engineering head and appointed one of its acquired founders to a new AI leadership position. It got Cursor and GitHub Copilot licenses for employees, and ran a heads-down AI week.\n\nIt's a change many companies are making: Rapidly moving from little-to-no AI to trying to become \"AI native,\" a term that's curiously hard to pin down. Large language models are popping up everywhere in white-collar work as companies chase the promise of efficiency gains.\n\nAmplitude's case may be especially informative, given just how skeptical of AI its CEO was. In 2023 and some of 2024, Skates said he viewed the AI industry as full of \"grifters,\" the visionaries promising to end world hunger and salesmen promising to automate everything.\n\n\"It had all sorts of problems,\" Skates said. By mid-2024, he realized \"there's probably going to be a breakthrough in the analytics space in the next two or three years.\"\n\n\"We've got to go make that ourselves,\" he said. \"So, we went all in.\"\n\nSkates had two opening moves for his AI overhaul.\n\nThe first: hiring a new chief engineering officer with a history in AI. Wade Chambers had advised the company since 2016, while holding leadership roles at Twitter and Included Health.\n\nWhen Chambers joined in October 2024, only 1% of the engineering, product, and design teams at Amplitude were using AI.\n\nThe second was the acquisition of Command AI, a chatbot startup. It was the first of a string of acquisitions, including June, Kraftful, and Inari. Amplitude announced its most recent acquisition, InfiniGrow, on January 14.\n\nYana Welinder was CEO of Kraftful, one of Amplitude's acquisition targets. Kraftful could spot power users of its product, one of whom was Amplitude's then-CPO. She reached out, and they chatted in February. The deal closed in July, and Welinder was named Amplitude's head of AI. A company blog post with an introductory Q&A referred to her as \"AI maven.\"\n\nWelinder's first order of business: speeding the company up. Kraftful shipped new product every week. Amplitude was shipping less than monthly.\n\n\"If you have this cadence of shipping infrequently, then the team slows down, which isn't appropriate in the age of AI,\" she said.\n\n\"Analytics will look very different 6 months from now,\" Skates wrote in his email. \"We have the opportunity to be the AI native company in Analytics and we are going to pull every piece of firepower we have.\"\n\nHe also asked employees to share a coming launch on X, as opposed to LinkedIn, because that's \"where the AI natives are.\"\n\nHow much has Amplitude spent on AI, from tools to acquisitions? \"Tens of millions, for sure,\" Skates said. \"I wouldn't be surprised if it got past $100 million.\"\n\nThen comes the harder part: convincing employees to really use the tools.\n\nWhile some engineers are excited about AI's promise, others are skeptical about its helpfulness, or worried about possible job losses. Not every engineer is as gung ho about AI as their management is.\n\nSkates said that engineers were especially sensitive to the \"grifting\" that went on in AI, making many of them skeptical. With a bottoms-up approach, that skepticism dissipates, he said.\n\nSoon after joining, Chambers began planning an \"AI week\" for the first week of June. It took six months of prep and borrowed heavily from Facebook's mobile push. He took the entire engineering, product, and design team offline for the week. To kick off, Chambers required that leaders get onstage and vibe-code something in front of the entire company.\n\n\"It didn't go well,\" Chambers said of the live vibe-coding demonstration. \"They had to work through it. They had to re-prompt a couple of different ways.\"\n\nBut the message stuck, he said. Leaders who weren't coding all day were able to build something \"pretty cool\" within the hourlong session, save a few hiccups.\n\nAdditional momentum came from the \"zealots,\" engineers passionate about exploring the new tech (some of whom Chambers brought over from his prior job). These engineers lead by example, he said.\n\nAmplitude shared its internal data tracking how many employees use its AI tools. In the final week of March, 14 employees were actively using Cursor. That figure peaked in the first week of December — after AI week but before the holiday vacation cycle — at 174 employees.\n\nAnd what of the thorny question about AI implementation in the enterprise: ROI? After all, a 2025 MIT study indicated 95% of firms publicly disclosing use of AI pilots reported no measurable ROI.\n\nAfter implementing these tools, developer productivity shot up 40% and stayed there, Chambers said. On some specific engineering teams, those gains looks more like 300-400%, he said.\n\n\"There's going to be a lot of people who are thinking they're the world's best expert at something,\" Chambers said. \"Increasingly, even the most cynical team members have come around.\"",

    "description": "80-year-old Robin Blair runs his family's greengrocer's, founded in 1875. He started helping in the business at age 5 and says he will never retire.",
    "fullText": "This interview is based on a conversation with greengrocer Robin Blair, 80, the owner of JJ Blair & Sons in Darlington, in the North-East of England. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWe have an old saying in our family: \"There are two chairs that will kill you in life — the electric chair and the armchair.\"\n\nCapital punishment won't apply to me, or at least I hope not! And there's no way I'll retire to put my feet up and sit in front of the TV.\n\nIt's not in my nature, or my blood. My father, Joe, worked in our greengrocery, founded in 1875, until he was in his nineties.\n\nYou could say I joined the trade when I was a few months old in 1940. We're based at an indoor market, and my mother would tuck me under the counter while she served the customers.\n\nYou were expected to help at the nursery almost as soon as you could walk. By the time I was 5, I'd be sowing seeds, planting cabbage, and looking after tomatoes.\n\nMy siblings and I — including my younger brother, Keith, my business partner until he died in 2013 — were given our own plot of land to work.\n\nWe were allowed to keep the proceeds. I used to grow vegetables with an easy return, like lettuce, because they matured quickly. There was a friendly rivalry among us kids over who made the biggest profit.\n\nI couldn't wait to leave school at 15 and work full-time, even though it was physically demanding at times. We grew everything ourselves until we began moving toward wholesale.\n\nYou spent the morning harvesting and washing the produce. Then you'd load up the wooden cart and our trusty horse, Bobby, would pull it three-and-a-half miles to the market.\n\nMy grandfather, Jack, who established JJ Blair & Sons 150 years ago, was a proud man and wouldn't let Bobby leave without polishing his harness. Neither he nor my dad would dream of having a mechanical vehicle. Everything was horse-drawn.\n\nBack then, the market ran from 3 p.m. to midnight. The manager would ring a bell at 9 p.m., signaling that you could start auctioning the stuff you had left over.\n\nIt was fun shouting out your wares to attract the highest bidder. There was no refrigeration in those days, and you'd take the leftovers back to the nursery to compost.\n\nOur motto was \"More flash, more cash,\" meaning that the better the produce appeared, the more money you made. I still live by that rule.\n\nThe apples gleam on our stand, and the bananas are at the right stage of ripeness. We grow our own soft fruits in our greenhouses, including strawberries, raspberries, and blueberries. They always look delicious.\n\nI also pride myself on writing the signs that show the prices, both in pounds, ounces, and kilograms. The letters are spelled out nicely. It's a bit like doing calligraphy.\n\nThe glory days were the 1960s, 70s, and much of the 80s. The indoor and outdoor markets were bustling with nearly 200 stands. They were right in the center of town, a hub of activity.\n\nThen the big supermarkets came along. It changed everything. They're fighting among themselves over pricing, undercutting us, and it's hard to compete. People like the ease of going to them, especially with the free parking.\n\nStill, we have many loyal customers. Sadly, we're the only greengrocers left in the market today. Shoppers come for the fresh produce, the personal service, and the lively conversation.\n\nA strong work ethic was instilled in me as a child, and I have no problem getting up at 4:30 a.m. daily to prepare for the market, which opens at 8 a.m.\n\nI usually get back to the nursery around 3 p.m., where we also grow bedding plants. My working day can last until 8 or even 10 p.m. in the summer, to take advantage of the lighter nights.\n\nThis trade has given me a better life than I could have hoped for. I wish Keith were still here, but I'm delighted to be running the business at 80.\n\nIt makes me sad to think what might happen after I'm gone. When I ask my daughter, Alyson, if she'll continue in the family tradition, she'll laugh and say, \"Never say never.\"\n\nMeanwhile, my long-suffering wife, Alwyn, keeps me happy and healthy, and I keep a positive outlook. It's my 81st birthday in May, and I plan to keep going for years after then.\n\nDo you have a story about working a job longer than most? Please email Jane Ridley at jridley@businessinsider.com",

    "fullText": "Kyle Elliott, who's been a full-time career coach since 2017, spends his days helping tech employees solve their most challenging work issues.\n\nHe's noticed a common problem among clients: difficult bosses, including micromanagers.\n\nOne key mistake employees make when they're trying to fix a problem, Elliot told Business Insider, is venting to the wrong person — particularly your boss.\n\nIt makes sense to push back against a difficult boss when their behaviour or expectations are disrupting your work, said Elliot, who is based in California. But venting to them will rarely make the situation better, but nearly always damage trust, he added.\n\nEven if you have a good relationship, it would be more appropriate to vent to a friend, family member, or career coach. They can also help you brainstorm solutions.\n\n\"Your boss is not your therapist. You want to come to them with solutions, or at least a clear sense of how they can help you improve the situation or the working relationship,\" he said. \"If you want a promotion, you want your boss to view you as someone who is thoughtful and solution-oriented, not someone who complains.\"\n\nWhen you organize the feedback session with a difficult boss, choose a private setting, such as in a 1-1 meeting, and interlace constructive feedback with positive remarks about things they do that you like.\n\nAnother common issue Elliott encounters is clients misusing their time with him by ranting about their struggles with their boss and what's frustrating them, he said.\n\n\"They often believe they must provide extensive context in order to receive effective coaching, but this isn't true,\" he said.\n\n\"You can vent,\" Elliot added, but \"it's a very expensive venting session.\" While it may feel cathartic, you're better off airing your frustrations to a friend and using your paid coaching session to outline what you can change, such as what battles with your boss to choose, or how to communicate better with them.\n\n\"Coaching is about empowering you, not venting about your manager. Your boss isn't in the coaching session. You are,\" he said.\n\nRead more of Elliott's tips for dealing with a difficult boss.",

    "description": "In this Sunday edition of Business Insider Today, we're reflecting on BI's week at the World Economic Forum in Davos.",
    "fullText": "The global elite of Davos probably isn't what you think of when you think about spunky Business Insider. But we sent a small editorial team to bring you the best of it — BI-style — and I want to tell you about it.\n\nAki Ito is our chief correspondent on careers, a huge topic for Davos — and for us. She asked people across business tough questions about the future of work (believe me, I was in the room) to help bring insights for your success. She also moderated a conversation with chief people officers from companies across the business world. You'll see her takeaways from that soon.\n\nBen Bergman on tech, same thing. Ben is a leading scoop-getter and thinker on our crackerjack tech team. We know you care about tech from every angle — innovation, work, investments, culture, productivity hacks, fun. Ben was all over town meeting with people and moderating panels so that we can be in-the-know on what's in and what's out for you. You might have caught Ben on CNN twice last week!\n\nDan DeFrancesco is the lead writer on this newsletter every weekday. As you know, it's a smart, witty read across tech, markets, and business — the opposite of aggregation that's common in newsletters. So it's important for us to make sure Dan has the widest view of what's going on in the world. As he hustled around, Dan also wrote our new pop-up Davos Diary newsletter every day last week. We hope to do more special editions to meet these moments!\n\nKim Last leads our live journalism — events like panels and conferences IRL, and live conversations online. We put on three events at Davos, convening some of the most interesting and in-the-flow people on the mountain. We'll keep you informed of what's on our calendar, as conversing with the audience we're serving is a top priority at BI right now. (Kim also got a now-famous hair blowout at the start of the week — Davos hack!)\n\nWe know not everyone can make it across the world. That's why, in addition to the special newsletter, we did a daily live blog, bringing you everything from the serious to the wacky. Across last week, we did 180 posts, not just from the five of us, but from reporters and editors who did an excellent job following the chatter from around the world. Those blogs, and our wrap post, are available here.\n\nWhat about me? I was there doing the Davos thing — meetings, moderations. But I also made a point to snap some photos of the fabulous fashion. You can find all that we gathered on that fun front here.\n\nAll of which is to say, we dive into the biggest things happening in the world, in our style, for you.\n\nPlease stay in touch at eic@businessinsider.com.",
